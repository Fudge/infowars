[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  It is Monday, April 13th, the year of 2020.
[00:18.000 --> 00:24.000]  We are living in the most incredibly treacherous and dangerous time the world has ever seen.
[00:24.000 --> 00:32.000]  This is 21st century war between globalists and their CHICOM collaborators against the free world.
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to premiere a three-minute report that details that China
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  and the Communist Party that runs it has now fired a warning shot against their deep state collaborators
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  as Trump and patriots in our government and the American people close in on their operations.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  Here is the report.
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.000]  In the intelligence community, a limited hangout is the deliberate revelation of some information
[01:00.000 --> 01:07.000]  about malfeasance to try to confuse and or prevent discovery of other information.
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  In a recent Daily Mail article, the Communist Chinese admit after four years of denial
[01:13.000 --> 01:20.000]  that the COVID-19 virus resulted from work being done in the Wuhan Institute of Virology
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  and was paid for by the U.S. National Institute of Health,
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  run by none other than Anthony Fauci during the Obama administration.
[01:30.000 --> 01:37.000]  In the article, the CCP admits to harvesting their bats from a single cave in Yunnan, China,
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  thereby vindicating the work of Indian researchers who scanned its genome
[01:42.000 --> 01:50.000]  and found evidence that COVID-19 is a man-made hybrid, also known as a chimera virus.
[01:50.000 --> 01:59.000]  Controversy sparked in 2015 over the creation of a chimeric SARS-like virus at the University of North Carolina,
[01:59.000 --> 02:06.000]  and a moratorium was enacted to end gain of function research in the United States.
[02:06.000 --> 02:13.000]  Gain of function research involves genetically increasing the transmissibility of deadly pathogens.
[02:13.000 --> 02:20.000]  Immediately following this moratorium, the Obama administration and the National Institute of Health,
[02:20.000 --> 02:27.000]  under Dr. Anthony Fauci, outsourced the work to the Wuhan Virology Lab in China.
[02:27.000 --> 02:35.000]  The NIH awarded $3.7 million in research grants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  for gain of function coronavirus experimentation on bats.
[02:39.000 --> 02:46.000]  The Wuhan Institute lists the NIH as a partner, as well as the University of Alabama,
[02:46.000 --> 02:53.000]  the University of North Texas, Harvard University, and the National Wildlife Federation.
[02:53.000 --> 03:02.000]  The CCP still claims that it was an accident, suggesting that the innocent bat experiments may have gotten out of control,
[03:02.000 --> 03:13.000]  but the admission is that COVID-19 came from the Wuhan Laboratory, and it was paid for and directed by Anthony Fauci and the NIH.
[03:13.000 --> 03:23.000]  The very same Fauci, who is now suggesting extended lockdowns and mandatory vaccinations in the United States.
[03:23.000 --> 03:38.000]  As the world increasingly blames China for the COVID-19 virus, the CCP has fired a not-so-subtle warning shot across the bow of their American deep state accomplices.
[03:38.000 --> 03:46.000]  A massive war with China could potentially make all talk of deep state corruption vanish.
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  Reporting for infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  As I said before they cranked this up, I said the impeachment against Trump will fail, the removal will fail,
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  but they're going to launch something big, probably a bio attack or a physical war.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  They got almost no attention Saturday and Sunday when warships and fighter planes flew over Taiwan,
[04:07.000 --> 04:15.000]  and China officially said, in fact reprint me that article please, that they are preparing for military action against Taiwan.
[04:15.000 --> 04:21.000]  We are now in a new world war. It's economic, and it's with collaborators in our media and our government.
[04:21.000 --> 04:30.000]  I am beyond angry now. I am so disgusted that they're doing this, they're trying it, and it's so reckless, and it will lead to war.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  Mark my words, we're at war with China.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  I wouldn't be surprised if we don't launch nuclear attacks within March, or they launch attacks on us.
[04:40.000 --> 04:47.000]  It's on folks, and the left, like the Washington Post said, G.G. Ping needs to destroy Trump, that's the headline.
[04:47.000 --> 05:14.000]  No, it will be you who are destroyed. America is now fighting for its life, but we will win.
[05:17.000 --> 05:25.000]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance, so now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate,
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  and everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[05:28.000 --> 05:35.000]  So it's now that your credibility is way up. The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't.
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.000]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[05:40.000 --> 05:51.000]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech. We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[05:51.000 --> 06:15.000]  So be the polar bears you are.
[06:15.000 --> 06:31.000]  The war, the physical war, the economic war, began a long time ago between the globalists and their Chinese Communist cohorts against what's left of the West.
[06:31.000 --> 06:46.000]  And now it's entering the phase of explosive growth in the conflict by every measurement.
[06:46.000 --> 06:53.000]  I've worked as hard as I can to try to not have things to get to this point.
[06:53.000 --> 07:09.000]  But now they're here, and all of the America haters and Christian haters and God haters that signed on to the Hollywood, anti-America, anti-family, pro-Chicom, pro-EU, pro-pedophile agenda.
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  I hope you enjoy what is about to happen.
[07:15.000 --> 07:38.000]  The depression that's already been triggered by the deep state working with the Chinese Communist launching the COVID-19 bioattack and the ensuing stampede of scientifically directed hysteria has already guaranteed a global depression that is already set in across the planet.
[07:38.000 --> 07:54.000]  And what is an inconvenience for the average Nuvo-Riche Westerner is a death sentence to people in India, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.
[07:54.000 --> 08:11.000]  I have a stack of even the UN reports here admitting that billions are going into starvation and that millions will starve to death and millions are dying now because of the breakdown of the economy.
[08:11.000 --> 08:24.000]  More than half the world's population lives at a hand-to-mouth subsistence where close to half and in some cases 80% of their money goes to food.
[08:24.000 --> 08:35.000]  And so while everybody's getting into being scared of the virus, that is a weaponized cold virus and that is killing more than the flu does every year.
[08:35.000 --> 08:46.000]  It looks like a lot of the projections will be right, probably 80,000 or so this year, Mike Adams' original projection, dead.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  The hysteria is the real weapon and it will kill millions of people this year.
[08:51.000 --> 09:02.000]  And I'm going to later in the broadcast, last segment of this hour, read to you where the people are starving to death en masse because of this all over the world.
[09:02.000 --> 09:21.000]  And then the sick evil pope says that, oh, this is because it's nature's revenge for ignoring climate change and saying we need to cut our carbon, which would kill over a billion people in the next decade, the UN's models show.
[09:21.000 --> 09:31.000]  So the UN's running this global government, telling all the nation states what to do while they're the ones actually cutting the food off.
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  But even the daily beast and even Fauci have had to cover their bases.
[09:36.000 --> 09:54.000]  There was a very powerful clip coming up, bottom of the hour, where Bill Gates went on TV this weekend and said, oh, well, we'll have hundreds of thousands of people get sick and die from the vaccine because we're going to give it to every person on earth.
[09:54.000 --> 10:01.000]  And he admits that there will be side effects in young people, especially.
[10:01.000 --> 10:11.000]  And so he says we need governments to indemnify the companies that are bringing forth the vaccine, which are run by Bill and Melinda Gates.
[10:11.000 --> 10:23.000]  Boy, when they're even telling you like the drug commercials, hey, this drug can kill your ass, but it shows happy people dancing or whatever, while they say that, juxtaposing it, you know it's deadly.
[10:23.000 --> 10:32.000]  And he already patented it two years ago, the actual COVID-19 virus.
[10:32.000 --> 10:33.000]  It's the same.
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.000]  It's a chimera right out of China.
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.000]  That's even where they developed it.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  And now they've just got to put it in the vaccine and have the trials.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  That's how they hit the ground running.
[10:44.000 --> 11:05.000]  And this is a guy that openly says we need to vaccinate people to lower the world's population and that says kill old people, but now he really cares about them a lot because you see when you take the COVID-19 vaccine on average, it will lower your immunity according to all the studies of other similar vaccines, at least 50 percent.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  Look up flu vaccine lowers immunity to flu.
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  And that's why they now have studies that people that have been vaccinated don't live as long and die of the flu.
[11:16.000 --> 11:17.000]  That's in studies.
[11:17.000 --> 11:24.000]  That's why they're like, oh, actually, if you're old, you've been taking the flu vaccine too much and it's not effective.
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.000]  Stop it.
[11:25.000 --> 11:36.000]  It actually lets the flu kill you the next year because it covers that mutation.
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  But then it lowers your immunity to all the other flu is that's how it works.
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.000]  But if your body learns to beat something naturally, it boosts it against all of them.
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  And again, I've had medical doctors on to explain this.
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  We've had virologist on there's never been a flu vaccine that was picked.
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.000]  That was the right mutation for the next year.
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.000]  Never happen.
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  And that's why they never had one for the common cold because there's thousands of them every year.
[12:01.000 --> 12:12.000]  They're now that there's hundreds of COVID-19 versions.
[12:12.000 --> 12:20.000]  Now, there is a lot that we're going to be breaking down here today.
[12:20.000 --> 12:28.000]  But there's a report I want to go to that's very, very important that Greg Reese just put out that will be posted on infowars.com within minutes.
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  And this deals with the Communist Party China fires a warning shot directly at the globalist.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  Here it is.
[12:34.000 --> 12:48.000]  In the intelligence community, a limited hangout is the deliberate revelation of some information about malfeasance to try to confuse and or prevent discovery of other information.
[12:48.000 --> 13:12.000]  In a recent Daily Mail article, the Communist Chinese admit after four years of denial that the COVID-19 virus resulted from work being done in the Wuhan Institute of Virology and was paid for by the U.S. National Institute of Health run by none other than Anthony Fauci during the Obama administration.
[13:12.000 --> 13:32.000]  In the article, the CCP admits to harvesting their bats from a single cave in Yunnan, China, thereby vindicating the work of Indian researchers who scanned its genome and found evidence that COVID-19 is a man made hybrid, also known as a chimera virus.
[13:32.000 --> 13:48.000]  Controversy sparked in 2015 over the creation of a chimeric SARS-like virus at the University of North Carolina, and a moratorium was enacted to end gain of function research in the United States.
[13:48.000 --> 14:09.000]  Gain of function research involves genetically increasing the transmissibility of deadly pathogens. Immediately following this moratorium, the Obama administration and the National Institute of Health under Dr. Anthony Fauci outsourced the work to the Wuhan Virology Lab in China.
[14:09.000 --> 14:21.000]  The NIH awarded $3.7 million in research grants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for gain of function coronavirus experimentation on bats.

[14:35.000 --> 14:44.000]  The CCP still claims that it was an accident, suggesting that the innocent bat experiments may have gotten out of control.
[14:44.000 --> 14:55.000]  But the admission is that COVID-19 came from the Wuhan laboratory and it was paid for and directed by Anthony Fauci and the NIH.
[14:55.000 --> 15:05.000]  The very same Fauci, who is now suggesting extended lockdowns and mandatory vaccinations in the United States.

[15:20.000 --> 15:28.000]  A massive war with China could potentially make all talk of deep state corruption vanish.
[15:28.000 --> 15:55.000]  Reporting for infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.

[17:15.000 --> 17:21.000]  From China and Italy, it's that quarantines and enforced lockdowns are just a few days away here in the U.S.
[17:21.000 --> 17:29.000]  Listen, while dehydrated food is becoming scarce, you can still get enough open pollinated heirloom seeds to grow a one-acre crisis garden.
[17:29.000 --> 17:36.000]  The truth is, growing nutrient-dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single most important thing you do.
[17:36.000 --> 17:46.000]  Go to survivalseedbank.com and watch the new video to understand the nature of the threat. This could be life-saving. Lockdowns can last from six to eight weeks.

[18:17.000 --> 18:22.000]  They got fences around them with skull and crossbones on them for a reason. It says it can hurt you.
[18:22.000 --> 18:33.000]  So now with 5G that's even stronger, these systems are literally above the streets, just 20 or 30 feet from people's heads, from their genitals, from their bodies.
[18:33.000 --> 18:40.000]  People are burning them down and attacking them all over the world now. I'm saying don't do that. Use information warfare.
[18:40.000 --> 18:49.000]  Use the truth to expose it and sue local governments and others until they remove them. That's the way to deal with this, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:49.000 --> 18:56.000]  Take action in the information war, but I got to tell you, I can't blame the people that are doing it because they're under assault.
[18:56.000 --> 19:04.000]  One of our best-selling products is living defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[19:04.000 --> 19:10.000]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast, and I want those of you that haven't experienced living defense to get it for yourself.
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[19:12.000 --> 19:18.000]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital. I went to VA hospital out here in Boise, and I was in there until June.
[19:18.000 --> 19:27.000]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day, and I kept hearing Dr. Groob and all you guys talking about living defense.
[19:27.000 --> 19:35.000]  Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem, and I suffered with it for about five or six years, and the doctors, they tried every time.
[19:35.000 --> 19:43.000]  Nobody could figure out what it is. And then every day, when I kept hearing you and Dr. Groob and those commercials, I said, you know what, I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.000]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff, but I ordered it, had it shipped to me. I got it, I hid it from the nurses.
[19:49.000 --> 19:56.000]  I started taking it, man. That stuff changed my life. It saved my life. Alex Jones and info wars saved my life.
[19:56.000 --> 20:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.000 --> 20:30.000]  It's the third hour and Gerald Salente is in the fourth hour out of the war room with Owen Schroyer today.
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  You're on the info wars radio TV network.
[20:34.000 --> 20:43.000]  Three to six p.m. ahead of Robert Barnes doing America countdown dealing with the plan to implode the economy and bring global depression.
[20:43.000 --> 20:52.000]  Even J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs are saying if we're shut down more than four more weeks, depression is absolutely confirmed.
[20:52.000 --> 20:59.000]  Depression is already hitting in the third world. People are starving to death in mass. The U.N. estimates an extra two million people will starve to death this year.
[20:59.000 --> 21:06.000]  But it's worth it if it saves a couple hundred thousand people globally because it gives big tech surveillance powers.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  It gives big pharma medical tyranny powers. This is a giant takeover.
[21:11.000 --> 21:19.000]  So let me say this now and I'm going to elaborate on it next segment after I cover some of the news.
[21:19.000 --> 21:38.000]  This virus release we've always set on air for several decades is the globalist main takeover system because it gets every checkbox they need of locking things down, getting rid of cash,
[21:38.000 --> 21:52.000]  killing people, being able to lock up a restaurant where they want, being able to create total fear, being able to absolutely starve the third world and be able to force things into your body that then slowly debilitate you with binary weapons systems and kill you.
[21:52.000 --> 21:57.000]  And so it was easy to predict this would be their main assault. They said it would be their main assault.
[21:57.000 --> 22:11.000]  Even though every country isn't under globalist control like Russia or Iran or North Korea, they have their own corruption problems and evil problems and they like the power grab as well.
[22:11.000 --> 22:20.000]  And so the World Health Organization coordinates it. The Chai comms duplicate how you're supposed to behave. They set the precedent, the most evil regime in history.
[22:20.000 --> 22:28.000]  The media and others and universities and big corporations stampede Western governments into getting behind it.
[22:28.000 --> 22:39.000]  And then I told you 10 weeks ago, I said, watch, they'll say it's a permanent emergency and we'll never end. And they're going to have to cycle it on and off.
[22:39.000 --> 22:50.000]  And now JP Morgan's put out a cycling chart for the next two years and we'll get a vaccine within a year and it'll be forced. But if you're hurt, you'll be given a payment. Bill Gates is coming up saying that.
[22:50.000 --> 22:59.000]  So they know the UN came out two months ago, three months ago and said, we can't cover this up. Vaccines are killing people in mass and hurting them bad. Our own doctors know it's bad.
[22:59.000 --> 23:06.000]  So now there's going to go, you know what it does hurt you, but it's for a greater good and you will take it.
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  But that's a lie too. They released it. It doesn't protect you.
[23:11.000 --> 23:21.000]  And it's right here in the news that people that tested positive before now have it and people that tested negative now have it and people that and the tests don't work.
[23:21.000 --> 23:28.000]  And most of them are faulty and it picks up normal cold viruses and says it's Corona because it is Corona.
[23:28.000 --> 23:40.000]  It's like, is that a Jersey milk cow? Or is that a San Diego Trudish beef cow?
[23:40.000 --> 23:46.000]  It's a cow.
[23:46.000 --> 23:55.000]  And so there is no damn vaccine. It is only to lower your immunity. Bill Gates wants you dead. He's on record.
[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  And that's what's so crazy about this. You know, you notice we've obsessed over Bill Gates for 20 plus years and everybody goes, why do you do that?
[24:01.000 --> 24:12.000]  Why is he in your films? It's just a Microsoft guy. And I'm like, you watch, you'll one day be on TV telling you they're coming with force inoculations and microchips and world government.
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.000]  And now they are because he is the chief science officer.
[24:17.000 --> 24:23.000]  I'm not up here blowing smoke up your rear end, folks.
[24:23.000 --> 24:31.000]  Bill Gates doesn't finance TV shows attacking me and finance lawsuits against me because he likes me. I've got his damn number.
[24:31.000 --> 24:41.000]  You think I'd mess with somebody like that? Give it in true? He's a murderer. He's a psychotic James Bond villain.
[24:41.000 --> 24:55.000]  And I thought as Americans, we get pissed about somebody like that and do something about them. And I think we are.
[24:55.000 --> 25:05.000]  But this is a weapon system aimed at poor people to starve them. It is a bio weapon because it cuts the economy and the food off and they're going to die.
[25:05.000 --> 25:15.000]  Over two billion people are at starvation level. And Lord Monkton has done an excellent analysis of this and estimates that under the carbon taxes they wanted a billion would die in a decade.
[25:15.000 --> 25:21.000]  Well, now they're admitting this will end up killing billions of the global depression stays for a decade. It's going to kill hundreds of millions of people.
[25:21.000 --> 25:30.000]  Let's go to a very important special report that will come back. Let's go to the new normal will destroy America.
[25:30.000 --> 25:45.000]  The public is coming apart at the seams. A defiant paddle boarder found himself in over his head in hot water when sheriff's deputy surrounded him near Malibu Pier.
[25:45.000 --> 25:52.000]  Ain't breaking no law, ain't selling no drugs. I'm just preaching the word of God. And look at all these police car here.
[25:52.000 --> 26:00.000]  Get it off my f***ing leg.
[26:00.000 --> 26:20.000]  The sign at Donaldson Park says closed. But in smaller print says in groups of no more than four persons, parks remain open for walking, hiking, biking, running and similar activities.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.800]  Matt was just there with his wife and six-year-old.
[26:22.800 --> 26:26.800]  He says it was the officers who were violating social distancing guidelines.
[26:26.800 --> 26:31.800]  During this whole contact, you know, none of the officers had masks on, none of them had gloves on.
[26:31.800 --> 26:35.600]  You know, and they're in my face handcuffing me. They're touching me.
[26:35.600 --> 26:44.100]  I certainly don't think it's appropriate for a father to be handcuffed in front of his family.
[26:44.100 --> 26:47.900]  All in the name of a new normal which defies our inalienable rights
[26:47.900 --> 26:50.400]  and is plunging the U.S. into a recession.
[26:50.400 --> 26:56.000]  Once the facts are laid bare, couldn't those aggressively pushing for it be committing open treason?
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.300]  It's enough to make Attorney General Barr shudder at the long-term consequences.
[27:00.300 --> 27:10.300]  Generally speaking, there are occasions where liberties have to be restricted during certain emergencies such as war.
[27:10.300 --> 27:15.600]  Or, in this case, a potentially devastating pandemic.
[27:15.600 --> 27:21.900]  But they have to be balanced. Whatever steps you take have to be balanced against the civil liberties of the American people.
[27:21.900 --> 27:27.700]  And it cannot be used as an excuse for broad deprivations of liberty.
[27:27.700 --> 27:36.200]  So, as things proceed, you know, we're going to be interested in both what the federal government is imposing
[27:36.200 --> 27:40.900]  and also making sure that that's justified, but also what the states do.
[27:40.900 --> 27:47.800]  Once this is over, will we analyze the globalist Hail Mary pass to take out Trump and American economic success
[27:47.800 --> 27:50.500]  after all of the Russiagate impeachment nonsense?
[27:50.500 --> 27:56.900]  Or will we face a new wave of attacks as the Department of Homeland Security has eerily predicted?
[27:56.900 --> 28:01.500]  Politico reported the Department of Homeland Security has warned the faith-based community
[28:01.500 --> 28:07.500]  that the threat of attacks against houses of worship may be higher once religious services resume
[28:07.500 --> 28:11.500]  due to stressors caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
[28:11.500 --> 28:15.100]  Is this truly a threat? Or is it a threat against the First Amendment?
[28:15.100 --> 28:21.800]  And now, as all 50 states are under a major disaster declaration for the first time in U.S. history,
[28:21.800 --> 28:30.300]  the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President, Neil Keshkari, has declared that without an effective vaccine for the coronavirus,
[28:30.300 --> 28:34.600]  the U.S. economy could face 18 months of rolling shutdowns.
[28:34.600 --> 28:39.800]  Whether it's healthcare policy makers, fiscal policy makers, which means Congress or the Federal Reserve,
[28:39.800 --> 28:46.500]  we should all be erring on the side of overreacting to try to avoid the worst economic outcomes.
[28:46.500 --> 28:52.300]  As those in power now increase, that power, as elections, are put on hold.
[28:52.300 --> 28:56.000]  This new normal is merely the New World Order in sheep's clothing.
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.900]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[28:58.900 --> 29:01.900]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[29:01.900 --> 29:09.100]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.

[31:52.740 --> 31:56.660]  Get this special today at infohorsestore.com.
[31:56.660 --> 31:57.660]  It's Wednesday morning.
[31:57.660 --> 32:02.700]  I was just in a local Austin business that was basically empty and there were three motorcycle
[32:02.700 --> 32:03.700]  police in there.
[32:03.700 --> 32:07.580]  And I said, what do you think of this whole coronavirus thing?
[32:07.580 --> 32:10.380]  They're like, ah, it looks like it's a hoax.
[32:10.380 --> 32:12.700]  And I said, yeah, you're absolutely right.
[32:12.700 --> 32:16.060]  The way it's been handled is a hoax.
[32:16.060 --> 32:20.260]  Taking everybody that dies who happens to test positive, even though they die of a heart
[32:20.260 --> 32:25.380]  attack or cancer or diabetes, as dying from coronavirus is the big one.
[32:25.380 --> 32:29.700]  And then of course, they're also classifying everybody that test positive for coronavirus,
[32:29.700 --> 32:34.380]  period, not just COVID-19 as having it.
[32:34.380 --> 32:38.020]  So they're, they're upping a number of cases, they're upping a number of deaths, but still
[32:38.020 --> 32:43.700]  more people died this week and last week than died from the coronavirus from suicide.
[32:43.700 --> 32:48.140]  So if anything is causing divorces and suicide and stir craziness and basic insanity and
[32:48.140 --> 32:53.060]  a giant power grab with big pharma preparing a forced inoculation, which they even admit
[32:53.060 --> 33:01.580]  will not protect you from next year's mutation of the coronavirus, you're listening to the
[33:01.580 --> 33:17.620]  Alex Jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[33:17.620 --> 33:24.380]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[33:24.380 --> 33:32.100]  So I have studied the globalist and the eugenicist and their operations for 35 years.
[33:32.100 --> 33:37.820]  You kind of fell into it when I was a teenager researching it was so fascinating.
[33:37.820 --> 33:39.700]  I was always into comic books and science fiction.
[33:39.700 --> 33:44.460]  I was reading history books that were on the house about World War II, World War I, Ancient
[33:44.460 --> 33:49.980]  Rome, and I was like, wow, this is much better than fiction, truth is stranger.
[33:49.980 --> 33:54.620]  And so instead of being like a fake professor, you know, that gets a degree, studying one
[33:54.620 --> 33:58.100]  area, I studied a wide range of things.
[33:58.100 --> 34:03.780]  And so now watching the globalists launch their full assault, I mean, there's their
[34:03.780 --> 34:08.780]  takeover, their AI, anti-human takeover, their medical tyranny takeover, their wipe out the
[34:08.780 --> 34:18.140]  third world, a devastating weapons and seeing America flat footed and not knowing what's
[34:18.140 --> 34:25.340]  going on and seeing the Pentagon and the CIA and the president following suit with what
[34:25.340 --> 34:32.900]  we recommend six weeks after we do, quite frankly, freaks me out.
[34:32.900 --> 34:38.340]  Now it's not the Pentagon, the president doesn't know all this, but there in this echo chamber
[34:38.340 --> 34:41.100]  of globalist BS.
[34:41.100 --> 34:45.780]  And so just having something to ping back on that's saying exactly what they're in
[34:45.780 --> 34:48.660]  secret meetings saying, they're like, how does this guy know it?
[34:48.660 --> 34:50.300]  How do I know all this stuff?
[34:50.300 --> 34:56.660]  The damn new world order is out in the open naked as a J-bird.
[34:56.660 --> 35:01.060]  And so I don't even have a feeling of anger anymore and it's gone from anger to disgust
[35:01.060 --> 35:08.140]  to just sorrow, you know, if America is this pathetic, we don't care about 62 million babies
[35:08.140 --> 35:13.100]  and we think it's cool if the left says kill old people and don't take care of them.
[35:13.100 --> 35:21.060]  And we're this selfish of a society, then fine, just burn it all down.
[35:21.060 --> 35:23.460]  But I want Bill Gates and others to walk the plank first.
[35:23.460 --> 35:26.860]  Oh, I forgot about them.
[35:26.860 --> 35:32.260]  I mean, seriously, folks, if we would throw our birth right away and act like this and
[35:32.260 --> 35:37.140]  let people do things like this, I mean, look, all I have is honesty and I'll tell you what
[35:37.140 --> 35:38.860]  Trump should do.
[35:38.860 --> 35:44.940]  They've already arrested the head biologist for being a Chinese spy at Harvard and getting
[35:44.940 --> 35:49.340]  tens of millions of dollars secretly and running all these operations.
[35:49.340 --> 35:50.820]  What do you think Epstein did?
[35:50.820 --> 35:53.860]  What do you think Bill Gates does?
[35:53.860 --> 35:58.580]  What the hell is Microsoft doing running the Pentagon cloud?
[35:58.580 --> 36:06.580]  You're under attack by a foreign military with collaborators and it wasn't on the news
[36:06.580 --> 36:13.180]  in 1941, you know, when the Marines just went around in plain clothes killing all the Nazis
[36:13.180 --> 36:19.900]  and killing the collaborators and they'd come and say, we know you're working for the Nazis
[36:19.900 --> 36:22.380]  because you're in a German community.
[36:22.380 --> 36:24.420]  You're going to go help us and lead them to a spot.
[36:24.420 --> 36:27.420]  We're going to kill them in this barn or we're going to kill you.
[36:27.420 --> 36:28.580]  And we just killed them.
[36:28.580 --> 36:33.740]  It was only 10 or 15,000 we had to kill, took about a week, you know, you don't play games
[36:33.740 --> 36:35.240]  with this stuff.
[36:35.240 --> 36:37.020]  Kill the Chinese spies.
[36:37.020 --> 36:38.020]  Kill them now.
[36:38.020 --> 36:39.020]  I want them dead.
[36:39.020 --> 36:41.740]  No more games.
[36:41.740 --> 36:46.000]  I want Trump to issue death warrants now against all these people.
[36:46.000 --> 36:47.220]  I want them killed.
[36:47.220 --> 36:49.140]  I want them dead now.
[36:49.140 --> 36:52.180]  And that's not some big shoot my mouth off act tough thing.
[36:52.180 --> 36:54.420]  I'll bring them down on me for that, but I don't care.
[36:54.420 --> 36:59.100]  I will not sit here and watch this country gang raped and the planet gang raped.
[36:59.100 --> 37:02.900]  And more importantly, the giant third world populations that are going to die by the hundreds
[37:02.900 --> 37:04.700]  of millions in the global depression.
[37:04.700 --> 37:09.900]  It's all admitted the numbers while we bitching complain that some old people might die of
[37:09.900 --> 37:17.260]  a weaponized, uh, pneumonia, sorry, the chai comms with the deep state launched it.
[37:17.260 --> 37:19.740]  So there, that's why I've been pissed off.
[37:19.740 --> 37:26.020]  The Cruz has a lot of been so upset the few days because somebody's got to say it and
[37:26.020 --> 37:31.820]  tell it like it is that Harvard professor who's a chai comm agent doesn't get a trial.
[37:31.820 --> 37:32.940]  You know, here's the thing.
[37:32.940 --> 37:34.460]  We're not getting trials.
[37:34.460 --> 37:38.460]  America's having all its freedoms lost because we won't stand up to authoritarians and foreign
[37:38.460 --> 37:39.460]  governments.
[37:39.460 --> 37:43.900]  When your country is in war overrun on the edge of total collapse and these people hide
[37:43.900 --> 37:48.660]  behind due process, while they piss on ours and close our churches and engage in all
[37:48.660 --> 37:49.660]  this crap.
[37:49.660 --> 37:50.660]  It's BS.
[37:50.660 --> 38:00.420]  Now, I'm not going to kill anybody because that's not my job.
[38:00.420 --> 38:06.340]  I'm just saying when you sell bio weapons, sequencing systems and nanotech technology
[38:06.340 --> 38:17.980]  on how to deliver and gain a function to bio weapons, you get your neck broken so easy.
[38:17.980 --> 38:18.980]  That's what you do.
[38:18.980 --> 38:21.420]  You do not sit there and let this go on.
[38:21.420 --> 38:24.420]  Now, I'm not calling for anybody to kill this guy.
[38:24.420 --> 38:27.260]  We need to roll him up and find out who all the Chinese spies are.
[38:27.260 --> 38:31.660]  But China got pissed with their deep staters when Trump started rolling them up.
[38:31.660 --> 38:34.860]  So they got with the deep staters and said, All right, you gave us this weapon.
[38:34.860 --> 38:36.540]  You develop it with us that way.
[38:36.540 --> 38:37.540]  You won't blame us.
[38:37.540 --> 38:40.020]  You won't blame you.
[38:40.020 --> 38:43.020]  This is China having a discussion, you know, back in November, we don't have the votes
[38:43.020 --> 38:44.020]  to get rid of him.
[38:44.020 --> 38:47.460]  Go ahead and do the impeachment while we buy time while we incubate the virus.
[38:47.460 --> 38:48.460]  Keep your borders open.
[38:48.460 --> 38:51.140]  We'll order Chinese citizens that have it to go into your country.
[38:51.140 --> 38:54.740]  That's what was just huge waves coming in and leaving of rich Chinese.
[38:54.740 --> 38:59.740]  I saw it all over Austin, like the hell's all these rich, airing at Chinese with diamonds
[38:59.740 --> 39:04.860]  and all over Gucci bags and 200,000 dollar Mercedes laughing at people.
[39:04.860 --> 39:06.100]  They were bringing it in.
[39:06.100 --> 39:07.100]  They were releasing it.
[39:07.100 --> 39:10.700]  You've seen the videos of them touching all the laptops at Best Buy and wiping their feet
[39:10.700 --> 39:11.700]  with the mask.
[39:11.700 --> 39:14.780]  They shipped you, you know, just to take care and they ordered the first responders.
[39:14.780 --> 39:15.780]  Here, G.C.
[39:15.780 --> 39:16.780]  Ping brought you a mask.
[39:16.780 --> 39:21.260]  It's a bio attack, but they made an agreement with Obama and Hillary and those and Fauci
[39:21.260 --> 39:25.300]  that shipped them the weapons eight years ago and again, five years ago.
[39:25.300 --> 39:27.780]  It's all in record, by the way.
[39:27.780 --> 39:31.780]  And they said, we'll get Trump, we'll plunge the global economy, bring in the depopulation.
[39:31.780 --> 39:33.340]  We'll do it all right now.
[39:33.340 --> 39:39.060]  We'll worship G.C. Ping and communist China.
[39:39.060 --> 39:41.940]  And then we'll blame Trump and say it's his fault and the economy goes under.
[39:41.940 --> 39:44.420]  Why do we sit here and take this?
[39:44.420 --> 39:47.900]  Is this a new type of attack?
[39:47.900 --> 39:50.100]  Like aircraft carriers in World War II?
[39:50.100 --> 39:53.460]  We're supposed to be ahead of all of this stuff.
[39:53.460 --> 39:55.540]  All this you do is covert action.
[39:55.540 --> 39:56.540]  We don't have time.
[39:56.540 --> 40:02.060]  I mean, they'll do that with the Mexican mafia or MS-13 and give them an acid bath.
[40:02.060 --> 40:11.900]  Why aren't we taking the gloves off and sending in the army and the Marines to kill these
[40:11.900 --> 40:14.180]  people?
[40:14.180 --> 40:15.180]  Kill them.
[40:15.180 --> 40:16.180]  Kill them now.
[40:16.180 --> 40:19.580]  And again, it's just as simple.
[40:19.580 --> 40:22.900]  Why are we going to sit here and take bioattacks against our country?
[40:22.900 --> 40:27.820]  Why are we going to sit here and take an economic warfare attack with Democrats smiling like
[40:27.820 --> 40:32.180]  the Cheshire cat of what they just did to us and they're bragging how they were going
[40:32.180 --> 40:34.860]  to do it and they've been caught doing it.
[40:34.860 --> 40:36.500]  We don't need to disrupt the economy.
[40:36.500 --> 40:40.420]  We need to turn the fear off so that we'll take basic precautions, deal with the bioattack
[40:40.420 --> 40:44.780]  and not let the people that launched it at the NIH and Bill Gates and all of them get
[40:44.780 --> 40:46.220]  away with this.
[40:46.220 --> 40:51.700]  It's a coup against America.
[40:51.700 --> 40:55.940]  And they manipulated Trump with, oh, don't let Bezos, who's your enemy, get control of
[40:55.940 --> 40:57.340]  the clouds or the Pentagon.
[40:57.340 --> 40:58.340]  Let Gates.
[40:58.340 --> 40:59.940]  He's a good guy.
[40:59.940 --> 41:06.740]  They've been manipulating Trump into all of this.
[41:06.740 --> 41:11.940]  We're at war with Communist China, but Communist China is run by the globalist.
[41:11.940 --> 41:14.820]  And we are dealing with this right now.
[41:14.820 --> 41:17.780]  And it's not the American people's job to go out and be violent, because literally that's
[41:17.780 --> 41:18.780]  not your job.
[41:18.780 --> 41:24.540]  I'm telling the president and I'm telling the Pentagon, you keep letting the deep state
[41:24.540 --> 41:28.420]  do all this and they've endangered the whole planet and everything now and they intend
[41:28.420 --> 41:31.660]  to bring everything down and make hundreds of millions of people starve to death.
[41:31.660 --> 41:34.300]  Are you going to sit there and let this happen?
[41:34.300 --> 41:41.220]  Because I'm not a violent person offensively, but I feel ashamed that we're allowing this
[41:41.220 --> 41:42.220]  to happen.
[41:42.220 --> 41:45.100]  I feel like their blood is on my hands.
[41:45.100 --> 41:49.060]  And so my business is sticking my neck out there, okay?
[41:49.060 --> 41:51.900]  That's what I do.
[41:51.900 --> 41:53.420]  And I'm not worried about what happens to me.
[41:53.420 --> 41:56.300]  I'm really worried about what happens to all of you because we've really become a bunch
[41:56.300 --> 41:58.420]  of decadent candy asses.
[41:58.420 --> 42:01.900]  And the fact that the globalists would pull this thinking they're going to get away with
[42:01.900 --> 42:03.900]  it, they're not going to get away with this.
[42:03.900 --> 42:08.540]  I assure you, the decisions have already been made that the deep state's done and the globalists
[42:08.540 --> 42:09.540]  are done.
[42:09.540 --> 42:11.660]  But the globalists think they're going to kick our ass.
[42:11.660 --> 42:15.540]  So I'm going to tell the president again, you're in a fight for your life.
[42:15.540 --> 42:17.140]  I'm in a fight for my life.
[42:17.140 --> 42:18.380]  America is.
[42:18.380 --> 42:19.880]  No more games.
[42:19.880 --> 42:21.020]  They started it.
[42:21.020 --> 42:22.020]  They did it.
[42:22.020 --> 42:24.660]  We're in a hot war.
[42:24.660 --> 42:25.660]  Take Hollywood over.
[42:25.660 --> 42:27.580]  The Chicoms already did.
[42:27.580 --> 42:29.340]  Take the Federal Reserve over.
[42:29.340 --> 42:31.300]  The globalists have control of it.
[42:31.300 --> 42:33.780]  Take control of the country now and restore the Republic now.
[42:33.780 --> 42:36.900]  George Washington would have a stack of death warrants two feet tall.
[42:36.900 --> 42:37.900]  One.
[42:37.900 --> 42:42.900]  And then when he's done kicking ass, he goes back to the farm.
[42:42.900 --> 42:44.620]  That's what we want.
[42:44.620 --> 42:50.420]  So the president needs to do his job and launch covert direct action now.
[42:50.420 --> 42:51.740]  Kill the enemy.
[42:51.740 --> 42:52.740]  President Trump.
[42:52.740 --> 42:53.740]  Kill them.
[42:53.740 --> 42:59.740]  And I'm here to tell you, I don't need you to thank me and tell me I've done a good
[42:59.740 --> 43:00.740]  job.
[43:00.740 --> 43:01.740]  I've done nothing but my duty.
[43:01.740 --> 43:07.700]  I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum coming after innocent people, and I've been
[43:07.700 --> 43:13.220]  fighting them for 13 years, and I'll never stop while I'm growing breath.
[43:13.220 --> 43:21.260]  For 26 years, Alex Jones and Info Wars have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide,
[43:21.260 --> 43:24.820]  waking people up to the new world order.
[43:24.820 --> 43:25.820]  Bohemian Grove.
[43:25.820 --> 43:35.300]  The American deep state, the rise of communist China, the plan for global depopulation, and
[43:35.300 --> 43:40.180]  global elite pedophiles who prey off of our young.
[43:40.180 --> 43:46.740]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us, but because of your support, our fight continues.
[43:46.740 --> 43:47.740]  Join us.
[43:47.740 --> 43:51.860]  Support the Info War, and together, we will slay the dragon.
[43:51.860 --> 43:56.220]  Keep fighting, Alex, you're the gladiator.
[43:56.220 --> 44:01.380]  It's been sold out for more than four months, but our best-selling vitamin D3 and vitamin
[44:01.380 --> 44:05.700]  K formula is back in stock, Winter Sun.
[44:05.700 --> 44:09.260]  In the fall, in the winter, as you know, your body, when you're not getting sunlight on
[44:09.260 --> 44:12.940]  the skin, does not produce vitamin D3.
[44:12.940 --> 44:18.220]  So it's important to ingest it, but a lot of people do not absorb it well in the gut.
[44:18.220 --> 44:23.420]  So you take this formula under the tongue, it tastes sweet naturally, let it sit there
[44:23.420 --> 44:29.220]  about 30 seconds to a minute, and then you swallow the rest, and it's just amazing.
[44:29.220 --> 44:34.180]  It's back in stock, and yes, we're going to offer it a 50% off, because that's the right
[44:34.180 --> 44:37.780]  thing to do during this crisis, so Winter Sun, 50% off.

[44:46.980 --> 44:51.820]  even though it's going to sell out, super high quality birth iodine, it is 60% off,
[44:51.820 --> 44:54.820]  because I want you to have it right now, infowarstore.com.
[44:54.820 --> 45:02.780]  Do yourself a favor and fund the info war at the same time.

[45:07.540 --> 45:11.860]  walnut and others that are in this baby, and then read some of those reviews for yourself.
[45:11.860 --> 45:15.860]  And then don't just believe in info wars, go out online at major nutrition sites and
[45:15.860 --> 45:18.460]  others, and look at the studies for yourself.
[45:18.460 --> 45:22.380]  Go out and engage in your First Amendment right to research, and then your First Amendment
[45:22.380 --> 45:27.580]  right to tell others about the incredible compounds God has given us from other nature.
[45:27.580 --> 45:32.700]  Living Defense is at infowarstore.com, sold out for four months, now back in stock for
[45:32.700 --> 45:35.380]  a limited time at 40% off.
[45:35.380 --> 45:40.260]  People are doing their own research and they're getting Living Defense at 40% off at infowarstore.com.
[45:40.260 --> 45:44.260]  And we've got our great super blue toothpaste, the best seller for five years with the nano
[45:44.260 --> 45:48.740]  silver, the tea tree, and the iodine, it's selling out still 50% off, and the iodine
[45:48.740 --> 45:57.580]  is selling out, the X3, it's 60% off because I want you to experience how amazing it is.
[45:57.580 --> 46:02.260]  BioPQQ, research that, look into it for yourself.
[46:02.260 --> 46:04.820]  Big brother and the globalist don't want you to.
[46:04.820 --> 46:10.100]  CoQ10, oh, you probably want to spend some time researching CoQ10, and then research
[46:10.100 --> 46:17.580]  DNA Force Plus, and the types that we have in here, the very best forms of BQQ and CoQ10,
[46:17.580 --> 46:25.300]  and then a whole bunch of other natural ingredients from other nature that are known to supercharge
[46:25.300 --> 46:26.300]  it all.
[46:26.300 --> 46:32.100]  This is our best selling overall formula, and I've told listeners at the end of last
[46:32.100 --> 46:37.540]  year that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup
[46:37.540 --> 46:42.140]  in them to fund our operations, but because of what's happening and going on in the world
[46:42.140 --> 46:48.620]  right now, I really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of
[46:48.620 --> 46:53.260]  DNA Force Plus to have DNA Force Plus for yourself and your family.
[46:53.260 --> 47:09.900]  The DNA Force Plus now 50% off.
[47:09.900 --> 47:15.660]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[47:15.660 --> 47:17.780]  You want to stop tyranny?
[47:17.780 --> 47:19.820]  Well, so does he.
[47:19.820 --> 47:26.340]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:26.340 --> 47:33.700]  By the way, all I said last segment is that when your country is under attack by powerful
[47:33.700 --> 47:40.500]  multinational acts of survival, and they're using the openness and freedom of your society
[47:40.500 --> 47:44.060]  against you, it's a military power.
[47:44.060 --> 47:47.660]  Their enemy combatants take the gloves off, and the president has to start thinking like
[47:47.660 --> 47:54.300]  that and not worry about the Democrats, who are Chinese spies on average, about 90% of
[47:54.300 --> 47:56.940]  the time, on record.
[47:56.940 --> 47:58.460]  Stop worrying about what they say and do.
[47:58.460 --> 48:03.180]  You cut off the Chinese agents, you arrest the collaborators, the foreign operatives that
[48:03.180 --> 48:04.180]  are here.
[48:04.180 --> 48:09.220]  I mean, the Chinese kill our operatives in China, we don't have anything over there.
[48:09.220 --> 48:11.980]  We are a joke, so we're treated like it.
[48:11.980 --> 48:16.740]  And so now they've launched a damn bio attack on us with the deep state to remove the president,
[48:16.740 --> 48:18.620]  and people loyal in the government.
[48:18.620 --> 48:21.980]  Everybody's like, man, that's a radical statement.
[48:21.980 --> 48:25.300]  That's where we are.
[48:25.300 --> 48:27.860]  When you're fighting for your life, you're fighting for your life.
[48:27.860 --> 48:31.820]  This is just, let me show you the type of stuff here on the stack, because I look at
[48:31.820 --> 48:32.820]  all this before we go on air.
[48:32.820 --> 48:38.700]  I don't just put this out every day to act like I'm looking at it, look at this.
[48:38.700 --> 48:41.580]  China announces plan to invade Taiwan.
[48:41.580 --> 48:45.700]  Concern grows over China's invasion threat.
[48:45.700 --> 48:49.140]  Taiwan says Chinese carrier drills close to Ireland.
[48:49.140 --> 48:51.700]  China says aircraft carrier Japan.
[48:51.700 --> 48:53.980]  Taiwan as U.S. Navy struggles with coronavirus.
[48:53.980 --> 48:58.020]  Oh, give me a break, they're not struggling, they're just, oh my God, 50 people on the
[48:58.020 --> 48:59.020]  ship have it.
[48:59.020 --> 49:00.020]  One guy's real sick.
[49:00.020 --> 49:03.420]  I mean, they didn't even get to wear pink underwear.
[49:03.420 --> 49:05.420]  I mean, it's just, there's many.
[49:05.420 --> 49:11.380]  You know, China has giant death camps, the left's like, oh, we love death camps.
[49:11.380 --> 49:14.460]  Don't talk about being mean to Chinese agents in the U.S.
[49:14.460 --> 49:19.340]  Give them, give them bubblegum to chew, pack them on the head.
[49:19.340 --> 49:25.740]  Taiwan scrambles warships as PLA Navy aircraft carrier strike group heads for the Pacific.
[49:25.740 --> 49:31.100]  And China says, the headline was Saturday, we are now in a physical military posture
[49:31.100 --> 49:35.860]  and are preparing for the invasion of Taiwan, and it's hardly in the news.
[49:35.860 --> 49:47.180]  Imagine if Trump said he was getting ready to invade, you know, Cuba.
[49:47.180 --> 49:53.020]  China released the bio weapon in conjunction with the deep state to shut down Taiwan, to
[49:53.020 --> 49:56.900]  shut down their political enemies, and then to direct it against the West.
[49:56.900 --> 50:01.340]  And they've been, and the UN and the whole media has been concerted, and the Washington
[50:01.340 --> 50:11.940]  Post had the headline, Gigi Ping needs to destroy Trump.
[50:11.940 --> 50:15.140]  You know, the Nazis had a big cult in America before World War II.
[50:15.140 --> 50:20.620]  They had some national polls that showed up to half of America, supported them.
[50:20.620 --> 50:27.540]  Because our media told us they were good guys because the robber barons were supporting
[50:27.540 --> 50:35.140]  Herr Hitler, Henry Ford, the list goes on and on.
[50:35.140 --> 50:42.180]  There's the Washington Post, Gigi's choice, destroy Trump, or save him and weaken America.
[50:42.180 --> 50:49.380]  That's the sick of freakazoids we have in our government, in our media.
[50:49.380 --> 50:55.500]  And then you've got the Harvard chemistry chairman charged for working with the Chai
[50:55.500 --> 51:02.340]  Coms, and again, these guys were told by the Council on Foreign Relations that that was
[51:02.340 --> 51:04.060]  their job to transfer to China.
[51:04.060 --> 51:06.020]  That's how they were going to defeat America militarily.
[51:06.020 --> 51:08.060]  This was a globalist takeover plot.
[51:08.060 --> 51:10.900]  And I'm saying we're fighting for our lives.
[51:10.900 --> 51:14.660]  So you might want to take the gloves off, at least fight with fists when your enemy's
[51:14.660 --> 51:17.780]  got a machine gun and a dagger in the other hand.
[51:17.780 --> 51:19.460]  They got a machine gun and a dagger.
[51:19.460 --> 51:23.260]  They're doing all this, and we're just sitting there going, oh, can I fight you with a powder
[51:23.260 --> 51:25.820]  puff?
[51:25.820 --> 51:27.820]  I'm the guy that tried to stop the globalist takeover.
[51:27.820 --> 51:30.620]  I'm the guy that tried to stop the police state, because I knew if the globalists got
[51:30.620 --> 51:32.900]  control of America, they'd use the police against us.
[51:32.900 --> 51:36.740]  But we have a fighting chance now, and on average, the police, at least in our country,
[51:36.740 --> 51:40.100]  understand what's going on.
[51:40.100 --> 51:41.460]  And the globalists want a civil war.
[51:41.460 --> 51:44.940]  You go, well, they come for the guns and keep things locked down, and there's a depression,
[51:44.940 --> 51:46.620]  and there'll be a civil war.
[51:46.620 --> 51:48.220]  Not if there's an invisible enemy.
[51:48.220 --> 51:49.580]  That turns the people against each other.
[51:49.580 --> 51:50.580]  This has all been war game.
[51:50.580 --> 51:51.700]  It's all been prepared.
[51:51.700 --> 51:55.140]  There's one thing that stops them dead in their tracks.
[51:55.140 --> 51:58.820]  That's Trump coming out like he did last week and saying, World Health Organization has been
[51:58.820 --> 52:00.700]  put in charge by the Chinese.
[52:00.700 --> 52:02.460]  They got their own director in for a decade.
[52:02.460 --> 52:03.940]  He put all his people in.
[52:03.940 --> 52:04.940]  They control it.
[52:04.940 --> 52:06.020]  They bought it off.
[52:06.020 --> 52:07.020]  It's a fraud.
[52:07.020 --> 52:09.340]  They don't direct our response.
[52:09.340 --> 52:11.260]  America's not scared.
[52:11.260 --> 52:12.340]  This killed a million people.
[52:12.340 --> 52:13.340]  We can handle it.
[52:13.340 --> 52:17.060]  We'll take basic precautions, but not shut down our farms, not shut down our factories.
[52:17.060 --> 52:21.860]  We'd show the numbers that a half billion just went into poverty, another two billion
[52:21.860 --> 52:26.540]  or almost death rate, and they had predicted millions will starve to death this year, the
[52:26.540 --> 52:27.540]  UN's own documents.
[52:27.540 --> 52:31.140]  I'll show you the next hour.
[52:31.140 --> 52:37.380]  And we're just going to let the third world starve to death and all this because the virus
[52:37.380 --> 52:43.780]  and the media, and then don't forget the big news story, the Communist Chinese came out
[52:43.780 --> 52:49.340]  this weekend and said, OK, probably didn't come out of that market, OK, the US government
[52:49.340 --> 52:51.780]  under Fauci and Obama gave us the virus.
[52:51.780 --> 52:54.460]  It's just like we told you nine weeks ago.
[52:54.460 --> 52:56.900]  And leave us alone.
[52:56.900 --> 52:58.340]  Don't blame us because we'll blame you.
[52:58.340 --> 52:59.340]  We'll forget.
[52:59.340 --> 53:00.340]  Good.
[53:00.340 --> 53:01.340]  Expose Fauci.
[53:01.340 --> 53:02.340]  Expose Obama.
[53:02.340 --> 53:06.540]  But see how they've got the guy right there next to Trump who comes out and keeps saying
[53:06.540 --> 53:07.540]  Trump's a liar.
[53:07.540 --> 53:10.180]  Let's play these clips right now.
[53:10.180 --> 53:13.940]  Here's Fauci.
[53:13.940 --> 53:16.260]  US has more coronavirus deaths than any other country.
[53:16.260 --> 53:19.380]  The answer is they do more tests than anybody else than they always say we're not doing
[53:19.380 --> 53:20.380]  enough tests.
[53:20.380 --> 53:21.380]  Here's clip five.
[53:21.380 --> 53:24.980]  Fauci blames Trump for not responding to coronavirus in February.
[53:24.980 --> 53:26.620]  This is from a few days ago.
[53:26.620 --> 53:32.140]  But here he is back in February, what he said, advising the president to stand down.
[53:32.140 --> 53:34.180]  Oh, don't stop the Chinese coming in.
[53:34.180 --> 53:36.180]  Don't stop the flights or everything's fine.
[53:36.180 --> 53:38.020]  But he thinks you don't have a memory.
[53:38.020 --> 53:43.300]  Now he says the opposite, here is the man, the globalist agent, the man behind the HIV.
[53:43.300 --> 53:46.140]  It was so much an actual devil incarnate.
[53:46.140 --> 53:49.140]  Here's Fauci blames Trump for not responding to coronavirus in February.
[53:49.140 --> 53:50.620]  Here he is.
[53:50.620 --> 53:55.180]  The New York Times reported yesterday that you and other top officials wanted to recommend
[53:55.180 --> 53:59.620]  social and physical distancing guidelines to President Trump as far back as the third
[53:59.620 --> 54:01.060]  week of February.
[54:01.060 --> 54:05.220]  But the administration didn't announce such guidelines to the American public until March
[54:05.220 --> 54:07.620]  16th, almost a month later.
[54:07.620 --> 54:08.620]  Why?
[54:08.620 --> 54:15.420]  You know, Jake, as I've said many times, we look at it from a pure health standpoint.
[54:15.420 --> 54:20.540]  We make a recommendation, often the recommendation is taken, sometimes it's not.
[54:20.540 --> 54:21.900]  But it is what it is.
[54:21.900 --> 54:23.140]  We are where we are right now.
[54:23.140 --> 54:25.260]  It is what it is, you little piece of crap.
[54:25.260 --> 54:28.580]  You advise the president not even to stop the Chinese flying in on record.
[54:28.580 --> 54:31.540]  You little monster, you little goblin.
[54:31.540 --> 54:38.380]  Let's go ahead and play what he actually said back then.
[54:38.380 --> 54:40.460]  So Dr. Fauci, it's Saturday morning in America.
[54:40.460 --> 54:42.980]  People are waking up right now with real concerns about this.
[54:42.980 --> 54:46.740]  They want to go to malls and movies, maybe the gym as well.
[54:46.740 --> 54:48.060]  Should we be changing our habits?
[54:48.060 --> 54:49.060]  And if so, how?
[54:49.060 --> 54:53.980]  No, right now, at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you're doing
[54:53.980 --> 54:56.180]  on a day by day basis.
[54:56.180 --> 54:58.740]  Right now, the risk is still low, but this could change.
[54:58.740 --> 55:04.220]  I've said that many times, even on this program, you've got to watch out because although the
[55:04.220 --> 55:08.540]  risk is low now, you don't need to change anything you're doing.
[55:08.540 --> 55:14.180]  When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much
[55:14.180 --> 55:18.300]  more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.
[55:18.300 --> 55:21.820]  That's why he was busy flying the thousands in, making sure they didn't get tested, making
[55:21.820 --> 55:25.900]  sure it spread well, because he works for the UN, the globalist Bill Gates, Rockefeller
[55:25.900 --> 55:30.700]  set up Mao Zedong, so that they had, she do this, but she said, okay, give me a weapon,
[55:30.700 --> 55:32.620]  so we both have it, so I got it from you.
[55:32.620 --> 55:38.300]  So when I use it in the future for a global government power grab, you don't blame us.
[55:38.300 --> 55:40.900]  Well, Trump starts blaming them because he got into power.
[55:40.900 --> 55:45.580]  They're like, oh, we got this from Fauci.
[55:45.580 --> 55:49.020]  Just like I told Trump, go after Comey, just like I told him, go after all these guys,
[55:49.020 --> 55:52.180]  you have to go after him, just destroy him in public, get him up there next to you, don't
[55:52.180 --> 55:54.780]  even tell him, and then they start going, by the way, I'm having you arrested for being
[55:54.780 --> 55:55.780]  a Chinese spy.
[55:55.780 --> 55:56.780]  They're like a little piece of crap.
[55:56.780 --> 56:02.140]  Just, they'll all run, just like rats, but instead, we just rope a dope and go through
[56:02.140 --> 56:03.940]  this whole thing.
[56:03.940 --> 56:04.940]  It's unbelievable.
[56:04.940 --> 56:05.940]  Arrest Fauci.
[56:05.940 --> 56:11.940]  Don't fire Fauci, like Ron Paul saying, arrest him for crimes against humanity, and call
[56:11.940 --> 56:14.300]  for the indictment of Obama and all of them for what they've done.
[56:14.300 --> 56:18.580]  They're on record, and I'll cover that next hour as well, and show you Bill Gates saying,
[56:18.580 --> 56:19.740]  we need liability protection.
[56:19.740 --> 56:24.420]  The vaccine is going to kill a lot of people, but we need liability protection, so they're
[56:24.420 --> 56:26.420]  getting you ready because this is going to be out.
[56:26.420 --> 56:29.740]  Just like Gardasil killed a bunch of people and sterilized them, you're going to love
[56:29.740 --> 56:30.740]  this one.
[56:30.740 --> 56:35.380]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, with all the craziness going on, I suspect the Globals
[56:35.380 --> 56:38.300]  will probably launch another bio attack, even worse than this, because we've bowed down
[56:38.300 --> 56:43.140]  so well to this, just on this low-level one, who knows what's going to happen.
[56:43.140 --> 56:46.860]  I personally am doing everything I can to boost my body's defenses, and it funds the
[56:46.860 --> 56:47.860]  Info War.
[56:47.860 --> 56:52.220]  Get Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, still 50% off at InfoWareShore.com with a zinc, the
[56:52.220 --> 56:54.620]  Preglone, everything else you need, it's amazing.
[56:54.620 --> 56:58.500]  We also have Winter Sun Plus with Vitamin K now.
[56:58.500 --> 56:59.500]  That's the mix.
[56:59.500 --> 57:02.260]  They're saying, you know, Vitamin D3, and Vitamin K is so good for your body, so good
[57:02.260 --> 57:04.100]  for your natural defenses.
[57:04.100 --> 57:07.540]  We have that 50% off, even though it's been sold out for four months, back in stock, and
[57:07.540 --> 57:11.420]  we have X3, very close, as I've been telling you, for selling out, won't be back in for
[57:11.420 --> 57:12.420]  months.
[57:12.420 --> 57:16.500]  Well, the Tri-Iodine, the Deep-Rothed Crystal Iodine, two other types, I told you, the scientists
[57:16.500 --> 57:17.500]  told me, come out with that.
[57:17.500 --> 57:18.500]  It's even better.
[57:18.500 --> 57:22.940]  You know, that MIT doctor had on saying the Tri-Iodine's the way to go.
[57:22.940 --> 57:27.900]  Well, we've got it, InfoWareShore.com, and that purchase funds the operation, so please
[57:27.900 --> 57:28.900]  take action today.
[57:28.900 --> 57:32.620]  But whatever you do, get prepared, by the way, we have swarable food again, now it's only
[57:32.620 --> 57:35.940]  six weeks for delivery, but all over the rest of the country, you even hear them saying
[57:35.940 --> 57:36.940]  food shortages.
[57:36.940 --> 57:40.260]  So get swarable food at InfoWareShore.com, and you get it for like five times cheaper
[57:40.260 --> 57:41.260]  than the grocery store.
[57:41.260 --> 57:45.820]  Well, they're right back, stay with us.
[57:45.820 --> 57:52.820]  Scientists predicted the human rebellion against globalist machines has begun.
[57:52.820 --> 57:58.380]  The LA Times, The Washington Post, Wired Magazine all reported years ago that major studies
[57:58.380 --> 58:02.860]  show 5G caused increased cancer in rats.
[58:02.860 --> 58:03.860]  It's a fact.
[58:03.860 --> 58:09.460]  5G is just a later generation of systems that are on record for more than 70 years to cause
[58:09.460 --> 58:10.460]  cancer.
[58:10.460 --> 58:13.500]  They rub the DNA molecules together.
[58:13.500 --> 58:16.060]  They are microwaves.
[58:16.060 --> 58:21.580]  Well now, YouTube has admitted to the BBC and others that they're banning anyone criticizing
[58:21.580 --> 58:26.060]  5G, even if you don't connect to coronavirus, they're banning it.
[58:26.060 --> 58:30.940]  But the studies do show that 5G lowers your immunity to viruses, period.
[58:30.940 --> 58:32.820]  There are peer-reviewed journals.
[58:32.820 --> 58:36.700]  We're showing these documents on air, and the globalists can go to hell.
[58:36.700 --> 58:40.020]  The human rebellion against globalist machines has begun.
[58:40.020 --> 58:42.220]  We're not troglodytes afraid of technology.
[58:42.220 --> 58:47.660]  We don't like technology with Trojan Wars anti-human crap in it.
[58:47.660 --> 58:54.340]  When one studies history and human nature, you learn very quickly that rugged individualism
[58:54.340 --> 59:00.100]  and people to think for themselves, build free societies, innovate to amazing things,
[59:00.100 --> 59:05.700]  but those that love to grovel, those that love to be subservient, those that love to
[59:05.700 --> 59:08.420]  comply, I think that it's a virtue.
[59:08.420 --> 59:14.980]  They create stagnation, corruption, tyranny, and then finally collapse.
[59:14.980 --> 59:17.860]  And the world is now being tested.
[59:17.860 --> 59:22.740]  And we're seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole
[59:22.740 --> 59:28.740]  lives believing if they just submit now in a bigger way, somehow they'll create a heavenly
[59:28.740 --> 59:29.740]  future.
[59:29.740 --> 59:37.740]  But the technocrats running the global system are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic.
[59:37.740 --> 59:41.180]  And are building an anti-human future.
[59:41.180 --> 59:49.860]  Submission to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[59:49.860 --> 1:00:03.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:03.300 --> 1:00:08.820]  As you know, I rarely air something twice in the same show, but I never air something
[1:00:08.820 --> 1:00:09.820]  three times.
[1:00:09.820 --> 1:00:13.580]  And we're only an hour and one minute into the transmission and I'm about to air this
[1:00:13.580 --> 1:00:14.580]  for a third time.
[1:00:14.580 --> 1:00:18.300]  Then I'm going to come back and dutifully just report to the American people and the
[1:00:18.300 --> 1:00:26.780]  president in very concise packages what is going on and what's coming next in my perspective,
[1:00:26.780 --> 1:00:28.420]  which I really wish wasn't so that on.
[1:00:28.420 --> 1:00:32.740]  It's my marriage, actually, but it's very clear when you sit here and immerse yourself
[1:00:32.740 --> 1:00:38.300]  constantly in this and don't pretend to do research and actually live it.
[1:00:38.300 --> 1:00:52.500]  I've never dreamed all night long for eight hours about problems and about how to deal
[1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:53.500]  with things.
[1:00:53.500 --> 1:00:59.420]  And it was vivid waking dreams, researching all this to get on air today and do a good
[1:00:59.420 --> 1:01:01.700]  job breaking it down.
[1:01:01.700 --> 1:01:02.700]  That's how serious all this is.
[1:01:02.700 --> 1:01:05.980]  I mean, I might have a few dreams where I'm working on things, but now it was all night
[1:01:05.980 --> 1:01:11.580]  like I was in a classroom, like I was just absolutely just breaking my mind trying to
[1:01:11.580 --> 1:01:16.500]  just warn people on how serious this is and how incredible it is and what's going to happen
[1:01:16.500 --> 1:01:17.500]  if we don't stand up.
[1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:22.140]  So we're going to air this special report that's on info wars.com, Communist Party China fires
[1:01:22.140 --> 1:01:26.780]  a warning shot at their deep state collaborators that must go viral, must be sent to the White
[1:01:26.780 --> 1:01:27.780]  House.
[1:01:27.780 --> 1:01:31.380]  You want to stop the globalist and get this intel to every member of Congress, every talk
[1:01:31.380 --> 1:01:37.980]  show host you know, it's on Band-Aid video as well, here it is.
[1:01:37.980 --> 1:01:44.340]  In the intelligence community, a limited hangout is the deliberate revelation of some information
[1:01:44.340 --> 1:01:51.340]  about malfeasance to try to confuse and or prevent discovery of other information.
[1:01:51.340 --> 1:01:57.660]  In a recent Daily Mail article, the Communist Chinese admit after four years of denial that
[1:01:57.660 --> 1:02:04.940]  the COVID-19 virus resulted from work being done in the Wuhan Institute of Virology and
[1:02:04.940 --> 1:02:11.380]  was paid for by the U.S. National Institute of Health, run by none other than Anthony
[1:02:11.380 --> 1:02:15.140]  Fauci during the Obama administration.
[1:02:15.140 --> 1:02:21.580]  In the article, the CCP admits to harvesting their bats from a single cave in Yunnan, China,
[1:02:21.580 --> 1:02:27.580]  thereby vindicating the work of Indian researchers who scanned its genome and found evidence
[1:02:27.580 --> 1:02:35.300]  that COVID-19 is a man-made hybrid, also known as a chimera virus.
[1:02:35.300 --> 1:02:41.820]  Controversy sparked in 2015 over the creation of a chimeric SARS-like virus at the University
[1:02:41.820 --> 1:02:48.860]  of North Carolina, and a moratorium was enacted to end gain of function research in the United
[1:02:48.860 --> 1:02:50.860]  States.
[1:02:50.860 --> 1:02:56.540]  Gain of function research involves genetically increasing the transmissibility of deadly
[1:02:56.540 --> 1:02:58.260]  pathogens.
[1:02:58.260 --> 1:03:04.060]  Immediately following this moratorium, the Obama administration and the National Institute
[1:03:04.060 --> 1:03:11.820]  of Health under Dr. Anthony Fauci outsourced the work to the Wuhan Virology Lab in China.
[1:03:11.820 --> 1:03:19.900]  The NIH awarded $3.7 million in research grants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for gain
[1:03:19.900 --> 1:03:24.180]  of function coronavirus experimentation on bats.
[1:03:24.180 --> 1:03:30.660]  The Wuhan Institute lists the NIH as a partner, as well as the University of Alabama, the
[1:03:30.660 --> 1:03:37.900]  University of North Texas, Harvard University, and the National Wildlife Federation.
[1:03:37.900 --> 1:03:44.700]  The CCP still claims that it was an accident, suggesting that the innocent bat experiments
[1:03:44.700 --> 1:03:52.260]  may have gotten out of control, but the admission is that COVID-19 came from the Wuhan Laboratory
[1:03:52.260 --> 1:03:59.540]  and it was paid for and directed by Anthony Fauci and the NIH, the very same Fauci who
[1:03:59.540 --> 1:04:07.700]  is now suggesting extended lockdowns and mandatory vaccinations in the United States.
[1:04:07.700 --> 1:04:16.300]  As the world increasingly blames China for the COVID-19 virus, the CCP has fired a not-so-subtle
[1:04:16.300 --> 1:04:22.660]  warning shot across the bow of their American deep state accomplices.
[1:04:22.660 --> 1:04:31.060]  A massive war with China could potentially make all talk of deep state corruption vanish.
[1:04:31.060 --> 1:04:42.660]  Reporting for Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[1:04:42.660 --> 1:04:54.620]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:04:54.620 --> 1:04:59.620]  I don't need to remind you how 4 years ago I told you the polls against Trump were fake.
[1:04:59.620 --> 1:05:04.900]  He was winning by a giant margin, but election fraud almost stole the election from Trump
[1:05:04.900 --> 1:05:05.900]  and the American people.
[1:05:05.900 --> 1:05:12.620]  Well, now they're pushing the idea that, oh, cancel the Republican-Democrat conventions,
[1:05:12.620 --> 1:05:16.460]  maybe cancel the election a year like the Olympics.
[1:05:16.460 --> 1:05:22.300]  That's because they know Trump in every internal scientific poll is 20 points ahead of the
[1:05:22.300 --> 1:05:23.940]  brain damage by...
[1:05:23.940 --> 1:05:28.900]  So they can say, sir, you look big like the Olympics, go back off a year and then you'll
[1:05:28.900 --> 1:05:31.620]  still win in a year after you fix the crisis, no.
[1:05:31.620 --> 1:05:36.620]  They need more time to cook up an assassination and economic collapse, a new virus.
[1:05:36.620 --> 1:05:40.980]  Trump needs to say, no, in America we keep elections on time, have the elections, win
[1:05:40.980 --> 1:05:44.500]  by a landslide, and not give the globalists what they want.
[1:05:44.500 --> 1:05:48.980]  Hillary, Biden, they all want us to spend the election, we shouldn't give them what
[1:05:48.980 --> 1:05:49.980]  they want.
[1:05:49.980 --> 1:06:19.260]  We need to have a vote in America and reelect Trump 2020.
[1:06:19.260 --> 1:06:23.420]  The globalists and their CHICOM cohorts and their Hollywood allies have been trying to
[1:06:23.420 --> 1:06:26.180]  crash the economy for the last three and a half years.
[1:06:26.180 --> 1:06:31.020]  They've been trying to remove President Trump with hoax after hoax, but that didn't work.
[1:06:31.020 --> 1:06:37.700]  They launched the UN's Pride, the ZX, which they said would bring in the world government,
[1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:41.980]  and they're so arrogant and so evil, like master villains are, just like in cartoons
[1:06:41.980 --> 1:06:46.540]  or movies, they brag and all these white papers and books, how they do it.
[1:06:46.540 --> 1:06:51.540]  That's how we have all these documentaries and reports and films at band.video that are
[1:06:51.540 --> 1:06:52.540]  going viral.
[1:06:52.540 --> 1:06:57.900]  You know, we're talking the average video now we put out on this has like 500,000 views
[1:06:57.900 --> 1:07:02.820]  on our own third party platform, unheard of, a lot of them have over a million, they're
[1:07:02.820 --> 1:07:06.940]  being copied everywhere, and believe me, they're being watched at the Pentagon, they're being
[1:07:06.940 --> 1:07:10.500]  watched at 10 down the street because they're like, how does Jones know this?
[1:07:10.500 --> 1:07:14.300]  It's not like I'm even telling them stuff they really don't know, it's just unheard
[1:07:14.300 --> 1:07:16.860]  of to have this on air.
[1:07:16.860 --> 1:07:19.300]  That's why you saw three weeks ago, 10 down the street came out and said, okay, it looks
[1:07:19.300 --> 1:07:21.140]  like it's a bio weapon.
[1:07:21.140 --> 1:07:23.860]  Looks like certain elements in the West worked with them to release this to bring down the
[1:07:23.860 --> 1:07:24.860]  economy.
[1:07:24.860 --> 1:07:27.620]  China's going to have to be brought down for this, the CCP.
[1:07:27.620 --> 1:07:32.820]  Time is party China.
[1:07:32.820 --> 1:07:35.820]  It's incredible.
[1:07:35.820 --> 1:07:38.900]  America is fighting for its life right now.
[1:07:38.900 --> 1:07:42.340]  And I've got all the numbers here that we're going to go over that if we don't reverse
[1:07:42.340 --> 1:07:45.940]  this, the depressions emanate, it's already here, it's already destroying the third world.
[1:07:45.940 --> 1:07:49.420]  We're talking about mass starvation, about mass death, as the president said, you want
[1:07:49.420 --> 1:07:54.780]  mass death, this is it.
[1:07:54.780 --> 1:07:58.860]  And then there's just the bombshell, bombshell, bombshell.
[1:07:58.860 --> 1:08:04.980]  Everybody overuses bombshell, but I mean global bombshell, that the Chinese government releases
[1:08:04.980 --> 1:08:12.740]  that, okay, we were working on gain of function COVID-19 at that lab in Wuhan, down the street
[1:08:12.740 --> 1:08:15.540]  from where they said it broke out.
[1:08:15.540 --> 1:08:17.380]  We were funded by Obama and Fauci.
[1:08:17.380 --> 1:08:20.780]  What's he going to do?
[1:08:20.780 --> 1:08:21.780]  That is total blackmail.
[1:08:21.780 --> 1:08:24.580]  And that's why they used a weapon they've been given by Obama.
[1:08:24.580 --> 1:08:28.580]  And it's not like we just started saying that yesterday when it was picked up at the newspapers.
[1:08:28.580 --> 1:08:35.420]  He told you, I looked it up, February 4th.
[1:08:35.420 --> 1:08:37.140]  So how many months ago was that?
[1:08:37.140 --> 1:08:39.940]  That's two months and over a week.
[1:08:39.940 --> 1:08:43.820]  So that's nine weeks ago.
[1:08:43.820 --> 1:08:53.540]  That's specifically Obama and Fauci and the NIH in 2015 transferred a gain of function
[1:08:53.540 --> 1:09:00.500]  in Chimera coronavirus that is nanotech that they're able to manipulate and weld things
[1:09:00.500 --> 1:09:01.500]  on to.
[1:09:01.500 --> 1:09:05.300]  The Chai comms couldn't figure that out.
[1:09:05.300 --> 1:09:09.100]  They had to be given it by Obama.
[1:09:09.100 --> 1:09:14.340]  And I had the, the head lawyer, the Harvard lawyer that prosecuted world dictators, Somalaji,
[1:09:14.340 --> 1:09:19.860]  that can wrote the US bio weapons law and the world treaties and all of it on nine weeks
[1:09:19.860 --> 1:09:23.500]  ago saying they sold it to him.
[1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:24.500]  They gave it to him.
[1:09:24.500 --> 1:09:30.380]  It's gain of function.
[1:09:30.380 --> 1:09:40.340]  And then you watch the scripting and the choreography and the architecture of the exactness of how
[1:09:40.340 --> 1:09:44.460]  the Chai comms rolled it out, how Hollywood rolled it out, how the media was lockstep
[1:09:44.460 --> 1:09:48.020]  and how this thing was pushed.
[1:09:48.020 --> 1:09:49.260]  It was launched on purpose.
[1:09:49.260 --> 1:09:51.780]  It didn't leak out of there on accident.
[1:09:51.780 --> 1:09:53.020]  Obama had given that to them.
[1:09:53.020 --> 1:09:57.340]  The globalists had given that to them at some future date to release this, to create the
[1:09:57.340 --> 1:10:02.020]  world lockdown for the UN World Health Organization to take over with the Bill and Melinda Gates
[1:10:02.020 --> 1:10:03.020]  Foundation.
[1:10:03.020 --> 1:10:08.820]  Boy, do we have something for you coming up the bottom of the hour and we will air it.
[1:10:08.820 --> 1:10:11.820]  Wait till you see this.
[1:10:11.820 --> 1:10:20.380]  Microsoft has put out a two and a half minute ad literally worshiping the head of the church
[1:10:20.380 --> 1:10:24.580]  of Alistair Crowley.
[1:10:24.580 --> 1:10:27.220]  Unbelievable.
[1:10:27.220 --> 1:10:37.100]  Wait till you see this and it's all, oh, don't worry, you're in virtual reality now.
[1:10:37.100 --> 1:10:41.380]  You can, now that you're locked up in your house, Microsoft wants you for free when
[1:10:41.380 --> 1:10:45.980]  you open it up to look at their grand faloon.
[1:10:45.980 --> 1:10:50.260]  Kurt Vonnegut, a big listener of the show.
[1:10:50.260 --> 1:10:51.260]  Not bragging.
[1:10:51.260 --> 1:10:52.260]  It's just cool.
[1:10:52.260 --> 1:10:59.420]  We had a few conversations before he died and sent me some art and things like that.
[1:10:59.420 --> 1:11:04.660]  Grand faloons are how established, especially rich people, will celebrate some stupid person
[1:11:04.660 --> 1:11:05.740]  or some dumb thing.
[1:11:05.740 --> 1:11:12.580]  A grand faloon would be Leslie, this horrible, nasty drug dealer, a guy with a beard with
[1:11:12.580 --> 1:11:16.460]  diarrhea running down his legs that has been around Austin for 20 years.
[1:11:16.460 --> 1:11:17.460]  I had an office by him.
[1:11:17.460 --> 1:11:18.460]  Didn't know it.
[1:11:18.460 --> 1:11:20.020]  Had to see the stuff he was doing every day.
[1:11:20.020 --> 1:11:22.100]  I mean, he was a very sad person.
[1:11:22.100 --> 1:11:26.900]  The left celebrated him as a grand faloon.
[1:11:26.900 --> 1:11:34.180]  Well, this devil works per lady who said in a Reddit post, no, I really do Crowley rituals.
[1:11:34.180 --> 1:11:36.580]  I believe this.
[1:11:36.580 --> 1:11:37.580]  For you, it's art.
[1:11:37.580 --> 1:11:38.760]  For me, it's ritual.
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:40.580]  This woman is a grand faloon.
[1:11:40.580 --> 1:11:47.100]  You know, why would they want to buy a $500 million painting of a skull, a bloody skull
[1:11:47.100 --> 1:11:55.860]  with semen on it, because if children are starving and you could feed 100 billion children
[1:11:55.860 --> 1:12:02.980]  with that money over and over again, if you can put it on some devil worshiper that poops
[1:12:02.980 --> 1:12:11.260]  on a skull, see, that's satanic Maria Abranovich.
[1:12:11.260 --> 1:12:17.820]  I mean, that's what they believe this woman is immortal, even though she looks just like
[1:12:17.820 --> 1:12:22.820]  a fat old lady.
[1:12:22.820 --> 1:12:27.180]  And they worship this giant sack of trash.
[1:12:27.180 --> 1:12:29.460]  That's coming up out on the arm.
[1:12:29.460 --> 1:12:33.860]  And you know, that's my ongoing frustration that Bill Gates is devil worshiper.
[1:12:33.860 --> 1:12:37.740]  I mean, Bill Gates, best buddies with Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:12:37.740 --> 1:12:40.380]  I told you that years ago it all came out.
[1:12:40.380 --> 1:12:44.060]  And then we have to sit here and like a little devil worshiper hopping around that like worships
[1:12:44.060 --> 1:12:53.100]  this clown woman who'll burn in hell.
[1:12:53.100 --> 1:12:55.460]  It's incredible.
[1:12:55.460 --> 1:12:59.500]  So all I'm saying is these people are a joke.
[1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:02.540]  Okay, let me let me do this.
[1:13:02.540 --> 1:13:07.460]  I said I'd get into Bill Gates announcing that everyone's going to be given forced inoculations
[1:13:07.460 --> 1:13:12.620]  worldwide and that hundreds of thousands of you will die.
[1:13:12.620 --> 1:13:17.900]  I think that's a pretty, you know, hundreds of thousands haven't died worldwide from COVID-19,
[1:13:17.900 --> 1:13:20.700]  but he says hundreds of thousands of died from the vaccine, but that's a good price
[1:13:20.700 --> 1:13:21.700]  to pay.
[1:13:21.700 --> 1:13:30.700]  You're going to see him say that out of his little, little gremlin mouth.
[1:13:30.700 --> 1:13:33.420]  You know, where I come from, we recognize those things real quick.
[1:13:33.420 --> 1:13:39.220]  Anyways, the point is, is that we're going to talk about all that coming up and show
[1:13:39.220 --> 1:13:42.060]  you who your enemy is and then give the number out right now.
[1:13:42.060 --> 1:13:48.540]  That's 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539 country code if you're calling international and can't
[1:13:48.540 --> 1:13:58.060]  call 1-800 most of you can, but you can't country code and then 512-646-1776 512-646-1776
[1:13:58.060 --> 1:14:02.780]  and then we've got 877-789 Alex.
[1:14:02.780 --> 1:14:03.780]  I'm going to go to break.
[1:14:03.780 --> 1:14:10.180]  I'm going to be a good boy and come back and cover all this, but God abhors a vacuum.
[1:14:10.180 --> 1:14:13.100]  And that's all acting like a bunch of jellyfish is a vacuum.
[1:14:13.100 --> 1:14:17.140]  And so if you really want evil, God's going to give it to you.
[1:14:17.140 --> 1:14:22.100]  China's openly getting ready to invade Taiwan, openly saying it.
[1:14:22.100 --> 1:14:26.140]  America's outgunned with traitor spies all over it, trying to bring the economy down.
[1:14:26.140 --> 1:14:31.100]  And all I'm saying is, is if Trump's the big man, he says he is, he'd do what any U.S.
[1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:34.100]  president would do before, whether it was Andrew Jackson, George Washington, or even
[1:14:34.100 --> 1:14:41.100]  Hell Eisenhower, before him and Teddy Roosevelt had him go around and grab the Nazis up.
[1:14:41.100 --> 1:14:44.780]  I mean, you know, that's just what you do when you're overwhelming.
[1:14:44.780 --> 1:14:48.540]  I mean, citizens have rights to say and do whatever they want, as long as they didn't
[1:14:48.540 --> 1:14:50.700]  call for violence.
[1:14:50.700 --> 1:14:56.540]  But when you have foreign powers financing groups for the overthrow of the country itself
[1:14:56.540 --> 1:15:00.500]  and the enslavement and the taking of rights, well, that's when you roll the slaves up and
[1:15:00.500 --> 1:15:04.780]  say, okay, time to get your fight.
[1:15:04.780 --> 1:15:07.460]  So that's where we are.
[1:15:07.460 --> 1:15:12.380]  And Trump's been arresting the Confucian club people and a bunch of the Chai-Kom agents
[1:15:12.380 --> 1:15:15.460]  in the head of Harvard running this stuff.
[1:15:15.460 --> 1:15:16.460]  That's good.
[1:15:16.460 --> 1:15:17.460]  That's a good start.
[1:15:17.460 --> 1:15:18.460]  That's a good start.
[1:15:18.460 --> 1:15:20.540]  And I, again, personally, don't want anybody to not go out and do those.
[1:15:20.540 --> 1:15:25.740]  I want the president to sign death warrants, and then I want it carried out properly, legally.
[1:15:25.740 --> 1:15:27.540]  I'm not calling for any violence.
[1:15:27.540 --> 1:15:32.220]  I'm just simply saying, if the president doesn't start acting, there's going to be more violence
[1:15:32.220 --> 1:15:35.380]  than anybody could ever imagine, because we're going to have a depression and total war and
[1:15:35.380 --> 1:15:37.220]  probably World War III and the end of the planet.
[1:15:37.220 --> 1:15:39.220]  So I'd just like to stop this now.
[1:15:39.220 --> 1:15:42.740]  Please, Mr. President, I warned you that when the impeachment failed, they were cooking
[1:15:42.740 --> 1:15:43.740]  up a bio attack.
[1:15:43.740 --> 1:15:44.740]  And I'm on record.
[1:15:44.740 --> 1:15:45.740]  I'm on record.
[1:15:45.740 --> 1:15:46.740]  I'm on record.
[1:15:46.740 --> 1:15:48.820]  So listen to me now.
[1:15:48.820 --> 1:15:49.820]  Listen to the Oracle of Austin.
[1:15:49.820 --> 1:15:50.820]  We'll be right back.
[1:15:50.820 --> 1:15:58.260]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[1:15:58.260 --> 1:16:00.180]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[1:16:00.180 --> 1:16:01.940]  I had a problem like you once.
[1:16:01.940 --> 1:16:07.340]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[1:16:07.340 --> 1:16:08.420]  my life.
[1:16:08.420 --> 1:16:13.700]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[1:16:13.700 --> 1:16:17.980]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it
[1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:22.060]  alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[1:16:22.060 --> 1:16:26.780]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[1:16:26.780 --> 1:16:29.060]  and totally change your life.
[1:16:29.060 --> 1:16:34.300]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[1:16:34.300 --> 1:16:37.580]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[1:16:37.580 --> 1:16:38.580]  Get clean.
[1:16:38.580 --> 1:16:53.900]  Until now and learn more, 800-506-6740, 800-506-6740, that's 800-506-6740.
[1:16:53.900 --> 1:16:55.540]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[1:16:55.540 --> 1:17:00.340]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[1:17:00.340 --> 1:17:01.340]  I buy some.
[1:17:01.340 --> 1:17:02.340]  I use some.
[1:17:02.340 --> 1:17:03.340]  I store some.
[1:17:03.340 --> 1:17:04.340]  Awesome.
[1:17:04.340 --> 1:17:08.940]  This is what refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life NASA pack technology.
[1:17:08.940 --> 1:17:09.940]  Bacon.
[1:17:09.940 --> 1:17:14.980]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon, or warm and serve.
[1:17:14.980 --> 1:17:16.980]  Life saving, ready to eat bacon.
[1:17:16.980 --> 1:17:18.820]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[1:17:55.420 --> 1:18:02.340]  The ultimate charity would be a nanny state that would not allow anyone to ever do anything
[1:18:02.340 --> 1:18:06.020]  that could possibly hurt them, and that's the globalist plan.
[1:18:06.020 --> 1:18:10.620]  And now, Mr. Fauci at the NIH, last night in a press conference standing right next
[1:18:10.620 --> 1:18:15.140]  to the president, said, we're going to have a global lockdown because he talked to world
[1:18:15.140 --> 1:18:22.900]  leaders until not one more person is dying or one more person is infected.
[1:18:22.900 --> 1:18:25.460]  The video is posted on infowars.com.
[1:18:25.460 --> 1:18:30.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, that sets the precedent where not one person can die from the flu,
[1:18:30.300 --> 1:18:32.820]  not one person can die from a cold.
[1:18:32.820 --> 1:18:37.620]  Everyone will be surveilled in live time by their cell phones and apps and drones and
[1:18:37.620 --> 1:18:41.300]  an absolute straight jacket of pure medical tyranny.
[1:18:41.300 --> 1:18:45.940]  And remember, it's a big farmer that has a level four bio weapons labs that keeps leaking
[1:18:45.940 --> 1:18:48.020]  all these man-made viruses.
[1:18:48.020 --> 1:18:49.540]  They're holding us all hostage.
[1:18:49.540 --> 1:18:54.820]  Oh, and he talked about forced annotilations.
[1:18:54.820 --> 1:19:00.300]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes
[1:19:00.300 --> 1:19:01.780]  infowars has had.
[1:19:01.780 --> 1:19:07.820]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together, but I'll tell you this.
[1:19:07.820 --> 1:19:13.660]  The technocrats are really upping their game, and they are trying to destroy all independent
[1:19:13.660 --> 1:19:14.660]  forms of media.
[1:19:14.660 --> 1:19:20.660]  They're trying to shudder and silence human resistance, so now is the time to understand
[1:19:20.660 --> 1:19:24.140]  that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate, everything you warned your
[1:19:24.140 --> 1:19:26.660]  friends and family about us around to be true.
[1:19:26.660 --> 1:19:29.420]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[1:19:29.420 --> 1:19:34.540]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can't, but it's up to all
[1:19:34.540 --> 1:19:38.380]  of us to not let them silence any of us.
[1:19:38.380 --> 1:19:44.420]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[1:19:44.420 --> 1:19:49.180]  We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't
[1:19:49.180 --> 1:19:50.180]  come.
[1:19:50.180 --> 1:20:07.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:07.740 --> 1:20:10.380]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:20:10.380 --> 1:20:18.180]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:20:18.180 --> 1:20:26.780]  So Rio Abrambook, the swollen pig-like maggot that the devil worshippers vowed to, had
[1:20:26.780 --> 1:20:31.940]  a disgusting Microsoft worship act, because they always worshiper, again, worshipping
[1:20:31.940 --> 1:20:37.140]  something ugly, something stunted, something diseased, is an inversion of price.
[1:20:37.140 --> 1:20:42.500]  They worshipped this shrunken head of Satan.
[1:20:42.500 --> 1:20:45.780]  It had 99% downvotes.
[1:20:45.780 --> 1:20:47.100]  We've got screenshots coming up.
[1:20:47.100 --> 1:20:50.380]  I was going to premiere the video next segment for you.
[1:20:50.380 --> 1:20:52.380]  They pulled it.
[1:20:52.380 --> 1:20:57.740]  Microsoft thought when Gates is so scared, he goes, worship Satan in public, lesser magic.
[1:20:57.740 --> 1:20:58.740]  She prays with him.
[1:20:58.740 --> 1:21:00.340]  I've met with people who used to be in her church.
[1:21:00.340 --> 1:21:04.340]  She prays and they do rituals and they're all scared and they go, oh, I was the Crowley,
[1:21:04.340 --> 1:21:07.380]  oh, please help us.
[1:21:07.380 --> 1:21:11.340]  Just because Satan gave you the power to rape, everybody doesn't mean you're a powerful scum.
[1:21:11.340 --> 1:21:15.300]  That's what these Satanists, they live in such incredible fear.
[1:21:15.300 --> 1:21:16.940]  So I just love it.
[1:21:16.940 --> 1:21:21.420]  Bill Gates, who hangs out with her and hangs out with Jeffrey Epstein, we'll show you photos
[1:21:21.420 --> 1:21:25.420]  of that coming up, is absolutely running scared.
[1:21:25.420 --> 1:21:29.260]  In fact, I'm not going to premiere this next segment now, because I want Bill Gates with
[1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:30.260]  Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:21:30.260 --> 1:21:34.700]  I want articles about him lying about it being caught living there, living with him in Europe
[1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:35.700]  and New York.
[1:21:35.700 --> 1:21:39.580]  I mean, he lives with him months on end, along with the Prince and all the weird stuff they
[1:21:39.580 --> 1:21:45.620]  did, and then Brevanovich, Brevanovich drops by and they like, you know, wallow around
[1:21:45.620 --> 1:21:50.620]  and just, oh, imagine her telling Podeska, come to the meeting.
[1:21:50.620 --> 1:21:54.740]  We have the sperm and the milk and the blood, and he's like, I can't help it.
[1:21:54.740 --> 1:21:57.860]  I've got to go to that.
[1:21:57.860 --> 1:22:03.780]  And then his brother is in the 2007 Washington Post about his avant-garde art and it's all
[1:22:03.780 --> 1:22:08.780]  pedophilia and tied up children, three-year-olds in dungeons hanging out by their legs.
[1:22:08.780 --> 1:22:10.780]  One of them, of course, is Anderson Cooper.
[1:22:10.780 --> 1:22:13.300]  I can't get this up, man.
[1:22:13.300 --> 1:22:16.100]  I mean, that's why I'd like, stop it already.
[1:22:16.100 --> 1:22:17.300]  Come on, man.
[1:22:17.300 --> 1:22:18.300]  Come on.
[1:22:18.300 --> 1:22:19.300]  Come on.
[1:22:19.300 --> 1:22:25.180]  I mean, I never get sick of beer and watching a movie with my wife and hanging out with
[1:22:25.180 --> 1:22:26.340]  my kids in the swimming pool.
[1:22:26.340 --> 1:22:32.260]  I mean, I never crossed my mind to tie kids up and then much less put it on in the Washington
[1:22:32.260 --> 1:22:33.260]  Post.
[1:22:33.260 --> 1:22:34.260]  You get it off the screen.
[1:22:34.260 --> 1:22:35.260]  I don't know.
[1:22:35.260 --> 1:22:41.100]  I'm in the dungeon, I hang the kids up by their feet, and we can't show this.
[1:22:41.100 --> 1:22:44.580]  We have radio stations and TV stations call up and say, can you talk about this?
[1:22:44.580 --> 1:22:47.020]  Well, especially the TV stations, they go, can you show that?
[1:22:47.020 --> 1:22:52.300]  I'm like, the Washington Post had a whole spread on it because it's called lesser magic.
[1:22:52.300 --> 1:22:56.060]  Satanists have to show you what they're doing to normalize it.
[1:22:56.060 --> 1:23:00.380]  They believe that's kind of like Mario Brothers, Mario Kart or Super Mario Brothers where you
[1:23:00.380 --> 1:23:05.340]  like get a bunch of jewels when you get the mushroom and you get superpower.
[1:23:05.340 --> 1:23:06.900]  It's like a bonus level.
[1:23:06.900 --> 1:23:10.220]  You've got to tell people what you're doing and then you get all the bonus levels.
[1:23:10.220 --> 1:23:14.540]  We got Trevor, we got Daniel, we got Don, we got David, we got Paul, we got Brian, we
[1:23:14.540 --> 1:23:15.540]  got Chase.
[1:23:15.540 --> 1:23:16.540]  We got a lot of folks.
[1:23:16.540 --> 1:23:22.620]  We're going to take your calls, but I tend to get up here and get a little aggressive
[1:23:22.620 --> 1:23:23.620]  about this.
[1:23:23.620 --> 1:23:27.740]  I either get really depressed or really angry or really almost manic about it.
[1:23:27.740 --> 1:23:37.460]  And the truth is that I have to kind of make a sick joke out all this or I'm going to start
[1:23:37.460 --> 1:23:43.940]  balling on air and I'm sort of having an anxiety attack because you know what my brain's telling
[1:23:43.940 --> 1:23:44.940]  me, right?
[1:23:44.940 --> 1:23:47.060]  It's like, son, you ain't supposed to be up here talking about this.
[1:23:47.060 --> 1:23:48.060]  You're not a talker.
[1:23:48.060 --> 1:23:53.900]  That's just one of your little side guess you're a head smasher.
[1:23:53.900 --> 1:23:58.380]  And I try to control my instincts because I understand we're in a new war.
[1:23:58.380 --> 1:24:08.700]  I use information war, but I'm just here to tell you it's sweet as pumpkin pie that they're
[1:24:08.700 --> 1:24:14.820]  so disconnected from reality that they thought if they did a ritual externalizing her and
[1:24:14.820 --> 1:24:19.820]  worshiping her, they believe that she can send power back to Bill Gates.
[1:24:19.820 --> 1:24:25.260]  Oh, yeah, she sent a lot of power to Anthony Weiner.
[1:24:25.260 --> 1:24:32.020]  She sent a lot of power to Jeffrey Epstein and Hillary.
[1:24:32.020 --> 1:24:33.020]  Didn't she?
[1:24:33.020 --> 1:24:36.100]  Oh, yeah, a lot of power.
[1:24:36.100 --> 1:24:37.340]  You talk about deceived.
[1:24:37.340 --> 1:24:39.740]  I mean, this is they.
[1:24:39.740 --> 1:24:45.060]  This is one of the number one worshiped people because she's connected the Rothschilds and
[1:24:45.060 --> 1:24:51.940]  the royal families of the Satanism, and so they all just festoon her as the Grand Fallon
[1:24:51.940 --> 1:24:56.900]  and they roll this out and we're some bloated pimple head.
[1:24:56.900 --> 1:25:00.300]  Oh, look, you laid in a pentagram.
[1:25:00.300 --> 1:25:03.460]  We're so scared of you.
[1:25:03.460 --> 1:25:10.700]  They'll all drown in lakes of blood.
[1:25:10.700 --> 1:25:15.020]  You know, it's the most valuable thing in my life that Podesta got Bloomberg and Bill Gates
[1:25:15.020 --> 1:25:17.540]  to put into a money fund and sue me.
[1:25:17.540 --> 1:25:20.580]  They couldn't get the other big billionaire to do it.
[1:25:20.580 --> 1:25:24.340]  I mean, I'm I'm so proud of that.
[1:25:24.340 --> 1:25:30.940]  That's like my most valuable thing that devil worshiping child molesters hate me and I'm
[1:25:30.940 --> 1:25:32.980]  written space in our mind.
[1:25:32.980 --> 1:25:37.780]  That's like when I get that little from God, that little like God's like, hey, let me show
[1:25:37.780 --> 1:25:38.780]  you something.
[1:25:38.780 --> 1:25:40.780]  I'm like, whoa, why do I get this?
[1:25:40.780 --> 1:25:45.260]  Well, I like what you're doing, but you got to be ready because they're going to tear
[1:25:45.260 --> 1:25:46.260]  you limb from limb.
[1:25:46.260 --> 1:25:52.740]  I'm like, yes, sir, I'm ready for that because I want more with the big guy.
[1:25:52.740 --> 1:25:54.020]  And that's what these Satanists don't get.
[1:25:54.020 --> 1:25:59.540]  If they ever had it, I mean, look how pathetic and hunchback and disease and spoons of blood.
[1:25:59.540 --> 1:26:05.780]  Oh, children's blood, oh, spoons of blood, I'm so power of scorpion on your head.
[1:26:05.780 --> 1:26:10.780]  Oh, and all these rich scum weirdo neurotics trying to act powerful.
[1:26:10.780 --> 1:26:18.020]  You will all be destroyed very soon.
[1:26:18.020 --> 1:26:22.060]  You want blood?
[1:26:22.060 --> 1:26:23.620]  Blood on the streets and up to your ankles.
[1:26:23.620 --> 1:26:25.860]  Can we queue up the door song?
[1:26:25.860 --> 1:26:26.860]  Maybe.
[1:26:26.860 --> 1:26:30.380]  All right, I got to stop.
[1:26:30.380 --> 1:26:32.580]  See, I haven't even scrapped.
[1:26:32.580 --> 1:26:34.780]  I literally did hours of preparation last night.
[1:26:34.780 --> 1:26:36.060]  I did hours of preparation.
[1:26:36.060 --> 1:26:43.020]  I did 10 hours of preparation yesterday, 10 hours.
[1:26:43.020 --> 1:26:46.300]  And then I got up here and did preparation and I want to go to your calls.
[1:26:46.300 --> 1:26:50.900]  I just, they are flaming criminals, man.
[1:26:50.900 --> 1:26:51.940]  And then there's the paradox.
[1:26:51.940 --> 1:27:00.740]  How are they dominating us when they worship bloated blobs?
[1:27:00.740 --> 1:27:12.100]  And then they try to, every video they put out, everyone rejects and hates them.
[1:27:12.100 --> 1:27:16.700]  And so then they try to doll it up and go, well, if we all have a big black altar, we
[1:27:16.700 --> 1:27:20.740]  all wear white suits and we simulate eating someone's body for the real thing and see
[1:27:20.740 --> 1:27:23.980]  who's into it, won't that scare them?
[1:27:23.980 --> 1:27:31.220]  Will that make them go away and hide if we tell them that we'd scare them?
[1:27:31.220 --> 1:27:33.820]  No, it doesn't scare us.
[1:27:33.820 --> 1:27:42.820]  I will assure you, but this is the best they've got.
[1:27:42.820 --> 1:27:43.980]  So what does that say about us?
[1:27:43.980 --> 1:27:50.380]  It says we've been asleep in a coma and we've allowed these Satanists to rule over us.
[1:27:50.380 --> 1:27:55.260]  And so for us to be able to get to the next level in God, we have to get through these
[1:27:55.260 --> 1:28:02.620]  people that are like a logjam of feces, but we still have to get through.
[1:28:02.620 --> 1:28:05.020]  And I know you don't want to, that's the truth is, you don't want to go through it
[1:28:05.020 --> 1:28:06.020]  because that's why they put it there.
[1:28:06.020 --> 1:28:08.020]  You're like, gosh, that's, I don't want to fight that.
[1:28:08.020 --> 1:28:09.460]  I thought that's even powerful.
[1:28:09.460 --> 1:28:10.460]  It's so revolting.
[1:28:10.460 --> 1:28:14.420]  You're like, you just got to say, you know what, I'm taking this jacket off, I'm diving
[1:28:14.420 --> 1:28:15.420]  into this.
[1:28:15.420 --> 1:28:19.180]  I want to get my hands around your throat.
[1:28:19.180 --> 1:28:21.900]  You want to fight, you're about to get one.
[1:28:21.900 --> 1:28:22.900]  That's what it takes.
[1:28:22.900 --> 1:28:28.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's all I know is you want to fight my God.
[1:28:28.540 --> 1:28:30.020]  God is giving me so much power.
[1:28:30.020 --> 1:28:33.260]  I can't even contain it or believe it.
[1:28:33.260 --> 1:28:35.740]  And I see you Satanists that aren't even in the same dimension.
[1:28:35.740 --> 1:28:39.780]  I'm like, why the hell are they wanting power and going with this?
[1:28:39.780 --> 1:28:44.460]  They could have eternal life and unlimited creation and be given God like power.
[1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:51.620]  But they're pieces of crap that come from crap because their father is a loser, a loser.

[1:31:54.460 --> 1:31:59.460]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown

[1:32:54.460 --> 1:32:59.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:24.460 --> 1:33:26.460]  I love my ankles.
[1:33:43.460 --> 1:33:45.460]  Pop my collar here.
[1:33:45.460 --> 1:33:55.460]  Not that tough.
[1:34:16.460 --> 1:34:19.460]  Those that live by the sword,
[1:34:19.460 --> 1:34:23.460]  die by the sword, thank God.
[1:34:23.460 --> 1:34:24.460]  Because what you look for
[1:34:24.460 --> 1:34:28.460]  and what you love is what you get.
[1:34:28.460 --> 1:34:31.460]  All right, let's get serious.
[1:34:31.460 --> 1:34:33.460]  I went side-tracked off into the Devil,
[1:34:33.460 --> 1:34:35.460]  and how pathetic they are,
[1:34:35.460 --> 1:34:38.460]  but I'm going to play that start of the next hour
[1:34:38.460 --> 1:34:40.460]  because they pulled me off
[1:34:40.460 --> 1:34:45.460]  and jumped the shark man,
[1:34:45.460 --> 1:34:48.460]  and they literally in the weirdo
[1:34:48.460 --> 1:34:51.460]  New York society devil worship stuff
[1:34:51.460 --> 1:34:53.460]  keep promoting this lady
[1:34:53.460 --> 1:34:55.460]  because they think they literally,
[1:34:55.460 --> 1:34:59.460]  she can save them.
[1:34:59.460 --> 1:35:03.460]  And we have the video they banned,
[1:35:03.460 --> 1:35:05.460]  and we've done something special with it.
[1:35:05.460 --> 1:35:08.460]  We've done something special with it.
[1:35:08.460 --> 1:35:10.460]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[1:35:10.460 --> 1:35:14.460]  But let's just say I should stop it
[1:35:14.460 --> 1:35:16.460]  because it's like giving a dead cockroach
[1:35:16.460 --> 1:35:17.460]  in the corner too much attention.
[1:35:17.460 --> 1:35:19.460]  It kind of becomes, you kind of become the thing.
[1:35:19.460 --> 1:35:21.460]  Do not stare into the abyss too long
[1:35:21.460 --> 1:35:22.460]  unless you become the abyss.
[1:35:22.460 --> 1:35:24.460]  So let me just stop right there.
[1:35:24.460 --> 1:35:26.460]  Let me be a good boy.
[1:35:26.460 --> 1:35:27.460]  Let me be a really good boy.
[1:35:27.460 --> 1:35:29.460]  Let me actually go to your phone calls.
[1:35:29.460 --> 1:35:31.460]  But let me just briefly,
[1:35:31.460 --> 1:35:32.460]  I've never been able to do this
[1:35:32.460 --> 1:35:34.460]  in 26 years on air,
[1:35:34.460 --> 1:35:37.460]  but let me just read you a few episodes.
[1:35:37.460 --> 1:35:40.460]  I always kind of stick on one every three or four or five.
[1:35:40.460 --> 1:35:42.460]  I've said this a thousand times,
[1:35:42.460 --> 1:35:44.460]  kind of like the old Tootsie role commercial effect.
[1:35:44.460 --> 1:35:45.460]  We start the next segment with that.
[1:35:45.460 --> 1:35:47.460]  How many licks does it take
[1:35:47.460 --> 1:35:49.460]  to get to the center of a Tootsie role?
[1:35:49.460 --> 1:35:51.460]  And they go to the wise Alan goes,
[1:35:51.460 --> 1:35:54.460]  a one, two, a three, a three.
[1:35:54.460 --> 1:35:57.460]  Well, I mean, how many articles can Alan Jones get through
[1:35:57.460 --> 1:35:59.460]  without stopping on one?
[1:35:59.460 --> 1:36:01.460]  Let's try it right now.
[1:36:01.460 --> 1:36:05.460]  Video, former FDA head says China lies over COVID-19
[1:36:05.460 --> 1:36:06.460]  should be investigated.
[1:36:06.460 --> 1:36:10.460]  That's interesting.
[1:36:10.460 --> 1:36:14.460]  India to probe Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[1:36:14.460 --> 1:36:17.460]  Beijing Titans grip on coronavirus research
[1:36:17.460 --> 1:36:18.460]  in U.S. China.
[1:36:18.460 --> 1:36:21.460]  Wow, over virus origin.
[1:36:21.460 --> 1:36:22.460]  Global bombshell.
[1:36:22.460 --> 1:36:24.460]  China admits to harvesting and testing COVID-19
[1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:27.460]  like coronavirus is a Wuhan lab.
[1:36:27.460 --> 1:36:30.460]  Deep economic suffering has erupted all over America.
[1:36:30.460 --> 1:36:34.460]  But guess who's federal reserves helping?
[1:36:34.460 --> 1:36:37.460]  They're rolling out the architecture of oppression now
[1:36:37.460 --> 1:36:39.460]  because they fear the people.
[1:36:39.460 --> 1:36:41.460]  Wuhan lab is performing coronavirus experiments
[1:36:41.460 --> 1:36:42.460]  on bats from cave.
[1:36:42.460 --> 1:36:44.460]  The disease is believed to have originated.
[1:36:44.460 --> 1:36:46.460]  Let's Trump's fault.
[1:36:46.460 --> 1:36:47.460]  Do it for Big Mama.
[1:36:47.460 --> 1:36:49.460]  U.S. Surgeon General Slamper telling black Americans
[1:36:49.460 --> 1:36:54.460]  stop drinking, doing drugs.
[1:36:54.460 --> 1:36:56.460]  I don't just think it's black folks call their grandma
[1:36:56.460 --> 1:36:57.460]  Big Mama.
[1:36:57.460 --> 1:36:58.460]  I guess in the south,
[1:36:58.460 --> 1:37:01.460]  a lot of white folks call their grandmother Big Mama.
[1:37:01.460 --> 1:37:04.460]  I teach my mother and call her Big Mama.
[1:37:04.460 --> 1:37:05.460]  Kids are around.
[1:37:05.460 --> 1:37:06.460]  Whatever.
[1:37:06.460 --> 1:37:07.460]  Let's keep going here.
[1:37:07.460 --> 1:37:10.460]  Iran probe theory that coronavirus outbreak,
[1:37:10.460 --> 1:37:11.460]  because they get bigger, you know.
[1:37:11.460 --> 1:37:13.460]  America is a pretty prosperous country.
[1:37:13.460 --> 1:37:14.460]  Mama ain't big.
[1:37:14.460 --> 1:37:15.460]  Something's wrong with her.
[1:37:15.460 --> 1:37:17.460]  Let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:37:17.460 --> 1:37:22.460]  Coronavirus vaccine hunt could go horribly wrong.
[1:37:22.460 --> 1:37:23.460]  Is that Alex Jones?
[1:37:23.460 --> 1:37:27.460]  No, that's Piss Feed, Buzz Feed saying that.
[1:37:27.460 --> 1:37:29.460]  Wow, really?
[1:37:29.460 --> 1:37:31.460]  Oh, and that's the clip I haven't gotten to yet.
[1:37:31.460 --> 1:37:33.460]  Oh, I'll have to cover that later.
[1:37:33.460 --> 1:37:35.460]  Flight attendants and pilots ask,
[1:37:35.460 --> 1:37:36.460]  is it okay to keep working?
[1:37:36.460 --> 1:37:37.460]  So that's the total shutdown.
[1:37:37.460 --> 1:37:38.460]  No, you could die of the flu too.
[1:37:38.460 --> 1:37:40.460]  You could die on a damn plane crash.
[1:37:40.460 --> 1:37:43.460]  It's this idea that someone's going to keep you totally safe.
[1:37:43.460 --> 1:37:45.460]  That's the way to paralyze you, cause a depression,
[1:37:45.460 --> 1:37:47.460]  and they'll end up killing you, lady.
[1:37:47.460 --> 1:37:51.460]  Oh, I kind of just bit the tootsie roll, didn't I?
[1:37:51.460 --> 1:37:53.460]  I'm doing good, though, John, right?
[1:37:53.460 --> 1:37:55.460]  Harmon's been running the show for 17 years.
[1:37:55.460 --> 1:37:57.460]  I mean, I've ever gone this far?
[1:37:57.460 --> 1:37:59.460]  I don't know, let's keep going.
[1:37:59.460 --> 1:38:02.460]  Kremlin says Moscow hospitals flooded with coronavirus death toll.
[1:38:02.460 --> 1:38:04.460]  Passes a hundred.
[1:38:04.460 --> 1:38:05.460]  I looked it up.
[1:38:05.460 --> 1:38:09.460]  Moscow usually, in a month, loses about 400 people to the flu.
[1:38:09.460 --> 1:38:13.460]  But again, it's a perception like a hundred kids got killed
[1:38:13.460 --> 1:38:15.460]  mass shootings this year.
[1:38:15.460 --> 1:38:17.460]  That's super rare still, but it's like,
[1:38:17.460 --> 1:38:19.460]  well, you better turn your guns in.
[1:38:19.460 --> 1:38:20.460]  You better stay in your house.
[1:38:20.460 --> 1:38:22.460]  You better see it's a perception.
[1:38:22.460 --> 1:38:23.460]  You better not get in the ocean.
[1:38:23.460 --> 1:38:25.460]  A guy got eaten by a great white shark five years ago,
[1:38:25.460 --> 1:38:27.460]  right out there by that buoy.
[1:38:30.460 --> 1:38:33.460]  My dad was out at his family ranch about a couple weeks ago.
[1:38:33.460 --> 1:38:35.460]  His local guy, the property,
[1:38:35.460 --> 1:38:37.460]  he was right there by the lake they got.
[1:38:37.460 --> 1:38:40.460]  And he goes, I'm watching out and saw a big mountain line on that.
[1:38:40.460 --> 1:38:43.460]  Damn, we're going over there walking your dog.
[1:38:43.460 --> 1:38:46.460]  Mountain lines have 40 to a hundred mile ranges.
[1:38:46.460 --> 1:38:47.460]  It's not around there.
[1:38:47.460 --> 1:38:51.460]  But again, there might be five mountain line attacks a year.
[1:38:51.460 --> 1:38:52.460]  People are scared of them.
[1:38:52.460 --> 1:38:53.460]  Let's continue.
[1:38:53.460 --> 1:38:55.460]  Kremlin.
[1:38:55.460 --> 1:38:56.460]  Oh, let's talk about this.
[1:38:56.460 --> 1:38:58.460]  I haven't hit this yet.
[1:38:58.460 --> 1:38:59.460]  First Amendment.
[1:38:59.460 --> 1:39:01.460]  All these lockdowns of churches.
[1:39:01.460 --> 1:39:03.460]  Why does the government have such a hard on for that?
[1:39:03.460 --> 1:39:06.460]  It says the gay pride of the parade should go ahead and everything else.
[1:39:06.460 --> 1:39:08.460]  I say, let those go ahead too.
[1:39:08.460 --> 1:39:11.460]  Congress shall make no law respecting and establish a religion
[1:39:11.460 --> 1:39:12.460]  or bringing the free exercise thereof.
[1:39:12.460 --> 1:39:14.460]  That's how the first amendment starts.
[1:39:14.460 --> 1:39:17.460]  It has no jurisdiction.
[1:39:17.460 --> 1:39:20.460]  Kind of like a cop from one county can't go in the next county.
[1:39:20.460 --> 1:39:24.460]  That's a beautiful thing, jurisdiction.
[1:39:24.460 --> 1:39:27.460]  But they got jurisdiction now, don't they?
[1:39:27.460 --> 1:39:30.460]  Or embracing the freedom of speech, or the press,
[1:39:30.460 --> 1:39:32.460]  or the right of the people to peacefully assemble,
[1:39:32.460 --> 1:39:34.460]  and to petition the government for redress their grievances.
[1:39:34.460 --> 1:39:39.460]  That's the first aid, brothers and sisters.
[1:39:39.460 --> 1:39:42.460]  Have you noticed how much delight they are taking
[1:39:42.460 --> 1:39:44.460]  in shutting down churches all over the United States?
[1:39:44.460 --> 1:39:46.460]  Yeah.
[1:39:46.460 --> 1:39:49.460]  When worshiping God becomes a civil disobedience,
[1:39:49.460 --> 1:39:52.460]  Democrat governor now bans American flag sales,
[1:39:52.460 --> 1:39:54.460]  and it gets worse.
[1:39:54.460 --> 1:39:57.460]  It's all the same they can do. That's not a joke, folks.
[1:39:57.460 --> 1:39:59.460]  That's in Michigan.
[1:39:59.460 --> 1:40:02.460]  French doctor claims solid results in the city of hydroxychloric,
[1:40:02.460 --> 1:40:04.460]  and well, don't listen to that.
[1:40:04.460 --> 1:40:07.460]  UK shopper receives fine for buying wine and potato chips.
[1:40:07.460 --> 1:40:09.460]  They say that's not essential.
[1:40:09.460 --> 1:40:11.460]  See, it's always more, more, more, more.
[1:40:11.460 --> 1:40:13.460]  You go, well, what level do they stop?
[1:40:13.460 --> 1:40:15.460]  Whatever you put up with, you watch these videos all year after we take calls
[1:40:15.460 --> 1:40:18.460]  of these arrogant police running around the UK, they're the worst.
[1:40:18.460 --> 1:40:20.460]  They knock a dude's door down.
[1:40:20.460 --> 1:40:22.460]  He's sitting there going, no one's here.
[1:40:22.460 --> 1:40:24.460]  They go, we got to search, and then when no one's there,
[1:40:24.460 --> 1:40:26.460]  they just leave the doors broken down.
[1:40:26.460 --> 1:40:29.460]  UK shopper receives fine for buying wine and potato chips
[1:40:29.460 --> 1:40:31.460]  during COVID-19 lockdown.
[1:40:31.460 --> 1:40:34.460]  Video, UK police breaking man's house to check it.
[1:40:34.460 --> 1:40:36.460]  He's not having social gatherings.
[1:40:36.460 --> 1:40:38.460]  UK police force brags about hiding in the shadows
[1:40:38.460 --> 1:40:41.460]  to catch picnic goers, which you'd catch all the pedophiles
[1:40:41.460 --> 1:40:43.460]  and jihadis raping kids.
[1:40:43.460 --> 1:40:45.460]  Big compilation on infowars.com,
[1:40:45.460 --> 1:40:48.460]  run rampant during coronavirus lockdown.
[1:40:48.460 --> 1:40:50.460]  Sweden faces stricter quarantine.
[1:40:50.460 --> 1:40:52.460]  PM admits measures were not enough.
[1:40:52.460 --> 1:40:53.460]  Oh, it'll never be enough.
[1:40:53.460 --> 1:40:55.460]  I've got the Democrats right here.
[1:40:55.460 --> 1:40:57.460]  I've got England coronavirus headlines.
[1:40:57.460 --> 1:40:58.460]  No end in sight.
[1:40:58.460 --> 1:41:00.460]  May last year says UK government.
[1:41:00.460 --> 1:41:02.460]  Oh, you're damn right, man.
[1:41:02.460 --> 1:41:07.460]  It's never going to end because you've been over real nice and pretty.
[1:41:07.460 --> 1:41:09.460]  Unbelievable.
[1:41:09.460 --> 1:41:11.460]  Now we're going to go back to break here
[1:41:11.460 --> 1:41:13.460]  and then come back and take your calls.
[1:41:13.460 --> 1:41:16.460]  We have not gotten to the starvation in mass
[1:41:16.460 --> 1:41:18.460]  and the actual million starving to death because of this.
[1:41:18.460 --> 1:41:20.460]  But again, that's okay.
[1:41:20.460 --> 1:41:23.460]  Wear your mask though.
[1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:25.460]  Seven deaths last time I checked in Austin.
[1:41:25.460 --> 1:41:26.460]  Total hysteria.
[1:41:26.460 --> 1:41:27.460]  You go to the grocery store.
[1:41:27.460 --> 1:41:28.460]  People are cussing at you.
[1:41:28.460 --> 1:41:30.460]  We're not wearing a mask.
[1:41:30.460 --> 1:41:32.460]  So I'm going to the local grocery store the next few days
[1:41:32.460 --> 1:41:36.460]  wearing a Zore mask, a big lizard mask with a mask.
[1:41:36.460 --> 1:41:37.460]  They complain.
[1:41:37.460 --> 1:41:39.460]  I'm going to say this is the latest technology.
[1:41:39.460 --> 1:41:44.460]  But again, Bill Gates came out
[1:41:44.460 --> 1:41:46.460]  the most incredible statement this weekend.
[1:41:46.460 --> 1:41:47.460]  I haven't played it yet.
[1:41:47.460 --> 1:41:49.460]  I should have started the show with it.
[1:41:49.460 --> 1:41:51.460]  And he said forced inoculations are coming.
[1:41:51.460 --> 1:41:53.460]  He's also got a digital vaccine has an ink in it
[1:41:53.460 --> 1:41:56.460]  that puts microchips, nano chips in you.
[1:41:56.460 --> 1:41:57.460]  Yeah, that's old.
[1:41:57.460 --> 1:41:58.460]  That's 1970s.
[1:41:58.460 --> 1:42:01.460]  That little grand rice in you.
[1:42:01.460 --> 1:42:05.460]  But he said hundreds of thousands will die from the vaccine,
[1:42:05.460 --> 1:42:07.460]  but that's okay.
[1:42:07.460 --> 1:42:09.460]  Their families will be paid money.
[1:42:09.460 --> 1:42:11.460]  Wait till you see this.
[1:42:11.460 --> 1:42:14.460]  Let me tell you, anybody trying to force inoculate me
[1:42:14.460 --> 1:42:17.460]  is going to get their own forced inoculation.
[1:42:17.460 --> 1:42:19.460]  And can you guess with it?
[1:42:19.460 --> 1:42:20.460]  I like full metal jackets.
[1:42:20.460 --> 1:42:22.460]  It'll be brass and not lead.
[1:42:22.460 --> 1:42:28.460]  But seriously, folks, you want the protection taken away?
[1:42:28.460 --> 1:42:29.460]  Crank this up.
[1:42:29.460 --> 1:42:32.460]  All these devil worshipers that wanted the heads of protection
[1:42:32.460 --> 1:42:35.460]  taken away, they're going to be the first fed.
[1:42:35.460 --> 1:42:40.460]  Feet first in to the spiritual and physical wood shipper.
[1:42:40.460 --> 1:42:43.460]  Ha ha ha ha.
[1:42:43.460 --> 1:42:45.460]  Finally.
[1:42:45.460 --> 1:42:46.460]  Finally.
[1:42:46.460 --> 1:42:48.460]  Nothing new.
[1:42:48.460 --> 1:42:50.460]  High new.
[1:42:50.460 --> 1:42:51.460]  Black top.
[1:42:51.460 --> 1:43:16.460]  Rollin' before the asphalt.
[1:43:16.460 --> 1:43:23.460]  Now, YouTube has admitted to the BBC and others
[1:43:23.460 --> 1:43:26.460]  that they're banning anyone criticizing 5G.
[1:43:26.460 --> 1:43:29.460]  Even if you don't connect to coronavirus, they're banning it.
[1:43:29.460 --> 1:43:34.460]  But the studies do show that 5G lowers your immunity to viruses, period.
[1:43:34.460 --> 1:43:36.460]  They're peer-reviewed journals.
[1:43:36.460 --> 1:43:40.460]  We're showing these documents on air, and the globalists can go to hell.
[1:43:40.460 --> 1:43:42.460]  The human rebellion against globalists,
[1:43:42.460 --> 1:43:47.460]  machines has begun.
[1:43:47.460 --> 1:43:49.460]  We're not troglodytes afraid of technology.
[1:43:49.460 --> 1:43:53.460]  We don't like technology with Trojan horse anti-human crap in it.
[1:43:53.460 --> 1:43:58.460]  In a constant search to upgrade your favorite formulas,

[1:44:02.460 --> 1:44:05.460]  and expensive form available.

[1:44:08.460 --> 1:44:11.460]  a powerful way to get pure energy support
[1:44:11.460 --> 1:44:14.460]  for those serious about getting the B-12 they need
[1:44:14.460 --> 1:44:17.460]  to fight deficiency and reach their peak.
[1:44:17.460 --> 1:44:19.460]  The results are simple.
[1:44:19.460 --> 1:44:22.460]  Ultra-12 can help make DNA,
[1:44:22.460 --> 1:44:25.460]  help the body produce energy and blood cells,
[1:44:25.460 --> 1:44:29.460]  and support healthy nerve and brain cells.

[1:45:25.460 --> 1:45:27.460]  your parents, your grandparents, your children.

[1:46:19.460 --> 1:46:26.460]  B-12 is now being tested.
[1:46:26.460 --> 1:46:28.460]  We're seeing lots of dutiful individuals
[1:46:28.460 --> 1:46:32.460]  who've complied and submitted their whole lives believing
[1:46:32.460 --> 1:46:35.460]  if they just submit now in a bigger way,
[1:46:35.460 --> 1:46:38.460]  somehow they'll create a heavenly future.
[1:46:38.460 --> 1:46:42.460]  But the technocrats running the global system
[1:46:42.460 --> 1:46:46.460]  are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic
[1:46:46.460 --> 1:46:48.460]  and are building an anti-human future.
[1:46:48.460 --> 1:46:51.460]  Submission to them is like tying a big boulder
[1:46:51.460 --> 1:47:20.460]  on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[1:47:22.460 --> 1:47:24.460]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[1:47:24.460 --> 1:47:29.460]  Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:29.460 --> 1:47:31.460]  Alright, I'm going to go to your calls and all the news,
[1:47:31.460 --> 1:47:33.460]  but I just want to explain why I tend to get aggressive
[1:47:33.460 --> 1:47:36.460]  and jovial on air.
[1:47:36.460 --> 1:47:39.460]  When you metaphysically start with a large audience
[1:47:39.460 --> 1:47:41.460]  it's a spiritual event connecting with our souls.
[1:47:41.460 --> 1:47:43.460]  It's like a mass prayer event.
[1:47:43.460 --> 1:47:47.460]  It's scientifically proven to release incredible resonance
[1:47:47.460 --> 1:47:48.460]  within the minds, within the souls,
[1:47:48.460 --> 1:47:50.460]  within the bodies of those involved in it.
[1:47:50.460 --> 1:47:52.460]  It's just we're electrochemically connected
[1:47:52.460 --> 1:47:55.460]  and we interact with each other off those signals.
[1:47:55.460 --> 1:47:57.460]  And the system knows that.
[1:47:57.460 --> 1:47:59.460]  So they always tell you it doesn't exist, it's not happening
[1:47:59.460 --> 1:48:01.460]  because they don't want you to tap into that power
[1:48:01.460 --> 1:48:03.460]  because they want to use artificial systems
[1:48:03.460 --> 1:48:05.460]  to try to override it, but if you tap into the source
[1:48:05.460 --> 1:48:08.460]  it can absolutely modulate and just hammer back the enemy
[1:48:08.460 --> 1:48:10.460]  like nothing else.
[1:48:10.460 --> 1:48:16.460]  So when I go up against the Satanist and the globalist
[1:48:16.460 --> 1:48:19.460]  I get euphoric, I can peer into things,
[1:48:19.460 --> 1:48:28.460]  my mind speeds up and I get high on the Holy Spirit basically.
[1:48:28.460 --> 1:48:31.460]  But that is projecting through my rose-colored darkly.
[1:48:31.460 --> 1:48:34.460]  The Bible talks about my own fallen state.
[1:48:34.460 --> 1:48:38.460]  So a lot of it's good, but there's also some evil coming through
[1:48:38.460 --> 1:48:43.460]  the stained glass window from the sun outside.
[1:48:43.460 --> 1:48:46.460]  God is an archetype, but worshiping the sun.
[1:48:46.460 --> 1:48:52.460]  And that's why they get so freaked out and so upset.
[1:48:52.460 --> 1:48:54.460]  And you can do that as well.
[1:48:54.460 --> 1:48:57.460]  All of you do that and so the globalists spend all their time
[1:48:57.460 --> 1:49:00.460]  trying to suppress that incredible potential you have.
[1:49:00.460 --> 1:49:07.460]  And the more you resonate with God, the stronger you get.
[1:49:07.460 --> 1:49:10.460]  That's why they want us off the air.
[1:49:10.460 --> 1:49:17.460]  It's because when you actually start interfacing with God,
[1:49:17.460 --> 1:49:19.460]  particularly while evil is making its move,
[1:49:19.460 --> 1:49:22.460]  God comes into the universe even stronger.
[1:49:22.460 --> 1:49:23.460]  That's Newtonian physics.
[1:49:23.460 --> 1:49:24.460]  God created that.
[1:49:24.460 --> 1:49:27.460]  Newtonian physics is just a tunnel, tiny and a tunnel.
[1:49:27.460 --> 1:49:30.460]  A tiny microcosm of that.
[1:49:30.460 --> 1:49:33.460]  Every action is an opposite, equal reaction.
[1:49:33.460 --> 1:49:35.460]  So they want you to feel powerless and lay down
[1:49:35.460 --> 1:49:37.460]  when they come in to attack you.
[1:49:37.460 --> 1:49:39.460]  Even though when they're coming in to attack you
[1:49:39.460 --> 1:49:41.460]  that's when you energize.
[1:49:41.460 --> 1:49:46.460]  That's when you become your strongest.
[1:49:46.460 --> 1:49:48.460]  The enemy doesn't think multi-dimensionally.
[1:49:48.460 --> 1:49:51.460]  They think only one dimensional.
[1:49:51.460 --> 1:49:53.460]  And they're willing to do things nobody else would do
[1:49:53.460 --> 1:49:55.460]  because they're cut off from God.
[1:49:55.460 --> 1:49:58.460]  Their cancerous activity is not a symbol of their power.
[1:49:58.460 --> 1:50:01.460]  Their lack of restraint is not a symbol of their power.
[1:50:01.460 --> 1:50:03.460]  It's a symbol of their weakness.
[1:50:03.460 --> 1:50:05.460]  So I'll go to your calls.
[1:50:05.460 --> 1:50:07.460]  I just want to tell this or something
[1:50:07.460 --> 1:50:09.460]  and I'll be completely honest with you.
[1:50:09.460 --> 1:50:11.460]  If I would have gone on air
[1:50:11.460 --> 1:50:13.460]  and said tens of millions are going to die
[1:50:13.460 --> 1:50:15.460]  and it's the end of the world,
[1:50:15.460 --> 1:50:17.460]  we would have sold five, ten times more
[1:50:17.460 --> 1:50:19.460]  storable foods and more supplements.
[1:50:19.460 --> 1:50:21.460]  I said the globalists are making their move.
[1:50:21.460 --> 1:50:23.460]  You're going to try to start massive wars,
[1:50:23.460 --> 1:50:24.460]  probably with Taiwan.
[1:50:24.460 --> 1:50:26.460]  Depression, you name it, you should get ready
[1:50:26.460 --> 1:50:27.460]  because of that.
[1:50:27.460 --> 1:50:30.460]  And sure, 100,000, 200,000 might die.
[1:50:30.460 --> 1:50:32.460]  Looks like those original numbers,
[1:50:32.460 --> 1:50:35.460]  100,000, 80,000 or so, still terrible.
[1:50:35.460 --> 1:50:37.460]  But the freaking out and getting hysterical
[1:50:37.460 --> 1:50:40.460]  and having phobias about it and shutting everything down
[1:50:40.460 --> 1:50:42.460]  will kill hundreds of millions in the next few years.
[1:50:42.460 --> 1:50:43.460]  I've got all the articles.
[1:50:43.460 --> 1:50:45.460]  Every time I take calls, I'll cover them.
[1:50:45.460 --> 1:50:47.460]  So the virus is real,
[1:50:47.460 --> 1:50:49.460]  but hyped up to create the hysteria.
[1:50:49.460 --> 1:50:51.460]  I know you get that.
[1:50:51.460 --> 1:50:54.460]  And sure, my issues with funding and expanding
[1:50:54.460 --> 1:50:56.460]  would be handled if I just got up here
[1:50:56.460 --> 1:50:59.460]  and said, you know, it's the end of the world, get this now.
[1:50:59.460 --> 1:51:01.460]  They've even had paradoxical articles,
[1:51:01.460 --> 1:51:03.460]  and Mother Jones and others going,
[1:51:03.460 --> 1:51:05.460]  Mother Jones has coronavirus cures,
[1:51:05.460 --> 1:51:07.460]  which I don't have, I didn't say.
[1:51:07.460 --> 1:51:08.460]  But it's weird.
[1:51:08.460 --> 1:51:11.460]  In the same breath, he says it's not a big crisis
[1:51:11.460 --> 1:51:13.460]  and that it's overblown.
[1:51:13.460 --> 1:51:14.460]  Exactly.
[1:51:14.460 --> 1:51:15.460]  If I was really saying that,
[1:51:15.460 --> 1:51:16.460]  then I would say I had a cure.
[1:51:16.460 --> 1:51:18.460]  I was this immoral person.
[1:51:18.460 --> 1:51:21.460]  So again, they can't even get their BS together, folks.
[1:51:21.460 --> 1:51:25.460]  Nothing I advertise is meant to treat
[1:51:25.460 --> 1:51:27.460]  or cure coronavirus.
[1:51:27.460 --> 1:51:29.460]  That's all a hoax,
[1:51:29.460 --> 1:51:31.460]  because once you get it,
[1:51:31.460 --> 1:51:34.460]  once it's able to replicate according to everything I've read and seen,
[1:51:34.460 --> 1:51:36.460]  that's when you've got a big problem.
[1:51:36.460 --> 1:51:38.460]  But what do the doctors, everybody, talk about?
[1:51:38.460 --> 1:51:40.460]  They talk about zinc.
[1:51:40.460 --> 1:51:42.460]  They talk about vitamin C.
[1:51:42.460 --> 1:51:43.460]  They talk about vitamin D3.
[1:51:43.460 --> 1:51:44.460]  They talk about vitamin K.
[1:51:44.460 --> 1:51:45.460]  They talk about vitamin A.
[1:51:45.460 --> 1:51:47.460]  They talk about sunlight.
[1:51:47.460 --> 1:51:50.460]  And so get it wherever you do or however you do it.
[1:51:50.460 --> 1:51:52.460]  All I know is it's not a panacea.
[1:51:52.460 --> 1:51:55.460]  It's not a silver bullet.
[1:51:55.460 --> 1:51:57.460]  But I've been sick one time the last five years,
[1:51:57.460 --> 1:52:01.460]  and it's because I exercise.
[1:52:01.460 --> 1:52:02.460]  I drink a lot of water.
[1:52:02.460 --> 1:52:03.460]  I'm very positive.
[1:52:03.460 --> 1:52:05.460]  And I take a lot of vitamins and minerals.
[1:52:05.460 --> 1:52:07.460]  And I see the difference between my children
[1:52:07.460 --> 1:52:10.460]  and other people's children that don't take organic vitamins.
[1:52:10.460 --> 1:52:12.460]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[1:52:12.460 --> 1:52:13.460]  Real Red Pill.
[1:52:13.460 --> 1:52:14.460]  Still available.
[1:52:14.460 --> 1:52:16.460]  High quality, multi-vitamin mineral.
[1:52:16.460 --> 1:52:19.460]  We have the
[1:52:19.460 --> 1:52:22.460]  vitamin mineral fusion, advanced multi-vitamin formulation
[1:52:22.460 --> 1:52:23.460]  with the amino acids.
[1:52:23.460 --> 1:52:24.460]  Good for adults and children.
[1:52:24.460 --> 1:52:25.460]  Real Red Pill.
[1:52:25.460 --> 1:52:26.460]  Real Red Pill Plus is for adults.
[1:52:26.460 --> 1:52:27.460]  We have the vitamin mineral.
[1:52:27.460 --> 1:52:28.460]  We have the X3.
[1:52:28.460 --> 1:52:29.460]  It's going to sell out.
[1:52:29.460 --> 1:52:30.460]  It's great for your body.
[1:52:30.460 --> 1:52:31.460]  Get that.
[1:52:31.460 --> 1:52:33.460]  We have a lot of other great products like DNA Force Plus.
[1:52:33.460 --> 1:52:35.460]  That was one thing I was going to take.
[1:52:35.460 --> 1:52:37.460]  I don't know if it would be the iodine or the DNA Force Plus.
[1:52:37.460 --> 1:52:39.460]  I mean, they're both just so amazing.
[1:52:39.460 --> 1:52:41.460]  But that's also how you fund the operation.
[1:52:41.460 --> 1:52:44.460]  So, if there wasn't this crisis going on,
[1:52:44.460 --> 1:52:46.460]  I'm saying, hey, folks,
[1:52:46.460 --> 1:52:48.460]  you need to boost your body's natural defenses
[1:52:48.460 --> 1:52:49.460]  with all the craziness going on.
[1:52:49.460 --> 1:52:50.460]  These are the building blocks
[1:52:50.460 --> 1:52:53.460]  that are essential in your body.
[1:52:53.460 --> 1:52:55.460]  So the fact that we've got one of the best
[1:52:55.460 --> 1:53:00.940]  PQQ CoQ 10 formulas out there is a reason for you to get it from us if I wasn't a talk show
[1:53:00.940 --> 1:53:04.820]  host telling the truth and exposing the globalist and creating the counter narrative talking
[1:53:04.820 --> 1:53:09.940]  points for patriots in the White House and other agencies spontaneously recognize this
[1:53:09.940 --> 1:53:17.500]  is true as an oracle as a fount of the people's knowledge the guests the callers myself it's
[1:53:17.500 --> 1:53:23.340]  real folks we really don't we're talking about we have a sense of things so keep us in the
[1:53:23.340 --> 1:53:27.660]  game get your products at info or store.com get your books get your t-shirts get your
[1:53:27.660 --> 1:53:31.580]  films go there shop and that's how you fund the operation I want to thank all of you that
[1:53:31.580 --> 1:53:34.860]  have been shopping there and supporting the transmission because without you we wouldn't
[1:53:34.860 --> 1:53:39.620]  be on air and the best shows I do is when I don't plug and then no money comes in they're
[1:53:39.620 --> 1:53:44.980]  like hey we were doing okay but now we're kind of getting low again don't lay us off please
[1:53:44.980 --> 1:53:49.220]  I want to expand I wanted to put more reporters in the field there's a lot of folks we sponsor
[1:53:49.220 --> 1:53:55.340]  because of the platforming we don't say we sponsor them but believe me it's not exaggerate
[1:53:55.340 --> 1:53:59.700]  you see the reporters rule we got it's ten times that both people around or even know
[1:53:59.700 --> 1:54:04.180]  who we sponsor that's secret stuff so they don't get persecuted a lot of folks we sponsor
[1:54:04.180 --> 1:54:11.380]  there's not even a plug for M4s it is a pure absolute donation to keep people in the field
[1:54:11.380 --> 1:54:13.860]  and then of course they can give us a little bit of help here and there when we need it
[1:54:13.860 --> 1:54:20.700]  as well so there's nowhere you can fund the resistance like M4s you talk about behind
[1:54:20.700 --> 1:54:24.620]  the scenes underground stuff we're we're above ground we're below ground we're doing it all
[1:54:24.620 --> 1:54:27.700]  because that's our mission is to fight a hundred and ten percent I'm gonna die or get put in
[1:54:27.700 --> 1:54:30.820]  prison doing this I'm gonna fight to win and I am fighting to win I want to thank you all
[1:54:30.820 --> 1:54:34.460]  for keeping me in the game okay folks we're holding 30 minutes I'm gonna go to you now
[1:54:34.460 --> 1:54:38.380]  who's roll along as we got Paul and Joe and David and Don and Daniel and Trevor and Alex
[1:54:38.380 --> 1:54:43.380]  and Marcus and James and Jason everybody else let's go ahead and go to David in California
[1:54:43.380 --> 1:54:49.580]  you're on the air welcome thanks for holding the Oracle of Austin Mr. Jones I hope you're
[1:54:49.580 --> 1:54:53.940]  doing well you're stressful time I'm alright my friend but I'm certainly in the war just
[1:54:53.940 --> 1:54:58.580]  like you are brother how are you doing I'm doing alright got my bags on right now still
[1:54:58.580 --> 1:55:03.260]  trying to hammer it out out here this coronavirus ain't stopping us and taking my precautions
[1:55:03.260 --> 1:55:07.700]  in my zinc but you know what we're still out here hammering away beautiful brother what's
[1:55:07.700 --> 1:55:10.860]  on your mind today about China Bill Gates trade wars attack against Trump that's what
[1:55:10.860 --> 1:55:18.020]  I see on the board yeah so basically it's just kind of coincidental that you get somebody
[1:55:18.020 --> 1:55:23.860]  like Bill Gates who you know the media and box they try to come out and promote as the
[1:55:23.860 --> 1:55:31.900]  savior of you know this whole situation but I get the feeling that it's more so basically
[1:55:31.900 --> 1:55:37.140]  showing you who's exactly responsible for the whole thing I mean obviously the people
[1:55:37.140 --> 1:55:41.460]  behind are the ones that are up there as the savior I mean his fingerprints are all over
[1:55:41.460 --> 1:55:47.780]  it he's suspect number one he has an history he's all over it he stands to gain he's grandstanding
[1:55:47.780 --> 1:55:52.780]  and now he's got a force inoculation for you yeah and you got governor Cuomo saying they're
[1:55:52.780 --> 1:55:58.420]  not going to allow people back out in the public unless they take an antibody test that to me
[1:55:58.420 --> 1:56:02.780]  just kind of shows me the trajectory and I think what the next is forced vaccinations
[1:56:02.780 --> 1:56:07.340]  oh sir they've said in England Europe they said here now Gates has said you're not going
[1:56:07.340 --> 1:56:10.300]  to be able to go to a mass gathering unless you've had a vaccine or have a job you're
[1:56:10.300 --> 1:56:13.620]  going to go to a store and they're going to want it on your iPhone did you hear last
[1:56:13.620 --> 1:56:17.660]  week Google and Apple merged to create a new ID to make sure you've been vaccinated and
[1:56:17.660 --> 1:56:23.020]  they're tracking you in live time and then you got China who's basically reaping the
[1:56:23.020 --> 1:56:27.940]  rewards of this whole situation they're losing a trade war soon as Trump came in and leveled
[1:56:27.940 --> 1:56:32.780]  the playing field they started losing the trade war and you know it just coincidental that
[1:56:32.780 --> 1:56:35.940]  you know this whole thing happened and now look where they're at they took minimal damage
[1:56:35.940 --> 1:56:40.380]  in their stock markets while we're over here dealing with our own media praise easy payment
[1:56:40.380 --> 1:56:43.940]  says Trump's with a bad job did you see all the articles where they now admit that the
[1:56:43.940 --> 1:56:48.460]  U.S. government Obama gave them these viruses and they did all this testing they're using
[1:56:48.460 --> 1:56:53.380]  that as blackmail now against Trump you say of course Obama did it arrest Obama there's
[1:56:53.380 --> 1:56:58.420]  no more playing patty cake with this yet like you said it's time to take action kind
[1:56:58.420 --> 1:57:03.540]  of take the gloves on I had one quick question before I let you go but I had to ask about
[1:57:03.540 --> 1:57:08.060]  the children's fish oil the honor roll when is that supposed to come back up you know
[1:57:08.060 --> 1:57:12.260]  it's a great little small pill of high quality fish oil we have not reordered it we need to
[1:57:12.260 --> 1:57:16.100]  reorder it it becomes a financial issue like I told people last year I said I can't keep
[1:57:16.100 --> 1:57:20.700]  doing so 50% off because then that's like a 30% markup we can't fund to buy it again
[1:57:20.700 --> 1:57:24.820]  we haven't repurchased it yet and you're right it's hard for kids to swallow the big
[1:57:24.820 --> 1:57:29.660]  fish oils by the way I think krill oil is back in we haven't relaunched that krill
[1:57:29.660 --> 1:57:34.140]  oil is the very best out there but thank you sir God bless you and that's how we stay on
[1:57:34.140 --> 1:57:38.380]  air and they can't stand it info wars like the mascot against the enemy you did it listeners

[1:58:40.420 --> 1:58:52.740]  store dot com the virus and all of the hype is designed to destroy one thing confidence
[1:58:52.740 --> 1:58:58.460]  it's confidence in an economy confidence in a culture confidence in the direction the
[1:58:58.460 --> 1:59:03.700]  civilization and the people are going that causes people to work hard and believe in
[1:59:03.700 --> 1:59:09.580]  the future and invest its spirit and the entire media and the entire culture and all these
[1:59:09.580 --> 1:59:14.740]  multinational governments in the UN the WHO and the chai comms in Hollywood have been
[1:59:14.740 --> 1:59:23.740]  having orgasmic delight over how pliantly everyone has gotten into a state of fear yes
[1:59:23.740 --> 1:59:29.380]  the virus is real it's going to be maybe double what the flu is normally and it's a bio weapon
[1:59:29.380 --> 1:59:35.620]  but a bio weapon the globalist do the trajectory of but it's real target is confidence in the
[1:59:35.620 --> 1:59:40.540]  economy and that's why recognizing that it's an attempt to scare us in a submission is
[1:59:40.540 --> 1:59:48.780]  critical because then people will understand the real paradigm you're listening to the
[1:59:48.780 --> 2:00:11.420]  alex jones show the wicked flea when none pursue welcome back to your phone calls we
[2:00:11.420 --> 2:00:20.980]  have the pooled shocking microsoft ad that actually worshiped and admitted high priestess
[2:00:20.980 --> 2:00:29.820]  of alice are probably devil worship and blood drinking coming up and a lot of other news
[2:00:29.820 --> 2:00:35.900]  but does anybody care that communist china is now fingering the u.s. for giving them
[2:00:35.900 --> 2:00:41.220]  the coronavirus admitting it came out of the lab and that's a major blackmail going on
[2:00:41.220 --> 2:00:45.060]  he told you the state's involved trump's not involved he can defeat the deep state and
[2:00:45.060 --> 2:00:50.100]  the chai comms by exposing that anytime trevor in wisconsin thanks for holding sir on here
[2:00:50.100 --> 2:00:56.860]  well yes alex two thumbs up to david night show this morning always over the top was
[2:00:56.860 --> 2:01:03.220]  always and my question to you is that you say you talk to trump trump listens to you
[2:01:03.220 --> 2:01:10.900]  show but ever since january you and dr. boyle's been laying out all the crimes against obama
[2:01:10.900 --> 2:01:16.980]  laying out all the crimes against falchi the cdc and everything how come trump is listening
[2:01:16.980 --> 2:01:21.380]  to falchi when he already knows this stuff that he has these crimes and how come he hasn't
[2:01:21.380 --> 2:01:25.860]  arrested him yet because it seems to me though that the way it looks to me that if he hasn't
[2:01:25.860 --> 2:01:30.580]  arrested these people that he's supporting this two tiered justice system that you see
[2:01:30.580 --> 2:01:39.300]  in america we're gonna play a clip in a moment of falchi in 2017 saying trump will be faced
[2:01:39.300 --> 2:01:44.180]  with a major biological crisis and now trump's talking about firing falchi this is how it
[2:01:44.180 --> 2:01:48.140]  works trump has got all these agencies all these things under him he's just busy trying
[2:01:48.140 --> 2:01:51.340]  to turn the economy on you know that they kept him distracted with russia gate ukraine
[2:01:51.340 --> 2:01:55.060]  gate all that and and trump hasn't called me in a long time he's called a few times
[2:01:55.060 --> 2:01:58.060]  i missed the call but i haven't talked to trump in a long time with that a few people
[2:01:58.060 --> 2:02:01.140]  that work with trump call up and say hey the president's gonna tweet some stuff what do
[2:02:01.140 --> 2:02:04.300]  you think we should tweet and i said them some stuff and you know they picked one of them
[2:02:04.300 --> 2:02:07.460]  to tweet two other things that's kind of like the paddle in my head that's fine i appreciate
[2:02:07.460 --> 2:02:11.540]  it didn't ask for that you know i was like trump get off your ass and fight in that censorship
[2:02:11.540 --> 2:02:16.580]  and you know a guy calls up and works with the president says hey he's gonna tweet some
[2:02:16.580 --> 2:02:20.700]  of your stuff tonight he's on and he's trying what do you want it's kind of like like hey
[2:02:20.700 --> 2:02:26.580]  i'm still here don't worry press the plan and not in a queue way but if he fires falchi
[2:02:26.580 --> 2:02:30.860]  once he gets into it and falchi lies to him and says sir no problem you know three months
[2:02:30.860 --> 2:02:36.180]  ago two months ago sir no problem even in february and then suddenly turns on him then
[2:02:36.180 --> 2:02:40.780]  trump learns about it now says i don't want any never trumpers i don't want any sorrows
[2:02:40.780 --> 2:02:44.780]  people i don't want any democrats now he says they're himself and googles their name that's
[2:02:44.780 --> 2:02:50.180]  why they're so pissed he's becoming the president so trumps not perfect but in defense i have
[2:02:50.180 --> 2:02:54.340]  about a hundred crew members you know a nice janitor custodial and you know accounting
[2:02:54.340 --> 2:02:59.980]  and and and editors and researchers and customer service and and you know there's a hundred
[2:02:59.980 --> 2:03:04.300]  people about if a couple of them turn against you without me know and they can wreak havoc
[2:03:04.300 --> 2:03:07.540]  in there we've had that before with operatives got a great crew now it's it's it's clean
[2:03:07.540 --> 2:03:13.340]  as they say they put up with my crap uh i'm her biggest asset our biggest you know deficit
[2:03:13.340 --> 2:03:17.380]  at the same time so i gotta i got a great crew but imagine the president with millions
[2:03:17.380 --> 2:03:21.940]  of people under i mean he's just counting on what generals tell him and what heads of
[2:03:21.940 --> 2:03:27.100]  agencies tell him and then falchi knows that trump doesn't watch CNN and stuff a lot so
[2:03:27.100 --> 2:03:30.940]  he'll run over our msmc talk crap by the president on that channel and run back over
[2:03:30.940 --> 2:03:35.900]  here and then trump gets it and so trumps now seeing falchi talk smack about him and
[2:03:35.900 --> 2:03:40.020]  lie about him and so yeah falchi is on his way out he just doesn't want when they built
[2:03:40.020 --> 2:03:44.700]  falchi up like a god to get rid of him without a reason or then it hurts the stock market
[2:03:44.700 --> 2:03:49.220]  so trump trump has got a balancing act but but at this point with the globalists in with
[2:03:49.220 --> 2:03:53.460]  the chai comms and launching bio attacks and trying to kill the economy gloves got to come
[2:03:53.460 --> 2:03:57.620]  off people want strength they want action trump doesn't want to be a dictator we know
[2:03:57.620 --> 2:04:00.260]  he's fighting the globalists and we're not going to get mad they're always calling him
[2:04:00.260 --> 2:04:04.660]  a dictator because they're dictators they're with the damn chinese communists and so if
[2:04:04.660 --> 2:04:08.940]  they were citizens and if they were americans pulling this i'd say hey if it's illegal
[2:04:08.940 --> 2:04:13.380]  indict them but when it's chai comms and globalists trying to they were about to invade taiwan
[2:04:13.380 --> 2:04:18.780]  and they're like i mean we're here this is like if hitler had spies on our government
[2:04:18.780 --> 2:04:24.740]  they were openly saying we want hitler to crush trump or we want hitler to crush crush a roosevelt
[2:04:24.740 --> 2:04:28.540]  in 1941 when the war already started no one would put up with that but the washington
[2:04:28.540 --> 2:04:34.620]  post is gg ping must destroy trump now it's not americans they're anti americans that
[2:04:34.620 --> 2:04:40.540]  say no borders no wall no u.s.a. at all so trump is surrounded i'm surprised he's done
[2:04:40.540 --> 2:04:45.100]  this good i get pissed at him like a baby insta gratification then i'm like wait a minute
[2:04:45.100 --> 2:04:48.340]  jones you know what it's like to run stuff at a small level and i'm just like how's he
[2:04:48.340 --> 2:04:54.460]  even doing this he's like a superhero i'm not going to sit here and waste your time
[2:04:54.460 --> 2:05:01.060]  on my time and rattle off the successes and full versus that if you're paying attention
[2:05:01.060 --> 2:05:08.380]  you know we've done together but i'll tell you this the technocrats are really upping
[2:05:08.380 --> 2:05:13.780]  their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media they're trying
[2:05:13.780 --> 2:05:19.460]  to shudder and silence human resistance so now is the time to understand that everything
[2:05:19.460 --> 2:05:22.860]  we've talked about has been proven accurate everything you warned your friends and family
[2:05:22.860 --> 2:05:28.060]  about us are going to be true so it's now that your credibility is way up the power structure
[2:05:28.060 --> 2:05:34.940]  is going to silence those of us that they can't let it up to all of us to not let them silence
[2:05:34.940 --> 2:05:42.420]  any of us we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech
[2:05:42.420 --> 2:05:46.900]  we have to make sure that we find our right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't
[2:05:46.900 --> 2:06:08.260]  come so be the polar bearers you are
[2:06:08.260 --> 2:06:14.540]  160 almost 160 million jobs in this country now the most ever by far by far the most ever
[2:06:14.540 --> 2:06:21.260]  the number of jobs almost 160 million so we can't turn that off and i think it's going
[2:06:21.260 --> 2:06:26.420]  to be wonderful there'll be tremendous repercussions there will be a tremendous death from that
[2:06:26.420 --> 2:06:32.260]  death you know you're talking about death probably more death from that than anything
[2:06:32.260 --> 2:06:50.900]  that we're talking about with respect to the virus
[2:06:50.900 --> 2:06:54.940]  America is under globalist attack publicly the chai comms with the deep state launch
[2:06:54.940 --> 2:07:00.140]  covid-19 you now are seeing that mainline news the defense department knows that happened
[2:07:00.140 --> 2:07:03.780]  that's why china said screw it they're preparing to invade taiwan they've got ships massing
[2:07:03.780 --> 2:07:09.100]  around it and off the coast of japan they said they're now preparing a physical phase
[2:07:09.100 --> 2:07:14.340]  for physical invasion that got almost no news because most of our media is bought off and
[2:07:14.340 --> 2:07:19.140]  paid for by the globalist who are allied with china does a greatness service to say it's
[2:07:19.140 --> 2:07:27.540]  just china no china has been set up as a proxy for the new world order of course we reported
[2:07:27.540 --> 2:07:34.220]  last year china's secret plan to invade taiwan by 2020 actually 2017 well now that's been
[2:07:34.220 --> 2:07:39.820]  announced and almost no coverage of that all right i'm gonna go back to your calls here
[2:07:39.820 --> 2:07:42.700]  and then at the bottom of the hour i will get into what trump was just talking about
[2:07:42.700 --> 2:07:46.900]  a month ago the death caused by the shutdown so you want to talk about death starvation
[2:07:46.900 --> 2:07:52.620]  it's not as sexy as a virus but people in africa latin america asia the middle east
[2:07:52.620 --> 2:07:57.740]  already started by the millions because of this depression half the planet lives at a
[2:07:57.740 --> 2:08:01.540]  subsistence level 2 billion right at starvation that's the unzone numbers i'll show it all
[2:08:01.540 --> 2:08:08.660]  to you so when the pope says it's mother earth cleansing the planet that's pagan by the way
[2:08:08.660 --> 2:08:20.940]  not christian and not original christian as the term catholic would mean catholic catholicism
[2:08:20.940 --> 2:08:23.500]  when he talks about that well i guess the earth with the globalist cutting the food
[2:08:23.500 --> 2:08:29.260]  off is about to cleanse the third world totally sick so what you have is satanist taking over
[2:08:29.260 --> 2:08:39.780]  everywhere well marina a bravic is a high priest in the allister crally loser club and
[2:08:39.780 --> 2:08:43.900]  she told reddit forums that know her rituals are real she's an occultist and she you know
[2:08:43.900 --> 2:08:49.020]  holds these satanic covens and she hangs out of course with pedesta and his brother that
[2:08:49.020 --> 2:08:54.900]  publicly promotes pedophilia tony podesta in the washington post 2007 that's the lesser
[2:08:54.900 --> 2:09:03.580]  magic to externalize the hierarchy in the method and so they put out last night a video
[2:09:03.580 --> 2:09:10.860]  that got 99 percent down votes on youtube with a microsoft ad talking about oh since
[2:09:10.860 --> 2:09:18.380]  you're locked at home wear these vr goggles and you can see her you can see a tubby witch
[2:09:18.380 --> 2:09:23.540]  in a red dress laying in a pentagram but they didn't tell you all that they tell you dial
[2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:27.500]  into her app not telling you it's satanism so i thought we'd actually show you when
[2:09:27.500 --> 2:09:32.700]  you go to the app because they're not telling everybody watching this all over cnn fox news
[2:09:32.700 --> 2:09:38.060]  or in the sad that hey when you go there this woman drinks blood and they collect women's
[2:09:38.060 --> 2:09:43.900]  semen men's semen and women's milk and the rituals and she's in the spirit cooking witchy
[2:09:43.900 --> 2:09:47.860]  leaks and all this you know they don't tell you any of that but again why would bill gates
[2:09:47.860 --> 2:09:54.220]  be doing that let's show him first on screen bill gates is best buddies with jeffrey upsting
[2:09:54.220 --> 2:09:58.020]  and he lived with him when he would come to new york there is a larry summers and other
[2:09:58.020 --> 2:10:05.100]  weirdos and there they all are so there's there's there's bill gates and there's jeffrey
[2:10:05.100 --> 2:10:12.540]  upsting and carry out secret cloning programs and that's who these dudes are so when your
[2:10:12.540 --> 2:10:20.940]  daughter comes up missing well just remember so you can also type of bill gates in this
[2:10:20.940 --> 2:10:24.860]  brown of a character in the rest of them but this is who they worship and the fact that
[2:10:24.860 --> 2:10:29.940]  they thought they'd put this out and it wouldn't blow up on them just like bill gates is totally
[2:10:29.940 --> 2:10:35.300]  hated on his facebook his instagram 99 percent negative the good news is their bs isn't selling
[2:10:35.300 --> 2:10:39.700]  it may sell with some of the yuppies and people that want to stay on the watch netflix but
[2:10:39.700 --> 2:10:43.540]  we know it's starving it as a third world we know it's overall a bunch of hype and the
[2:10:43.540 --> 2:10:47.940]  world's waking up you know a lie goes halfway around the world or truth puts its pants on
[2:10:47.940 --> 2:10:52.740]  is mark twain once said he's absolutely right so here is the ad that that they pulled after
[2:10:52.740 --> 2:11:01.340]  it was up a day over a million views on youtube 99 percent negative and they pulled it but
[2:11:01.340 --> 2:11:10.260]  uh we've actually updated it upgraded it here it is i believe that art of the future is
[2:11:10.260 --> 2:11:18.940]  art without objects it's just pure transmission of energy between the viewer and artists to
[2:11:18.940 --> 2:11:30.460]  me mixed reality is this answer this was a unique opportunity to take the most legendary
[2:11:30.460 --> 2:11:40.340]  artist working now and cash of them in such a way that they are translatable if you're
[2:11:40.340 --> 2:11:44.980]  a collector you're trying to find works that break new ground we here at christie's believe
[2:11:44.980 --> 2:11:50.820]  that this is that and it will be the first time that a mixed reality artwork is sold
[2:11:50.820 --> 2:11:54.980]  at auction there was always questionable to buy when you buy performance you buy the
[2:11:54.980 --> 2:12:00.940]  video back it up play for the beginning again they have to put value on something worthless
[2:12:00.940 --> 2:12:03.740]  i remember reading an article the wall street journal like 20 something years ago it was
[2:12:03.740 --> 2:12:10.020]  like why do these rich wall street people pay $50 million for a bloody skull semen on
[2:12:10.020 --> 2:12:14.660]  it and they go well it's just part of how we blow money and how they're starving children
[2:12:14.660 --> 2:12:19.060]  we don't help them it's part of us being powerful remember the clips i played a major comedians
[2:12:19.060 --> 2:12:23.780]  and so-called you know leftist going i killed my baby i waited until she was eight months
[2:12:23.780 --> 2:12:27.700]  old and i she had a whole future and i enjoyed snuffing her out because it's about me playing
[2:12:27.700 --> 2:12:33.420]  god remember all those clips i played not just michelle wolf but a bunch of them that's
[2:12:33.420 --> 2:12:42.020]  all this is it's like we're going to worship some hunchback creature who is publicly the
[2:12:42.020 --> 2:12:48.020]  allister crowley head head lady it's like potbelly demon allister crowley why are you
[2:12:48.020 --> 2:12:53.740]  working it's it's part of the joke you worship the fallen you worship the ugly that's greedy
[2:12:53.740 --> 2:12:59.420]  and feeds on people and then she's at the center of the spirit cooking and podesta and
[2:12:59.420 --> 2:13:03.860]  and promises delivering little kids to them and people are like whoa what is this here
[2:13:03.860 --> 2:13:14.300]  it is i believe that art of the future is art without objects is it just pure transmission
[2:13:14.300 --> 2:13:27.420]  of energy between the viewer and artists to me mixed reality is this answer this was a
[2:13:27.420 --> 2:13:34.100]  you know they're claiming that if it's vr it's real reality oh oh oh it's up here when
[2:13:34.100 --> 2:13:40.540]  you look at me and gaga it better than anything you get all of it's a fraud let's tell you
[2:13:40.540 --> 2:13:49.180]  capture them in such a way that they are translatable forever if you're a collector you're trying
[2:13:49.180 --> 2:13:57.820]  to find works that raises that and it will be the first time that a mixed reality artwork
[2:13:57.820 --> 2:14:02.460]  is sold at auction there was always question what you buy when you buy performance you buy
[2:14:02.460 --> 2:14:08.620]  the video or you buy the additional photographs here you actually can have the artist presence
[2:14:08.620 --> 2:14:15.740]  in your collection you had to figure out why you had to feel that you were in the room
[2:14:15.740 --> 2:14:21.420]  with marina not a demon appears marina let's call me a ritual was created by people who
[2:14:21.420 --> 2:14:27.060]  quite clearly have an interest in seeing the demon look at these nerds we want to be these
[2:14:27.060 --> 2:14:42.260]  people so the purest expression of artistic and purestness is these nerds you can be like
[2:14:42.260 --> 2:14:58.100]  a bunch of decadent crazy drugged out women simulating a human murder and sat on one bowling
[2:14:58.100 --> 2:15:03.060]  down or a bunch of empty jokes because the work of art can continue in performance the
[2:15:03.060 --> 2:15:13.540]  piece is only in the memory of the audience and nowhere else here i am kept forever yeah i am kept forever
[2:15:13.540 --> 2:15:17.140]  that's the scam that you're uploaded digitally this big mind that's the beginning of that
[2:15:17.140 --> 2:15:23.460]  and then they all move also like oh we have something you don't have oh we we put vr goggles
[2:15:23.460 --> 2:15:30.820]  on you worship fat woman in red dress look i drink blood does it make you scared of me
[2:15:30.820 --> 2:15:40.500]  you know i give you a special power to destroy children and oh it sounds like fentanyl hello

[2:20:29.540 --> 2:20:34.180]  global martial law lockdown now taking place and notice they're saying it's been going for years
[2:20:34.180 --> 2:20:40.500]  it never ends china's open for business the bio weapon release the plan to bring us down complete

[2:20:44.580 --> 2:20:51.540]  on this hour in the third world but that's okay because it gives power to the beast the power to
[2:20:51.540 --> 2:20:57.140]  bill gates power to the globalist and our subservience to them gives them power over so it's time for
[2:20:57.140 --> 2:21:03.460]  that to stop let's go to your calls right now who's been holding longest now joe in new jersey joe
[2:21:03.460 --> 2:21:10.580]  you're on the air welcome hey alex i just wanted to say that you know as the chinese are preparing
[2:21:10.580 --> 2:21:15.940]  to go to war with us and the u.s. students saying that they're also destroying inside
[2:21:15.940 --> 2:21:21.940]  and instead of fighting a two-front war like we did and war war two we'll fight an internal war
[2:21:21.940 --> 2:21:27.780]  with each other where mass food uh people won't be able to eat food you'll be sure yeah because they
[2:21:27.780 --> 2:21:32.500]  have so many collaborators in the government and in the media that they're they're even bragging
[2:21:32.500 --> 2:21:36.900]  they're doing this stuff that america's in war right now and we're losing uh because president
[2:21:36.900 --> 2:21:41.060]  trump doesn't just rally the public and say look the democrats are chi-com agents i'm sorry we'll
[2:21:41.060 --> 2:21:45.780]  fix the stock market later uh they're going to destroy everything this is all a giant hoax a
[2:21:45.780 --> 2:21:50.580]  fear i mean yeah the virus is real but the way they're this flu kills us many there it's disproportionate
[2:21:50.580 --> 2:21:54.900]  they're hyping it it's all done by design and notice the democrats love it they can't even contain
[2:21:54.900 --> 2:22:02.420]  their glee that's right and and you know they have they have bill gates who supposedly invented
[2:22:02.420 --> 2:22:08.260]  something great through microsoft supposedly and he's telling everybody who's not he's not a doctor
[2:22:08.260 --> 2:22:12.820]  and he's telling everybody get your vaccines do this why are we listening to him he's not he's not
[2:22:12.820 --> 2:22:19.140]  a doctor and if he wants it's your choice well that greg reese video that i've worked with him on
[2:22:19.140 --> 2:22:25.700]  he did an excellent job communist party china fires warning shot at globalist collaborators for
[2:22:25.700 --> 2:22:31.140]  covet 19 it's on news wars dot com and full wars dot com and band off video it is so important to
[2:22:31.140 --> 2:22:37.780]  get out because just in three minutes it lays out i mean how big is it that china now admits
[2:22:38.340 --> 2:22:43.140]  that they got grants from obama to develop covet 19 that that's admitted now they're saying that
[2:22:43.140 --> 2:22:47.220]  to get trump off their back no that doesn't get trump off your back because you get it with a
[2:22:47.220 --> 2:22:52.740]  deep state that wants this and is openly promoting you i mean this is like puts all the pieces together
[2:22:53.300 --> 2:22:57.460]  oh they love it they're just thrown in our face and everyone who's not awake they're
[2:22:57.460 --> 2:23:01.540]  but they're eating into it they're buying into them or into the trump the economy and and and
[2:23:01.540 --> 2:23:05.620]  what's out you say and the chinese are just laughing all the way because they're just
[2:23:05.620 --> 2:23:10.500]  throwing it all back in our face saying hey two internal people did this too again they're working
[2:23:10.500 --> 2:23:15.380]  with us against you and no one's seeing it all well you know it works for the america and we pray
[2:23:15.380 --> 2:23:20.340]  and get right with god we always lose the first quarter but we win by the halftime and by the
[2:23:20.340 --> 2:23:24.100]  halftime things have turned the enemy scared and and i don't i'm not against the chinese people
[2:23:24.100 --> 2:23:29.300]  but the chikams were put in by david rockefeller on record and they are absolutely evil they've
[2:23:29.300 --> 2:23:34.100]  got to be defeated and america now gets it they're not going to stop trying to impeach the president
[2:23:34.100 --> 2:23:38.260]  they're going to try to wreck the economy and overthrow stuff and have a depression you want
[2:23:38.260 --> 2:23:42.980]  you want to see death as the president said this will cause a critical segment last segment please
[2:23:42.980 --> 2:23:47.460]  tune in then folks please share it my god there are so many people if you could be in one of those
[2:23:47.460 --> 2:23:51.700]  villages is one of the hardworking mothers and fathers that you know have their own business
[2:23:51.700 --> 2:23:56.180]  and you know have a couple cows and are raising things and rebels come through the globalist
[2:23:56.180 --> 2:24:01.460]  fun of the chikams fun and kill their cows and now you know they're living subsistence as fisherman
[2:24:01.460 --> 2:24:06.820]  or whatever and they barely got enough food and they get sick and they die and you don't hear
[2:24:06.820 --> 2:24:12.020]  about their names because maybe dad or mom works at local flower market where they grow a lot of
[2:24:12.020 --> 2:24:16.660]  flowers in africa the ship to europe those have been shut down with this and so that maybe half
[2:24:16.660 --> 2:24:21.220]  a dollar a day he earned that he could get medicine or maybe a book once a year for his kids or maybe
[2:24:21.220 --> 2:24:28.500]  a pair of shoes for his kids once a year you know the kids pass the shoes on instead they die and
[2:24:28.500 --> 2:24:32.020]  then that's why i've been so pissed and felt like i should come on air in the first hour and say
[2:24:32.740 --> 2:24:38.180]  this is war we bet the president better start getting serious because i feel guilty that i haven't
[2:24:38.180 --> 2:24:42.100]  done enough i'll be honest with you that's why people call in and say thank you alex jones makes

[2:25:57.620 --> 2:26:01.700]  i should have led the show you're right i think that's in my stack about the breakdown about how
[2:26:02.740 --> 2:26:07.620]  about how the meat packing and everything's shutting down because because we're in martial law
[2:26:07.620 --> 2:26:12.420]  and the left loves it and when they're totally homeless they're going to be begging for a bunch
[2:26:12.420 --> 2:26:21.380]  of free crap don't you love it well we have the 14th amendment limiting state powers to
[2:26:22.820 --> 2:26:28.420]  violate our our god given rights i suggest that as americans we stand up for them and you're right
[2:26:29.380 --> 2:26:36.260]  we need to stand up and stop rolling over to china what we need to do is expel every single ccp

[2:26:58.820 --> 2:27:05.220]  technocratic elite and i know that's what they want but it would if we did it properly from a
[2:27:05.220 --> 2:27:09.860]  defensive span it's the military industrial complex that's globalist control that did this
[2:27:09.860 --> 2:27:14.660]  we're taking control of that right now but the difference is at least america literally
[2:27:14.660 --> 2:27:18.500]  understands look we're under attack because we got a real president we're under attack by the
[2:27:18.500 --> 2:27:24.340]  globalist proxies take the chai comms right now we would be welcomed into china with open arms

[2:31:52.660 --> 2:31:57.380]  Since the invention and deployment of radar during World War II, scientists have noted
[2:31:57.380 --> 2:32:03.420]  increased cancers and other health problems with those who were close to the devices.
[2:32:03.420 --> 2:32:05.500]  That's where they're really high powered.
[2:32:05.500 --> 2:32:10.140]  If you're a quarter mile from a cell tower, there's not any real high powered radiation
[2:32:10.140 --> 2:32:11.140]  hitting you.
[2:32:11.140 --> 2:32:14.460]  But if you're a couple hundred feet away, they got fences around them with skull and
[2:32:14.460 --> 2:32:18.140]  crossbones on them for a reason, it says it can hurt you.
[2:32:18.140 --> 2:32:24.340]  So now with 5G that's even stronger, these systems are literally above the streets, just
[2:32:24.340 --> 2:32:29.540]  20 or 30 feet from people's heads, from their genitals, from their bodies.
[2:32:29.540 --> 2:32:32.740]  People are burning them down and attacking them all over the world now.
[2:32:32.740 --> 2:32:34.980]  I'm saying don't do that.
[2:32:34.980 --> 2:32:36.580]  Use information warfare.
[2:32:36.580 --> 2:32:42.180]  Use the truth to expose it and sue local governments and others until they remove them.
[2:32:42.180 --> 2:32:46.020]  That takes the way to deal with this, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:32:46.020 --> 2:32:50.340]  Take action in the information war, but I gotta tell you, I can't blame the people
[2:32:50.340 --> 2:32:55.780]  that are doing it because they're under assault.
[2:32:55.780 --> 2:32:59.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:32:59.780 --> 2:33:13.700]  China drops the bombshell in the deep state, says they were given the Bio 11's to release
[2:33:13.700 --> 2:33:14.700]  on America.
[2:33:14.700 --> 2:33:17.260]  Oh, you might want to check the video out.
[2:33:17.260 --> 2:33:21.800]  It's a banned on video in the John Bowne section at forewars.com because if Trump gets out
[2:33:21.800 --> 2:33:23.300]  ahead of this, the truth's horrible.
[2:33:23.300 --> 2:33:25.740]  I know it sounds crazy, but it's what's happening.
[2:33:25.740 --> 2:33:30.380]  Now the Senate intelligence committee and they're all coming out saying China did this
[2:33:30.380 --> 2:33:31.380]  on purpose.
[2:33:31.380 --> 2:33:34.660]  Well, yeah, they did it with Obama and Fauci ran it.
[2:33:34.660 --> 2:33:35.660]  Let's see.
[2:33:35.660 --> 2:33:36.860]  Everybody's seen Fauci up there.
[2:33:36.860 --> 2:33:39.860]  Go to drudgerport.com and click on that headline.
[2:33:39.860 --> 2:33:43.420]  We'll cover it next segment when you're going to call us right now.
[2:33:43.420 --> 2:33:45.860]  Trump set to fire Fauci.
[2:33:45.860 --> 2:33:47.820]  What is all that about?
[2:33:47.820 --> 2:33:57.420]  Since when did Fauci, this literal George Soros slash Bill Gates Menon become God?
[2:33:57.420 --> 2:34:04.820]  White House says no for now, but that little monster needs to be indicted, not fired.
[2:34:04.820 --> 2:34:05.820]  Unbelievable.
[2:34:05.820 --> 2:34:09.700]  All right, let's race through your calls now here.
[2:34:09.700 --> 2:34:10.700]  All right.
[2:34:10.700 --> 2:34:11.700]  Who's up next?
[2:34:11.700 --> 2:34:15.860]  It's going in the order they were received.
[2:34:15.860 --> 2:34:19.620]  Daniel in Kentucky, thanks for holding go ahead, Alex.
[2:34:19.620 --> 2:34:24.980]  I'm looking over the hills here in Kentucky and I see a swarm of our enemy coming over
[2:34:24.980 --> 2:34:25.980]  the hills.
[2:34:25.980 --> 2:34:28.940]  And I'm asking general Trump, when are we going to attack?
[2:34:28.940 --> 2:34:29.940]  When are we going to attack?
[2:34:29.940 --> 2:34:32.940]  What are you going to let us fail here?
[2:34:32.940 --> 2:34:36.180]  No, I hope he takes action quick.
[2:34:36.180 --> 2:34:40.220]  No, I hear you, I mean, we literally are in a war with criminals in the government and
[2:34:40.220 --> 2:34:44.540]  the system, allied with communist China and Hollywood to literally cut the economy off
[2:34:44.540 --> 2:34:46.420]  and China's open for business.
[2:34:46.420 --> 2:34:50.780]  And it'll be if you see the numbers, the third world already has millions starving to death
[2:34:50.780 --> 2:34:52.140]  right now because of this.
[2:34:52.140 --> 2:34:53.140]  Who cares about them?
[2:34:53.140 --> 2:34:54.140]  Right?
[2:34:54.140 --> 2:34:56.140]  I mean, this is crazy.
[2:34:56.140 --> 2:35:03.220]  Yeah, we, I want to give you the mission statement of the antichrist world government.
[2:35:03.220 --> 2:35:11.540]  It's this to destroy the health, labor, prosperity, freedom and souls of mankind.
[2:35:11.540 --> 2:35:14.340]  That's the mission statement as a pastor of a small church.
[2:35:14.340 --> 2:35:19.980]  I'm trying to wake people up, tell them preachers, you need to start telling people just how
[2:35:19.980 --> 2:35:20.980]  it is.
[2:35:20.980 --> 2:35:21.980]  You know, the Bible.
[2:35:21.980 --> 2:35:23.580]  Well, notice there's a big revival happening.
[2:35:23.580 --> 2:35:27.020]  That's why they're making sure churches, they shut down, even though they have no jurisdiction
[2:35:27.020 --> 2:35:28.020]  over churches.
[2:35:28.020 --> 2:35:33.260]  So they're seeing what we will put up with some point in time if this continues, they
[2:35:33.260 --> 2:35:35.740]  will be mass disobedience.
[2:35:35.740 --> 2:35:37.580]  People are about tired of it up here in Kentucky.
[2:35:37.580 --> 2:35:39.020]  I don't know about other states.
[2:35:39.020 --> 2:35:40.020]  We're getting tired.
[2:35:40.020 --> 2:35:42.300]  It's going to be a little bit more than mass disobedience and I just feel sorry for the
[2:35:42.300 --> 2:35:45.500]  idiot enforcers because they're following illegal orders.
[2:35:45.500 --> 2:35:46.780]  Right.
[2:35:46.780 --> 2:35:52.220]  And so I know I used to believe that God was going to take us out of here before anything
[2:35:52.220 --> 2:35:53.220]  bad happens.
[2:35:53.220 --> 2:35:57.580]  But the Bible says all that live golly will what suffer persecution.
[2:35:57.580 --> 2:36:02.500]  So pastors, you need to tell them what's coming ahead and that could stop it is mass
[2:36:02.500 --> 2:36:04.740]  repentance and turning to God.
[2:36:04.740 --> 2:36:05.740]  That's the only thing.
[2:36:05.740 --> 2:36:10.540]  If you look at Jonah, you know, God was going to destroy Nineveh, but Jonah went down finally
[2:36:10.540 --> 2:36:15.580]  in God's will, went down there and preached and they repented.
[2:36:15.580 --> 2:36:16.580]  And for about a hundred.
[2:36:16.580 --> 2:36:17.580]  That's the paradox.
[2:36:17.580 --> 2:36:18.580]  Everybody hears that.
[2:36:18.580 --> 2:36:20.620]  If you stand up for God, you get persecuted.
[2:36:20.620 --> 2:36:24.420]  But the Bible also, and I've experienced it once you go through the fire, the blessings
[2:36:24.420 --> 2:36:25.420]  are incredible.
[2:36:25.420 --> 2:36:29.020]  And then God gets you ready and a bigger attack comes and then sometimes you need to be killed,
[2:36:29.020 --> 2:36:30.020]  you know, for the message.
[2:36:30.020 --> 2:36:31.020]  But that's OK.
[2:36:31.020 --> 2:36:32.020]  You're ready for that.
[2:36:32.020 --> 2:36:34.460]  But God always builds you up at the point you're ready.
[2:36:34.460 --> 2:36:39.260]  And so as a pastor, it was like to explain to folks that trying to avoid persecution is
[2:36:39.260 --> 2:36:41.300]  the surest way of being a slave.
[2:36:41.300 --> 2:36:42.300]  Right.
[2:36:42.300 --> 2:36:44.260]  And, you know, there's a lot of Christians out there.
[2:36:44.260 --> 2:36:48.500]  They'll say, well, you know, if God don't rapture me out here, I'll just lay down my
[2:36:48.500 --> 2:36:52.060]  life for Jesus Christ and get my head cut off.
[2:36:52.060 --> 2:36:53.860]  But, you know, I don't think that's going to happen.
[2:36:53.860 --> 2:36:57.540]  I think the majority of people are going to fall in line and take the mark of the beast.
[2:36:57.540 --> 2:36:59.340]  Oh, of course, it's not going to ever be called that.
[2:36:59.340 --> 2:37:03.780]  It's called your digital vaccine in the vaccine as an ink to make sure you had it and sure
[2:37:03.780 --> 2:37:04.780]  they track you with it.
[2:37:04.780 --> 2:37:05.780]  But it's COVID-19.
[2:37:05.780 --> 2:37:06.780]  Pastor.
[2:37:06.780 --> 2:37:09.500]  Oh, the pastor had to be taken away.
[2:37:09.500 --> 2:37:10.500]  He was crazy.
[2:37:10.500 --> 2:37:16.220]  But Jeremiah 12.5, if you ever read this, if thou hast run with a footman and they have
[2:37:16.220 --> 2:37:20.140]  wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses?
[2:37:20.140 --> 2:37:25.460]  And if in the land of peace wherein thou trustest, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in
[2:37:25.460 --> 2:37:26.780]  the swelling of Jordan?
[2:37:26.780 --> 2:37:31.620]  If you can't take a stand now for Jesus Christ, you'll never put your head down there in that
[2:37:31.620 --> 2:37:35.780]  guillotine and have it chopped off.
[2:37:35.780 --> 2:37:36.780]  Know about it.
[2:37:36.780 --> 2:37:37.780]  Absolutely.
[2:37:37.780 --> 2:37:39.020]  People get so afraid of this life.
[2:37:39.020 --> 2:37:40.020]  We are energy.
[2:37:40.020 --> 2:37:41.020]  It's been scientifically proven.
[2:37:41.020 --> 2:37:42.020]  It's all real.
[2:37:42.020 --> 2:37:45.780]  Do not fear death, folks, fear spiritual death, serving Satan.
[2:37:45.780 --> 2:37:47.420]  God bless you, my friend.
[2:37:47.420 --> 2:37:48.420]  That's a beautiful verse.
[2:37:48.420 --> 2:37:49.420]  I've read that verse many years ago.
[2:37:49.420 --> 2:37:50.420]  I've forgotten it.
[2:37:50.420 --> 2:37:52.020]  But what was it as he's gone now?
[2:37:52.020 --> 2:37:53.020]  Absolutely.
[2:37:53.020 --> 2:37:57.580]  If you can't walk right now, it's like, like we're like fighting the enemy in slow motion
[2:37:57.580 --> 2:37:58.580]  right now.
[2:37:58.580 --> 2:38:00.420]  Do you imagine trying to race horses?
[2:38:00.420 --> 2:38:05.700]  I mean, this is once the war starts, man, there's no more time for patty kicker games.
[2:38:05.700 --> 2:38:11.820]  And we're having our prosperity sucked out, sucked out.
[2:38:11.820 --> 2:38:12.820]  Trump came in.
[2:38:12.820 --> 2:38:13.820]  He tried to end abortion.
[2:38:13.820 --> 2:38:14.820]  People didn't do it.
[2:38:14.820 --> 2:38:19.100]  He was not like some perfect guy either, but he's like, okay, let's do it.
[2:38:19.100 --> 2:38:20.540]  Oh, no, no.
[2:38:20.540 --> 2:38:23.100]  And Schumer said, you try to end abortion.
[2:38:23.100 --> 2:38:24.580]  We'll kill you.
[2:38:24.580 --> 2:38:30.420]  He told the president, well, you're dead.
[2:38:30.420 --> 2:38:35.660]  Just like Brennan and Clapper said, well, we'll remove the president outside.
[2:38:35.660 --> 2:38:36.660]  That's not allowed.
[2:38:36.660 --> 2:38:41.540]  I mean, seeing anyone howling, I mean, watch, you know, I mean, that's all them up there
[2:38:41.540 --> 2:38:46.340]  strutting around how they're going to kill people and how big they are.
[2:38:46.340 --> 2:38:49.140]  But you know what?
[2:38:49.140 --> 2:38:50.140]  We bow down to their ass.
[2:38:50.140 --> 2:38:53.060]  So what do we expect?
[2:38:53.060 --> 2:38:59.900]  You bow down to some hunchback, a Brahmavik lady, some hunchback witch, and you get what
[2:38:59.900 --> 2:39:03.220]  you deserve.
[2:39:03.220 --> 2:39:11.780]  Just for me, I don't bow down to that demonic slug.
[2:39:11.780 --> 2:39:13.420]  She's already burning in hell.
[2:39:13.420 --> 2:39:17.660]  Her life is a tortured existence, serving her master.
[2:39:17.660 --> 2:39:21.140]  She's a slave, not me.
[2:39:21.140 --> 2:39:25.860]  I willfully serve my God and my God empowers me like so much wind and sails.
[2:39:25.860 --> 2:39:27.660]  I'm like, can you cut that back?
[2:39:27.660 --> 2:39:30.100]  I can't handle this.
[2:39:30.100 --> 2:39:41.260]  God says that's growing pains, get ready, unbelievable.
[2:39:41.260 --> 2:39:46.180]  God starts giving me a discernment, understanding, I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I can't
[2:39:46.180 --> 2:39:57.860]  handle this, and then it's just like, but I can't handle it over time, slowly, spiritually
[2:39:57.860 --> 2:40:01.180]  growing, getting stronger.
[2:40:01.180 --> 2:40:03.980]  See the devil doesn't want you to know about that power God has, doesn't want you to know
[2:40:03.980 --> 2:40:06.740]  that there's total fulfillment waiting right now, total perfection.
[2:40:06.740 --> 2:40:10.060]  Alex in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead, thanks for holding.
[2:40:10.060 --> 2:40:16.380]  Now you listener, five-year supplement or first-time caller, it's an honor to be here
[2:40:16.380 --> 2:40:17.380]  with you.
[2:40:17.380 --> 2:40:18.380]  It's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[2:40:18.380 --> 2:40:20.140]  It's you standing behind us is the reason we're here.
[2:40:20.140 --> 2:40:23.380]  I salute Alex and all the other patriots.
[2:40:23.380 --> 2:40:24.380]  Absolutely, man.
[2:40:24.380 --> 2:40:26.180]  Well, I hope you have enough time for me.
[2:40:26.180 --> 2:40:27.180]  I got a lot to lay out.
[2:40:27.180 --> 2:40:28.180]  Go ahead.
[2:40:28.180 --> 2:40:29.660]  We know these people are guilty.
[2:40:29.660 --> 2:40:33.860]  The NIH, the World Health Organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, we know
[2:40:33.860 --> 2:40:34.860]  who these people are.
[2:40:34.860 --> 2:40:38.740]  I mean, there's obviously enough information and evidence out there to start going after
[2:40:38.740 --> 2:40:41.020]  Kissinger, which we now see all the articles popping up.
[2:40:41.020 --> 2:40:42.540]  We're going to go after him.
[2:40:42.540 --> 2:40:48.460]  And when you look at the marches of 63, MLK and 69 against Vietnam and even 2004 with
[2:40:48.460 --> 2:40:49.460]  the.
[2:40:49.460 --> 2:40:50.460]  Yeah, all those aren't allowed.
[2:40:50.460 --> 2:40:51.460]  They're COVID, COVID.
[2:40:51.460 --> 2:40:54.020]  No, it's meant to stop our revolution.
[2:40:54.020 --> 2:40:55.020]  Exactly.
[2:40:55.020 --> 2:40:59.860]  That's why I thank God every day that this happened after what happened earlier this year,
[2:40:59.860 --> 2:41:04.380]  you know, in January with Virginia, when everybody went and mobilized to defend our second amendment,
[2:41:04.380 --> 2:41:05.380]  that was powerful.
[2:41:05.380 --> 2:41:06.380]  And, you know, I want to.
[2:41:06.380 --> 2:41:07.380]  That's what scared them.
[2:41:07.380 --> 2:41:09.540]  It's what made them launch the timetable.
[2:41:09.540 --> 2:41:13.340]  So that's why I have this idea, like, why can't we mobilize hundreds of thousands?
[2:41:13.340 --> 2:41:17.220]  Because you have millions of listeners, not only in this country worldwide.
[2:41:17.220 --> 2:41:18.700]  And we're listening to you, brother.
[2:41:18.700 --> 2:41:19.700]  We're here.
[2:41:19.700 --> 2:41:20.700]  We're ready to do something.
[2:41:20.700 --> 2:41:22.380]  And we're not going to let these people get away with it.
[2:41:22.380 --> 2:41:26.180]  And I'm over here thinking, you know, with our military being awakened stronger than ever
[2:41:26.180 --> 2:41:29.580]  and everybody's aware and we have such a strong president right now.
[2:41:29.580 --> 2:41:31.420]  Why can't we just go into the streets?
[2:41:31.420 --> 2:41:32.420]  We have their number.
[2:41:32.420 --> 2:41:33.420]  We have their card.
[2:41:33.420 --> 2:41:34.860]  We know who these people are.
[2:41:34.860 --> 2:41:35.860]  Let's mobilize.
[2:41:35.860 --> 2:41:36.860]  Let's go after them.
[2:41:36.860 --> 2:41:37.860]  Like we need to defy all.
[2:41:37.860 --> 2:41:38.860]  No, we do.
[2:41:38.860 --> 2:41:42.740]  And, you know, I.
[2:41:42.740 --> 2:41:45.060]  We absolutely need to discuss that and talk about that.
[2:41:45.060 --> 2:41:46.060]  What's next?
[2:41:46.060 --> 2:41:50.700]  100 percent because China is mobilizing and we need to be mobilizing not only in our country,
[2:41:50.700 --> 2:41:51.700]  but strategically.
[2:41:51.700 --> 2:41:55.540]  And I know we have about 30,000 troops in Europe right now and probably to go after
[2:41:55.540 --> 2:41:58.060]  a lot of these heads that are, you know, globalist war.
[2:41:58.060 --> 2:41:59.060]  Yeah.
[2:41:59.060 --> 2:42:00.060]  And listen, that's not authoritarianism.
[2:42:00.060 --> 2:42:04.340]  When you're down under bio attack with enemies inside your country and you're and they're
[2:42:04.340 --> 2:42:08.540]  trying to bring the whole economy down the engine that'll kill tens of millions and kill
[2:42:08.540 --> 2:42:10.540]  hundreds of millions of third world.
[2:42:10.540 --> 2:42:14.540]  I'm not I'm not a guy that gets off on violence, but, you know, take it a piss.
[2:42:14.540 --> 2:42:16.580]  I don't know how to do it real well.
[2:42:16.580 --> 2:42:19.740]  I'm just saying to the system, if you're not evil and crazy, you better do something
[2:42:19.740 --> 2:42:22.700]  right now, I mean, because there's it's like a train going over the edge of cliff.
[2:42:22.700 --> 2:42:25.860]  And if you had a crazy conductor trying to and you wouldn't stop, you got to hit him
[2:42:25.860 --> 2:42:26.860]  in the head.
[2:42:26.860 --> 2:42:29.740]  I mean, you got to stop him or the whole damn train goes down.
[2:42:29.740 --> 2:42:31.020]  That's all I'm saying, man.
[2:42:31.020 --> 2:42:32.900]  And everybody else is too scared to say it.
[2:42:32.900 --> 2:42:33.900]  I'm so scared.
[2:42:33.900 --> 2:42:34.900]  I got to say it.
[2:42:34.900 --> 2:42:35.900]  It's the opposite.
[2:42:35.900 --> 2:42:39.540]  I see where this is going and I'm here like going, you know, I feel guilty.
[2:42:39.540 --> 2:42:44.060]  You know, I don't call for Trump to just say, take the gloves off as president.
[2:42:44.060 --> 2:42:48.340]  We just need to start hearing about, you know, when you start hearing about a lot of folks
[2:42:48.340 --> 2:42:51.820]  who start dying.
[2:42:51.820 --> 2:42:56.420]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[2:42:56.420 --> 2:43:02.100]  Sure, coffee, candy and other highly sugar filled drinks can give you a short boost,
[2:43:02.100 --> 2:43:04.780]  but the crash always follows.
[2:43:04.780 --> 2:43:11.220]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help.
[2:43:11.220 --> 2:43:12.220]  Turbo force.
[2:43:12.220 --> 2:43:18.660]  Similar to other mixing energy packets, turbo force from info wars life utilizes vitamins,
[2:43:18.660 --> 2:43:25.660]  amino acids and extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide focus,
[2:43:25.660 --> 2:43:28.900]  clarity and a boost of energy when you need it.
[2:43:28.900 --> 2:43:36.020]  Turbo force is certainly a force to be reckoned with for affordable, affordable and tasty energy.
[2:43:36.020 --> 2:43:41.500]  And speaking of affordable, you can even try turbo force for a limited time at an incredible
[2:43:41.500 --> 2:43:42.500]  40% off.
[2:43:42.500 --> 2:43:51.900]  Don't wait till it's out of stock again and get turbo force right now only at infowarstore.com.
[2:43:51.900 --> 2:43:52.900]  It's Wednesday morning.
[2:43:52.900 --> 2:43:57.860]  I was just in a local Austin business that was basically empty and there were three motorcycle
[2:43:57.860 --> 2:43:58.860]  police in there.
[2:43:58.860 --> 2:44:02.860]  And I said, what do you think of this whole coronavirus thing?
[2:44:02.860 --> 2:44:05.500]  They're like, it looks like it's a hoax.
[2:44:05.500 --> 2:44:11.340]  And I said, yeah, you're absolutely right the way it's been handled is a hoax.
[2:44:11.340 --> 2:44:15.420]  Meaning everybody that dies who happens to test positive, even though they die of a heart
[2:44:15.420 --> 2:44:20.500]  attack or cancer or diabetes as dying from coronavirus is the big one.
[2:44:20.500 --> 2:44:24.500]  And then of course they're also classifying everybody that test positive for coronavirus
[2:44:24.500 --> 2:44:29.580]  period, not just COVID-19 as having it.
[2:44:29.580 --> 2:44:33.180]  So they're, they're upping a number of cases, they're upping a number of deaths, but still
[2:44:33.180 --> 2:44:38.900]  more people died this week and last week than died from the coronavirus from suicide.
[2:44:38.900 --> 2:44:43.100]  So if anything, it's causing divorces and suicide and stir craziness and basic insanity
[2:44:43.100 --> 2:44:48.260]  and a giant power grab with big pharma preparing a forced inoculation, which they even admit
[2:44:48.260 --> 2:44:52.580]  will not protect you from next year's mutation of the coronavirus.
[2:44:52.580 --> 2:44:58.180]  Hey, listen, Alex Jones and the resistance are still on air.
[2:44:58.180 --> 2:45:01.180]  They're at band.video and infowarstore.com.
[2:45:01.180 --> 2:45:04.020]  All you gotta do is go to infowarstore.com.
[2:45:04.020 --> 2:45:09.820]  You'll find Alex Jones' broadcast, live, you'll find Owen Troyer, the war room, David Knight
[2:45:09.820 --> 2:45:16.380]  and so much more special broadcast films, emergency reports, it's all there and the
[2:45:16.380 --> 2:45:20.180]  globalists have worked around the clock to take them off air, but something's happening.
[2:45:20.180 --> 2:45:25.540]  The public has been spreading the word that the forbidden truth lives at infowarstore.com.
[2:45:25.540 --> 2:45:30.860]  You'll find Alex Jones' broadcast, live, you'll find Owen Troyer, the war room, David
[2:45:30.860 --> 2:45:34.740]  Knight, literally backfiring, but we can supercharge this right now.
[2:45:34.740 --> 2:45:39.580]  If all of you listening realize, hey, you know how to find the show, but other people
[2:45:39.580 --> 2:45:40.580]  don't.
[2:45:40.580 --> 2:45:45.080]  They believe mainstream media that was off the air so you can override the corporate media,
[2:45:45.080 --> 2:45:49.580]  the establishment, all of them at this critical time and tell folks that the truth lives, and
[2:45:49.580 --> 2:45:52.060]  it's back on air at infowarstorecom.
[2:45:52.060 --> 2:45:56.480]  I don't need to remind you how four years ago I told you the polls against Trump were
[2:45:56.480 --> 2:46:01.320]  fake he was winning by a giant margin but election fraud almost stole the
[2:46:01.320 --> 2:46:05.360]  election from Trump and the American people well now they're pushing the
[2:46:05.360 --> 2:46:10.960]  idea that oh cancel the Republican and Democrat conventions maybe cancel the
[2:46:10.960 --> 2:46:15.840]  election a year like the Olympics that's because they know Trump in every
[2:46:15.840 --> 2:46:21.960]  internal scientific poll is 20 points ahead of the brain damage by so they
[2:46:21.960 --> 2:46:26.560]  can say sir you look big like the Olympics look back off a year and then
[2:46:26.560 --> 2:46:30.440]  you'll still win in a year after you fix the crisis no they need more time to
[2:46:30.440 --> 2:46:34.920]  cook up an assassination and economic collapse a new virus Trump needs to say
[2:46:34.920 --> 2:46:39.680]  no in America we keep elections on time have the elections win by a landslide
[2:46:39.680 --> 2:46:44.360]  and not give the globalist what they want Hillary Biden they all want to
[2:46:44.360 --> 2:46:48.600]  suspend the election we shouldn't give them what they want we need to have a
[2:46:48.600 --> 2:46:53.160]  vote vote in America and reelect Trump 2020
[2:46:54.360 --> 2:46:59.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:07.560 --> 2:47:13.720]  you thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever but you rode
[2:47:13.720 --> 2:47:20.480]  upon a steamer to the violence of the sun from the front lines of the
[2:47:20.480 --> 2:47:25.840]  information war it's alex jones
[2:47:32.120 --> 2:47:35.640]  you know folks are fighting back hashtag reopen North Carolina with that
[2:47:35.640 --> 2:47:39.880]  demon governor to close all the churches it's all where they have the moral
[2:47:39.880 --> 2:47:43.840]  high grounds they don't go to your church I mean Austin has like seven deaths
[2:47:43.840 --> 2:47:49.040]  couple thousand cases I mean again it's a real virus it's weaponized we told you
[2:47:49.040 --> 2:47:54.240]  that it's been confirmed it is weaponized common cold but that's
[2:47:54.240 --> 2:48:00.320]  because then when they test everybody it shows that they have it which are false
[2:48:00.320 --> 2:48:04.600]  positives that's all confirmed and the Bible says my people perish for lack of
[2:48:04.600 --> 2:48:16.400]  knowledge and it's totally true bricks you know scarf lady on the payroll of
[2:48:16.400 --> 2:48:21.280]  Bill and one of the gates she admitted last week yeah we count every death that
[2:48:21.280 --> 2:48:29.680]  test positive for COVID as COVID and then I have articles today where they
[2:48:29.680 --> 2:48:37.800]  admit that oh the majority of the test that say you're positive aren't that's
[2:48:37.800 --> 2:48:41.760]  why they're they're finding this now and saying what are we gonna do see it's all
[2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:46.120]  about you're all suspect now because of a cold bug that all of you have
[2:48:46.120 --> 2:48:52.400]  antibodies for but they want antibodies for the genetically engineered special
[2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:57.000]  chimerical bug that like HIV is a creation it's owned by Bill among the
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:49:00.480]  gates they have the patent on it so now everyone that gets it has to be tracked
[2:49:00.480 --> 2:49:04.800]  through their apps everyone that can spread it and see they made a novel
[2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:11.600]  virus that they can now freak everybody out about but the testers aren't good
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:14.040]  enough to separate which one it is you know they've got the other test about
[2:49:14.040 --> 2:49:18.440]  to come out they're saying until you've got an antibody for it you can't go out
[2:49:18.440 --> 2:49:22.800]  and have a life so you've got to go to them now to have a life what a load of
[2:49:22.800 --> 2:49:29.000]  crap but I remember reading 30 years ago the ultimate bioweapon will be
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:34.200]  weaponized cold virus and see here's the thing I've really thought about this if
[2:49:34.200 --> 2:49:38.640]  it lowers your immunity to take the vaccine they've got studies on similar
[2:49:38.640 --> 2:49:42.400]  ones they tested they've done this before cold viruses if it lowers your
[2:49:42.400 --> 2:49:47.880]  immunity the regular cold that's really the weapon see it lowers your immunity
[2:49:47.880 --> 2:49:51.920]  I'm gonna go back to your calls you'll slant is coming up I need to hit though
[2:49:51.920 --> 2:49:59.640]  what I did a bunch of here I'll be honest here's the I'm not a morbid person so
[2:49:59.640 --> 2:50:03.560]  after I look at a bunch of studies and look at little kids and read the numbers
[2:50:03.560 --> 2:50:06.320]  of the millions they're gonna starve to death or already starving to death the
[2:50:06.320 --> 2:50:11.240]  next few months and then I see the left going oh we're so scared for every
[2:50:11.240 --> 2:50:15.000]  person that dies here when thousands of times that are gonna die from the economy
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:20.680]  and plotting around the world I get violently pissed because I really do
[2:50:20.680 --> 2:50:25.400]  care it's not like some fake virtue signal with me and then I'm gonna start
[2:50:25.400 --> 2:50:33.000]  talking about how those doing the shutdown need to pay for it but they're
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:36.880]  just a bunch of useful idiots to begin with it look at the stack of those right
[2:50:36.880 --> 2:50:41.920]  here oh my god but we got another special report we're gonna from here right
[2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:47.040]  here that really doesn't have words to describe it so I think it's just best we
[2:50:47.040 --> 2:50:52.600]  play it it's a nice CG Joker that introduces it here it is many believe
[2:50:52.600 --> 2:51:00.040]  this house quarantine by the media controlled by the government controlled
[2:51:00.040 --> 2:51:08.040]  by the elite is nothing more than house arrest while they construct the 5g
[2:51:08.040 --> 2:51:12.960]  towers every single day patients are lining up outside here many of them with
[2:51:12.960 --> 2:51:18.880]  cold and flu like symptoms they come here to be tested this is bad people are
[2:51:18.880 --> 2:51:24.000]  dying we don't have the tools that we need people waiting in the cold to get
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:28.680]  care the hospital tells us every that's something I haven't even gotten into the
[2:51:28.680 --> 2:51:33.320]  hundreds of tiktok videos at huge hospitals that they claim are overwhelmed
[2:51:33.320 --> 2:51:36.680]  everybody's dying and then they match them up and it's like totally empty and
[2:51:36.680 --> 2:51:40.240]  everyone's dancing around there's most surgeries elective nowadays and then
[2:51:40.240 --> 2:51:44.160]  people go to the hospital they say everybody's dying and no one's there the
[2:51:44.160 --> 2:51:49.880]  very day it's happening because they're counting every death of someone that has
[2:51:49.880 --> 2:51:53.080]  a cold virus who happened to have cancer or happen to have lung cancer or
[2:51:53.080 --> 2:51:55.400]  happen to have heart attack or happen to have diabetes or happen to have an
[2:51:55.400 --> 2:52:02.840]  infection to this and so I had some go Alex is even more sophisticated they
[2:52:02.840 --> 2:52:06.400]  had the Chinese put it out a man made one that didn't really harmful to make
[2:52:06.400 --> 2:52:10.520]  it look deadly and create a hype no no no they they put a doctor's bill on the
[2:52:10.520 --> 2:52:14.120]  gates own the clone of the virus they sold in North Carolina was given the
[2:52:14.120 --> 2:52:17.920]  Chinese so they can own the vaccine and own the tracking of it this is about a
[2:52:17.920 --> 2:52:25.640]  global ID and tracking it that that's that's why the virus is real and if you
[2:52:25.640 --> 2:52:29.800]  are zinc is a zinc deficient vitamin C deficient or vitamin D3 deficient or
[2:52:29.800 --> 2:52:34.160]  any of those combined it'll kill your ass dead in the hammer just like if you
[2:52:34.160 --> 2:52:37.880]  don't have vitamin C you're gonna die from a common cold that's the paradox
[2:52:37.880 --> 2:52:42.440]  yeah if you're an undernourished and run down they'll kill you and you know
[2:52:42.440 --> 2:52:50.040]  every year 30s from 35,000 people dying of the flu is a big deal but see we just
[2:52:50.040 --> 2:52:55.720]  know that's part of life it's what we do but now it's like this phobia and I
[2:52:55.720 --> 2:52:59.720]  always said that man what would they do if a hundred kids die here on average
[2:52:59.720 --> 2:53:04.360]  the average average really is like 67 but some years is a hundred of a mass
[2:53:04.360 --> 2:53:07.760]  shooting it's still too many but it's this phobia and all our guns are bad and
[2:53:07.760 --> 2:53:11.200]  we're all to blame what if they did that with the common cold I've even said
[2:53:11.200 --> 2:53:15.800]  that before like a phobia of that because some people have those phobias and
[2:53:15.800 --> 2:53:18.840]  yeah you're not getting out of this world alive might as well press down the
[2:53:18.840 --> 2:53:25.560]  accelerator man because those people who are waiting to die die first those that
[2:53:25.560 --> 2:53:31.080]  aren't waiting to die live long lives the good die young too as well but in my
[2:53:31.080 --> 2:53:35.760]  experience those fight and death are the ones that find it those that aren't
[2:53:35.760 --> 2:53:42.480]  afraid of death truly live and you know
[2:53:43.560 --> 2:53:50.360]  just it's what's even matter anymore I kept wondering why do I feel so guilty
[2:53:50.360 --> 2:53:53.840]  what is it I'm missing and then it hit me about three days ago doing research I
[2:53:53.840 --> 2:53:58.960]  was like yeah you subconsciously are mad at the third world because they've been
[2:53:58.960 --> 2:54:02.120]  dumbed down they've been made poor by the globalist they've been weaponized
[2:54:02.120 --> 2:54:05.640]  against you and now they're being projected against the West as an as a
[2:54:05.640 --> 2:54:09.080]  weapon but still they're not the bad guys and you know this is really a
[2:54:09.080 --> 2:54:12.400]  target on them because if you cut out the first world it will starve billions
[2:54:12.400 --> 2:54:16.680]  over the next decade we have the numbers and that's what it was is that they had
[2:54:16.680 --> 2:54:21.320]  subconsciously programmed me even though I wasn't consciously tribal and against
[2:54:21.320 --> 2:54:25.640]  those people they had been billed as my enemy so I was kind of halfway not
[2:54:25.640 --> 2:54:31.280]  worried about them you see because while they're busy trying to change the name
[2:54:31.280 --> 2:54:34.680]  of a dormitory from Lynch Hall an Irish name because it might hurt somebody's
[2:54:34.680 --> 2:54:39.800]  feelings the globalist want to kill the third world folks and there's the bigger
[2:54:39.800 --> 2:54:43.840]  truth so now I feel a lot better because it wasn't conscious but I was mad at
[2:54:43.840 --> 2:54:46.840]  myself the last week knowing what is it what is it and right before the show it
[2:54:46.840 --> 2:54:51.300]  hit me I went it's already what you're researching this is gonna kill hundreds of
[2:54:51.300 --> 2:54:55.720]  millions of people already is killing millions right now starving to death
[2:54:55.720 --> 2:54:59.680]  very race color and creed but mainly brown people and do you really want to
[2:54:59.680 --> 2:55:03.120]  sign on to that leftist because you're so afraid of a virus and this crap the
[2:55:03.120 --> 2:55:06.800]  shutdown of the economy is not about protecting you it's about bringing down
[2:55:06.800 --> 2:55:12.400]  the world economy all right play the Joker piece again sorry go ahead and the
[2:55:12.400 --> 2:55:16.760]  cold to get care the hospital tells us every day they're working to increase the
[2:55:16.760 --> 2:55:22.320]  capacity of this hospital by flooding it with nurses and equipment outside it's
[2:55:22.320 --> 2:55:26.080]  swamped with New Yorkers waiting in long lines to get tested for the
[2:55:26.080 --> 2:55:30.640]  coronavirus this is the emergency room and you would expect if you believe the
[2:55:30.640 --> 2:55:34.560]  mainstream media that this emergency room would be overflowing with people
[2:55:34.560 --> 2:55:38.960]  and as you can tell there are no people here
[2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:51.440]  not prepared she was a fake nurse the same lady I quit my job today I went
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:58.560]  into work and I was assigned to a COVID patient on the dummy ICU unit that has
[2:55:58.560 --> 2:56:05.400]  been converted to a designated COVID I'm gonna play the whole report when I get
[2:56:05.400 --> 2:56:08.940]  the transmission I want to hit a few more calls but but first off can you
[2:56:08.940 --> 2:56:11.400]  just keep coming up from yesterday I'm doing this on short notice if you can't
[2:56:11.400 --> 2:56:16.200]  Cuomo came out and he said every model has been fake yeah because it's 98% lower
[2:56:16.200 --> 2:56:21.560]  in what you said and still you know half the coronavirus deaths the US or in
[2:56:21.560 --> 2:56:26.200]  New York that's still man you're talking you know a lot of folks in fact let's
[2:56:26.200 --> 2:56:33.040]  play the audio here it is what we know is by what we're seeing today because all
[2:56:33.040 --> 2:56:37.240]  of the projection but by the way all those statisticians have been a hundred
[2:56:37.240 --> 2:56:42.640]  percent wrong well and we've been following the models because that was
[2:56:42.640 --> 2:56:48.240]  the only blueprint but they haven't turned out to be correct it's sort of like
[2:56:48.240 --> 2:56:53.320]  in the old days when we tried to predict a storm by listening to the
[2:56:53.320 --> 2:56:59.560]  weather forecast right so right but what we're seeing right now are fewer new
[2:56:59.560 --> 2:57:03.240]  cases yeah and he goes on to say and so they're not dying because you're not
[2:57:03.240 --> 2:57:06.360]  putting them on a ventilator when they're having an autoimmune response
[2:57:06.360 --> 2:57:10.880]  it's not air they need they need Benadryl with that medical doctors on we've
[2:57:10.880 --> 2:57:14.600]  had doctors saying that so and the global starting new from China that
[2:57:14.600 --> 2:57:17.080]  ventilators kill people that's why they're like we need more ventilators kill
[2:57:17.080 --> 2:57:23.040]  these people because you can tell a doctor here's the treatment okay you know
[2:57:23.040 --> 2:57:27.240]  cuz again it's all a murder operation but the New York doctors are like hey
[2:57:27.240 --> 2:57:29.960]  these ventilators are killing everybody this is an autoimmune response give
[2:57:29.960 --> 2:57:32.680]  Benadryl give them and they and they give them the Benadryl they and it's
[2:57:32.680 --> 2:57:36.120]  like oh they're fine now it's an autoimmune response just like the
[2:57:36.120 --> 2:57:39.640]  Spanish flu but they don't want you to know that because Bill Gates wants to

[2:59:51.100 --> 3:00:07.220]  You got some good news for you.
[3:00:07.220 --> 3:00:10.740]  In England, the police are finding people that buy potato chips.
[3:00:10.740 --> 3:00:14.340]  The law doesn't say it or the fake lockdown, you can't do that, but they chose the virtue
[3:00:14.340 --> 3:00:17.340]  signal.
[3:00:17.340 --> 3:00:20.660]  And the both governments are saying that's insane.
[3:00:20.660 --> 3:00:22.260]  That's the type of people that hire in those areas.
[3:00:22.260 --> 3:00:27.260]  Well, in Kentucky, judge stops Kentucky police from recording churchgoers' license plates
[3:00:27.260 --> 3:00:29.780]  to find them.
[3:00:29.780 --> 3:00:33.260]  As the backlash explodes and as people show up to church everywhere saying we're sticky
[3:00:33.260 --> 3:00:37.700]  or crap, you know it's a chai comma, piss up or rope.
[3:00:37.700 --> 3:00:40.980]  Since when does China set the precedent of how America operates?
[3:00:40.980 --> 3:00:46.380]  And thank God the governor of Texas has set starting later this week to reopen the state.
[3:00:46.380 --> 3:00:52.580]  I never got to this graph put up by JP Morgan showing how two years from now we'll still
[3:00:52.580 --> 3:00:53.740]  be on lockdown.
[3:00:53.740 --> 3:00:57.540]  The banks are making their move and when you're totally bankrupt, they're going to loan you
[3:00:57.540 --> 3:00:59.500]  money and then take your house.
[3:00:59.500 --> 3:01:04.660]  Let's go back to your phone calls.

[3:01:15.100 --> 3:01:16.580]  Hey, you've been wound up frequently.
[3:01:16.580 --> 3:01:18.580]  It's awesome to listen to.
[3:01:18.580 --> 3:01:20.820]  Hey, I'm a big fan.

[3:01:25.980 --> 3:01:26.980]  What's that?
[3:01:26.980 --> 3:01:27.980]  Just talk right on your telephone.

[3:01:28.980 --> 3:01:29.980]  No, no, I got a headset on.
[3:01:29.980 --> 3:01:30.980]  Oh, sorry.
[3:01:30.980 --> 3:01:31.980]  Go ahead and talk.
[3:01:31.980 --> 3:01:32.980]  Go ahead.
[3:01:32.980 --> 3:01:33.980]  Can you hear me okay?
[3:01:33.980 --> 3:01:34.980]  I can hear you pretty good now.
[3:01:34.980 --> 3:01:39.980]  I was a little bit distant there, but go ahead.
[3:01:39.980 --> 3:01:40.980]  Okay.
[3:01:40.980 --> 3:01:41.980]  All right.
[3:01:41.980 --> 3:01:42.980]  Well, let's try this.
[3:01:42.980 --> 3:01:47.820]  I'm a nurse living in the Chicago area, finishing up my PhD right now.
[3:01:47.820 --> 3:01:53.660]  I'm also a veteran, so I've got a little bit of experience with military weaponry.
[3:01:53.660 --> 3:01:59.660]  But so I just noticed some things, overlapping events that were going on with this whole
[3:01:59.660 --> 3:02:00.660]  thing.
[3:02:00.660 --> 3:02:07.220]  So we're obviously aware of the COVID-19 thing, and it started in Wuhan, and that's
[3:02:07.220 --> 3:02:09.420]  what we're told with that.
[3:02:09.420 --> 3:02:15.740]  And you're also, of course, already familiar with event 201 at this point, which laid out
[3:02:15.740 --> 3:02:20.620]  how the coronavirus would turn to met, and everything is kind of going according to plan
[3:02:20.620 --> 3:02:21.620]  as far as that goes.
[3:02:21.620 --> 3:02:23.980]  And why is it on with that?
[3:02:23.980 --> 3:02:28.020]  Well, yeah, globalists always do drills to coincide.
[3:02:28.020 --> 3:02:32.900]  So when they get caught directing it by military police, they go, oh, that's just a drill we're
[3:02:32.900 --> 3:02:35.140]  running that just happens to mirror this.
[3:02:35.140 --> 3:02:36.140]  That's the cover.
[3:02:36.140 --> 3:02:37.660]  Well, they're saying it's a drill.
[3:02:37.660 --> 3:02:39.700]  Oh, the drill is overthrow the government.
[3:02:39.700 --> 3:02:41.700]  Oh, no, I wasn't really doing that.
[3:02:41.700 --> 3:02:43.220]  It's in a tabletop exercise.
[3:02:43.220 --> 3:02:45.220]  You understand how that works?
[3:02:45.220 --> 3:02:50.420]  And at the same time, at the same time that that happened, you know, the COVID-19, it's
[3:02:50.420 --> 3:02:51.420]  real.
[3:02:51.420 --> 3:02:52.420]  I absolutely believe it's real.
[3:02:52.420 --> 3:02:53.420]  It's a coronavirus.
[3:02:53.420 --> 3:02:55.460]  Yeah, just like shark attacks or the flu is real.
[3:02:55.460 --> 3:03:00.460]  They're just hyping up a response that's disproportionate and not normal to set a new absolute hysterical
[3:03:00.460 --> 3:03:01.460]  precedent.
[3:03:01.460 --> 3:03:08.340]  But at the same time that this is happening, 5G rollout is happening and you're of course
[3:03:08.340 --> 3:03:09.340]  aware of that.
[3:03:09.340 --> 3:03:12.260]  And it's a big race to implement 5G.
[3:03:12.260 --> 3:03:19.660]  Now the thing is, is that that is the COVID-19 thing we found as being funded by Bill Gates.
[3:03:19.660 --> 3:03:24.420]  And I don't know if you know, but in December, Bill Gates bought up 5.3 million shares of
[3:03:24.420 --> 3:03:30.060]  pound castles, which actually they developed and build and sell the components for the
[3:03:30.060 --> 3:03:32.260]  5G network.
[3:03:32.260 --> 3:03:37.420]  So he's making money, he's funding both sides, he's making money out of both.
[3:03:37.420 --> 3:03:38.420]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:03:38.420 --> 3:03:44.940]  Insider trading, 200 CEOs dump their money in December and January, totally rigged.
[3:03:44.940 --> 3:03:47.060]  Giant drills of exactly this happening.
[3:03:47.060 --> 3:03:54.700]  He's involved in cloning the virus two years ago, owns it, funded things to the NIH, Fauci
[3:03:54.700 --> 3:03:56.260]  gave the weapons to the chai comms.
[3:03:56.260 --> 3:03:59.300]  Now the chai comms are blackmailing them with the info.
[3:03:59.300 --> 3:04:00.300]  Trump tries to bring it out.
[3:04:00.300 --> 3:04:03.220]  I mean, it is just absolutely insane.
[3:04:03.220 --> 3:04:07.900]  Let me elaborate a little bit further here because the fines and symptoms of radiation
[3:04:07.900 --> 3:04:12.420]  sickness are the exact same as the fines and symptoms for flu or COVID-19.
[3:04:12.420 --> 3:04:18.300]  Now this whole thing rolled out, both of them rolled out at the very beginning of flu season.
[3:04:18.300 --> 3:04:22.940]  And if you take a look at the path of the COVID virus.
[3:04:22.940 --> 3:04:25.220]  It's in the areas that have 5G.
[3:04:25.220 --> 3:04:26.220]  Exactly.
[3:04:26.220 --> 3:04:27.220]  Exactly.
[3:04:27.220 --> 3:04:29.940]  Now, you also, Vincent, I got to jump.
[3:04:29.940 --> 3:04:30.940]  I appreciate your call.
[3:04:30.940 --> 3:04:34.620]  You must not tune in very often because we've been all over that and I agree with you.
[3:04:34.620 --> 3:04:40.580]  We actually documented it in May 4th, 2018, predicting that Wuhan had a system.
[3:04:40.580 --> 3:04:41.780]  It doesn't cause the virus.
[3:04:41.780 --> 3:04:45.900]  It displaces oxygen out of the lungs, creating these types of symptoms.
[3:04:45.900 --> 3:04:50.180]  So the virus is real, but it's augmented by the system that lowers the immunity and
[3:04:50.180 --> 3:04:51.580]  drives oxygen out of the lungs.
[3:04:51.580 --> 3:04:57.500]  Living with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[3:04:57.500 --> 3:05:03.100]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stock full of high quality
[3:05:03.100 --> 3:05:07.060]  InfoWars store, Patriot Blend coffee.
[3:05:07.060 --> 3:05:13.780]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO
[3:05:13.780 --> 3:05:18.380]  coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[3:05:18.380 --> 3:05:23.660]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[3:05:23.660 --> 3:05:27.060]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[3:05:27.060 --> 3:05:34.660]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[3:05:34.660 --> 3:05:37.620]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[3:05:37.620 --> 3:05:44.140]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered
[3:05:44.140 --> 3:05:50.460]  right to your door at InfoWarsstore.com.
[3:05:50.460 --> 3:06:06.620]  We have 160, almost 160 million jobs in this country now, the most ever, by far, by far
[3:06:06.620 --> 3:06:11.340]  the most ever, the number of jobs, almost 160 million.
[3:06:11.340 --> 3:06:14.900]  So we can't turn that off and think it's going to be wonderful.
[3:06:14.900 --> 3:06:16.460]  There will be tremendous repercussions.
[3:06:16.460 --> 3:06:19.660]  There will be a tremendous death from that.
[3:06:19.660 --> 3:06:20.660]  Death.
[3:06:20.660 --> 3:06:25.540]  You know, you're talking about death, probably more death from that than anything that we're
[3:06:25.540 --> 3:06:31.300]  talking about with respect to the virus.
[3:06:31.300 --> 3:06:32.300]  You know, this is so important.
[3:06:32.300 --> 3:06:41.060]  I probably should have led the broadcast with it, but let's go ahead and hit this now.
[3:06:41.060 --> 3:06:47.580]  That's incredible information ever.
[3:06:47.580 --> 3:06:52.780]  That was the president a month ago saying, hey, I tried to block the Chinese flights.
[3:06:52.780 --> 3:06:53.780]  They wouldn't let me.
[3:06:53.780 --> 3:06:54.780]  The judges tried to block me.
[3:06:54.780 --> 3:06:56.660]  I overwrote it.
[3:06:56.660 --> 3:06:57.660]  And now they're saying it's my fault.
[3:06:57.660 --> 3:07:01.380]  It's like the Fauci clip from February saying, I told the president, no problem, don't stop
[3:07:01.380 --> 3:07:02.380]  the Chinese flights.
[3:07:02.380 --> 3:07:03.380]  Everything's fine.
[3:07:03.380 --> 3:07:05.820]  The president wants to, but I told him not to.
[3:07:05.820 --> 3:07:10.100]  Month and a half later, it's all President Trump's fault.
[3:07:10.100 --> 3:07:12.460]  He blocked us from doing anything.
[3:07:12.460 --> 3:07:16.820]  Well, look at the stack of articles of your TV viewer radio listeners.
[3:07:16.820 --> 3:07:23.340]  I'll read over these farmers dump milk, break eggs, this coronavirus restaurant closings
[3:07:23.340 --> 3:07:24.940]  destroyed man.
[3:07:24.940 --> 3:07:28.180]  Now, the grocery stores aren't buying it.
[3:07:28.180 --> 3:07:29.180]  There's no one getting it.
[3:07:29.180 --> 3:07:30.780]  They don't have a truck to pick it up.
[3:07:30.780 --> 3:07:36.100]  That's in the Wall Street Journal, but the left is all over MSNBC saying, arrest these
[3:07:36.100 --> 3:07:37.100]  farmers.
[3:07:37.100 --> 3:07:38.100]  That's perfect.
[3:07:38.100 --> 3:07:42.500]  Let me talk, man, make sure they get it to the stores, how do they even know where to
[3:07:42.500 --> 3:07:43.500]  take it?
[3:07:43.500 --> 3:07:47.620]  I can just pull up at a restaurant, let's close here by my eggs or grocery store.
[3:07:47.620 --> 3:07:49.340]  They do it through distributors.
[3:07:49.340 --> 3:07:52.940]  So now that only there's certain distributors that grocery stores know to deal with, they're
[3:07:52.940 --> 3:07:57.340]  charging more for the eggs because they know all the other people that they would have
[3:07:57.340 --> 3:07:59.220]  bought from are out of business.
[3:07:59.220 --> 3:08:05.340]  Walmart used to famously come in 20 years ago, 30 years ago to towns and tell people,
[3:08:05.340 --> 3:08:09.460]  produce sags, and they would get too many to produce sags, wait till it was a glut,
[3:08:09.460 --> 3:08:12.780]  and then get another business in debt, make the others go under so they'd only have a
[3:08:12.780 --> 3:08:16.420]  few suppliers so no one could get eggs in the area.
[3:08:16.420 --> 3:08:24.100]  Well, this is on a mass scale, so you're about to learn how it is to be in Venezuela.
[3:08:24.100 --> 3:08:28.940]  Smithfield foods to close, Sioux Falls plant indefinitely amid coronavirus 19, got a couple
[3:08:28.940 --> 3:08:31.860]  of people with it, got to shut down.
[3:08:31.860 --> 3:08:36.380]  So the power plant has a few, nuclear power plant, got to go home, let it chair noble,
[3:08:36.380 --> 3:08:39.260]  doesn't matter if it kills a million people, it's like, well, we got to have a million
[3:08:39.260 --> 3:08:44.660]  died, two people had it, well, okay, let the reactor blow up, you know, it's not works,
[3:08:44.660 --> 3:08:45.660]  it's liberal.
[3:08:45.660 --> 3:08:50.940]  And by the way, I'm not joking when I say that, a half a billion people just went on
[3:08:50.940 --> 3:08:54.860]  near starvation and now they're starving worldwide with this because the third world
[3:08:54.860 --> 3:08:55.860]  depends on us.
[3:08:55.860 --> 3:08:56.860]  Bye-bye.
[3:08:56.860 --> 3:09:02.540]  The tourism, the businesses, again, the food we grow down there, Africa alone, three countries
[3:09:02.540 --> 3:09:07.700]  are mainly dependent on flowers that are grown there and flown out to Europe and America.
[3:09:07.700 --> 3:09:10.980]  And now those are all shut down because that's not essential.
[3:09:10.980 --> 3:09:16.620]  When you say service is an essential, bye-bye, Bluebird, remember, we were supposed to all
[3:09:16.620 --> 3:09:25.100]  be service, we don't need industry anymore, we've got service economy, well, now they
[3:09:25.100 --> 3:09:30.460]  say under agenda 2030, it's non-essential, so die, die, die, there's AP, half a million
[3:09:30.460 --> 3:09:35.380]  people in poverty and it reads two million sent to starve to death, but that's okay, starving
[3:09:35.380 --> 3:09:38.060]  to death is good for Mother Earth, the Pope even said so.
[3:09:38.060 --> 3:09:43.060]  No, this is about killing people, sitting about saving people and the moral high ground
[3:09:43.060 --> 3:09:47.820]  of big tech spying and everybody buying into it, getting into it, remember, you just signed
[3:09:47.820 --> 3:09:53.420]  on to hundreds of millions of starve to death and the chain reaction.
[3:09:53.420 --> 3:09:56.500]  But now the task force is warning the very Democrats that shut everything down that it
[3:09:56.500 --> 3:10:02.180]  may have food shortages, don't worry, they'll oversee it all now.
[3:10:02.180 --> 3:10:07.260]  Like Bernie Sanders who just dropped out and endorsed Joe Biden said, there are too many
[3:10:07.260 --> 3:10:13.860]  foods and deodorants, we need lines, because didn't we tell you who gets food?
[3:10:13.860 --> 3:10:18.020]  I decide who eats, I am the ruler.
[3:10:18.020 --> 3:10:20.460]  Those are actual quotes.
[3:10:20.460 --> 3:10:25.860]  People looking to become more self-sustainable amid food shortages, K.O.K.H reports, but
[3:10:25.860 --> 3:10:32.140]  the left is calling for that on to be allowed, you must share your food, ah, the Soviet Gulag
[3:10:32.140 --> 3:10:40.540]  liberal, continuing food shortages, oh yes, oh yes, now here's a great rant by Mark Levin
[3:10:40.540 --> 3:10:44.100]  pointing out the slavery of it, I don't have time to get to it, but he just said you want
[3:10:44.100 --> 3:10:45.740]  slavery, you got it.
[3:10:45.740 --> 3:10:50.020]  Locust invasion creates food crisis for one million Ethiopians, thousands dying a day
[3:10:50.020 --> 3:10:57.220]  from no food, French news agency, that's okay, New York, new debt, virus creates perfect
[3:10:57.220 --> 3:11:02.740]  storm for slavery in India, slavery exploding, Reuters reports thinks of this, Chernobyl's
[3:11:02.740 --> 3:11:09.260]  on fire again, no big deal, liberal, but the Pope says we need a uniform economy and everybody
[3:11:09.260 --> 3:11:14.340]  gets a virtual income but there'll be no food to buy with the money, and it just goes on
[3:11:14.340 --> 3:11:15.340]  from there.
[3:11:15.340 --> 3:11:22.500]  I've got a whole area I want to get to right here, here it is, Pope says pandemic could
[3:11:22.500 --> 3:11:28.340]  be nature's revenge for ignoring climate change, yes, you deserve to die, well don't worry,
[3:11:28.340 --> 3:11:34.540]  plenty are going to die, lockdowns are fine with a rich but millions too poor to shelter
[3:11:34.540 --> 3:11:41.740]  from coronavirus will die NBC News, but then so in the lockdown, well if five people die
[3:11:41.740 --> 3:11:49.340]  in the west, it's too many, let a thousand die in Africa, liberal, liberal, liberal.
[3:11:49.340 --> 3:11:55.100]  I am so afraid coronavirus isolation brings grave, new hardships to the world's poor,
[3:11:55.100 --> 3:11:59.980]  the woman decides which child she'll feed and which will die, you imagine what that's
[3:11:59.980 --> 3:12:04.220]  going for her but it's okay, it's so fun to go to Whole Foods and wear your new Varice
[3:12:04.220 --> 3:12:08.580]  mask and get all upset and go oh god we're in a war, it's so scary, go back and watch
[3:12:08.580 --> 3:12:12.220]  Netflix and play with yourself all day.
[3:12:12.220 --> 3:12:21.220]  Climate apartheid to push 120 million into poverty, UN says so, we didn't pair carbon
[3:12:21.220 --> 3:12:24.220]  tax, they're all going to die but now the UN is done, just what will kill them, half
[3:12:24.220 --> 3:12:30.620]  a million more people face poverty or virus, ABC News, around 400 million Indians to sleep
[3:12:30.620 --> 3:12:34.580]  deeper into poverty than coronavirus, millions of starved to death from malnutrition where
[3:12:34.580 --> 3:12:39.940]  normal viruses just kill them but that's just the normal virus, not as sexy as corona.
[3:12:39.940 --> 3:12:44.540]  The poor will starve to death under quarantine in developing countries, Telegraph, that's
[3:12:44.540 --> 3:12:51.020]  okay, in Zimbabwe, hunger wins out when coronavirus fears, it's not going to be starved to death
[3:12:51.020 --> 3:12:55.900]  to stay away from me, some countries face an awful question, death by coronavirus or
[3:12:55.900 --> 3:13:02.060]  hunger, all these little girls need to die little boys, a little malnour, die, there's
[3:13:02.060 --> 3:13:07.020]  too many of you, it's for the earth, the pope said, mother nature's killing you, the old
[3:13:07.020 --> 3:13:11.420]  degenerate pope, he's not going to die, you're going to die, Nigerians face starvation as
[3:13:11.420 --> 3:13:17.220]  Africa's largest city enters lockdown, it's okay, you don't want to die of that virus
[3:13:17.220 --> 3:13:27.780]  if 100 times die of starvation, we will starve Zimbabwe's poor, it's okay, it's okay, just
[3:13:27.780 --> 3:13:36.980]  die, it's liberal, okay, it's all, it's okay, look I'm sorry I can't get to Steve, Sue,
[3:13:36.980 --> 3:13:42.620]  Dominic, Johnny, James and Chase, I got to like 30 calls, did the best I could, I was
[3:13:42.620 --> 3:13:48.460]  going to take a few days off of my children just because I need to, but who knows if I
[3:13:48.460 --> 3:13:56.500]  will, I don't know anymore, but I know this, this is a weapon to depopulate, this is a
[3:13:56.500 --> 3:14:01.060]  weapon to kill the economy and make those of the less subservient and poor in position
[3:14:01.060 --> 3:14:08.780]  for extermination later, but for the third world, their time is here, their time for
[3:14:08.780 --> 3:14:12.460]  euthanasia has begun.
[3:14:12.460 --> 3:14:16.420]  So Gerald Salente takes over, we're going to air the soiling green intro, we'll come
[3:14:16.420 --> 3:14:20.700]  back on the other side from like six years ago, totally pertinent, because when they
[3:14:20.700 --> 3:14:26.100]  teach you not to care about yourself or care about others, you've been taught to be a slave.
[3:14:26.100 --> 3:14:29.780]  Please remember too, your word of mouth is king, it's paramount, it's the coin of the
[3:14:29.780 --> 3:14:30.780]  realm.
[3:14:30.780 --> 3:14:34.940]  When you tell folks about Bandot Video or M4Wars.com or NewsWars.com or you share an article, you
[3:14:34.940 --> 3:14:39.500]  share a video, it transcends their censorship and totally pisses off the globalist.
[3:14:39.500 --> 3:14:42.340]  And when you buy products that you and your family already need, like high quality vitamin
[3:14:42.340 --> 3:14:47.620]  D3, back at StockwinnerSun, 50% off X3, selling out very soon, 60% off so good for you and
[3:14:47.620 --> 3:14:51.860]  your family, real red pill, vitamin, real fusion for your children and adults, all of
[3:14:51.860 --> 3:14:55.060]  it, 40 to 60% off M4Wars.com.
[3:14:55.060 --> 3:14:56.580]  And who knows how long this stuff will be available.
[3:14:56.580 --> 3:14:59.500]  I mean, I told you that, you see them trying to shut us down.
[3:14:59.500 --> 3:15:04.060]  But as long as you provision, I said to the future, we'll be able to keep on and operate
[3:15:04.060 --> 3:15:05.060]  as long as we can.
[3:15:05.060 --> 3:15:07.820]  I want to thank the crew for the great job they've done.
[3:15:07.820 --> 3:15:10.860]  I just want to thank all the listeners for what you've done as well and just remind you
[3:15:10.860 --> 3:15:15.340]  that just because they're over hyping this doesn't mean it's not a real threat.
[3:15:15.340 --> 3:15:17.420]  It's a threat against the economy, the culture, everything.
[3:15:17.420 --> 3:15:21.660]  And before this was going on, I said, get your vitamin D3 winner's son, your DNA force
[3:15:21.660 --> 3:15:28.340]  plus 50% off back in stock, get your, so many other great products like the living defense,
[3:15:28.340 --> 3:15:29.340]  wow.
[3:15:29.340 --> 3:15:32.580]  But I promise Sue and Steve and Johnny, we never do this, we always promise to never
[3:15:32.580 --> 3:15:33.580]  do this.
[3:15:33.580 --> 3:15:36.260]  The one thing I lie about, it's not on purpose, I always say, we'll call these callers back
[3:15:36.260 --> 3:15:40.140]  tomorrow, but they never answer actually, but I appreciate you holding and I'm sorry
[3:15:40.140 --> 3:15:41.140]  we didn't get to you.
[3:15:41.140 --> 3:15:47.900]  All right, the silent green piece with Charlton Essent from the grave and then Gerald Salente
[3:15:47.900 --> 3:15:48.900]  takes over.
[3:15:48.900 --> 3:15:53.780]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[3:15:53.780 --> 3:15:54.900]  my mother's house.
[3:15:54.900 --> 3:15:56.420]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:15:56.420 --> 3:15:59.380]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:15:59.380 --> 3:16:02.660]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:16:02.660 --> 3:16:04.900]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:04.900 --> 3:16:06.220]  I can help you too.
[3:16:06.220 --> 3:16:10.340]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[3:16:10.340 --> 3:16:11.460]  tax case.
[3:16:11.460 --> 3:16:19.380]  Call 834 no tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:16:19.380 --> 3:16:24.780]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[3:16:24.780 --> 3:16:25.780]  the world.
[3:16:25.780 --> 3:16:28.780]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[3:16:28.780 --> 3:16:34.740]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[3:16:34.740 --> 3:16:38.540]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[3:16:38.540 --> 3:16:39.780]  Was there ever a vote?
[3:16:39.780 --> 3:16:41.100]  Who do we fight for?
[3:16:41.100 --> 3:16:47.620]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available
[3:16:47.620 --> 3:16:50.540]  at Amazon Books.
[3:16:50.540 --> 3:16:55.460]  House flies defecate every four to five minutes, spreading diseases and germs.

[3:17:20.100 --> 3:17:25.180]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate dot com.
[3:17:25.180 --> 3:17:29.100]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave
[3:17:29.100 --> 3:17:30.580]  my family to freedom.
[3:17:30.580 --> 3:17:34.980]  Today we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool
[3:17:34.980 --> 3:17:38.540]  our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking ogres.
[3:17:38.540 --> 3:17:42.380]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real
[3:17:42.380 --> 3:17:43.980]  Estate team is here to help.
[3:17:43.980 --> 3:18:08.980]  Go to blackriflerealestate.com, that's blackriflerealestate.com.
[3:18:08.980 --> 3:18:13.780]  These are some later generation of systems that are on record for more than 70 years
[3:18:13.780 --> 3:18:15.380]  to cause cancer.
[3:18:15.380 --> 3:18:18.340]  They rub the DNA molecules together.
[3:18:18.340 --> 3:18:20.940]  They are microwaves.
[3:18:20.940 --> 3:18:26.460]  Well now, YouTube has admitted to the BBC and others that they're banning anyone criticizing
[3:18:26.460 --> 3:18:27.460]  5G.
[3:18:27.460 --> 3:18:30.900]  Even if you don't connect it to coronavirus, they're banning it.
[3:18:30.900 --> 3:18:35.780]  But the studies do show that 5G lowers your immunity to viruses, period.
[3:18:35.780 --> 3:18:37.660]  They're peer reviewed journals.
[3:18:37.660 --> 3:18:41.540]  They're showing these documents on air, and the globalists can go to hell.
[3:18:41.540 --> 3:18:44.860]  The human rebellion against globalist machines has begun.
[3:18:44.860 --> 3:18:47.060]  We're not troglodytes afraid of technology.
[3:18:47.060 --> 3:18:50.660]  We don't like technology with Trojan horse anti-human crap in it.
[3:18:50.660 --> 3:18:54.740]  One of the best nutrients nature has provided, beetroot, has been used for hundreds of years
[3:18:54.740 --> 3:18:56.020]  in natural medicine.
[3:18:56.020 --> 3:19:00.260]  Now you can experience the power of this ingredient today with VasoBeat from M4's

[3:19:25.020 --> 3:19:28.940]  The elective pure pro-water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the
[3:19:28.940 --> 3:19:32.060]  M4's crew use every day for the purest water possible.
[3:19:32.060 --> 3:19:35.380]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy and delicious drinking
[3:19:35.380 --> 3:19:36.380]  water.
[3:19:36.380 --> 3:19:39.500]  If you have any preppers or anyone concerned with a healthier source of water, the elective
[3:19:39.500 --> 3:19:43.060]  pure pro can remove up to 99.9% of impurities.
[3:19:43.060 --> 3:19:47.380]  This groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system is like no other.
[3:19:47.380 --> 3:19:53.860]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the elective pure pro.
[3:19:53.860 --> 3:20:16.940]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:16.940 --> 3:20:22.700]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals
[3:20:22.700 --> 3:20:23.700]  in the U.K.
[3:20:23.700 --> 3:20:33.140]  It is sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[3:20:33.140 --> 3:20:35.740]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[3:20:35.740 --> 3:20:38.500]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[3:20:38.500 --> 3:20:43.100]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soil and Green is in short supply.
[3:20:43.100 --> 3:20:46.180]  Remember, Tuesday is Soil and Green Day.
[3:20:46.180 --> 3:20:49.740]  The supply of Soil and Green has been exhausted.
[3:20:49.740 --> 3:20:55.020]  You must evacuate the area.
[3:20:55.020 --> 3:21:02.660]  The shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group company, are not allowed to know what
[3:21:02.660 --> 3:21:06.540]  they're using the baby parts for and the flavoring, but we already know.
[3:21:06.540 --> 3:21:08.500]  So enjoy the flavor.
[3:21:08.500 --> 3:21:11.700]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels
[3:21:11.700 --> 3:21:12.980]  and sales taxes.
[3:21:12.980 --> 3:21:14.940]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[3:21:14.940 --> 3:21:16.860]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[3:21:16.860 --> 3:21:18.140]  I'm for regular suicide.
[3:21:18.140 --> 3:21:20.140]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[3:21:20.140 --> 3:21:24.500]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would
[3:21:24.500 --> 3:21:31.540]  it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[3:21:31.540 --> 3:21:35.860]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[3:21:35.860 --> 3:21:50.380]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[3:21:50.380 --> 3:21:53.020]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[3:21:53.020 --> 3:21:57.860]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[3:21:57.860 --> 3:22:00.460]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[3:22:00.460 --> 3:22:05.420]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison
[3:22:05.420 --> 3:22:09.820]  guards, on the quizzlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[3:22:09.820 --> 3:22:12.420]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[3:22:12.420 --> 3:22:14.420]  The scoops are on their way.
[3:22:14.420 --> 3:22:16.420]  The scoops are on their way.
[3:22:16.420 --> 3:22:20.420]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[3:22:20.420 --> 3:22:23.420]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[3:22:23.420 --> 3:22:27.420]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[3:22:27.420 --> 3:22:29.420]  We've got to stop them.
[3:22:29.420 --> 3:22:30.420]  Come on.
[3:22:30.420 --> 3:22:34.420]  That is my secret name, Soylent Green.
[3:22:34.420 --> 3:22:39.420]  Soylent Green is people.
[3:22:39.420 --> 3:22:44.420]  They may just say they'll be breeding us like cattle for food.
[3:22:44.420 --> 3:22:59.420]  You've got to tell them.
[3:22:59.420 --> 3:23:04.420]  Welcome a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order.
[3:23:04.420 --> 3:23:06.420]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:23:06.420 --> 3:23:14.420]  And now, your host, Gerald Soylenti.
[3:23:14.420 --> 3:23:15.420]  Hello, hello.
[3:23:15.420 --> 3:23:18.420]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[3:23:18.420 --> 3:23:26.420]  And here we are in the midst of the pandemonium panic being brought to you by the prostitutes
[3:23:26.420 --> 3:23:30.420]  around the world, spreading fear and hysteria.
[3:23:30.420 --> 3:23:35.420]  And so all this is, as I see it, and only going by the numbers.
[3:23:35.420 --> 3:23:44.420]  And the numbers add up to, at this time, over 100,000 people dead around the world
[3:23:44.420 --> 3:23:49.420]  in a global population of 7.7 billion people.
[3:23:49.420 --> 3:23:58.420]  And how many people are dying over there in Yemen of cholera and Ebola?
[3:23:58.420 --> 3:24:02.420]  About 10 million of them starvation.
[3:24:02.420 --> 3:24:05.420]  And we won't talk about that.
[3:24:05.420 --> 3:24:10.420]  Again, these numbers are tiny, but this is the way the media escalates it.
[3:24:10.420 --> 3:24:15.420]  This is from the toilet paper of record, the New York Times.
[3:24:15.420 --> 3:24:19.420]  And worldwide death toll surpasses 100,000.
[3:24:19.420 --> 3:24:22.420]  All right, that's the headline up here.
[3:24:22.420 --> 3:24:31.420]  How come you didn't say worldwide death toll surpasses 100,000 when an estimated 650,000
[3:24:31.420 --> 3:24:33.420]  died of the flu last year?
[3:24:33.420 --> 3:24:43.420]  I'll tell you why, because you're a bunch of...
[3:24:43.420 --> 3:24:51.420]  This house quarantine by the media, controlled by the government, controlled by the elite,
[3:24:51.420 --> 3:24:59.420]  is nothing more than house arrest while they construct the 5G towers.
[3:24:59.420 --> 3:25:05.420]  Every single day, patients are lining up outside here, many of them with cold and flu-like symptoms.
[3:25:05.420 --> 3:25:07.420]  They come here to be tested.
[3:25:07.420 --> 3:25:12.420]  This is bad. People are dying. We don't have the tools that we need.
[3:25:12.420 --> 3:25:14.420]  New people waiting in the cold to get care.
[3:25:14.420 --> 3:25:19.420]  The hospital tells us every day they're working to increase the capacity of this hospital
[3:25:19.420 --> 3:25:22.420]  by flooding it with nurses and doctors and equipment.
[3:25:22.420 --> 3:25:28.420]  Outside, it's swamped with New Yorkers waiting in long lines to get tested for the coronavirus.
[3:25:28.420 --> 3:25:32.420]  This is the emergency room, and you would expect, if you believe the mainstream media,
[3:25:32.420 --> 3:25:35.420]  that this emergency room would be overflowing with people.
[3:25:35.420 --> 3:25:39.420]  And as you can tell, there are no people here.
[3:25:39.420 --> 3:25:44.420]  America is not prepared, and nurses are not being protected.
[3:25:44.420 --> 3:25:49.420]  Coronavirus! She's real! She's getting real!
[3:25:49.420 --> 3:25:59.420]  I quit my job today. I went into work, and I was assigned to a COVID patient on an ICU unit
[3:25:59.420 --> 3:26:03.420]  that has been converted to a designated COVID unit.
[3:26:03.420 --> 3:26:04.420]  It's like a war zone.
[3:26:04.420 --> 3:26:10.420]  None of the nurses are wearing masks, not even surgical masks in the hallways
[3:26:10.420 --> 3:26:12.420]  when they're giving report to each other.
[3:26:12.420 --> 3:26:13.420]  Everybody is terrified.
[3:26:13.420 --> 3:26:18.420]  I had my own N95 mask. I told my manager I understand we're short on supplies,
[3:26:18.420 --> 3:26:23.420]  but let me protect myself. Let me feel safe.
[3:26:23.420 --> 3:26:28.420]  I have family that I have to come home to, and the way things are looking,
[3:26:28.420 --> 3:26:36.420]  this isn't going to get any better. America is not prepared, and nurses are not being protected.
[3:26:36.420 --> 3:26:38.420]  Don't worry!
[3:26:38.420 --> 3:26:59.420]  Don't stand so, don't stand so close to me.
[3:26:59.420 --> 3:27:15.420]  Big booty, big booty, what you gotta be is dirty.
[3:27:15.420 --> 3:27:28.420]  What is going on?
[3:27:28.420 --> 3:27:33.420]  You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future.
[3:27:33.420 --> 3:27:37.420]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[3:27:37.420 --> 3:27:39.420]  This is not a new world.
[3:27:39.420 --> 3:27:43.420]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[3:27:43.420 --> 3:27:48.420]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot
[3:27:48.420 --> 3:27:52.420]  on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[3:27:52.420 --> 3:28:00.420]  It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[3:28:00.420 --> 3:28:06.420]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[3:28:06.420 --> 3:28:13.420]  Logic is an enemy, and truth is a menace.
[3:28:13.420 --> 3:28:16.420]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[3:28:16.420 --> 3:28:20.420]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state,
[3:28:20.420 --> 3:28:27.420]  but will soon have to be eliminated, because he's built out of flesh, and because he has a mind.
[3:28:27.420 --> 3:28:56.420]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[3:28:57.420 --> 3:28:59.420]  Have you ever thought about how CBD may help you?

[3:29:50.420 --> 3:29:54.420]  It's incontrovertible. Humanity is dying.
[3:29:54.420 --> 3:30:01.420]  Every metric, every gauge we have shows that we're living shorter lives,
[3:30:01.420 --> 3:30:07.420]  we are diseased, our IQs are plunging, and we're ugly.
[3:30:07.420 --> 3:30:09.420]  We're falling apart.
[3:30:09.420 --> 3:30:13.420]  Big Pharma and the entire lovelest operation is a kill grid.
[3:30:13.420 --> 3:30:15.420]  And the studies are clear.
[3:30:15.420 --> 3:30:21.420]  The average person is in a dream-like state, a near-dream-like daydream world
[3:30:21.420 --> 3:30:25.420]  program of the flicker rates of the televisions and all the screens.
[3:30:25.420 --> 3:30:33.420]  We are in a trance, and now they're turning up the power of the ambient electromagnetic radiation,
[3:30:33.420 --> 3:30:38.420]  which, again, all the studies conclusively show, cause massive cancer
[3:30:38.420 --> 3:30:43.420]  and destroy your immune system and push viruses across the cell membrane.
[3:30:43.420 --> 3:30:45.420]  We are being murdered.
[3:30:45.420 --> 3:30:50.420]  And I've got to tell you, it's very sophisticated and looks not human.
[3:30:50.420 --> 3:30:53.420]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense,
[3:30:53.420 --> 3:30:58.420]  and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[3:30:58.420 --> 3:31:00.420]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast.
[3:31:00.420 --> 3:31:04.420]  And I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[3:31:04.420 --> 3:31:06.420]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[3:31:06.420 --> 3:31:08.420]  I looked. In January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[3:31:08.420 --> 3:31:12.420]  I went in the VA hospital out here in Boyce, and I was in there until June.
[3:31:12.420 --> 3:31:17.420]  The only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars three hours a day,
[3:31:17.420 --> 3:31:21.420]  and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about Living Defense.
[3:31:21.420 --> 3:31:22.420]  Let me tell you something, man.
[3:31:22.420 --> 3:31:27.420]  I had an internal digestive problem, and I suffered with it for about five or six years,
[3:31:27.420 --> 3:31:29.420]  and the doctors, they tried every test.
[3:31:29.420 --> 3:31:30.420]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[3:31:30.420 --> 3:31:33.420]  And then every day, when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials,
[3:31:33.420 --> 3:31:36.420]  I said, you know what, I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[3:31:36.420 --> 3:31:39.420]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff,
[3:31:39.420 --> 3:31:43.420]  but I ordered it, had it shipped to me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses.
[3:31:43.420 --> 3:31:46.420]  I started taking it, man, that stuff changed my life.
[3:31:46.420 --> 3:31:47.420]  It saved my life.
[3:31:47.420 --> 3:31:50.420]  Alex Jones and info wars saved my life.
[3:31:50.420 --> 3:31:57.420]  What's amazing about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights is that even though it's 240 years old,
[3:31:57.420 --> 3:32:02.420]  it's more pertinent and more powerful today than it's ever been.
[3:32:02.420 --> 3:32:07.420]  We look at the huge AI takeover and total surveillance of our lives,
[3:32:07.420 --> 3:32:13.420]  and the theory that comes with it, the oppression, and it's all linked to not having due process
[3:32:13.420 --> 3:32:18.420]  and not having a Fourth Amendment against being illegally surveilled.
[3:32:18.420 --> 3:32:23.420]  It's all predicated on having no privacy.
[3:32:23.420 --> 3:32:28.420]  If we simply embrace the Bill of Rights and Constitution and enforce that against big tech,
[3:32:28.420 --> 3:32:30.420]  they would never get away with this.
[3:32:30.420 --> 3:32:35.420]  But because we're not enforcing our Bill of Rights and Constitution based in common sense,
[3:32:35.420 --> 3:32:39.420]  the bottom is falling out and the sky is just the beginning.
[3:32:39.420 --> 3:32:41.420]  It's certainly not the limit.
[3:32:41.420 --> 3:32:45.420]  That's why we rediscover what made America great and what the Renaissance is all about.
[3:32:45.420 --> 3:32:47.420]  True human empowerment.
[3:32:47.420 --> 3:33:12.420]  It begins at infowars.com.
[3:33:12.420 --> 3:33:18.420]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:33:18.420 --> 3:33:24.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[3:33:24.420 --> 3:33:30.420]  Hello, I'm back.
[3:33:30.420 --> 3:33:35.420]  I'm only on a cell phone and I don't carry one of these things.
[3:33:35.420 --> 3:33:39.420]  There's a guy walking down the street.
[3:33:39.420 --> 3:33:42.420]  We lost our power here in Kingston.
[3:33:42.420 --> 3:33:44.420]  Yeah, a third world country over here.
[3:33:44.420 --> 3:33:47.420]  We had a little rainstorm and some wind.
[3:33:47.420 --> 3:33:50.420]  So all the power is out, all the landlines are down.
[3:33:50.420 --> 3:33:53.420]  And this guy, there's nobody out in the street over here.
[3:33:53.420 --> 3:33:58.420]  And, you know, this is a pretty, you know, it's not a bustling city.
[3:33:58.420 --> 3:34:01.420]  This cat's walking down the street with a mascot.
[3:34:01.420 --> 3:34:03.420]  He sees me.
[3:34:03.420 --> 3:34:06.420]  He runs across the street to get away.
[3:34:06.420 --> 3:34:09.420]  The memory bodies freaking out on this thing.
[3:34:09.420 --> 3:34:11.420]  The freaks of one.
[3:34:11.420 --> 3:34:16.420]  I was reading to you the headlines from the toilet paper record in the New York Times,
[3:34:16.420 --> 3:34:18.420]  the coronavirus update.
[3:34:18.420 --> 3:34:22.420]  Worldwide death toll surpasses 100,000.
[3:34:22.420 --> 3:34:27.420]  But they don't tell us when, you know, 650,000 are dying from a flu each year.
[3:34:27.420 --> 3:34:30.420]  They don't have that coming up every day.
[3:34:30.420 --> 3:34:37.420]  Now, how about the 480,000 people in America that have died of the,
[3:34:37.420 --> 3:34:44.420]  if I'm smoking them a cigarette, more doctors smoke camels than any other cigarette.
[3:34:44.420 --> 3:34:47.420]  And that's what they used to promote when I was a kid.
[3:34:47.420 --> 3:34:54.420]  Some of the predictions that it would be a devastating week turned out to be true.
[3:34:54.420 --> 3:35:01.420]  Validated by a terrifying six digit number.
[3:35:01.420 --> 3:35:05.420]  100,745.
[3:35:05.420 --> 3:35:10.420]  The worldwide death toll in the coronavirus pandemic.
[3:35:10.420 --> 3:35:12.420]  That's the New York Times.
[3:35:12.420 --> 3:35:16.420]  Do you need any more proof of the high hysteria that they're selling?
[3:35:16.420 --> 3:35:22.420]  Hey, you swiney little lowlives, as I was saying before we went off the air.
[3:35:22.420 --> 3:35:26.420]  How about all the murders going on, huh?
[3:35:26.420 --> 3:35:31.420]  Well, Obama was born in 4,000, you know, with them Jones strikes.
[3:35:31.420 --> 3:35:37.420]  Hey, how about that million killed in Iraq by George W. Bush?
[3:35:37.420 --> 3:35:40.420]  You want to know how ignorant and stupid the people are,
[3:35:40.420 --> 3:35:45.420]  and how you see all these politicians popping up in the poll ratings.
[3:35:45.420 --> 3:35:51.420]  That guy knew some, do some, screw some, whatever he is over there in California.
[3:35:51.420 --> 3:35:54.420]  Overholding, hand job, whatever his name.
[3:35:54.420 --> 3:36:01.420]  Over here in the, down here in Maryland is another governor up there in Michigan.
[3:36:01.420 --> 3:36:05.420]  Well, the one in New York, all their polls, are they really going up?
[3:36:05.420 --> 3:36:06.420]  People love them.
[3:36:06.420 --> 3:36:13.420]  Oh, yeah, they're doing a great job.
[3:36:13.420 --> 3:36:22.420]  They're doing a great job, and the people, the people are just enamored with them.
[3:36:22.420 --> 3:36:25.420]  And look what they're doing, robbing us of our rights.
[3:36:25.420 --> 3:36:29.420]  Lowlife politicians telling us what to do.
[3:36:29.420 --> 3:36:31.420]  Nobody cares.
[3:36:31.420 --> 3:36:35.420]  We got them preying over it, but great job they're doing.
[3:36:35.420 --> 3:36:40.420]  One after another, robbing us of our rights.
[3:36:40.420 --> 3:36:44.420]  So daddy's boy over here, Andy Cuomo, named the bridge after his papa.
[3:36:44.420 --> 3:36:46.420]  His father's better than mine.
[3:36:46.420 --> 3:36:49.420]  No, no, no, take it easy, Andy, boy.
[3:36:49.420 --> 3:36:51.420]  Going on third base.
[3:36:51.420 --> 3:36:54.420]  They are selling the fear and hysteria.
[3:36:54.420 --> 3:36:56.420]  And the facts don't buy it at all.
[3:36:56.420 --> 3:37:01.420]  The facts are there for everybody to look at.
[3:37:01.420 --> 3:37:03.420]  And I went back to Cuomo.
[3:37:03.420 --> 3:37:05.420]  I did this on our Trends in the News broadcast.
[3:37:05.420 --> 3:37:11.420]  And remember, you can follow me on YouTube, subscribe to the Trends Journal and TrendsJournal.com.
[3:37:11.420 --> 3:37:13.420]  The only magazine that tells you what's going on.
[3:37:13.420 --> 3:37:14.420]  And spread the word.
[3:37:14.420 --> 3:37:16.420]  We have to band together.
[3:37:16.420 --> 3:37:21.420]  Rule law expands Cuomo's power during coronavirus outbreak.
[3:37:21.420 --> 3:37:27.420]  This goes back to March 16th.
[3:37:27.420 --> 3:37:29.420]  March 3rd, excuse me.
[3:37:29.420 --> 3:37:34.420]  Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a law Tuesday that expands his emergency management powers.
[3:37:34.420 --> 3:37:39.420]  A move that drew bipartisan criticism.
[3:37:39.420 --> 3:37:42.420]  But that the Democratic governor said it's justified.
[3:37:42.420 --> 3:37:45.420]  Oh yeah, the Democratic, this is what I was saying.
[3:37:45.420 --> 3:37:49.420]  The Democratic governor to show how stupid the people are.
[3:37:49.420 --> 3:37:51.420]  And I'm going through all the names.
[3:37:51.420 --> 3:37:54.420]  Billions of people being killed in wars and everything.
[3:37:54.420 --> 3:37:55.420]  That's not news.
[3:37:55.420 --> 3:37:58.420]  The people are so stupid.
[3:37:58.420 --> 3:38:01.420]  They're so ignorant to follow these politicians.
[3:38:01.420 --> 3:38:04.420]  And you see now they're poll ratings going way up.
[3:38:04.420 --> 3:38:06.420]  Get this in your head.
[3:38:06.420 --> 3:38:10.420]  How about a long-life piece of stupid garbage?
[3:38:10.420 --> 3:38:16.420]  When you're looking at them in the face, you say, how can anybody with a brain bigger than a plate
[3:38:16.420 --> 3:38:23.420]  think that this stupid moron with a product del carano is smaller than a moth?
[3:38:23.420 --> 3:38:24.420]  Balls.
[3:38:24.420 --> 3:38:26.420]  They are not the ones you put in your closet.
[3:38:26.420 --> 3:38:29.420]  Smaller than the ones on a moth.
[3:38:29.420 --> 3:38:36.420]  How would anybody believe George W. Bush?
[3:38:36.420 --> 3:38:40.420]  Saddam Hussein has opened some instruction and ties to Al-Qaeda.
[3:38:40.420 --> 3:38:44.420]  Oh yeah, remember when I landed on that aircraft carrier?
[3:38:44.420 --> 3:38:46.420]  Yep, we won.
[3:38:46.420 --> 3:38:47.420]  Yep.
[3:38:47.420 --> 3:38:49.420]  Just like they're doing now.
[3:38:49.420 --> 3:38:51.420]  That's how stupid the people are.
[3:38:51.420 --> 3:38:56.420]  That little slimy lowlife murderous piece of garbage crap bush.
[3:38:56.420 --> 3:39:03.420]  This popularity rating sort to 60% following 9-11.
[3:39:03.420 --> 3:39:06.420]  Taking us to war against Afghanistan.
[3:39:06.420 --> 3:39:07.420]  They didn't do anything to us.
[3:39:07.420 --> 3:39:10.420]  Hey, how are you going to show me bin Laden's there?
[3:39:10.420 --> 3:39:12.420]  And we've got to go there.
[3:39:12.420 --> 3:39:14.420]  There's the longest war in American history.
[3:39:14.420 --> 3:39:15.420]  We don't have an exit strategy.
[3:39:15.420 --> 3:39:17.420]  Just like we don't have one for this.
[3:39:17.420 --> 3:39:18.420]  We're sick.
[3:39:18.420 --> 3:39:20.420]  We're sick-demented people.
[3:39:20.420 --> 3:39:22.420]  We're politicians.
[3:39:22.420 --> 3:39:27.420]  Someone that's manipulative and devious to believe against the ass movement of the organization.
[3:39:27.420 --> 3:39:28.420]  Yeah, then.
[3:39:28.420 --> 3:39:30.420]  And they're doing the same thing now.
[3:39:30.420 --> 3:39:35.420]  And the little sheep are following one after another,
[3:39:35.420 --> 3:39:37.420]  bowing down to politicians.
[3:39:37.420 --> 3:39:40.420]  And here's what else has happened.
[3:39:40.420 --> 3:39:47.420]  Because my friend Stephen Green has put in my mind and made very clear to me.
[3:39:47.420 --> 3:39:51.420]  The morons are on a power trip.
[3:39:51.420 --> 3:39:54.420]  They're giving us to go into the supermarket now.
[3:39:54.420 --> 3:39:57.420]  They've got to beat those shields up now.
[3:39:57.420 --> 3:39:59.420]  They're telling you to put money down.
[3:39:59.420 --> 3:40:00.420]  They yell at you.
[3:40:00.420 --> 3:40:03.420]  They told us we weren't allowed to.
[3:40:03.420 --> 3:40:06.420]  We had to be bringing reusable bags into New York.
[3:40:06.420 --> 3:40:08.420]  They weren't giving out bags anymore.
[3:40:08.420 --> 3:40:11.420]  You had to pay for a plastic bag when you went shopping.
[3:40:11.420 --> 3:40:12.420]  A paper bag rather.
[3:40:12.420 --> 3:40:15.420]  Now you can't bring a reusable bag in.
[3:40:15.420 --> 3:40:19.420]  But after they were selling them to us, the 50 cents a bag.
[3:40:19.420 --> 3:40:21.420]  Now it's reusable.
[3:40:21.420 --> 3:40:22.420]  You bring it into fires.
[3:40:22.420 --> 3:40:25.420]  And now you've got these little red lives everywhere.
[3:40:25.420 --> 3:40:28.420]  Don't they love it?
[3:40:28.420 --> 3:40:30.420]  This is how communism goes.
[3:40:30.420 --> 3:40:32.420]  This is how Stalinism.
[3:40:32.420 --> 3:40:35.420]  This is how Hitlerism, Muslimism.
[3:40:35.420 --> 3:40:40.420]  And now we have Americanism with a K in there.
[3:40:40.420 --> 3:40:44.420]  And a little people telling us what to do and how to do it.
[3:40:44.420 --> 3:40:49.420]  Stand in line.
[3:40:49.420 --> 3:40:54.420]  One of my employees yesterday, the day before,
[3:40:54.420 --> 3:40:57.420]  went to get some things on Saturday.
[3:40:57.420 --> 3:40:59.420]  And he's not allowed to go in the stores.
[3:40:59.420 --> 3:41:01.420]  They meet you outside, curbside service.
[3:41:01.420 --> 3:41:03.420]  He goes up to the store.
[3:41:03.420 --> 3:41:04.420]  She's standing behind the line.
[3:41:04.420 --> 3:41:06.420]  She's standing away from the guy.
[3:41:06.420 --> 3:41:09.420]  I say, you're not six feet away from me.
[3:41:09.420 --> 3:41:12.420]  She says, I am.
[3:41:12.420 --> 3:41:13.420]  No, you're not.
[3:41:13.420 --> 3:41:15.420]  You're in my five feet away from here.
[3:41:15.420 --> 3:41:19.420]  This is why you call the police, all right?
[3:41:19.420 --> 3:41:28.420]  The morons, the idiots, the dumbest little people are now on a power trip.
[3:41:28.420 --> 3:41:35.420]  Starting from the top, a lowlife like Cuomo,
[3:41:35.420 --> 3:41:38.420]  giving himself the power.
[3:41:38.420 --> 3:41:47.420]  How about that Whittler, Whittler smear, whittler's jerkless smear.
[3:41:47.420 --> 3:41:49.420]  A Michigan.
[3:41:49.420 --> 3:41:53.420]  Residents will no longer be able to jump in the car across the street
[3:41:53.420 --> 3:41:59.420]  as it finds their relatives inside a state.
[3:41:59.420 --> 3:42:04.420]  These are sick people that are running and ruining our lives.
[3:42:04.420 --> 3:42:11.420]  The Communist Chinese have won surveillance everywhere.
[3:42:11.420 --> 3:42:17.420]  We are people of the Communist states of the world.
[3:42:17.420 --> 3:42:21.420]  We'll follow the orders of your dictators.
[3:42:21.420 --> 3:42:24.420]  You all tell me what to do.
[3:42:24.420 --> 3:42:27.420]  Freedom is dead.
[3:42:27.420 --> 3:42:34.420]  And so too will we be if we don't stand up and fight.
[3:42:34.420 --> 3:42:36.420]  Support Infowars.
[3:42:36.420 --> 3:42:40.420]  Subscribe to The Trends Journal.
[3:42:40.420 --> 3:42:42.420]  Do what you can.
[3:42:42.420 --> 3:42:43.420]  Buy their products.
[3:42:43.420 --> 3:42:46.420]  Speak up.
[3:42:46.420 --> 3:42:50.420]  Freedom reigns when we stand.
[3:42:50.420 --> 3:42:55.420]  When one studies history and human nature, you learn very quickly that
[3:42:55.420 --> 3:43:00.420]  rugged individualism and people to think for themselves, build free societies,
[3:43:00.420 --> 3:43:02.420]  innovate to amazing things.
[3:43:02.420 --> 3:43:07.420]  But those that love to grovel, those that love to be subservient,
[3:43:07.420 --> 3:43:10.420]  those that love to comply and think that it's a virtue,
[3:43:10.420 --> 3:43:16.420]  they create stagnation, corruption, tyranny, and then finally collapse.
[3:43:16.420 --> 3:43:20.420]  And the world is now being tested.
[3:43:20.420 --> 3:43:26.420]  And we're seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole lives believing
[3:43:26.420 --> 3:43:32.420]  if they just submit down a bigger way, somehow they'll create a heavenly future.
[3:43:32.420 --> 3:43:38.420]  But the technocrats running the global system are oppressive and anti-human
[3:43:38.420 --> 3:43:42.420]  and are psychotic and are building an anti-human future.
[3:43:42.420 --> 3:43:51.420]  Submission to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[3:44:13.420 --> 3:44:19.420]  And get prepared yourselves and boost your immune systems and get high quality food.
[3:44:19.420 --> 3:44:21.420]  And we're able to ship storeable food.
[3:44:21.420 --> 3:44:26.420]  Again, our supplier has expanded their factories and now are able to take new wars.
[3:44:26.420 --> 3:44:28.420]  And it's not about this virus, folks.
[3:44:28.420 --> 3:44:30.420]  That's only the trigger, the detonator.
[3:44:30.420 --> 3:44:33.420]  It's about what's coming in the future where the elections may be canceled,
[3:44:33.420 --> 3:44:35.420]  where the global is trying to implode the economy.
[3:44:35.420 --> 3:44:40.420]  This is just the beginning of the crisis, not the middle and not the end.
[3:44:40.420 --> 3:44:46.420]  So get prepared now while you still can at m4store.com and please be Paul Ramirez and spread the word.
[3:44:51.420 --> 3:44:56.420]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[3:44:56.420 --> 3:45:00.420]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[3:45:00.420 --> 3:45:05.420]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[3:45:05.420 --> 3:45:13.420]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.

[3:45:30.420 --> 3:45:38.420]  The breeze in the ion cluster patented technology used in the system, eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.

[3:46:13.420 --> 3:46:19.420]  But what I'm saying is this, when you attack people with electromagnetic radiation and with microwaves,
[3:46:19.420 --> 3:46:27.420]  and when the public sees the effects, when they put them on top schools and they have huge cancer clusters, the globalists are going to have major pushback.
[3:46:27.420 --> 3:46:32.420]  And now Google is banning anybody that criticizes 5G in any way.
[3:46:32.420 --> 3:46:42.420]  They have truly proven that they are the definition of anti-human evil, and they've thrown in with the chikons who support absolute tyranny on levels never before seen.
[3:46:42.420 --> 3:46:49.420]  But the human rebellion against the technocracy has begun and will not be stopped. Join the rebellion now.
[3:47:12.420 --> 3:47:19.420]  It's Gerald Salente. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:19.420 --> 3:47:26.420]  Globalists are using COVID-19 to launch the globalist takeover. If Trump understands this, and if everybody understands this,
[3:47:26.420 --> 3:47:34.420]  we can defeat the entire new order right now instead of have them have their takeover, which is implantable microchips, forced inoculations,
[3:47:34.420 --> 3:47:42.420]  world government martial laws, all being announced as the solution. The Communist Chinese on Saturday morning
[3:47:42.420 --> 3:47:54.420]  released to what is probably one of the biggest publications in the world, the Daily Mail, a document stating that they did indeed test with bats
[3:47:54.420 --> 3:48:05.420]  in the Wuhan level four bio weapons lab coronaviruses that they took out of bats and injected into piglets.
[3:48:05.420 --> 3:48:15.420]  And when the piglets died from it, they ground up the piglets and fed it to other piglets.
[3:48:15.420 --> 3:48:24.420]  So what did the author of the US biological weapons law, who practices law, the Hague, represents presidents and prime ministers,
[3:48:24.420 --> 3:48:35.420]  you know, the guy with three Harvard degrees. He said nine weeks ago that it's a US made bio weapon given to the Chinese to be spliced
[3:48:35.420 --> 3:48:42.420]  with these airborne coronaviruses, the bats have to give a gain of function, and that while it's all being blamed on Trump,
[3:48:42.420 --> 3:48:50.420]  it's going to happen to the economy. He predicted that that it's Obama and Hillary and Fauci who were over it at the NIH,
[3:48:50.420 --> 3:49:01.420]  who allowed the programs from 2012 to 2017, because Obama funded into the year Trump was elected and got into office,
[3:49:01.420 --> 3:49:09.420]  that they allowed the transfer of this to the Communist Chinese to develop this airborne bio weapon.
[3:49:09.420 --> 3:49:13.420]  What in the hell is going on here? And what do you expect to happen now?
[3:49:13.420 --> 3:49:28.420]  If President Trump doesn't understand that this is an extremely dangerous, offensive, biological warfare weapon that we,
[3:49:28.420 --> 3:49:34.420]  the American people are facing, a lot of us are going to die.
[3:49:34.420 --> 3:49:40.420]  That's no doubt about it, because all the people Trump have around him, not counting vice president Pence,
[3:49:40.420 --> 3:49:51.420]  have been lying and covering this up from the get go and have been promoting their own interests and their own agenda.
[3:49:51.420 --> 3:49:56.420]  And right now, that is the direction in which we are moving.
[3:49:56.420 --> 3:50:05.420]  And now, the Communist Chinese come out and they released this document to the mail saying,
[3:50:05.420 --> 3:50:11.420]  yes, it turns out we lied to you, we said we weren't working with coronaviruses or bats in the laboratory,
[3:50:11.420 --> 3:50:20.420]  that it wasn't zoological, it is, but the U.S. government and Obama funded us.
[3:50:20.420 --> 3:50:26.420]  This morning, the headline on that article from the Daily Mail read,
[3:50:26.420 --> 3:50:37.420]  Wuhan Lab was performing coronavirus experiments on bats from the caves where the disease is believed to have originated with a 3 million pound grant from the USA.
[3:50:37.420 --> 3:50:43.420]  That was the headline this morning. I have audio files I sent to all the writers and everyone saying,
[3:50:43.420 --> 3:50:51.420]  I predict, prime projection, that they will later change it to make the focus the U.S., that this is a mistake in the article,
[3:50:51.420 --> 3:50:57.420]  that the main Chinese thrust of the document is to blame America, but the article didn't blame America, blame China,
[3:50:57.420 --> 3:51:00.420]  so I predict they will change the headline. Boom.
[3:51:00.420 --> 3:51:07.420]  As we go live, they put the article up, they changed it as I foresaw, because I have learned how they operate.
[3:51:07.420 --> 3:51:21.420]  The global crisis that we've all been witnessing in the last 10 months that we've all been living under is planetary martial law.
[3:51:21.420 --> 3:51:30.420]  It is the technocracy, the big corporations and authoritarian governments working in concert to bring out a world ID through your phone.
[3:51:30.420 --> 3:51:38.420]  And in a moment, I'm going to show you the headlines breaking this Saturday, where Google and Apple have announced they are merging.
[3:51:38.420 --> 3:51:44.420]  Yes, they are merging to create the world ID to save us from COVID-19.
[3:51:44.420 --> 3:51:47.420]  But first, let's look at this little tidbit.
[3:51:47.420 --> 3:51:56.420]  The governor, the Democrat in Michigan, is following suit with all other green cities and states,
[3:51:56.420 --> 3:52:04.420]  and tightening the news right when Trump prepares to start reopening the economy in most areas of the nation before a Great Depression is assured.
[3:52:04.420 --> 3:52:09.420]  She now says, don't even walk across the street to say hi to your neighbors.
[3:52:09.420 --> 3:52:16.420]  You can only walk one way down the sidewalk, not the other, and you can't visit your other home or your cabin in the woods.
[3:52:16.420 --> 3:52:18.420]  You have to stay in the city.
[3:52:18.420 --> 3:52:21.420]  I'm not kidding. You've got to read this for yourself.
[3:52:21.420 --> 3:52:31.420]  This is 1984. Remember, we told you two weeks ago from our sources that blue states like California, Michigan and others that we predicted Michigan particularly,
[3:52:31.420 --> 3:52:41.420]  we're going to then, as soon as Trump tries to reopen, say, oh, no, no, no, we're tightening down more and you've only got two days to get food, water and medicine.
[3:52:41.420 --> 3:52:44.420]  That's exactly what she's now saying is coming next.
[3:52:44.420 --> 3:52:46.420]  Serbia just did this as well.
[3:52:46.420 --> 3:52:51.420]  Communist China and the World Health Organization are the ones advising this.
[3:52:51.420 --> 3:52:58.420]  And Communist China took over the world health organization more than a decade ago by putting their people into the institution and buying them off.
[3:52:58.420 --> 3:53:09.420]  So Communist China is running blue state blue city responses and is holding America hostage in the most ancient form of war called siege.
[3:53:09.420 --> 3:53:12.420]  You are under siege and your rights are under siege.
[3:53:12.420 --> 3:53:17.420]  Some good news. Abbott here in Texas, the governor is bucking this mind control.
[3:53:17.420 --> 3:53:24.420]  And he's coming out and saying he will have an executive order out within three days that will then phase out this hysteria.
[3:53:24.420 --> 3:53:28.420]  There have been about 230 people that have died in Texas.
[3:53:28.420 --> 3:53:33.420]  Again, the flu in Texas kills more than 5,000 every single year.
[3:53:33.420 --> 3:53:37.420]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is total hysteria and mind control.
[3:53:37.420 --> 3:53:43.420]  And now let's move to this and I'll be doing a whole separate report on it for man.video on the Sunday show.
[3:53:43.420 --> 3:53:48.420]  Apple and Google are teaming up to fight COVID-19 with contact tracing.
[3:53:48.420 --> 3:53:53.420]  The so-called rivals never worked together, but now they're merging with the federal government.
[3:53:53.420 --> 3:54:04.420]  The ID tracking system, the locator system for GPS in your phones to let you know where people that have COVID-19 or might have had COVID-19 are,
[3:54:04.420 --> 3:54:08.420]  which then violates their privacy and gets us all used to being tracked.
[3:54:08.420 --> 3:54:10.420]  These systems are already in place.
[3:54:10.420 --> 3:54:12.420]  And how did I predict nine weeks ago this was coming?
[3:54:12.420 --> 3:54:14.420]  Communist China, again, runs it.
[3:54:14.420 --> 3:54:18.420]  There they used Alibaba, the biggest shopping system in China, bigger than Amazon,
[3:54:18.420 --> 3:54:23.420]  so that it's tied to your purchases to track you and your movements.
[3:54:23.420 --> 3:54:28.420]  And in the future, they say if you're not a good little globalist, you won't be able to buy or sell or have a job.
[3:54:28.420 --> 3:54:32.420]  And in China, they're already doing it. It's the social credit score.
[3:54:32.420 --> 3:54:40.420]  This is the rollout of the AI takeover, the drone surveillance, the social credit score beyond 1984 in your face.
[3:54:40.420 --> 3:54:44.420]  And it's all being done outside of the law, even outside of government.
[3:54:44.420 --> 3:54:46.420]  The corporations are just implementing it.
[3:54:46.420 --> 3:54:51.420]  And when Trump tries to end all this, the big corporations, big tech and others are going to say,
[3:54:51.420 --> 3:54:54.420]  no, we're not reopening and hold the nation hostage.
[3:54:54.420 --> 3:54:59.420]  This is a 21st century civil war with globalist forces battling American forces
[3:54:59.420 --> 3:55:03.420]  and putting this invisible enemy of COVID-19 to scare everyone into submission.
[3:55:03.420 --> 3:55:06.420]  Band-AughtVideoandInfoWars.com have a lot of other key reports on this
[3:55:06.420 --> 3:55:08.420]  that are vital to the future of you and your family.
[3:55:08.420 --> 3:55:12.420]  Please watch them, research them, and share them while you still can.
[3:55:12.420 --> 3:55:16.420]  Hi. Hello, hello, hello. We're back again.
[3:55:16.420 --> 3:55:20.420]  The power keeps coming on and off up here in Kingston, New York.
[3:55:20.420 --> 3:55:23.420]  So here's what I'm going to make this really quick. Don't have a lot of time.
[3:55:23.420 --> 3:55:28.420]  Watch Gold Price. As you know, I was the first cat out there calling the gold bull run
[3:55:28.420 --> 3:55:37.420]  June 6, 2019. Gold was at $1,332 an ounce.
[3:55:37.420 --> 3:55:47.420]  As we're speaking now, gold is at $1,713, almost $400 up.
[3:55:47.420 --> 3:55:55.420]  I believe when gold solidifies over 1730, 1740, it's going to spike to $2,000.
[3:55:55.420 --> 3:56:00.420]  I was saying earlier about how these dictators have taken over the country.
[3:56:00.420 --> 3:56:06.420]  We've become communist China worldwide. They're in total control.
[3:56:06.420 --> 3:56:10.420]  I'm going to give you something from another low life piece of garbage.
[3:56:10.420 --> 3:56:15.420]  This guy, Conti, is the Prime Minister of Italy.
[3:56:15.420 --> 3:56:19.420]  They announced on Friday that they're closing the joint down again.
[3:56:19.420 --> 3:56:22.420]  This is one of the first countries to close down until May 3.
[3:56:22.420 --> 3:56:27.420]  They know what they're doing. Over here in America, you've got to be six feet away.
[3:56:27.420 --> 3:56:31.420]  Hey, wait a minute. Over there in Europe, they say a meat hall three feet away.
[3:56:31.420 --> 3:56:36.420]  But we're making up stuff just like everybody else. If you sneeze, it goes over there.
[3:56:36.420 --> 3:56:40.420]  Again, this is all a lot of bologna. Here's what Conti said.
[3:56:40.420 --> 3:56:46.420]  This is difficult but necessary decision for which I take all political responsibility.
[3:56:46.420 --> 3:56:53.420]  Political? Someone who's manipulative and devious, typically to gain advancement within an organization. That's the fact.
[3:56:53.420 --> 3:56:58.420]  I take? Who the hell are you? How about we, the people?
[3:56:58.420 --> 3:57:04.420]  Yeah, as an Italian-American, I mean, it's a shame to the Italians as I am to the Americans,
[3:57:04.420 --> 3:57:12.420]  and they were the first ones to go down. Just like you marched to Mussolini, you're bowing down to Conti.
[3:57:12.420 --> 3:57:19.420]  All right? The same thing going on. You got this little clown there, Cuomo over here.
[3:57:19.420 --> 3:57:25.420]  I believe the worst is over. I believe. Amen, amen. I believe.
[3:57:25.420 --> 3:57:31.420]  Hey, you believe this thing was never anything? The numbers are small.
[3:57:31.420 --> 3:57:44.420]  The numbers are small. The 20,000 people died of what? 300?
