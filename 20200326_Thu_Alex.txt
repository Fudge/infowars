[00:00.000 --> 00:25.280]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25.280 --> 00:33.760]  I am seething with energy, like a volcano erupting.
[00:33.760 --> 00:41.480]  Thank you for joining us on this live Thursday, March 26, 2020, transmission with 221 days
[00:41.480 --> 00:45.760]  out from this incredibly important election.
[00:45.760 --> 00:55.040]  And now, all of our analysis, which was dead on, but still covered and missed, is coming
[00:55.040 --> 01:04.240]  in the crystal, sharp clarity of fine edges and details now coming to view from 35,000
[01:04.240 --> 01:09.120]  feet all the way down to a point blank range.
[01:09.120 --> 01:11.200]  The White House is listening.
[01:11.200 --> 01:15.120]  The world is watching.
[01:15.120 --> 01:23.000]  We have cracked the globalist code, and we know how to defeat them.
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.440]  I will cover their attempts to create a depression in the United States and bring in a permanent
[01:28.440 --> 01:33.520]  state of martial law and how we have now begun to turn the tide against that attempt.
[01:33.520 --> 01:41.880]  But then, as we always do, we give you next month and next year's news today.
[01:41.880 --> 01:46.000]  How will the globalists strike back?
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.040]  Just as they began to fail in their impeachment, I said, what will the new attack be?
[01:51.040 --> 01:55.160]  I said, probably this virus they're talking about in Wuhan.
[01:55.160 --> 01:57.920]  That was nine weeks ago.
[01:57.920 --> 02:01.960]  And now, here we are.
[02:01.960 --> 02:04.160]  We can win this.
[02:04.160 --> 02:08.720]  I'd say we're 55 to 45 right now.
[02:08.720 --> 02:16.320]  But it's ours to lose, and we could lose if we're too confident in what is going on.
[02:16.320 --> 02:20.360]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is not a spectator sport.
[02:20.360 --> 02:26.240]  All of you, whether you're old, young, black or white, are in the arena.
[02:26.240 --> 02:27.720]  This is a war.
[02:27.720 --> 02:32.480]  A war on for your mind is the Info Wars motto.
[02:32.480 --> 02:36.280]  Or you could just simply say, infowars.com.
[02:36.280 --> 02:39.880]  Think for yourself.
[02:39.880 --> 02:44.320]  David Ike is joining us on the coronavirus global takeover at the bottom of the next
[02:44.320 --> 02:46.800]  hour will be with us for an hour and a half.
[02:46.800 --> 02:51.360]  We're going to have open phones in the first hour into the second hour, and I will then
[02:51.360 --> 02:55.560]  take over completely after Ike leaves and take one hour of phone calls in the fourth
[02:55.560 --> 02:57.920]  hour ahead of the war room.
[02:57.920 --> 03:03.040]  They've got footage out that hasn't been seen yet where they decided to go on mopeds
[03:03.040 --> 03:08.800]  downtown last night, some of the crew to videotape, to shoot footage of what was going
[03:08.800 --> 03:11.880]  on in the ghost town like zombie homeless wandering around.
[03:11.880 --> 03:15.560]  That indeed happened, the police threatened to arrest them until they discovered that
[03:15.560 --> 03:19.760]  they were reporters and exempt from the lock down.
[03:19.760 --> 03:23.440]  But that footage will be premiered coming up today on the war room three o'clock central.
[03:23.440 --> 03:27.120]  Of course, David Ike is on before me doing a fantastic job as well.
[03:27.120 --> 03:32.560]  Weekday mornings, 8am central and starting next Monday, we're announcing a new show that
[03:32.560 --> 03:37.360]  will air seven to 9pm weeknights with a new special guest host.
[03:37.360 --> 03:42.320]  This is going to be a digital town hall type program with lots of guests and lots of calls,
[03:42.320 --> 03:44.800]  and it's going to be commercial free for network breaks.
[03:44.800 --> 03:49.280]  We're going to skip our TV and radio breaks for ourselves, but there will be a clock,
[03:49.280 --> 03:52.840]  a few minutes of ads at the start of the hour, the middle of the hour, and the end of the
[03:52.840 --> 03:56.320]  hour for radio and TV stations out there that are going to wish to cover this.
[03:56.320 --> 04:01.080]  We won't announce the show until Sunday evening, so look for that.
[04:01.080 --> 04:03.240]  There's so much happening, we're going to have that live.
[04:03.240 --> 04:06.880]  Special transmission that will run pretty much through the election for you.
[04:06.880 --> 04:07.880]  Okay.
[04:07.880 --> 04:11.840]  We know they're going to launch more crises, they're going to launch more attacks.
[04:11.840 --> 04:20.160]  I am going to refocus, try to get in the Zinn mode instead of Berserker mode.
[04:20.160 --> 04:28.520]  And when we return, the incredible headline now going live at infowars.com.
[04:28.520 --> 04:35.120]  Russia and the UK simultaneously announced today that the coronavirus crisis is over,
[04:35.120 --> 04:44.520]  but the Democrats are now demanding that we be shot down through the election, of course.
[04:44.520 --> 04:50.560]  And every death is Donald John Trump's fault.
[04:50.560 --> 04:59.720]  This is their hysteria, this is their operation, and it's up to us to not buy into the fear-mongering.
[04:59.720 --> 05:06.200]  I made four police state films more than a decade ago, specifically warning of the plan
[05:06.200 --> 05:11.440]  to suspend habeas corpus, the right to even have access to a court, the right to not be
[05:11.440 --> 05:14.320]  secretly arrested and secretly disappeared.
[05:14.320 --> 05:18.840]  And I warned the Patriot Act, they claimed was for terrorists, was really for the American
[05:18.840 --> 05:19.840]  people.
[05:19.840 --> 05:21.200]  Well, now they admit it is.
[05:21.200 --> 05:27.800]  And bipartisanly, the Justice Department is now openly seeking to arrest and disappear
[05:27.800 --> 05:30.040]  Americans whenever they want.
[05:30.040 --> 05:34.280]  Under the guise of coronavirus, but they just say during the emergency, it'll be for every
[05:34.280 --> 05:37.240]  other crime you can imagine.
[05:37.240 --> 05:42.520]  It's the chairing on top of a nice big fudge Sunday called martial law.
[05:42.520 --> 05:47.560]  Oh, and the sprinkles on it, it's the big, great depression everybody's going to have.
[05:47.560 --> 05:50.680]  So folks that are all excited that you're getting time off work, oh, you're going to
[05:50.680 --> 05:55.520]  get time off from your whole future, your family, your health and forced inoculations
[05:55.520 --> 06:04.720]  and gun confiscation, waging war on corruption.
[06:04.720 --> 06:15.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:15.000 --> 06:23.760]  We now know for sure that each state multinational combine in concert with their slave colony
[06:23.760 --> 06:35.680]  China launched the COVID-19 bio weapon attack in November of 2019, scripted the hysteria,
[06:35.680 --> 06:41.160]  hyped up the deaths, choreographed into the world.
[06:41.160 --> 06:49.560]  I am legend, Omega man, last man on earth, zombie apocalypse visions, set the precedent
[06:49.560 --> 06:55.880]  to roll out that whenever a contagious virus hits that can kill 5,000, 20,000, 100,000
[06:55.880 --> 07:01.400]  like the flu does routinely in the United States, we are meant to fall down on our faces
[07:01.400 --> 07:03.840]  in abject fear.
[07:03.840 --> 07:04.840]  Cash must be banned.
[07:04.840 --> 07:07.080]  We must take digital microchips to track us.
[07:07.080 --> 07:11.760]  Bill Gates' fingerprints are all over it and now it's hitting mainstream news.
[07:11.760 --> 07:18.720]  But let me make the ultra incredibly massive announcement here.
[07:18.720 --> 07:28.600]  Russia and the UK, both articles are on infowars.com came out last night while we were sleeping
[07:28.600 --> 07:34.400]  in the early morning hours and both said it is no longer a threat.
[07:34.400 --> 07:44.720]  It is no longer even rated as a danger statistically and we are ending quarantine operations.
[07:44.720 --> 07:49.160]  This is a hoax.
[07:49.160 --> 07:56.120]  Paul Joseph Watson, no need for quarantine in Russia which closed its borders, UK downgrades
[07:56.120 --> 08:06.920]  COVID-19 no longer a high consequence infectious disease, ultra massive bombshell.
[08:06.920 --> 08:12.680]  But there is absolutely no coverage in the US media, instead there is breathless fear
[08:12.680 --> 08:18.920]  mongering in the most obvious ways, run for the hells, we are all dead, there is no hope,
[08:18.920 --> 08:24.040]  jump out of buildings and people are committing suicide, got a big stack of articles on that
[08:24.040 --> 08:25.040]  front.
[08:25.040 --> 08:29.520]  We are going to walk through all of this but it gets better.
[08:29.520 --> 08:40.880]  Senator Hawley of Missouri and Senator Cotton have both come out ladies and gentlemen and
[08:40.880 --> 08:45.240]  said the chai comms knew it was killing people because it does kill old and sick, it is a
[08:45.240 --> 08:46.240]  real virus.
[08:46.240 --> 08:51.680]  But these types of viruses always are coming through, they kill tens of thousands per country.
[08:51.680 --> 08:57.320]  And they knew and lied about it and incubated it and then once they covered it up then they
[08:57.320 --> 09:01.640]  said it was more deadly than originally as a way to politically and economically hurt
[09:01.640 --> 09:05.840]  us and Trump came out in the press conference last night that clips coming up and said the
[09:05.840 --> 09:10.080]  Democrats want to extend this crisis to hurt the economy and hurt my reelection and that
[09:10.080 --> 09:16.800]  is absolutely what they want, they admit it, they said we hope it hurts Trump, we hope
[09:16.800 --> 09:20.600]  it hurts the economy, we want to plunge it and now you have Kathy Griffin and all the
[09:20.600 --> 09:26.280]  usual suspects saying they have it and it is so painful and they are victims and all the
[09:26.280 --> 09:36.080]  other globalists have it, Tom Hanks and Prince Charles, it is ridiculous how obvious it is,
[09:36.080 --> 09:41.840]  in fact it is not even obvious, they admit that they are doing it, so I am going to get
[09:41.840 --> 09:47.560]  into no need for hard quarantine in Russia, they say it is not a problem and UK downgrades
[09:47.560 --> 09:52.400]  COVID-19 no longer a high consequence infectious disease.
[09:52.400 --> 09:59.280]  The Four Nations Public Health HCID group made an interim recommendation to classify COVID-19
[09:59.280 --> 10:06.040]  as HCID, this was based on consideration the UK HCID criteria about the virus and the disease
[10:06.040 --> 10:09.240]  with information available during the early stages of the outbreak, so back then they
[10:09.240 --> 10:16.680]  said not a high consequence, Italy loses on average 50,000 people a year, some year
[10:16.680 --> 10:23.240]  70,000 plus of the flu, old smoking population that gets out in public a lot, they are not
[10:23.240 --> 10:28.520]  shut-ins over there, the Italians like their old people, that is a good thing, they don't
[10:28.520 --> 10:33.680]  warehouse them, so they live longer than most people in the world, longest in Europe, look
[10:33.680 --> 10:40.040]  up the Italians, pretty much only the Japanese are outliving them in any industrialized country
[10:40.040 --> 10:44.280]  and they revere their old people but their old people are taken out in public with them
[10:44.280 --> 10:52.120]  and so they get from their grandkids the flu and other stuff and they die, most of the people
[10:52.120 --> 10:57.520]  the 37,000 Trump saying my number is 35,000 that die every year in the US are above the
[10:57.520 --> 11:06.520]  age of 80 or they have cancer or they have failed livers and kidneys, so incredibly important
[11:06.520 --> 11:10.560]  and Russia closed down their borders early on, some of the Democrats said we shouldn't
[11:10.560 --> 11:17.720]  do and now they say they basically don't have any cases and there's no need for quarantining,
[11:17.720 --> 11:21.640]  so there you go but the big takeaway here ladies and gentlemen is the Democrats are
[11:21.640 --> 11:26.560]  holding America hostage and let me give you this little tidbit, I talked to some city
[11:26.560 --> 11:32.200]  workers I know that are involved in licensing in home inspections and building inspections
[11:32.200 --> 11:43.280]  and permitting and they said that starting on Monday, coming up on April 1st, they have
[11:43.280 --> 11:46.560]  been told they're going to stay closed for two weeks and that non-essential city employees
[11:46.560 --> 11:51.680]  go home, it's the same thing all over the country, the Democrat governors, Democrat
[11:51.680 --> 11:55.960]  mayors are going to order a shutdown when Trump says we're open for business, they're
[11:55.960 --> 12:01.520]  going to say no and then every debt that happens, they're going to personalize, every
[12:01.520 --> 12:04.960]  hospital that gets overwhelmed always happens in flu season, it's going to be the end of
[12:04.960 --> 12:08.480]  the world and it's all going to be Trump's fault, like every time there's a mass shooting
[12:08.480 --> 12:14.920]  it's his fault and gun owners' fault, do they normally show you 37,000 people that die of
[12:14.920 --> 12:18.560]  the flu and show their name and show where they came from and show their family and show
[12:18.560 --> 12:28.080]  the hospitals that got overwhelmed, no, anybody that knows hospitals knows they keep their
[12:28.080 --> 12:31.800]  beds full, if there is an epidemic they'll get people that aren't that sick out but
[12:31.800 --> 12:37.120]  if they aren't, they run the insurance up, they keep the hospitals full to make money,
[12:37.120 --> 12:43.560]  they're always full, must serve private elite clinics, we pay twice as much, you snap your
[12:43.560 --> 12:50.240]  fingers go to private clinics in America and get any surgery you want in like two days
[12:50.240 --> 12:56.040]  and guess what, there's not sick people in those buildings so you don't ever get an infection
[12:56.040 --> 13:00.880]  pretty much because it's elective type surgeries and things but they'll do emergency surgeries
[13:00.880 --> 13:07.640]  as well, so that's how this system operates ladies and gentlemen and when we come back
[13:07.640 --> 13:13.600]  the Gigantor News is that the Senate Intelligence Committee knows what's going on, they know
[13:13.600 --> 13:21.120]  it's man-made so that the globalists can tell how it would track, see just because it's
[13:21.120 --> 13:25.720]  man-made doesn't mean it's ultra deadly, it just means it's ultra communicable to scare
[13:25.720 --> 13:29.400]  you and they also know the effect it will have so you want to use a weapon that'll
[13:29.400 --> 13:34.880]  create a stampede like a gunshot but not too much that you can't control that will get
[13:34.880 --> 13:39.120]  out of control, this is about clamping down and getting control of people, it's not about
[13:39.120 --> 13:43.000]  being out of control, so getting ready is important, boasting your immune system is
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.160]  absolutely important because there are a lot of really bad pneumonia and stuff out there
[13:49.160 --> 13:54.920]  and flus, of course you want your zinc, of course you want your nano silver, of course
[13:54.920 --> 13:59.440]  you want to eat high quality foods, of course you want to drink plenty of purified water,
[13:59.440 --> 14:04.360]  in fact medical doctors on they say drink a ton of purified water and I'll tell you
[14:04.360 --> 14:10.200]  they're selling out of the Alexa Pure water filtration systems, Michigan ordered Pro Pure
[14:10.200 --> 14:14.080]  and other great companies have high rated filters, top rated filters we sell, they just
[14:14.080 --> 14:17.440]  told them shut down, you're not essential but the liquor stores are but the gun stores
[14:17.440 --> 14:26.000]  aren't, so today maybe the last day are you able to get Alexa Pure water filters at m4.com
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.320]  because they're selling out, I'm told a day or two, also Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill
[14:31.320 --> 14:35.400]  Plus, you know I say this all the time, it's true and it's embarrassing, we have a lot
[14:35.400 --> 14:39.440]  of great supplements, when I take them all, it's like I'm Superman, I have so much energy
[14:39.440 --> 14:45.320]  libido, stamina, clarity, my eyes work better, everything, then that's a lot of vitamins
[14:45.320 --> 14:48.720]  and minerals and things, I ended up forgetting, I hadn't been taking Real Red Pill Plus in
[14:48.720 --> 14:54.640]  six months, I was taking X2, taking X3, taking the turmeric, taking the bodies, having a great
[14:54.640 --> 15:01.160]  effect, man I started two weeks ago taking this again, my sleep is just been incredible
[15:01.160 --> 15:06.120]  we don't advertise it, I just know it's this, it's where you don't wake up any, you don't
[15:06.120 --> 15:10.920]  want to get out of bed, you feel so refreshed, I've been taking Real Red Pill without the
[15:10.920 --> 15:14.640]  stimulant and Real Red Pill Plus has the natural stimulant, vitamins, minerals, preglinone
[15:14.640 --> 15:19.760]  that boosts it all and my wife's like, what's going on, I already have a lot of stamina
[15:19.760 --> 15:23.920]  and a lot of energy, like an 18 year old, I'll just leave it at that, hell I got more
[15:23.920 --> 15:29.200]  stamina than I was 18 but she's like, what is going on, because preglinone's powerful,
[15:29.200 --> 15:32.520]  that's why we say this isn't for kids, for kids that want the zinc and all the rest out
[15:32.520 --> 15:37.720]  of the multivitamin mineral with amino acids, vitamin mineral fusion, that has a dose of
[15:37.720 --> 15:41.480]  the minerals and things that shouldn't be higher in kids, it has a child dose in there
[15:41.480 --> 15:44.240]  of a lot of things that you shouldn't have too much of, other things you can have more
[15:44.240 --> 15:48.160]  of, it's got an extra amount of, so that's there, infowarstore.com, we're about to sell

[18:01.720 --> 18:06.680]  The globalist and the enemy of the people, corporate media, have worked overtime like
[18:06.680 --> 18:12.920]  the devil to destroy all independent pro-America truth based media, and chief amongst their
[18:12.920 --> 18:16.920]  enemy has been in full wars, but thanks to you spreading the word, and thanks to you
[18:16.920 --> 18:21.320]  supporting in full wars, we are still on the air and have actually expanded in the face
[18:21.320 --> 18:25.880]  of their tyranny, it is now more critical than ever, that you take this opportunity to share
[18:25.880 --> 18:30.680]  band.video and info wars.com and the articles and reports that are so critical, because
[18:30.680 --> 18:35.440]  the world is waking up and needs this information now more than ever, from myself and the info

[18:41.920 --> 18:48.480]  we ever have before, and to defend basic freedom and justice and the American way of life.

[18:53.520 --> 18:58.880]  action and spread the word, God bless and good luck.
[18:58.880 --> 19:04.240]  For more than eight weeks, info wars has researched this deadly coronavirus and it is deadly,
[19:04.240 --> 19:08.280]  it targets those who already have pre-existing conditions, compromised immune systems and
[19:08.280 --> 19:13.800]  those over 70, particularly bad, it is deadly, but the globalists are hyping it as an economic
[19:13.800 --> 19:18.640]  and psychological warfare weapon to implement martial law and throw Trump out of office,
[19:18.640 --> 19:23.360]  but regardless, the mainstream media will not tell you about natural compounds that
[19:23.360 --> 19:26.840]  are known to be extremely antiviral like zinc.
[19:26.840 --> 19:31.880]  So I don't care where you get zinc for yourself, your parents, your grandparents, your children,

[20:17.200 --> 20:33.640]  It is now 100% certified and confirmed that the globalist built China, the modern communist
[20:33.640 --> 20:38.560]  system set it up to replace America, the CFR wrote countless articles about that, they
[20:38.560 --> 20:42.400]  bragged about it, everybody's aware of it, allowed them to buy up at least four of the
[20:42.400 --> 20:48.320]  big six Hollywood studios, allowed them to buy up our debt, set up one sided trade deals
[20:48.320 --> 20:54.200]  where all of our industry went over there, they make 80 plus percent of our pharmaceuticals,
[20:54.200 --> 20:57.640]  we've been positioned to be totally dependent on them.
[20:57.640 --> 21:02.280]  And so they stage this event, use it as a political crackdown over Taiwan and the mainland,
[21:02.280 --> 21:07.000]  welded people in their houses to these horrible things, shot people at checkpoints, had drones
[21:07.000 --> 21:12.840]  controlling them, but let five billion people flee Wuhan, travel here, spread the disease
[21:12.840 --> 21:18.400]  all over the world, and then China sets the precedent where oh look, communist China,
[21:18.400 --> 21:23.360]  which have always said the Maoist, tattletale, control freak model of the takeover they were
[21:23.360 --> 21:27.560]  planning here, they're telling you for years, the left's planning a Maoist takeover because
[21:27.560 --> 21:31.160]  that's what they teach at the universities, it's what the Antifa teaches, it's what Democrats
[21:31.160 --> 21:37.240]  talk about, it's really what they're doing, sounds crazy but it is.
[21:37.240 --> 21:43.480]  And now you see it, China did this, we've got to do this, but then China quietly reopens
[21:43.480 --> 21:49.240]  for business, the media stops covering China, and today the Wall Street Journal is saying
[21:49.240 --> 21:55.040]  Americans are fleeing to China to protect themselves from the virus, what?
[21:55.040 --> 21:59.560]  America's the epicenter of the UN says, America's bad, the hospitals are overwhelmed, you're
[21:59.560 --> 22:05.480]  all dead, the stock market's going down, run for the hills.
[22:05.480 --> 22:09.040]  Trump underreacted, we knew they were going to set him up, he needed to expose them up
[22:09.040 --> 22:15.320]  front, then he overreacted, the stock market plunged, then he pulled back, sanity started
[22:15.320 --> 22:22.560]  prevailing, the stock market started going straight back up.
[22:22.560 --> 22:30.320]  So Senator Josh Hawley and Senator Tom Cotton have both come out and said, the Chai comms
[22:30.320 --> 22:35.200]  lied about it, they incubated it, they launched it, now the leftist media is using it for
[22:35.200 --> 22:37.400]  control.
[22:37.400 --> 22:40.920]  Now the Democrats are saying the cities they control, the states they control, they're
[22:40.920 --> 22:45.480]  not opening until the middle of the election maybe.
[22:45.480 --> 22:49.320]  Some are saying through the election, got the headlines right here, Democrats call for
[22:49.320 --> 22:56.680]  lockdown to continue through election, then they're going to mail in their ballots, wink,
[22:56.680 --> 22:58.040]  wink.
[22:58.040 --> 23:01.720]  And they think the shutdown of the economy will be a total depression way before then,
[23:01.720 --> 23:07.400]  will drive Trump from office and what did all the Democrats say on CNN, MSNBC, HBO,
[23:07.400 --> 23:10.760]  we're going to crash the economy, we're going to bring down Trump, we're going to punish
[23:10.760 --> 23:11.760]  flyover country.
[23:11.760 --> 23:17.120]  Well guess what, flyover country is in New York, it's in California, it's people there
[23:17.120 --> 23:22.680]  that don't like this garbage, but it's definitely in the Midwest and the Southwest and the South
[23:22.680 --> 23:29.720]  and all over and people see the bureaucratic power grab for what it is.
[23:29.720 --> 23:35.720]  It's very dangerous and the forced inoculations they admit are coming next year and the surveillance
[23:35.720 --> 23:41.160]  of us, every time there's a new bug that kills anybody, it's going to be hysteria and fear.
[23:41.160 --> 23:44.560]  This is how they're trying to break our will.
[23:44.560 --> 23:48.040]  So Senator Hawley has laid it out, we're going to go to that in a moment, but first
[23:48.040 --> 23:51.240]  here's Trump last night talking about what's really behind this.
[23:51.240 --> 23:52.240]  Here it is.
[23:52.240 --> 23:54.240]  I would love to see Mr. President about it.
[23:54.240 --> 23:59.320]  Mr. President, you tweeted earlier linking the closing of the country to your election
[23:59.320 --> 24:01.520]  success in November.
[24:01.520 --> 24:04.120]  Is this Easter timeline based on your political interest?
[24:04.120 --> 24:06.000]  What do you mean by my election success?
[24:06.000 --> 24:07.000]  No.
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.440]  You're tweeted, you said that the media wants the country to remain closed to hurt you on
[24:10.440 --> 24:11.440]  the meeting.
[24:11.440 --> 24:14.480]  Yeah, no, the media would like to see me do poorly on the election.
[24:14.480 --> 24:15.480]  I think-
[24:15.480 --> 24:18.840]  All makers and economists on both sides of the aisle have said that reopening the country
[24:18.840 --> 24:20.920]  by Easter is not a good idea.
[24:20.920 --> 24:22.320]  What is that plan based on?
[24:22.320 --> 24:23.320]  Just so you understand.
[24:23.320 --> 24:24.320]  Are you ready?
[24:24.320 --> 24:27.920]  I think there are certain people that would like it not to open so quickly.
[24:27.920 --> 24:31.760]  I think there are certain people that would like it to do financially poorly because they
[24:31.760 --> 24:35.800]  think that would be very good as far as defeating me at the polls.
[24:35.800 --> 24:42.720]  And I don't know if that's so, but I do think it's so that there are people in your profession
[24:42.720 --> 24:44.320]  that would like that to happen.
[24:44.320 --> 24:51.960]  I think it's very clear that there are people in your profession that write fake news.
[24:51.960 --> 24:52.960]  You do.
[24:52.960 --> 24:53.960]  She does.
[24:53.960 --> 24:56.920]  There are people in your profession that write fake news.
[24:56.920 --> 25:01.400]  They would love to see me for whatever reason because we've done one hell of a job.
[25:01.400 --> 25:04.040]  Nobody's done the job that we've done.
[25:04.040 --> 25:08.480]  And it's lucky that you have this group here right now for this problem, or you wouldn't
[25:08.480 --> 25:10.000]  even have a country left.
[25:10.000 --> 25:17.160]  Obviously, what we've got to do is take what he just said and edit it in with Bill Maher
[25:17.160 --> 25:23.360]  and the Democrats on CNN, MSNBC, all the channels and just have him keep saying, there are a
[25:23.360 --> 25:24.360]  lot of people.
[25:24.360 --> 25:25.680]  There are a lot of people like to see us fail.
[25:25.680 --> 25:26.680]  Clip, clip, clip.
[25:26.680 --> 25:27.880]  A lot of people want to see us fail.
[25:27.880 --> 25:28.880]  Clip, clip, clip.
[25:28.880 --> 25:29.960]  A lot of people want to see us fail.
[25:29.960 --> 25:30.960]  Clip, clip, clip.
[25:30.960 --> 25:32.440]  And you are fake news.
[25:32.440 --> 25:33.440]  And it's so obvious.
[25:33.440 --> 25:37.560]  And if they got a total depression, there'll be mass death as Trump said two days ago.
[25:37.560 --> 25:40.000]  This is insane.
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.480]  But it's warfare.
[25:41.480 --> 25:43.520]  It's taking the country down.
[25:43.520 --> 25:47.560]  What are we going to do if they steal the election in 221 days?
[25:47.560 --> 25:49.800]  This country's going into civil war.
[25:49.800 --> 25:52.400]  And in four years, he'll be gone.
[25:52.400 --> 25:57.760]  Finally someone up there standing up to this scum that are openly rooting for bringing
[25:57.760 --> 25:58.760]  the country down.
[25:58.760 --> 25:59.840]  But you know what?
[25:59.840 --> 26:00.840]  We have people power.
[26:00.840 --> 26:01.960]  You have word of mouth.
[26:01.960 --> 26:05.720]  And if you spread the word about what you just saw live, and when we put out the video
[26:05.720 --> 26:10.080]  in like an hour of what Trump said last night with them saying they want to bring the country
[26:10.080 --> 26:16.080]  down and that they want to use coronavirus to do it, we've got their ass.
[26:16.080 --> 26:18.720]  These people are like super villains.
[26:18.720 --> 26:23.080]  Here's what Senator Josh Holley had to say about China last night.
[26:23.080 --> 26:26.480]  Oh, and also another clip we're going to get to.
[26:26.480 --> 26:29.760]  First of Senator Tom Cotton last night talking about China.
[26:29.760 --> 26:30.760]  We got to watch these clips.
[26:30.760 --> 26:31.760]  Here it is.
[26:31.760 --> 26:36.960]  How much of our capacity China has, whether it is prescription drugs or personal protective
[26:36.960 --> 26:40.200]  equipment and things like that, we've got to take it back quickly.
[26:40.200 --> 26:41.200]  Your answer.
[26:41.200 --> 26:47.840]  Yeah, thanks like antibiotics and ibuprofen and Advil are made in China for the most part.
[26:47.840 --> 26:51.040]  It's time to bring that manufacturing capacity back to the United States.
[26:51.040 --> 26:54.000]  Time to bring a lot more back to the United States from China.
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.880]  China unleashes plague on the world and there will be a reckoning when we're on the backside
[26:57.880 --> 26:58.880]  of it.
[26:58.880 --> 27:03.360]  Right, there's to be a law that medicine is strategic and that it all has to be made
[27:03.360 --> 27:04.360]  here.
[27:04.360 --> 27:05.360]  Other countries do that.
[27:05.360 --> 27:11.360]  Here's what the senator also had to say about China refusing to hand over evidence about
[27:11.360 --> 27:13.000]  the Wuhan Biolab.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.920]  Maria, here's what we do know.
[27:15.920 --> 27:19.560]  This virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market.
[27:19.560 --> 27:24.320]  Epidemiologists who are widely respected from China who have published or studied in the
[27:24.320 --> 27:29.760]  international journal The Lancet have demonstrated that several of the original cases did not
[27:29.760 --> 27:31.960]  have any contact with that food market.
[27:31.960 --> 27:35.600]  The virus went into that food market before it came out of that food market.
[27:35.600 --> 27:38.960]  So we don't know where it originated, but we do know that we have to get to the bottom
[27:38.960 --> 27:39.960]  of that.
[27:39.960 --> 27:45.320]  We also know that just a few miles away from that food market is China's only biosafety
[27:45.320 --> 27:50.320]  level four super laboratory that researches human infectious diseases.
[27:50.320 --> 27:56.960]  Now we don't have evidence that this disease originated there, but because of China's duplicity
[27:56.960 --> 28:01.200]  and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the
[28:01.200 --> 28:02.200]  evidence says.
[28:02.200 --> 28:06.560]  And China right now is not giving any evidence on that question.
[28:06.560 --> 28:10.480]  When we return, we're going to get to cotton the single biggest threat to both global
[28:10.480 --> 28:12.200]  and U.S. growth.
[28:12.200 --> 28:15.680]  This year is this virus and the hype surrounding it.
[28:15.680 --> 28:18.560]  So again, get prepared, boost your immune system.
[28:18.560 --> 28:19.560]  That's absolutely reasonable.
[28:19.560 --> 28:21.920]  You want to run off and live in a bunker, knock yourself out.
[28:21.920 --> 28:26.120]  But every year, the flu comes and kills more people in the U.S. that have died from this
[28:26.120 --> 28:27.120]  worldwide.
[28:27.120 --> 28:30.400]  35 to 37,000 last year died of the flu.
[28:30.400 --> 28:32.720]  They don't have the numbers yet this year.
[28:32.720 --> 28:36.640]  In the U.S. alone, 20,000 worldwide, they say have now died of this.
[28:36.640 --> 28:37.640]  I mean, look at this.
[28:37.640 --> 28:40.640]  But then they say, oh, the lockdown saved you.
[28:40.640 --> 28:42.640]  We're the saviors because we ordered the lockdown.
[28:42.640 --> 28:46.320]  And by the way, I told you it was coming, Harvard and others that run this criminal
[28:46.320 --> 28:49.840]  operation are announcing yearly lockdowns for every virus.
[28:49.840 --> 28:53.560]  They said they're going to just turn things on and off with flashing lights and apps.
[28:53.560 --> 28:58.400]  You'll just be totally controlled by the technology.
[28:58.400 --> 29:01.440]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[29:01.440 --> 29:06.760]  So do you know who's on your wireless network, whether it's a big company selling your data
[29:06.760 --> 29:07.760]  or a foreign hacker?

[30:00.160 --> 30:02.600]  We told you it was coming.
[30:02.600 --> 30:07.380]  We told you that use a virus to scare everyone into submission and set up martial law and
[30:07.380 --> 30:08.380]  quarantines and lockdowns.
[30:08.380 --> 30:09.380]  And now it's here.
[30:09.380 --> 30:11.840]  And I'm here to tell you the rest of the story.
[30:11.840 --> 30:12.840]  Three things we all need to do.
[30:12.840 --> 30:17.320]  Pray to God for justice and seek His face and repent.
[30:17.320 --> 30:20.840]  Get politically active and wake others up to understand this is the world government,
[30:20.840 --> 30:23.560]  the castle society it's all being announced.
[30:23.560 --> 30:28.840]  And get prepared yourselves and boost your immune systems and get high quality food.
[30:28.840 --> 30:32.080]  And we're able to ship storeable food again.

[33:01.680 --> 33:26.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, although as you suggest, I'm afraid that the coronavirus
[33:26.360 --> 33:32.080]  could actually be the single biggest threat to both global and U.S. growth in this year.
[33:32.080 --> 33:35.720]  Senator, I just want to go back to the comments from the Chinese ambassador to the United
[33:35.720 --> 33:37.220]  States.
[33:37.220 --> 33:41.040]  Over the weekend, he said it's very harmful, it's very dangerous to stir up suspicion rumors
[33:41.040 --> 33:44.440]  and spread them among the people for one thing, this creates panic.
[33:44.440 --> 33:48.480]  Another thing is that it will fan up racial discrimination, xenophobia and all these things
[33:48.480 --> 33:51.240]  that will really harm our joint efforts to combat the virus.
[33:51.240 --> 33:55.920]  Obviously, on the intelligence committee, you know more about what's happening.
[33:55.920 --> 33:58.920]  How firm are you in your concerns about this?
[33:58.920 --> 34:02.160]  So I have two responses to the Chinese ambassador.
[34:02.160 --> 34:07.560]  One the thing that really is harmful that really spreads fear is China lying about the origins
[34:07.560 --> 34:12.920]  of this disease and about the number of people who have it and excluding American and other
[34:12.920 --> 34:16.320]  western scientists from China to try to get to the bottom of it.
[34:16.320 --> 34:21.680]  Second, in terms of the claims of racism, the Chinese people are the first and the worst
[34:21.680 --> 34:24.420]  victims of the Chinese Communist Party.
[34:24.420 --> 34:28.880]  We should all hold them in our prayers and hope that we can get a vaccine because they
[34:28.880 --> 34:35.440]  are the people who are most harmed by the Chinese government's incompetence and duplicity.
[34:35.440 --> 34:38.680]  In FullWars.com, I'm Alex Jones.
[34:38.680 --> 34:39.680]  We are live.
[34:39.680 --> 34:43.720]  DrugsReport.com shot claim we have a drug siren.
[34:43.720 --> 34:48.440]  American deaths will top 80,000 in next four months.
[34:48.440 --> 34:49.440]  I think that's possible.
[34:49.440 --> 34:56.400]  It kills a lot of sick and old people and if 30-something thousand die of the flu every
[34:56.400 --> 34:58.240]  year, there you go.
[34:58.240 --> 35:03.720]  So it's not that there isn't a virus, it doesn't kill people.
[35:03.720 --> 35:06.040]  I think the number will be lower than that, but I think that's possible.
[35:06.040 --> 35:07.040]  Very possible.
[35:07.040 --> 35:08.560]  I think it's on the high end.
[35:08.560 --> 35:13.560]  In fact, the US death rate is lower than that of the other countries because we have a larger
[35:13.560 --> 35:18.160]  sampling pool because they're just testing those that show up sick at the hospital while
[35:18.160 --> 35:21.560]  you're already getting the people that are already worse off and almost all of them have
[35:21.560 --> 35:28.520]  pre-existing conditions and or very old.
[35:28.520 --> 35:32.680]  But we always have viruses, we always have death.
[35:32.680 --> 35:36.040]  They're trying to make it like, oh, we can't ever have another person jump off a diving
[35:36.040 --> 35:40.960]  board and get hurt, so since the 80s, all the diving boards are taken out and now if
[35:40.960 --> 35:46.560]  you go to a new condo or a new hotel, all the pools are three feet to two feet deep
[35:46.560 --> 35:51.360]  because now no one can get hurt, it's lawyers.
[35:51.360 --> 35:54.840]  And now they're getting rid of swings and they're getting rid of merry-go-rounds, they're
[35:54.840 --> 35:57.720]  getting rid of everything.
[35:57.720 --> 36:01.160]  And now companies are saying, we're staying shut anyways, if there's a chance one of our
[36:01.160 --> 36:06.880]  employees could get sick, we'll be liable, so stay in your house.
[36:06.880 --> 36:11.840]  That's the shot claim at DrugsReport.com.
[36:11.840 --> 36:18.880]  American deaths will top 80,000 in the next four months.
[36:18.880 --> 36:23.040]  French news agency COVID-19, the Chai-Kong virus could lead to more than 80,000 deaths
[36:23.040 --> 36:27.560]  in the U.S. and overwhelm hospital capacity nationwide as soon as early April, even if
[36:27.560 --> 36:32.080]  social distancing measures are expected new research showed today.
[36:32.080 --> 36:38.040]  The U.S. death toll of the pandemic has already passed 1,000 with 68,000 confirmed infections.
[36:38.040 --> 36:42.240]  So guys, let's do a 1,000 divided into 68,000.
[36:42.240 --> 36:48.440]  Give me the death rate on that please, 1,000 divided into 68,000.
[36:48.440 --> 36:53.680]  Forecasters at the Institute for Health, Metrics, and Evaluation at the University of Washington's
[36:53.680 --> 36:58.040]  School of Medicine analyze the latest COVID-19, of course they're fine about Bill Gates I
[36:58.040 --> 37:01.880]  should add, data at a local, national, international level.
[37:01.880 --> 37:05.840]  These include hospitalization and mortality rates as well as the patient data in terms
[37:05.840 --> 37:09.720]  of age, gender, and pre-existing health problems.
[37:09.720 --> 37:14.200]  Specifically they looked at the time lag between the first cases of the public, infections
[37:14.200 --> 37:16.400]  such as shuttering schools and businesses.
[37:16.400 --> 37:22.360]  Then they looked at each American state's ICU bed and ventilator capacity.
[37:22.360 --> 37:27.520]  The analysts warned that based on the current trends, demand for both would far exceed the
[37:27.520 --> 37:31.200]  COVID-19 patients as early as the second week of April.
[37:31.200 --> 37:37.360]  Many epidemic peak also set for a point in April, as many as 2,300 patients would die
[37:37.360 --> 37:41.400]  every day according to the IHME model.
[37:41.400 --> 37:45.080]  You know, I remember reading old history books and things about the old West and New York
[37:45.080 --> 37:50.920]  or anywhere and routinely you'd have some bad bug come through and you'd have half the
[37:50.920 --> 37:53.240]  old people that were 89 years old would die.
[37:53.240 --> 37:54.240]  That's just what happens.
[37:54.240 --> 37:55.240]  Let's see.
[37:55.240 --> 37:56.240]  Oh, it can't happen now.
[37:56.240 --> 37:57.240]  It can't be 1%.
[37:57.240 --> 37:58.240]  We have to lock down.
[37:58.240 --> 37:59.240]  We have to have a depression.
[37:59.240 --> 38:00.240]  We have to have microchips.
[38:00.240 --> 38:04.840]  We have to have vaccines, even though vaccines lower your immunity to other bugs.
[38:04.840 --> 38:05.840]  That's in all the studies.
[38:05.840 --> 38:09.680]  They might help you with one, maybe, but it lowers your immune system overall and America
[38:09.680 --> 38:13.800]  is so sick and so it eats so much GMOs on so many drugs.
[38:13.800 --> 38:15.240]  Maybe Mike Adams is true.
[38:15.240 --> 38:16.240]  Maybe he's right.
[38:16.240 --> 38:18.200]  Maybe hundreds of thousands are going to die.
[38:18.200 --> 38:20.720]  Maybe I've been too optimistic.
[38:20.720 --> 38:24.760]  All I know is they're using it to shut the economy down.
[38:24.760 --> 38:31.440]  They're using it to drive Trump from office and they're blaming everything on him during
[38:31.440 --> 38:36.400]  the epidemic peak, also set for some point in April, as many as 2,300 patients could
[38:36.400 --> 38:40.920]  die every day according to the IHME model.
[38:40.920 --> 38:44.480]  This was the case even in the population altered to a strict social distancing measures.
[38:44.480 --> 38:46.440]  Yeah, it's already spread everywhere, folks.
[38:46.440 --> 38:49.720]  I don't know if their number is right, but it's true.
[38:49.720 --> 38:51.560]  It's been here since November at least.
[38:51.560 --> 38:52.560]  That's from the CIA.
[38:52.560 --> 38:56.040]  And I don't just trust the CIA in general, but I mean, good people I know in it that
[38:56.040 --> 38:59.440]  have access, they know all about this.
[38:59.440 --> 39:05.400]  Our estimate trajectory of COVID-19 deaths assumed continued and uninterrupted vigilance
[39:05.400 --> 39:07.160]  by the general public.
[39:07.160 --> 39:14.160]  Hospital workers and government agencies said Christopher Murray, IHME director, the trajectory
[39:14.160 --> 39:18.960]  of the pandemic will change and dramatically for the worse if people ease up on social
[39:18.960 --> 39:22.920]  distancing or relax with other precautions.
[39:22.920 --> 39:26.160]  The analysts estimated that approximately 81,000 people in the U.S. will die from the
[39:26.160 --> 39:28.280]  virus over the coming four months.
[39:28.280 --> 39:32.720]  Estimates range between 38,000 and more than 160,000, so that's why they picked the mental
[39:32.720 --> 39:33.720]  number.
[39:33.720 --> 39:38.680]  If forecast that total, 41 U.S. states will need more ICU beds that are currently available
[39:38.680 --> 39:46.560]  and 12 states may need to increase their capacity to 50% or more to accommodate patient needs.
[39:46.560 --> 39:50.040]  Those articles up at DrugsReport.com is going to read it and look at the numbers for yourself.
[39:50.040 --> 39:56.000]  It's also being linked up on NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[39:56.000 --> 40:05.680]  Okay, getting back to the news here, UK downgrades COVID-19 no longer a high consequence infectious
[40:05.680 --> 40:06.680]  disease.
[40:06.680 --> 40:07.680]  That's what they said months ago.
[40:07.680 --> 40:10.200]  They still see it as that.
[40:10.200 --> 40:14.840]  They don't see it as a very high death rate, even up there with the flu.
[40:14.840 --> 40:17.040]  That's what they're seeing.
[40:17.040 --> 40:19.120]  No need for hard quarantine in Russia.
[40:19.120 --> 40:22.640]  Paul Joseph Watson writes, the World Health Organization official says there's no need
[40:22.640 --> 40:26.360]  for Russia to implement a hard quarantine to fight coronavirus.
[40:26.360 --> 40:29.760]  After Moscow closed most of its border back in January, something Democrats fought to
[40:29.760 --> 40:30.760]  stop here.
[40:30.760 --> 40:36.600]  The who's representative in Russia said the country was one step ahead of other countries
[40:36.600 --> 40:38.440]  in its battle against COVID-19.
[40:38.440 --> 40:44.040]  Oh, with borders and stopping flights in in January, something the Democrats and Joe Biden
[40:44.040 --> 40:47.240]  said don't do, but now it's all Trump's fault.
[40:47.240 --> 40:54.880]  They talk to us like we have no memories and like we're total, complete morons.
[40:54.880 --> 40:57.560]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[40:57.560 --> 41:03.880]  Meanwhile, well, let me come back.
[41:03.880 --> 41:08.160]  I'm going to blitz through a ton of news here just to show you the hysteria, but you knew
[41:08.160 --> 41:11.280]  what was coming, right?
[41:11.280 --> 41:14.000]  Gordon Brown is one of the people I cited in the crew.
[41:14.000 --> 41:15.000]  God bless them.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.960]  It's not their fault because they were raised most of our stuff online so we couldn't find
[41:17.960 --> 41:18.960]  it on YouTube.
[41:18.960 --> 41:21.960]  Gordon Brown, when he was back in power, I don't know what was it, eight years ago or
[41:21.960 --> 41:27.960]  whatever, the British Prime Minister, he kept saying, we need a real world order to control
[41:27.960 --> 41:28.960]  during pandemics.
[41:28.960 --> 41:34.360]  We need a world government, world government body to control a cashless society, ban cash
[41:34.360 --> 41:36.400]  because of the coming pandemics.
[41:36.400 --> 41:38.640]  Well, he's back saying it again.
[41:38.640 --> 41:44.800]  So we can't find where he said it eight, nine years ago, but he's saying it again.
[41:44.800 --> 41:47.520]  So we have it now.
[41:47.520 --> 41:50.080]  Former UK Prime Minister calls for global government.
[41:50.080 --> 41:52.480]  He said global government to fight coronavirus.
[41:52.480 --> 41:55.680]  We'll tell you about that and so much more.
[41:55.680 --> 42:02.080]  They've always said we're going to use global government for a global crisis.
[42:02.080 --> 42:04.160]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[42:04.160 --> 42:06.480]  They said they would use the bugs.
[42:06.480 --> 42:10.440]  I'm going to tell you this, the bug is real.
[42:10.440 --> 42:12.240]  There's always new bugs that kill a bunch of people.
[42:12.240 --> 42:17.000]  They've decided to make it a big deal and people die from it just like shootings.
[42:17.000 --> 42:24.360]  Still a rare, it's rare compared to car accidents or cancer or anything to die in a shooting.
[42:24.360 --> 42:25.360]  It's not common.
[42:25.360 --> 42:29.120]  It's really rare to die in a school shooting, but still young people, they humanize them,
[42:29.120 --> 42:34.360]  they show their faces, they zoom in on them, they tell you about them and then you show
[42:34.360 --> 42:38.640]  them their parents and they cry and you're touched with empathy, but less than a hundred
[42:38.640 --> 42:40.920]  die a year in real mass shootings, still too many.
[42:40.920 --> 42:44.920]  But you'd think they're everywhere and they spent billions walking schools down in total
[42:44.920 --> 42:47.440]  hysteria and fear blaming all gun owners.
[42:47.440 --> 42:53.360]  It's the same thing with this, but now you're going to have 20, 30, 40, I bet 80,000 people
[42:53.360 --> 42:58.240]  probably right because they're going to misdiagnose a lot of flu deaths with this as well.
[42:58.240 --> 43:05.480]  Every week, every day, every hour, every minute, every second right now is critical.
[43:05.480 --> 43:08.800]  History is happening right in front of us and we can't be spectators.
[43:08.800 --> 43:13.160]  We've got to be men and women in the arena regardless of race, color, creed, age, sexual
[43:13.160 --> 43:14.640]  privacy, it doesn't matter.
[43:14.640 --> 43:18.920]  The globalist with the chai comms and others are openly trying to plunge our economy and
[43:18.920 --> 43:20.400]  start a new depression.
[43:20.400 --> 43:24.520]  China who hyped up this virus is now back to work and ramping up their economy while
[43:24.520 --> 43:29.320]  ours is going into a free fall spiral and Trump's desperately trying to restart it and
[43:29.320 --> 43:34.320]  create confidence and the globalist corporate media that was worshiping China just a month
[43:34.320 --> 43:39.960]  or so ago and their response is saying Trump is terrible because they want America to fail,
[43:39.960 --> 43:44.240]  they want you to fail, but you can expose them, you can speak out, you can share the
[43:44.240 --> 43:49.000]  articles and videos and reports at InfoWars and Band-Aught Video that expose them and
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.160]  the globalist will go down.
[43:51.160 --> 43:55.200]  It's already blowing up in their face right now, so press the attack on the InfoWars and
[43:55.200 --> 43:57.320]  defeat the NWO.
[43:57.320 --> 44:06.480]  Listen, there's a show from PBS called It's Okay to Be Smart.
[44:06.480 --> 44:13.360]  So everyone who's been smart and has been put down for it and persecuted, it's okay
[44:13.360 --> 44:14.520]  to finally be smart.
[44:14.520 --> 44:20.240]  That's right, there's not two sexes and families are bad and the right thing to do is to sterilize
[44:20.240 --> 44:22.240]  your son so he doesn't become an evil warmonger.
[44:22.240 --> 44:25.920]  I mean, a lot of feminists are saying we should have the government pass laws that mail embryos
[44:25.920 --> 44:31.120]  account, but what's better and more reformed and more humanitarian is to convince them
[44:31.120 --> 44:35.320]  when they're five years old to have their testicles chopped off and again, global warming
[44:35.320 --> 44:36.320]  is real.
[44:36.320 --> 44:38.800]  We got to pay Lord Rothschild all of our money and the pandemic's all real.
[44:38.800 --> 44:40.480]  We've got to be locked up in our houses.
[44:40.480 --> 44:44.760]  We've got to use the language the universities say we're not a culture or anything.
[44:44.760 --> 44:46.560]  Oh, no, no, we're not.
[44:46.560 --> 44:47.560]  We're good people.
[44:47.560 --> 44:52.360]  We're good people that went to these corporate systems that didn't brainwash us.
[44:52.360 --> 44:59.120]  No, no, they enlightened us how to censor and how to rule and how to control.
[44:59.120 --> 45:04.480]  For more than eight weeks, Info Wars has researched this deadly coronavirus and it is deadly.
[45:04.480 --> 45:08.520]  It targets those who already have preexisting conditions, compromised immune systems and
[45:08.520 --> 45:10.920]  those over 70, particularly bad.
[45:10.920 --> 45:15.280]  It is deadly, but the globalists are hyping it as an economic and psychological warfare
[45:15.280 --> 45:18.880]  weapon to implement martial law and throw Trump out of office.
[45:18.880 --> 45:23.600]  But regardless, the mainstream media will not tell you about natural compounds that
[45:23.600 --> 45:27.080]  are known to be extremely antiviral like zinc.
[45:27.080 --> 45:32.120]  So I don't care where you get zinc for yourself, your parents, your grandparents, your children.
[45:32.120 --> 45:35.760]  Please go out and research zinc and then know that we have three different formulas that
[45:35.760 --> 45:41.840]  have zinc in them at a very nice dosage level, real red pill, real red pill plus and vitamin
[45:41.840 --> 45:42.840]  mineral fusion.
[45:42.840 --> 45:48.320]  And all of these products are 40 and 50% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com even though
[45:48.320 --> 45:50.560]  we're very, very close to selling them out.
[45:50.560 --> 45:59.640]  We ship within 24 hours, so secure yours today and boost your defense at InfoWarsStore.com.
[45:59.640 --> 46:04.560]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[46:04.560 --> 46:09.040]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all
[46:09.040 --> 46:14.080]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[46:14.080 --> 46:19.280]  That's why InfoWarsLife created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula, the new platinum

[46:52.640 --> 47:02.760]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion today, available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[47:02.760 --> 47:18.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:18.960 --> 47:23.800]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[47:23.800 --> 47:25.520]  You want to stop tyranny?
[47:25.520 --> 47:27.240]  Well so does he.
[47:27.240 --> 47:33.800]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting world-wide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:33.800 --> 47:39.000]  Well there's a big story for the French news agency up at InfoWars.com, can't miss it
[47:39.000 --> 47:47.400]  at Drougreport.com with the vaunted siren, U.S. virus deaths may top 80,000 despite
[47:47.400 --> 47:52.840]  Feynman study shows, it's one of these billable and against funded grips, but you know, you
[47:52.840 --> 47:56.360]  get 37,000 flu deaths and they're going to misdiagnose a lot of deaths.
[47:56.360 --> 48:02.200]  People can have both viruses on them, I think 80,000 is probably what we will see.
[48:02.200 --> 48:08.360]  And by the way, we did the math, they say a thousand people have died and that there
[48:08.360 --> 48:13.840]  are 68,000 confirmed infections.
[48:13.840 --> 48:23.960]  Do the math, that means a 1.5% death rate, but again, that's all coming out of the globalist.
[48:23.960 --> 48:29.080]  Another article up on NationalFile.com, it's also posted at InfoWars.com, President Trump
[48:29.080 --> 48:35.440]  versus Bill Gates on treatment, Fauci has a $100 million conflict running, a $100 million
[48:35.440 --> 48:43.760]  contract for Bill and Melinda Gates, of course, on vaccines, a vaccine for AIDS, HIV ladies
[48:43.760 --> 48:46.280]  and gentlemen, unbelievable.
[48:46.280 --> 48:50.720]  Okay, I want to hit the world government news, I want to give the number out and I want to
[48:50.720 --> 48:56.840]  just put 10 calls on the board, so others don't have to hold, and then we got David
[48:56.840 --> 48:58.080]  Eichbottom in the next hour.
[48:58.080 --> 49:04.560]  A toll free number to join us to give me your take on this whole situation, we'll give you
[49:04.560 --> 49:08.240]  that number here in just a moment.
[49:08.240 --> 49:16.360]  But first, I want to talk about something here for just a second that is really important,
[49:16.360 --> 49:20.760]  where you guys able to get that living defense piece I wanted into the computer so I can
[49:20.760 --> 49:21.760]  play that.
[49:21.760 --> 49:26.960]  We do have that guys, fantastic, because this is something I haven't talked enough about
[49:26.960 --> 49:32.160]  and I keep forgetting to talk about it and it's really something that's a sleeper product
[49:32.160 --> 49:36.640]  that we were really excited about when we launched four years ago, but sometimes I'm
[49:36.640 --> 49:43.160]  busy during a product launch and if I never launch it, I never really talk about it.
[49:43.160 --> 49:46.440]  This is another product that people actually get and are blown away by and that's almost
[49:46.440 --> 49:52.880]  100% reviews, but I never talk about it, so it never became a big seller.
[49:52.880 --> 49:58.800]  Callers began to call in though, about living defense last year and talking about what it
[49:58.800 --> 50:02.440]  did for them, so then more callers called in and in the space of two weeks, we probably
[50:02.440 --> 50:07.960]  had seven or eight callers that got through that said, listen, it changed my life.
[50:07.960 --> 50:14.960]  Now, because of the FDA and the way the system is, we can't tell you the experience we personally
[50:14.960 --> 50:19.560]  have or what these known compounds do, like black walnut and others.
[50:19.560 --> 50:25.680]  This is a very strong formula, but I was reminded that I took this four years ago when it first
[50:25.680 --> 50:29.480]  came out and it really helped me and I hadn't taken it in almost four years.
[50:29.480 --> 50:32.120]  I took it again, incredible.
[50:32.120 --> 50:33.480]  This is beyond probiotic.
[50:33.480 --> 50:34.480]  This is next level.
[50:34.480 --> 50:41.120]  Michael ZX knocks out yeast mold, Candida, this knocks out a whole other class of things.
[50:41.120 --> 50:43.640]  You need to experience living defense for yourself.
[50:43.640 --> 50:50.280]  It's back in stock, sold out for four plus months because to get organic or wild harvested
[50:50.280 --> 50:55.320]  ingredients and to have it then tested and to have it at the highest levels, it kept
[50:55.320 --> 51:00.680]  failing the test and we said, no, we're not going to lower our standards and we just waited
[51:00.680 --> 51:03.680]  until we finally got a good run of it.
[51:03.680 --> 51:08.440]  We go with the highest standards, folks, because we're targets, plus that's what we deserve.
[51:08.440 --> 51:09.720]  You need to learn about living defense.
[51:09.720 --> 51:11.600]  You need to get a bottle of living defense.
[51:11.600 --> 51:15.560]  Despite the fact that it's sold out for all those months, it's discounted 40% off and
[51:15.560 --> 51:20.040]  I'm going to probably end that special soon because I thought we'd have enough to last
[51:20.040 --> 51:21.200]  a few months.
[51:21.200 --> 51:24.440]  It's going to sell out in about two weeks at current sales rates because people know
[51:24.440 --> 51:29.080]  about the gut being the big front line of defense for immunity and for health.
[51:29.080 --> 51:34.440]  And if your gut isn't in order, you're screwed because your body's going to spend all its
[51:34.440 --> 51:39.200]  time fighting stuff there in the gut instead of fighting it in the nose and the sinus and
[51:39.200 --> 51:43.600]  the throat and the mouth and other areas of the body and the skin and the eyes.
[51:43.600 --> 51:46.640]  So get your gut in order and it's incredible.
[51:46.640 --> 51:47.640]  Michael ZX is amazing.
[51:47.640 --> 51:51.000]  Goes great with it, but get your living defense back in stock.
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.120]  Here's what one caller had to say about it.
[51:53.120 --> 51:55.280]  Hey, Steve, how you doing?
[51:55.280 --> 51:56.280]  Hey, Alex.
[51:56.280 --> 52:00.480]  Oh my God, longtime listener, first-time caller.
[52:00.480 --> 52:05.960]  Alex, I got to tell you, man, I don't care what anybody has ever said about you.
[52:05.960 --> 52:12.520]  You have read more human beings than anybody on planet Earth and God bless you.
[52:12.520 --> 52:16.840]  Everything you stand for, everything you've done, you are the best, man.
[52:16.840 --> 52:21.680]  I mean, it's absolutely true that when I heard you today with this live call and you
[52:21.680 --> 52:24.080]  encouraged people to call in, I said, that's it, man.
[52:24.080 --> 52:25.080]  I'm just going to break down.
[52:25.080 --> 52:30.040]  I got to say, look, in January, 2016, I went in the hospital, I went in the VA hospital
[52:30.040 --> 52:32.640]  out here in Boise and I was in there until June.
[52:32.640 --> 52:38.480]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to Info Wars every
[52:38.480 --> 52:40.600]  day for three hours a day.
[52:40.600 --> 52:44.320]  And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[52:44.320 --> 52:45.440]  Let me tell you something, man.
[52:45.440 --> 52:50.840]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years
[52:50.840 --> 52:55.000]  and the doctors, they tried every test, nobody could figure out what it is.
[52:55.000 --> 52:58.560]  And every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you
[52:58.560 --> 52:59.560]  know what?
[52:59.560 --> 53:01.560]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[53:01.560 --> 53:05.080]  Now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have a stuff.
[53:05.080 --> 53:06.760]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[53:06.760 --> 53:07.760]  I got it.
[53:07.760 --> 53:08.760]  I hid it from the nurses.
[53:08.760 --> 53:10.880]  I started taking it, man.
[53:10.880 --> 53:12.440]  That stuff changed my life.
[53:12.440 --> 53:13.600]  It saved my life.
[53:13.600 --> 53:16.560]  Alex Jones and Info Wars saved my life.
[53:16.560 --> 53:20.640]  Listen, man, if there's any veteran out there, I don't give you travel though.
[53:20.640 --> 53:22.320]  Anybody's traveled overseas.
[53:22.320 --> 53:26.840]  You absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense.
[53:26.840 --> 53:31.480]  Alex, I'm telling you, every listener out there should order a couple bottles of this
[53:31.480 --> 53:34.040]  because everybody's got parasites.
[53:34.040 --> 53:38.560]  Whether you think you don't or not, if you've ever eaten any kind of seafood, anything like
[53:38.560 --> 53:40.040]  that, obviously you do.
[53:40.040 --> 53:41.840]  Sushi, forget about it.
[53:41.840 --> 53:45.160]  You're riddled with parasites and I don't know of a better product.
[53:45.160 --> 53:49.520]  And I've done a lot of research since I had this miraculous turnaround in my health.
[53:49.520 --> 53:54.520]  I started looking into it and there's no better product out there.
[53:54.520 --> 53:59.680]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's back in stock.
[53:59.680 --> 54:00.760]  Get it while you can.
[54:00.760 --> 54:03.200]  More doesn't come in for two months.
[54:03.200 --> 54:08.720]  And right now it's one of our best sellers and it's fun in the operation, but it's amazing.
[54:08.720 --> 54:09.720]  Get your living defense, infowarstore.com.
[54:09.720 --> 54:12.720]  And I'm going to bring it back to 20% off.
[54:12.720 --> 54:15.040]  So the 40% off is we need funding.
[54:15.040 --> 54:16.040]  We don't put a lot of markups.
[54:16.040 --> 54:18.040]  So 30% off, we're making like 20, 30%.
[54:18.040 --> 54:22.840]  So I'm going to go back to close to full price here very, very soon as it's very, very expensive
[54:22.840 --> 54:23.960]  to make this.
[54:23.960 --> 54:24.960]  It doesn't have fillers.
[54:24.960 --> 54:29.800]  It's chock full of the highest quality products that have not been homogenized.
[54:29.800 --> 54:35.040]  See, if you buy products that have been heated and irradiated, you can get them really cheap
[54:35.040 --> 54:37.200]  and they're crappy and they might be 10 years old.
[54:37.200 --> 54:42.080]  We get fresh, organic and wild crafted wild pick.
[54:42.080 --> 54:44.000]  That's the level above that.
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.600]  And to be able to do that, it takes time.
[54:46.600 --> 54:48.680]  I could turn this out, never be out of it.
[54:48.680 --> 54:51.720]  But we have high standards because we want it to really work.
[54:51.720 --> 54:53.320]  We want you to get blown away by it.
[54:53.320 --> 54:55.880]  Okay, I'm going to stop there.
[54:55.880 --> 55:00.880]  I was just reminded of something, not just the numbers of deaths in Italy, 70,000 two
[55:00.880 --> 55:05.280]  years ago, usually about 35,000 to 40,000, even though they're only 60 million and how
[55:05.280 --> 55:09.000]  that's why it's hit their population so bad and how they're going to try to use flu deaths
[55:09.000 --> 55:15.280]  to say it's coronavirus this year in the flu season to scare everybody.
[55:15.280 --> 55:19.400]  And you've got these mill gates connected groups coming out and seeing 80,000 and they
[55:19.400 --> 55:22.400]  are going to die in the next four months.
[55:22.400 --> 55:29.880]  We just got bombshell information that I'm going to cover six after next hour.
[55:29.880 --> 55:35.840]  But I do want to give the number out and I do want to take your phone calls 877-789
[55:35.840 --> 55:47.080]  Alex 877-789-2539, all your country code access 512-646-1776, 877-789-2539.
[55:47.080 --> 55:52.720]  First-time callers, I'm going to take 10 calls in the first 30 minutes.
[55:52.720 --> 55:57.680]  And then David Eich's going to join us with his amazing take on the whole coronavirus
[55:57.680 --> 56:00.280]  and hysteria and everything that is unfolding.
[56:00.280 --> 56:01.280]  That is coming up.
[56:01.280 --> 56:05.080]  He'll be with us for an hour and a half and then I'll open the phones up again, fourth
[56:05.080 --> 56:06.080]  hour.
[56:06.080 --> 56:10.120]  I'm hosting the whole fourth hour and taking your calls.
[56:10.120 --> 56:14.120]  Infowars.com is the front line of the fight against the globalist.
[56:14.120 --> 56:16.320]  Now let me read you some of these headlines.
[56:16.320 --> 56:19.680]  Former UK Prime Minister calls for global government to fight coronavirus.
[56:19.680 --> 56:21.480]  Yeah, he did years ago too.
[56:21.480 --> 56:23.240]  It's their plan.
[56:23.240 --> 56:28.000]  Virus death toll passes 20,000, 3 billion under lockdown for something that's killed
[56:28.000 --> 56:32.600]  20,000 worldwide.
[56:32.600 --> 56:36.840]  US patients charged with attempted murder for failing to self-isolate.
[56:36.840 --> 56:39.520]  Man, talk about tyranny.
[56:39.520 --> 56:43.320]  The US just had its deadliest day from a coronavirus, but health officials say the
[56:43.320 --> 56:44.600]  peak is yet to come.
[56:44.600 --> 56:47.840]  They just think we're such domesticated idiots.
[56:47.840 --> 56:49.440]  The West can't contain the coronavirus.
[56:49.440 --> 56:50.720]  Should you shelter in China?
[56:50.720 --> 56:51.720]  Wall Street Journal.
[56:51.720 --> 56:52.720]  Run to China.
[56:52.720 --> 56:57.200]  See how they scripted all like they're the good guys.
[56:57.200 --> 57:01.280]  Those who intentionally sprinkled motorized could be charged as terrorists.
[57:01.280 --> 57:04.680]  For fear-mongering, ICU doctor coronavirus frightens me.
[57:04.680 --> 57:08.440]  It's severe, unpredictable, and it has no cure.
[57:08.440 --> 57:10.120]  Usually doctors don't try to scare you.

[1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:48.640]  Sweet sweet candy.
[1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:52.640]  That's the natural facts.

[1:01:00.640 --> 1:01:04.640]  Keep me right.
[1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:06.640]  We're an American band.
[1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:09.640]  We don't lock down when some people are dying from a virus.
[1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:11.640]  We don't bow to the globalists.
[1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:13.640]  They don't submit to their charity.
[1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:14.640]  We never have.
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:16.640]  We never will.
[1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:24.640]  All these attempts to straightjacket us will only ignite the awakening.
[1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:29.640]  Boy, young Chiquitas at Omaha.

[1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:41.640]  Let's get to your calls.
[1:01:41.640 --> 1:01:42.640]  Alan.
[1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:43.640]  They had a plan.
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:44.640]  You're on the air.
[1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:45.640]  Alan, welcome.
[1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:46.640]  That's okay.
[1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:47.640]  Welcome.
[1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:48.640]  Thanks for calling.
[1:01:48.640 --> 1:02:07.640]  Yesterday, I saw this video and it's with the Chinese researcher from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:17.640]  And if you watch it, she's talking about at the end of the video how she went into the deep cave on the corners of the earth to get the bath and the dropping.
[1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:18.640]  And they brought it back.
[1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:20.640]  And you can see all this in the video.
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:25.640]  But then at the end, she mentioned, and I'm going to read to you what she mentioned here.
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:29.640]  She's going to, we need to get away from our farms.
[1:02:29.640 --> 1:02:31.640]  I get her right here.
[1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:32.640]  Okay.
[1:02:32.640 --> 1:02:36.640]  So she says, so if we want to prevent new infections from the source, it's actually quite simple.
[1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:37.640]  Stay away from it.
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:45.640]  That's why we recommend that we put an end to wild animal consumption, reduce wildlife exposure, reduce wildlife habitat infestation.
[1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:51.640]  We also need to stay away from wild humans and our domesticated animals, animals like our farm.
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:52.640]  Try to avoid.
[1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:57.640]  Yeah, I'm sure just some person on the internet says this came from a farm.
[1:02:57.640 --> 1:02:58.640]  The virus has been scanned.
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:02.640]  It's a bio weapon that's been engineered.
[1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:06.640]  Well, this is the Chinese virologist and researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:12.640]  Well, of course the Wuhan Institute that's a bio weapon lab is trying to cover up that it cooked it up.
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:19.640]  Yeah, well, what I'm saying is they're trying to use also the Corona virus to say, hey, you need you're going to have to stay away from cow.
[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:26.640]  Oh, you're absolutely right that the that the extinction rebellion and the globalist are all saying that it's all humans fault.
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:27.640]  We have to stop eating meat.
[1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:29.640]  You're dead on brother.
[1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:30.640]  Yeah, and that's what I'm saying.
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:39.640]  So they're going to use to try to ban citizens to be able to have the ability to raise our own meat to grow on rabbits, whatever it may be in our backyard.
[1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:43.640]  I mean, I love her quote because that's what the Chinese call the villagers as wild people.
[1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:45.640]  We may not allow wild people.
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:47.640]  You must come to the slave grid.
[1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:49.640]  We take care of you with fentanyl.
[1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:53.640]  What do you see all this going brother?
[1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:55.640]  I see it's going to global government.
[1:03:55.640 --> 1:04:03.640]  As the Bible says, you know, they're going to assure in the market of the beast and they're going to tell everyone, hey, if you want to buy or sell, if you want to eat something, you got to take the market of the beast.
[1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:05.640]  And I got to say one thing.
[1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:11.640]  I'm not sure if you know, in China, the number 666 has become mainstream.
[1:04:11.640 --> 1:04:13.640]  They see it as good luck.
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:16.640]  Look it up.
[1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:17.640]  Amazing.
[1:04:17.640 --> 1:04:18.640]  Sir, God bless you.
[1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:19.640]  I appreciate your call.
[1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:21.640]  All right, more calls straight ahead than David.
[1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:23.640]  Bottom of the hour, I'm going to get to everybody.
[1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:26.640]  Jake, Christian, Brandon, Mark, Josh, and others before he joins us.
[1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:31.640]  But I've got, I always have big news, but this is really big news that nobody else has pointed out.
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:37.640]  When we return on the other side of the 62nd break, whatever you do, it's beyond critical.
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:38.640]  It is the essence of victory.
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:41.640]  It is the blood of annihilating the globalist.
[1:04:41.640 --> 1:04:42.640]  And that is your word of mouth.
[1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:43.640]  It is paramount.
[1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:44.640]  That is the coin of the realm.
[1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:46.640]  That is the spirit of liberty.
[1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:48.640]  Spread the word, my Paul Revere.
[1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:49.640]  Spread the word.
[1:04:49.640 --> 1:04:51.640]  Band.video.infowars.com.
[1:04:51.640 --> 1:05:01.640]  We've known for over a decade that big tech is totally anti-American.
[1:05:01.640 --> 1:05:07.640]  It wants to bring in a one world government currency, a Chinese communist social score to control every facet of our lives.
[1:05:07.640 --> 1:05:08.640]  But now it's here.
[1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:14.640]  They are using this coronavirus lockdown to tell all these shops and stores do not accept cash.
[1:05:14.640 --> 1:05:20.640]  And now they're announcing all over the country they're going to stop accepting cash and only certain businesses can stay open.
[1:05:20.640 --> 1:05:24.640]  Well, what do you do next to put the final nail on the coffin and launch the Mark of the Beast?
[1:05:24.640 --> 1:05:29.640]  House stimulus bill envisions digital dollar to ease coronavirus recession.
[1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:32.640]  Only stores that are allowed to be open can accept it.
[1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:37.640]  Evil patriots and people, of course, can't use it and attracts everything you do.
[1:05:37.640 --> 1:05:38.640]  So there it is, folks.
[1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:44.640]  Mark of the Beast, global digital currency, all being rolled out in this hysteria.
[1:05:44.640 --> 1:05:51.640]  And a lot of people are buying into it, so you've just green lit the globalist absolutely taking control of your lives.
[1:05:51.640 --> 1:05:54.640]  But info wars predicted it all from the very start.
[1:05:54.640 --> 1:06:16.640]  For tomorrow's news today.
[1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:29.640]  Well, the drug siren is burning bright.
[1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:34.640]  It's being reported by a major institute in Washington state.
[1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:45.640]  Shot claim America death toll will top 80,000, 81,000 in the next four months.
[1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:58.640]  They said there's been a thousand deaths out of 60 plus thousand, 68,000 confirmed infections of the Chinese Communist engineered Wuhan virus.
[1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:01.640]  And that is from the French news agency right here.
[1:07:01.640 --> 1:07:03.640]  You can see in the overhead shot.
[1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:08.640]  But look at this headline from the Chicago Tribune.
[1:07:08.640 --> 1:07:12.640]  And I went and followed the link to the CDC.
[1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:24.640]  The CDC reported in 2018 winter season, the highest death toll in 40 years in the US from the flu, normally 35,000 deaths on average.
[1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:27.640]  37,000 last year.
[1:07:27.640 --> 1:07:33.640]  80,000 deaths from the flu.
[1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:43.640]  The same number they're saying the Wuhan Chinese Communist virus is going to kill a estimator.
[1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:47.640]  So did we lock everything down and have a great depression over that?
[1:07:47.640 --> 1:07:50.640]  And of course, the most people that died were old and previously conditions.
[1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:54.640]  They just put flu because they test positive for the flu on the death certificate.
[1:07:54.640 --> 1:07:57.640]  Most had kidney failure, liver failure, cancer.
[1:07:57.640 --> 1:07:58.640]  And it's sad they died.
[1:07:58.640 --> 1:08:00.640]  That's what happens when you get old.
[1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:04.640]  My sweet grandmother at 92 died of pneumonia.
[1:08:04.640 --> 1:08:12.640]  She beat it the year before, lost a lot of her weight, a lot of concentration, can't victim, gained some of the weight back, fought through it.
[1:08:12.640 --> 1:08:20.640]  By the end, she could like see angels and was talking to God and see her, you know, my dead grandfather and she was ready to go.
[1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:21.640]  But here you go.
[1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:24.640]  Now we're told it's permanent.
[1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:29.640]  And we can't ever leave our houses until they say we can't.
[1:08:29.640 --> 1:08:31.640]  18 months through the election.
[1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:39.640]  And then if Trump tries to open things up, he's a bad guy in the Democrat cities and counties and states that are run by them saying they're not opening up through the election.
[1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:40.640]  And it's all Trump's fault.
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:46.640]  But they also said months ago they hope the virus hurts Trump and hurts the economy to drive him from office.
[1:08:46.640 --> 1:08:53.640]  Well, Trump's got to run TV ads showing Bill Maher and CNN and MSNBC hosts all saying we hope to have a depression.
[1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:55.640]  We hope this virus drives Trump from office.
[1:08:55.640 --> 1:09:04.640]  While they demanded to have open borders, imagine TV ad that starts with Joe Biden saying it's xenophobic to try to block flights from China.
[1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:06.640]  Donald Trump should leave the flights from China open.
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:08.640]  That was in February.
[1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:11.640]  Then it cuts to Bill Maher going, a depression is worth it.
[1:09:11.640 --> 1:09:12.640]  Let's do it.
[1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:14.640]  I hope this virus hurts Trump.
[1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:18.640]  And then CNN clip, MSNBC clip.
[1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:31.640]  Guest on Fox saying, and then the reporters sitting there confronting Trump blaming him and Trump going, I think the media wants to bring down the economy and hurt the American people so I don't get reelected.
[1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:33.640]  And then saying, how dare you say that?
[1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:39.640]  That's a one minute ad that will burn them down.
[1:09:39.640 --> 1:09:44.640]  They hope we don't remember them just a month ago, all over CNN, all over MSNBC.
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:53.640]  We were playing clips every day of them just giggling and laughing and snickering.
[1:09:53.640 --> 1:09:57.640]  And we're going to put together a video.
[1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:10.640]  We'll try to do it like two minutes so we can go on Twitter of Trump talking about it last night and how they're trying to bring down the economy to bring him down and bring down the American people to teach us a lesson and then them denying it and then cutting to all of them saying it.
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:12.640]  I have you now.
[1:10:12.640 --> 1:10:17.640]  All Trump has to do is get on the attack on this and point out that Russia is open for business.
[1:10:17.640 --> 1:10:18.640]  China is open for business.
[1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:22.640]  The UK now says the virus isn't a big problem.
[1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:25.640]  And then show them saying we're never going to open again.
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:26.640]  And it's done.
[1:10:26.640 --> 1:10:28.640]  Everyone will know what they're doing.
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:32.640]  And the hoax of the hype they're pushing will go down.
[1:10:32.640 --> 1:10:34.640]  But I'm going to read this to you again and go to your calls.
[1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:42.640]  80,000 people died of flu last winter in the US, the highest death rate in four decades, Chicago Tribune, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:48.640]  Dr. Robert Redfield, you see him all the news, revealed that the total in an interview Tuesday night with the Associated Press.
[1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:50.640]  Let's find that interview, guys.
[1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:57.640]  Flu experts knew it was a very bad season, but at least one found the size of the estimate surprising.
[1:10:57.640 --> 1:11:02.640]  That's huge, said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccine expert.
[1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:05.640]  The tally was nearly twice as much as that.
[1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:09.640]  Funny, you take all these vaccines that lowers your immunity the next year to the real flu.
[1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:10.640]  Type it in.
[1:11:10.640 --> 1:11:14.640]  Flu shot this year doubles your chances of getting it next year.
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:20.640]  Major University studies, Canada, the UK, the US, but that's another subject, isn't it?
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:23.640]  So they're saying 80,000 people died.
[1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:25.640]  How many of those will be flu and COVID?
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:30.640]  You can have both at the same time, or at least have the virus present, or have the antibodies.
[1:11:30.640 --> 1:11:33.640]  So when you hear this, just remember, it's an estimate 80,000 died.
[1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:36.640]  It's an estimate this time they don't know.
[1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:42.640]  They just make it up, but this time they're telling you can never be allowed again for anybody to die.
[1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:46.640]  Everything's got to be shut down to kill the economy.
[1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:47.640]  Unbelievable.
[1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:54.640]  So CDC reports more people died in 2018 from the flu that will die of COVID-19 in the US.
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:55.640]  Wow.
[1:11:55.640 --> 1:12:01.640]  That is a siren for Drudge, and maybe if we write an article about that, and maybe we put the links and show it,
[1:12:01.640 --> 1:12:05.640]  and maybe if we put this video up, maybe Drudge will link to it.
[1:12:05.640 --> 1:12:09.640]  Maybe you'll share it, but you just saw the facts right there.
[1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:11.640]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls.
[1:12:11.640 --> 1:12:15.640]  David Ike's coming up in 15 minutes, or 18 minutes.
[1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:18.640]  Let's go ahead and talk to drumroll please.
[1:12:18.640 --> 1:12:22.640]  Brandon in Colorado, you're on the air worldwide.
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:26.640]  Alex Jones, it's a pleasure, man. I've been listening to you for a long time.
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:28.640]  We'll go back to coast to coast.
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:30.640]  I wanted to call, man.
[1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:35.640]  I remember the day you guys started talking about the coronavirus, the worst hours were going.
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:36.640]  I got chills.
[1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:40.640]  You guys were ahead of it before any news, anything like that.
[1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:43.640]  So I wanted to say thank you because that day, man, I panicked.
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:44.640]  I got a bunch of stuff.
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:45.640]  I was ready for a long time.
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:48.640]  I started giving coworkers math, and everybody thought I was a little nutty.
[1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:52.640]  You know, a little crazy, but right now, you know, they're all saying I was right.
[1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:56.640]  And they're kind of grateful, but dark times, man, I got a two year old daughter.
[1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:01.640]  I'm a little worried, but truly like I just don't want another depression.
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:02.640]  I don't want none of that, man.
[1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:03.640]  I don't think anybody does.
[1:13:03.640 --> 1:13:06.640]  I just want us to get through all this and say, thanks.
[1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:07.640]  We got to spread these links.
[1:13:07.640 --> 1:13:09.640]  We got to wake the world up because these dark times.
[1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:11.640]  Exactly. Let me put you this way.
[1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:12.640]  Some people, there's a paradox.
[1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:13.640]  They get confused.
[1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:17.640]  They go, you were ahead of the curve with all these expert guests who've been dead on like Mike Adams
[1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:20.640]  and like Francis Boyle and so many others.
[1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:23.640]  But then you're saying it's a hoax, the response.
[1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:27.640]  What they're using it for is the hoax and is the lie.
[1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:34.640]  When Hitler firebombed on February 27th, 1933, his own capital building when he was the president,
[1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:35.640]  but not the chancellor.
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:37.640]  He was in the under house.
[1:13:37.640 --> 1:13:39.640]  He then became a dictator.
[1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:44.640]  The head of Germany von Hindenburg stepped down for him.
[1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:51.640]  The Reichstag really got firebombed, but the hoax was that the Nazis did it and not the communists
[1:13:51.640 --> 1:13:53.640]  and they use it to storm power.
[1:13:53.640 --> 1:13:56.640]  So a big dark winter was coming on the Nazis.
[1:13:56.640 --> 1:13:59.640]  Just because it was a hoax who did it didn't mean it wasn't serious.
[1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:00.640]  The virus is real.
[1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:04.640]  It's just being overhyped to lock down civilization to collapse the economy,
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:06.640]  which is an even bigger threat.
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:08.640]  So you get where I'm coming from?
[1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:10.640]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:12.640]  I mean, people got to wake up.
[1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:15.640]  You have to realize, like, you know, it's a plate of hand, man.
[1:14:15.640 --> 1:14:17.640]  You have to see that.
[1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:24.640]  Well, our forebears had World War II and, you know, we had the World War I and the Spanish flu killed 40 to 50 million people.
[1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:26.640]  And it's just, you know, you don't get out of this world alive.
[1:14:26.640 --> 1:14:28.640]  That's why you better boost your immune system.
[1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:30.640]  Where do you see all this going, Brandon?
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:32.640]  You know, I believe in our president.
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:35.640]  I believe that, you know, people like us, we're going to keep going, man.
[1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:39.640]  When the world can't stop because people are telling us, hey, you know, you might die.
[1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:40.640]  You've got to be afraid to go outside.
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:42.640]  You can't live in fear.
[1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:44.640]  I totally agree with you.
[1:14:44.640 --> 1:14:49.640]  And look, most people that are young and healthy survive this, but it does end up scarring your lungs.
[1:14:49.640 --> 1:14:50.640]  So you don't want it.
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:56.640]  The thing is, they admit if you cut the bell off now, it might just go even longer and then go into next year.
[1:14:56.640 --> 1:14:58.640]  A lot of times the quicker they come, the quicker they burn out.
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:00.640]  Urologists will tell you for whatever reason.
[1:15:00.640 --> 1:15:02.640]  But now they're saying it's a yearly thing.
[1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:03.640]  It'll be like the flu.
[1:15:03.640 --> 1:15:04.640]  It's always with us.
[1:15:04.640 --> 1:15:05.640]  It's another vaccine.
[1:15:05.640 --> 1:15:10.640]  I mean, they're just totally pushing forced inoculations to travel.
[1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:13.640]  Oh, it was here before they even, you know, before they closed the borders.
[1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:14.640]  It was already here.
[1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:15.640]  My family was sick.
[1:15:15.640 --> 1:15:16.640]  That was sick as they have been.
[1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:18.640]  I'm sure you even said you were sick, too.
[1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:21.640]  I mean, I hadn't been sick in almost five years.
[1:15:21.640 --> 1:15:25.640]  And then I got a fever and coughed for about a week.
[1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:29.640]  And then the fever came back and that's when, you know, it's COVID usually because it does.
[1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:31.640]  It's not nasty stuff.
[1:15:31.640 --> 1:15:34.640]  Don't get me wrong because I mean, I'm already getting sick and I got sick.
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:35.640]  All right.
[1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:36.640]  God bless you, sir.
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:37.640]  I really appreciate you.
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:38.640]  Again, it's real.
[1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:39.640]  It does have a threat.
[1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:40.640]  Those saying it doesn't exist.
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:41.640]  I disagree with them.
[1:15:41.640 --> 1:15:43.640]  It doesn't matter.
[1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:48.640]  It's the hyping is the weapon so you can't go along with the fear because that's what
[1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:49.640]  they want.
[1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:53.640]  You've got to spread the word about them trying to crash the economy and what scum the deep
[1:15:53.640 --> 1:15:55.640]  state is.
[1:15:55.640 --> 1:15:59.640]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:01.640]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:03.640]  I had a problem like you once.
[1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:09.640]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:10.640]  my life.
[1:16:10.640 --> 1:16:15.640]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:20.640]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[1:16:20.640 --> 1:16:23.640]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:28.640]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:30.640]  and totally change your life.
[1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:35.640]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:39.640]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[1:16:39.640 --> 1:16:40.640]  Get clean.
[1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:42.640]  Call now and learn more.

[1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:03.640]  I buy some.
[1:17:03.640 --> 1:17:04.640]  I use some.

[1:18:21.640 --> 1:18:27.640]  Hasn't lifted a finger while they're actually trying to tie him down in a straight jacket of lies.
[1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:29.640]  It is next level.
[1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:33.640]  I never thought they would go this far and be this criminal publicly.
[1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:35.640]  Yes, they hope the virus would plunge the economy.
[1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:37.640]  Yes, they hyped it all up.
[1:18:37.640 --> 1:18:39.640]  Yes, they're rooting against America.
[1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:50.640]  But now this, these people have gone completely insane and the American people need to let them know legally and lawfully that we see through them and we're not going to put up with their terrorism against America.
[1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:56.640]  As for M4 Wars, we're fighting on harder than ever thanks to you and we are winning.
[1:18:56.640 --> 1:19:05.640]  I made four police state films more than a decade ago, specifically warning of the plan to suspend habeas corpus.
[1:19:05.640 --> 1:19:08.640]  The right to even have access to a court.
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:12.640]  The right to not be secretly arrested and secretly disappeared.
[1:19:12.640 --> 1:19:16.640]  And I warned the Patriot Act that claimed was for terrorists, was really for the American people.
[1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:18.640]  Well, now they admitted it is.
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:29.640]  And bipartisanally, the Justice Department is now openly seeking to arrest and disappear Americans whenever they want under the guise of coronavirus.
[1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:34.640]  But they just say during the emergency, it'll be for every other crime you can imagine.
[1:19:34.640 --> 1:19:40.640]  It's the chairing on top of a nice big fudge Sunday called martial law.
[1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:42.640]  Oh, and the sprinkles on it.
[1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:45.640]  It's the big, great depression everybody's going to have.
[1:19:45.640 --> 1:19:48.640]  The folks that are all excited that you're getting time off work.
[1:19:48.640 --> 1:19:59.640]  Oh, you're going to get time off from your whole future, your family, your health and forced inoculations and gun confiscation.
[1:19:59.640 --> 1:20:10.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:15.640]  I remember when I lost my mind.
[1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:19.640]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[1:20:19.640 --> 1:20:27.640]  Even your emotions haven't let go in so much space.
[1:20:27.640 --> 1:20:32.640]  And when you're out there without care, yeah, I was out of touch.
[1:20:32.640 --> 1:20:36.640]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[1:20:36.640 --> 1:20:38.640]  I knew too much.
[1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:40.640]  I just knew too much.
[1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:42.640]  Yeah, it does.
[1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:44.640]  Does that make me crazy?
[1:20:44.640 --> 1:20:47.640]  New video just went live on infowars.com.
[1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:52.640]  We'll have the full video today on the war room, 3 to 6 p.m. with Owen Schreuer.
[1:20:52.640 --> 1:20:54.640]  Can't have his co-host Roger Stone on.
[1:20:54.640 --> 1:20:56.640]  He's gagged, set for prison.
[1:20:56.640 --> 1:20:58.640]  It's quite a war we're in.
[1:20:58.640 --> 1:21:07.640]  Austin Police threatened to arrest reporter for violating lockdown because they're out riding mopeds through downtown showing how it's a ghost town.
[1:21:07.640 --> 1:21:10.640]  Now, obviously, once they figured out they were reporters, they left them alone.
[1:21:10.640 --> 1:21:12.640]  That is a covered, defended piece.
[1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:14.640]  It's the First Amendment, but aren't.
[1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:16.640]  Is it freedom of assembly as well?
[1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:18.640]  This is all unconstitutional.
[1:21:18.640 --> 1:21:22.640]  Go ahead and roll a short clip of that report that premieres today at 3 p.m.
[1:21:22.640 --> 1:21:29.640]  Did they think they were about to arrest all of us?
[1:21:29.640 --> 1:21:35.640]  So first of all, these mopeds are 100% street legal.
[1:21:35.640 --> 1:21:37.640]  We've all been verified to ride these.
[1:21:37.640 --> 1:21:39.640]  We're on the streets of Austin, Texas.
[1:21:39.640 --> 1:21:45.640]  The streets are, I mean, they're, they're obviously a ghost town compared to normal, but there's still traffic out here.
[1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:47.640]  There's still people riding around.
[1:21:47.640 --> 1:21:55.640]  If you aren't American receiving this transmission, you are free.
[1:21:55.640 --> 1:22:09.640]  If you aren't American receiving this transmission, you are free.
[1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:24.640]  They're riding for radio listeners and they just keep repeating lockdown, lockdown, lockdown, stay in your homes.
[1:22:24.640 --> 1:22:27.640]  Look, I don't know what that cop's deal was.
[1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:31.640]  Obviously, he, he was trying to send us home for whatever reason.
[1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:32.640]  He wouldn't leave us alone.
[1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:34.640]  He came out here in a paddy wagon.
[1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:36.640]  Like, was he really expecting to arrest all of us?
[1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:37.640]  I'm serious.
[1:22:37.640 --> 1:22:38.640]  I've never seen that before.
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:43.640]  A paddy wagon riding around as street level law enforcement.
[1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:45.640]  Yeah, I think they're ready to arrest somebody.
[1:22:45.640 --> 1:22:52.640]  Seriously, like they've already to arrest somebody as if there's some mandatory enforced stay at home order that they can just enforce.
[1:22:52.640 --> 1:22:54.640]  It is totally illegal, folks.
[1:22:54.640 --> 1:22:58.640]  Okay, you have a bill of rights in the Constitution, but you don't even need that.
[1:22:58.640 --> 1:23:01.640]  You're a free man ordained by God.
[1:23:01.640 --> 1:23:10.640]  Okay, if you're receiving this transmission, if you are an American, you are free.
[1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:12.640]  All right, there's Owen Schreuer.
[1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:15.640]  We're going to go to a few more of your phone calls ahead of David.
[1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:24.640]  Like, there is just so much coming out, UK police for slamper spying on dog walkers with drones.
[1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:28.640]  70% of Americans now avoiding all public places.
[1:23:28.640 --> 1:23:31.640]  Plant down Chicago Mayor Warren's people who go outside can face arrest.
[1:23:31.640 --> 1:23:36.640]  I mean, this is just all these would be dictators are just having a great time.
[1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:44.640]  But the border gets to stay wide open and Mexico now is closing its border with us and Mexicans are protesting demanding it be fully shut.
[1:23:44.640 --> 1:23:47.640]  Now the shoes on the other foot, isn't it?
[1:23:47.640 --> 1:23:52.640]  Let's go ahead and talk to Adam in Texas has a theory about COVID-19. Go ahead, Adam. Thanks for calling.
[1:23:52.640 --> 1:23:54.640]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:58.640]  It's been a long time since I saw you at the in the federal in Dallas.
[1:23:58.640 --> 1:23:59.640]  Yes, sir.
[1:23:59.640 --> 1:24:04.640]  Okay, so all I'm going to do here is I'm going to point out the signpost.
[1:24:04.640 --> 1:24:06.640]  A lot of research needs to be done on this.
[1:24:06.640 --> 1:24:13.640]  But if you'll recall and if listeners will recall starting around July or August, we started seeing reports from the CDC about
[1:24:13.640 --> 1:24:19.640]  e-cigarette or vaping product used associated lung injury or e-valid.
[1:24:19.640 --> 1:24:24.640]  And all these young people couldn't breathe and some were dying and it was like it was like a pneumonia thing.
[1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:25.640]  They don't know what it was.
[1:24:25.640 --> 1:24:26.640]  Right, exactly.
[1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:29.640]  So I'm looking at a website for WebMD.com.
[1:24:29.640 --> 1:24:38.640]  Here are the listed symptoms of the e-valley, e-vaping syndrome, okay, fever, chills, cough, a hard time breathing, shortness of breath,
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:44.640]  chest tightness, belly pain, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea.
[1:24:44.640 --> 1:24:52.640]  Okay, now I'm looking at a CNN article from yesterday just going through a quick boil down of symptoms of COVID-19.
[1:24:52.640 --> 1:24:58.640]  It says, fever, cough, shortness of breath are not the only signs of sickness that have been seen in cases of COVID-19.
[1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:04.640]  Many other symptoms can resemble flu, including headaches, digestive issues, body aches, and fatigue.
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:12.640]  Okay, now yesterday I was listening to a podcast on elastamericansagabond.com.
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:18.640]  I think it's all data points to COVID-19 starting in the US, the title of the video.
[1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:20.640]  It's four and a half hours long.
[1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:27.640]  I only had a chance to go about 30 minutes into it, but it's discussing this lung syndrome associated with the e-vaping.
[1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:37.640]  And it also mentions at least one biolaboratory that was shut down by the CDC in, I believe, August for non-compliance.
[1:25:37.640 --> 1:25:40.640]  So there's a bunch of stuff that needs to be tied together.
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:42.640]  You know, what's the name of that syndrome?
[1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:46.640]  Because I remember talking about that with my teenage children and telling them not to vape and showing them those articles.
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:47.640]  What's the name of that syndrome?
[1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:48.640]  I thought it was something weird.
[1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:52.640]  Like, I know most of the cigarettes are made in, those e-cigarettes are made in China.
[1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:54.640]  I'm like, what the hell are they putting in there?
[1:25:54.640 --> 1:26:03.640]  Right, okay, so it's e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury or e-valley for short.
[1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:05.640]  E-valley for short, all right.
[1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:07.640]  Well, that's all I got, Alex. Thank you.
[1:26:07.640 --> 1:26:10.640]  Amazing, sir. That's why we take calls.
[1:26:10.640 --> 1:26:13.640]  The callers take us in directions we wouldn't go. They're amazing.
[1:26:13.640 --> 1:26:21.640]  Let's go to Christian and Delaware. Thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:26:21.640 --> 1:26:23.640]  Alex Jones, my man.
[1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:25.640]  How you doing, my man?
[1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:27.640]  Oh, I'm doing fantastic.
[1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:33.640]  Blessing to talk to you. God bless you and everyone that's involved in the InfoWars.
[1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:41.640]  First thing, if you're looking for a first-time purchase or you want to impress someone with a purchase from the InfoWars store,
[1:26:41.640 --> 1:26:45.640]  get the TurboForce. It is very exclusive.
[1:26:45.640 --> 1:26:52.640]  Oh, yeah, that'll jack somebody for 10 hours. Exactly. They want to get impressed. They want instant results. That's it, huh?
[1:26:52.640 --> 1:26:59.640]  Exactly. My mom did just start taking the X2. She has a thyroid problems.
[1:26:59.640 --> 1:27:07.640]  She has since, you know, had a lot of improvement. She's lost 17 pounds so far. It's been about a month.
[1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:13.640]  But it's kind of weird because I'm kind of like the black sheep of the family, the conspiracy theorists, you know,
[1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:19.640]  and so people don't trust me to take the products, but then when they do, it's like, you know, they have, you know, great results.
[1:27:19.640 --> 1:27:28.640]  So I want to thank you for that. Real quick, while I have a global audience, I have been personally assigned by God to explain my experiences.
[1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:37.640]  I've been the hell before. I've been sat down in front of God. I've had the presence of Jesus, and I've actually been able to save someone
[1:27:37.640 --> 1:27:43.640]  by him telling me that a certain person is going to die this day, and I was able to affect that.
[1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:51.640]  And I'm glad that the last caller called about e-cigarettes because I actually was told that by the Lord before it even happened
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:56.640]  that people would start dying by e-cigarettes. But real quick...
[1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:00.640]  You know, people can laugh at you, but it was mainly when I was younger. I had experiences similar to that.
[1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:07.640]  I'm not going to ever get into them, but I mean, I've definitely had big, big spiritual experiences and had dreams
[1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:14.640]  that were typical about that exactly came true and things like that. So it's real. And most people that die and get resuscitated,
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:20.640]  they go through a tunnel, they either go and get held in a purgatory, in an angel's there, and then they decide to sit back,
[1:28:20.640 --> 1:28:24.640]  or sometimes they actually get to have them for a minute or sit back, or they go to hell, and it's exactly...
[1:28:24.640 --> 1:28:31.640]  And this is Hindus, this is Satanists, this is everybody. It happens to everybody universally, forever.
[1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:37.640]  And so it's definitely real. About a time, Christian, you got David Ike coming up.
[1:28:37.640 --> 1:28:42.640]  And if you want to hold folks, we'll get to you later if not call me back in the fourth hour when we're going to have another bit of open calls.
[1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:48.640]  But David Ike, one of those sought after, interesting people in the world, is with us for an hour and a half straight ahead.
[1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:52.640]  So tell folks, tune in however you're listening or however you're not listening. If you're listening to AMNFM, great.
[1:28:52.640 --> 1:29:02.640]  On the Internet, spread the word either way.
[1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:34.640]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive. Forget bunkers, you're not a live underground gopher.
[1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:43.640]  You need survivalist camps, the ultimate, fully functional, off the grid mobile survival bug outhouse that's well equipped and custom built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:50.640]  Bold statement, you bet. See them now at survivalistcamps.com. That's survivalistcamps.com.
[1:29:50.640 --> 1:29:58.640]  Trust your family survival to survivalistcamps.com.
[1:29:58.640 --> 1:30:09.640]  The globalist and the enemy of the people, corporate media, have worked overtime like the devil to destroy all independent pro-America truth-based media.
[1:30:09.640 --> 1:30:19.640]  And chief amongst their enemy has been infowars. But thanks to you spreading the word and thanks to you supporting infowars, we are still on the air and have actually expanded in the face of their tyranny.
[1:30:19.640 --> 1:30:31.640]  It is now more critical than ever that you take this opportunity to share Bandod video and infowars.com and the articles and reports that are so critical because the world is waking up and needs this information now more than ever.
[1:30:31.640 --> 1:30:45.640]  For myself and the Infowars crew, you have our undying pledge and commitment to fight these tyrants harder than we ever have before and to defend basic freedom and justice and the American way of life.
[1:30:45.640 --> 1:30:55.640]  This is the Crossroads, America and the planet in the balance. Whatever you do, please take action and spread the word. God bless and good luck.
[1:31:15.640 --> 1:31:20.640]  We are active and wake others up to understand this is the world government, the castle society it is all being announced.
[1:31:20.640 --> 1:31:29.640]  And get prepared yourselves and boost your immune systems and get high quality food. And we are able to ship storeable food again.
[1:31:29.640 --> 1:31:37.640]  Our supplier has expanded their factories and now are able to take new wars. And it is not about this virus folks, that is only the trigger, the detonator.
[1:31:37.640 --> 1:31:47.640]  It is about what is coming in the future where elections may be cancelled, where the global is trying to implode the economy. This is just the beginning of the crisis, not the middle and not the end.
[1:31:47.640 --> 1:31:56.640]  So get prepared now while you still can at Infowars.com and please be Paul Revere's and spread the word.
[1:31:56.640 --> 1:32:06.640]  You have to look really hard at mainstream television news and print media and mainstream establishment media news sites to find it.
[1:32:06.640 --> 1:32:13.640]  I did extensive searches online with different search engines. I did a bunch of research looking at different TV archives.
[1:32:13.640 --> 1:32:28.640]  And I couldn't find hardly anything except a couple local news stories with medical doctors on there talking about zinc, zinc, zinc, the element on the periodic table that is essential to life.
[1:32:28.640 --> 1:32:42.640]  And that is the most antiviral natural compound out there in thousands and thousands of studies by the most prestigious universities, including big studies on the coronavirus family.
[1:32:42.640 --> 1:32:58.640]  So do yourself a favor, search engine, zinc and antiviral. Three words, zinc, antiviral, zinc, antiviral. Do yourself a favor, zinc, antiviral.
[1:33:13.640 --> 1:33:18.640]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[1:33:18.640 --> 1:33:28.640]  He never gives up. He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:43.640]  Well, we're very honored to have one of the freest thinkers out there, David Ike, thanks for himself. And he's been exposing the false reality for 30 years or so.
[1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:51.640]  And he's been taken out of context. It's like they do me and many of you to distort what he's saying.
[1:33:51.640 --> 1:34:00.640]  And I got to tell you, when I first read one of his books, 27, 28 years ago, I thought, well, a lot of this makes sense.
[1:34:00.640 --> 1:34:06.640]  A lot of this historically, I'd already read a lot of books about the CFR and globalism. I knew about it. I'd grown up learning about it.
[1:34:06.640 --> 1:34:11.640]  And that was all right. But then a lot of it was just so far out. I thought it was crazy.
[1:34:11.640 --> 1:34:18.640]  But then as I studied the globalist more 26 years on air, this is what they follow. This is what they really believe.
[1:34:18.640 --> 1:34:26.640]  And we're going to go to the bottom of the rabbit hole today, but a great place to start is the COVID-19.
[1:34:26.640 --> 1:34:32.640]  And everything that comes with it and the hysteria involved in it and how it covers all the major agendas.
[1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:38.640]  So I really want to hear what David Ike has to say. And so I'm going to try to be a good boy in the next two hours or so.
[1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:43.640]  And we're going to take your calls after that. We'll take some calls while he's on with us. That's up to David here today.
[1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:49.640]  David Ike.com. Again, I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com and newswars.com. And he's been a shadow band.
[1:34:49.640 --> 1:34:52.640]  I've been totally banned except on radio stations and my own platform.
[1:34:52.640 --> 1:35:00.640]  So please remember this interview will be posted in full to band.video and everyone is authorized and encouraged.
[1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:06.640]  All the radio shows, all the TV shows, all the films are what are called free to air.
[1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:12.640]  And that is a broadcast media term, meaning anybody can take it, anybody can use it, anybody can edit it.
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:16.640]  Anybody can attack me with it. You can promote us with it.
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:23.640]  I just want you to know that it's free to air. It's open source. It's copyright free.
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:28.640]  It is Creative Commons to the world 100%.
[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:31.640]  And so the only way this interview will have legs other than our audience,
[1:35:31.640 --> 1:35:37.640]  which our personal audience at infowars.com and newswars.com and band.video is triple whatever it was.
[1:35:37.640 --> 1:35:42.640]  Okay, millions of visitors a day, millions of views a day, millions watching our podcast today,
[1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:47.640]  but it's that group, some of it gets out before we got out everywhere.
[1:35:47.640 --> 1:35:53.640]  So the only way this gets out of the prison is when you share this with David Ike's about to say here today.
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:57.640]  So we're very honored to have him. And so I'm going to try to sit back as much as I can,
[1:35:57.640 --> 1:36:03.640]  give him the floor about this period of time we've reached that is, is into the New World Order,
[1:36:03.640 --> 1:36:07.640]  is into their implantable chip, forced inoculation system.
[1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:11.640]  It's all here. The debate's over. Ike's been totally vindicated.
[1:36:11.640 --> 1:36:15.640]  I've been vindicated. It's happening exactly as we said it would because they told us they do it this way.
[1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:17.640]  David, Ike, thank you very much, sir.
[1:36:17.640 --> 1:36:19.640]  Hello, Alex. How are you doing?
[1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:27.640]  I, um, I greet you from lockdown Britain where democracy has been suspended,
[1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:36.640]  extraordinary draconian laws have been passed by a pathetic parliament where we cannot,
[1:36:36.640 --> 1:36:43.640]  um, according to the law, um, gathering numbers more than two, unless they are people we live with.
[1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:52.640]  We have one opportunity a day to take exercise and we can go to get food.
[1:36:52.640 --> 1:37:00.640]  And, um, when you go to the supermarkets, uh, you have long lines that are not necessary, by the way.
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:05.640]  It's the system that makes it like that long lines, um, outside the supermarket.
[1:37:05.640 --> 1:37:14.640]  Because what they're doing now is, um, insisting that everyone standing in line has to be six feet from the next person.
[1:37:14.640 --> 1:37:22.640]  And they're working on the basis of one person in the supermarket when another one comes out.
[1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:25.640]  They ought to put traffic lights up. It's like entering a freeway.
[1:37:25.640 --> 1:37:34.640]  Uh, and, um, so that's where we are. And it is extraordinary, you know, that over the years,
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:41.640]  so many people have said to me and commented about my work and other people like you.
[1:37:41.640 --> 1:37:47.640]  And they've said this idea that a few people can control the world is ridiculous.
[1:37:47.640 --> 1:37:50.640]  That would be impossible.
[1:37:50.640 --> 1:38:01.640]  The human race in vast numbers, not everybody, but in vast numbers, has given away their world, their lives, their freedom,
[1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:05.640]  their ability to make their own decisions, which is what freedom is about.
[1:38:05.640 --> 1:38:22.640]  Freedom is all about choice. And they've done that in a matter of days in the most extraordinary process of imposition on a population
[1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:28.640]  which largely has not resisted it, but insisted that it happens.
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:39.640]  We have had the media here who have campaigned and criticised until this lockdown happened.
[1:38:39.640 --> 1:38:48.640]  Among them appears Morgan, this legend in his own lifetime or legend in his own mind.
[1:38:48.640 --> 1:38:51.640]  And now they've got what they're called for.
[1:38:51.640 --> 1:38:58.640]  And to, um, to an extent, I don't think the Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to go this far.
[1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:03.640]  He was the one that was resisting having professional soccer shut down.
[1:39:03.640 --> 1:39:06.640]  It was the soccer organisations themselves.
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:12.640]  And Trump did as well, but they said every person that dies is your fault, literally holding everyone hostage.
[1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:21.640]  This is the point. You see, we have now a technocracy.
[1:39:21.640 --> 1:39:23.640]  This is what they want anyway, a global technocracy.
[1:39:23.640 --> 1:39:30.640]  But a technocracy is a society that's run by bureaucrats, experts, engineers, scientists, whatever.
[1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:37.640]  And this lockdown is being driven worldwide by advisors.
[1:39:37.640 --> 1:39:45.640]  Yes, there are some politicians who are absolutely in on it and will be very happy to front up its imposition.
[1:39:45.640 --> 1:39:51.640]  But those that are saying, well, hold on a minute, and this is the point.
[1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:54.640]  What is the catastrophic consequence?
[1:39:54.640 --> 1:40:01.640]  Not of the virus, get into that, but of the response to the virus.
[1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:08.640]  And so you're absolutely right. What happens is these technocrats in the dark suits.
[1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:15.640]  They say, well, look, Mr. President, look, Mr. Prime Minister, our computer models.
[1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:20.640]  And let's not forget, ladies and gentlemen of the world, these projections.
[1:40:20.640 --> 1:40:22.640]  Oh, my God, we're all going to die.
[1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:26.640]  We're not coming from computer projections.
[1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:34.640]  You don't have the same computer projections that told us there would be no ice at the poles by now, the North Pole.
[1:40:34.640 --> 1:40:40.640]  But, you know, people will be swimming in New York because of climate change.
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:44.640]  Those are computer models.
[1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:50.640]  And so they say, our computer models say that this is what's going to happen unless you do this.
[1:40:50.640 --> 1:41:00.640]  And if you don't do anything, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, then all those deaths are going to be down to you and you're going to get the blame.
[1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:13.640]  Well, it takes a lot of backbone to actually resist that and good on those who try and see beyond it.
[1:41:13.640 --> 1:41:20.640]  Because, you know, this is being, Alex, this is being promoted as a health crisis.
[1:41:20.640 --> 1:41:21.640]  It is not.
[1:41:21.640 --> 1:41:35.640]  If you break the figures down and you look in detail at this virus and its consequences, it is not an end of the world genocidal bio weapon.
[1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:36.640]  It ain't.
[1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:42.640]  Now, they have those things and no doubt they have in mind at some point to use them.
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:46.640]  But people aren't falling down all over the place.
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:42:04.640]  It's affecting exactly as the flu does people with compromised immune systems, those old people and those who have other health problems which are draining their immune system that's trying to cope.
[1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:08.640]  Here's a figure from the Italian Health Service.
[1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:18.640]  99% of people who died allegedly of this virus, we can get into that as well as we go along.
[1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:26.640]  99% had one, two, three or more other health problems.
[1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:30.640]  So you're dealing with damaged immune systems.
[1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:34.640]  Actually, David, it's 99% at other illnesses.
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:38.640]  Hold on, we'll be right back with David, like the legend.
[1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:39.640]  There's not a lot of legends out there.
[1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:42.640]  They describe legendary status of a lot of people.
[1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:43.640]  No, this guy's a legend.
[1:42:43.640 --> 1:42:47.640]  Who cares about legendary basketball players or legendary, you know, movie people.
[1:42:47.640 --> 1:42:53.640]  This is a legendary outlaw maverick on the outlaw transmission.
[1:42:53.640 --> 1:42:55.640]  Stay with us.
[1:42:55.640 --> 1:43:05.640]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[1:44:56.640 --> 1:45:13.640]  Listen, there's a show from PBS called It's Okay to Be Smart. So everyone who's been smart and has been put down for it and persecuted, it's okay to finally be smart.
[1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:21.640]  That's right, there's not two sexes and families are bad and the right thing to do is to sterilize your son so he knows we've got an evil war monger.
[1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:26.640]  I mean a lot of feminists were saying we should have the government pass laws that mail embryos account.
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:33.640]  But what's better and more reformed and more humanitarian is to convince them when they're five years old to have their testicles chopped off.
[1:45:33.640 --> 1:45:37.640]  And again, global warming's real. We've got to pay Lord Rothschild all of our money and the pandemic's all real.
[1:45:37.640 --> 1:45:42.640]  We've got to be locked up in our houses. We've got to use the language the universities say.
[1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:47.640]  We're not a culture or anything. Oh no, no, we're not. We're good people.
[1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:56.640]  We're people that went to these corporate systems that didn't brainwash us. No, no, they enlightened us how to censor and how to rule and how to control.
[1:46:18.640 --> 1:46:25.640]  China who hyped up this virus is now back to work and ramping up their economy while ours is going into a freefall spiral.
[1:46:25.640 --> 1:46:33.640]  And Trump's desperately trying to restart it and create confidence in the globalist corporate media that was worshiping China just a month or so ago.
[1:46:33.640 --> 1:46:39.640]  And their response is saying Trump is terrible because they want America to fail. They want you to fail.
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:42.640]  But you could expose them. You could speak out.
[1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:49.640]  You could share the articles and videos and reports at InfoWars and Band-Aught Video that expose them and the globalist will go down.
[1:46:49.640 --> 1:47:18.640]  It's already blowing up in their face right now. So press the attack on the InfoWars and defeat the NWO.
[1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:35.640]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. David Ike, the author, researcher, former head of the Green Party, former top goalie, national BBC host, traded it all in to expose the New World Order right at the big of his career.
[1:47:35.640 --> 1:47:38.640]  And here we are 30 years later.
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:45.640]  He was the end of that first wave waking up and we were the start of the big, huge wave and now there's that gigantic wave coming in.
[1:47:45.640 --> 1:47:48.640]  But the counter is new viruses.
[1:47:48.640 --> 1:47:57.640]  And I've got, as we predicted, Harvard has come out and said this is the new way of life, but to turn the lockdowns on and off forever now with this virus and others.
[1:47:57.640 --> 1:48:02.640]  And you're going to have to take force inoculations. You'll have apps on your phone that tell you when you can go outside when you can't.
[1:48:02.640 --> 1:48:09.640]  We've got some reporters coming on from the UK. Ike was talking about that where you're allowed to go out and exercise, but the police say keep moving, keep moving.
[1:48:09.640 --> 1:48:16.640]  This is beyond 1984 where she comes on the telescreen and tells Winston Smith, you know, to do your exercises better.
[1:48:16.640 --> 1:48:19.640]  And you see people getting into the conformity.
[1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:33.640]  Look, I have a family member whose family member called her last night and said, I hope you're conforming to staying at home and doing as you're told and send us a PBS video called the smart guys about how we're all dead if we don't do this.
[1:48:33.640 --> 1:48:37.640]  And I'm noticing the left and the conformist are the ones really getting into it.
[1:48:37.640 --> 1:48:47.640]  I know Ike's got issues with Trump, so do I, but clearly Boris Johnson, Trump are a different faction of this and they couldn't get rid of him with Russia Gate or Ukraine Gate.
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:56.640]  And now China's back to business, Russia's back to business, but America, they say, can never reopen and this is a permanent new thing and the election may have to be suspended.
[1:48:56.640 --> 1:49:03.640]  You can see the power grab and if the public submits to this, well, I'll show you the articles in a moment while David talks.
[1:49:03.640 --> 1:49:08.640]  They're now at Harvard and the CDC saying, this is your new way of life.
[1:49:08.640 --> 1:49:16.640]  And in China, you have an Alibaba app, the government runs through their Amazon, where you go out when it tells you and in France, you download a form.
[1:49:16.640 --> 1:49:24.640]  This is just leapfrogging from where they were behind in their police state to way deep into where they wanted to go.
[1:49:24.640 --> 1:49:28.640]  So David Ike, please continue, sir, with where you left off.
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:34.640]  Yeah, I was saying that this is not about health.
[1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:51.640]  And of course, the legacy of what is happening is going to be economic, which in itself will lead to massive health problems through economic deprivation, through homelessness.
[1:49:51.640 --> 1:50:04.640]  You know, it's like sort of an explosion has gone on and people are so shocked and bewildered by the initial explosion.
[1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:12.640]  They're not yet, although some directly will be experiencing it, seeing the real fallout.
[1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:33.640]  And we are looking all over the world now in this country and your country all over the world at a holocaust against small, medium, even some big businesses not connected to this global cult.
[1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:43.640]  That will never be the same again and vast numbers of them will never open again. They're gone.
[1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:49.640]  And with them go the people that own them and run them.
[1:50:49.640 --> 1:51:09.640]  With them go all the people who are employed by them. I mean, just closing the restaurants and bars and associated businesses in the United States has affected directly.
[1:51:09.640 --> 1:51:23.640]  Nearly 16 million people because the restaurant industry and all that's associated with it is the biggest private sector employer in the United States.
[1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:32.640]  And that's not including all the supply chains of food suppliers and other suppliers.
[1:51:32.640 --> 1:51:51.640]  What's been targeted is the very area of the global economy that this cult wants rid of because the game is to create what I've been calling for years, the Hunger Games Society.
[1:51:51.640 --> 1:51:54.640]  And my goodness me, does this fit current events?
[1:51:54.640 --> 1:52:03.640]  Well, the Bilderberg group, as you know, is leaked before in Davos. They'll say people shouldn't have money to come here and protest us. We want to get rid of a middle class. We don't want people going out and having dinner.
[1:52:03.640 --> 1:52:10.640]  We don't want people having a car to go drive to the countryside. They want us locked down. That's the nature of an authoritarian system.
[1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:25.640]  What Americans, because our version of the middle class is slightly different, but what Americans call the middle class, of course, has been the target all along. And there's a reason for that, which I'll come to. I've already started to go there.
[1:52:25.640 --> 1:52:41.640]  And what is going to be absolutely demolished by what is happening on purpose, the livelihoods and independence of what America calls the middle classes.
[1:52:41.640 --> 1:52:46.640]  So if we go back to this structure, it's been in my books for years of the Hunger Games Society.
[1:52:46.640 --> 1:53:05.640]  You have a pyramid and at the top of the pyramid is a tiny few people that we could call them the 1%. A tiny few people, the elite at the bottom of this pyramid are planned to be pretty much the rest of humanity in
[1:53:05.640 --> 1:53:25.640]  the middle class. And so the attitude via dependency, watch current events upon the elite and in between the two to hold that status quo in permanence is planned to be a, not just a police state, but a police military
[1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:40.640]  state because they fused the two eventually to hold the status quo to stop the the massive people challenging the elite and to impose the will of elite elite upon the people.
[1:53:40.640 --> 1:54:00.640]  And this Hunger Games Society is designed to be run as a technocracy. People can call it fascism, they can call it communism. And in the outplay of it, yes, it's that kind of tyranny, but it's run, not even by politicians,
[1:54:00.640 --> 1:54:11.640]  but in the end, but by technocrats and crucially, by control of everything through AI, thus who controls AI controls the whole system.
[1:54:11.640 --> 1:54:21.640]  By the way, you said this 20 years ago, I said it 20 years ago for their own statements. Now they're all over the news that this is official. There's no speculation now. This is it.
[1:54:21.640 --> 1:54:39.640]  Yeah. So what we're seeing, because, you know, I've been saying for years, you know, way back when people were saying, oh, it's just a conspiracy theory that, you know, this whole situation that we're now seeing unfold around us has been worked towards
[1:54:39.640 --> 1:54:56.640]  step by step, what I call the totalitarian tiptoe decade after decade after decade. But I said way back, there's going to come a point where it has to break the surface where we can see it, or it's not going to transform society in the way that it wants.
[1:54:56.640 --> 1:55:03.640]  And so what we're seeing now is that breaking of the surface big time.
[1:55:03.640 --> 1:55:15.640]  And that's right on a Richter scale. Previous attempts were just conditioning. It is now totally like a submerged submarine blasted up. You ever seen a sub come up quick and it shoots up like 20 feet in the air, 60 feet in the air.
[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:23.640]  It is like a submarine, you know, doing a quick surfacing guys pull up submarine nuclear submarine does fast surface. You'll see it explode out.
[1:55:23.640 --> 1:55:35.640]  Set the waters calm. Boom. They finally had to launch their sneak attack like Hitler building up his trips in World War two. We saw him build up. But suddenly Blitzkrieg they've now Blitzkrieg they've launched the full assault.
[1:55:35.640 --> 1:55:56.640]  And what they've done is they've moved from hiding it to selling it. So they've been hiding what the smart grid AI control system is all about. But now they're breaking the surface because they have to bring it in.
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:15.640]  So now they've gone to sales pitch. And that is that connecting the human brain to AI. So AI becomes the human mind and it will make us God. So that's the sales pitch and the sales pitch with what's going on now is this virus is deadly.
[1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:34.640]  And unless you give up all your freedoms and allow the few to control everything and dictate everything, there is going to be mass deaths and consequences for humans. So this is part of moving from hiding it to selling it.
[1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:42.640]  And people need to ask a few questions. Let's look at old people here.
[1:56:42.640 --> 1:56:51.640]  We are being asked to believe around the world in America and in this country big time in this country in Britain.
[1:56:51.640 --> 1:57:13.640]  That a system that treats old people with absolute contempt that in this country has them paying in from taxation all their lives. Many old people today fought in wars, lost loved ones in wars, elite wars.
[1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:29.640]  They didn't know what they were at the time. They've served society all their lives. And then at the end of their lives, they're played out overwhelmingly with a what they call a pension.
[1:57:29.640 --> 1:57:38.640]  Stay there. Stay there. We got to go back and before they ever get it, they're killed with a bio weapon. And Bill Gates openly says kill the old people and he's the guy openly preparing us for this.
[1:57:38.640 --> 1:57:44.640]  Hour number two with David Ike is two minutes away. Spread the word now.
[1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:23.640]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful. No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, we're all feeling the strain from rising pressure.

[2:00:00.640 --> 2:00:15.640]  Alex Jones, your host, we're now into the third hour on this March 26 Thursday live transmission. He was getting into how they're treating the old people, how they claim they care about them so much and want to save them so much when this virus targets them.
[2:00:15.640 --> 2:00:18.640]  David, please continue.
[2:00:18.640 --> 2:00:42.640]  I was saying, you know, they pay what they call pensioners in this country a sum every month. It is pathetic and they live out their lives deciding whether to spend their money to stay warm or spend their money to eat.
[2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:54.640]  As a result, they eat crap food, toxic food, the worst food. They can't afford anything more and they can't afford nutrients to boost their immune system.
[2:00:54.640 --> 2:01:04.640]  You vitamin A's, you vitamin C's, you vitamin D3's and no one in the system, even now, by the way, is telling them they need to do that.
[2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:24.640]  And now, having treated the elderly like that, generation after generation, and it's getting worse, we are being asked to believe that the entire global economic system must be shut down to protect old people.
[2:01:24.640 --> 2:01:34.640]  They don't give a damn about old people. And when they start saying they do, there's a scam going on. And there's a few things, Alex, that relate to this.
[2:01:34.640 --> 2:01:51.640]  You will have noticed, and many other people I'm sure will have noticed, that there is a clear campaign and agenda in my country, as in yours, to create a wedge, a division between the young and the old.
[2:01:51.640 --> 2:01:56.640]  This is the old Greta Dunberg scenario.
[2:01:56.640 --> 2:02:01.640]  How dare you, old people? We're going to push you up against the wall.
[2:02:01.640 --> 2:02:09.640]  It's you, old people, who have destroyed the planet and are destroying our lives. It's your fault.
[2:02:09.640 --> 2:02:15.640]  How dare you, David Ike? I'm going to get you with my auntie for parents.
[2:02:15.640 --> 2:02:22.640]  Oh, yeah, that's very much the theme of what it's all about.
[2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:32.640]  And the thing is that with Brexit in this country, you had another division between, it's the old people that want Brexit.
[2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:38.640]  They're destroying our lives. We'll wait for them to die and go back in. So there is this division.
[2:02:38.640 --> 2:03:02.640]  So what is going to happen? Because it's not about primarily the now, here and now, it's about what this will reverberate into when people start to realize the world that they knew has gone already and in weeks, even more so.
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:14.640]  And a lot of young people and a lot of younger people are going to be saying, this only happened because we were protecting those old people.
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:17.640]  You'll see, you'll see a backlash that way. Absolutely.
[2:03:17.640 --> 2:03:26.640]  Twitter allows the huge promotion of let's kill the boomers and the younger licking toilet seats, hoping to incubate and kill their parents.
[2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:52.640]  Well, that's that's the thing. This removed the boomers. And what an irony that is, Alex, you know, what an irony that so many people of the generations that the workers now want to do away with were the flower power anti establishment counterculture of the 1960s.
[2:03:52.640 --> 2:04:09.640]  It's ironic. But this is where it's going. And these things will be played out because, you know, I've written in my books for a long time about this plan for what they call the demise pill where you get to a certain age and you take this pill and you're gone.
[2:04:09.640 --> 2:04:11.640]  And this is this is not.
[2:04:11.640 --> 2:04:30.640]  Logan's run. Logan's run. This is not fantasy. This. This is what they tell you if you if you look at the insiders and what they say. And therefore, while it seems to be protecting old people now, actually, this is going to be turned against them eventually.
[2:04:30.640 --> 2:04:40.640]  And when I'm talking about the Hunger Games Society, what is going to be the impact of what is being done now around the world?
[2:04:40.640 --> 2:04:51.640]  I'm going to go to 60 second break. Some stations join us. Let's talk about the Hunger Games impact. And I want to ask you 9 11 clearly is a trigger brings us to the next big trigger. The triggers get exponentially bigger.
[2:04:51.640 --> 2:04:55.640]  What's the next trigger after this? We'll be right back.

[2:06:06.640 --> 2:06:16.640]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:06:16.640 --> 2:06:26.640]  Live from the info wars dot com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:26.640 --> 2:06:42.640]  Not everyone has been caught in the trance on everyone is under the spell of the fallen one and his operatives were trying to create the post human future and are now admitting it and worshipping their AI gods that demand all the humans die.
[2:06:42.640 --> 2:06:51.640]  And then they will give them ascension to the next level in the silicon world and the universe they created outside of this one.
[2:06:51.640 --> 2:07:01.640]  And then of course, the big Illuminati head of the C Clark childhoods and the upload of our bodies.
[2:07:01.640 --> 2:07:13.640]  The little devils red devils horns lovingly help us transcend and they blow the planet up. Nice folks. That's the inventor of the telecommunications satellite and the guy that wrote 2001 space Odyssey.
[2:07:13.640 --> 2:07:22.640]  It's all in your face. We'll get some into that with David. I coming up later. What's really behind it. Everybody's ready for the truth. They don't even attack me when I talk about this anymore. Everybody deep down knows it.
[2:07:22.640 --> 2:07:28.640]  The globalists admit it. They're not atheist folks. They're they're tapped into the bad guys.
[2:07:28.640 --> 2:07:42.640]  But David, I you're talking about how they're now playing young off against old. They're they're they're openly on Fox News going. It's the it's the young people spreading it and then they tell the young people it's the old people that are causing all this divide and conquer.
[2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:52.640]  Get rid of your grandma. But if 9 11, your new book, The Trigger, which I guess you were pressing, you know, coming out with four months ago about you were all with us, then you said there'll be a next big trigger.
[2:07:52.640 --> 2:08:00.640]  And we talked about will it be a bio attack folks should go back to that interview. And so it's obviously manufactured, but it's meant to be a simulant where they know what it'll do.
[2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:13.640]  They know who will target so they can control it to create that division, that maximum fear that martial law precedent. So they can also be blamed on economies and nationals presidents.
[2:08:13.640 --> 2:08:27.640]  But with David, I care with us. Finish up your thought on that and then the next big trigger and what you're expecting to come next from these anti human operatives.
[2:08:27.640 --> 2:08:42.640]  Well, if I just quickly finish the point about the old people, there's there's another little angle on this. You're not mentioned earlier that they're now standing in line as you say in America queuing as we say in Britain, outside
[2:08:42.640 --> 2:09:04.640]  the supermarket six feet apart going right off into the distance. Well, old people are in those lines. And, you know, we've had a couple of sunny days in Britain, but we'll have days of pouring rain and biting wind.
[2:09:04.640 --> 2:09:13.640]  And those lines will still be there and there'll be old people in them. What do you think that's going to do to their health? And then you've got people locked away.
[2:09:13.640 --> 2:09:25.640]  So, especially if they haven't got a garden, they are kept out of the sun. What do they say about these coronaviruses? Oh, yeah, they die when it gets warm. That's why they happen in the winter.
[2:09:25.640 --> 2:09:38.640]  Okay, why? Oh, because of the sunshine. Yeah, okay. So why are you locking people away from the sunshine? It makes no sense because it's not about health. It is about control.
[2:09:38.640 --> 2:09:49.640]  And as I was saying earlier, if you look at that Hunger Games pyramid, few at the top, the police military state enforcing the status quo and then the rest of humanity,
[2:09:49.640 --> 2:10:09.640]  they are in dependency on the few. What is going to happen? What is happening now to all those people who own small business and even bigger business and all those people employed by them, those 15-odd million people in the restaurant
[2:10:09.640 --> 2:10:28.640]  all alone in the United States. Where are they going to go? Where are they going now? They're falling into that lower echelon of the Hunger Games society because you see, while people have an independence of income and an independence of livelihood,
[2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:47.640]  they are not dependent upon the elite. So you destroy that. This is what this is about. And therefore you create dependency. And there's one thing that I'm seeing. I've had to smile to myself and shake my head a few times in the last little while.
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:11:03.640]  They're now talking about, oh, well, you know, people losing their jobs and AI taking jobs. What we need is a guaranteed income because we're nice people. We are, you know, we want to give you some money every month.
[2:11:03.640 --> 2:11:29.640]  Now, this is how that works. This is what it's really about. You give people a guaranteed income that is C, British pension, derisory, and keeps them at a living level and a choice and opportunity level that's down there at the bottom rung of the Hunger Games society.
[2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:41.640]  But it doesn't end there. You say to them, I'm going to come to China in a second. Oh, but we only pay you if you behave the way we say you should behave.
[2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:54.640]  Oh, by the way, if you don't want to take the guaranteed income because you don't want the consequences and the strings that come with it, where else are you going to earn your living? There's no jobs anymore.
[2:11:54.640 --> 2:11:59.640]  Remember that big, that big pandemic that actually, you know, wasn't.
[2:11:59.640 --> 2:12:15.640]  So it's beyond, it's demand of just domestication. It's removing a human environment of any type of self sufficiency. And they admit that. And now the UK saying, if you are racist, which means anything they define like being Brexit, then you're going to be denied healthcare.
[2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:26.640]  So it's really a very nightmarish meat grinding system. It's a system to divide off groups, have them destroyed by the other groups that think they're part of the winning team.
[2:12:26.640 --> 2:12:36.640]  But then you just start shaving off more and more of the groups until there's nobody. And finally, the paramilitary force is replaced with robots, and then it's a post human world.
[2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:54.640]  There was a quote, I'll summarize it by Winston Churchill, who talked about people feeding and supporting the dragon, the serpent in the hope that it would eat them last.
[2:12:54.640 --> 2:13:07.640]  And that's so prevalent in society today. The woke mentality, if young people watching this, if you're in any way woke.
[2:13:07.640 --> 2:13:26.640]  The woke mentality is a creation of this 1% elite to get you to demand your own prison cell. And it is no coincidence whatsoever.
[2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:39.640]  That what is demanded by the climate hoax, the human cause climate hoax to save the world are the same tick boxes of this virus.
[2:13:39.640 --> 2:13:53.640]  We had Prince Charles going to Davos and the World Economic Forum. Dr. Long ago, matter of weeks ago, calling for a new economic system to save the planet by 2030, this ever recurring year.
[2:13:53.640 --> 2:14:00.640]  And as they say, don't leave your house. You've got to work from home. You've got to be authorized by a computer to be in a car or eat meat.
[2:14:00.640 --> 2:14:10.640]  Schoolchildren in the UK, as you know, are shown those films about megapolis. We're in the future. So yes, this is the whole Green Deal, Greta Thunberg Rothschild carbon credit.
[2:14:10.640 --> 2:14:13.640]  Now they run via a virus.
[2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:26.640]  All, all connects together. And I've got a quote here. You may have come across it, which is absolutely brilliant by a professor, Dr. Sukrit Bhatti.
[2:14:26.640 --> 2:14:32.640]  And this guy is a highly acclaimed infectious medicine specialist in Germany.
[2:14:32.640 --> 2:14:43.640]  And he's one of these kind of people who's come out and, you know, spoken against the narrative. And there's there's a lot of these people, but they just don't get in the mainstream media.
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:49.640]  And he was asked what he thought from a virus response point of view of these lockdowns.
[2:14:49.640 --> 2:15:03.640]  And he said they are grotesque, absurd, and very dangerous. All these measures are leading to self destruction and collective suicide because of nothing but a spook.
[2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:16.640]  And one of the things, one of the effects of this, Alex, as this lockdown, basically, well, that basically let's not mess with words, puts people under house arrest in effect.
[2:15:16.640 --> 2:15:22.640]  It's going to have massive psychological problems and impacts upon them as well.
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:29.640]  Being in that confined space all the time, day after day, week after week. All this is part of it as well.
[2:15:29.640 --> 2:15:36.640]  Because in the end, it's a psychological game. And the way it works is this, the way the system works is this.
[2:15:36.640 --> 2:15:40.640]  And we've seen this so blatantly in the last few weeks.
[2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:46.640]  If you want to go to break, tell us how the system works. I 100% agree. Genius layout of this. Thank God for David.
[2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:50.640]  They've got their AI and their global assistance. We've got we got David.
[2:15:50.640 --> 2:16:11.640]  Stay with us.
[2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:27.640]  Be hydrated food is becoming scarce. You can still get enough open pollinated heirloom seeds to grow a one acre crisis garden.
[2:16:27.640 --> 2:16:34.640]  The truth is, growing nutrient dense vegetables in the days ahead may actually be the single most important thing you do.

[2:17:54.640 --> 2:18:00.640]  Newtonian physics documents the fact that for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[2:18:00.640 --> 2:18:04.640]  Matter is not destroyed, it is simply transferred into another form.
[2:18:04.640 --> 2:18:10.640]  Well, we're seeing that happen right now. The globalists are openly trying to hype up the coronavirus, trying to kill our economy
[2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:19.640]  and trying to have martial law shut down around the country and trying to stampede Trump into implementing it so they can blame the imploding economy on him.
[2:18:19.640 --> 2:18:28.640]  But Trump has seen through it and so he's let them implement the draconian controls and is saying, do you really want a depression for something that's killed far less than the flu?
[2:18:28.640 --> 2:18:31.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the fight of our lives.
[2:18:31.640 --> 2:18:38.640]  And the good news is their attack on humanity and on independent media has caused a lot of people to start thinking for themselves.
[2:18:38.640 --> 2:18:45.640]  And so the traffic to infowars.com and band.video is triple our previous records right now.
[2:18:45.640 --> 2:18:54.640]  So you're doing a great job spreading the word and people are tuning in to find out the truth like never before because of you, the modern Paul Revere's.
[2:18:54.640 --> 2:18:59.640]  For more than eight weeks, infowars has researched this deadly coronavirus and it is deadly.
[2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:06.640]  It targets those who already have preexisting conditions, compromised immune systems and those over 70, particularly bad.
[2:19:06.640 --> 2:19:14.640]  It is deadly, but the globalists are hyping it as an economic and psychological warfare weapon to implement martial law and throw Trump out of office.
[2:19:14.640 --> 2:19:22.640]  But regardless, the mainstream media will not tell you about natural compounds that are known to be extremely antiviral like zinc.
[2:19:22.640 --> 2:19:27.640]  So I don't care where you get zinc for yourself, your parents, your grandparents, your children.
[2:19:27.640 --> 2:19:34.640]  Please go out and research zinc and then know that we have three different formulas that have zinc in them at a very nice dosage level.
[2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:38.640]  Real red pill, real red pill plus and vitamin mineral fusion.

[2:20:16.640 --> 2:20:25.640]  David Iksart, guest of the Alex Jones show broadcasting worldwide. Thanks for your support on over 200 radio stations, TV stations and of course the internet at bayonet.video.
[2:20:25.640 --> 2:20:29.640]  David pointed out that the economic attack will kill a lot of people.
[2:20:29.640 --> 2:20:32.640]  Trump concurred with that. In fact, he talked about it a few days ago.
[2:20:32.640 --> 2:20:41.640]  It continues to mobilize every segment of our society to turn the tide in the battle against the virus.
[2:20:41.640 --> 2:20:46.640]  I want Americans to know that we will get through this challenge.
[2:20:46.640 --> 2:20:50.640]  The hardship will end. It will end soon.
[2:20:50.640 --> 2:20:54.640]  Normal life will return and our economy will rebound.
[2:20:54.640 --> 2:20:57.640]  We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.
[2:20:57.640 --> 2:21:00.640]  This is not a country that was built for this.
[2:21:00.640 --> 2:21:02.640]  It was not built to be shut down.
[2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:14.640]  At the end of the 15-day period, we'll make a decision as to which way we want to go, where we want to go, the timing, and essentially we're referring to the timing of the opening.
[2:21:14.640 --> 2:21:16.640]  Essentially the opening of our country.
[2:21:16.640 --> 2:21:20.640]  We have 160, almost 160 million jobs in this country now.
[2:21:20.640 --> 2:21:23.640]  The most ever, by far, by far the most ever.
[2:21:23.640 --> 2:21:26.640]  The number of jobs, almost 160 million.
[2:21:26.640 --> 2:21:30.640]  So we can't turn that off and think it's going to be wonderful.
[2:21:30.640 --> 2:21:32.640]  There will be tremendous repercussions.
[2:21:32.640 --> 2:21:35.640]  There will be tremendous death from that.
[2:21:35.640 --> 2:21:36.640]  Death.
[2:21:36.640 --> 2:21:38.640]  You know, you're talking about death.
[2:21:38.640 --> 2:21:44.640]  Probably more death from that than anything that we're talking about with respect to the virus.
[2:21:44.640 --> 2:21:45.640]  That's right.
[2:21:45.640 --> 2:21:50.640]  University of Chicago and others found between 6 and 8 million, I'd say 7 million, starved to death during the Great Depression.
[2:21:50.640 --> 2:21:52.640]  Same thing happened in Europe, Weimar, Germany.
[2:21:52.640 --> 2:21:54.640]  This is a shorter segment, long segment coming up.
[2:21:54.640 --> 2:21:57.640]  David, you're on fire today as usual.
[2:21:57.640 --> 2:22:01.640]  You were saying in the break, though, the good news is this is backfiring at some level.
[2:22:01.640 --> 2:22:05.640]  There's a huge awakening in that the globalists are having to accelerate because of desperation.
[2:22:05.640 --> 2:22:07.640]  Let's talk about some good news here.
[2:22:07.640 --> 2:22:09.640]  Yeah, just very quickly.
[2:22:09.640 --> 2:22:16.640]  I have problems with Donald Trump in relation to the blank check to Israel.
[2:22:16.640 --> 2:22:20.640]  But what he said there is absolutely right.
[2:22:20.640 --> 2:22:25.640]  I just hope he has the backbone to stick with it for the sake of the future of America here.
[2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:30.640]  Because the cure is going to be fatal.
[2:22:30.640 --> 2:22:32.640]  It already is fatal.
[2:22:32.640 --> 2:22:54.640]  And the idea that we destroy entire economies, the global economy, on the basis of a virus that the overwhelmingly vast, vast majority not only recover from, but have, quote, very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
[2:22:54.640 --> 2:23:08.640]  And by the way, when you start to look at the figures, it's very clear that more people have this virus and have had this virus than has ever come to light.
[2:23:08.640 --> 2:23:20.640]  We just had a study at Oxford University that reported this week that was talking about the fact that this virus came into Britain, not when it first seemed to appear.
[2:23:20.640 --> 2:23:25.640]  But at the latest in early January.
[2:23:25.640 --> 2:23:33.640]  Now, just two weeks before that point, I had every symptom of the coronavirus in December.
[2:23:33.640 --> 2:23:36.640]  Everyone, my son, Gareth, had everyone.
[2:23:36.640 --> 2:23:38.640]  By the way, everyone says that.
[2:23:38.640 --> 2:23:39.640]  Everyone says that.
[2:23:39.640 --> 2:23:45.640]  So when they, and it turns out, people did have it when they test people now, when the antibody test comes out, they're going to find that out.
[2:23:45.640 --> 2:23:50.640]  Yeah, the thing is that, I mean, I almost never get ill.
[2:23:50.640 --> 2:23:52.640]  That's why I remember it so well.
[2:23:52.640 --> 2:23:59.640]  Even New Yorker magazine says that the Oxford model shows that you're right, David, that your own government universities believe that's the case.
[2:23:59.640 --> 2:24:02.640]  Yeah, but the thing is that I never stopped working.
[2:24:02.640 --> 2:24:04.640]  It went very pleasant for a few days.
[2:24:04.640 --> 2:24:05.640]  I never stopped working.
[2:24:05.640 --> 2:24:08.640]  And my immune system sorted it out.
[2:24:08.640 --> 2:24:13.640]  No doctor necessary and certainly not a dismantling of the world economy necessary.
[2:24:13.640 --> 2:24:15.640]  But this is the point.
[2:24:15.640 --> 2:24:25.640]  As they're finding more and more people have actually had it or have recovered fine from it, some not even knowing they had it.
[2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:34.640]  The death ratio of people having it to people who die gets smaller and smaller and smaller.
[2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:43.640]  You know, they're saying that there's this anomaly in Germany, their death rate is so much smaller than anywhere else.
[2:24:43.640 --> 2:24:55.640]  Well, the thing is they are testing people and then they are more aware of the number of had it or the number of got it in mild form, which is what it is.
[2:24:55.640 --> 2:25:05.640]  The overwhelming amount of time and therefore because they see the numbers who have it, the ratio of people who died 0.5%.
[2:25:05.640 --> 2:25:09.640]  The last I saw in Germany and get smaller and smaller.
[2:25:09.640 --> 2:25:14.640]  So, you know, it's not that they say statistics never lie.
[2:25:14.640 --> 2:25:25.640]  But statistics don't tell you what the situation is. The people who compile the statistics tell you what the situation is.
[2:25:25.640 --> 2:25:27.640]  And it's the situation that they want.
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:28.640]  That's just like AI.
[2:25:28.640 --> 2:25:34.640]  They're always saying, oh, the great computer will decide when you live and when you die and how much food you get and what you go to school to be.
[2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:36.640]  But who programs it?
[2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:37.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:39.640]  Well, it's very simple.
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:44.640]  This is why Alex computer models are being used for this and why they're used for climate change.
[2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:48.640]  Like you said, by 2017, all ice caps were supposed to be melted and all the computer models.
[2:25:48.640 --> 2:25:52.640]  Horsemen are when we know they fall static in on purpose.
[2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:57.640]  Yeah, the point is with a computer model, it's ever so simple.
[2:25:57.640 --> 2:26:02.640]  If you want a result out, oh, look, this is what's going to happen.
[2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:09.640]  You make sure the data goes into the process that's going to come out with that result.
[2:26:09.640 --> 2:26:17.640]  And that's what they've done with the computer virus, with the appropriate in it, with the computer modeling for this virus.
[2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:20.640]  And that's what they're using to pressure even.
[2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:21.640]  No, but you're right.
[2:26:21.640 --> 2:26:22.640]  They're hyping up these.
[2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:23.640]  That's been proven.
[2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:24.640]  The death rate is lower and lower.
[2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:25.640]  The more people they find.
[2:26:25.640 --> 2:26:26.640]  So it is a computer virus.
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:28.640]  It is a made up hysteria virus.
[2:26:28.640 --> 2:26:31.640]  I mean, it's a real virus that kills people, but the hype is a computer virus.
[2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:40.640]  Yeah, I mean, let's not forget, in 2017, 2018, 45 million Americans got flu in that season.
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:41.640]  Sorry, worse than that.
[2:26:41.640 --> 2:26:43.640]  CDC said 80 million.
[2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:44.640]  I thought that was the number.
[2:26:44.640 --> 2:26:45.640]  We looked it up.
[2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:47.640]  80 million CDC Chicago Tribune.
[2:26:47.640 --> 2:26:50.640]  But the CDC deaths.
[2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:52.640]  80,000, 8,000, that's hard.
[2:26:52.640 --> 2:26:59.640]  Officially, between 60,000 and 80,000 in 2017, 2018, from flu.
[2:26:59.640 --> 2:27:02.640]  Now, did the economy shut down?
[2:27:02.640 --> 2:27:08.640]  Were we standing six feet apart from each other to buy by the, you know, the team?
[2:27:08.640 --> 2:27:15.640]  No, we weren't because that was not something that they wanted to happen at that time.
[2:27:15.640 --> 2:27:16.640]  Now they do.
[2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:22.640]  So basically the same situation is getting hyped out of all proportion.
[2:27:22.640 --> 2:27:29.640]  And unfortunately, vast numbers of people buy it because they get no other information
[2:27:29.640 --> 2:27:31.640]  outside of the mainstream.
[2:27:31.640 --> 2:27:36.640]  And they still look at mummy daddy state, even though they were lied to about 9 11.
[2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:39.640]  They were lied to about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[2:27:39.640 --> 2:27:42.640]  They've been lied to over and over and over again.
[2:27:42.640 --> 2:27:45.640]  And people say, oh, politicians, you can't trust them.
[2:27:45.640 --> 2:27:47.640]  Oh, the state, you can't trust it.
[2:27:47.640 --> 2:27:50.640]  And then they go ahead and do just that in a situation like this.
[2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:53.640]  But as you said, what is happening?
[2:27:53.640 --> 2:28:02.640]  You know, I said a long time ago, you know, this has got to get really bad before enough
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:07.640]  people wake up and see it because it's so easy to sell our conspiracy theory sometime
[2:28:07.640 --> 2:28:08.640]  over the rainbow.
[2:28:08.640 --> 2:28:09.640]  I don't know.
[2:28:09.640 --> 2:28:11.640]  This was a shorter segment, long segment.
[2:28:11.640 --> 2:28:14.640]  I want to get into this critical point of all these critical points.
[2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:16.640]  This is one of the paramount ones for me.
[2:28:16.640 --> 2:28:17.640]  So we'll go to break.
[2:28:17.640 --> 2:28:19.640]  Got a nice long 10 minute plus segment coming up.
[2:28:19.640 --> 2:28:24.640]  I want you to really get into the silver lining in this cloud and more David Ike.com.
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:25.640]  He has his new book, The Trigger.
[2:28:25.640 --> 2:28:27.640]  Find it at David Ike.com.
[2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:28.640]  Critical book.
[2:28:28.640 --> 2:28:29.640]  I read it.
[2:28:29.640 --> 2:28:30.640]  Amazing to understand this new trigger.
[2:28:30.640 --> 2:28:31.640]  You've got to understand the last big trigger.
[2:28:31.640 --> 2:28:33.640]  We'll talk about the next big triggers coming.
[2:28:33.640 --> 2:28:35.640]  I'll tell you what I think as well.
[2:28:35.640 --> 2:28:37.640]  There couldn't be a more important discussion.
[2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:41.640]  You got David Ike and Alex Jones together to the preeminent people out there fighting
[2:28:41.640 --> 2:28:45.640]  the globalist and you, the biggest audience out there of activists of erase color and
[2:28:45.640 --> 2:28:50.640]  greed who love justice and understand that there's a pro human future together.
[2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:51.640]  We'll be right back.
[2:28:51.640 --> 2:28:53.640]  Stay with us.
[2:28:53.640 --> 2:28:58.640]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:00.640]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[2:29:00.640 --> 2:29:02.640]  I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:02.640 --> 2:29:07.640]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[2:29:07.640 --> 2:29:08.640]  my life.
[2:29:08.640 --> 2:29:13.640]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:13.640 --> 2:29:18.640]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:21.640]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:26.640]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits
