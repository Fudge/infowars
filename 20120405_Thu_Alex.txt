[00:47.280 --> 00:53.160]  wars.com and prisonplanet.com is breaking this news of course if you go
[00:53.160 --> 00:58.140]  back over a year ago CBS broke that oh they were tracking some guns they
[00:58.140 --> 01:02.120]  allowed to be sold to criminals in gun shops they did that because they knew
[01:02.120 --> 01:07.560]  it was already coming out in local news in Arizona and Illinois and other
[01:07.560 --> 01:13.720]  areas as well as in Mexico that the federal government through eight
[01:13.720 --> 01:18.820]  agencies was shipping guns into Mexico into Honduras but also into Tampa
[01:18.820 --> 01:23.360]  Florida into Indianapolis Indiana and now we've learned all over the country
[01:23.360 --> 01:34.120]  and running hit teams of quote former US military now I told you all this six
[01:34.120 --> 01:39.280]  years ago with one whistleblower Selle Castile who was with the DEA and then
[01:39.280 --> 01:47.240]  retired famous DEA agent they tried to hire him six years ago to train former
[01:47.240 --> 01:52.120]  US military basically sheep dipped in with Los Zetas to try to take control of
[01:52.120 --> 01:56.080]  the Mexican drug market this is six years ago those interviews are there we
[01:56.080 --> 02:00.160]  can't interview Selle because he's still in prison few years after exposing that
[02:00.160 --> 02:05.640]  they set him up with some shotguns and said he was the illegal arms dealer
[02:05.640 --> 02:09.120]  himself just because he needed money and went and sold a few of his guns at the
[02:09.120 --> 02:13.440]  gun show legally show all of that happened but he's on record six years
[02:13.440 --> 02:21.280]  ago now it's in these different federal filings it's in the federal filings in
[02:21.280 --> 02:25.640]  Illinois and in Texas and the El Paso times in fact for when
[02:25.640 --> 02:35.240]  Henningson joins us 30 minutes well you guys just type in El Paso times drug
[02:35.240 --> 02:40.000]  cartels allowed to bring in tons of cocaine that'll come up and it came out
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.400]  in the federal court cases that yes they were given national security
[02:43.400 --> 02:47.320]  clearances and that's their defense is their really government agents and the
[02:47.320 --> 02:51.040]  feds come in and say yes they did work for us it's true basically drop the
[02:51.040 --> 02:57.440]  charges it's the same over and over again but now we have this headline more
[02:57.440 --> 03:05.760]  furious US soldiers trafficking arms drugs to DEA agents posing as Los
[03:05.760 --> 03:11.480]  Zetas and what happens is when this stuff gets exposed they go oh they're
[03:11.480 --> 03:17.360]  just former US soldiers and oh we were just posing as Los Zetas in a sting
[03:17.360 --> 03:20.440]  because it separately came out in some court cases so they're having to cover
[03:20.440 --> 03:27.360]  themselves the drug cartels there's six of them that are in Mexico but three
[03:27.360 --> 03:36.160]  big ones the the three big ones are run by the US military and then whenever
[03:36.160 --> 03:40.880]  low-level people don't pay their cut or the smaller cartels try to run the
[03:40.880 --> 03:44.960]  blockades there's wars and there's double crossing and stuff that goes on but
[03:44.960 --> 03:52.400]  here it is and that's coming up in 30 minutes yet there it is documents feds
[03:52.400 --> 03:55.920]  allegedly you can go to the trial later it came out they did allowed to send a
[03:55.920 --> 03:59.640]  low-level cartel to move cocaine of the US for information now when they get
[03:59.640 --> 04:03.400]  caught they say yeah we were shipping in 18 wheelers of cocaine and tell them
[04:03.400 --> 04:09.200]  the border patrol to let it in but but we did it to get information about the
[04:09.200 --> 04:14.320]  drug cartels that one shipment was what five tons and then my little memory goes
[04:14.320 --> 04:17.960]  back many years to the associated press when the state police found an 18
[04:17.960 --> 04:21.320]  wheeler with three and a half tons of pure cocaine in it and were ordered to
[04:21.320 --> 04:25.120]  give it to the FBI and they released it you can go on down the road now Bubba
[04:25.120 --> 04:31.640]  Jack because that's going to pay off the federal judges and everybody that's how
[04:31.640 --> 04:37.000]  all this works people are like well wire drugs illegal then to keep the price
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.720]  silly you got to make it illegal if you're drug dealing murdering central
[04:43.720 --> 04:47.760]  banks that run child kidnapping rings on the side and then Mitt Romney's wife's
[04:47.760 --> 04:51.160]  got a blind trust invested in it everybody makes it a big deal that
[04:51.160 --> 04:55.600]  she's invested in Goldman Sachs I'm not saying she's perfect the point is why

[06:59.240 --> 07:04.840]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[07:04.840 --> 07:08.600]  pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[07:08.600 --> 07:12.680]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[07:12.680 --> 07:16.160]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[07:16.160 --> 07:20.840]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[08:19.680 --> 08:35.800]  Alex Jones
[08:35.800 --> 08:41.480]  the clarity of our research is really coming together minute by minute hour by
[08:41.480 --> 08:48.840]  hour day by day week by week month by month year by year our analysis has been
[08:48.840 --> 08:56.160]  100% spot on unfortunately on just how tyrannical this takeover is and the fact
[08:56.160 --> 09:01.920]  that once the cashless society is in place the system is going to raise taxes
[09:01.920 --> 09:10.560]  by design on record at every level to selectively destroy families businesses
[09:10.560 --> 09:18.240]  independent corporations and all of the mega insider agenda 21 crux Goldman
[09:18.240 --> 09:25.280]  sacks JP Morgan the rest of them they are all 100% exempt from even legal and
[09:25.280 --> 09:30.280]  lawful laws and all the other red tape regulations and color of law that they're
[09:30.280 --> 09:37.800]  engaged in. Homeland security for the TSA and Viper teams is buying massive
[09:37.800 --> 09:46.160]  amounts of armored mobile checkpoint bulletproof booths to be shut up on
[09:46.160 --> 09:53.120]  highway checkpoints the IRS is trying to get federal legislation passed where if
[09:53.120 --> 09:58.240]  you are even being questioned or audited by the IRS you are not allowed to leave
[09:58.240 --> 10:06.640]  the United States. I saw 10 years ago Homeland Security before it even had
[10:06.640 --> 10:11.680]  congressional cabinet power meeting and saying we're gonna have highway
[10:11.680 --> 10:16.400]  checkpoints we're gonna have DNA databases you're gonna have to have
[10:16.400 --> 10:20.640]  Homeland Security approval to travel state-to-state we're gonna have
[10:20.640 --> 10:26.520]  checkpoints out made outside major cities and on highways and if you haven't
[10:26.520 --> 10:33.120]  paid all the taxes including local your car is not going to start and now all
[10:33.120 --> 10:37.200]  those systems are going in the cars where oh you don't pay your bill we turn
[10:37.200 --> 10:40.960]  your car off but now they're saying oh we're gonna use the kill switches your
[10:40.960 --> 10:45.560]  cell phone will be turned off your car and you're and and you will not be
[10:45.560 --> 10:50.800]  allowed to have a job your bosses will be told you are fired so it's an extra
[10:50.800 --> 10:58.960]  judicial immediate probation and freeze on being able to move and it's all being
[10:58.960 --> 11:03.160]  phased in face scanning cameras everywhere now remember this is being done
[11:03.160 --> 11:07.360]  by the narcotics trafficking murdering child molesting child kidnapping
[11:07.360 --> 11:14.160]  criminals that run this country here's the Daily Mail a few days ago Mitt Romney's
[11:14.160 --> 11:19.240]  wife had blind trust invested in Goldman Sachs sex trafficking fund and they go
[11:19.240 --> 11:23.040]  well it's okay it's a blind trust that that's a red herring it's not even about
[11:23.040 --> 11:28.040]  her I can buy that she's in a blind trust because she's political most of them
[11:28.040 --> 11:31.200]  are and so there's not complex of interest in their invested in Goldman
[11:31.200 --> 11:33.680]  Sachs because they're the insiders they're the ones that always have the big
[11:33.680 --> 11:40.920]  profits it's not about her it's about how hiding in plain view why does Goldman
[11:40.920 --> 11:48.520]  Sachs have a sex trafficking fund here's a Reuters and Romney's trust invested in
[11:48.520 --> 11:54.920]  fund that control the sex site firm here's another one and Romney's trust
[11:54.920 --> 12:02.200]  invested in Goldman Sachs fund that was involved in the sex site back page dot
[12:02.200 --> 12:08.880]  com which is connected to in the reports sex trafficking sex slaves underage all
[12:08.880 --> 12:14.680]  this stuff this whole seedy underworld that's not the issue why is Goldman Sachs
[12:14.680 --> 12:20.480]  involved in this why is Dinecore involved in this why is Halliburton on
[12:20.480 --> 12:24.360]  record because they do whatever they want and they're getting rid of our
[12:24.360 --> 12:27.840]  Bill of Rights and Constitution they're announcing that they're illegally spying
[12:27.840 --> 12:33.760]  on us they are through groups like MF global stealing billions of dollars and
[12:33.760 --> 12:41.480]  lying and being caught and not getting in trouble we are in grave danger that's
[12:41.480 --> 12:45.640]  why Forbes had the headline a few months ago why is there a war on lemonade
[12:45.640 --> 12:50.680]  stands and they reported on thousands of raids in every city under federal
[12:50.680 --> 12:58.640]  control of little kids selling lemonade learning about the free market 15
[12:58.640 --> 13:02.920]  million dollar fines for garage sales with local federal enforcers that's
[13:02.920 --> 13:09.720]  Fox news I know you think I'm joking look it up 15 million dollar that's the
[13:09.720 --> 13:14.600]  third offense $10,000 first offense if any of the products you're selling out
[13:14.600 --> 13:19.720]  of thousands of recalled items a year if you are selling an item that was ever
[13:19.720 --> 13:26.160]  recalled for whatever reason as if you know some refrigerator toy a light bulb
[13:26.160 --> 13:32.000]  it's total bureaucratic hell we've got a report that's gonna air tomorrow night
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.400]  that they've been going out three days straight interviewing the Austinites
[13:35.400 --> 13:39.360]  around the tens of thousands of acres that were taken from private landowners
[13:39.360 --> 13:43.160]  at gunpoint you were forced to sell for pennies on the dollar back in the late
[13:43.160 --> 13:48.480]  80s and 90s with most the land five years later to ten years later they flip
[13:48.480 --> 13:52.360]  it and give it to select insiders for pennies on the dollar to build hotels
[13:52.360 --> 13:56.960]  salons golf courses luxury home developments they should want to pay
[13:56.960 --> 14:01.120]  for the land so they just said imminent domain for the earth five ten cents on
[14:01.120 --> 14:06.120]  the dollar max there were SWAT teams sent out farmers drug off I interviewed
[14:06.120 --> 14:10.560]  them celebrations of evil by the fake environmentalist now they've got you in

[14:21.000 --> 14:24.520]  footage of people in their kitchens looking out with cameras facing out
[14:24.520 --> 14:29.440]  humans are arrested and charged if they're caught by the way my reporters
[14:29.440 --> 14:35.440]  did enter the the the the preserve because again they don't want you they
[14:35.440 --> 14:38.840]  promised everybody it's gonna be park lands let us steal it and a lot of
[14:38.840 --> 14:43.280]  Austinites went take the land we want to use it as more green belt and of course
[14:43.280 --> 14:46.000]  I knew in other parts of the world in the u.s. they would always take it and
[14:46.000 --> 14:52.400]  keep it and we interview former head County judge Bill Elshar who was a good
[14:52.400 --> 14:55.760]  guy to pose the federal takeover I didn't even know he lives up against one
[14:55.760 --> 15:01.000]  of these with cameras aimed at his house but he's retired now that a full head of
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.040]  gray hair it's a black hair I didn't see him about 12 years the guys when I
[15:04.040 --> 15:09.840]  interviewed him yesterday very powerful interview and it is agenda 21 and the
[15:09.840 --> 15:15.920]  newspaper the Austin American statesman said even worse recklessly people have
[15:15.920 --> 15:24.480]  walked humans into the preserve and when and when it grew into people's back
[15:24.480 --> 15:28.200]  yards because the government took an easement of their backyards the cedar
[15:28.200 --> 15:32.680]  trees that grow like weeds they're from Europe they push out the oak and

[24:23.480 --> 24:28.800]  telling the public that they're gonna take over every facet of our lives to
[24:28.800 --> 24:34.160]  protect us but as history shows as our founding fathers warned his common
[24:34.160 --> 24:39.000]  sense shows the greatest danger is a big government and we've got the biggest
[24:39.000 --> 24:42.960]  government that's ever existed the most out-of-control government that's ever
[24:42.960 --> 24:52.000]  existed and this is their plan this is what they're doing I told you the
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.920]  entire time this is about internal checkpoints and stopping people who

[25:40.960 --> 25:45.120]  to take over so they're gonna make it illegal to cut down your own trees to
[25:45.120 --> 25:48.720]  use them as firewood as a wood burning stove they're trying to ban space
[25:48.720 --> 25:52.120]  heaters they're trying to ban outdoor heaters this is a good go look it up

[26:23.560 --> 26:29.200]  Constitution and as they use America's money and ingenuity and energy to launch
[26:29.200 --> 26:33.800]  wars against innocent countries using Al Qaeda now in six different countries to
[26:33.800 --> 26:37.480]  try to overthrow the government and then say give your rights up because Al
[26:37.480 --> 26:45.920]  Qaeda wants to attack on record the magnitude of this article CBS News a
[26:45.920 --> 26:51.400]  bill authored by Southland lawmaker could potentially allow the federal

[34:14.200 --> 34:19.640]  al-Qaeda will get you and hire a bunch of low-grade morons at every level of
[34:19.640 --> 34:27.720]  bureaucracy who will trample everyone's rights including their own I mean look at
[34:27.720 --> 34:32.880]  this headline this is so scary by Paul Watson and he has links to the press
[34:32.880 --> 34:38.480]  released by the Homeland Security Department after huge ammo by Department
[34:38.480 --> 34:44.440]  of Homeland Security purchases bullet resistant booths federal agency preparing
[34:44.440 --> 34:48.600]  to unveil more checkpoints and they've announced that they have tripled the
[34:48.600 --> 34:53.800]  funding for the Viper teams to be on highways and our training local police
[34:53.800 --> 35:03.800]  to man the mobile armored checkpoints and what happens is you pull up and under
[35:03.800 --> 35:09.760]  the Transportation Department they have people there and they come over with
[35:09.760 --> 35:14.000]  their drug dogs their bomb dogs bug their eyes out at you act like you know
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.480]  they're on the front lines of Afghanistan and yes they're starting I have
[35:18.480 --> 35:22.840]  video on newscast groping people on the side of the road and at bus stations and
[35:22.840 --> 35:27.040]  train stations from Texas to Florida from California to Michigan I've got the
[35:27.040 --> 35:31.680]  newscast just just type in TSA at bus station and it'll show them groping
[35:31.680 --> 35:36.280]  little kids even pulling their shirts off and look it's not happening to me
[35:36.280 --> 35:44.160]  you filthy scum okay you work for murdering child kidnapping criminals
[35:44.160 --> 35:49.320]  there it is Mitt Romney's wife had blind trust invested in Goldman Sachs sex
[35:49.320 --> 35:55.320]  trafficking fund and again my issue is why do they have a sex trafficking fund
[35:55.320 --> 36:01.880]  well I mean why not Dinecore runs child operations and then they run domestically
[36:01.880 --> 36:07.280]  they're the biggest private contractor for CPS with fake family court power with
[36:07.280 --> 36:12.800]  police backing them it's it's Dinecore operatives grabbing your children but
[36:12.800 --> 36:17.880]  it's all done officially and it's come out that there's a bounty on what type of
[36:17.880 --> 36:21.320]  kids they want and the state senator in Georgia announced he was going to release
[36:21.320 --> 36:25.440]  how they had a bounty on kids and he got her head blown off over the weekend
[36:25.440 --> 36:30.480]  before she could make the announcement we'd interviewed her oh but her and her
[36:30.480 --> 36:36.000]  husband when the police said both committed suicide she's like Monday I'm
[36:36.000 --> 36:44.360]  coming out I got the proof she was even you know contacting the media and all of
[36:44.360 --> 36:49.280]  this was going on and then her and her husband got a couple bullets in their
[36:49.280 --> 36:59.520]  schnoggins nice people run things you're really nice people well of course
[36:59.520 --> 37:05.600]  they kidnapped kids they see us all as meat as as as as cattle as lower than
[37:05.600 --> 37:12.200]  cattle but I know a lot of you aren't gonna listen now you're only gonna
[37:12.200 --> 37:18.040]  listen later I understand that it's too scary to admit this is going on so
[37:18.040 --> 37:24.640]  you're gonna just say this isn't true this isn't going on this can't be real
[37:27.320 --> 37:32.120]  just like I told you a couple weeks ago that NBC tape where they were claiming
[37:32.120 --> 37:35.960]  Zimmerman was saying racist stuff sounded edited they now admit they edited it
[37:35.960 --> 37:40.080]  and it's all made up but it's no big deal that just the government mouthpiece
[37:40.080 --> 37:44.680]  MSNBC is trying to start a race war it's no big deal and now seeing an end's been
[37:44.680 --> 37:49.040]  caught altering the tape because it's criminal government policy to get us
[37:49.040 --> 37:52.000]  fighting with each other so they can be the referee and play the part of the
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.720]  savior when they are the narcotics trafficking child kidnapping cancer
[37:56.720 --> 38:03.840]  injecting murdering criminals that make Hitler look like a choir boy they don't
[38:03.840 --> 38:07.680]  dress up in a military dictator outfit like a clown like Hitler the global is
[38:07.680 --> 38:13.680]  sit there like loving liberals and give you a loving cancer shot the patchouli
[38:13.680 --> 38:20.360]  oil all of it is the cover for their mass murder it's hardcore camo it's
[38:20.360 --> 38:25.200]  camo-flage who these people really are in public Margaret singers like I love
[38:25.200 --> 38:30.440]  blacks by the scenes we gotta murder these people now we're gonna pose this
[38:30.440 --> 38:35.160]  liberal will get them and they do get you the liberal TV's like oh we care
[38:35.160 --> 38:40.400]  about you about sharp to the whitey the whitey have some more abortions and we're
[38:40.400 --> 38:52.520]  gonna put more of you in prison here watch some violent hip-hop this is how
[38:52.520 --> 39:00.120]  the new world order rolls that's how they divide and conquer 83 year old woman
[39:00.120 --> 39:07.040]  denied health care over carbon footprint it's beginning it's beginning no
[39:07.040 --> 39:11.240]  health care for you you're too old and you're traveling too far but the elite
[39:11.240 --> 39:15.160]  are gonna fly around on jet airplanes everywhere see the new economy is the
[39:15.160 --> 39:19.400]  shutdown of the economy the new economy is the police state the new economy is
[39:19.400 --> 39:23.280]  the cannibalistic economy the post-industrial implode economy it's
[39:23.280 --> 39:28.720]  all in the club of Rome it's all in iron mountain it's all in tragedy and
[39:28.720 --> 39:35.480]  hope George Arwell real name Eric Blair who worked as an imperial policeman in
[39:35.480 --> 39:44.840]  India from a wealthy elitist family then got disillusioned and went to work for
[39:44.840 --> 39:49.160]  the communist fighting Hitler pre-World War two in the Spanish Civil War and
[39:49.160 --> 39:54.200]  found out they were just as bad and actually working with other corrupt
[39:54.200 --> 39:57.880]  elements then he went became homeless to experience that for a few years and
[39:57.880 --> 40:03.880]  then he wrote 1984 and and he he's himself as he was a propagandist in
[40:03.880 --> 40:08.280]  World War two at BBC I forgot that part the evidence shows probably in my five
[40:08.280 --> 40:15.280]  definitely connected to it and he writes about Winston himself as a gnome to
[40:15.280 --> 40:22.200]  gear gnome to plume Winston in this fictitious 1984 because before he'd
[40:22.200 --> 40:26.440]  written nonfiction books but they wouldn't publish his book about where he
[40:26.440 --> 40:32.800]  saw Europe and the world in England going under communism and how bad it was
[40:32.800 --> 40:37.000]  and in the film the government he finds out has a deal with the other
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.680]  government he thinks it's probably the same government to rocket attack each
[40:40.680 --> 40:44.080]  other because then the government can take the public's liberties and he
[40:44.080 --> 40:48.360]  figures out they blow up their own buildings to claim its terrorist so
[40:48.360 --> 40:53.680]  they have an excuse to arrest people and he finds out it's a war against
[40:53.680 --> 40:57.920]  humanity and they have gladiatorial games as well and everybody's obsessed
[40:57.920 --> 41:02.920]  with the lottery mega millions because that's real folks that's what they
[41:02.920 --> 41:09.640]  really want that's what they're really doing now joining us is Patrick
[41:09.640 --> 41:15.440]  Hinnickson an info wars calm investigative journalist and he's been
[41:15.440 --> 41:21.800]  out in Arizona investigating fast and furious more furious is the headline

[42:02.880 --> 42:06.080]  set us what I tell you six years ago with our sources there was gonna be a
[42:06.080 --> 42:10.640]  man or seven years ago now a massive implosion in Mexico as they knocked out
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.680]  the other small cartels that aren't controlled by JP Morgan Goldman Sachs
[42:14.680 --> 42:19.400]  Wells Fargo Waco via which by the way it's come out now hundreds of billions
[42:19.400 --> 42:24.520]  laundered by Wells Fargo didn't get in trouble Bloomberg AP Reuters again this
[42:24.520 --> 42:29.760]  is how they operate just like Goldman Sachs sex trafficking you in sex
[42:29.760 --> 42:34.920]  trafficking well they have diplomatic diplomatic community so it's okay and if
[42:34.920 --> 42:38.680]  you scroll down on the article you can see three of the gentlemen who were
[42:38.680 --> 42:43.640]  reportedly hit men with the US military what have I told you over and over again
[42:43.640 --> 42:50.360]  it's mainly army there are tens of thousands of wet work hit men and it's
[42:50.360 --> 42:56.320]  not the Mexican mafia it's not any of these groups it's US army then some
[42:56.320 --> 43:00.920]  Marines then some Navy SEALs they busted Navy SEALs trying to ship hand grenades
[43:00.920 --> 43:05.880]  rocket launchers and weapons out of Phoenix down there turned out they were
[43:05.880 --> 43:10.120]  working for the government there's a covert war and that's a message to you
[43:10.120 --> 43:14.000]  if you work for the US government which means Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and you're
[43:14.000 --> 43:19.760]  caught they're just going to say you're a drug dealer okay now all this has come
[43:19.760 --> 43:23.680]  out in court when they bust Los Zettis when they bust Santa Loa shipping in

[45:28.320 --> 45:31.320]  economic hitman coming up in the third hour right now is Patrick Henningson
[45:31.320 --> 45:35.120]  joining us for this big breaking news with links to the federal court rulings
[45:35.120 --> 45:38.560]  and even little blurbs and mainstream media Patrick Henningson incredible
[45:38.560 --> 45:42.760]  information we already knew it but here it is in plain view as we learn the
[45:42.760 --> 45:46.600]  government's arming the drug gangs domestically military hit teams
[45:46.600 --> 45:54.240]  everywhere mass waters sex trafficking just pure evil 110% break it down for
[45:54.240 --> 45:59.080]  us this this whole story when I first stumbled across this a few days ago
[45:59.080 --> 46:04.760]  it's like a rabbit hole it's like a supermarket crime novel only that it's
[46:04.760 --> 46:08.960]  actually happening it's the most incredible thing about it so what you've
[46:08.960 --> 46:17.800]  got here is a freelance hit squad made up of active duty US Army and a couple of
[46:17.800 --> 46:24.400]  his close relations and this is between South Carolina and Texas okay and this
[46:24.400 --> 46:29.800]  guy isn't a member of just any army brigade it turns out he's a member of
[46:29.800 --> 46:34.800]  the fourth brigade of the fourth infantry group so he's a member of the
[46:34.800 --> 46:40.800]  fourth brigade combat team of the fourth infant infantry division okay and
[46:40.800 --> 46:49.080]  they're doing three year three year cycles together as a unit and you know
[46:49.080 --> 46:53.280]  we all know about the opium problem in Afghanistan you've covered it really
[46:53.280 --> 46:59.120]  well in fact but between Kurt Nemo and myself it's really hard to find any
[46:59.120 --> 47:04.440]  really comprehensive writing on this subject in the last two years so I've
[47:04.440 --> 47:08.440]  linked to some of Kurt Nemo's research on this because frankly there's no no one
[47:08.440 --> 47:12.760]  really wants to talk about it very much aside from info wars calm and a few
[47:12.760 --> 47:19.000]  other outlets but we all know about the opium now this guy Kevin Corley arranged
[47:19.000 --> 47:26.040]  a 500 pound marijuana shipment which the DEA apparently picked up early in
[47:26.040 --> 47:29.640]  the sting they didn't in they didn't arrest these guys they let them drive
[47:29.640 --> 47:34.440]  forward they caught the truck behind them with 500 pounds of marijuana okay
[47:34.440 --> 47:40.240]  500 pounds of marijuana okay what where the flag went up in for me is and I can't
[47:40.240 --> 47:45.000]  obviously prove this but certainly we have links with Afghanistan guess who
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.160]  the number one marijuana producing country in the world today is take a wild
[47:50.160 --> 48:02.920]  guess it's Afghanistan it's not Mexico it's not Jamaica it's Afghanistan so and
[48:02.920 --> 48:07.920]  of course it wasn't until the liberation happened and it was only 10% of opium
[48:07.920 --> 48:14.680]  now it's 92% or more of the opium and the troops admit they grow it yeah and
[48:14.680 --> 48:20.200]  you know you've got some big Air Force a military Air Force and army and marine
[48:20.200 --> 48:24.760]  bases all dotted all over the country and we all know from Vietnam that the
[48:24.760 --> 48:31.240]  longer we stayed in there when Vietnam for between 10 and 12 years and that
[48:31.240 --> 48:37.840]  allowed people to make links to form relationships for certain cadres within
[48:37.840 --> 48:42.440]  the military to arrange their own kind of entrepreneurial activities okay and
[48:42.440 --> 48:46.480]  that that that's not out of the realms of possibility in this particular
[48:46.480 --> 48:52.480]  situation did this 500 pounds of pot come from Mexico or did it come from
[48:52.480 --> 48:58.160]  Arizona to say Fort Bliss or a place like this I can't say for sure but I've
[48:58.160 --> 49:02.520]  laid this all out Alex because I think hopefully someone else is going to come
[49:02.520 --> 49:07.440]  along and put the dots together I'm limited in what I can find out as far
[49:07.440 --> 49:11.880]  as this is exactly the intel we get from these other federal cases where they
[49:11.880 --> 49:18.560]  let Los Zeta's and Sinaloa ship cocaine in quote for information sure I mean the
[49:18.560 --> 49:24.280]  the I did an article a couple years ago which was called rendition where the war
[49:24.280 --> 49:29.600]  on drugs meets the war on terror and that was really centered around that
[49:29.600 --> 49:36.040]  whole story of the CIA rendition flight was a Gulfstream jet which crashed in
[49:36.040 --> 49:40.640]  Mexico and had something like three tons of pure Colombian uncut cocaine on
[49:40.640 --> 49:45.720]  board yeah three and a half times yeah and and so they matched the tail
[49:45.720 --> 49:53.120]  numbers from this Gulfstream jet with the private air contractor to rendition
[49:53.120 --> 49:57.560]  flights that were going everywhere on the planet we're talking about black
[49:57.560 --> 50:02.680]  sites in Eastern Europe refueling in England and Ireland the government
[50:02.680 --> 50:06.720]  aircraft just land everywhere with the cocaine heroin little kids and it all
[50:06.720 --> 50:11.240]  comes out just type in UN child sex trafficking because sometimes there are
[50:11.240 --> 50:14.840]  good people that blow the whistle when there's huge C-130s with toddlers being
[50:14.840 --> 50:18.480]  loaded on and and there's always somebody who freaks out they usually whack
[50:18.480 --> 50:23.040]  them real quick so I mean it's just absolute pure evil that's what the war
[50:23.040 --> 50:28.200]  on terror was in the in the early stages of the war on terror where they were
[50:28.200 --> 50:33.760]  rendering the media made a big deal and the liberal the liberal kind of outcry
[50:33.760 --> 50:38.200]  was oh there they're taking all these terrorists on and putting black sacks
[50:38.200 --> 50:41.880]  over their heads and trying to ferry them around the world but it wasn't the
[50:41.880 --> 50:45.120]  terrorists that they were faring around they're just goat herders and taxi
[50:45.120 --> 50:49.680]  drivers there were drugs kids and God knows what on board any of those right
[50:49.680 --> 50:53.400]  stay there the guy that wrote jobbreaker I had the CIA section chief on he
[50:53.400 --> 50:58.200]  admitted they would only grab innocent people and literally it was just a
[50:58.200 --> 51:03.120]  prop to ship the drugs I'd seen the ungevity products work for many others
[51:03.120 --> 51:06.560]  and so I bought a bunch of them started using them had a little bit of results

[56:52.280 --> 56:57.800]  about 20 minutes in the next hour continue with this report because I mean
[56:57.800 --> 57:01.080]  break down what's happened how this came to light briefly then let's come back
[57:01.080 --> 57:05.560]  again into more the latest developments on Fast and Furious this this
[57:05.560 --> 57:11.800]  particular federal complaint was just put online a couple of days ago and quite
[57:11.800 --> 57:17.080]  a few blogs and so forth jumped on it now this is a really fascinating story
[57:17.080 --> 57:23.040]  you've got obviously a couple of active duty US military now something strange
[57:23.040 --> 57:28.520]  happened there were due to be redeployed to Afghanistan in February and Kevin
[57:28.520 --> 57:34.800]  Corley who was the one of the leaders of this gang was discharged from Fort
[57:34.800 --> 57:42.520]  Carson which is where the which is where the fourth brigade is stationed now
[57:42.520 --> 57:48.280]  there's no details of to why he was discharged okay there's also another
[57:48.280 --> 57:54.240]  question which looms here is that you know when you lose a 500 pound consignment
[57:54.240 --> 57:59.000]  of narcotics and you just hand it over to the DEA and they let you drive along
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.840]  why they take the truck and then he's got he's gone back to the guys who were
[58:03.840 --> 58:10.120]  posing as Los Adas these undercover DEA agents to do more business soon after
[58:10.120 --> 58:15.320]  that so it's almost like there was no big deal we lost 500 pounds a pot so it
[58:15.320 --> 58:19.080]  makes you wonder was there an endless supply of drugs here well that's what
[58:19.080 --> 58:22.240]  happens when one hand doesn't know what the other hand is happening but they
[58:22.240 --> 58:26.000]  were able to give the code words they let him go and again the feds are saying
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.600]  these guys were involved in wet work murder for higher services narcotics
[58:29.600 --> 58:33.360]  trafficking and stolen US military weapons well what do you think your bosses
[58:33.360 --> 58:37.440]  in the federal government are involved in blowing up Oklahoma City blowing up
[58:37.440 --> 58:51.440]  9-eleven this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network I had
[58:51.440 --> 58:55.200]  tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was lifting
[58:55.200 --> 58:59.600]  weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally starving
[58:59.600 --> 59:03.680]  for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had
[59:03.680 --> 59:08.280]  that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be
[59:08.280 --> 59:12.680]  satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at infowarstein.com but
[59:12.680 --> 59:19.360]  I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two
[59:19.360 --> 59:25.280]  months products like beyond Tangy tangerine pollen burst and rebound when

[59:29.080 --> 59:34.160]  than 37 pounds in just two months now that's results I want to challenge my
[59:34.160 --> 59:39.800]  listeners to go to infowarstein.com and order just three of their products and
[59:39.800 --> 59:44.440]  you will see the changes in the way you look feel and in your appetite almost

[59:51.560 --> 01:00:00.560]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.360]  Alex Jones
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.400]  all right going back to investigative journalist for infowarstein.com
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:34.700]  Patrick Hinnickson who has been traveling the US investigating government
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:41.080]  drug dealing our soldiers publicly have to guard and even help plant and get
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:46.000]  fertilizer to the Afghans to grow the opium it's it's it's up almost ten fold
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.560]  the production level from 10% to 92% is the average number that's what the
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.840]  federal government predicts or estimates trick well that's their
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.480]  projection I should say according to MSNBC is 92% it could be higher
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:03.080]  flooding the world with it and now they just hide it in plain view and then I've
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.800]  been told by military personnel and others that indeed the US military is
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.480]  all over the border we've seen cases of war marines you know shoot some innocent
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:17.800]  US citizen it was hurting sheep down in South Texas this stuff happens but you've
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:22.800]  got these guys who are active duty running around and and and and now the
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:27.680]  feds have actually grabbed them though do we know why this is happening I think
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.960]  we can only guess at this point but I'm telling you this this is a very bizarre
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:37.800]  operation to say the least so I predict there's gonna be a lot of stuff that's
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.760]  gonna be on earth over the next few weeks or the next few months about this
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:46.440]  thing but you know though the bigger picture here Alex is that you know the
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:51.240]  mainstream media and and our our politicians in Washington have have
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:57.960]  really made such a meal out of the whole the whole thing of talking about the
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:04.360]  economy in terms of the stock market and in terms of you know derivatives and
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:09.840]  this and that the real liquidity Alex and this is Catherine Austin Fitz who's
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.680]  on your show many times she pointed this out the real liquidity the real cash
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:20.160]  that propped up the banking sector in terms of Citibank for one is is black
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.720]  market cash and this is they're always underestimating the size of the black
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.840]  market playing it down you know and you don't hear about it very much in the
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.840]  news the real statistics why because you can't calculate the size of the black
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.720]  market because it's not audited okay but this black market is one of the most
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:46.360]  important aspects of how the kind of you know this slimy the slimy elements of
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:52.160]  the globalist cabal do their business right they control it and instead of
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.840]  cracking down on their narcotics and child kidnapping they're gonna go after
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:00.160]  the Amish and people selling pecans they want that gone if you look at it if you
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:05.760]  look at the global economy in terms of let's call a pyramid okay the the
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:11.520]  military industrial complex and the big fortune 500 corporations they'll form
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:17.200]  the base of this pyramid okay then you know the the amount of money and on paper
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:22.240]  is it's much bigger than the black market but at the top of this pyramid is a
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:27.960]  little black capstone okay this is the black market and I I contend that
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:33.640]  whoever controls the black capstone of this economic pyramid can control the
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:38.240]  whole period I agree because that money is worth a hundred times because it is
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.960]  black it is secret and they and it's what's used to bribe people and then
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:49.280]  blackmail them with with the black money the black market is really it's the
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:57.520]  WD 40 grease that turns the wheels of power with the shadow government and also
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:02.640]  you know any kind of nefarious organizations the world over this is
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:07.080]  the grease that turns the machine without this you cannot pay off judges you
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:12.640]  cannot buy by silence you cannot buy loyalty decriminalize the drugs it is
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.360]  overnight it'll rise up like a cold sore and that's why top drug dealers are on
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.720]  records saying I love the drug war never get rid of it yeah it went in terms of
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:30.840]  drugs child prostitution human trafficking vice activity you have all
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.120]  kind of vests invested interest around the world that's why Ron Paul is so
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.640]  dangerous to the establishment one of the reasons is he wants to legalize
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.080]  drugs okay or decriminalize drugs and again that takes all the criminal
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:46.200]  element and the money out and now poor drug heads I'll be you know doing it at
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.600]  home under supervision instead of robbing you to go buy the overpriced drugs so
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.960]  the big bankers get that money then they also put them in the private
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.000]  prisons owned by the drug dealers we'll be right back

[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:13.640]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:17.640]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:22.520]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:26.880]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best

[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:13.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:23.400]  we're talking about the phony drug war with investigative journalist from info
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.840]  wars dot com Patrick Henningson we're working on getting Lord Moncton on
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:32.400]  dealing with the environmental power grabs going on by the green cultists
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:36.720]  who are trying to seize power and are trying to censor our videos and others
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:41.160]  really incredible developments on that front but here's an article out of the
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:45.200]  Huffington Post lawmakers in five states tell feds to back off medical
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.600]  marijuana remember Obama promised that he was going to follow the 10th Amendment
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.280]  for states rights and that he was going to back off medical marijuana that was
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:57.480]  prescribed by doctors which they admit of all the plants out there that you can
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.160]  get drugs from that help people there's nothing like marijuana and I'm not even
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:06.600]  a pot smoker I mean I've I've smoked it I've tried it here and there every time
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.840]  I get talked into doing and I'm like why did I do this it just doesn't float my
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:17.040]  boat but but regardless of that lawmakers in five states tell feds to
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:22.600]  back off medical marijuana the point is when you make this stuff illegal it
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:27.160]  drives up the price it allows government behind the scenes of selectively
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.840]  enforced it corrupts the police just like alcohol prohibition did for the
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:34.560]  decade or nine and a half years that they had it in place and when that ended
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.360]  they made drugs illegal you could buy cocaine heroin at the corner drug store
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:43.880]  and much smaller numbers of people used it or took it you think I'm joking by
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.360]  six packs of Coca-Cola that you know had a massive amount of cocaine it's what's
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:54.480]  called coke so go look it up it's hiding in plain view they've done this to take
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:59.120]  over our society and Patrick Henningson was talking about the black capstone over
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.400]  the larger economy of the black market controlled by the big mega banks who
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.440]  launder the money so when they come in with this cashless society they're
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.800]  going to use it to crack down on the Amish and people selling peaches on the
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:13.440]  side of the road and lemonade stands and Girl Scout cookies as they've now done
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:19.160]  they don't want any of that but the real black market it will continue on
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:23.000]  Patrick Henningson I want to ask you about this you know Obama said he wouldn't
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.360]  hire lobbyist hired more than anybody else so he wouldn't torture expanded it
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.960]  wouldn't have wars expanded it he said he'd have the most open government most
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.920]  closed government he'd honor whistleblowers and journalists he's
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:38.320]  arresting them in mass you know in DAA all of it what do you make of this whole
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.840]  black market and where all this is going please continue to give us your take
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.560]  on this well firstly let's just comment on Obama I just wrote an article for
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:51.440]  info wars I think two days ago called rise of the petty dictator and what I
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:56.480]  did is kind of outlined you know Obama who just a few days ago called the
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:01.160]  Supreme Court a unelected group of people and then a kind of listed all
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.880]  his executive orders if he if he is elected in a second term he will
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:11.920]  actually surpass surpass George Bush's amount of executive orders I mean it's
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:14.960]  it's record breaking and I want to interrupt you because I'm glad you know
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:18.760]  I'm so conditioned to live in this tyranny I know their tyrants I know
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.480]  they're building FEMA camps I know they're getting ready to set up check
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:25.480]  points everywhere and now announcing it so as it happens now I don't even make a
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:29.400]  big deal out of things that I used to it's actually working on me I'm I'm
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:34.320]  weakening and so I'm announcing that publicly so that we can all understand
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:38.840]  it's happening to us and resist it and redouble our efforts but I forgot he came
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:42.240]  out and said all they're just unelected they're nobody sort of listing his
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:47.040]  executive orders that was a open threat even mainline pundits said it that he
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.680]  may ignore it just like he ignored Congress when they said no to carbon
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:56.840]  taxes I mean this is really happening we many a constitutional law scholar had
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:02.120]  their jaws hanging around their ankles after a president who claims to have
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.960]  taught constitutional law would make such a statement but that we've gone
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:09.880]  we've come become used to this after four years of this president I told
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:14.440]  Congress take a height up the hike on the war just like we became used to
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:19.920]  George W. Bush's shredding of the Constitution with his gang of neo
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.760]  conservatives over eight years the federal government clearly the amount of
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:30.800]  money they spend on things like fast and furious that end up killing people the
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:36.680]  amount of waste another solar company was just gone bankrupt it took a two point
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.720]  one billion dollar guaranteed federal loan only a few days ago another green
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:46.160]  project they're just wasting money left right and center and meet and meanwhile
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.320]  the they will come at gunpoint to collect a hundred dollars worth of overdue
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.560]  federal income tax so you I think the federal government is kind of grown out
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:59.880]  of control and this country is at a major crossroads right now if we don't do
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:05.840]  something as people or states exert their states rights for instance we're
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:11.400]  we're gonna slide into tyranny and we won't even know it we're already there
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.120]  actually if you if you really look at things the way things have rolled out on
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.080]  paper we're already in tyranny right now but I think it can get really worse
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:23.200]  the sum of things you mentioned earlier in the show about withholding passport
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:30.320]  privileges that's crazy I mean of the Soviet Union would do such things red
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:34.160]  China won't even do won't wouldn't even attempt such a thing you know why is the
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:39.080]  United States pushing so hard by the way it's past the Senate it's going to the
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:45.200]  House and it's CBS News and they're now saying internal checkpoints you won't be
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.000]  able to travel or have a job if you're not in good standing you've heard of no
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.760]  fly list how about a no buy food list or a no travel list or a no have a job list
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:14:00.080]  folks I'm not predicting this and then it comes true in their white papers that
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:04.840]  we've sourced and quoted they have said this is the plan how did I know they're
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.920]  gonna have hardened checkpoints that they now have including bulletproof ones
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:14.600]  that's in the news today because they announced it it's an armed camp where
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:21.560]  the criminals take over and have us all at gunpoint that's what a tyranny is it's
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:25.640]  it really became apparent when I I spent a lot of time outside of the United
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:30.240]  States as well as living and growing up here when I came back a couple months
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:35.360]  ago just before I came to see you in Austin you start turning on the TV and
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:40.480]  I didn't realize the overwhelming onslaught it's like a full court press
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.680]  when you turn on the television and to hear this president talking on a daily
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:51.800]  basis I really felt kind of oppressed in the fact that I'm looking around us and
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:56.880]  why isn't anybody upset about this what why are people not exactly I was
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:02.600]  watching the Expendables this morning on the treadmill you know cheesy action
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.160]  adventure film that Stallone produced because I found that's the best thing to
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:11.400]  watch when I'm jogging and normally I wouldn't watch my little stuff like that
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.520]  but it's actually good when I'm jogging jog harder longer faster kind of get
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:19.480]  into it but I was watching a supposed third-world country with oppression and
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:23.440]  it was America it was everything they're starting here and they were
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:27.640]  describing a horrible police state in Latin America and that's where I live
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:32.720]  and and all we have left is the old free speech and the Second Amendment and
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:38.300]  now they say they're coming after that and Obama through MSNBC is openly
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:43.480]  trying to cause a race war editing tapes of the Zimmerman guy to make it
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.840]  sound like he's racist I mean the it's just that it's even though we know it
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.360]  Patrick it's still amazing that these are real criminals that I mean we have
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:58.120]  real criminals in charge now I mean I stood there watching the press conference
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:03.760]  on the White House launch two days ago with President Obama President Calderon
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:09.520]  in Mexico and Stephen Harper from Canada and I listened to President Calderon
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:16.080]  lectured the American people on the fact that it's because of our guns that
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:20.560]  are going over the border that are killing people on the border towns along
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:26.720]  Texas New Mexico and Arizona somehow ignoring the whole fact that 30,000
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:30.920]  guns were shipped down in Operation Fast and Furious which was directed by the
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:35.520]  Department of Justice wait wait wait wait to be protecting the American
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:41.120]  people and these are causing the deaths not not a gun manufacturers and gun
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:45.560]  dealers who are doing legitimate business in America but the flip of it
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:50.520]  right in your face with Obama standing next to him and probably Eric Holder in
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:56.400]  the back behind the door smiling I can't conceive the hypocrisy the level of it
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:01.680]  is unbelievable well no exactly and we said this would happen when judicial
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:06.440]  watch sued and got the SPP documents they just got new documents where it
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:10.040]  confirms what police were already saying they they just released the illegals
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:15.960]  and give them a waiver form again the government selectively enforces but
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:21.600]  getting back to this they said in the SPP documents that from 2006 judicial
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.200]  watch sued and gotten 2007 that are so important it said we're going to use
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:29.840]  border security crises to merge the three countries we're going to use the flu
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:33.640]  and economic collapse and they go on to say we've got to keep this secret from
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:38.040]  the public and its corporate chiefs there giving all the leaders of the
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:42.520]  country's orders here's the corporate government thousands of pages I scanned
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:47.000]  over I put the most powerful ones in my film in-game blueprint for global
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.400]  enslavement and then here they are three years ago before Fast and Furious even
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:56.520]  broke I said they're shipping guns to Mexico under programs some of it had
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:59.880]  already leaked to blame the Second Amendment later and then even when they
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:03.760]  get caught doing it they still go ahead with it and here's the head of a
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:08.440]  narco terror estate lecturing the American people on our Second Amendment
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:13.320]  right when he's disarmed his poor people I mean this is incredible what we've
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:18.600]  been brought to and the other thing is people should not be naive okay when
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:23.680]  when you have a military industrial complex in this country that's grown to
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:28.320]  such proportions because we've we're deploying troops all over the world in
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:33.240]  the thousands daily okay and throughout history whenever a military or police
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.800]  state grows to a certain size it itself within the military will become very
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:42.720]  corrupt I used to have a friend from Uganda who is part of the Ugandan army
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:48.720]  under under Edie Amin he was a he was a dishwasher in London worked in a
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:53.840]  restaurant when I first moved there to study and he told me stories of that he
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:59.680]  would for cash him and his buddies in his unit would take arms out of the
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:03.440]  stockade which was the government military stockade and they would sell
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:09.000]  arms to the Lord's Resistance Army for cash okay the same thing in the Soviet
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:16.080]  Union half of the global black market after 1991 that flooded Africa and
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:21.280]  flooded Asia was ex-Soviet stockpiles because their their military industrial
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:25.600]  complex was just too big and they always eat their own country that's what
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:29.280]  happened in Rome the military ate its own country and they couldn't get the
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.040]  barbarians out and that's the thing the criminalities reach such proportions
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:36.920]  that it's gonna bring the whole system down because no one can stop anybody it's
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:42.440]  just mad stealing everywhere absolutely unbelievable
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:46.320]  Patrick Henningson I want to come back and play a clip of her all over there

[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:15.040]  all right a few minutes left with Patrick Hennickson the Lord Montage joining
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:19.160]  us with hardcore breaking news within a 21 is happening right here in Austin
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:26.400]  making headlines but if you just type in US troops growing opium in Afghanistan
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:35.920]  you'll get BBC ABC AP Reuters video CBS NBC Fox Sky news and it's all the same
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:39.880]  script because the troops were three years ago starting to mutiny over the
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:43.360]  fact that they were growing opium loading it on trucks flying it out and
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:46.480]  this all started coming out they had to kill Pat Tillman over it and that kind of
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:49.840]  got embarrassing he was writing letters home getting ready to go public so
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:54.080]  instead they said hey hide it in plain view well we hate it but Al Qaeda will
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:58.960]  make the money if we don't grow it and so here is Geraldo Rivera this all came
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.440]  out in a one-month period because they've gotten slicker instead of just
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.520]  denying it they're like yeah we grow the opium we're gonna put you in a private
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.760]  prison owned by our banks that bring it in if we catch you using it you see how
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:14.560]  they get money on both ends good businessman of course we're naive
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.160]  idiots so that's why we live like this let's go to a part of this clip get
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:21.280]  Patrick Hennickson's take on it here you are Geraldo tell us what you've seen
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.920]  during your days there in Afghanistan
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:29.280]  hi Allison they've been playing yes in some ways the Marines brilliantly
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:34.400]  executed invasion of Marja this town in the middle of helmet process province
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:39.360]  was the easy part the hard work now is governing this province the province as
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:44.160]  you suggest that has become addicted to opium in many many ways that is the
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:48.760]  principle oh see it's part of the hard decision they've got to govern it's
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:55.440]  tough but we do what we have to to win and let's go back to the clip here it is
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.840]  prop that is being grown here the Taliban lend the farmers the money they
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:05.400]  are indebted to the Taliban they have to grow the opium now the Marines in their
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:10.440]  success are in a sense a victim of their success because now the population is
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:15.000]  you know they have these opium fields and we are tolerating it we are
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:22.480]  tolerating the cultivation of the 10% of world supply pre 2001 now 92% or higher
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:26.560]  government's own numbers they're not tolerating it the Taliban wasn't letting
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:34.000]  them grow it oh but the Taliban's doing it that was one group of real Taliban who
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.440]  by the way knew bin Laden was the CIA that came out who weren't letting it
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:40.120]  happen I'm not saying they were good guys but they were not allowing the
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:44.960]  cultivation of it and so there was an invasion let's go back to the clip the
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:49.480]  opium because we know that if we were to destroy it now the population would turn
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:52.680]  against the Marines and it would be a real security risk let me introduce
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:56.200]  Lieutenant Colonel Brian Christmas he's the commanding officer of the 3rd
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:01.480]  Battalion 6 Marines really a wonderful group of Marines here I know that you
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:06.400]  care deeply about this this contradiction the fact that here you have one of the
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:11.280]  best fighting forces in the world ever mounted and in a sense you watching as
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:16.760]  this over there for the opium it grinds at your gut how do you deal with it what
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:21.600]  are you doing well frankly this is part of their culture so while it might grind
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:26.480]  in my gut it's what they do we provide them security we're providing them
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:30.920]  resources providing them alternatives resources are different crops to grow
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:34.280]  they're getting the seed and the fertilizer to do it they can they can
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:41.320]  rotate any of their crops that they want oh we provide them other crops that's
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:47.960]  why the crops up almost tenfold but again when you use it you go to a jail
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:52.760]  this is how they've made slavery legal seven point one million people I said
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:56.400]  six million yesterday I looked it up at seven point one mill now in prison
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:02.320]  double what China has and on record of the three or four big companies they're
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.160]  subsidiaries of banks that launder drug money so let me explain how this works
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:09.720]  they make it illegal to drive the price up so you see your daughter sell
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.560]  themselves people rob you for the money so the banks can get bigger profits then
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:17.920]  they get the zombies that use it throw them in the jails the prison's working
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:21.840]  to build widgets to drive down our wages on the outside you think China takes
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.840]  your jobs how about seven point one mill closing comments on this Patrick
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:31.200]  Hennigson yeah the important thing is if Americans can take anything from this
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.040]  information and just switch a little light on in their head and frankly I
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:41.200]  don't know how Geraldo Rivera earns for five million a year or ten million a
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:46.160]  year to to have absolutely zero brain activity going on but when when the
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:51.860]  Taliban got their award from the United Nations in 2000 for they did a
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:59.440]  fatwa on opium okay and this idea of the Taliban uses the opium to fund their
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:04.400]  insurgency is it was just a little bit of propaganda that's been seeded like a
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:08.760]  meme into the minds of the West by people like Tony Blair and so forth in the
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:16.520]  fact just look at the 700 tons before 2001 exported and now 8,000 tons by the
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:21.720]  latest calculation which was done in 2009 you're talking about you know a
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:25.120]  thousand percent increase or something like this and that's just what we have
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:30.280]  on record okay there is a corollation of God a girl for America and take the
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:35.120]  cancer virus shots because they support America and if you support America you
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:39.680]  grow the opium Patrick Hennigson of infowars.com great job Lord Christopher

[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:25.880]  some people would say well you know they're their own private website and
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:30.680]  so you know that's their right well if they were a video website about fishing
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:35.120]  or hunting or skateboarding and they said our terms of use are you can post
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:38.880]  videos about hunting or skateboarding that would be an issue but they call it
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:43.600]  YouTube something Google bought six years ago that was about the communities
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:49.320]  and free speech and about not being evil and YouTube run by Google with all
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:52.840]  its Obama administration connections connections to the intelligence
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:59.760]  community over the weekend dimmed the screens to black and for earth hour at
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:03.400]  first it was voluntary and that you had a switch and then later it just froze to
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:06.920]  black for a while where you didn't have the choice that's how it always works
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:12.400]  that's how they always do it and we have about eight different channels that are
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:18.320]  our official channels all together and I've done an analysis it's about a 600

[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:51.040]  and liberty and freedom trumps a bunch of sniveling control freaks who sit up on
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:57.000]  their mountain and always tell us what reality is and lecture us now I
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.760]  occasionally do some satire and I just did a joking piece as I introduced
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:07.120]  Mark Moreno of climate depot pointing out that she says that we're all
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:14.200]  mentally ill this professor that if we believe in you know natural changes in
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:17.880]  the earth and that it's not man-made she said that we need to be treated and I've
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.960]  gone and found some of her other writings saying don't wait for public
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:26.560]  consensus on climate change just do it praising John P. Holdren who of course
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:30.720]  calls for sterilants in the water I mean I've got they didn't expunge everything
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:35.840]  on the university side we found more but they've since memory hold a lot of it
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:38.960]  and are now acting like she never said it now I'm seeing articles where they're
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:44.840]  saying that she never even said that we're now making it up so no end to this
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:49.640]  well they went in this is only happened a few other times in the history of my
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:54.360]  YouTube channel the official Alex Jones channel with 193 million views they
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:58.640]  went in and they put a community strike and said YouTube has reviewed it we may
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:05.480]  even shut down your entire site now but for now this video is erased and in the
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:10.280]  video I simply showed a graphic of her in a straight jacket as a joke saying
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:14.520]  we're crazy she's a public figure I happen to know the law I've even called
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:18.680]  my lawyer yesterday I am looking because I've had enough I'm not litigious but
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:23.080]  I've had enough with her saying we're racist also in her paper so she's
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:27.080]  saying we're racist because we don't want to cut the power off to Africa okay
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:31.000]  we're racist and these other professors say we should be arrested Lord Moncton
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.280]  needs to be arrested all of this I go in there and joke about her and you know
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:43.800]  show a photo of her where she does the point is is I had a little fun and they
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:47.840]  said that's a thought crime I cannot now make fun of public figures so when I
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:51.180]  sue them when I sue Google and the rest of them it's going to be for
[01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:56.560]  discrimination and violations of terms of service unfair trade practices also
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:00.840]  false advertising because I go and give them I mean they make a ton of money
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.680]  off the ads there that they place on my videos even though I don't take ads on
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:08.080]  there because that gives them control they still place them on there they
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:11.760]  make a ton of money out of 600 million views I've done the math that's
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:14.880]  conservatively just in the click program I would have shared it with them and
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:20.120]  actually $500,000 the last three years and and I that's my 30% I would have
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:25.160]  gotten I just didn't take the ads because I didn't want to be part of a
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:30.200]  business arrangement with them okay so they still place ads so 70% more of
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:34.400]  that we're talking over a million dollars I give them this value I'm number
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:38.080]  one in Austin number one in Orlando I could keep listing the cities on the
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:43.560]  radio I have a number one radio show okay wherever I'm at I give them number
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:49.320]  one content follow their terms of service and they defraud me and go along
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:53.800]  with somebody saying I'm a racist and I'm a hater because I make fun of these
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:58.280]  people nothing about racing in the joke and now they're looking at shutting
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:01.280]  one of our whole channels down and then in the past when they've done that
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:03.920]  they've shut down the other channels till I go and file against them and
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:09.200]  defeat it the point is is that I don't relish suing this behemoth and I know
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:12.400]  they don't care they've got government backing but the point is we've got to
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:16.400]  stand for the First Amendment or no one is gonna have free speech as this iron
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.600]  curtain of tyranny descends now Lord Moncton will be with us 30 minutes in the
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:23.640]  next hour joining us on video Skype but I hadn't talked about this yet today and
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:29.160]  I wanted to discuss it now what's going on with this professor Kerry and no guard
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:33.920]  and I have just you know had enough of this this assistant professor of
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:37.640]  sociology and environmental studies because it's not just her saying we're
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:41.480]  mentally ill or racist it's all of them and we have a big article on this at
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:45.720]  info wars.com you know the threat of green fascism is the title where they
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:51.280]  say arrest us where they say shut us down ban our speech White House
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:57.120]  regulations are cast unsteen says fine us fee us censor us arrest us this is
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:03.640]  pure authoritarianism okay and now they've shut the video down and are
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:10.720]  saying that you cannot criticize a public figure this is outrageous she can
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:16.800]  call us racist she can say we're mentally ill and and oh well she says so
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:24.000]  she says so so it's so and then we can't do this and now the university is
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.320]  saying she never said that even though it's in her paper that she says we need
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:31.200]  to be treated and that's a standard thing with them that we're criminals or
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:35.440]  we're mentally ill and I know Lord Moncton can chronicle their examples of
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:40.720]  this he has been a beat-up he has been thrown out by the UN you try to talk to
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:47.360]  Al Gore you get roughed up at UN events these are dangerous people the UN is in
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:51.760]  Uganda and also in Central America on record killing people this is in the
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:56.160]  New York Times to get their land for carbon sinks we have agenda 21 outside
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:59.000]  Austin I'm gonna get to it the start of the next hour Lord Moncton that's a
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.080]  long preface intro but you know I tell you they just think they're anointed and
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:09.840]  they think their authoritarianism doesn't stink what do you say Lord Moncton
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:14.320]  one of the leading experts heading up by your center that researches these
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:18.280]  people all of your research has been proven correct so now they're calling
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:24.120]  for shutting us up I think that puts it very bluntly and very correctly Alex
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:30.800]  they are running scared if I can just review what the climate has been doing
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:36.560]  over the last few years we've just had literally two days ago figures from the
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:43.880]  Hadley Center and the climatic research unit at the University of East
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.720]  Anglia these people have now admitted that there's been no statistically
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:55.480]  significant global warming for 15 years likewise the most accurate sea level
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:59.840]  satellites that we have had up there for a few years is the Aviso Envisat
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:04.320]  satellite that shows sea level over the last eight years since that satellite
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:10.800]  first winter rising at a rate of equivalent to 1.3 inches per century
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:16.800]  the Florida State University's index of the activity of hurricanes tropical
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:22.080]  cyclones and typhoons around the world that shows the lowest level of hurricane
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:26.960]  activity in 30 years since the satellites were first watching the sea ice
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:34.320]  extent just today is greater for this time of year than it has been at almost
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:39.280]  any time since the 1979 when again the satellites were first able to watch and
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:45.200]  the spring has come a month late up there it's very very cold up there that's
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:51.800]  why we've had it warm down here so all their big storylines about how
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:55.720]  terrible it's all going to be are falling apart polar bears another one
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:59.920]  just today an important report out showing that the population of polar
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:04.880]  bears continues to grow as it has since the 1940s this is not the profile of a
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:08.120]  species in imminent threat of extinction well they're actually a scourge as you
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:12.840]  know invading green areas and attacking people and invading their homes
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:16.880]  absolutely they're now becoming very aggressive and intrusive because there
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:21.200]  are so many of them and they can't get enough food in these very very cold
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:25.640]  conditions unusually cold conditions in the Arctic so they increasingly in
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:31.520]  invade the human settlements in Greenland and and Canada so these are the
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:37.320]  actual realities of the climate and it is quite clear that what they predicted
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:42.080]  would happen isn't happening in fact if we look back on this now actually you
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:47.600]  and I've been at this for some time but the the UN's climate panel the IPCC
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:54.240]  produced its first report in 1990 and that course is a generation ago so shall
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:58.520]  we have a look at how their prediction of global temperature has got on they
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:04.320]  gave a high end a medium end and a low end prediction and yes there has been
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:10.800]  warming since 1990 but not very much it's actually below even the low end
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:16.680]  prediction of the IPCC they've got every single forecast that they've ever done
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:22.440]  wrong every single one of these forecasts was exaggerated plus the studies
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:25.760]  I've seen that you've covered and you're listing real facts here they'll
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:29.320]  just say peer reviewed but you have admitted facts they're not denying it
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:34.160]  a little bit of warming is actually good plus this gaggle of nuts said that we
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:38.880]  were going to be in an ice age by the 90s back in the 70s that's right so they
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:43.720]  what they want to do is they know they can get grants and attention and grow
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:47.880]  their little bureaucratic empires and academic empires by pretending there's a
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:52.040]  problem it doesn't matter which direction the problem they pretend is as long as
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.200]  they can all agree on telling the same story well first of all they tried to
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:59.240]  tell the story of global cooling whereupon global warming began then the
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:03.760]  global warming stopped and they they can't change here they can't go back to
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:07.400]  global cooling or everybody will laugh at them they can't pretend that global
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.400]  warming is happening because for 15 years on their own figures on the figures
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:16.360]  of the cheerleaders for this whole scare it isn't happening and so now they're
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:20.880]  increasingly forced back onto these rather desperate expedients one of which
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:24.640]  will come onto Norgaard in just a moment I want to do one more before that I came
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:28.000]  across this when I was addressing the Law Society of Ireland in Galway a few
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.320]  weeks ago they produced a graph you'll see it on the left wing websites to
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:35.760]  showing there have been many periods over the last 150 years since we kept
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:40.360]  global temperature records when there's been 10 or 15 years without any global
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:44.480]  warming like the last 10 or 15 years now of course what they don't realize when
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:49.720]  they show that that is the case is that that the fact exercises a very great
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:56.440]  constraint on the rate at which warming is occurring or could occur so yes we
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:59.920]  are getting a little warming you'd expect to see a little warming over the
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:05.040]  long term if you add lots of CO2 to the atmosphere but the point is it's not
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:10.880]  going to be very much it's not going to be alarming and even if it was as I said
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:18.320]  to the California State Legislature just a week ago it's in their case it's about
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:26.640]  30 times cheaper to sit back go surfing and enjoy the sunshine and adapt to the
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:31.440]  adverse consequences of any warming than it is to follow policies like
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:37.640]  California's Bill AB 32 and build all those windmills in the Alta Mont Pass to
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:42.240]  kill all the golden eagles and hawks and kites that are that they're killing by
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:46.840]  the thousand every year these are environmentally damaging projects but the
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:51.280]  fact is it's vastly cheaper even if the warming was going to be as bad as they
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:56.320]  say it is to do nothing and that brings me on to professor Norb got and I'm
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:00.400]  sorry that I too have kind of come crab-wise around the subject because I
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:05.560]  wanted to put what she is saying into context what you've just heard from me
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:13.160]  Alex is not something insane I have merely cited data and fact after data
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:17.360]  after fact and graphs and graphs and charts and equations and figures all of
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:24.240]  which you can verify you can check I'm not making them up so why in any
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:29.680]  rational world where free speech was allowed would I not be allowed to tell
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:34.080]  the truth and would I instead be accused of being some kind of a nutter and this
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:38.200]  after all and let's be very blunt about this this is what they used to do in
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:43.080]  Nazi Germany and in Stalin's Russia if they didn't like your point of view
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:47.000]  then what they did was they said right we're going to send you away to the
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.240]  Gulag to be re-educated because you are suffering from a mental illness the
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:57.360]  mental illness of not agreeing with the totalitarian dictator and let me just
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:02.000]  add it's not just her I mean there are so many of them when I went back and
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:08.320]  looked last night who say reeducate arrest reeducate arrest drug that she's
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:13.480]  just going along with what is standard when she says treat us I mean they're
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:18.640]  calling foreign authoritarianism Al Gore is saying they've got a force it on us
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:23.880]  now he said that two weeks ago in Austin it's out by Southwest I think this is it
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:28.360]  that they are terrified now that because the facts the actual unfolding
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:33.680]  climate is not happening as they and those whom they have been quoting said
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:41.000]  it would they are now terrified and so they're trying to do what is always done
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.720]  by the left in these circumstances to shout down any opposition with threats
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:49.720]  of arrest and international climate courts if you go back to the the Durban
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:54.320]  climate conference just last December the UN's conference there the members of
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:00.160]  all the world's nations were there the only person who revealed that in that
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:04.720]  major negotiating document was a proposal to establish an international
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:09.360]  climate court to which only Western people could be brought in front of was
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:13.480]  me the rest of the world's journalists were silent about it because they're
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:17.520]  beginning to become embarrassed by the way they had a police officer attack you
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:22.880]  for no reason on video what at the Copenhagen event that was very stupid
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:26.760]  of him because my back was turned to him at the time and I was walking away so
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:30.640]  that was silly too and he had lost his temper because he'd been listening to me
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:34.680]  talking with my mates I wasn't even talking to him about the climate for
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:38.800]  three hours because so badly organized was it we were left standing in this
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:43.520]  bitter subzero cold but he showed you how to get shot him up how dare you have
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:48.360]  free speech I was not to the ground and he said you're one of the nastiest
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:52.400]  people I've ever come across and I said I haven't even talked to you I was
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:56.800]  talking very friendly way to my friends but that's the way it is now that you see
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:01.400]  these people Alex don't have religion they don't believe anything until now
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:05.320]  now they've got religion or fact superstition of course a superstition
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:09.440]  being a religion that you can prove isn't true and they've got superstition
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:14.120]  they don't realize they've got no it's their religion that's why Al Gore's
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:19.200]  like shut them up I mean they're now saying shut people up the danger is they
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:22.440]  don't realize they've got it see you and I Alex we belong to the Christian faith
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:27.040]  we know where we stand but they don't have a right of initiation that says
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:32.120]  formerly you were not a global warming believer and now you are so they don't
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:36.120]  realize that they've got religion they actually think that they're being
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:41.480]  rational in demanding as as Norgard is said to have done in that press release
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:47.360]  issued by her own University of Oregon that not only society as a whole but
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:54.000]  individuals should be treated because of their views on global warming the word
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.640]  treated was there I know because I went and checked I wrote to professor no we
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:02.880]  have the copy but I mean they have TV ads for kids where they blow children up
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:06.440]  and kill them yeah I mean over in England as you know if you don't go along
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:10.160]  with it this is all they ever talk about it's part of a part of a larger
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:17.800]  tapestry but let's expand on this they have not removed this Kerry Norgard
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:22.040]  assistant professor and it goes on she says listen to your science advisor she
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:26.400]  wrote this fortunately you have made an excellent choice in commissioning
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:30.640]  Harvard physicist and Nobel Peace Prize recipient John Holdren as your
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:37.160]  science advisor so here she is in a letter to Obama that's public of course
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:41.000]  he's not a peace prize winner he's on a Nobel Prize winner period of course he
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.400]  is for drugging the water supply to sterilizes and she goes on to say don't
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:47.960]  wait for public consensus on climate change as a public letter and she goes
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:52.000]  public opinion does matter in democracy but this is a time when following it
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:57.720]  would be a serious mistake so here she is calling for an end to freedom we'll
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:01.120]  be back with Lord Christopher Moncton of science of public policy.org

[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:14.280]  thank John Rappaport who sits in for us sometimes investigative journalist at
[01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:18.600]  no more fake news dot com he sent this to us and Paul Watson's getting it out
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:22.000]  right now this will be breaking just like we broke it last week that she says
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.320]  treat us she tried to back off here she is with work doing work for another
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:30.800]  university we've saved it in case they take it down and Paul Watson's got the
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:35.720]  article Whitman College Kerry Norgaard is a professor of sociology
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:39.440]  environmental studies this is three years ago when Obama's first getting in
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:44.600]  she says listen to your science advisor and she goes on to say don't wait for
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:50.320]  public consensus on climate change this is written by her I have you now and
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:55.200]  stop shutting my videos down public opinion does matter in democracy but
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:59.080]  this is a time when following it would be a serious mistake two factors make
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:03.000]  public understanding of climate change unusually complex and she goes on to
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:08.400]  say shut it down dictatorially shut down coal she says right here I mean ladies
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:11.480]  and gentlemen scroll down where she says shut down coal shut down everything
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:16.920]  folks that's what he's doing Congress says no he just does it China gets three
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:20.840]  new ones a week we get him shut down we're going into a depression Lord
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:25.360]  Monkton this is breaking I got this an hour ago we vetted it we checked this is
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:31.600]  her she did it unbelievable sir this is even bigger than saying treat us what
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:36.600]  do you make of this latest outrage it is indeed an outrage and I think Alex the
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:41.280]  fact that you have been taken off YouTube is also an outrage and the fact
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:46.480]  that they've been taking me off YouTube slowly for many years by various
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:52.880]  devices and it is quite clear that what we are dealing with now is a very rapid
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:58.280]  march towards the sort of totalitarianism that Hitler practiced in Germany and
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:02.800]  that Stalin practiced in Russia and that Mao practiced in China and that
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:07.680]  Polk op practiced in Cambodia what we're now getting and Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:11.640]  while I think of it what we're now getting is the same things happening here
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:15.600]  it's the same political forces the people who think that they know best
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:19.840]  let's just examine that letter by Norgar that you're referring to the first
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:24.840]  thing is does she have any more qualifications than you or I Alex to
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:29.080]  write and say that climate change is a uniquely dangerous thing that people
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:33.000]  are incapable of understanding for themselves no she is some kind of a
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.680]  sociologist and by all accounts a very bad one and again look at the arrogance
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:40.040]  she says we must get rid of democracy and freedom because the public is
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:46.040]  stupid no no I built my operation out of nothing Lord Monk and has had big
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:51.680]  companies he built to himself you live in a government reservation and you and
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:56.640]  and and you're telling us we're idiots you are the idiot that I think is fair
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:01.640]  comment and I think also it's fair comment that if she has absolutely no
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:06.480]  knowledge of the science behind this she might at least have tried to study it a
[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:10.280]  bit before coming out with these pronouncements you see Alex when I
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:14.720]  first began looking at this I went and talked to the scientists on both sides
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:19.200]  I wanted to hear what the science really said I wanted to understand the
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:23.920]  economics for myself I sweated the numbers for myself before I started
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:27.920]  shooting my mouth off on this it took me six months before I said anything so
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:34.200]  did I spent years before I even know what this was about now she clearly
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:38.480]  hasn't got the faintest clue I imagine what letter she should now be writing
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:42.000]  she should be writing saying dear President Obama there are many problems
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.520]  you have to deal with not the least of which is a massive and very rapidly
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:52.000]  growing public debt so the first thing is the government shouldn't be spending
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  money on climate change given that there isn't any at the moment and likewise
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:00.680]  nor should the private sector be made to pay by not being allowed to buy cheap
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:04.280]  coal-fired electricity unless they're lucky enough to be able to buy it from
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:09.800]  China you know this is what is so absurd about what's going on these people are
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:15.880]  absolutely intent on closing down America in particular and the West in
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:22.240]  general I do not recall Alex having heard that Professor Norgaard has written to
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:27.080]  the Chinese government saying that their declared policy you'll find it in the
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:31.040]  annual statistical communicates of the People's Republic of China issued in
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:36.680]  Peking every year of building two or three new coal-fired power stations a
[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:46.760]  month is stay there stay there you are listening to GCN visit GCN live calm
[01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:54.880]  today I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I
[01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:58.720]  was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was
[01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:02.520]  literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:07.000]  and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:11.520]  eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at
[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:15.520]  info wars team dot com but I want to point out the three that have helped me
[01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:22.360]  lose 37 pounds in just two months products like beyond Tangi
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:27.200]  tangerine pollen burst and rebound when I started taking the Tangi tangerine and
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:31.800]  other products every day I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months now
[01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:36.920]  that's results I want to challenge my listeners to go to info wars team dot
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:41.320]  com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:46.200]  in the way you look feel and in your appetite almost immediately start your

[01:59:54.960 --> 02:00:00.880]  corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:20.120]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:26.880]  Alex Jones there's a 40-minute talk I did with Mark Moreno congressional
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:31.960]  advisor on climate change the guy that heads up climate depot calm at info
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:36.000]  wars dot com discussing the other videos that YouTube has taken down because
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.240]  I'm not allowed to criticize a woman who says get rid of freedom get rid of my
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:45.640]  votes I don't count I'm too stupid I need to be treated I mean we've got more
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:50.800]  of her letters on her official site saying it but they control reality now
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:54.120]  they've come out and said she never said that so I'm supposed to say okay I'll
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:59.000]  shut up because after all you're this almighty person and I've been around
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.800]  these so-called academics that call themselves on the left they are so
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:07.960]  arrogant and I'm not even in the whole left-right paradigm there's problems on
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:11.440]  like so-called right but there's something about the left where they
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:16.240]  always talk about I hear them on talk radio about how stupid everyone is and
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:24.800]  how smart they are and it's amazing that they live off of the tax money I pay no
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:28.760]  government handouts here and then sit around all day and talk about how how
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:33.760]  I'm mentally ill I'm racist and I need to have my my rights taken away because
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:39.200]  democracy is bad in her words and that I need to do what she says this person I
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:42.320]  mean and then I'm not even allowed to criticize her I know I'm ranting or
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:47.080]  monk and I'm sorry I'm just very angry about them shutting my videos down it is
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:52.280]  a serious violation this is this is 21st century book burning well you are
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:55.840]  right and I think that's a great phrase 21st century book burning that is
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:01.360]  exactly what it is these are people who have lost and lost and lost the
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:07.920]  argument every single point they said would come to pass it's gone the other
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:13.400]  way every single piece of analysis they've done is full of more holes than a
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:18.120]  piece of a Gruyer cheese they don't know what they're talking about and now they
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:23.280]  realized it and so their way of covering up for their own ineptitude
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:28.200]  incompetence and plain malice against the West in trying to shut it down in the
[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:34.040]  name of this bogus scare is to silence all criticism and of course Google and
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:40.360]  who sits on the board Al Gore of course Google owns yahoo.com yahoo is now I'm
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:44.200]  not you yahoo I'm talking about YouTube I'm sorry YouTube is now being is it
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:49.240]  shutting down videos like yours many videos like mine I've seen yours shut
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:54.040]  down and they'll use all sorts of little excuses they will they they just
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:03:00.560]  absolutely hate the idea of freedom of expression they hate to admit that the
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:04.640]  left having decided this was going to be its defining issue this was going to
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:09.400]  be the issue that last allowed them to shut the West down they've now realized
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:14.520]  it's gone wrong far more quickly than even they had suspected it would they
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:17.760]  are acutely embarrassed because they know Alex I think I may have said this to
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:22.920]  before I'm gonna say it again this could be the end of the left they know this
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:29.120]  they bet the farm on this global warming scare they put all their resources I mean
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:35.480]  literally tens of millions a year into propaganda if you just look at the the
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:38.720]  biggest yeah what's the total number it's like a hundred billion globally or
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:42.560]  something they've spent on this well I mean if you just take the ten biggest
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:47.040]  environmental organizations in the US they spent between them two billion
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:53.240]  dollars last year most of it on climate propaganda as an excuse for trying to
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:57.560]  shut the West down that's the kind of money they are spraying around and of
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:00.800]  course there's a lot of genuine environmentalists some of them may be
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.360]  listening to this some of them who really do care about the environment who
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:07.040]  realize there are real environmental problems deforestation overfishing of
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:10.440]  the world's oceans a really pressing problem many species will have gone in
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:14.080]  20 years if we don't do something about that and these are things that could be
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:19.440]  and should be solved by international cooperation in a sensible way but this
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:24.560]  climate scare is diverting attention away from the real environmental problems
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:29.160]  it's the left-wing wet dream they had thought they could get away with what
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:33.640]  they couldn't do with all the guns and goose-stepping troops first of Hitler
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:38.080]  and then of Stalin and Mao they thought they could shut the West down from
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:43.120]  within by Lord Monkton stay there long segment coming up I want to get in to

[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:18.320]  it's because I am 16 17 years ago when I first got on air I began to
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:24.320]  research agenda 21 UN biospheres in fact guys for prison planet TV viewers put
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:30.120]  the congressional map of agenda 21 zones up please that's the Dr. Michael
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:35.920]  Kaufman the congressional map it shows half the US off limits in these
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:41.520]  environmental corridors like something out of you know feudalism and the UN
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:45.240]  even says in biological diversity assessment in 96 they want to go back
[02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:49.920]  to feudalism and we've got all these professors and academics saying
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:55.440]  rationing authoritarianism they say fascism isn't bad when it's green
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:09:01.360]  fascism now that's a Senate vote map 21 where they want to not let you travel
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:06.000]  now if you haven't paid all your income taxes it's the Dr. Michael Kaufman UN
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:11.800]  map and that will bring it up we showed in the first hour now Lord Christopher
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:17.920]  Monkton who heads up well there's no doubt globally the premier aggregator of
[02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:22.000]  the scientific data proving what's really happening with our planet with the
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:26.720]  real scientists the the real satellites he's the guy nine times out of ten that
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:31.760]  is forecasting and exposing these people way out ahead so they've called for his
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:39.040]  arrest you name it and he joins us now but expanding expanding on that they
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:42.880]  have exposed all the universities she's spoken at or that she's worked at
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:47.160]  except for Whitman College three and a half years ago when she was commending
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:51.440]  Obama for appointing John B. Holdren who's also called for a global tyranny
[02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:56.080]  and we're drugging the water to sterilize us and praising authoritarianism
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:59.960]  like Dr. Pionka does at UT I mean this is who they are it's not like this is
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:04.880]  some oddball we found we have it we have it the university pulled what she'd
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:08.760]  written about treating us for mental illness and said that it was a it was a
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:14.960]  mistake and now we find this don't wait for public consensus a public letter she
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:18.880]  says public opinion does matter in democracy but this is a time when
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:23.000]  following it would be a serious mistake two factors make public understanding of
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.880]  climate change unusually complex she goes on to say we're stupid and then it
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:35.560]  says eliminate coal all of this stuff she says we can't do what the public
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:38.920]  wants this is even three and a half years ago they knew they were losing momentum
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:42.800]  and failing because of their power grab Lord Moncton what do you make of this
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:46.800]  this is a huge discovery that that the little poster girl that they're
[02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:51.800]  defending it turns out is an open authoritarian that's no surprise because
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:56.120]  so many particularly in sociology which is a non-subject which I would
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:02.160]  personally ban from all universities if I were an authoritarian that is these
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:06.800]  people think that they know better than we do this is the essence of totalitarianism
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:12.360]  and they say they know they are so much sure that they know better than us that
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:17.400]  they want to tell us every little detail of our lives no you can't burn coal in
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:21.480]  the great or in a power station no you can't light a candle it gives off carbon
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:25.800]  dioxide no you can't even go back to being a caveman because that means
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:29.560]  lighting a fire in your cave and that emits carbon dioxide what you've got to
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:33.040]  do is just die and stop breathing because breathing emits carbon dioxide as
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:40.360]  well it's this childish persistent stupid intellectually vapid arrogance
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:45.800]  which is the hallmark of the totalitarian everywhere and if you call them
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:50.120]  totalitarians or fascists or communists or international socialists or whatever
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:55.720]  phrase also means totalitarianism oh how they blub I once let slip in
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:12:01.640]  Australia that a remark by somebody over there was a fascist opinion I didn't
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:05.600]  even call the guy a fascist I just said he'd expressed a fascist opinion and all
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:10.280]  my goodness how the left wailed and howled when I arrived in Australia for a
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:13.960]  speaking tour last year the West Australian in Perth where I landed on
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:20.080]  the front page said ban the Lord that's their instinctive reaction every time
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:25.520]  you use their kind of language back they want to ban us from saying it but
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:29.480]  they want to continue to have the freedom to use this language themselves so
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:34.320]  there's a poisonous double standard there and this professor Norgaard the fact
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:39.440]  is that if she had wanted to deal with what happened in a professional way let
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:44.800]  us suppose that her original paper as she now claims didn't contain anything
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:50.760]  about the treatment of individuals who had this mental disease of not believing
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:54.480]  that global warming is a global crisis let's suppose that she was true in that
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:59.120]  I'm not going to argue that for the moment at this point the fact is that
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:03.600]  her university in a press release which I read while it was still up on the web
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:08.880]  said that she in her paper was there press release describing what she had
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:13.720]  done they had cleared it with her before she before it was put up there said very
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:19.160]  clearly that this must be recognized and treated in individuals as well as in
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:24.680]  societies of the home that's what it said and then when I spotted that I wrote
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:29.200]  to her a very polite letter and I said look professor I don't know whether you
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:32.680]  said this or not but the university is saying that you did or at least it is
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:36.680]  accused of saying that you did so I hadn't yet seen the university press
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:40.640]  release then I looked at it again afterwards I said if that is what they're
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:45.480]  they're saying could you please get it changed because this does give a very
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:49.440]  bad impression and it's taking us back to the era of Hitler and Stalin's a very
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:53.440]  polite letter and I added for good measure a few points about why global
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:58.200]  warming really wasn't a global crisis after all and the thing is I got no
[02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:02.520]  reply what she should have done is to write back and say thank you for writing
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:06.840]  in such a civilized fashion to point out what appeared on the press release I
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:10.800]  hadn't noticed this I've asked the university to change it and they're
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:14.120]  going to put up a new version and that would have quietened the whole matter
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:18.760]  down in a perfectly straightforward way but no the left can never admit they
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:24.640]  ever got anything wrong so she didn't do that instead furtively the university
[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:31.000]  without it hope leaving any traits that took out the words and treated in the
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.560]  press release that was up the University of Oregon and that those words no
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:40.840]  longer appear but let me stop you let me stop you here because there is a
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:45.400]  Google catch of the earlier version of the page and that proves that the words
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:50.760]  were there the university didn't realize that in doing this furtively it was
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:55.120]  going to make itself look just like another third world dictatorship and
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:59.240]  what these people have got to learn is they've got to learn that in fact in
[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:04.320]  civilized open debate there has to be a kind of modicum of honesty which these
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:08.360]  people have long since abandoned and that's why nobody listens to them
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:12.880]  anymore well that was my point though is that you're being very kind here saying
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:17.920]  you know perhaps but but look you they've expunged all her writings the one
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:21.800]  writing we find on a university written by her a letter to the president
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:27.600]  officially her site says we need to get rid of people's rights on this and do
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:33.120]  whatever we want and we know this drug treat reeducate is is constantly
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:38.680]  parroted by the entire gaggle so she spews a talking point that that we've
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:44.240]  seen at nauseam by other control freaks other greeny you know
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:49.120]  authoritarians and then we find another thing they haven't memory-hold yet and
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:55.440]  it says the same stuff so so I mean obviously she said it I think the point
[02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:59.800]  is that the way I like to approach these people is to be very polite to them
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:03.360]  privately and say look something's gone wrong here maybe you'd like to put it
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:06.520]  right then if they're sensible they write back in the home I go to say I
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:10.640]  said sorry of course I didn't mean that and and change it but she didn't write
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:16.600]  back to me and that tells me all I need to know about what her true intentions
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:21.080]  were because I didn't write a nasty email it was entirely friendly civilized
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:25.120]  sensible I'll send you a copy of it after this Alex and you can put it up on
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:29.880]  your website because it makes very sensible points not only about her but
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:33.840]  also the main points about why we don't have a problem with with the climate and
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:37.480]  even if we did there's nothing we can afford to do about it it's much better
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:41.000]  not to worry about and just let it happen it won't be that damaging with
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:45.800]  sea level rising at 1.3 inches per century etc so I think what we have to do
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:52.960]  is to say very firmly to these people we are now on your case if you come out
[02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:58.800]  and demand international climate courts or European criminal climate courts
[02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:02.000]  they're actually talking about that in Europe at the moment of course I'm
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:06.400]  trying to stop that too if you go on talking about having people sent to
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:11.680]  psychiatric institutions and treated for mental illness if they dare to rise
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:17.160]  raise perfectly legitimate scientific and economic questions rooted in the
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:22.720]  science then it is you who deserve to be locked up and not them and I'm going to
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:28.040]  make a proposal here Alex I think we're going to need a law which says that
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:33.880]  anybody who uses that kind of hate speech about having people treat it for
[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:39.000]  mental illness if they dare to disagree with the official so-called consensus
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:43.240]  which of course is just the Communist Party line then I think anyone who says
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:50.840]  that should themselves be locked up in prison for hate speech for discrimination
[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:55.400]  against those who wish to exercise the right of free speech yes sir Lord
[02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:58.720]  Moncton because because that's not a violation of their speech because
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:02.040]  they're calling for sedition against our liberties and our freedom a
[02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:07.440]  revolutionary overthrow of the Magna Carta of all common sense of everything
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:11.720]  that has been the hallmark of free societies when they're saying arrest
[02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:16.520]  people for their speech that is the authoritarianism they're saying shut us
[02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:21.840]  up for our scientific discussion and we see this in every authoritarian system
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:27.240]  absolutely I mean what they're calling for is a criminal takeover is an end of
[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:31.880]  quote democracy in her words I mean that is a declaration of war against all
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:38.840]  free society let me tell you the story of trofim Denisovich Lysenko now he in
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:45.040]  the 1940s and 50s he was a peasant he was somebody who thought he knew about
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:50.200]  how to improve the yield of crops and his idea was you soak the seed corn in
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:53.480]  water over the winter instead of planting it out in the autumn to get used to
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:56.920]  the cold weather and then it germinates better in the spring it doesn't
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:01.920]  actually but that was his theory and he told his local Communist Party secretary
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:05.600]  of this over a beer one night and the Communist Party secretary said trofim
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:09.640]  here you are an ignorant untutored peasant but you've come up with an
[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:14.240]  idea as brilliant as this just because you live in the glorious Soviet Union and
[02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:19.080]  by this propaganda he ended up by some ghastly mischance as head of the
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:24.520]  Soviet Academy of Sciences as a result of which there were 20 failed harvest
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:28.080]  because they all had to pursue this ludicrous policy of soaking the seed
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:31.440]  corn in water where in fact it just becomes rotten and doesn't produce any
[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:37.960]  crop and 20 failed harvest 20 million Soviet citizens killed of starvation as
[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:43.240]  a direct result of this mad policy imposed from the center and anybody who
[02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:47.760]  quarreled with Lysenko and said this was wrong anybody who also opposed his
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:53.200]  notion there was no such thing as genetics was sent to prison or killed or
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:59.440]  both that was what actually happened in Soviet Russia and now the same kind of
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:04.080]  people are using the same kind of language and advocating the same kind of
[02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:11.480]  remedies and it is they not we who should go to jail well I hear you because
[02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:15.320]  again people say well you're just doing what they're doing no they're striking
[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:19.320]  first we're not saying arrest people for their political speech we're saying
[02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:24.640]  arrest people who say arrest us because it's that they are calling for the force
[02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:29.440]  of the state to be used on our liberties they are the tyrants and you know
[02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:35.800]  what they say in Latin about tyrants well absolutely and as the dictator of
[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:40.000]  Nicaragua used to say to those who be defeated in the various elections there
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:46.160]  you won the election but I won the count they like to stack the way things fall
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:51.240]  in their favor because they know that they can't beat us in argument if you
[02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:56.200]  read Obama's hero Saul Alinsky another communist agitator just like Obama
[02:20:56.200 --> 02:21:01.120]  himself Alinsky and his rules for radicals he says this he says don't try to
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:04.840]  argue with the capitalists they are right we all know they're right we know
[02:21:04.840 --> 02:21:08.160]  they have the truth we know they can argue better than we can because they're
[02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:13.440]  right and true so if you want to deal with them attack their reputations and
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:18.280]  this is what she's doing she's trying to make out that anyone who dares to say
[02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:23.040]  that there may be something wrong with this bogus climate science that it's
[02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:28.120]  been oversold and over exaggerated and if there's no economic basis for it
[02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:33.920]  anyway anyone who says that she says is effectively mentally defective now Lord
[02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:36.600]  Monkton we've only got a few minutes left you've been very gracious to join
[02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:42.160]  us on short notice but I want to release the hounds of liberty here cry havoc and
[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:46.600]  release them she had literally hundreds of pages at three different
[02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:51.240]  universities that were expunged but they will be in the Google cache and the way
[02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:55.280]  back machine I have a limited crew you have a limited crew it is now time for
[02:21:55.280 --> 02:22:02.680]  all of us to crawl through the caches of what she said because they expunged it
[02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:09.240]  all in a desperate stratagem to hide this because the one document we found
[02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:14.080]  that they forgot to get she's calling for authoritarianism okay of course you'll
[02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:18.920]  say this isn't her either in this letter to Obama so again I believe they're
[02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:24.200]  they're afraid of this issue they know that it's hit the zeitgeist where as
[02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:28.040]  thousands of other academics saying similar things literally dozens at UT I
[02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:32.120]  know personally two miles away calling for it calling for Chinese style
[02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:37.760]  authoritarianism forced abortion I mean this is what's pushed by these you
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:42.280]  Genesis Lord Monkton I wanted to look at the big picture here and talk about a
[02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:45.920]  Jenna 21 the environmentalists who aren't real environmentalists as you said
[02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:49.120]  that they're just they're distracting from all the real stuff that's happening
[02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:53.400]  that needs to be dealt with they are establishing a Jenna 21 a global UNESCO
[02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:58.120]  model of the ultra elite against the rest of the free market a neo feudalism a
[02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:02.360]  post-industrial world they've taken over 30,000 acres that's conservative in
[02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:06.360]  Austin the last 20 years shang forcing people to sell it for pennies on the
[02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:11.400]  dollar farms and ranches in in key development zones I've interviewed the
[02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:14.520]  farmers and ranchers they take this one of the fastest growing cities in the
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:19.920]  US they take this land and a few years later take the restrictions off and they
[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:24.800]  the commas are the former mayors and others sell it and control it and make
[02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:29.360]  money off of it open criminal activity and they and they told the citizens
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:33.320]  when we take this land it's going to be giant green belts but most the land they
[02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:36.840]  didn't turn into green belts they built shopping malls on it movie theaters
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:41.400]  whatever the point is they stole it now here's the Austin American statesman
[02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:45.360]  residents troubled by surveillance cameras on these tens of thousands of acres
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:48.120]  they haven't sold yet because they don't want humans using it because they'll
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:52.480]  think it's their part they put up big fences show folks a shot of this crew they
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:58.800]  put up big game fences for the backyards back up and arrest people with
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:03.080]  hidden cameras that are seen ever walking on the land that was promised to be
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:09.360]  green belt and it says in the article worst of all they even hike on the trail
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:14.560]  the evil humans are hiking on the trail and they have hidden cameras watching
[02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:18.520]  the evil citizens I mean this is pure feudalism Lord Mountain your comments
[02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:23.960]  on that well that's exactly what it is it is an outrage and I think it's time
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:28.800]  that instead of just complaining about this we started to make plans to fight
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:34.200]  back the first step it seems to me is to get the matter of President Obama's
[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:37.880]  birth certificate into court with a serious challenge rather than the joke
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:42.240]  challenges we've had so far the next thing to do is to make sure that the
[02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:45.400]  Republicans who seem to me to be dead from the neck up and dead from the neck
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:50.400]  down every time this kind of outrage from the left comes out they should say
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:55.320]  something about it why is it left always to you and me and Mark Morano and a
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:25:00.720]  tiny handful of others to speak out and say that this kind of hate speech from
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:05.280]  Professor Norgaard's University is the kind of thing that ought to be a
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:11.280]  criminal offense if they try to make hate speech as they define it from us a
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:15.080]  criminal offense then it's time that they should endure the same thing if
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:19.640]  they go around accusing people like you and me Alex of being mentally
[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:25.440]  defective because we dare to question the notions of global warming that they
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:30.560]  present then they should go to jail for that because that is an unreasonable
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:37.160]  restriction on our right to our reputation and we have in England a law
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:41.720]  called criminal libel you do that to me in England I'll have you in court for it
[02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:46.320]  for criminal libel and you can go to jail for a long time for doing it now in
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:51.320]  the United States you have no such law and I think that free speech which is
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:56.680]  guaranteed in your Constitution can only work if universities like that of
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:26:02.360]  Oregon are told that if you use hate speech of that kind you can be fined
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:07.560]  millions of dollars and the people at the university responsible for it can go
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:13.920]  to jail for a very very long time let us start using against the left precisely
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:18.240]  the weapons they're trying to use against us and see how they like it well
[02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:22.400]  Lord Moncton don't we start with not even calling him the left because I mean
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:27.760]  Thomas Jefferson was on the left you know the old classic liberal I can say
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:32.560]  you would be a classic leftist in that you wanted more freedom more liberty I
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:35.600]  want to show some photos you can't see them Lord Moncton but later you can see
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:41.120]  the video this is for your request for video stills from the hidden cameras
[02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:46.800]  lining the the the preserve aiming at people's back kitchen window at night
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:52.960]  with them inside at eating so so so this is what with our tax money they take
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:56.840]  tens of thousands of acres don't want you on it because they want you to forget
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:00.600]  it's theirs they can sell it later to their friends I mean it is just so
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:05.200]  blasphemous what they do and the reason why they want to keep you off it is that
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:09.720]  there is a very ancient right which goes back to Roman law and came to your law
[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:14.280]  through English law it's known as use you for up to a right of use and that if
[02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:20.920]  the public passes freely over what would otherwise be private land without any
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:26.160]  restriction or fence or anyone saying you mustn't do it for 10 or 12 years
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:32.320]  it conveys the public then gains a right of way which makes a mess of their
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:36.480]  plans later to sell it on to developers that's why they're putting those fences
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:39.640]  up that's why they don't want you walking through the land it's not that
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:44.800]  you're going to tread on the voles or hurt the flowers no no no it's because
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:49.920]  they don't want you establishing a right of way so that they can't then sell the
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:56.320]  land yes exactly it was supposed to be a commons I remit on in the law it was
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:27:59.400]  supposed it's all over the country all the world with these UN land grabs it
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:03.720]  was supposed to be they said oh a commons park and they immediately fence it
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:07.920]  and don't let you use it and then later sell it I mean it's so evil how do you
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:11.960]  stop them because they don't want rights of way established because of a right
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:16.360]  of way goes across there it vastly reduces the sale value to developers
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:21.400]  that's why they're doing this it's entirely for basically criminal reasons
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:25.920]  and the trouble is now that because the state has become so wealthy and the
[02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:29.800]  individual so comparatively poor through having to pay excessive taxation and
[02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:34.760]  comply with excessive regulation fewer and fewer individuals have the kind of
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:39.760]  wealth that is needed to take these people to the courts and get justice and
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:46.240]  so I am also looking at proposals now to set up effectively using their language
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:53.840]  a people's court which can call to account any official paid by taxpayers
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:29:01.480]  for their behavior and the people will be entitled to free representation at the
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:06.040]  expense of the public authority against whom they are bringing the charge just
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:13.120]  serves to level the playing field and allow us to get our points yes sir
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:16.960]  against we're out of time Lord Monkton just briefly what do you think of her
[02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:22.200]  reportedly saying it's racist I mean the the UN is in 21 that's pure racism of
[02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:27.040]  course it is all of its racist all of it is designed to try to shut down the
[02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:32.720]  West and it is disfiguring to see so many people like her calling us names like
[02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:37.800]  racist when it is she who is the racist she is saying there are two races the
[02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:42.880]  clever ones like her and the mentally defective like us that is exactly
[02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:47.560]  racism and she should go to well said sir thank you thank you so much science
[02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:52.480]  and public policy.org thank you Lord Monkton we're on the march the empires
[02:29:52.480 --> 02:30:02.680]  on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a little over a year ago I
[02:30:02.680 --> 02:30:06.880]  began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal
[02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:11.040]  that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that
[02:30:11.040 --> 02:30:14.600]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:18.480]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[02:30:18.480 --> 02:30:23.480]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild
[02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:27.920]  themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best

[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:34.400]  the environment side issue we've got well the best-selling author and whistleblower
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:39.480]  of economic hitmen John Perkins joining us here for a short interview to just
[02:34:39.480 --> 02:34:43.840]  look at what's happening in the world he was of course sent in to basically take
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:47.800]  over countries and if he failed they sent in the hitmen very important

[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:25.440]  big fan of gravity-fed filters because reverse osmosis takes all the minerals
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:30.360]  out I use it for cooking and things but it's still important to get some water
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:34.040]  that has the minerals in it and gravity-fed filters are the way to go
[02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:38.320]  they reduce all the major toxins they don't cut everything out but they
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:42.720]  depending on the test 99.99 of most of them fluoride's almost impossible to
[02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:46.080]  get out but they have a special filter you add that reduces it almost down to
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:49.480]  nothing all the specs are at info wars.com I've done the research
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:56.360]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter bigger filters works faster more

[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:20.960]  economist a major well well he's advised the former chief economist of the
[02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:24.800]  World Bank he's worked at the highest levels I'm not gonna try to go over his
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:28.480]  whole bio most of you know who he is he's written confessions of an economic
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:33.520]  hit man he's also written the secret history of the American Empire and hood
[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:38.680]  wanked blueprint for a new form of global economics and he joins us now I'd
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:41.880]  been on about six eight months with all the big developments that are taking
[02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:46.320]  place John great having you I've got so many questions but for you right now
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:50.680]  what is most important front and center for you somebody who's been on the inside
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:56.040]  of this what the controlled implosion of Europe Goldman Sachs capturing
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:38:01.320]  Europe and Hitler and and Mussolini and Napoleon couldn't what is what is most
[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:06.280]  important on your radar screen right now John Perkins well Alex I think all of
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:12.840]  that's important I just came back from Istanbul I'm headed off to England and
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:17.000]  Ireland and Iceland and I'm traveling around a lot and heading around the
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:21.120]  United States speaking very many different places and what I'm really
[02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:26.440]  struck by is how we're waking up and shows like yours are really making that
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:30.360]  happen and we're seeing you know there's the Occupy move and people are people
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:33.960]  are waking up but we're seeing and I saw in Istanbul I see in the Middle East I
[02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:38.480]  see in China we're seeing in Russia with people standing up to Putin we're
[02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:42.880]  seeing around the world today that people really are waking up and some of
[02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:45.760]  it isn't leading anywhere it's just people out on the streets you know
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:50.600]  demonstrating and talking but but to me it's a good sign that shows like this
[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:54.440]  one are getting through to people they're really beginning to wake up and
[02:38:54.440 --> 02:39:01.840]  despite the way that they can get the corporatocracy is digging in we know
[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:05.640]  that we're waking up and the fact that they're digging in so strongly also
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:09.520]  indicates to us that they know that we're waking up and we're beginning to
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:13.280]  win and so I might have thought to you and and all the others that out there
[02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:19.280]  spreading this word because the tide's turning well I agree with you and again
[02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:24.920]  they tried to co-opt and take over the Occupy movement that was speaking out
[02:39:24.920 --> 02:39:28.640]  against corruption Wall Street has been the heart of the problem not just here
[02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:32.960]  but worldwide that's where the you know you much of the main system of the
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:36.720]  monster resides not just its tentacles but when they couldn't co-opt it and
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:41.160]  just turned it into a call for higher taxes the Obama administration had
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:46.400]  simultaneous raids and 30 plus cities arrest the people so they're failing to
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:51.640]  co-opt the Tea Party they're failing to co-opt the Occupy movement what do you
[02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:54.800]  see from being on the inside of this describe what an economic hitman is
[02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:58.040]  because we haven't done that in a while and what we see happening in Europe what
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:03.160]  we see unfolding right now but we see all these countries being hit I was just
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:09.280]  on a program yesterday in Ireland and you know Ireland's got hit very hard by
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:17.240]  economic hitman Italy, Greece, Portugal, Iceland and the United States you know
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:21.360]  I've been talking to a group of people here in the United States who took
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:24.760]  credit cards that said they could have interest that you know 3% is all that
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:28.920]  have to pay in their interest but the fine prince and then and many of them I've
[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:32.640]  talked to this whole group of people that are now trying to file a class
[02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:37.720]  action suit because they took out loans they use these loans to finance down
[02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:41.320]  payments on houses and many other things that they thought it was a 3% the
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:46.280]  very very fine print and even lawyers didn't see this said that you know you
[02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:50.000]  could you could set it up so that your payments would be paid every 30 days or
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:55.040]  every 35 days let's say and automatically and therefore you'd never have to pay
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:59.560]  more than 3% if you didn't set it up that way if you didn't pay within those
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:05.520]  35 days your interest payments would go up to 30% what people didn't read what
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:08.760]  they didn't see this extremely fine print was that the banks had the right to
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:13.760]  go from 35 days to 30 days arbitrarily and so all these people suddenly found
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:16.800]  that they hadn't made their payment on time because the time frame had changed
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:22.320]  from 35 to 30 days and so suddenly they're being hit by 30% interest rates
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:26.480]  on these loans there's nothing they can do about it these big banks doing this
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:32.120]  and and it's that same process you know it's similar to what we did on a much
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:36.440]  larger scale to the developing world back in the 70s when I was an economic
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:41.120]  kid Matt it's what's happened in Ireland it's what's happened in Italy and in
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:47.240]  Greece it's happening here at home to our own people and we're but the point
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:51.160]  is people are beginning to see through the veneer they're beginning to see
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:55.320]  that our country in fact the world economy has been stolen by a bunch of
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:42:03.160]  robber parents and it's time for us to take it back expanding on what you did
[02:42:03.160 --> 02:42:09.680]  so people can understand from an inside perspective on what these mega banks are
[02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:13.400]  doing how they operate how they take over countries including ours because
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:17.600]  understanding that as a way to reverse engineer it and extricate ourselves from
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:21.960]  this I mean describe what you cover in your best-selling book economic hitman
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:26.080]  confessions of an economic hitman okay also what I did specifically was to
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:30.680]  identify countries that had resources at corporations covered like oil for
[02:42:30.680 --> 02:42:35.200]  example and then arrange a huge loan to that country from the World Bank or one
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:38.400]  of the other big banking organizations but the money would never actually go
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:41.600]  to the country instead it would go to our own corporations to build
[02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:47.200]  infrastructure projects in that country huge projects like a big big power
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:50.440]  plant hydroelectric plants and transmission lines and distribution
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:55.600]  stations and multi industrial parks things that would benefit a few wealthy
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:42:59.280]  families in those countries as well as our own corporations that built them
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:02.680]  but wouldn't help the majority of the people who don't have enough money to
[02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:06.280]  buy much electricity can't get jobs in industrial parks so they don't hire many
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:09.760]  people and yet the people of the country would be less holding this huge debt
[02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:13.520]  that they couldn't repay so at some point we go back and say hey since you
[02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:18.640]  can't pay your debts essentially give us your resources your oil or whatever
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:23.360]  such as at a very low price without any environmental or social regulations
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:27.000]  without having to take care of the people in the country that would they were
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:30.880]  exploiting or allow us to build a military based on your soil or vote
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:35.680]  with us on the next critically United Nations vote and in a few cases where we
[02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:39.240]  couldn't convince presidents to take on those deals which were really bad for
[02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:43.600]  their countries the jackals step in and they either overthrow governments or
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:47.040]  assassinate their leaders and you know I talk about my own personal experience
[02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:50.240]  at Ecuador with the president there honey rolls those democratically like the
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:54.200]  president Omar Terry host of Panama they didn't buy into these deals they have a
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:57.960]  lot of integrity and both of them were and then they wouldn't they wouldn't
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:04.600]  listen to me they wouldn't buy my deal so both of them were assassinated now
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:08.520]  when they don't do the deal the jackals come in what are the jackals do well
[02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:12.960]  either overthrow the government that we just saw this happen and Honduras with
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:19.440]  president Zalaya about two years ago or they and we see that of course happened
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:26.400]  with the ending in Chile and Arbenz and Guatemala and so on and so forth or they
[02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:29.840]  assassinate the leaders which we saw in my case with honey rolled those of
[02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:34.480]  Ecuador and Omar Terry host of Panama so they're either overthrown if they go
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:37.640]  kind of peacefully and they leave the country like Zalaya did in Honduras
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:45.320]  okay if they're not going to go peacefully then they're taken out looking at
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:49.280]  Europe you know I remember we first talked six years ago or so or I guess
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:52.160]  longer we were talking about how the bankers were now going to do the same
[02:44:52.160 --> 02:44:56.400]  stuff to us in Europe in the United States in England I've seen some of the
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:00.160]  top irish reporters bring up to the European Central Bank in press conferences
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:04.520]  hey most this debt over 90% isn't even ours you got our government to sign on
[02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:09.560]  to your derivatives and then you lecture terms to us when you loan us money back
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:14.880]  this is crazy and and the ECB people just in these videos and tended to play
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:19.320]  one today but it's up on infoworks.com they just laugh at them I mean it's
[02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:25.760]  such a con job how how these bankers do this I mean it's amazing well that's
[02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:31.880]  exactly it Alex it's a loaded gun it's a loaded it's a con job it's a scam and
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:35.120]  and what I described earlier that's going on in the United States where these
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:39.840]  credit card loans is exactly the same thing but that the banks are screwing
[02:45:39.840 --> 02:45:46.000]  their own customers big time and and it appears to be illegal what they're doing
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:50.400]  because it's a fine print on the contract that says if you don't it that
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:55.640]  they have the right to just arbitrarily change the time frame from 35 days to
[02:45:55.640 --> 02:46:01.360]  30 days for example and you know we've seen this over and over we've seen it
[02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:04.880]  here in the United States when two years ago all the bankers were telling
[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:09.080]  people who could only afford a $300,000 house well by the $500,000 house
[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:12.480]  tighten your belt for a few years and then it'll be worth a million just go
[02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:17.000]  ahead and do it we know you can do it we will approve this loan and then of
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:21.280]  course the market the bottom falls out of the market the house is not only worth
[02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:26.600]  the hundred thousand and the people still have a loan out for 500,000 they
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:31.320]  can't pay it the houses were closed on the banks repackage the whole deal and
[02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:36.040]  sell it to someone else it's pure robbery there's no person about it and
[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:40.040]  it's time we really stood up to it I think people are beginning to stand up to
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:45.200]  it what did you make of two or three weeks ago when that high-level Goldman
[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:49.640]  Sachs exact quit and said you know we try to rip off our clients we make fun of
[02:46:49.640 --> 02:46:53.280]  them we call them idiots we call them muppets and I just can't be part of this
[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:58.760]  culture anymore and then now we learn Goldman Sachs has sex traffic sex slave
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:04.280]  funds and you know Mitt Romney's and wife is invested in yeah well I think that
[02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:09.080]  that guy you know really hit the nail on the head he opened a Pandora's box and
[02:47:09.080 --> 02:47:15.760]  there's gonna be a lot more coming out I was I was grateful but he had done that
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:19.400]  and I think we're gonna see a lot more that coming down the line John why do
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:23.320]  you think what we've seen I know you've talked about this record globally
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:27.000]  central bankers not your local banker that helps the economy but these you
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:32.640]  know these finance capital crony people these insiders these money changers I
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:37.200]  guess you could call them they're resigning in droves and and running off
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:42.240]  to the third world or to remote areas why is that I think they're scared they
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:46.600]  see this coming down the tube you know that people are waking up there's gonna
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:49.800]  be a bloodbath I hope there's gonna be a bloodbath and I think they're
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:53.640]  expecting that to happen too so take the money and run you know I mean they can
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:57.360]  take they can take their millions and live like kings and many plants of the
[02:47:57.360 --> 02:48:02.040]  third world remember a few years ago when it turned out that Goldman Sachs was
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:06.000]  like buying all these weapons at their offices and like having weapons caches
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:10.280]  at their offices and they said it's for the public I mean wow when people are in
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:14.120]  business as a company buying guns to protect themselves from people with
[02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:19.920]  pitchforks and torches I mean you know that they know what they're doing yeah
[02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:23.760]  well they sort of saw the Occupy movement coming and it hasn't come nearly as
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:27.400]  strong I think it's a lot of people expected it to but it's been pretty
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:32.400]  ruthlessly put down in many places we're in a very very interesting world
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:36.720]  Alex and you know that this is a time that's been prophesized by indigenous
[02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:40.880]  cultures around the world at the time of shaking up a turmoil at a time when
[02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:45.360]  when people are going to wake up more and I we really are waking up and we
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:50.320]  have to expect that there's going to be a pushback by the status quo they're
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:57.720]  going to do everything they can to stop this turnaround from happening well said
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:01.800]  just briefly the Coney 2012 people we just learned have released their big
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:05.720]  part to and I'm attacked in it for pointing out that this was being used
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:09.800]  by the State Department to try to launch wars in Africa and the same things
[02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:14.520]  happening in Uganda you know in the past this is happening now I'm not saying
[02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:17.440]  the Lord's Resistance Army is good they haven't been seen in years there's
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:21.560]  these calls to go into Sudan and start a war and my point is they get these
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:25.640]  well-meaning people involved thinking backing military intervention is for the
[02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:30.720]  good but I never see the State Department get behind something John is
[02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:34.440]  you know for the good generally it's always for special interest but they'll
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:39.160]  use the left now I'm seeing some of the left call for war as if it's
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:45.760]  humanitarian yeah we're seeing that in Mali too but you know the threat of war
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:51.480]  is a good for business unfortunately you know our economy is a very large degree
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:56.920]  based on the military and I can't believe that anybody really wants us to go to
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:50:01.000]  another war or with Iran I mean my god Iraq and close down the
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:04.320]  straight to the core moves and shut off more than 20% of the world's oil
[02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:07.400]  supplies we don't want war with them I don't think most the big industries do
[02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:10.840]  either but they want the threat of war because as long as you've got that
[02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:14.360]  threat of war hanging over you everybody's buying weapons well what
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:17.720]  about Libya I mean I'm not a fan of Gaddafi but he was a stabilizer he'd
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:22.160]  come in out of the cold they've put al-Qaeda in charge now yeah well if you
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:28.200]  remember the Gaddafi you know was opposed to the dollar to the central bank
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:32.840]  the Federal Reserve our central bank and he was he was threatening to create a
[02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:37.720]  new exchange for oil that would not be paid for in dollars that would be paid
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:41.840]  for what he called the gold diner he had a pretty big goal stay there I want to
[02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:45.040]  hear about why they went after him for that final segment with John Perkins

[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:05.560]  if you question man-made climate change and paying Al Gore money basically you
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:10.200]  should be putting a mental ward now we found more of her writings in democracy
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:16.040]  okay that article's coming out see how fast they pull that off there John
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:21.040]  Perkins whose website is johnperkins.org can shine up there and get
[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:25.520]  his free newsletter at johnperkins.org can also sign up at info wars com halfway
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:29.840]  down to our free newsletter John finish up with Gaddafi because that's a good
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:34.600]  model I mean love him or hate him he was actually building up Africa and he was
[02:55:34.600 --> 02:55:38.480]  not playing ball with the banker boys he certainly was not playing ball with the
[02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:42.360]  banker boys he's made the same mistake if you want to call it that as Saddam
[02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:47.400]  Hussein and and at the Iranians are poising for the same thing today and
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:52.200]  that is to say you know I'm gonna bring the dollar down basically he said you
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:56.760]  know we there's no reason why we can only trade oil for the US dollars and he
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:00.560]  was recommending that African nations and other Muslim and Middle East nations
[02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:06.520]  buy oil and sell oil for the gold diner which was a currency that he basically
[02:56:06.520 --> 02:56:11.240]  created and he had a huge goal supply to back it up in his own country and now we
[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:17.280]  don't pay kindly to any any infringement upon the Federal Reserve or the US dollar
[02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:21.520]  and I think frankly that that's that's the big reason why we went after him when
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:25.960]  we did and you know I always say that too but I mean you're saying and we say
[02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:30.600]  we we we we we and I guess it is weak as we let our government turn into this
[02:56:30.600 --> 02:56:35.440]  with corporations but more and more it they just ignore the people's will the
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:38.680]  American people don't like what's happening I mean Congress has a 9%
[02:56:38.680 --> 02:56:42.400]  approval rating I think we just need to recognize this government and these
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:46.160]  corporations do not have our best-interested hearts and and really
[02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:51.200]  are the problem yeah absolutely you're right it isn't really we it's they but
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:54.680]  we are part of it and we gotta turn it around we gotta realize though that the
[02:56:54.680 --> 02:56:58.120]  government really is not that important the government's run by the big
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:02.560]  corporations but ultimately we do have control over these corporations you know
[02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:06.440]  we got rid of apartheid in South Africa back when I was in college by boycotting
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:09.840]  companies that supported it we get corporations to clean up terribly
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:12.920]  polluted rivers in this country and open their doors wider to women and
[02:57:12.920 --> 02:57:17.120]  minorities we do have a lot of power over this that we just exercise it we
[02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:20.400]  have to do it though we have to demand that these corporations turn things
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:24.320]  around or we won't buy from them sure what do you think of how they've they're
[02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:28.000]  trying to rebrand war now under left cover because it's been discredited
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:32.160]  under the right we're over gonna aid Syria the rebels and they're calling
[02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:36.080]  them protesters when they're arming people to try to overthrow them yeah
[02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:40.640]  well it's just it's just another misuse of words and we hear that all the time
[02:57:40.640 --> 02:57:47.160]  it's always there for war and and and dictators support dictate you know it
[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:51.080]  was shocking to me that when when Mubarak fell in Egypt that the huge
[02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:54.080]  percentage of the American people thought he was a democratically elected
[02:57:54.080 --> 02:58:00.200]  president he's been a totalitarian dictator backed up by our CIA for decades

[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:23.040]  Hades but now he said the Supreme Court because the word is they're gonna rule
[02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:27.200]  against his plan and so he said all they don't count you know I can do whatever I
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:33.080]  want this is turned into a big deal and is really flipping people out right now
[02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:37.320]  now this may be a ruse where they're really gonna rule for it who knows but
