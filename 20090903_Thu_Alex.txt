[01:17.800 --> 01:25.080]  week I am getting Richard Gage founder of architects and engineers for 9-11
[01:25.080 --> 01:31.960]  Truth on to counter the ridiculous national geographic disinformation
[01:31.960 --> 01:38.720]  piece and professor Stephen Jones and others and I finally have watched most
[01:38.720 --> 01:44.720]  of it it's really hard to watch they spent of course days with the people
[01:44.720 --> 01:50.960]  and just use the few times they were hesitant a few times they would you
[01:50.960 --> 01:57.000]  brush their nose or pick at their fingers it's theater of the mind the
[01:57.000 --> 02:07.800]  language of film and they show some type of watered-down thermite not burned
[02:07.800 --> 02:12.240]  through a steel column when you can watch demonstrations online of a tiny
[02:12.240 --> 02:15.920]  cup full of it burning right through an engine block in seconds and you could
[02:15.920 --> 02:19.760]  see it staged it hardly even sparkles it sparkles for a few seconds it's not
[02:19.760 --> 02:23.840]  what thermite did one pound of real thermite just regular thermite would
[02:23.840 --> 02:29.120]  have just been a devastating flash and just incredible event I mean it's just
[02:29.120 --> 02:35.680]  it's totally staged also years ago a couple years ago it's how long they've
[02:35.680 --> 02:39.560]  been making this film they sent out known disinfo operatives and we've
[02:39.560 --> 02:44.360]  confirmed disinfo operatives dressed up like puff the magic dragon half naked
[02:44.360 --> 02:51.440]  wearing my face over their crotch and we noticed talking to we are changing
[02:51.440 --> 02:54.400]  York that every time the media would show up in an event that was even
[02:54.400 --> 02:57.880]  unannounced they would be there with the media right when the media arrived as
[02:57.880 --> 03:01.960]  part of the staged event and the government just hires clowns and has
[03:01.960 --> 03:06.320]  them dance around acting stupid with a picture of me tied around their genitalia
[03:06.320 --> 03:13.200]  I mean this is this is how the globalist operate this is what they do and it
[03:13.200 --> 03:16.400]  just doesn't work anymore people know whatever the media puts out it's a load
[03:16.400 --> 03:22.840]  of bull and you guys have no credibility and the whole thing is just a
[03:22.840 --> 03:28.320]  complete lie from end to end when they fire a missile with a pound of plastic
[03:28.320 --> 03:36.320]  explosives into a chicken coop a fiberglass chicken coop they were so
[03:36.320 --> 03:41.120]  lazy they didn't even I haven't been around farm supplies and looked at
[03:41.120 --> 03:45.720]  farming catalogs I know what it is it's a chicken coop it's a segmented
[03:45.720 --> 03:53.160]  rectangular prefab chicken coop and they fire a missile into it and explode a
[03:53.160 --> 03:57.560]  pound of plastic explosive in it and say look a missile would have blown up the
[03:57.560 --> 04:04.880]  whole Pentagon I mean I just I mean it's a new level of ridiculousness oh help us

[04:14.400 --> 04:21.560]  unspeakably ridiculous unspeakably shoddy unspeakably disjointed and edited
[04:21.560 --> 04:28.440]  together mismatched it's just I mean it's so shoddy that the formatting is even
[04:28.440 --> 04:32.680]  screwed up the magazine is like a millimeter thick now I remember this
[04:32.680 --> 04:37.360]  thing like 10 years ago was huge the whole thing is psychotropic drug ads

[06:04.120 --> 06:08.720]  troops I went to grounds here and we knew what to do at least we thought we
[06:08.720 --> 06:13.600]  did truth rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders
[06:13.600 --> 06:20.800]  a platform to tell their story Whitman EPA director on the 18th made a
[06:20.800 --> 06:26.400]  statement that the air was safe to breathe this film follows the growing

[06:55.080 --> 06:59.760]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law there's a guy
[06:59.760 --> 07:03.220]  named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio
[07:03.220 --> 07:07.280]  stations he got laid off from a job he loved many years ago he was devastated
[07:07.280 --> 07:11.160]  but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job
[07:11.160 --> 07:14.760]  for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day there
[07:14.760 --> 07:19.320]  is no job security you are always in danger of losing your job unless you
[07:19.320 --> 07:23.320]  take charge of your livelihood and own your own business since you are the boss
[07:23.320 --> 07:28.960]  nobody can fire you so MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is
[07:28.960 --> 07:33.400]  passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for
[07:33.400 --> 07:37.560]  themselves and not for others MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home
[07:37.560 --> 07:41.160]  business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate
[07:41.160 --> 07:44.880]  that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding
[07:44.880 --> 07:49.720]  monthly income visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity
[07:49.720 --> 07:54.360]  that's chocolate.ownmyself.com it takes very little money and if you're
[07:54.360 --> 08:00.800]  interested MZ wants to talk to you remember chocolate.ownmyself.com
[08:00.800 --> 08:17.040]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:17.040 --> 08:25.760]  okay CNN ABC News CBS they're all freaking out over Pastor Stephen Anderson
[08:25.760 --> 08:31.160]  out in Arizona remember he's the guy that's sick of the internal checkpoints
[08:31.160 --> 08:39.000]  and got beat up by the Border Patrol and that has a process of quote radicalizing
[08:39.000 --> 08:49.120]  people and he was praying that Barack Obama basically be cursed or died and
[08:49.120 --> 08:52.960]  that is biblical I mean there are instances in the old and New Testament
[08:52.960 --> 08:58.160]  things like that going on I politically wouldn't do it because it's
[08:58.160 --> 09:02.640]  certainly used as hay by the establishment to make Obama the victim
[09:02.640 --> 09:08.920]  Obama is a complete and total absolute nothing puppet reading off a teleprompter
[09:08.920 --> 09:14.440]  and obsessing on him and making him the leader is what the establishment wants
[09:14.440 --> 09:19.000]  because they can politically destroy him later and then just put in the next
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.440]  puppet but we're gonna get Pastor Steve Anderson's take on this and and
[09:23.440 --> 09:30.200]  CNN's also very closely editing it out of context and then they tie it in to
[09:30.200 --> 09:36.320]  Chris one of his parishioners one of his members one of his flock at his church
[09:36.320 --> 09:42.040]  and I've seen Pastor Anderson sermons I think it's really doctrinally very good
[09:42.040 --> 09:53.640]  stuff and very Baptist in every sense very founding father type essence but we
[09:53.640 --> 09:57.880]  do have to realize in this media age how things are distorted and it is Chris
[09:57.880 --> 10:01.680]  who we've interviewed here who you know had the AR 15 strapped to his back which
[10:01.680 --> 10:05.840]  if you understand there's people who concealed carries everywhere and then
[10:05.840 --> 10:10.440]  under common law an open arm is legal a hidden arm is illegal that's why they
[10:10.440 --> 10:13.120]  give you a permit for concealed carry because the government only has a
[10:13.120 --> 10:18.280]  jurisdiction over restricting concealed weapons under common law it's highly
[10:18.280 --> 10:23.600]  illegal because you can't see him it's the person who bears their arms openly
[10:23.600 --> 10:27.760]  that you can trust is Cicero and others said the Roman philosopher Roman
[10:27.760 --> 10:32.400]  historian and as our founding father said 200 plus years ago the person
[10:32.400 --> 10:47.360]  hiding their arms what do you think you shake hands why do you think that the
[10:47.360 --> 10:55.960]  ancient doesn't matter of your Chinese Middle Eastern Russian African Nordic
[10:55.960 --> 11:05.720]  in every society Aztec Mayan Toltec Olmec you shake hands in fact in most
[11:05.720 --> 11:11.440]  cultures you walk up and hold your hands up and say hail or skull if you're
[11:11.440 --> 11:18.720]  Nordic and so the idea of putting your hands up and out and saying hail friend
[11:18.720 --> 11:25.920]  hello friend I am a friend look my hands are open hands up and then you shake
[11:25.920 --> 11:29.800]  their hand or grab them by the elbow and shake them means I am your friend
[11:29.800 --> 11:32.960]  like it's like dogs running up and smelling each other's noses and then
[11:32.960 --> 11:37.400]  going around and checking the back then and you know reading the mail saying
[11:37.400 --> 11:43.080]  hey are this dog's glands telling me it's getting ready to bite me is this dog
[11:43.080 --> 11:49.720]  putting off aggression pheromone same thing with humans so weapons openly is
[11:49.720 --> 11:54.120]  the mark of a free society weapons hidden is the mark of the criminal now I'm
[11:54.120 --> 11:57.720]  not criticizing anybody it's got a concealed carry I understand why you
[11:57.720 --> 12:01.120]  do it in a restricted second amendment area but just understand what they're
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.800]  doing and so that's why anybody who understands second amendment culture in
[12:05.800 --> 12:11.600]  the freedom culture it's asinine that's why the police in Arizona or been around
[12:11.600 --> 12:15.120]  can open carry forever they understand it and to them it's good to see somebody
[12:15.120 --> 12:20.440]  with a gun out in the open with a strap to their back because they understand
[12:20.440 --> 12:25.000]  what that means they're looking for people with hidden weapons because that's
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.800]  who's gonna strike just like a viper just like a just like a coral snakes got
[12:30.800 --> 12:37.040]  those fangs up in the roof of its mouth hidden but we're gonna be talking about
[12:37.040 --> 12:40.640]  that coming up in 15 minutes with pastor Stephen Anderson fact while we're at
[12:40.640 --> 12:45.200]  it let's just try to see we can call Chris or call Anderson maybe Chris can
[12:45.200 --> 12:52.480]  pop in for five minutes we'll break that down I've got national media calling me
[12:52.480 --> 12:57.280]  up asking me to comment on this tomorrow and over the weekend on national
[12:57.280 --> 13:01.960]  news shows and so I'm gonna go on and talk about this I thought I might
[13:01.960 --> 13:06.480]  actually talk to the people themselves so I can really get what they had to say
[13:06.480 --> 13:13.480]  without it being a sound bite so that is coming up Steve quails coming on about
[13:13.480 --> 13:18.840]  the whole flu situation that my wife has old college friends and high school
[13:18.840 --> 13:24.880]  friends and friends we have in Austin that are particularly into the whole real
[13:24.880 --> 13:29.200]  reality movement calling her up saying what's going on with the flu why what's
[13:29.200 --> 13:33.400]  the what's the scoop I will try to give you a full spectrum analysis of what's
[13:33.400 --> 13:37.160]  happening and break it down with Steve quail coming up in the second hour
[13:37.160 --> 13:46.320]  today okay and then for 30 minutes in the last hour Daryl Castle VP running mate
[13:46.320 --> 13:52.920]  with Constitution Party Chuck Baldwin he is popping in we might as well just go
[13:52.920 --> 13:56.440]  ahead and get Baldwin to pop in with him I know I'm like stacking gas on top of
[13:56.440 --> 14:00.040]  my producers but that's a good idea about well Daryl Castles on because he
[14:00.040 --> 14:04.040]  attended the Mayak hearings in Missouri shingan owners veterans or what
[14:04.040 --> 14:09.040]  homeland securities for that we're the real terror threat so that's coming in
[14:09.040 --> 14:12.360]  the last 30 minutes at prison planet dot TV while we're live on the radio
[14:12.360 --> 14:18.560]  simulcasting on TV my wife read the psychology today article yesterday she
[14:18.560 --> 14:21.760]  made a lot of observations I hadn't thought to make Rob Jacobson made a
[14:21.760 --> 14:26.800]  bunch here at the office yesterday and the points they made are even more
[14:26.800 --> 14:32.480]  stunning and cutting to the bone and when I said I mean these are people that
[14:32.480 --> 14:36.880]  push drugs on kids these are people that prey on children and depressed people
[14:36.880 --> 14:42.160]  and and and they know that the adult populations woken up with you know the
[14:42.160 --> 14:45.400]  one who flew over the cuckoo's nest and the reality and the tyranny of the
[14:45.400 --> 14:50.520]  Soviets and the Nazis and the communist Chinese using psychiatry as a form of
[14:50.520 --> 14:54.320]  oppression and the eugenicist using it to sterilize Native Americans and others
[14:54.320 --> 14:59.720]  in this country but my wife flipped it open and said look at the page right
[14:59.720 --> 15:06.440]  before page 38 where your story starts page 36 and 37 are a two-page full page
[15:06.440 --> 15:11.520]  ad for a drug company and right there in big bold and we had to fight for this
[15:11.520 --> 15:15.400]  over the last 15 years and they would call his conspiracy theorist and laugh
[15:15.400 --> 15:19.280]  at us but it came out in the prozac trials in the early 80s it caused
[15:19.280 --> 15:23.640]  massive suicide increases and so now all serotonin reuptake inhibitor
[15:23.640 --> 15:28.280]  fluoride chlorine molecule it's chemical weapon makes you hallucinate because it's
[15:28.280 --> 15:32.160]  killing brain cells you're having a good trip everything's fine you have every
[15:32.160 --> 15:35.640]  woman that chops her kids arms off or drowns them or every school shooting
[15:35.640 --> 15:40.240]  they're on this stuff and there's this
[15:40.240 --> 15:46.520]  Lamec toll candy they're now putting it in a candy that tastes good and dissolves
[15:46.520 --> 15:52.400]  in your mouth and it says right here Lamec toll ODT may cause suicidal thoughts
[15:52.400 --> 15:58.080]  or actions in a very small number of people only one in 500 so you got 20
[15:58.080 --> 16:04.080]  million people on this stuff and that's tens of thousands call a health care
[16:04.080 --> 16:07.640]  provider right away if you have worsening depression any unusual changes in
[16:07.640 --> 16:12.240]  mood or behavior or thoughts or actions about suicide self-harm especially if
[16:12.240 --> 16:17.040]  they are new worse or worry you see medication guy you read the full thing
[16:17.040 --> 16:22.080]  delusions of grandeur psychopathic activity bloodlust literal the
[16:22.080 --> 16:26.160]  scientific terms for when you read into the literature and vamp vampirism you
[16:26.160 --> 16:33.360]  want to bite people and then they've got another add in here for another drug
[16:33.360 --> 16:45.000]  that you take for the psychotic reaction you have to the psychotropic and
[16:45.000 --> 16:50.800]  they've got an article in here about the New World Order and this is just I mean
[16:50.800 --> 16:55.880]  and this whole magazine is about acting cool and being cool and using psychology
[16:55.880 --> 16:59.520]  to manipulate people and really I mean not all psychologists because there's
[16:59.520 --> 17:03.280]  some really good stuff like Carl Jung and others out there I mean a lot of
[17:03.280 --> 17:07.120]  discoveries have been made some of it is legitimate and real the problem is
[17:07.120 --> 17:11.240]  there's so many control freaks and perverts and weirdos statistically the
[17:11.240 --> 17:14.560]  highest rate of suicide of any profession is psychiatrists and
[17:14.560 --> 17:19.160]  psychologists they're constantly caught raping their people hypnotizing them
[17:19.160 --> 17:24.920]  drugging them I mean this is a group of weirdos on average it's like saying most
[17:24.920 --> 17:28.400]  truancy officers aren't pedophiles but you find the highest level of pedophiles
[17:28.400 --> 17:32.840]  in that group if you read the mainline criminology because if you're a pedophile
[17:32.840 --> 17:37.560]  what what do you want to do you want to be someone who deals with kids they
[17:37.560 --> 17:40.920]  always are catching pedophile investigators and the heads of the
[17:40.920 --> 17:46.920]  anti-pedophile groups now being pedophiles because again I'm not saying
[17:46.920 --> 17:51.720]  that even 10% of them are pedophiles but but but you know maybe one out of a
[17:51.720 --> 17:56.940]  thousand people in the general public's a pedophile one out of ten with a CPS
[17:56.940 --> 18:03.440]  worker and I've seen the numbers they vary some are as many as one in five CPS
[18:03.440 --> 18:08.400]  workers truancy workers jailguards I mean I've been in juvenile hall one
[18:08.400 --> 18:17.320]  time for fighting and while I was in there my one big experience was the
[18:17.320 --> 18:25.080]  jail guard tried to rape me and I didn't go along with it and I said I'm gonna
[18:25.080 --> 18:29.000]  fight you and then my dad's gonna probably kill you and the guy backed off
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.560]  and said you know shove my head in the wall and said well whatever you don't
[18:32.560 --> 18:36.960]  get to come out you don't get showers while you're here but I was only in
[18:36.960 --> 18:41.960]  there about a week or so that was not fun well what happens is you get in a
[18:41.960 --> 18:44.520]  fight with somebody they even if they start to fight with you the cops get
[18:44.520 --> 18:48.000]  there and somebody's knocked out with blood coming out their ears they go
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  ahead and arrest you and then the court date had to come up and you know I had
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.760]  to have witnesses because they were in the grand jury had to know whether they
[18:54.760 --> 19:03.040]  were gonna indict me or you know any of this crap but the point is is that my
[19:03.040 --> 19:11.480]  one experience my one long experience I guess there was rock wall Dallas and
[19:11.480 --> 19:20.880]  in Terrell but in the Terrell jail up on top the courthouse it was not fun I
[19:20.880 --> 19:25.440]  will just tell you that and then about two days after they this guy tried to
[19:25.440 --> 19:31.600]  rape me in the showers the jail guard another one took me out and took me up
[19:31.600 --> 19:36.240]  to help do laundry and started hitting on me that was another but he was more
[19:36.240 --> 19:41.400]  nice about it and I said look I like women sir I'm 16 years old I like women
[19:41.400 --> 19:46.160]  I don't really find a ball headed fat guy attractive I'm sorry and nothing

[24:19.200 --> 24:24.200]  Paul Watson's written two big articles little piece of me
[24:24.200 --> 24:33.800]  he's written two big articles on the psychology today piece but we should just
[24:33.800 --> 24:41.640]  do a whole piece about psychiatry and psychologists both camps the fake doctor
[24:41.640 --> 24:49.560]  camp and then the other little sub mind control Sven golly camp about how they
[24:49.560 --> 24:54.880]  helped run the torture all over Iraq black sites all over Europe central Asia
[24:54.880 --> 25:01.680]  and Abu Ghraib of course and then camp x-ray admittedly and it was all
[25:01.680 --> 25:06.960]  sexual stuff and perverted stuff and dressing up in devil outfits and raping
[25:06.960 --> 25:12.800]  people and putting blood on them and I mean they're just a bunch of weirdos and
[25:12.800 --> 25:15.960]  that's why they're constantly going insane constantly killing their families
[25:15.960 --> 25:20.160]  I mean you look at this psychology day and look at these psychologists they all
[25:20.160 --> 25:25.440]  look like complete lunatics just their photographs they look like weak control
[25:25.440 --> 25:29.240]  freaks and they want to learn how to manipulate people they want to learn
[25:29.240 --> 25:35.200]  how to play games with people they're just idiots but see they know that
[25:35.200 --> 25:38.520]  adults are awakening to them they know that they're very unpopular in every
[25:38.520 --> 25:42.000]  major poll so they go in with the government and target school kids and
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.200]  say oh yeah you're 12 you're just now getting boyfriends and girlfriends you're
[25:46.200 --> 25:50.320]  depressed now you got some zits on your face you're going through rites of
[25:50.320 --> 25:54.120]  passage you're getting beat up by bullies all of that's normal all that
[25:54.120 --> 25:59.080]  makes you stronger we're gonna give you death education now and then suicide
[25:59.080 --> 26:03.240]  explodes and they come in with more drugs and more death education giving
[26:03.240 --> 26:06.320]  them drugs that make them think about committing suicide and then teaching them
[26:06.320 --> 26:10.120]  how to commit suicide don't tie a shoelace around your neck don't hang
[26:10.120 --> 26:13.720]  yourself this way don't take pills this way and then people wonder why in mass
[26:13.720 --> 26:16.800]  kids are committing suicide and the government makes a whole industry out
[26:16.800 --> 26:21.440]  of it and it turns out they knew that early death education federally funded
[26:21.440 --> 26:31.760]  first school was Columbine 1990 covered in the early 1990s by 2020 TV they knew
[26:31.760 --> 26:38.960]  all this they teach your 10 11 12 13 14 year olds how to commit suicide and then
[26:38.960 --> 26:45.240]  in the name of it and then right after death education the little girls go
[26:45.240 --> 26:50.600]  particularly and hang themselves and you send your kids to these death camps
[26:50.600 --> 26:54.560]  where they teach your kids how to spy on you how to tattle on you how to write
[26:54.560 --> 26:58.760]  reports on what's in your medicine cabinet cameras in the bathrooms cameras in
[26:58.760 --> 27:02.640]  the school rooms drug dogs police in there everybody being trained how to be
[27:02.640 --> 27:08.720]  slaves getting your kids into the welfare system the criminal justice system
[27:08.720 --> 27:14.400]  teaching them how to be fad driven mindless and hollow forcing inoculations
[27:14.400 --> 27:19.760]  on them through color of law fraud and then you read and it's just every other
[27:19.760 --> 27:30.320]  page I mean every two or three pages there's another drug ad in here and it
[27:30.320 --> 27:37.280]  just goes on and on and on man Cal Muller is coming on because I want to talk
[27:37.280 --> 27:42.760]  to him about several subjects then we've got Pastor Steve Anderson coming up
[27:42.760 --> 27:47.360]  next hour we'll probably get Chris on with him and then we've also got to
[27:47.360 --> 27:54.120]  Darrell Castle running mate to Constitution Party presidential candidate
[27:54.120 --> 27:59.840]  Chuck Baldwin coming on he attended the Missouri Mayak Committee reports there
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.360]  in the State House so we're gonna be going over that and Steve Quayle is
[28:04.360 --> 28:07.880]  actually coming up in two hours I are an hour and a half from now now I got my
[28:07.880 --> 28:12.040]  times off so it's Pastor Steve Anderson next hour Steve Quayle hour after that
[28:12.040 --> 28:16.160]  and Darrell Castle after that and I'm gonna break down the last 30 minutes the
[28:16.160 --> 28:20.080]  psychology today that I just got into a little bit but I want to on TV go over
[28:20.080 --> 28:26.360]  this and zoom in for the TV audience not just the radio audience so you can
[28:26.360 --> 28:30.560]  actually see the drug ads because seeing is even more powerful than me just up
[28:30.560 --> 28:34.000]  here talking about it psychology today will probably write an article saying
[28:34.000 --> 28:39.640]  I'm delusional there's not drug ads in their magazine and it doesn't say that
[28:39.640 --> 28:44.080]  it makes you commit suicide and then if you get angry and say it does so say
[28:44.080 --> 28:48.280]  that they'll just say oh he got angry he's schizophrenic this article basically
[28:48.280 --> 28:53.000]  says I'm schizophrenic there's no plans for eugenics no population reduction
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.160]  doesn't matter if it's in the Associated Press and BBC doesn't matter if it's all
[28:57.160 --> 29:01.960]  out in the news doesn't matter if it's all confirmed there's no world government
[29:01.960 --> 29:10.240]  no bank of the world being formed through the G20 none of it's happening I it's
[29:10.240 --> 29:14.320]  it says I must have a chemical imbalance and then they just list the chemical
[29:14.320 --> 29:17.040]  that I'm they haven't tested my blood they haven't tested my brain they haven't
[29:17.040 --> 29:21.120]  biopsied my brain but it just says that Jones sees patterns in things probably
[29:21.120 --> 29:24.840]  because of this chemical level in his brain and he's completely insane a
[29:24.840 --> 29:34.080]  schizophrenic and he's calling for violence absolute lie but hey no these
[29:34.080 --> 29:38.360]  guys know they're praying on people and they don't care what you think they're
[29:38.360 --> 29:43.320]  running a mind control guild praying on your children pushing drugs on them in
[29:43.320 --> 29:47.000]  the public schools and teaching them how to commit suicide and business is darn
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.360]  good the more your kids die the more they get to come in and take over we're on

[32:08.560 --> 32:12.160]  the current administration is committed to nationalizing health care giving 40
[32:12.160 --> 32:15.800]  million new people free care now here's the bad news the current system will
[32:15.800 --> 32:19.280]  almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and
[32:19.280 --> 32:23.080]  procedures Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt many doctors are now
[32:23.080 --> 32:26.800]  leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures all
[32:26.800 --> 32:30.920]  this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in
[32:30.920 --> 32:34.480]  the health care services folks it's time to be prepared for the worst our
[32:34.480 --> 32:37.800]  friends at solutions from science have recently come up with an emergency

[33:30.360 --> 33:36.720]  prisonplanet.tv for the balance of the rest of the broadcast today coming up I
[33:36.720 --> 33:41.320]  have Pastor Steven Anderson that's made international headlines saying that
[33:41.320 --> 33:46.680]  he's praying that Obama dies I think that's a mistake but I think Pastor
[33:46.680 --> 33:50.840]  Anderson who we've talked to many times is a good guy I understand that's in the
[33:50.840 --> 33:55.720]  Bible it's biblical but it really plays into the hands of the establishment
[33:55.720 --> 33:59.560]  wanted to crack down on our liberties but Pastor Anderson's coming up we'll
[33:59.560 --> 34:03.760]  discuss it because I got the national media calling me wanting me to go on
[34:03.760 --> 34:07.600]  national TV and comment on it I want to just hear in little clips and edited
[34:07.600 --> 34:11.240]  soundbites we got Pastor Anderson coming on here and we're probably gonna have
[34:11.240 --> 34:16.360]  Chris back on to the black gentleman with the AR-15 on his back he goes to
[34:16.360 --> 34:20.320]  Pastor Anderson's church I didn't really point that out when I knew it a few
[34:20.320 --> 34:25.040]  weeks ago I was kind of cringing knowing the media would probably find it but
[34:25.040 --> 34:30.640]  now it's all over CNN Fox all over ABC CBS that's coming up we got Steve Quell
[34:30.640 --> 34:34.600]  coming on about the flu the quarantines the force inoculations the government
[34:34.600 --> 34:37.800]  now admits they're gearing up for this I don't know if they're gonna carry it out
[34:37.800 --> 34:42.680]  but they're certainly saying they plan to so that's coming up too but for the
[34:42.680 --> 34:48.520]  next 25 minutes or so man Cal Muller syndicated radio talk show host joins us
[34:48.520 --> 34:52.200]  talk about a host of issues but originally I wanted to get him on because
[34:52.200 --> 34:58.360]  the British news and the US news has been reporting they rich groups rich rent
[34:58.360 --> 35:05.400]  big big former palaces hotels and they have big satanic orgies and do open
[35:05.400 --> 35:11.360]  ceremonies and and the British news has been reporting on this San Francisco
[35:11.360 --> 35:16.240]  Chronicle reported on them drinking blood defecating on stage the mayor
[35:16.240 --> 35:20.640]  involved you know years ago I mean this stuff really happens eyes wide shut is
[35:20.640 --> 35:24.760]  based on Bohemian Grove and other real events that I've actually infiltrated
[35:24.760 --> 35:28.840]  and skull and bones but those are homo erotic skull and bones Bohemian Grove
[35:28.840 --> 35:35.760]  this is with women but equally bizarre man Cal because he's influential in TV
[35:35.760 --> 35:39.840]  show host and radio host he got invited to one so I wanted him on about that
[35:39.840 --> 35:43.200]  that's coming up in a few minutes though I wanted to discuss first something
[35:43.200 --> 35:48.040]  he's been talking about and that's Van Jones and other people in Obama and
[35:48.040 --> 35:53.640]  Rahm Emanuel introducing legislation for forced compulsory service asking the
[35:53.640 --> 35:58.600]  Obama people to go knock on doors and twist people's arms and the White House
[35:58.600 --> 36:03.560]  was gonna have a national telecast to public schools called Obama education
[36:03.560 --> 36:08.200]  asking the kids to rally and support his agenda and to speak to their parents
[36:08.200 --> 36:11.560]  now you dovetail that we have all these clips coming up the next hour I'm gonna
[36:11.560 --> 36:16.400]  play them with Obama's are shock admission we have the clip coming up
[36:16.400 --> 36:21.520]  green jobs goal is complete revolution a takeover of the economy and end of
[36:21.520 --> 36:27.600]  capitalism and to get the youth and admitting communism this isn't me this
[36:27.600 --> 36:32.120]  is a czar and then that dovetails with Al Gore saying your parents are
[36:32.120 --> 36:37.440]  backwards question their beliefs your parents are like people against ending
[36:37.440 --> 36:42.000]  segregation so there is an attempt to take over the kids now Obama's in
[36:42.000 --> 36:47.200]  retreat now cancelling his Hitler youth newscast but then I had media matters
[36:47.200 --> 36:50.480]  attacked me last week along with rush limbaugh and glimback saying we're
[36:50.480 --> 36:55.160]  liars no one has ever called for this when the legislation is introduced
[36:55.160 --> 36:59.840]  man Cal Muller give us your take on this well I look Obama is still gonna
[36:59.840 --> 37:03.600]  speak to the kids they have they have pulled back on some of what they were
[37:03.600 --> 37:06.360]  gonna do they were gonna ask children afterwards and this was gonna be
[37:06.360 --> 37:11.200]  mandatory for everybody from kindergarten to you know about graduating
[37:11.200 --> 37:13.880]  high school that that they would have to sit through this
[37:13.880 --> 37:17.620]  uh... Obama agenda it is it is uh... you you picture this in
[37:17.620 --> 37:20.640]  it has something called pop would do or something that little kid would do
[37:20.640 --> 37:22.440]  kim jong-il over north korea
[37:22.440 --> 37:25.320]  and you would then have to uh...
[37:25.320 --> 37:29.160]  every child in public schools in america would then have to write what can i do
[37:29.160 --> 37:31.800]  to help obama what do i think of what obama
[37:31.800 --> 37:34.360]  of what obama had to say and uh...
[37:34.360 --> 37:38.360]  uh... parents have reacted very strongly so now they have softened it but uh...
[37:38.360 --> 37:42.080]  yeah that the the agenda if you know alex it's so funny to me when we're
[37:42.080 --> 37:44.140]  talking about fascists or communists or
[37:44.140 --> 37:47.080]  or a radical kenyan muslims without birth certificate or whatever your
[37:47.080 --> 37:49.400]  audience wants to think about it
[37:49.400 --> 37:52.220]  but but certainly these are big government people
[37:52.220 --> 37:56.520]  and have they've been lost on the irony of calling everybody's are
[37:56.520 --> 38:01.120]  i think they're not no irony they name everybody's are hysterical to me but i
[38:01.120 --> 38:05.760]  mean chris mathews says if you question twenty six aides when people question
[38:05.760 --> 38:08.380]  that under bush when she had like fifteen
[38:08.380 --> 38:11.040]  or if you question polosi's jumbo jet
[38:11.040 --> 38:15.200]  it's racism they're playing the race card to inject it and i want you to
[38:15.200 --> 38:16.500]  comment on this
[38:16.500 --> 38:17.880]  and then now
[38:17.880 --> 38:20.820]  all over the news they're saying we're liars
[38:20.820 --> 38:25.320]  there's no call for compulsory youth when rama manual the white house chief of
[38:25.320 --> 38:26.040]  staff
[38:26.040 --> 38:29.960]  is on c span not once not twice but three times
[38:29.960 --> 38:35.120]  obama's on tv five times we've dug out all the videos saying he wants compulsory
[38:35.120 --> 38:36.160]  military
[38:36.160 --> 38:37.080]  domestic
[38:37.080 --> 38:38.280]  uh... service
[38:38.280 --> 38:39.840]  uh... to him
[38:39.840 --> 38:44.120]  and then now he wants your kids to line up where he's on a jumbo tron like
[38:44.120 --> 38:49.360]  something out of nineteen eighty four or actual malice malice china and then
[38:49.360 --> 38:54.760]  they say we're racist liars this is outrageous yeah well i mean we're
[38:54.760 --> 38:58.040]  just gonna be very easy for this president uh... i i saw when i had ten
[38:58.040 --> 39:00.000]  thousand people show up for my tea party
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.720]  i've attended uh... two of these town hall meetings about health care of course
[39:03.720 --> 39:05.400]  if you dare to question uh...
[39:05.400 --> 39:09.120]  air obama you're you're called a racist ridiculous but yeah this would have been
[39:09.120 --> 39:11.400]  uh... they wanted kids to uh...
[39:11.400 --> 39:14.920]  to write letters every kid in public schools how to help the president
[39:14.920 --> 39:18.320]  uh... and and then after the speech they were
[39:18.320 --> 39:21.200]  they were supposed to talk about here's the subject what the president wants for
[39:21.200 --> 39:21.880]  me
[39:21.880 --> 39:25.240]  the big video screens everything you're talking about look uh... america is
[39:25.240 --> 39:26.760]  getting wise to it alex
[39:26.760 --> 39:29.640]  you need to know this you need to buy it very depressed and then i went to the
[39:29.640 --> 39:31.440]  town hall meetings that went out on the street
[39:31.440 --> 39:34.640]  hope and change have worked in the creepy overreaching
[39:34.640 --> 39:37.360]  comic boy here out of my city of chicago
[39:37.360 --> 39:42.040]  is no longer fooling america look at dogby look at rap music cnn i mean cnn
[39:42.040 --> 39:42.920]  come on
[39:42.920 --> 39:46.520]  uh... comic news network right there cnn today is saying that uh...
[39:46.520 --> 39:48.240]  he's lost independence
[39:48.240 --> 39:51.280]  i understand people not wanting to be part of what bush was doing the big
[39:51.280 --> 39:52.680]  spending the republicans
[39:52.680 --> 39:55.360]  i was i was a second bush of spending
[39:55.360 --> 39:58.440]  but uh... so who are you who are you going to identify with this
[39:58.440 --> 40:01.720]  this democratic party independence gave this guy a shot
[40:01.720 --> 40:05.880]  he overreached and i think they're ready to send him and his uh... his strong
[40:05.880 --> 40:06.840]  arm
[40:06.840 --> 40:09.080]  balloons back to chicago
[40:09.080 --> 40:11.320]  man cal i agree with you but i don't
[40:11.320 --> 40:14.360]  i want your take on this i think the real reason
[40:14.360 --> 40:18.360]  if you really study the rest music in gallup polls he's as low as thirty nine
[40:18.360 --> 40:20.920]  in many different graphics is highest demographic
[40:20.920 --> 40:25.920]  is forty five in these different polls but the average is about forty two
[40:25.920 --> 40:28.480]  he's he's losing close to a point a week
[40:28.480 --> 40:30.560]  this is the fastest drop
[40:30.560 --> 40:34.320]  of any president eight-and-a-half months into their administration sense gallup
[40:34.320 --> 40:36.000]  and rass music existed
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.560]  so and so so so this is record crashing and burning because people are finding
[40:40.560 --> 40:42.000]  out he's a hoax
[40:42.000 --> 40:45.920]  the evidence i'm getting is the reason people are really waking up to him even
[40:45.920 --> 40:48.920]  his former supporters and hardcore liberals
[40:48.920 --> 40:50.120]  is that they
[40:50.120 --> 40:54.320]  realize he says he isn't for gun control but the bills are all public
[40:54.320 --> 40:56.420]  he says he doesn't want to restrict free speech
[40:56.420 --> 40:59.640]  i'll come out the bills are introduced he says he doesn't want
[40:59.640 --> 41:04.120]  uh... hitler you can but the the the bills are introduced and he's calling
[41:04.120 --> 41:08.400]  for them to stand in stadiums before jumbotron and they have been marching
[41:08.400 --> 41:09.200]  orders and
[41:09.200 --> 41:11.000]  i mean i i i i i i i i like
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.760]  alex can i play a little something for you down the phone line here
[41:13.760 --> 41:16.800]  sure go ahead and i mean you know this is one of my favorite moments uh...
[41:16.800 --> 41:18.260]  from from all of our
[41:18.260 --> 41:25.260]  we're not going to have a lot of work
[41:34.280 --> 41:37.560]  they wanted to start like a crystal-knocked with me the acorn goons were
[41:37.560 --> 41:40.120]  there when we had you know we had ten thousand people that are sick of high
[41:40.120 --> 41:41.080]  taxes
[41:41.080 --> 41:43.120]  the same people by the way we're fed up under
[41:43.120 --> 41:45.480]  uh... bush we're sick of the big spending
[41:45.480 --> 41:49.800]  uh... yeah i don't know if i want a private army to do his bidding it is
[41:49.800 --> 41:52.120]  frightening at the same thing with these cars
[41:52.120 --> 41:55.400]  these cars are not elected they do whatever they want about the diversity
[41:55.400 --> 41:56.880]  are with the fbc
[41:56.880 --> 42:00.440]  who uh... came out that he had my or shot that and i'll show that destroyed
[42:00.440 --> 42:01.160]  radio
[42:01.160 --> 42:04.920]  now today this new senate bill i'm i'm sure alex jones
[42:04.920 --> 42:07.920]  is already uh... all over but they are declaring
[42:07.920 --> 42:11.320]  that under a cyber security emergency what what that is that they're not going
[42:11.320 --> 42:12.920]  to say but basically
[42:12.920 --> 42:14.920]  the president
[42:14.920 --> 42:17.160]  i i love all these young people all about this
[42:17.160 --> 42:19.480]  he's cute he can read a teleprompter
[42:19.480 --> 42:22.800]  uh... and they they love that this was the first internet american idol
[42:22.800 --> 42:23.760]  president
[42:23.760 --> 42:26.960]  and i wonder if the youth that were so enamored with obama even though they
[42:26.960 --> 42:29.080]  don't know history anything he stands for
[42:29.080 --> 42:30.120]  the fact that this
[42:30.120 --> 42:32.840]  president is trying to see the internet i wonder
[42:32.840 --> 42:35.240]  i wonder seriously if his comrades will wake up
[42:35.240 --> 42:37.200]  yet we must take the internet
[42:37.200 --> 42:39.400]  uh... i mean you know click your heels together
[42:39.400 --> 42:40.800]  hi all obama
[42:40.800 --> 42:44.280]  this is uh... israel and it is frightening
[42:44.280 --> 42:48.400]  no absolutely and and and that's my point is that he denies his agenda
[42:48.400 --> 42:50.600]  while it rolls forward
[42:50.600 --> 42:51.880]  and
[42:51.880 --> 42:55.320]  i think it's going to cause revolution in this country and i think that's what
[42:55.320 --> 42:58.520]  the social engineers want but i don't want to go out
[42:58.520 --> 43:00.120]  they want to get violent
[43:00.120 --> 43:02.840]  i don't want to get violent i i don't want to get violent i want people to
[43:02.840 --> 43:03.560]  wake up
[43:03.560 --> 43:06.720]  i want the men of america i know there's estrogen in our water bottles and i
[43:06.720 --> 43:08.400]  feel a lot of feminized men
[43:08.400 --> 43:11.920]  i'd like men to uh... to grow with that i'd like men to be men again
[43:11.920 --> 43:15.120]  and both these clouds out of office and let's get back to cowboy logic
[43:15.120 --> 43:18.480]  and common sense i don't want any blood to be shed
[43:18.480 --> 43:21.840]  well i agree with you and i think the establishment
[43:21.840 --> 43:26.520]  all over the country we've got their unions on video coming up and beating
[43:26.520 --> 43:28.880]  people beating
[43:28.880 --> 43:32.200]  well black people that are against the government takeover of health care
[43:32.200 --> 43:34.320]  attacking women and now
[43:34.320 --> 43:36.600]  uh... in california
[43:36.600 --> 43:41.120]  a a a a a pro obama person went into the crowd
[43:41.120 --> 43:42.280]  attacked
[43:42.280 --> 43:43.720]  this man and bit
[43:43.720 --> 43:45.520]  his finger off
[43:45.520 --> 43:47.720]  but the it's a little bit
[43:47.720 --> 43:49.400]  but but i mean i mean listen
[43:49.400 --> 43:54.360]  i have been reading their websites they are saying burn my house down the the
[43:54.360 --> 43:56.200]  the obama supporters are saying
[43:56.200 --> 43:57.680]  come after me
[43:57.680 --> 44:01.040]  uh... i know they're saying come after other people they're saying get us off
[44:01.040 --> 44:02.080]  the air
[44:02.080 --> 44:04.320]  uh... they're trying to bully the owner
[44:04.320 --> 44:08.120]  of uh... whole food saying he doesn't have a first amendment i mean they
[44:08.120 --> 44:11.760]  really are they're trying to boycott
[44:11.760 --> 44:14.640]  about that alex is your wife into the whole whole food swing
[44:14.640 --> 44:15.520]  yes we love it
[44:15.520 --> 44:19.280]  all i mean it's it everything is so expensive and we really found out that
[44:19.280 --> 44:20.360]  organic and
[44:20.360 --> 44:22.920]  at all of these different words they use uh...
[44:22.920 --> 44:26.480]  it's it's uh... it's a lie i think you know everything is going to hurt it's
[44:26.480 --> 44:27.440]  organic
[44:27.440 --> 44:30.760]  uh... but we're willing to pay triple everything my wife is of course
[44:30.760 --> 44:32.560]  you know i i spoiled a woman
[44:32.560 --> 44:35.960]  and she loves whole food and boy every time i'm there some liberal is trying to
[44:35.960 --> 44:37.040]  sell me on some
[44:37.040 --> 44:40.440]  some kind of uh... you know i don't let me put quickly a quick whole food story
[44:40.440 --> 44:42.080]  can i tell it thirty-second
[44:42.080 --> 44:42.720]  sure
[44:42.720 --> 44:44.920]  they want to give up to a dollar
[44:44.920 --> 44:47.800]  to buy school supplies for kids in the ghetto
[44:47.800 --> 44:51.280]  and what we found out is that the money that was given to school supplies the
[44:51.280 --> 44:53.560]  kids in the ghetto they didn't put any restrictions on it
[44:53.560 --> 44:55.320]  so they were buying video games
[44:55.320 --> 44:56.640]  and then tennis shoes
[44:56.640 --> 44:59.480]  so i said i'm not interested the guy who you really should i said sir i'm not
[44:59.480 --> 45:00.320]  interested
[45:00.320 --> 45:03.720]  and he he goes well here's the pamphlet anyway i said sir i don't want the
[45:03.720 --> 45:04.600]  pamphlet
[45:04.600 --> 45:08.760]  so the liberals just love whole food and now their head guy the head of whole
[45:08.760 --> 45:09.400]  food
[45:09.400 --> 45:10.600]  it's his company
[45:10.600 --> 45:13.880]  he's come out that i don't want any part of obama's comic care
[45:13.880 --> 45:16.800]  and now they're upset they're saying boycott whole food but they have no idea
[45:16.800 --> 45:17.680]  where to go
[45:17.680 --> 45:20.240]  it's pretty hilarious really hope they check food
[45:20.240 --> 45:24.120]  where where where the liberals could have been a shop now alex i feel awful
[45:24.120 --> 45:25.480]  for
[45:25.480 --> 45:29.880]  well to be clear man cal uh... cross species genetically engineered
[45:29.880 --> 45:30.680]  crops
[45:30.680 --> 45:34.720]  do have sterilance engineered yeah into the pharmacological
[45:34.720 --> 45:35.960]  yeah and uh...
[45:35.960 --> 45:39.740]  you really think uh... a cucumber whole food is any different from safeway or
[45:39.740 --> 45:41.360]  dominix or any other store
[45:41.360 --> 45:42.800]  if you study
[45:42.800 --> 45:45.360]  no they certainly have some stuff that isn't really organic in there but
[45:45.360 --> 45:49.100]  overall it's better and you're right it is a uh... rickard
[45:49.100 --> 45:52.160]  they charge it all on it is a racket a certain extent but
[45:52.160 --> 45:55.240]  it it it moved us into demanding local
[45:55.240 --> 45:58.840]  and organic and it's the power of choice and i think overall well here's the
[45:58.840 --> 46:01.640]  deal and i think it's a little bit of a man now
[46:01.640 --> 46:06.040]  i'm against the boycott of whole foods because the establishment is trying to
[46:06.040 --> 46:11.240]  boycott rush limbaugh boycott glenbeck boycott whole foods to punish people's
[46:11.240 --> 46:15.040]  first amendment to create a chilling effect so even though i disagree with a
[46:15.040 --> 46:19.240]  lot of what pretty much limbaugh glenbeck say right i'm supporting them
[46:19.240 --> 46:22.280]  well that's right and you know that's what people seem to forget it it's your
[46:22.280 --> 46:24.680]  free speech as long as it's what you like
[46:24.680 --> 46:28.200]  uh... and and it's really gotten frightening it used to be equal rights and
[46:28.200 --> 46:30.840]  all four equal rights but now it's special rights
[46:30.840 --> 46:33.480]  i have two twin daughters as you know four years old
[46:33.480 --> 46:35.840]  and uh... i get because they're white
[46:35.840 --> 46:38.760]  and uh... you know it would have to take it be when they're older and they're not
[46:38.760 --> 46:39.720]  lesbian
[46:39.720 --> 46:41.040]  so so there's no
[46:41.040 --> 46:45.000]  i just don't understand these special laws for people what's a new classism
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.560]  it's a new you know it's it's it's so very evil i mean a hate crime will
[46:48.560 --> 46:51.960]  every time you rape or brutalize somebody to hate crime it's a new class
[46:51.960 --> 46:56.280]  system and and look let me ask you about glenbeck because glenbeck is that is a
[46:56.280 --> 46:59.560]  fan of mine glenbeck likes me he's always been very complimentary
[46:59.560 --> 47:02.920]  i just find him a very disingenuous sometimes although i think he's trying
[47:02.920 --> 47:03.880]  to do good things
[47:03.880 --> 47:06.720]  he just cries a little too much for me i'm more of a man i
[47:06.720 --> 47:09.240]  i don't know what do you think about that i don't know it's listen well he's
[47:09.240 --> 47:10.800]  taking my shtick
[47:10.800 --> 47:14.720]  and then and then adding a lot and no no i was gonna say and then adding the
[47:14.720 --> 47:19.760]  leader hosin weasel behavior i believe is a psiop to discredit the patriot
[47:19.760 --> 47:20.360]  movement
[47:20.360 --> 47:23.400]  wow uh... well now
[47:23.400 --> 47:26.000]  well brother brother that's a huge payment so you think he's actually
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.360]  working against libertarianism and common sense and
[47:29.360 --> 47:33.280]  you you think he's actually no you look you look all i know is
[47:33.280 --> 47:36.560]  i predicted two months before he did it that he would go show the indiana
[47:36.560 --> 47:40.280]  train station the thing we debunked in nineteen ninety six
[47:40.280 --> 47:44.120]  and that he would say that okay there's no fema camps because we went and showed
[47:44.120 --> 47:45.200]  you one
[47:45.200 --> 47:49.520]  of the fake ones out there that's a straw man when we sent glenbeck
[47:49.520 --> 47:52.840]  registered mail and had our listeners emailing by the thousands
[47:52.840 --> 47:54.920]  the civilian inmate labor camp program
[47:54.920 --> 47:57.320]  the houston chronicle the new york times
[47:57.320 --> 48:00.960]  the government purchase orders the congressional hearings on the fema
[48:00.960 --> 48:02.800]  camps the bills introduced
[48:02.800 --> 48:03.560]  and then he had
[48:03.560 --> 48:04.600]  popular
[48:04.600 --> 48:06.880]  uh... whitewash hers publishing
[48:06.880 --> 48:12.040]  uh... yellow journalism uh... captains on to say it didn't exist and he said arrest
[48:12.040 --> 48:14.480]  ron paul supporters use the army on them
[48:14.480 --> 48:19.040]  when ron paul had a chance to win so i see him as a as a benedict arnold yes
[48:19.040 --> 48:22.560]  but wait a minute that then why is the left so against a white wire they
[48:22.560 --> 48:25.720]  against a wire that's a control left-right paradigm
[48:25.720 --> 48:29.480]  and there's certainly there's certainly fishers in the structure
[48:29.480 --> 48:30.680]  and
[48:30.680 --> 48:32.400]  i'm confused
[48:32.400 --> 48:35.760]  but i don't get are you confused by a don king fight were both
[48:35.760 --> 48:39.960]  boxes are bought and paid for no i don't know no look i i was uh... more
[48:39.960 --> 48:43.320]  member more than any junior i was his co-host is the final year it was all

[48:43.960 --> 48:47.080]  i've done uh... over a hundred episodes of springer springer used to broadcast
[48:47.080 --> 48:48.800]  in the building right to my radio show

[48:52.280 --> 48:54.880]  i'd i'd get it i'd get it the republicans
[48:54.880 --> 48:57.800]  and the uh... and the dummy craft are the same
[48:57.800 --> 49:01.880]  the public master the corporations in the globalist i get that
[49:01.880 --> 49:05.720]  well i'm just telling you that i don't i don't know that new concentration camps
[49:05.720 --> 49:07.320]  were real man cow
[49:07.320 --> 49:09.360]  he knew they were real
[49:09.360 --> 49:12.720]  he was given the evidence in and i predicted what he would do
[49:12.720 --> 49:14.600]  i said he's going to do this
[49:14.600 --> 49:16.040]  and he did it
[49:16.040 --> 49:20.880]  uh... and and i want to like when back okay i'm not here to alienate people
[49:20.880 --> 49:24.120]  i know his audience is my audience so i'm defending him
[49:24.120 --> 49:25.760]  because i'm not
[49:25.760 --> 49:27.320]  let them use him
[49:27.320 --> 49:31.520]  uh... you know i don't think i don't know i'd like to put you in the face
[49:31.520 --> 49:37.360]  i don't know i just i just said i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i
[49:37.360 --> 49:39.120]  i look i i uh...
[49:39.120 --> 49:44.040]  yeah i got nothing alex i got nothing i think when back up prances around in a
[49:44.040 --> 49:48.240]  cooking apron and and and and nits because that's what i mean that's okay
[49:48.240 --> 49:50.840]  of mineral you know he's that kind of guy but
[49:50.840 --> 49:52.360]  is that what you're saying man cow
[49:52.360 --> 49:54.760]  but i don't even know what i'm saying anymore
[49:54.760 --> 49:56.640]  alex my head hurts
[49:56.640 --> 50:00.920]  i'm saying that i think uh... i i tend to have real emotion on this program and
[50:00.920 --> 50:02.200]  the people that call
[50:02.200 --> 50:05.640]  i believe her genuine i i and i assume that you're a sincere individual as
[50:05.640 --> 50:06.320]  well
[50:06.320 --> 50:06.920]  i just
[50:06.920 --> 50:10.800]  find it uh... a little bit disingenuous as a guy that's in his TV show and had
[50:10.800 --> 50:13.480]  him on this radio show and he's very complimentary of
[50:13.480 --> 50:17.240]  of me he's been nothing but nice to me so i feel like a jerk but i i think he
[50:17.240 --> 50:18.320]  cries
[50:18.320 --> 50:19.480]  on q
[50:19.480 --> 50:22.880]  and and it's it's a little ridiculous and i think it's a little bit fake
[50:22.880 --> 50:23.920]  uh...
[50:23.920 --> 50:26.360]  and and that's all i was saying i don't know he's meant to discredit the
[50:26.360 --> 50:28.120]  message it's very simple to see

[55:01.680 --> 55:04.400]  were having a lot of fun so i was invited to this party called the
[55:04.400 --> 55:06.880]  sanguine party which is the color of blood

[55:27.040 --> 55:30.240]  was i was led down a corridor there was another corridor
[55:30.240 --> 55:33.840]  there were different chambers i went through and what i walked into
[55:33.840 --> 55:38.480]  was like something out of a horror movie uh there were nuns uh people dressed as
[55:38.480 --> 55:43.840]  nuns with their women um had nuns but with the um
[55:43.840 --> 55:47.520]  the outfits were cut so that their private areas were revealed
[55:47.520 --> 55:50.720]  there was uh one guy who was a uh a very feminine
[55:50.720 --> 55:53.840]  man who was kissing other men and he was dressed as the pope
[55:53.840 --> 55:57.440]  and oh and it was a it was an unbelievable costume and across it
[55:57.440 --> 56:00.640]  uh across the hat the work done was written
[56:00.640 --> 56:04.000]  uh there were people biting each other biting each other until they
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.440]  blended there was a sex act going on there was lots of drugs
[56:07.440 --> 56:12.560]  the lights were um were strobing and it basically to me was very satanic now
[56:12.560 --> 56:17.040]  i had a girl uh who looked very much like my wife it's an unbelievable look
[56:17.040 --> 56:22.320]  you know this this jessica alba type long black hair
[56:22.320 --> 56:27.760]  uh she had no top one but but uh little black panties with an angel
[56:27.760 --> 56:31.200]  space and black leather chaps and the black hair fell
[56:31.200 --> 56:33.760]  down in front of her and she was trying to seduce me
[56:33.760 --> 56:38.400]  and uh it was all very seductive and really a mockery of everything that
[56:38.400 --> 56:43.600]  was good and decent and wholesome uh they were mocking god mocking uh
[56:43.600 --> 56:48.880]  anything moral it was it was a it was a feverish orgy of of um
[56:48.880 --> 56:53.040]  you're at a hellfire club i don't know what it was alex i for the life of me i
[56:53.040 --> 56:56.960]  don't know and i will tell you that that uh i ran into a man who's one of my
[56:56.960 --> 57:00.880]  informants uh from from the government who
[57:00.880 --> 57:03.920]  refers to himself as david x and he investigates these things and i didn't
[57:03.920 --> 57:05.840]  know he was there and i still don't know what he looks like
[57:05.840 --> 57:09.680]  but i left and he called me and he said he's been informed for me for the show
[57:09.680 --> 57:11.760]  and he doesn't use his real name and he said uh
[57:11.760 --> 57:14.720]  i'm glad you got out of there i said who are you who are you how did you get my
[57:14.720 --> 57:16.640]  number and he's a guy with a government he says
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.080]  uh that woman that was dancing toward you was a shifter
[57:20.080 --> 57:23.440]  and i said well how do you know how did you see me it was the darkness where

[1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:35.360]  getting off into this other craziness you're telling me a guy during the
[1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:38.880]  break would you would would well i mean tell the story briefly
[1:00:38.880 --> 1:00:42.960]  well i look i went to this party it was a it was a big deal in san diego comicon
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:46.960]  and it was all kinds of evil stuff and mockery of the nuns and sexual acts with
[1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:49.440]  the pope and it was really evil stuff there was blood
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:54.000]  letting there was sex going on drugs and as i was leaving this guy who's called
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.880]  my show over the years said he saw me there and that there was this
[1:00:56.880 --> 1:00:59.440]  he called himself david x i don't know his real name i don't know if he's
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:03.120]  legit i can't and he said that this that he saw a woman there that he was a
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:06.400]  shifter and he was looking at this all for the government i don't know
[1:01:06.400 --> 1:01:10.160]  okay and and then that led into my next point was
[1:01:10.160 --> 1:01:16.400]  uh i look remote viewing i have done
[1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:20.560]  alex it's so involved timothy leary set me up with a guy who was involved with
[1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:24.400]  the f movement another guy named bob hamilton out of carmel california
[1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:27.680]  and i started to do these exercises they said it would take years in a couple
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:32.000]  of days i was able to make my mind leave my body have you ever done it
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:36.640]  no comment okay so no no no so and i was completely sober i hadn't smoked any
[1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:39.520]  weed or anything and i was able to uh to
[1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:44.480]  to put my mind in another room so if you believe in remote viewing
[1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:48.080]  i had a caller listener to the show who was telling me what i was reading
[1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:50.800]  before i went to sleep what i was doing before i went to sleep what
[1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:53.600]  magazines were on my night table and what i was dreaming
[1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:56.640]  and this began to terrify me when i say a dampening field
[1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:00.240]  i got i went to sharper image and i got a white noise machine and i crank it up
[1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:03.760]  every night and this guy has not been able to enter my dreams
[1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:07.120]  look it's true what i'm telling you there was a listener to my radio show
[1:02:07.120 --> 1:02:10.880]  and he would talk to me in my dreams and then call me and say hey
[1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:14.720]  last night we talked about this and and it was evil
[1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:18.080]  it scared me like you can't believe i had to take drugs to go to sleep i had to
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:22.000]  get a prescription of ambient uh and in fact i'm still trying to get off that
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.080]  i i i like rush with oxy i started to develop a real
[1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:29.360]  habit here but i just i was so terrified to go to sleep
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:33.040]  because of this remote viewer this listener to my program who didn't paid
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:36.720]  my dreams and uh it's true and you can laugh at me and say it's not true i'm
[1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:39.840]  telling you sir no no i just you know you're usually
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:42.880]  serious you screw around some i know about the parties
[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:46.800]  yeah and that's even come out in the news i mean remember like in like 1998
[1:02:46.800 --> 1:02:50.400]  it came out with the mayor and they were crapping on stage oh well
[1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:55.520]  how about mayor willie brown and and you know the the uh 49er party yeah i mean

[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:04.320]  a listener of the show and i agree with what i saw
[1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:10.080]  i understand what he said biblically and i understand god's judgment
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:14.160]  and i've even said on air i hope that cps kidnappers
[1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:17.280]  and government child molesters when they're always getting caught i hope
[1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:21.600]  god will deal with them because at a very innate
[1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:25.680]  instinctive and spiritual level you know my instincts are when somebody
[1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:28.880]  threatens me or somebody uh says they're
[1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:33.200]  want to hurt me or my family you know i i innately want to crush them
[1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:36.560]  it's not some vengeful thing it's just an instinct
[1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:40.880]  um and it's a sense of justice spiritually but
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:44.320]  the way the media can edit things together like i'm always calling for
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:48.320]  non-violence unless it's to defend yourself but psychology today
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:52.240]  says that the lies and says the fbi and secret service are after me for
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:56.480]  threatening the president and that i'm calling for violence
[1:10:56.480 --> 1:11:00.080]  and then i'm and i'm calling for my followers to be violent
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:04.080]  i mean they are trying to set me up uh
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:08.400]  pittsburgh post gazette's done this and i understand it a
[1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:12.560]  innate wholesome level you all this corruption and evils around you you
[1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:16.080]  want to physically confront it or you want to ask god to confront it i'm
[1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:18.800]  just saying and i want to talk to pastor anderson a moment
[1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:22.160]  we need to be aware of how this is being manipulated one of the worst shows on
[1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:24.640]  cnn this guy's always putting out propaganda this
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:28.720]  guy's attacked me several times uh distorts what he said
[1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:31.840]  distorted what chris said because you notice these are like two three second
[1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:34.880]  clips out of context so i wanted to have pastor anderson up
[1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:39.440]  so he can respond to this so here is we'll play part of this cnn clip so he
[1:11:39.440 --> 1:11:42.960]  can respond and analyze it uh right now here it is
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:48.000]  so many of you have been contacting me about the ugly and hateful tone that's
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:51.280]  being used against the president of the united states what appear to be a
[1:11:51.280 --> 1:11:55.440]  growing number of events around the country may be now eclipsed
[1:11:55.440 --> 1:11:58.640]  by what i'm about to share with you this is a pastor
[1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:02.960]  albeit of a small church in tempe Arizona who said this over the weekend
[1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:06.480]  about the death of senator ted kennedy and about the president of the united
[1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:09.920]  states i don't want to be a martyr
[1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:13.440]  we don't need another holiday i'd like to see him die like ted kennedy of brain
[1:12:13.440 --> 1:12:17.920]  cancer on its own that story could be seen by
[1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:21.200]  some as the ranting of a madman but when connected
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:24.240]  to the increase of threats against the president
[1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:28.560]  as detailed to us by several sources it becomes a story of some
[1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:32.080]  national significance and here's another reason that story
[1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:35.760]  becomes more important you know who was sitting in the church when
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:39.920]  pastor steven anderson suggested that the president should die
[1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:43.280]  let me show you because it also goes back to our previous reporting
[1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:47.600]  this man identified as chris who was seen later outside the president's event
[1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:52.160]  in phoenix wielding an ar-15 again outside the president's event
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:56.880]  wielding an ar-15 he was in the church listening to that
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:00.320]  in case you missed it here's what the pastor said on the
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:04.320]  eve of the president's arrival
[1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:07.840]  you're going to tell me that i'm supposed to pray
[1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:15.040]  for the socialist devil murderer infanticide who wants to see
[1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:19.040]  young children and he wants to see babies killed through abortion and
[1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:22.000]  parcel burglars and everything you're going to tell me i'm supposed to pray
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.720]  for god to give him a good lunch tomorrow while he's in phoenix
[1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:28.160]  arizona nope i'm not going to pray for his good
[1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:32.560]  i'm going to pray that he dies and goes to hell i'm going to pray that he dies
[1:13:32.560 --> 1:13:36.240]  and goes to hell here let's stop right there
[1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:40.000]  now it's true obama took the restrictions off forced abortion money for
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.760]  china and india and infanticide abortion money
[1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:48.400]  for africa but see it's okay for the eugenicists to write their textbooks
[1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:52.320]  about how they want to sterilize us and abort us and drug our water
[1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:55.680]  assaulting is that way because they do it real sweet and loving with a liberal
[1:13:55.680 --> 1:14:00.080]  voice that's okay but if you say you want god to punish
[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:03.360]  people that are killing millions of babies you're
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:06.720]  bad now the establishment believes in all
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:10.000]  this that's why they're upset by it and they also want to demonize everybody
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  else who's criticizing obama they want to radicalize this
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:17.200]  but i do have to say pastor anderson we're going to play the rest of the clip
[1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:21.040]  they got the secret service on there talking about do you need to be arrested
[1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:25.760]  clearly it's your right uh to you know say that you
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:28.400]  you know when they ask you do you want harm the president you go no i'd like
[1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:31.920]  god to deal with them they beg the question and then they
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:35.920]  distorted it and the way it's cut so short it's clear they didn't want fully
[1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:40.480]  what you and christinby said said so before i even criticize you i'm
[1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:43.760]  saying the way they present it it doesn't come off well
[1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:48.400]  explain to me what you fully said thanks for joining us pastor
[1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:52.080]  thanks for having me out i appreciate it we appreciate you so are you referring
[1:14:52.080 --> 1:14:55.680]  to the to the ted kennedy comment or the starman
[1:14:55.680 --> 1:14:59.360]  well i mean both of it because they're clearly taking little bit eclips
[1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:04.400]  what did you really say in the totality in in full
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:07.280]  well basically here's here's what the whole sermon was about here's what all
[1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:12.320]  my statements were about god is a god of justice god is a god of
[1:15:12.320 --> 1:15:15.680]  whatsoever a man so it that shall he also reap
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:20.880]  and you know obama and other presidents before him have been guilty of
[1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:26.240]  murder have been guilty of using my tax dollars to fund abortions in america
[1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:31.600]  and abroad and fantasize for sterilizations murder all these
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:34.960]  horrible things and i said that he should reap what he's
[1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:37.600]  selling you know i don't understand why this is even
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:41.040]  such a big news story you know you can pick up the bible in any
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:45.920]  dollar tree across america and yet people are shocked that somebody's
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:49.840]  actually preaching what the bible says which is that murderers should be tried
[1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:52.560]  and executed which is what the bible teaches and
[1:15:52.560 --> 1:15:56.240]  you know i use the example of charles manson charles manson never
[1:15:56.240 --> 1:15:59.760]  physically murdered anyone yet he was given a death sentence in the state of
[1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:03.680]  california for being a part of murder for you know
[1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:07.360]  basically inciting people to murder and that's exactly
[1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:11.120]  what i would put obama in that category by taking my tax dollars making these
[1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:15.840]  executive orders that slaughter you know unborn and newborn babies
[1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:19.680]  he's a murderer and therefore he should be punished as such and i and i made it
[1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:22.880]  clear in the sermon this is of course what they'll never play on the
[1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:26.240]  tv all the different times in the sermon i explained
[1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:30.080]  that you know our battle as christians is not against flesh and blood we're not
[1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:33.760]  going to take up arms we're going to let god take care of it
[1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:37.760]  vengeance is mine faith the lord and and in reality prayer
[1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:40.800]  is the exact opposite of taking things into your own hands
[1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:45.120]  it's praying that god will step in and carry out justice on the evil people
[1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:49.280]  who are destroying our country it's not us going out and threatening to kill
[1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:53.040]  them and you know that rick sanchez has been has been lying
[1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:57.360]  let me expose you one of his biggest lies the first time he ran the story
[1:16:57.360 --> 1:17:00.560]  he said oh we've been trying to get him on the show we're trying to reach out
[1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:04.480]  to pastor anderson when in reality i had agreed to do a live interview on the
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:08.640]  show and they canceled me and then they go on tv saying
[1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:13.280]  that i'm not going on there yeah that's what happened to me that's happened to me
[1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:17.680]  probably more than 20 times with cnn especially
[1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:22.800]  they will say oh we had mr jones but now he's refused to be here with us
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:26.000]  and i've been in the car driving to the satellite uplink
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:29.680]  and they say they don't want you now and take you back just so they can jerk you
[1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:32.800]  around they're just bastards
[1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:39.440]  that's exactly right and so it's amazing to me that people are so shocked
[1:17:39.440 --> 1:17:42.640]  when the bible the bible's been around for a long time and you know
[1:17:42.640 --> 1:17:46.320]  praying for someone to die is not something that i made up
[1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:52.160]  okay they're about 18 Psalms in the book of Psalms which contains 150 Psalms
[1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:57.040]  which contain curses on god's enemies and praying that they'll die praying that
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:17:59.920]  they'll go down quick into hell i mean
[1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:03.360]  don't think why don't you go over a few of those today pastor why don't we read
[1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:06.480]  a few of those scriptures together okay sure
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:10.240]  because the thing is people want to make this about me personally and they
[1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:13.440]  they want to make an attack on me personally and i'd like to see some
[1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:16.400]  other pastors stand up and get on the firing line with me
[1:18:16.400 --> 1:18:20.480]  instead of you know hiding their head in the sand and and running way scared
[1:18:20.480 --> 1:18:24.000]  you know and leaving me to take all the heat alone for the bible which is
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:27.440]  it has been around for thousands of years let me read a scripture for you
[1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:32.320]  from Psalm 5515 the bible says let death
[1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:36.400]  seize upon them and let them go down quick into hell
[1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:39.280]  for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them
[1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:42.720]  as for me i will call upon god and the lord shall save me
[1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:47.600]  now i didn't write that that's david speaking and he's praying that god will
[1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:52.160]  send these wicked people to hell and a lot of people will try to say well
[1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:55.040]  that's just david talk that's man's word
[1:18:55.040 --> 1:18:59.120]  no my friend the bible is written by god i'm a baptist preacher i believe the
[1:18:59.120 --> 1:19:02.640]  bible is god's word and in act chapter four
[1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:06.480]  when they quoted the book of psalms they said well spake the lord
[1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:10.720]  god by the mouth of david the prophet but david was a prophet of god he was
[1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:14.240]  speaking god's word not just his own words out of his own heart
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:19.920]  and that's one example in psalm 55 15 and 16 where he he's praying
[1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:23.040]  that they'll die and go to hell and and here's the thing i don't have the power
[1:19:23.040 --> 1:19:26.560]  to send anyone to hell i'm just praying for him to die
[1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:30.240]  and whether i want him to go to heaven or he's going to hell anyway but that's
[1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:34.080]  not even my decision you know i'm just praying that he dies so that
[1:19:34.080 --> 1:19:38.880]  other human lives could be saved for the greater good
[1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:42.800]  let's go over some more of those and if so cnn can have a problem with the bible
[1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:46.480]  actually in canada in england in europe they are trying to ban
[1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:50.080]  hundreds and hundreds of passages similar to the one you just read
[1:19:50.080 --> 1:19:54.240]  we know why they want the hate crime legislation uh but this is the bible
[1:19:54.240 --> 1:19:57.040]  and i know a lot of phony christians have a big problem with it
[1:19:57.040 --> 1:20:00.720]  that's why they love the new world order
[1:20:00.720 --> 1:20:04.080]  would you give someone a hundred dollars for a ten dollar bill

[1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:39.840]  said a central bank issuing a public currency is a
[1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:43.200]  greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army
[1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:46.880]  hi tit anderson i'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains

[1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:09.200]  or rock obama is the tip of the spear we've got to give them a stake
[1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:13.440]  in creating the kind of world order that i think all of us would like to see
[1:22:13.440 --> 1:22:16.720]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth
[1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:19.920]  that obama is working for the best interest of the american people

[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:28.800]  admitted 18 years of sanctions nobody rings their hands about that
[1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:33.200]  obama poses is this great guy who loves the african people when he's expanding
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:36.800]  the abortion and forced abortion against them
[1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:42.800]  that's on record and he also called for killing babies after they're born
[1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:45.520]  if they're accidentally born in partial birth abortion when they're nine months
[1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:48.800]  old and he's on record he really called for that
[1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:53.040]  when he was a u.s and state senator as well but why didn't anybody care about
[1:24:53.040 --> 1:24:56.720]  these babies i mean i mean i know obama is a complete puppet
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:00.800]  he's not the real king herod he's not the real king of the philistines
[1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:04.720]  i understand that it's more sophisticated game that he's just a puppet and
[1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:10.640]  they get sympathy off this but taking a pastor out of context
[1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:14.800]  who's reading i guess what do you call those prayers in perpetuary or what's
[1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:19.840]  the term for a lot of people a lot of people use the term imprecatory
[1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:23.600]  which comes from the word implication which is to curse
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:28.000]  someone okay so what are some of the other things in the bible that they'd
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:33.360]  like to burn well you know first of all the part that i actually
[1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:36.480]  preached in the sermon that they're all outraged about
[1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:41.120]  was actually saw 58 and i could read a part of that if you want this is where
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:45.920]  my sermon basically came from yes go ahead it says uh this is song 58 verse
[1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:49.600]  six break their teeth oh god in their mouth
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:52.640]  break out the great teeth of the young lion oh lord
[1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:55.920]  let them melt away as waters which run continually
[1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:59.760]  when he benefit bow to shoot his arrows let them be as cutting pieces
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:04.000]  as a snail which melted let every one of them pass away
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:08.480]  like the untimely birth of a woman that they may not see the sun
[1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:13.520]  and verse ten it says the righteous shall rejoice when he feeds the vengeance
[1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:18.240]  he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked so that a man shall say
[1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:22.240]  barely there is a reward for the righteous barely he is a god that judges
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:26.560]  in the earth now i you know i didn't like that
[1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:30.400]  and yet i'm taking heat this week last week the week before
[1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:34.080]  for those words for preaching those words and and
[1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:39.120]  applying them to the person whom they most definitely apply to
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:43.440]  but but pastor i understand you're preaching the bible here and you have
[1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:46.160]  a right to do it and i understand why you're saying what you're saying what
[1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:48.800]  you're doing i'm not you know i've defended you when they beat you up for
[1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:52.480]  no reason that the the tv host acts like you're some type of criminal that
[1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:56.240]  deserves it he then asked people on basically calling for your arrest
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:01.440]  we're gonna cover that but just politically
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:04.320]  and i understand you and others standing up to him is starting to intimidate
[1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:07.680]  the establishment they realize there's millions of americans now who are just
[1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:11.520]  ready for a fight uh and who are sick of
[1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:15.040]  mincing words and so maybe it's the right course you're
[1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:18.400]  taking just instinctively and politically
[1:27:18.400 --> 1:27:22.320]  obama is a frontman in a puppet the establishment want him as a shield
[1:27:22.320 --> 1:27:29.520]  to take the arrows and certainly you can't mince your words
[1:27:29.520 --> 1:27:33.200]  knowing that they're going to edit them and take them out of context as they did
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:38.800]  but i just think that hoping you know he dies of brain cancer
[1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:43.040]  really plays into the media because they because they edited down what you said
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:47.680]  i mean what do we do about this i guess we just let them
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:52.000]  use this against us and i mean do you see my point
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.960]  i definitely see your point but but here's the thing i'm not a politician
[1:27:56.960 --> 1:28:01.360]  so i don't care what happens politically because the way that i run my life
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:04.800]  and the way that i pastor my church and the way that i preach has always been
[1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:08.400]  the same and it's preach the word of god preach the
[1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:10.880]  truth and let the chips fall where they may
[1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:13.760]  that's what any man of god any preacher should be doing
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:16.480]  and not weighing oh well how people gonna use this
[1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:20.480]  are people gonna like this is my church gonna grow am i gonna lose people
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:24.720]  to me that doesn't matter what matters to me is did i obey god when he told me as
[1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:28.480]  a preacher to preach the word no i see what you're saying because
[1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:32.880]  because once you start giving in we now have gelded preachers saying take the
[1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:36.560]  inoculations go to the fema camps clergy response team
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:40.320]  tyranny's good let the government take your children i mean they're now
[1:28:40.320 --> 1:28:44.160]  openly federalized and just like hitler of the
[1:28:44.160 --> 1:28:47.920]  soviet union once you begin to adulterate it
[1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:52.320]  you become a tool of the establishment and now most churches i've been to them
[1:28:52.320 --> 1:28:56.480]  are absolute organs i mean you feel the spirit of the world
[1:28:56.480 --> 1:28:59.600]  more in church now than you feel it even on the street
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:03.920]  i mean i i can't go in most churches because that's just so
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:07.360]  the spirit of the world is so strong and i mean you know what i'm talking about
[1:29:07.360 --> 1:29:12.080]  oh yeah definitely you're you're exactly like and it's exactly what you just said
[1:29:12.080 --> 1:29:16.320]  when you start to trim the message of the bible when you start to tone it down
[1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:19.200]  when you start to back down and and compromise
[1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:23.440]  there is no end to it you're going to come you know once you get in the habit
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:26.960]  of compromising you're going to keep compromising and watering down
[1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:31.280]  and most churches today alex let's face it are rock and roll concert
[1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:34.800]  they're a social club they're a motivational speaker
[1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:38.880]  they're not a real house of god well it's a place to pick up women
[1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:42.000]  i mean growing up in dallas if you wanted to go pick up women it was church i

[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:06.160]  okay going back to pastor anderson uh joining us today and we'll also uh
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:10.720]  give you a chance to visit his website faithfulwordbaptist.org
[1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:14.400]  okay in this piece you've undoubtedly started seeing the CNN piece i'm gonna
[1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:19.120]  play a clip of it in a moment they're basically calling for your arrest
[1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:23.600]  and you are saying that you know do you want harm of the president
[1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:26.960]  and you say no i want god to punish evildoers
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:30.160]  and then you quote the bible but they don't tell people it's out of the bible
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:34.720]  psychology today the pittsburgh poskazette and others they say i'm calling for
[1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:40.560]  violence when i'm not so my only point is that i guess
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:44.960]  then the issue is the media is taking this out of contest uh out of context so
[1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:47.600]  that's their fault but what do you i mean if you
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:51.200]  have you been questioned by the secret service they hang it out there like you
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:54.400]  may have or may not uh what's your take on all this
[1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:57.440]  pastor anderson well here's the thing they were
[1:37:57.440 --> 1:38:01.520]  reporting last week that i said they had confirmed and were sure that i'd already
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:06.640]  visited by the secret service and i hadn't but just yesterday
[1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:10.960]  i was visited by the secret service i wasn't there and i you know called them
[1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:14.800]  and said i don't have any comments you know which is
[1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:18.160]  you know always the right course of action is not to not to talk to police
[1:38:18.160 --> 1:38:21.920]  not to talk to them you know without an attorney and so forth
[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:27.040]  but i think the cnn with all their pushing is probably the ones who prompted
[1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:31.280]  them to finally come by and when the secret service came by they they said
[1:38:31.280 --> 1:38:34.880]  that i wasn't being charged anything that i hadn't broken any law
[1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:38.560]  that's what they told you know the people that they saw the cnn is hoaxing
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:42.240]  that you have so they talk to the secretary or somebody
[1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:47.120]  exactly that's exactly right so you know the bottom line is that
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:50.320]  like you said they take everything out of context and it's funny because
[1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:54.960]  whenever they did these interviews i also lavished a lot of criticism and
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:38:59.200]  and rhetoric on bush and cheney but they don't want to report that
[1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:02.560]  because they want to make it about a right versus left issue
[1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:05.600]  like it's the right now they want to play us off against each other in the
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:09.120]  left-right paradigm they always just like all the republicans that are pro new
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:13.120]  world order pro nap to get pro war they're being booed off the stage at
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:17.680]  their own events the media will not report on that
[1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:22.400]  local radio k lbj has that's it they will not report that all over the
[1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:25.840]  country that everybody's sick of the entire government
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:30.240]  they've got to make it about obama and then say it's racism
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:33.840]  exactly and that you know they they want to make me out that
[1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:37.120]  i'm some kind of a you know extremist republican that
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:41.280]  that's just against obama and and where was i during the bush administration
[1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:44.640]  you know i've been preaching the same things for years alex
[1:39:44.640 --> 1:39:48.800]  i preached this exact same sermon on obama
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:52.240]  the day a few days after he was inaugurated i preached the exact
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:56.080]  sermon on obama and it was downloaded from our website
[1:39:56.080 --> 1:39:58.960]  thousands of times and yet there was no backlash on because i'm gonna tell you
[1:39:58.960 --> 1:40:02.800]  the truth about this this is all as a result of the border patrol thing
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:05.680]  and a lot of people don't realize that they're not putting it together ever
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:09.840]  since i released a video on youtube of the border patrol beating me up and
[1:40:09.840 --> 1:40:12.640]  tasering me there have been just one form of
[1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:16.560]  harassment after another i'm getting pulled over all the time
[1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:20.480]  and they're not even giving me a ticket to harass by the police uh other time
[1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:23.280]  they're writing me bogus tickets and then i go to court
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:26.560]  and the ticket was never even turned in by the police officer
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:30.160]  and you know now they're scouring my sermons and trying to
[1:40:30.160 --> 1:40:34.000]  attack me on the television there it's just one thing after another and it's
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:37.200]  been ever since this whole border patrol incident
[1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:40.480]  you know i've been harassed continually in my personal life
[1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:43.920]  it's just one thing after another well it's like the clip
[1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:47.760]  it's like the clip from ants in fact youtube that clip it'll be something
[1:40:47.760 --> 1:40:51.840]  like ants standing up or from ants you know
[1:40:51.840 --> 1:40:55.120]  if one stand if one aunt stands up they all stand up
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:59.680]  and the grasshopper lieutenant is saying to the commander he says there's
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:03.280]  plenty of food here there's big piles of food
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:06.320]  why are we going over to the ants and making them be our slaves
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:11.200]  when we don't even need them and he said listen those ants outnumber us a hundred
[1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:14.400]  to one and if they ever stand up our way of life
[1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:17.840]  is over it's about power and control and the
[1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:20.240]  image of you saying no you're not going to search me
[1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:23.920]  50 miles away from the border randomly with your fat
[1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:28.160]  dog that gets a biscuit every time at false alerts bring the dog back out
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:32.720]  i don't have any drugs uh you're a classic pastor like Paul who goes and
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:36.640]  puts tile in and is a carpenter you're driving back from california you know
[1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:39.200]  doing your work you're not putting up with it
[1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:42.640]  and they now put our children to their naked body scanners and
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:46.640]  store their naked images on the computer for biometric scanning
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:49.600]  they now are training us more and more to be slaves
[1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:53.600]  and they know if if they start having a revolt of the ants
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:58.000]  it's over for them and so they are scared to death the people that say
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  i am not your slave it's over i'm not called by you i've done nothing wrong
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:08.160]  and when you try to oppress me you're a criminal
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:11.280]  right and and they're trying that they're trying to punish me and break me
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:14.000]  down and they're trying to just basically make
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:18.320]  my life as miserable as possible by you know trying to ruin my business
[1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:21.520]  trying to ruin my church trying to you know ruin my life
[1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:24.880]  but you know what they just keep on trying but you know what
[1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:29.040]  i am not going to take back what god said thousands of years ago
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:32.800]  you know who am i to contradict god almighty
[1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:36.240]  and so these people can can can say what they want
[1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:38.960]  but you know what it's not going to change what the bible says these
[1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:43.840]  these christians who are basically spoon fed by their pastor
[1:42:43.840 --> 1:42:47.680]  a few choice scriptures from the bible a few feel good sermons
[1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:51.120]  who've never read the bible cover to cover genesis the revelation
[1:42:51.120 --> 1:42:54.240]  you know they're ignorant they think i'm hateful
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:58.240]  they think i'm they think i'm wrong but you know what the bible makes it clear
[1:42:58.240 --> 1:43:01.760]  that there are people that we should not be praying for their good
[1:43:01.760 --> 1:43:06.720]  god said three times in the book of Jeremiah pray not for this people
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:10.160]  he said because of their wickedness he said if you pray for them i will not
[1:43:10.160 --> 1:43:12.800]  hear you i know and what is this weird thing that
[1:43:12.800 --> 1:43:18.000]  hitler and stallin did where they say it's roman's 13 pray for your leaders
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:21.760]  but when the founding fathers everybody else stood up against tyranny
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:25.040]  i mean that is completely false doctrine
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:28.640]  it's definitely false doctrine and it comes from just a very narrow view of
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:31.920]  the bible where they've heard a few feel good passages
[1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:35.120]  you know they've heard the part about Jesus telling you to love your enemies
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:39.280]  which i do love my enemies i only hate god's enemies i only hate the violent
[1:43:39.280 --> 1:43:42.560]  wicked people do it as well i don't i don't hate my personal
[1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:46.400]  enemy to do me wrong you know the people who beat me up at the border patrol
[1:43:46.400 --> 1:43:50.240]  checkpoint i prayed for them you know i have god to forgive them i don't have
[1:43:50.240 --> 1:43:54.240]  any hard feelings toward them they're not the problem they're just brainwashed
[1:43:54.240 --> 1:43:58.160]  you know it you know it's it's it's the people up top that are evil and they're
[1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:01.360]  the ones who god needs to judge you know i was saying to the
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:04.160]  you know to the guys in uniform you know forgive them father for they know not
[1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:06.560]  what they do because they're just brainwashed they're just
[1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:09.520]  following training they you know they grew up on tv or whatever they don't
[1:44:09.520 --> 1:44:14.320]  know what's really going on but the bottom line is this
[1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:18.880]  okay people have a very limited understanding of what the bible teaches
[1:44:18.880 --> 1:44:22.400]  because they're not reading it cover to cover and they're going to a church
[1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:26.080]  it's more interested in popularity building a bigger building making more
[1:44:26.080 --> 1:44:30.000]  money and is not interested in really telling them what the bible actually
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:33.840]  appreciates it that's the problem
[1:44:34.720 --> 1:44:38.480]  well this is really creepy on cnn with them calling for your arrest
[1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:41.840]  i mean look at this i see these kind of articles every day
[1:44:41.840 --> 1:44:45.600]  democratic party official accused in satanic rape kidnap
[1:44:45.600 --> 1:44:51.200]  woman husband said to shackle victims to beds keep them in dog cages without food
[1:44:51.200 --> 1:44:55.120]  and how many cps workers how many homeland security officials
[1:44:55.120 --> 1:44:59.600]  how many uh people investigating child abuse it turns out
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:02.880]  aren't just child rapists they're a satanist i mean
[1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:06.800]  these people are everywhere this is the religion of the world
[1:45:06.800 --> 1:45:10.320]  in fact i show this video uh for president planet dot tv viewers here's
[1:45:10.320 --> 1:45:13.440]  the article right here
[1:45:13.440 --> 1:45:19.920]  we just lost the pastor we're going to uh we're going to get him
[1:45:19.920 --> 1:45:28.320]  back on the show right now coming up here in just a few minutes
[1:45:28.320 --> 1:45:31.840]  but you know even if you're not a christian
[1:45:31.840 --> 1:45:34.960]  the point is the establishment is always saying
[1:45:34.960 --> 1:45:38.400]  you shouldn't have a religion god isn't real but then you find out the elites
[1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:41.680]  who were saying they're atheist nine times out of ten in my research they
[1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:45.760]  turn out to be a cultist who are luciferian or satanist
[1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:49.120]  and they're really obsessed with all the voodoo
[1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:54.240]  and all the superstition and all this you know religiosity
[1:45:54.240 --> 1:45:58.080]  but uh again here's the article democratic party official accused in
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:02.240]  satanic rape kidnap women husband said to shackle victims
[1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:09.200]  to beds keep them in dog cages without food a democratic party
[1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:12.960]  official and her husband are facing charges in connection
[1:46:12.960 --> 1:46:16.320]  with alleged satanic rituals involving the kidnap rape and starvation
[1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:20.640]  of another couple in north carolina joy johnson 30 a vice chair woman of the
[1:46:20.640 --> 1:46:24.160]  Durham county democratic party and vice chair woman of the
[1:46:24.160 --> 1:46:27.200]  young democrats made an appearance in court yesterday at her she and her
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:31.120]  spouse joseph craig were arrested friday craig 25 is charged with second

[1:46:34.160 --> 1:46:37.280]  weapon and an incident in january and another in may
[1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:40.080]  johnson is charged with two counts of aiding and abetting
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:43.440]  according to published broadcast reports prosecutors said a man and a woman
[1:46:43.440 --> 1:46:46.640]  met craig through a shared interest in satan worship
[1:46:46.640 --> 1:46:50.480]  although the couple never consented to any physical abuse craig allegedly
[1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:54.160]  shackled his victims to bed keeping them in dog cages and starved them inside
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:46:57.280]  his home police said he beat the man with a cane
[1:46:57.280 --> 1:47:01.120]  and a cord and raped the woman seen it's all about power and it's always pot
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:04.880]  bellied weak chicken necks that seethe with weakness
[1:47:04.880 --> 1:47:08.480]  and that's why they love getting control of public schools and kids
[1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:11.920]  and that's why the old wives tales are the satanists come for your kids
[1:47:11.920 --> 1:47:16.240]  they do they hate innocence they hate goodness and
[1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:20.080]  they tell us to be nice and just stand down and go along with their crap
[1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:23.600]  well i'll tell you this i'm not standing down to their crap we have pastor
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:27.840]  back pastor we lost your phone uh
[1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:32.560]  constantly we see the satanist and what they're doing and they always say oh
[1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:35.440]  oh yeah we're into the occult but it's not satanic and then
[1:47:35.440 --> 1:47:40.560]  i've gone and investigated it it's always manipulation control domination
[1:47:40.560 --> 1:47:45.680]  mind games you look at these occultists it's it's it's almost identical to
[1:47:45.680 --> 1:47:49.680]  psychiatry and psychologists and then i discovered this is just a brand of
[1:47:49.680 --> 1:47:53.040]  occultist manipulation and mind control these are
[1:47:53.040 --> 1:47:57.840]  just control freak scum uh pastor your comments
[1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:02.080]  hey you were so right and it's amazing how i grew up as a Baptist
[1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:05.680]  and when i was a child in Baptist churches there was all kinds of preaching
[1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:10.240]  against the whole modern psychiatry psychology that the dope
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:14.000]  there was preaching against the one world government the market to be
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:17.040]  it's i i'm just wondering where that preaching gone
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:20.800]  because you're right the modern psychology is satanic
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:25.040]  and you know satanism they start the kids on it early with the harry potter
[1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:27.760]  you know and then it and then it goes from there and they teach him that
[1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:31.040]  witchcraft is fun it's cool you know to perform
[1:48:31.040 --> 1:48:35.360]  spells and well i'll tell you i mean in high school this stuff was rampant
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:39.040]  and they these people were all control freaks screwed up their parents were
[1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:43.440]  into it and these were just unhappy screwed up people
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:46.400]  and you know i'm tired of them trying to run my life
[1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:49.760]  and they won a war they're gonna get one and these little bastards never
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:53.920]  figured that out so they squeal and beg and you know we don't take any
[1:48:53.920 --> 1:48:58.720]  pleasure in when they go into the fire it's a sad thing
[1:48:58.720 --> 1:49:05.840]  comments on that healthy absolutely and um you know i i just want to i just
[1:49:05.840 --> 1:49:08.320]  want to say this i don't know if you remember this alex but
[1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:11.840]  do you remember what desi jackson said about obama
[1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:15.920]  said he was jesus when he said well the the one that the one that i wanted to
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:19.440]  draw attention to was the clip a while back where he didn't know that the
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:22.400]  cameras were rolling and he said you know i don't want to say it on the air
[1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:25.120]  because it's kind of obscene but he said i want to cut his
[1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:28.960]  blank off did you ever see that clip of jackson saying that
[1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:34.560]  yes and it's amazing how you know i'm just praying a prayer out of the bible
[1:49:34.560 --> 1:49:38.400]  and and and all this fire all this outrage why aren't people
[1:49:38.400 --> 1:49:41.360]  flipping out about you know what desi jackson said
[1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:45.280]  which was obscene and which was actually a direct threat saying i want to do
[1:49:45.280 --> 1:49:48.880]  this to him so well that is because jackson who
[1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:52.560]  led martin Luther king out to the balcony is a total globalist and just
[1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:56.880]  jealous of obama that i mean the elites all hate each other
[1:49:56.880 --> 1:50:00.080]  right and i'm and here's the thing i'm just kind of a handy guy for them right
[1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:04.960]  now to pull out right now and i'm basically the guy that they're using
[1:50:04.960 --> 1:50:09.360]  to get people mad at christians to get people mad at at baptist or fundamental
[1:50:09.360 --> 1:50:13.360]  it or people that are you know uh libertarian minded
[1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:16.560]  they're just kind of pulling me out and demonizing me
[1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:20.480]  and they can find all the you know infendiary clips in my preaching and
[1:50:20.480 --> 1:50:23.680]  use them to get all the sheep all fired up and mad
[1:50:23.680 --> 1:50:27.280]  but you know what i'm sorry i i'm not going to sit there
[1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:31.440]  and and preach my sermons according to what's going to happen politically you
[1:50:31.440 --> 1:50:33.600]  know whatever's going to happen politically is going to happen that's not
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:36.720]  my job not a politician
[1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:42.240]  well in the past the establishment of callous with all of this
[1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:45.680]  i hope the establishment realizes that if they stage terror attacks and try to
[1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:48.240]  blame it on us this is going to get out of control for
[1:50:48.240 --> 1:50:52.160]  everybody so i just want
[1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:55.360]  things not to become escalated but you know it's all in god's hands as you say

[1:54:08.640 --> 1:54:15.120]  in t-minus six minutes i want to get pastor anderson and chris
[1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:19.680]  the fellow the ar-15 strapped us back back on the show coming up the next few
[1:54:19.680 --> 1:54:24.320]  weeks as this develops as they are doing a massive demonization campaign
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:27.680]  and the point is the police don't mind the guns out in the open as that's
[1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:31.280]  people's rights the police are worried about the hidden guns
[1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:34.800]  i mean it's it's just ridiculous there's concealed carry everywhere it's just
[1:54:34.800 --> 1:54:38.960]  asinine by the way this uh sanchez fellow from
[1:54:38.960 --> 1:54:44.560]  cnn was at wsvn tv doing the hit pieces and he was
[1:54:44.560 --> 1:54:49.360]  run out of town after drunk driving when he uh ran into a man in
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:54.320]  paralyzing so that's the kind of people they have
[1:54:54.320 --> 1:55:00.080]  just like the mysterious death of that reporter uh with
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:04.000]  the morning show with scar bro i mean a lot of these guys are compromised i
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:07.360]  think that's what's going on here you know separately the whitehouses with
[1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:11.280]  drawing calls for students to help obama but he's still going to start these
[1:55:11.280 --> 1:55:14.560]  video addresses remember back in the early 90s they put in
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:18.160]  tv sets for channel one and it was connected to this
[1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:21.760]  weird foundation with the government and now the president will
[1:55:21.760 --> 1:55:25.280]  i need your help children you know work with your president
[1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:28.800]  help your parents understand and now his
[1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:34.480]  czar is saying that green jobs is an incremental takeover of the society
[1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:39.040]  and economy and we have the clips we're going to play this coming up
[1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:43.280]  we have the clips here of gore saying question your parents your parents are
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:45.840]  bad they're lying to you about global warming
[1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:49.200]  when we they really are trying to take over our families
[1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:53.120]  comments on that i mean this is the revolution
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:56.480]  we're not the revolutionaries these foreign offshore banks are the ones
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:00.480]  trying to take over our society pastor right alexand and i've actually been
[1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:03.520]  explaining to people for years that we are not the revolution we're the
[1:56:03.520 --> 1:56:06.240]  counter revolution we're not trying to change our
[1:56:06.240 --> 1:56:09.360]  former government we're trying to get back to what our government's supposed
[1:56:09.360 --> 1:56:13.200]  to be in the constitution and there's a left-wing communist
[1:56:13.200 --> 1:56:17.040]  takeover going on right now that's the revolution we're the counter revolution
[1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:20.000]  and you know the public schools have already been a brainwashing center for
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.320]  years so you know now they're just adding a
[1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:26.400]  little video fireside chat with obama it's just more of the same that they're
[1:56:26.400 --> 1:56:29.760]  getting the whole rest of the day and these you know left-wing agenda
[1:56:29.760 --> 1:56:35.680]  government schools so it's probably nothing new for them
[1:56:35.680 --> 1:56:40.560]  well i mean it's overtly
[1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:44.160]  anti-american classical tyranny to have the youth
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:47.600]  wearing red and black uniforms and compulsory service and lining up in
[1:56:47.600 --> 1:56:51.760]  front of jumbo screens with the president telling them
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:55.600]  work with me serve me help me and the kids like they have this
[1:56:55.600 --> 1:56:58.640]  relationship with him i mean this is hit larian
[1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:03.360]  i mean this is right i can't even believe this is actually happening
[1:57:03.360 --> 1:57:06.880]  it's unbelievable i can't believe how fast it's happening
[1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:10.560]  you know i mean i i would have never believed one year ago that we'd be where
[1:57:10.560 --> 1:57:13.360]  we're at right now it's it's unbelievable how fast it's
[1:57:13.360 --> 1:57:16.880]  happening and i think i think the good thing about how fast it's happening is
[1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:20.800]  that it's waking people up because a lot of people that i talked to
[1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:24.320]  maybe a year ago year and a half ago they were still just kind of drinking the
[1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:27.120]  republican kool-aid and they thought everything was wonderful if we could just
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:30.000]  get the republicans elected but now you're talking to those same
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:33.280]  people they're starting to realize that the whole government is corrupt
[1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:38.080]  and the good thing about obama getting elected and it's going so quickly
[1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:41.360]  is that it's shocking people into reality
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:44.880]  and they're not asleep at the wheel like they were with george w bush
[1:57:44.880 --> 1:57:48.080]  who was pretty much doing most of the same policies obama
[1:57:48.080 --> 1:57:51.520]  obama has accelerated it so much that at least people are
[1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:55.040]  waking people up and you know the frog is about to jump out of the hot water
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:57:59.280]  because it's getting so hot so fast and that's why they're pulling me out
[1:57:59.280 --> 1:58:04.160]  right now to demonize and and to make a little victim in a martyr out of
[1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:08.640]  gawk obama like oh the poor guy people just don't understand it you know can
[1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:10.800]  you believe that this pastor actually hates it
[1:58:10.800 --> 1:58:15.200]  you know what alex let's let's face it i said out loud
[1:58:15.200 --> 1:58:18.640]  what millions of people in america believe in their heart
[1:58:18.640 --> 1:58:23.920]  well more than that he's smart bombing weddings and funerals in pakistan and
[1:58:23.920 --> 1:58:27.920]  afghanistan expanding wars funding abortion worldwide forced
[1:58:27.920 --> 1:58:31.520]  abortion i mean he's a front man for a gang of killers
[1:58:31.520 --> 1:58:34.880]  and so it's it's it's it's a way to make him the victim you're right
[1:58:34.880 --> 1:58:42.560]  pastor god bless you we'll talk to you again soon thanks
[1:58:42.560 --> 1:58:50.720]  thank you for listening to gcn be sure to visit gcnlive.com today

[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:10.960]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:14.640]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:17.120]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months
[1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:19.680]  ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous summer
[1:59:19.680 --> 1:59:23.280]  storm season is here again every year thousands of families lose their power
[1:59:23.280 --> 1:59:27.280]  from weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides

[2:00:05.360 --> 2:00:11.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[2:00:11.680 --> 2:00:18.400]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now
[2:00:18.400 --> 2:00:25.600]  live from austin texas alex jones best-selling author
[2:00:25.600 --> 2:00:31.600]  syndicated radio host patriot steve well joins us for the next 60 minutes
[2:00:31.600 --> 2:00:35.680]  steve i know we've covered the basics on the flu
[2:00:35.680 --> 2:00:40.800]  the background the preparation the different scenarios that could unfold
[2:00:40.800 --> 2:00:44.160]  you've been doing it since 1996 saying you believe that was the vehicle they
[2:00:44.160 --> 2:00:47.040]  were going to use we saw them setting up the mass
[2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:50.320]  graves the crematoriums the federal takeover drills the forced
[2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:53.760]  inoculation preparation in december january february
[2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:57.920]  so we really got concerned in april when they mobilized and launched the
[2:00:57.920 --> 2:01:02.560]  fear mongering is the virus really deadly is it the cover for
[2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:06.080]  something else are they going to have mega deaths like they're saying
[2:01:06.080 --> 2:01:09.200]  now they're announcing quarantines forced inoculations
[2:01:09.200 --> 2:01:13.120]  lockdowns 400 000 troops the army's announced
[2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:16.960]  they want to put on the streets of america from 4 000 last year to 20 000
[2:01:16.960 --> 2:01:22.720]  in january to 40 000 in april to now 400 000
[2:01:22.720 --> 2:01:26.720]  they're really pulling out all the stops so i don't want to just i mean people
[2:01:26.720 --> 2:01:30.000]  understand something's wrong the question is
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:34.160]  will they just use this fear mongering as the cover for a federal takeover
[2:01:34.160 --> 2:01:38.240]  it's perfect with the flue being worldwide for a global un
[2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:42.000]  takeover to be coupled with an economic collapse in the fall
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:47.040]  if we expose their agenda will they back off and not carry it out
[2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:51.200]  uh what are the different angles i want to cover every facet but first in the
[2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:53.680]  three minutes four minutes we got before break
[2:01:53.680 --> 2:01:58.320]  just just just recapping with your intel what we're facing
[2:01:58.320 --> 2:02:02.000]  well first of all alexa 400 000 troops that i caught a lot of black from
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.880]  people and i said there are that many foreign troops here meaning
[2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:08.640]  nato troops and other uh third world countries that have been
[2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:12.480]  literally hired by our government for this very position i found record is
[2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:15.760]  stating on your short number of times 345 000
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:20.160]  we're told to me by special operations people in fact i forgot i am
[2:02:20.160 --> 2:02:23.760]  interrupting you said three months ago and then a month ago
[2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:27.600]  on this show 340 something foul and now they're saying
[2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:32.800]  uh 390 something foul you got it so and let me share this the thing that's
[2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:36.000]  important everyone needs to watch the universities and different schools
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:40.160]  around the country because we're seeing clustering of the lockdown and
[2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:43.600]  quarantining alexa this is exactly how it was meant to go
[2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:46.560]  interestingly enough most of these universities have
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:50.480]  i a at least a microbiology department but it's fascinating
[2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:53.760]  that when you do it in the university setting or in a school setting you have
[2:02:53.760 --> 2:02:58.160]  in essence a contained group so something gets out of the hands of
[2:02:58.160 --> 2:03:01.120]  uh the handlers who have initiated this and
[2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:05.040]  intentionally released this flu then the point is is that you've got a very
[2:03:05.040 --> 2:03:09.120]  captive audience and you can do what's necessary at the time i believe
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:12.880]  that the whole thing that we saw earlier this year as you and i both were on
[2:03:12.880 --> 2:03:17.040]  record state this is not the real thing this is a scare
[2:03:17.040 --> 2:03:21.040]  tactic if you remember we you had me pray and we pray and then the bottom line
[2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:23.920]  is all the people out there by the way alexa are praying for your safety
[2:03:23.920 --> 2:03:26.960]  right now and i just got an email saying that you would ask for prayer ladies
[2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:30.800]  and gentlemen it's never been more important than you to keep alexa's
[2:03:30.800 --> 2:03:34.320]  family in your prayers and i and i'm telling you this alex this is going
[2:03:34.320 --> 2:03:36.640]  for it but it's going forward in a different way
[2:03:36.640 --> 2:03:40.400]  and this is important for people to understand the
[2:03:40.400 --> 2:03:45.200]  amount of intel coming into me from all my sources of helicopters landing in the
[2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:48.320]  desert southwest of united states different states
[2:03:48.320 --> 2:03:53.440]  and european and uh foreign bikers i'm talking about motorcycles usually on
[2:03:53.440 --> 2:03:57.440]  bmw's or foreign bikes no that's confirmed in n leo nine
[2:03:57.440 --> 2:04:02.320]  trips from 14 countries fema.gov you got it but here's what i'm saying
[2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:05.440]  they there are eyewitnesses and these are credible
[2:04:05.440 --> 2:04:09.040]  and multiple sources claiming that helicopters are landing
[2:04:09.040 --> 2:04:12.240]  and that motorcycles are being given like small
[2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:16.000]  uh containers if you will or almost like coolers
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:20.400]  of something now it's fascinating because i know uh one of the
[2:04:20.400 --> 2:04:24.640]  individuals that pays attention to a lot of my broadcast your broadcast so
[2:04:24.640 --> 2:04:28.240]  literally watched happen literally encountered some of these gentlemen
[2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:33.040]  in a gas station and all eyes well i don't remember you in february talking
[2:04:33.040 --> 2:04:35.280]  about how they were getting ready for the flu and
[2:04:35.280 --> 2:04:39.840]  trucks moving around in weird shipments and here we are
[2:04:39.840 --> 2:04:43.680]  right well i think the thing is that we're there now and
[2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:46.960]  so again this is something i think is important are they going for it
[2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:51.440]  absolutely never never miss a chance to utilize a good crisis
[2:04:51.440 --> 2:04:54.000]  to bring about the new world order but there's something is happening in the
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:56.880]  last stay there stay there finish up with the motorcycles
[2:04:56.880 --> 2:05:00.160]  okay let me get back stay there

[2:08:06.480 --> 2:08:28.240]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:33.600]  all right steve quayle recap what your intel saying they're deploying
[2:08:33.600 --> 2:08:38.560]  with motorcyclists are they deploying something or are they receiving a
[2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:41.920]  vaccine or are they no they're alex are being given
[2:08:41.920 --> 2:08:46.240]  the bio-agent to release at a coordinated time across the country
[2:08:46.240 --> 2:08:50.080]  because look everybody knows that in the late summer going to the fall there's
[2:08:50.080 --> 2:08:53.200]  a lot of guys that are biking on the roads but what's fascinating is the
[2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:57.360]  ability of the bikers to draw less attention than let's say
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:01.200]  humbies or dark denalis or ucons or
[2:09:01.200 --> 2:09:05.280]  suburban or whatever so what is interesting to this though as i believe
[2:09:05.280 --> 2:09:08.480]  there are multiple strains this is what people have got to understand
[2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:11.840]  there are multiple strains that have been developed
[2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:16.960]  to check all along the efficacy of whatever vectors are using now what
[2:09:16.960 --> 2:09:21.200]  could be more innocuous than people obviously pulling into gas station or
[2:09:21.200 --> 2:09:26.160]  guys going down the road on their bikes with some type of an aerial
[2:09:26.160 --> 2:09:29.280]  dispersal thing hooked into a venturi and what's
[2:09:29.280 --> 2:09:32.320]  interesting to me is we have an eyewitness report
[2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:36.640]  of a gentleman who actually confronted i think there were a group of six guys
[2:09:36.640 --> 2:09:39.840]  and one of them was the head guy all eastern europeans
[2:09:39.840 --> 2:09:43.920]  and they basically got very nervous he also had his 45
[2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:47.120]  tucked into his pants and when they saw the
[2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:50.720]  pants they all looked at the head the uh...
[2:09:50.720 --> 2:09:53.920]  the bikers that weren't the leader looked at the
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:58.160]  leader for basically his indication of what to do and he kind of
[2:09:58.160 --> 2:10:02.240]  put his hand out like do nothing so the point is is that what i think that
[2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:05.600]  people have got to understand is that the clustering here's what everybody
[2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:09.520]  got to understand there are specific specific
[2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:13.120]  intel links that go to kansas university and some of the other
[2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:16.880]  universities of specific scientists here
[2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:22.160]  that are uh... uh... that have been communicating on high frequency radio
[2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:26.160]  and that they have been uh... how should i say this under the cover of a national
[2:10:26.160 --> 2:10:29.760]  institute of health or national science foundation grant program
[2:10:29.760 --> 2:10:34.080]  have been giving tips the fact that look they were going to initiate this
[2:10:34.080 --> 2:10:38.000]  in the universities and in the schools now let me stop you
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:42.160]  they are now this week having quarantines over people having the flu at
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:46.560]  universities all over the country to beta tests in a controlled area
[2:10:46.560 --> 2:10:50.640]  where they just show up and tell the young students you can't leave
[2:10:50.640 --> 2:10:54.480]  the states are passing laws to conform with the executive order
[2:10:54.480 --> 2:10:58.640]  that conforms with world health organization level six martial law
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:11:02.000]  rules so the point is the safety is off the trigger
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:07.200]  is cocked the tyranny gun is to our head and yes we've
[2:11:07.200 --> 2:11:11.040]  confirmed and had guessed on the universities all over the
[2:11:11.040 --> 2:11:14.640]  country months ago and then reports weeks ago
[2:11:14.640 --> 2:11:18.160]  are having national guard regular army doing drills
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:22.480]  of locking down the universities so clearly they were drilling
[2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:26.640]  to have that be the beta test to show everybody a lockdown
[2:11:26.640 --> 2:11:31.040]  so everyone is acclimated so we see the phasing
[2:11:31.040 --> 2:11:34.800]  and the scripting even before april when all of this started with the
[2:11:34.800 --> 2:11:37.280]  emergency managers at the city and county level
[2:11:37.280 --> 2:11:41.760]  in indiana and illinois and new york on this show and with the documents
[2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:45.760]  as the feds were saying flu will come this year millions will die
[2:11:45.760 --> 2:11:49.760]  there will be mass graves this is not a drill now the question is are they
[2:11:49.760 --> 2:11:53.920]  planning to go with a real flu or will the pathogen be in the shot
[2:11:53.920 --> 2:11:57.920]  or will it be in both to scare people and some of the vaccines not in some of
[2:11:57.920 --> 2:12:01.440]  the other different releases we know top virologists have said it is an
[2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:04.720]  engineered flu or is this just the fear mongering of the
[2:12:04.720 --> 2:12:09.040]  flu the cover to get the north com assets and other
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:12.560]  centralized command systems and other nations in place
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:17.040]  under the cover of the flu hysteria well let me say this it's going to be an
[2:12:17.040 --> 2:12:20.880]  integration of the flu to cover the financial disaster that's in the making
[2:12:20.880 --> 2:12:24.080]  and you can't you can't separate the fact that
[2:12:24.080 --> 2:12:28.400]  the international elite want to rid the planet of the population you and i have
[2:12:28.400 --> 2:12:32.240]  done years and years of validation and verification of all the different
[2:12:32.240 --> 2:12:36.560]  statements now we have in the last 48 hours china
[2:12:36.560 --> 2:12:41.360]  firing a shot across the financial bow basically saying we won't take any more
[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:44.880]  of america's junk paper declaring the whole class of
[2:12:44.880 --> 2:12:49.200]  financial instruments as derivatives as junk and gold is exploding
[2:12:49.200 --> 2:12:52.800]  gold is exploding and what that why that's critical alex is this
[2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:56.480]  the idea is that america was a great pillage and plunder and everybody that
[2:12:56.480 --> 2:12:59.360]  knows their piracy will know that after you break
[2:12:59.360 --> 2:13:02.400]  pillage and plunder what do you do you burn the cities okay
[2:13:02.400 --> 2:13:06.560]  and what's tragic is that i don't believe people in this country
[2:13:06.560 --> 2:13:11.600]  recognize how in the hell and it's hell literally the abomination that rises
[2:13:11.600 --> 2:13:15.920]  from hell can we send all our troops to afghanistan
[2:13:15.920 --> 2:13:19.840]  and iraq and meanwhile we're importing foreigners and we're seeing the
[2:13:19.840 --> 2:13:23.920]  prepositioning of minamaterials all over the country you remember all the crap
[2:13:23.920 --> 2:13:27.200]  i caught when i said there are you know 345
[2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:31.520]  thousand people in this country and all of a sudden now it's stated so how do you
[2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:35.200]  get that when the u.s military saying we don't have enough men to send over
[2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:38.880]  there but all of a sudden the magic number 395
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:42.800]  thousand show up well i mean in leo nine
[2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:46.400]  and guys put fema up on screen for people at prison planet dot tv
[2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:51.120]  radio listeners just google in leo nine and the top link that comes up
[2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:57.040]  is fema dot gov forward slash media forward slash facts forward
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:04.080]  sheets in leo nine the dot s htm and it says troops from foreign countries
[2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:08.720]  right there participating in responding to terrorism in the u.s
[2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:12.960]  it's right out in plain view i've had alex and you and i did the last show
[2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:17.760]  together that when i was on with you last i've had multiple law enforcement
[2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:22.720]  and military contacts absolutely tell me that they're noticing foreign
[2:14:22.720 --> 2:14:26.720]  observers assigned to the sheriff's department the highway patrol state
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:30.240]  before whatever you call it but one of the guys at steve he said look i'm access
[2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:35.040]  that special forces they said i know a hitter when i see one he said i was one
[2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:38.320]  and i said well and i'm just making this name up his name is not mike i said
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:42.080]  well mike then you know what he's there for and here's what this man who's
[2:14:42.080 --> 2:14:46.240]  a former special forces a major law enforcement and a hero to the law
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:49.360]  enforcement community said he said i know he's here
[2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:53.360]  to take out us after we've been ordered to do with the unconstitutional
[2:14:53.360 --> 2:14:57.680]  memorial and he said me and my men are not going to do it so alex what i'm
[2:14:57.680 --> 2:15:01.280]  saying to you is this the prepositioning of foreign
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:06.480]  observer flash assassins has already been integrated into many not all but
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:09.680]  many of the law enforcement agencies across the united states
[2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:13.680]  that is you and i have spoken about markets will we have spoken about you
[2:15:13.680 --> 2:15:16.240]  have any prima cop we have spoken about the department of
[2:15:16.240 --> 2:15:20.400]  homeland security hiring them and these are standard
[2:15:20.400 --> 2:15:23.760]  communist operating procedures and now we've got obama going to address
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:28.320]  all of the kids on the 8th of october the same kids are going to be held captive
[2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:32.160]  and their parents will be held captive but their kids are at school
[2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:36.720]  and i would imagine he's going to comfort them during the flu this is
[2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:39.200]  going to be the whole kickoff he's not saying that
[2:15:39.200 --> 2:15:42.880]  in fact i'm glad you brought that up i want to do that now van jones
[2:15:42.880 --> 2:15:46.800]  who works for the white house he's a czar over communications and community
[2:15:46.800 --> 2:15:50.720]  organizing the tens of billions they're handing out to these groups
[2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:54.640]  we're getting videos reports local news them in the red and black uniforms
[2:15:54.640 --> 2:15:58.320]  knocking on doors threatening people on video
[2:15:58.320 --> 2:16:01.680]  beating people up at town halls biting fingers off
[2:16:01.680 --> 2:16:07.040]  associated press i mean folks you cannot make this up we have al gore on on
[2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:10.080]  audio saying don't you know report on your parents
[2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:13.040]  their liars about global warming you know best
[2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:17.520]  uh... we've got obama to address the students asking for their help
[2:16:17.520 --> 2:16:22.480]  in his agenda i mean the folks you cannot again i can't believe
[2:16:22.480 --> 2:16:25.600]  this is happening in america i mean even though i knew it was coming
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:29.920]  it's now here it's kind of like the bully says he's meeting after school
[2:16:29.920 --> 2:16:32.560]  so school days over you walk out there he is
[2:16:32.560 --> 2:16:35.680]  he weighs fifty pounds more than you and you the fights on
[2:16:35.680 --> 2:16:39.840]  i mean the bully is now about to punch us in the nose
[2:16:39.840 --> 2:16:45.040]  and his arm is moving and and then the media matter says i'm a criminal and
[2:16:45.040 --> 2:16:49.280]  none of this exists here is van jones the community organizing
[2:16:49.280 --> 2:16:52.960]  uh... bully uh... saying on syndicated radio
[2:16:52.960 --> 2:16:56.240]  what's happening here it is uh... one of the things that have happened i think
[2:16:56.240 --> 2:17:00.880]  too often too progressive is that we don't understand the
[2:17:00.880 --> 2:17:04.640]  relationship between minimum goals and maximum goals
[2:17:04.640 --> 2:17:08.800]  uh... right after roza parks refused to give up her seat
[2:17:08.800 --> 2:17:12.480]  if the civil rights leaders had jumped out and said okay now we want
[2:17:12.480 --> 2:17:17.040]  uh... reparations for slavery we want uh... we just redistribution of all
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:20.560]  wealth and we want to legalize mixed marriages that have been there they
[2:17:20.560 --> 2:17:23.840]  come out with a maximum program the very next day
[2:17:23.840 --> 2:17:26.880]  uh... they've been laughed at uh... that they came out with a very minimum
[2:17:26.880 --> 2:17:30.000]  program uh... you know we just want to integrate these buses
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:33.440]  uh... the students a few years later came out with a very minimum program we
[2:17:33.440 --> 2:17:39.040]  just want to sit at the lunch counter but inside that minimum demand
[2:17:39.040 --> 2:17:42.960]  was a very radical kernel that eventually
[2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:46.000]  meant that from nineteen fifty four nineteen sixty eight
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:48.160]  you know complete revolution with on the table
[2:17:48.160 --> 2:17:51.840]  uh... for this country and i think that this green movement has pursued those
[2:17:51.840 --> 2:17:54.720]  same steps in stages right now we're saying we want
[2:17:54.720 --> 2:17:58.640]  uh... to move from suicidal great capitalism to some kind of
[2:17:58.640 --> 2:18:03.280]  uh... eco capitalism where uh... you know at least we're not
[2:18:03.280 --> 2:18:06.240]  you know that tracking the destruction of the whole planet
[2:18:06.240 --> 2:18:09.440]  uh... will that be enough no it won't be enough
[2:18:09.440 --> 2:18:13.360]  uh... we want to go beyond existence of exploitation and oppression all
[2:18:13.360 --> 2:18:17.120]  together but that's a process and i think what's great about
[2:18:17.120 --> 2:18:20.960]  uh... the movement is beginning to emerge is that the crisis is so severe
[2:18:20.960 --> 2:18:24.160]  in terms of joblessness violence and now ecological
[2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:29.120]  threats that people are willing to be both very pragmatic and very visionary
[2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:32.720]  and uh... so the green economy will start off
[2:18:32.720 --> 2:18:37.920]  as a small subset and uh... we will we're gonna push it and push it and push it
[2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:40.960]  um... until it becomes the engine for transforming
[2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:45.440]  the whole society my guest has been van jones founder and president of green
[2:18:45.440 --> 2:18:50.880]  for all you guys know van jones van jones is
[2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:54.720]  this is his house apparently van jones all right
[2:18:54.720 --> 2:18:59.360]  so van jones we were so delighted to be able to recruit him into the white house

[2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:06.480]  been active out in oakland and all of the ways that he has
[2:19:06.480 --> 2:19:10.560]  the creative ideas that he has it's okay that's enough that's the white house and
[2:19:10.560 --> 2:19:12.800]  him in the white house and then them thanking him
[2:19:12.800 --> 2:19:17.280]  the issue here is this is not communism or for the people even if you believe in
[2:19:17.280 --> 2:19:20.480]  that this is big banks openly say they're going to take over the whole
[2:19:20.480 --> 2:19:24.000]  economy and those parasites you see are going to move into the middle class

[2:25:20.720 --> 2:25:25.680]  putting us all on slave camps he is a slave master
[2:25:25.680 --> 2:25:31.440]  steve quayle your comments on that i'm sorry i i i didn't want to interrupt you
[2:25:31.440 --> 2:25:34.640]  well i think the thing is is i'm glad you played that clip because here's the
[2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:38.400]  deal when you've got someone that's ahead of the treasury who doesn't pay his
[2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:41.520]  income tax and then you get an announcement that the irs is going
[2:25:41.520 --> 2:25:45.920]  after delinquent taxpayers who have lost their jobs or basically had to forfeit
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:49.840]  their houses this is the ultimate hegellian dialectic
[2:25:49.840 --> 2:25:54.080]  if americans do not stand up with their free speech and i got to tell you alex
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:59.040]  concurrent with speaking out is also getting on our knees and repenting
[2:25:59.040 --> 2:26:03.680]  because the people have been apathetic indifferent are largely the evangelical
[2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:07.040]  christian community they still don't get it and now when
[2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:10.880]  ban jones and his ilk these are hardcore communists
[2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:14.080]  the bottom line is the weather underground has gone on record as stating
[2:26:14.080 --> 2:26:17.440]  they are going to kill anyone who stands in their way
[2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:22.480]  now you've got the uh... a president coming to address the school kids on
[2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:26.240]  debate how dare he make his appeal that's exactly
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:30.560]  what the hitler youth was based on and ladies and gentlemen they steal terms
[2:26:30.560 --> 2:26:34.080]  reinvent the meaning and then go after like alex princess when they're
[2:26:34.080 --> 2:26:36.880]  claiming that anybody who believes in a conspiracy
[2:26:36.880 --> 2:26:40.560]  is in need of psychiatric help it's the freaking
[2:26:40.560 --> 2:26:44.800]  psychiatrist that have screwed up more lives than they've solved and i'm
[2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:49.840]  standing by that statement if i i said on your show they identify they fill
[2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:53.920]  a bill if i make you a villain then they nullify to destroy
[2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:57.680]  ladies and gentlemen the greatest takeover is not
[2:26:57.680 --> 2:27:01.200]  the physical first of all it's the spiritual
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:04.720]  and it's followed by the financial one when you
[2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:08.640]  advocate your god-given uh... freedom and
[2:27:08.640 --> 2:27:13.040]  cease to speak out against evil it's very soon the chains that you choose to
[2:27:13.040 --> 2:27:17.520]  ignore are those that ensnare you about corruption when you've studied history
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:21.040]  and let's go with steve quell's telling you when you study history you begin to
[2:27:21.040 --> 2:27:25.280]  learn and realize that once you give into corruption it immediately races
[2:27:25.280 --> 2:27:29.040]  downhill and that's what the founder said they said the level of tyranny you
[2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:32.400]  will live under is the exact amount you will put up with
[2:27:32.400 --> 2:27:36.560]  and and and and it i know it's never really happened here but it's happened
[2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:42.400]  everywhere else this is real tyranny this is why this is why this up
[2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:46.560]  in pits and shoot us in the back of the head this is put us in work brigades
[2:27:46.560 --> 2:27:50.640]  with little control freak dirt bags riding around on horses
[2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:54.080]  the cattle prodding us i'm sorry see go ahead well first of all i've been on
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:57.280]  record is telling the people in the military there's a word going on even
[2:27:57.280 --> 2:28:00.400]  to the point of taking down four of his marriages heroes
[2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:03.760]  in a uh... blackhawk over dember now alex that's
[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:07.680]  mainstream news but what people don't understand is those brave men in the
[2:28:07.680 --> 2:28:12.720]  blackhawk wouldn't go along with the plan to basically get rid of 25 to 50
[2:28:12.720 --> 2:28:15.920]  million americans then jump to the intelligence committee
[2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:18.880]  which i've been telling everybody behind the scenes
[2:28:18.880 --> 2:28:22.320]  based on the information coming to me that there's a word going on
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:25.760]  and even to the point where someone in the former national security agency
[2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:30.000]  just a couple weeks ago quit alex and now he's running for his life
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:35.520]  because he said i will not be a part of the death of 25 to 50 million americans
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:39.200]  now look at this um people say well that the economy is turning around the
[2:28:39.200 --> 2:28:42.400]  economy is turning around ladies and gentlemen if you watch the mainstream
[2:28:42.400 --> 2:28:45.920]  news you are absolutely in the brain dead
[2:28:45.920 --> 2:28:50.160]  group already you cannot think for yourselves because you are accepting
[2:28:50.160 --> 2:28:53.120]  the fact that someone will tell you what's going on
[2:28:53.120 --> 2:28:56.400]  instead of doing your homework to say how can this be
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:28:59.840]  that the stock market is at record levels when unemployment is
[2:28:59.840 --> 2:29:03.680]  absolutely being multiplied when we've got the situation where the chinese
[2:29:03.680 --> 2:29:07.040]  basically said to the american investment community
[2:29:07.040 --> 2:29:11.200]  go to hell your financial instruments are total trash
[2:29:11.200 --> 2:29:15.520]  alex do you know what that means that means one quadruillion dollars
[2:29:15.520 --> 2:29:18.800]  is called into question because there are no counter parties
[2:29:18.800 --> 2:29:22.960]  to take and that is when you create a vehicle investment vehicle
[2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:26.400]  you have a buyer and a seller and when the the
[2:29:26.400 --> 2:29:29.920]  buyers say it's all garbage and they write it off
[2:29:29.920 --> 2:29:33.600]  that means that the whole uh uh if you will the whole
[2:29:33.600 --> 2:29:36.800]  characteristics all of the context of those financial
[2:29:36.800 --> 2:29:40.480]  uh derivatives are being repudiated it's great to happen
[2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:44.800]  steve stay there we're gonna come right back to you after this quick break
[2:29:44.800 --> 2:29:48.080]  i want to look at how you see this unfolding

[2:31:03.920 --> 2:31:07.840]  buying a solar power generator this summer number one new climate legislation
[2:31:07.840 --> 2:31:09.920]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:31:09.920 --> 2:31:14.400]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[2:31:14.400 --> 2:31:17.920]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[2:31:17.920 --> 2:31:20.880]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:31:20.880 --> 2:31:24.560]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:31:24.560 --> 2:31:27.440]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[2:31:27.440 --> 2:31:31.040]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[2:31:31.040 --> 2:31:34.080]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[2:31:34.080 --> 2:31:36.880]  outages number five a solar power generator
[2:31:36.880 --> 2:31:39.440]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[2:31:39.440 --> 2:31:42.800]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[2:32:06.640 --> 2:32:10.640]  penetrated our power grid even as energy experts are reporting that each
[2:32:10.640 --> 2:32:14.400]  summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid
[2:32:14.400 --> 2:32:18.320]  some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the
[2:32:18.320 --> 2:32:22.800]  grid over its edge creating a cascade of power outages across the country
[2:32:22.800 --> 2:32:27.040]  putting us all in the dark are you prepared for the next round of storm
[2:32:27.040 --> 2:32:30.960]  related outages or government created blackouts have you ever thought about
[2:32:30.960 --> 2:32:35.360]  taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of
[2:32:35.360 --> 2:32:38.320]  electrical power if so this will be the most important
[2:32:38.320 --> 2:32:42.480]  information you have ever heard solar powered generators are finally

[2:33:12.880 --> 2:33:16.160]  then for 20 30 minutes or so we have chuck ball one
[2:33:16.160 --> 2:33:19.360]  running mate who was at the my act report hearings in missouri
[2:33:19.360 --> 2:33:22.400]  about the feds making local police secret police
[2:33:22.400 --> 2:33:26.240]  listing gun owners veterans ron paul supporters libertarians
[2:33:26.240 --> 2:33:30.320]  christians as terrorist period so that's coming up
[2:33:30.320 --> 2:33:34.560]  then we've got the lady out of Lubbock suing obama
[2:33:34.560 --> 2:33:40.240]  over using the fake name morocco obama when it's very sataro on his passport
[2:33:40.240 --> 2:33:43.760]  so whether he was born in kenya or not the issue is he's got a fake name
[2:33:43.760 --> 2:33:47.120]  this guy is a total mystery man we're going back to steve quail to break down
[2:33:47.120 --> 2:33:50.960]  how he sees things unfolding and if in his expert opinion i really respect
[2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:54.640]  steve he thinks we have ways of changing
[2:33:54.640 --> 2:34:00.160]  this or having another outcome i think we do but i'm not sure about that or
[2:34:00.160 --> 2:34:03.280]  i want his take on it but for the next three minutes i drug ted anderson in
[2:34:03.280 --> 2:34:06.320]  here ted anderson bought a bunch of gold and
[2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:13.520]  silver when it was 905 911 915 920
[2:34:13.520 --> 2:34:20.720]  and he's got different groups at different prices gold is at 993 plus
[2:34:20.720 --> 2:34:23.200]  today
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  gold is up just a massive amount today gold is up over 13 dollars and 60
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:38.240]  cents today it's up over 50 bucks in the last week
[2:34:38.240 --> 2:34:41.440]  it is pushing a thousand and that's steve was starting to talk about well we'll
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:44.720]  get steve's take up or ted goes on this because steve's also a big researcher on
[2:34:44.720 --> 2:34:49.600]  the economy for years and a big supporter of gold
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:53.920]  but a lot of things are happening with the economy right now the dollar
[2:34:53.920 --> 2:34:57.360]  is doing strange things the economy is doing strange things the media is
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:35:00.960]  saying everything's wonderful they wanted to fear monger to get you to give
[2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:04.000]  up all your liberties and freedoms and accept the bank of the world but things
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:07.520]  are deteriorating so fast now they're telling you everything's great but
[2:35:07.520 --> 2:35:11.680]  main street is contracting while they dump trillions into the stock market
[2:35:11.680 --> 2:35:15.360]  which is now starting inflation going and that was on the news today
[2:35:15.360 --> 2:35:19.040]  so i want to bring ted anderson up for mitis resources because he can't
[2:35:19.040 --> 2:35:23.840]  hold this much longer ted tell folks why we see gold exploding
[2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:27.200]  30 years in the business mitis resources and then tell them about the gold and
[2:35:27.200 --> 2:35:32.080]  silver you've got at the super lower prices in the market is now
[2:35:32.080 --> 2:35:36.320]  well the the bottom line is the world market does not want to have us dollars
[2:35:36.320 --> 2:35:39.120]  as as the main exchange for currency
[2:35:39.120 --> 2:35:42.400]  across the globe they're trying to get away from that factor
[2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:45.520]  the united states is printing money like crazy the
[2:35:45.520 --> 2:35:48.560]  tarp money and everything that's gone into the bailouts that's why you're
[2:35:48.560 --> 2:35:52.320]  seeing gold and silver go up the velocity of that money is entering into the
[2:35:52.320 --> 2:35:55.920]  marketplace and pushing up pushing up commodity prices
[2:35:55.920 --> 2:35:59.760]  right now gold is just peaking at a thousand dollars an ounce
[2:35:59.760 --> 2:36:02.960]  alex the only reason why i didn't change my prices today
[2:36:02.960 --> 2:36:06.960]  is not because i have the inventory so much anymore is because i haven't had
[2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:10.640]  time to catch up to what's going on in the marketplace it's going crazy right
[2:36:10.640 --> 2:36:13.440]  now so i have my prices still posted at
[2:36:13.440 --> 2:36:17.040]  yesterday's prices i won't have it like this tomorrow unless
[2:36:17.040 --> 2:36:19.760]  of gold takes a big dive and i doubt that'll happen
[2:36:19.760 --> 2:36:24.720]  but we are sitting right now with those Lakota coins at 19 dollars and 70 cents
[2:36:24.720 --> 2:36:29.200]  priced at what silver was close to what 1350 when i put them there
[2:36:29.200 --> 2:36:34.640]  and it's over 15 bucks an ounce and we have gold the Franks right now at 216
[2:36:34.640 --> 2:36:39.840]  i mean that's down when gold is about 920 and now gold is sitting at a thousand
[2:36:39.840 --> 2:36:43.760]  uh... british sovereigns 266 i mean we have
[2:36:43.760 --> 2:36:47.520]  you know tremendous amount of different items there i would suggest if you're
[2:36:47.520 --> 2:36:50.880]  going to be getting involved with gold i mean it it doesn't take a rocket
[2:36:50.880 --> 2:36:53.840]  scientist right now you can see the prices moving up you should be calling
[2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:57.520]  us now and getting it now explain to people the different
[2:36:57.520 --> 2:37:00.240]  levels on the different gold and silver offers briefly Ted
[2:37:00.240 --> 2:37:03.520]  the different levels you bought in it and then you're passing those savings on
[2:37:03.520 --> 2:37:06.400]  you're not raising prices like all the other gold and silver brokers
[2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:10.880]  you've got it on hand right now at prices they can't get it anywhere else
[2:37:10.880 --> 2:37:14.000]  well that that's the reason why i'm seeing that Alex is because of the fact
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:18.720]  that i have been buying into the dips and we've seen 945 we've seen 913
[2:37:18.720 --> 2:37:22.000]  we've seen 916 and when i see that coming around
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:25.680]  i do buy i try to get in contact with any wholesalers that i have
[2:37:25.680 --> 2:37:29.680]  or anybody that has supply and i try to buy as much as i can
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:32.640]  just due to the fact i mean most normal circumstances
[2:37:32.640 --> 2:37:36.160]  you wouldn't do this but i i just know that goal will come back around every
[2:37:36.160 --> 2:37:38.960]  time they beat it up i get in there and i buy
[2:37:38.960 --> 2:37:41.920]  because it only makes sense to me that's going to come back around again
[2:37:41.920 --> 2:37:44.640]  because we haven't solved the financial problems of this
[2:37:44.640 --> 2:37:48.240]  this country certainly not yet and right now is a great opportunity to be
[2:37:48.240 --> 2:37:52.240]  getting in plus also i can say surely without a question
[2:37:52.240 --> 2:37:56.640]  like for instance just take that Lakota coin for example the last time i priced
[2:37:56.640 --> 2:38:00.800]  it it was it was i would have to put them at $20 and 40 cents
[2:38:00.800 --> 2:38:04.400]  if indeed i just priced it off where silver is right now just take let's
[2:38:04.400 --> 2:38:08.640]  call it $15 and 50 cents an ounce that's going to put that closer to
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:12.800]  9 closer to 2150 you know so you know that's just
[2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:16.400]  the way that that's what the market is done you're using technical terms per
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:21.120]  ounce you bought gold at what
[2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:26.000]  yeah well the goal that i picked up it was around that 9 11 to 916 level when
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:29.760]  i was picking up francs and selling for that $216 level in the
[2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:33.760]  british sovereign so so you so so most of this goal was bought at the 9
[2:38:33.760 --> 2:38:40.800]  915 916 you're selling it with that factored in uh at the 992 plus level
[2:38:40.800 --> 2:38:43.840]  folks give ten anderson minus resources a call they'll be there till midnight
[2:38:43.840 --> 2:38:48.560]  tonight 800 686 2237 800
[2:38:48.560 --> 2:38:54.080]  686 2237 do not procrastinate the globalist hate it when you buy
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:38:58.320]  silver and gold this is a win-win-win extremely good deal
[2:38:58.320 --> 2:39:04.400]  insanely good deal 800 686 2237 or minus resources dot com tell them it's the
[2:39:04.400 --> 2:39:07.920]  alex jones special or you'll pay the 990 levels
[2:39:07.920 --> 2:39:11.920]  not the 915 916 level you know 70 something
[2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:16.000]  80 something bucks cheaper so again 800
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:20.720]  686 2237 ted anderson thank you so much for popping in with us
[2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:23.920]  yeah thanks for having me up alex you bet steve i apologize for making you hold
[2:39:23.920 --> 2:39:27.120]  the last four minutes but i know that's important you were getting into
[2:39:27.120 --> 2:39:30.080]  the economy but we went to break i wanted to get into flew
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:33.760]  and in the overall picture how you see this unfolding and how we can hopefully
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:36.400]  stop it any chances we've got of that but briefly
[2:39:36.400 --> 2:39:39.200]  gold what's your view on what's happening with the economy
[2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:42.800]  well the bottom line is that the engineer collapsed of the western
[2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:46.400]  banking system and again to all the pundits who said it would never happen
[2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:50.960]  it's happening and the situation is again alex to put it into perspective
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:55.760]  the chinese have just stated who owns the most u.s dollar
[2:39:55.760 --> 2:39:59.040]  foreign reserves is china china's taken those reserves
[2:39:59.040 --> 2:40:03.440]  and is buying all the natural resources around the world rightly so
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:07.760]  at least one thing people out understand about the asian mentality
[2:40:07.760 --> 2:40:12.160]  even in that world of china and hong kong etc
[2:40:12.160 --> 2:40:17.680]  is you still have a certain honor amongst those who trade on uh...
[2:40:17.680 --> 2:40:22.320]  on an international basis when the united states issue toxic waste
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:25.840]  weapons of financial mass destruction and when the chinese
[2:40:25.840 --> 2:40:30.160]  see that obviously there is no attempt by the current administration to reign
[2:40:30.160 --> 2:40:34.720]  in spending the reason they're spending like there's no tomorrow is because they
[2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:38.480]  know the u.s dollar is dead it will have a fake rally
[2:40:38.480 --> 2:40:42.000]  it will rally long enough to allow the international bankers to get out of
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:45.680]  all the dollars they can look the international discount on dollars is
[2:40:45.680 --> 2:40:49.440]  already up to i'm told to 40 percent in other words if you want to dump a
[2:40:49.440 --> 2:40:53.600]  billion u.s dollars for something else you're going to take a 40 percent hit
[2:40:53.600 --> 2:40:57.440]  most of the money if not all the money that was gone into the
[2:40:57.440 --> 2:41:00.800]  tarp program and everything else to bail out the banks listen
[2:41:00.800 --> 2:41:04.400]  the middle class is being destroyed let me make it simple
[2:41:04.400 --> 2:41:09.360]  basic economics 101 if you don't have a job and don't have money
[2:41:09.360 --> 2:41:12.560]  you can't buy a house and you can't have any fun
[2:41:12.560 --> 2:41:15.520]  you can't go recreating you can't do anything that's why the
[2:41:15.520 --> 2:41:19.360]  the hospital or excuse me the hotels are are crashing they're going into
[2:41:19.360 --> 2:41:25.200]  receivership restaurants everybody is running out of cash and even service
[2:41:25.200 --> 2:41:28.400]  uh... one of the biggest hedge funds just tonight access to the funds i've been
[2:41:28.400 --> 2:41:33.680]  telling people if you have an ira kio 401k any of those divine benefit plans
[2:41:33.680 --> 2:41:37.120]  you're going to be locked out of them and today one of the stories that post on
[2:41:37.120 --> 2:41:40.800]  my website steve quail to you a while e dot com
[2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:44.640]  is the fact that different hedge funds don't have the money
[2:41:44.640 --> 2:41:48.400]  real simple alex here's the easiest thing to tell everybody
[2:41:48.400 --> 2:41:51.840]  every single bit of capital the united states
[2:41:51.840 --> 2:41:56.400]  has been pledged or stolen pledged or stolen
[2:41:56.400 --> 2:42:00.080]  and all we're doing is creating more debt monetizing the debt
[2:42:00.080 --> 2:42:03.680]  and then uh... flipping the responsibility for the debt off on the
[2:42:03.680 --> 2:42:07.040]  taxpayer they're spending like there is no end so what do we have we have
[2:42:07.040 --> 2:42:10.720]  the emerald or we jump into an asian-backed commodity
[2:42:10.720 --> 2:42:15.280]  basket of currencies brazil russia india china could come up with a brick
[2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:19.200]  basket of currencies uh... with a partial commodity backing
[2:42:19.200 --> 2:42:24.320]  but here's the deal all there's a famous statement that money and gold
[2:42:24.320 --> 2:42:29.120]  go from weak hands to strong hands and the strongest guys on the block right
[2:42:29.120 --> 2:42:31.920]  now are the chinese jimmy rogers has warned about it
[2:42:31.920 --> 2:42:35.280]  there are a lot of us have been warning about it for 15 years but when you're
[2:42:35.280 --> 2:42:39.120]  ahead of time no one believes you until the time and when the time comes
[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:42.800]  that they're seeing with our eyes you know how they respond they deny it
[2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:46.240]  they deny it but they can't deny when they don't have anything in their
[2:42:46.240 --> 2:42:49.120]  checking account alex when this thing goes down
[2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:53.280]  and there will be i have in my possession the letters that have been
[2:42:53.280 --> 2:42:57.200]  initiated by a specific bank holding company to inform
[2:42:57.200 --> 2:43:01.360]  of their clients is not internet bowl you know what
[2:43:01.360 --> 2:43:05.680]  at that basically everyone will be given a certain amount of money to withdraw
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:08.880]  from their account they quote an executive order that's already been
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:13.280]  signed all safety deposit boxes will be seized ladies and gentlemen
[2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:16.560]  this is coming and just because it didn't happen on the 26th
[2:43:16.560 --> 2:43:20.080]  i can tell you point blank that they are getting ready
[2:43:20.080 --> 2:43:22.640]  to tank the economy the international bankers
[2:43:22.640 --> 2:43:27.280]  300 million americans have been raped pillaged and plundered now they're
[2:43:27.280 --> 2:43:31.280]  going to go to india and china and do the same thing there but the chinese
[2:43:31.280 --> 2:43:36.080]  are under their game and they're not going to buy into it
[2:43:36.080 --> 2:43:40.160]  steve quayle is there a way to avert this walk through
[2:43:40.160 --> 2:43:42.560]  walk through your view of what's going to happen
[2:43:42.560 --> 2:43:46.960]  with the flu how they could use that as a cover for their overall economic
[2:43:46.960 --> 2:43:50.160]  collapse and to roll out their their military forces
[2:43:50.160 --> 2:43:53.760]  well i think alex you've just said it it's all it's all going down at the
[2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:57.280]  same time too many people think of linear when you read the writing on a
[2:43:57.280 --> 2:44:01.520]  basketball or baseball it goes over the entire surface of the ball
[2:44:01.520 --> 2:44:05.680]  so in essence to get the picture or to hear you know who manufactured the
[2:44:05.680 --> 2:44:09.200]  baldinger or whoever wilson the basketball and all the patents and
[2:44:09.200 --> 2:44:10.960]  everything else you got to look at the whole thing
[2:44:10.960 --> 2:44:14.160]  this is all being orchestrated simultaneously number one let's take
[2:44:14.160 --> 2:44:17.680]  it one two three the flu there are multiple strains of flu the one i'm
[2:44:17.680 --> 2:44:21.680]  worried about is the bola spanish flu of 1918 i've warned
[2:44:21.680 --> 2:44:25.520]  about it i've interviewed different bioscientists and different over the
[2:44:25.520 --> 2:44:30.080]  years different bioweapon years that's the one they also are worried about
[2:44:30.080 --> 2:44:33.600]  that's why all the scientists i know you had a show on our mention
[2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:36.880]  my list of dead scientists they were dead because they either worked on it or
[2:44:36.880 --> 2:44:40.160]  could have said to everybody hey wait a minute this is genetically altered
[2:44:40.160 --> 2:44:44.560]  so the thing is is that it's happening there's a story on the bbc it's on my
[2:44:44.560 --> 2:44:48.560]  front side of my news site today steve quayle.com alex that we're all
[2:44:48.560 --> 2:44:51.920]  being mutated okay mutated in other words all of the
[2:44:51.920 --> 2:44:55.760]  environmental toxins all of the food toxins all the genetically
[2:44:55.760 --> 2:44:58.880]  altered uh binders that are being put in first of all
[2:44:58.880 --> 2:45:03.360]  the thing that i want to say is this is that we can stand against this thing but
[2:45:03.360 --> 2:45:06.800]  we cannot stop it because again my and here's where you and i will differ
[2:45:06.800 --> 2:45:10.800]  we are in a period unlike any other period in the history of time
[2:45:10.800 --> 2:45:14.880]  it's not the end of the world but is that time when the new world order
[2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:17.680]  and alex i think you just said it about 30 minutes ago
[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:22.400]  if you've spoken against it so many times and so and you've done a fabulous job
[2:45:22.400 --> 2:45:26.240]  but when it's here it is here with such a ferocity
[2:45:26.240 --> 2:45:29.680]  in your face but the thing that hurts i don't know if it hurts you
[2:45:29.680 --> 2:45:33.760]  it breaks my heart that people who should have been fighting it
[2:45:33.760 --> 2:45:37.520]  instead of fighting us now they're in deep doo doo okay
[2:45:37.520 --> 2:45:40.960]  because there's nothing that's going to pull them out in essence
[2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:45.680]  unless america repents and this is my my final statement on this
[2:45:45.680 --> 2:45:49.840]  on the order of ninnabar where our days are numbered look
[2:45:49.840 --> 2:45:52.960]  uh... you know let's let's talk about the other thing the chinese did in the
[2:45:52.960 --> 2:45:54.960]  economy this is critical ladies and gentlemen
[2:45:54.960 --> 2:45:58.960]  hong kong has demanded london return their gold to hong kong for safe
[2:45:58.960 --> 2:46:02.560]  keeping uh saudi arabia has done the same thing guess what
[2:46:02.560 --> 2:46:05.920]  with all the funny business in the bank of england and all of the different
[2:46:05.920 --> 2:46:09.840]  job bank holding companies in and gold holding banks in
[2:46:09.840 --> 2:46:12.800]  london it's going to be hard but they're going to be hard pressed to
[2:46:12.800 --> 2:46:16.880]  be able to produce it so guess what once that is found out
[2:46:16.880 --> 2:46:20.640]  the price of the metal should explode it doesn't surprise me if they try and hit
[2:46:20.640 --> 2:46:24.080]  gold a hundred dollars from the high we may see uh you know a thousand fifty
[2:46:24.080 --> 2:46:27.520]  eleven hundred that'll go down a week but the next time it's going into
[2:46:27.520 --> 2:46:30.640]  martin armstrong's numbers and he's talking five thousand dollar gold
[2:46:30.640 --> 2:46:35.200]  the point is is that those who trusted the system
[2:46:35.200 --> 2:46:41.760]  they were like the willing accomplices to a massive gang rape and they wake up
[2:46:41.760 --> 2:46:45.120]  the following morning and know they've been violated by literally
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:48.560]  uh you know dozens of about hundreds of men and they figure out that they
[2:46:48.560 --> 2:46:52.240]  probably shouldn't have gotten drunk the night before but that's what what's
[2:46:52.240 --> 2:46:57.520]  what happens with the the intoxicating uh but see i want to go back i want to
[2:46:57.520 --> 2:47:02.240]  go back to flu i've been reading where they say it's a dna therapy one of the
[2:47:02.240 --> 2:47:06.640]  five vaccines it changes our dna that isn't a vaccine
[2:47:06.640 --> 2:47:11.040]  that's some type of weird mutagen right you're admitting to her it's monster
[2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:14.720]  making Alex look they're also putting in ladies and gentlemen
[2:47:14.720 --> 2:47:18.000]  remember we are sold to horse manure and your governor went along with it on
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:21.520]  Gardasil you know how many people are dying of Gardasil
[2:47:21.520 --> 2:47:28.480]  they're also putting in birth control it is eugenic it is genetic sterilization
[2:47:28.480 --> 2:47:33.360]  the entire human genome that is responsible for reproduction is being
[2:47:33.360 --> 2:47:37.040]  tampered so when the bbc says you know that 70 80
[2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:41.840]  mutagenica properties have been followed over the last 40 years isn't that
[2:47:41.840 --> 2:47:44.480]  amazing that since eugenics came into being
[2:47:44.480 --> 2:47:47.840]  even before that that now they're saying hey we're noticing
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:53.840]  all of these results of mutation listen the idea is this Alex God created men
[2:47:53.840 --> 2:47:59.040]  and and and in his image and likeness the devil wants to destroy that image and
[2:47:59.040 --> 2:48:05.040]  likeness and reproduce uh if you will a civilization a population of cyborgs
[2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:08.800]  and mutants and that's why the human genome project was
[2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:13.120]  funded in its entirety that's why all the secret government black projects and
[2:48:13.120 --> 2:48:16.080]  i know you don't like to talk about no no no no but it's saying i mean it's
[2:48:16.080 --> 2:48:21.920]  crazy as it sounds all these top bioethicists all these top
[2:48:21.920 --> 2:48:26.160]  futurist rake hers well they all say that that they're
[2:48:26.160 --> 2:48:29.520]  going to merge with machines and then the elites going to get rid of all the
[2:48:29.520 --> 2:48:33.040]  rest of us and they really do believe this
[2:48:33.040 --> 2:48:36.960]  well yeah they're like terminators out with retro rockets okay
[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:40.400]  the bottom line is that look i wrote the book genetic arm again
[2:48:40.400 --> 2:48:43.680]  and people just even and again i say this because
[2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:47.120]  if if the christians were the salt of the earth okay
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:51.280]  look alex you have done and i say this not in a flattering way but in a way of
[2:48:51.280 --> 2:48:54.800]  recognizing what you have done with all your movies is laid it out
[2:48:54.800 --> 2:48:58.560]  videos laid it out all your appearances everything you've done all your radio
[2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:01.680]  interviews all the people you've interviewed you've laid it out for
[2:49:01.680 --> 2:49:05.360]  everybody but isn't it fascinating that having done all that
[2:49:05.360 --> 2:49:11.280]  that's still of the anesthetizing of the american public is so strong
[2:49:11.280 --> 2:49:14.720]  and you say okay how can that be well it's real simple
[2:49:14.720 --> 2:49:19.360]  because ladies and gentlemen they are controlling everything you see
[2:49:19.360 --> 2:49:23.040]  everything you hear everything you think about everything you feel about
[2:49:23.040 --> 2:49:27.520]  and they're doing it in a in a uh in a masterful way
[2:49:27.520 --> 2:49:31.840]  trillions of dollars have been spent on mind control not just mk ultra and the
[2:49:31.840 --> 2:49:34.640]  stuff you've talked about alex but there are so many
[2:49:34.640 --> 2:49:39.040]  dark projects black budgets and so ladies and gentlemen
[2:49:39.040 --> 2:49:42.240]  in the name of jesus those of you who are called to be christians
[2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:46.080]  you must stand up and alex you asked me the bottom line question

[2:49:56.640 --> 2:49:59.680]  been right all these years and i'm saying that in
[2:49:59.680 --> 2:50:05.360]  contrary to my critics so far ahead of time my world view was given to me by
[2:50:05.360 --> 2:50:10.800]  the living god to honest people okay and a warning is only as effective as
[2:50:10.800 --> 2:50:15.920]  people pay attention to it your videos have been amazingly effective to those

[2:54:09.520 --> 2:54:15.200]  50 million people with hiv alone they have been caught nerve gassing
[2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:19.760]  foster children our own troops all declassified
[2:54:19.760 --> 2:54:23.920]  cancer viruses in the vaccine so i won't put anything past them
[2:54:23.920 --> 2:54:27.440]  we've never seen a massive military police state buildup
[2:54:27.440 --> 2:54:31.840]  like we've seen before april and the first flu fair mongering began
[2:54:31.840 --> 2:54:35.360]  they use that as their cover to get more stuff in position because they couldn't
[2:54:35.360 --> 2:54:39.360]  keep it secret i hope if we get the word out speak
[2:54:39.360 --> 2:54:43.760]  out warn people they won't go for broke obama demanding the kids
[2:54:43.760 --> 2:54:47.360]  you know go in and start getting orders from him on big plasma screen
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:54.560]  tv's in sports stadiums i mean right out of 1984
[2:54:54.560 --> 2:55:00.080]  i mean this is really happening and then major george soros funded publications
[2:55:00.080 --> 2:55:03.040]  like media matters saying i'm a liar none of this is happening
[2:55:03.040 --> 2:55:06.720]  as they announce it that's a military operation as they're attacking
[2:55:06.720 --> 2:55:11.360]  their broadcasting we're not attacking i mean that is a military operation right
[2:55:11.360 --> 2:55:14.560]  there when they that's when you know they're going for broke when they just
[2:55:14.560 --> 2:55:18.320]  start lying knowing it's going to blow their cover with a lot of people
[2:55:18.320 --> 2:55:20.640]  they they don't care because they got missiles
[2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:23.760]  locked onto the republic and they're now going for broke
[2:55:23.760 --> 2:55:26.720]  i'm seeing every indicator they're going for broke now
[2:55:26.720 --> 2:55:30.000]  if we get the word out we may get a repriever it may lessen whatever they
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:33.280]  pull but it's almost like as we awaken to them
[2:55:33.280 --> 2:55:37.520]  that just almost more ensures they're going for broke
[2:55:37.520 --> 2:55:42.960]  it's just so incredible so so steve what's the time frame then because they've
[2:55:42.960 --> 2:55:46.080]  backed the fair mongering back that you know they were saying september the
[2:55:46.080 --> 2:55:48.640]  government was saying they were going to start the force inoculations now
[2:55:48.640 --> 2:55:52.320]  they're saying late october november why are they moving the timetable back
[2:55:52.320 --> 2:55:56.960]  or is that a ruse i don't believe it's a ruse but i call it moments of mercy and
[2:55:56.960 --> 2:56:01.760]  i'm serious about that number one uh you know the the bible indicates and look
[2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:04.960]  i know you get a lot of flock when i talk about this alex but tonight i wanted
[2:56:04.960 --> 2:56:09.360]  you to understand i'm having rome my intercessor come on my show
[2:56:09.360 --> 2:56:12.560]  she's normally going to be on on thursday at that might take five time
[2:56:12.560 --> 2:56:17.200]  spot five o'clock a mountain and i'm going to ask her to pray for you and your
[2:56:17.200 --> 2:56:20.640]  family as well as others and i'm serious about this alex
[2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:26.880]  the deal is is that god has always moved in response to faith okay even
[2:56:26.880 --> 2:56:31.120]  abraham could there have been any righteous people found in uh
[2:56:31.120 --> 2:56:33.840]  saddam and gamora the hand of the lord would have been state but here's what i
[2:56:33.840 --> 2:56:38.240]  want to make clear to everyone ladies and gentlemen you cannot murder
[2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:42.080]  the babies that you've murdered now we get the government we deserve
[2:56:42.080 --> 2:56:46.560]  we kick jesus out of the school rooms now we got obama in the school rooms
[2:56:46.560 --> 2:56:51.840]  we've got every christian symbol covered up by every presentation of obama
[2:56:51.840 --> 2:56:55.280]  but and i i think i don't know who that lady is in love it but if any of you
[2:56:55.280 --> 2:56:59.200]  would know her give her a hug for me because ladies and gentlemen
[2:56:59.200 --> 2:57:03.920]  when you reject truth and the ultimate source of truth all you're left with
[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:07.360]  is lies building upon lies and alex what we're doing okay
[2:57:07.360 --> 2:57:12.160]  we can't stop it but we can buy time we can buy moments of mercy
[2:57:12.160 --> 2:57:17.120]  by interceding and intercession is critical when you tell people what's
[2:57:17.120 --> 2:57:21.760]  really going on you're interceding against the mind control when people
[2:57:21.760 --> 2:57:25.840]  pray really believing god that he's really going to act they can tell you
[2:57:25.840 --> 2:57:30.000]  that i've seen too many miracles in my life and no too many times when god is
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:33.760]  intervened to keep people alive in every single scheme
[2:57:33.760 --> 2:57:39.280]  plan plot against you in jesus name i pray it's spoiled and i pray for the
[2:57:39.280 --> 2:57:43.200]  living god alex to have his hand of mercy and protection over you
[2:57:43.200 --> 2:57:47.920]  your wife your children and and all of those who are brave enough and god bless
[2:57:47.920 --> 2:57:51.760]  each and every one of you to stand up against evil because the bible says
[2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:57.520]  that when you speak not out against evil you are basically siding with evil
[2:57:57.520 --> 2:58:02.080]  and i gotta tell you this 90 percent of the evangelical church everyone that
[2:58:02.080 --> 2:58:05.440]  gets together on sunday doesn't understand
[2:58:05.440 --> 2:58:09.360]  that they sit peacefully listening to some guy behind the pulpit
[2:58:09.360 --> 2:58:15.040]  who and everybody out there in the world of volusifarians is plotting their
[2:58:15.040 --> 2:58:19.360]  death their destruction and their annihilation well we know that it's an
[2:58:19.360 --> 2:58:22.480]  info war a war on for your mind a war on for your soul they

[2:58:32.880 --> 2:58:36.640]  facing they're clearly moving on every front

[3:01:51.520 --> 3:01:55.680]  but i keep telling people it's in the executive orders for quarantines
[3:01:55.680 --> 3:01:58.800]  it's in the executive orders to lock down cities
[3:01:58.800 --> 3:02:03.360]  it's in the executive orders to have force inoculations under level six
[3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:06.400]  and i told you in april we were under level six because i had the state

[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:22.640]  that information so they're definitely planning on
[3:02:22.640 --> 3:02:25.360]  this though it seems like the public isn't

[3:02:53.200 --> 3:02:56.960]  agitation in other words in order to spark the civil war
[3:02:56.960 --> 3:03:01.440]  the illuminati crave now they want a massive blood sacrifice you have
[3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:06.000]  documented through your uh your videos so many times of bohemian grove and
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:08.960]  everything that's why i'm so concerned about the
[3:03:08.960 --> 3:03:14.000]  hemorrhagic flu look i talked to guys that were spies and some of the most
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:17.760]  famous spies in the history of the united states and of the
[3:03:17.760 --> 3:03:20.480]  soviet union most people wouldn't even recognize their names
[3:03:20.480 --> 3:03:25.840]  and that's what they're telling about that this is the the idea is a massive
[3:03:25.840 --> 3:03:29.600]  sacrifice so when the bible in the book of revelations talks about pretty much
[3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:33.920]  before jesus comes there's going to be three billion people destroyed
[3:03:33.920 --> 3:03:37.280]  they're going to do it in whatever way the hemorrhagic flu is the
[3:03:37.280 --> 3:03:42.000]  ultimate ultimate viral infestation that will
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:46.320]  basically satisfy the bloodlust of the luciferian vampires
[3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:49.760]  and that's why there's 400 000 north com foreign
[3:03:49.760 --> 3:03:54.400]  and muslim mercenary troops already in their bases the time frame is now

[3:08:18.240 --> 3:08:22.560]  against me and you just talk about psychiatry and
[3:08:22.560 --> 3:08:27.440]  psychology itself how it's always used by the communist chinese
[3:08:27.440 --> 3:08:32.560]  by the nazis by the east germans by the soviets and now in the us
[3:08:32.560 --> 3:08:36.160]  i mean they say i'm a schizophrenic there's no world government
[3:08:36.160 --> 3:08:40.800]  there's no new world order there's no eugenics there's no john p holdren
[3:08:40.800 --> 3:08:44.880]  that's not in the associated press and then they got all these ads admitting
[3:08:44.880 --> 3:08:47.840]  the drugs they sell in here make you commit suicide
[3:08:47.840 --> 3:08:52.320]  i mean these are some dirty rotten people who just play games with people
[3:08:52.320 --> 3:08:56.480]  and screw folks up so i'm gonna go over it
[3:08:56.480 --> 3:09:01.520]  just and they know it too they they think it's funny how they pray on people
[3:09:01.520 --> 3:09:05.120]  how they run the public schools and brainwash people and teach the kids how
[3:09:05.120 --> 3:09:08.800]  to commit suicide through suicide education death education that actually
[3:09:08.800 --> 3:09:11.840]  makes more suicides happen because it puts the idea in the kids heads and
[3:09:11.840 --> 3:09:14.640]  teaches them how to do it that's all coming up
[3:09:14.640 --> 3:09:17.840]  but i wanted to bring up daryl castle former vice presidential candidate
[3:09:17.840 --> 3:09:22.000]  to chuck bald one and we appreciate him
[3:09:22.000 --> 3:09:28.000]  coming on with us he's a very interesting fella he's a commissioned
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:31.680]  officer in the united states marine corps we served for four years
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:34.720]  from the vietnam era of leaving the marines he went to graduate school in
[3:09:34.720 --> 3:09:38.400]  history at etsu and then entered the memphis state
[3:09:38.400 --> 3:09:45.040]  university law school where he graduated with a doctorate and he also runs a
[3:09:45.040 --> 3:09:49.120]  private firm that grew into daryl castle
[3:09:49.120 --> 3:09:52.080]  associates he started law firms in milwaukee wisconsin
[3:09:52.080 --> 3:09:56.320]  detroit and he spent 25 years of legal expertise in currently
[3:09:56.320 --> 3:10:00.000]  concentration areas of consumer bankruptcy and personal injury
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:04.400]  and he was the presidential vp running mate of course uh with
[3:10:04.400 --> 3:10:08.080]  chuck bald when it was listed his his supporters as terrorists
[3:10:08.080 --> 3:10:12.640]  bob bars is terrorist ron paul's is terrorist gun owners veterans
[3:10:12.640 --> 3:10:17.840]  number one threat in the dhs and my report and he went to one of the state
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:22.080]  hearings with the legislature on this last week so we thought we'd get him to
[3:10:22.080 --> 3:10:27.520]  pop in to talk about this in light of federal marshals going public
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:30.800]  saying they've been ordered to put innocent people at airports in databases
[3:10:30.800 --> 3:10:35.440]  just to show a terror threat and now the attorney general saying
[3:10:35.440 --> 3:10:38.800]  if you're on a no fly over a million two hundred thousand on it you'll not be
[3:10:38.800 --> 3:10:44.000]  able to own guns so we have also have fbi training videos for local police
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:48.480]  saying if somebody's got a cell phone put them in a terror database for life
[3:10:48.480 --> 3:10:52.720]  so it's just the total federalization the police being turned into secret police
[3:10:52.720 --> 3:10:57.120]  just and now you've got obama openly saying on october 8 the kids will all
[3:10:57.120 --> 3:11:01.840]  assemble in america with big screen tv's and auditoriums with him
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:05.840]  asking them to serve him with his agenda al gore auditoriums we're going to
[3:11:05.840 --> 3:11:08.560]  play this audio later it's up on the website
[3:11:08.560 --> 3:11:12.880]  saying that your parents don't know what they're doing global warming is real
[3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:17.120]  your parents are bad like people that wanted to keep blacks as slaves
[3:11:17.120 --> 3:11:20.960]  i mean we're entering a a a vortex of
[3:11:20.960 --> 3:11:26.400]  uh... of soviet nazi vacation and i wanted to talk to daryl castle
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:30.400]  about this mr castle good to have you on with us thank you alice alex is good
[3:11:30.400 --> 3:11:34.720]  to be with you uh... all this going on you heard me just break this down
[3:11:34.720 --> 3:11:40.400]  uh... your your take on being listed as a guy that's kind of a terrorist commander
[3:11:40.400 --> 3:11:44.720]  well yes i i guess that's right it uh...
[3:11:44.720 --> 3:11:49.920]  uh... it was rather uh... stunning to see really but uh...
[3:11:49.920 --> 3:11:53.840]  uh... they did apologize for that listing and uh... withdraw the report
[3:11:53.840 --> 3:11:57.760]  but i'm afraid that uh... is still there under some deeper
[3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:03.200]  uh... classification well absolutely missouri of course was just a clone of
[3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:05.840]  federal and that came out the dhs report
[3:12:05.840 --> 3:12:10.080]  i can tell us uh... what it was like when you learned of this in the campaign
[3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:14.400]  uh... that ron paul stickers chuck balvin stickers constitution party stickers
[3:12:14.400 --> 3:12:17.920]  go ahead and pull people over asking questions ron paul supporters being
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:20.320]  stopped at airports now and ask about it
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:24.000]  and then go into these hearings what you learned well
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:27.760]  the interesting thing for me about the hearings was the uh...
[3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:31.360]  the back and forth with the legislators and questions that they
[3:12:31.360 --> 3:12:36.960]  ask me after i spoke but listening to the testimony of the police officers
[3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:41.360]  that they had there and how they use this report and what they thought about
[3:12:41.360 --> 3:12:45.040]  the entire mic process and that's one of the things
[3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:49.520]  was fascinating because they had two uh... police captains from the
[3:12:49.520 --> 3:12:53.200]  kansas city police department both of them are fine
[3:12:53.200 --> 3:12:58.480]  officers are creating poster type officers and one of them is directly
[3:12:58.480 --> 3:13:02.800]  in charge of my act of using it and he uh...
[3:13:02.800 --> 3:13:07.760]  uh... talks about how they needed for officer safety
[3:13:07.760 --> 3:13:11.360]  uh... it's vital information that they just have to have and that they
[3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:16.480]  the real problem these officers thought was that this report was distributed
[3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:19.840]  to civilians uh... that did not understand it and
[3:13:19.840 --> 3:13:24.400]  who should not have had the information uh... it was that type of mindset
[3:13:24.400 --> 3:13:27.040]  rather than the fact that this report was uh...
[3:13:27.040 --> 3:13:31.360]  uh... was bad and shouldn't have been formulated to begin with
[3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:34.880]  uh... it's this information that the police department needs in other words
[3:13:34.880 --> 3:13:38.400]  and has to have uh... it was never intended for
[3:13:38.400 --> 3:13:42.640]  civilian eyes who they knew would not understand its true intent
[3:13:42.640 --> 3:13:46.400]  but let me just add sir we have the training videos you know we broke the
[3:13:46.400 --> 3:13:51.680]  my act report we broke the dhs they're putting you in databases
[3:13:51.680 --> 3:13:56.080]  as a terrorist or a terrorist supporter this is now upon our youtube channel
[3:13:56.080 --> 3:13:59.120]  but while we're talking maybe you guys can roll some of the video in the
[3:13:59.120 --> 3:14:02.320]  background because for those who just joined us we also simulcast
[3:14:02.320 --> 3:14:06.720]  the radio show as a tv show we have this fb i training video where
[3:14:06.720 --> 3:14:11.760]  they're putting you in databases uh... and and and now with this news out
[3:14:11.760 --> 3:14:15.680]  it's being used as a chilling effect and the attorney general saying
[3:14:15.680 --> 3:14:19.200]  no judge no jury no way to ever get off the list
[3:14:19.200 --> 3:14:22.560]  if you're listed as an extremist for being a veteran or a gun owner
[3:14:22.560 --> 3:14:26.320]  you don't ever get to own guns anymore well they told us uh...
[3:14:26.320 --> 3:14:30.480]  one of the legislators told me in this uh... in this hearing he said quite
[3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:35.200]  forthrightly that if you've got all the terror to walk terrorist watchlist
[3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:39.520]  he gave the procedure for getting off and said basically that it was
[3:14:39.520 --> 3:14:44.800]  impossible to ever get off no matter even if you were completely innocent
[3:14:44.800 --> 3:14:48.960]  you could never be removed from it so it is a frightening scenario i
[3:14:48.960 --> 3:14:51.760]  appreciate you breaking the story and uh...
[3:14:51.760 --> 3:14:55.360]  making it public well i'm not like bragging that we broke and i'm just
[3:14:55.360 --> 3:15:00.080]  saying we get sent all this material and it is if you know the soviet union
[3:15:00.080 --> 3:15:02.240]  nazi germany as i know you studied it
[3:15:02.240 --> 3:15:07.440]  if you know tyranny this is the most hard core
[3:15:07.440 --> 3:15:11.680]  tyranny i mean it's like the hope diamond of diamonds it's like the
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:16.240]  henry ford afford it's the adolf hitler of hitler i mean it's the
[3:15:16.240 --> 3:15:20.320]  it's the most hard core vicious horrible type
[3:15:20.320 --> 3:15:25.200]  and it's really happening and it it really is in this report uh... as i
[3:15:25.200 --> 3:15:29.120]  testified the other day my opinion was designed to
[3:15:29.120 --> 3:15:32.000]  to radicalize the police against legitimate
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:38.160]  mainstream political activity to create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation
[3:15:38.160 --> 3:15:43.040]  and it's uh... seems to be succeeding
[3:15:43.040 --> 3:15:46.880]  yeah if they win i mean if we stop saying okay we're for the second amendment
[3:15:46.880 --> 3:15:50.320]  okay we're for controlling the borders okay we're against abortion
[3:15:50.320 --> 3:15:53.520]  because we're going to be put on a secret police list
[3:15:53.520 --> 3:15:56.880]  and can't fly or homeland security saying have a job or own a gun
[3:15:56.880 --> 3:16:00.400]  i mean this is it if we give into this and shut up they win
[3:16:00.400 --> 3:16:03.280]  well that's exactly right and that's why i'm uh...
[3:16:03.280 --> 3:16:07.520]  spending so much time uh... traveling around the country talking to anybody
[3:16:07.520 --> 3:16:11.760]  that listen to me about it it is uh... it is terrible and it's
[3:16:11.760 --> 3:16:14.880]  difficult to understand that it's actually happening right here in front
[3:16:14.880 --> 3:16:19.280]  of us but uh... it's amazing to watch and to experience
[3:16:19.280 --> 3:16:22.560]  well when you were an officer in the marine corps back in the seventies
[3:16:22.560 --> 3:16:25.120]  could you have ever because i know this is what people were taught about the
[3:16:25.120 --> 3:16:28.480]  soviet union could you have ever imagined the police would be
[3:16:28.480 --> 3:16:32.480]  federalized in secret police and the number one threat would for homeland
[3:16:32.480 --> 3:16:35.920]  security and north com would be veterans and gun owners
[3:16:35.920 --> 3:16:39.840]  no i could never have imagined that but they did tell us uh... they sent us to
[3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:42.720]  the far east of that if we didn't go over there
[3:16:42.720 --> 3:16:46.240]  and fight them in the far east the communists would be crawling up the
[3:16:46.240 --> 3:16:52.160]  beaches in california as it turns out they were right
[3:16:52.160 --> 3:16:56.560]  well uh... i mean have you seen this that obama is going to make all the kids in
[3:16:56.560 --> 3:17:01.120]  the country muster before him with with with big movie screens as he
[3:17:01.120 --> 3:17:05.200]  as he quote asked them for help with his agenda i mean
[3:17:05.200 --> 3:17:08.560]  i'm pinching myself i mean i i can't even believe this
[3:17:08.560 --> 3:17:12.240]  mr. castle that's that's that all filler type stuff i i mean i can't believe
[3:17:12.240 --> 3:17:16.960]  any parent would uh... would allow their child to be subjected to that type of
[3:17:16.960 --> 3:17:20.720]  brainwashing but apparently they will
[3:17:20.720 --> 3:17:24.240]  well where does the constitution party go from here i mean but they didn't stop
[3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:26.880]  with you they said bob bar in the libertarians
[3:17:26.880 --> 3:17:31.200]  and they're pretty milk toast i mean i mean i mean is that
[3:17:31.200 --> 3:17:35.280]  is the milk man i mean they're gonna list apple pies terrorism next
[3:17:35.280 --> 3:17:38.880]  well ron paul is sitting u.s congressman was also listed
[3:17:38.880 --> 3:17:43.360]  he's a fairly common individual uh... and a lot of people support him in fact
[3:17:43.360 --> 3:17:47.040]  over two hundred seventy congressman endorsed his uh...
[3:17:47.040 --> 3:17:51.280]  audit the fed bill so you know he's really not that dangerous but
[3:17:51.280 --> 3:17:55.840]  uh... these folks are uh... they're amazing i'm telling you i i i suppose
[3:17:55.840 --> 3:17:59.120]  you're right it if you don't agree with them you're a terrorist that's what it
[3:17:59.120 --> 3:18:02.960]  comes down to i do think it's backfiring on them
[3:18:02.960 --> 3:18:06.080]  though i mean americans have enough memory of tyranny
[3:18:06.080 --> 3:18:09.680]  at least from hollywood of what it looks like and people that are veterans that
[3:18:09.680 --> 3:18:13.200]  have seen it around the world that that i
[3:18:13.200 --> 3:18:16.560]  but but these people aren't stopping they just they they say they're going for
[3:18:16.560 --> 3:18:20.320]  broke so how do you think this is all going to end
[3:18:20.320 --> 3:18:26.080]  um... i somewhat followed the line of reasoning that your former guest head
[3:18:26.080 --> 3:18:31.680]  uh... and so uh... it it looks terrible
[3:18:31.680 --> 3:18:35.440]  but we keep going and we keep fighting and uh... you know we pray that the
[3:18:35.440 --> 3:18:39.360]  american people wake up and stop delivering their hands into these
[3:18:39.360 --> 3:18:43.040]  their their children into the hands of these people and so forth
[3:18:43.040 --> 3:18:47.040]  stop buying their drugs and taking their vaccines and so forth
[3:18:47.040 --> 3:18:52.880]  uh... and perhaps uh... it can at least be slowed down
[3:18:52.880 --> 3:18:56.480]  well that's another thing uh... october eighth because they're still doing this
[3:18:56.480 --> 3:18:59.840]  obama thing everyone should not send their children to the government
[3:18:59.840 --> 3:19:04.240]  schools at least on that day i mean there should be a big sick day that day
[3:19:04.240 --> 3:19:08.400]  you're right we need somebody to go ahead and go
[3:19:08.400 --> 3:19:11.520]  though and maybe send a hidden camera with their kids to like
[3:19:11.520 --> 3:19:14.960]  imagine the footage of that i guess we'll show it on the news the kids like
[3:19:14.960 --> 3:19:18.960]  swearing allegiance i mean it says that to the president not to the
[3:19:18.960 --> 3:19:22.640]  not to the constitution well you can go back and see films of that
[3:19:22.640 --> 3:19:26.480]  thirties when hitler spoke at his gigantic rallies and
[3:19:26.480 --> 3:19:30.400]  you know it's so reminiscent of those types of things that you see on the
[3:19:30.400 --> 3:19:34.240]  history channel now yeah the history channel known as
[3:19:34.240 --> 3:19:36.800]  the hitler channel that's all they cover yeah in fact
[3:19:36.800 --> 3:19:41.280]  he made them swear allegiance to him above the constitution
[3:19:41.280 --> 3:19:46.000]  and again we can play clip after clip with the president calling for national
[3:19:46.000 --> 3:19:49.680]  compulsory domestic paramilitary service stay there
[3:19:49.680 --> 3:19:52.880]  mr. castle of vp with chuck balvin constitution party

[3:24:26.160 --> 3:24:31.200]  a legend i appreciate your time today
[3:24:31.200 --> 3:24:34.480]  what else happened during the testimony we heard there was testimony about
[3:24:34.480 --> 3:24:38.000]  provocateur anarchist and then complaining they couldn't get anybody
[3:24:38.000 --> 3:24:41.920]  doing anything illegal what are some of the other
[3:24:41.920 --> 3:24:48.880]  areas well the the the focus of the hearing was really on how can we
[3:24:48.880 --> 3:24:52.480]  prevent this from happening again this legislative
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:24:57.600]  committee in missouri has set up to look at ways to prevent this type of
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:25:01.760]  political profiling and so forth so that was the direction the police
[3:25:01.760 --> 3:25:04.720]  testified that they needed the information
[3:25:04.720 --> 3:25:08.720]  and every single person who who testified other than the police
[3:25:08.720 --> 3:25:12.560]  talked about how bad it was and there were
[3:25:12.560 --> 3:25:17.040]  some of the legislators were very much on our side and
[3:25:17.040 --> 3:25:20.320]  essentially tried to feed us questions that would
[3:25:20.320 --> 3:25:24.800]  allow us to elaborate on our positions and that sort of thing but
[3:25:24.800 --> 3:25:29.520]  i have no doubt that this report is is still out there under a deeper
[3:25:29.520 --> 3:25:32.400]  classification and i tried to address with the
[3:25:32.400 --> 3:25:35.840]  committee that what i was really concerned about is the mindset of the
[3:25:35.840 --> 3:25:40.560]  people who who wrote this thing and the fact that
[3:25:40.560 --> 3:25:44.400]  even though they may apologize the information is still there
[3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:48.640]  the police still have it and that entire mindset still exists
[3:25:48.640 --> 3:25:54.240]  and so they are profiling legitimate political thought that's protected by
[3:25:54.240 --> 3:25:57.600]  the first amendment and they are radicalizing the police
[3:25:57.600 --> 3:26:00.800]  against legitimate political action and political
[3:26:00.800 --> 3:26:03.760]  thought and it does create an atmosphere of
[3:26:03.760 --> 3:26:06.880]  fear and intimidation in the minds of people who
[3:26:06.880 --> 3:26:11.360]  who live in missouri who might have a Baldwin castle bumper sticker or a
[3:26:11.360 --> 3:26:16.080]  ron paul bumper sticker who might fly through one of their airports
[3:26:16.080 --> 3:26:19.760]  or something like that and you know that unfortunately
[3:26:19.760 --> 3:26:22.800]  i don't see any indication from this hearing that
[3:26:22.800 --> 3:26:30.240]  that behavior has stopped they are simply looking at ways to prevent
[3:26:30.240 --> 3:26:38.160]  the public from knowing about it that was my take on the hearing as a whole
[3:26:38.800 --> 3:26:43.520]  well where does it go from here i mean do we just allow america to turn into the
[3:26:43.520 --> 3:26:46.960]  complete tyranny i mean the police come and then are
[3:26:46.960 --> 3:26:49.760]  defending it they think it's normal we've just
[3:26:49.760 --> 3:26:52.960]  incrementally gotten so deep into corruption that this is
[3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:56.240]  this is the new america and they just admit yeah we put innocent people on
[3:26:56.240 --> 3:27:00.960]  list and you don't have rights anymore no judge no jury i mean
[3:27:00.960 --> 3:27:04.400]  and and they built this whole homeland security apparatus saying it was for
[3:27:04.400 --> 3:27:09.600]  foreign terrorists and now they say oh it's really for you the american people
[3:27:09.600 --> 3:27:14.000]  well i'm afraid that uh alex that that's where we are and i i expressed that
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:17.520]  view to the committee a couple of the legislators asked me
[3:27:17.520 --> 3:27:21.760]  uh one lady in particular said well given your ideology
[3:27:21.760 --> 3:27:26.400]  uh what would you have us do what would your suggestion be for how we deal with
[3:27:26.400 --> 3:27:31.120]  this type of thing and i said well i i suggest that you you fair it out this
[3:27:31.120 --> 3:27:35.840]  information where it came from and fire everyone who uh who test didn't
[3:27:35.840 --> 3:27:40.960]  had anything to do with it and that you uh you do what you're obligated to do
[3:27:40.960 --> 3:27:43.680]  which is protect the liberty of the citizens of the state of
[3:27:43.680 --> 3:27:47.280]  missouri and i think this whole apparatus should be taken
[3:27:47.280 --> 3:27:51.840]  apart this whole myack apparatus that never assembled again
[3:27:51.840 --> 3:27:56.000]  and you should sever your relationship with these various fusion centers
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:28:00.160]  which the homeland security website says now there's 72 of them
[3:28:00.160 --> 3:28:06.480]  funded at 254 million dollars which is a hard thing to turn down
[3:28:06.480 --> 3:28:11.840]  by the way but uh i recommended that they they stand on their own two feet and
[3:28:11.840 --> 3:28:16.320]  sever their dependency on the federal government for law enforcement
[3:28:16.320 --> 3:28:20.960]  uh and that type of thing at least it's a start
[3:28:23.440 --> 3:28:29.520]  well look this is classical tyranny and the police in the military have to
[3:28:29.520 --> 3:28:33.200]  understand but this isn't a game this is real
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:38.800]  hardcore tyranny this is a real takeover and this is the real destruction of our
[3:28:38.800 --> 3:28:42.080]  republic and people just better decry this and
[3:28:42.080 --> 3:28:46.160]  say no and do something about it we can't allow this to continue
[3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:50.160]  we can't just give into this inchworm effect i played van jones the white
[3:28:50.160 --> 3:28:53.440]  house community organizing head saying they're

[3:29:28.080 --> 3:29:32.080]  and they don't understand why this type of thing is is bad
[3:29:32.080 --> 3:29:36.080]  and and where it's taking them as police officers who are out there

[3:36:49.200 --> 3:36:57.040]  i was like three months ago so i guess may or so but he calls me and he says oh
[3:36:57.040 --> 3:37:00.080]  interesting phenomenon about your show we're interested in it and i said
[3:37:00.080 --> 3:37:03.600]  this is a hit piece to say i'm a schizophrenic and he said no
[3:37:03.600 --> 3:37:07.920]  but that's you know paranoid like a schizophrenic and i said well no i mean
[3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:12.560]  the standard thing in the soviet russia nazi germany communist china
[3:37:12.560 --> 3:37:16.080]  and even here in the 20s 30s 40s 50s 60s right up to the 80s
[3:37:16.080 --> 3:37:19.840]  which you would take poor families kids and sterilize them and if they complained
[3:37:19.840 --> 3:37:23.840]  you'd lobotomize them and then he laughed and said we didn't do that so i
[3:37:23.840 --> 3:37:28.720]  sent him links to public lobotomies where they
[3:37:28.720 --> 3:37:31.600]  would stick a nice pick through the corner of the eye back into the brain
[3:37:31.600 --> 3:37:34.800]  and he would then laugh about that and deny it
[3:37:34.800 --> 3:37:38.400]  and i told him about psychiatry used by hitler and he'd laugh at that i told him
[3:37:38.400 --> 3:37:41.520]  about eugenics and he would laugh at that and i'd tell him about
[3:37:41.520 --> 3:37:45.200]  population control in u n documents and i'd give him links and
[3:37:45.200 --> 3:37:48.800]  he'd laugh about that and he he'd list the document that we listed
[3:37:48.800 --> 3:37:53.040]  that calls for using food as a weapon and starvation and sterilization
[3:37:53.040 --> 3:37:56.400]  and he just says the doc he doesn't say the document doesn't say that he just
[3:37:56.400 --> 3:38:00.800]  says it was a boring policy report
[3:38:00.800 --> 3:38:04.320]  and what they are is their control freak yuppies mainly
[3:38:04.320 --> 3:38:08.160]  who statistically have the highest mental illness rate
[3:38:08.160 --> 3:38:11.600]  and the highest suicide rate of any profession they're always caught raping
[3:38:11.600 --> 3:38:14.800]  their their their patients it's not a real medical
[3:38:14.800 --> 3:38:18.640]  system either psychiatrist or psychologist
[3:38:18.640 --> 3:38:22.320]  they just prance around drugging everybody they've got hundreds of new
[3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:27.120]  designations the last few years many of them for
[3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:29.760]  if you don't trust the government it's a mental illness
[3:38:29.760 --> 3:38:33.280]  and they say that in this article they say that well
[3:38:33.280 --> 3:38:38.000]  chemical imbalance in the brain makes you not trust the government
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:41.600]  and that it leads to schizophrenia and that they know that that's certain
[3:38:41.600 --> 3:38:44.720]  chemical in the brain and they're talking about me
[3:38:44.720 --> 3:38:48.560]  if they didn't test my blood they didn't test the dopamine levels in my brain
[3:38:48.560 --> 3:38:52.560]  they didn't do a biopsy
[3:38:53.440 --> 3:38:56.960]  they didn't do a cab and they just make this up i mean i'm here
[3:38:56.960 --> 3:39:00.960]  with the articles with the textbooks it's it's the same game though
[3:39:00.960 --> 3:39:05.120]  they know it's all real i mean we sent them the government documents
[3:39:05.120 --> 3:39:08.640]  it's just like the white house saying we don't want national compulsory service
[3:39:08.640 --> 3:39:11.840]  we don't want force youth brigades it's all conspiracy theorists
[3:39:11.840 --> 3:39:16.240]  media matters and george soros attacked me daily costs all these
[3:39:16.240 --> 3:39:19.920]  think progress all these government-run groups
[3:39:19.920 --> 3:39:22.880]  and then the president's going to address the school kids and ask for their
[3:39:22.880 --> 3:39:26.320]  help and they got city year and red and black uniforms and secure
[3:39:26.320 --> 3:39:31.200]  corps training with m16s to quote take on right-wing extremists and
[3:39:31.200 --> 3:39:34.480]  and you've got van jones saying we're going to incrementally take over
[3:39:34.480 --> 3:39:37.840]  for total redistribution of wealth from the wirehouse and
[3:39:37.840 --> 3:39:41.520]  we've got al gore you can just google it and you'll pull up the
[3:39:41.520 --> 3:39:46.400]  him in the town hall at a middle school telling the kids
[3:39:46.400 --> 3:39:50.640]  your parents believe for wrong it's like racism before it was young people
[3:39:50.640 --> 3:39:53.040]  that fought racism they always mix that in
[3:39:53.040 --> 3:39:57.920]  climate change is real i mean they're they introduced legislation that says
[3:39:57.920 --> 3:40:02.080]  national compulsory service ron emmanuals on tape saying it
[3:40:02.080 --> 3:40:06.000]  but they'll just laugh and say it doesn't exist your schizophrenic
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:10.880]  but this isn't working anymore people are seeing through it you have this
[3:40:10.880 --> 3:40:16.960]  this profession of witch doctors from 150 years ago founded in germany
[3:40:16.960 --> 3:40:21.680]  because the prussians wanted to literally have mind control slaves for the
[3:40:21.680 --> 3:40:24.800]  military that's on record kindergarten all of it
[3:40:24.800 --> 3:40:28.160]  was designed for this our whole current system
[3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:31.840]  and this is history and look at the first page of psychology today
[3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:35.520]  it's this psychotropic drug where this woman's a wind-up toy
[3:40:35.520 --> 3:40:40.000]  i've seen the tv ads for this and when she takes the drugs she's
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:48.240]  suddenly a smiling happy zombie now
[3:40:48.240 --> 3:40:54.000]  and it's got the drug over here and you know they have to go on admit oh it
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:57.840]  increases suicide risk and then you flip in some more and they've got
[3:40:57.840 --> 3:41:00.880]  some more drug ads and again these are the high
[3:41:00.880 --> 3:41:03.200]  priests that are going to teach you to be okay and
[3:41:03.200 --> 3:41:06.480]  they're going to explain to you how the universe works and you've got
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:11.360]  amplify that's a drug that you take
[3:41:11.360 --> 3:41:15.920]  for the other psychotropics that cause your psychotic
[3:41:15.920 --> 3:41:20.160]  break and then they've got a thing about old world order 9 11 and
[3:41:20.160 --> 3:41:23.760]  it's all about being trendy and how to get women and how your brain works
[3:41:23.760 --> 3:41:27.360]  i mean this is like for control freaks
[3:41:28.400 --> 3:41:34.720]  and it's got all these ads you'll be a psychologist you can make lots of money
[3:41:34.720 --> 3:41:39.040]  doing it and they've got other ads here for drugs and how
[3:41:39.040 --> 3:41:42.480]  great atheism is and
[3:41:42.480 --> 3:41:50.800]  it's just amazing and then you get to this page page 36
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:57.840]  and it's a two page drug ad 36 i mean 35 and 36
[3:41:57.840 --> 3:42:00.720]  now if i was talking to this psychologist and brought this up he would
[3:42:00.720 --> 3:42:05.280]  just not say anything or he'd laugh and i'd go does that ad exist and he would
[3:42:05.280 --> 3:42:08.800]  just giggle and say oh you're upset are you having a
[3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:11.680]  moment i mean this is just a mind game these are just
[3:42:11.680 --> 3:42:15.760]  scam artists i mean it's a joke but they find weak minded people they pray on
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:18.320]  the kids in the schools the new freedom initiative government's own
[3:42:18.320 --> 3:42:21.280]  documents they got leaked in 2005 said that they're
[3:42:21.280 --> 3:42:24.320]  planning to put half the school kids on drugs the new freedom is about
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:28.720]  diagnosing basically everyone is mentally ill
[3:42:28.720 --> 3:42:33.120]  and then it says right here
[3:42:33.120 --> 3:42:41.680]  Lamick toll or lemmick toll odt make this is like a candy it tastes good and
[3:42:41.680 --> 3:42:45.440]  dissolves in the mouth they say it's a psychotropic may cause suicidal thoughts
[3:42:45.440 --> 3:42:48.800]  or actions in very small number of people one in five hundred a lot higher than
[3:42:48.800 --> 3:42:52.800]  that studies actually show call a healthcare provider right away if you
[3:42:52.800 --> 3:42:56.880]  have worsening depression any unusual changes in mood or behavior or thoughts
[3:42:56.880 --> 3:43:00.720]  of actions about suicide and you actually read the full insert
[3:43:00.720 --> 3:43:04.320]  i mean it's delusions of grandeur psychotic breaks
[3:43:04.320 --> 3:43:10.080]  wanting to murder people now and it and it goes over to the next page with even
[3:43:10.080 --> 3:43:13.680]  more of the horrible effects just just scores of them just
[3:43:13.680 --> 3:43:17.760]  absolutely horrible this is like jumping off a cliff
[3:43:17.760 --> 3:43:21.040]  now they know that when you take these drugs you're gonna have more mental
[3:43:21.040 --> 3:43:24.720]  problems and the average person that goes on one ends up on
[3:43:24.720 --> 3:43:28.320]  four at a time on average and remember when they have foster kids under their
[3:43:28.320 --> 3:43:34.640]  control 68 to 69 national average they put on the drugs
[3:43:34.640 --> 3:43:39.040]  now i mean is that normal to put 69 of people on drugs
[3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:44.160]  then it says dark minds and it says i didn't have any friends in high school
[3:43:44.160 --> 3:43:49.600]  and i was of uh didn't want to give them friends names
[3:43:49.600 --> 3:43:54.480]  or family's phone number like i'm a liar that my family doesn't want to talk to
[3:43:54.480 --> 3:43:57.600]  them or i wouldn't have my friends the guy said it wasn't a hit piece right
[3:43:57.600 --> 3:44:01.520]  away it was and i said to the guy i said i wouldn't
[3:44:01.520 --> 3:44:04.240]  put my friends or family on the phone with you
[3:44:04.240 --> 3:44:08.800]  you know knowing that you lied and this is a hit piece
[3:44:08.800 --> 3:44:12.320]  uh but he doesn't say what i said he just says
[3:44:12.320 --> 3:44:15.840]  alex didn't have friends so it's all about being popular
[3:44:15.840 --> 3:44:19.840]  see but through him the the priest i can find enlightenment
[3:44:19.840 --> 3:44:24.720]  and i'm not in the junior high argument it's actually embarrassing how popular
[3:44:24.720 --> 3:44:29.440]  i was it's actually embarrassing
[3:44:30.720 --> 3:44:34.720]  that i mean the way i was in high school
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:38.080]  i mean i really cleaned up the last year or so and got straight as and got out
[3:44:38.080 --> 3:44:41.440]  of there but i mean it was you know the cheerleaders and drinking and
[3:44:41.440 --> 3:44:44.240]  fighting and having a great time and camping and
[3:44:44.240 --> 3:44:48.400]  just you know just it was a giant party i mean i you know but the point is
[3:44:48.400 --> 3:44:52.880]  is it doesn't matter he that isn't for me that's for the weak minded mainly
[3:44:52.880 --> 3:44:58.400]  women that read this oh look alex jones isn't cool
[3:44:58.400 --> 3:45:04.400]  i mean it's just total junior high mentality and it just lie after lie
[3:45:04.400 --> 3:45:10.720]  and they quote lewis black of the chronicle who's always
[3:45:10.720 --> 3:45:14.320]  made up stuff about me this is a guy who writes full page editorials in his own
[3:45:14.320 --> 3:45:18.400]  rag paper you know with stories in between the
[3:45:18.400 --> 3:45:24.320]  the porno shop ads that says that centra is not spanish home just
[3:45:24.320 --> 3:45:29.680]  totally has disdain and contempt for his readers thinks they're complete morons
[3:45:29.680 --> 3:45:33.040]  we're all conspiracy theorists to some degree we're all
[3:45:33.040 --> 3:45:37.200]  hardwired to find patterns of threat
[3:45:38.240 --> 3:45:41.600]  and it says information is the conspiracy theorist weapon of choice
[3:45:41.600 --> 3:45:45.440]  because if there's one thing they all agree on it's that all the rest of us
[3:45:45.440 --> 3:45:49.520]  have been brainwashed the facts will plainly reveal the existence of
[3:45:49.520 --> 3:45:53.360]  conspiracy they believe and while all of them you look at black water with rape
[3:45:53.360 --> 3:45:57.120]  rooms and murdering people we said that got called conspiracy theorists
[3:45:57.120 --> 3:46:00.400]  uh... cheney when the stage terror attacks now declassified we recall
[3:46:00.400 --> 3:46:03.360]  conspiracy theorists we said the nsa was spying on everybody
[3:46:03.360 --> 3:46:06.960]  now that's declassified we said obama setting up youth brigades now it's
[3:46:06.960 --> 3:46:12.560]  admitted i mean we're right about everything we go off the documents
[3:46:12.560 --> 3:46:17.200]  all while all of us tend to bend information to fit our pre-existing
[3:46:17.200 --> 3:46:21.120]  cognitive scheme oh everybody bends information no sir
[3:46:21.120 --> 3:46:25.280]  conspiracy theorists are more extreme they are immune to evidence
[3:46:25.280 --> 3:46:30.240]  really you're the one that's immune to evidence disconnecting
[3:46:30.240 --> 3:46:34.480]  contradictory information or seeing it as proof of how clever the enemy is at
[3:46:34.480 --> 3:46:40.400]  covering things up conspiracy theorists exist on a
[3:46:40.400 --> 3:46:44.480]  spectrum from mild suspicion to full of paranoia
[3:46:44.480 --> 3:46:49.440]  and brain chemistry may play a role
[3:46:52.480 --> 3:46:56.160]  dopamine rewards us for noting patterns and finding meaning
[3:46:56.160 --> 3:47:00.880]  in sometimes in significant events yeah if there's a saber-tooth tiger in those
[3:47:00.880 --> 3:47:04.720]  woods and you see him moving and pick up the pattern and can tell that's a big
[3:47:04.720 --> 3:47:07.600]  cat that means you survived and passed your genes on
[3:47:07.600 --> 3:47:10.560]  but i don't know how the genes of these psychologists got passed on they could
[3:47:10.560 --> 3:47:13.520]  have a cat right in front of them and say that's a conspiracy theory because
[3:47:13.520 --> 3:47:18.160]  they live in denial it's long been known that schizophrenics
[3:47:18.160 --> 3:47:21.840]  overproduced dopamine see we're schizophrenic the earliest stages of
[3:47:21.840 --> 3:47:25.200]  delusion are characterized by an overabundance of meaningful
[3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:29.120]  coincidence explained paul d morrison of r.m murray
[3:47:29.120 --> 3:47:34.080]  an institute of psychiatry at king's college london jumping to conclusions
[3:47:34.080 --> 3:47:39.280]  is a common reasoning style among the paranoid
[3:47:39.280 --> 3:47:42.560]  fine daniel freeman and his colleagues also at the institute of psychiatry
[3:47:42.560 --> 3:47:45.520]  indeed there are no coincidences in jones world
[3:47:45.520 --> 3:47:49.600]  and they seem from the obama deception jones dives into the belly of the beast
[3:47:49.600 --> 3:47:53.200]  the hotel where purported conspirators will be meeting it was in the news that
[3:47:53.200 --> 3:47:57.440]  world leaders with their setting policy the bill deberg brags they set policy
[3:47:57.440 --> 3:48:01.200]  we were being followed they did pull a fire alarm to blame it on us they told
[3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:04.720]  us they were going to do it he and i told that he just he just thought
[3:48:04.720 --> 3:48:09.200]  he told me on the phone that he didn't even believe there was a meeting going
[3:48:09.200 --> 3:48:11.600]  on that i mean i was literally he believes
[3:48:11.600 --> 3:48:15.760]  schizophrenically stumbling around the hotel with news cameras
[3:48:15.760 --> 3:48:19.600]  and that there weren't black cars there weren't sedans there weren't secret
[3:48:19.600 --> 3:48:23.440]  service there weren't guys pointing machine guns at us
[3:48:23.440 --> 3:48:31.360]  i mean i was having a full-on total hallucination
[3:48:31.360 --> 3:48:35.600]  and people reading this believe it he just talked about schizophrenia and now
[3:48:35.600 --> 3:48:40.640]  i'm having a
[3:48:40.640 --> 3:48:43.440]  and the thing is they cold-bloodily know it's true
[3:48:43.440 --> 3:48:47.680]  they just they're they they it's total scam
[3:48:47.680 --> 3:48:51.840]  i mean who do they pray on school kids with their drugs
[3:48:51.840 --> 3:48:55.280]  i mean this is this is in between ads where it says it makes you commit
[3:48:55.280 --> 3:48:59.680]  suicide you understand this guy over the phone
[3:48:59.680 --> 3:49:02.160]  denied that the lobotomies were done at public
[3:49:02.160 --> 3:49:07.440]  fairs with ice picks i mean you can just google ice picks lobotomies
[3:49:07.440 --> 3:49:12.400]  and it just it's mpr ap roiders he just it didn't true
[3:49:12.400 --> 3:49:15.600]  it didn't true he said
[3:49:15.600 --> 3:49:22.800]  jones says that he has been visited by the fbi secret service but can't discuss
[3:49:22.800 --> 3:49:25.760]  the interviews well he asked me have ever been visited by the feds and i said
[3:49:25.760 --> 3:49:31.040]  yeah but it's a court case gag order i told him
[3:49:31.040 --> 3:49:34.400]  i told he knows that in federal court cases and
[3:49:34.400 --> 3:49:38.560]  it's now in the ap and it's now in wired magazine
[3:49:38.560 --> 3:49:43.200]  and he doesn't care folks he just says i said so sick
[3:49:43.200 --> 3:49:46.640]  jones says that he has been visited by the fbi secret service but can't discuss
[3:49:46.640 --> 3:49:49.760]  the interviews it may be that the federal agents in fact
[3:49:49.760 --> 3:49:52.960]  want to evaluate whether he is a threat to the president
[3:49:52.960 --> 3:49:56.880]  and then he goes in about richard mccaslin then it says the war continues in
[3:49:56.880 --> 3:49:59.680]  a video promoting the obama deception jone urges
[3:49:59.680 --> 3:50:02.640]  we know who they are we know what they are we know what has to be done
[3:50:02.640 --> 3:50:06.240]  i'm talking about peacefully in that section getting the word out
[3:50:06.240 --> 3:50:09.600]  he cuts it out and makes it look like i'm calling for violence
[3:50:09.600 --> 3:50:13.920]  but he prays on his little stable of readers

[3:57:40.720 --> 3:57:44.480]  metals for as long as i have been this is a sign that the prices are going to
[3:57:44.480 --> 3:57:47.600]  be rising because we had a support level at about
[3:57:47.600 --> 3:57:52.800]  945 here recently the sellers ran out of gas at about that level
[3:57:52.800 --> 3:57:56.400]  and then the buyers would take over to start to move upward well notice bloom
