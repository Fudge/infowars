[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  While President Trump crisscrosses the country like the energizer bunny, simultaneously signing
[00:14.120 --> 00:19.240]  historic peace deals in the Middle East, maintaining a shell-shocked economy.
[00:19.240 --> 00:22.840]  Our economy, it's going to come back very, very strong.
[00:22.840 --> 00:27.280]  You know, we built the greatest economy anywhere in the world, nobody even close.
[00:27.280 --> 00:31.520]  We're going to have an incredible next year, and I look forward to it.
[00:31.520 --> 00:34.600]  And fending off the Democrat subversion.
[00:34.600 --> 00:36.360]  What a despicable man.
[00:36.360 --> 00:39.480]  How low can he go?
[00:39.480 --> 00:43.200]  I need you to be ready.
[00:43.200 --> 00:46.840]  And I need you to be ready to be responsive.
[00:46.840 --> 00:49.360]  I don't think I've heard of another Trump supporter being Trump.
[00:49.360 --> 00:50.360]  So the f*** what?
[00:50.360 --> 00:51.360]  You got shot.
[00:51.360 --> 00:53.360]  Is he alive?
[00:53.360 --> 00:55.360]  I believe he died.
[00:55.360 --> 00:56.360]  Tough luck.
[00:56.360 --> 00:58.360]  Don't be a f***ing Trump supporter in Portland.
[00:58.360 --> 00:59.360]  Bring your wife out here.
[00:59.360 --> 01:00.360]  Bring your daughter out here.
[01:00.360 --> 01:01.360]  Have them do that, f*** me.
[01:01.360 --> 01:06.360]  I love your wife, your daughter, your grandmother, all of them, the f*** out.
[01:06.360 --> 01:08.760]  Mitch McConnell sent out a statement tonight.
[01:08.760 --> 01:14.360]  This is a man who does not care about a dying woman's final wish.
[01:14.360 --> 01:15.360]  What am I saying?
[01:15.360 --> 01:16.360]  You say this?
[01:16.360 --> 01:17.360]  This?
[01:17.360 --> 01:18.360]  This?
[01:18.360 --> 01:19.360]  This?
[01:19.360 --> 01:20.360]  This?
[01:20.360 --> 01:21.360]  This?
[01:21.360 --> 01:24.080]  We need to size up what we are up against.
[01:24.080 --> 01:33.080]  And what we are up against is a profoundly corrupt, established network.
[01:33.080 --> 01:42.560]  Well, I have described him as an imposter and con man, and a would-be dictator.
[01:42.560 --> 01:53.400]  And when Trump oversteps the mark, they will fight back.
[01:53.400 --> 01:58.120]  In March, Irma Sayala, the first black state attorney elected in Florida, said her office
[01:58.120 --> 02:00.920]  would no longer seek the death penalty.
[02:00.920 --> 02:05.720]  Three months later, Kim Fox, the state attorney for Cook County, Illinois, announced her
[02:05.720 --> 02:10.520]  support for releasing nonviolent defendants without cash bail.
[02:10.520 --> 02:14.400]  Fox and Sayala are the latest in a string of progressive prosecutors who all have one
[02:14.400 --> 02:19.400]  thing in common, backing from the liberal billionaire George Soros.
[02:19.400 --> 02:23.520]  Let this moment radicalize you.
[02:23.520 --> 02:29.280]  17-year-old Andre Conley is shot and killed outside of a convenience store in Minneapolis.
[02:29.280 --> 02:33.040]  Conley was a senior at Patrick Henry High School in Minneapolis and served as a public
[02:33.040 --> 02:37.320]  outreach intern for Republican congressional candidate Lacey Johnson, who is running for
[02:37.320 --> 02:39.600]  office against incumbent Ilhan Omar.
[02:39.600 --> 02:41.520]  Pandering is upon us.
[02:41.520 --> 02:46.880]  Sleepy Joe Biden hit snooze on the campaign alarm clock, but finally left his basement
[02:46.880 --> 02:52.280]  to cajole those who would see our republic, diabolically dismantled, to join him with
[02:52.280 --> 03:02.200]  less than two months to go.
[03:02.200 --> 03:08.720]  On top of the millions dumped on Joe Biden's campaign, organizations with ties to Obama's
[03:08.720 --> 03:13.960]  old friends in the Muslim Brotherhood are a part of Biden's support group, a nod to
[03:13.960 --> 03:28.440]  a return to forever wars and those behind the Arab Spring.
[03:28.440 --> 03:34.920]  Torching of America in cahoots with the Biden-Soros Army already wreaking seditious havoc on
[03:34.920 --> 03:35.920]  America.
[03:35.920 --> 03:44.760]  Minneapolis communists from Freedom Road Socialist Organization claim credit for sparking recent
[03:44.760 --> 03:46.080]  riots that spread to more than 40 states.
[03:46.080 --> 03:49.040]  Freedom Road supports the Communist Party of China.
[03:49.040 --> 03:53.480]  Hi folks, this is Jess from Twin Cities Coalition for Justice for Jomar.
[03:53.480 --> 04:00.200]  The first two weeks after George Floyd was killed saw an intense high level of organizing
[04:00.200 --> 04:02.480]  all day and all night every day.
[04:02.480 --> 04:08.400]  I can't tell you the joy it brought all of us to see the Third Precinct destroy.
[04:08.400 --> 04:13.840]  There were marches, like I said, there were rallies, and lots of buildings were destroyed,
[04:13.840 --> 04:19.200]  some by fire, you know, some by brute force.
[04:19.200 --> 04:21.520]  Sometimes it was golf clubs, sometimes it was baseball bats.
[04:21.520 --> 04:26.240]  And a lot of folks wanted to get out to other sites around the cities where there is, you
[04:26.240 --> 04:31.960]  know, really pitched battles happening, and we support all of that.
[04:31.960 --> 04:38.000]  While President Trump offers the United States one last chance at redemption.
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.320]  Everything's going to be down the tubes, so whether you love me or hate me, you got
[04:42.320 --> 04:43.920]  to vote for me.
[04:43.920 --> 04:47.760]  John Bown reporting.
[04:47.760 --> 05:02.640]  Dependency, domestication.
[05:02.640 --> 05:08.800]  In the real world, ignorance is not bliss, it's enslavement and it's death.
[05:08.800 --> 05:12.440]  The globalists are teaching us all that we're non-essential.
[05:12.440 --> 05:15.960]  With automation, they're bringing in a world that doesn't empower humanity, but makes
[05:15.960 --> 05:16.960]  us obsolete.
[05:16.960 --> 05:19.560]  But we're not obsolete, we don't have to listen to them.
[05:19.560 --> 05:23.200]  We can farm again, we can garden, we can become self-sufficient.
[05:23.200 --> 05:28.800]  But first we've got to learn to stand up politically for ourselves, and we need to become self-sufficient.
[05:28.800 --> 05:33.480]  That begins with water filtration, to take control of that from the globalists and their
[05:33.480 --> 05:36.960]  fluoride and their dumbing down agenda, and with storable food.
[05:36.960 --> 05:43.040]  And we have it all, the highest quality, the highest rated, at the lowest prices at m4store.com.
[05:43.040 --> 05:44.440]  Take action now.
[05:44.440 --> 05:47.280]  You cannot lose unless you do not take action.
[05:47.280 --> 05:51.920]  We have the best water filtration, the best storeable food, and it funds the m4store.
[05:51.920 --> 05:54.120]  Take action now while you still can.
[05:54.120 --> 05:55.120]  Become prepared.
[05:55.120 --> 06:10.640]  Become self-sufficient now at m4store.com.
[06:10.640 --> 06:25.880]  It is September 21st on this Monday live edition.
[06:25.880 --> 06:32.800]  We are 42 days out from the election, and the globalist control left, not just here,
[06:32.800 --> 06:37.160]  but worldwide is going into total and complete absolute meltdown.
[06:37.160 --> 06:42.000]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this very important transmission as we kick
[06:42.000 --> 06:47.160]  off another live week with myself, David Knight, Owen Schreuer, Daniel Lorraine, and so many
[06:47.160 --> 06:50.240]  other of the amazing crew here.
[06:50.240 --> 06:51.840]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:51.840 --> 06:56.080]  Don't forget we have, now, through the election and through the inauguration, or through the
[06:56.080 --> 07:02.600]  Civil War, the new transmission called election countdown, and that is seven to nine weeknights
[07:02.600 --> 07:07.600]  hosted by myself, Donald Lorraine, Harrison Smith, Owen Schreuer, and many others.
[07:07.600 --> 07:09.640]  Okay, let's get right into it.
[07:09.640 --> 07:11.400]  Let's get right into how serious things are.
[07:11.400 --> 07:17.280]  Obviously, with Ruth Bader Ginsburg dying, everything has gone into high gear since Friday
[07:17.280 --> 07:23.840]  night, and the globalist corporate forces that are very close to capturing the planet
[07:23.840 --> 07:29.480]  and capturing the United States are now in full war mode and have everything to lose
[07:29.480 --> 07:39.080]  by not escalating, and so we can guarantee in a threat compendium or timeline that they're
[07:39.080 --> 07:44.360]  going to carry out a list of different criminal actions, not just here, but around the world,
[07:44.360 --> 07:51.960]  and we'll be laying some of those things out here with you today.
[07:51.960 --> 07:56.160]  But I want to say something right up front here.
[07:56.160 --> 08:00.760]  AOC is trained and funded by the globalist and by the radical Marxist communists, and
[08:00.760 --> 08:06.760]  she's funded by George Soros along with hundreds of DAs and attorneys that have now gotten
[08:06.760 --> 08:11.280]  elected to government at the county and city and state level, like Leticia James, the Attorney
[08:11.280 --> 08:19.440]  General of New York, and they are very far along in their criminal takeover, and when
[08:19.440 --> 08:27.040]  she came out Saturday night and said, we need to take the death of RBG and use Ginsburg's
[08:27.040 --> 08:33.880]  death to radicalize ourselves and to really get aggressive, why did she say that?
[08:33.880 --> 08:40.240]  Because they're the ones ramping up the physical attacks, the bullying, the murders, the killings,
[08:40.240 --> 08:45.200]  and she understands that we're headed into a very, very hot conflict that they're trying
[08:45.200 --> 08:49.960]  to initiate, whereas the average Christian, the average conservative, the average American,
[08:49.960 --> 08:55.120]  the average Brit, the average Aussie, the average Mexican, the average South African, the average
[08:55.120 --> 09:01.360]  you ever has been living under a period of limited turmoil compared to what we're about
[09:01.360 --> 09:02.360]  to go into.
[09:02.360 --> 09:08.400]  So I think the world's been crazy for the last 20, 30, 40 years.
[09:08.400 --> 09:15.080]  Get ready, it's about to go over the edge, and she understands that when they radicalize,
[09:15.080 --> 09:20.120]  we tend to not meet the threat at the same level because we're just shocked and overwhelmed
[09:20.120 --> 09:21.840]  by it.
[09:21.840 --> 09:27.560]  That's why I always say, you've got to get radical because they're radical, you've got
[09:27.560 --> 09:31.760]  to match that or surpass that to defeat them.
[09:31.760 --> 09:38.280]  These criminals have already conditioned us and already trained us to put up with incredible
[09:38.280 --> 09:43.480]  criminal activity on a regular basis, and so they're training us, even though we don't
[09:43.480 --> 09:47.760]  like it, even though we hate them, to accept that they randomly shoot police officers in
[09:47.760 --> 09:52.000]  the head and set up their own vigilante checkpoints and randomly shoot white people in the head.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.520]  They burn down police stations and federal buildings, and then the media gas lights us
[09:55.520 --> 10:00.840]  and tells us that they're nonviolent, and they're heroes, and you're bad.
[10:00.840 --> 10:05.640]  Then they come to people's bars and physically attack them in their businesses, and when
[10:05.640 --> 10:09.640]  they start physically attacking the bar owner and he shoots one of the people, he gets charged
[10:09.640 --> 10:10.640]  with murder.
[10:10.640 --> 10:16.520]  When he commits suicide, the state senator calls him a white supremacist with no evidence
[10:16.520 --> 10:22.680]  because there's no bottom to these individuals, so let's hear from AOC where she's giving
[10:22.680 --> 10:27.280]  orders to her troops to get more radical, as if all the radicalization and the buildup
[10:27.280 --> 10:31.680]  you've seen of George Soros and Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton's color revolution that
[10:31.680 --> 10:35.360]  we're facing, as if you thought that wouldn't get worse.
[10:35.360 --> 10:39.800]  This was only a dress rehearsal for what's coming, I've been telling you, in 42 days,
[10:39.800 --> 10:41.840]  and now they admit just that.
[10:41.840 --> 10:45.520]  Here is AOC from her rotting apple.
[10:45.520 --> 10:50.400]  Of all people that are deserving here in our country, which is everybody, everybody's deserving
[10:50.400 --> 11:01.120]  of safety and prosperity and justice, so listen, let this moment radicalize you.
[11:01.120 --> 11:12.520]  Let this moment really put everything into stark focus, because this election has always
[11:12.520 --> 11:16.600]  been about the fight.
[11:16.600 --> 11:19.600]  And then she goes on for equality in a better life.
[11:19.600 --> 11:25.520]  She's the one that's helping destabilize things and destroy the economy and run the lockdown
[11:25.520 --> 11:31.840]  and try to take the guns and funding the violence, but then she says it's Donald Trump's fault.
[11:31.840 --> 11:34.440]  That's the reason the economy's falling apart.
[11:34.440 --> 11:37.640]  That's the reason all of this is happening, and if you just get rid of Donald Trump, it
[11:37.640 --> 11:38.640]  will all get better.
[11:38.640 --> 11:43.720]  And what did Big Mike say, what Michelle said about a month ago, she said at the DNC, if
[11:43.720 --> 11:47.640]  you think things are bad, reelect him, we'll make it a lot worse.
[11:47.640 --> 11:52.360]  And Atlantic Monthly, The New York Times, The Washington Post all said, we're going
[11:52.360 --> 11:59.240]  to burn America down, America, if you don't elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, because
[11:59.240 --> 12:01.520]  they've already sold out to China.
[12:01.520 --> 12:07.840]  They've already parlayed the collapse of America into the new global government, and Obama
[12:07.840 --> 12:11.960]  and Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton and all of them already have positions at the United
[12:11.960 --> 12:18.640]  Nations, and big corporate jobs paying them 50, 60, $100 million a year, and billions
[12:18.640 --> 12:24.160]  of their foundations to sell the country out, and huge mansions by the sea they've got to
[12:24.160 --> 12:33.160]  pay for, the sea you have been told by Al Gore would already have flooded New York by 2017.
[12:33.160 --> 12:36.600]  So that's why they're so apocalyptic, and when you hear AOC say we'll all be dead in
[12:36.600 --> 12:41.640]  12 years, then she says we'll all be dead in 10 years a month later.
[12:41.640 --> 12:46.160]  You say that's ridiculous, but it's not, because they put their followers into a trance.
[12:46.160 --> 12:50.640]  Just like Joe Biden coming out four separate times, we're going to play just two of them
[12:50.640 --> 12:56.080]  here in a moment, and saying millions have died of COVID in the U.S., 200 million have
[12:56.080 --> 13:01.160]  died of COVID in the U.S., 6 million have heart failure from it, or bad lungs, none of that's
[13:01.160 --> 13:02.160]  even true.
[13:02.160 --> 13:09.280]  There's not even 200,000 dead, 94% died of something else, they just said COVID, that's all admitted.
[13:09.280 --> 13:13.880]  It's a pneumonia, it's manufactured so Gates can own it, it spreads, everybody's got it
[13:13.880 --> 13:18.240]  basically, so you can now be guilty, you can now be a suspect, now have your rights taken,
[13:18.240 --> 13:21.880]  we know the scam, we've cracked the code, we've got their number, they're making their
[13:21.880 --> 13:25.840]  big move, this is their big move, and it's not going well for them folks, so don't let
[13:25.840 --> 13:26.840]  them get you down.
[13:26.840 --> 13:32.000]  But remember they've got zombie followers, so when you're a zombie in a trance, chemically
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.480]  and culturally and electrochemically induced by the television flicker rate, and you see
[13:36.480 --> 13:41.520]  this doddering person up there telling you that more than half of America died when not
[13:41.520 --> 13:45.920]  even one tenth of one percent died, he's emblematic of the zombies.
[13:45.920 --> 13:52.920]  A zombie nation has a zombie president, and the evil anti-humans want this stupid ugly
[13:52.920 --> 13:55.600]  crypt keeper up there to demoralize us.
[13:55.600 --> 14:02.240]  So here's two clips back to back just recently of him saying millions are dead, 50% plus of
[14:02.240 --> 14:08.320]  the population is dead, and Snoop says it's true because you cannot tell a lie if you're
[14:08.320 --> 14:09.920]  Joe Biden, here it is.
[14:09.920 --> 14:16.960]  And perhaps, most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from
[14:16.960 --> 14:25.680]  COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that 200 million
[14:25.680 --> 14:30.600]  people have died, probably by the time I finish this talk.
[14:30.600 --> 14:38.840]  This is not a moment for excuses or deflections or blame game, we're in the middle of a pandemic
[14:38.840 --> 14:46.400]  that had cost us more than 85,000 jobs as of today, lives of millions of people, millions
[14:46.400 --> 14:52.440]  of people, millions of jobs, and we're in a position where we just got new unemployment
[14:52.440 --> 15:01.000]  insurance this morning, numbers, 36, 5 million claims since this crisis began, and almost
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.200]  3 million new claims in the last week.
[15:04.200 --> 15:09.080]  When employment rate is nearing 15%, the highest has been since the Great Depression, but
[15:09.080 --> 15:10.920]  I need not tell you all that.
[15:10.920 --> 15:17.720]  Of course, it's the least well-off for being hit the hardest, 40% of the households making
[15:17.720 --> 15:23.400]  $40,000 or less experienced a job loss.
[15:23.400 --> 15:27.720]  And what's incredible is, when he makes these giant mistakes, the media doesn't call him
[15:27.720 --> 15:32.520]  on it, he doesn't correct it, he just continues on, and people are watching this.
[15:32.520 --> 15:36.640]  Now, a lot of people think 200 million are dead, out of 330 million.
[15:36.640 --> 15:41.480]  They actually believe that, but notice that they sell our jobs out to China, Trump gets
[15:41.480 --> 15:44.720]  in and turns it around, then they kill the economy with a COVID lockdown, and then turn
[15:44.720 --> 15:47.560]  around and blame it on Trump and on Trump voters.
[15:47.560 --> 15:52.240]  What a disgusting group of criminals, these are traitors, these are Chinese communist agents,
[15:52.240 --> 15:56.920]  they should all be arrested, it's us for them.
[15:56.920 --> 16:02.720]  The planets have aligned globally, they've aligned nationally, they've aligned financially,
[16:02.720 --> 16:06.080]  culturally, but most importantly, spiritually.
[16:06.080 --> 16:12.080]  We are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future destiny
[16:12.080 --> 16:17.320]  of our species, and that's why big tech control with the very dark forces of the globalist
[16:17.320 --> 16:23.520]  is trying to dumb us down, isolate us, make us depressed, make us alone, and traffic control
[16:23.520 --> 16:28.360]  every aspect of our lives, literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward,
[16:28.360 --> 16:34.680]  because they do not want us to take our birthright, not just of Americana, but of true Christmastime
[16:34.680 --> 16:37.400]  and the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment.
[16:37.400 --> 16:41.520]  They are trying to create the new dark age, where they have all the high technology and
[16:41.520 --> 16:46.800]  life extension, and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon
[16:46.800 --> 16:51.680]  credits and through a social credit score, this is their plan.
[16:51.680 --> 16:56.600]  We must come together and awaken out of our trance and say, no, we must embrace God.
[16:56.600 --> 17:01.880]  I've come to you many times and asked for your support, and you've always come through,
[17:01.880 --> 17:03.680]  and Info Wars has come through.
[17:03.680 --> 17:08.440]  We've never sold out, we've never backed down, we've always told the truth, we've made mistakes,
[17:08.440 --> 17:14.280]  but 98% of the time or so, we're dead on, and the enemy knows that.
[17:14.280 --> 17:18.400]  Info Wars is a thought leader, not just here, but around the world, and that's why the
[17:18.400 --> 17:23.840]  chai comms, Hollywood, the globalists want us off the air, because their global plan
[17:23.840 --> 17:28.680]  of total tyranny and a post-human world will not succeed if we stay on air.
[17:28.680 --> 17:32.520]  If you don't support us, ladies and gentlemen, now, they're going to shut Info Wars down
[17:32.520 --> 17:34.720]  and shut everybody else down as well.
[17:34.720 --> 17:39.760]  You already know that, it's out in the open, so again, count the cost, focus, and realize
[17:39.760 --> 17:44.480]  how critical you are with your word of mouth spreading the word that overrides the censors,
[17:44.480 --> 17:48.160]  your financial support, getting the products at infowarstore.com, and your prayer.
[17:48.160 --> 17:49.160]  I'm praying for you.
[17:49.160 --> 17:50.160]  Please pray for us.
[17:50.160 --> 17:51.160]  Let's do this together.
[17:51.160 --> 17:52.160]  We're going to win.
[17:52.160 --> 17:53.920]  We are winning, but it's not going to be easy.
[17:53.920 --> 17:55.560]  The enemy's trying to take it all from us.
[17:55.560 --> 17:59.880]  Let's not let them succeed.
[17:59.880 --> 18:25.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:25.880 --> 18:43.880]  Forty-two days out, ladies and gentlemen, forty-two days out from the forces of globalism
[18:43.880 --> 18:49.840]  trying to fully complete their conquest of the United States, but humanity's waking
[18:49.840 --> 18:54.440]  up and fighting back, and there's no doubt Trump's going to win the landslide.
[18:54.440 --> 18:56.160]  The Democrats have admitted that.
[18:56.160 --> 19:00.320]  They're going to contest it and try to break the country up into a civil war.
[19:00.320 --> 19:06.280]  They're using Black Lives Matter as their political prop, even though ninety-eight percent
[19:06.280 --> 19:11.560]  of Black Lives Matter are white academics, Democrat party operatives, congressional and
[19:11.560 --> 19:13.240]  legislative staffers.
[19:13.240 --> 19:22.920]  They keep getting arrested, and our legislative directors, they are congressman's top aides.
[19:22.920 --> 19:25.240]  They are senator's aides.
[19:25.240 --> 19:29.960]  They are connected to the Chinese government.
[19:29.960 --> 19:36.240]  They are here to have a cover for the attempted overthrow of the United States, but they don't
[19:36.240 --> 19:40.640]  want the civil war to be, oh, the Democrats working with Communist China and the foreign
[19:40.640 --> 19:44.000]  banks are trying to overthrow the United States using our openness as a weakness.
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.560]  Oh, no, we're here because some cops in a few jurisdictions might have made a mistake
[19:48.560 --> 19:53.680]  or done something wrong, and so if the cops white and the guy that dies is black, why
[19:53.680 --> 19:57.680]  we've got to go out and attack all the white people, and there have been racial attacks
[19:57.680 --> 20:06.120]  on whites in the last few weeks accelerating, that are multiple deaths every day of police
[20:06.120 --> 20:10.640]  and citizens being executed because they're white and the media is covering it up.
[20:10.640 --> 20:16.240]  It is such an incredible crime, and look how they brainwashed BLM and ANTIFA to say death
[20:16.240 --> 20:21.280]  to America and to say they want the United States destroyed, and I've been here since
[20:21.280 --> 20:29.360]  black lives matter was founded, but with Soros money in 2016, over a billion dollars pumped
[20:29.360 --> 20:35.600]  into it, 200 plus million pumped in just last month saying they're a prop, they're a cover,
[20:35.600 --> 20:41.440]  they're a shield, they're a disguise, they're a black man mask, a black woman mask over
[20:41.440 --> 20:47.720]  George Soros' color revolution, and now that's what Trump says, it's what Town Hall says,
[20:47.720 --> 20:54.200]  it's what Sean Hannity says, it's what the Attorney General says because it's true,
[20:54.200 --> 20:58.640]  and the only reason I raise this is because if listeners and viewers don't understand
[20:58.640 --> 21:02.480]  what the enemy understands, we will lose.
[21:02.480 --> 21:06.440]  If you do understand this, we'll win, but it's not about attention, it's about you understanding
[21:06.440 --> 21:11.320]  how important you are because you're the info work, you're just as important as I am.
[21:11.320 --> 21:13.480]  We know the enemy blueprint.
[21:13.480 --> 21:17.840]  Remember just 10 years ago, global government doesn't exist, new order doesn't exist, there's
[21:17.840 --> 21:22.520]  no plan to lock you down under viral releases, Alex Jones is insane, there's no plan to
[21:22.520 --> 21:26.240]  try to get little boys to cut their genitals off, there's no pedophile agenda, it's all
[21:26.240 --> 21:28.440]  made up, Jones is totally insane.
[21:28.440 --> 21:31.960]  Everything I made films about, everything I wrote books about, everything we laid out
[21:31.960 --> 21:36.560]  is exactly what is progressing because it's an enemy battle plan.
[21:36.560 --> 21:41.600]  So there's all these thousands of flavors of political ideas and people always start
[21:41.600 --> 21:44.720]  their own political movement to make it look like they've done something new.
[21:44.720 --> 21:47.400]  There's two forces, good and evil.
[21:47.400 --> 21:55.240]  There's two forces, the American Renaissance and the pro-human future and the satanic anti-human
[21:55.240 --> 21:56.240]  future.
[21:56.240 --> 21:57.240]  Those are the two sides.
[21:57.240 --> 22:00.960]  And yeah, it sounds crazy to say they want a world government to carry out forced inoculations
[22:00.960 --> 22:06.480]  to sterilize you day one, then to use a global digital currency to control your behavior
[22:06.480 --> 22:10.760]  where if you don't do what they say in every other facet, they turn your digital credit
[22:10.760 --> 22:11.760]  off.
[22:11.760 --> 22:12.920]  That's called a social credit score.
[22:12.920 --> 22:18.300]  I laid that out in Endgame 13 years ago saying you'll have a digital number and a computer
[22:18.300 --> 22:25.760]  tracking system that rates you like a credit agency to decide who lives and who dies because
[22:25.760 --> 22:32.120]  it was all in the Club of Rome, Davos documents, it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents,
[22:32.120 --> 22:38.600]  make, marriage, and now the Attorney General understands what's going on.
[22:38.600 --> 22:42.200]  And he said this about BLM.
[22:42.200 --> 22:51.360]  The rule of law is the foundation of civilization, including economic prosperity.
[22:51.360 --> 22:59.800]  And that's why these so-called Black Lives Matter people, as a proposition, who can quarrel
[22:59.800 --> 23:04.200]  with the proposition Black Lives Matter, but they're not interested in Black Lives.
[23:04.200 --> 23:13.480]  They're interested in props, a small number of blacks who were killed by police during
[23:13.480 --> 23:19.880]  conflict with police, usually less than a dozen a year, who they can use as props to
[23:19.880 --> 23:23.120]  achieve a much broader political agenda.
[23:23.120 --> 23:31.920]  But I view the question of Black Lives as not only keeping people alive, but also having
[23:31.920 --> 23:35.600]  prosperity and flourishing in their communities.
[23:35.600 --> 23:37.240]  That's right.
[23:37.240 --> 23:41.440]  The corporate media funded by the enemies of this nation, which China literally owns
[23:41.440 --> 23:47.280]  Hollywood, most of the media now, is telling you that whites and blacks need to all kill
[23:47.280 --> 23:48.280]  each other.
[23:48.280 --> 23:52.240]  That's just one-on-one divide in Congress, how you bring a civilization down, how you
[23:52.240 --> 23:53.240]  sink the ship.
[23:53.240 --> 24:03.000]  But when we come back, I'm going to lay out how RBG, the Black Lives Matter Antifa Riots,
[24:03.000 --> 24:08.000]  and the global lockdown all tie together, because if you notice, whether it's Germany
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.360]  or Australia or New Zealand or Canada or the U.S., it's all the same groups, the same organizations,
[24:14.360 --> 24:19.200]  the same players that want to destroy the nation state, that want to destroy prosperity,
[24:19.200 --> 24:25.720]  that want to erase 800-plus years of British common law that's gone worldwide that is diametrically
[24:25.720 --> 24:34.440]  opposed to the Chinese model of legalism that is what you would call communism today.
[24:34.440 --> 24:39.760]  You get any philosopher on, any sociologist, anthropologist, historian, they understand
[24:39.760 --> 24:40.800]  these two competing systems.
[24:40.800 --> 24:46.040]  The globalists have adopted the Chinese legalist system, which is total tyranny, the original
[24:46.040 --> 24:55.040]  tyranny, versus the British common law of Magna Carta, 1215 run-a-mead.
[24:55.040 --> 25:03.040]  To the technocrats, you the commoner, I the commoner have a zzzz, zero rights, and we
[25:03.040 --> 25:13.200]  are 100 percent the chattel of the establishment and are to work ourselves to death as animals
[25:13.200 --> 25:24.800]  for them under run-a-mead and the Magna Carta, it is not our right, it is our duty, and that
[25:24.800 --> 25:31.480]  a person's home, whether they be the commoner or be the king of England, is their castle.
[25:31.480 --> 25:36.560]  And they threaten the king to cut off his head if he didn't sign the piece of paper.
[25:36.560 --> 25:43.280]  And what did the British Prime Minister Tony Blair say in 1997 in the BBC?
[25:43.280 --> 25:49.560]  He said our mission is to abolish the Magna Carta and merge with the European Union and
[25:49.560 --> 25:59.160]  in the future in a global community directed by the ideals of the Chinese legalists.
[25:59.160 --> 26:06.160]  Now you look into what a Chinese legalist is and you'll know, but it was the legal system
[26:06.160 --> 26:13.040]  of the emperors where you had no rights and these Chinese lawyers were God.
[26:13.040 --> 26:19.040]  And now you see, we're back under that again right now, so I'll decode it all, I'll lay
[26:19.040 --> 26:25.000]  it all out and tie it all together, but this is globally concerted, and I know as an audience
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.040]  you know that, but you've got to get your husband, your wife, your neighbor, your boss,
[26:29.040 --> 26:32.720]  your employees, your preacher, your dentist, you've got to get your auto mechanic, you've
[26:32.720 --> 26:37.060]  got to get your farmers, you've got to get the people aware that America and the world
[26:37.060 --> 26:42.240]  and the family and individualism is under attack and that all the freedoms we take for granted
[26:42.240 --> 26:48.840]  were paid for over 800 years of war, culminating in a civil war where the West led the end
[26:48.840 --> 26:53.440]  of slavery and lost millions of people, and now they turn around and blame us for saving
[26:53.440 --> 26:54.440]  the planet.
[26:54.440 --> 26:59.680]  Last week Tucker Carlson came out and said America is becoming the Soviet Union.
[26:59.680 --> 27:02.440]  In many ways we're worse than the Soviet Union.
[27:02.440 --> 27:07.120]  The Soviet Union couldn't dream of what big tech could do, surveilling and censoring us,
[27:07.120 --> 27:10.880]  and we're going to get a lot worse than the Soviet Union when it comes to forced inoculations
[27:10.880 --> 27:15.640]  and the medical tyranny being rolled out by the United Nations now in control of what
[27:15.640 --> 27:17.720]  you can and can't say online.
[27:17.720 --> 27:22.200]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, America is fighting for its life, and the enemy's
[27:22.200 --> 27:27.800]  number one mission is to get Trump out of office, and number two is to silence info wars, because
[27:27.800 --> 27:32.760]  we understand just how diabolical they are, just how evil they are, and we won't miss
[27:32.760 --> 27:33.760]  words.
[27:33.760 --> 27:37.080]  We know who the globalist are, we've got their number, and we know how to beat them, and
[27:37.080 --> 27:42.640]  we cover it seven days a week live at info wars, and it's only because of your support.
[27:42.640 --> 27:46.040]  So keep spreading the word, keep praying for us, and take advantage of the sales and get
[27:46.040 --> 27:48.680]  great products at infowarstore.com now.
[27:48.680 --> 27:54.880]  The globalists are hoping you don't visit infowarstore.com.
[27:54.880 --> 28:01.000]  And perhaps, most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from
[28:01.000 --> 28:09.760]  COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be, it's estimated that 200 million
[28:09.760 --> 28:14.280]  people have died, 200 million people have died.
[28:14.280 --> 28:17.320]  Probably by the time I finish this talk.
[28:17.320 --> 28:21.920]  Right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60% of America has died from
[28:21.920 --> 28:27.840]  COVID-19, when it's not even 200,000 reality, he would want to say 6 million have lung scarring
[28:27.840 --> 28:29.000]  and heart damage.
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.000]  It's all made up.
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  But you know where he got it?
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  The mainstream media that continues to actually say things like that.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.880]  They said that 4% of America would be dead already.
[28:38.880 --> 28:43.960]  Of course, it's.000 and then add a number, because the numbers vary.
[28:43.960 --> 28:48.640]  It's a real virus, just like people being struck by lightning is real.
[28:48.640 --> 28:54.280]  But to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is mind control.
[28:54.280 --> 28:57.480]  I've got some bad news for you, then I've got some really bad news, and then I've got
[28:57.480 --> 28:59.200]  some good news.
[28:59.200 --> 29:03.720]  The bad news is, even if Trump gets reelected, they're going to still trigger attempts at
[29:03.720 --> 29:07.560]  martial law, medical lockdowns, race riots, and a depression.
[29:07.560 --> 29:08.560]  That's the globalists.
[29:08.560 --> 29:10.280]  They're trying to bring America to our knees.
[29:10.280 --> 29:15.160]  Now, if Trump doesn't get elected, they're still planning to bring us to our knees and
[29:15.160 --> 29:20.080]  really try to break our will and bring us into a super intense depression, total control,
[29:20.080 --> 29:24.240]  and like Australia is already doing, rounding up and arresting people that criticize what
[29:24.240 --> 29:25.920]  the left are doing.
[29:25.920 --> 29:26.920]  That's the really bad news.
[29:26.920 --> 29:30.960]  The good news is, this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the world, and
[29:30.960 --> 29:34.400]  the resistance is mounting, and the globalists are panicking.
[29:34.400 --> 29:38.560]  So bottom line, we're in the fight, we're starting to win, but it's serious.
[29:38.560 --> 29:43.200]  So pray to God for a global awakening, support M4Wars, spread the word, and buy products
[29:43.200 --> 29:44.200]  at m4wars.com.
[29:44.200 --> 29:49.000]  Literally, we're having an emergency keep m4wars sale happening right now.
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.200]  Please visit m4wars.com and keep us on air.
[29:51.200 --> 29:53.880]  Thanks so much.
[29:53.880 --> 30:21.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[30:21.600 --> 30:31.880]  Most important election in the history of the U.S. and really the world is just 42 days
[30:31.880 --> 30:32.880]  away.
[30:32.880 --> 30:39.460]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and I don't have to remind listeners that the entire enemy
[30:39.460 --> 30:44.200]  globalist system is working around the clock to not just suppress us, but to suppress
[30:44.200 --> 30:45.200]  your voice.
[30:45.200 --> 30:49.400]  And when we were the first to be absolutely suppressed across the board in a coordinated
[30:49.400 --> 30:55.240]  campaign of silencing, demonization, lawsuits, criminal investigations, stalking, you name
[30:55.240 --> 30:56.240]  it.
[30:56.240 --> 30:59.000]  Folks asked, Jones, how are you taking it?
[30:59.000 --> 31:03.600]  And I said, really bad because I know they're coming for you.
[31:03.600 --> 31:04.600]  They're coming for everybody.
[31:04.600 --> 31:08.520]  So when Trump gets up there and says, listen, they're not mad at me, they're mad at you.
[31:08.520 --> 31:10.840]  They want to come through me to get at you.
[31:10.840 --> 31:12.480]  It's totally true.
[31:12.480 --> 31:17.040]  Within just two years, Trump reversed the one-sided trade policies that you couldn't do business
[31:17.040 --> 31:18.040]  here.
[31:18.040 --> 31:23.720]  Immediately the stock market went up and trillions flowed back in because they're like, oh, America
[31:23.720 --> 31:24.960]  is winning.
[31:24.960 --> 31:27.600]  America is back in business again.
[31:27.600 --> 31:32.240]  And then you saw the Democrats led by Bill Maher and others say, we got to kill the economy
[31:32.240 --> 31:35.480]  to make people hurt for supporting Trump.
[31:35.480 --> 31:39.120]  Well, if they just did it and got the blame, they'd get in trouble.
[31:39.120 --> 31:44.680]  But if they say it's a virus, a hyped up, exaggerated virus, where they say, oh, it's
[31:44.680 --> 31:49.960]  only 15 days to the hospitals aren't overwhelmed, and then once they got you locked down, they
[31:49.960 --> 31:51.920]  had you forever.
[31:51.920 --> 31:53.240]  Now it's just wear these masks.
[31:53.240 --> 31:55.160]  Oh, your business is not essential.
[31:55.160 --> 31:58.760]  You've got to be at 25% to make sure you can't pay your bills and go bankrupt.
[31:58.760 --> 32:02.400]  But it's only for a month, two months, six months, eight months.
[32:02.400 --> 32:04.920]  Oh, the UN says it's actually two years.
[32:04.920 --> 32:08.120]  Oh, it'll actually never go back to normal.
[32:08.120 --> 32:09.600]  And you're like, well, I'm going to complain about that.
[32:09.600 --> 32:10.840]  I'm going to march against that.
[32:10.840 --> 32:17.880]  That's your right as an Aussie or as a Brit or as a Scott or as a Canadian or as an American.
[32:17.880 --> 32:23.920]  And you try to go march and you get fined or you get arrested in places like the UK and
[32:23.920 --> 32:24.920]  Australia.
[32:24.920 --> 32:26.200]  We have more freedoms here.
[32:26.200 --> 32:30.840]  People are a little more used to standing up for themselves.
[32:30.840 --> 32:34.680]  The British common law actually got more implemented here than never got where it actually came
[32:34.680 --> 32:36.760]  from.
[32:36.760 --> 32:42.920]  And so we're losing hundreds and hundreds of years of ground that was gained for basic
[32:42.920 --> 32:43.920]  freedom.
[32:43.920 --> 32:48.800]  And we're letting dumbed down mercenary armies claiming they're anti-fascists when they work
[32:48.800 --> 32:55.280]  for a Nazi collaborator who worked for the fascist, cut his teeth, earned his bones, got
[32:55.280 --> 33:01.080]  his training on the job working for Hitler, Soros, and BLM working for Soros that's literally
[33:01.080 --> 33:06.400]  a satanic coven of witches that are also Marxist-Leninists and they say it on TV that they worship
[33:06.400 --> 33:09.680]  the devil.
[33:09.680 --> 33:13.520]  These are thugs but it's all unified together.
[33:13.520 --> 33:15.000]  It's all tied together.
[33:15.000 --> 33:16.840]  It's all a worldwide plan.
[33:16.840 --> 33:18.160]  It's all been standardized.
[33:18.160 --> 33:20.960]  It's all been tested and the globalists admit it.
[33:20.960 --> 33:21.960]  The people are getting pissed.
[33:21.960 --> 33:27.680]  Here's a clip from Portland last night where, again, they set up a checkpoint and are threatening
[33:27.680 --> 33:31.740]  people and a black guy gets out of his car to the white kids that say they're with black
[33:31.740 --> 33:32.740]  class matters.
[33:32.740 --> 33:33.740]  He says, are you crazy?
[33:33.740 --> 33:34.740]  You don't know who lives around here.
[33:34.740 --> 33:35.740]  You don't know who we are.
[33:35.740 --> 33:40.520]  And his point is basic but totally true.
[33:40.520 --> 33:43.640]  When you go after somebody, it's because if somebody wrongfully kills your brother or
[33:43.640 --> 33:47.280]  your sister or your son or daughter and then the court's over the right thing, yeah, maybe
[33:47.280 --> 33:50.480]  you go after them, whether they're black or white, it doesn't matter.
[33:50.480 --> 33:51.480]  It's about they did something.
[33:51.480 --> 33:54.880]  But the idea of randomly going to houses and screaming, we're going to burn your house
[33:54.880 --> 33:58.680]  down or we're going to kill you or go into restaurants and breaking stuff and yelling
[33:58.680 --> 34:06.320]  at people is pure evil, but it's designed to get a riot going.
[34:06.320 --> 34:12.200]  It's designed for somebody to pull a gun out of his white and shoot some black people.
[34:12.200 --> 34:17.320]  That's all this is, but more and more black Americans are seeing through it and they realize
[34:17.320 --> 34:21.480]  the taxpayer money we pay for universities is what's producing this.
[34:21.480 --> 34:27.680]  These are tentacles of metastasized authoritarian cancer streaming out from the universities,
[34:27.680 --> 34:31.320]  streaming out from the blue cities and blue states into the rest of America, demanding
[34:31.320 --> 34:35.320]  that we salute them and raise our fist and say, black lives matter, but that doesn't
[34:35.320 --> 34:36.320]  mean black lives matter.
[34:36.320 --> 34:38.960]  It means you have taken the orders from them.
[34:38.960 --> 34:41.080]  You have now kneeled to them.
[34:41.080 --> 34:42.640]  You now bow to them.
[34:42.640 --> 34:43.720]  The people are standing up.
[34:43.720 --> 34:44.720]  Yeah, I got something to say.
[34:44.720 --> 34:45.720]  I got something to say.
[34:45.720 --> 34:46.720]  Yeah.
[34:46.720 --> 34:47.720]  What are you representing?
[34:47.720 --> 34:48.720]  What are you?
[34:48.720 --> 34:49.720]  You don't represent this country.
[34:49.720 --> 35:06.720]  Because you want them right here, you don't know who house that was, who house that was.
[35:06.720 --> 35:12.880]  You don't know because you ain't from here, who house that was, who house this is on the
[35:12.880 --> 35:13.880]  corner right here.
[35:13.880 --> 35:19.680]  You don't know because you ain't from here, mother, but you come here.
[35:19.680 --> 35:26.000]  And you got a mother little situation for us how we supposed to be because you ain't
[35:26.000 --> 35:27.000]  from here.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.880]  You got a little situation for us.
[35:29.880 --> 35:35.720]  You got some, you got a situation for us how you want us to be, huh?
[35:35.720 --> 35:37.720]  You ain't from this bit.
[35:37.720 --> 35:45.600]  You ain't from this mother, you don't know what we're going to do, mother, you, you,
[35:45.600 --> 35:57.560]  you, you, you, you, you, you.
[35:57.560 --> 36:02.200]  That ought to be the refrain.
[36:02.200 --> 36:06.200]  Every time you see aunt, if you're a BLM in your neighborhood, you ain't from here,
[36:06.200 --> 36:07.200]  bitch.
[36:07.200 --> 36:11.700]  They have no idea who they're messing with who randomly walked up the houses, shining
[36:11.700 --> 36:12.700]  lights.
[36:12.700 --> 36:18.300]  burn your house down. Soros and the globalists are giving these idiot's orders because they know
[36:18.300 --> 36:23.580]  they're going to start getting people killed. Those people are scared. And why the hell would I
[36:23.580 --> 36:26.860]  just be driving on the road? Oh, there's a neighborhood. Let me just randomly pull up there
[36:26.860 --> 36:31.260]  and start threatening to burn people's houses down. Let me look, I'm not a scared guy, but let
[36:31.260 --> 36:35.660]  me tell you, I'd be scared randomly walking out in front of cars and just screaming at people and
[36:35.660 --> 36:41.820]  stopping them. Listen, I go scream at people that did something to me. Like when they closed all
[36:41.820 --> 36:46.620]  the parks in Austin, and my wife and kids couldn't go down to them. And I went there in front of a
[36:46.620 --> 36:54.540]  giant, huge 98,000 acre park. And they got glass windows set up saying there's COVID in here,
[36:54.540 --> 36:59.660]  you can't go in here. I said, get the hell out of my park. You're not from around here. And the
[36:59.660 --> 37:06.060]  media is like, he's crazy. He's yelling at people for no reason. No, they did something to me.
[37:06.060 --> 37:12.300]  They did something to you. That's when you get pissed off. And you know who they did? They did it to
[37:12.300 --> 37:18.860]  all of us with this COVID giant scam, lockdown, garbage, and the killing of the economy and
[37:18.860 --> 37:22.460]  everything they've done. This is seeds, ladies and gentlemen. And it doesn't matter what country
[37:22.460 --> 37:27.820]  you're in, the UN and the financial tyranny and the big foundations and the big insurance companies
[37:27.820 --> 37:33.180]  that own everything through the fraud they've committed are coming in. And it's not enough.
[37:33.180 --> 37:38.700]  They got trillions of dollars that they stole through fractional reserve banking. Now they want
[37:38.700 --> 37:43.260]  our mobility. Now they want our houses. Now they want to take control of our families,
[37:43.260 --> 37:49.740]  and they want to turn us all against each other so they can control us. And it's outrageous evil.
[37:51.100 --> 37:55.580]  And let me tell you, I know a lot of leftists who now know that this is all a fraud,
[37:56.380 --> 37:59.580]  but they went and got two or three degrees and they believe they're going to have a position
[37:59.580 --> 38:03.740]  in this takeover. And so they know they're spewing race division for control. They know
[38:03.740 --> 38:11.900]  they're under UN control. They know it. And that's what's frightening. Now I would say 70% of liberals
[38:12.620 --> 38:18.140]  actually know this is all a fraud, know the mask is a scam, know the lockdown is a scam,
[38:18.140 --> 38:24.700]  but they want it in place as a form of power and as a form of economic and cultural siege where
[38:24.700 --> 38:28.860]  people can't get regular medical treatment. They're committing suicide at record levels.
[38:28.860 --> 38:32.300]  And then now the winter's coming. They're going to have death from flu and cold, and they're going
[38:32.300 --> 38:37.660]  to try to lock it all down again. And they're never going to stop until we get on our knees to them.
[38:38.220 --> 38:42.700]  Okay, left. What do you want? Who runs you? Okay, Soros, Rothschilds, Rockefellers.
[38:42.700 --> 38:46.700]  What's their admitted game plan? Global depopulation, because they're so rich,
[38:46.700 --> 38:50.860]  they don't like seeing billions of us. And so they want to kill us for their power trip.
[38:51.500 --> 38:55.580]  So I can't even I can't even get on my knees and just let you run things. That's not enough.
[38:55.580 --> 39:01.340]  You want to kill me. And then you're not even part of the power structure of the average
[39:01.340 --> 39:04.940]  white liberal that's got two or three degrees and wants to run stuff. You're not going to run
[39:04.940 --> 39:11.580]  anything dumbass in this new system. Everywhere you live is poor and dumb down and as feces and
[39:11.580 --> 39:16.460]  needles everywhere, because you're all a bunch of incompetent criminals that rebelled against God
[39:16.460 --> 39:22.860]  and your family and biology and everything good and everything decent. And it's disgusting.
[39:22.860 --> 39:28.780]  And the worst you commit to Satan, like a degenerate gambler who's already sold everything they got
[39:28.780 --> 39:34.460]  betting that last bit of college money and your last bit of savings on the craps table,
[39:34.460 --> 39:39.260]  you'll never stop betting on the devil because you're of your father's Satan because you're
[39:39.260 --> 39:44.620]  losers. So we should stop trying to convince these devil worshipers to stop and we should
[39:44.620 --> 39:56.700]  stop following their orders and stop submitting. You notice that over and over again, the United
[39:56.700 --> 40:01.260]  Nations are supposed controllers and bosses. The great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed
[40:01.260 --> 40:07.980]  to disagree with has come out and said nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19. Ladies and gentlemen,
[40:07.980 --> 40:13.580]  that's a total lie. You get a lot of sunlight. It's on record to produce a ton of vitamin D3
[40:13.580 --> 40:18.220]  and it's almost impossible to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3.
[40:18.220 --> 40:22.620]  If you have zinc and vitamin C as well, that's why people get the flus and these colds in the
[40:22.620 --> 40:27.580]  winter because that's when vitamin D levels plunge. Now I've pointed this out and the media has
[40:27.580 --> 40:32.540]  called me a scammer for saying that there's hope that people should have their vitamins and their
[40:32.540 --> 40:38.220]  minerals. Well now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin D3 and C. He
[40:38.220 --> 40:43.180]  should have also added zinc because the NIH website says you die without zinc. But it's
[40:43.180 --> 40:47.980]  good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality because so many doctors and nurses
[40:47.980 --> 40:51.900]  and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact that he's not been warning the public to get
[40:51.900 --> 40:58.300]  their vitamins. Servants of state are working around the clock to silence the people of not just
[40:58.300 --> 41:03.420]  the United States but of the world because there is a great awakening taking place. Everyone I talk
[41:03.420 --> 41:09.180]  to, everywhere I go, people that weren't even religious or spiritual now understand the fight
[41:09.180 --> 41:14.620]  between good and evil and they're finding Christ and they're finding the prophecies that aren't
[41:14.620 --> 41:21.580]  like Nostradamus they but are very very detailed and extremely specific that are now coming through
[41:21.580 --> 41:28.300]  at a frightening rate. Frightening because so many people are still living under the control of
[41:28.300 --> 41:36.380]  God of this world. Satan did not realize that their immortal souls are in grave danger. Do not fear
[41:36.380 --> 41:43.020]  he who can kill the body, fear he who can kill the soul as the good book warns us. I'm Alex Jones
[41:43.020 --> 41:47.660]  and I'm very honored to be on air still during this time. Every day we're still on air as a blessing.
[41:47.660 --> 41:51.660]  So please pray for him for worse, pray for yourself, pray for the children, and pray for the world.
[41:51.660 --> 42:00.300]  God bless you all. Remember the enemy is working around the clock to suppress voices of independent
[42:00.300 --> 42:07.420]  people all over the world. The globalist have a plan for total vertical integration.
[42:08.300 --> 42:16.460]  Absolute authoritarianism to where you are a captive of their devices, of their control,
[42:17.020 --> 42:23.420]  but that is only a means to an end. Once they have the electronic straight jacket in place
[42:23.420 --> 42:28.460]  they are on record that they will bring in force inoculations that sterilize you and your family
[42:28.460 --> 42:34.860]  and worse. Many of the vaccines being pushed by the United Nations actually give people polio
[42:34.860 --> 42:41.260]  and actually give people cancer. Most cancer is viral. That's a big secret, but the secret
[42:41.260 --> 42:47.580]  is beginning to come out. It's even in the associated press. Remember all of these banned
[42:47.580 --> 42:53.500]  videos and reports are banned on video, but only you can share them and save humanity.
[42:53.500 --> 43:00.060]  The planets have aligned globally. They've aligned nationally. They've aligned financially,
[43:00.060 --> 43:06.220]  culturally, but most importantly spiritually. We are living at a point in human development
[43:06.220 --> 43:12.220]  that will decide the entire future destiny of our species. So that's why big tech control
[43:12.220 --> 43:18.060]  by the very dark forces of the globalist is trying to dumb us down, isolate us, make us
[43:18.060 --> 43:23.900]  depressed, make us alone, and traffic control every aspect of our lives, literally brainwashing
[43:23.900 --> 43:28.620]  us with the stimuli that they look forward because they do not want us to take our birthright,
[43:28.620 --> 43:33.900]  not just of Americana, but of true Christendom and the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.
[43:34.620 --> 43:38.860]  They are trying to create the new dark age where they have all the high technology and
[43:38.860 --> 43:45.020]  life extension and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us through carbon credits
[43:45.020 --> 43:50.620]  and through a social credit score. This is their plan. We must come together and awaken
[43:50.620 --> 44:16.620]  out of our trance and say no. We must embrace God.
[44:20.940 --> 44:32.780]  We just, who else there was? You don't know because you ain't from here. Who else there
[44:32.780 --> 44:39.020]  was? Who else this is on the corner right here? You don't know because you ain't from here,
[44:39.020 --> 44:46.060]  mother f***ers, but you come here and you got a mother f***ing little situation for us how we
[44:46.060 --> 44:53.260]  supposed to be because you ain't from here and you got a little situation for us. Think about
[44:53.260 --> 44:59.580]  that, how basic that is, but how true that is. You're not from here. The guy is in his neighborhood,
[44:59.580 --> 45:06.620]  he's got friends, he's probably lived there decades and there are people there in his face screaming
[45:06.620 --> 45:10.380]  and yelling at his neighbors and telling him they're bad because some of them are white people
[45:10.380 --> 45:17.260]  and trying to make them pledge allegiance to George Soros' color revolution. That's how weak
[45:18.220 --> 45:23.340]  George Soros and Obama and Hillary think you are and how weak the Communist Chinese think you are,
[45:23.900 --> 45:29.340]  but if more Americans were like this guy driving home from work or wherever he's been,
[45:29.340 --> 45:32.620]  maybe he went to have dinner, had a few drinks, doesn't matter, it's his neighborhood
[45:33.980 --> 45:37.500]  and they try to block his car and make him pledge allegiance to black people
[45:37.500 --> 45:42.140]  and he's like you're invading me, you're the one trying to enslave me.
[45:46.460 --> 45:52.780]  That's normal behavior. People need to start acting like that and having basic intelligence
[45:52.780 --> 45:59.260]  because you can have IQ, you can have cultural stuff, you can have different forms of intelligence,
[45:59.260 --> 46:07.420]  but if you don't have the basic psychology to stand up for yourself in your own territory
[46:07.420 --> 46:12.060]  and your own neighborhood against people in uniforms, in black uniforms.
[46:12.060 --> 46:41.660]  All right folks, I had intended to do the whole show today standing with this wireless mic,
[46:41.660 --> 46:47.420]  but I guess the battery doesn't last more than 30 minutes, so we will move back to the seated
[46:47.420 --> 46:51.980]  positioning here, but if you don't have the basic instinct to stand up for yourself,
[46:52.540 --> 46:57.500]  we don't have the basic instinct to stand up when your own territory is being invaded
[46:57.500 --> 47:05.580]  by people in uniforms who are there making you pledge allegiance to a master James Bond level
[47:05.580 --> 47:10.940]  criminal who is a total threat to humanity, well then there really is no hope for you,
[47:10.940 --> 47:15.900]  is there? So a little bit behind now because of the mic failure, I was going to go over all this
[47:15.900 --> 47:20.140]  news and information over here, but I can't even get to at this point. So when we start the next
[47:20.140 --> 47:25.420]  hour, I'm going to go through how all this ties together and also some really powerful news that's
[47:25.420 --> 47:33.580]  breaking at infowars.com right now. Full Epstein flight logs set for release, sparking panic among
[47:33.580 --> 47:42.380]  pedophile elites, global pedophile network now in full panic mode. That is a big, big story.
[47:42.380 --> 47:47.820]  US Virgin Islands is demanding the release of the full flight logs of Jeffrey Epstein and his
[47:47.820 --> 47:54.300]  passengers flying to and from his private island. Bill Clinton was seen there by dozens of credible
[47:54.300 --> 47:58.220]  witnesses, including those that work for Epstein. He was on the flight logs that are already public
[47:58.220 --> 48:04.540]  going there many times, but now a major government is demanding it be released. The US Virgin Islands
[48:04.540 --> 48:09.660]  is demanding the release of the full flight logs of Jeffrey Epstein and his passengers flying to
[48:09.660 --> 48:14.460]  and from his private island. And this isn't an unrealistic request of the Virgin Islands
[48:14.460 --> 48:19.260]  Attorney General because the flight logs were already partially released and Epstein likely
[48:19.260 --> 48:24.300]  had an ulterior motive to ensure his companions were listed on the logs called Blackmail.
[48:24.300 --> 48:33.340]  So that is a big, big deal that is going to be coming up in the next hour. And some of the other
[48:33.340 --> 48:43.020]  stuff I'll be covering, some of the other stuff I'm going to be covering. Just look at these headlines
[48:43.020 --> 48:50.140]  right here. China's Air Force post clip of simulated attack on US airbase and then this
[48:50.140 --> 49:01.100]  all coordinated, all UN, all globalist run. CDC adds breathing to ways coronavirus spreads.
[49:01.100 --> 49:06.700]  So I did a joke video yesterday downtown saying we need to stop people breathing that everybody
[49:06.700 --> 49:11.180]  needs to die to stop coronavirus. Little did I know hours later they would make the joke a
[49:11.180 --> 49:14.940]  reality. We haven't even released the video. We shot it yesterday. I got busy and released it.
[49:14.940 --> 49:20.540]  Greg Reese is in there. Put it together right now. Report COVID whistleblowers are making money
[49:20.540 --> 49:24.700]  from paddling on those who break the rules all over the world. UN directive. Australia's
[49:24.700 --> 49:29.260]  coronavirus lockdown strategy work. Could this be the model for the US? That's CNN today. Told you
[49:29.260 --> 49:36.460]  that was coming. CNN. Australia is the model. Monkey see monkey do. So is China. And now it's
[49:36.460 --> 49:46.300]  all coming here. UK unveils harsh $13,000 fines for breaking quarantine. Anti-mass mayhem.
[49:46.300 --> 49:51.100]  Trafalgar square arresting conspiracy theorists that are there demanding the lockdown end. Oh,
[49:51.100 --> 49:54.220]  if you just want something to end your conspiracy theorists means that you have no value.
[49:54.860 --> 49:59.260]  They're not going to arrest conspiracy theorists in Australia with a new law or trying to pass.
[49:59.260 --> 50:02.860]  The government says they've got the votes. If you criticize it, you'll be arrested.
[50:02.860 --> 50:09.180]  It's just like that. You're beyond 1984. Australia coronavirus lockdown strategy work. Could
[50:09.180 --> 50:15.260]  this be the model for the US MSNBC? See same headlines everywhere. What lockdown two looks
[50:15.260 --> 50:21.420]  like harsher rules, deeper confusion. New York Times see. Oh, it's supposed to last 15 days.
[50:21.420 --> 50:24.700]  Now eight months in, it's going to be harsher and never going to end.
[50:24.700 --> 50:32.220]  Nigel Farage who got Boris Johnson into office now says he's an enemy of the people.
[50:33.660 --> 50:39.180]  Farage says no to second national lockdown reject Boris Johnson's elective dictatorship.
[50:40.940 --> 50:46.780]  Video Biden again says millions of Americans have died 200 million total lies. But again,
[50:46.780 --> 50:50.300]  don't try to say that on Facebook. They'll stop you because Biden is the truth. The
[50:50.300 --> 50:55.660]  article. Denial and defiance. Trump and his base downplay the virus ahead of election.
[50:55.660 --> 50:58.860]  Oh, thank God for Trump. That's the New York Times attacking him. But meanwhile,
[50:58.860 --> 51:02.380]  capitalism isn't working anymore. Here's how the pandemic could change forever.
[51:02.380 --> 51:09.020]  A universal income controlled by the UN. Oh, of course. And the global debt is exploding as
[51:09.020 --> 51:13.500]  generations of wealth are destroyed during the lockdown because of Corona. No, because of the
[51:13.500 --> 51:22.540]  UN lockdown, which they call the great reset. It's all coming up. Van Morrison said to release
[51:22.540 --> 51:27.980]  three anti-coronavirus lockdown protest songs. That's the answer. Fight back against the lie now
[51:27.980 --> 51:32.220]  because it's always, oh, just 15 days. Oh, just two months, just six months, just a year,
[51:32.220 --> 51:36.380]  just a year and a half, just two years, just forever. Just like the criminal when they put
[51:36.380 --> 51:40.860]  a gun to you to a woman, they say, get in the van or I'm going to shoot you. I'm scared. Listen,
[51:40.860 --> 51:44.860]  I won't hurt you. Just put the handcuffs on. He gets you in the back, handcuffs you,
[51:44.860 --> 51:49.580]  puts a gag on you and says, you dumb bitch, I'm going to torture you to death. That's what they
[51:49.580 --> 51:54.860]  do on record. And he takes you to down to that dungeon. He tortures you for a good three months,
[51:55.500 --> 51:59.820]  rips all your teeth out. And then finally, when you just give up and he's used you up,
[51:59.820 --> 52:06.540]  he blows your head off. And that's what Governor Newsom is going to do to you. And Kim Jong-un
[52:06.540 --> 52:13.100]  and Gigi Ping and Bill Clinton, because they're all way worse than any psycho you ever heard of
[52:13.100 --> 52:18.700]  because they're high functioning. And the whole world is a place for them to get away with this
[52:18.700 --> 52:22.780]  and do this type of stuff. So that's all coming up and how it all ties together.
[52:25.020 --> 52:31.180]  That's how the globalist operate. And I'm just here to show you who they are and what they're
[52:31.180 --> 52:37.500]  doing. And I'm sorry it's all true, but it is separately. If we could pull up this URL for
[52:37.500 --> 52:44.460]  TV viewers, preparewithalex.com is my Patriot supply that took their already lowest prices food.
[52:45.020 --> 52:52.380]  And they have lowered the price massively more than 10% on three different bestselling items,
[52:52.380 --> 52:57.660]  horrible food, water filtration and more. You go to preparewithalex.com. We can show that URL.
[52:57.660 --> 53:03.820]  That would be absolutely awesome. And maybe go to the website. Preparewithalex.com, ladies and
[53:03.820 --> 53:11.500]  gentlemen. And you can see there that there's only 15 hours, two minutes and 57 seconds left on that
[53:11.500 --> 53:15.340]  sale. And you know I am. I asked them to extend it. They cannot extend that particular sale,
[53:15.340 --> 53:19.340]  but we'll see what happens. Now is the time to get your swarable food. Now is the time to get
[53:19.340 --> 53:24.460]  prepared. Preparewithalex.com. You go to infowarstore.com, you get the very same deals, their whole
[53:24.460 --> 53:28.380]  side. It's just their side on our side. They're in our back end. It's my Patriot. The best folks,
[53:28.380 --> 53:32.460]  best prices, lowest prices. That supports us here. So thanks for the support. Get you things you need
[53:32.460 --> 53:37.260]  to be self-sufficient under globalist control. But with this special they did for us, you get an
[53:37.260 --> 53:43.740]  additional $170 off one deal, $100 off another. I think it's $140 off the other deal. These are
[53:43.740 --> 53:47.900]  big specials because they don't have a lot of margin already in there. I mean, they're the
[53:47.900 --> 53:52.460]  biggest seller of food out there now for trouble food. Just the margins are not very large. We
[53:52.460 --> 53:56.300]  sold a lot of food to fund ourselves, which is fine because people need high quality,
[53:56.300 --> 54:01.500]  swarable food that need to be prepared. And separately, APEC PowerStack has everything you
[54:01.500 --> 54:06.220]  need to supercharge your immune system, your libido, your energy, your stamina. The problem is
[54:07.180 --> 54:11.580]  is that we try to reorder it and now they've sold out. They can't get some of the proprietary
[54:11.580 --> 54:16.940]  ingredients because of the COVID lockdown, because of the breakdown. We are discontinuing APEC PowerStack.
[54:16.940 --> 54:22.620]  We have a limited supply. It is 60% off with free shipping. That's very close to cost. It's an
[54:22.620 --> 54:27.980]  amazing product. You don't forget to take it. You've got the AM and the PM packets, take it in the
[54:27.980 --> 54:32.300]  morning, put it in your jacket, take it after work or before you go to bed. It's really amazing.
[54:32.300 --> 54:36.460]  Changed a lot of lives. And you know what changes the world? Because it funds the info war.
[54:36.460 --> 54:41.340]  Hour number two straight ahead. I'm in war mode. 42 days out.
[54:41.340 --> 54:49.580]  Real power comes from the grassroots. And real power comes from experience. And I've been in
[54:49.580 --> 54:53.740]  the fight more than 26 years against the globalist. So it's important for listeners and viewers to
[54:53.740 --> 54:58.060]  understand. When you support info wars that keep us on the air, you're not supporting a news outlet
[54:58.060 --> 55:04.060]  that has sources. And so we're able to always tell you what's coming when others can't. It's because
[55:04.060 --> 55:09.580]  we are studying the enemy and doing the original analysis that gets picked up by Trump intelligence
[55:09.580 --> 55:13.900]  agencies and major corporations that are part of the resistance that are part of the resistance
[55:13.900 --> 55:19.020]  to the overarching globalist system. So I have to tell you how the hierarchy works. In many cases,
[55:19.020 --> 55:24.700]  info wars is at the head. We're not the tail. That means you're at the head. And that's why
[55:24.700 --> 55:29.180]  your support of us is so critical. Biden and his constellation of criminals have told us
[55:29.180 --> 55:33.020]  and many others that if they get elected, they're not just going to shut down info wars. They're
[55:33.020 --> 55:37.500]  going to shut you down. The long depression forced inoculations and more. So now more than ever,
[55:37.500 --> 55:41.260]  keep info wars on the air with high quality products at infowarstore.com.
[55:44.460 --> 55:50.140]  Last week, Tucker Carlson came out and said America is becoming the Soviet Union. In many ways,
[55:50.140 --> 55:54.540]  we're worse than the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union couldn't dream of what big tech can do,
[55:54.540 --> 55:59.500]  surveilling and censoring us. And we're going to get a lot worse than the Soviet Union when it comes
[55:59.500 --> 56:04.540]  to forced inoculations and the medical tyranny being rolled out by the United Nations now in
[56:04.540 --> 56:09.900]  control of what you can and can't say online. The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, America is fighting
[56:09.900 --> 56:15.900]  for its life. And the enemy's number one mission is to get Trump out of office. And number two is
[56:15.900 --> 56:21.500]  to silence info wars because we understand just how diabolical they are, just how evil they are.
[56:21.500 --> 56:26.380]  And we want men's words. We know who the global star we've got their number and we know how to
[56:26.380 --> 56:32.460]  beat them. And we cover it seven days a week live at info wars. And it's only because of your support.
[56:32.460 --> 56:36.220]  So keep spreading the word, keep praying for us and take advantage of the sales and get great
[56:36.220 --> 56:41.500]  products at infowarstore.com now. The globalists are hoping you don't visit infowarstore.com.
[56:41.500 --> 57:09.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show big brother mainstream media government cover
[57:09.740 --> 57:18.780]  us. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[57:18.780 --> 57:40.700]  You said you would come a conquer a man who would someday be king by his own hand.
[57:40.700 --> 58:01.100]  The founders of black lives matter and all them are actually into an anti African cult that
[58:01.100 --> 58:06.620]  feeds off the energy of black people. It's just a fact that saw a linsky dedicated on his book
[58:06.620 --> 58:14.140]  rules for radicals to Lucifer people celebrating Satan in the way that many of us Christians
[58:14.140 --> 58:21.260]  celebrate God. And so, you know, it's about black people, their suffering and their agenda being
[58:21.260 --> 58:28.460]  used to further a cause as much bigger. And it is the Marxist socialism, the cultural Marxism
[58:29.180 --> 58:34.860]  that they are making promises to blacks and other groups that are disenfranchised of poor.
[58:34.860 --> 58:42.940]  But it takes us back to the same pale Marxist socialist goals. We actually do have an ideological
[58:42.940 --> 58:51.820]  frame myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers. We are trained Marxists.
[58:51.820 --> 58:56.700]  Patrice colors the one you just heard there saying that she's a trained Marxist and that she and
[58:56.700 --> 59:02.300]  other BLM co founders are trained Marxist. He said, quote, I'm calling for spirituality to be deeply
[59:02.300 --> 59:09.420]  radical. We're not just having a social justice movement. This is a spiritual movement. Maybe
[59:09.420 --> 59:16.220]  I'm sharing too much, but we become very intimate with the spirits that we call on regularly, right?
[59:16.220 --> 59:23.420]  Like each of them seems to have a different presence and personality. You know, I laugh a lot
[59:23.420 --> 59:31.260]  with why he should, you know, and I didn't meet her in her body, right? I'm her through this work.
[59:31.260 --> 59:38.620]  Dr. Abdullah and Patrice colors talks about summoning the spirits of the dead using the power
[59:39.180 --> 59:45.180]  of the spirit of the dead in order to give them the ability to do what they're calling the so
[59:45.180 --> 59:53.740]  called justice work. You're going to find that what they're describing is their adherence to the
[59:53.740 --> 1:00:04.300]  Yoruba religion of ifa or ifa. I started to feel personally connected and responsible and accountable
[1:00:04.300 --> 1:00:12.380]  to them both from a deeply political place, but also from a deeply spiritual place. Now,
[1:00:12.380 --> 1:00:17.740]  in case you're wondering who that is speaking, that is Patrice Colors, co-founder of the Black
[1:00:17.740 --> 1:00:22.620]  Lives Matter organization, the same one you just heard saying, we are trained, Marxists.
[1:00:22.620 --> 1:00:28.220]  Say their names. We do that all the time that you kind of invoke that spirit and then those
[1:00:28.220 --> 1:00:34.780]  spirits actually become present with you. Now y'all see all of this, the NBA, all on the Jersey,
[1:00:34.780 --> 1:00:40.700]  say her name. They're not doing what you think they're doing. You think they're just honoring
[1:00:40.700 --> 1:00:47.340]  people. They are conjuring up spirits. So when we say it's a spiritual battle, it is. These women,
[1:00:47.340 --> 1:00:51.900]  these Marxist who tell you, we don't want men to have testicles. We don't want to have a Black
[1:00:51.900 --> 1:00:59.260]  family. How could you say you're a bigger enemy of humans or Black people to say we are here to
[1:00:59.260 --> 1:01:07.260]  destroy the family? That is their maxim. 80% of abortion clinics in America are in minority
[1:01:07.260 --> 1:01:19.660]  neighborhoods. Over 22,500,000 Black babies have been aborted in 50 years. Over 22,500,000 Black
[1:01:19.660 --> 1:01:28.540]  babies have been aborted in 50 years. You cannot say Black Lives Matter and then kill yourself.
[1:01:31.740 --> 1:01:36.220]  And you look at the spell they've got over people that have taken on this, just murder the police,
[1:01:36.220 --> 1:01:41.020]  murder innocent people, shoot people at checkpoints, burn things down, go into restaurants and attack
[1:01:41.020 --> 1:01:45.340]  people because of what color they are. And these women conducting their little white magic rituals
[1:01:45.340 --> 1:01:50.140]  out in the open like Vina Moronovich does, but then the Black magic is done internally. I mean,
[1:01:50.140 --> 1:01:57.420]  these are just arrogant, slob-like. It is now confirmed every organization affiliated with
[1:01:57.420 --> 1:02:03.980]  President Trump and his campaign is being attacked out of Communist China in the biggest coordinated
[1:02:03.980 --> 1:02:09.260]  cyber attacks the planet has ever seen. Joe Biden has openly said China should run every
[1:02:09.260 --> 1:02:14.940]  facet of our lives. The Speaker of the House Pelosi has said that China wants Joe Biden.
[1:02:15.580 --> 1:02:23.900]  Infowars is under dozens of different types of cyber attack a day. Infowars.com, newswars.com,
[1:02:23.900 --> 1:02:31.100]  prisonplanet.com, infowarstore.com, and they're not even hiding that it's coming directly
[1:02:31.100 --> 1:02:38.060]  out of Communist China. America is fighting for its life. Everyone that votes for Joe Biden is a
[1:02:38.060 --> 1:02:43.900]  stooge of Communist China and an idiot trying to destroy not just their future, but our future.
[1:02:44.460 --> 1:02:49.740]  But no matter what happens to this election, the awakening and the chain reaction has begun
[1:02:49.740 --> 1:03:02.860]  and cannot be reversed.
[1:03:20.220 --> 1:03:28.940]  It's September 21st on this Monday edition, 42 days on from the historic election.
[1:03:28.940 --> 1:03:32.860]  I'm your host Alex Jones. We're into hour number two.
[1:03:39.740 --> 1:03:43.580]  Now, just yesterday, we were downtown with a drone flying around showing who's wearing
[1:03:43.580 --> 1:03:47.980]  mask who isn't to show how ridiculous it all is. We're going to have that video coming out soon.
[1:03:47.980 --> 1:03:56.700]  And I see painted on the railroad trestle a sign saying breathe, which is really a good thing.
[1:03:56.700 --> 1:04:01.580]  Actually, Ted Nugent's wife was on a few months ago with Ted and she said, Alex, just breathe.
[1:04:01.580 --> 1:04:06.300]  So my wife tells me it's what everybody tells me. I need to breathe. It's true.
[1:04:06.860 --> 1:04:10.540]  Still take action. Sometimes I forget to breathe for like a minute when I'm on air. I'm talking so
[1:04:10.540 --> 1:04:16.220]  fast. I'm so excited because this is an exciting time to be alive. But now this new article is
[1:04:16.220 --> 1:04:23.340]  at news wars.com and info wars.com because I saw that World Street Journal article a few
[1:04:23.340 --> 1:04:27.900]  months ago saying looking forward to the end of humanity were to fallen creatures that can't
[1:04:27.900 --> 1:04:32.700]  handle viruses and were dirty and were bad for the earth. Humanity all needs to be phased out
[1:04:32.700 --> 1:04:38.220]  and new silicon creatures take over. We've heard that before from the UN and from Bill Gates and
[1:04:38.220 --> 1:04:43.900]  from Ted Turner and all of them. There it is on screen for TV viewers. So they're externalizing
[1:04:43.900 --> 1:04:49.340]  their religion. They want to make it dystopic for us and make us all fight with each other
[1:04:49.340 --> 1:04:55.020]  and break down civilization so we give up and just kill each other and then let them inherit
[1:04:55.020 --> 1:04:59.900]  the future. That's all this is, is a culling operation and getting us to turn off our life force.
[1:05:00.940 --> 1:05:05.100]  And the very people that are doing this have already turned theirs off and are trying to project
[1:05:05.100 --> 1:05:09.580]  their hatred of themselves onto us. So I've made the joke video. We'll play in a moment,
[1:05:09.580 --> 1:05:14.540]  but it really wasn't a joke saying what's next telling people not to breathe because the only
[1:05:14.540 --> 1:05:19.100]  way you save people from COVID because again, it doesn't matter if millions commit suicide from
[1:05:19.100 --> 1:05:24.780]  COVID or millions die because they starved to death because of the COVID lockdown or millions
[1:05:24.780 --> 1:05:29.020]  don't get medical care because of COVID and die, which they admit it's killing hundreds of times
[1:05:29.020 --> 1:05:35.100]  what COVID is, even if you believe in COVID. Then why not just get rid of humanity altogether
[1:05:35.100 --> 1:05:41.820]  like the Wall Street Journal said. And little did I know the CDC hours later, early this morning,
[1:05:41.820 --> 1:05:48.300]  the next day, Monday, says breathing is the problem and that breathing spreads it. Well,
[1:05:48.860 --> 1:05:53.020]  I mean, if we're going to kill millions to save one person, then we must kill the entire seven
[1:05:53.020 --> 1:05:58.620]  and a half billion population of the earth to save us from COVID. Only that will stop the spread.
[1:05:58.620 --> 1:06:05.500]  Only that will cut the curve. Only that will cross the curve. And I nominate Bill Gates, Ted
[1:06:05.500 --> 1:06:11.180]  Turner, Warren Buffett, David Rockefeller. Oh, he's already dead. All the group that are part
[1:06:11.180 --> 1:06:15.180]  of the eugenics depopulation club that the Wall Street Journal reported on lovingly.
[1:06:16.380 --> 1:06:23.580]  I nominate Oprah Winfrey. I nominate Zabina Brzezinski. Oh, sorry. He's in hell too.
[1:06:23.580 --> 1:06:29.100]  I nominate Ruth Bader Ginsburg to go first. Oh, sorry. But seriously, you guys go first. Oh,
[1:06:29.100 --> 1:06:33.580]  but you're the guardians of the evolution. You're the guardians. And then you do everything you
[1:06:33.580 --> 1:06:39.260]  can to dumb us down, poison us, make us stupid so you can sit there and play God. You're disgusting
[1:06:39.260 --> 1:06:46.780]  filth. Hey, Bill Gates senior, you go first. Oh, sorry. You just died too. All that life extension
[1:06:46.780 --> 1:06:56.060]  isn't working too well for you, Tom Brokaw, is it? So CDC adds breathing to ways coronavirus
[1:06:56.860 --> 1:07:02.140]  spreads. I made the joke and now it's the reality. Kill yourself to save life, folks.
[1:07:02.140 --> 1:07:10.620]  That's the new logic here at us. The Wall Street Journal is looking forward to the end of humanity
[1:07:10.620 --> 1:07:17.740]  and suggests that Silicon Valley moguls can save humanity by merging us with machines.
[1:07:18.940 --> 1:07:27.420]  And the CDC warns that COVID spreads by singing, talking and breathing. But how would one avoid
[1:07:27.420 --> 1:07:34.780]  breathing? Perhaps these elite moguls just want us all to die. Ladies and gentlemen, we're in
[1:07:34.780 --> 1:07:39.820]  downtown Austin. We just found a very serious microaggression, you know, in forms in Europe
[1:07:39.820 --> 1:07:43.420]  and the United States and Canada. They say when you're enrolling your child, don't say
[1:07:43.420 --> 1:07:47.180]  male or female because other people might not be male or female and the existence of male or
[1:07:47.180 --> 1:07:56.940]  female is hurtful. Okay. Well, this says breathe. Well, not everybody can breathe. And so we should
[1:07:57.500 --> 1:08:00.380]  not allow people to say please breathe because that's discriminatory. It's those that aren't
[1:08:00.380 --> 1:08:06.140]  breathing. We know them as the dead. But some people identify as not breathing. I am offended and I
[1:08:06.140 --> 1:08:10.940]  called the city of Austin to remove that. That makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? No, actually,
[1:08:10.940 --> 1:08:14.460]  that's the globalist operation, waits for war on language, waits for war on communication,
[1:08:15.020 --> 1:08:19.340]  and turning universities on into engines of enlightenment, but engines of mental illness
[1:08:19.340 --> 1:08:24.380]  to sabotage our country. Everything the left promotes in America is illegal in communist China.
[1:08:24.380 --> 1:08:28.700]  The communist China finances all of this cultural revolution here to destroy us. So
[1:08:29.580 --> 1:08:33.500]  please breathe. Remember, wearing the mask is a symbol of being a slave, wearing the mask is
[1:08:33.500 --> 1:08:38.940]  a symbol of being under the globalist manipulation and under their control. And it's the symbol of
[1:08:38.940 --> 1:08:46.460]  being a captured prisoner. He is muzzled like an animal, just like women under Islam wearing burqas
[1:08:47.340 --> 1:08:52.460]  over their heads. It has nothing to do with protecting you, nothing to do with your safety.
[1:08:52.460 --> 1:08:56.300]  It has everything to do with you accepting the forced inoculations they now admit are coming
[1:08:56.300 --> 1:09:03.500]  and the UN run contact tracers. This is the world government AI social credit store rollout. The
[1:09:03.500 --> 1:09:10.220]  good news is humanity is awake to it and fighting back. So last night I did a video, you just saw
[1:09:10.220 --> 1:09:17.020]  a premiere here where breathing is bad and it all ties together. I want to take your phone
[1:09:17.020 --> 1:09:21.980]  calls for the rest of the hour before Ali Alexander joins us on studio on Ruth Bader Ginsburg
[1:09:21.980 --> 1:09:26.780]  on the fact that Atlanta and Houston and all over the country, they're coming door to door
[1:09:26.780 --> 1:09:31.980]  demanding blood samples. They say, well, we do pressure you, but there's no law. And they say,
[1:09:31.980 --> 1:09:36.220]  but we're going to be like Australia soon. We're going to start doing lockdowns. We came and leave
[1:09:36.220 --> 1:09:42.060]  your house. That's the New York Times. And again, we told you this because it's a standardized plan.
[1:09:42.060 --> 1:09:46.540]  Black Lives Matter is worldwide. Antifa is worldwide. The COVID lockdown is worldwide.
[1:09:46.540 --> 1:09:53.660]  It's all recognized by the UN. And it's all their plan and their control and their pretext.
[1:09:54.780 --> 1:09:57.500]  I shot a video on Saturday after I did a special two hour show
[1:09:59.740 --> 1:10:04.300]  about how DARPA admits that they're developing an implantable microchip that dissolves into
[1:10:04.300 --> 1:10:08.780]  your bloodstream. So you can't ever get it out of you to prove you've had COVID-19 vaccines or
[1:10:08.780 --> 1:10:15.340]  to test for COVID-19. And my wife's like, is that really true? So I showed her the MIT link. It was
[1:10:15.340 --> 1:10:22.380]  even on drugsreport.com. And she tweeted it and people couldn't believe it. And they also couldn't
[1:10:22.380 --> 1:10:26.060]  believe that they're coming door to door for your blood. So everybody started posting under it. Oh,
[1:10:26.060 --> 1:10:34.300]  my LA's doing it. Houston's doing it. Atlanta's doing it. Yeah, folks. It's going down, okay?
[1:10:35.260 --> 1:10:39.500]  And again, they did all the test parameters where almost everybody is going to be positive
[1:10:39.500 --> 1:10:44.300]  and see it's never going to end. That's why it's synthetic. So they can spread it and mark you
[1:10:44.300 --> 1:10:50.140]  and then control you and then disappear you when they want. And I told you next would be permanent
[1:10:50.140 --> 1:10:54.940]  lockdowns and then would be if you disagree with COVID-19 and say they're using it for a power grab,
[1:10:54.940 --> 1:11:00.620]  you disappear. And now Australia is set to pass a law to arrest you if you criticize it because
[1:11:00.620 --> 1:11:09.180]  only who, who, the WHO, only the World Health Organization gets to have speech, even though
[1:11:09.180 --> 1:11:13.180]  they've been caught lying about everything. They get to silence doctors. They get to silence
[1:11:13.180 --> 1:11:17.820]  scientists. They had a French news agency as big as AP Worldwide come out and say,
[1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:23.900]  is Jones right about them paying $52,000 for every person that's in a hospital with COVID?
[1:11:24.940 --> 1:11:28.860]  They said, we don't know, even though it's confirmed. And they go and Jones claims they want
[1:11:28.860 --> 1:11:32.620]  to shut the world economy off using COVID. I show you the Davos documents, but they said,
[1:11:32.620 --> 1:11:39.420]  oh, it's not true. And then they just went on to deny all the things that are actually happening,
[1:11:39.420 --> 1:11:49.100]  ladies and gentlemen, totally and completely disgusting. They get $52,000 for every person
[1:11:49.100 --> 1:11:55.020]  they say have COVID if they put a tube down their throat and kill them. And that's a bounty on you
[1:11:55.020 --> 1:11:59.740]  to corrupt everybody and to get away with it. And what you see in Australia is coming to you
[1:11:59.740 --> 1:12:02.940]  and you don't have to wait. And they don't care what Trump says. They don't care what the military
[1:12:02.940 --> 1:12:07.020]  says. They don't care what Congress says. They, they've got the cities and counties bought off.
[1:12:07.020 --> 1:12:12.780]  And that was always the UN plan was to get control of them and they get control of the law enforcement
[1:12:12.780 --> 1:12:16.460]  and the district attorneys. And they've got the district attorneys in every major city,
[1:12:16.460 --> 1:12:22.540]  every major city is either a leftist or a Soros person. And even the leftists are getting scared.
[1:12:22.540 --> 1:12:25.980]  I talked to one of the high level leftists, one of the top Democrats in Austin, he said,
[1:12:25.980 --> 1:12:32.620]  you were right about all this Soros is taking Austin over. Can we meet with you to find out
[1:12:32.620 --> 1:12:36.460]  how to stop them? And that's the separation of powers the founders talked about. As soon as
[1:12:36.460 --> 1:12:40.700]  the Democrats finally figure out their chai con idiots that they've been duped and that they're
[1:12:40.700 --> 1:12:44.620]  going to be thrown out, they might actually join Republicans and stop this. But there's not much
[1:12:44.620 --> 1:12:50.220]  more time. That's how serious this is. America is under foreign attack. We're fighting for our
[1:12:50.220 --> 1:12:56.300]  lives for God's sakes. It was in the telecommunications act of 1996 that all new cell phones would
[1:12:56.300 --> 1:13:02.860]  track your GPS location. I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that
[1:13:02.860 --> 1:13:09.260]  was un-American. Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and
[1:13:09.260 --> 1:13:15.420]  Androids, don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to,
[1:13:15.420 --> 1:13:20.540]  your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps
[1:13:20.540 --> 1:13:26.940]  as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa
[1:13:26.940 --> 1:13:32.940]  do, and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved
[1:13:32.940 --> 1:13:37.900]  forever. Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based
[1:13:37.900 --> 1:13:43.180]  on information. This is the global Chinese communist social credit score. Get your protection
[1:13:43.180 --> 1:13:48.700]  privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks.
[1:13:48.700 --> 1:13:58.140]  infowarstore.com. A little more than a decade ago, it happened in Salt Lake City, Utah. The public
[1:13:58.140 --> 1:14:02.860]  came out on a very clear day and looked up more than 60,000 feet and saw what they thought was a
[1:14:02.860 --> 1:14:10.940]  giant UFO. It was actually a large DARPA government surveillance blimp. There were thousands of phone
[1:14:10.940 --> 1:14:15.660]  calls made in the police department's newspapers, TV stations, thinking it was an alien craft. When
[1:14:15.660 --> 1:14:19.100]  the public was told that it was a blimp, they didn't want to believe it. You see, they'd already
[1:14:19.980 --> 1:14:26.140]  told themselves it was a UFO, so they had cognitive distance. It's kind of like the fact that
[1:14:26.140 --> 1:14:31.500]  COVID-19 is hundreds of times weaker than the flu, let people still want to live in fear and wear a
[1:14:31.500 --> 1:14:35.820]  mask outside, even in their cars, even in their houses. Well, it happened again over New Jersey
[1:14:35.820 --> 1:14:40.940]  yesterday. The Goodyear blimp was out there with a big gumbo tron TV screen on the side of it and
[1:14:40.940 --> 1:14:45.900]  had flashing lights on, just like an airplane. The public thought it was a UFO, and now the
[1:14:45.900 --> 1:14:49.820]  public still believes it was a UFO, and now they were told it wasn't. You see, that's called a highly
[1:14:49.820 --> 1:14:57.900]  suggestible group of slaves. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:14:57.900 --> 1:15:13.180]  I've got a tiger by the tail that's way to see. I won't be much when you get through with me.
[1:15:14.140 --> 1:15:22.380]  He never gives up. He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[1:15:22.380 --> 1:15:34.140]  You know, Limbets got chalkboards. Those are good, good things to use. I think I'm going to
[1:15:34.140 --> 1:15:39.180]  imitate that. He didn't invent the chalkboard. He ripped off most of what we do, so that's the most
[1:15:39.180 --> 1:15:42.380]  sincere form of flattery. But I'm thinking about getting a chalkboard, actually, because we're
[1:15:42.380 --> 1:15:47.020]  going to illustrate a lot there. But I've got a few props here. During the break, I was thinking
[1:15:47.020 --> 1:15:52.380]  about this this morning, like 4 a.m. when I woke up, and then I forgot until during the break,
[1:15:52.380 --> 1:15:56.220]  I was thinking, what do I got laying around the office that can use as a prop to describe this
[1:15:56.220 --> 1:15:59.580]  that's really, really important? And I know the audience already knows this, but this is what you
[1:15:59.580 --> 1:16:02.540]  got to explain to your friends and family. So let me do it this way. Then I'm going to give the
[1:16:02.540 --> 1:16:08.540]  number out and take your calls. Coming up next segment. Let's take Madam President as the archetypal
[1:16:08.540 --> 1:16:15.660]  image of true Satanism, true selfishness, just absolute emptiness, and everything that is opposed
[1:16:15.660 --> 1:16:22.860]  to human development. Okay? Madam President and the forces that she represents, though she's just
[1:16:22.860 --> 1:16:28.780]  an archetype of Satan. But then I thought, what do I have as props? Well, I've got a chessboard
[1:16:30.700 --> 1:16:36.780]  and then I've got this cool crystal falcon that my wife gave me, that we got in Mexico.
[1:16:38.300 --> 1:16:44.780]  But it's still a predator bird, so we'll look at it as a predator. Because what is a sociopath,
[1:16:44.780 --> 1:16:49.500]  or worse than that? What's a psychopath? Well, it's a predator. It doesn't care about you. It
[1:16:49.500 --> 1:16:54.140]  doesn't want to build a civilization with you. It doesn't like making you dinner and seeing you happy.
[1:16:54.140 --> 1:16:59.740]  Doesn't like giving you a massage. Doesn't like giving you pleasure. It likes to rape people.
[1:16:59.740 --> 1:17:07.660]  It likes to take things. See, it likes to hurt people. And once you start thinking about the
[1:17:07.660 --> 1:17:12.460]  world through its eyes, things make sense. Whereas I like to give pleasure. I know you do as well.
[1:17:12.460 --> 1:17:15.660]  I love to cook a good dinner for people other than to cook a good dinner for me. I love to,
[1:17:15.660 --> 1:17:22.460]  you know, make my wife feel good. I love to try to empower you because I'm part of you. I'm not
[1:17:22.460 --> 1:17:26.540]  cut off psychically. I am part of you. I'm an individual, but I'm psychically connected to you.
[1:17:27.180 --> 1:17:31.820]  So your success is, it makes me feel successful. When people don't do well, I don't feel good
[1:17:31.820 --> 1:17:38.700]  about that unless they're evil and an enemy. But see, these sociopaths and psychopaths and Satanists,
[1:17:38.700 --> 1:17:46.140]  the conscious Satanists, they know most people are inherently good. They're fallen, they have
[1:17:46.140 --> 1:17:52.220]  bad in them, but they want good. They're inclined towards good. The spirit is willing, but the flesh
[1:17:52.220 --> 1:17:59.260]  is weak, as I think it was Paul said. But see, to win the chessboard, they have to convince the
[1:17:59.260 --> 1:18:03.740]  average person that they're under attack. So if you've got Black Lives Matter, I guess let's just
[1:18:03.740 --> 1:18:09.020]  say symbolized by these brown pieces over here, run by Soros. A, you know, already they're under
[1:18:09.020 --> 1:18:12.140]  the command of Soros. They're not trying to help Black people, but they think they're helping Black
[1:18:12.140 --> 1:18:17.020]  people, though they're king of Soros and Satan over here. And they doesn't represent Black people.
[1:18:17.020 --> 1:18:22.220]  That's a hoax itself. And then you've got the so-called white pieces. If they could show a Black
[1:18:22.220 --> 1:18:31.020]  person being wrongfully killed, that creates the perception that they're being killed. And so people
[1:18:31.020 --> 1:18:34.700]  get really, really upset, even though, as the Attorney General said, it's about 12. The numbers
[1:18:34.700 --> 1:18:41.500]  I've seen are 14. Black men get wrongfully killed a year by police in cases that are found where
[1:18:41.500 --> 1:18:45.260]  it's the cop made a mistake or was crazy or whatever, and it does happen. Let's just say it's
[1:18:45.260 --> 1:18:52.860]  a hundred. The point is, there aren't as many pieces on this chessboard of actual Black men killed
[1:18:52.860 --> 1:18:57.660]  by police that could be proven that was wrong than there are in a chessboard. Whereas there are
[1:18:57.660 --> 1:19:02.700]  2,000 Black men killed by other Black men in Chicago on average every year. That'd be 2,000 chess
[1:19:02.700 --> 1:19:09.020]  pieces versus these chess pieces. Think about that. On one side of a chessboard, there's 1, 2, 3,
[1:19:09.020 --> 1:19:16.220]  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. So there's two more chess pieces on one side of the
[1:19:16.220 --> 1:19:23.420]  chessboard than actual Black men that died. But can you imagine 2,000 Brown chess pieces dead
[1:19:23.420 --> 1:19:30.700]  by the evil White pieces? But is it actually White pieces doing it? No. Picture humanity
[1:19:32.460 --> 1:19:36.700]  as this chessboard, and we think we're fighting with each other and divide and conquer. We think
[1:19:36.700 --> 1:19:43.660]  we're winning a war on this planet, but up here is the spirit, this predator that's represented by
[1:19:43.660 --> 1:19:48.140]  his operatives on this planet. They could be White, they could be Black, but their souls are evil
[1:19:48.140 --> 1:19:56.780]  that is preying on this whole thing. But see, it's in another dimension. It's see-through.
[1:19:57.580 --> 1:20:03.900]  They can't see it. We can see it if we have spiritual discernment, but see, it's not Black,
[1:20:03.900 --> 1:20:08.860]  it's not White, it's not Brown, it's an entity.
[1:20:08.860 --> 1:20:18.220]  And it knows that if we have memory and a common sense in logic, it can't fool us.
[1:20:19.020 --> 1:20:23.180]  So that's why they've trained us with television and the culture to go from on average 45-minute
[1:20:23.980 --> 1:20:29.580]  attention spans to about 7-second attention spans for the average young person. Now, a Goldfish
[1:20:29.580 --> 1:20:38.300]  has a longer attention span, ladies and gentlemen, than a human now under the age of 30.
[1:20:40.060 --> 1:20:48.140]  And so, think about this. Imagine if these pieces were moving against you, but your memory wasn't
[1:20:48.140 --> 1:20:54.620]  even as long as one checker or one chess square. So you couldn't even see it moving,
[1:20:54.620 --> 1:20:57.980]  because unless it moved in instantly against you, you couldn't even fight back,
[1:20:57.980 --> 1:21:02.220]  because even though it's moving against you, taking your rights, taking your freedoms, poisoning you,
[1:21:02.220 --> 1:21:07.260]  giving you cancer, you can't see it because you don't have a memory. Because a memory is nothing
[1:21:07.260 --> 1:21:13.580]  but time, space, understanding. It's sight. So if you don't know the past and you don't know the
[1:21:13.580 --> 1:21:22.540]  present, you sure won't know the future. This entity is manipulating you and controlling you,
[1:21:22.540 --> 1:21:29.740]  and it wants to destroy the entire board. It doesn't see color. It sees humans.
[1:21:31.260 --> 1:21:40.380]  It wants dominance over that board, because what we turn into, what we become in the universe
[1:21:41.260 --> 1:21:45.340]  is much more dominant than this, and it doesn't like that it wants control of this planet.
[1:21:46.060 --> 1:21:50.300]  This is some pretty good real estate, and you don't just think that there's humans that want
[1:21:50.300 --> 1:21:55.580]  control of this real estate. The Bible tells us there is a fallen entity that needs to be knocked
[1:21:55.580 --> 1:22:03.340]  down. Oh, and it's beautiful. Satan's very pretty, but it wants to destroy you, and it will bugle
[1:22:03.340 --> 1:22:07.900]  you, and it will lie to you. The only way to defeat it is to admit that it's a game, and it's playing
[1:22:07.900 --> 1:22:14.300]  itself against each other, and recognize it, and come together, and understand that our destinies
[1:22:14.300 --> 1:22:20.220]  are all tied together, and that this thing is not our friend, and it's here to destroy us. But until
[1:22:20.220 --> 1:22:29.260]  we do that, we have absolutely no power over this, and that's really the simple allegory or the
[1:22:29.260 --> 1:22:37.420]  analogy that I wanted to show you. The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALIX, 877-789-2539,
[1:22:37.420 --> 1:22:49.580]  877-789-ALIX, 877-789-ALIX, or 512-646-1776. This creature is not invincible. We've beaten
[1:22:49.580 --> 1:22:54.780]  it before, we'll beat it again. But if you deny the devil's existence, that is his greatest trick.
[1:22:56.380 --> 1:23:02.940]  It's real, and it wants to destroy you, and enslave you, and control you. And I suggest that you don't
[1:23:02.940 --> 1:23:09.500]  let it have that victory over you, and start understanding the reality. Fourteen black men
[1:23:09.500 --> 1:23:15.980]  are killed by police in the wrong every year, conservatively. It could be even lower. Learn
[1:23:15.980 --> 1:23:20.060]  statistics, learn real numbers, learn Planned Parenthood that says it loves you and runs
[1:23:20.060 --> 1:23:25.100]  a Democratic Party, but its main mission is to kill all of these. But really, it was only setting
[1:23:25.100 --> 1:23:29.820]  the precedent to knock out a group that racist whites would agree with knocking out, before
[1:23:29.820 --> 1:23:38.140]  it turns and gets everybody. See, it's got to trick people, trick this group to isolate this
[1:23:38.140 --> 1:23:42.300]  group, and take it out, and then it turns on this group. And to do that, it gets this group to do
[1:23:42.300 --> 1:23:46.780]  horrible things, and attack this group. So this group gets pissed off and goes, okay, I'll kill
[1:23:46.780 --> 1:23:54.060]  them. And it's like, thanks for taking them out. Now I'm going to kill you. In Germany, in Australia,
[1:23:54.060 --> 1:24:02.540]  in Canada, and now even in Ohio, every blue state, every blue city is announcing that they are
[1:24:02.540 --> 1:24:09.020]  establishing emergency COVID centers for people that refuse to be tested or people that are tested,
[1:24:09.020 --> 1:24:14.380]  but refuse to stay in place while the results are coming back, or those that supposedly break
[1:24:14.380 --> 1:24:20.540]  quarantine. This, of course, is all based on the tests that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed
[1:24:20.540 --> 1:24:27.660]  to be so. This is a power grab. The world government globalist system is in trouble.
[1:24:27.660 --> 1:24:34.060]  All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it. And every blue area, I use the term
[1:24:34.060 --> 1:24:40.300]  blue, as if the US for blue for Democrats, red for Republicans, is basically globalist or communist
[1:24:40.300 --> 1:24:45.580]  and authoritarian. And they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian takeover,
[1:24:45.580 --> 1:24:49.500]  because they know the world's waiting to them. It's a very simple equation. It's illegal. We
[1:24:49.500 --> 1:24:57.340]  must resist it. Remember, the enemy is working around the clock to suppress voices of independent
[1:24:57.340 --> 1:25:04.460]  people all over the world. The globalist have a plan for total vertical integration.
[1:25:05.340 --> 1:25:13.500]  Absolute authoritarianism to where you are a captive of their devices, of their control.
[1:25:13.500 --> 1:25:19.820]  But that is only a means to an end. Once they have the electronic straightjacket in place,
[1:25:19.820 --> 1:25:24.860]  they are on record that they will bring in forced inoculations that sterilize you and your family
[1:25:24.860 --> 1:25:31.340]  and worse. Many of the vaccines being pushed by the United Nations actually give people polio
[1:25:31.340 --> 1:25:37.980]  and actually give people cancer. Most cancer is viral. That's a big secret. But the secret is
[1:25:37.980 --> 1:25:45.020]  beginning to come out. It's even in the Associated Press. Remember, all of these banned videos and
[1:25:45.020 --> 1:25:50.060]  reports are banned on video, but only you can share them and save humanity.
[1:25:51.180 --> 1:25:57.580]  There is a forced evolution taking place. The scientific ruling elite believe they are
[1:25:57.580 --> 1:26:03.500]  transcending to a silicon live form. While they are making this hypothetical, very dangerous
[1:26:03.500 --> 1:26:09.020]  transition that is guaranteed doom to fail and create nightmares that are almost unimaginable,
[1:26:09.580 --> 1:26:16.220]  their plan for us is extermination or spiking the canon. Like after a major war is done,
[1:26:16.220 --> 1:26:20.940]  you don't want those weapons used again, you get rid of them. We are being rendered into scrap
[1:26:21.580 --> 1:26:25.660]  metal right now. So think about all your ancestors, think about your grandparents,
[1:26:25.660 --> 1:26:28.940]  think about your parents, think about your children, think about the future and ask yourself,
[1:26:28.940 --> 1:26:33.420]  are you really going to let a bunch of crazy mad scientists steal the future desi of everyone
[1:26:33.420 --> 1:26:39.020]  and basically use us like guinea pigs to experiment so they can try to find cures to cancer and
[1:26:39.020 --> 1:26:45.580]  things, not for us, but for them? Bill Gates is the leader of this organization. Bill Gates is
[1:26:45.580 --> 1:26:49.340]  the enemy of humanity. Decide what you're going to do, America. Decide what you're going to do,
[1:26:49.340 --> 1:26:56.620]  humanity. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:26:56.620 --> 1:27:07.980]  Hello Americans, I'm Paul Harvey. If I were the devil, if I were the prince of darkness,
[1:27:07.980 --> 1:27:12.380]  I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness and I'd have a third of its real estate and
[1:27:12.380 --> 1:27:16.940]  four fifths of its population, but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the
[1:27:16.940 --> 1:27:24.620]  tree. So I said about however necessary to take over the United States. President Kennedy has been
[1:27:24.620 --> 1:27:29.820]  seriously wounded by the shooting. I'd subvert the churches first. I'd begin with a campaign of
[1:27:29.820 --> 1:27:34.780]  whispers with the wisdom of a serpent I would whisper to you as I whispered to you. Do as you
[1:27:34.780 --> 1:27:39.420]  please. To the young I would whisper that the Bible is a myth. I would convince them that man
[1:27:39.420 --> 1:27:44.220]  created God instead of the other way around. I would confide that what's bad is good and what's
[1:27:44.220 --> 1:27:51.500]  good is square. And the old I would teach to pray after me. Our father, which aren't in Washington
[1:27:51.500 --> 1:27:57.420]  and then I'd get organized. I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that
[1:27:57.420 --> 1:28:02.300]  anything else would appear dull and uninteresting. I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice
[1:28:02.300 --> 1:28:07.100]  versa. I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could. I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of
[1:28:07.100 --> 1:28:13.580]  distinction. I'd tranquilize the rest with pills. If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at
[1:28:13.580 --> 1:28:19.020]  war with themselves, churches at war with themselves and nations at war with themselves
[1:28:19.020 --> 1:28:25.820]  until each in its turn was consumed. And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing
[1:28:25.820 --> 1:28:31.980]  media banning the blame. The president of the United States is racist. If I were the devil,
[1:28:31.980 --> 1:28:35.900]  I would encourage schools to decline young intellects but neglect the discipline of
[1:28:35.900 --> 1:28:41.660]  emotions just like those run wild. Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing. I'd have judges
[1:28:41.660 --> 1:28:46.860]  promoting pornography. Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse,
[1:28:46.860 --> 1:28:51.580]  and then from the houses of conscience. And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology
[1:28:51.580 --> 1:28:59.180]  for religion. I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[1:28:59.180 --> 1:29:04.940]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed
[1:29:04.940 --> 1:29:11.180]  the incentive of the ambitious. I would caution against extremes. I'm here to warn people. You
[1:29:11.180 --> 1:29:17.660]  keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game. In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct,
[1:29:17.660 --> 1:29:21.980]  I would convince the young that marriage is old fashioned, that swinging is more fun,
[1:29:21.980 --> 1:29:27.100]  that what you see on TV is the way to be. And thus I could undress you in public,
[1:29:27.900 --> 1:29:34.220]  and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure. In other words,
[1:29:34.220 --> 1:29:50.140]  if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[1:29:56.220 --> 1:30:02.620]  Now you know the rest of the story. All right, we're taking your phone calls
[1:30:02.620 --> 1:30:10.540]  on the medical tyranny. It's not a prediction that this is UN run and they're going to come with
[1:30:10.540 --> 1:30:15.340]  contact tracers and blood draws and secretly arrest you and disappear you to secret facilities.
[1:30:15.340 --> 1:30:21.580]  That's what the UN said they do eight months ago. And now in Quebec City, now in Ohio, USA,
[1:30:21.580 --> 1:30:27.020]  now in Australia, now in Dallas and Houston and everywhere they're coming with the
[1:30:28.220 --> 1:30:31.820]  forced blood draws. And so we're going to start arresting people. They're trying to get cops to
[1:30:31.820 --> 1:30:37.900]  do it. And the rest of people not wearing masks. This is the takeover. Has nothing to do with the
[1:30:37.900 --> 1:30:43.260]  virus or the death numbers. It's the power grab to lock our economy down when China is wide open
[1:30:43.260 --> 1:30:49.100]  for business. Now the CDC says breathing is a problem. It's the reason coronavirus is spreading.
[1:30:49.100 --> 1:30:50.940]  It's an attack on reality.
[1:30:53.180 --> 1:30:57.740]  LA Alexander is going to be joining us coming up next hour. We've got several really important
[1:30:57.740 --> 1:31:01.260]  special reports we're going to premiere. We're going to be looking at the fires all over the
[1:31:01.260 --> 1:31:06.620]  United States. The Pentagon coming on saying China has directed energy weapons to attack
[1:31:06.620 --> 1:31:10.620]  space targets and ground targets. And a lot of experts a year ago during the fires said a lot
[1:31:10.620 --> 1:31:14.540]  of them look like they're laser targeted. We're going to look at that as well with the Gregory's
[1:31:14.540 --> 1:31:19.900]  report. But let's go to your calls right now. We got Mountain Patriot and Jeff and Forest and
[1:31:19.900 --> 1:31:25.420]  Kelly and Taylor and Matt and Ian and Eric and Bella and so many others. I'm going to move quick
[1:31:25.420 --> 1:31:33.340]  through these. Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff. Jeff in Colorado. Hey Alex. How are you doing?
[1:31:33.340 --> 1:31:36.060]  Thanks for having me on. I'm doing all right brother. Go ahead.
[1:31:38.540 --> 1:31:44.540]  To talk about biblical prophecy because you've touched on this a lot and I truly believe that
[1:31:44.540 --> 1:31:50.700]  we are living in those times and I've tried to warn people around me about that. And they have
[1:31:50.700 --> 1:31:56.380]  this hopeless optimism that we're going to return to the way things were. And I'm just not feeling
[1:31:56.380 --> 1:32:01.740]  it. Oh I mean the UN says it never ends. They would never stop. They're never going to they
[1:32:01.740 --> 1:32:07.100]  until we start saying no. But see it's always oh it'll stop someday. We'll be a thousand years
[1:32:07.100 --> 1:32:12.220]  from now with forced inoculations. Everybody's most of us are dead. We you know master glued on
[1:32:12.220 --> 1:32:17.980]  we're born. If these people had their way. Well and I want to take it a step further
[1:32:17.980 --> 1:32:24.300]  and go a little deeper with with this in the Bible it says that you know people who are really
[1:32:24.300 --> 1:32:30.860]  following the word will receive dreams and visions that give us an idea of what's to come.
[1:32:30.860 --> 1:32:36.220]  And I've had several this year more so than I've ever had. It's like on a weekly basis now.
[1:32:36.220 --> 1:32:41.340]  I have to. It's it's nightly now. It's over the top. One of those dreams has to do with
[1:32:41.340 --> 1:32:46.780]  President Trump facing a huge economic collapse that has to come. But that's not the one I want
[1:32:46.780 --> 1:32:49.820]  to talk about. I agree they're going to do that one way or the other next year.
[1:32:50.700 --> 1:32:57.660]  So what I wanted to talk about has to do with Obama and I had a dream that it was at Denver
[1:32:57.660 --> 1:33:01.420]  International Airport. People were running around. They were preparing for some sort of imminent
[1:33:01.420 --> 1:33:06.780]  attack a bomb a missile something and then the dream shifted to this underground facility
[1:33:06.780 --> 1:33:13.980]  where there were these guys at a boardroom table. Obama was there manufacturing this imminent
[1:33:13.980 --> 1:33:20.380]  attack. Whatever that attack was I woke up at 2 a.m. and to be honest with you I've never given
[1:33:20.380 --> 1:33:25.660]  a second thought about Obama's people at the office. But I thought OK when he was president
[1:33:25.660 --> 1:33:31.260]  maybe this guy could be the antichrist because of the hope message and how people practically
[1:33:31.260 --> 1:33:37.820]  worship him and the media worship him. But now if you think about it out of chaos comes order.
[1:33:37.820 --> 1:33:43.180]  There will be chaos for the rest of the year and don't expect 2021 to be smooth at all.
[1:33:43.180 --> 1:33:47.980]  It's going to get worse. And don't expect the deep state to ratchet back what they're doing.
[1:33:47.980 --> 1:33:54.540]  Amazing points. Jeff go ahead and finish up. Well who do you think would step up. Who do you
[1:33:54.540 --> 1:34:01.820]  think the UN would appoint who would be a godlike status symbol a person who would be worshipped
[1:34:01.820 --> 1:34:08.060]  by the media. Obama is sympathetic to BLM. Oh there's no doubt this is all being prepared.
[1:34:08.060 --> 1:34:12.460]  That's why Soros the document said try to cause martial law before so Obama stay in office.
[1:34:12.460 --> 1:34:16.060]  They definitely treat him like some type of Messiah figure. Thank you so much for your
[1:34:16.060 --> 1:34:21.420]  call. Great points. Carlos in Canada is always a great call. Let's go to him. Carlos go ahead.
[1:34:22.220 --> 1:34:28.460]  Yes thank you Alex. I wanted to just mention that the very important event took place in
[1:34:30.860 --> 1:34:39.180]  to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1950. James Paul Warburg international financier
[1:34:39.180 --> 1:34:46.460]  of course and banker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that world government you're
[1:34:46.460 --> 1:34:53.740]  going to have it one day whether by consent or by force. I think you said by consent or conquest.
[1:34:56.220 --> 1:35:02.060]  Yes you're right conquest and we're there. We're at the stage where
[1:35:02.060 --> 1:35:11.740]  the United Nations for instance instituted initially to keep peace among nations by having
[1:35:11.740 --> 1:35:17.980]  the sovereignty of nations protected by the entire collective so that no individual nation could
[1:35:17.980 --> 1:35:23.500]  just jump over the border and do whatever it wants on the sovereignty of the smaller nations.
[1:35:23.500 --> 1:35:29.740]  That was the design you were going to have five basic if you want to call it control
[1:35:29.740 --> 1:35:35.420]  huge nations with atomic power and all the rest were going to be nations protected by the collective
[1:35:36.460 --> 1:35:42.540]  rules. So it's a UN world government just like Hunger Games. Hunger Games is based on the UN model
[1:35:42.540 --> 1:35:47.980]  not vice versa so it's it's art imitating life and it's total global tyranny with a UN force
[1:35:47.980 --> 1:35:53.180]  everyone else disarmed and then the UN carries out the orderly depopulation. That's the official
[1:35:53.180 --> 1:35:59.100]  UN plan. Who gave them that mandate? Nobody did. They have no mandate in fact. No they don't. It's
[1:35:59.100 --> 1:36:05.980]  just a power grab. Yeah well President Trump and he's not alone by the way I know for a fact that
[1:36:05.980 --> 1:36:11.740]  their organizations worldwide who are questioning the authority of the United Nations to intervene.
[1:36:11.740 --> 1:36:16.220]  No I agree. So how big a deal is it that Trump's pulling out pulled out of the WHO pulled out of
[1:36:16.220 --> 1:36:21.180]  treaties. That shows he's the real deal. He needs to fully pull out of the United Nations. He needs
[1:36:21.180 --> 1:36:27.180]  to take the property in New York. Well it's a joke. I mean look at the sovereignty of a country
[1:36:27.180 --> 1:36:31.740]  that is not protected the moment that the collective does not protect the sovereignty of a country.
[1:36:31.740 --> 1:36:35.580]  No I agree Americans and others are probably going to start moving on the UN building
[1:36:35.580 --> 1:36:39.740]  like they did on Chescue in Romania and I'm not calling for that I'm just saying
[1:36:39.740 --> 1:36:44.060]  it's backed up by a bunch of stolen money and a bunch of Rothschild money and it's backed up by
[1:36:44.060 --> 1:36:49.900]  the media. That's it and it's our enemy that wants to lock us down and kill us. They want to kill us.
[1:36:49.900 --> 1:36:54.380]  I've come to you many times and asked for your support and you've always come through
[1:36:54.380 --> 1:37:00.060]  and Info Wars has come through. We've never sold out. We've never backed down. We've always told
[1:37:00.060 --> 1:37:06.700]  the truth. We've made mistakes but 98% of the time or so we're dead on and the enemy knows
[1:37:06.700 --> 1:37:11.820]  that. Info Wars is a thought leader not just here but around the world and that's why the
[1:37:11.820 --> 1:37:17.660]  Chai comms, Hollywood, the globalists want us off the air because their global plan of total
[1:37:17.660 --> 1:37:23.180]  tyranny and a post-human world will not succeed if we stay on air. If you don't support us ladies
[1:37:23.180 --> 1:37:27.900]  and gentlemen now they're going to shut Info Wars down and shut everybody else down as well.
[1:37:27.900 --> 1:37:34.060]  You already know that it's out the open so again count the cost focus and realize how critical
[1:37:34.060 --> 1:37:38.300]  you are with your word of mouth spreading the word that overrides the sensors, your financial
[1:37:38.300 --> 1:37:42.780]  support getting the products at infowarstore.com and your prayer. I'm praying for you. Please pray
[1:37:42.780 --> 1:37:47.100]  for us. Let's do this together. We're going to win. We are winning but it's not going to be easy.
[1:37:47.100 --> 1:37:51.260]  The enemy is trying to take it all from us. Let's not let them succeed. Last week Tucker Carlson
[1:37:51.260 --> 1:37:56.700]  came out and said America is becoming the Soviet Union. In many ways we're worse than the Soviet
[1:37:56.700 --> 1:38:02.460]  Union. The Soviet Union couldn't dream of what big tech can do surveilling and censoring us and
[1:38:02.460 --> 1:38:06.460]  we're going to get a lot worse than the Soviet Union when it comes to force inoculations and the
[1:38:06.460 --> 1:38:11.740]  medical tyranny being rolled out by the United Nations now in control of what you can and can't
[1:38:11.740 --> 1:38:17.660]  say online. The truth is ladies and gentlemen America is fighting for its life and the enemy's
[1:38:17.660 --> 1:38:23.420]  number one mission is to get Trump out of office and number two is to silence info wars because we
[1:38:23.420 --> 1:38:29.420]  understand just how pediabolical they are just how evil they are and we won't miss words. We know
[1:38:29.420 --> 1:38:33.900]  who the globalist are. We've got their number and we know how to beat them and we cover it seven days
[1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:39.100]  a week live at info wars and it's only because of your support so keep spreading the word keep
[1:38:39.100 --> 1:38:43.900]  praying for us and take advantage of the sales and get great products at infowarstore.com now
[1:38:43.900 --> 1:38:50.700]  the globalists are hoping you don't visit infowarstore.com
[1:38:51.260 --> 1:38:58.700]  and perhaps most cruely of all if Donald Trump has his way the complications of COVID-19
[1:38:59.420 --> 1:39:06.940]  which are well beyond what they should be it's estimated that two hundred million people have
[1:39:06.940 --> 1:39:14.300]  died probably by the time i finish this talk. Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar part
[1:39:14.300 --> 1:39:21.500]  of the establishment for close to 50 years but now boy as his brain degenerates we are seeing
[1:39:21.500 --> 1:39:28.700]  walking public dementia on the biggest stage of the world the 2020 election there are 370 million
[1:39:28.700 --> 1:39:34.940]  people in the united states if 200 million died from COVID that'd be more than half of the population
[1:39:34.940 --> 1:39:40.220]  when not even one tenth of one percent have actually died but him putting these giant lies
[1:39:40.220 --> 1:39:45.100]  and these incredibly brain damage statements out is emblematic of the general public being
[1:39:45.100 --> 1:39:51.660]  in a trance how is anyone even putting up with this it is beyond bizarre i've got some bad news
[1:39:51.660 --> 1:39:57.660]  for you then i got some really bad news and i've got some good news the bad news is even if Trump
[1:39:57.660 --> 1:40:02.860]  gets reelected they're gonna still trigger attempts at martial law medical lockdowns race riots
[1:40:02.860 --> 1:40:07.420]  and a depression that's the globalists they're trying to bring america to our knees now if
[1:40:07.420 --> 1:40:12.700]  trump doesn't get elected they're still planning to bring us to our knees and really try to break
[1:40:12.700 --> 1:40:17.260]  our will and bring us into a super intense depression total control and like australia is
[1:40:17.260 --> 1:40:22.380]  already doing rounding up and arresting people that criticize what the left are doing that's
[1:40:22.380 --> 1:40:26.700]  the really bad news the good news is this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the
[1:40:26.700 --> 1:40:32.300]  world and the resistance is mounting and the globalist are panicking so bottom line we're in the
[1:40:32.300 --> 1:40:37.980]  fight we're starting to win but it's serious so pray to god for a global awakening support info
[1:40:37.980 --> 1:40:42.540]  or spread the word and buy products at info or store.com literally we're having an emergency

[1:40:47.660 --> 1:40:56.700]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:05.580 --> 1:41:09.900]  let's go right back to carlos in canada i'm your host alex jones and a lot of other callers
[1:41:09.900 --> 1:41:18.220]  like forest and mountain man the tom agage and many others all right so you were getting into
[1:41:18.220 --> 1:41:24.620]  united nations and overstepping its role imagine we wake up eight months ago
[1:41:26.460 --> 1:41:33.020]  and if the un doesn't say it's true you can't say it including hospitals medical doctors suddenly
[1:41:33.020 --> 1:41:39.420]  the un is boss over all of big tech so big tech says oh governments can't tell us what to do
[1:41:39.420 --> 1:41:42.940]  and the u.s government can't tell us what to do is we violate people's rights and spy on them and
[1:41:43.500 --> 1:41:49.020]  censor them but the un is boss and congress still sits there with their thumb and their rear end
[1:41:49.020 --> 1:41:58.700]  carlos it is a question of the our concept of the united nations it arose as a failure of the
[1:41:59.260 --> 1:42:04.460]  treaty of versi after world war one and in world war one the reason why versi failed in
[1:42:04.460 --> 1:42:10.860]  large measure was because empires were still empires they had colonies so they were forced
[1:42:10.860 --> 1:42:15.340]  by financial interest and and by you know yeah the very robber barons that wanted to have a
[1:42:15.340 --> 1:42:20.220]  financial empire get rid of the old empires they set up the league of nations which failed by design
[1:42:21.020 --> 1:42:26.380]  right and then the colonies were were taken apart from the empires empires collapsed so you had
[1:42:26.380 --> 1:42:32.940]  france and so on some interests were even that even france wouldn't be part remain even as a nation
[1:42:32.940 --> 1:42:39.740]  and so it was essentially small nations in a control by atomic powers essentially and that was a
[1:42:39.740 --> 1:42:45.500]  concept now the ideal was right Bertrand Russell postulated that and he said of other nations
[1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:50.780]  fought that the world government would just nuke them correct but you see it was the united
[1:42:50.780 --> 1:42:57.020]  nations the sovereignty of each individual nation protected by the collective under a reasoned if
[1:42:57.020 --> 1:43:03.020]  you want to call it executive based on Ruskin's ideas of the the elites are better than the
[1:43:03.020 --> 1:43:07.900]  commoners to rule themselves so when you look at it in the context of what it was created
[1:43:07.900 --> 1:43:12.620]  the united nations is totally out of total order mandate it is absolutely irrelevant it doesn't
[1:43:12.620 --> 1:43:17.900]  even protect the sovereignty of nations look at the palestinian israeli struggle i mean for instance
[1:43:17.900 --> 1:43:23.020]  okay with all respect to the fact that i respect the right of nations to exist it doesn't matter
[1:43:23.020 --> 1:43:28.700]  that if the sovereignty of a country is invaded by another by bombing or by belly causes belly
[1:43:29.340 --> 1:43:34.060]  then at that point the united collective is supposed to get together and say we cut it out
[1:43:34.060 --> 1:43:38.780]  because according to the rules of the game we don't we maintain peace by collective
[1:43:38.780 --> 1:43:44.380]  of sovereignty support now if you do not do that and the united states sovereignty at the level of
[1:43:44.380 --> 1:43:50.940]  you and i is to tell me and you and canada or in the united states to wear a mask i mean what
[1:43:50.940 --> 1:43:55.820]  what is this exactly supposed to be a league of nations where we go and then make decisions it's
[1:43:55.820 --> 1:43:59.740]  not where the un tells us what to do it's a corporate world government thank you carlos let's

[1:44:26.780 --> 1:44:34.620]  speech i did the math this morning that's 25 times the entire world population in his claim

[1:44:40.780 --> 1:44:45.820]  billion but it's still it's still over half the us population of course it is a true but i mean

[1:47:42.220 --> 1:47:46.620]  months it's all happening and just like any war it's boom it invades it's like there's nothing
[1:47:46.620 --> 1:47:52.540]  there and the bam the damn breaks and and we're inside of it yeah and then just how the public
[1:47:52.540 --> 1:47:57.420]  has just brought into all of it and they're loving the tyranny they're loving the force in the mass
[1:47:57.420 --> 1:48:03.500]  and the social distancing and any um opinion which is against what the state says is completely
[1:48:03.500 --> 1:48:08.860]  anathema and they treat you like a criminal and what's crazy is local businesses love staying
[1:48:08.860 --> 1:48:14.300]  closed or 25 percent even though it's bankrupting them and amazon and walmart and target aren't
[1:48:14.300 --> 1:48:20.460]  so all the big money is consolidating power starving the third world uh i mean look at what's
[1:48:20.460 --> 1:48:25.740]  happening all over the world africa the starvation the coven isn't causing that the coven lockdown
[1:48:25.740 --> 1:48:31.660]  is do you speak to that yeah the head of the un food program said the family's cause are going to
[1:48:31.660 --> 1:48:37.180]  be biblical in proportion i mean the estimates in tens of millions are going to die the lockdowns
[1:48:37.180 --> 1:48:41.660]  have been a catastrophe the wrecked the world economy and as you said when the the first world
[1:48:41.660 --> 1:48:46.780]  needs is the third world gets thick and it's just ridiculous i mean we're in we're in big trouble here
[1:48:46.780 --> 1:48:51.340]  we're in big trouble and have the great reset agenda coming up next year so they're looking to
[1:48:51.340 --> 1:48:56.380]  collapse the economy further consolidate power trillions in bailouts just consolidating everything
[1:48:56.380 --> 1:49:00.700]  the mega bank is just sucking everything up sucking our freedom sucking our dignity we need
[1:49:00.700 --> 1:49:05.020]  to stand up we need to resist that i agree brother and you're on fire i mean for folks that don't
[1:49:05.020 --> 1:49:10.060]  know the average person in the third world has two weeks of food and money and millions more are
[1:49:10.060 --> 1:49:14.700]  dying these are real numbers and so in the left wears their mask and keeps things locked down and
[1:49:14.700 --> 1:49:19.660]  says their virtue signaling they need to be yelled at with the cover of sorrows black lives matter
[1:49:19.660 --> 1:49:25.340]  over 14 black dudes while millions of africans millions of latin americans millions of middle
[1:49:25.340 --> 1:49:31.260]  easterners they're starving the death right now this is this is real you know you got ill on omar
[1:49:31.260 --> 1:49:35.180]  talking about how america's evil and bad meanwhile she doesn't say a word about three million muslim
[1:49:35.180 --> 1:49:42.780]  Uyghurs in in death camps in china or christians or buddhist i mean this is outrageous give us a
[1:49:42.780 --> 1:49:48.780]  ballpark where are you in africa what are you saying i'm in zambia and obviously the lockdowns
[1:49:48.780 --> 1:49:55.100]  there have been heavily enforced and the economy has been real bad alex on the ground the small
[1:49:55.100 --> 1:49:59.820]  business owners have just been hit really hard i'm seeing the the effects of the poverty and it's
[1:49:59.820 --> 1:50:06.140]  just really sad to see well you know the head of the davos group bragg he said we're gonna take
[1:50:06.140 --> 1:50:09.980]  over every small business with this and he laughed about it and said this is the great reset of
[1:50:09.980 --> 1:50:16.220]  a vertical integration they need to be called out but when they see us not calling out china
[1:50:16.220 --> 1:50:21.500]  doing stuff way above what hitler did or stalin did they have a green light and so what do you
[1:50:21.500 --> 1:50:24.860]  think everybody should do i just say get in the face of leftist organizations everywhere
[1:50:24.860 --> 1:50:28.940]  and let people know that they are the diabolical killers they are the genocidus the people behind
[1:50:28.940 --> 1:50:36.060]  the covet hysteria are genocidus exactly the u genesis at the top i read the great reset book
[1:50:36.060 --> 1:50:42.220]  he put out Schwab and um yeah we need to stand up now because once they kill the economy for good
[1:50:42.220 --> 1:50:46.220]  people are going to be too busy just trying to survive to resist any of the tyranny going on
[1:50:46.220 --> 1:50:51.180]  but now is the time before it's too late we need to stand up we need to reclaim our rights we need
[1:50:51.180 --> 1:50:55.580]  to not bow down to the social distancing and the enforcing and really just we just need to stand up

[1:51:41.020 --> 1:51:45.980]  you notice that over and over again the united nations are supposed controllers and bosses the
[1:51:45.980 --> 1:51:50.940]  great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with has come out and said nothing can
[1:51:50.940 --> 1:51:57.420]  treat or prevent covid-19 ladies and gentlemen that's a total lie you get a lot of sunlight it's on
[1:51:57.420 --> 1:52:02.860]  record to produce a ton of vitamin d3 and it's almost impossible to get viral infections when
[1:52:02.860 --> 1:52:07.580]  you're getting plenty of vitamin d3 if you have zinc and vitamin c as well that's why people get
[1:52:07.580 --> 1:52:12.380]  the flus and these colds in the winter because that's on vitamin d levels plunge now i've pointed
[1:52:12.380 --> 1:52:17.820]  this out and the media has called me a scammer for saying that there's hope and that people
[1:52:17.820 --> 1:52:21.980]  should have their vitamins and their minerals well now fouchy's been forced to come out and
[1:52:21.980 --> 1:52:27.820]  admit that you need vitamin d3 and see he should have also added zinc because the NIH website says
[1:52:27.820 --> 1:52:32.860]  you die without zinc but it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality because

[1:53:53.420 --> 1:54:02.380]  there's a man going around there's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free
[1:54:02.380 --> 1:54:10.140]  and who to blame everybody won't be treated all the same you know all these globalists like the
[1:54:10.140 --> 1:54:17.100]  Rockefellers the Rockschilds they want to keep playing games like they're god good luck with that

[1:54:23.660 --> 1:54:27.500]  you could tell that's probably some middle-class or well-to-do person in zambia
[1:54:27.500 --> 1:54:33.500]  watching the total martial law and the starvation people dying and there it's very dignified you

[1:54:46.460 --> 1:54:51.020]  the white people are all racist and meanwhile the real globalists that want to kill everybody
[1:54:51.020 --> 1:54:56.540]  have become the mass murderer of africa particularly and let me tell you i'm not virtually
[1:54:56.540 --> 1:55:01.500]  signaling like i'm some bleeding heart all the africans i do care about them i care about me

[1:55:07.900 --> 1:55:14.780]  africans have this done to them because in africa people work their ass off they're not
[1:55:14.780 --> 1:55:19.260]  like spoiled american blacks or whites so i know a lot of africans from africa they see black
[1:55:19.260 --> 1:55:23.660]  americans i think you have no idea you got it you look a king compared to africa and here's here's
[1:55:23.660 --> 1:55:27.740]  the good news for everybody that didn't care about america you're going to learn because the globalists
[1:55:27.740 --> 1:55:32.860]  are going to take everything from you and you're going to be living like people in africa because
[1:55:32.860 --> 1:55:39.900]  we turned our back on christianity i don't blame him they took over the churches they did it ali
[1:55:39.900 --> 1:55:44.860]  alexander is a great political analyst i used to have him on years ago and he was a pretty good
[1:55:44.860 --> 1:55:51.100]  guest but he wasn't that hardcore now that he's gotten hardcore he's a great guest so we have
[1:55:51.100 --> 1:55:55.900]  him on quite a bit we appreciate his work he's a fellow texan losing ballas he's coming in
[1:55:57.340 --> 1:56:03.020]  and we've got another guest i was taking over jerry solente i'm gonna take 15 minutes of him so we
[1:56:03.020 --> 1:56:07.180]  have time to take calls greg reese at a special report we're gonna premiere that's very powerful
[1:56:09.100 --> 1:56:13.020]  and a lot more but i'm gonna go to bella and i'm gonna go to all these callers that are patiently
[1:56:13.020 --> 1:56:18.220]  holding who's been home the longest now that'd be bella in texas at atomic age bella you're on the
[1:56:18.220 --> 1:56:25.020]  year welcome alex as someone who escaped china and the ccp and came to america i bring an important
[1:56:25.020 --> 1:56:30.940]  message for liberty loving patriots around the world are you ready tell me all right so listen
[1:56:30.940 --> 1:56:35.980]  carefully i think the tragedy of a lost nation resulted from its people's tolerance of tyranny
[1:56:35.980 --> 1:56:41.580]  the people's inability to act and sacrificing liberty for security i was born in race and
[1:56:41.580 --> 1:56:46.700]  china so i know what most of you don't know out there i am witnessing every day how america is
[1:56:46.700 --> 1:56:52.140]  getting sicker and sicker from the infection of this spiritual virus and the spiritual virus wants
[1:56:52.140 --> 1:56:58.780]  to eat our soul you captivate our free will and spell out obedient sad little machine so that
[1:56:58.780 --> 1:57:04.460]  we can be pawns in their twisted deviant game of turning light into darkness and beating into ugly
[1:57:04.460 --> 1:57:09.180]  and wisdom into ignorance and the strong end of the week and everything humanity has ever fought
[1:57:09.180 --> 1:57:17.500]  into disparity but i think we cannot lose hope we can win and we can prevail even when globalists
[1:57:17.500 --> 1:57:23.020]  deadly they're deadly evil claws are clenching into the flesh and the soul of us so that's why
[1:57:23.020 --> 1:57:28.140]  i came all the way here to america from china i didn't come this far to only come this far and as
[1:57:28.140 --> 1:57:33.820]  a matter of fact it gives me heart-wrenching pain every day to sit by and watch info wars in danger
[1:57:33.820 --> 1:57:38.780]  my husband and i we own a marketing agency so we took action upon ourselves and we put together
[1:57:38.780 --> 1:57:44.220]  a plan for you alex to add at least 20 or 30 millions in annual recurring revenue and we can
[1:57:44.220 --> 1:57:48.540]  do it now before the election in the next no i remember everything i confused that a bunch of
[1:57:48.540 --> 1:57:52.860]  family crisis last week i talked to you guys about the white house press corps deal i know what you
[1:57:52.860 --> 1:57:58.140]  guys are doing and then something got lost in translation so let me do this okay tell the
[1:57:58.140 --> 1:58:01.740]  producer put them on hold and just give her my number okay i'll take care of it because because
[1:58:01.740 --> 1:58:05.260]  i think you're on fire then there was confusion about whether you were coming here to talk about
[1:58:05.260 --> 1:58:09.340]  a business thing or get you on here talk about china and i'd like to get you on about a guest
[1:58:09.340 --> 1:58:14.060]  about growing up in china and what that was like uh vice versa so so i remember that meaning
[1:58:14.060 --> 1:58:18.140]  i recognize your voice right when i heard it and i was saying to them i said i think that's that lady
[1:58:18.140 --> 1:58:21.500]  and what happened that they were talking to my ear so i missed part of what you said but i'm not
[1:58:21.500 --> 1:58:26.620]  going to blow you off and i got your info so we'll call you after the show yeah and you can hear
[1:58:26.620 --> 1:58:30.940]  that passion folks of a lady from china she's been there she's seen it and a guy from africa
[1:58:30.940 --> 1:58:37.260]  he's like man we're dying man people are starving to death they estimate eight million extra people
[1:58:37.260 --> 1:58:40.860]  and i think that's an accurate unnumber normally ten million starved out of the year extra eight
[1:58:40.860 --> 1:58:46.940]  million that's we're real little kids man i've seen documentaries in african places with little
[1:58:46.940 --> 1:58:53.820]  kids or begging for food and their parents dependency domestication in the real world
[1:58:53.820 --> 1:59:00.860]  ignorance is not bliss it's enslavement and it's death the globalists are teaching us all that
[1:59:00.860 --> 1:59:05.900]  we're non-essential with automation they're bringing in a world that doesn't power humanity
[1:59:05.900 --> 1:59:11.100]  but makes us obsolete but we're not obsolete we don't have to listen to them we can farm again we
[1:59:11.100 --> 1:59:15.900]  can garden we can become self-sufficient but first we've got to learn to stand up politically for
[1:59:15.900 --> 1:59:22.620]  ourselves and we need to become self-sufficient that begins with water filtration to take control
[1:59:22.620 --> 1:59:27.500]  of that from the globalists their fluoride and their dumbing down agenda and with storeable food
[1:59:27.500 --> 1:59:33.180]  and we have it all the highest quality the highest rated at the lowest prices at info war store.com
[1:59:33.180 --> 1:59:39.180]  take action now you cannot lose unless you do not take action we have the best water filtration
[1:59:39.180 --> 1:59:44.540]  the best storeable food and it funds the info war take action now while you still can become
[1:59:44.540 --> 1:59:55.580]  prepared become self-sufficient now at infowarstore.com the bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when
[1:59:55.580 --> 2:00:02.540]  the president gives the order it must be followed there's about four minutes between the order
[2:00:02.540 --> 2:00:09.500]  being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so as president i will
[2:00:09.500 --> 2:00:16.700]  make it clear that the united states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will
[2:00:16.700 --> 2:00:23.020]  be ready with serious political economic and military responses they're voting for peace on
[2:00:23.020 --> 2:00:30.780]  planet earth if they vote for trump but if they vote for hillary it's war we came we saw he died
[2:00:33.100 --> 2:00:38.060]  with her you'll end up in world war three i want the iranians to know that if i'm the president
[2:00:38.060 --> 2:00:44.300]  we will attack iran right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria would require
[2:00:44.300 --> 2:00:52.060]  us to go to war against syria and russia the u.s. military has just raised the threat level to
[2:00:52.060 --> 2:00:58.780]  def con too meanwhile hillary clinton is still threatening russia with military action following
[2:00:58.780 --> 2:01:04.220]  unconfirmed reports of further hacking it's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions
[2:01:04.220 --> 2:01:11.500]  of course not because she's really loud noise all right looks like we're having a little bit of
[2:01:11.500 --> 2:01:14.860]  technical difficulties we'll try to get lienne back on in a few minutes
[2:01:14.860 --> 2:01:31.340]  when the president gives the order it must be followed
[2:01:45.660 --> 2:01:50.300]  November 8th vote like your life depends on it
[2:01:52.060 --> 2:01:56.860]  well that's an ad we put out four years ago that got about 50 million views on facebook and youtube
[2:01:58.140 --> 2:02:02.460]  it's kind of a remake of the 1960s video where they said to be voted for goldwater and cause nuclear
[2:02:02.460 --> 2:02:10.060]  war which wasn't true but with the case with hillary it was absolutely definitely true ladies and
[2:02:10.060 --> 2:02:17.500]  gentlemen so again thank you so much for joining us ollie alexander is here riding shotgun with us
[2:02:18.300 --> 2:02:22.460]  about 15 minutes into the next hour then for three segments we're gonna have the great
[2:02:23.180 --> 2:02:28.140]  trans forecast for gel salante taken over but i wanted to focus not just on america because you
[2:02:28.140 --> 2:02:33.420]  know the united states of any free country has the lowest level of passports um you'll Europeans
[2:02:33.420 --> 2:02:37.580]  like 70 percent have passports last time i checked less than half of americans have passports
[2:02:37.580 --> 2:02:42.300]  we're a great country and i love america i've been all over it you know that song i've been
[2:02:42.300 --> 2:02:49.740]  everywhere man absolutely so go ahead and turn ollie's mic on for me so so so so all of this
[2:02:49.740 --> 2:02:56.620]  is going on but if you look at trump and getting 99 percent of the troops out of afghanistan 95
[2:02:56.620 --> 2:03:01.100]  percent of the troops out of syria a few little bases but it's a major cutback getting all these
[2:03:01.100 --> 2:03:07.500]  pistols done with serbia and bosnia and and peace deals with with with saudi arabia and israel and ua
[2:03:07.500 --> 2:03:14.380]  this is a big big deal and it's really unprecedented ollie alexander is a great political analyst
[2:03:14.380 --> 2:03:20.940]  filmmaker and writer what do you make of this time the man's a peacemaker he's had a vision
[2:03:20.940 --> 2:03:27.020]  of what american exceptionalism should look like he rebranded that as make america great so american
[2:03:27.020 --> 2:03:34.540]  greatness and he said every arena i touch i want us to be at our apex and so he's brought peace
[2:03:34.540 --> 2:03:40.620]  everywhere he's gone he's made our allies uh better stakeholders he's made our enemies actual
[2:03:40.620 --> 2:03:45.100]  stakeholders and the man's brought peace so i think he's a peacemaker and i think he's getting
[2:03:45.100 --> 2:03:50.380]  blessed for it because man this guy will blunder around towards success you can only say that
[2:03:50.380 --> 2:03:57.180]  god's rewarding him blessed are the peacemakers blessed are the peacemakers now the issue is
[2:03:57.180 --> 2:04:00.620]  trump wants economic supremacy where everybody does well that's what he went to kim jong-un
[2:04:00.620 --> 2:04:06.060]  when he said listen you have beautiful real estate between china japan and south korea three of the
[2:04:06.060 --> 2:04:11.820]  richest countries in the world stop it get out of 1950 and you know and and and and what happened
[2:04:11.820 --> 2:04:17.980]  with the korean war and just come into the sunshine you can own all of it your people will be fat like
[2:04:17.980 --> 2:04:23.500]  you and china controls north korea and won't let him do it it's exactly right you know i was on a
[2:04:23.500 --> 2:04:29.020]  friend uh i was on the phone with a friend and i think 2017 2018 he worked at wall street did some
[2:04:29.020 --> 2:04:34.300]  of the top firms now he's kind of doing his own thing and what he told me is that these economic
[2:04:34.300 --> 2:04:39.020]  bombs are more powerful than any other bombs and it's not going to create the blowback so a lot of
[2:04:39.020 --> 2:04:45.580]  people don't realize that when china finally came crawling to the table it was because their economy
[2:04:45.580 --> 2:04:53.820]  was 32 down their stock market was 32 down when canada finally signed this new nazda deal it was
[2:04:53.820 --> 2:04:59.180]  because their stock market was 32 down so people really need to understand that the american stock
[2:04:59.180 --> 2:05:05.820]  market was up 40 while theirs were down 32 33 34 percent and it brought them to the table all
[2:05:05.820 --> 2:05:10.060]  without killing any citizens and now i'm going to lay something really heavy on everybody but
[2:05:10.060 --> 2:05:15.740]  everybody knows it's already true so the deep state those invested in the next century being the
[2:05:15.740 --> 2:05:21.180]  chinese communist century the cfr crowd they packaged the covid they allowed the release they
[2:05:21.180 --> 2:05:25.340]  allowed the hype they allowed the demonization which they now blame on trump in america they
[2:05:25.340 --> 2:05:30.380]  called the trump virus on the chinese virus this was their counter strike and guess what it's messed
[2:05:30.380 --> 2:05:34.940]  things up it's been terrible it's starving the third world to death but it's not going well
[2:05:34.940 --> 2:05:40.060]  people are waking up fast trump's not going along with it he's exposing it and so this was
[2:05:40.060 --> 2:05:44.780]  a something they had on the shelf for later to bring in world government they used this weapon
[2:05:44.780 --> 2:05:50.860]  of of the pandemic hysteria early uh and so this is a this is a serious serious blow to them things
[2:05:50.860 --> 2:05:54.860]  are not going well for the new world war they're not going well for the new world order look we
[2:05:54.860 --> 2:05:59.580]  don't have to agree or disagree on the origin of the virus but you know i agree with you alex but
[2:05:59.580 --> 2:06:04.460]  what people need to understand is hasn't the response been mismanaged our government has
[2:06:04.460 --> 2:06:11.180]  had a schizophrenic response on mass on vaccines on quarantine so they're actually house arrest
[2:06:11.180 --> 2:06:16.300]  ignore deaths in blue states hype up small deaths in red state right kill people at the nursing
[2:06:16.300 --> 2:06:20.700]  homes these are trump voters by the way you know this is really really interesting so what we have
[2:06:20.700 --> 2:06:25.820]  to say is that well why is amazon benefiting from benefiting from this why is uber and uber
[2:06:25.820 --> 2:06:30.860]  eats benefiting from all the big tech constellation pharma big tech why do they want to censor what
[2:06:30.860 --> 2:06:36.140]  we say why are bureaucrats in charge and not elected officials this only benefits one side
[2:06:36.140 --> 2:06:40.700]  and these are the globalists this is you trust has been a giant un power grab and all the big
[2:06:40.700 --> 2:06:45.660]  tech's gotten rich while we go bankrupt absolutely absolutely true and trumps trying to restart our
[2:06:45.660 --> 2:06:50.860]  local economy and trying to block it right and so right now we're in this persuasion war where
[2:06:50.860 --> 2:06:55.500]  you know it's almost like wizards are fighting and they all know that if trump gets a second term
[2:06:55.500 --> 2:07:00.620]  fouchy's not in the driver's seat anymore you know he's not in the driver's seat anymore our elected
[2:07:00.620 --> 2:07:05.820]  officials are and that's the social contract that americans have with our constitution and with our
[2:07:05.820 --> 2:07:10.780]  elected leaders they are so desperate right now we're and we're going to get into uh rpg or
[2:07:10.780 --> 2:07:16.620]  whatever ruthbitter ginsberg yeah the rpg at america's heart rpg i know folks but we're going
[2:07:16.620 --> 2:07:22.380]  to look at all of it and the craziness obviously this campaign was already at 11 where does it go
[2:07:22.380 --> 2:07:28.140]  now alex i i think it goes to the max i really you know i i've talked to you privately i've
[2:07:28.140 --> 2:07:34.380]  talked to other friends you know we are high value targets and we've got to be very very careful
[2:07:34.380 --> 2:07:40.860]  what what what we do what we say where we are because the left is absolutely feral all these
[2:07:40.860 --> 2:07:45.660]  books that you've read lord of the flies the left is like these children walking around with little
[2:07:45.660 --> 2:07:51.180]  takies and little spears and they want to physically hurt us because they're losing think about this
[2:07:51.180 --> 2:07:56.220]  alex they have 95 percent of the institutional power they have the colleges they have the tv
[2:07:56.220 --> 2:08:01.020]  they have hollywood they have the corporations they have all of the commerce they check and
[2:08:01.020 --> 2:08:07.180]  they've closed our churches they control radical islam they've got they've got everything everything
[2:08:07.180 --> 2:08:13.500]  and they're still fighting with us they're still losing half of the public so just think we have
[2:08:13.500 --> 2:08:19.420]  a real chance and a real shot at resetting america so you know just just watch out for some of these
[2:08:19.420 --> 2:08:22.540]  lone wolves on the left that i'm worried about false flags let's talk about they're gonna pull
[2:08:22.540 --> 2:08:26.860]  next but let's get into this the average leftist because they keep arresting antifa it'll be like
[2:08:26.860 --> 2:08:34.140]  a major legislative aid a congressional high-level aid they're literally these rich kids mainly white
[2:08:34.780 --> 2:08:39.420]  out trying to incite minorities to attack things that's in their own documents yep and they're
[2:08:39.420 --> 2:08:44.700]  the establishment all the big billionaires are formed except trump china's forum all the money
[2:08:44.700 --> 2:08:49.500]  and then they act like they're the underdog like you said the whole power structure is against us
[2:08:49.500 --> 2:08:55.500]  and the people get that it's totally inverted it's satanic it's inverted and what they want to do is
[2:08:55.500 --> 2:08:59.580]  they want to appeal this is the thing alex people need to understand what they want to do is they
[2:08:59.580 --> 2:09:05.340]  want to appeal to our side they want to appeal to the suburban housewife that says well i want lower
[2:09:05.340 --> 2:09:10.700]  taxes and i don't want my federal tax money to abort babies uh you know there's a grievance a
[2:09:10.700 --> 2:09:14.940]  generational grievance that we can cure so maybe i'll vote democrat this time that's what this appeal
[2:09:14.940 --> 2:09:20.540]  is they're saying appease us give in be for black people so the mom goes i am soros isn't black people
[2:09:20.540 --> 2:09:24.860]  right they're not for black people so this is what you have alex exactly what you described
[2:09:24.860 --> 2:09:29.900]  you have rich white kids people working for da people working as legislative aids as you mentioned
[2:09:29.900 --> 2:09:35.820]  it's it's it's from organ in new york and then they're draining up black faces to get to white vote
[2:09:35.820 --> 2:09:41.100]  it's really creepy that's exactly what the attorney general said because they know that we're done with
[2:09:41.100 --> 2:09:47.260]  soros oh now soros has literally a little black puppet he uses but it's still soros's hand the
[2:09:47.260 --> 2:09:53.420]  planets have aligned globally they've aligned nationally they've aligned financially culturally
[2:09:53.420 --> 2:10:00.380]  but most importantly spiritually we are living at a point in human development that's beside
[2:10:00.380 --> 2:10:06.380]  the entire future destiny of our species so that's why big tech control but the very dark forces of
[2:10:06.380 --> 2:10:13.820]  the globalist is trying to dumb us down isolate us make us depressed make us alone and try to control
[2:10:13.820 --> 2:10:19.020]  every aspect of our lives literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward because
[2:10:19.020 --> 2:10:25.180]  they do not want us to take our birthright not just of americana but of true christendom and the
[2:10:25.180 --> 2:10:30.780]  renaissance and the enlightenment they are trying to create the new dark age where they have all
[2:10:30.780 --> 2:10:36.540]  the high technology and life extension and we are walled off in a technocracy that controls us
[2:10:36.540 --> 2:10:42.940]  through carbon credits and through a social credit score this is their plan we must come together
[2:10:42.940 --> 2:10:49.340]  and awaken out of our trance and say no we must embrace god real power comes from the grassroots
[2:10:50.060 --> 2:10:54.700]  and real power comes from experience and i've been the fight more than 26 years against the
[2:10:54.700 --> 2:10:59.100]  globalist so it's important for listeners and viewers to understand when you support info wars
[2:10:59.100 --> 2:11:03.500]  that keep us on the air you're not supporting a news outlet that has sources and so we're able to
[2:11:03.500 --> 2:11:09.180]  always tell you what's coming when others can't it's because we are studying the enemy and doing
[2:11:09.180 --> 2:11:14.780]  the original analysis that gets picked up by trump intelligence agencies and major corporations that
[2:11:14.780 --> 2:11:19.100]  are part of the resistance that are part of the resistance to the overarching globalist system
[2:11:19.100 --> 2:11:24.780]  so i have to tell you how the hierarchy works in many cases info wars is at the head we're not the
[2:11:24.780 --> 2:11:30.460]  tail that means you're at the head and that's why your support of us is so critical biden and his
[2:11:30.460 --> 2:11:35.020]  constellation of criminals have told us and many others that if they get elected they're not just
[2:11:35.020 --> 2:11:38.780]  going to shut down info wars they're going to shut you down the long depression forced
[2:11:38.780 --> 2:11:43.340]  inoculations and more so now more than ever keep info wars on the air with high quality products
[2:11:43.340 --> 2:11:52.060]  and info wars store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:05.100 --> 2:12:05.980]  bill by death

[2:12:23.020 --> 2:12:28.460]  this little constellation of articles that all tie together jimmy kimmel gets forced to recite
[2:12:28.460 --> 2:12:35.660]  black lives matter on stage and image it's empty they have canned applause it's so alien it's so
[2:12:35.660 --> 2:12:40.780]  weird lady gaga says when you're born in this country we all drink the poison that's white
[2:12:40.780 --> 2:12:46.140]  supremacy she's literally saying whites are bad people had this guy got killed protecting his
[2:12:46.140 --> 2:12:49.980]  bar up in minnesota they charge you in murder he committed suicide the state senator said good
[2:12:49.980 --> 2:12:55.900]  he's a white supremacist the guy wasn't i mean just defaming dead people gg pink government
[2:12:55.900 --> 2:13:02.140]  confirms huge birth rate drop but denies forced sterilization of women so they're forcibly on
[2:13:02.140 --> 2:13:06.780]  record sterilizing the muslim women their birth rates gone down by what two-thirds
[2:13:08.060 --> 2:13:11.900]  these are not expansionist bad muslims in my view they're not like al-qaeda
[2:13:11.900 --> 2:13:15.980]  you got a million christians and buddhas in there as well but three million and the left
[2:13:15.980 --> 2:13:23.100]  will say nothing ilhan omar is in the new york times saying i am by nature a starter of fires
[2:13:24.060 --> 2:13:28.620]  well wait facebook says the left never starts fires my work has been to figure out where i'm
[2:13:28.620 --> 2:13:37.180]  going to burn down everything around me by adding the fuel of my religion skin color gender or even
[2:13:37.180 --> 2:13:44.940]  tone she's quoted the new york times i'm gonna burn you down while china has killed 115 million
[2:13:44.940 --> 2:13:49.100]  of its own people it's killing millions of muslims and she's not gonna say a damn word
[2:13:49.100 --> 2:13:54.380]  because they butter her bun baby we save her out of samalia you know they saved her family yeah
[2:13:54.380 --> 2:13:59.900]  bring her over here and she freaking hates this place because of a chip on her shoulder i i don't
[2:13:59.900 --> 2:14:04.060]  i don't know what the but again this is not all people from africa or all samalis but
[2:14:04.060 --> 2:14:08.700]  no when soros cherry picked this lady he did it for a reason what is her problem
[2:14:09.580 --> 2:14:15.420]  she hates us she wants to remake us it's the great inversion this is the time that we were called
[2:14:15.420 --> 2:14:19.340]  to fight in alex that's why i'm on your show that's why your audience is growing that's why
[2:14:19.340 --> 2:14:24.540]  they're fighting the big tech sensors what we need to remember is that the same nonsense about white
[2:14:24.540 --> 2:14:31.260]  supremacy okay look uh uh uh white racism is not an epidemic right now it's not a problem america
[2:14:31.260 --> 2:14:38.220]  fixed that problem but what we have is the regimes in iran and china hijacked the same
[2:14:38.220 --> 2:14:43.980]  talking point so what we need to ask is why is china and why is iran using the same talking
[2:14:43.980 --> 2:14:50.220]  points as the squad because they seek to undermine us this is what the marxists did during the 1960s
[2:14:50.220 --> 2:14:55.340]  when they were trying to co-opt the civil rights movement this is why martin Luther king jr rejected
[2:14:55.340 --> 2:15:00.780]  marxism and embraced his full christianity and that was a great cure to the nation of islam and
[2:15:00.780 --> 2:15:08.780]  the black panthers and etc etc so ilhan omar is here to invert america and incite a civil war let
[2:15:08.780 --> 2:15:14.300]  there be no doubt about it oh yeah the black guy that went in and shot two white people on a black
[2:15:14.300 --> 2:15:20.220]  guy to death because it was a cop bar um turned out none of them were cops oh no was so proud of
[2:15:20.220 --> 2:15:24.460]  himself he's quoted as saying well i did it for basically malcolm x malcolm x said he was wrong
[2:15:24.460 --> 2:15:28.700]  at the end that's what he he renounced he renounced it and said that mlk was right because he traveled
[2:15:28.700 --> 2:15:32.540]  around the world right and not only did he travel around the world i don't want to just talk about
[2:15:32.540 --> 2:15:41.020]  ideology malcolm x knew he was wrong but then he saw the fruits that mlk jr bore and you know the
[2:15:41.020 --> 2:15:46.700]  bible tells us you will know them by their fruits and mlk or malcolm x had kind of a come to jesus
[2:15:46.700 --> 2:15:52.860]  moment minus the jesus part and said oh my gosh i was not only ideologically wrong but i did not
[2:15:52.860 --> 2:15:59.180]  achieve any wins from my people this guy at atlanta did and so we can't forget that and these people
[2:15:59.180 --> 2:16:03.660]  they don't care about reason they don't yeah because king was following christ and gondi right
[2:16:03.660 --> 2:16:09.580]  i mean he knew it was effective right and it worked and he he he got he got the public on his side
[2:16:09.580 --> 2:16:13.980]  and then he moved for legislation well that's a big criticism trumps getting not cracking heads of
[2:16:13.980 --> 2:16:18.460]  antibn blm right and at a certain level you need to right but at a certain level if he goes in that
[2:16:18.460 --> 2:16:22.940]  makes them the martyrs they're doing an igie prop and i was watching your show the other day look
[2:16:22.940 --> 2:16:27.740]  you get this i get this trump gets this but we can't expect all of america who's busy with their
[2:16:27.740 --> 2:16:33.100]  nine to five to get this entirely this is a delicate balance between contrast getting your
[2:16:33.100 --> 2:16:37.980]  opponent to show who they are and making peace with them accepting them as opponents and not
[2:16:37.980 --> 2:16:43.340]  enemies when you can and so this is a delicate equation that donald trump is balancing we're
[2:16:43.340 --> 2:16:49.020]  trying to balance it but the other side just wants to gaslight us to hell and a civil war we can't
[2:16:49.020 --> 2:16:52.460]  agree with you when i talked to you the other day you didn't even know i've done it you know coming
[2:16:52.460 --> 2:16:56.860]  out playing ding dong witches and i didn't have fun because they over reverent her and worship
[2:16:56.860 --> 2:17:00.700]  ruth bettergensburg that was this big baby killer but i don't think she thought she was even wrong
[2:17:00.700 --> 2:17:04.620]  at the end of the day compared like a you know bill clinton she's probably not that evil i mean i
[2:17:04.620 --> 2:17:10.060]  don't revel in her death right but trump coming out and classily saying nice things about her
[2:17:10.060 --> 2:17:15.020]  that she was a very extraordinary person is very successful at that level that disarmed them that
[2:17:15.020 --> 2:17:21.180]  disarm and so that's the next level they are alex have you see they are triggered by him paying her
[2:17:21.180 --> 2:17:25.580]  a compliment in the wake of her death i've never i don't know if i don't say i've never seen anything
[2:17:25.580 --> 2:17:30.700]  like it but it's kind of eerie they're like this isn't true this isn't when he first found out uh he
[2:17:30.700 --> 2:17:35.100]  doesn't wish her well look what he said before and i was like he's wishing her well y'all should take
[2:17:35.100 --> 2:17:39.500]  this as a supposed a perfect statement in fact get that cute of the next segment the music in the
[2:17:39.500 --> 2:17:43.900]  background it was all real just like the ukraine phone call it was a perfect statement perfect
[2:17:43.900 --> 2:17:47.260]  phone he's like listen if you disagree with her she was accomplished and you know we're you know
[2:17:47.260 --> 2:17:51.180]  she was an amazing person yeah that's a i mean hitler was amazing i don't agree with him i mean
[2:17:51.180 --> 2:17:56.140]  he did amazing things quantifiably on a magnitude you're talking about an order of magnitude yes
[2:17:56.140 --> 2:18:01.580]  they were influential they were great in terms of of of you know the quantification of it not the
[2:18:01.580 --> 2:18:06.140]  qualification of it and and that's what people need to understand let me just say this all the western
[2:18:06.140 --> 2:18:10.780]  states past women's suffrage 30 years before it happened in the east nothing against the east
[2:18:10.780 --> 2:18:14.860]  but everybody thinks of the west and the central areas hillbilly we knew the women knew how to run
[2:18:14.860 --> 2:18:18.860]  stuff and were with us and smart so of course the western states were my course women can vote
[2:18:18.860 --> 2:18:23.420]  because they were right there doing it skinning bucks running trot lines it was some of the people
[2:18:23.420 --> 2:18:26.860]  from other areas of the world that hadn't been free that were voting on the east coast that said
[2:18:26.860 --> 2:18:31.740]  we're not letting women out of their boxes so again it was america that women got the vote so we
[2:18:31.740 --> 2:18:35.740]  don't become the bad guys in the world because we're the first to end slavery or the first to get
[2:18:35.740 --> 2:18:41.580]  women to vote we should be celebrating that we did that and then have women adopt americana because
[2:18:41.580 --> 2:18:46.780]  it's what empowered them not adopt islam and sharia law how do they get feminist to endorse
[2:18:46.780 --> 2:18:51.660]  sharia law and the beekeeper suits preach it because what they do is they engage in this grand
[2:18:51.660 --> 2:18:59.580]  illusion that you can compare us to who to whom i mean ask a leftist that okay america sucks compared
[2:18:59.580 --> 2:19:05.340]  to what compared to whom and what you'll find is they don't know that some of these people
[2:19:05.340 --> 2:19:09.820]  are still crapping in holes that these are you don't know slavery still going on in latin america
[2:19:09.820 --> 2:19:15.740]  they still call china latin america you know if you're a black man traveling this world you'll
[2:19:15.740 --> 2:19:21.340]  find out real quick how racist it is in china real quick how segregated it is in latin america
[2:19:21.340 --> 2:19:26.460]  and in south america and how even europeans will treat you in what rooms they'll give you in a hostel
[2:19:26.460 --> 2:19:32.380]  so america is we're just heads up above everybody it's crazy they don't want us to compare it and
[2:19:32.380 --> 2:19:36.220]  that's why you're talking about the passport issue these leftists think they're educated they've never
[2:19:36.220 --> 2:19:43.900]  traveled they've never done anything ollie we're gonna go to break the minute we have we know
[2:19:43.900 --> 2:19:48.220]  that when trump wins they're gonna contest it yes they're saying that yeah how do you see that fiasco
[2:19:48.220 --> 2:19:54.300]  going uh it's it's gonna go very bad i it if if there's an option on the table alex they're
[2:19:54.300 --> 2:20:00.220]  they're gonna pull the trigger and hopefully that's just figurative uh but you know governors are
[2:20:00.220 --> 2:20:05.100]  going to intervene secretaries the states are gonna intervene major counties are not gonna
[2:20:05.100 --> 2:20:10.700]  turn in their reports they're gonna try to stall the electoral they said the plan is to disrupt it
[2:20:10.700 --> 2:20:15.740]  to then contest it right disrupt contest so when their stated plan is disrupt contest
[2:20:15.740 --> 2:20:19.180]  because they know they're losing well they're disqualified right if they know that they're
[2:20:19.180 --> 2:20:22.140]  about to get into checkmate they're just gonna flip the whole board over
[2:20:25.820 --> 2:20:30.620]  you're damn right ollie alexander is on fire so is this audience amazing people
[2:20:30.620 --> 2:20:34.940]  we're gonna play some clips of china threatening to blow the us up and take your phone calls

[2:21:57.660 --> 2:22:05.980]  estimated that 200 million people have died 200 million people have died probably by the time i
[2:22:05.980 --> 2:22:11.980]  finished this talk right after joe biden made that statement that more than 60 of america has
[2:22:11.980 --> 2:22:17.500]  died from covet nineteen when it's not even 200 000 reality he would want to say six million have
[2:22:17.500 --> 2:22:21.980]  lung scarring and heart damage it's all made up but you know where he got it the mainstream media
[2:22:21.980 --> 2:22:27.980]  that continues to actually say things like that they said that four percent of america would be
[2:22:27.980 --> 2:22:33.660]  dead already of course it's a point zero zero zero zero and then add a number because the numbers
[2:22:33.660 --> 2:22:40.380]  vary it's a real virus just like people being struck by lightning is real but to shut down

[2:25:57.660 --> 2:26:03.740]  because i need to pay the bills pay him folks we say you should take vitamin d3 and now fouchy
[2:26:03.740 --> 2:26:08.940]  agrees so you know he's like god so it's okay for you if you have vitamin d3 if you have zinc
[2:26:08.940 --> 2:26:13.420]  if you have good organic c then that's available everywhere so we don't really sell stuff with
[2:26:13.420 --> 2:26:19.100]  c in it so the multivitamins we have have it then you're taken care of your your your cells are
[2:26:19.100 --> 2:26:25.980]  fortified but not for covid for any virus ladies and gentlemen for anything and they want you dumb
[2:26:25.980 --> 2:26:31.020]  they raid medical doctors the fbi do that prescribe vitamin c as a preventative to their people
[2:26:31.020 --> 2:26:36.780]  and advertise for covid but but now fouchy the god said it so much must be true what kind of
[2:26:36.780 --> 2:26:41.660]  country do we live in go to the NIH website if you don't have d3 if you don't have c if you
[2:26:41.660 --> 2:26:46.860]  don't have zinc you will die so it's that simple you can get it from natural foods we have it
[2:26:46.860 --> 2:26:51.820]  concentrated we have it high quality we have the amazing and it's selling out but i've still got it

[2:27:54.060 --> 2:28:00.380]  chance and if they get in we've already been told that we will be shut down and people say well
[2:28:00.380 --> 2:28:04.140]  then tell us well no when i have a private meeting with somebody unless what they're doing is criminal
[2:28:04.140 --> 2:28:09.900]  i'm not gonna violate the agreement okay but i mean we've met with the enemy i've done it
[2:28:09.900 --> 2:28:14.140]  bungee the last couple years that's just how this works what do you think they sue us is to open up
[2:28:14.140 --> 2:28:17.980]  those avenues of discussion and so we've been up the top of those buildings and been offered the

[2:29:25.660 --> 2:29:31.580]  and unlike most of your viewers i've been on 30 flights during this pandemic i've been to six
[2:29:31.580 --> 2:29:37.740]  or seven different states i don't have coveted and i was with 700 people on friday outside of
[2:29:37.740 --> 2:29:42.860]  chicago i don't have coveted so you know it really ticked me off it was february or march
[2:29:42.860 --> 2:29:48.300]  who came out and they said you can't boost your immune system are you crazy and then now fouchy
[2:29:48.300 --> 2:29:52.780]  just came out like you said last week and he's like oh yeah i happen to take vitamin c and d3
[2:29:52.780 --> 2:29:58.700]  and zinc every every day and i'm just like you know us ob you know you owe this public disclosure
[2:29:58.700 --> 2:30:03.100]  to the people so i mean i oh i got so mad they should have said that eight months ago but said
[2:30:03.100 --> 2:30:08.540]  they'd say there's nothing to prevent it there's nothing to he would say that they said quote you
[2:30:08.540 --> 2:30:14.460]  cannot boost quote in quote your immune system and i'm like you can make yourself healthier what are
[2:30:14.460 --> 2:30:19.820]  you guys talking about and your body needs to work to fight these things well i showed the
[2:30:19.820 --> 2:30:25.180]  NIH website where it said if you don't have zinc d3 and see you will die yeah that's how viruses
[2:30:25.180 --> 2:30:30.860]  replicate in the cell but look at this this is just today cdc says it erroneously posted guidance
[2:30:30.860 --> 2:30:35.500]  that said coronavirus spreads to the air and travels beyond six feet everybody knows it travels
[2:30:35.500 --> 2:30:41.980]  to 20 something feet everybody knows that the cold viruses do that but but but c o update cdc
[2:30:41.980 --> 2:30:46.060]  guidance acknowledges coronavirus and spreads of the air the point is they're wrong they're right
[2:30:46.060 --> 2:30:50.540]  we have a right to say what we think they have a right since when can we not question the appeal
[2:30:50.540 --> 2:30:56.540]  isn't to the scientific method it's not to reason it's not to logic it's purely to authority if you
[2:30:56.540 --> 2:31:02.460]  see this logo in this stamp listen to us at this moment and not a moment more and not a moment before
[2:31:02.460 --> 2:31:06.540]  again most people that die in the world of starvation it's not listed as that on their
[2:31:06.540 --> 2:31:13.020]  toe tag right malnutrition right you get malnourished you get skinny you die it's insane alex and i'm
[2:31:13.020 --> 2:31:16.540]  glad that we're equipping people with the information i want to go calls next segment i promise we
[2:31:16.540 --> 2:31:21.020]  will's we're gonna go to the next hour yeah holly alex hander but uh getting back to all of this
[2:31:21.020 --> 2:31:27.020]  what curve balls you expect the the cra what's the craze left gonna do yeah we gotta watch our backs
[2:31:27.020 --> 2:31:32.940]  we know that right what about false flags what about uh they're working on one right now i got the
[2:31:32.940 --> 2:31:36.860]  i think there was a day i think there was a daily beast hit piece on me friday i'm not really sure
[2:31:36.860 --> 2:31:42.540]  this reporter asked me i'm doing the stop the steel thing again that i did in 2018 which saved
[2:31:42.540 --> 2:31:46.700]  the us senate seat for rick scott yeah you led that there did a great job right and we even
[2:31:46.700 --> 2:31:51.260]  did one of our exclusive interviews uh you know with with harrison so we have that from 2018
[2:31:51.260 --> 2:31:55.820]  and we're putting that out in a trailer and all that but what's happening is this daily beast
[2:31:55.820 --> 2:32:00.700]  reporter said well aren't aren't you encouraging violence by telling people to protest their
[2:32:00.700 --> 2:32:05.340]  board of elections and i was like did you miss this whole blm thing and then what's funny is rg
[2:32:05.340 --> 2:32:10.860]  well not funny but rbg dies and then people like take to the streets take to the supreme court don't
[2:32:10.860 --> 2:32:15.100]  let the us senate meet prevent a quorum and all this other stuff and i'm like well where's the
[2:32:15.100 --> 2:32:19.100]  article about violence on what they're doing and the tweets are still up twitter or how you're not
[2:32:19.100 --> 2:32:23.980]  supposed to go outside yeah like oh trump can't have an rbg yeah yeah it's like if you like the
[2:32:23.980 --> 2:32:29.340]  american flag if you see the anthem if you say the pledge then magically you cannot peacefully
[2:32:29.340 --> 2:32:34.620]  protest you can't exercise your first amendment right but if you're a leftist if you hate this
[2:32:34.620 --> 2:32:40.620]  country if you want a borderless world and fake vitamins then you know then you can protest and
[2:32:40.620 --> 2:32:44.860]  magically you're actually going to build an immunity to these the well here's what's crazy
[2:32:44.860 --> 2:32:49.260]  they ran headlines everywhere alex shown says the cure to coronavirus i was saying i thought it was
[2:32:49.260 --> 2:32:55.340]  weak back then and but i was saying we already have products forever that have zinc and d3 and it's
[2:32:55.340 --> 2:33:00.220]  what my unhealthy but takes that a lot of things that aren't good for me i work too much all that
[2:33:00.220 --> 2:33:04.460]  stuff drink too much yeah and i mean i was always selling the same product saying the same thing
[2:33:04.460 --> 2:33:08.220]  right it's not like you change your product line or rebranded them you know but that that that
[2:33:08.220 --> 2:33:13.820]  we didn't say covid this and that but but then leticia james put in my sorrows she came out and
[2:33:13.820 --> 2:33:18.860]  said jones says he has cures and all of a sudden it was in hundreds of newspapers all these sales
[2:33:18.860 --> 2:33:25.500]  happened liars of people thinking i had the cure because she said it they're liars they're thieves
[2:33:25.500 --> 2:33:30.460]  they're harlots they're jez bells and as kanye says the jez bells don't even stand a chance so i
[2:33:30.460 --> 2:33:34.540]  think they should just keep coming at us because people are getting curious and they want the
[2:33:34.540 --> 2:33:39.020]  truth well that's the next thing qualmo's writing a book where he's a hero at the nursing homes when
[2:33:39.020 --> 2:33:45.660]  he killed all those people genocide genocide well they're out backstage with us i don't want to be
[2:33:45.660 --> 2:33:51.500]  negative about the prospects of the election but i need to be honest with everybody the democrats
[2:33:51.500 --> 2:33:56.380]  and their deep state controllers commerce chinese have come out and said they're going to contest
[2:33:56.380 --> 2:34:00.780]  the election they know that trump's gonna win a landslide and the destabilization that that's
[2:34:00.780 --> 2:34:06.380]  gonna cause is going to further destroy the markets and the economy and going into the future even
[2:34:06.380 --> 2:34:12.220]  if trump is able to prove that he's won the election the democrats have said they're going to break away
[2:34:13.340 --> 2:34:19.180]  politically and culturally into the blue states and blue cities and basically use that as a pretext
[2:34:19.180 --> 2:34:26.940]  sabotage the republic even more so until this cancer is rooted out until these criminals that
[2:34:26.940 --> 2:34:31.340]  work with foreign governments that are trying to basically destroy the country are punished
[2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:35.740]  and removed it's just going to continue to happen and so that's the big problem here
[2:34:36.300 --> 2:34:41.420]  is that we have a stemming dug in corruption by people that hate the country's very existence
[2:34:44.140 --> 2:34:49.340]  servants of state are working around the clock to silence the people of not just the united states
[2:34:49.340 --> 2:34:54.540]  but of the world because there is a great awakening taking place everyone i talk to everywhere i go
[2:34:54.540 --> 2:35:00.380]  so people that weren't even religious or spiritual now understand this fight between good and evil
[2:35:00.940 --> 2:35:06.700]  and they're finding christ and they're finding the prophecies that aren't like nostradamus they
[2:35:06.700 --> 2:35:13.580]  but are very very detailed extremely specific that are now coming through at a frightening rate
[2:35:14.380 --> 2:35:19.660]  frightening because so many people are still living under the control of the god of this world
[2:35:19.660 --> 2:35:27.420]  satan did not realize that their immortal souls are in grave danger do not fear he who can kill the
[2:35:27.420 --> 2:35:34.140]  body fear he who can kill the soul as the good book warns us i'm alex jones and i'm very honored to
[2:35:34.140 --> 2:35:38.700]  be on air still during this time every day we're still on air as a blessing so please pray for
[2:35:38.700 --> 2:35:46.140]  info wars pray for yourself pray for the children pray for the world god bless you all remember
[2:35:46.140 --> 2:35:52.700]  the enemy is working around the clock to suppress voices of independent people all over the world
[2:35:53.660 --> 2:36:01.580]  the globalist have a plan for total vertical integration absolute authoritarianism to where
[2:36:01.580 --> 2:36:09.660]  you are a captive of their devices of their control but that is only a means to an end
[2:36:10.540 --> 2:36:15.500]  once they have the electronic straightjacket in place they are on record that they will bring in
[2:36:15.500 --> 2:36:21.900]  force inoculations that sterilize you and your family and worse many but the vaccine is being
[2:36:21.900 --> 2:36:28.220]  pushed by the united nations actually give people polio and actually give people cancer most cancer
[2:36:28.220 --> 2:36:34.700]  is viral that's a big secret but the secret is beginning to come out it's even in the associated
[2:36:34.700 --> 2:36:42.140]  press remember all of these banned videos and reports are banned on video but only you can share
[2:36:42.140 --> 2:36:47.500]  them and save humanity i've got some bad news for you that i got some really bad news and i've got
[2:36:47.500 --> 2:36:53.340]  some good news the bad news is even if trump gets reelected they're gonna still trigger
[2:36:53.340 --> 2:36:58.220]  attempts at martial law medical lockdowns race riots and a depression that's the globalist
[2:36:58.220 --> 2:37:03.660]  they're trying to bring america to our knees now if trump doesn't get elected they're still
[2:37:03.660 --> 2:37:08.220]  planning to bring us to our knees and really try to break our will and bring us into a super intense
[2:37:08.220 --> 2:37:13.100]  depression total control and like australia is already doing rounding up and arresting people
[2:37:13.100 --> 2:37:18.460]  that criticize what the left are doing that's the really bad news the good news is this has
[2:37:18.460 --> 2:37:22.540]  triggered people out of their sleep all over the world and the resistance is mounting and the
[2:37:22.540 --> 2:37:28.460]  globalist are panicking so bottom line we're in the fight we're starting to win but it's serious
[2:37:28.460 --> 2:37:33.260]  so pray to god for a global awakening support info war spread the word and buy products at

[2:39:27.580 --> 2:39:33.100]  distraction because they're getting americans distracted with everything going on with antifa
[2:39:33.100 --> 2:39:39.580]  with blm with the covid scam and everybody's so flustered and just looking in so many directions
[2:39:39.580 --> 2:39:44.860]  they're just easing that plan in and what well when you look how soft and weak the average people are
[2:39:44.860 --> 2:39:48.940]  i don't feel powerful and i see that i feel weak the globalists feel powerful when they see it but
[2:39:48.940 --> 2:39:53.500]  we've got to be the leaders of all these soft people and speak out about what's happening i'm
[2:39:53.500 --> 2:39:58.860]  walking around hiking bikes or people are wearing mask walking i go hey listen not want to wear that
[2:39:58.860 --> 2:40:04.300]  mask because the pollen but surely not coming 19 up next the force inoculations are coming we gotta
[2:40:04.300 --> 2:40:08.620]  you know call them out right and they're gonna try to trick people they're gonna say oh well first
[2:40:08.620 --> 2:40:13.260]  responders need it military needs it to go to a public school you need it to get your library card
[2:40:13.260 --> 2:40:17.180]  you need it so by hook or crook they're gonna try to force us down our throats and they're gonna
[2:40:17.180 --> 2:40:22.620]  weigh and measure the public dissent i think that's why we're alerting people right now and it's
[2:40:22.620 --> 2:40:27.260]  absolutely an illusion this is an alchemist trick that they're playing that's right it's all a
[2:40:27.260 --> 2:40:33.820]  giant test atomic age thank you brother let's go ahead take another call let's talk to humans versus
[2:40:33.820 --> 2:40:41.500]  technology forest in texas go ahead uh thank you sir i i i love i love what you do but uh
[2:40:42.700 --> 2:40:46.780]  i think i think what you do is a great thing for this nation i appreciate your service
[2:40:46.780 --> 2:40:53.100]  because in many ways it's uh anyways get to the point humans versus technology they have data
[2:40:53.100 --> 2:40:59.020]  data uh technology meant for political occupation like of afghanistan where they could take
[2:40:59.820 --> 2:41:05.900]  threat fusion analysis and then they could predict the outcome like assassinations political outcomes
[2:41:05.900 --> 2:41:13.340]  it's like a terminator but like remember in the terminator three the 1800 or the the 101 terminator
[2:41:13.340 --> 2:41:20.300]  comes to 1000 yeah well that's but but it's able to predict the future which google admits when they
[2:41:20.300 --> 2:41:26.380]  get us all feeding into them humans are actually psychic they can have a computer the the internet
[2:41:26.380 --> 2:41:31.980]  and google and systems like it become a sensor that can pick up human consciousness and human mass
[2:41:31.980 --> 2:41:37.820]  movement and by being able to read that gauge they then get almost like a godlike control to
[2:41:37.820 --> 2:41:42.860]  stare into the human subconsciousness the human group collective there's one level even higher
[2:41:42.860 --> 2:41:48.380]  than that which is the integration of uh the the like the neural link technology to actually take
[2:41:48.380 --> 2:41:55.340]  a possession over the human form so that you can override override a revolution so like the next
[2:41:55.340 --> 2:42:00.300]  layer isn't like oh sure no they obviously add stimuli to control the mass but what gives them
[2:42:00.300 --> 2:42:05.660]  the real power is being able to look into our hopes and dreams in real time and see our subconscious
[2:42:05.660 --> 2:42:11.020]  desires before we see it yeah i totally agree and that's a very a depth way of looking at it
[2:42:11.020 --> 2:42:16.060]  but it's also the ability to hijack the body itself to steer a revolution you know you could
[2:42:16.060 --> 2:42:21.580]  be so passionate and full of so so much vigor but like we learned from the church committee
[2:42:21.580 --> 2:42:26.700]  it was about hijacking your body against your will you know you'd be screaming in your head
[2:42:26.700 --> 2:42:31.260]  i guess the art type is the possession of a demon you know and they can also create false
[2:42:31.260 --> 2:42:36.220]  memory just remember this just remember this these are humans too trying to play god they will
[2:42:36.220 --> 2:42:41.420]  fail right if you're aware of the program it has no power only if you're unaware do they have power
[2:42:41.420 --> 2:42:46.140]  ollie big pharma and big sugar is where we should start there's a lot of these technologies that
[2:42:46.140 --> 2:42:50.060]  they're experimenting with but they haven't perfected if they had perfected it we wouldn't be on the
[2:42:50.060 --> 2:42:56.460]  air right now so fight big pharma fight uh exactly i'm up criticize the last caller but let's not
[2:42:56.460 --> 2:43:01.180]  farce your big great points let's not overestimate their power right because they've hypothetically
[2:43:01.180 --> 2:43:05.740]  and on and on the drawing board they want this power but they're not god right they're not god
[2:43:05.740 --> 2:43:11.340]  we are facing other human beings they are pooling from a satanic realm but we've got to fight
[2:43:11.340 --> 2:43:16.060]  bad habit we're pulling from the from god we are we got our way they better look out yeah that's
[2:43:16.060 --> 2:43:19.820]  why they try to demoralize us make you think we're beat because they know we got the game plan
[2:43:19.820 --> 2:43:23.980]  we got the blueprint right here we've got the blueprint right here and you're seeing it happen
[2:43:23.980 --> 2:43:29.500]  in the culture chance the rapper and jesson beaver just released a song called holy kanye west isn't
[2:43:29.500 --> 2:43:35.660]  backing down the counterculture is the actual culture and what we're sold is this this disgusting
[2:43:35.660 --> 2:43:42.140]  minority view uh a violent a feral very liberal violence yeah and it's because people drink too
[2:43:42.140 --> 2:43:46.780]  much soda so i would say cut out soda no right it really is sugar that gets you unbalanced yeah
[2:43:46.780 --> 2:43:51.660]  you're like oh and then you'll listen to anything so the screen time mixed with sugar you just uh
[2:43:51.660 --> 2:43:55.980]  you know listen to anything and i think people ought to avoid those things to avoid that dystopian
[2:43:55.980 --> 2:44:00.220]  future i can literally gobble some high quality fish oil pills yeah our brand is excellent but
[2:44:00.220 --> 2:44:05.340]  then he'll do yeah and i mean it just sends me out like my brain works so good those pure yeah
[2:44:05.340 --> 2:44:10.620]  essential fatty acids versus sugar it's night and day it's worked for the asians in their health
[2:44:10.620 --> 2:44:17.100]  for millennias so you know uh people ought to consume it absolutely folks the answer to
[2:44:17.100 --> 2:44:21.580]  high fructose corn syrup is fish oil and krill oil uh let's go ahead and take another call
[2:44:21.580 --> 2:44:30.940]  let's talk to mountain patriot in colorado welcome sir hey alex i love you man love you um it feels
[2:44:30.940 --> 2:44:38.940]  like we're living in a hypnocracy where everyone's being ruled by hypnosis i uh i had a talk with
[2:44:38.940 --> 2:44:47.420]  my landlord the other day and uh he is still just absolutely convinced that that trump is a puppet of
[2:44:47.420 --> 2:44:53.260]  tootin and that oh yeah when i talk to leftist they're not just programmed they literally act
[2:44:53.260 --> 2:44:57.340]  like they're in a trance uh uh they don't even hear what you're saying is that what you're talking
[2:44:57.340 --> 2:45:03.660]  about yeah it's like they want to be apart they want to be scared i mean he's putting the 200
[2:45:03.660 --> 2:45:09.820]  thousand deaths he's blaming it all on trump he's terrified to go uh you know he's terrified to go
[2:45:09.820 --> 2:45:15.340]  to walmart he's he's seven years old healthy guy tell him to sell his property and move out of the
[2:45:15.340 --> 2:45:20.620]  country if he's so terrified that we're mismanaging this i'll tell him to sell his property uh and
[2:45:20.620 --> 2:45:23.740]  move out of the country to one of these countries where it's working but that's like liberals get
[2:45:23.740 --> 2:45:28.540]  into the drama of being victims and then where the brain goes once you're a victim yeah it's a
[2:45:28.540 --> 2:45:35.020]  performance art piece and i like that i like that hypnocracy i suggest that it's hypnosis and it's
[2:45:35.020 --> 2:45:40.380]  hip so they can tell you about what's hip and hypnocracy it's like a double it's a hypnocracy
[2:45:40.380 --> 2:45:45.660]  yeah yeah hypnocracy that's really cool i suggest that people read amusing ourselves to death
[2:45:45.660 --> 2:45:50.700]  by neil postman and you have to understand we're all debating the message which we should be doing
[2:45:50.700 --> 2:45:56.940]  but some of these mediums are controlled can only they themselves manipulate dopamine right
[2:45:56.940 --> 2:46:01.740]  right thank you mountain patriot amazing points we're moving these calls quickly next hour we'll
[2:46:01.740 --> 2:46:07.180]  go through all of it uh let's go to bob and pencilzania bob welcome hey alex i wanted to
[2:46:07.180 --> 2:46:11.260]  talk about our president's leadership on covid tyranny but like first i gotta thank you for the
[2:46:11.260 --> 2:46:16.620]  big sale at preparewithalex.com it enabled me to get another month's worth of emergency food
[2:46:16.620 --> 2:46:23.020]  and another alexa to a water purifier that stuff's going to my family because they're big
[2:46:23.020 --> 2:46:28.620]  trump supporters but they won't prepare they they look at me like i'm from mars because i
[2:46:28.620 --> 2:46:34.140]  don't wear a mask and i think olly's right that the leadership on this is a little schizophrenic
[2:46:34.140 --> 2:46:39.980]  because president trump needs to show leadership and hold accountable those responsible for this
[2:46:40.620 --> 2:46:46.700]  covid fiasco that this lockdown that doesn't need to be happening i mean the evidence is there
[2:46:47.660 --> 2:46:54.620]  that fauci paid wuhan to cook up this bio-weapon virus and the evidence is there the gates
[2:46:55.180 --> 2:47:01.980]  vaccine is going to be another bio-weapon well we don't know if it's going to be a bio-weapon
[2:47:01.980 --> 2:47:05.820]  if it's going to be sugar water i've heard you talk about this before alex what we know is that
[2:47:05.820 --> 2:47:10.460]  it's not what they say nothing is what they say well you know it's just a precedent to put in our
[2:47:10.460 --> 2:47:15.660]  body what they want right and create digital apps to track everywhere we go what we do we know all
[2:47:15.660 --> 2:47:20.540]  that and it probably will be deadly he's been saying it is we'll talk about this next hour
[2:47:20.540 --> 2:47:24.780]  because this is a big deal one of my few breaking points with trump is in pushing the vaccine i
[2:47:24.780 --> 2:47:29.100]  know why he's doing it and then and then i hypothetically cover both sides listeners have
[2:47:29.100 --> 2:47:34.540]  clipped it out i saw it this morning jones has become bill gates no i was saying trumps view
[2:47:34.540 --> 2:47:38.380]  i was wargaming i was very clear i don't support i watched yeah i watched you were standing in front
[2:47:38.380 --> 2:47:42.140]  of this desk and you were like look this is what's happening this is why he's doing it it's having
[2:47:42.140 --> 2:47:47.100]  political benefits i worry about the future fault you even said you said that this is kind of like
[2:47:47.100 --> 2:47:50.700]  a good magic and you're not you're scared of where it will go i watched that clip on the internet
[2:47:50.700 --> 2:47:54.540]  exactly well they've clipped it out to say that i'm endorsing that that's stupid which again that's
[2:47:54.540 --> 2:47:59.740]  black magic that when you when you take something and edit it right and lie that's not good because
[2:47:59.740 --> 2:48:04.380]  we know we've got we've got these uh these clips of sorrel saying horrible things but he puts a
[2:48:04.380 --> 2:48:09.100]  little proviso in we leave that in because we're not liars god bless you i really appreciate your
[2:48:09.100 --> 2:48:14.860]  call bob you have a great voice and great points all right we'll do a couple segments we'll try to
[2:48:14.860 --> 2:48:19.100]  finish up some calls but first we're gonna get into the meat potatoes get into this vaccine situation
[2:48:19.100 --> 2:48:24.940]  with the president and what is he doing i don't know your take on our respect ollie alexander
[2:48:24.940 --> 2:48:30.860]  is our guest where do people follow your work founders dot ollie alexander dot org founders
[2:48:30.860 --> 2:48:37.740]  dot ollie alexander dot org all right i've come to you many times and ask for your support and you've
[2:48:37.740 --> 2:48:43.340]  always come through and info wars has come through we've never sold out we've never back down we've
[2:48:43.340 --> 2:48:50.780]  always told the truth we've made mistakes but 98% of the time or so we're dead on and the enemy knows
[2:48:50.780 --> 2:48:56.620]  that info wars is a thought leader not just here but around the world and that's why the chai comms
[2:48:56.620 --> 2:49:02.940]  hollywood the globalist won us off the air because their global plan of total tyranny and a post
[2:49:02.940 --> 2:49:08.300]  human world will not succeed if we stay on air if you don't support us ladies and gentlemen now
[2:49:08.300 --> 2:49:12.700]  they're going to shut info wars down and shut everybody else down as well you already know
[2:49:12.700 --> 2:49:19.420]  that it's out in the open so again count the cost focus and realize how critical you are with your
[2:49:19.420 --> 2:49:22.940]  word of mouth spreading the word that overrides the sensors your financial support getting the
[2:49:22.940 --> 2:49:27.820]  products and info store dot com and your prayer i'm praying for you please pray for us let's do
[2:49:27.820 --> 2:49:31.900]  this together we're going to win we are winning but it's not going to be easy the enemy's trying
[2:49:31.900 --> 2:49:38.140]  to take it all from us let's not let them succeed last week tucker carlson came out and said america
[2:49:38.140 --> 2:49:43.580]  is becoming the soviet union in many ways we're worse than the soviet union the soviet union
[2:49:43.580 --> 2:49:48.700]  couldn't dream of what big tech can do surveilling and censoring us and we're going to get a lot worse
[2:49:48.700 --> 2:49:53.180]  than the soviet union when it comes to force inoculations and the medical tyranny being rolled
[2:49:53.180 --> 2:49:59.020]  out by the united nations now in control of what you can and can't say online the truth is ladies
[2:49:59.020 --> 2:50:04.780]  and gentlemen america is fighting for its life and the enemy's number one mission is to get trump
[2:50:04.780 --> 2:50:10.460]  out of office and number two is to silence info wars because we understand just how diabolical
[2:50:10.460 --> 2:50:15.900]  they are just how evil they are and we won't miss words we know who the globalist are we've got
[2:50:15.900 --> 2:50:21.020]  their number and we know how to beat them and we cover it seven days a week live at info wars and
[2:50:21.020 --> 2:50:25.820]  it's only because of your support so keep spreading the word keep praying for us and take advantage
[2:50:25.820 --> 2:50:30.540]  of the sales and get great products at info or store dot com now the globalists are hoping you
[2:50:30.540 --> 2:50:40.620]  don't visit info or store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:51.500 --> 2:50:55.340]  all right alex jones here back live next segment i'm gonna hit big topic
[2:50:55.340 --> 2:51:02.700]  what's going on with trump in the vaccine what's really behind that why is he doing that
[2:51:03.260 --> 2:51:08.140]  we'll discuss with ollie alex hander i'm your host alex jones but let's go ahead and hit this right
[2:51:08.140 --> 2:51:13.100]  here i showed this yesterday everybody's shocked by these children's apps but the police are
[2:51:13.100 --> 2:51:17.820]  investigating telling little kids hey take pictures of yourselves naked send it to us
[2:51:17.820 --> 2:51:23.820]  what they're saying is it a hacker well i've got alexa and i've got all the big app supporters
[2:51:23.820 --> 2:51:29.900]  and and the google home assist have all been caught doing this where hackers get in and do all this
[2:51:29.900 --> 2:51:35.340]  my point is why do we let things like this in our lives that are these two-way systems and then this
[2:51:35.980 --> 2:51:44.060]  video nude adults explain transgender bodies to 11-year-olds in danish kids show so they're
[2:51:44.060 --> 2:51:49.020]  just legalizing pedophilia why because i have no attraction to children other than like wanting to
[2:51:49.020 --> 2:51:53.580]  take care of them be nice to them and you know hug all my children i mean like to squeeze them that's
[2:51:53.580 --> 2:51:59.020]  it there's no what what is this spirit this energy that wants to corrupt children i guess if they
[2:51:59.020 --> 2:52:04.220]  corrupt them they can then implant their political ideology at that point by stealing their innocence
[2:52:04.220 --> 2:52:10.380]  or what is it i think that you know hurt people hurt people and i think that if you break a child
[2:52:11.180 --> 2:52:17.180]  they turn into a monster as an adult and i think that they want this world to be
[2:52:17.180 --> 2:52:23.180]  full of broken people so they can say the referendum on the family is over it is a thing of the past
[2:52:23.180 --> 2:52:27.580]  it is an archaic system humanity's broken so we have to take it over with the corporate system
[2:52:27.580 --> 2:52:32.620]  right which is what they did in germany 30 000 children placed with pedophiles creating the
[2:52:32.620 --> 2:52:37.900]  new beautiful family right and you know and and and that is so sick it's very sick and and we can
[2:52:37.900 --> 2:52:43.500]  see that these evil people like uh like hitler create their own little child armies too because
[2:52:43.500 --> 2:52:48.780]  what they want to do is issue a new paradigm into the future and it's not the paradigm of
[2:52:48.780 --> 2:52:54.860]  conservatism it's not the paradigm uh that that has allowed this species to survive and thrive
[2:52:54.860 --> 2:52:59.980]  and now venture into the stars it's it's really sick but it's it's it's to corrupt innocence and
[2:52:59.980 --> 2:53:06.380]  creativity and hijack imagination and to turn it into illusion i totally agree well said better
[2:53:06.380 --> 2:53:11.820]  than i could do an info wars dot com article good news though black lives matter after four years
[2:53:11.820 --> 2:53:17.660]  of officially having up on it that their main operation is disrupt and in the nuclear family
[2:53:17.660 --> 2:53:23.100]  they have removed that from their manifesto this alex this is huge i can't even believe
[2:53:23.100 --> 2:53:28.540]  we're talking about this because i saw this before i before i got into the bunker and it was page
[2:53:28.540 --> 2:53:33.740]  not found on black lives matter dot whatever and what's interesting about that is that this proves
[2:53:33.740 --> 2:53:40.300]  what we were talking about last time that alex soros and george soros want kamala heros to be vp
[2:53:40.300 --> 2:53:46.220]  so that she can be the president and now they've determined that black lives matter is too toxic
[2:53:46.220 --> 2:53:51.660]  oh my gosh it's backfiring it's not turning out the left it's suppressing the left and
[2:53:51.660 --> 2:53:54.860]  we're not getting any of the middle votes of the right votes these never trumpers that the
[2:53:54.860 --> 2:54:01.340]  media hypes up meanwhile trump has the highest intro party approval rating of any candidate
[2:54:01.340 --> 2:54:05.740]  in american recorded history and they ran this because it worked in other countries but now
[2:54:05.740 --> 2:54:10.300]  it's backfiring because america's not other countries over not i mean i think we've got some
[2:54:10.300 --> 2:54:15.820]  fight to us you can see how often alex changes his url he's trying to break the big tech sensors
[2:54:15.820 --> 2:54:19.580]  and it's just because we've got some fight in us and you're seeing it at the people in the boat
[2:54:19.580 --> 2:54:23.180]  parades you're seeing it in the motorcade parades people like if i don't they're starting to get
[2:54:23.180 --> 2:54:28.220]  though they just summon the resistance they just call the big the big genie they get it alex and
[2:54:28.220 --> 2:54:33.100]  you know me doing uh campaigns for 13 years over 100 campaigns at the federal level i can tell you
[2:54:33.100 --> 2:54:36.940]  they get it because what you want to do is it's like the art of war you watch your opponent move
[2:54:36.940 --> 2:54:42.220]  uphill downhill you watch your opponent uh uh fortress down and and collect resources over
[2:54:42.220 --> 2:54:46.540]  and you know when they're running out of food and sick soldiers so what i'm looking at from a strategy
[2:54:46.540 --> 2:54:51.660]  point of view is that you're watching joe biden adopt our our talking points like yeah we have to
[2:54:51.660 --> 2:54:56.460]  jail the rioters that's us winning that's us winning it means that their internal polling
[2:54:57.260 --> 2:55:01.180]  is saying that they're losing and they're not gaining votes and they still want a majority
[2:55:01.180 --> 2:55:07.340]  of the population so this means that trump's instincts your instincts my tweets they're
[2:55:07.340 --> 2:55:12.060]  working we're winning we've got the pulse exactly like luke skywalker he doesn't need a computer to
[2:55:12.060 --> 2:55:17.340]  hit the reactor no because we already have the computer we see it we see the target we're after
[2:55:17.340 --> 2:55:22.860]  the target we're gonna win they're gonna lose that's the game we're firing those torpedoes down the
[2:55:22.860 --> 2:55:31.580]  reactor job it's going down bitches look i'm not a sick person but i am i can do that we're gonna
[2:55:31.580 --> 2:55:36.540]  sell it if they stole it it'd be a bigger bigger attack on them like if you really want to destroy
[2:55:36.540 --> 2:55:43.740]  the new order they should kill trump and take over they'll really wreck their ass there it is now
[2:55:43.740 --> 2:55:51.340]  confirmed every organization affiliated with president trump and his campaign is being attacked
[2:55:51.340 --> 2:55:58.060]  out of communist china in the biggest coordinated cyber attacks the planet has ever seen joe biden
[2:55:58.060 --> 2:56:03.420]  has openly said china should run every facet of our lives the speaker of the house polosi has said
[2:56:03.420 --> 2:56:11.020]  that china wants joe biden info wars is under dozens of different types of cyber attack a day
[2:56:11.020 --> 2:56:18.940]  info wars dot com news wars dot com prison planet dot com info war store dot com and they're not even
[2:56:18.940 --> 2:56:27.020]  hiding that it's coming directly out of communist china america is fighting for its life everyone
[2:56:27.020 --> 2:56:32.540]  that votes for joe biden is a stooge of communist china and an idiot trying to destroy not just
[2:56:32.540 --> 2:56:38.380]  their future but our future but no matter what happens to this election the awakening and the
[2:56:38.380 --> 2:56:54.300]  chain reaction has begun and cannot be reversed
[2:57:39.260 --> 2:57:59.980]  so if you're a radio listener let me narrate what just happened the communist chinese government
[2:57:59.980 --> 2:58:05.340]  just put out videos of their bombers and fighter bombers blowing up us military bases
[2:58:05.340 --> 2:58:11.660]  is playing exhilarating music and they have now buzzed taiwan hong kong they're threatening to
[2:58:11.660 --> 2:58:16.940]  invade they're threatening to attack the philippines they're behaving like japan did
[2:58:16.940 --> 2:58:23.020]  have started world war two they're antagonistic and they need to increase the morale and let
[2:58:23.020 --> 2:58:28.300]  their people visualize killing american boys and girls that's what they need to do they need to
[2:58:29.260 --> 2:58:34.220]  hypnotize their population to get ready for some kinetic war which i don't want one you
[2:58:34.220 --> 2:58:37.820]  don't want one there are unfortunately some crazy people on the right who want to connect
[2:58:37.820 --> 2:58:42.380]  why are they so arrogant though i mean it just i guess that's how communist are i this is my
[2:58:42.380 --> 2:58:46.700]  theory i'm not i'm not sure if i'm correct i think that they've made an assessment on the american
[2:58:46.700 --> 2:58:51.740]  people that it's impossible for us to win a war that we don't have the public stomach for they
[2:58:51.740 --> 2:58:55.340]  watch our news and think we're seeing and they think we're weak exactly they think the average
[2:58:55.340 --> 2:58:59.900]  american male's brown stulture yeah and i if you thought that you think well these people are pathetic
[2:58:59.900 --> 2:59:04.460]  right right because the media is really hid who america is still exactly and that's what i think
[2:59:04.460 --> 2:59:09.980]  and but that's why i think that we would survive better in an invasion than we would any war you
[2:59:09.980 --> 2:59:14.460]  know you know i agree americans will be very good at defending themselves not so much in offense
[2:59:14.460 --> 2:59:19.180]  yeah and it's it's unfortunate but this is what's happened since vietnam when we told reporters to go
[2:59:19.180 --> 2:59:25.180]  along soldiers and we only chronicled the horrors of war and not the people we liberated and not
[2:59:25.180 --> 2:59:30.300]  what we've done for the world it really it really war was a sigh up on purpose it was a sigh up on
[2:59:30.300 --> 2:59:34.540]  purpose because alex it's not like they gave us peace they didn't give us peace they gave us these
[2:59:34.540 --> 2:59:39.660]  many little military interventions and you know when bill clinton is down in police wars right
[2:59:40.220 --> 2:59:44.940]  yeah and they're invert again i maybe i'm gonna have to come up with a book one day called inversion
[2:59:44.940 --> 2:59:49.100]  but you know they're inverting the system they're not giving us peace they're giving us war and
[2:59:49.100 --> 2:59:53.980]  destruction called police actions yeah police actions that like you said the mill you know the
[2:59:53.980 --> 2:59:58.940]  un and you'll have america coming in bomb and then the un comes in after them and then has a police
[2:59:58.940 --> 3:00:03.180]  state that's stronger than their local government it's like what's going on there you can only
[3:00:03.180 --> 3:00:08.620]  have civil strife people aren't bought into their local system after set of the us of the green
[3:00:08.620 --> 3:00:14.700]  berets liberating right thus always tyrants right we come in and put the un and that's evil
[3:00:14.700 --> 3:00:19.100]  that's very evil and why do you think they're due why do you think clinton started this in africa
[3:00:19.100 --> 3:00:25.820]  that's where all the population growth is moving to for the next 100 years what they did in rwanda
[3:00:25.820 --> 3:00:31.900]  yeah so why do you think china has all this raw materials coming out of africa that's the next
[3:00:31.900 --> 3:00:36.860]  baby boom is africa and so china's in there the un's in there bill clinton started it during his
[3:00:36.860 --> 3:00:42.300]  administration and uh you know this is a plan and it is being executed and that's the next point is
[3:00:42.300 --> 3:00:50.060]  in western china they are literally sterile it's like the birth rates count by like two
[3:00:50.060 --> 3:00:54.300]  thirds they're literally sterilizing the women it's it's you know and you could argue at a sick
[3:00:54.300 --> 3:00:58.300]  level okay the muslims are out of control to sterilize them we don't become them and try to
[3:00:58.300 --> 3:01:02.780]  conquer them plus the Uyghurs aren't even an expansionist group right china just wants that
[3:01:02.780 --> 3:01:08.300]  land they just want that land and so i literally am for the muslims there where saudi arabia
[3:01:08.300 --> 3:01:15.820]  where is uh where where all these islamic states where is iran iran doesn't say a damn word about
[3:01:15.820 --> 3:01:22.380]  three million muslims in slave camps and i don't say something because i'm this moral high ground
[3:01:22.380 --> 3:01:28.540]  and i'm a good guy if they can do it to them they can do it to me it's wrong it's wrong it's wrong
[3:01:28.540 --> 3:01:33.820]  and i'm willing to go to war to stop it hey man i'm glad that you said that it's wrong it's wrong
[3:01:33.820 --> 3:01:38.140]  and people ask me all the time i'll leave you know how can i how can i fight it i was like you got to
[3:01:38.140 --> 3:01:42.860]  leave the system you have to trans stop making it about politics and what's right and wrong right
[3:01:42.860 --> 3:01:48.220]  what i oppose it if anybody does it yeah it's called or i won't be conquered by radical islam but i
[3:01:48.220 --> 3:01:54.220]  don't say kill millions of them no and especially not by these these kinds of these chai comms no
[3:01:54.220 --> 3:02:01.100]  no no no so it's it's really good and i think that's why people can't trust the establishment
[3:02:01.100 --> 3:02:06.380]  republic i just love the left lecturing us how we're racist and all this crap well while big tech
[3:02:06.380 --> 3:02:12.060]  is the worst offenders in bed with china they they hate the first amendment they hate the fourth
[3:02:12.060 --> 3:02:17.260]  amendment they hate the fifth amendment they sold us the 19th amendment and you know you're just
[3:02:17.260 --> 3:02:22.620]  watching them actually go crazy and i think that's why a lot of of leftists are joining the right
[3:02:22.620 --> 3:02:26.460]  wing and they're like they're confused they're like well why am i on your side and you're like
[3:02:26.460 --> 3:02:32.380]  because we're big 10 over here and we're not telling you what to do anymore you know so i i
[3:02:32.380 --> 3:02:36.700]  it we're standing up for humanity i don't want the Uighurs organized and try to invade europe
[3:02:36.700 --> 3:02:40.540]  no i'd say set up a fence and shoot them coming across but if they're in their own country living
[3:02:40.540 --> 3:02:43.740]  their lives and they're good people i'll defend them to the death right because they're humans
[3:02:43.740 --> 3:02:47.580]  genocide if you're attacking me i fight back if you're in your country being rounded up and
[3:02:47.580 --> 3:02:54.540]  killed by chai comms that's wrong yeah genocide genocide is wrong just it's just wrong why i've
[3:02:54.540 --> 3:03:00.700]  been so racist we're almost out of time and i've got the special report and then jerry salante
[3:03:00.700 --> 3:03:04.380]  takes over but it really is a powerful report we'll air at the start of the next segment
[3:03:04.380 --> 3:03:09.100]  it's a few minutes long and it deals with a beam of light aimed at west coast fires
[3:03:09.660 --> 3:03:14.780]  as pentagon warns that china has weaponized space we know china and rush particularly china
[3:03:15.340 --> 3:03:21.020]  have space based both space weapons and weapons that can aim down at the rest of the level
[3:03:21.020 --> 3:03:26.780]  this is a whole other level right now donald trump secured his uh permanent legacy early when he
[3:03:26.780 --> 3:03:32.140]  pushed the space force and people called him crazy you know i don't want to get too much into it but
[3:03:32.140 --> 3:03:38.540]  but uh you know i entire i don't i don't support expanding i even opposed you know as a republican
[3:03:38.540 --> 3:03:43.420]  when we came up with dhs and i oppose that uh but what i will say is i enthusiastically
[3:03:43.420 --> 3:03:48.300]  supported the creation of the space force we need it people don't know let's explain that
[3:03:48.300 --> 3:03:53.580]  we don't want more forces over us in our own country but other countries are above us in space
[3:03:53.580 --> 3:03:58.380]  there's so a geographic thing goes up into the heavens right so if you don't control the space
[3:03:58.380 --> 3:04:02.220]  you don't control your own country yeah i'll just say it's like fourth dimensional like it
[3:04:02.220 --> 3:04:07.180]  it is fourth dimensional you know it's up there yeah it's up there the faster and people need to
[3:04:07.180 --> 3:04:12.460]  understand this it's not a coincidence that we were uh leveraging for a peace deal with north korea
[3:04:12.460 --> 3:04:16.620]  while we're creating the space force you know there's only one rep in that may be threatened
[3:04:16.620 --> 3:04:20.220]  some miracle let's just say we're way ahead of everybody we're way ahead of everybody we're
[3:04:20.220 --> 3:04:25.740]  gonna beat the hell out of them we own the moon i'm going on record is that and uh i was told
[3:04:25.740 --> 3:04:30.860]  by folks involved we want like we've already got bases and a bunch of stuff i don't uh you know i don't
[3:04:30.860 --> 3:04:37.420]  know i'm right on the dark side like one mile away i don't know i can either confirm or confirm
[3:04:37.420 --> 3:04:43.340]  nor deny a lot of crazy stuff going on yeah it's good to be american though it's great we are like
[3:04:43.340 --> 3:04:48.300]  100 years at everybody we are it's not republican it's not democrat like right now everybody just
[3:04:48.300 --> 3:04:53.500]  has the fighting spirit i mean look at this clip you know you got elon on on rogan's show you got
[3:04:53.500 --> 3:04:58.860]  me on your show everybody's just like can i just be myself what happened to that rugged american
[3:04:58.860 --> 3:05:04.620]  spirit you know and i think that that's what's coming back well elon said we're going to mars
[3:05:04.620 --> 3:05:09.180]  the crew's gonna die but it'll be glory did he say that because you know they got a whole crew
[3:05:09.180 --> 3:05:14.220]  lined up right yeah yeah everybody's ready to die on on that mission and and and it's interesting
[3:05:14.220 --> 3:05:19.100]  to watch you got to pick your player do you want elon musky do you want jeff bezos one of them's
[3:05:19.100 --> 3:05:22.620]  going to get there first and we got to pick i just don't like how bezos is creating all these
[3:05:22.620 --> 3:05:27.660]  monopolies no but they're the same as elon does i mean i don't want his brain chip right right
[3:05:27.660 --> 3:05:32.220]  heck no so yeah we got his heavy rocket in this space though yeah we got to keep these guys in check
[3:05:32.220 --> 3:05:40.540]  though but but certainly bezos is uh the worst of uh of the oligarchs you know so he's the worst
[3:05:40.540 --> 3:05:48.380]  yeah because look the guy i we can't appreciate what a genius is he is he is smarter than carnegie
[3:05:48.380 --> 3:05:53.580]  this guy gets it at a level that we can't appreciate he sees the whole big takeover the grid
[3:05:54.140 --> 3:05:59.020]  yeah he's gonna have the driverless cars yeah so bait and switch reverse mergers then
[3:05:59.020 --> 3:06:03.740]  establish uh sectors where he takes over the market then bankruptcy markers to bring in his
[3:06:03.740 --> 3:06:09.180]  the market then get all of your suppliers then get government subsidy and then oh now you have
[3:06:09.180 --> 3:06:13.500]  to give me a security clearance because i own a whole section of the economy oh now i'm gonna be a
[3:06:13.500 --> 3:06:18.300]  vendor for the pentagon i'm gonna be a vendor for the cia so when i want my rockets in space
[3:06:18.300 --> 3:06:24.940]  they'll get in space he started with books alex books books on the internet and now he's in space
[3:06:24.940 --> 3:06:30.460]  and he plotted this out he plotted this all out oh no now his robot cars are taken over
[3:06:30.460 --> 3:06:35.500]  ali alexander ali alexander is our guest coming up you got a special report and then
[3:06:36.060 --> 3:06:41.100]  the one the only that's right carol salente stay with us spread the word
[3:06:43.420 --> 3:06:49.020]  the party was not gonna go on forever all the welfare all the entertainment all the decadence
[3:06:49.020 --> 3:06:57.500]  was only designed to get people domesticated dumb down selfish and most importantly isolated
[3:06:57.500 --> 3:07:03.420]  and now that most of the population is selfish isolated and very very dumb down and ignorant
[3:07:03.420 --> 3:07:09.660]  the new world order is facing its move and they are now gonna weaponize the giant masses of foolish
[3:07:09.660 --> 3:07:14.860]  followers who believe they just follow orders they'll get another another little piece of green
[3:07:14.860 --> 3:07:18.620]  like with the chicken pecs at the lever that all that they're really going to get is the news
[3:07:18.620 --> 3:07:23.740]  typing around their foolish neck those of us that are aware and informed can laugh at the
[3:07:23.740 --> 3:07:29.580]  massive slaves but remember they're a dangerous weapon appointed at our throats and so we've
[3:07:29.580 --> 3:07:34.540]  got to save them to save ourselves and to do that we've got to expose the globalist we've got to
[3:07:34.540 --> 3:07:38.780]  take it to them politically and absolutely annihilate them with the crimes that they've
[3:07:38.780 --> 3:07:45.100]  actually committed expose the enemy now you notice that over and over again the united nations are
[3:07:45.100 --> 3:07:49.580]  supposed controllers and bosses the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with
[3:07:49.580 --> 3:07:56.220]  has come out and said nothing can treat or prevent covid-19 well ladies and gentlemen that's a total
[3:07:56.220 --> 3:08:01.740]  lie if you get a lot of sunlight it's on record to produce a ton of vitamin d3 and it's almost
[3:08:01.740 --> 3:08:06.460]  impossible to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin d3 if you have zinc
[3:08:06.460 --> 3:08:11.020]  and vitamin c as well that's why people get the flu's and these colds in the winter because that's
[3:08:11.020 --> 3:08:17.260]  a vitamin d levels plunge now i've pointed this out and the media has called me a scammer for
[3:08:17.260 --> 3:08:21.180]  saying that there's hope and that people should have their vitamins and their minerals will now
[3:08:21.180 --> 3:08:26.380]  fouch he's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin d3 and see he should have also
[3:08:26.380 --> 3:08:31.740]  added zinc because the NIH website says you die without zinc but it's good news that he's being
[3:08:31.740 --> 3:08:36.940]  pressured now to admit the reality because so many doctors and nurses and experts in nutrition have
[3:08:36.940 --> 3:08:40.060]  been exposing the fact that he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins
[3:08:40.060 --> 3:09:03.900]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:09:03.900 --> 3:09:15.100]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show with jerald solente
[3:09:18.780 --> 3:09:22.060]  hello hello great being on the alex jones show
[3:09:23.020 --> 3:09:28.860]  wait it's uh it's a real honor and i thank alex jones for all he does and remember do what you
[3:09:28.860 --> 3:09:34.540]  can to support info wars and i don't know if alex knows this and wants to pass it on to
[3:09:34.540 --> 3:09:40.140]  trump but there's a real weak point a weak point there are a lot of them with biden
[3:09:40.940 --> 3:09:45.340]  and one of them that no one's talking about that we're going to have in our trends journal tomorrow
[3:09:47.500 --> 3:09:52.220]  is biden proposes slashing student debt so he's talking all about that
[3:09:52.220 --> 3:10:02.460]  and we go on to write in 2005 as a senator from delaware where the financial industry is among
[3:10:02.460 --> 3:10:11.980]  the state's largest in other words you open a business in uh in uh marieland with delaware
[3:10:13.340 --> 3:10:19.340]  and uh you don't have to worry about anything anymore because you could cause bankruptcy
[3:10:19.340 --> 3:10:25.900]  and on and on anyway biden was a strong proponent of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer
[3:10:25.900 --> 3:10:35.340]  protection act which prevented people with student loans from escaping them through bankruptcy
[3:10:39.580 --> 3:10:44.300]  as chair of the senate judiciary committee which screens propose laws regulating the
[3:10:44.300 --> 3:10:51.660]  financial industry biden helped make it more difficult for american borrowers to claim bankruptcy
[3:10:53.660 --> 3:10:57.020]  i remember when this happened this began under the clinton administration
[3:10:58.060 --> 3:11:04.540]  and it was pushed through with the bush administration biden was the big one making it
[3:11:04.540 --> 3:11:12.620]  impossible virtually students to claim bankruptcy and a lot of other people accept the bigs but
[3:11:12.620 --> 3:11:18.380]  that's just the fact not many people are talking about it so he thought we'd pass that on into him
[3:11:20.140 --> 3:11:22.220]  i want to talk a little bit about the markets
[3:11:25.340 --> 3:11:32.860]  oh the markets the markets dow's down now as we're speaking about six seven hundred and sixty points
[3:11:32.860 --> 3:11:41.900]  it should go in we had forecast a strong correction between now and election day
[3:11:44.140 --> 3:11:47.740]  the only thing that could reverse it is the federal reserve coming out
[3:11:48.540 --> 3:11:57.900]  and dumping more cheap money into the system will that happen probably yes because this
[3:11:57.900 --> 3:12:04.860]  thing is going down big time the global economy is in the greatest depression
[3:12:06.460 --> 3:12:12.300]  to show you something else that just went down it was like forty three dollars a barrel last week
[3:12:12.300 --> 3:12:19.500]  oil artificially propped up beginning of the week it was around thirty nine dollars a barrel for
[3:12:19.500 --> 3:12:28.940]  Brent crude and now today it's down back into the thirty nine dollar a barrel mark thirty nine
[3:12:28.940 --> 3:12:36.140]  dollars a barrel for Brent crude all of these oil rich companies whether countries companies
[3:12:36.140 --> 3:12:42.140]  or companies actually that's all they are they can't make it on this kind of money and neither
[3:12:42.140 --> 3:12:49.420]  can all these shale producers around the united states and all those cities and all the areas
[3:12:50.060 --> 3:12:56.220]  that are rich in shale and rich in oil they're going to go down hard the driving seasons over
[3:12:57.980 --> 3:13:05.100]  demand is down air travel around the world down 85 percent
[3:13:05.100 --> 3:13:17.180]  they're not using oil like they used to and the supply greatly outweighs the demand
[3:13:18.300 --> 3:13:24.220]  this is something very important to keep watching it's telling you what the future will look like
[3:13:25.020 --> 3:13:30.940]  and then you put it together our global nomic trend forecasting system making connections
[3:13:30.940 --> 3:13:40.300]  between different fields hey how about those Saudis huh yeah they need oil depending on whose
[3:13:40.300 --> 3:13:50.460]  stuff you look at they need it between 80 to 100 dollars a barrel rich economy to break even
[3:13:50.460 --> 3:13:56.700]  and it hasn't been like that in a long time yet they're fighting that war over there in Yemen
[3:13:56.700 --> 3:14:02.940]  nobody talks about what's a Yemen no Yemen no Yemen no right those yeah only 10 million of them
[3:14:02.940 --> 3:14:17.100]  were starving cholera Ebola forget coronavirus oh well over 150 000 dead from the war started by
[3:14:17.820 --> 3:14:24.620]  the clown prince and you know how he became a prince like his prince
[3:14:24.620 --> 3:14:29.740]  prince has kissed the frog and the frog became a prince that's how it happened
[3:14:29.740 --> 3:14:36.700]  it's a gang the Saudi gang was invented in the 1930s the point being
[3:14:39.740 --> 3:14:46.460]  they can't make it on this kind of money and neither could he any of these oil rich countries
[3:14:46.460 --> 3:14:56.380]  who wait yeah wait a long time one after another and then you talk to the poor countries that
[3:14:56.380 --> 3:15:07.340]  have oil like Venezuela like Nigeria one of the biggest countries in population in Africa
[3:15:07.340 --> 3:15:16.060]  they were doing terrible before the virus lockdowns hit this is important
[3:15:18.940 --> 3:15:28.060]  the only thing that's keeping the markets up is the cheap money that the Federal Reserve
[3:15:28.060 --> 3:15:34.540]  continues to pump into it go back to august 2019 the markets were tanking
[3:15:34.540 --> 3:15:40.380]  all of a sudden you're reading about the repo markets what that what's a repo market
[3:15:41.100 --> 3:15:45.660]  a repo markets where the money is with the gamblers the trading houses go to bar with
[3:15:45.660 --> 3:15:51.180]  for nothing and the Federal Reserve is like a gamble Federal Reserve ended up dumping
[3:15:51.180 --> 3:15:59.420]  seven trillion into it they need to keep the markets up because the average person will
[3:15:59.420 --> 3:16:08.940]  know how bad it is when wall street goes down fast and hard and remember it's not the average
[3:16:08.940 --> 3:16:17.820]  person that owns stock on wall street 1% the 1% on 52% of all the equities 10% on 88%
[3:16:21.340 --> 3:16:26.940]  they need to keep the markets up to make things look good because now we're going into the winter
[3:16:26.940 --> 3:16:34.060]  and it was a lousy summer for a lot of businesses and things get slow in the winter time
[3:16:36.380 --> 3:16:42.060]  we are heading toward the greatest depression and civil wars are going to be erupting throughout
[3:16:42.060 --> 3:16:49.820]  the globe in a country near you america america we're on the list
[3:16:49.820 --> 3:16:57.900]  when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose they lose it they're losing it big
[3:16:57.900 --> 3:17:08.300]  time hey you see those homicide rates going up how about those car thefts one after another
[3:17:10.300 --> 3:17:15.180]  violence is going to escalate like we've never seen before and by the way that's why we have
[3:17:15.180 --> 3:17:20.700]  bradley steiner one of the reasons writing survivalism and close combat
[3:17:23.100 --> 3:17:29.900]  tips and helps in our trends journal so remember do what you can to keep freedom alive
[3:17:30.540 --> 3:17:36.300]  support info wars and of course subscribe to the trends journal look at that cover by anthony
[3:17:36.300 --> 3:17:45.980]  freedom history before it happened in germany in australia in canada and now even in ohio every
[3:17:45.980 --> 3:17:54.300]  blue state every blue city is announcing that they are establishing emergency covid centers for
[3:17:54.300 --> 3:17:59.820]  people that refuse to be tested or people that are tested but refuse to stay in place while the
[3:17:59.820 --> 3:18:05.100]  results are coming back or those that supposedly break quarantine this of course is all based on
[3:18:05.100 --> 3:18:13.180]  the tests that are over 90 fraudulent and were designed to be so this is a power grab the world
[3:18:13.180 --> 3:18:18.780]  government globalist system is in trouble all over the planet free peoples are trying to pull out of
[3:18:18.780 --> 3:18:26.620]  it and every blue area i use the term blue as if in the u.s for blue for democrats red for republicans
[3:18:26.620 --> 3:18:33.100]  is basically globalist or communist and authoritarian and they are using this as their cover for an
[3:18:33.100 --> 3:18:37.340]  authoritarian takeover because they know the world's waiting to them it's a very simple equation it's
[3:18:37.340 --> 3:18:45.100]  illegal we must resist it remember the enemy is working around the clock to suppress voices of
[3:18:45.100 --> 3:18:52.940]  independent people all over the world the globalist have a plan for total vertical integration
[3:18:53.820 --> 3:19:01.900]  absolute authoritarianism to where you are a captive of their devices of their control
[3:19:01.900 --> 3:19:08.860]  but that is only a means to an end once they have the electronic straightjacket in place
[3:19:08.860 --> 3:19:13.980]  they are on record that they will bring in forced inoculations that sterilize you and your family
[3:19:13.980 --> 3:19:20.300]  and worse many of the vaccines being pushed by the united nations actually give people polio
[3:19:20.300 --> 3:19:27.260]  and actually give people cancer most cancer is viral that's a big secret the secret is beginning
[3:19:27.260 --> 3:19:34.700]  to come out it's even in the associated press remember all of these banned videos and reports
[3:19:34.700 --> 3:19:42.620]  are banned on video but only you can share them and save humanity the planets have aligned globally
[3:19:42.620 --> 3:19:47.500]  they've aligned nationally they've aligned financially culturally but most importantly
[3:19:47.500 --> 3:19:54.540]  spiritually we are living at a point in human development that will decide the entire future
[3:19:54.540 --> 3:19:59.500]  destiny of our species so that's why big tech control with the very dark forces of the globalist
[3:20:00.140 --> 3:20:06.380]  is trying to dumb us down isolate us make us depressed make us alone and traffic control
[3:20:06.380 --> 3:20:11.340]  every aspect of our lives literally brainwashing us with the stimuli that they look forward
[3:20:11.340 --> 3:20:17.500]  because they do not want us to take our birthright not just of americana but of true christendom
[3:20:17.500 --> 3:20:22.620]  and the renaissance and the enlightenment they are trying to create the new dark age
[3:20:22.620 --> 3:20:27.180]  where they have all the high technology and life extension and we are walled off in a
[3:20:27.180 --> 3:20:31.900]  technocracy that controls us through carbon credits and through a social credit score
[3:20:32.460 --> 3:20:38.140]  this is their plan we must come together and awaken out of our trance and say no we must
[3:20:38.140 --> 3:20:54.060]  embrace god you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:54.060 --> 3:21:08.540]  you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host jerald solente
[3:21:12.300 --> 3:21:17.420]  hello hello waiting on the alex jones show and here we are
[3:21:17.420 --> 3:21:24.940]  and getting close to election day the presidential reality show so what do we
[3:21:24.940 --> 3:21:31.660]  got going on well here's how we see it it's going to be a very very simple election
[3:21:33.020 --> 3:21:44.780]  masks versus no masks lockdowns versus no lockdown and president trump has to win the swing states
[3:21:44.780 --> 3:21:50.860]  in order for him to win the swing states he has to get more people to go out and vote
[3:21:52.380 --> 3:21:57.020]  it wasn't that he got a lot of people to go out and vote the last time in the swing states
[3:21:57.020 --> 3:22:05.020]  what happened was the demo craps didn't go out and vote for hillary so it wasn't like
[3:22:05.020 --> 3:22:11.500]  there was a big surge of votes for him there was a less of what they expected in the swing states
[3:22:11.500 --> 3:22:22.780]  for hitlery clinton so here's the deal as i said we're going into the winter months
[3:22:23.820 --> 3:22:29.340]  the restaurants we used to have out here where we are you know they were serving outside because
[3:22:29.340 --> 3:22:36.300]  we have the dictator over here quomo you only get out 25 capacity in new york city
[3:22:36.300 --> 3:22:44.460]  and they just allowed that so they're eating in the gutter out there they're eating in the streets
[3:22:46.540 --> 3:22:47.740]  and now it's too cold
[3:22:50.460 --> 3:22:53.500]  people aren't traveling already tourism is gone
[3:22:54.620 --> 3:23:02.140]  ed and now the winter months hey all of those places all of those jersey shores and everywhere
[3:23:02.140 --> 3:23:11.420]  else where the people used to flock by the tens of millions and a slow year and now it's slowing
[3:23:11.420 --> 3:23:18.380]  down more so people are going to become much more frustrated in the empty streets of new york
[3:23:18.380 --> 3:23:23.260]  and everywhere else you know what their business occupancy rate is office businesses occupancy
[3:23:23.260 --> 3:23:33.900]  rate in new york city thriving at about 10 percent people are freaked out they're buying the fear
[3:23:34.700 --> 3:23:40.140]  fear is easy to sell the covid war we're off to the covid war that covid is going to kill you
[3:23:40.140 --> 3:23:44.060]  but i'm going to protect you i'm your governor i'm your mayor i'm your little jerk that you
[3:23:44.060 --> 3:23:50.700]  believe because you're too stupid to think for yourself this thing's coming down big
[3:23:50.700 --> 3:23:58.860]  it goes back to 1992 when slick willy clinton ran against bush and ross perot
[3:24:01.740 --> 3:24:08.940]  the campaign slogan behind the scenes was it's the economy's stupid and that's what it is right
[3:24:08.940 --> 3:24:23.580]  now it's the economy's stupid and trump is going to blame the demo craps for destroying the economy
[3:24:24.380 --> 3:24:31.420]  that's the way i see masks versus no mask you heard biden say he wants to wear a mask
[3:24:31.420 --> 3:24:37.900]  you look at what a jerky looks like look what a stupid ignorant fool he looks like all like all
[3:24:37.900 --> 3:24:48.540]  the rest you know one of my top trends unfortunately the 20th century was the american century
[3:24:51.180 --> 3:25:01.820]  the 21st century will be the chinese century look at mao say sung biden with his mask on
[3:25:01.820 --> 3:25:08.940]  fits in perfectly and everybody else will do what your leader tells you to do
[3:25:11.740 --> 3:25:16.780]  america's again look at one of our another great anthony frida art work from our back trends

[3:29:56.220 --> 3:30:03.260]  in the covet war and that's why i'm telling you put your money where your mind is
[3:30:04.940 --> 3:30:10.380]  support info wars remember they got banned from all the social media
[3:30:10.380 --> 3:30:19.180]  yeah they need your support and so do we we have to unite for liberty love joy of beauty
[3:30:20.060 --> 3:30:28.220]  or else you're gonna live in hell on earth brought to you by the slimy dictators men
[3:30:28.220 --> 3:30:35.020]  and women in a city country state and nation near you we're going to be right back
[3:30:35.020 --> 3:30:44.540]  real power comes from the grassroots and real power comes from experience and i've been the
[3:30:44.540 --> 3:30:48.620]  fight more than 26 years against the globalist so it's important for listeners and viewers to
[3:30:48.620 --> 3:30:53.340]  understand when you support info wars to keep us on the air you're not supporting a news outlet that
[3:30:53.340 --> 3:30:59.180]  has sources and so we're able to always tell you what's coming when others can't it's because we
[3:30:59.180 --> 3:31:04.460]  are studying the enemy and doing the original analysis that gets picked up by trump intelligence
[3:31:04.460 --> 3:31:08.860]  agencies and major corporations that are part of the resistance that are part of the resistance
[3:31:08.860 --> 3:31:13.980]  to the overarching globalist system so i have to tell you how the hierarchy works in many cases
[3:31:13.980 --> 3:31:19.660]  info wars is at the head we're not the tail that means you're at the head and that's why
[3:31:19.660 --> 3:31:24.140]  your support of us is so critical biden and his constellation of criminals have told us
[3:31:24.140 --> 3:31:27.980]  and many others that if they get elected they're not just going to shut down info wars they're
[3:31:27.980 --> 3:31:32.620]  going to shut you down the long depression forced inoculations and more so now more than ever keep
[3:31:32.620 --> 3:31:40.060]  info wars on the air with high quality products at infowarstore.com last week tucker carlson came out
[3:31:40.060 --> 3:31:45.420]  and said america is becoming the soviet union in many ways we're worse than the soviet union
[3:31:46.060 --> 3:31:50.940]  the soviet union couldn't dream of what big tech can do surveilling and censoring us and we're

[3:32:55.820 --> 3:33:03.020]  probably by the time i finish this talk joe biden has always been a congenital liar part of the
[3:33:03.020 --> 3:33:11.260]  establishment for close to 50 years but now boy his brain degenerates we are seeing walking public
[3:33:11.260 --> 3:33:17.580]  dementia on the biggest stage of the world the 2020 election there are 370 million people in
[3:33:17.580 --> 3:33:23.420]  the united states if 200 million died from covid that'd be more than half of the population
[3:33:23.420 --> 3:33:28.700]  when not even one tenth of one percent have actually died but him putting these giant lies
[3:33:28.700 --> 3:33:33.820]  and these incredibly brain damaged statements out is emblematic of the general public being in a
[3:33:33.820 --> 3:33:40.380]  trance how is anyone even putting up with this it is beyond bizarre i've got some bad news for

[3:33:51.420 --> 3:33:56.380]  and a depression that's the globalists they're trying to bring america to our knees now if trump
[3:33:56.380 --> 3:34:01.660]  doesn't get elected they're still planning to bring us to our knees and really try to break our will
[3:34:01.660 --> 3:34:06.620]  and bring us into a super intense depression total control and like australia is already doing
[3:34:06.620 --> 3:34:11.740]  rounding up and arresting people that criticize what the left are doing that's the really bad news
[3:34:11.740 --> 3:34:16.540]  the good news is this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the world and the resistance
[3:34:16.540 --> 3:34:22.220]  is mounting and the globalists are panicking so bottom line we're in the fight we're starting to win

[3:38:18.860 --> 3:38:25.740]  couple of times a day but they you got to keep that blood red you know monopoly tunnel but seriously
[3:38:25.740 --> 3:38:31.420]  you got to take care of yourself the people that are dying from the disease and you know all know
[3:38:31.420 --> 3:38:39.500]  the data according to the census of disease control and prevention 94 percent of them had pre-existing
[3:38:41.820 --> 3:38:51.340]  2.6 pre-existing chronic conditions here that is all here
[3:38:51.340 --> 3:39:03.420]  this is from A or P how the immune system misfires there are many ways in which our bodies
[3:39:03.420 --> 3:39:09.420]  manifest immune problems but three of them stand out and the prevalence of each is increasing
[3:39:09.420 --> 3:39:19.340]  throughout our population among those who are hospitalized with COVID-19 34 percent had diabetes
[3:39:19.340 --> 3:39:29.580]  42 percent were obese 57 had high blood pressure according to the study by journal american medical
[3:39:29.580 --> 3:39:40.060]  association in april a chronic factor for all three conditions is chronic inflammation it causes
[3:39:40.060 --> 3:39:46.380]  your immune system to pump out white blood cells and chemical messengers that keep your defense
[3:39:46.380 --> 3:40:00.620]  activity engaged 24-7 coronavirus not the main cause of death for almost one-third of COVID-19
[3:40:00.620 --> 3:40:05.740]  victims is a report we're writing about this in the trends journal which is a weekly it goes out
[3:40:05.740 --> 3:40:13.900]  tomorrow the novel coronavirus there's no no no take that line out to all right the telegraph
[3:40:13.900 --> 3:40:20.780]  newspaper citing a study by oxford reported that over the summer months those who had a heart attack
[3:40:20.780 --> 3:40:29.100]  or in a car crash could be listed as a coronavirus fatality if the doctor working the case thought
[3:40:29.100 --> 3:40:36.700]  the virus played even a minor role in exacerbating the previous condition quote at the beginning
[3:40:36.700 --> 3:40:43.740]  of the epidemic we only saw this in a few cases dr jansen oak who was part of the team from oxford
[3:40:43.740 --> 3:40:50.700]  told the paper but this is increasing because a lot more people now had COVID the true death rate
[3:40:50.700 --> 3:40:56.700]  is an important thing to know because it gives us an idea of impact clearly COVID was having a
[3:40:56.700 --> 3:41:03.900]  massive impact in march and april but we need to know if the disease is now taking the same toll
[3:41:03.900 --> 3:41:15.980]  as before all right and as i mentioned before what are they doing they're telling young people
[3:41:15.980 --> 3:41:24.140]  not to go out and have a good time i cannot imagine being a young guy and not going out
[3:41:24.140 --> 3:41:39.260]  and partying in my teens and 20s and 30s into the 40s and a little bit into the 50s and into the 60s
[3:41:39.260 --> 3:41:52.060]  and into the 70s could you imagine they sucked a joy out of life these little low lives have
[3:41:52.060 --> 3:42:01.260]  sucked a joy out of life now there's a man who enjoys life yep and that's what we have to do
[3:42:04.220 --> 3:42:13.580]  life on earth goodwill to men and women this idiocy of locking us all up now let's put this
[3:42:13.580 --> 3:42:26.940]  in order again again we write about it in detail sweeten it's out of the news 5,864 fatalities
[3:42:26.940 --> 3:42:39.500]  from the virus they have a population of about 10 million no lockdown at all and and this is a hard
[3:42:39.500 --> 3:42:47.580]  fact well over 50 percent more like 60 percent of the people that died in sweden were from nursing
[3:42:47.580 --> 3:43:07.820]  homes so you take that number 5,864 more 65 and 10 million people now let's take a look at new york
[3:43:07.820 --> 3:43:32.780]  you have 33,000 plus dead out of a population twice the size of sweden not quite twice the size
[3:43:32.780 --> 3:43:42.460]  little smaller 19.5 million let's say twice the size okay so that brings sweden's death toll up
[3:43:42.460 --> 3:43:51.900]  to what now it would be 11,000 12,000 if they had the same size population march april may
[3:43:51.900 --> 3:44:03.100]  june july august september but yet little andy qualmo the daddy's boy born on third base who locked
[3:44:03.100 --> 3:44:11.500]  down new york state destroyed tens of thousands of businesses that are never going to open again
[3:44:11.500 --> 3:44:20.540]  ruin the lives of hundreds of thousands
[3:44:24.380 --> 3:44:25.180]  is a hero
[3:44:28.460 --> 3:44:32.620]  this is the clown that talked the opening of the democratic national convention
[3:44:33.900 --> 3:44:40.060]  now let me get this straight over 33,000 people died here and this guy's great at it
[3:44:40.060 --> 3:44:46.140]  and all these countries that locked down spain argentina one after another they locked down they
[3:44:46.140 --> 3:44:54.220]  hope india india locked down totally they open up them virus cases spike the lockdowns don't work
[3:44:56.140 --> 3:45:03.820]  immune system buildup does and that's why the swedes unlike the americans i gave you the number
[3:45:03.820 --> 3:45:11.980]  obesity and type 2 diabetes aren't kicking the bucket like americans are 70% are overweight 42%
[3:45:11.980 --> 3:45:21.420]  of that are obese so again do what you can to stay healthy the products that info was help you do
[3:45:21.420 --> 3:45:34.540]  that and to keep your mind alive and see the future subscribe to the trends journal thank you
