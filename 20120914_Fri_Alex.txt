[00:00.000 --> 00:11.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.240 --> 00:18.840]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.840 --> 00:39.400]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:39.400 --> 00:47.120]  ladies and gentlemen we are live it is already Friday the 14th day of September
[00:47.120 --> 00:54.280]  2012 and we are going to be here for the next three hours you've got a bomb
[00:54.280 --> 00:58.720]  threat here in Austin Texas at the University of Texas the largest
[00:58.720 --> 01:05.600]  university in the world arguably and there's also a bomb threat taking place
[01:05.600 --> 01:12.120]  at North Dakota campus a Middle Eastern man or someone with that voice hello
[01:12.120 --> 01:17.560]  this is a beep I'm going to bomb you in 90 minutes I have been dressed as mailman
[01:17.560 --> 01:23.280]  there are bombs in the in the the what you call it where you put the mail the
[01:23.280 --> 01:29.080]  little boxes I'm going to get you and everyone runs screaming in fear I got
[01:29.080 --> 01:33.800]  to the office it was just like a few people were walking around excitedly and
[01:33.800 --> 01:36.880]  that's fine I understand you know the media is hyping and likes the end of
[01:36.880 --> 01:40.360]  the world and at first I'm like well maybe somebody had a deal test coming up
[01:40.360 --> 01:44.520]  today because it is Friday and they were a little nervous some graduate student
[01:44.520 --> 01:48.120]  you know schizophrenic I wanted to become a psychologist or psychiatrist or
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.360]  something but then I noticed the whole North Dakota thing and this fits in with
[01:52.360 --> 01:57.400]  all the hysteria in the Middle East and this this movie putting down Muhammad so
[01:57.400 --> 02:01.320]  the Muslims go crazy if somebody puts down the Prophet Muhammad their Prophet
[02:01.320 --> 02:04.920]  Muhammad and burn everything down over the Middle East or have kill each other
[02:04.920 --> 02:09.440]  and over here though if you have a bomb threat we all run off the edge of a
[02:09.440 --> 02:14.440]  cliff and fear from it I'll tell you there's a real evacuation going on in
[02:14.440 --> 02:19.920]  Guatemala big volcano by a major city is erupting outside tourist center they've
[02:19.920 --> 02:24.960]  ordered 33,000 people evacuated the officials have not the public servants
[02:24.960 --> 02:29.160]  the officials that's the new upper-class worldwide is the government
[02:29.160 --> 02:34.800]  bureaucrat class where hey you may not be skilled at anything or be talented but
[02:34.800 --> 02:38.320]  you can't have some authority over somebody but that's the kind of thing
[02:38.320 --> 02:43.720]  you do want to evacuate from it what do they say the wicked flea when none
[02:43.720 --> 02:52.000]  pursue the wicked flea when none pursue now obviously we're gonna have
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.160]  reporters as we're here in Austin we've got Melissa Melton and John Bown down
[02:56.160 --> 02:59.920]  there shooting video and interviewing people coming up in about 20 minutes we'll
[02:59.920 --> 03:05.440]  talk about the bomb threat because the guy said what an hour ago that in 90
[03:05.440 --> 03:12.280]  minutes he was gonna blow everything up so so we'll find out I guess here in the
[03:12.280 --> 03:16.600]  next 30 minutes if bombs are gonna go off everywhere I'll tell you what's going
[03:16.600 --> 03:21.520]  off though GMO corn GMO soybeans that are sterilizing you and are linked to
[03:21.520 --> 03:26.520]  massive organ failure and cancer in all the mammal studies they won't allow
[03:26.520 --> 03:31.480]  human studies there there is a new special report out right now dealing with
[03:31.480 --> 03:36.160]  the new wheat coming out that top scientists are saying could cause organ
[03:36.160 --> 03:41.120]  failure and other things so all of that is going on also drudgereport.com is a
[03:41.120 --> 03:49.640]  link to our report from last night about TSA gropers are now not just at the
[03:49.640 --> 03:54.160]  Paul Ryan events but out to Mitt Romney events and I want to find out because it
[03:54.160 --> 03:58.160]  doesn't explain are they inserting themselves like the secret service to
[03:58.160 --> 04:01.360]  the secret service call them in or did Mitt Romney ask for him because let me
[04:01.360 --> 04:06.160]  tell you something I've never been a one-issue person but I hate the TSA and
[04:06.160 --> 04:09.680]  this takeover so much and I understand it's the key of the takeover of the
[04:09.680 --> 04:13.960]  total federalization globalization that that that I would almost vote for
[04:13.960 --> 04:19.280]  somebody just if they'd not have the TSA try to grope my family and stuff but
[04:19.280 --> 04:22.960]  their answer will be don't worry wear a tracker chip which they're now coming out
[04:22.960 --> 04:26.760]  with where you wear a bracelet or a taser thing they're just taking over all
[04:26.760 --> 04:33.000]  of the infrastructure and travel so it's a big issue we're in tyranny and so

[08:55.880 --> 09:01.520]  to cover today obviously the big headlines out there are Al Qaeda threat
[09:01.520 --> 09:07.880]  shuts down University of Texas and also the University of North Dakota campuses
[09:07.880 --> 09:12.520]  UT is probably a third of the city of Austin it's the biggest campus and as
[09:12.520 --> 09:18.120]  the most students roughly they argue the point of any campus in the world we
[09:18.120 --> 09:25.440]  have our reporters Melissa Melton and John Bowne on the ground down there we're
[09:25.440 --> 09:31.920]  gonna be going to them in a few minutes I got to the office at about 10 a.m. and
[09:31.920 --> 09:37.760]  the news had just broken minutes earlier all over the local news as if the end of
[09:37.760 --> 09:44.040]  the world was occurring because someone called up and said I am going to put
[09:44.040 --> 09:50.640]  bombs in your mailboxes and get you prepare I will kill you I mean basically
[09:50.640 --> 09:54.600]  like that puppet that's on TV the dead terrorist or whatever his name is and
[09:54.600 --> 09:59.200]  the wicked flee when none pursue you would think it's the end of the world
[09:59.200 --> 10:03.560]  I mean that's all anybody's talking about in Austin is the fact that they
[10:03.560 --> 10:08.840]  said in 90 minutes after the call that the bombs are gonna go off so that's in
[10:08.840 --> 10:15.320]  about 20 minutes from now 20 minutes from now the University of Texas
[10:15.320 --> 10:18.640]  according to this phone calls gonna have bombs go off what do you want to bet
[10:18.640 --> 10:24.560]  no bombs go off and if the feds are behind this they might have a fire a
[10:24.560 --> 10:30.680]  firecracker or something I mean this this is just amazing to see the
[10:30.680 --> 10:35.640]  hysteria and how we can be manipulated hey somebody puts out a YouTube video the
[10:35.640 --> 10:41.760]  corporate media hypes it showing Mohammed you know ripping a woman apart with a
[10:41.760 --> 10:46.400]  horse or something and the Middle East goes up in flames and US ambassadors get
[10:46.400 --> 10:50.000]  killed and all the precious little al-qaeda jihadis they've they've
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.560]  delivered in the Libyan Syria turn on their globalist masters I mean this is
[10:55.560 --> 10:59.720]  ridiculous so somebody talks about Mohammed and and and some of the
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.840]  Muslims go crazy and then here in America you get a bomb threat isn't like
[11:03.840 --> 11:07.400]  this other parts of the world folks where you just have this this total
[11:07.400 --> 11:13.480]  culture of fear I see cases all the time where well you see it the news where
[11:13.480 --> 11:17.800]  somebody in even in rural areas will walk out with their rifle to stick it in
[11:17.800 --> 11:22.360]  their truck or their car to go to shoot and range or go hunting and well the
[11:22.360 --> 11:26.400]  police are shutting down the part of the city and looking for a man with a gun
[11:26.400 --> 11:31.800]  and then you'll hear the report yeah I saw him he was putting a rifle in his
[11:31.800 --> 11:36.960]  car and oh my gosh and in fact there's a few weeks ago they shut down part of
[11:36.960 --> 11:40.600]  UT because somebody on the edge of campus was seen putting a rifle in a
[11:40.600 --> 11:46.360]  car yeah it's Texas there's rifles all over the place I mean I'm in here right
[11:46.360 --> 11:50.880]  now at the office putting night vision and stuff for the next episode of
[11:50.880 --> 11:54.440]  Brothers in Arms our gun show you know to go out and test night vision and
[11:54.440 --> 11:58.880]  stuff with sponsors I mean what if I walk in the office part with a rifle are
[11:58.880 --> 12:03.600]  we gonna just shut half the city down and run around in fear now two things
[12:03.600 --> 12:08.240]  could be going on this could be a prank or it could be some angry disgruntled
[12:08.240 --> 12:14.680]  Muslim who's mad that somebody exercised their free speech to get them all
[12:14.680 --> 12:20.280]  stirred up as a political October surprise for Obama as all of this gets
[12:20.280 --> 12:24.920]  out of control or it could blow up an Obama's face if he doesn't handle it
[12:24.920 --> 12:27.640]  right and it could hand it to Mitt Romney but it doesn't matter but I mean
[12:27.640 --> 12:30.840]  the guys basically there's like one degree of separation in their real
[12:30.840 --> 12:34.880]  policies they look different but they got basically the same elite financing
[12:34.880 --> 12:38.120]  them and some of the same speechwriter types you know reading off the
[12:38.120 --> 12:42.200]  teleprompter people like I liked Obama speech I liked Mitt Romney speech they
[12:42.200 --> 12:47.720]  didn't write it okay it's not what they really think they're corporate pitch men
[12:47.720 --> 12:54.240]  front men representatives cults of personality Bill Clinton was financed by
[12:54.240 --> 12:59.640]  the globalist but he was a real CIA agent out of college with Hillary he
[12:59.640 --> 13:04.000]  actually wrote most of his speeches he actually called the shots because the
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.040]  globalist respected him that much and he's that evil Kennedy was a president
[13:09.040 --> 13:11.840]  who didn't go along with the globalist and tried to do his own stuff they
[13:11.840 --> 13:18.680]  killed him Reagan who was an actor actually was more of a president and
[13:18.680 --> 13:23.760]  made more decisions than Obama does or George W. Bush did I mean you need to
[13:23.760 --> 13:29.040]  understand presidents today Nixon ran the whole show and the elite didn't like
[13:29.040 --> 13:32.080]  that even though he was their guy they got a little jealous of that because he
[13:32.080 --> 13:36.600]  did what he wanted we don't have presidents anymore in this country okay
[13:36.600 --> 13:43.920]  Jimmy Carter bumbling puppet who they shut up George Bush senior total
[13:43.920 --> 13:48.240]  globalist you know front man of the globalist but making some of the
[13:48.240 --> 13:53.720]  decisions now though under the last few presidents total absolute teleprompter
[13:53.720 --> 13:58.200]  bill so we're going to continue breaking this down and then get into the big
[13:58.200 --> 14:01.520]  news which I don't want this to be a distraction not just the Middle East and
[14:01.520 --> 14:06.520]  the burning embassies and the American flags being pulled down oh in Tunis they
[14:06.520 --> 14:09.720]  pulled down the American flag and a couple other places they put pulling it
[14:09.720 --> 14:13.640]  down why is that a big deal here in America the illegal aliens pulled down
[14:13.640 --> 14:18.480]  the American flag in San Francisco and in Tucson Arizona off the private
[14:18.480 --> 14:24.480]  businesses off of public schools off of where else do they do it off of post
[14:24.480 --> 14:30.040]  offices there's video and photos and it's like oh how cute American school kids
[14:30.040 --> 14:34.000]  in San Francisco Hispanic Americans can't wear American flags they're told
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.880]  take it off it's upsetting the illegal aliens who are so nationalistic for
[14:37.880 --> 14:43.680]  Mexico and say hey California was Mexico you take that shirt off in Mexico
[14:43.680 --> 14:49.120]  because the Southwest for all its purposes is Mexico and the globalist
[14:49.120 --> 14:53.840]  run the whole show they run Mexico and Mexico runs the Southwest and they run
[14:53.840 --> 14:57.280]  the narcotics and they run it all and and and the government wants to
[14:57.280 --> 15:01.640]  destabilize it further and spread that bedlam to the United States as a false
[15:01.640 --> 15:06.320]  flag to take our guns and even though they got caught the ATF's trying to
[15:06.320 --> 15:09.920]  restrict semi-autos and things by regulation not by law right now
[15:09.920 --> 15:15.800]  sighting Southwest bedlam and heads being dumped out every day on the US
[15:15.800 --> 15:20.720]  Mexico border so I got to give my guns up because you narcotics trafficking
[15:20.720 --> 15:26.200]  megabanks who said in the SPP rebuilding your whole new world order system
[15:26.200 --> 15:32.200]  that you'd use border crises to establish your North American Union all
[15:32.200 --> 15:35.520]  right I'm ranting now the big news that I'm gonna cover at the bottom of the
[15:35.520 --> 15:41.440]  hour the big enchilada is that on Monday we had Ted Anderson on about this they
[15:41.440 --> 15:44.640]  announced we're not gonna call it QE3 it's just it's gonna be called
[15:44.640 --> 15:49.640]  continued easing and I called Paul Watson this morning on the phone together
[15:49.640 --> 15:54.840]  we sketched out an article we collaborate a lot and because I was upset
[15:54.840 --> 15:59.360]  because no one got what was happening with the quantitative easing they're
[15:59.360 --> 16:03.480]  like oh 40 billion a month in stimulus for the American people no that's not
[16:03.480 --> 16:07.240]  what's going on so Paul has the article coming out but right before I went on
[16:07.240 --> 16:12.440]  air Washington's blog the great writer over there the great researcher they
[16:12.440 --> 16:16.720]  got it so that article is already up at info wars.com is Paul Watson's article
[16:16.720 --> 16:21.240]  up yet because he said it would have already been up and it's a maximum
[16:21.240 --> 16:25.800]  issue that I get that article that I helped you know right this morning he's
[16:25.800 --> 16:30.600]  polishing it up and adding links to it come out but in the time being before we
[16:30.600 --> 16:35.880]  get into this it's up at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com as predicted
[16:35.880 --> 16:44.000]  Bernanke launches QE3 to help big banks which will destroy the economy that
[16:44.000 --> 16:53.280]  money goes to buy derivatives it goes to buy worthless counterfeit mortgage
[16:53.280 --> 16:57.600]  derivatives that have been sold in some cases more than 50 times counterfeit
[16:57.600 --> 17:02.200]  crud and the media spends it like they're helping the economy that's why
[17:02.200 --> 17:06.040]  this inflation hasn't been as intense as it should have been with tens of
[17:06.040 --> 17:10.280]  trillions of money being printed and issued because it only goes to mega
[17:10.280 --> 17:15.000]  rich that's why the only real hard-core hyperinflation you see is in

[18:59.560 --> 19:03.160]  them the sense that we're getting is that a lot of students thought this was a drill
[19:03.160 --> 19:07.480]  because apparently they've been doing a lot of these drills lately so when the
[19:07.480 --> 19:11.440]  siren first went off everybody just kind of sat there because they thought it
[19:11.440 --> 19:16.160]  was just a drill it wasn't until later when they started sending masks telling
[19:16.160 --> 19:20.680]  everybody to get off immediately that the fear is going to really set in and
[19:20.680 --> 19:28.400]  everyone we talked to is pretty afraid. All right do we have John Bown on his

[25:22.520 --> 25:27.440]  article up at info wars.com the next 10 minutes on this which has a nuclear
[25:27.440 --> 25:33.920]  reactor has a nuclear reactor at it so now they've got this big giant base with
[25:33.920 --> 25:41.000]  fences all around it and they've got to evacuate that closed campus now because
[25:41.000 --> 25:47.720]  of supposed bombs breaking news UT JJ pickle facility also evacuated but the
[25:47.720 --> 25:53.240]  real headline is nuclear reactor evacuated we take you now to Melissa
[25:53.240 --> 25:59.160]  Melton info wars.com reporter on the street Melissa recap what you were
[25:59.160 --> 26:04.200]  trying to say earlier we met up with a bunch of students as the evacuation is
[26:04.200 --> 26:08.720]  getting in a full swing and from those that we talked to it seems that a lot of
[26:08.720 --> 26:11.720]  people didn't take this seriously because they thought it was a drill
[26:11.720 --> 26:15.200]  according to almost every student we spoke to there have been a lot of drills
[26:15.200 --> 26:19.480]  going on with this same scenario lately and so when the alarm started to go off
[26:19.480 --> 26:22.520]  people didn't take it seriously because they thought it was just another drill
[26:22.520 --> 26:27.080]  and it wasn't until later when the campus started sending out mass text saying
[26:27.080 --> 26:31.760]  to get off of campus immediately that people started to get scared and really
[26:31.760 --> 26:36.840]  file out quick so I mean I've noticed that so it was kind of fun to get scared
[26:36.840 --> 26:40.800]  was it kind of like a carnival atmosphere a little bit yeah we got that
[26:40.800 --> 26:44.760]  sense but they just kept saying over and over there was been so many drills
[26:44.760 --> 26:48.920]  lately we didn't know what was real and what wasn't oh so they've been saying
[26:48.920 --> 26:56.440]  there's been an increase in drills yes in this same scenario recently
[26:57.080 --> 27:03.240]  expanding on this there's also of course the threat at the North Dakota campus
[27:03.240 --> 27:06.600]  it's been cleared we've now confirmed what you told us about 10 minutes ago
[27:06.600 --> 27:12.920]  off air that the nuclear reactor in North Austin that UT runs along with their
[27:12.920 --> 27:21.080]  rail guns and particle beam weapon system that whole campus has been evacuated as
[27:21.080 --> 27:26.160]  well that's a closed campus I don't I don't see the point in doing that maybe
[27:26.160 --> 27:32.280]  they should shut down all the other UT campuses across Texas maybe they said
[27:32.280 --> 27:36.280]  actually there's a bunch of students milling around down here we're driving
[27:36.280 --> 27:41.360]  through right now we're in the heart of campus and if this is really serious and
[27:41.360 --> 27:46.720]  it's a big deal these people shouldn't all still be here so there's tons of
[27:46.720 --> 27:49.680]  students just standing around they're like they're not sure what to do well
[27:49.680 --> 27:54.640]  some of the reports I saw were that it was going to be a 90 minutes after the
[27:54.640 --> 28:00.320]  call there was an hour and almost an hour and a half ago effectively an hour
[28:00.320 --> 28:05.160]  and a half in one minute so supposedly aren't the bombs supposed to go off in
[28:05.160 --> 28:11.800]  about 60 seconds Melissa basically yes we just passed a huge group of what look
[28:11.800 --> 28:15.160]  like transportation workers or construction workers just all standing
[28:15.160 --> 28:20.480]  around so unless unless somebody knows something we don't apparently yeah we're
[28:20.480 --> 28:26.280]  about to all get blown up but nobody seems to care well I'm sure TSA will
[28:26.280 --> 28:29.480]  keep us safe they're now all over Texas streets sticking their hands down
[28:29.480 --> 28:34.280]  people's bags soon will be down their pants would you feel safer guys if you
[28:34.280 --> 28:40.400]  had some TSA there I wish the TSA was here don't you John oh yeah they would be
[28:40.400 --> 28:46.360]  a big hill yeah and you know Alex you there it's John yes sir yeah you remember
[28:46.360 --> 28:51.120]  last year when that shooter went inside the building here it looked like the
[28:51.120 --> 28:56.480]  Colorado shooting like a pretty Colorado shooting yes yeah and that that was
[28:56.480 --> 29:02.000]  they were ready for drills on that as well so I think what we're seeing is
[29:02.000 --> 29:06.520]  completely staged everyone seems to that's right they had drills right
[29:06.520 --> 29:10.160]  before the guy what went in and shot himself and they also you're saying
[29:10.160 --> 29:13.080]  people said there were that there were a bunch of drills right before this what
[29:13.080 --> 29:17.720]  did they specifically say they just said that they were ready for evacuation
[29:17.720 --> 29:22.320]  drills and that this they didn't even believe this was real because they've
[29:22.320 --> 29:28.040]  been given so many drills at this point so people aren't surprised here they're
[29:28.040 --> 29:34.160]  they're getting used to the fear well that's what you go to college for now
[29:34.160 --> 29:37.960]  and there's not gonna be any jobs with those degrees you go there to learn how
[29:37.960 --> 29:41.960]  to spy on people how to be spied on how to be forced to take inoculations and
[29:41.960 --> 29:46.520]  how to basically get cancer and die and how to live in a police state we'll be

[34:25.880 --> 34:30.160]  in about 90% of the cases will be absolutely useful for them. Most of my
[34:30.160 --> 34:32.880]  family went to UT. I'm not attacking University of Texas. It's just not a
[34:32.880 --> 34:38.200]  university anymore. It's a brainwashing facility that engages in a lot of
[34:38.200 --> 34:42.920]  weapons development and they've got rail guns, particle beam guns that are
[34:42.920 --> 34:48.000]  public, and multiple nuclear reactors still going. They've got one under UT
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.440]  downtown and a big one up north one of the biggest research reactors in the
[34:52.440 --> 34:58.840]  country. They've evacuated the nuclear reactor. So just know that because
[34:58.840 --> 35:05.800]  somebody called in and said, I have put the bombs in your mailboxes. All of
[35:05.800 --> 35:09.440]  this right as they want to attack the Middle East, right as this video comes
[35:09.440 --> 35:13.600]  out to get everybody angry, it's probably staged or it could be somebody
[35:13.600 --> 35:17.880]  who's actually mad and making threats or it could be somebody that wanted to get
[35:17.880 --> 35:22.560]  out of taking tests today or it could just be some troublemaker. I mean, we
[35:22.560 --> 35:26.080]  don't know. The point is that we have our reporters there and them I get into the
[35:26.080 --> 35:28.920]  big news of the day, the quantitative easing and what's happening in the
[35:28.920 --> 35:33.800]  Middle East. I had a Ben Swan. You've seen that Fox News reporter that's
[35:33.800 --> 35:38.320]  making so many waves, I think better than National Fox News. He's the newest
[35:38.320 --> 35:42.280]  member of Fox 19 news team and he's been there a couple years, I guess, and he's
[35:42.280 --> 35:48.160]  done all these reports on did the RNC script rule changes at the start of a
[35:48.160 --> 35:52.120]  civil war in the Republican Party. He's the guy last week that got to talk to
[35:52.120 --> 35:57.840]  Obama about the NDAA. He's the guy that questioned what happened there in
[35:57.840 --> 36:01.920]  Colorado and I said, you know what? I've just got a feeling that guy's a listener.
[36:01.920 --> 36:07.160]  We need to get him on and of course he is a listener of the show and so he's
[36:07.160 --> 36:12.360]  going to be popping in during some of the next hour and we're maybe going to
[36:12.360 --> 36:16.440]  play a few short clips of some of his reports. Pretty amazing stuff. That's a
[36:16.440 --> 36:20.040]  real reporter right there asking serious questions and it's others that he
[36:20.040 --> 36:22.760]  asked good questions. I mean it looks like something you'd see on national TV
[36:22.760 --> 36:26.480]  except they don't cover stuff like that on national TV but he's getting a
[36:26.480 --> 36:30.680]  national following out there so he's going to be popping in with us in the
[36:30.680 --> 36:35.320]  next hour even though it's a busy news day for him. In a moment we're going to
[36:35.320 --> 36:39.480]  get to New Banker bailout disguised as QE3. That's our top story today. It is so
[36:39.480 --> 36:42.720]  important that everybody get this out to everyone they know wherever we're going
[36:42.720 --> 36:52.800]  to stop this madness. But first, going back to John Bowne and Melissa
[36:52.800 --> 36:58.960]  Melton, guys are you there with us in downtown Austin at UT? Oh yeah. We
[36:58.960 --> 37:03.880]  actually moved positions. We're closer to the heart of the campus and there are a
[37:03.880 --> 37:08.360]  lot more students out here evacuated. We've got more news crews over here and I
[37:08.360 --> 37:12.640]  guess we're about five minutes away from what the bombers said. The bomb will go
[37:12.640 --> 37:17.480]  off so we're just going to wait on that. We're going to get some replies from the
[37:17.480 --> 37:22.600]  public. Well there's varying stories but the AP and Huffington Post reporting the
[37:22.600 --> 37:29.920]  call was at 8.35 a.m. central then they said that it was past 9 o'clock so we're
[37:29.920 --> 37:34.360]  we're two hours actually past this but I mean who knows they may shut it for
[37:34.360 --> 37:39.560]  weeks because it teaches everyone proper fear and again I mean I could play a
[37:39.560 --> 37:42.600]  clip of that who what's the name of that guy that has the puppet that says I will
[37:42.600 --> 37:48.720]  kill you it's you know the dead terrorist. What's the name of that guy? I can't
[37:48.720 --> 37:51.800]  remember the guy's name. Come on we all know the name what's the name of the guy
[37:51.800 --> 37:56.080]  that has the has the puppet that the Habib the dead terrorist or whatever it
[37:56.080 --> 38:04.160]  is. Oh he won on that show on TV the America's Got Talent or something? Yeah
[38:04.160 --> 38:08.120]  what's his name again you got Jeff Dunham yeah that's it yeah yeah I mean
[38:08.120 --> 38:13.640]  imagine 310 million Americans running off the edge of a cliff just in fear with
[38:13.640 --> 38:18.200]  their eyes wide swabber coming out their mouth screaming stumbling breaking
[38:18.200 --> 38:22.400]  each other's necks running over each other piling off the edge of a cliff
[38:22.400 --> 38:28.880]  right into the hands of JP Morgan Chase Coleman Sacks New World Order in fear
[38:28.880 --> 38:34.800]  of a one foot tall Habib the dead terrorist going I will kill you I mean
[38:34.800 --> 38:38.720]  I wonder how much money these drills cost to do and you know they're making
[38:38.720 --> 38:44.240]  sure this one's successful you know and it's not a success these people are
[38:44.240 --> 38:49.280]  walking around scratching their heads you know some people are scared some
[38:49.280 --> 38:53.360]  people are just so completely desensitized by what they've done with
[38:53.360 --> 39:00.320]  these drills over and over and over again that it's just a big jam. John you
[39:00.320 --> 39:05.000]  noticed that in the months before 9-11 they had more than 10 bomb threats and
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.600]  cleared the north and south towers in lower Manhattan you know that but then
[39:10.600 --> 39:15.120]  on the day they had loudspeakers saying stay at your desk everything's fine
[39:15.120 --> 39:20.120]  when jetliners had hit the buildings what do you think was going on there
[39:20.120 --> 39:27.920]  3-planned well I mean who's ready to say stay at your desk who's got that all
[39:27.920 --> 39:31.480]  written down and ready to go and by the way that was confirmed that went on and
[39:31.480 --> 39:36.280]  some people said well some authority over a loudspeaker you know airplanes
[39:36.280 --> 39:39.440]  have crashed into buildings there's fires everywhere they're saying stay at
[39:39.440 --> 39:43.800]  my desk so I think I will I think I will. From the Colorado shooting where there
[39:43.800 --> 39:49.240]  apparently there was something going on over the loudspeaker there too you know.
[39:49.240 --> 39:54.760]  Well I mean sure Operation Northwoods calls for shooting US citizens on the
[39:54.760 --> 39:58.840]  streets and in movie theaters and stuff but and sure Operation Gladio
[39:58.840 --> 40:02.980]  declassified they shot up movie theaters and stuff to take people's rights in
[40:02.980 --> 40:08.560]  Europe but you know what they wouldn't do that now I mean sure they'd take 4,000
[40:08.560 --> 40:12.080]  plus foster kids in the US and radiate them to death and shoot little kids up
[40:12.080 --> 40:16.920]  with syphilis and nerve gas our own trips by the thousands in Project Shad but
[40:16.920 --> 40:22.880]  you know what they wouldn't stage a bomb threat John good people run our
[40:22.880 --> 40:26.880]  government John. Yeah I'm you know reporting here from the experimental
[40:26.880 --> 40:33.880]  madhouse they call the University of Texas funded by globalist madmen this
[40:33.880 --> 40:38.240]  is basically a foreign entity and they're running a drill today from their
[40:38.240 --> 40:43.840]  from their entity here in the United States and it's we're getting so
[40:43.840 --> 40:48.600]  defensetized from all this we need to just turn the machine around and give
[40:48.600 --> 40:52.280]  her these people because it's too obvious. I'm convinced that if giant flying
[40:52.280 --> 40:57.320]  saucers landed from Mars like War the Worlds it had telescoping you know
[40:57.320 --> 41:03.040]  tripod legs and were laser-beaming people as long as there was a Bevo or your
[41:03.040 --> 41:08.840]  your favorite local sports icon on the side you know the UT Longhorn symbol
[41:08.840 --> 41:12.720]  people would walk out with their children and say vaporize me and it would
[41:12.720 --> 41:16.840]  just fire and destroy them and they would just. Well you know if Al Qaeda was smart
[41:16.840 --> 41:25.800]  they would blow up Bevo. I know it's blasphemous right here but. Oh my gosh well
[41:25.800 --> 41:32.080]  the CIA don't give them ideas Al CIA don't don't don't give them but their
[41:32.080 --> 41:37.120]  Al Qaeda is busy with NATO aircraft NATO helicopters landing them there in
[41:37.120 --> 41:42.960]  Turkey and in Jordan to go in and murder the Christians and Jews and people but
[41:42.960 --> 41:46.760]  but but Al Qaeda Al Qaeda is dangerous though because they you know they just
[41:46.760 --> 41:51.080]  threatened UT though John. Yeah and that you know now the CIA is getting into the
[41:51.080 --> 41:54.920]  movie business the Muhammad movie maybe they'll have a sequel to that where they
[41:54.920 --> 42:01.320]  blow up Bevo. Well well well it's not like John don't start a rumor people will
[42:01.320 --> 42:07.480]  be be be body shields you know here take my wife guard Bevo you know yeah I mean
[42:07.480 --> 42:11.120]  in fact in fact don't give them ideas they may like say we've got to like
[42:11.120 --> 42:14.600]  throw our children into meat grinders because Bevo has to walk across a red
[42:14.600 --> 42:18.800]  carpet of ground-up children because he's so I mean it's it's it's it's the
[42:18.800 --> 42:26.920]  golden calf. Yep and and he's delicious. All right listen John I know we're
[42:26.920 --> 42:30.680]  joking around in the John you should take this more serious why these bombs
[42:30.680 --> 42:35.680]  were supposed to have gone off depending on some reports an hour ago. Yeah you need
[42:35.680 --> 42:38.920]  to be more you need to be more afraid I mean even though you've got a better
[42:38.920 --> 42:42.880]  chance of being struck twice in a year by lightning than dying from a bomb in
[42:42.880 --> 42:47.920]  the United States is all these movies the Joker was blowing up universities and
[42:47.920 --> 42:53.160]  stuff and hospitals I mean it's real I mean we need TSA they're now saying at
[42:53.160 --> 42:57.000]  every movie theater people are suing the movie theater demanding grown-downs at
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  the theater even though the guy came to the back door reportedly and somebody
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.880]  letting man but never mind that I mean you should get more into the fear John.
[43:03.880 --> 43:08.040]  Yeah I guess I missed the boat on that one because I'm actually a lot more
[43:08.040 --> 43:12.200]  afraid of the stupidity of the public. Well I'm afraid of the big giant out of
[43:12.200 --> 43:16.440]  control government buying 1.4 billion bullets and and buying armored
[43:16.440 --> 43:21.240]  mobile giant tanks and helicopters and drones and and in their own training
[43:21.240 --> 43:25.520]  manuals saying that they're preparing to take on the American people I mean I'll
[43:25.520 --> 43:30.320]  that's okay Alex that's okay that's you know that that's great that's that's
[43:30.320 --> 43:37.960]  freedom that's freedom fries Alex. Well I tell you John any other tidbits you'd
[43:37.960 --> 43:42.520]  like to have before I have Melissa Milton say some final words from the fear
[43:42.520 --> 43:46.400]  gripping Austin right now from the bombs that depending on the report would
[43:46.400 --> 43:50.120]  have gone off an hour ago or 15 minutes ago but who knows I mean those bombs
[43:50.120 --> 43:53.560]  could be there in a hundred years we should evacuate like a neutron bomb hit
[43:53.560 --> 43:57.920]  Austin all of UT forever because a guy with a Middle Eastern sounding voice
[43:57.920 --> 44:04.360]  called up and said I have put the bombs in email boxes American pig. Well you
[44:04.360 --> 44:07.720]  know they got to pay these police to do something out here and then there's a lot
[44:07.720 --> 44:11.680]  of unmarked cars good and though those got to be paid for too and they've got
[44:11.680 --> 44:17.080]  to have something to do. Other than writing tickets you mean? Yeah instead of
[44:17.080 --> 44:23.520]  writing tickets generating more revenue for the city. Let me get some
[44:23.520 --> 44:26.640]  final comments from Melissa Milton before I get to our top story that we can't
[44:26.640 --> 44:31.240]  cover because of the bomb threats. Go ahead Melissa yes are you scared right
[44:31.240 --> 44:36.640]  now? I'm absolutely terrified right now I really wish the TSA was here that
[44:36.640 --> 44:41.120]  broke me down and make sure that I'm not covered in bombs. Well you might
[44:41.120 --> 44:45.320]  actually be the person that did it all. I know we were headed here for another
[44:45.320 --> 44:51.480]  interview and then this suddenly happened so possible. Everyone else doesn't seem to
[44:51.480 --> 44:55.480]  be afraid at all though. I forgot that you're down there you're down there
[44:55.480 --> 44:59.520]  to interview the UT professor. Well actually I don't want to give it away have
[44:59.520 --> 45:03.600]  you gotten that interview yet or this already happened? We're about to do that
[45:03.600 --> 45:07.560]  we were headed here for that purpose and then we couldn't even get on campus
[45:07.560 --> 45:12.280]  because they were closing off streets and so I'm gonna try and get it after this
[45:12.280 --> 45:17.280]  but might have to postpone it. I don't know he might be really afraid because he
[45:17.280 --> 45:23.360]  might be scared he's gonna blow up. Any other points Melissa? I just think it's
[45:23.360 --> 45:27.600]  really sad it's a sad testament to see how far we've fallen that all these
[45:27.600 --> 45:31.440]  people are just milling around they don't seem to even care. I mean the few
[45:31.440 --> 45:36.060]  students that I talked to were afraid but it was only way after the fact they
[45:36.060 --> 45:39.080]  were just so desensitized by all the drills and all the things that have been
[45:39.080 --> 45:42.840]  going on that they just kind of walking around like okay we'll get blown up
[45:42.840 --> 45:46.800]  that's fine I don't care. It's very sad. Well just thank goodness Homeland
[45:46.800 --> 45:51.560]  Security's there to keep us safe and ship guns into Mexico and fund Alcada and
[45:51.560 --> 45:55.800]  give them 10,000 missiles in Libya and again we've got to give our rights up.
[45:55.800 --> 45:59.040]  I mean Alcada is so evil and deadly that our government runs it publicly.
[45:59.040 --> 46:02.720]  They're everywhere. They're everywhere. We need to be safe.
[46:02.720 --> 46:06.840]  Well I will thank you for your courage because I was like how are they
[46:06.840 --> 46:09.840]  already down there when I got here to the office and then they're like oh they
[46:09.840 --> 46:12.840]  were down there doing an interview and I'd forgotten you were going down to you
[46:12.840 --> 46:17.800]  were going down to interview the the professor who well let's just say has
[46:17.800 --> 46:21.880]  some interesting statements so I look forward to having that information thank
[46:21.880 --> 46:26.160]  you Melissa. Definitely thank you. Call back into the hotline anything else that
[46:26.160 --> 46:31.920]  develops down there at UT gripped now for two and a half hours in just total
[46:31.920 --> 46:39.600]  fear. City shut down. Nuclear reactor on a closed campus evacuated. I mean end of
[46:39.600 --> 46:46.080]  the world stuff. Somebody called up with a scary Middle Eastern accent. Man that's
[46:46.080 --> 46:50.680]  not gonna be a new weapons system. These were drones fly around with people you
[46:50.680 --> 46:54.800]  know with daily calls to prayer and everyone would just fall over dead.
[46:54.800 --> 47:00.160]  All right let's shift gears to the real news. Okay I've got articles here with
[47:00.160 --> 47:05.960]  press conferences by top scientists where where new GMO crops hitting store
[47:05.960 --> 47:11.920]  shelves are linked to reprogramming your organs to turn off. But hey that'll make
[47:11.920 --> 47:15.280]  more money for the hospitals. Nobody noticed pediatric cancer is up by 10
[47:15.280 --> 47:18.680]  thousand percent. Nobody noticed other cancers up by three thousand percent.
[47:18.680 --> 47:23.600]  Cheryl Crowe I mean got a brain tumor after breast cancer. It's kind of like
[47:23.600 --> 47:28.440]  getting a cold now to get brain cancer. So everything's fine. Let's not worry
[47:28.440 --> 47:35.560]  about all that. Let's not worry about QE3 or QE unlimited. The QE big gulp big
[47:35.560 --> 47:40.960]  bite and of course it was QE1 QE2 and we promised never QE3. See we we told you
[47:40.960 --> 47:45.960]  we keep our promise. It's gonna be called unlimited continual. We're gonna be
[47:45.960 --> 47:49.400]  breaking that down ahead of our guests joining us in the second segment of the
[47:49.400 --> 47:55.560]  next hour. But this article is big medicine up at info wars.com. You might
[47:55.560 --> 47:59.000]  want to Twitter this out. We'll send it down the real Alex Jones at Twitter. You
[47:59.000 --> 48:02.120]  might want to retweet this. You might want to put it on your Facebook. You
[48:02.120 --> 48:05.680]  might want to get it out to your family so they know that when they hear oh the
[48:05.680 --> 48:10.920]  government's doing some stimulus for you. This is another banker bailout on
[48:10.920 --> 48:16.360]  what? What it even CNN report. In fact guys I am that to you but I want to just
[48:16.360 --> 48:21.640]  show people CNN itself admitting it. We have the Fed statement linked here in
[48:21.640 --> 48:25.000]  the article. 40 billion a month and there's gonna be some other ones they're
[48:25.000 --> 48:34.120]  gonna do to buy a securitized derivatives mortgage instruments. A whole
[48:34.120 --> 48:39.440]  spectrum of them. 40 billion a month to buy the fraudulent crud and you know the
[48:39.440 --> 48:42.360]  Federal Reserve with all the quantitative easing they do to the banks
[48:42.360 --> 48:46.320]  which is just a tax to them a payoff not even a bailout. You get to pay
[48:46.320 --> 48:50.960]  it back in taxes and they're gonna squeeze it out of you. In federal state
[48:50.960 --> 48:55.440]  property taxes it all gets tickets the cops write you that money all gets
[48:55.440 --> 49:00.200]  fenced back through city budgets and the rest of it. It all goes to the offshore
[49:00.200 --> 49:04.440]  banks and the media will tell you it's your debt. There it is. The policy known
[49:04.440 --> 49:09.480]  as quantitative easing and often abbreviated to QE3 entails buying 40
[49:09.480 --> 49:13.760]  billion in mortgage backed securities each month. The end date remains up in the
[49:13.760 --> 49:17.760]  air as the Fed will reevaluate the strength of the economy in coming
[49:17.760 --> 49:21.120]  months. Folks they're shutting down the real economy. The big banks on record
[49:21.120 --> 49:28.840]  will not loan. Will not loan. Say that again. Will not loan. Since they've gotten
[49:28.840 --> 49:35.600]  40 something trillion dollars one way or another what 870 billion folks. Tens of
[49:35.600 --> 49:39.320]  trillions of dollars they've leveraged. They've put it into more derivatives. More
[49:39.320 --> 49:44.800]  crud had cities counties pension funds government minions invest everything in
[49:44.800 --> 49:49.760]  it so that our whole world is tied to a black hole of fraud. While they demonize
[49:49.760 --> 49:54.840]  lemonade stands and the Amish trying to and pass all these regulations to
[49:54.840 --> 49:59.400]  shut down family farms and pay to ship our jobs overseas and have tax incentives
[49:59.400 --> 50:04.880]  to ship them overseas. That's the grand plan. And then the big banks what did they
[50:04.880 --> 50:08.640]  do? Oh we're gonna give them trillions to loan to get the economy going. That'd be
[50:08.640 --> 50:13.080]  bad enough but at least it would get the economy going. Even if it inflated the
[50:13.080 --> 50:20.320]  currency some. Instead they're in they're devaluing the currency while so
[50:20.320 --> 50:23.920]  you're gonna double whammy. You're not getting the extra money but it does
[50:23.920 --> 50:29.840]  devalue the currency. So it things do go up in price but not as much only in
[50:29.840 --> 50:34.760]  luxury items yachts $500,000 cars palaces mansions
[50:34.760 --> 50:40.200]  penthouses that that that is seeing some of the greatest inflation ever because
[50:40.200 --> 50:45.400]  the money all goes to them and you're gonna pay it off in taxes and that's
[50:45.400 --> 50:49.400]  why they're getting 1.4 billion bullets and giant black tanks and turning the
[50:49.400 --> 50:52.800]  general cops all into SWAT teams because they're getting ready to stop your

[54:26.020 --> 54:31.120]  unreal that's what happens with tyranny stuff gets really crazy and it's so
[54:31.120 --> 54:35.400]  clear we're in a psychological warfare operation the mega banks actually
[54:35.400 --> 54:38.960]  brag I mean I've listened to Bloomberg radio where they have all these big
[54:38.960 --> 54:42.080]  bankers on bragging that they're conquering Europe and then they're
[54:42.080 --> 54:45.440]  gonna have a federation and that they're bankrupting the nation states and
[54:45.440 --> 54:49.400]  how they're gonna get rid of football teams named after countries the soccer
[54:49.400 --> 54:53.800]  teams and make it all be named after the euro and how they're gonna set up a
[54:53.800 --> 54:58.520]  global government and it's just all over the place what they're doing but
[54:58.520 --> 55:03.600]  then they're on the main news for the general public going oh we're gonna 40
[55:03.600 --> 55:09.000]  billion a month to help get the economy going while they privately order the
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.520]  banks not to loan to people that came out because that would cause hyper
[55:13.520 --> 55:18.480]  inflation instead there's only hyper inflation and it's basically started I
[55:18.480 --> 55:21.880]  mean some luxuries are up a hundred percent a year three years running
[55:21.880 --> 55:27.160]  because these people have unlimited money ladies and gentlemen and you're
[55:27.160 --> 55:31.920]  paying for it you're paying for it and that's why I get somatic cops when they
[55:31.920 --> 55:36.800]  pull you over or you know white glove you get me getting in your face I want to
[55:36.800 --> 55:40.160]  go to Ted Anderson here to talk about this and said let's just get you back
[55:40.160 --> 55:43.200]  on cuz I wanted to do a whole interview and I went off on this stupid bomb
[55:43.200 --> 55:48.320]  threat issue but this article that we've got I just had it and I was out there
[55:48.320 --> 55:52.320]  showing him the article I need the article it's the top info wars com
[55:52.320 --> 55:55.880]  article and I was showing them that I wanted to tweet it out at real Alex
[55:55.880 --> 56:04.520]  Jones so it's it's gone it's the top info wars com story there at info wars
[56:04.520 --> 56:11.200]  com new banker bailout disguised as QE3 Ted reported this on Monday no one was
[56:11.200 --> 56:14.440]  even reporting it the Fed said yeah we're just gonna look at ongoing it's
[56:14.440 --> 56:18.640]  not even QE3 it's to whoever they want and that's what Obama's saying we'll
[56:18.640 --> 56:22.440]  bail out businesses not just GM that means all their buddies will get free
[56:22.440 --> 56:27.760]  money like MSNBC got a half billion dollars of stimulus money and did not
[56:27.760 --> 56:33.440]  hire one person they gave all those anti-american scum collaborators giant
[56:33.440 --> 56:40.080]  raises to sit up there and put down my country and to run pieces hell it's bad
[56:40.080 --> 56:44.760]  to talk show host like Alex Jones have advertising and make money and sell
[56:44.760 --> 56:50.680]  things we sell things people want we voluntarily fund our operation while
[56:50.680 --> 56:55.840]  these pigs live off our money and they and they they call this capitalism and
[56:55.840 --> 57:01.040]  blame capitalism for their crony fraud takeover Ted I'm ranting and I wanted to
[57:01.040 --> 57:04.560]  get you up here about QE3 and not do an infomercial for gold but you are the
[57:04.560 --> 57:09.960]  name in gold and silver and gold went up what almost 50 bucks yesterday it's up
[57:09.960 --> 57:14.680]  and down today but we said when they announced QE3 get ready all the big
[57:14.680 --> 57:18.640]  analysts are saying Ted $2,000 gold by the end of the year I don't know if
[57:18.640 --> 57:22.080]  that's the case but I know they're devaluing my dollar and that's why I'm
[57:22.080 --> 57:26.480]  in gold and silver Ted Anderson well yeah I mean you should be in gold and
[57:26.480 --> 57:31.440]  silver because they're printing paper and they're liquefying the the money
[57:31.440 --> 57:35.720]  supply I mean there what there's gonna be so much money in the marketplace and
[57:35.720 --> 57:39.000]  you're talking about 40 billion dollars that they're announcing but if you go
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.840]  in and you read that Fed report actually after they consider everything
[57:42.840 --> 57:47.160]  they're doing it's actually 85 billion each month month of new money that's
[57:47.160 --> 57:50.600]  being placed into the system and that's competing with the money that we
[57:50.600 --> 57:56.000]  already have how much money again say that again Ted how much 85 billion if
[57:56.000 --> 58:01.840]  you it we have a PDF version of the of the open market that the the board of

[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:19.520]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:28.480]  Alex Jones all right Ted Anderson's weather some other five minutes and Ted
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:36.680]  let me just have you back on let me just have you back on for the whole third
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.240]  hour of you can do it to actually get into monetary issues and not just sit
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.680]  here and pitch gold and silver and again we pitch things we believe in which
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:49.520]  then funds our operation but that's why I get so excited about all this because
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.480]  I believe in it I just called Ted last week and Ted you've been so busy I asked
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.480]  what you thought the best of the radio specials were you were gonna call me back
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:01.080]  was gonna get a few gold coins and silver and Ted you didn't call me back so I
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.200]  need to call one of your brokers don't know yeah well no we'll get it done but
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.800]  I can tell you right now watching the charts yesterday silver and gold both it
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.960]  was just it was just coming along and going and then all of a sudden a spike
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:21.360]  upward I mean to have a $46 increase in gold in one day and about $4.60 in
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:25.680]  silver in one day are you kidding me and that's just quantitative easing that's
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:31.040]  just the news breaking the FOMC Open Market Committee comes out and they
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:34.800]  decide that they're gonna get into this quantitative easing but like you say it's
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:40.240]  not called QE3 the reason why that is is because QE2 had an end date to it and a
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.040]  goal and this is how much we're gonna do this is open-ended quantitative easing
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:47.720]  they said that we're gonna continue to print more money and to get the
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.160]  printing presses rolling until they see the economic results that they're
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:56.200]  looking for and basically it's just an open-ended thing we're heading off of a
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.880]  cliff Alex and if people aren't smart enough to get out of paper I mean I don't
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:06.080]  care find you know buy buy storeable foods I don't care what you buy but get
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:10.680]  just to get yourself out of it the you predicted this Porter Stansbury
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:16.840]  predicted it Gerald Salente predicted it they all predicted it we all predicted
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:21.840]  it and it means curtains in fact I have a clip of Ron Paul here this is Ron Paul
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.840]  last night saying we should be panicking over this and Ron Paul's never
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:33.560]  talked like that this means inflation and because it's not targeted there's a
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:38.840]  real turning up the printing presses that at least helps the people on one
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:43.720]  level this is all pointed at the ultra-rich it's gonna be a double whammy
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:48.000]  here's Ron Paul the one thing that Bernanke has not achieved that frustrates
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.160]  him I can tell is he gets no economic growth he doesn't do anything with the
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.480]  unemployment numbers and from my viewpoint I think the country should have
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.040]  panicked over the fact of what the Fed is saying that we've lost control the
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.880]  only thing we have left is massively creating new money out of thin air which
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.440]  hasn't worked before and it's not going to work this time you know Ted I'm going
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.320]  to be honest you know me privately I'm very calm very intellectual very focused
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:17.120]  until I get on air and then I turn into the wild man because I get so angry
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:23.840]  about this stuff but I don't do it on purpose but intellectually this has been
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:30.280]  like a bomb being dropped on us and I'm so angry that I even sarcastically made
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.440]  fun of the fake UT bomb threat for the first 45 minutes of the show instead of
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.440]  really talking about the full magnitude of this unlimited QE I mean but but but
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:45.280]  as Ron Paul just said this means that this is all they've got and they're
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.720]  going to use it to transfer wealth you know Ron Paul says they're trying to
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.760]  fix it look the globalists admit they've engineered this so it's time to stop
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.560]  saying they don't know what they're doing they're in control they run a global
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:01.360]  government they know exactly what they're doing Ted I'm not knocking Ron
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:04.120]  Paul here but you know he gives them this thing that they don't know what
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.960]  they're doing I've been saying for over a decade this was coming exactly as it
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:11.960]  has George Humphrey's been saying it for 14 years economist friend of mine this
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.480]  is an engineered collapse Ted I know you've been you've been talking about
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:21.160]  that and I've alluded to that as well the very system that set up creates debt
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.240]  you know money from debt is going to just mean more debt as the economy grows
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.480]  we'll get further into the whole they hold the debt listen can you do a full
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.440]  hour with us and take calls yeah we'll go ahead and do that on the third hour
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.400]  I'll see you back in 55 minutes Ted all right sounds good folks give minus
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.240]  resources a call ask them about radio specials that's where I get my gold and
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:45.000]  silver and again I bought gold at $260 an ounce I didn't sell it when it hit
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.720]  2000 when it dropped down to 1650 I didn't sell sending with silver I bought
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:55.080]  silver at $5 an ounce when it got up to 40 45 50 bucks an ounce I didn't sell
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.400]  any of it when it went down I didn't sell it because I understand what's
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:03.600]  happening the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.320]  2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.840]  in drought conditions only corn of soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:17.240]  all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.800]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.880]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:29.400]  supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases

[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:50.080]  order well I tell you we are really excited to have this fellow on because
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:58.840]  last year or so he has exploded on the scene with Fox 19 television and he's
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.800]  also worked at other TV stations around the country and he just absolutely
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:09.080]  knocks it out of the park on pro-second amendment stuff on covering how Ron Paul
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.000]  the Liberty Movement were shafted by the Republican establishment he got
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.600]  interviewed with with President Obama last week we're gonna play a clip of
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:22.080]  later where he really nails him down on the NDAA and secret arrest of American
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:27.760]  citizens the byway of federal court two days ago did a permanent injunction
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.600]  of course we had Chris Hedges on the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:35.360]  was part of that suit now Obama is appealing to the Supreme Court he also
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:43.880]  has looked at some of the anomalies of the shootings there in Colorado so
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:51.200]  basically he's like a professional focused you know kind of new style Alex
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:55.960]  Jones which which which I love we need more people that have courage and I
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.320]  think this guy's going places let me tell you because he's got it all and it is
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:05.240]  so exciting to see reporters like this now I'll say this I remember Bill O'Reilly
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:11.760]  on Fox television 13 years ago interviewing people like Tony Brown
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:16.240]  about the Illuminati in the New World Order and I saw him on extra was it
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.160]  hard copy 20 something years ago we have the tape we played it exposing how the
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:27.680]  government and E Howard Hunt basically killed JFK so I hope that Ben Swan of
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:32.360]  you know ends up on national television doesn't turn over to the dark side like
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.840]  like Bill O'Reilly but but I got to tell you it's just great to have him on and
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:40.080]  know there's other people out there in fact if you're a radio listener if you
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.320]  could see him we bring him up on Skype you know who I'm talking about but in a
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.920]  few minutes I will play some clips and you'll know who we're talking about but
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:53.200]  Ben it is great to have you on with us here today Alex thanks for having me on
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:59.520]  I appreciate it so tell us about your awakening I mean how they allow you in
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:04.040]  mainstream television to tell the truth you know a lot of people are asking that
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.440]  question and how we get to cover the things that we do and I just I'm really
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:12.160]  blessed I work at a TV station that is not owned by Fox or Fox affiliate and
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:15.640]  because of that a lot of people assume that we're owned by Fox we're not we're
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:20.120]  owned by Raycom media and and I work for guys who are just interested in getting
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:24.280]  out factual information and so we've had a tremendous response I think the
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:28.640]  response that we've gotten from people has been just beyond expectation far
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:32.480]  above beyond expectation and people are really hungry for it they're hungry for
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:37.320]  someone who will look beyond you know the typical mainstream narrative and
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:40.960]  obviously I mean this is no surprise to you because clearly you know the the
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:46.360]  issue with alternative media is it is growing so fast right now versus what's
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.960]  happening with national media or mainstream media which is essentially
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:52.840]  dying right now and there's a reason for that I mean people have already heard
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:56.720]  all these same types of narratives before and they're tired of them and
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.120]  they're moving beyond them and so we're fortunate to be kind of a bridge I think
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:04.200]  between alternative media and mainstream media by the way I should add they give
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:10.400]  you leeway because you have won both the Edward R. Murrow award and two Emmys
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:16.880]  that you got I guess reporting from Texas so so I mean I mean you are quite
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.600]  the journalist and so you're actually really doing real research it's just
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:25.760]  it's amazing and again mainstream media would still be dominant if people like
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:30.920]  you were on the national scene how long have you been there in Cincinnati for
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.360]  about a year and a half just just a little over a year and a half and about
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:39.640]  two to three months after I came to this station we had this idea that we were
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.440]  gonna try something different because it was time to kind of rebrand ourselves a
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:48.040]  little bit and we moved towards a balanced news brand which again sounds
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.320]  very much like the Fox brand and so there are advantages to that but then
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.120]  there are some disadvantages because there are some people who go into it
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:59.520]  automatically thinking well you're just you know little mini Fox news and part
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.480]  of that balance brand was to do this segment called reality check where we
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:07.960]  look beyond headlines and actually hold politicians accountable I'm not sure my
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.360]  boss has realized how accountable we were gonna hold them but so far they've
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.800]  been extremely supportive of it and we're doing our best to get out there and
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.400]  get to the facts how did you get the Obama interview and then give us some of
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.880]  the behind the scenes we're gonna play a clip of it in a moment but I mean pretty
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:27.720]  amazing out of a sea of journalists and so-called mainstream media no one will
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:31.120]  ever ask him a hard question we know now that for the first time ever they're
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:37.040]  vetting the questions beforehand there in the press briefing room and also when
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:42.120]  Obama goes out and gives official press conferences you obviously got off script
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:46.080]  there and actually did your job well you know with with the Obama interview and
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:50.960]  it's pretty simple I mean he's been very good about doing these interviews with
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:54.840]  local media everywhere he goes and it's actually a very good strategy because
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.160]  but you wind up having our reporters who go out and ask a number of questions
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:04.000]  typically they're locally focused so in the case of Ohio they'll ask about the
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.400]  auto industry they're gonna ask about jobs in Ohio the economy which is
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.440]  actually doing better than in a lot of places in the nation and so it's really
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.240]  a good place for him to do those interviews but he does them everywhere
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:18.080]  and we were just next on the list and as we went down the list and they gave us
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.840]  the call and said you know send somebody up and it was us I think one of the
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:26.800]  advantages that I had was the week before we had done a one-on-one with Mitt
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:31.120]  Romney and Paul Ryan together and when we sat down with them you know we weren't
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.120]  easy on them and one of the questions we asked Romney about was how you know his
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:40.320]  campaign along with the RNC had worked to decrudential and essentially
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:44.680]  disenfranchise all of these Republican delegates from the state of Maine and so
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.440]  we were hard on Romney and I think that they suspected I don't know this but I
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.280]  think they suspected we would probably not be as hard on the president because
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.400]  as you know Alex I mean that's the way media works in this country you either
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:01.320]  support one side and then attack the other or vice versa so you know they
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:05.000]  allowed us to come in and do the interview they put no prerequisites on it just
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.880]  told us you have five minutes and when your five minutes is up you know you're
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:12.880]  done and so we went from there incredible we're gonna play a clip of that
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.080]  right now in fact here it is from the intro of the news piece folks can go to
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:22.720]  fox19.com and watch the whole thing and I should add other Fox affiliates
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.440]  around the country who are on YouTube are lucky to get a few thousand views
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.040]  even a big stories your stories are getting hundreds of thousands and
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:35.920]  millions of views again showing that the future is real reporting real questions
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:39.200]  there's no debate the NDA is unconstitutional the courts have already
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:43.600]  ruled it there's no debate it's super scary right out of Nazi Germany so media
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.400]  though just acts like oh we're gonna be you know non-biased well I mean a ham
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:53.120]  sandwich is a ham sandwich a draconian piece of legislation is draconian and
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:57.880]  that's the end of it I mean you have to report the facts you've done that and the
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:01.680]  media can take a cue from this here it is. Mr. President first of all thank you
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:05.200]  for taking the time to talk with us. When you signed the National Defense
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.560]  Authorization Act into law you issued a signing statement at that time that said
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.640]  you would not use that power for indefinite detention on Americans you
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.400]  understood the concerns that people had a judge earlier this year issued that the
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:20.360]  administration couldn't use those powers because it's unconstitutional so why are
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:23.880]  the government's own lawyers fighting that judges order the injunction in
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:28.800]  particular. Well look the basic principle here is number one my first job is to
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.400]  keep the American people safe. Number two we've got to do it in a way that
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:38.800]  respects our values and our traditions of rule of law that's why I ban torture
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.720]  that's why I've argued that we should actually close Guantanamo but I've
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:50.320]  also said that you know we've got some bad guys who are down there who we may
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.120]  not be able to try in a traditional court but have pledged to try to hurt
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:00.160]  Americans and so that's something that we inherited that we're dealing with and
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:05.440]  it's complicated on the other hand what I also said was a US citizen can never be
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:09.280]  subject to that kind of detention. Congress disagreed with me and I didn't
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:14.080]  want us to not be able to finance our military and pay our soldiers and our
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:18.960]  troops so I signed the bill but what I also said was look that I'm never going
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:26.240]  to use this power and you know what I would suspect is that the courts are
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.120]  going to agree with us over the long term that that is not something that you
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.200]  can use when it comes to US citizens. Well let me ask you then also about the
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.480]  so-called presidential kill list that's gotten a lot of attention and this this
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:39.040]  list of folks who have been targeted for assassination and on that list have been
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.440]  US citizens who have not been afforded trial including Anwar Awa. Let's stop
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:46.120]  right there. How do you as president or any president for that matter? Yeah we've
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:51.640]  got Anwar Awaaki who dined secretly at the Pentagon we've got all that going on
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:57.880]  and we've got the fact that Obama it turns out demanded that it be added to
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:02.160]  the bill the indefinite detention of Americans and he's got his justice to
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:07.600]  department fighting to defend the legislation of the NDAA and his
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:13.240]  signing of it and then he just sat there Ben and told you that oh he knew
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:17.400]  that the courts would overturn it I mean that that makes Bill Clinton look
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:23.160]  like he's honest. Well you know look this story especially on the kill list has
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.160]  gotten so much attention nationally and to the point where it was picked up by
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.760]  the Atlantic and Huffington Post and a lot of liberal even the UK Guardian
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.600]  liberal publications ran that interview and it was really interesting to me to
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:38.880]  go through and to read the comment section not so much what they were
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.400]  writing but the comment section afterward there were a couple of things
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.680]  that were very interesting there because I think you alluded to a minute ago
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:47.920]  we're not really breaking ground here in terms of those questions and those
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.640]  questions are not conspiratorial they're not you know these kind of often the
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.160]  weeds questions this is stuff that's pretty much out there and there it's
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:00.720]  pretty easy to find any reporter can find it the discussion on the NDAA or
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:05.360]  the kill list or the situation with Awolaki the problem is I believe the
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.640]  problem it really stems from the fact that media won't talk about these things
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.880]  because it does require some real effort to dig into it I got a couple of
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:17.320]  interviews with reporters who asked me about it why would you ask those
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.360]  questions and and how could you even ask that I mean how would you even have the
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.480]  background on it well because we've been covering it for a year we've covered
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:27.440]  all of these issues you mentioned about the Obama administration asking for it
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:33.440]  we've covered extensively that statement by Carl Levin I'll tell you what stay
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.840]  there stay there we're gonna come right back after break and continue yeah the
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:41.400]  senator Carl Levin others came out and said hey don't blame us for this you
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:45.600]  ask for this and then they released the letter I mean the whole time Obama says
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:49.760]  I don't want it and then he says don't worry I'll veto it so opposition can't
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:55.720]  form and then he gets it passed and then he says I won't sign it but then he
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:01.000]  does I mean this is incredible deception stay there been swan September is

[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:18.840]  Ohio and every week makes national news because he covers hardcore issues and
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:22.320]  does his research I think you were alluding before he went to break there
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:27.080]  been that the media kind of comes to you and is like how do you know this how do
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:31.160]  you it's almost like you're reading a book that's weird I've had other media
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:34.840]  ask me questions like how do you know all this stuff I'm like well I'm into the
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.240]  news I'm into the information so elaborate on that and then yeah a
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:43.480]  continue on the point you were getting into with Obama saying well you know I
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:47.600]  knew courts would overthrow it when it turns out he was the one his White House
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.600]  demanding that the indefinite attention for citizens be in there you're right
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.160]  well absolutely and let me just comment on that second part first because you'll
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.680]  notice in the interview that we did with them you know you got five minutes so
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:01.600]  there's not a whole lot of time if you want to fight over one subject you're
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.880]  not gonna get much else in there and so what we choose to do because of the
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:07.880]  segment we do with reality check and the way it's built out you know really is
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:11.440]  perfect for going in you ask the question he gives the answer but we don't
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.560]  leave it at that and that's what so much national media does now it's that he
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.360]  said she said I asked the question you give the answer and we're done what we
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.160]  do is say okay I'll ask the question you give the answer and then we're gonna go
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.680]  back and fact check your answer and if you're wrong we're gonna say you were
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:27.680]  wrong if you're not being honest we're gonna say you're not being honest so
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.480]  what we saw in that case is he never he never directly addresses the second
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:36.640]  part of my question which was why are your own lawyers fighting that injunction
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:40.440]  which of course as you just mentioned that question is now dated because as of
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:45.040]  yesterday they're now fighting the overall striking down of the indefinite
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.480]  disengaging clause and they are appealing that ruling so if the president is
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:53.360]  honest when he says we always knew we struck down we believe that it would go
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.680]  to the courts we believe the courts would side with us show me how that's
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:00.720]  siding with you if you're the one fighting it regardless you know as you
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:04.040]  you mentioned a minute ago with media people keep asking well how do you know
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.720]  all this stuff and really there are two things number one is as you as you
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:10.840]  mentioned you just have to do a little bit of research and there's so much of
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:13.960]  this stuff out there and again it's because of the internet it's because of
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.760]  alternative media and also look listen I've got brilliant brilliant people who
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:23.520]  follow me on Facebook on Twitter I mean the people who I call themselves
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:28.520]  followers or fans that's the term the Facebook uses right I'm fans of theirs
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:32.280]  I'm a huge fan of theirs because they're so smart and they have so much
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:35.800]  information and they just constantly are feeding back into me a lot of
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:39.280]  information and and what's going on in the world and did you know this and did
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:42.080]  you know this and I feel like they've been helping me to gain an education
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.600]  because there's so much stuff out there and they're just helping to draw it all
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:53.680]  in well said man I tell you it is so refreshing been to see somebody
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:27:01.280]  professionally get up there and I told Chris Hedges this last week because I'm
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:04.000]  not liberal or conservative I'm just about truth and justice and freedom
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.600]  because I love my wife and my children I want a future it's refreshing to have
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.720]  somebody like Chris Hedges out there fighting the NDAA with his lawsuit and
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:17.520]  winning and it's and it's refreshing to see somebody like you well spoken
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:22.040]  focused handsome getting the word out and reaching millions from one little TV
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:26.960]  station because it gives me hope that there are going to be other people out
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:30.240]  there that can do a better job than I can that's what I told Chris Hedges I
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:35.520]  mean we all have our own tools in the fight for liberty it just it's great
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:39.600]  now I'm wondering who else is going to step up who else is going to take action
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:44.160]  because all that evil needs to flourish is that good men and women do nothing
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:48.720]  and so I salute what you're doing and the point you make about what your
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.320]  listeners and viewers are saying following the points they give you it's
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.600]  incredible data it's it's like the comments under the stories you were
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:00.760]  alluding to the amazing points they're making and you see everywhere whether
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:04.880]  it's a right-wing site or a left-wing site with those bias the comments more
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:10.080]  and more aren't left-wing or right-wing they're like hey we see through this right
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.280]  well that's absolutely true and what was exciting about like for instance the
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:17.400]  Huffington Post is a good example on the on the HuffPo article if you read the
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:21.400]  comments it was it was so interesting to hear people who are so used to this
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.160]  left-right paradigm that they couldn't even begin to fathom the idea so the
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.160]  first complaint is where you're from a Fox station so what you're asking the
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:33.400]  president about you know this kill list can't possibly be true secondly it's the
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:37.600]  same people in many cases who wanted Bush tried as a war criminal who want
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:42.680]  Cheney tried as a war criminal who give Obama a pass on his kill list and so it
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:46.200]  was really interesting that dynamic was they were really struggling through it
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:50.800]  and then of course you know I posted it on my social networking pages so that
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:54.200]  people could see it there go there and comment and what was exciting to me was
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:58.920]  some of our people when I say our I mean you know Liberty minded people start
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:01.920]  writing on there and actually we're winning some arguments and I think you
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.640]  can winning over some people's mind saying look yet you have to break through
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.120]  and shatter through that paradigm that says it's left versus right Republican
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:13.000]  versus Democrat because it's not it's Liberty versus oppression that's what
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.160]  the real issue is and I think people are beginning to see that Wow we're gonna
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:19.440]  go to break of a long 18-minute segment coming up I want to get into your
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.960]  favorite reports and what you're working on now and then open the phones up for

[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:34.720]  year and a half ago I'm like man this is something different and then the reports
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:39.280]  just keep coming and then in hindsight they're so accurate it a breath of
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.040]  fresh air folks a breath of fresh air we'll be right back the toll free number

[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:08.720]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:12.560]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:15.680]  seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:19.600]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:24.320]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival

[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:06.720]  first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the

[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:17.440]  well he is an award-winning researcher reporter TV anchoring anchors the news
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:24.320]  there on Fox 19 Fox 19.com in Cincinnati Ohio working at other stations in
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:30.880]  Texas he's won the Edward R. Murrow award and two Emmys on his mantle and he's a
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:34.520]  patriot of a very exciting I want to get into some of his other stories here
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:40.360]  Ben Swan local Ohio reporter grills Obama on kill list here's another one
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:45.520]  reality check is the embassy attack in Libya a clear example of blowback here's
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:50.840]  another one will the Libya attack shape American foreign policy moving forward
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:56.000]  these are the important questions now he goes on a dead RNC script the rule
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.680]  changes will that start a civil war in the Republican Party he questioned the
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:04.920]  Aurora shooting and the anomalies and people saying other shooters and all
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:08.480]  the rest of it I mean this is what we need to talk about these are the
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:12.880]  questions I've got to ask you this not to you know not to promote my show or
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.280]  anything I'm just flattered by it my producer was telling me when he asked
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:19.680]  have you ever heard the Alex Jones show that you indeed have heard of the show
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:24.120]  and do listen sometimes now I know as a journalist I'm more of a journalist slash
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:28.920]  commentator you know rabble rouser I wear a lot of hats around here but I'm
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:33.840]  just curious how did you stumble across my broadcast and how did it affect the
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:38.120]  different perspectives that you're bringing to your own show well I would
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:41.240]  say that that I knew of you because I'm from Texas and I always say you're down
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:45.880]  in Texas so now I'm from further west than you are but we that was aware of
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.640]  you and it hurt your name and then most of it really was it was very
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:54.000]  conspiratorial and and the guy's a nut job and so I didn't really know much
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.880]  about you and then once I've gotten more into into what we've been covering the
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:01.840]  last few months I had a lot of people who have said you know Alex Jones has
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.960]  covered a lot of these things and obviously there are people who are
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:07.720]  weary because as he said you're more of a commentator so in your case certainly
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:13.000]  it's more of a there's more opinion infused into it more more perspective
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.560]  infused into it which is fine I mean clearly you're doing what you do so I
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:20.160]  think that but that I think there's something very important about
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.600]  alternative media and one of the things that I think is impressive regardless of
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.880]  how people feel about you one way or the other because obviously you have many
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.480]  many fans out there and you got people who don't feel strongly about you or
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:35.160]  dislike you you know and that's not necessarily a bad place to be look I
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:39.360]  always tell people I would rather people love me or hate me but don't feel
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.640]  nothing about me because as soon as you're the guy that people feel nothing
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:45.800]  about then you're not accomplishing anything you know at least challenge
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:48.680]  challenge the narrative and challenge what people are thinking and challenge
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.880]  their minds and so I think you do a great job of that night and take my hand
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:56.120]  off to you for that well I just wanted to get your perspective because I again
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:59.560]  admire your courage and what you're doing I mean obviously you're a talented
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:04.240]  guy and I hope that it doesn't you know but count against you with the power
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:07.280]  structure that you're telling the truth have you gotten any big national
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:10.000]  offers yet in the last year and a half that you've been knocking out of the
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:16.720]  park no no in fact very very little talk from anyone higher up which is fine
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:20.200]  with me you know one thing one of the things I don't ever want to do is I
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:23.520]  never want to look beyond where I'm at right now as I mentioned at the beginning
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:27.360]  of this I'm incredibly blessed to be doing what I'm doing and and to have the
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:32.200]  platform that I have and I will say that in the last year and a half my view of
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:38.000]  what you know national media is has completely changed and certainly my view
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.360]  of what it means to be a national voice because we're sitting here in little
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:45.600]  old Cincinnati Ohio and yet we have a global voice right now and people in
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:49.600]  30 different countries are watching what we do and it's this little five minute
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:53.640]  segment and you know we do it three times a week yeah if I was Glenn Beck
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:57.400]  launching his new TV network back on television I would hire somebody like
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:02.080]  you and I think that'd probably be a perfect fit I mean Glenn Beck actually
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:05.400]  is in competition with me he thinks I'm not in competition with him I want to
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:08.800]  defeat the globalist there's no future but but the reason I brought up my
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:13.000]  shelf was I wanted to get into your view of the world because I know as a
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.640]  journalist you don't want to put any of those views out because then they could
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:20.920]  say oh well that's his bias but come on I mean tyranny is tyranny I mean it
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:25.320]  wouldn't be oh you have a bias in 1860 because you were against slavery and oh
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:28.920]  that's your opinion obviously it's the right position to be against slavery I
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:33.480]  mean some of these things are so clear what is your view of QE3 what is your
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:38.600]  view of the TSA all of this stuff I mean is it that the world's getting crazier
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:43.520]  that that's brought you closer to say my views well here's what I think you know
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:46.840]  you asked about QE3 and we're actually doing a piece on it next week to explain
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:50.960]  to people exactly how it works and what the design is behind it my issue is
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:56.080]  less about like for instance obviously I have very strong opinions but I think
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:00.000]  most people do my issue is more about making sure that I'm not going to
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.960]  necessarily try to sway someone else's opinion I just want their opinion to be
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:08.920]  based on fact not on a fairy tale and I think what we see too often in modern
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:12.480]  media is that we're allowing people to buy into fairy tales we don't challenge
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:16.080]  them John Stewart does a hilarious bit making fun of the way that CNN does
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.160]  their whole we'll leave it there I don't know if you've ever seen it but they
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:22.960]  have this phrase we'll leave it there and he made fun of that one time and the
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.760]  fact that they say we'll leave it there on major issues that shouldn't be left
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:30.720]  there because you're not allowing people to go through this process of critical
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.840]  thinking and to say well what does this actually mean for my life so but Ben
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:38.120]  Bernanke announces yeah we're gonna go ahead move on with QE3 and it'll help
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:42.520]  the economy I would be willing to bet you that only one tenth of the population
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:46.960]  if even that has any clue as to what he's talking about has any clue at all
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.920]  maybe even maybe even you know one percent of the population really
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:53.800]  understands what I agree with you because I've talked to so many bankers
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:57.000]  business people even folks that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.560]  they don't who are in finance they don't understand what this means right oh
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:06.400]  absolutely absolutely because there's so many different components to it you
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:08.920]  know you mentioned that we've been talking a lot about the issue in Libya
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:12.440]  what's going on over there right now and one of the reasons we're able to do
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.120]  that is because if you go all the way back to when we first started doing
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:20.080]  these one of the very first reality check segments we ever put together was
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:23.960]  about the fact that the US was getting involved in Libya and it didn't make
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:27.400]  sense as to why we were doing it the fact that we were involving ourselves
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:31.000]  without a declaration of war and now we're starting to see kind of the
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  ramifications of that foreign policy and what's it really about one of the
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.440]  things we're going to move into in the next few weeks and I think people will
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:40.520]  be pretty interested in it is we're going to start taking a look at the
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:45.040]  situation with the petrodollar and and what China is doing right now in terms
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:48.640]  of these refineries they're attempting to build in Saudi Arabia and in Egypt and
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.560]  ultimately what it's going to mean if the petrodollar disappears and there's a
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:57.520]  new currency in which oil was bought and traded if that happens it means a change
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:01.360]  in the way of life for every American that people don't even see coming because
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.680]  nobody's talking about it in national media alternative media you guys are
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:10.720]  talking about it thank you mr. Edward Armuro absolutely on target right there
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:15.720]  that is so exciting to hear someone in mainstream news understand that and and
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:19.920]  the power structure knows this but it's at a very high technocratic level they're
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:25.640]  engineering this while while moving their assets to China and other areas ahead
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:30.240]  of this seismic shift to bring in this global governance this world government
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:34.480]  run by the private banks how do I know that they wrote about it 30 years ago
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:39.040]  they wrote about it 10 years ago they now brag about it here and there so more
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:42.920]  and more the mainstream media realizes their past say have you seen the CNBC
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:46.240]  clip where they admit hey we're all slaves the global government run by
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:51.760]  bankers no I haven't seen that one guys can we cue that up please the CNBC clip
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:56.560]  because in more and more publications they are admitting it but it's more in
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:00.920]  establishment publications or in trade publications they're admitting where
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:05.640]  we're going but this isn't just quantitative easing it's also been and
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:10.360]  I want your take on this going directly to the mega banks themselves as a kind
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:14.760]  of bailout I mean the 40 billion a month half of the 80 billion goes to buy
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:19.360]  these derivatives these mortgage derivatives I mean I mean what that is
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:23.560]  that the taxpayers job to pay for that no absolutely not and they're doing
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:26.280]  exactly what you said but they're essentially doing to say look we're
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.960]  gonna go in we're gonna buy all these these mortgage-backed securities and
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:33.840]  derivatives and in doing so they are are creating a system where they're
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:38.640]  socializing the profit or excuse me they're privatizing the profit in that
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:41.960]  the banks are the ones who will profit from it but then they're socializing the
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:46.000]  risk of it they're buying up all these risky things with our dollars then
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.840]  turning around and saying well here are the profits for that we don't share in
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:53.440]  the profits of it the other issue is that this is indefinite and people may not
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:57.680]  realize this but when you move into quantitative easing that has no into it
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.880]  it's simply indefinite and you're gonna buy all this up if you have a 401k if
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:07.760]  you have you know a mutual fund that you're invested into for your retirement
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:12.720]  all of those very safe ones that traditionally have done well those are
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:16.680]  all going to be bought up by the Fed the Fed is gonna have control about the
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:20.000]  government will control all of those safe bets which means if you have money
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.200]  you need to put aside for your own retirement they're actually going to
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:27.240]  force you to put it into riskier stocks there are no safe bets because they're
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:32.000]  gonna buy up all the ones that are safe so it really hurts everyone in this
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.680]  process it doesn't just help the banks but it actually puts you know the average
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:38.920]  investor in a position where everything they're invested into for their future
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:43.360]  that traditionally has been very safe is now going to be very risky they infect
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:48.320]  the whole system then holds you hostage and say we're too big to fail and then
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:52.520]  basically transfer all the wealth to themselves while destroying your wealth
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:56.320]  then they're the last group standing and they're able to buy everything up for
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:01.600]  pennies on the dollar that is the economic model of conquest that we're
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:05.960]  now facing as a society and as you just stated when they announce unlimited QE
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:12.640]  3 that leads one place it leads to Weimar Republic Germany type inflation it
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:19.120]  live it it leads to Zimbabwe style inflation that is the road that they've
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:25.280]  now put us on and like you said it's just a minor footnote all QE 3 no
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:32.200]  connection to gold exploding and other commodities like gasoline oil spiking
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:37.760]  and this is just with the announcement and here are the insiders now not not
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:43.640]  doing QE 1 QE 2 QE 3 unlimited open-ended QE 3 now they get to know the
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:48.040]  insiders when they're going to be doing it with these little adjustments the
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:52.840]  insider trading ramifications are stratospheric but what's interesting too
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:59.560]  is even the terms that are used QE 1 QE 2 QE 3 it sounds like it is the third
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:03.240]  time that the Fed has gone through this process in order to as most people would
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:07.600]  call it stimulate the economy the problem is QE 1 QE 2 and QE 3 are not the
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:11.560]  same thing at all they were completely different programs that were designed in
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:16.960]  order to to to affect the the markets and affect the system so it's not QE 3 is
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:20.200]  not round 3 and that's what most people think that is it's an entirely
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:23.920]  different setup again as you mentioned buying up all of these mortgage-backed
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:28.760]  derivatives and as a result of that I think most people have no idea they
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:33.720]  think I think they think QE 3 more stimulus that means the government's
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.320]  going to put more money into the system well that's good for everyone and again
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:41.920]  as you mentioned to most financial channels and most financial reporters
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:45.560]  aren't even talking about it in any term that people can understand but what you
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:49.560]  described right now about shifting all of this burden away from from the banks
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:56.720]  themselves putting the risk on to the taxpayer buying up the safe bets shifting
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:00.280]  their own money this is all stuff that while when you say it a lot of people
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:03.800]  would say oh it's Alex Jones it's all conspiratorial it's not a conspiracy at
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.560]  all in terms of being hidden it's a conspiracy that's happening right out
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:11.360]  in the open and anyone can find this information they're just not bothering
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.680]  to do so they're too busy worried about the fact that Jersey shores off at the
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:19.240]  end of the season well exactly a lot of times I get up here and rant and rave
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:23.720]  because I'm genuinely upset that tends to get people out of their trance to
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:27.320]  realize something's going on and I kind of make it safe to talk about these
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:31.040]  things and then others can start to cover it so I think everybody you know the
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:34.960]  Lord works in mysterious ways that's why I'm excited to see you and others out
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:39.640]  there you're exposing this in a really focused news style because that will
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:43.120]  reach people out there who've kind of heard about this but think it's a
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:46.920]  conspiracy theory and there you are with a whole news team behind you able to
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:51.720]  lay all this out and people can go again to fox19.com to find all your
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:56.360]  reports they're also on YouTube before we go to some phone calls here and talk
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:59.640]  about some of the other reports you're working on right now Ben Swan
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:06.120]  award-winning reporter joining us right now I wanted to ask you the question
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:10.960]  about your social media and thing some of your own private websites or things
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:14.200]  outside of the Fox side if folks want to follow some of the things you're talking
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:18.320]  about off air yeah they can go over to Facebook we have a pretty strong Facebook
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:23.440]  page it's facebook.com slash Ben Swan reality check that's the easiest way to
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:28.120]  find it and it's one has two ends so if you're not familiar with me then you've
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:33.520]  got to put in Ben SWA in in reality check and you can follow us on Twitter as
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:38.040]  well and it's at Fox 19 Ben Swan so we're doing work on both of those sites
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.680]  we don't really have much going on with Google plus the app but we're working on
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:44.280]  creating some circles there create more discussion again because as I mentioned
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:48.800]  I mean I'm a huge fan of the people who follow me and and I just feel like those
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:53.600]  are the folks so many of them are so smart and savvy and they know what's
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:57.040]  going on they're awake is the term I would use for them and when you get
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:00.800]  around people who are awake it energizes you in it yeah that's what's
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:04.480]  happened well I've no I've seen your sites it's basically it's it's liberty
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:07.520]  lovers it's my listeners it's your listeners it's people that understand
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:11.120]  what's happening and who are breaking down the left-right paradigm and saying
[01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:15.080]  hey it's about liberty now the Democrats just so happen to be you know
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:20.360]  absolute tyrants the Republicans same ball of wax I tend to agree with
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:24.080]  Republicans more because on the surface they say they're pro-gun and and things
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:28.520]  like that but again at the very top you see with somebody like Obama and Romney
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:32.240]  past the rhetoric there's almost no difference what's your take on that oh
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:38.680]  absolutely I think there is you have to strain to find a real substantive
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:42.520]  difference between President Obama and Mitt Romney and that's one reason why
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:45.360]  the two of them I think are going to really struggle when you get into this
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:49.280]  debate the conventions were fascinating for folks who were kind of political
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:52.840]  watchers the conventions were really interesting because the Republicans did
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:56.920]  such a poor job of shaping their message their message really wasn't about
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:00.520]  what they're going to change in the future it was about how Obama had failed
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:03.880]  and he hadn't done enough and they really pushed for this we built it kind of
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:07.760]  idea because they were using a play on words but there really wasn't a vision
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:11.560]  for what they would do differently the Democratic convention the same way there
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:15.960]  was no real vision for the future it was well if we go with that guy we're not
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:19.120]  gonna like it and so there was very little vision casting in either
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:22.800]  convention which was kind of fascinating to me and part of the reason I think for
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:26.440]  that is because if you really break down the direction the governor Romney
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:29.600]  wants to take the country and the direction President Obama does there
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.720]  are some differences in terms of how they want to deal with taxation how they
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:36.520]  want to deal certainly with with people who were in higher income brackets and
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:40.320]  taxation but if we're talking about for instance foreign policy tell me one
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:47.080]  thing governor Romney will do differently than what or TSA or NSA or the police
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:52.280]  state or any of these things that really matter it's like it's like map
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:57.800]  quest plotting two different ways to go to the same destination I mean there's
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:01.600]  some changes in the route but it goes the same place absolutely because
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:05.200]  ultimately their their view and even and even when we talk about you know you
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:08.600]  ask me about some of my own personal views look I'm a journalist I'm a
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:13.640]  constitutionalist my personal view is that Constitution rule of law is what
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:17.520]  our founders and framers designed they knew that that we should not be a
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:21.240]  democracy people say all the time we're a democracy it's one of my biggest pet
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:24.800]  peeps we're not a democracy we're a republic we're a republic absolutely and
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:29.600]  the difference is vast the republic is rule of law democracy is rule of mob
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:34.160]  and so all you need is a plus one in a democracy in order to push through any
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:38.800]  crazy laws or rule and rob the other 49% it's two wolves in a sheet voting on
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:42.080]  what's for dinner but again that's terrorist talk according to Homeland
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:45.240]  Security have you done a report yet on my act at Homeland Security reports
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:48.560]  saying veterans and gun owners and the terrorist you know what some people have
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:51.000]  been sending me some of that information and we are looking at doing
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.080]  something on that we're going to break it's like constitutional if you believe
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:58.160]  in the Constitution you're a terrorist exactly we're going to break as usual I've
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:01.280]  hogged the gas we got loaded phone lines for you but let me just add this here
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:06.800]  drudgereport.com it's also at info wars.com our story about the nuclear

[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:18.120]  I think that right now the question is do we all work for central bankers that's
[01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:22.320]  what I want to address to our guests tonight is this global governance at
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:27.640]  last is it one world the central bankers in charge Jim Jim Yorio you say we've
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:32.120]  got some downside here a correction in the markets fine but aren't we all just
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:36.320]  living and dying for what the central banks do aren't we all just counting on
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:40.840]  the fact that there's a Bernanke pot put and that we won't go any lower than say
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:45.240]  5% down from here of course we are because if we look at the economic
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:48.240]  data there's nothing to get excited about in that and they go on for five
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:51.840]  minutes to all agree we're run by global government run by banks exactly what I
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:54.600]  said 17 years ago was going to happen because I was reading the trial
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:59.160]  lateral Commission public documents but the issue here is Bernanke said a year
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:04.840]  ago there'd be no QE3 well now it's just unlimited QE and they wanted us to beg
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:08.560]  for it first because if they don't do it we're in trouble but if they do we're in
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:13.120]  trouble because they engineered this Ben Swine he's one of the anchors over
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:16.560]  there an investigative reporter at Fox 19 in Cincinnati now has a national
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:21.480]  international following via YouTube and their site we're taking phone calls got a
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:25.440]  lot of fans out there gonna take five phone calls for you for this short
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:30.880]  segment and the next and you're going let's talk to Brian in Colorado you're
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:35.600]  on the air with our guests go ahead big fan ears mr. Swann and you as well mr.
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:41.840]  Jones I wanted to bring you up to a case on a few things that I found out I live
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:47.200]  in Colorado and it's very frightening to have the ACF state they're gonna take
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:52.320]  those guns rights that smoke marijuana or use marijuana because a lot of people
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:56.360]  in Colorado have guns and a lot of people in Colorado smoke marijuana but
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:59.920]  the thing I really wanted to point out to you gentlemen is that through my
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:05.000]  research I found that marijuana oil cures cancer well it's certainly been
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.160]  shown to be a treatment let me stop you this is how crazy the news is that broke
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:13.200]  after I was off air yesterday we carried it on the nightly news I read the
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:18.160]  ruling from two days ago it's true they're saying alcohol abuse marijuana
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:23.640]  use any drug any substance abuse that they say no judge no jury they're taking
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:29.320]  your guns Ben Swan what do you make of that I haven't heard it so I really can't
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:36.520]  comment on it I'd love to see it though it's already in featured news archive
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:40.920]  just just put it up on screen for folks that are watching and listening can find
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:44.720]  it in forward calm I haven't reposted the front page let's go thank you Brian
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:52.000]  let's go to Luke in South Korea you're on the air with mr. Swan go ahead hi
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.280]  there how are you I've seen from my own experience with mainstream media that
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:01.280]  certain stories the government want to have suppressed never make it to air and
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:06.360]  in England they have the DA system defense advisory they've still got the
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:09.880]  legacy of that in Australia they're trying to reenact it as a voluntary yeah
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:13.240]  it's a denotus absolutely and then they're trying to get that here what's
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:18.760]  your question for mr. Swan well right with the absence of a denotus how does
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:23.760]  the government get the issues they want to press the press they have talking
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:28.200]  point I mean I know because I've talked to national they have taught what you
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:34.720]  saw two weeks ago where where the New York Times is in contact with the CIA and
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:38.680]  killing stories for them Ben your take on that absolutely I think they're
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:43.080]  definitely talking points to go out and I think within local media the issue isn't
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:48.280]  so much talking points as it is group think if if you know the sister parent
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:51.720]  station or if the networks are talking about it then it must not be news and so
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:54.760]  it's group think on the lower level bigger level it's talking point exactly
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:57.800]  at that exactly at the top of the pyramid talking points are given White
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:02.440]  House meetings you name it book deals all of it as I've been offered it and then
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:06.720]  all the little parents think oh those are the stars if I copy what they say
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:11.640]  I'll rise up when in truth even if you were a cynical mercenary being different
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:17.640]  will is what will make you rise up in a stagnant system all right I hope that
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:21.360]  answers your question from South Korea we're gonna race back and we're gonna go
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:26.960]  to Angel and then we're gonna go to Eric at least those maybe some more for Ben
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:33.160]  Swan box 19 reporter but like he said now from that city he's worldwide that's
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:37.120]  why the dinosaur media is in so much trouble that's why the info war is

[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:17.760]  I have a question for the gas and maybe for you Alex I've been microchipped and
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:21.960]  I don't know what it's in the back of my head I'm not that's a good prank call we
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:25.320]  don't screen your calls very very funny I can tell you're not schizophrenic I can
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:29.640]  hear you laughing you think it's funny but we got chips for people like you I
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:35.000]  don't worry let's talk to Eric in Ohio up in your neck of the woods Ben Eric
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.600]  you're on the air go ahead hello thanks for having me long-time listener first
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:42.800]  time caller welcome sir um yes my question well the first a quick comment is
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:45.720]  I have a bachelor's electrical engineering a master's in business now
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:49.320]  used to be a certified nuclear medicine technologist and I'm a veteran and I
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:52.360]  live here in Springfield Ohio and I'm having a hard time finding a job and
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:57.840]  um I was wondering Ben based upon your research is more of the Barbati County
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:01.080]  based upon what Obama's done or what based upon what John Kasich has done
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:06.800]  thank you very much for having me thanks you know I just real quick on Ohio it's
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:10.160]  tough to say I mean certainly the president says because of the auto bailout
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:14.240]  they created a lot of jobs eight out of every ten jobs in Ohio is connected
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:16.520]  somehow to the auto industry so he definitely gets some credit for that
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:20.560]  but then that big jobs board that the governor case he puts together obviously
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:24.680]  is helping as well so it's probably a combination of the two but even so I
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:28.240]  mean unemployment still high it's still at like seven point six percent but it's
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:31.920]  still lower than the national average so for guys like you I mean it's it's not
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:37.560]  it's not here's the deal sir people that have advanced degrees in technology
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:41.680]  you'd have to move to China I mean to get a job you've got to move where
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:46.240]  they're having a growing economy we've been deindustrialized by policy and
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:52.120]  undercut by Indian and Chinese workers and nothing against them that's just
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:55.920]  part of the engineering that's why it's so hard for you to get a job okay
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:01.600]  well thank you very much sir and I just uh once more clarity thank you sir God
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:05.800]  bless you I think was a good point that Ben made real fast JR in Utah quick
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:11.000]  question only got a minute and a half left yes thanks for having me a first-time
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:16.600]  listener to your show Ben swan I've been following you for a little bit now and
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:25.000]  I have a question for you do you have any concerns about you know the message and
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.720]  the facts that you're delivering you know to everybody I mean pretty much
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:33.080]  everywhere you know how you're bringing the truth out do you have any concerns
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:39.120]  about then setting down your show and try to silence you in any way no not
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:43.000]  really I mean right now again the support from people has been tremendous as
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.200]  long as their support that's great and you know we'll keep speaking the truth
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:49.560]  as long as I allow us to but again as long as the internet stays free there's
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:53.000]  always a place to speak out and that's the key to it is you got to keep the
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.680]  internet free because as long as it is it challenges that national narrative
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:04:00.920]  alternative media is what's there you go and that's why they want cyber security
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:05.720]  that's why old media is supporting web censorship because they can't deal with
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:10.160]  the competition Ben is a talented smart guy he could go anywhere do a talk
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:14.080]  radio show you name it be successful I could because people want to hear the
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:17.960]  information absolutely hit the nail on the head well I tell you Ben hearing you
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:22.160]  hear freeform not just on the news I'm even more impressed and we'll continue

[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:27.560]  deer hunting rifle and they find a marijuana seed that they plant or that
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:34.400]  you know somebody left in there you are going to lose your car your firearm if

[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:41.480]  that's what they're starting to do with asset forfeiture seizure you've seen even
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:46.160]  on CNN Fox News I'm ashamed to say my own state the police are actually pretty
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:51.720]  good in Texas on average I've been all over the country but in some of the
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:56.680]  areas of East Texas Louisiana is a great state but it's very corrupt it's kind
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:02.320]  of like little pieces of Louisiana in Texas the cops pull over it usually
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:06.320]  makes the news when it's some 80 year old billionaire woman I mean that
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:09.000]  actually happened about a decade ago and has happened several times since with
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:12.440]  the old rich women they'll have like $3,000 on their purse you know
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:15.480]  depression era where they carry the cash around with them don't trust credit
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:19.880]  cards and the cops will just see them getting their license out and say get
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:24.080]  out of the car they take the cash and you know it turns out the woman is you
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:27.160]  know part of the daughters of the Republic of Texas and one of the richest
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:30.760]  woman in Houston and then she does something about it but with everybody
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:35.240]  else if you're driving while black or driving while Hispanic in East Texas you
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:38.600]  can forget it I mean they're taking everything you've got and most the
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:43.200]  towns aren't like that it's it's certain a little little enclaves because I got
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:46.360]  family in East Texas we got a ranch in East Texas my dad's from East Texas and
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:51.040]  you know all the all the middle class and nicer people aren't like that but
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:54.160]  there are those little enclaves I mean I've been in East Texas swimming at the
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:57.600]  local city pool when I was a kid and people come over and say get out of here
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:06.760]  you darn Yankee but that's a side issue the ATF is now saying that they are
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:15.360]  going to take all of your guns all of your guns without a judge without a
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:20.320]  jury asset forfeiture admiralty it's it's the law of war it's it's part of
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:25.040]  martial law like that's one of the staples of martial law is is asset
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:30.520]  forfeiture admiralty law the sea that's how the British would grab US semen off
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:35.440]  the ships that's one big part of the war and press them into five years of
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:40.760]  service and folks most people didn't live five years in service in the 1760
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:46.800]  70s 80s in fact two-thirds of people died after just two missions to the
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:51.200]  African slave coast the Gold Coast because of the malaria and all of it but
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:55.200]  I'm digressing yes you heard me right it wasn't just half the slaves died on the
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:00.440]  passage back it was it was most the sailors dying incredible history but
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:05.080]  I'm digressing we're now under admiralty and a federal court ruled two days ago
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:10.440]  that the ATF could take your guns well I finally read the ruling and it is
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:15.960]  unbelievable guns of pot users to be confiscated so I'm gonna cover that
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:20.080]  coming up after we get into QE 3 and I'm glad a caller mentioned it because
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:29.720]  there's so much news on my plate and we're gonna be getting to Ted Anderson
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:36.400]  here in just a moment but guns of pot users to be confiscated and but it
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:42.120]  also I read it Suzanne Puzzle wrote this I've actually read the order
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:47.520]  yesterday afternoon the ruling and it actually says alcohol anything if you
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:51.160]  ever get on oxy cotton like Rush Limbaugh because your backs hurt they're
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:55.640]  gonna take your guns I mean this is this is this is big remember Obama said I'll
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:13:01.760]  get their guns don't worry outside of law we're gonna go under the radar
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:05.240]  Sarah Brady talked about that that Obama's promised me he's gonna get them
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:11.120]  and here it is and and and it's just incredible and so I'm sitting there
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:13.960]  yesterday with a headline and I'm thinking well this you know this deals
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:19.040]  with everything how do we get people's attention well we point out marijuana is
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:23.800]  what 80 million people smoke at least once a month a statistics state 40
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:28.720]  million every day probably higher than that but they say 80 plus percent of
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:32.840]  Americans have tried it at least once I've smoked it I spoke quite a bit of it
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:40.040]  never really liked it but now they've got these more designer marijuana out
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:45.680]  there the point is is that this is a big deal and so are they saying that they
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:50.840]  can just plant marijuana on me and take my guns you know the 68 gun control act
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:54.760]  states yeah I said I'd cover this later I'm already covering it the 68 gun
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:59.760]  control acts as if you're a felon and people said then don't do it even
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:05.080]  Charlton Heston who promoted the 68 gun control act later said he was wrong by
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:08.520]  the mid 90s he said I was wrong because now they get you for felonies for
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:14.600]  anything while they the ruling elite are exempt so this is a big deal they're
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:19.440]  talking about in here now implementing it that if you get a drunk driving
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:22.480]  charge and you agree to the counseling that you don't know that when you're
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:25.280]  with the counselor admitting that you drink every day they're going to call
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:28.640]  that substance abuse and take your guns you think they're going to stop with the
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:32.440]  troops and the post-traumatic stress and just take the millions of veterans
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:37.520]  guns they're going to get everybody's guns by the time they're done this is
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:42.120]  incredible this isn't we listen everybody wants marijuana legalized I
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:46.280]  mean it's in some states as high as 90 plus percent understand it's not as bad
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:50.960]  as alcohol it's got a lot of health benefits it's a lot better than Prozac
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:54.840]  I know that and Ritalin and all the rest of it it helps a lot of people cancer
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.600]  patients you name it stop raiding our houses stop setting up checkpoints stop
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:04.120]  filling the jails with people that smoke pot stop taking people's kids if they
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:07.880]  smoke pot all right now I'm ranting I'm going to go to Ted I apologize I'll
[02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:11.440]  cover it for the show ends I got Dan Badandi's five-minute report on the
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:15.680]  people know about the Constitution do Americans know their Constitution that's
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:18.960]  coming up but we're going to spend most the hour with Ted Anderson he's a very
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:23.960]  busy man Ted is 30 plus years in the gold and silver industry he's founded
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:27.640]  Midas you were one of the biggest companies before that he founded Midas
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:33.920]  what 15 years ago or is it 16 now I was shopping around for gold sponsors I had
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:36.800]  a couple of them and people would immediately say I didn't get my gold
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:40.360]  or it's overpriced so I started researching gold bought the red book
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:45.160]  found Midas they had a good name went out and got him as a sponsor before Ted
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:48.160]  even had a radio network he kind of got the idea because he's like why don't I
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:52.160]  just put up a network so I've been with with Ted since before he started
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:56.040]  Genesis and I bought gold a few other places and there's a few that are okay
[02:15:56.040 --> 02:16:02.640]  out there but consistently if you want gold bullion silver junk silver you name
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:05.440]  it or if you want collectibles Ted doesn't even really promote that but
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:09.560]  he's got a ton of it there at his vaults down the you know down the street at the
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:14.720]  bank and he's got everything and he's got it deliverable if you call up with
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:19.440]  some weird coin it might take him a few weeks to get it but he's been busy while
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:24.480]  people foolishly and so have I were you know when gold was 1630 selling it the
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:30.280]  last few months people been selling it back to Ted and I've been buying some
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:35.200]  of it and Ted's been buying it so he's been busy with people selling it back
[02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:40.000]  to him now he can sell it to you even though it's gone up a hundred and
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.600]  something bucks in the last few weeks when I went up almost 50 yesterday how
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:47.280]  much is it in the last two weeks 150 160 I don't know well that's Ted but I
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:50.800]  didn't get him on about the pitch I really want his he's a big Ron Paul
[02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:54.400]  supporter was a Ron Paul delegate he's a big Liberty guy I mean that's why he
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:58.960]  got into all this and he really knows what quantitative easing means why this
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:02.960]  is such a big deal we just got a great breakdown from Fox News reporter Ben
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:08.800]  Swan earlier but Ted I mean we've been knowing this was coming so long and we
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:13.560]  knew that if they did QE3 it would cause hyperinflation but this type is just
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:19.800]  unlimited and open-ended 80 billion half of that 40 billion a month to private
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:24.600]  banks just giving them the money buying crap made up derivatives tell us what
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:28.080]  the other 40 billions for and what you expect this to do and then we're going
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:31.920]  to get Max Kaiser on we're going to get Webster Tarpleon is an economist we're
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:36.600]  going to get Gerald Salente this Sunday next week this is big folks they are
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:40.760]  dropping the hammer I mean this is like going to the doctor and then tell you
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:45.600]  got you know stage four brain cancer or something I mean this is this is on I
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:49.920]  mean Ron Paul get the clip ready Ron Paul said what's the exact quote he said
[02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:53.440]  we in fact just queue up the wrong Paul clip I can't get me he said basically
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:56.760]  this you know we should run for the hills we should be completely freaking out
[02:17:56.760 --> 02:18:01.080]  I forget the exact quote yeah yeah we're queuing that up right now it's in our
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:05.920]  tricaster it's in our computer we played it on the show today we've already
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:13.720]  played it yeah that's why we always want to default save stuff into the in our
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:18.600]  native computers because we could lose it if we didn't we don't have it all
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:23.720]  right all right let's go to Ted Anderson Ted Anderson good to have you here
[02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:26.920]  good to have you here with us I mean this is a big deal and I'm running around
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:29.960]  like a chicken with my head cut off because I understand what's happening
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:33.320]  you're not had a bunch of coffee and pollen birds but I break down what this
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:37.800]  means well I mean it first of all I mean the article that you have right up on
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:44.800]  info wars dot com titled the banker bailout is a great explanation of what's
[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:49.000]  going on Joseph Watson wrote it but you know basically what it is is that the
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:54.280]  Fed is trying to step in and stimulate the economy bailout the you know this is
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:58.240]  a really a bailout for the banks that have these loans or these mortgages
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:03.400]  they're trying to stop an economic collapse from happening people are
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:07.720]  having a hard time paying their mortgages there are a lot of foreclosures
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:11.920]  that are going on there's there's way too much debt we can't afford the debt at
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:16.360]  a quarter of a percent interest if they haven't if they're not stepping in and
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:20.080]  doing quantitative easing interest rates are going to go up and the natural
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:25.080]  market number is probably four five six seven percent it's certainly not zero
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:30.600]  and so the Fed is trying to step in and others say until the year 2015 however
[02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:34.480]  much money it takes they're going to do quantitative easing right now they're
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:39.480]  committed to do an 85 billion dollars on a monthly basis and they're going to do
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:45.080]  that infinitively and that's why they don't call this QE3 it is QE3 but
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:49.280]  there's no destination as far as how much and what the end of this is going
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:54.080]  to be and stay there money great points I have the feds report somewhere in my
[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:58.640]  stack here we're going to go over it 85 billion dollars a month of your tax
[02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:03.680]  money stay with us the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six
[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:08.360]  months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn
[02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:12.720]  belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables
[02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:16.760]  and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is
[02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:20.040]  forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices

[02:23:59.800 --> 02:24:20.760]  Alright, Ted Anderson's with us for the balance of the hour we do have Dan Madonna's report coming up and I'm ranting I kind of getting a crazed
[02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:26.480]  mode here sometimes by the third hour because I'm looking around for the clip
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:32.400]  of Congressman Ron Paul and I'm trying to find my Federal Reserve statement which
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:36.560]  I have here and I just get into a frothing mood by the way the tricaster
[02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:39.600]  would crash that's why the crew couldn't play it computers are great but they
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:43.160]  also have a lot of problems but we do have that Ron Paul clip I was mentioning
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:49.520]  this is Ron Paul on the news last night this video clip is up at info wars.com
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:58.800]  from the folks over at Zero Hedge here it is we clip with Congressman Ron Paul
[02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:02.760]  that we're gonna play he has not achieved that frustrates him I can tell
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:06.760]  is he gets no economic growth he doesn't do anything with the unemployment
[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:11.880]  numbers and from my viewpoint I think the country should have panicked over the
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:15.560]  fact of what the Fed is saying that we've lost control the only thing we have
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:20.600]  left is massively creating new money out of thin air which hasn't worked before
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:26.000]  and it's not going to work this time so there you go Ted Anderson what do you
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:30.240]  make of that well Ron Paul's right I mean not what they're doing is they're
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:34.040]  creating stimulus but what are businesses gonna do I mean right now
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:37.000]  they're gonna gear up for inflation they're certainly not gonna hire more
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:41.360]  people there they have to like pull down the hatches and try to figure out how
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:44.680]  this is going to affect them their costs of their production are going to be
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:47.880]  going up they don't know if they'll even be able to sell their product for a
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:52.760]  higher price I mean it throws a whole market in it upside down and you know
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:57.360]  just throws in turbulence is what it does you know and and this is not a new
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:01.480]  argument Alex you were talking about how this is a planned event this is how
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:06.680]  things came about I can tell you Thomas Jefferson was arguing with Hamilton
[02:26:06.680 --> 02:26:09.520]  when this country was formed as to whether or not we should have a central
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:14.040]  bank Woodward Wilson was pushing for the League of Nations that's how we ended up
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:17.760]  with the Federal Reserve system you had to read his resume my god what this guy
[02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:22.760]  gave us is just amazing you know I mean what if the Federal Reserve system
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:27.000]  federal income taxes I mean the whole thing this goes on and now we have the
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:31.960]  system in order to have money we have to go into debt so we go into debt the Fed
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:36.080]  creates more money by lending it to us and now we owe interest on that debt and
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:39.080]  it compounds and it gets bigger and bigger and now we're at the end of the
[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:43.920]  rope we can no longer afford the interest because it's consuming 40 45% of
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:49.240]  GDP at at a half a percent I mean what do you expect is going to happen the the
[02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:52.480]  Fed has to keep the interest rates down now because if they let the interest
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:57.560]  rates rise the United States nation will cease to exist we will no longer be
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:03.200]  able to afford the debt it's beyond control and yes indeed the the people
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:07.520]  that formed the Federal Reserve system and push for the League of Nations back
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:13.200]  in 1913 are now pushing for a world currency and to be able to control the
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:18.080]  entire planet with a printing press the politicians love printing presses
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:22.800]  because they can be bought they can buy votes with it they can they can you know
[02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:27.120]  pass all their programs that they want to pass by the way as you know the
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:33.400]  moroso and all of them are over there Herman von Roompi the heads of the EU
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:37.320]  are bragging that they're taking over the once sovereign nations of Europe
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:44.080]  into a super state run by the banks this is an economic takeover and it's not
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:48.760]  even our debt most of it it's their derivatives they signed us on to and I
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:54.720]  think that's the only silver lining here is that there won't be as bad an
[02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:57.360]  inflation because they're not really putting it out of the economy they're
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:01.640]  giving it to themselves so it's only luxury items that are going to hyper
[02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:06.520]  inflate up front but a lot of economists say that'll still trickle down of
[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:10.120]  course it's getting trickled on I mean my goodness look at the corn prices look
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:14.160]  at beef prices look at you know just a loaf of bread or what are we paying for
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:18.280]  gasoline my goodness a $10 an hour employees isn't going to be able to
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:22.680]  afford to fill this tank and come to work I mean this this is causing
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:28.680]  economic chaos in the entire economic system of the United States and what is
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:31.760]  it going to do to the retirees who have saved their lives that are living on a
[02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:36.240]  pension and get Social Security I mean it's just going to destroy them you know
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:40.680]  it all around we're putting our children into debt and we're robbing
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:45.000]  money from anybody that's saved and and just destroying the economy and then
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:50.040]  meanwhile Ted they're buying 1.4 billion bullets and more we have more news
[02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:54.120]  coming on that today we've discovered they're getting giant black armored
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:59.120]  vehicles they're preparing for civil unrest they're digging in they plan on
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:03.760]  fully imploding things posing as saviors getting rid of internet freedom and
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:09.160]  making this country go dark well there you go I mean that's I mean Jefferson
[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:13.200]  said that a central bank is more dangerous to the people than a standing
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:17.280]  army and now you're seeing why that he said if you allow them to control the
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:21.600]  issuance of currency and credit your grandchildren will wake up homeless on
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:25.520]  the continent their forebears conquered and that's what's happening to us Alex
[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:29.680]  it's just a sad shame and that's why I've been saying hey get into gold and
[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:32.840]  silver do something a little bit different than staying in this paper
[02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:36.000]  money because that's how they manipulate us you're tired of these
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:39.800]  these you know these foreigners controlling the United States you got
[02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:42.560]  to do something about it well we've got to identify the enemy and that's the
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:46.280]  globalist and they run al-qaeda as well that's now admitted I want to come back
[02:29:46.280 --> 02:29:50.600]  and ask you where you think gold's going and more stay with us we're on the
[02:29:50.600 --> 02:30:01.040]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network the worst
[02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:04.880]  drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the
[02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:09.080]  hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:13.360]  conditions only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all
[02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:17.600]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:21.160]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[02:30:21.160 --> 02:30:25.240]  counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own
[02:30:25.240 --> 02:30:29.280]  supply of foods from eat foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients
[02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:32.760]  increases eat foods will have to raise prices to now is the time to get your

[02:33:13.880 --> 02:33:16.720]  the resistance
[02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:26.640]  so what's the wrong poll quote we should be panicking over what's happening
[02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:33.040]  yes and it's because we've lost our ability to really get upset you see when
[02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:38.080]  I learned that eugenicists took the country over who believe in a one-world
[02:33:38.080 --> 02:33:42.200]  government to then put stuff in our food and water to sterilize us and
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:46.760]  basically kill us and then I discovered they're testing on us right now the
[02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:52.700]  massive increases in death and cancer just the the beta phase and that their
[02:33:52.700 --> 02:33:57.140]  programs going forward I start yelling and screaming I'm not like this when
[02:33:57.140 --> 02:34:02.000]  I'm at home but I get up here in front of you and I start making myself focus
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:06.440]  on this I get upset I'm like please do something it'd be like if I pulled up in
[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:10.840]  front of your house I was driving home and I drove up my neighbors house had
[02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:14.620]  flames coming out of it and then I ran over to see if they were okay and the
[02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:17.520]  door was locked and I looked through the window and saw the families laying in
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:22.560]  their beds with flames I would knock the door down and go in and get people out
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:27.000]  but if I knocked the door down and ran in and they said there's no fire I'm like
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:31.880]  what do you mean it's coming through the door right there there's smoke get up
[02:34:31.880 --> 02:34:37.120]  well I would just then leave if they refused to get up unless they were
[02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:40.680]  children then I drag them out because I'm not gonna make somebody leave they
[02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:43.920]  want to burn themselves up but here's the problem we're all in the house
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:48.000]  together and one of us alone can't get the door open we can't get out by
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:52.720]  ourselves there's seven billion people on this world three hundred and ten
[02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:55.680]  million in this country we were the wealthiest country the world had ever
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:35:00.280]  seen the evil all came here to use us as an engine to build their world
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:03.760]  government and then as soon as they're done with us folks they're gonna get
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:10.040]  rid of us that's the pattern in history we have to then be brought down and these
[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:13.400]  globalists are in power because they are ruthless and they believe through
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:18.880]  social Darwinism that they're doing us a favor doing this to us they think you're
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:22.520]  weak and pathetic and deserve to be killed I can't tell you how many
[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:27.720]  executives you know in private discussions have said well Alex you
[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:31.480]  notice you tell people this stuff they don't do anything maybe they deserve
[02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:35.080]  what's happening to them maybe you should try to join the power structure and
[02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:39.280]  even those people that I've met who are making you know five million dollars a
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:42.960]  year or whatever they're not part of the real power structure they're being

[02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:08.160]  is the way to survive this you got it backwards okay you got it backwards
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:15.960]  bud backwards my instincts to fight this are right but I could intellectually
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:22.680]  study history and go my instincts are right to fight this okay history common
[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:27.560]  sense breakdown we've got to fight this and get people out of their trance
[02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:32.880]  they're learned helplessness mass Stockholm syndrome overton window a
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:41.680]  normal C bias man that's our problem that's our problem all right I'm ranting
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:45.440]  Ted and I've got some special reports and things coming up and I mean
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:48.520]  obviously we're capitalist we got to fund ourselves we don't get taxpayer
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:53.640]  money you know like MSNBC and others did a lot of people so I'm obviously want
[02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:56.000]  to do a gold pitch here but that's not why you're here today in fact you want
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:59.600]  to come on out about that Ted you were trying to get into where gold's going
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:03.440]  what you expect to happen but but but from other countries that have gone this
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:09.280]  direction Mexico Zimbabwe Germany I mean we know what inflation hyperinflation
[02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:14.400]  looks like Argentina 12 years ago what do we all run by the globalist same
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:20.040]  playbook same they call it the IMF riot that got leaked when Joseph
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:24.720]  sticklets left the World Bank that they actually destroy the economy so then
[02:39:24.720 --> 02:39:28.480]  people riot and then that destroys it even more then they bring in troops and
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:33.480]  bring in a permanent sense of martial law which after six months of rioting in
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:37.760]  Argentina other places you actually want the troops even if you know it was all
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:41.520]  set up you're still like finally the rioting's over I mean is that where this
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:45.120]  is going Ted well I mean to end the violence I mean who wants to be able
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:48.960]  to you know walk out with their children and know that you're not going to get
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:52.680]  attacked or that the streets are safe but let me tell you something there's no
[02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:56.720]  safety here you give up your liberty you will not achieve safety you're gonna be
[02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:00.840]  you're gonna be bound by the chains of this whole thing you know there's a
[02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:04.880]  couple things Alex the Board of Governors did it press release yesterday
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:09.800]  it's from September 13th we will send that to you we have it in PDF form if
[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:13.400]  you want to get a copy of it study it for yourself to see what the feds up to
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:17.920]  today I can tell you this this is not over people this summer were thinking
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:22.040]  that this was over that we had a solution to our economic problems and
[02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:27.200]  there's no reason for gold because not one from $1900 an ounce down to $1550
[02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:31.480]  an ounce they're getting away from it but now we're seeing the thing rear its
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:36.840]  ugly head and the Fed has you know put on the accelerator and that's why you see
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:41.120]  gold and silver just jumping you know forty fifty sixty dollars in one day
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:46.920]  silver up four dollars and fifty cents I mean that is reality and that's what we
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:51.280]  have to look forward to because the interest on debt is consuming us the
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:55.520]  only way the Fed can keep the game going is by keeping the interest rates down
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:59.960]  you know they do not want to face up to the hard facts that we're going to have
[02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:05.200]  an economic crisis on our hands and we need to take that medicine but the
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:09.280]  longer they try to stimulate the more they manipulate the markets like they
[02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:13.880]  are the more toxic and the more bitter the pill is going to become to swallow
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:17.880]  we could have done this years ago we'll have to do this in the future we're
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:22.600]  going off the cliff that's why Ron Paul saying what he's saying we need to change
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:27.720]  this but at this point in time the only thing that I can tell you to do is get
[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:33.120]  out of their money if they're wanting to print money to solve their problems like
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:37.760]  they are you need to put yourself on a gold standard and a silver standard get
[02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:42.240]  away from their paper and get into something that's real and we started
[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:46.960]  having you back on because there wasn't really any news in gold and silver but
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:49.880]  privately we were talking months ago we said yeah once the fall starts they're
[02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:54.600]  going to do the QE3 who could have foreseen QE unlimited so that was the
[02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:57.720]  only curveball they always give us a curveball so I guess they kept their
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:01.800]  promise no QE3 just unlimited it's like we won't you know we promise not to
[02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:05.680]  beat you now we're just going to kill you so we told the truth we're not going
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:10.840]  to beat you we're gonna we're gonna bash your brains out but had John two
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:14.440]  weeks ago for the first time in months and we talked about George Soros
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:19.920]  doubling his gold holdings in one day Paulson the head of Pemko all these
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:25.960]  big guys are rushing into gold right now it's pretty obvious when they make those
[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:30.440]  big moves where it's going yeah well I mean they they actually did it ahead of
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:34.800]  time too so yeah they could see what's happening of course I could too back in
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:39.000]  June and July you know there were so much economic problems there's so much
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:44.120]  trouble going on and I'm like oh well here we go I get to buy gold at 1550 I
[02:42:44.120 --> 02:42:49.400]  get to buy it at 1600 I even think it's a great buy at 1770 which is where it is
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:54.860]  now just because of the fact that I can see what's coming in the future they
[02:42:54.860 --> 02:42:59.240]  have not solved our economic problems fundamentally we're in worse shape than
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:02.680]  we were before they started the quantitative easing and it's gonna get
[02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:06.080]  worse and that's the problem and that's why you need to move into something
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:10.920]  hard and tangible like gold and silver like I say if you get yourself out of
[02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:15.320]  the paper currency you're getting yourself away from their game and now
[02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:20.040]  you know obviously gold confiscation is issue that's the last thing that we had
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:26.960]  talked about the 1933 $20 st. Godin is a reflection of what happened in 1933 with
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:32.200]  FDR when he closed the banks on a Monday and confiscated gold he got into
[02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:36.280]  office actually closed the banks on a Friday confiscated gold on a Monday this
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:41.000]  kind of stuff can't happen again I would suggest that you get away from their
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:45.840]  system as quickly as possible and quietly put away gold and silver that's
[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:49.440]  that's the main thing whether if it's billion coins or whether if you want
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:53.480]  something rare and collectible the only thing I can suggest is that you stay as
[02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:56.840]  close to melt as possible I don't think people should be getting into real
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:44:02.080]  high-priced rare coins and that's one of the reasons when you said hey throw the
[02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:07.320]  Obama deception we were out of the book in the the big brother book and and I
[02:44:07.320 --> 02:44:11.040]  said well that's great let's put on that let's let's get Joe Plummer's book
[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:15.080]  dishonest money and you said yeah throw the Obama deception on there and it and
[02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:19.040]  we still have the American dream video it's like the dream package of figuring
[02:44:19.040 --> 02:44:24.400]  out how this all clear of silver is been you know up in the last week it's two
[02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:29.240]  silver dollars for how much that's still I'm holding it at 63 this okay you
[02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:34.320]  can't get two silver dollars anywhere for $63 and then you get the Obama
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:38.520]  deception that really exposes what Obama's up to made three and a half years
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:43.640]  ago and light years ahead of DeSousa's film show that to people they want to
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:47.360]  understand what's really behind this the American dream film exposing the
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:53.120]  Federal Reserve of incredibly produced and a free book two free films and a book
[02:44:53.120 --> 02:45:01.280]  and silver dollars under what you can buy them anywhere 800 686 2237 Ted wants
[02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:04.960]  to introduce you to this but I will tell you we're gonna run out of the Obama
[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:09.440]  deceptions and then have to reprint them and and and so this offer won't be
[02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:12.760]  available for a while here very soon those are gonna sell out very very
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:18.200]  quickly the way they're going 800 686 2237 you can also link through from
[02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:21.800]  info wars.com they're on the right hand side as a link to that but Ted great a
[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:25.840]  lot of folks know that's a great deal in fact it's it's an insane deal I mean
[02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:30.800]  what whoa what would you say what is silver at an ounce right now well let
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:39.880]  me just give you the latest quote here it is currently trading at 34.73 two
[02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:45.280]  silver dollars right now it would be 72 dollars and 94 cents you still have to
[02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:49.200]  have it shipped to you so you would have to add another six dollars and fifty
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:53.280]  cents on top of that to get it out to you just first class without registered
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:57.840]  and insured mail yeah this is a good deal then you put those books in the
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:01.720]  videos of everything put together I mean really you're paying about half price
[02:46:01.720 --> 02:46:04.720]  for silver and you're doing this just introduce people you know get them in
[02:46:04.720 --> 02:46:08.560]  the store we're not communists here and but people should call and ask for the
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:14.480]  full spectrum radio list that that is the lowest price coins the stuff you have
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:17.760]  on the internet very competitive your other deals very competitive the radio
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:21.760]  list is whatever you've got a smoking deal on because he bought it lower and
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:25.320]  he can still sell it to you at the low price but he sold out of stuff he bought
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:30.480]  a month ago he sold out of stuff he bought two weeks ago Ted what gold and
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:35.040]  silver are you selling now from what point in the market well I can tell you
[02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:38.280]  right now you can pick up Canadian Maple Leafs right now at the moment at
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:45.840]  1935 the British sovereign right now is 485 24 the Frank is 386 74 and of
[02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:48.360]  course people are calling in and they're getting much better deals than
[02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:52.440]  that the walking Liberty half for those of you who want silver one of my
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:59.040]  favorites $16 and 88 cents we have Lakota nations at 43 just a whole long
[02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:03.660]  list people that would prefer to have the older $20 gold pieces because they
[02:47:03.660 --> 02:47:07.320]  they don't like the idea of the gold confiscation or the tens they're at
[02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:12.840]  2146 $10 liberties at 1085 there's a lot of different things that you can be
[02:47:12.840 --> 02:47:17.800]  getting into all I can say as long as there's printing money you know the
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:21.000]  feds printing money and I don't why the politicians aren't going to push for
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.880]  that because they don't want to see you know they don't want to lose their
[02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:28.880]  seats and simple we've grown with gold I've been on air with you since gold
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:33.680]  was $260 an ounce and that's why I was totally confident that it would go
[02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:37.000]  back up because we know what they're doing in fact I'd be happy if they
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:40.960]  reversed all this we were proven wrong because we'd have a country we're just
[02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:44.840]  trying to get people lifeboats here and then your support we're able to convert
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:48.200]  in a little bit of gold and silver for ourselves and pay for the radio network
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:51.160]  and everything we're doing and we're just completely up front with all that
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:54.640]  it's a win-win-win-win all the way around the Alex Jones radio specials
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:58.760]  are the best deals that's an Alex Jones special we put together with the two
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:03.840]  silver dollars you can see me right there so I mean that's it silver it
[02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:08.440]  below spot basically with two free films and a free book totally insane deal
[02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:16.240]  800 686 2237 800 686 237 now Ted how long can you hold these
[02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:19.560]  specials are you gonna have brokers there throughout the weekend yeah they'll
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:23.800]  be here throughout the weekend and again I I will raise the prices on that silver
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:29.160]  on Sunday because I mean this was priced at $26 an ounce come Monday you will
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:32.600]  not be able to order at this price so that will have to go running out of the
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:37.000]  silver you bought at 26 that's how you can offer it at this yeah well I've been

[02:56:57.520 --> 02:57:10.480]  you recite two amendments to the Constitution about the first amendment of
[02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:15.000]  about the second right to bear on 13th amendment to think this is a women's
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:21.440]  rights amendment I don't remember but well it was a car pocket Constitution
