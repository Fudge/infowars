[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:26.240]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones you've got to wonder why they've
[00:26.240 --> 00:33.200]  even had Republicans coming out and attacking the birthers I've said all along I don't know what
[00:33.200 --> 00:38.720]  the truth is about the prominence of Barack Obama he had all these different aliases Barry
[00:38.720 --> 00:44.480]  sitaro living all these different countries the media lied about that early on that's been confirmed
[00:45.440 --> 00:50.400]  and now the way the White House and the media have been acting where there is smoke it looks like
[00:50.400 --> 00:58.000]  there's fire my gut tells me he wasn't born in this country but I always stick with issues I can prove
[00:59.360 --> 01:04.720]  I like to stick with concrete info because people can't believe it you know 14 years ago and I have
[01:04.720 --> 01:08.960]  government documents that are public saying they're taking your blood and giving it to the Pentagon
[01:08.960 --> 01:15.520]  into the UN at birth and now it's mainstream news people don't believe me when I read official
[01:15.520 --> 01:20.720]  Google press releases four years ago that they're using laptop microphones and cameras to watch you
[01:20.720 --> 01:26.880]  I mean if people can't even believe me when I have all the admitted documented proof
[01:29.280 --> 01:35.120]  yes I've studied and researched from the very start the first two weeks philberg began to
[01:35.120 --> 01:43.280]  investigate it he kicked it off from the first two weeks you heard about it here
[01:43.280 --> 01:49.440]  but I've said I can't call myself a birther because I'm not a hundred percent but I think it should
[01:49.440 --> 01:55.040]  be investigated well we've got attorney philberg coming on in the next hour to break down big new
[01:55.040 --> 02:01.920]  developments like this one la times arizona house panel approves bill requiring presidential
[02:01.920 --> 02:09.280]  candidates to show birth certificates I have another headline that right at 50 percent
[02:09.280 --> 02:18.320]  of the legislature itself are saying right now they're not sure he's really natural born
[02:20.640 --> 02:23.280]  and in a strange twist of fate john mccain
[02:25.360 --> 02:30.240]  was born in the Panama canal zone and at the time he wouldn't make him viable to be president
[02:31.680 --> 02:36.640]  under the law at the time it's been changed that's why foreign service people would always
[02:36.640 --> 02:43.440]  send their wives back to the u.s to give birth and then mccain lied and said that he was born
[02:43.440 --> 02:48.720]  in a military base a u.s base one problem that base wasn't open it didn't exist for 12 years after
[02:48.720 --> 02:56.880]  he was born they don't even get their lives straight but that's nothing compared to
[02:58.480 --> 03:06.160]  being an actual foreigner but look we know obama became the first sitting president to
[03:06.160 --> 03:11.440]  be the head of the un security council in total violation of the constitution we cover that in

[08:31.920 --> 08:38.160]  last hour attorney philberg the father of the birther movement with new developments will be
[08:38.160 --> 08:45.040]  joining us like the arizona legislature voting and passing it out a committee looks like it's
[08:45.040 --> 08:54.480]  going to pass the full house to make presidents show their citizenship proof i remember the media
[08:54.480 --> 09:01.920]  a year ago still saying it was a conspiracy theory that his real name is barry sataro or sataro i mean
[09:01.920 --> 09:08.240]  that's an admitted fact it's just a more and more it looks like obama wasn't born in this country
[09:09.520 --> 09:16.000]  and when they have big national republican tv host saying birthers are as bad as truthers
[09:16.000 --> 09:26.880]  as if truthers are bad uh i mean that is outrageous and that shows how scared the system is
[09:29.040 --> 09:36.320]  so that is coming up today i have four big stacks of news here in front of me remember on
[09:36.320 --> 09:43.120]  monday drudge link to our story that was directly from city banks on website that
[09:43.120 --> 09:47.440]  the federal government has ordered them and every other major bank we've now confirmed has gotten the
[09:47.440 --> 09:53.760]  notice that they may hold your money even if it's already deposited in the account for seven days
[09:53.760 --> 09:59.760]  now the reason that's important is they can devalue your money that's what they do they
[09:59.760 --> 10:05.360]  they say you can't get your money out for a week and then when they let you get it out it's been
[10:05.360 --> 10:12.000]  devalued this is what's been done in hundreds of third world countries really i should say thousands
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.640]  you're like but there aren't thousands of third world countries there's 169 of them or so depending
[10:16.640 --> 10:24.480]  on how you gauge it over 160 well i mean mexico's devalued their currency 20 times the last hundred
[10:24.480 --> 10:30.480]  or so years or more venezuela's done it more times than i even know i mean if they just did it two
[10:30.480 --> 10:37.520]  months ago uh nigeria's done it every african country's done it all of asian countries i mean
[10:37.520 --> 10:43.920]  this it went on in germany and the weimar republic bringing hitler into power through that crisis i
[10:43.920 --> 10:49.600]  mean it's just this is how it's done like changing a tire we know what the bankers do
[10:51.120 --> 11:01.360]  and it's now all over mainstream news we're gonna go over some of it that the central banks set up
[11:01.360 --> 11:08.400]  the eu and are now robbing spain robbing portugal robbing grace by design just like iceland just
[11:08.400 --> 11:18.480]  like the us i mean it's the only issue it's the issue that creates it is the progenitor it is the
[11:18.480 --> 11:27.520]  father it sires all the corruption all the money for the corrupt system it empowers the corrupt
[11:27.520 --> 11:32.640]  elites to buy off whoever they want and it's predatory they want a world government to bring
[11:32.640 --> 11:39.200]  in carbon taxes and total control to consolidate everything into one mega global private banking
[11:39.200 --> 11:44.880]  corporation as uh gordon brown called for last friday in a speech the prime minister of england
[11:45.840 --> 11:53.360]  a global law and who makes the law a cartel of banks who met in secret three weeks ago
[11:53.360 --> 12:04.480]  in sydney australia that's the headline banks meet in secret secret location the the heads of our
[12:04.480 --> 12:15.440]  treasury departments of the world they meet in secret and now the epa head says it doesn't
[12:15.440 --> 12:19.760]  matter if there's been no warming since 1995 and suddenly they've changed their story they're going
[12:19.760 --> 12:28.240]  ahead with all the carbon taxes that's coming up city bank controversy puts dubious fdic guarantee
[12:28.240 --> 12:35.520]  back in the spotlight the recent controversy surrounding city bank's advisory to its customers
[12:37.360 --> 12:43.440]  reserving the right to impose a seven-day restriction on withdrawals from their accounts
[12:43.440 --> 12:52.240]  is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of a fractional reserve banking system and the fdic
[12:52.240 --> 12:58.720]  shaky guarantee that it can ensure deposits in the event of a bank run won't be a bank run it'll be a
[12:58.720 --> 13:08.080]  devaluation as we reported last week city banks notice informing its customers of the right to
[13:08.080 --> 13:13.200]  request seven days notice before funds can be withdrawn from all checking savings and money
[13:13.200 --> 13:19.200]  market accounts was necessary to ensure compliance with the federal reserves regulations box news
[13:19.200 --> 13:25.200]  business reported on the little known regulation yesterday in a piece by daryl our issuer would
[13:25.200 --> 13:30.560]  yes it's real on monday people are sending emails going this isn't real oh really the direct link
[13:30.560 --> 13:39.440]  the city banks on website saying i'm okay the requirement is part of a regulation d of securities
[13:39.440 --> 13:46.000]  act of 1933 the last time they shut down the banks devalue the money it applies to all that's the
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.960]  war powers act it applies to all accounts classified as negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts
[13:52.960 --> 13:57.280]  basically interest bearing checking and savings accounts held by individuals and nonprofits
[13:57.280 --> 14:03.520]  banks are not required to hold reserves in place to cover now accounts so that the rule prevents a
[14:03.520 --> 14:10.560]  run on withdrawals for which there are no reserves states the report so fox news reading from the
[14:10.560 --> 14:18.560]  government's own report says this is to stop runs on the bank for those still unaware of the fact
[14:18.560 --> 14:24.480]  it may come as a shock that your bank has no reserves with which to cover withdrawals if there
[14:24.480 --> 14:32.400]  was a sudden loss of confidence and a good old run on the bank as has happened on several occasions
[14:32.400 --> 14:41.600]  over the last two years in both the uk and the us according to a spokeswoman the bank changed the
[14:41.600 --> 14:45.680]  status of the bulk of its customer checking accounts last year to take advantage of the fdic
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.880]  policy to provide unlimited account protection to certain types of accounts when city transferred
[14:50.880 --> 14:54.880]  the accounts back to their original status it triggered the notification of the seven-day requirement
[14:54.880 --> 15:00.000]  states the reports although the fdic claims it guarantees insurance to the tune of two hundred
[15:00.000 --> 15:06.000]  thousand dollars per depositor per bank the rising number of bank failures and those placed on the
[15:06.000 --> 15:13.040]  problem list to stop fears but the tank is running dry but see that's not the larger issue i talked
[15:13.040 --> 15:21.760]  to dr roberts off air it's that they will shut the banks down and devalue and
[15:24.880 --> 15:28.800]  they don't want you running and getting your money out and having a spending spree before that
[15:28.800 --> 15:34.000]  happens it's the old stories that are confirmed in europe particularly germany where you would go
[15:34.000 --> 15:44.000]  in to eat a meal during hyperinflation and let's say some uh swine and hawken and some
[15:44.000 --> 15:57.440]  cartoffel and a and a and a side of strudel for your dessert um cost a thousand deutsch marks
[15:57.440 --> 16:04.800]  hypothetically it would be two thousand by the time you finished an hour and a half later so you
[16:04.800 --> 16:10.560]  would come in and say and they would have chalkboards with the menu constantly changing every hour
[16:10.560 --> 16:17.200]  what you had to pay until the famous film footage of a woman with a wheelbarrow of
[16:17.200 --> 16:22.480]  deutsch marks trying to buy a loaf of bread and that really happened and that's how the bankers
[16:22.480 --> 16:28.960]  rob you they print tens of trillions of the currency for themselves when it has value they
[16:28.960 --> 16:40.480]  buy up dams media weapons companies politicians real estate everything hospitals everything
[16:44.720 --> 16:48.800]  and then they devalue it and leave you holding the bag
[16:48.800 --> 16:57.920]  bag i mean it's very simple this has been done thousands of times in the last 150 years thousands
[16:57.920 --> 17:05.360]  i mean a study could be done the average third world country has had devaluation every five
[17:05.360 --> 17:13.840]  years or so and those are announced evaluations they're they're always devaluing see when i was
[17:13.840 --> 17:19.760]  growing up uh my dad explained to me with mexican pesos how they were flimsy 10 he said look their
[17:19.760 --> 17:25.840]  currencies devalued but he said look our coins used to be pure silver now they're only really
[17:25.840 --> 17:32.800]  silver plated and now they're not even that and pennies aren't even copper see we're like Mexico
[17:32.800 --> 17:43.120]  now you've been robbed and it's going to get worse and worse and worse and the government
[17:43.120 --> 17:55.600]  just puts out fake reports in the economy's better oh your dollar's going further oh big recovery and
[17:55.600 --> 18:02.160]  Geithner and vernac he go before the banking committees and say we won't tell you where the
[18:02.160 --> 18:15.040]  money is and ron paul and others say okay tell us and they say we have told you and they say well
[18:15.040 --> 18:19.120]  tell us well i won't tell you i mean i don't know how many videos i've got where they say we do
[18:19.120 --> 18:26.320]  tell you everything and they go okay tell me i won't tell you it's just a bunch of criminals
[18:26.320 --> 18:32.240]  running wild and you've got a decadent population the middle class has gotten pretty decadent in
[18:32.240 --> 18:41.520]  this country while we were being put into debt being kind of tranquilized with milk and honey and
[18:41.520 --> 18:47.040]  bread and circus and then now everything is shutting down i mean the economy is i don't
[18:47.040 --> 18:53.920]  have to tell you out there you know it is falling apart and fast and we haven't even seen the bottom
[18:53.920 --> 19:01.840]  yet we don't we're looking down this bottomless pit we can't see the bottom and until we identify
[19:01.840 --> 19:08.720]  the big private central banks as the parasites as the criminals as the problem and stop
[19:09.680 --> 19:13.520]  obsessing over personalities
[19:13.520 --> 19:24.880]  and political parties i mean that's important to a certain extent but only as far as you're
[19:24.880 --> 19:28.960]  educating the public that this government is run by a bunch of puppets
[19:32.320 --> 19:37.040]  obama was important to discredit so we could kill his agenda when they were making him a big
[19:37.040 --> 19:45.040]  movie star i put out two films that i know helped in devastating him but now he just says i'll just
[19:45.040 --> 19:49.920]  use executive orders and do whatever i want as a dictator and so now we need to come back
[19:49.920 --> 19:58.160]  and fully expose him on the birther issue to fully cause him to be lame so that he can't
[19:59.040 --> 20:04.880]  carry this out hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters thinking of calling

[24:05.920 --> 24:14.560]  network coming up i'm gonna play a clip of ron paul on the house floor talking about tyranny in america
[24:16.560 --> 24:19.120]  assassinations of americans by their own government
[24:19.120 --> 24:26.160]  a federal circuit court has ruled there's no fourth amendment that police with no probable
[24:26.160 --> 24:33.680]  cause to come in anyone's house anytime they want that's coming up ladies and gentlemen
[24:33.680 --> 24:40.080]  we are being imploded like a third world country they put the police state in place told you it
[24:40.080 --> 24:45.360]  was for terrorists we have their internal documents it's for the american people and we've got
[24:45.360 --> 24:52.800]  a chance to get this message out to the people so they can identify the real enemy
[24:55.200 --> 25:03.920]  or it's over we're being robbed and consolidated right now and the federal government's announced
[25:03.920 --> 25:09.600]  that your money markets are not insured period they'll just take them they have announced they'll
[25:09.600 --> 25:15.920]  hold your regular bank accounts they have announced that they will take your private pension funds the
[25:15.920 --> 25:21.840]  government will take them and then tax them and then give you a small portion back this is all
[25:21.840 --> 25:27.440]  being announced absolutely criminal because if you'll put up with them stealing 28 plus trillion
[25:27.440 --> 25:32.880]  you know the news is finally saying 23.7 that's a six month old number it's over 28 trillion and
[25:32.880 --> 25:37.680]  that's a two month old number probably 30 trillion by now but blumberg said 28 trillion a few months
[25:37.680 --> 25:44.400]  ago and they have the documents the point is if you'll put up with that you'll put up with anything
[25:46.480 --> 25:49.680]  and if you'll put up with treasury secretary geithner and much of the congress and the
[25:49.680 --> 25:55.280]  white house not paying their taxes but then with no due process they put liens on your house your
[25:55.280 --> 26:00.240]  business your bank account and take everything you've got and a lot of businesses aren't paying
[26:00.240 --> 26:07.440]  all their supposed taxes because they can't and then 800 plus cities including where i live
[26:07.440 --> 26:12.400]  the illegal aliens don't have to pay taxes don't get dwis don't have to have driver's license
[26:13.280 --> 26:17.360]  they get to not pay their power bill because they get to use fake matricula cards and they just use
[26:17.360 --> 26:25.040]  a new one when their power gets cut off the point is this is a system run by criminals at every level
[26:25.040 --> 26:32.000]  it's now happened we are officially a tyranny and now the tyranny wants to start shutting down free
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.960]  speech you know when hitler got into power in 33 he didn't shut down free speech right away it took
[26:36.960 --> 26:45.760]  him five six years to really lock it down any stage terror attacks to get it done
[26:45.760 --> 26:53.200]  and firebomb your own building attack your own military base it's the oldest trick in the book
[26:53.200 --> 26:59.760]  but this article by paul joseph watson who's just on fire i mean watson is such a great he's written
[26:59.760 --> 27:08.560]  two articles this morning city bank controversy puts dubious fdic guarantee back in the spotlight
[27:08.560 --> 27:13.840]  get this article out to everybody green span told bloomberg in an interview
[27:14.640 --> 27:18.640]  worst financial crisis ever including the great depression that's a quote
[27:20.800 --> 27:26.160]  oh yeah we're in trouble but the banks and the media keep telling you everything's okay
[27:26.160 --> 27:32.800]  so you just stand down and think there's gonna be a light at the end of the tunnel so you just
[27:32.800 --> 27:38.400]  kind of stand down and just hope and just maybe i'll win the lottery maybe a leprechaunal give
[27:38.400 --> 27:42.880]  me a pot of gold maybe an easter bunny i'll give me some golden eggs maybe my neighbor will give me
[27:42.880 --> 27:49.520]  a golden goose you discredit the bankers and you say we're not paying this debt like iceland's done
[27:49.520 --> 27:56.640]  oh greece is being totally absorbed by the eu they set up debt rules where they couldn't
[27:56.640 --> 28:01.200]  print their own money to get out of it and then they send in a goldman sacks operative to literally
[28:01.200 --> 28:07.440]  bring the country into receivership just like it's nigeria or argentina i mean the bankers land
[28:07.440 --> 28:11.920]  they take over your country with men and black sunglasses with submachine guns surrounding them
[28:12.480 --> 28:18.080]  and they march into armored compounds and all over the u.s all over europe police departments
[28:18.080 --> 28:25.040]  are being built with armored walls around them machine gun nest to get into them naked body
[28:25.040 --> 28:31.040]  scanners look at this article u.s diplomats add a moat to their expenses at the one billion
[28:31.040 --> 28:39.040]  london embassy and it said it's to stop rioters in the future from getting in i mean the government
[28:39.040 --> 28:50.880]  is building moats and walls and using their unlimited funds of taxpayer money to shift
[28:50.880 --> 28:57.120]  now and this has been the last six years to the number one government funded scholarship is for
[28:57.120 --> 29:02.480]  law enforcement homeland security spine they got your kids and they're just laughing look your kids
[29:02.480 --> 29:08.080]  want jobs we're giving them black uniforms weapons and we're telling them go wild shut

[29:21.520 --> 29:27.840]  against this criminal takeover and the good news is that's happening will they be able to roll
[29:28.400 --> 29:37.360]  to hijack to shanghai to bushwhack to rob the united states and europe are they going to get away
[29:37.360 --> 29:47.680]  with it that is up to you you will decide the destiny of the republic this is the battle for the republic
[29:51.040 --> 29:57.680]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:57.360 --> 34:07.040]  conspiracy theories like man make little warming not being real and now krypton dot org we've got
[34:07.040 --> 34:15.440]  him joining us tomorrow network solutions shut down his website took his domain and erased everything
[34:16.000 --> 34:24.720]  outside a court of law just did it because krypton posted an internal manual for law enforcement

[35:20.480 --> 35:27.760]  in the united states simultaneously police are arresting people everywhere for videotaping parades
[35:27.760 --> 35:31.760]  or police you'll be a hundred yards away the cops are beating somebody up you film it they
[35:31.760 --> 35:41.520]  walk up and charge you with wiretapping when there are no laws against videotaping there is no
[35:41.520 --> 35:45.760]  reasonable expectation of privacy on the street that's how they put cameras up and watch you
[35:48.400 --> 35:52.400]  and i i had a big stack of police corruption news a few days ago i was in cover i didn't even get
[35:52.400 --> 35:59.280]  to it it was cops robbing banks and cops beating people up and cops walking up to a group of women
[35:59.280 --> 36:05.680]  standing on a street corner and saying get out of here and the lady says why so they arrested
[36:05.680 --> 36:12.000]  her and court's ruling there's no fourth amendment i mean it it's here you've got foreign banks that
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.960]  came in and stole this blind they set up north common homeland security and they've got three
[36:16.960 --> 36:24.400]  million cops and growing that will do whatever they're told like north korea or mexico or china
[36:24.960 --> 36:31.280]  and for good police you better speak up and say something first let's play this ron paul video
[36:31.280 --> 36:38.320]  that's up on prisonplanet.com ron paul on tyranny in america listen to how far we've already fallen
[36:38.960 --> 36:44.080]  and once they remove the dam once the hedge is removed the protection it's unlimited that's the
[36:44.080 --> 36:53.200]  thing about tyranny it races it gallops it sprints it goes up to light speed it took a hundred plus
[36:53.200 --> 36:58.320]  years to get to this point of the bill of rights being in tatters and now they're just burning away
[36:58.320 --> 37:05.520]  the final shreds thank you mr speaker my topic for this evening is now it's assassinations
[37:06.320 --> 37:12.800]  what have we allowed ourselves to become are we no longer a nation of laws have we become
[37:12.800 --> 37:19.920]  instead a nation of men who make secret arrests our secret prisons now simply another tool of the
[37:19.920 --> 37:25.600]  federal government law enforcement is secret rendition of individuals now permitted out of
[37:25.600 --> 37:32.000]  misplaced fear have we decided that the writ of habeas corpus is not worth defending
[37:32.800 --> 37:39.600]  is torture now an acceptable tool for making us safe unfortunately the single answer to all of
[37:39.600 --> 37:45.360]  these questions from the leaders of our country and to many of our citizens appears to be yes
[37:46.240 --> 37:52.800]  and now we are told that assassination of foreigners as well as american citizens
[37:52.800 --> 38:00.720]  is legitimate and necessary to provide security for our people it is my firm opinion that nothing
[38:00.720 --> 38:10.640]  could be further from the truth secret arrests secret renditions torture and assassinations are
[38:10.640 --> 38:17.520]  illegal under both domestic and international law these activities should be anathema to the
[38:17.520 --> 38:24.480]  citizens of a constitutional republic the real threat doesn't arise from our failure to torture
[38:25.040 --> 38:31.040]  rather desensitizing our nation to the will for neglect and sacrifice of our civil liberties
[38:31.040 --> 38:38.240]  fought and died for over the centuries is the threat the concept of habeas corpus existed even
[38:38.240 --> 38:46.800]  before king john of england was forced in nine in 1215 by his rebellious barons to sign the magna
[38:46.800 --> 38:54.240]  carda this basic principle and expression of individual liberty which has survived 800 years
[38:54.240 --> 39:00.640]  greatly influenced the writing of our constitution and our common law heritage today we hardly hear
[39:00.640 --> 39:06.000]  a whimper either from the american people or a stone silent us government as our cherished
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.240]  liberties are eradicated instead we have a government that deliberately orchestrates
[39:12.240 --> 39:19.680]  needless fear and makes people insecure enough to ignore the reality of their lost liberties
[39:19.680 --> 39:27.040]  the latest outrage is the current administration's acknowledgement that we now have a policy
[39:27.760 --> 39:34.640]  that permits assassination not only of foreign suspects but of american citizens as well
[39:34.640 --> 39:41.040]  of course the cia has used secret assassinations in a limited fashion for decades despite
[39:41.040 --> 39:47.600]  international domestic and moral law when done secretly as in the past our government at least
[39:47.600 --> 39:53.680]  recognized that assassination was illegal and wrong frighteningly and astonishing however
[39:53.680 --> 40:02.560]  the policy is now explicit national intelligent director denis blare in open testimony before
[40:02.560 --> 40:09.360]  the house intelligence committee on february third of this year acknowledged that american
[40:09.360 --> 40:16.240]  citizens can indeed be assassinated at our government's discretion the u.s. government
[40:16.240 --> 40:22.720]  attempted to assassinate arnwar alaki in yemen without even charging him with a crime we're
[40:22.720 --> 40:28.320]  told this evidence is secret that he does not deserve any constitutional rights in that some
[40:28.320 --> 40:35.120]  unknown individual in the administration has the authority to declare him a threat and therefore a
[40:35.120 --> 40:42.960]  legitimate target for assassination yes i know he's probably a very bad person yes i know that
[40:42.960 --> 40:49.600]  only a few americans are on the assassination hit list yes i know that artificially generated fear
[40:49.600 --> 40:54.960]  makes a large number of americans inclined to applaud this effort which supposedly will make us
[40:54.960 --> 41:01.680]  safe but if this could become standard operating procedure and a permanent precedent is established
[41:01.680 --> 41:07.520]  let me assure you that this abuse of the law will spread it's time for congress and the american
[41:07.520 --> 41:13.680]  people to wake up to the realities of the dangers we face we must remember as members of congress
[41:13.680 --> 41:22.080]  that we have taken an oath to protect and defend the constitution from all enemies foreign and
[41:22.080 --> 41:27.920]  domestic it should not be that difficult to distinguish the difference between the danger
[41:27.920 --> 41:34.640]  posed by the underwear bomber and the danger posed by a government that endorses secret
[41:34.640 --> 41:42.080]  prisons torture and assassinating american citizens and i yield back the balance of my time
[41:45.920 --> 41:50.640]  now let's go across the pond to an article written by paul joseph watson today at prison
[41:50.640 --> 41:57.600]  planet dot com nizel ferris attacks billderberg e u president as quiet assassin of nation states and
[41:57.600 --> 42:04.480]  it's all over the european news even in roiders that the e u was set up by private central banks
[42:04.480 --> 42:10.480]  to go in and then mandate big government spending and then bankrupt countries and completely and
[42:10.480 --> 42:16.240]  totally take them over here is nizel ferris he by the way is joining us tomorrow a member of the
[42:16.240 --> 42:22.320]  european union parliament talking about how herman von rupee who's always calling for global government
[42:22.320 --> 42:28.160]  is an illegitimate fraud here it is you have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a
[42:28.160 --> 42:34.160]  low-grade bank clerk and the question that i want to ask the question that i want to ask
[42:34.160 --> 42:40.640]  that we're all going to ask is who are you i'd never heard of you nobody in europe had ever
[42:40.640 --> 42:50.160]  heard of you i would like to ask you president who voted for you and what mechanism oh i know
[42:50.160 --> 42:57.600]  democracy is not popular with you lots and mechanisms of europe have to remove you is this
[42:57.600 --> 43:05.520]  european democracy when i i sense i sense though that you're competent and capable and dangerous
[43:05.520 --> 43:11.360]  and i have no doubt that it's your intention to be the quiet assassin of european democracy
[43:11.360 --> 43:17.760]  and of the european nation states you appear to have a loathing for the very concept of the existence
[43:17.760 --> 43:23.360]  of nation states perhaps that's because you come from belgium which of course is pretty much a
[43:23.360 --> 43:32.640]  non-country but since you took over we've seen grease reduced to nothing more than a protectorate
[43:32.640 --> 43:39.360]  sir you have no legitimacy in this job at all and i can say with confidence that i can speak on
[43:39.360 --> 43:45.520]  behalf of the majority of the british people in saying we don't know you we don't want you and
[43:45.520 --> 43:53.680]  the sooner you're put out to grasp the better that's what you do you call these unelected globalist
[43:53.680 --> 43:54.560]  crooks out
[43:54.560 --> 44:02.320]  gordon brown is unelected you know that the he just stepped in for tony blair when he left
[44:03.760 --> 44:08.880]  so what is that 16 years since an election for prime minister in england
[44:14.560 --> 44:20.480]  shifting gears back to the united states is from reason magazine judge alex
[44:20.480 --> 44:27.280]  kazinsky the fourth amendment is gone welcome to the fishbowl that's a quote
[44:28.640 --> 44:33.280]  means you live in a fishbowl well of course i mean microsoft without warrants spies on
[44:33.280 --> 44:38.400]  everything their internal manual comes out for police they're just all watching you using microphones
[44:38.400 --> 44:46.320]  cameras in your house you know the awesome police chief about six eight months ago was in studio
[44:46.320 --> 44:51.680]  here and he had one of his lieutenants here and and and he was bragging oh we got better
[44:51.680 --> 44:56.400]  surveillance in the feds and i said oh like cameras and microphones is out in the green room
[44:56.400 --> 45:02.080]  in people's computers dial into those and the guy started smiling and uh the police chief said shut
[45:02.080 --> 45:09.200]  up don't talk you're here to you're here to be with me not to talk be quiet well i don't need
[45:09.200 --> 45:15.200]  the austin police to tell me that they can dial into my cell phone or if i had on star which i don't
[45:15.200 --> 45:21.520]  or into my house and listen and watch me i'm not stupid like the other cattle you feed on
[45:26.320 --> 45:29.840]  but what does this federal judge say last week the night circuit court of appeals
[45:29.840 --> 45:40.880]  denied an in bonk re hearing of the case united states versus lemmas which dealt with warrantless
[45:40.880 --> 45:47.040]  police search of a suspect's home after he was arrested outside of it as a result of the night
[45:47.040 --> 45:56.160]  circuits denial the search will stand which has left chief judge alex kazinsky none too happy
[45:56.160 --> 46:01.280]  and dissenting vote in the ruling kazinsky basically accused his colleagues of abandoning
[46:01.280 --> 46:09.600]  the fourth amendment and here is his dissenting opinion or his minority report this is an
[46:09.600 --> 46:16.800]  extraordinary case our court approves without blinking a police suite of a person's home without
[46:16.800 --> 46:21.200]  a warrant without probable cause without reasonable suspicion and without
[46:24.560 --> 46:34.400]  what's that word exigency in other words with nothing or exigent yeah with nothing at all
[46:34.400 --> 46:43.280]  to support the entry except the curiosity of the police always have about what they might
[46:43.280 --> 46:50.080]  find if they go rummaging around a suspect's home once inside the police managed to turn
[46:50.080 --> 46:58.240]  up a gun in plain view stuck between two cushions of the living room couch as we reward them by
[46:58.240 --> 47:03.520]  upholding the search and we reward them by upholding the search that i mentioned that this was an
[47:03.520 --> 47:08.880]  entry into someone's home the place where the protection of the fourth amendment are supposedly
[47:08.880 --> 47:17.440]  at their zenith that's where they the man's home is his castle the opinion misapplies supreme court
[47:17.440 --> 47:23.680]  precedent conflicts with our own case law and is contrary to the great weight of authority
[47:23.680 --> 47:30.240]  in other circuits it is also the only case i know of in any jurisdiction covered by the fourth
[47:30.240 --> 47:36.320]  amendment where invasion of a home has been approved based on no showing whatsoever nada
[47:38.400 --> 47:44.800]  gar nictus this that's latin for no evidence rain due tout
[47:47.040 --> 47:52.400]  bupkus again i don't know latin these judges all speak in it because it all goes back to that
[47:52.400 --> 47:57.840]  whatever may have been left of the fourth amendment after united states versus black
[47:57.840 --> 48:03.120]  is now gone this is the judge the chief judge the evisceration of this crucial constitutional
[48:03.120 --> 48:08.720]  protector of the sanctity and privacy of what americans consider their castles is pretty much
[48:08.720 --> 48:17.120]  complete welcome to the fishbowl that's up on info wars dot com prison planet dot com and i
[48:17.120 --> 48:23.920]  have the ruling i have the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit number zero eight

[49:01.680 --> 49:06.240]  and then i found out in life and business that most people are liars they're delusional
[49:07.040 --> 49:12.400]  they just say whatever they want and play the victim that's one of the favorite things out there
[49:12.400 --> 49:21.440]  and just will make up whatever they want it's like all these court cases we've seen where
[49:21.440 --> 49:25.280]  somebody fires a woman employee and they say sexual harassment it turns out you know they
[49:25.280 --> 49:31.040]  brag on audio tape how they made it up it's just sick you think the general public is

[56:36.320 --> 56:41.600]  chief saying this here it is do you agree with dr phil jones at the former head of the climate
[56:41.600 --> 56:46.320]  research unit at university's anglia that there has been no statistically significant global warming
[56:46.320 --> 56:50.960]  since 1995 i believe all the new information we have doesn't lead to any different conclusion
[56:50.960 --> 56:56.400]  than what we reached in the endangerment finding and that is that uh the climate is changing and
[56:56.400 --> 57:02.080]  that the mankind is responsible in part for that change and that we need to move aggressively
[57:02.080 --> 57:06.960]  we need to move to clean energy legislation we need to move to addressing carbon and putting

[1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:16.160]  we are live now eight minutes into the second hour on this 25th day of february 2010 it is
[1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:24.240]  thursday websites are info wars.com and prismpana.com for the rest of the hour we are joined by attorney
[1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:29.040]  Phillip J. Berg a former deputy attorney general of pennsylvania former candidate for governor of
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:34.720]  the u.s senate in democratic primaries former chair of the democratic party in montgomery county
[1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:39.600]  former member of the democratic state committee and attorney with offices in montgomery county pa
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:46.400]  an active practice in philadelphia pa phil is a paid live member of the n double acp and voluntary
[1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:54.160]  fire police for 27 years his website is obama crimes dot com and we've had gerome coursey on
[1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:58.160]  about this day one a year and a half ago two years ago now but the first person to really
[1:08:58.160 --> 1:09:04.400]  research this because he was concerned about it uh back when uh it was in the democratic primaries
[1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:09.200]  i guess almost two years ago or or two years ago yeah almost two years ago was phil berg
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:15.120]  and he just asked the question i mean we know this guy's name was barry sitaro we know he lived
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:20.560]  in foreign countries we know he went to madrasa's we're not saying that's a bad thing to go to madrasa's
[1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:25.120]  the point is the media would say it's a wild conspiracy theory his name wasn't barry sitaro
[1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:28.560]  then they sealed all his records no his name was barry sitaro that's now admitted
[1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:34.000]  the point is they're lying about things that are admitted then we got a certificate of a
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:39.040]  birth certificate but more and more and this is what i've always focused on it's the fake names
[1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:48.880]  uh and it's being adopted in indonesia because there's only a few countries like england and
[1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:55.760]  israel and a few others where you can have dual citizenship uh and still be uh allowed to be a
[1:09:55.760 --> 1:10:05.520]  u.s citizen much less the president and uh now glenn beck is attacking berg every week and again
[1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:10.000]  i'm tired of going after glenn beck it's just he was in the news saying global warming was real
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:17.520]  and us a today sunday on the weekend edition uh i've seen he put phil berg next to van jones
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:25.200]  and then next to deba madina and say all these people are bad um i mean just incredible behavior
[1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:32.240]  so that tells me they're desperate if now mainline talk show host not just beck but other big
[1:10:32.240 --> 1:10:39.120]  republicans are attacking phil berg uh in my experience phil berg somebody who wants the
[1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:43.840]  truth yes he called for an investigation of 9 11 in the deadly dust just like six of the 10
[1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:49.520]  commissioner members did so he gets demonized for that and uh they say oh well he was supporting
[1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:54.400]  hillary's why he did this this is beck uh no he did this because he was concerned with the
[1:10:54.400 --> 1:11:05.440]  democratic party he's a democrat and i know from the preponderance of evidence it it's 6040 it's
[1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:09.440]  leaning towards him really not being eligible and and then you get into the math of it and i know
[1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:13.120]  there's big new developments but i want phil for new listeners and people that aren't really
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:17.600]  understanding this i've just seen the media's kind of boil down deceptive boil down of what's
[1:11:17.600 --> 1:11:23.920]  happening and who berthers are to talk to the father of the berther movement uh and and you'll
[1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:29.920]  wreak recap the history of this uh but they are acting very very suspicious now they're getting
[1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:38.160]  desperate beck says five percent of conservatives are berthers uh i've seen polls of 57 percent of
[1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:43.600]  registered republicans questioning uh his birth in fact search engine that for folks for the tv
[1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:48.800]  audience majority of conservatives question obama's birth certificate i've seen that headline
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:54.160]  everywhere i mean here's one la times today arizona house panel approves bill requiring
[1:11:54.160 --> 1:12:00.160]  presidential candidates to show birth certificates nearly half of the arizona legislator wants to
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:04.640]  force president barack obama to show his birth certificate to state officials if he runs for
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:10.960]  reelection a state house committee on tuesday approved the measure sponsored 40 of the state's
[1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:15.440]  90 legislatures it would require the presidential candidates who want to appear on the ballot in
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:20.160]  arizona to submit documents approving proving that they meet the requirements to be president
[1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:27.040]  and it goes on bill requiring citizenship approved for president contenders passes house committee
[1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:37.120]  and it passed in a six to one vote so six to one uh so it's a deception to say five percent of
[1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:43.200]  america are truthers and five percent are berthers and to say berthers are dangerous bad people
[1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:50.080]  that's a glenbeck quote uh i mean that's political suicide i i think that hurt him more and why he's
[1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:55.280]  lost 12 percent of his audience according to nielson in the last three weeks then just demonizing
[1:12:55.280 --> 1:12:59.680]  and setting up deborah medina in texas i believe he lost a lot of his viewers over the berthard
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:03.600]  issue now i'm gonna shut up i've kind of laid some of the background and groundwork here
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:09.360]  philberg wants to talk about the absolute proof that he is an indonesian citizen his name's barry
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:15.600]  sataro so his name's even fake folks that's confirmed the president has an alias and it's
[1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:19.520]  one thing if you're a talk radio host have an alias or a movie star or something my name's really
[1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:24.560]  alex jones uh but a lot of times when people do have aliases i know some here locally it's because
[1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:31.920]  they have criminal histories okay and uh again his records are all sealed to break it all down
[1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:37.200]  is attorney philberg phil thanks for being here with us alex a pleasure to be on with you again
[1:13:37.200 --> 1:13:42.960]  and you have great listeners out there and um i think we're really um getting to obama
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:48.640]  significant for everyone and uh first off a real quick my background life-long democrat candidate
[1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:53.520]  for governor of the united states senate and the democratic primaries in pennsylvania and many others
[1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:59.840]  which they can find out on on my website uh obama crimes dot com life-long democrat and also then
[1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:05.520]  they throw at me i'm a racist well i happen to be a pay-to-play from the nblcp so i'm not a racist
[1:14:05.520 --> 1:14:10.160]  i just believe we should have you know equal rights in this country the rights given to us
[1:14:10.160 --> 1:14:14.720]  through our constitution the declaration of independence and the the bill of rights and
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:19.760]  what we have here is real quick is um everyone knows that arnold schwarzenegger people talk
[1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:24.880]  to him about him running for president for the last 10 or 15 years and he constantly says and amend
[1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:29.360]  the constitution because he admits he's from austria and he admits he doesn't fulfill the
[1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:34.560]  requirement the requirements for president under our u.s constitution are simple number one you're
[1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:40.160]  35 years of age number two you lived in this country for 14 years and number three you'll be a natural
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:48.080]  born citizen um arnold schwarzenegger acknowledges he's not obama doesn't say anything directly but
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:52.880]  by not saying it he's walking all over the constitution he's saying i don't care about the
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:58.080]  constitution as alex he just said all his records are sealed we really know nothing about this
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:03.920]  individual it's really outrageous that here we are 13 months after he's sworn into office
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:07.760]  that we still don't know anything but this is significant and i think we're we're making
[1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:12.960]  headway i'll tell you why first off nixon went down everyone not on the water gate break and
[1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:17.840]  he went down on the cover-up but we now have obama in office 13 months and it's a cover-up
[1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:24.640]  significant i put out a press release two weeks ago calling for a birth certificate march on
[1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:29.280]  washington we don't have a date yet as soon as we set the date we'll have it on our website now
[1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:34.640]  it's i'll call you so we can talk about it on air but significant was the next day was the national
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:40.800]  prayer breakfast in washington dc at the end of the breakfast obama spoke and he said and i'm
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:45.920]  paraphrasing for the exact words are on my website at the end of it he said no one should question
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:52.080]  my faith and then he paused and he said or my citizenship i really think we're cracking i think
[1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:58.080]  we're really getting to obama or the people around him because many times and i'm sure i said on your
[1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:03.680]  show before but i'll reiterate when all is said and done barack obama actually his real name is barry
[1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:09.520]  satura will go into that michelle obama howard dean the former head of the democrat national committee
[1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:14.160]  other officials of the democrat national committee senior campaign officials and now
[1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:18.640]  senior administration officials who know that he's a phony and a fraud should be brought into our
[1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:23.920]  criminal justice system and should be tried those convicted should go to jail and obama should go to
[1:16:23.920 --> 1:16:28.800]  jail and also he should be deported the reason i'm mentioning that is and i'm going to be putting out
[1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:34.160]  a press release shortly or this i drafted it months ago but this the timing's right but we need
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:40.400]  is a deep throat we need the deep throat regarding obama because that's what broke it with the the
[1:16:40.400 --> 1:16:46.720]  watergate because and i think it's going to happen because we're now with him saying don't question
[1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:53.360]  my citizenship um and glenn beck now going to town i don't know about this week last week i know he
[1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:59.200]  spoke about me three days he had my picture up on his uh blackboard i tried to confront him this
[1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:04.960]  uh i couldn't get to him this past saturday i was in washington dc at the zpack convention 210
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:10.080]  which is basically all the conservatives in the country uh he was a uh he was a keynote speaker
[1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:13.920]  at the end but i couldn't get to him i gave something to one of his days i'm sure i'm sure he
[1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:20.000]  won't respond i challenged him on your show right here i i challenged uh glenn beck to a debate
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:24.880]  and he told me did you see the video where he pointed at you and said these people hate america
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:29.120]  i haven't seen that i have to see that because i want to see what he's saying because what he's
[1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:34.560]  doing is he's on the verge of getting bringing out the crazies to come after me and and i have
[1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:40.000]  always called for one thing he called me an obstructionist right now um i have always called
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:44.480]  for a peaceful revolution i don't want anything to happen to obama i don't want to turn him into a
[1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:49.040]  martyr there's some other people out there are talking about different things i want a peaceful
[1:17:49.040 --> 1:17:54.880]  revolution our march in washington's going to be peaceful and then and fro yeah notice bet keeps
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:59.520]  saying that's what he does he puts your picture up and and van jones and then points in your
[1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:05.840]  direction and says these people hate america these burthers these truthers they want to hurt you
[1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:11.600]  president they don't let them be in your administration they'll kill you no he said that literally scores
[1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:18.080]  of times so he's invoking this idea of violence very dangerous it is dangerous and and if you can
[1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:22.640]  get me the actual clips on that because if he said that i'm going to ask for a retraction and if he
[1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:27.120]  won't retract it i'm going to sue him because that's what's dangerous right now if everyone's
[1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:31.520]  looked at what i've been doing this is now my 19th month doing this i've always called for
[1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:35.760]  peaceful revolution i've called for doing this through the legal system and since the legal
[1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:40.480]  system is so slow we're having good but i have this birth certificate march in washington
[1:18:40.480 --> 1:18:45.280]  probably late may early june and we're getting a fabulous response all across this country because
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:49.760]  every one of your listeners can identify with a birth certificate because they must show a birth
[1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:54.720]  certificate between one and ten times in their lifetime everyone needs it for a passport everyone
[1:18:54.720 --> 1:18:59.200]  needs its register for little league you need it for different things for marriage or you need for
[1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:04.320]  scholarships or college or school the best one you're down there in texas a woman sent me an email
[1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:09.360]  a while back from texas and she said i registered my nephew for school at the end of the registration
[1:19:09.360 --> 1:19:14.400]  my nephew said to the principal can i ask you a question principal said sure and he said how can
[1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:19.120]  i have to show my birth certificate registered for school but obama didn't have to show it
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:24.400]  to become president and that does it all when a 13 year old can identify with and then they lie and
[1:19:24.400 --> 1:19:29.600]  say he's shown his birth certificate he hasn't well no he hasn't indicated you get people who
[1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:34.400]  look like fools like chris matthew shaking a piece of paper saying this is his birth certificate
[1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:40.640]  no one has seen the birth certificate what people have seen is not even a for real document because
[1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:45.120]  at the bottom of the document it says if there's any alteration it's inbound what people have seen
[1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:51.360]  is a certification of live birth which was even for that was put on their campaign website all right

[1:23:53.920 --> 1:24:09.280]  or by calling toll free 888-253-3139 you know they're scared when they've got republicans attacking
[1:24:09.280 --> 1:24:16.880]  the birthings and you've got legislatures passing or in the process of passing laws and the states
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:21.840]  do run the federal government saying you want to be on the ballot here you got to show your
[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:27.360]  birth certificate now let's shift gears let me to the key here and it's the fact that he
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:34.080]  his real name is Barry Cetero he became an indonesian citizen he got adopted by a foreign family
[1:24:34.080 --> 1:24:40.560]  and you talk about this and the mainstream media says that's a lie when that's on record Philburg
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:46.240]  literally the key really you know the bloggers on the internet they try to say that saw birth
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:50.800]  certificate everything they we fight back and forth but we raised the issue then we shifted
[1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:55.680]  it the issue really is everyone out there the fact that he was adopted or even acknowledged in
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:25:00.400]  indonesia in his books he's sort of bound by certain things number one in one of his books he
[1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:04.640]  says he found his birth certificate so it's a bologna that he can't produce it the reason he
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:08.800]  can't produce it will show that he was born in Kenya but the second thing in his book he says his
[1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:13.840]  parents had been divorced he says my stepfather Lolo Cetero returned to indonesia before my mother
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:19.120]  and I well that's significant because in the 1960s indonesia was at war the only ones who
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:23.920]  could go to school there were those that were natural of indonesia he became natural because
[1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:28.560]  he was adopted or acknowledged we have a school record on our website his school record indicated
[1:25:28.560 --> 1:25:36.240]  his name is Barry Soturo SOETORO his nationality is indonesian and he religion is his own ladies
[1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:42.400]  and gentlemen if he hasn't legally changed his name his name is his adopted name as Barry Soturo
[1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:46.800]  that is his name and that's what it was in college and that's why it's all sealed that's right
[1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:50.560]  that's why he's doing well I also think he killed his records because I think it'll show
[1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:55.840]  he applied for and received foreign aid obama is the biggest hoax in the history of our country
[1:25:55.840 --> 1:26:02.160]  in 200 over 230 years he's a phony he's a fraud I'm not mentioned words here I've been saying this
[1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:06.640]  and I need the american support behind me you know follow me on obama crime dot com we're gonna
[1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:10.400]  have a march on a birth certificate march on washington everyone bring a copy of your birth
[1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:14.320]  certificate and and we're gonna demand that either he produced that he showed that he's
[1:26:14.320 --> 1:26:19.600]  constitutionally qualified or we're gonna ask him demand that he resigned because congress
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:24.240]  won't do anything right now congress should be in peace this is a a disaster what they have done
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:28.960]  that no loud we're in a constitutional crisis because once we get past that who becomes president
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:33.680]  that's a whole new issue another whole let me just throw this in for you before we go to break
[1:26:33.680 --> 1:26:38.320]  in a long segment time to flesh this out he says he's gonna sign executive orders on the
[1:26:38.320 --> 1:26:44.320]  carbon taxes doesn't care what the congress says they stonewall climate gate said it didn't exist
[1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:50.160]  that blew up in their face I mean it shows this is the most lying administration we've ever seen
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:55.680]  worse than nixon worse than clinton worse than bush he said no lobbyist all he hired was lobbyist
[1:26:55.680 --> 1:27:02.000]  he said not gonna expand wars expanded the wars uh he said no signing statements went back on that
[1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:09.040]  I mean this guy is continuing and expanding torture I mean this guy is a complete and total fraud
[1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:16.080]  and from your deep research lay it out looking at this what is obama's real story for his real
[1:27:16.080 --> 1:27:20.960]  story he's a phony I mean he does not he's not constitutionally qualified uh and the fact is
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:25.840]  Alex the reason he's doing the legislation he's doing and the reason his cabinet think about it
[1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:30.240]  for a minute I think the higher ups in this country the power vote there's the money people said we
[1:27:30.240 --> 1:27:34.560]  know phil bergen others are right do you want to be president you got to play ball our way think
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:39.760]  about the cabinet he has it's not the cabinet he ran on he he talks about change look about the
[1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:44.640]  legislation he's pushing is that the candidate of change I think he's being blackmailed eternally
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:48.880]  internal and I'm waiting to see what happens when china and iran get these documents because
[1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:55.120]  I'm sure they're out there and we're in a really really bad situation because of obama he is a
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:28:00.160]  fraud I one of my lawsuits is I believe he's not only not natural born he's not naturalized but
[1:28:00.160 --> 1:28:04.880]  he's an illegal alien and therefore one of my lawsuits deals with the fact that he should not
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:09.680]  been a u.s senator and therefore the salary and benefit and expenses should be returned to the
[1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:15.520]  u.s treasury of about one million dollars more important though because he's a surfer or fraud
[1:28:15.520 --> 1:28:20.400]  all the law he's passing as far as I am concerned or void or avoidable I mean we're really in a
[1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:25.040]  constitutional mess at this point and you know some people are saying oh nothing should happen to
[1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:30.160]  obama because if he goes out of office even legally mr. Burke they'll be riots in the streets
[1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:33.840]  well there shouldn't be a riots in the streets because there's one person to blame for this
[1:28:33.840 --> 1:28:39.040]  and that's barack obama remember he taught constitutional law for 10 years everyone aside
[1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:43.040]  from the schools he maybe went to we don't even know he supposedly went to occidental and columbia
[1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:47.280]  university and harvard law school where his head of the harvard law review people haven't seen his
[1:28:47.280 --> 1:28:52.080]  writings we know nothing about this person either we really know that's the whole point they release
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:58.000]  other presidents records they're being very secretive you know he signed a document sealing
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:02.720]  all his records I mean this is a total total disgrace and we're going to do everything in
[1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:08.160]  our power to expose him and force him legally out of office nothing to happen to him but force him
[1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:14.080]  to go out let him be tried he should go to jail and he should be deported and then he's got all
[1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:18.640]  this family that's here illegally too and living in slums he doesn't even help them I mean he's a
[1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:23.920]  really trashy well that says his and up in boston who's still trying to pay the immigration
[1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:28.160]  she's an illegal alien and he doesn't get near because he's an illegal alien
[1:29:30.560 --> 1:29:36.480]  an illegal alien president well we know his barack obama's a fake name I mean we know
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:42.160]  no he was indonesian citizen it's on his school records the records we do have they're not denying
[1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:46.960]  those are real they just don't want to talk about it and you're right they're blackmailing him and

[1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:04.960]  for a while and and just let you roll with this whole saga because there's a we have a lot of
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:09.440]  new listeners a lot of people just heard the media demonize burthers again why this is so
[1:35:09.440 --> 1:35:14.320]  important the whole indonesia situation and then we're going to open the phones up only on the
[1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:27.360]  burther issue folks for philberg 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 philberg thank you Alan ladies and
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:31.440]  gentlemen this issue is so important because there's nothing more important than our u.s.
[1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:37.360]  constitution and when I was contacted by an individual to do this I checked into it and I
[1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:42.160]  proceeded one thing I said from the first day I filed the first lawsuit which is august 21st
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:48.960]  2008 which is like 19 months ago I said if I am wrong Obama prove me wrong show me all the
[1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:54.160]  documentation certified from the source and I will withdraw my lawsuit nothing like that
[1:35:54.160 --> 1:35:58.960]  has forthcoming nothing he has produced nothing they keep saying referring to the same document
[1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:03.840]  that they produced as a birth certificate what they produce certificate certificate of
[1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:09.440]  live birth has no significant it doesn't have what a birth certificate had it does not have the
[1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:14.320]  baby's weight it does not have the baby's length it does not have the hospital name it does not have
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:20.000]  the doctor's name and the doctor's signature this is what's on a long-form birth certificate
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  which I've now received hundreds of them since we put out the announcement we're asking people to
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:28.400]  fax or email or mail them to us for our birth certificate March from Washington which will
[1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:33.600]  be in late May or June but more significant than the birth certificate issue because people keep
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:38.640]  arguing you know well Chris Massey said he saw it and Glenn or Riley said he saw it and I think both
[1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:43.520]  of them have backed off on those statements but more significant is the fact that he was adopted
[1:36:43.520 --> 1:36:48.000]  or acknowledged in Indonesia I'll tell you why because I had an argument the other day with a
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.880]  immigration attorney I raised the question so people could identify with this I said what happens
[1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:56.880]  about the children that are being adopted here in the United States from Haiti and he said well
[1:36:56.880 --> 1:37:01.920]  they sever all the relationships with Haiti and they take these new families last name etc etc etc
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:07.120]  I said then how can you disagree with me then when Obama's adopted in Indonesia the same thing
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:13.280]  doesn't take place he lost his word he couldn't speak the fact is when Obama entered in his book
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:18.960]  so he's like stuck on certain things his parents divorced his mother remarried he goes to Indonesia
[1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:24.400]  we have his school record which says his name is Barry Sotoro and as Alex said a little while ago
[1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:30.800]  when he was first in in the Occidental people knew him as Barry that's his name that's his legal name
[1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:35.840]  therefore unless he has legally changed his name his name is Barry Sotoro you know and many of you
[1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:40.560]  out there have adopted children or know someone that has adopted a child they take your family last
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:46.560]  name now significant is the fact is when he came back at age 10 to live with his his mother's
[1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:53.360]  parents his grandparents in Hawaii we believe that he did not go through immigration if he did go
[1:37:53.360 --> 1:37:58.400]  through immigration he would have been given a certificate of citizenship but because he became
[1:37:58.400 --> 1:38:04.160]  a natural of Indonesia he would have only become naturalized but we believe he didn't go through
[1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:10.880]  there he went back on his Indonesia passport and therefore he's an illegal alien therefore he
[1:38:10.880 --> 1:38:16.080]  cannot be a senator now significant with this only school record which is posted on our website
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:22.480]  from Indonesia his name is Barry Sotoro his nationality is Indonesia his religion is Islam
[1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:28.240]  you know he's have you believe he was never a Muslim well Islam is Muslim and after he got
[1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:33.360]  sworn into office now he's like basically catering to the Muslim you know during the campaign you
[1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:38.480]  could not use his middle name of Hussein when he was sworn in he becomes Brock Hussein Obama
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:46.320]  then he went to Egypt then he went to Egypt and said I have the same religion as you and spoke
[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:54.080]  Arabic from the Quran better than many people in the country they were shocked by it and just
[1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:59.760]  incredible and then also Alice if you recall he mentioned about the United States the United States
[1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:06.160]  he said has the largest Muslim population in the world I mean he and then he goes apologizing
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:12.000]  around the world for the for the United States actions in the past and then he bows down to
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:17.120]  the Saudi king no president ever bowed down to anyone he bows down there's a question if he
[1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:22.560]  kisses the ring also the Saudi king and then when he's in Japan he bowed down to the Japanese emperor
[1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:27.760]  and then they lie and say he's dropping things but we have the video where he clearly bows to
[1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:34.960]  everybody and it gets worse because we know that his real name is Barry Sataro we know we have a
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:42.000]  president who's using an alias we know that he was adopted and the media is not even denying that
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:47.920]  they just they just don't even cover it I mean this is this is so huge well a great point which
[1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:52.480]  you brought up because and your listeners can compare it to look what they did to Sarah Palin
[1:39:52.480 --> 1:39:57.120]  during the last six weeks of the campaign the reporters in droves went to Alaska went under
[1:39:57.120 --> 1:40:01.600]  every stone behind every door asked her all kinds of questions now think back what they did with
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:06.720]  Obama they've never asked him anything if they properly vetted Obama he would never have been
[1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:11.680]  nominated let alone be elected president I mean it's really and I was interviewed by the New York
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:15.840]  Times and I said I wish I could see the national media including the New York Times for not properly
[1:40:15.840 --> 1:40:19.920]  vetting Obama they even had the guts up they printed that they printed even so in the New
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:25.360]  York Times because it's a disgrace but the problem is and I laughed about it two years ago when I went
[1:40:25.360 --> 1:40:32.320]  to Bush questioned Russia about Putin with a free press we don't have a free press in this country
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:37.040]  most of the president's country is now by owned by three or four major corporations and there was
[1:40:37.040 --> 1:40:42.560]  a study done except the person who was really the source of the information has not allowed
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:46.480]  his or her name to be released but there's supposedly an office in the White House that is
[1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:52.560]  keeping pressure on all these media outlets to not discuss this story but we're bypassing that the
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:58.560]  American public is waking up and that's my goal this year that's my goal this to raise the public
[1:40:58.560 --> 1:41:04.800]  awareness because all of you out there excuse me must show your birth certificate now why is this
[1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:09.680]  important well there's nothing point is my opinion and many others there's nothing more important
[1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:16.320]  than the US Constitution I'm doing this for the about 305 maybe there's 308 million people in this
[1:41:16.320 --> 1:41:22.240]  country that deserve to know the truth I'm doing this for our forefathers who wrote these fantastic
[1:41:22.240 --> 1:41:27.840]  document which countries around the world have tried to copy and duplicate most have not and
[1:41:27.840 --> 1:41:34.640]  I'm also doing this out for the 1.6 million men and women who have died in battle to try to defend
[1:41:34.640 --> 1:41:40.240]  this constitution and another 1.6 million who have been injured or maimed fighting these wars
[1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:45.840]  and the millions of others who have served their great nation in war in wartime and peacetime
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:50.640]  defending this constitution and then you have brought Obama who basically doesn't care about
[1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:55.280]  the constitution and aside from the things we're talking about which is the first amendment he's
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:58.720]  talking about things on the second amendment now that I could go on and on about other issues but
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:05.200]  we'll fill let's expand let's expand on that sure for two weeks for two weeks when the climate
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:10.000]  gain emails came out the media wouldn't cover it then for another week or two they said that
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:14.880]  wasn't real then they were enforced to say okay it's real and now they admit it's all
[1:42:14.880 --> 1:42:22.480]  all been a giant fraud basically and so we see this stonewalling by Obama also saying there's no
[1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:29.760]  way our healthcare can fail it will pass it's like this Borg you will be assimilated resistance is
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:35.760]  futile statement and it's the same thing on the birther issue it is hurting him I know there's a
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:40.960]  cover up I know he hasn't released the real birth certificate I know he's blocking all the school
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:46.720]  records I know he's blocking his records when he came back to Hawaii separate from the birth
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:54.080]  certificate why would they be covering all this up if there wasn't something there it's a fact
[1:42:54.080 --> 1:42:59.200]  they're covering it up listeners it's a fact they haven't shown the real birth certificate only
[1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:06.720]  certificate alive birth it's a fact a fact a fact and it's not going to go away and if we're 13 months
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:10.800]  into his presidency then he's got the lowest approval rating of any president one year in in
[1:43:10.800 --> 1:43:16.880]  history and plunging even faster and he's breaking just every record this is devastating him whether
[1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:22.240]  he likes it or not and stalling their entire agenda which I think is a great thing regardless but
[1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:27.440]  now I'm getting to the point where it really does to me look like that he's not a citizen
[1:43:28.480 --> 1:43:34.080]  oh absolutely they up to now there's any even higher but the latest figures I had are 1.6 million
[1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:40.160]  people say it's 1.7 or 2 million for your listeners out there Obama has spent at least 1.6 million
[1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:46.720]  fighting my three lawsuits and 50 other lawsuits that came about you don't spend that kind of money
[1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:52.400]  you don't spend that kind of money unless you're really hiding something and he and he's hiding I
[1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:57.280]  want to go to college he's hiding because he's a phony and a fraud I really think and I don't know
[1:43:57.280 --> 1:44:01.840]  what your listeners I think he's being blackmailed internally and what happens when Iran gets this
[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:06.960]  what happens when China gets this what happens when Cuba gets this I think he's put our country in
[1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:12.640]  a dangerous dangerous position not only what and on top of that what he's doing but you know I can
[1:44:12.640 --> 1:44:17.280]  go on forever what he's doing but I'm concerned with Eric Holder one of my cases the case where I
[1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:21.920]  say he's an illegal alien and shouldn't have been a US senator we have one of the issues we just
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:27.600]  found our appeal to the DC circuit court of appeals if there ever was a conflict of interest
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:32.720]  ladies and gentlemen let me set it forth real quick in those type cases are called false claims
[1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:38.000]  act cases it was sealed because of that not because it was something special all false
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:42.560]  claims act cases sealed false claims after usually done in Medicaid or Medicare fraud
[1:44:43.520 --> 1:44:48.320]  hypothetically if I believe my next door neighbor is committing fraud what I would do is I would
[1:44:48.320 --> 1:44:53.040]  file this action on behalf of the United States of America and as the relator they call the person
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:45:00.080]  filing a relator re LAT or and then also that versus Jane and John Doe from next door or Jane
[1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:05.040]  and John Doe are not served the Justice Department has served the US Attorney has served and they
[1:45:05.040 --> 1:45:09.840]  have 60 days to review the case so let's equate that put up what I did I found this against
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:16.320]  Obama so Obama's not served but they're just let me be clear let me be clear in in layman's terms
[1:45:16.320 --> 1:45:24.640]  the government is not a party to the suit they don't have standing to be heard only you the
[1:45:24.640 --> 1:45:30.000]  citizen does and so are you saying that the the Justice Department has no right to even block
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:34.640]  you let me let me clarify the more actually what happens is you're bringing this action
[1:45:34.640 --> 1:45:40.400]  the government has three choices what to do number one that they can pursue the case against
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.720]  Jane or John Doe in this case against Obama number two they can give it to the relator the
[1:45:44.720 --> 1:45:49.760]  person bringing the action in this case me or number three they could dismiss the case in very
[1:45:49.760 --> 1:45:55.200]  few cases they ever dismissed the case many times they give it to the relator to produce because
[1:45:55.200 --> 1:45:58.240]  to proceed because they don't want to spend the time or money on the case
[1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:02.720]  interdependent value the how much that etc etc i understand they're defending the case is what
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:06.240]  you're saying listen i know you're very busy but i want to be able to take a lot of calls but i
[1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:10.720]  want you to also have time to speak can you stay with us about 15 minutes in the next hour as
[1:46:10.720 --> 1:46:14.960]  long as you want me i'll stay two days i'll stay a week with you you're great well we're going to
[1:46:14.960 --> 1:46:18.400]  then let you finish up and then we're going to take calls for 30 minutes into the next hour
[1:46:18.400 --> 1:46:24.080]  because i want to hear the different angles and points that listeners will bring up on this front
[1:46:24.080 --> 1:46:29.280]  but but shifting gears again i want to get this question out there what do you think of the Arizona
[1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:35.680]  House passing it out a committee six to one and now it looks like right at half of the legislature
[1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:41.440]  is set to vote and they're gaining votes that they may pass a law in arizona saying if obama
[1:46:41.440 --> 1:46:47.040]  runs again in the next two years starts his campaign up to be on the ballot there in arizona
[1:46:47.040 --> 1:46:51.600]  that he's going to have to show his real birth certificate i think it's fabulous it just shows
[1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:55.920]  that that the issue i started and and i was i don't care who courses to finish line with it
[1:46:55.920 --> 1:47:00.320]  i'm glad i'm out there and i'm gonna stay with this issue i think it's bad with a congressman i
[1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:04.480]  don't have his name from florida introduced legislation in the house of representatives in
[1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:08.480]  washington uh... to the same effect that after two thousand twelve
[1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:12.800]  the uh... any presidential candidate have to show that they're constitutionally qualified
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:17.680]  only about seven to ten other republicans joined in that action no democrats now why
[1:47:17.680 --> 1:47:22.320]  haven't the democrats joined because the democrats know he's a phony but this is great
[1:47:22.320 --> 1:47:27.440]  to say that washington's not doing arizona is that fabulous and i hope other states do do that
[1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:32.400]  and i think it's they're realizing that the constitution i mean stop and think everyone
[1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:36.880]  out there we have such great things in this country and why do we have it we have it because
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:41.760]  we've fought to defend this we were we had a fight with england to form our country
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:46.240]  you know people have died defending this constitution and we have this fraud this phony
[1:47:46.240 --> 1:47:52.000]  of obama coming up there the biggest hoax in our history it's wrong everyone out there let me stop
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:57.920]  you again let's say let's say he really was born in hawaii why is he covering it up but let's go
[1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:04.640]  further he was adopted and became an indonesian citizen that's on record right and then he tried
[1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:09.200]  to lie about that even though it's in his book and now i've seen him in a few speeches we played
[1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:13.440]  it a few months ago maybe we can pull it up in fact try to youtube obama refers to himself as
[1:48:13.440 --> 1:48:18.960]  barry he's even joked around and called himself barry sataro as if he's trying to inoculate
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:24.560]  people to this fact because he knows it's coming out oh absolutely i think we're really getting
[1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:29.840]  to him um i think it just shows i mean again why would you spend what are you doing but the
[1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:35.360]  significant part is he's adopted in indonesia once he's adopted in indonesia even if he was born
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:41.360]  in hawaii he would lose his natural born status and how just relate this i relate that story to
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:45.440]  you what the immigration attorney told me about people being adopted from haydie they cut off
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:50.000]  where they came from well then obama would have come off from from here but but i think that's
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:56.400]  all baloney because i don't think he was born in hawaii um when when jerry coursey went to uh
[1:48:56.400 --> 1:49:01.600]  kenya to do some uh they had him arrested they put him on house arrest right they wouldn't let him
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:05.840]  do anything except wait they wouldn't let him go talk to the village where he were obama was born
[1:49:05.840 --> 1:49:12.800]  right right and we have on our website we have the step grandmother sarah obama in swahili
[1:49:12.800 --> 1:49:18.240]  and we have the translation stating she was in the hospital when he was born in bombasa kenya
[1:49:18.240 --> 1:49:23.200]  now at the end of the tape there's some kids y'all no no hawaii she stated definitely she was in the
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:27.760]  hospital when he was born that's more significant than anything they've produced they produce one
[1:49:27.760 --> 1:49:31.920]  thing that document which is a phony then they keep saying well there were two newspaper articles
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:37.920]  saying he was born my my children live i'm in i'm in pennsylvania my children live in other states
[1:49:37.920 --> 1:49:43.120]  when my grandchildren were born i put announcements in here in my local paper that i have a new grand
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:47.360]  child that doesn't mean he was born there that doesn't mean my children are born here they're
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:51.760]  not they're born elsewhere so that and that's their strongest argument well what do you think his
[1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:55.680]  mother planned ahead he was going to run for president that's why she put it in the newspaper
[1:49:55.680 --> 1:50:01.440]  no i think the mother really wanted him to be a citizen but the word is he was in kenya and she
[1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:06.800]  couldn't fly back because she was too pregnant well that's exactly what a mother would do she
[1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:11.360]  would come back and try to dummy it up even if she had no idea he was going to run for president
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:16.960]  she'd want him to be a us citizen correct because especially then and even now even though right
[1:50:16.960 --> 1:50:21.520]  now i think we're troubled waters because of the many things obama is doing people fight to get to
[1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:26.880]  the united states because we have freedoms i mean the sad part is all ladies gentlemen we're listening
[1:50:26.880 --> 1:50:31.440]  to this we take for granted some of these freedoms you have in this country and you shouldn't i remember
[1:50:31.440 --> 1:50:36.000]  with being my children going through a train over in europe a number of years ago and we were stopped
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  because we took a train through at that time checkers of akia and we didn't have the correct
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:45.680]  papers for that the conductor thank god hid me and my children if not they were armed guards came on
[1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:50.640]  that thing and checking with people to take them off you don't realize what freedoms you have here i
[1:50:50.640 --> 1:50:55.280]  mean what we're talking about here today alex when your show you couldn't be doing this in russia

[1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:28.400]  is the guy who two years ago saw some of this documentation and said i'm gonna investigate deputy
[1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:33.200]  attorney general previously in the state run for governor member of the n double acp prominent member
[1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:40.480]  but i believe on their board they're in that state and they've said every horrible thing
[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:48.320]  in the world about him he's racist all this crud and even obama being african is a fraud
[1:54:48.320 --> 1:54:55.120]  african as in not arab because there are arab africans he's six percent african
[1:54:56.640 --> 1:55:03.520]  six percent he's 44 percent arab 50 percent anglo-saxon i don't care what color he is
[1:55:04.240 --> 1:55:08.000]  the point is that's a distraction just like when you say you don't want socialist health care
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:12.240]  which it wasn't even that it was a insurance company scam even um howard dean said that now
[1:55:12.240 --> 1:55:18.160]  and then it's percentage that's why it's dead in the water even when that came out that uh christ
[1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:28.160]  matthews and uh carlos watson and others said this is racism it's racism racism to say i don't
[1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:32.560]  want health care so they're playing the race card and it's totally blowing up in their face

[2:00:27.040 --> 2:00:32.160]  segment briefly recap some stations carry the second half of the show why the bertha issue
[2:00:32.160 --> 2:00:34.960]  was so important we're taking calls from the bottom of the hour when he leaves us
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:38.880]  then lindsay williams with more inside info directly from the highest levels of global
[2:00:38.880 --> 2:00:42.240]  power structure on what they're planning with the dollar and the economy
[2:00:43.360 --> 2:00:47.840]  philburg you heard julio's points quit comments on that before we go to more calls well i think
[2:00:47.840 --> 2:00:52.160]  it's it's discussing that uh back tries to associate me with these other people and tries
[2:00:52.160 --> 2:00:57.040]  to tie me in that i hate america i don't hate america i do this because i love america and i'm
[2:00:57.040 --> 2:01:00.880]  going to i'm going to challenge back he won't do it i'm going to challenge him to a debate
[2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:05.360]  he's got the uh nerve to put me up there and talk about me i'm going to challenge him to a debate
[2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:11.760]  he probably won't do it and uh but uh it's wrong what he's doing and it's wrong making me connotations
[2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:17.360]  i want peace i want a peaceful revolution i want uh this through the court system and not
[2:01:17.360 --> 2:01:22.160]  through that i'm going to embrace the american public of a birth certificate march to washington
[2:01:22.160 --> 2:01:26.400]  which will be peaceful and demand that if he can't prove that he's constitutionally eligible
[2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:30.960]  that he resigned can you see a million people there with a copy birth certificate and obama
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:34.960]  like not doing the meeting would have to cover them by the way at these town halls as you know
[2:01:34.960 --> 2:01:41.520]  for a year now republican and democrats will say no he's american citizen and literally the whole
[2:01:41.520 --> 2:01:47.600]  room starts screaming at him even at democrat events people are sick of this and obama crimes
[2:01:47.600 --> 2:01:53.280]  dot com is your website i've seen it on tv i've heard it where he puts you up there next to
[2:01:53.280 --> 2:01:58.560]  the weathermen and others and says these people hate america they're dangerous folks send those
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:02.640]  videos because there's millions of listeners you can find them i have a small staff i've seen it i
[2:02:02.640 --> 2:02:07.040]  i don't have time to go dig it out it would take maybe 10 hours you know dig through hundreds of
[2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:12.800]  shows send it all the philberg help him so he has the info but also support obama crimes
[2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:16.240]  dot com let's go to matt in ohio matt you're on the air go ahead
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:24.080]  hey alex hotfield um i may not be way out in left field here but uh what do you think the
[2:02:24.080 --> 2:02:31.040]  chances are that the puppet masters the people that pull obama strings and the higher the higher
[2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:38.480]  up the government are going to let obama's true uh identity as first to get all that out
[2:02:39.920 --> 2:02:46.560]  at the right time to get him impeached in order to impose more law with us to be able to
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:52.160]  keep better track of our saying you're saying that could be the false flag it would cause riots
[2:02:52.160 --> 2:02:57.280]  all sorts of problems uh fill your take on it well you know i'm going to demand when we get him out
[2:02:57.280 --> 2:03:00.960]  of office that we're going to do it we're going to demand we'll hold the news conference i'm going to
[2:03:00.960 --> 2:03:06.720]  call the top politicians of this country and the religious leaders and say you plan to uh cause riots
[2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:11.360]  in the streets and damage property and injure kill people why the only person responsible for this
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:15.840]  is barack obama no i don't think they're going to let it out i think what's going to happen is the
[2:03:15.840 --> 2:03:20.880]  american public is going to demand it i think about 20 million people know about this help me raise
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:26.400]  the public awareness to 100 million people we will force him out of office because this is outrageous
[2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:32.560]  what he is doing and uh yeah it's to he's out to disrupt the tear apart our country it's just like
[2:03:32.560 --> 2:03:36.480]  climate gate in the first month when they said it wasn't real and now it blew up in their face and
[2:03:36.480 --> 2:03:41.280]  they've all admitted they're liars right it's the same thing they're stonewalling the truth can't be
[2:03:41.280 --> 2:03:46.640]  stopped we know he's an indonesian citizen we know his real name's bary sitaro that's enough right
[2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:52.160]  there under law because he can't be a natural explain that to people filled well once he's
[2:03:52.160 --> 2:03:57.840]  adopted there he becomes a natural of indonesia and therefore when he came back according to
[2:03:57.840 --> 2:04:02.640]  our immigration law he would only become naturalized but someone did what's called a FOIA request
[2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:07.600]  freedom of information request send me a copy they asked for a copy of obama's birth certificate
[2:04:07.600 --> 2:04:12.400]  it came back to me never had one now they didn't check for bary sitaro but i think he never had

[2:08:20.080 --> 2:08:27.520]  texas alex jones we have the father of the birther movement attorney phil burge obama crimes
[2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:36.000]  dot com with us former deputy attorney general in his state member of the n double acp democrat
[2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:41.760]  who during the primaries began to investigate obama he's just on record his real name's barris
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:46.960]  hitaro a citizen of indonesia that's the only record we can get he admits that but says it's
[2:08:46.960 --> 2:08:52.160]  no big deal and the media never covers that they just say we've shown the birth certificate these
[2:08:52.160 --> 2:08:57.680]  people are lying why has obama sealed all of his school records because the real name's barris hitaro
[2:08:57.680 --> 2:09:02.800]  and a lot of people are coming forward saying he was called barris hitaro then and that he was
[2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:08.160]  getting foreign aid now we're going to go back to your calls david john nick ronald nother's
[2:09:08.160 --> 2:09:15.760]  questions for phil burge only on the subject of the birther issue and where his court cases are going
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:21.040]  but here's the associated phil go ahead i was gonna tell that's right i just want to say something
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:25.200]  because many people say well our parent can't be now you know give up their children's rights
[2:09:25.200 --> 2:09:32.080]  well that's true to a point but if obama wanted to do that between the ages of 18 and 21 he would
[2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:38.000]  have had to renounce his indonesia citizenship and reaffirm any citizenship that he did have
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:42.080]  for the united states there's no evidence he did that either he sealed all those records
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:46.880]  the college everything let's play this clip just like everybody else buried from dc called virginia
[2:09:46.880 --> 2:09:52.640]  governor uh... tim canes radio show to complain about traffic but buried from dc was really
[2:09:52.640 --> 2:09:57.120]  president barack obama who surprised came with a prank call just like everybody else
[2:09:57.120 --> 2:10:03.360]  buried from dc now here is obama this is associated press a couple months ago this was
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:10.880]  december 22nd 2009 last year calling in using his real name here it is governor let's get back to
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:16.480]  the phones and let there's some cars we have a very from dc's calling go ahead bury well uh...
[2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:22.000]  governor came this is uh... actually president united states call him uh...
[2:10:22.640 --> 2:10:29.680]  no how about you know i've got questions about uh... about traffic in northern virginia
[2:10:30.800 --> 2:10:38.320]  but uh... rather than go there i i just wanted to say how proud we are of your service uh as
[2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:43.760]  governor of the commonwealth of virginia and uh...
[2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:47.200]  wish you and the family all the best uh... okay
[2:10:47.200 --> 2:10:48.160]  christmas season
[2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:50.800]  and it goes on that's a p news right there
[2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:51.920]  a p video
[2:10:51.920 --> 2:10:55.440]  uh... so it's a big joke to him to use his real name in infill
[2:10:55.440 --> 2:10:56.960]  yeah it really is but
[2:10:56.960 --> 2:10:58.720]  but when he doesn't acknowledge it
[2:10:58.720 --> 2:11:02.200]  it just reinforces the words i've been using that he's a fraud and he's a
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:02.880]  phony
[2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:05.640]  you notice the secret services and coming after me because i'm talking the
[2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:06.880]  truth
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:10.480]  that he's a party to put in the big hope in the issue of our country ladies and
[2:11:10.480 --> 2:11:10.960]  gentlemen
[2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:12.360]  we must stop it
[2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:14.600]  well it's worse i could play video
[2:11:14.600 --> 2:11:17.400]  from vermont in from uh... missouri
[2:11:17.400 --> 2:11:20.040]  where they had police go on the news and say
[2:11:20.040 --> 2:11:21.840]  if you criticize obama
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:24.840]  and say he's not a christian or say he wasn't born here
[2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:27.960]  we're going to arrest you did you ever see that video
[2:11:27.960 --> 2:11:30.600]  now i heard about it so tender to me i'd like to see that one
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:34.280]  in fact uh... as air in the headline i think it's something like uh... thought
[2:11:34.280 --> 2:11:36.080]  police in in in missouri
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:39.000]  uh... but but the point is no that was on tv
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:42.880]  i mean uh... that they were on tv saying we will arrest you so that shows
[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:46.040]  the mindset it and it turned out the obama campaign
[2:11:46.040 --> 2:11:48.580]  was having local democrat police
[2:11:48.580 --> 2:11:49.920]  and sheriffs
[2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:54.480]  and uh... prosecutors come out and threaten people i mean this is
[2:11:54.480 --> 2:11:57.760]  uh... drum course you got the documents the emails from obama when he was in the
[2:11:57.760 --> 2:11:59.560]  senate to his cousin
[2:11:59.560 --> 2:12:01.000]  odinga
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:02.240]  threatening
[2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:03.360]  uh... to
[2:12:03.360 --> 2:12:07.980]  uh... and saying cause riots so you lost the election cause riots and they'll
[2:12:07.980 --> 2:12:10.600]  give you a position in the government and they did
[2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:11.540]  what they created that
[2:12:11.540 --> 2:12:13.040]  not only causing riots
[2:12:13.040 --> 2:12:16.360]  what they did is because right they said prior to church is with people live
[2:12:16.360 --> 2:12:19.080]  they burned down churches they burn people alive
[2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:20.360]  i mean it's a good point
[2:12:20.360 --> 2:12:24.000]  and i think that the head of all of them to do it right and then i think that
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:27.280]  the head of obama raise a million dollars for a good time
[2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:30.640]  and then by doing all that they force it out there that was given a position of
[2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:32.400]  the government over there
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:35.400]  gather before they just had president what they made a prime minister ship
[2:12:35.400 --> 2:12:36.880]  foreign
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:39.880]  i mean because they were burning everything down and obama told him in
[2:12:39.880 --> 2:12:40.820]  the email
[2:12:40.820 --> 2:12:42.040]  go burn it
[2:12:42.040 --> 2:12:45.640]  i mean this guy's a terrorist there's no doubt about it let's uh...
[2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:48.800]  let's take another call here david mayn you're on the air david
[2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:51.120]  yes gentlemen i have a comment and a question
[2:12:51.120 --> 2:12:52.460]  uh... good job so
[2:12:52.460 --> 2:12:54.400]  uh... i will
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:59.600]  refer to our president from here on as president saturo and i recommend
[2:12:59.600 --> 2:13:02.800]  anybody else do the same and people people ask you
[2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:05.560]  but what are you you know what about all about them explain to them everything
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:06.840]  that you've laid out
[2:13:06.840 --> 2:13:10.400]  and my question is a constitutional crisis question
[2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:14.360]  if it's found out if we can prove that he's a legitimate i believe he is
[2:13:14.360 --> 2:13:16.800]  then every executive order
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:19.600]  every bill he signed every treaty
[2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:21.200]  every foreign agreement
[2:13:21.200 --> 2:13:22.880]  is invalid
[2:13:22.880 --> 2:13:26.840]  what happens then if it's a three years into the presidency
[2:13:26.840 --> 2:13:29.480]  and it's all comes out and he has to leave
[2:13:29.480 --> 2:13:32.480]  it's it's no doubt about it
[2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:33.240]  you know
[2:13:33.240 --> 2:13:37.040]  it's pointless or everything he's done is is bad so that sounds great
[2:13:37.040 --> 2:13:40.280]  yet i think that's why i don't want to wait three years i want to get it this
[2:13:40.280 --> 2:13:40.880]  year
[2:13:40.880 --> 2:13:43.720]  that's why i want the people that don't want they will have to get out of the
[2:13:43.720 --> 2:13:44.440]  march
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:48.840]  because he is a funny everything he did that is going to avoid avoidable
[2:13:48.840 --> 2:13:52.480]  um... it really is great and we are a constitutional crisis because
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:55.240]  and it would take another whole show i can't go in the whole thing about who
[2:13:55.240 --> 2:13:56.600]  would become president
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:13:59.480]  he used to vote and i don't know the amendment used to vote separate for
[2:13:59.480 --> 2:14:00.840]  president vice-president
[2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:04.040]  you've laid out jointly for them to therefore i don't believe i don't
[2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:06.040]  become because of the fraudulent ticket
[2:14:06.040 --> 2:14:10.040]  does it go back to january eight the joint session of congress with congress
[2:14:10.040 --> 2:14:13.640]  finally their duty because they were only a vote for the their duty was to vote
[2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:15.000]  for cap the votes
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:17.720]  electoral college vote for a qualified person
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:20.800]  so does it go back there because of one member of the house one member of the
[2:14:20.800 --> 2:14:21.640]  senate
[2:14:21.640 --> 2:14:25.800]  had given a written objection they were going to the separate half of senate
[2:14:25.800 --> 2:14:29.080]  to discuss the issue that they didn't agree they would have dominated
[2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:31.240]  whoever they wanted for president vice president
[2:14:31.240 --> 2:14:34.760]  but because they didn't do their job does it go back to december fifteenth
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:38.120]  when all the electors met the state capitals of the various states
[2:14:38.120 --> 2:14:41.800]  and they voted but improperly because they were always supposed to vote for a
[2:14:41.800 --> 2:14:44.920]  constitutionally qualified candidate or does it go back to november eighth
[2:14:44.920 --> 2:14:47.480]  election day we have a real mess on our hands but we
[2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:50.280]  i believe that mess has to be dealt with
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:54.520]  more so than keeping obama of fraud here we gotta move quick and i appreciate
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:14:59.480]  your call speaking about threats it came out in major newspapers last year
[2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:04.760]  that there's 25 people on obama's hit list and of course i'm number 24
[2:15:04.760 --> 2:15:08.120]  on there and it said that bertha groups in yourself are also
[2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:12.760]  on the list and there is no doubt that they've got an enemy's list that people
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:14.600]  need to be praying for all of us
[2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:18.120]  i okay yes please pray for me everyone out there
[2:15:18.120 --> 2:15:21.640]  absolutely and also spread the word so you have you don't know when the march
[2:15:21.640 --> 2:15:25.240]  is going to be yet well now we're working on that to have a date i'll call
[2:15:25.240 --> 2:15:28.200]  you back and then we'll have it up on our website and we'll tell you how we get
[2:15:28.200 --> 2:15:32.280]  on your show and spread the word but the initial reaction
[2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:35.640]  response for people is phenomenal people want to do something because it's
[2:15:35.640 --> 2:15:39.000]  something they can do and every one of your listeners can identify with a
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:43.400]  birth certificate issue one other thing the people that obama associated with
[2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:46.440]  heirs and the reverend right and all those people etc etc
[2:15:46.440 --> 2:15:49.480]  you know he couldn't even get a job as a chicago police officer
[2:15:49.480 --> 2:15:53.400]  with who he dealt with he couldn't get a job as an fbi agent or secret service
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:55.960]  agent because this but yet the secret service is
[2:15:55.960 --> 2:15:58.840]  protecting him well doesn't even make sense
[2:15:58.840 --> 2:16:02.520]  i'm not saying this is a good thing but i understand why it's been done
[2:16:02.520 --> 2:16:05.720]  in the old days if you weren't three four fifth generation
[2:16:05.720 --> 2:16:10.120]  you couldn't be fbi or secret service because it was important that that that
[2:16:10.120 --> 2:16:13.960]  you not be a spy because when the constitution was ratified for those
[2:16:13.960 --> 2:16:17.640]  that don't know they had cases of austria
[2:16:17.640 --> 2:16:21.400]  sending its people members of its government it's ruling class
[2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:25.000]  and royalty in to poland and other countries
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:28.600]  to try to get elected and take over those nations
[2:16:28.600 --> 2:16:32.680]  and so this has always been an old problem and if this guy
[2:16:32.680 --> 2:16:36.600]  i mean his real name's barry sataro how is he our president as you say
[2:16:36.600 --> 2:16:39.720]  the indonesia thing is bonafide a hundred percent
[2:16:39.720 --> 2:16:43.080]  that right there disqualifies him forget the birth certificate
[2:16:43.080 --> 2:16:46.760]  right yep absolutely and uh we're running an ad on that the
[2:16:46.760 --> 2:16:49.320]  next weekend the paper washington times and
[2:16:49.320 --> 2:16:52.840]  we'll be doing another ad to cross the country if we the more money we raise
[2:16:52.840 --> 2:16:56.040]  will spread the word we must spread the word around the country and we want to
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:16:58.680]  have a march on washington like we never saw
[2:16:58.680 --> 2:17:03.000]  all right let's talk to john and main john you're on the air go ahead
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:10.120]  hi please tell how his collegiate records are being sealed or were sealed
[2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:14.760]  his adult records how does that operate so i can show mom
[2:17:14.760 --> 2:17:18.520]  well the reason that i i was the first one to come out i believe his college
[2:17:18.520 --> 2:17:22.440]  records are sealed for one reason it could show he applied for and receive
[2:17:22.440 --> 2:17:25.560]  barn aid either no he's asking how were they sealed
[2:17:25.560 --> 2:17:28.840]  how were they sealed he had executive order he signed a day of uh
[2:17:28.840 --> 2:17:33.480]  that he was sworn into office so the first thing on his mind
[2:17:33.480 --> 2:17:37.000]  when he got sworn in and had that executive power was to keep his record
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:41.080]  secret absolutely absolutely because he doesn't want to
[2:17:41.080 --> 2:17:44.360]  we know to think about we know nothing about him we haven't seen one thing from
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:46.840]  him john does that answer your question
[2:17:46.840 --> 2:17:50.760]  yes do you know the number of that executive order no i don't want to show
[2:17:50.760 --> 2:17:54.120]  my mom hey guys search engine obama signs executive order
[2:17:54.120 --> 2:17:57.400]  sealing records i remember that the news on january 22nd
[2:17:57.400 --> 2:18:00.840]  obama signs executive order sealing records thanks for the call john
[2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:04.600]  let's talk to nick and colorado nick you're on the air go
[2:18:04.600 --> 2:18:08.920]  hey um i just was wondering um if we um if since we know that the shadow
[2:18:08.920 --> 2:18:12.200]  government basically put obama into his position
[2:18:12.200 --> 2:18:15.160]  my question is um why do you think that
[2:18:15.160 --> 2:18:19.160]  um they didn't put somebody in there that could produce the documents or just
[2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:22.840]  you know produce documents for him since they get have i'll answer the question
[2:18:22.840 --> 2:18:26.440]  they knew he was slick and a darling they could blackmail him
[2:18:26.440 --> 2:18:29.720]  uh and controlling with the information with it being compromised
[2:18:29.720 --> 2:18:33.880]  and they love to violate our constitution and sovereignty like obama
[2:18:33.880 --> 2:18:36.840]  became the first i'm gonna play this later to you guys cue it up
[2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:40.200]  in fall the republic we have him becoming the first u.s president
[2:18:40.200 --> 2:18:43.880]  to coach to to chair the un security council
[2:18:43.880 --> 2:18:48.520]  that violates the constitution philberg yes it does violate the constitution
[2:18:48.520 --> 2:18:52.120]  and uh i think they put him up because when i get the phone call you got to
[2:18:52.120 --> 2:18:55.560]  think about this ladies and gentlemen the phone call i got was they said phil
[2:18:55.560 --> 2:18:59.000]  you're the only attorney in the country we know with brist you know what
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:02.840]  they would do obama and then that was an honor i took here but
[2:19:02.840 --> 2:19:06.280]  since then other attorneys have joined suit but it's very rare you're going to
[2:19:06.280 --> 2:19:09.720]  find someone that wants to challenge the president or someone of that statue
[2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:12.280]  and i did it because i think there's nothing more important than our
[2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:15.320]  constitution and there's very few of us that will do
[2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:18.040]  something like that
[2:19:19.240 --> 2:19:23.000]  absolutely uh and again i meant to have it queued up from fall the republic we
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:26.360]  did like five minutes in the film i'll play before the show ends today after
[2:19:26.360 --> 2:19:30.440]  you leave us specifically on him and cnn said he's now
[2:19:30.440 --> 2:19:34.760]  president of the world he has to swear the un oath and we give the subsection
[2:19:34.760 --> 2:19:37.960]  of the constitution where it says you can't do that i mean this is
[2:19:37.960 --> 2:19:43.240]  outrageous and anything he does the national media is not anything
[2:19:43.240 --> 2:19:45.640]  detrimental but nationally does not cover it
[2:19:45.640 --> 2:19:50.680]  all right we're gonna jam in nick ronald bob and john's quick questions quick

[2:24:19.160 --> 2:24:23.000]  about four minutes from fall the republic where i break down obama becoming the
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:26.680]  head of the un and i'll give you the chapter in verse the constitution
[2:24:26.680 --> 2:24:31.240]  where it's treason ronald in new jersey you're on the
[2:24:31.240 --> 2:24:35.800]  air with phil burr go ahead uh yes sir mr burr galaxy thank you very
[2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:39.560]  much um just to be quick i have a question that i've been
[2:24:39.560 --> 2:24:42.360]  trying to get a good answer to for about a year
[2:24:42.360 --> 2:24:45.800]  um i agree with everything you said i think that there's ample evidence that
[2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:50.120]  there is no bar certificate but even if there was even if obama was born in
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:53.240]  hawaii just by virtue of the fact that his father
[2:24:53.240 --> 2:24:57.400]  was never an american and had he lived could very well be
[2:24:57.400 --> 2:25:02.040]  be really much uh kenya doesn't that in itself contradict but what was
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:05.160]  intended by the founders and in pointing term natural born
[2:25:05.160 --> 2:25:09.400]  citizens um i don't i don't believe so um and that's an argument other attorneys
[2:25:09.400 --> 2:25:12.440]  have come forth with i don't believe that because
[2:25:12.440 --> 2:25:15.560]  we keep changing the definition of natural born
[2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:19.080]  for this reason um if husband and wife boyfriend and girlfriend are traveling
[2:25:19.080 --> 2:25:22.360]  anyplace in the world and a child is born if both are u.s citizens
[2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:25.480]  their child when it comes back through immigration and get the passport as
[2:25:25.480 --> 2:25:29.320]  considered natural born the statute here which was changed
[2:25:29.320 --> 2:25:32.680]  when obama was supposedly born august 4 1961
[2:25:32.680 --> 2:25:37.000]  the american citizen this case the mother had to convey natural born status
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:40.680]  how to live in this country for 10 years and five of these years had to be after
[2:25:40.680 --> 2:25:44.600]  the age of 14 14 at five is 19 she was only 18
[2:25:44.600 --> 2:25:48.280]  so she couldn't convey natural born so so we've got them right there
[2:25:48.280 --> 2:25:52.600]  i mean it's it we have all over the place the guys are fraud
[2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:57.560]  the guys are phony his real names barry sataro bob in texas bob you're on the
[2:25:57.560 --> 2:26:00.600]  air go ahead
[2:26:00.600 --> 2:26:04.440]  yeah i have two quick comments a comment for mr bird
[2:26:04.440 --> 2:26:09.560]  was that uh back before the election i actually taught i was able to get through
[2:26:09.560 --> 2:26:14.760]  and uh and talk to john moody the vice president of fox news and uh his excuse
[2:26:14.760 --> 2:26:18.200]  for them not covering it is that it's quote unquote not their job
[2:26:18.200 --> 2:26:21.320]  and that people shouldn't be lazy and do the work themselves
[2:26:21.320 --> 2:26:26.920]  um which i found your phone's really bad you have a question
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:31.320]  no just just comment why thank you that's an interesting comment because fox
[2:26:31.320 --> 2:26:35.640]  not their job a fox um very strange they came out of new york spent an hour and
[2:26:35.640 --> 2:26:39.000]  a half driving down here filming for an hour and a half went back to new york
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:43.480]  never aired one minute of it but then if it's not their job then how come all
[2:26:43.480 --> 2:26:47.400]  the media including fox ripped apart and maybe fox didn't do it all the other
[2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:52.600]  media ripped apart cherub hillan you know their job now fox is going after you
[2:26:52.600 --> 2:26:56.600]  great guns with the birther thing i mean it's incredible folks
[2:26:56.600 --> 2:26:59.880]  i mean that is wrong if philberg even if he was wrong
[2:26:59.880 --> 2:27:03.160]  has a right to ask these questions this is outrageous
[2:27:03.160 --> 2:27:06.200]  that glenn beck's doing that and i don't want to attack glenn beck but i'm sick
[2:27:06.200 --> 2:27:09.320]  of him okay let's talk to uh john in wisconsin
[2:27:09.320 --> 2:27:13.560]  john you're on the air with philberg go ahead it's mr bird are you still uh
[2:27:13.560 --> 2:27:16.680]  looking for someone with a common ancestor and that would uh convey a
[2:27:16.680 --> 2:27:19.160]  material interest in the birth certificate sure
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:23.240]  sure are you with anyone yeah i have a common ancestor
[2:27:23.240 --> 2:27:26.280]  uh disadvantage of being a mayflower family there only so many white people
[2:27:26.280 --> 2:27:29.080]  want to come afterwards and we'll see what we can do with it they'll probably
[2:27:29.080 --> 2:27:32.200]  they'll probably won't they'll come up with some excuse but but yeah that's too
[2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:35.080]  far back i mean if he's related to the mayflower
[2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:37.560]  then i'm related to obama on both sides of my family
[2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:41.160]  yeah that's true too there's probably too far back but contact me we'll see what
[2:27:41.160 --> 2:27:43.640]  we can do thank you sir thanks for the call
[2:27:43.640 --> 2:27:47.480]  now let's talk to george in connecticut you're on the air with philberg go ahead
[2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:51.960]  hey alex uh door you're a hard man to get through too hard four times
[2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:55.880]  but anyway the main point is both you guys should try to sue through the
[2:27:55.880 --> 2:27:59.000]  english court through for them trying to slander you whatever especially for
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:03.080]  you with with the financial times because you don't even have to prove
[2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:06.760]  that they slandered you they have to prove that they innocently uh or they
[2:28:06.760 --> 2:28:10.360]  were innocent of not slandering you and then being made to murdoch
[2:28:10.360 --> 2:28:14.440]  uh... papers and magazines and and uh... institutions
[2:28:14.440 --> 2:28:18.360]  guaranteed their rebroadcast there you can sue their pants off and own them
[2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:19.880]  and then use their own money to
[2:28:19.880 --> 2:28:23.720]  to kick their ass all over the world george it's a good point
[2:28:23.720 --> 2:28:27.480]  you have been slandered by the murdoch papers in england i've seen it
[2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:30.680]  and i have as well uh... what about that
[2:28:30.680 --> 2:28:34.040]  uh... interesting point uh... the only i'm swamped right with the obama thing
[2:28:34.040 --> 2:28:34.760]  but uh...
[2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:38.040]  but we'll have to consider that uh... you know for you and the alex every
[2:28:38.040 --> 2:28:41.640]  week i think it's a money out of people but more i'm more concerned right now
[2:28:41.640 --> 2:28:45.640]  with using my efforts throughout the obama or better to throw
[2:28:45.640 --> 2:28:49.080]  and uh... we'll worry about you know that's the big fish that's the big
[2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:52.360]  fish we've got a fried jamming in one more call
[2:28:52.360 --> 2:28:55.880]  chris in maryland you're on the air

[2:29:02.920 --> 2:29:07.080]  but the real issue isn't your hand at ease in your glenn beck isn't the real
[2:29:07.080 --> 2:29:10.840]  problem the progressives that are taken over our nation
[2:29:10.840 --> 2:29:14.280]  absolutely but the problem is back supported the banker bailout
[2:29:14.280 --> 2:29:17.480]  back says global warming's real now we've discredited

[2:29:21.800 --> 2:29:25.640]  and uh... but i mean what's your point there
[2:29:25.640 --> 2:29:29.480]  is that the progress of the number i believe maybe a hundred percent of the
[2:29:29.480 --> 2:29:32.600]  democrats in the majority of the republicans together
[2:29:32.600 --> 2:29:36.120]  are all progressive in destroying the constitution there after the cost of

[2:29:55.480 --> 2:30:02.040]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[2:33:01.320 --> 2:33:19.960]  probably presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[2:33:19.960 --> 2:33:24.120]  okay i'm gonna play about a four five minute clip for my film fall of republic
[2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:28.120]  on a separate issue of treason i mean he should be impeached right now for this
[2:33:28.120 --> 2:33:33.000]  alone this is absolute fact you're about to hear
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:37.160]  but i want to go to a call of the disagrees because i didn't see them
[2:33:37.160 --> 2:33:41.240]  there on hold ted in north carolina disagrees
[2:33:41.240 --> 2:33:44.760]  i guess with the whole birth certificate issue or him being very sataro
[2:33:44.760 --> 2:33:48.920]  uh... so go ahead uh... ted uh... what i disagree with is you're telling us this
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:33:52.840]  is the big fish who's the uh... foreign usurper we've got
[2:33:52.840 --> 2:33:56.600]  dozens of members in congress and the senate that are dual citizens of another
[2:33:56.600 --> 2:34:00.520]  country and they've already acted on that start some wars that we shouldn't have
[2:34:00.520 --> 2:34:01.640]  been in
[2:34:01.640 --> 2:34:05.960]  and you've got this disgrace lawyer on who's been fine ten thousand dollars
[2:34:05.960 --> 2:34:09.560]  and had to do hours of ethics classes for
[2:34:09.560 --> 2:34:14.920]  a legal malpractice okay well i don't know what you're talking about
[2:34:14.920 --> 2:34:19.080]  now i'll comment on that you know i have had hundreds of cases
[2:34:19.080 --> 2:34:24.120]  since i was admitted to practice in 1970 which is 39 years ago
[2:34:24.120 --> 2:34:27.000]  at one case we admit we screwed up one
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:31.400]  i'm not perfect okay out there and i think it's fine okay that's not the point
[2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:35.000]  the point is here and the point of when you mentioned members of congress dual
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:38.920]  citizenship that's different situation that's not the person running for
[2:34:38.920 --> 2:34:41.320]  president or the server that is president
[2:34:41.320 --> 2:34:45.160]  well let me stop you uh... ted i appreciate your call but let me say this
[2:34:45.160 --> 2:34:48.600]  we're dealing with barack obama who is starting all these new wars
[2:34:48.600 --> 2:34:51.320]  philberg's been anti-war the entire time
[2:34:51.320 --> 2:34:55.800]  i know doctors dentist lawyers there isn't a doctor or a dentist that i know
[2:34:55.800 --> 2:34:58.920]  who hasn't had somebody try some malpractice thing on them
[2:34:58.920 --> 2:35:02.280]  that happens to any lawyer who's been a deputy attorney general or anybody
[2:35:02.280 --> 2:35:05.000]  else and and and so to sit there and say
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:07.800]  you know that that philberg was disciplined once
[2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:11.640]  i mean all the real lawyers i know are constantly getting disciplined
[2:35:11.640 --> 2:35:15.560]  so for you to see this is a red herring we're talking about
[2:35:15.560 --> 2:35:19.400]  barack obama is real name being very sataro
[2:35:19.400 --> 2:35:22.680]  and this guy calls in talking about israel you know i was talking about
[2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:25.160]  israel and all the problem with ron emmanuel
[2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:29.960]  and been in israeli military uh... last week i mean we we we cover all this
[2:35:29.960 --> 2:35:33.880]  stuff and then people get even matter because that's not the only subject
[2:35:33.880 --> 2:35:38.120]  that we cover philberg i mean phil would you be for a dual citizen
[2:35:38.120 --> 2:35:41.160]  of israel or any other country being president
[2:35:41.160 --> 2:35:45.880]  so there you go i mean again it's a red herring let's talk to andy
[2:35:45.880 --> 2:35:49.640]  uh... in new jersey andy you're on the air yes uh... thank you alex both of you
[2:35:49.640 --> 2:35:51.080]  gentlemen definitely
[2:35:51.080 --> 2:35:55.240]  we've read white and blue and that's why i listen to you in as far as mr berg
[2:35:55.240 --> 2:35:58.680]  i've been to i've been hearing him on tv or
[2:35:58.680 --> 2:36:02.920]  uh... radio and i know he's never waffle than he sticks to a story that man is
[2:36:02.920 --> 2:36:06.520]  powerful on alex he paid you a nice compliment because
[2:36:06.520 --> 2:36:10.280]  uh... a manifest that you're uh... definitely wants to get his word out
[2:36:10.280 --> 2:36:13.800]  for you because you're the john poll jones of this country right now now the
[2:36:13.800 --> 2:36:18.200]  reason why i call i believe this country has received his biggest terrorist
[2:36:18.200 --> 2:36:22.040]  attack short of a nuclear bomb today obama
[2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:26.760]  got what part of me today the financiers of barry sartoro
[2:36:26.760 --> 2:36:30.760]  got him into this office he's clearly a terrorist
[2:36:30.760 --> 2:36:35.480]  bomb in this country as we speak right now mr berg
[2:36:35.480 --> 2:36:38.760]  well i i i i can't disagree with it i mean
[2:36:38.760 --> 2:36:42.280]  if he's not a phony then what are you doing here he's definitely a muslim
[2:36:42.280 --> 2:36:46.120]  he's apologized to the united states he's out there uh... bowing to uh... sortie
[2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:48.840]  king bowing to the japanese emperor you know
[2:36:48.840 --> 2:36:52.760]  this is a sending our country in the wrong direction at a time we clean it up
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:57.080]  by peaceful revolution and you know what alex you've helped me
[2:36:57.080 --> 2:37:00.120]  the with your passion for this and you're a very intelligent man

[2:37:43.720 --> 2:37:46.520]  one guy that disagreed with him i put him to the head of the line
[2:37:46.520 --> 2:37:49.720]  when his call came in and it wasn't about the birth certificate
[2:37:49.720 --> 2:37:53.480]  or indonesia or burry sartoro or any of it
[2:37:53.480 --> 2:37:57.160]  it was about uh... israelis okay obama
[2:37:57.160 --> 2:38:00.680]  is full of israelis in his cabinet i mean it's just it's just it's just
[2:38:00.680 --> 2:38:04.760]  craziness it's just uh...
[2:38:04.760 --> 2:38:07.800]  there's so many issues we cover here on the show
[2:38:07.800 --> 2:38:11.320]  now here is a clip from the two hour twenty five minute film
[2:38:11.320 --> 2:38:15.560]  fall the republic get it on dvd at info wars dot com the people are ready to be
[2:38:15.560 --> 2:38:18.680]  woken up order the dvd make copies get it out to people
[2:38:18.680 --> 2:38:23.640]  here it is the finance heads of the twenty industrialized nations
[2:38:23.640 --> 2:38:27.800]  met again in late september of two thousand and nine at the g twenty summit
[2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:35.160]  in pittsburgh pennsylvania at that meeting ministers called for an end to the
[2:38:35.160 --> 2:38:39.640]  dollar as the world reserve currency
[2:38:39.640 --> 2:38:43.800]  they also called for a strengthening of global governance
[2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:49.080]  and called for the new world order while the bankers were busy carving up the
[2:38:49.080 --> 2:38:52.760]  world at the g twenty summit barack obama was in new york city
[2:38:52.760 --> 2:38:55.960]  at the united nations because he's got a new job
[2:38:55.960 --> 2:38:59.400]  to chair the united nations security council
[2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:03.000]  the most powerful position in the world government body
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:07.880]  president obama does what no other u.s president ever has it
[2:39:07.880 --> 2:39:11.720]  president obama presided over the u.s most powerful body
[2:39:11.720 --> 2:39:15.080]  that would be the security council thousand one hundred
[2:39:15.080 --> 2:39:18.520]  and ninety first meeting of the security council for a couple of hours you
[2:39:18.520 --> 2:39:21.640]  could say mr obama was president of the world
[2:39:21.640 --> 2:39:24.680]  it is the story of a world that understands that no difference or
[2:39:24.680 --> 2:39:27.960]  division is worth destroying all that we have built
[2:39:27.960 --> 2:39:32.440]  in my own country it has brought democrats and republican leaders together
[2:39:32.440 --> 2:39:36.280]  leaders like george schultz bill perry henry kissinger
[2:39:36.280 --> 2:39:41.720]  and sam nun who are with us here today barack obama is the first president to
[2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:45.880]  hold two posts simultaneously and there's a good reason for that
[2:39:45.880 --> 2:39:49.480]  it's illegal article one section nine of the constitution
[2:39:49.480 --> 2:39:55.000]  forbids any u.s president from serving any foreign government or institution
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:59.720]  he swears an oath to protect and defend the constitution of the united states
[2:39:59.720 --> 2:40:03.480]  but now barack obama has sworn allegiance to the global government
[2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:09.240]  and the united nations that he heads up let that sink in real good
[2:40:09.240 --> 2:40:14.280]  barack obama now heads the united nation security council
[2:40:14.280 --> 2:40:17.480]  you cannot serve two masters and obama isn't
[2:40:17.480 --> 2:40:22.600]  he's selling out the last vestiges of sovereignty that this country had
[2:40:22.600 --> 2:40:25.560]  this ladies and gentlemen is the destruction of our nation
[2:40:25.560 --> 2:40:28.920]  and it's also high treason
[2:40:31.240 --> 2:40:36.520]  obama's lies are obvious and out on the open he hides in plain sight and from
[2:40:36.520 --> 2:40:40.280]  the moment he took office his lies have only increased
[2:40:40.280 --> 2:40:44.200]  despite the fact that his ratings have dramatically dropped since election day
[2:40:44.200 --> 2:40:47.880]  from the mid 80s to the low 40s a large portion of americans
[2:40:47.880 --> 2:40:53.160]  still gullibly hang on his every word it is bringing entertainment to thousands

[2:41:23.800 --> 2:41:27.640]  oil companies he wrote a book 20 plus years ago about how there was enough
[2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:30.360]  oil to run the whole country for hundreds of years in alaska
[2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:33.320]  that's now come out in congress everything he says been proven accurate

[2:41:45.480 --> 2:41:48.600]  meeting they said there they were going to jack up
[2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:52.760]  oil prices we just kind of moved on from there
[2:41:52.760 --> 2:41:56.360]  from jim tucker daniel usland sources inside

[2:42:11.480 --> 2:42:13.800]  get killed if you don't shut up about how
[2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:17.800]  we've got uh you know plenty of oil uh and
[2:42:17.800 --> 2:42:22.200]  but he said you can't tell people this oil's going to go up to 150 dollars of
[2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:25.320]  barrel and then it was about 65 it did in that next year
[2:42:25.320 --> 2:42:29.080]  and then went down as the fellow said it would now going back up

[2:44:05.080 --> 2:44:08.440]  all he said how much the dollar is going to change
[2:44:08.440 --> 2:44:15.080]  in value in the next 12 months 2010 he said that 30 to 50 percent and he
[2:44:15.080 --> 2:44:17.720]  elaborated it went on second thing he talked about is
[2:44:17.720 --> 2:44:23.240]  dubai city compared to dubai world oh he said chaplain make a distinction
[2:44:23.240 --> 2:44:28.760]  between the two because he said dubai world's default on 80 billion dollars
[2:44:28.760 --> 2:44:33.240]  he said it has literally because they are the number one promoter of derivatives
[2:44:33.240 --> 2:44:37.240]  in the world today it has caused the entire world
[2:44:37.240 --> 2:44:40.520]  banking system to be on the verge of collapse then
[2:44:40.520 --> 2:44:44.040]  he went on to talk about gasoline prices crude oil
[2:44:44.040 --> 2:44:47.800]  compared to where prices are going to go in relation to the dollar
[2:44:47.800 --> 2:44:51.880]  i was amazed he almost laughed at me on the phone when i asked one particular
[2:44:51.880 --> 2:44:55.080]  question he talked about the elections in november
[2:44:55.080 --> 2:44:59.080]  oh my goodness uh he was very emphatic about it and
[2:44:59.080 --> 2:45:03.880]  uh alex i am i'm still standing here done founded over what he said about
[2:45:03.880 --> 2:45:09.160]  Israel invading kamas and he knew if the forward ever happened
[2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:13.160]  i mean these elitist plan everything then he went into
[2:45:13.160 --> 2:45:18.040]  afghanistan pakistan and yaman and had some very definite words about this
[2:45:18.040 --> 2:45:20.920]  and alex before we take these one by one please
[2:45:20.920 --> 2:45:25.720]  let me say to your audience folks i lived with the elite of the world for three
[2:45:25.720 --> 2:45:28.360]  years time i have kept in touch with him over the
[2:45:28.360 --> 2:45:31.960]  past 35 years every time they've told me something
[2:45:31.960 --> 2:45:36.840]  it has happened exactly as they say it folks i want you to believe everything
[2:45:36.840 --> 2:45:41.000]  that alex jones says on his programs he is right
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:45.480]  he's trying his best to tell you things that are difficult to believe sometimes
[2:45:45.480 --> 2:45:50.440]  believe it he's telling you the truth i know it from first-hand experience by
[2:45:50.440 --> 2:45:53.880]  living with these people and talking with them over these years
[2:45:53.880 --> 2:45:57.480]  and folks i just wish the goodest i could come in your home right now

[2:46:06.280 --> 2:46:09.320]  miss a day because if you do you're gonna miss something important
[2:46:09.320 --> 2:46:13.080]  so let's see let's break this down let's break this down we have city bank and
[2:46:13.080 --> 2:46:15.400]  other banks saying they'll hold your money for seven days
[2:46:15.400 --> 2:46:19.000]  they're openly talking about devaluing the currency fox news even has the
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:22.040]  report from the government saying they may have a run
[2:46:22.040 --> 2:46:26.120]  that's up on prisonplanet.com today on the article paul watson wrote
[2:46:26.120 --> 2:46:30.040]  we have the the feds announcing that they won't insure money markets which is
[2:46:30.040 --> 2:46:34.920]  most people's savings we see grease falling spain on the
[2:46:34.920 --> 2:46:38.760]  verge of falling iceland being robbed by these people
[2:46:38.760 --> 2:46:43.480]  we see them moving we we're starting to see commodities
[2:46:43.480 --> 2:46:48.360]  go up and two weeks ago the news of australia reported a secret banker meeting
[2:46:48.360 --> 2:46:51.960]  with the 24 central bank heads discussing
[2:46:51.960 --> 2:46:55.720]  unified concerted global currency devaluation
[2:46:55.720 --> 2:46:59.560]  is that when you talk about banking and the dollar going down
[2:46:59.560 --> 2:47:02.200]  specifically what did he say on point number one
[2:47:02.200 --> 2:47:06.120]  about a 30 to 50 devaluation in the next 12 months
[2:47:06.120 --> 2:47:10.120]  alex what you have just said to your audience every single bit of it is the
[2:47:10.120 --> 2:47:14.040]  truth it all fits in with what this gentleman had to say to me
[2:47:14.040 --> 2:47:18.920]  keep in mind that these people think in a completely different world in realm
[2:47:18.920 --> 2:47:22.600]  than what the average american thinks and we're going to have to just
[2:47:22.600 --> 2:47:27.720]  think think in the mentality of the elite the thought patterns of the elite
[2:47:27.720 --> 2:47:30.920]  and that's the reason i've written two books to try to explain
[2:47:30.920 --> 2:47:34.760]  their thought patterns now so let me begin in a way that the average person
[2:47:34.760 --> 2:47:37.640]  can understand it everybody wants to know the future i don't care who they are
[2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:39.960]  even you and i alex would like to know the future
[2:47:39.960 --> 2:47:43.240]  and this is probably the only reason i keep in touch with these people
[2:47:43.240 --> 2:47:46.680]  i don't like talking with them believe me it is not
[2:47:46.680 --> 2:47:50.040]  it's not because you call him or did he call you
[2:47:50.040 --> 2:47:53.720]  uh... i called him because i wanted to know what's going on in 2010 now he's
[2:47:53.720 --> 2:47:56.280]  gotta know you're talking to the public
[2:47:56.280 --> 2:47:59.560]  or he knows exactly why i was calling it first of all i called out
[2:47:59.560 --> 2:48:02.120]  called to find out how he went through his operation
[2:48:02.120 --> 2:48:05.080]  keep in mind this gentleman is 87 years of age
[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:08.680]  he is very feeble yeah when he called you a year and a half ago or two years
[2:48:08.680 --> 2:48:13.160]  ago he almost died that's young yes and as a result he said to me
[2:48:13.160 --> 2:48:16.840]  the other alex this is amazing he said to me on the phone he said chaplain
[2:48:16.840 --> 2:48:19.960]  williams i'm too old to care please tell him everything
[2:48:19.960 --> 2:48:24.840]  i mean alex can you imagine having the privilege of telling everything
[2:48:24.840 --> 2:48:29.000]  that the insiders of the elite have to okay let me begin so that the average
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:32.040]  person can understand it let's go to the future
[2:48:32.040 --> 2:48:35.240]  uh... what you are hearing on alex joneshowe
[2:48:35.240 --> 2:48:39.880]  what you're hearing me say today it didn't come from a fortune teller or palm
[2:48:39.880 --> 2:48:43.480]  reader didn't come from the zodiac of the horoscope but he leaves
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:48.520]  this came directly from an elitist himself who i talked with on the phone
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:52.440]  on yesterday and these are the people who control the world
[2:48:52.440 --> 2:48:55.800]  i'm going to begin with the necessities of life
[2:48:55.800 --> 2:49:00.600]  uh... i know we just left a plow into what's happening in the g7 and all that
[2:49:00.600 --> 2:49:03.000]  sort of thing but let me go down to the simple
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:05.400]  point so that the average person can understand it
[2:49:05.400 --> 2:49:09.160]  and here it is now i know this sounds quite different because you've got to
[2:49:09.160 --> 2:49:12.120]  understand that the elite don't think like we think
[2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:17.160]  there or here we go there will be no shortage of food and water
[2:49:17.160 --> 2:49:20.920]  now i've got to clarify this please you
[2:49:20.920 --> 2:49:27.400]  you will not be able to buy it i mean this is the methodology of the elite
[2:49:27.400 --> 2:49:31.320]  are so astounding the grocery store shelves will be full
[2:49:31.320 --> 2:49:37.400]  in 2010 and 2011 2012 but you're going to go hungry
[2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:42.440]  and the elite already have it planned to do things in the exact opposite way
[2:49:42.440 --> 2:49:46.520]  than what the average person is thinking and please don't be offended at me
[2:49:46.520 --> 2:49:50.360]  now today i'm just trying to tell you what this man told me
[2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:53.960]  that is so important to you he said you well here's
[2:49:53.960 --> 2:49:57.880]  i'm going to read it verbatim i wrote it down as he was saying it you
[2:49:57.880 --> 2:50:02.600]  will lose 30 to 50 percent of the value of your money
[2:50:02.600 --> 2:50:08.520]  in the next 12 months time and he said in our new world order plan
[2:50:08.520 --> 2:50:12.600]  if the strawberries all freeze out in florida we merely bring them in from
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:15.800]  other countries if everything in the sister's crop in california
[2:50:15.800 --> 2:50:18.680]  fails this year we may only bring them from somewhere else
[2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:22.200]  there's not going to be any shortage on the grocery store shelves whatsoever
[2:50:22.200 --> 2:50:26.040]  you see there are some encouraging notes in this whole thing and talking with
[2:50:26.040 --> 2:50:28.760]  these people even though they're many negative notes
[2:50:28.760 --> 2:50:31.800]  he went on to say the reason that you'll go hungry
[2:50:31.800 --> 2:50:36.360]  is because you're going to lose 30 to 50 percent of the value of your currency
[2:50:36.360 --> 2:50:39.720]  in the next 12 months time it's already planned
[2:50:39.720 --> 2:50:42.680]  they're going to do it by a number of methods which he mentioned
[2:50:42.680 --> 2:50:45.800]  stay there we got to go to break we're going to come back and go through
[2:50:45.800 --> 2:50:49.320]  point one and there's five or six big key points
[2:50:49.320 --> 2:50:53.080]  that he brought up to you people laughed at lindsay when we had 60 dollar 40
[2:50:53.080 --> 2:50:56.760]  dollar a barrel oil it went up to 150 exactly as he said

[2:54:22.040 --> 2:54:26.280]  with these top oil executives and who wrote several best-selling books on the
[2:54:26.280 --> 2:54:30.200]  subject is in contact with one key individual
[2:54:30.200 --> 2:54:33.960]  who's very close to death's doorstep whistling past the cemetery
[2:54:33.960 --> 2:54:37.960]  so he's just bragging about all the things they're doing and it
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:42.280]  meshes very accurately with our sources inside bilgerberg group
[2:54:42.280 --> 2:54:45.480]  and what Lindsey's talked about has come true over and over again
[2:54:45.480 --> 2:54:48.520]  unfortunately we wish this information was not accurate
[2:54:48.520 --> 2:54:51.960]  okay you were going into the dollar losing 30 to 50 percent in the next 12
[2:54:51.960 --> 2:54:55.480]  months continue Alex i must give you all the glory at
[2:54:55.480 --> 2:54:58.600]  this point and state that by the providence of god is the only reason i
[2:54:58.600 --> 2:55:02.040]  want your show today and by the providence of god is the only
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:04.760]  reason that i a little insignificant unknown
[2:55:04.760 --> 2:55:08.120]  missionary out in the bush of Alaska was allowed to sit on the board meetings
[2:55:08.120 --> 2:55:10.840]  of the elite of the world for a three year period
[2:55:10.840 --> 2:55:14.360]  therefore what you hear today it will happen folks
[2:55:14.360 --> 2:55:18.520]  out there in the listening audience please believe me at least as far as this
[2:55:18.520 --> 2:55:20.760]  elitist believes i mean i mean if things might but
[2:55:20.760 --> 2:55:26.120]  go ahead keep start breaking it down yeah let's break it down 35 30 to 50
[2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:29.240]  percent he said you're going to lose in the value of your currency in the next
[2:55:29.240 --> 2:55:33.080]  12 months that means that they literally are going to go into your bank
[2:55:33.080 --> 2:55:36.040]  account and withdraw he said it'll be the bottom
[2:55:36.040 --> 2:55:39.880]  the very least that you're going to lose is 30 percent of the purchasing power
[2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:43.000]  of your currency the federal reserve note he said
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:47.320]  you probably will lose 50 percent and this is within
[2:55:47.320 --> 2:55:52.200]  12 months 2010 people i'm giving you what's going to happen
[2:55:52.200 --> 2:55:56.280]  this year back as you remember about four five months ago we talked about a
[2:55:56.280 --> 2:55:59.880]  two-year timeline that they have i'm talking about today
[2:55:59.880 --> 2:56:03.640]  12 month period you will lose probably 50 percent
[2:56:03.640 --> 2:56:07.800]  that means they're going into your bank account your savings account your ira
[2:56:07.800 --> 2:56:12.040]  and by the methods that they have planned they will literally withdraw
[2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:15.640]  50 percent of the purchasing power of your currency
[2:56:15.640 --> 2:56:19.560]  therefore as i said a moment ago there will be plenty of food and water on the
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:23.480]  grocery store ships but you will not be able to buy it okay
[2:56:23.480 --> 2:56:27.880]  let's go to the next item crude oil i know all of you want to know where the
[2:56:27.880 --> 2:56:32.280]  price of gasoline is going but i've got to explain it the way
[2:56:32.280 --> 2:56:35.720]  he put it uh and he talked about this in depth on
[2:56:35.720 --> 2:56:39.320]  yesterday on the phone by the way please without listening audience
[2:56:39.320 --> 2:56:43.800]  on wednesday yesterday the 24th i was on the phone with this gentleman
[2:56:43.800 --> 2:56:48.840]  he said crude oil prices as you remember they went down from 147 to 50 they've
[2:56:48.840 --> 2:56:51.880]  come back up now and i said to him on the phone
[2:56:51.880 --> 2:56:55.240]  i almost called his name i said to him on the phone
[2:56:55.240 --> 2:57:01.240]  it's back up to about $2,780 barrel i said where is it going
[2:57:01.240 --> 2:57:05.480]  these people have a way of being sarcastic and he said in a very sarcastic
[2:57:05.480 --> 2:57:09.720]  matter he said no chaplain the price of crude oil
[2:57:09.720 --> 2:57:16.840]  is not $80 a barrel it's $50 a barrel how do you refuse a man
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:20.600]  who who is one of them you don't just outright
[2:57:20.600 --> 2:57:24.520]  blurt out and say something to him i said would you please explain
[2:57:24.520 --> 2:57:28.280]  let me stop you was actually in the main let me stop you was in yesterday's
[2:57:28.280 --> 2:57:31.880]  news that crude oil is actually lower but we're
[2:57:31.880 --> 2:57:36.440]  paying three dollars a gallon on average so that they're scamming us go ahead
[2:57:36.440 --> 2:57:40.040]  yeah and the way he explained it is he said chaplain
[2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:44.280]  crude oil prices are still exactly where i told you they were going to go
[2:57:44.280 --> 2:57:47.400]  he said i told you they were going to $50 a barrel
[2:57:47.400 --> 2:57:52.120]  he said that's in relation i hope to please try to think in terms of the elite
[2:57:52.120 --> 2:57:57.320]  here he said that is in terms of the purchasing power of the of the dollar
[2:57:57.320 --> 2:58:00.360]  at the time that i told you it was going to happen
[2:58:00.360 --> 2:58:04.840]  he said six months ago the purchasing power of the dollar was $50 a barrel
[2:58:04.840 --> 2:58:08.120]  that's what they were getting but he said yet it takes all the arabia
[2:58:08.120 --> 2:58:11.800]  $80 a barrel to maintain their infrastructure
[2:58:11.800 --> 2:58:16.040]  he said they're losing money every day and it's all here's a prediction
[2:58:16.040 --> 2:58:20.840]  folks watch it you saw Dubai go down it was over the Thanksgiving holidays
[2:58:20.840 --> 2:58:25.240]  they said 80 uh let's say 80 billion dollars worth of

[3:02:06.440 --> 3:02:10.760]  it's fifty dollars a barrel and i said please try to explain alex you know i

[3:02:14.360 --> 3:02:18.200]  and i'm so glad that he verified to you that he
[3:02:18.200 --> 3:02:23.160]  actually talked with this individual back about five to six years ago before i
[3:02:23.160 --> 3:02:27.080]  was no longer allowed to give out any names no i know he does that i mean i'm
[3:02:27.080 --> 3:02:31.080]  dr monty really ferrets things he's always checking up on me to make sure
[3:02:31.080 --> 3:02:34.440]  but yes i've talked to him he's talked to the guy i know his name
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:38.200]  but but lindsay we know this guy's a high-powered guy and we know he's telling
[3:02:38.200 --> 3:02:41.320]  you this we know it's turned out accurate in the past now let's continue
[3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:44.840]  here dollar loses 30 to 50 next 12 months
[3:02:44.840 --> 3:02:48.840]  a whole bunch of big banks in the middle east go under opaque countries go under
[3:02:48.840 --> 3:02:51.880]  did he give you the order of this i mean read your notes to us
[3:02:51.880 --> 3:02:56.920]  yes here it is watch crude oil now this is it this this is a sign that was given
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:03:01.160]  to me and you watch it and please understand the depth of this watch
[3:03:01.160 --> 3:03:05.880]  crude oil prices and you will know the progression of the elite and here's the
[3:03:05.880 --> 3:03:09.720]  way he explained it he said yes we are going to allow the
[3:03:09.720 --> 3:03:14.120]  opaque oil producing countries of the world to have in purchasing power
[3:03:14.120 --> 3:03:17.960]  related to the deterioration of the american dollar
[3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:21.720]  please notice my word i'm boring i'm doing it very carefully trying to
[3:03:21.720 --> 3:03:26.840]  so i get in it exactly like you said it watch the deterioration of the dollar
[3:03:26.840 --> 3:03:30.680]  and they will allow the opaque oil producing countries of the world
[3:03:30.680 --> 3:03:36.760]  to have $50 in purchasing power as related to the american dollar six
[3:03:36.760 --> 3:03:40.920]  months ago when he told me that they were going to keep it at $50 a barrel and
[3:03:40.920 --> 3:03:44.920]  then he said to me he said chaplain whether the world likes it or not
[3:03:44.920 --> 3:03:49.240]  gasoline is still priced in dollars now alex you will remember that they tried
[3:03:49.240 --> 3:03:54.440]  to put together a basket of currencies and to begin to trade oil in they were
[3:03:54.440 --> 3:03:58.760]  not successful in accomplishing it and this gentleman said to me he said
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:02.920]  chaplain whether they like it or not oil is still priced in dollars
[3:04:02.920 --> 3:04:06.600]  and he said we are going to give the opaque oil producing countries of the
[3:04:06.600 --> 3:04:10.840]  world the fact the purchasing power of $50
[3:04:10.840 --> 3:04:15.880]  now that means then if you see the price of crude oil goes to 70 or 80 dollars a
[3:04:15.880 --> 3:04:22.200]  barrel you know the progression of the deterioration of the american dollar
[3:04:22.200 --> 3:04:26.360]  in accordance with what the elite are doing at that particular course as gold
[3:04:26.360 --> 3:04:29.960]  as gold and oil go up you know they're killing the dollar
[3:04:29.960 --> 3:04:34.440]  yes you see go go up go didn't go up in price
[3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:37.800]  the thing that went down in value was the purchasing power of the dollar
[3:04:37.800 --> 3:04:42.360]  stay there stay there gotta break it down let's go into israel not hamas is
[3:04:42.360 --> 3:04:46.040]  responsible what does that mean afghanistan pakistan and yemen
[3:04:46.040 --> 3:04:49.880]  is a distraction everything he told you on the other side we're going to race

[3:08:16.040 --> 3:08:19.640]  information we're going over what this high
[3:08:19.640 --> 3:08:22.120]  level elitist told him the bloodluster planning
[3:08:22.120 --> 3:08:28.040]  in the next 12 months into early 2011 but starting now
[3:08:28.040 --> 3:08:32.840]  okay lindsay let's continue now did he say specifically
[3:08:32.840 --> 3:08:37.320]  what countries in the opaque nations were going to go down first he did not
[3:08:37.320 --> 3:08:41.080]  he merely said watch it uh... and you're going to see the same thing
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:44.920]  happen that you saw happen uh... was due by
[3:08:44.920 --> 3:08:48.280]  because they will not be able to meet their obligations
[3:08:48.280 --> 3:08:52.440]  merely because they are receiving less than what is necessary for them to
[3:08:52.440 --> 3:08:56.200]  take care of their infrastructure and as well as almost going bankrupt and you
[3:08:56.200 --> 3:08:59.000]  said two years ago they were going to uh...
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:01.720]  do this to really cause them problems continue
[3:09:01.720 --> 3:09:06.440]  well here i have to relate back to this alec prepare with me here for a second
[3:09:06.440 --> 3:09:09.640]  uh... you remember back about a year and a half ago when i was on your show and
[3:09:09.640 --> 3:09:12.920]  at the same time you had on that particular day a man who was going to
[3:09:12.920 --> 3:09:16.760]  give you a market report and i made the statement that price of crude oil was
[3:09:16.760 --> 3:09:19.240]  going down $50 a barrel he didn't say anything
[3:09:19.240 --> 3:09:22.520]  and then whenever i said that the price of uh...
[3:09:22.520 --> 3:09:25.960]  i mean that the the reason they were going to do this i've been told
[3:09:25.960 --> 3:09:29.480]  was to bankrupt the opaque oil produced in countries the world
[3:09:29.480 --> 3:09:32.280]  i guess he couldn't hold himself any longer
[3:09:32.280 --> 3:09:36.120]  and he's he's uh... stickered and chuckled over the air
[3:09:36.120 --> 3:09:40.840]  and said chaplain that can't be well it took place exactly as this man had told
[3:09:40.840 --> 3:09:44.440]  me it was going to be specific when it was fifty bucks a barrel he said we
[3:09:44.440 --> 3:09:47.640]  got a 150 the next year that happened then you said they're going to drive it
[3:09:47.640 --> 3:09:51.480]  down to fifty now that he told you to bankrupt the opaque nations and now
[3:09:51.480 --> 3:09:55.800]  that's happening yes it's happening exactly like he said now he said
[3:09:55.800 --> 3:09:59.720]  watch the price of gasoline at the gas pump and folks this is what you need to
[3:09:59.720 --> 3:10:02.600]  prepare for for the next 12 months time
[3:10:02.600 --> 3:10:06.680]  is because related to the depreciation of the american dollar
[3:10:06.680 --> 3:10:11.400]  which they already have it planned to withdraw the value of the american
[3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:15.560]  dollars purchasing power by 30 to 50 percent more like the 50 percent
[3:10:15.560 --> 3:10:19.720]  that means that the if the opaque or producing countries still receive only
[3:10:19.720 --> 3:10:23.800]  fifty dollars a barrel for their oil and purchasing power of the american dollar
[3:10:23.800 --> 3:10:26.760]  you are going to be paying at the gas pump
[3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:30.760]  more than likely 50 percent more than what you're paying right now
[3:10:30.760 --> 3:10:34.840]  within the 12 next 12 months time
[3:10:34.840 --> 3:10:39.560]  all right continuing what's going on with israel what do you tell you about war
[3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:43.880]  i was amazed i know i'm going to go into something even more startling than that
[3:10:43.880 --> 3:10:48.280]  first if i may alexand and you stop me if i say something that you you know
[3:10:48.280 --> 3:10:51.640]  might be a little bit too much i was amazed at this man
[3:10:51.640 --> 3:10:55.000]  he did and he knew it all the time he said israel
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:10:59.800]  sent them a side into other countries outside of israel
[3:10:59.800 --> 3:11:03.960]  uh... they had uh... they had forged passports
[3:11:03.960 --> 3:11:09.080]  uh... everything was secretive and they went after some leaders
[3:11:09.080 --> 3:11:12.680]  of hummus and as assassinated them
[3:11:12.680 --> 3:11:16.600]  and we know when this man was telling me this i was sitting here almost with my
[3:11:16.600 --> 3:11:19.880]  mouth open say wait a minute you i didn't ask him this
[3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:23.240]  i said you knew about this before it happened he did
[3:11:23.240 --> 3:11:27.240]  he knew every bit of this was going to happen but listen folks i say this for
[3:11:27.240 --> 3:11:29.960]  this reason i'm not going to this anymore because this could really get me
[3:11:29.960 --> 3:11:33.960]  in trouble but every single thing that you are
[3:11:33.960 --> 3:11:37.720]  hearing this individual talk about lindsay i understand that listen
[3:11:37.720 --> 3:11:41.320]  no go ahead and spill it all i mean i mean i mean tell us what did he say
[3:11:41.320 --> 3:11:44.760]  about the israeli hit squads that's in the news now what did he say
[3:11:44.760 --> 3:11:48.760]  you know israel did it and they did it with forged passports from
[3:11:48.760 --> 3:11:52.120]  the massage their secretive organization
[3:11:52.120 --> 3:11:56.200]  and they went in and got their mosque person i mean you can't can we not even
[3:11:56.200 --> 3:12:00.600]  get uh... a man in afghanistan the america is
[3:12:00.600 --> 3:12:03.880]  because we are we can't even take care of
[3:12:03.880 --> 3:12:07.480]  well specifically though i mean why was he telling you this was just a side
[3:12:07.480 --> 3:12:10.760]  issue you just kind of a side issue is if to say
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:13.640]  hey i knew about it all the time okay well go to the rest of your notes go
[3:12:13.640 --> 3:12:15.240]  through the rest of your notes i mean what else
[3:12:15.240 --> 3:12:19.080]  what else do you say we should know okay uh... let's go into afghanistan
[3:12:19.080 --> 3:12:22.520]  pakistan and yaman because this is very important
[3:12:22.520 --> 3:12:26.120]  uh... afghanistan pakistan yaman i said what should we
[3:12:26.120 --> 3:12:29.080]  what should we look at there what should we consider
[3:12:29.080 --> 3:12:32.840]  and these are his exact words he said it's nothing but save a rally
[3:12:32.840 --> 3:12:36.440]  he said don't pay any attention to it then we went into
[3:12:36.440 --> 3:12:40.520]  why this is even out there right now folks please understand
[3:12:40.520 --> 3:12:45.320]  afghanistan produces eighty seven percent of the world's opium crop
[3:12:45.320 --> 3:12:50.120]  uh... in any given year that means that uh... more than ninety percent of the
[3:12:50.120 --> 3:12:53.000]  heroine in great britain and the world
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:56.920]  comes from afghanistan and a bank banks in the world
[3:12:56.920 --> 3:13:00.680]  world banks now not just american banks banks all over the world
[3:13:00.680 --> 3:13:06.360]  uh... in transfer of funds from the opium trade alone in any given day
[3:13:06.360 --> 3:13:10.680]  transfer more money than any other one product on the face of this earth
[3:13:10.680 --> 3:13:14.280]  and that means that they're making literally billions of dollars
[3:13:14.280 --> 3:13:18.840]  also opium trade transfer of funds and really
[3:13:18.840 --> 3:13:21.800]  when we went into afghanistan we didn't do anything in the world but going
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:24.440]  down to the project protect the bankers interest
[3:13:24.440 --> 3:13:28.120]  and then one of the biggest pipelines in the world goes across afghanistan
[3:13:28.120 --> 3:13:31.960]  now do you wonder why we are not going to say what did he say it's okay so he
[3:13:31.960 --> 3:13:33.640]  was telling you this way they take
[3:13:33.640 --> 3:13:37.640]  what lindsay williams what did he say this was a distraction from
[3:13:37.640 --> 3:13:41.880]  he said this is a distraction from some major issues whatever they wanted to
[3:13:41.880 --> 3:13:45.400]  be at that particular time he didn't mention the distraction
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:48.520]  but it definitely distracts you say anything about iran
[3:13:48.520 --> 3:13:52.760]  did he say anything about iran or positively i mean he was
[3:13:52.760 --> 3:13:57.080]  he's very firm about all our ran he said there is not going to be
[3:13:57.080 --> 3:14:00.840]  any war with iran right now he said chaplain
[3:14:00.840 --> 3:14:04.680]  don't be concerned about it sleep well at night those are my words those are not
[3:14:04.680 --> 3:14:08.520]  his but you don't have to be worried about it it'll be a year to a year and a
[3:14:08.520 --> 3:14:12.680]  half before there is war with iran and folks you've got to remember
[3:14:12.680 --> 3:14:16.040]  wait a minute he said they are they will hold on he said they are gonna attack
[3:14:16.040 --> 3:14:19.960]  in a year and a half he said there will be more in the middle east
[3:14:19.960 --> 3:14:23.000]  somewhere a little after a year and a half from now but he said we don't want
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:26.840]  war with iran right now and he said the only way that war with iran right now
[3:14:26.840 --> 3:14:31.160]  is going to take place if it is if his rule starts
[3:14:31.160 --> 3:14:35.560]  he was very firm about this so that would be right before a year and a half
[3:14:35.560 --> 3:14:38.840]  would be going into the election they may start a war then
[3:14:38.840 --> 3:14:44.120]  or very well could take place in fact he he said positively war is planned
[3:14:44.120 --> 3:14:46.840]  i mean there's no question but then okay drawing board
[3:14:46.840 --> 3:14:50.760]  lindsay millions of people are listening tell us what else
[3:14:50.760 --> 3:14:54.360]  on your notes he said is going to happen in the next year
[3:14:54.360 --> 3:14:57.720]  well he said first of all there's going to be some major upsets in the elections
[3:14:57.720 --> 3:15:00.680]  of course that's nothing new uh you all knew that
[3:15:00.680 --> 3:15:05.160]  i've got to go to dubai and dubai world he spent a lengthy period of time in the
[3:15:05.160 --> 3:15:10.040]  course of our conversation on the derivatives and oh my goodness very
[3:15:10.040 --> 3:15:13.480]  few people even know what a derivative is i know you've coveted on your program
[3:15:13.480 --> 3:15:17.320]  but the average american even some businessmen don't he said chaplain
[3:15:17.320 --> 3:15:22.360]  distinguish between dubai city and dubai world because he had told me back a
[3:15:22.360 --> 3:15:25.400]  year and a half ago that dubai city was going to become a ghost town
[3:15:25.400 --> 3:15:29.560]  in fact alex i appeared on your show and made the statement
[3:15:29.560 --> 3:15:34.120]  that dubai city would become a ghost town and that there would be some
[3:15:34.120 --> 3:15:38.360]  major problems over there financially i was laughed at people thought i was
[3:15:38.360 --> 3:15:41.480]  crazy they said you shouldn't say things like this now
[3:15:41.480 --> 3:15:45.240]  he comes along and says chaplain distinguish between dubai city
[3:15:45.240 --> 3:15:49.240]  and dubai world now many of you will remember back about four five years ago
[3:15:49.240 --> 3:15:55.320]  during the bush administration dubai world not dubai city but dubai world
[3:15:55.320 --> 3:15:59.000]  tried to take over the management of all of our port facilities in america so
[3:15:59.000 --> 3:16:02.920]  yeah all of the party of them said congress you can't do it well he said
[3:16:02.920 --> 3:16:09.560]  chaplain dubai world is the greatest promoter and creator of derivatives
[3:16:09.560 --> 3:16:14.120]  in the world today and he said because of dubai world's default on 80 billion
[3:16:14.120 --> 3:16:18.040]  dollars back over the Thanksgiving holidays he said it has
[3:16:18.040 --> 3:16:21.960]  jeopardized the entire world's banking system and the average person has not
[3:16:21.960 --> 3:16:25.320]  the slightest idea how close to default
[3:16:25.320 --> 3:16:28.680]  the whole world's banking system is because of dubai world
[3:16:28.680 --> 3:16:33.800]  whose tentacles literally reach into every nation on the face of this earth
[3:16:33.800 --> 3:16:38.200]  with all of their their financial involvement
[3:16:38.200 --> 3:16:43.080]  he said watch dubai world and he said you're going to see some major things
[3:16:43.080 --> 3:16:47.400]  then this one he went into the fact that you're going to see some other
[3:16:47.400 --> 3:16:51.160]  opaque or producing countries now that includes more than just the middle east
[3:16:51.160 --> 3:16:55.480]  that includes is not jerry that includes mexico that includes all i mean this
[3:16:55.480 --> 3:16:59.480]  brings up a whole different world and all these countries that are all
[3:16:59.480 --> 3:17:02.120]  producing that are a part of the opaque arm
[3:17:02.120 --> 3:17:05.320]  he said you're going to see one after the other have financial problems do the
[3:17:05.320 --> 3:17:09.480]  same thing that dubai world did alex and let me add this this is a
[3:17:09.480 --> 3:17:14.200]  prisonplanet.com headline right now and it quotes
[3:17:14.200 --> 3:17:19.320]  mainstream news articles uh prominent investor pound could collapse
[3:17:19.320 --> 3:17:22.120]  within weeks british currency is on the brink
[3:17:22.120 --> 3:17:25.880]  according to billionaire financier jim rogers
[3:17:25.880 --> 3:17:28.680]  and we know it's even coming out in the european parliament
[3:17:28.680 --> 3:17:32.200]  that goldman sacks jp morgan chase and others are engineering this
[3:17:32.200 --> 3:17:36.360]  total global meltdown they robbed us so they'd be flush in cash
[3:17:36.360 --> 3:17:40.520]  a year and a half ago with the banker bailout now they're moving into phase two
[3:17:40.520 --> 3:17:46.040]  did he talk about any about the bankers and where we go after a year
[3:17:46.040 --> 3:17:50.200]  he only talked about the fact that the b if you see everything really revolves
[3:17:50.200 --> 3:17:53.000]  around crude oil it's a standard currency of the world
[3:17:53.000 --> 3:17:57.160]  and whatever crude oil prices go to and stay about what they're doing right now
[3:17:57.160 --> 3:18:00.920]  between seven eighty dollars which is fifty dollars worth of purchasing power
[3:18:00.920 --> 3:18:04.680]  but yet it takes all the arabia eighty dollars in purchasing power of the
[3:18:04.680 --> 3:18:07.880]  american dollar to even be able to maintain their infrastructure
[3:18:07.880 --> 3:18:11.640]  what he's basically saying is this whole thing is going to
[3:18:11.640 --> 3:18:19.080]  collapse like a dominoes and he said you just be ready for the
[3:18:19.080 --> 3:18:27.000]  fact that one after the other are going to bite the dust as do my world is
[3:18:27.000 --> 3:18:29.960]  so basically everything that you've been saying
[3:18:29.960 --> 3:18:34.040]  on your program is exactly what's taking place now
[3:18:34.040 --> 3:18:37.640]  let me go into the next item uh he went into healthcare
[3:18:37.640 --> 3:18:41.240]  and i think it's probably because of the fact that he's 87 years of age that he
[3:18:41.240 --> 3:18:44.200]  did this but i'll just make his statement i wish he had
[3:18:44.200 --> 3:18:49.560]  elaborated more he said the health care bill is not a health
[3:18:49.560 --> 3:18:52.840]  care bill i mean i was amazed i'm still sitting here
[3:18:52.840 --> 3:18:56.680]  done founded he said the health care bill is total
[3:18:56.680 --> 3:19:00.440]  government takeover and i said what do you mean
[3:19:00.440 --> 3:19:05.240]  he said we define print and i said uh what do you mean
[3:19:05.240 --> 3:19:10.360]  and he said healthcare bill basically in the nutshell is gun confiscation is
[3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:15.320]  euthanasia uh is electronic chip control i mean there's
[3:19:15.320 --> 3:19:20.040]  so much involved in this health care bill i i'm so glad that people are rising
[3:19:20.040 --> 3:19:24.360]  up and saying we aren't going to go along with this alex

[3:19:52.920 --> 3:19:55.960]  public they'll have the collapse and use it to take over
[3:19:55.960 --> 3:19:59.240]  instead of the collapse being used to bring them to justice and get our

[3:24:24.120 --> 3:24:29.320]  talked to this former oil company ceo um we know the info has turned out to be
[3:24:29.320 --> 3:24:32.360]  very accurate in the past i wish it wasn't accurate
[3:24:32.360 --> 3:24:35.560]  hopefully to get the word out uh the word out about what these people are
[3:24:35.560 --> 3:24:38.760]  doing we can stop this but i don't know
[3:24:38.760 --> 3:24:42.200]  let's go ahead and talk to jim in new york you're on the air with pastor
[3:24:42.200 --> 3:24:45.240]  lindsay williams yes hi alex uh this is uh
[3:24:45.240 --> 3:24:51.480]  pester williams uh jim hi how are you i i don't want to be controversial but i
[3:24:51.480 --> 3:24:54.920]  have a problem with something that you said at the beginning of the show
[3:24:54.920 --> 3:24:59.720]  alex said he asked you about uh had you talked about what anybody else about
[3:24:59.720 --> 3:25:03.000]  the situation and it's just not true that you didn't
[3:25:03.000 --> 3:25:06.600]  because i heard you on dr stan over a month ago
[3:25:06.600 --> 3:25:09.800]  no no that was a separate interview this is a no
[3:25:09.800 --> 3:25:13.880]  exactly what he's saying today no no he called me you're not listening
[3:25:13.880 --> 3:25:18.600]  he called me a month ago and said he talked to him again
[3:25:18.600 --> 3:25:22.360]  and it was some similar info but he talked to him again yesterday lindsay
[3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:25.080]  you want to comment to this that's exactly right and the
[3:25:25.080 --> 3:25:29.240]  information that i received on yesterday i am backing up some of it with
[3:25:29.240 --> 3:25:32.760]  the things that he said a month ago because in order to stand understand
[3:25:32.760 --> 3:25:36.920]  the things he said yesterday i have to know what he said yeah jim we went back
[3:25:36.920 --> 3:25:41.160]  to two years ago and into a year ago too and i'm sorry if that got confusing
[3:25:41.160 --> 3:25:43.320]  but no i know lindsay called me a month ago and
[3:25:43.320 --> 3:25:46.440]  i meant to get him on it just fell through the cracks but no he called us
[3:25:46.440 --> 3:25:49.000]  yesterday and talked to him again i mean look
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:53.000]  dr monteef has talked to this guy lindsay before all this happened years ago
[3:25:53.000 --> 3:25:56.680]  wrote books about it this guy's name is in there we're not just saying who is
[3:25:56.680 --> 3:26:00.120]  it look jim here's my question
[3:26:00.120 --> 3:26:03.960]  did oil go up to 150 like lindsay said he said it would that sounded crazy it
[3:26:03.960 --> 3:26:06.280]  happened did it go back down like he said
[3:26:06.280 --> 3:26:10.040]  now the guy was wrong about saying the elite wouldn't let obama in
[3:26:10.040 --> 3:26:14.360]  and lindsay's talked about that but i anything else jim
[3:26:14.360 --> 3:26:18.440]  no alex okay i appreciate that you know maybe i miss
[3:26:18.440 --> 3:26:23.160]  i understand this but it basically what he's saying today is what he said
[3:26:23.160 --> 3:26:27.080]  on monteef a month ago anybody go to radio liberty and listen to it see the
[3:26:27.080 --> 3:26:30.440]  date it's not it's not a problem look at this real
[3:26:30.440 --> 3:26:35.240]  a mosque massage all of these things i knew that he had never mentioned to me
[3:26:35.240 --> 3:26:38.040]  before no i understand i look look lindsay already know
[3:26:38.040 --> 3:26:41.000]  you're telling the truth so that's fine people sometimes get confused but i
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:43.480]  hear what jim's saying as well because we're mixing
[3:26:43.480 --> 3:26:48.120]  the last two years all together here uh let's go ahead now and talk to ryan
[3:26:48.120 --> 3:26:52.600]  in arizona ryan you're on the air hello how you doing Alex
[3:26:52.600 --> 3:26:58.920]  good good um i want to thank uh lindsay williams
[3:26:58.920 --> 3:27:01.640]  because so many information that he had mentioned you know a couple years ago
[3:27:01.640 --> 3:27:05.240]  about the way we're going up i had talked to
[3:27:05.240 --> 3:27:08.440]  some of my friends and family members and you know mentioned
[3:27:08.440 --> 3:27:12.440]  that i had heard that and uh you know they didn't believe it of course until
[3:27:12.440 --> 3:27:15.320]  it actually happened a couple years ago and then uh
[3:27:15.320 --> 3:27:19.720]  had opened their eyes and uh let them see that there are things behind the
[3:27:19.720 --> 3:27:24.120]  scenes that are going on that a lot of us have no idea about and we don't
[3:27:24.120 --> 3:27:28.680]  get to see it on the news and most of us don't have uh insider friends that can
[3:27:28.680 --> 3:27:32.440]  give us that kind of information so i just wanted to thank lindsay for
[3:27:32.440 --> 3:27:35.800]  kind of getting the word out about some stuff like that
[3:27:35.800 --> 3:27:39.880]  thank you so much and by the way please believe all the other things that
[3:27:39.880 --> 3:27:43.800]  alex is saying on his show day by day because every good of this dovetails
[3:27:43.800 --> 3:27:47.240]  together in understanding the total program of the elite
[3:27:47.240 --> 3:27:50.920]  so look i want to be clear on this well i appreciate that rhyme we're going to
[3:27:50.920 --> 3:27:53.800]  talk to malcom and others here in a moment but but going back to jim and i
[3:27:53.800 --> 3:27:57.080]  think jim's a nice guy i'm not saying you know he's wrong or even bad
[3:27:57.080 --> 3:28:01.320]  it's just that lindsay everything he wrote in his energy non crisis 20
[3:28:01.320 --> 3:28:04.680]  something years ago has now come out in congress been proven accurate
[3:28:04.680 --> 3:28:08.360]  where he said the oil was that in massive amounts has come out to be accurate
[3:28:08.360 --> 3:28:11.960]  i've known lindsay been interviewing lindsay for 13 years
[3:28:11.960 --> 3:28:15.640]  i remember interviewing him when i was on one radio station might have been 14
[3:28:15.640 --> 3:28:19.880]  years ago and lindsay alex i mean lindsay's told the truth
[3:28:19.880 --> 3:28:23.960]  and yeah he's mixing all the different interviews he's or talks he's done
[3:28:23.960 --> 3:28:27.240]  together uh and he's talked about a lot of new stuff
[3:28:27.240 --> 3:28:31.560]  here dealing with israel and the rest of it and he he is talking to this guy and
[3:28:31.560 --> 3:28:35.240]  and dr monteef's called the guy up and talked to him himself
[3:28:35.240 --> 3:28:40.520]  and and so i mean regardless we know this stuff is coming true and
[3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:43.240]  happening and we could see what lindsay's talking about
[3:28:43.240 --> 3:28:46.360]  in the headlines of the news right now
[3:28:46.360 --> 3:28:50.120]  and builder bar group sources are confirming the same thing

[3:35:18.920 --> 3:35:22.600]  gold and possible confiscation or anything like that
[3:35:22.600 --> 3:35:26.120]  he has talked about gold at length and one of the things he said was
[3:35:26.120 --> 3:35:29.000]  it's the currency of the elite and he said therefore
[3:35:29.000 --> 3:35:33.000]  it's not going to be bothered now you can take that at face value i think in
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:36.600]  the fact that there's not going to be any confiscation of gold and silver
[3:35:36.600 --> 3:35:39.480]  because they aren't going to touch the one thing that they trust
[3:35:39.480 --> 3:35:42.840]  and he made it very plain he said i'm going to use exact words and
[3:35:42.840 --> 3:35:47.800]  Alex and i'll call in please understand that the only way that i can
[3:35:47.800 --> 3:35:51.640]  understand the elite is sometimes to go back to things that these people have
[3:35:51.640 --> 3:35:54.760]  said in the past so you are in the listening audience
[3:35:54.760 --> 3:35:58.280]  don't get upset just merely because i relate to something that this person
[3:35:58.280 --> 3:36:01.240]  said in the past you've got to put all this together as one big
[3:36:01.240 --> 3:36:05.160]  kick-saw puzzle sure sure picture absolutely uh...
[3:36:05.160 --> 3:36:10.120]  he said don't trust any financial instrument that is written on paper
[3:36:10.120 --> 3:36:14.040]  whether it be a cable or federal reserve nor the retirement account of bond
[3:36:14.040 --> 3:36:17.640]  even a bond issued by the trade the derivatives have
[3:36:17.640 --> 3:36:20.680]  the derivatives of disease at all thank you malcolm

[3:37:04.360 --> 3:37:08.120]  download a downgraded version of it because he just wants the information

[3:37:22.440 --> 3:37:27.800]  the 150 dollar barrel oil he believed you he went and
[3:37:27.800 --> 3:37:31.560]  bet on it in the markets and told me it was just a ton of money he made
[3:37:31.560 --> 3:37:34.920]  so he wanted to thank you daryl run this wanted me to thank you for that
[3:37:34.920 --> 3:37:37.640]  so he believed in you enough to bet on what you were doing
[3:37:37.640 --> 3:37:40.920]  i don't know if this elitist you're talking to could ever be wrong
[3:37:40.920 --> 3:37:43.880]  or if the elite could change what they're doing but i know you talk to him i
[3:37:43.880 --> 3:37:45.880]  know this is what they believe is going on

[3:38:13.720 --> 3:38:16.840]  the congress ability to only say no for so long
[3:38:16.840 --> 3:38:21.080]  uh within this week um pretty critical information i've been seeing the media
[3:38:21.080 --> 3:38:25.320]  we got the 85 billion dollar bipartisan draft bill now that you know what's
[3:38:25.320 --> 3:38:27.720]  called 154 bill that was called back in
[3:38:27.720 --> 3:38:31.240]  december and then with the whole body scanners
[3:38:31.240 --> 3:38:35.080]  uh stalling in the house representatives and now they want now they
[3:38:35.080 --> 3:38:38.200]  want to censor the internet and we can clearly see
[3:38:38.200 --> 3:38:40.920]  them gearing up for police state is that what you're saying
[3:38:40.920 --> 3:38:44.440]  yeah absolutely and i i kind of wanted to get a lindsay's comments on that
[3:38:44.440 --> 3:38:47.960]  yeah clearly worldwide they're setting up a police state
[3:38:47.960 --> 3:38:51.080]  knowing people are going to get angry as things implode
[3:38:51.080 --> 3:38:55.560]  uh lindsay yeah this gentleman has let me know and in no uncertain terms all of
[3:38:55.560 --> 3:39:00.360]  the details that surround all of this but for him to actually
[3:39:00.360 --> 3:39:03.960]  answer a question about the police state he's never been willing to
[3:39:03.960 --> 3:39:07.960]  but he's given me everything all the way around it in fact when he talked about
[3:39:07.960 --> 3:39:11.240]  the health care bill he was talking about the uh
[3:39:11.240 --> 3:39:14.440]  the chip that they can put into a hypodermic needle
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:17.960]  by way of the vaccination they're going to going to give you and you said
[3:39:17.960 --> 3:39:21.480]  everybody this is in the health care bill
[3:39:21.480 --> 3:39:24.760]  that is actually in there they talk about implantable chips in the bill
[3:39:24.760 --> 3:39:27.720]  let's talk to mike in north carolina any questions for lindsay
[3:39:27.720 --> 3:39:31.960]  williams hey alex uh i just want to know about
[3:39:31.960 --> 3:39:36.520]  the build-up in yemen and i want to know uh if he's heard anything about these
[3:39:36.520 --> 3:39:39.720]  rumors of the spar gate down there anything like that
[3:39:39.720 --> 3:39:43.000]  ha ha yeah i would imagine he hadn't heard anything about that but i
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:46.200]  appreciate your call uh he was saying earlier that the whole
[3:39:46.200 --> 3:39:50.440]  yemen thing is a distraction really to me it's a civil war down there
[3:39:50.440 --> 3:39:54.040]  and the us and saudi is are in there trying to take control of the situation
[3:39:54.040 --> 3:39:59.160]  also to control uh the port of aiden and the us and israel talking about taking
[3:39:59.160 --> 3:40:02.600]  over the oil filled areas in southern iran that they would control
[3:40:02.600 --> 3:40:05.320]  about a third of the oil on the planet lindsay
[3:40:05.320 --> 3:40:08.120]  yes now the the uh straight up our moves
[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:12.360]  and most of you recognize one super tanker down in the straight up our moves
[3:40:12.360 --> 3:40:15.400]  would cut off 40 percent of the world's oil
[3:40:15.400 --> 3:40:19.800]  and you would see the price of gasoline gas pump go to 10 to 12 dollars
[3:40:19.800 --> 3:40:24.440]  uh ballot overnight and our military be drastically hindered
[3:40:24.440 --> 3:40:27.400]  so alex i think you've covered it quite well
[3:40:27.400 --> 3:40:30.840]  alan texas you're on the air with lindsay williams go ahead
[3:40:30.840 --> 3:40:34.360]  yeah how you doing mr williams uh i had the pleasure of listening to you on
[3:40:34.360 --> 3:40:37.080]  matrix news network when i lived in aurora illinois
[3:40:37.080 --> 3:40:41.720]  uh i do live in uh comro texas now and uh you had touched on the health care
[3:40:41.720 --> 3:40:45.000]  bill earlier and it's interesting that the caller uh a few
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:49.320]  callers behind me or in front of me had mentioned the uh rfid chip implanted by
[3:40:49.320 --> 3:40:53.480]  needle i in fact uh was in larry get state jail
[3:40:53.480 --> 3:40:59.400]  in um london texas and interestingly enough uh you were forced to have
[3:40:59.400 --> 3:41:02.920]  vaccinations and have blood drawn three vials
[3:41:02.920 --> 3:41:07.160]  i uh by the way we're getting reports everywhere of people in jail for
[3:41:07.160 --> 3:41:11.000]  unpaid tickets are having blood taken being injected they're taking blood
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  from babies at birth illegally i mean this is insane
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:19.960]  yes sir and uh it's it's very very odd uh that now a stud finder picks up
[3:41:19.960 --> 3:41:23.240]  something in my left arm where they did pick up the blood where they did
[3:41:23.240 --> 3:41:26.600]  take the blood and uh interesting uh mr jones i have just
[3:41:26.600 --> 3:41:28.760]  become a listener to your show in the past week
[3:41:28.760 --> 3:41:33.080]  i placed in order to your store and uh just in the past few minutes in fact
[3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:37.080]  in and this is no lie a military helicopter did fly above my house in
[3:41:37.080 --> 3:41:41.080]  comro and there is the same white suburban that has been driving by my
[3:41:41.080 --> 3:41:45.080]  house five times in the past ten minutes well i appreciate your call albert
[3:41:45.080 --> 3:41:48.440]  you wouldn't order it then they come fly a helicopter over there's military
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:51.400]  helicopters flying around everywhere and they do have systems that can look
[3:41:51.400 --> 3:41:53.640]  right through your walls that's been in the news but
[3:41:53.640 --> 3:41:57.640]  i mean i think it's completely giving into paranoia is is not the way to go
[3:41:57.640 --> 3:42:01.800]  i've got a lot of folks home from work today let's go ahead and talk to nick
[3:42:01.800 --> 3:42:04.840]  in colorado nick you're on the year
[3:42:04.840 --> 3:42:11.240]  hey i just had a question for you and uh mr williams about the rand war now you
[3:42:11.240 --> 3:42:14.520]  predicted about three to six months maybe something like that's happening
[3:42:14.520 --> 3:42:18.520]  but lindsay williams saying it was going to be about a year
[3:42:18.520 --> 3:42:22.680]  well and lindsay's saying a year and a half then maybe they may do it
[3:42:22.680 --> 3:42:26.520]  tarply thinks it's on the front burner again israel's talking about it
[3:42:26.520 --> 3:42:30.040]  it's clearly being debated right now i don't think the establishment knows
[3:42:30.040 --> 3:42:32.440]  what they're going to do at this time yet lindsay
[3:42:32.440 --> 3:42:36.280]  yes a year and a half ago you remember that that we had our warships sitting
[3:42:36.280 --> 3:42:39.480]  over there in the state of in the gulf persian gulf
[3:42:39.480 --> 3:42:43.640]  we had everything ready marines air force army everybody was ready
[3:42:43.640 --> 3:42:47.400]  i was even saying on radio talk shows we're going to have a confrontation with
[3:42:47.400 --> 3:42:50.520]  iran this gentleman told me on the phone you will
[3:42:50.520 --> 3:42:54.680]  not have a confrontation it with iran in the next two years
[3:42:54.680 --> 3:42:58.360]  i came back on radio shows all over the country said that i was laughed at
[3:42:58.360 --> 3:43:01.880]  it's gone by for a year and a half we still haven't had one the gentleman now
[3:43:01.880 --> 3:43:05.000]  is saying me that the elite have it planned a year and a half from now
[3:43:05.000 --> 3:43:09.160]  that's all i can go on and they've been like for 35 years so
[3:43:09.160 --> 3:43:13.160]  i'm hoping i can sleep better at night based on the fact of what he said
[3:43:13.160 --> 3:43:16.600]  all right nick thank you joe in north carolina next question for lindsay
[3:43:16.600 --> 3:43:20.760]  welliams hey alex is joe in north carolina man
[3:43:20.760 --> 3:43:24.680]  good to talk to you good to talk to you hey uh quick question
[3:43:24.680 --> 3:43:27.800]  i've been listening to you guys for about a year
[3:43:27.800 --> 3:43:31.240]  and uh if there were maybe two points that you could make
[3:43:31.240 --> 3:43:36.280]  to kind of wake me up just a little bit more what would you say
[3:43:36.280 --> 3:43:39.960]  well if it too much would wake you up i would say number one would be the fact
[3:43:39.960 --> 3:43:43.400]  that he said there's not going to be any shortage of all the gorse restore ships
[3:43:43.400 --> 3:43:46.440]  but yet you will probably go hungry because you won't have the money to buy
[3:43:46.440 --> 3:43:51.240]  it they will devalue the dollar by 30 to 50 percent the next 12 months
[3:43:51.240 --> 3:43:54.760]  then his comparison with crude oil and the one on
[3:43:54.760 --> 3:43:59.400]  dubeye world please those probably the most important things right now
[3:43:59.400 --> 3:44:03.000]  all right phil thank you let's talk to michael in mississippi you're on the
[3:44:03.000 --> 3:44:05.720]  air go ahead
[3:44:06.200 --> 3:44:11.240]  hey alex hey pastor green hi mark i had a question yes sir um
[3:44:11.240 --> 3:44:15.080]  the last time you got this is but this last time pastor but the time before
[3:44:15.080 --> 3:44:19.720]  that you would talk to this gentleman uh you had mentioned in what it was
[3:44:19.720 --> 3:44:23.560]  maybe online on one of the talk shows or maybe on your dvd but you mentioned
[3:44:23.560 --> 3:44:28.040]  specifically something about a connection between uh specifically
[3:44:28.040 --> 3:44:34.040]  2012 uh the mind calendar and the elite and i got the videos and i listened
[3:44:34.040 --> 3:44:37.960]  and i never heard anything about that specifically could you could you
[3:44:37.960 --> 3:44:41.640]  tell me about that you probably have the wrong set of videos
[3:44:41.640 --> 3:44:45.960]  because i've received so much material from this man within the past six months
[3:44:45.960 --> 3:44:50.200]  we have done two different sets of videos there are three videos in each one
[3:44:50.200 --> 3:44:53.640]  the latest set probably is the one that i went into that basically what he said
[3:44:53.640 --> 3:44:56.520]  to me was he said the dollar will be dead these are his
[3:44:56.520 --> 3:44:59.480]  exact words the dollar will be dead by 2012
[3:44:59.480 --> 3:45:04.440]  i said that is the state the same date that the mayan calendar
[3:45:04.440 --> 3:45:07.960]  has some things that will probably be happening and we went into that more
[3:45:07.960 --> 3:45:12.200]  in our latest dvd set which we'll talk about a little bit later yes michael
[3:45:12.200 --> 3:45:16.840]  thank you phil in jersey you're on the air go ahead
[3:45:16.840 --> 3:45:21.640]  yes how you doing i want to know if there was any uh achilles heel that he
[3:45:21.640 --> 3:45:25.560]  indicated that these people have that might be a way that we could organize
[3:45:25.560 --> 3:45:28.680]  and and take them down before they take us down
[3:45:28.680 --> 3:45:33.080]  you sure can i am so glad you asked that
[3:45:33.080 --> 3:45:36.920]  oh my goodness thank you so much when i lived with the elite i found there's
[3:45:36.920 --> 3:45:40.600]  only one thing that scares him to death that's the masses of people waking up
[3:45:40.600 --> 3:45:43.720]  and learning the truth and that's what alex jones is all about
[3:45:43.720 --> 3:45:48.440]  he tells him he tells it straight and they are scared to death of you waking
[3:45:48.440 --> 3:45:52.520]  up as a result i mentioned i think when i was on alex jones show last
[3:45:52.520 --> 3:45:56.520]  that they have extended their timeline because you gave them two and a half
[3:45:56.520 --> 3:46:00.120]  trillion dollars back in the last two months of the bush administration
[3:46:00.120 --> 3:46:04.280]  and they do not want you to wake up they're scared to death in fact that's
[3:46:04.280 --> 3:46:08.040]  the reason that they all i asked him this oh thank you for bringing this up
[3:46:08.040 --> 3:46:12.600]  i asked him i said why are you going to diminish the dollar by 50% this year
[3:46:12.600 --> 3:46:16.600]  he doesn't want you to wake up he wants you to keep on like frog boiling in the
[3:46:16.600 --> 3:46:20.280]  pot and instead of the completely collapsing the dollar
[3:46:20.280 --> 3:46:23.480]  overnight they are not going to do that by the way this is a prediction
[3:46:23.480 --> 3:46:27.800]  they are not going to call that's what the g20 has said 30 50 percent in
[3:46:27.800 --> 3:46:30.840]  2012 the g20 has said publicly coordinated
[3:46:30.840 --> 3:46:35.240]  devaluation yes incremental all right thank you
[3:46:35.240 --> 3:46:41.080]  thank you uh phil good question richie in georgia richie you're on the year
[3:46:41.080 --> 3:46:46.120]  alex hey guys how you doing god bless you i just want to appreciate uh say we
[3:46:46.120 --> 3:46:50.360]  appreciate everything that you've been teaching us waking us up and uh
[3:46:50.360 --> 3:46:53.880]  just real quick i i know that the news is happening
[3:46:53.880 --> 3:46:58.520]  there's so much ammunition in their gun that they're shooting at us right now
[3:46:58.520 --> 3:47:02.440]  um i've been trying to get in the paper and and let them know about the
[3:47:02.440 --> 3:47:07.400]  possible assassination attempts and and uh paul craig roberts interview
[3:47:07.400 --> 3:47:10.760]  you know i've been relaying that to my local community here
[3:47:10.760 --> 3:47:17.080]  but uh really wanted to uh get the word out to the christians across the
[3:47:17.080 --> 3:47:21.800]  nation uh to form a
[3:47:21.800 --> 3:47:25.800]  something other than the tea party because the tea party's being infiltrated
[3:47:25.800 --> 3:47:29.720]  is there any way that we could possibly do an interview sometimes so that the
[3:47:29.720 --> 3:47:33.560]  people would you know i'd have some credibility to reach out to those people
[3:47:33.560 --> 3:47:37.880]  and us try to you know come up with a grassroots movement
[3:47:37.880 --> 3:47:42.520]  uh you know what are you aware do an interview where
[3:47:42.520 --> 3:47:45.160]  well i was wondering maybe we could do that sometime
[3:47:45.160 --> 3:47:51.000]  um to get the word out to follow what i mean what type of interview
[3:47:51.000 --> 3:47:55.960]  well that you you made it a point that the tea party is is being infiltrated and
[3:47:55.960 --> 3:48:00.040]  i think we need a truly independent movement and i think if we
[3:48:00.040 --> 3:48:04.360]  um did uh you know reach that reach out to all the christians
[3:48:04.360 --> 3:48:08.280]  in in the uh country at all the churches i feel like i can network with those

[3:55:16.120 --> 3:55:20.520]  that uh... you know that uh... since it cost the food was so high
[3:55:20.520 --> 3:55:25.160]  that they'll rent lord uh... what can we expect the price of renting to be
[3:55:25.160 --> 3:55:30.040]  because a lot of people have written that country yes thirty fifty percent decline
[3:55:30.040 --> 3:55:33.560]  in the purchasing power of the dollar within twelve months he said it
[3:55:33.560 --> 3:55:36.440]  positively will happen it's already planned
[3:55:36.440 --> 3:55:39.800]  they know how they're going to do it so that means then that you're renting
[3:55:39.800 --> 3:55:43.640]  prices are going to have to go up accordingly and also
[3:55:43.640 --> 3:55:47.720]  uh... max keiser talks about this this is a class of slumlord
[3:55:47.720 --> 3:55:51.320]  owners and i mean you know big expensive flats cheap homes whatever
[3:55:51.320 --> 3:55:54.520]  with everybody large portions getting turned out of their houses

[3:56:23.880 --> 3:56:28.600]  got a question uh... two-year-old lindsay was on the show he said he said
[3:56:28.600 --> 3:56:31.240]  that it was probably going to be two years
[3:56:31.240 --> 3:56:34.760]  so they started shutting down them uh... the alternative news
[3:56:34.760 --> 3:56:38.760]  and uh... or something you were saying they'd go after the media last but now
[3:56:38.760 --> 3:56:42.440]  obama and others are talking about they took krypton down yesterday
[3:56:42.440 --> 3:56:48.440]  just getting rid of websites uh... yes but i was told that the last thing that
[3:56:48.440 --> 3:56:51.560]  will be touched before maybe we are in the last phase
[3:56:51.560 --> 3:56:56.200]  i'm not quite sure uh... but yeah i i can only go by what the gentleman told me
[3:56:56.200 --> 3:56:59.560]  and he said that one of the last things that will be touched will be
[3:56:59.560 --> 3:57:04.360]  the media such as alex jones i thought but mainly was talking about neocontalk
[3:57:04.360 --> 3:57:06.920]  radio wasn't it because you know you said his quote was
[3:57:06.920 --> 3:57:10.840]  we like what we're doing with our media so we don't want to set the precedent
[3:57:10.840 --> 3:57:14.360]  yeah well they know good and well that if they touch you alex that they're going
[3:57:14.360 --> 3:57:17.720]  to have to touch the national media also and start censoring them
[3:57:17.720 --> 3:57:21.320]  well they don't want them to have censored so they don't let you along until
[3:57:21.320 --> 3:57:24.840]  the very last all right marjorie thank you for that

[3:57:39.160 --> 3:57:42.120]  give you some other type of indication how they're going to
[3:57:42.120 --> 3:57:46.200]  he did not mention stimulus packages and i didn't think to ask him and
[3:57:46.200 --> 3:57:49.320]  uh... alex if you ever have any questions or would ask this man just pass
[3:57:49.320 --> 3:57:53.160]  them on to me i will but he did say that they positively have a
[3:57:53.160 --> 3:57:56.120]  method of devouring with thirty to fifty percent
[3:57:56.120 --> 3:58:00.840]  within uh... i want you to ask him as soon as you can
