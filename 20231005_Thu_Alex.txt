[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.421]  InfoWars.
[00:00:17.421 --> 00:00:18.622]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:18.963]  Today.
[00:00:22.508 --> 00:00:40.297]  And you never stop, and you let these Nazi blood-sucking anti-American parasites that want to make you and your family slaves know that we are standing up against them, and we are red-blooded, and we are not slaves, and we are not bowing down to them.
[00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:41.497]  I'm not bowing down.
[00:00:41.497 --> 00:00:42.798]  I'm at the tip of the spear.
[00:00:42.798 --> 00:00:44.079]  I get death threats every day.
[00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.000]  And I, you know what?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.701]  I am honored to be who I am.
[00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:53.325]  I'm honored to just be an average person that stood up 15 years ago and said, I'm going to defend the Republic.
[00:00:53.325 --> 00:00:54.686]  I'm going to defend the family.
[00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:55.987]  I'm going to defend the Second Amendment.
[00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:57.848]  I'm going to fight against abortion.
[00:00:57.848 --> 00:01:00.249]  I'm going to see what happens when I really take action.
[00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.291]  And we have laid waste to the enemy.
[00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:08.455]  If you simply unloose yourselves and become the leaders you are, we will sweep this scum into the gutter.
[00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:10.436]  We will defeat the New World Order.
[00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.398]  We will crush the tyranny.
[00:01:12.398 --> 00:01:14.039]  Second Hour straight ahead.
[00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.599]  Stay with us.
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:31.803]  In my first book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, I gave you a full analysis of the global elite's international conspiracy to enslave humanity and all life on the planet.
[00:01:31.803 --> 00:01:37.624]  The Great Reset is a planned attempt to redistribute all the world's wealth and power into the hands of banks,
[00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:42.965]  Corporations, billionaires, and the World Economic Forum.
[00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:50.007]  The only way this corporate fascist conspiracy can succeed is if the people of the world are not aware of it.
[00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:54.308]  For years, we've been laying out their sinister blueprint on Infowars.
[00:01:54.308 --> 00:02:06.512]  What we are witnessing is nothing less than the failed plans of social Darwinists to capture free market capitalism and turn it toward their fascist aims of controlling and depopulating the globe.
[00:02:07.192 --> 00:02:21.652]  Because of the tremendous success of the first book, which received tens of thousands of orders before it was even released, we're releasing a second book, The Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:31.117]  The people the globalists fear the most are the members of their own systems of control who wake up and then decide to act against the machine.
[00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:35.960]  The globalists believe they've planned for every possible contingency.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.903]  They hadn't counted on the conscience and love of truth, which lives in the souls of good people.
[00:02:41.903 --> 00:02:46.986]  Order the Great Awakening now to support Infowars and defeat the globalists.
[00:02:49.844 --> 00:02:54.527]  The satanic New World Order is betting against humanity.
[00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:55.728]  They're betting on our weakness.
[00:02:55.728 --> 00:03:02.712]  They believe they can destabilize civilization and bring us down to the ashes of history.
[00:03:02.712 --> 00:03:07.655]  But the trap they've laid for us will be their destruction, not ours.
[00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:17.862]  If we trust in God, and if we are valiant and have courage to speak the truth, and not comply and engage in civil disobedience, and not join the masses,
[00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:21.284]  We have decided that they are the scum of the earth.
[00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:26.468]  We have decided that they will join with this soulless corporate system.
[00:03:26.468 --> 00:03:35.195]  As for InfoWars, we are going to steadfastly continue to fight in the information war with our weapon, the truth, against the enemies of humanity.
[00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:41.640]  And we put our faith, and we put our trust, and we put our destiny in the hands of God.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.304]  Because it's been said a trillion times, if God be with us, who can be against us?
[00:03:49.252 --> 00:03:53.395]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[00:03:53.395 --> 00:03:56.457]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.703]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.245]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:04:07.245 --> 00:04:12.910]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:20.196]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:21.537]  We will not give up!
[00:04:21.537 --> 00:04:22.918]  We will not give up!
[00:04:24.884 --> 00:04:31.047]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[00:04:31.047 --> 00:04:36.850]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.993]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[00:04:40.993 --> 00:04:45.935]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:50.618]  From the front lines of the Infowar, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.775 --> 00:05:05.036]  Last year we put this book out.
[00:05:05.036 --> 00:05:06.456]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:05:06.456 --> 00:05:08.817]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[00:05:08.817 --> 00:05:12.599]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.862]  The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:05:17.862 --> 00:05:19.903]  This is such a powerful book.
[00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.684]  It covers all the globalist plans, the
[00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:22.584]  I think so.
[00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:49.153]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[00:05:49.153 --> 00:05:55.741]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to InfoWarsTore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:57.243]  This is going to go to number one.
[00:05:57.243 --> 00:05:58.465]  I want to thank you for your support.
[00:05:58.465 --> 00:05:59.506]  It's a powerful book.
[00:05:59.506 --> 00:06:00.027]  Get yours now.
[00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:18.577]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:47.265]  Professor Dr. Robert Epstein, who is hands down the leading expert, statistician, mathematician, computer expert on election fraud, the top advisor to the Republican Congress.
[00:06:47.265 --> 00:06:48.925]  He's not even a Republican.
[00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:51.106]  He'll be joining us for two hours today.
[00:06:51.106 --> 00:06:53.007]  I'd requested him come on for an hour.
[00:06:53.007 --> 00:06:53.987]  He said, can I have two?
[00:06:53.987 --> 00:06:55.948]  And I said, well, yeah, we're asking you on.
[00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:56.408]  You want two?
[00:06:56.408 --> 00:06:59.289]  And he said, yeah, I've got so much new information.
[00:06:59.289 --> 00:06:59.869]  You'll remember.
[00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:15.832]  Before the 2020 election he testified to Congress and showed how Google alone with 90 plus percent search engine control would be able to skew elections by 15 to 30 points and he showed 100% the algorithms how it works.
[00:07:15.832 --> 00:07:20.835]  Now they've intensified that since then and in the midterms as you saw.
[00:07:20.835 --> 00:07:22.857]  That's just one company that can steal the election.
[00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:33.132]  Then you've got the FBI, you've got the Justice Department, the CIA, heavily involved in the weaponization, and that all came out in the weaponization hearings.
[00:07:33.132 --> 00:07:48.555]  And if you remember, after the globalists put O'Biden in, in January 2021, the first big press conference they had after they cut the Keystone Pipeline and reinstituted the carbon cuts to shut down our economy,
[00:07:49.522 --> 00:08:04.693]  The second thing O'Biden did was have a press conference with then-Gen Psaki, the evil raggedy Ann, and they said Trump supporters are terrorists and the main terror threat is the American people.
[00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:13.959]  Then in June of that year they put up the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism that said the number one crime in America is white supremacists.
[00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:15.681]  Now that's like saying the number one
[00:08:17.239 --> 00:08:28.308]  Creature that lives on the Midwestern Plains is an Easter Bunny, or a Keebler Elf, or a Unicorn.
[00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:29.889]  Extremely rare.
[00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:33.171]  There are some white supremacist attacks.
[00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:37.074]  They are the rarest form of crime in the United States.
[00:08:37.074 --> 00:08:39.856]  Total fraud by the FBI.
[00:08:39.856 --> 00:08:41.818]  Being directed by Biden.
[00:08:41.818 --> 00:08:42.759]  I'll give you some background.
[00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:44.040]  There's been some big new developments.
[00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:48.993]  And then you've seen the talking heads on CNN, ABC News, NBC, MSNBC.
[00:08:48.993 --> 00:08:49.654]  We played the clubs.
[00:08:50.734 --> 00:08:55.815]  Saying we need to use Homeland Security as the main body to go after Trump supporters.
[00:08:55.815 --> 00:08:56.695]  They're terrorists.
[00:08:56.695 --> 00:08:57.935]  We need to smash them.
[00:08:57.935 --> 00:08:59.836]  We need to burn them down.
[00:08:59.836 --> 00:09:00.776]  We need to destroy them.
[00:09:00.776 --> 00:09:01.856]  We need to outlaw them.
[00:09:01.856 --> 00:09:03.336]  We need to demolish them.
[00:09:03.336 --> 00:09:04.976]  These are all exact quotes.
[00:09:04.976 --> 00:09:08.357]  In fact, I'm going to ask one of our great researchers, Darren McBreen.
[00:09:08.357 --> 00:09:10.757]  He's always got a big database of the clips.
[00:09:10.757 --> 00:09:12.118]  Because everything I mention, they've said.
[00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:13.898]  You just type it in and you'll find it.
[00:09:13.898 --> 00:09:17.059]  Anybody listening can.
[00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:19.039]  MSNBC host calls for
[00:09:20.233 --> 00:09:23.075]  Burning down Trump movement.
[00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:26.476]  CNN host calls for outlawing Trump movement.
[00:09:26.476 --> 00:09:28.758]  It goes on and on.
[00:09:28.758 --> 00:09:36.301]  And now Newsweek has a big report, Donald Trump followers targeted by FBI on 2024 election fears.
[00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:40.724]  It is a big thick article and it's written like I would write it because it's true.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.021]  And it's got senior FBI people saying, this is how you start a civil war.
[00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:48.362]  We're really concerned.
[00:09:48.362 --> 00:09:49.682]  This is illegal.
[00:09:49.682 --> 00:09:57.384]  We should not be using the anti-terror apparatus on a political movement and on the presidential frontrunner.
[00:09:57.384 --> 00:10:00.445]  When I read this article, when I got up at 5 a.m.
[00:10:00.445 --> 00:10:06.867]  this morning, I actually read the article twice and I'd rarely do that because I don't have a lot of time.
[00:10:06.867 --> 00:10:07.187]  It is a
[00:10:14.252 --> 00:10:33.206]  Nineteen page article and I think I'm just going to read the whole thing because they talked to a whole bunch of senior FBI officials who said Congress needs to stop this right now.
[00:10:33.206 --> 00:10:36.328]  Now, obviously, we're not even saying these are perfect people.
[00:10:36.328 --> 00:10:37.049]  I'm not.
[00:10:37.049 --> 00:10:37.950]  They're smart, though.
[00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:40.099]  And let me just say something.
[00:10:40.099 --> 00:10:45.501]  I'm not having any part in a civil war between the federal government and the American people.
[00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:48.122]  They're going to try to set me up like they already did.
[00:10:48.122 --> 00:10:49.882]  We don't want to be involved in this.
[00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:51.362]  They don't want to be involved in this.
[00:10:51.362 --> 00:10:55.284]  This is insane.
[00:10:55.284 --> 00:10:58.604]  Be like two pit bulls putting a cage together to kill each other.
[00:10:58.604 --> 00:10:59.505]  I'm not a pit bull.
[00:10:59.505 --> 00:11:01.045]  I'm not part of this.
[00:11:01.045 --> 00:11:02.225]  Try to take me to a FEMA camp.
[00:11:02.225 --> 00:11:04.006]  You try to forcibly inject me and my family.
[00:11:06.164 --> 00:11:07.245]  I'll defend myself.
[00:11:07.245 --> 00:11:13.890]  I'm not looking for the trouble, but if you're going to try to do that, there's a line in the sand here.
[00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.932]  And they're definitely trying to gear that up around the world.
[00:11:15.932 --> 00:11:18.134]  You saw the beta test of that with COVID.
[00:11:18.134 --> 00:11:25.300]  But that said, I don't need to make my bones or feel like a man going out and killing a bunch of federal agents.
[00:11:27.898 --> 00:11:35.905]  I'd rather kill the ideas that they're pushing and kill the political movement that's completely illegal and cancer and stop it down its tracks.
[00:11:35.905 --> 00:11:41.189]  And I told you I've met with federal judges, senior ones.
[00:11:41.189 --> 00:11:42.751]  I've met with senior federal officials.
[00:11:44.005 --> 00:11:59.333]  And they tell me that the majority are absolutely horrified, and you see the whistleblowers, you see the leaks on our side, and though they're run by complete criminals, I would say the majority of them are horrified by what has happened to the country and the position they're being put in.
[00:11:59.333 --> 00:12:07.118]  Because let me tell you, I don't want to take the feds on, even though in a real civil war we'll destroy them, and they don't want to take us on.
[00:12:07.118 --> 00:12:09.619]  Because, let me explain something.
[00:12:09.619 --> 00:12:13.061]  The globalists want to bring the country down with this civil war.
[00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:22.856]  The Democrats are doing things with political prosecution and election theft that have never been done in a free country before, and we are becoming a total tyrant.
[00:12:22.856 --> 00:12:24.417]  We're deep down the road.
[00:12:24.417 --> 00:12:26.478]  They want an angrier world.
[00:12:26.478 --> 00:12:28.019]  They want the resources cut off.
[00:12:28.019 --> 00:12:29.540]  They want the police cut off.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.561]  They want explosive crime.
[00:12:31.561 --> 00:12:35.844]  They want people to give up and society break down.
[00:12:35.844 --> 00:12:38.966]  All the experts keep saying, like, you know, the big historian
[00:12:43.854 --> 00:12:55.564]  That was on Tucker yesterday, saying, this will destroy society, that they're following an exact plan to bring the country down.
[00:12:55.564 --> 00:13:02.870]  Yes, and they know exactly what they're doing, and they need us to all start killing each other.
[00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:07.553]  So, it's going to do nothing if, let's say today, a million Americans
[00:13:08.433 --> 00:13:13.054]  Rose up and blew up or burned down every federal courthouse and every FBI building.
[00:13:13.054 --> 00:13:14.715]  And we could do it in one hour.
[00:13:14.715 --> 00:13:15.935]  No problem.
[00:13:15.935 --> 00:13:18.176]  If people decided to do it, it would happen.
[00:13:18.176 --> 00:13:21.357]  The globalists are going to cut the power at that point.
[00:13:21.357 --> 00:13:23.497]  They've already got us in World War III with Russia.
[00:13:23.497 --> 00:13:26.078]  China would immediately invade Taiwan.
[00:13:26.078 --> 00:13:29.139]  And then World War III would go nuclear.
[00:13:29.139 --> 00:13:31.159]  No violence.
[00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:32.780]  No attacking feds.
[00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:49.670]  And I would tell the feds, and I don't think you need me to tell you this because if you've got an IQ above room temperature you know this, are you dumb enough to let the deep state globalist black rock manipulate you into a war with the American people?
[00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.891]  Well, according to the FBI, no.
[00:13:56.812 --> 00:14:01.054]  So this article is spectacularly important.
[00:14:01.054 --> 00:14:04.376]  And I don't just need to know, oh, I just trust Newsweek.
[00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:07.018]  I know every part of this, up one side and down the other.
[00:14:07.018 --> 00:14:09.499]  I'm the guy that made the four original police state films.
[00:14:09.499 --> 00:14:12.541]  I've tracked every sector of this.
[00:14:12.541 --> 00:14:17.664]  I've had endless constitutional lawyers and insiders and you name it.
[00:14:17.664 --> 00:14:20.706]  We get sources from the FBI hostage rescue team.
[00:14:20.706 --> 00:14:23.547]  We have sources inside the high levels of the CIA.
[00:14:23.547 --> 00:14:24.148]  We're dialed in.
[00:14:25.236 --> 00:14:30.740]  So when I tell you this article is dead on, it is.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:35.584]  And it is really a cry for help by the FBI.
[00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:38.707]  And if I was the FBI, I'd be crying for help too.
[00:14:38.707 --> 00:14:41.809]  The whole country should be crying for help that we all stop this.
[00:14:41.809 --> 00:14:44.111]  Because we're all in a bad position.
[00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:49.435]  Nobody wins but the scumbags that run the New World Order.
[00:14:49.435 --> 00:14:52.238]  And at the end of the day, they're going to destroy themselves doing this as well.
[00:14:52.238 --> 00:14:53.238]  This is in
[00:14:54.836 --> 00:14:57.558]  Sane.
[00:14:57.558 --> 00:15:08.788]  Completely insane and out of control and it needs to stop five years ago.
[00:15:08.788 --> 00:15:12.411]  The civil and criminal cases against Trump are beyond fraud.
[00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.573]  And then notice it really hit a nerve with the American people.
[00:15:14.573 --> 00:15:16.554]  Let's get the break.
[00:15:16.554 --> 00:15:20.718]  It really hit a nerve with the American people.
[00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:28.878]  When Trump didn't get a jury trial with Letitia James and this bozo-the-clown judge in New York.
[00:15:28.878 --> 00:15:32.922]  So I saw articles last night and this morning saying, oh, Trump could have chosen a jury trial.
[00:15:32.922 --> 00:15:34.383]  He didn't.
[00:15:34.383 --> 00:15:39.708]  And the judge even said it in court yesterday, and Trump got visibly angry and basically stormed out.
[00:15:39.708 --> 00:15:41.189]  He wanted to talk to his lawyers.
[00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:45.714]  I called people that are his lawyers, and I called other lawyers this morning.
[00:15:46.809 --> 00:15:47.990]  And I said, is this true?
[00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.511]  And they said, no.
[00:15:49.511 --> 00:15:55.477]  New York passed a law, Letitia James brought it against Trump, where you do not get a jury trial.
[00:15:55.477 --> 00:16:05.405]  But the damn judge said yesterday, and I got the transcript right here, because there's no cameras in there except the start.
[00:16:05.405 --> 00:16:07.147]  Mr. Trump is incorrect.
[00:16:07.147 --> 00:16:09.789]  If he would have asked for a jury trial, I would have considered it.
[00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:12.871]  No, not under the law.
[00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:16.475]  The judge can't even give you a jury trial under the law.
[00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:16.955]  I called.
[00:16:16.955 --> 00:16:18.096]  I checked.
[00:16:18.096 --> 00:16:19.698]  I had the law sent to me.
[00:16:19.698 --> 00:16:31.089]  And again, the level of lying that judge, that evil judge, that's given speeches to law students that, well, I just ignore the law when I want, and if I'm emotional, I just ignore juries.
[00:16:31.089 --> 00:16:32.891]  And we played the clip two days ago.
[00:16:33.732 --> 00:16:37.174]  He looked at Trump and said, you could have had a jury trial.
[00:16:37.174 --> 00:16:42.197]  Stop saying that you didn't get a jury trial because you didn't ask for one.
[00:16:42.197 --> 00:16:47.700]  And I immediately made phone calls last night and this morning and talked to three lawyers.
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.702]  And they said, no.
[00:16:50.702 --> 00:16:53.663]  Then I called Roger Stone who talks to Trump every day.
[00:16:53.663 --> 00:16:55.184]  He already made that call yesterday.
[00:16:55.184 --> 00:16:57.746]  No, it was a lie.
[00:16:59.571 --> 00:17:06.393]  So they're like, oh, you know, Alex could have got a jury trial and his stuff, he'd have just given them the discovery.
[00:17:06.393 --> 00:17:08.474]  That's a lie.
[00:17:08.474 --> 00:17:23.099]  So I know you know they lie, but ladies and gentlemen, the level is just stratospheric where the judge is in there in front of the media.
[00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:26.981]  Yeah, one of the articles that has it quoted is Donald Trump starts to crack.
[00:17:28.544 --> 00:17:29.784]  He didn't get cracked.
[00:17:29.784 --> 00:17:34.665]  He didn't crack, he got pissed off.
[00:17:34.665 --> 00:17:40.187]  When the judge admonished him in the court, you could have had a jury trial or you'd have asked for one.
[00:17:40.187 --> 00:17:44.688]  Trump starts talking to his lawyers, gets up, walks out with them.
[00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:45.328]  Asks them, is that true?
[00:17:45.328 --> 00:17:46.008]  They go, no sir.
[00:17:46.008 --> 00:17:48.729]  I mean, it's just...
[00:17:51.502 --> 00:17:53.363]  I get why Trump was even stunned.
[00:17:53.363 --> 00:17:55.264]  He knows they said no jury trial.
[00:17:55.264 --> 00:17:56.685]  He knows that that's what the law says.
[00:17:56.685 --> 00:18:00.047]  Yeah, they're passing laws where you don't get jury trials in New York.
[00:18:00.047 --> 00:18:03.669]  They're giving illegal aliens driver's license.
[00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:06.590]  They're housing them in five-star and four-star hotels.
[00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:19.998]  In Illinois, they're closing the football gymnasiums and soccer gymnasiums and volleyball gymnasiums to the high schoolers and middle schoolers for illegal aliens to live in.
[00:18:21.129 --> 00:18:28.105]  I have those articles and people protesting at the Chicago City Council last night.
[00:18:28.105 --> 00:18:29.989]  And they're like, how can you take our children's...
[00:18:31.491 --> 00:18:36.232]  Sports away, and there's these black ladies going, listen, most of our kids don't have fathers.
[00:18:36.232 --> 00:18:38.353]  Their fathers are these coaches.
[00:18:38.353 --> 00:18:48.215]  And our sons and our daughters are doing good because they basically are at school seven days a week, and these coaches are their fathers, and they exercise, and they study, and they're doing well.
[00:18:48.215 --> 00:18:55.437]  And now you're taking their gymnasiums away.
[00:18:55.437 --> 00:18:57.878]  And their field houses.
[00:18:57.878 --> 00:18:58.538]  And giving it
[00:18:59.522 --> 00:19:01.103]  To illegal aliens.
[00:19:01.103 --> 00:19:05.107]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:19:05.107 --> 00:19:08.449]  Of course, everything's going to be taken away from you.
[00:19:08.449 --> 00:19:11.192]  They don't want to just take your sons and daughters' gymnasiums away.
[00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:16.696]  They want to cut their breasts and testicles off.
[00:19:16.696 --> 00:19:21.260]  And fillet their penises and turn them into inverted vaginas.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.702]  And I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be crass.
[00:19:23.702 --> 00:19:25.023]  This is the reality.
[00:19:25.023 --> 00:19:27.705]  But let me stop, let me stop.
[00:19:27.705 --> 00:19:28.446]  There's not just
[00:19:32.625 --> 00:19:39.687]  Biden creating secretly last week a database of Trump Republicans saying they're terrorists and are the big terror threat.
[00:19:39.687 --> 00:19:47.449]  And instead of being Al Qaeda or ISIS or Hezbollah, it says, no, no, you're in a database.
[00:19:47.449 --> 00:19:53.010]  No warrant, no investigation, no probable cause, no reasonable suspicion.
[00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.851]  Just you support President Trump.
[00:19:55.851 --> 00:19:57.251]  You, you, that's it.
[00:19:59.492 --> 00:20:01.753]  What did the original June report of 2021 say?
[00:20:01.753 --> 00:20:26.486]  It said you are a white supremacist, the number one terror threat, which it isn't, if you believe we shouldn't have open borders, if you believe in replacement migration, if you believe the election was stolen, if you're against lockdowns, if you're in forced injections, and then later they added if you're against the Afghan withdrawal, the way it was done, or if you're against anything,
[00:20:29.256 --> 00:20:33.440]  Remember the headline even on NBC News?
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:42.309]  NBC Nightly News, you are a terrorist, a number one terror threat, if you question lockdowns, vaccines, or elections.
[00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:46.333]  That was the famous chyron they put up.
[00:20:46.333 --> 00:20:46.894]  People are like, what?
[00:20:53.757 --> 00:21:05.099]  Biden and the New World Order already sent FBI agents and others landing in helicopters to scare people in Virginia and other states because they didn't like their kids being taught they were evil because they were white when they're six years old.
[00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:11.541]  Or they didn't want convicted pedophiles coming to the school or transgender young men raping girls in the bathroom.
[00:21:11.541 --> 00:21:22.783]  And we know Merrick Garland had the teachers union send a letter to them asking them to send them.
[00:21:23.954 --> 00:21:29.536]  Like, oh, we better not go to the school board meeting, the FBI will get us.
[00:21:29.536 --> 00:21:35.039]  Oh, the conservative Catholics, they're the number one terror threat in this group.
[00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:35.479]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:21:35.479 --> 00:21:37.040]  Potential terror threats.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.281]  Opposition to COVID measures.
[00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:40.441]  Claims of election fraud.
[00:21:40.441 --> 00:21:44.583]  Belief Trump can be reinstated by an election.
[00:21:44.583 --> 00:21:47.604]  9-1-1 anniversary and religious holidays.
[00:21:47.604 --> 00:21:48.204]  It goes on and on.
[00:21:48.204 --> 00:21:49.105]  They had a bunch of other ones.
[00:21:52.253 --> 00:21:53.034]  It gets worse.
[00:21:53.034 --> 00:21:58.398]  Listen to this, and this is good.
[00:21:58.398 --> 00:22:10.126]  Fox News, Biden agency likely violated free speech by working with big tech to censor election content and was election interference and election theft.
[00:22:10.126 --> 00:22:20.294]  So a attorney general and federal courts at the state and federal level, the courts are ruling that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals
[00:22:21.328 --> 00:22:27.591]  What the undercourt already said that that's illegal civil rights violation.
[00:22:27.591 --> 00:22:31.613]  To have these agencies hooked up with big tech surveilling you, that's illegal to begin with.
[00:22:31.613 --> 00:22:34.775]  They're watching everything you do.
[00:22:34.775 --> 00:22:36.435]  Not if you say, hey, I'm gonna go kill a bunch of people.
[00:22:36.435 --> 00:22:37.736]  Well, now you're under surveillance.
[00:22:37.736 --> 00:22:40.157]  Now they can watch you because they've got a reason.
[00:22:40.157 --> 00:22:42.418]  But no, you think the election was stolen.
[00:22:42.418 --> 00:22:44.059]  Okay, we're watching you.
[00:22:44.059 --> 00:22:47.261]  Now we're gonna censor you.
[00:22:47.261 --> 00:22:47.681]  Likely.
[00:22:50.592 --> 00:22:55.735]  That's like saying Charles Manson's cult likely murdered some people.
[00:22:55.735 --> 00:22:58.857]  Or Jeffrey Dahmer was likely a cannibal.
[00:22:58.857 --> 00:23:09.364]  But at least the federal courts are saying, oh, there's an injunction, you better stop this, it's likely illegal.
[00:23:09.364 --> 00:23:11.526]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's not likely illegal.
[00:23:12.642 --> 00:23:20.207]  The CIA is quarterbacking, quote, brainwashing, quote, terrorizing the public during COVID.
[00:23:20.207 --> 00:23:24.990]  And all the other Western intelligence agencies bragged that they did it.
[00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.892]  They use, quote, mind control.
[00:23:26.892 --> 00:23:35.878]  Those are headlines in the London Telegraph and in the National Post and in the Washington Post.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:46.023]  So, we have a rogue, out-of-control government run by BlackRock and a bunch of offshore banks that have literally set up China to take us over.
[00:23:46.023 --> 00:23:48.785]  China owns four of the six Hollywood production houses.
[00:23:48.785 --> 00:23:52.406]  They're funding race war programming.
[00:23:52.406 --> 00:24:03.291]  And now, Merrick Garland says to the FBI, it's not enough for you to go after the conservative Catholics or soccer moms that don't want their six-year-old son told he's evil because he's white.
[00:24:04.045 --> 00:24:06.326]  Or their seven-year-old daughter told they're able because they're white.
[00:24:06.326 --> 00:24:09.128]  Literally, you're inherently black because of your skin color.
[00:24:09.128 --> 00:24:10.529]  Critical race theory.
[00:24:10.529 --> 00:24:13.111]  Now we want 80 million voters plus.
[00:24:13.111 --> 00:24:15.032]  You know what's more than that?
[00:24:15.032 --> 00:24:16.893]  We want 80 million people.
[00:24:16.893 --> 00:24:20.295]  That's quite an army.
[00:24:20.295 --> 00:24:25.498]  Our military couldn't defeat in 20 years, maybe 100,000 Taliban fighters.
[00:24:31.684 --> 00:24:32.704]  What does Zbigniew Brzezinski say?
[00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:35.526]  He said, in the future, you'll have to kill everybody.
[00:24:35.526 --> 00:24:37.446]  In the past, we controlled people with propaganda.
[00:24:37.446 --> 00:24:38.167]  It doesn't work anymore.
[00:24:38.167 --> 00:24:40.928]  Now we just have to kill everybody.
[00:24:40.928 --> 00:24:44.409]  And that's really where this threat continuum goes.
[00:24:44.409 --> 00:24:52.012]  If the censorship and intimidation and debanking and attacks and imprisonment don't work, now they just got to kill everybody.
[00:24:52.012 --> 00:24:53.853]  And that's where this goes.
[00:24:53.853 --> 00:24:55.174]  It's like a ladder.
[00:24:55.174 --> 00:24:55.634]  And they're going, do
[00:24:57.202 --> 00:25:18.038]  So now, if going after the Catholics wasn't bad enough, or saying that anybody that questions an election is a terrorist and putting you in a terror database, if that's not enough, or you don't like open borders so you're a domestic extremist, now let's just say if you're a Trump voter, period, you're put in a terrorist category.
[00:25:18.038 --> 00:25:21.981]  That's the definition of biting off more than you can chew.
[00:25:21.981 --> 00:25:25.164]  That's not like one man being given two days to eat an elephant.
[00:25:26.308 --> 00:25:35.319]  That's like one man being given an hour to eat 5,000 elephants.
[00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:38.203]  I mean, do the math.
[00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:43.810]  A couple hundred thousand feds are going to now declare 80 plus million people terrorists.
[00:25:45.916 --> 00:25:53.419]  And they're going to be given the job to mess with us and obviously stir up plots like the Whitmer kidnapping and January 6th to make us look bad.
[00:25:53.419 --> 00:25:56.400]  And I'm just sitting here going, okay, you know what?
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.501]  Maybe the expiration date's up on the planet.
[00:25:58.501 --> 00:26:06.725]  If everybody wants to nuke everything and the feds want to declare war on their own country and you want to chop all the little boy's dicks off, then just, fine, blow the planet up!
[00:26:09.673 --> 00:26:18.577]  By the way, that Antifa COO is what he called himself that got stabbed to death by the black man for no reason in New York.
[00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:23.679]  His girlfriend and friends are saying, oh, they're very sad for the man that stabbed him to death.
[00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:25.560]  And they're not raising money for his family.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.262]  They're raising money for themselves so they can go on, quote, vacations because they feel bad about his death.
[00:26:30.262 --> 00:26:34.664]  These communists are so disgusting.
[00:26:34.664 --> 00:26:37.866]  And while he's bleeding to death, she says, oh, I'm so sorry to him.
[00:26:39.753 --> 00:26:40.873]  We're gonna play that video.
[00:26:40.873 --> 00:26:48.755]  I mean, look at these people with their $1,000 cell phones and their designer shoes and watches.
[00:26:48.755 --> 00:26:54.777]  And she's got that she's into Karl Marx on her social media.
[00:26:54.777 --> 00:26:58.258]  Yeah, well, if you're into Karl Marx, sweetheart, why don't you move to North Korea?
[00:26:58.258 --> 00:27:01.338]  You'd love working in a slave labor camp.
[00:27:01.338 --> 00:27:03.019]  I mean, look at these pea brains.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:16.484]  And of course, mainly who gets killed by all the rampaging, brainwashed minority groups of the majority now that think whites are inherently evil.
[00:27:16.484 --> 00:27:20.725]  And so there's just thousands of whites being murdered a week because they're white.
[00:27:20.725 --> 00:27:22.026]  There's hundreds of videos a day.
[00:27:22.026 --> 00:27:24.447]  I can just fill the whole show with it.
[00:27:24.447 --> 00:27:25.467]  And they'll tell them, you're white!
[00:27:25.467 --> 00:27:25.787]  Boom!
[00:27:25.787 --> 00:27:26.267]  You're white!
[00:27:26.267 --> 00:27:27.508]  Stab!
[00:27:27.508 --> 00:27:30.549]  And then the left's like, oh, well, we deserve it.
[00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:33.450]  And then you think you're safe in
[00:27:34.355 --> 00:27:35.815]  Brooklyn at 4 a.m.
[00:27:35.815 --> 00:27:37.616]  in your little trendy suit?
[00:27:37.616 --> 00:27:42.236]  Your little Karl Marx outfit?
[00:27:42.236 --> 00:27:48.917]  And your little dumbass girlfriend?
[00:27:48.917 --> 00:27:50.358]  They're the pseudo-intellectuals.
[00:27:50.358 --> 00:27:51.498]  Oh, they're the rebels.
[00:27:51.498 --> 00:27:53.078]  No, they're fun about BlackRock.
[00:27:53.078 --> 00:27:57.519]  They're fun about the most powerful weapons manufacturers in the world.
[00:27:57.519 --> 00:28:00.159]  The globalists run the universities and they run these pea-brains.
[00:28:00.159 --> 00:28:03.480]  So I tell the left, tell you what, sweetheart, you know,
[00:28:04.497 --> 00:28:06.918]  You say you're sad for the guy that stabbed your boyfriend to death?
[00:28:06.918 --> 00:28:09.179]  How about you just keep going down there at 4 a.m.?
[00:28:09.179 --> 00:28:12.020]  How about you just get on those subways everywhere?
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.641]  And don't use your white privilege to get killed.
[00:28:14.641 --> 00:28:19.022]  Because I don't want you to get killed, dumbass.
[00:28:19.022 --> 00:28:20.383]  You're the product of brainwashing.
[00:28:20.383 --> 00:28:21.743]  But just understand this.
[00:28:21.743 --> 00:28:24.564]  You're not getting our guns, sweetheart.
[00:28:24.564 --> 00:28:30.006]  Anybody pulls a knife on me, you're gonna die.
[00:28:30.006 --> 00:28:31.087]  I don't care what color you are.
[00:28:32.025 --> 00:28:38.088]  But you notice all these racist, crazy black people, they feed on dumbass communist whites.
[00:28:38.088 --> 00:28:42.851]  So I guess, at the end of the day, it's the Darwin Awards.
[00:28:42.851 --> 00:28:43.611]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:28:43.611 --> 00:28:44.292]  Maybe she's right.
[00:28:44.292 --> 00:28:46.413]  Maybe the guy that did it's, you know, an okay guy.
[00:28:46.413 --> 00:28:48.694]  Maybe we should give him a medal.
[00:28:48.694 --> 00:28:49.575]  No, I don't think so.
[00:28:49.575 --> 00:28:51.876]  I'm sad this dumb communist is dead.
[00:28:51.876 --> 00:28:54.477]  But he is dumb, and he is dead.
[00:28:54.477 --> 00:28:56.458]  He messed around, he found out.
[00:28:56.458 --> 00:28:56.939]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:56.939 --> 00:28:57.319]  Stay with us.
[00:29:00.185 --> 00:29:04.708]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[00:29:04.708 --> 00:29:09.891]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[00:29:09.891 --> 00:29:13.333]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[00:29:13.333 --> 00:29:14.414]  Well, I know where you are.
[00:29:14.414 --> 00:29:18.897]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.

[00:29:25.441 --> 00:29:26.122]  We're good to go.
[00:29:41.034 --> 00:29:42.735]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[00:29:42.735 --> 00:29:43.515]  I thought it was next week.
[00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:46.196]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[00:29:46.196 --> 00:29:47.757]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:30:08.703 --> 00:30:10.965]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[00:30:10.965 --> 00:30:14.447]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:30:14.447 --> 00:30:18.610]  Look how full this bottle is.
[00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:21.552]  Right to the top, folks.
[00:30:21.552 --> 00:30:24.174]  Right to the top with these 95% curcuminoid.
[00:30:27.395 --> 00:30:31.599]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[00:30:31.599 --> 00:30:33.600]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.224]  This is 95%.
[00:30:38.224 --> 00:30:39.185]  Super constant.
[00:30:39.185 --> 00:30:43.068]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[00:30:43.068 --> 00:30:44.530]  It's that powerful.
[00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.691]  Or more.

[00:32:08.231 --> 00:32:13.714]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[00:32:13.714 --> 00:32:18.676]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega-3s.
[00:32:20.037 --> 00:32:24.880]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[00:33:01.283 --> 00:33:17.433]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:17.433 --> 00:33:19.134]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:24.272]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:24.272 --> 00:33:33.118]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:33.118 --> 00:33:45.767]  Alright, so we have a very corrupt, out of control, ruling class owned by foreign banks.
[00:33:47.529 --> 00:33:55.554]  That are literally going to take our energy, our cars, our children, our money, our future, our health, our bodily autonomy away from us.
[00:33:55.554 --> 00:34:15.026]  They are deep into it and they are starting an insane war between the American people and the Justice Department and the crazy lawyers like Merrick Garland, who I guarantee you could not fight his way out of a paper bag, that now has the mainly veteran FBI
[00:34:16.954 --> 00:34:26.843]  Who actually have been in combat, most of them, start a fight with the American people and launch false flags to be blamed on us so they can get the party started.
[00:34:26.843 --> 00:34:33.208]  And that is the most insane, dangerous course of action I could imagine.
[00:34:33.208 --> 00:34:43.237]  And as I said, there is a huge article that we're going to have posted under the live show feed, a link to exclusive Donald Trump followers targeted by the FBI as 2024.
[00:34:46.658 --> 00:34:48.699]  Electioneers.
[00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:53.401]  And it's a very basically apologetic letter.
[00:34:53.401 --> 00:34:59.743]  And the quotes of these senior FBI people are like, well, we don't think we should list a major political movement as terrorist.
[00:34:59.743 --> 00:35:01.804]  And this is a terrorist database.
[00:35:01.804 --> 00:35:08.066]  And this is going to be really, really bad, like with the Catholic conservatives being targeted and other people.
[00:35:08.066 --> 00:35:14.629]  And gee, we hope there's congressional oversight of this, because this probably isn't legal.
[00:35:17.757 --> 00:35:23.180]  I'm going to read the 19-page article.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:32.826]  But it also still introduces the idea like, oh, we're sorry, but we're the good cops.
[00:35:32.826 --> 00:35:34.607]  We're not the bad cops on top.
[00:35:34.607 --> 00:35:36.208]  We really don't think this is a good idea.
[00:35:36.208 --> 00:35:38.329]  Regardless, this is how it's being introduced to us.
[00:35:40.683 --> 00:36:04.328]  And I told you, the logical extension of this would be the public declaration that not just if you question open borders, or human trafficking, or forced injections, or lockdowns, or Afghan withdrawals, or censorship, or the ADL, or LGBTQPS, because now it's pedophilia and Satanism being taught really as the main canon of liberal pedo obsession.
[00:36:11.294 --> 00:36:20.562]  Now they're saying, if you don't like any of this, if you don't like us coming after your children and after your bodily autonomy, well, you're a terrorist.
[00:36:20.562 --> 00:36:21.783]  And you're in a terror database.
[00:36:21.783 --> 00:36:23.304]  It says that right here in the article.
[00:36:23.304 --> 00:36:29.670]  I mean, I know we've got the original directive O'Biden put out in June of 2021.
[00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:34.074]  Almost two and a half years ago.
[00:36:34.074 --> 00:36:36.336]  So I suggest everybody go read this article.
[00:36:39.082 --> 00:36:47.366]  Newsweek spoke to over a dozen current and former government officials who specialize in terrorism in a three-month investigation.
[00:36:47.366 --> 00:36:54.429]  And it goes into how they are defining it as terrorism.
[00:36:54.429 --> 00:36:57.970]  If you promote conspiracies about COVID-19 pandemic, you're a terrorist.
[00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.391]  Look right here.
[00:37:00.391 --> 00:37:01.632]  Terrorist.
[00:37:01.632 --> 00:37:05.894]  Oh, like the shots don't work and erase your immune system and killed rats in the studies?
[00:37:05.894 --> 00:37:06.514]  It's all true!
[00:37:06.514 --> 00:37:06.554]  No.
[00:37:09.306 --> 00:37:16.489]  It's a lie, they say, if you say ivermectin is highly effective or hydroxychloroquine.
[00:37:16.489 --> 00:37:17.550]  Of course, that's all true.
[00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:23.813]  It's been proven.
[00:37:23.813 --> 00:37:28.455]  But this is the corrupt, out-of-control group that's just stolen the last two elections.
[00:37:32.745 --> 00:37:48.111]  Now in full panic mode because the landslide, all the internal and even scientific and even skewed polls show a 10, 15, 25, 30 point lead by Trump against Biden.
[00:37:48.111 --> 00:37:54.813]  Washington Post, ABC, other polls that had 15% more Democrats in because they believe there's quote more Democrats than Republicans.
[00:37:54.813 --> 00:37:56.974]  That's not true anymore.
[00:37:56.974 --> 00:38:01.996]  Into their margin of error, into their equation, Trump's still 15 points ahead on average.
[00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:07.931]  20 plus in other key demographics.
[00:38:07.931 --> 00:38:18.855]  So, they've already used to censor and to control anti-terrorism legislation against the American people.
[00:38:18.855 --> 00:38:22.416]  And of course we said this 20 years ago when they passed the Patriot Act.
[00:38:22.416 --> 00:38:29.258]  20 plus years ago we said, first they set up the police state grid to fight the Russians, but it was always being used against us.
[00:38:29.258 --> 00:38:31.639]  Then it was expanded to quote fight the radical Muslims.
[00:38:32.588 --> 00:38:35.089]  But it was really always going to be aimed at us.
[00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:53.317]  The border is wide open, but if you want to fly from Austin to Chicago, they might want to grab your testicles, but they're certainly going to put you in a body scanner.
[00:38:53.317 --> 00:38:59.620]  But the good news is, the federal courts, up to the next highest level,
[00:39:00.711 --> 00:39:03.893]  The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the only thing higher than that is the Supreme Court.
[00:39:03.893 --> 00:39:12.457]  Biden agency likely violated free speech by working with big tech to censor election content.
[00:39:12.457 --> 00:39:15.158]  Professor Epstein joins us coming up with huge news.
[00:39:17.335 --> 00:39:21.516]  By the way, guys, get a few clips of Professor Epstein and his testimonies to Congress.
[00:39:21.516 --> 00:39:24.696]  There's some good boildowns that'll air before he joins us.
[00:39:24.696 --> 00:39:25.377]  I'd ask for that.
[00:39:25.377 --> 00:39:29.097]  I didn't see that on my list, but it looks like you guys have it.
[00:39:29.097 --> 00:39:30.358]  So give me a list of what you do have.
[00:39:30.358 --> 00:39:33.238]  Thank you.
[00:39:33.238 --> 00:39:35.359]  This is Fox News.
[00:39:35.359 --> 00:39:40.080]  Biden committed worst First Amendment violations in nation's history.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.100]  Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey
[00:39:43.171 --> 00:39:53.356]  Reacts to White House asking a federal appeals court to block its social media ban ruling on American reports.
[00:39:53.356 --> 00:40:06.763]  A federal court ordered an injunction to continue on a top agency within the Department of Homeland Security after finding that it likely violated the First Amendment by coordinating with social media companies to effectively censor election-related speech.
[00:40:08.706 --> 00:40:12.028]  Interfering in the election doesn't get more criminal than that.
[00:40:12.028 --> 00:40:16.210]  That's what they've indicted Trump for, but this is a court ruling that with the evidence.
[00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:30.457]  On Tuesday, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals extended the scope of an injunction in place that limits the Biden administration's communication with big tech companies to include the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency with the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:40:30.457 --> 00:40:35.940]  You know the one saying if you're a Trump supporter, a Trump voter, you're now in a terror database.
[00:40:37.967 --> 00:40:39.569]  That sounds unreal, doesn't it?
[00:40:39.569 --> 00:40:43.255]  Because it's totally illegal.
[00:40:43.255 --> 00:40:45.318]  And completely dangerous.
[00:40:45.318 --> 00:40:46.700]  And absolutely out of control.
[00:40:47.571 --> 00:41:07.236]  According to GOP Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who's leading, God bless him, the litigation against the Biden administration, CISA is the nerve center, close quote, of the White House, quote, vast censorship enterprise, and the, quote, very entity that worked with the FBI to silence the Hunter Biden laptop story.
[00:41:07.236 --> 00:41:14.938]  CISA was created to protect Americans from foreign attack, and now it's being used to target its own citizens, Bailey told Fox News.
[00:41:15.834 --> 00:41:16.795]  And the article goes on.
[00:41:16.795 --> 00:41:18.176]  And that's absolutely true.
[00:41:18.176 --> 00:41:21.858]  You see, I've experienced this.
[00:41:21.858 --> 00:41:23.560]  And so have you.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:29.364]  Hundreds of millions of posts removed off of big tech platforms.
[00:41:29.364 --> 00:41:33.226]  They admit their own reports by the FBI, by the CIA.
[00:41:34.747 --> 00:41:40.811]  A mom saying her husband had a heart attack after the shot, or a dad talking about his 10-year-old dying after the shot.
[00:41:40.811 --> 00:41:42.973]  Sorry, you're taking it offline.
[00:41:42.973 --> 00:41:46.995]  Doesn't matter if you have a death certificate saying the shot killed your son or daughter.
[00:41:46.995 --> 00:42:02.706]  You're not allowed to say it, because the CIA and the FBI and the ADL decided to shut your filthy piehole, you dirty American!
[00:42:05.367 --> 00:42:09.631]  FBI creates MAGA extremist category.
[00:42:09.631 --> 00:42:12.133]  We thought it was bad Hillary called them deplorables.
[00:42:12.133 --> 00:42:19.719]  FBI creates MAGA extremist category targets Trump supporters ahead of the 2024 election.
[00:42:19.719 --> 00:42:24.743]  Boy, if that isn't election meddling, what is?
[00:42:24.743 --> 00:42:29.727]  If that isn't police state, what is it?
[00:42:29.727 --> 00:42:33.350]  FBI quietly created a new category of extremism ahead of the 2024 election including Trump and
[00:42:34.338 --> 00:42:37.460]  Anybody that supports the agenda of freedom.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.102]  Meanwhile, American apocalypse.
[00:42:40.102 --> 00:42:41.663]  71% in the national poll don't trust U.S.
[00:42:41.663 --> 00:42:43.504]  government to prevent doomsday.
[00:42:43.504 --> 00:42:46.286]  And top scientific group agrees.
[00:42:46.286 --> 00:42:48.487]  We'll cover this and a lot more on the other side.
[00:42:48.487 --> 00:42:55.171]  Then Professor Epstein joins us to take the deep dive on how they plan and are currently stealing the 2024 election.
[00:43:00.011 --> 00:43:04.054]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:43:04.054 --> 00:43:07.616]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:43:07.616 --> 00:43:12.719]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:43:12.719 --> 00:43:15.161]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:43:15.161 --> 00:43:23.766]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[00:43:23.766 --> 00:43:25.087]  This is the Great Awakening.
[00:43:25.607 --> 00:43:29.972]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:43:29.972 --> 00:43:36.660]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller and this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:40.384]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWars.com
[00:43:40.384 --> 00:43:40.684]  Thank you.

[00:44:08.578 --> 00:44:11.059]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:44:11.059 --> 00:44:11.879]  Hey, what's better?
[00:44:11.879 --> 00:44:12.720]  Knockout?
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.060]  What's better?
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:14.801]  Down-and-out?
[00:44:14.801 --> 00:44:15.341]  What's better?
[00:44:15.341 --> 00:44:17.602]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:44:17.602 --> 00:44:22.525]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:44:23.214 --> 00:44:27.199]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:44:27.199 --> 00:44:28.500]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.822]  They're all very diverse.
[00:44:29.822 --> 00:44:40.013]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.

[00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:01.371]  Hey everybody, Rodney Art Brown here.
[00:45:01.371 --> 00:45:06.734]  I want to thank Alex Jones and InfoWars for offering scholarships to River University.
[00:45:06.734 --> 00:45:14.379]  Maybe you're watching InfoWars today and you don't know what to do with the problems that we face in the world today.
[00:45:14.379 --> 00:45:18.942]  You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023.
[00:45:18.942 --> 00:45:25.286]  But here at River University, not only do we show you what the problem is, but we show you how to deal with it.
[00:45:25.746 --> 00:45:37.315]  Come, a full three-year bachelor degree will train you up in ministry, government, worship, that you can go out and actually bring about a transformation in the earth today.
[00:45:37.315 --> 00:45:43.880]  We have graduates going all over the world, from the Arctic to the outback, and right here, this is what we do.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:47.623]  We specialize in training people and equipping them for
[00:45:48.323 --> 00:45:49.464]  Transformation.
[00:45:49.464 --> 00:45:50.685]  And that's what you'll do.
[00:45:50.685 --> 00:45:59.912]  So scan the QR code right now or go to riveruniversity.org and get the free scholarship offered to you by InfoWallz.
[00:45:59.912 --> 00:46:08.178]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's going on.
[00:46:08.178 --> 00:46:09.679]  And these are game-changing products.
[00:46:09.679 --> 00:46:11.500]  It's like our information's game-changing.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.742]  These products are incredible.
[00:46:13.742 --> 00:46:16.204]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[00:46:17.466 --> 00:46:31.677]  All three of the InfoWars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months are now back in stock, but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get three or four thousand bottles of each one of these.
[00:46:31.677 --> 00:46:36.081]  We've got four thousand bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[00:46:37.148 --> 00:46:44.413]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 testosterone boost that just came in, and we've got about 3,000 bottles of Pain MD.
[00:46:44.413 --> 00:46:48.575]  Incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[00:46:48.575 --> 00:46:55.180]  All three of these are back in stock, and they're incredible, and they fund our operation at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:01.078 --> 00:47:05.682]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:05.682 --> 00:47:07.003]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:47:38.434 --> 00:47:40.315]  I do not territorialize information.
[00:47:40.315 --> 00:47:45.618]  A lot of talk show hosts and authors get really upset when they see people pick up their view of the world and promote it.
[00:47:45.618 --> 00:47:46.578]  That's called victory.
[00:47:46.578 --> 00:47:48.459]  I love Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:47:48.459 --> 00:47:49.440]  He's a great filmmaker.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.281]  One of the greatest documentary filmmakers ever.
[00:47:51.281 --> 00:47:54.163]  He's got his big Police State movie coming out.
[00:47:54.163 --> 00:47:55.243]  He'll play a trailer for it in a moment.
[00:47:55.243 --> 00:47:56.144]  We should get him on the show.
[00:47:56.144 --> 00:48:01.747]  He hadn't been on in a while since he was on about a 2,000 mules that was excellent a couple years ago.
[00:48:03.223 --> 00:48:13.065]  He's putting out a police state movie, but it's like a live action deal, then cuts in and out with experts, kind of a mix of documentary slash live action.
[00:48:13.065 --> 00:48:15.825]  I've told the people that have seen it, it's powerful.
[00:48:15.825 --> 00:48:16.666]  It'll be in movie theaters.
[00:48:16.666 --> 00:48:17.986]  We should support it.
[00:48:17.986 --> 00:48:22.967]  And it shows how the deep state's targeting the loyal Americans.
[00:48:22.967 --> 00:48:29.568]  Now, I made four police state films starting in 1999, how they were gearing up, preparing for a war against the American people.
[00:48:30.476 --> 00:48:44.960]  And the globalists, the Clinton Foundation, the Obama-oids, they've been trying to call the military and police, get their people in, while training them via the ADL and others, that constitutional terrorists are the number one threat and they're going to have this big war with us.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.360]  Now how's that going to happen?
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.581]  Called false flags.
[00:48:48.581 --> 00:48:51.141]  Think of the governor kidnapping plot.
[00:48:51.141 --> 00:48:52.922]  They had three trials.
[00:48:52.922 --> 00:48:55.302]  People were found mistrial or not guilty in two of them.
[00:48:55.302 --> 00:48:57.823]  They were able to convict them in one of the trials.
[00:49:00.876 --> 00:49:08.038]  And literally, the Feds went and led an attempt at kidnapping that never happened.
[00:49:08.038 --> 00:49:25.443]  So, they are now officially, Homeland Security, is now officially saying its main mission is not China, it's not Russia, it's not the open border, it's not MS-13, it's not the human smuggling, hell, the government runs that now.
[00:49:25.443 --> 00:49:29.524]  They want to bring in kidnapped kids, drugged out of their minds, on fentanyl, that's okay.
[00:49:32.125 --> 00:49:35.166]  You miss a tax payment, they're going to take your house.
[00:49:35.166 --> 00:49:40.528]  Because we're seen as compliant schmucks.
[00:49:40.528 --> 00:49:49.772]  And now that very group says, no, we're just basically beginning outlawing the Trump presidency.
[00:49:49.772 --> 00:49:53.994]  They're trying to outlaw him running beyond election meddling.
[00:49:53.994 --> 00:49:57.115]  And they admit that's their plan to stop him from being able to run or win.
[00:49:57.115 --> 00:49:58.115]  He's still doing it.
[00:49:58.115 --> 00:50:00.436]  He's the man in the arena.
[00:50:00.436 --> 00:50:01.097]  More than any of us.
[00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:03.991]  I'm right there beside him.
[00:50:03.991 --> 00:50:04.831]  Right at the heart.
[00:50:04.831 --> 00:50:07.612]  So are you.
[00:50:07.612 --> 00:50:13.035]  But just sit back and let that sink in for a minute.
[00:50:13.035 --> 00:50:22.479]  That the main mission of Homeland Security is stopping imminent violence by Trump supporters.
[00:50:22.479 --> 00:50:28.241]  And all they've got is maybe one white supremacist attack a year not connected to Trump.
[00:50:28.241 --> 00:50:29.122]  The last few in any way.
[00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:57.401]  And January 6th that they set us up with and they've been caught red-handed and they admitted in Congress hundreds of federal agents in the crowd, almost a thousand of their rapid reaction teams in and around the buildings with weapons because they planned on getting some crazy Q people, that's what Q was telling them to do or whatever that thing was, to go in and actually arrest and grab and get Pelosi.
[00:50:57.401 --> 00:50:58.602]  We learned all that in hindsight.
[00:50:59.687 --> 00:51:03.532]  But they weren't able to provoke an attorney by doing anything really, really violent.
[00:51:03.532 --> 00:51:06.336]  Only citizens were killed that day.
[00:51:06.336 --> 00:51:11.063]  Three of them.
[00:51:11.063 --> 00:51:15.169]  And using that as the basis of this, they're trying to outlaw
[00:51:18.086 --> 00:51:19.887]  Trump voters, 80 plus million people.
[00:51:19.887 --> 00:51:22.689]  Now what's the next extension after that?
[00:51:22.689 --> 00:51:36.078]  False flags to legitimize it, to try to sell it, a tax blamed on us, and then outlawing the Republican Party, which Senator Josh Hawley said a few months ago, I probably played the clip ten times, because I said that's dead on.
[00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:38.931]  That's where this is going.
[00:51:38.931 --> 00:51:44.454]  And then once there's no Republican Party, the Democratic Party will be in factions and they'll be purging each other.
[00:51:44.454 --> 00:51:46.755]  That's how tyrannies work.
[00:51:46.755 --> 00:51:51.777]  100% of the time, they follow an exact pattern.
[00:51:51.777 --> 00:51:57.941]  That's why history repeats and it rhymes.
[00:51:57.941 --> 00:52:00.222]  It's a big deal.
[00:52:00.222 --> 00:52:04.684]  A very, very, very big deal.
[00:52:09.454 --> 00:52:13.237]  Guys, find that Senator Josh Hawley clip.
[00:52:13.237 --> 00:52:18.521]  It'll be, I think the headline's like, Senator Josh Hawley warns Democrats trying to create a one-party state.
[00:52:18.521 --> 00:52:20.583]  That was the headline I gave the video.
[00:52:20.583 --> 00:52:21.363]  So it'll be on Bandai.
[00:52:21.363 --> 00:52:22.464]  The video was on Infowars.com.
[00:52:22.464 --> 00:52:23.565]  I probably played it ten times.
[00:52:25.086 --> 00:52:26.947]  But it's so illustrative of what's happening.
[00:52:26.947 --> 00:52:34.450]  So they're establishing a permanent bureaucracy to have the illusion of a republic and the illusion of elections.
[00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:37.132]  But just like Venezuela, they will not be real elections.
[00:52:37.132 --> 00:52:38.392]  Stalin said, I don't care who votes.
[00:52:38.392 --> 00:52:41.514]  I care who counts the votes.
[00:52:41.514 --> 00:52:43.935]  Meanwhile, you know, they've put the gag order on Trump.
[00:52:45.117 --> 00:52:51.021]  Saying Letitia James is a fraud, the judge is a fraud, his clerk's best buddies and works with Schumer.
[00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:53.322]  Trump should be able to say that, it's true.
[00:52:53.322 --> 00:52:55.083]  The court is discredited.
[00:52:55.083 --> 00:53:00.607]  Letitia James running around saying, I'm running on getting elected, I'm gonna take everything he's got and put him in jail.
[00:53:00.607 --> 00:53:01.668]  We're gonna sue his ass.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.121]  All the legal experts agree.
[00:53:05.121 --> 00:53:06.302]  She should have been recused.
[00:53:06.302 --> 00:53:08.143]  These charges should never come.
[00:53:08.143 --> 00:53:09.784]  He paid the bank loans.
[00:53:09.784 --> 00:53:11.305]  His properties were worth what he said.
[00:53:11.305 --> 00:53:18.591]  Because you're projecting over the time of the 10-year or 20-year or 5-year note of what inflation is.
[00:53:18.591 --> 00:53:20.512]  And it turns out they're dead on.
[00:53:20.512 --> 00:53:22.213]  The banks certified it.
[00:53:22.213 --> 00:53:27.337]  The banks agreed with their assessment.
[00:53:27.337 --> 00:53:29.779]  Every time I've sold a house, we have our
[00:53:32.256 --> 00:53:42.025]  Assessment, we have our realtor expert come in and get the property assessed.
[00:53:42.025 --> 00:53:42.946]  What's the word you use?
[00:53:42.946 --> 00:53:44.968]  It just came to my mind.
[00:53:44.968 --> 00:53:46.329]  Appraisal.
[00:53:46.329 --> 00:53:48.932]  And then every time they go, we want our appraiser to come in.
[00:53:48.932 --> 00:53:51.594]  And it's usually about the same, maybe a little bigger, a little lower.
[00:53:51.594 --> 00:53:54.117]  The point is, is that everything Trump did was kosher.
[00:53:58.214 --> 00:53:59.054]  And they don't care.
[00:53:59.054 --> 00:54:01.035]  They're like, we're going to take everything you got.
[00:54:01.035 --> 00:54:03.496]  We're going to take your hotels, take your golf courses.
[00:54:03.496 --> 00:54:11.359]  And then it's some weird bozo crazy guy giggling and laughing and smiling for the cameras.
[00:54:11.359 --> 00:54:14.680]  And they think that's going to make us hate Trump.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:14.920]  Okay.
[00:54:18.339 --> 00:54:23.503]  Their attacks on us, what they've done to us, their debanking, has almost shut us down.
[00:54:23.503 --> 00:54:28.906]  But InfoWars has more street cred and is more influential than it ever was going through these attacks.
[00:54:28.906 --> 00:54:30.387]  And that's the moral of the story.
[00:54:30.387 --> 00:54:34.990]  We're going to go through these attacks together, every race, color, and creed.
[00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:41.495]  But if we're smart and can keep our heads about us, we're going to beat these people in the end, because they're on the wrong side of history, and that's just a fact.
[00:54:44.773 --> 00:54:50.819]  But they never give up, and nuclear war is their option to take out the Russians and us at the same time.
[00:54:50.819 --> 00:54:54.723]  Just like they want to have a civil war where we take out the federal government so they can bring in U.N.
[00:54:54.723 --> 00:55:00.028]  troops, and that's a real thing they're proposing, and take us out at the same time.
[00:55:00.028 --> 00:55:02.630]  The only way to win this game is not to play.
[00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:05.693]  Remember the War Games movie in the 1980s?
[00:55:05.693 --> 00:55:06.774]  What a strange game.
[00:55:07.677 --> 00:55:10.979]  The only way to win is not to play.
[00:55:10.979 --> 00:55:14.040]  I can do a lot of imitations of voices, but I can't do the robot voice.
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.822]  We gotta try to find just that part from the War Games trailer.
[00:55:16.822 --> 00:55:18.743]  A strange game.
[00:55:18.743 --> 00:55:21.784]  The only way to win is not to play.
[00:55:21.784 --> 00:55:23.005]  Sounds more like Marvin the Martian.
[00:55:23.005 --> 00:55:25.807]  I can't do a robot voice, sorry.
[00:55:25.807 --> 00:55:29.709]  Alright, we're gonna go to break, come back with Professor Epstein and do the deep dive.
[00:55:29.709 --> 00:55:32.710]  A lot of the current news ties into it.
[00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:35.732]  Then we'll continue on with a lot more news and information in the fourth hour.
[00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:40.038]  A lot on the Kevin McCarthy situation, the speakership and the rest of it.
[00:55:40.038 --> 00:55:41.903]  I want to thank all of you for your past support.
[00:55:41.903 --> 00:55:42.846]  You're the reason we're still here.
[00:55:43.848 --> 00:55:49.671]  If you want to see us be able to do a lot more on the ground and put a lot more reporters out there and do a lot of things, we're right on the cusp of doing that.
[00:55:49.671 --> 00:55:53.013]  But we need funding, so please go to InfoWars4.com.
[00:55:53.013 --> 00:55:56.634]  They've not taken down the sale, but it's going to be taken down sometime today.
[00:55:56.634 --> 00:56:01.717]  For Effective Sale, DNA Force Plus, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and Real Red Pill Plus, they're incredible.
[00:56:01.717 --> 00:56:05.259]  Individually, but even more powerful together, 40% off.
[00:56:05.259 --> 00:56:07.140]  Vitamin Refusion, back in stock.
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.241]  InfoWars Platinum, back in stock.
[00:56:09.241 --> 00:56:11.482]  The HGH Max Boost, incredible.
[00:56:12.342 --> 00:56:14.943]  7076 testosterone boost, amazing.
[00:56:14.943 --> 00:56:18.104]  Pain MD, very satisfying, works great.
[00:56:18.104 --> 00:56:27.506]  There are three private labeled product names that we have of already best-selling products in the United States that are certified and tested and loved.
[00:56:27.506 --> 00:56:31.507]  A lot of our products are original proprietary, souping up stuff that's already out there.
[00:56:31.507 --> 00:56:34.668]  But these are already number one best sellers, discounted.
[00:56:34.668 --> 00:56:35.408]  InfoWars Platinum.
[00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:36.913]  I don't
[00:56:57.447 --> 00:57:00.748]  Bring to like the eighth month and they give birth to the baby.
[00:57:00.748 --> 00:57:02.709]  They drain it of all its juices.
[00:57:02.709 --> 00:57:05.590]  Inject it into these globalists.
[00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:07.550]  That's just part of one chapter.
[00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:12.112]  I mean, it is unbelievably important.
[00:57:12.112 --> 00:57:13.492]  And it funds the operation.
[00:57:13.492 --> 00:57:14.333]  Get a signed copy.
[00:57:14.333 --> 00:57:15.173]  That's a fundraiser.
[00:57:15.173 --> 00:57:18.014]  I want to thank all you that have been getting the signed copy.
[00:57:18.014 --> 00:57:19.615]  That's going to be a limited amount.
[00:57:19.615 --> 00:57:20.775]  And of course, we have unsigned copies.
[00:57:20.775 --> 00:57:21.615]  They're in the warehouse.
[00:57:21.615 --> 00:57:23.216]  They're ready to ship.
[00:57:23.216 --> 00:57:24.936]  I'm going to start signing these babies tomorrow.
[00:57:24.936 --> 00:57:26.037]  And then they start shipping on the 20th.
[00:57:27.199 --> 00:57:29.521]  Which is about 14 days away.
[00:57:29.521 --> 00:57:35.685]  So get the Great Awakening by yours truly Alex Jones IV by Stephen K. Bannon at infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:35.685 --> 00:57:35.745]  888-253-3139.
[00:57:35.745 --> 00:57:38.707]  Hour number two is just two minutes away.
[00:57:38.707 --> 00:57:39.368]  Please stay with us.
[00:57:49.244 --> 00:57:53.306]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:57:53.306 --> 00:57:56.869]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:57:56.869 --> 00:58:01.972]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:58:01.972 --> 00:58:04.413]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:58:04.413 --> 00:58:13.018]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[00:58:13.018 --> 00:58:14.319]  This is the Great Awakening.
[00:58:14.839 --> 00:58:19.223]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:58:19.223 --> 00:58:23.006]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[00:58:23.006 --> 00:58:25.888]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[00:58:25.888 --> 00:58:30.612]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at infowarestore.com.

[00:58:42.721 --> 00:58:43.162]  Go now.

[00:58:46.503 --> 00:58:50.003]  The Great Awakening at InfoWarsTore.
[00:58:50.003 --> 00:58:53.104]  Have you tried taking the Real Red Pill?
[00:58:53.104 --> 00:58:59.145]  A one-of-a-kind heart and brain formula designed exclusively for InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:59.145 --> 00:59:04.046]  One of the most powerful ingredients in Real Red Pill Plus is pregnenolone.
[00:59:04.046 --> 00:59:11.968]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age, and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[00:59:12.188 --> 00:59:20.373]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium, copper, and zinc.
[00:59:20.373 --> 00:59:33.321]  Featuring naturally occurring L-theanine, caffeine, and theobromine, the energy blend inside the Real Red Pill Plus provides an extra pick-me-up for your day that goes beyond the second cup of coffee.
[00:59:33.621 --> 00:59:41.368]  So visit InfoWarsStore.com, go down the rabbit hole, and try taking the real red pill.
[00:59:41.368 --> 00:59:50.996]  Now 25% off for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:50.996 --> 00:59:56.901]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:06.847 --> 01:00:12.471]  Dinesh D'Souza's got his new police tape film set to be released in theaters very, very soon.
[01:00:12.471 --> 01:00:20.057]  And really, you could call it a nice addendum to my first four films that have now been proven deadly accurate.
[01:00:20.057 --> 01:00:33.586]  There's been a reassurgence of my films online as people watch the 24-year-old film right up to the last one I made 14 years ago.
[01:00:33.586 --> 01:00:35.448]  Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans
[01:00:37.205 --> 01:00:47.388]  Represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.
[01:00:47.388 --> 01:00:52.490]  Chief Division Counsel and DOJ have approved a no-knock breach.
[01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:59.652]  We want the subject to be on display doing the walk of shame, full visual impact.
[01:00:59.652 --> 01:01:00.952]  Any questions?
[01:01:00.952 --> 01:01:02.433]  Are we becoming a police state?
[01:01:04.036 --> 01:01:07.420]  Government told American citizens they couldn't go to church on Sunday.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.741]  I've never seen anything like it.
[01:01:08.741 --> 01:01:11.324]  It may be the Russia other people grew up in, but not my America.
[01:01:11.324 --> 01:01:12.085]  FBI warrant!
[01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:13.086]  Come to the door now!
[01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:15.268]  There's a heavy banging at my door.
[01:01:15.268 --> 01:01:16.429]  Open up!
[01:01:16.429 --> 01:01:18.752]  It's 15 marked units on my property.
[01:01:18.752 --> 01:01:21.074]  I got SWAT in the back of my house.
[01:01:21.074 --> 01:01:23.176]  It took a battering ram to my door.
[01:01:24.799 --> 01:01:25.500]  At 6 a.m.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.501]  I hear, boom, boom, boom.
[01:01:27.501 --> 01:01:32.044]  And hear about six to eight military-style soldiers.
[01:01:32.044 --> 01:01:35.867]  With the tallest one of them pointing an automatic rifle at my head.
[01:01:35.867 --> 01:01:36.147]  FBI!
[01:01:36.147 --> 01:01:37.568]  We have an arrest warrant!
[01:01:37.568 --> 01:01:45.193]  Shock you out of sleep, drag you out of your house, have clothes, refuse to give you a warrant, ransack your house.
[01:01:45.193 --> 01:01:47.875]  Now I'm facing 15 years in federal prison.
[01:01:47.875 --> 01:01:51.177]  For doing nothing other than exercising my right to free speech.
[01:01:51.477 --> 01:01:54.338]  I had no reason to be attacked.
[01:01:54.338 --> 01:02:00.059]  I hope that you remember Matt's name and the role you played in killing him.
[01:02:00.059 --> 01:02:01.920]  How did we give the state this kind of power?
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.940]  9-11 changed everything.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:09.062]  We're going to expand the Bureau from law enforcement to domestic intelligence.
[01:02:09.062 --> 01:02:10.502]  Legal shackles are now off.
[01:02:11.587 --> 01:02:13.828]  It used to be Islamic terrorism.
[01:02:13.828 --> 01:02:15.669]  That threat has kind of dissipated.
[01:02:15.669 --> 01:02:16.969]  Our focus is shifting.
[01:02:16.969 --> 01:02:19.250]  They're moving to domestic extremism.
[01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:22.011]  It really paints anybody who's right of center.
[01:02:22.011 --> 01:02:25.792]  What we need is a person to look at.
[01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:27.273]  And then we go find out what crime you did.
[01:02:27.273 --> 01:02:31.435]  If you're a pro-life, pro-family Catholic, they define you as radical.
[01:02:31.435 --> 01:02:34.956]  The demand for domestic terrorism vastly outstrips the supply.
[01:02:36.485 --> 01:02:41.750]  When candidate Trump came down the escalators, the government had a meltdown.
[01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:44.913]  We are going to drain the swamp.
[01:02:44.913 --> 01:02:46.314]  We'll see about that.
[01:02:46.314 --> 01:02:52.180]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.263]  The Patriot Act and FISA were used against Donald Trump.
[01:02:56.018 --> 01:03:02.523]  Google literally rewrote their news algorithm based upon what Trump was doing so they could get this guy.
[01:03:02.523 --> 01:03:05.886]  You just take out the word Russiagate and you put in COVID origins.
[01:03:05.886 --> 01:03:09.128]  You take out COVID origins and you put in Hunter Biden's laptop.
[01:03:09.128 --> 01:03:11.750]  You take that out and you put in January 6th.
[01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:15.694]  It's the replicated play from the deep state and their partners in the media.
[01:03:15.694 --> 01:03:18.015]  They're not just deplatforming you.
[01:03:18.015 --> 01:03:20.377]  They are trying to throw people in prison.
[01:03:20.377 --> 01:03:22.399]  If they're coming for me, they're coming for you.
[01:03:22.719 --> 01:03:23.540]  Hands on your head!
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.001]  These are anti-government.
[01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:28.144]  We have freedom of religion and freedom of speech!
[01:03:28.144 --> 01:03:32.909]  Violent extremists and they must be dealt with.
[01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:36.852]  We can do anything we want.
[01:03:36.852 --> 01:03:38.434]  Police State.
[01:03:38.434 --> 01:03:41.216]  Exclusively in theaters October 23rd and 25th.
[01:03:41.216 --> 01:03:43.178]  Tickets sold only on PoliceStateFilm.net
[01:03:46.007 --> 01:03:47.568]  This is reality.
[01:03:47.568 --> 01:03:50.130]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:52.192]  We know the government's planning terrorism.
[01:03:52.192 --> 01:03:54.754]  We know the Georgia's staff wanted to blow up airliners.
[01:03:54.754 --> 01:03:57.956]  If you do it, we're going to blame you, because we know who's up to it.
[01:03:57.956 --> 01:04:01.959]  The truth is out there in front of you, but they lay out this buffet of lies.
[01:04:01.959 --> 01:04:04.741]  I'm sick of it, and I'm not going to take a bite out of it.
[01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:05.702]  Do you got me?
[01:04:05.702 --> 01:04:07.783]  It's time to stop submitting to this parody.
[01:04:07.783 --> 01:04:09.945]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved.
[01:04:10.885 --> 01:04:11.785]  I want freedom!
[01:04:11.785 --> 01:04:12.626]  That's what I want!
[01:04:12.626 --> 01:04:13.906]  And that's what you should want!
[01:04:13.906 --> 01:04:14.886]  I'm here to warn people!
[01:04:14.886 --> 01:04:16.447]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[01:04:16.447 --> 01:04:17.327]  This isn't a game!
[01:04:17.327 --> 01:04:21.548]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:04:21.548 --> 01:04:24.169]  If you want them, come and take them!
[01:04:24.169 --> 01:04:28.270]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:32.191]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[01:04:50.285 --> 01:04:54.989]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:04:54.989 --> 01:04:59.954]  We'll be back.
[01:04:59.954 --> 01:05:03.177]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[01:05:04.471 --> 01:05:09.652]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[01:05:09.652 --> 01:05:13.113]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[01:05:13.113 --> 01:05:14.174]  Well, I know where you are.
[01:05:14.174 --> 01:05:18.655]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[01:05:18.655 --> 01:05:25.257]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[01:05:25.257 --> 01:05:26.437]  And a key tool in that fight
[01:05:27.037 --> 01:05:32.261]  This is The Great Awakening, defeating the Globalists and launching the next Great Renaissance.
[01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:35.903]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.
[01:05:35.903 --> 01:05:39.546]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book.
[01:05:39.546 --> 01:05:43.929]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to send us a number one right now.
[01:05:43.929 --> 01:05:47.911]  This is a cultural fight against the Globalists and it funds the InfoWar.
[01:05:47.911 --> 01:05:51.454]  Get signed or unsigned copies of The Great Awakening right now.
[01:05:51.894 --> 01:05:54.297]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening right now!
[01:06:00.796 --> 01:06:07.157]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:07.157 --> 01:06:11.478]  Alright, Dr. Robert Epstein.
[01:06:23.157 --> 01:06:34.509]  One of the leading experts on election fraud is going to be joining us, but the power went off in his house minutes before he was scheduled to be joining us.
[01:06:34.509 --> 01:06:37.352]  And I was into a deep dive here for two hours with him.
[01:06:38.775 --> 01:06:48.737]  And so I'm going to work on that, or see what we can do here, because he's in his car, but I don't want to do two hours from his car.
[01:06:48.737 --> 01:06:51.737]  It was great technology we have here, but we're also dependent on power.
[01:06:51.737 --> 01:06:57.198]  I was talking last hour, what happens to the globe, let's turn our power off, what that could do.
[01:06:57.198 --> 01:06:59.519]  While we figure out exactly what we're going to do, I wanted to play this clip.
[01:06:59.519 --> 01:07:06.000]  Regardless, here's Dr. Robert Epstein on Life Liberty, and Levin explains how he
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:11.862]  Monitor the 2016 election search results, and then he warned what would happen in 2020.
[01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:14.243]  2022, he's got a new big report out.
[01:07:14.243 --> 01:07:19.446]  Google's triple threat to democracy, our children and our minds.
[01:07:19.446 --> 01:07:22.747]  American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology.
[01:07:22.747 --> 01:07:23.727]  He's got a lengthy bio.
[01:07:23.727 --> 01:07:29.230]  We're going to play this clip and then come back with him here in just a few minutes.
[01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.510]  Here we go.
[01:07:30.686 --> 01:07:32.748]  I am indeed Dr. Robert Epstein.
[01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:37.732]  The most important thing for you to know about me is that I'm the father of five wonderful children.
[01:07:37.732 --> 01:07:44.217]  As it happens, I'm also a research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology.
[01:07:44.217 --> 01:07:48.980]  I have been center-center-left my whole adult life.
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:56.426]  But I value my country and democracy more than I value any party or candidate.
[01:07:56.426 --> 01:07:58.127]  That is why I'm speaking out today.
[01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:16.184]  I'm here to explain why Google poses a serious threat to democracy, how monitoring systems can protect us from companies like Google, and how Congress can immediately end Google's worldwide monopoly on search.
[01:08:16.184 --> 01:08:20.825]  My plan for ending that monopoly was published just yesterday in Businessweek.
[01:08:20.825 --> 01:08:24.965]  I respectfully request that my article be entered into the Congressional Record.
[01:08:24.965 --> 01:08:27.686]  It's attached to my full testimony.
[01:08:27.686 --> 01:08:28.906]  It will be entered without objection.
[01:08:30.751 --> 01:08:33.533]  I've been a research psychologist for nearly 40 years.
[01:08:33.533 --> 01:08:39.837]  My PhD is from Harvard, and since 1981 I've published extensively on AI and other topics.
[01:08:39.837 --> 01:08:51.024]  Some of my research has focused on Google, on the company's massive surveillance operations, censorship capabilities, and unprecedented ability to manipulate the thinking of 2.5
[01:08:52.765 --> 01:08:56.668]  Billion people soon to be four plus billion.
[01:08:56.668 --> 01:09:08.215]  I've written articles about Google for Time Magazine, USA Today, that kind of thing, but also for The Daily Caller and even Russia's Sputnik News.
[01:09:08.215 --> 01:09:17.762]  I reach out to diverse audiences because I believe the threats posed by Google, and to a lesser extent Facebook, are so serious that everyone needs to know about them.
[01:09:18.649 --> 01:09:25.837]  Here are just three disturbing findings from my research which adheres to the very highest standards of scientific integrity.
[01:09:25.837 --> 01:09:26.958]  Number one.
[01:09:26.958 --> 01:09:39.012]  In 2016, Google's search algorithm likely impacted undecided voters in a way that shifted at least 2.6 million votes to Hillary Clinton, whom I supported.
[01:09:39.953 --> 01:09:54.758]  I know this because I preserved more than 13,000 election-related searches prior to Election Day, and Google's search results were significantly biased in favor of Secretary Clinton.
[01:09:54.758 --> 01:10:02.640]  I know the number of votes that shifted because I've conducted dozens of controlled experiments that measure how opinions shift
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.862]  when search results are biased.
[01:10:05.862 --> 01:10:15.549]  I call this shift SEAM, the search engine manipulation effect, which I first published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2015.
[01:10:15.549 --> 01:10:22.074]  Biased search results can easily produce shifts in the opinions and voting preferences of undecided voters
[01:10:22.754 --> 01:10:34.882]  by up to 80% in some demographic groups because people blindly trust high-ranking search results over lower ones.
[01:10:34.882 --> 01:10:40.566]  Seem is an especially dangerous form of influence because it is, in effect, subliminal.
[01:10:40.566 --> 01:10:43.868]  It also leaves no paper trail for authorities to trace.
[01:10:43.868 --> 01:10:48.031]  It's an example of a short-lived or, quote, ephemeral experience.
[01:10:48.031 --> 01:10:52.274]  That's a phrase you'll find in internal emails that have leaked recently from Google.
[01:10:53.435 --> 01:11:05.705]  I'm now studying seven such manipulations, like Seem, and unlike billboards or those Russian-placed ads, these manipulations are invisible and non-competitive.
[01:11:05.705 --> 01:11:11.090]  They're controlled entirely by big tech companies and there is no way to counteract them.
[01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:28.842]  Number two, on Election Day in 2018, the Go Vote reminder that Google displayed on its homepage gave one political party at least 800,000 more votes than it gave the other party.
[01:11:28.842 --> 01:11:33.425]  That reminder was not a public service, it was a vote manipulation.
[01:11:34.847 --> 01:11:51.844]  Number three, in the weeks leading up to the 2018 election, bias in Google search results may have shifted upwards of 78.2 million votes spread across many races to the candidates of one political party.
[01:11:52.865 --> 01:12:05.072]  This number is based on bias in data captured by my 2018 monitoring system which preserved more than 47,000 election-related searches conducted by a diverse group of American voters.
[01:12:06.576 --> 01:12:15.323]  I know how to stop big tech in its tracks, and that brings me briefly here to monitoring systems and the proposal I published yesterday.
[01:12:15.323 --> 01:12:25.771]  A 2015 phone call from the Attorney General of Mississippi prompted me to start a years-long project in which I have learned how to capture online ephemeral experiences.
[01:12:26.571 --> 01:12:35.877]  In early 2016, I deployed a system that allowed my team to look over people's shoulders as they conducted online searches, with their permission.
[01:12:35.877 --> 01:12:55.971]  I deployed a more sophisticated system in 2018, and I'm raising funds now to build a much more comprehensive system in 2020, one that will allow us to catch big tech in the act, to instantly spot when Facebook is biasing news feeds, or when Twitter is suppressing tweets sent by Ann Coulter or Elizabeth Warren.
[01:12:57.492 --> 01:13:02.075]  This system must be built to keep an eye on Big Tech in 2020.
[01:13:02.075 --> 01:13:13.062]  If these companies all support the same candidate, they will have the power to shift 15 million votes to that candidate.
[01:13:13.062 --> 01:13:21.247]  To let Big Tech get away with subliminal manipulation on this scale would be to make the free and fair election meaningless.
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:39.989]  Finally, regarding yesterday's article, Congress can quickly end Google's worldwide monopoly on search by declaring Google's massive search index, the database the company uses to generate search results, to be a public commons, accessible by all.
[01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:47.634]  Just as a 1956 consent decree forced AT&T to share all its patents.
[01:13:47.634 --> 01:13:59.261]  There is precedent in both law and Google's business practices to justify taking this step, which will make online search competitive again and dramatically diminish Google's power worldwide.
[01:13:59.261 --> 01:13:59.341]  In 1961,
[01:14:00.942 --> 01:14:08.687]  Eisenhower warned about the possible rise of a technological elite that would control public policy without people's awareness.
[01:14:08.687 --> 01:14:15.951]  That elite now exists and you must determine where we go from here.
[01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:21.494]  Chairman Cruz, Ranking Member Hirono, Mrs. Blackburn, other members of the committee,
[01:14:22.987 --> 01:14:29.811]  Democracy as originally conceived cannot survive big tech as currently empowered.
[01:14:29.811 --> 01:14:30.991]  I look forward to your questions.
[01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:36.191]  That was seven years ago.
[01:14:36.191 --> 01:14:37.452]  I got a bunch of clips of him.
[01:14:37.452 --> 01:14:38.974]  I remember playing at the time.
[01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:41.176]  I remember being blessed enough to get him on the show.
[01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:47.341]  His power went out of his house, so he's doing it from his car, but he's ready and ready to go here in the next hour and a half.
[01:14:47.341 --> 01:14:48.643]  We're gonna have him with us.
[01:14:48.643 --> 01:14:51.065]  Really appreciate him and his work.
[01:14:51.065 --> 01:14:55.269]  He has undoubtedly been, hands down, the most on target
[01:14:56.397 --> 01:14:57.077]  Thank you for having me.
[01:15:16.843 --> 01:15:18.985]  People are way more educated on this now.
[01:15:18.985 --> 01:15:27.573]  You were a voice in the wilderness back then, so was I. You've now got your latest report, Google's Triple Threat to Democracy, Our Children and Our Minds.
[01:15:27.573 --> 01:15:30.917]  Again, Professor Dr. Robert Epstein is our guest.
[01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:34.142]  All right.
[01:15:52.857 --> 01:16:00.463]  Doctor, to see now an accelerated growth curve, almost parabolic, and people finally starting to understand this.
[01:16:00.463 --> 01:16:07.069]  So tell me a little bit about yourself, and then I'd like to go through the hindsight of what we've already witnessed, and then all the big new developments you've got.
[01:16:07.069 --> 01:16:13.614]  Because as you've said, they're already stealing the 2024 election before the voting starts in a lot of different ways.
[01:16:13.614 --> 01:16:19.899]  Not just trying to preclude Trump from running all these charges, but also delisting and blocking other candidates, not just presidential.
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:21.900]  It's my pleasure.
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:22.681]  You know, I am stuck in my car here.
[01:16:22.681 --> 01:16:27.863]  It's probably just a coincidence, but a few minutes before we were supposed to connect, the power went off in the building where I normally do my work.
[01:16:49.023 --> 01:16:51.024]  You know, there are lots of coincidences.
[01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:57.105]  So let me just give you another one, which is unfortunately very close to my heart.
[01:16:57.105 --> 01:17:04.667]  And that same summer that I testified, President Trump tweeted about my testimony.
[01:17:04.667 --> 01:17:11.308]  Hillary Clinton replied by saying my work had been completely debunked.
[01:17:12.686 --> 01:17:15.927]  And was based on data from 21 undecided voters.
[01:17:15.927 --> 01:17:18.287]  I still have no idea where that came from.
[01:17:18.287 --> 01:17:20.948]  I got cut off from mainstream media.
[01:17:20.948 --> 01:17:27.550]  That same summer, I did a private briefing for a group of attorneys general from around the country.
[01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:38.613]  In fact, that group was headed by Ken Paxton, who's been in the news recently because he was just acquitted of some charges brought against him, but he's still Attorney General of Texas.
[01:17:38.613 --> 01:17:39.753]  I gave my briefing.
[01:17:40.652 --> 01:17:43.814]  I shared my data with this group of AGs.
[01:17:43.814 --> 01:18:00.865]  I went out into the hall, and a little while later, one of the AGs came out and said, Dr. Epstein, I don't mean to scare you, but based on what you've told us, I think you're likely to die in some sort of accident in the next few months.
[01:18:00.865 --> 01:18:02.566]  Now, I'm still here.
[01:18:02.566 --> 01:18:07.790]  Obviously, I didn't die in the next few months in some sort of accident, but my wife did.
[01:18:10.376 --> 01:18:15.261]  And I still have not recovered from that.
[01:18:15.261 --> 01:18:25.092]  So they say, you know, if you're in an airplane and you're being hit by flak, that's a good thing because that means you're over the target.
[01:18:25.092 --> 01:18:29.557]  I think I'm definitely over the target because we have made tremendous progress
[01:18:30.694 --> 01:18:33.598]  Since I gave that testimony.
[01:18:33.598 --> 01:18:35.421]  Let's be 100% clear.
[01:18:35.421 --> 01:18:39.907]  Like prophecy, it's now admitted congressional testimony just last few months.
[01:18:39.907 --> 01:18:43.833]  In the documents, everything you said came true exactly as you said.
[01:18:47.071 --> 01:18:48.031]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:18:48.031 --> 01:18:56.974]  In fact, we've gotten better and better at monitoring these companies and there have been a lot of leaks from the companies since then, especially from Google.
[01:18:56.974 --> 01:19:07.618]  So everything I said has been confirmed by leaks from the company and has been confirmed by massive amounts of data that we have collected showing real data.
[01:19:08.883 --> 01:19:14.885]  Real data that this company is sending to real voters and now to real kids.
[01:19:14.885 --> 01:19:18.907]  We're actually capturing data going to the device that children are using.
[01:19:18.907 --> 01:19:23.669]  So we're concerned about them undermining democracy.
[01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:26.930]  We're concerned about them indoctrinating our children.
[01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:35.394]  And we are now building a nationwide system which we hope will be permanent and that it will stop these companies
[01:19:36.428 --> 01:19:37.669]  We're good to go.
[01:20:01.192 --> 01:20:06.037]  I think his Skype froze up, so we're doing our best here.
[01:20:06.037 --> 01:20:12.683]  Maybe we should fly him here to get him on the show to make sure that happens, because this is very, very important.
[01:20:12.683 --> 01:20:15.886]  As soon as we get him reconnected, we will talk to him.
[01:20:16.954 --> 01:20:19.376]  And by the way, folks, this is not a conspiracy.
[01:20:19.376 --> 01:20:21.117]  This is the technocracy.
[01:20:21.117 --> 01:20:22.758]  Maybe the power is out where he's at.
[01:20:22.758 --> 01:20:23.579]  There isn't a storm.
[01:20:23.579 --> 01:20:24.259]  It's a clear sky.
[01:20:24.259 --> 01:20:25.580]  I can see that.
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:28.982]  Maybe it's just a coincidence the office building he works in has the power off.
[01:20:28.982 --> 01:20:36.688]  We had to put in a giant $100,000 generator and everything hooked up to it was $100,000 more to run this whole complex.
[01:20:36.688 --> 01:20:39.690]  Because other people's power wasn't getting turned off.
[01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:40.510]  Ours was.
[01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:42.572]  You know, the bill was paid.
[01:20:42.572 --> 01:20:43.632]  All the time.
[01:20:43.632 --> 01:20:44.153]  So we put it in.
[01:20:45.285 --> 01:20:47.866]  And now when that happens, it just kicks back on.
[01:20:47.866 --> 01:20:52.529]  So they're using the cutting off of energy and the technocracy for total control.
[01:20:52.529 --> 01:20:57.751]  And believe me, they're major pissed about his testimony to Congress, the Attorney General's and others.
[01:20:57.751 --> 01:21:06.636]  So if he's unable to do the interview today, don't worry, I got plenty other news and information here to break down and take your calls.
[01:21:06.636 --> 01:21:13.839]  But one way or another, we're going to be beating this drum 13 months out exactly today from the 2024 elections because
[01:21:16.806 --> 01:21:18.447]  They're trying to keep Trump from being able to run.
[01:21:18.447 --> 01:21:19.048]  They admit it.
[01:21:19.048 --> 01:21:21.890]  Biden says we're going to keep him from running by indicting him.
[01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:23.110]  Leticia James brags about it.
[01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:25.812]  I mean, these criminals just brag.
[01:21:25.812 --> 01:21:30.456]  And then they're running around trying to bring back mail-in ballots again for the general public.
[01:21:30.456 --> 01:21:34.518]  And they're censoring more than ever, except on X. It's still censoring too.
[01:21:34.518 --> 01:21:38.101]  X got really good for a few months, and now I've seen it coming back.
[01:21:38.101 --> 01:21:42.404]  So this is a real tug of war.
[01:21:42.404 --> 01:21:43.365]  This is a real battle.
[01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:45.286]  You know, I meant to get to this clip, and I didn't.
[01:21:46.775 --> 01:21:54.839]  So let's play the shorter clip that I was talking about with him, Life, Liberty, and Levin breaking down more.
[01:21:54.839 --> 01:22:00.682]  I've got his newest clips, but this is really important because this is seven years ago with his predictions and warnings.
[01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:02.143]  Here it is.
[01:22:02.143 --> 01:22:03.243]  What happened in 2016?
[01:22:03.243 --> 01:22:04.564]  The presidential election.
[01:22:05.214 --> 01:22:17.442]  In 2016, I set up the first ever monitoring system that allowed me to look over the shoulders of a diverse group of American voters.
[01:22:17.442 --> 01:22:18.482]  There were 95 people in 24 states.
[01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.829]  Okay.
[01:22:39.682 --> 01:23:03.258]  Bias in Google search results, not Bing or Yahoo, just Google's, favoring Hillary Clinton, whom I supported strongly, but the point is I reported that, I reported what I found, and that level of bias was sufficient, I calculated, to have shifted over time somewhere between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes
[01:23:09.302 --> 01:23:15.104]  And so how does that get accomplished?
[01:23:15.104 --> 01:23:31.150]  These algorithms that are changed and adjusted and so forth, but to have that significant of an impact, obviously someone or something wants someone to win and someone to lose.
[01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:34.572]  For the person who goes on Google, how is that manifested?
[01:23:35.725 --> 01:23:50.473]  Well, if you go on to Google and you type in anything that's election-related, and that could be hundreds of things, you type in immigration or you type in the wall or, you know, you think of all the things that are related to elections.
[01:23:50.473 --> 01:23:55.856]  The point is you end up with some search suggestions that are flashed at you as you're typing.
[01:23:55.856 --> 01:23:58.098]  We now know that those search suggestions
[01:23:58.638 --> 01:24:07.362]  Have a very, very powerful effect on people and that they alone can shift opinions and votes dramatically.
[01:24:07.362 --> 01:24:10.743]  And then search results appear below.
[01:24:10.743 --> 01:24:24.869]  And the point is, if there's a bias in them, which means if a search result that's high up on the list, if that takes you to a web page that makes one candidate look better than another, well, if you're undecided
[01:24:25.848 --> 01:24:27.868]  And you're trying to make up your mind.
[01:24:27.868 --> 01:24:45.172]  What we've learned is that information posted high in Google search results will shift opinions among undecided people dramatically because people trust Google and they especially trust high ranking search results.
[01:24:45.172 --> 01:24:48.013]  That's why 50 percent of all clicks go to the top two items.
[01:24:48.013 --> 01:24:50.253]  Is that what Google did?
[01:24:52.113 --> 01:24:56.755]  Well, again, I can't say what Google did, but I can tell you what we found.
[01:24:56.755 --> 01:25:11.022]  We found a very dramatic pro-Hillary Clinton bias on Google, but not the other search engines, and in all ten search positions on the first page of search results.
[01:25:11.022 --> 01:25:13.663]  That's quite dramatic.
[01:25:13.663 --> 01:25:16.145]  And now, Professor Epstein, it looks like it's intensified.
[01:25:17.492 --> 01:25:19.714]  We're doing this because the power is out in your car.
[01:25:19.714 --> 01:25:20.354]  That's fine.
[01:25:20.354 --> 01:25:22.956]  Hopefully you can get back to your house if it keeps having problems.
[01:25:22.956 --> 01:25:25.077]  But I want to get to your new findings.
[01:25:25.077 --> 01:25:25.758]  I read your report.
[01:25:25.758 --> 01:25:26.819]  It's incredible.
[01:25:26.819 --> 01:25:29.280]  Much worse than what was going on previously.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:35.465]  They've been caught, so it seems they're intensifying because Congress has not yet, or the courts have not yet held them accountable.
[01:25:35.465 --> 01:25:36.866]  Though federal courts, as you know today,
[01:25:37.426 --> 01:25:44.330]  Fifth Circuit officially certified the lower courts and said, this is election meddling, it's illegal, stop the surveillance, stop the censorship.
[01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:46.130]  So total vindication for you on that front.
[01:25:46.130 --> 01:25:47.311]  But we've got a few minutes to break.
[01:25:47.311 --> 01:25:55.555]  For people who don't know your prestigious background, give people your curricula vitae.
[01:25:55.555 --> 01:25:58.177]  My PhD is from Harvard University.
[01:25:58.177 --> 01:26:06.541]  I've published 15 books and more than 300 articles, many of them in some of the top scientific journals in the world.
[01:26:07.569 --> 01:26:11.791]  I was editor-in-chief of Psychology Today magazine for about four years.
[01:26:11.791 --> 01:26:17.254]  I was an editor for Scientific American for a long time, a professor for many years.
[01:26:17.254 --> 01:26:20.215]  These days I focus exclusively on research.
[01:26:20.215 --> 01:26:26.378]  I'm directing 31 different research projects, and a lot of those have to do with new forms
[01:26:27.074 --> 01:26:38.284]  of manipulation that the internet has made possible, and the more we learn, and we just had another discovery last week, the more we learn, the more concerned we are.
[01:26:38.284 --> 01:26:43.209]  We are way past a brave new world or 1994.
[01:26:43.209 --> 01:26:49.535]  You have no idea, you have no idea the extent to which our elections, our minds, our kids,
[01:26:50.373 --> 01:26:52.815]  All right, we've got a few minutes to break.
[01:26:52.815 --> 01:26:55.957]  As long as your phone holds, I think we've got a big report out.
[01:26:55.957 --> 01:27:00.460]  Give us a little prelude when you go to break and come back, your latest developments, what you've discovered.
[01:27:16.738 --> 01:27:22.981]  Well, what we've been doing lately is setting up a nationwide monitoring system.
[01:27:22.981 --> 01:27:24.682]  We call it our Digital Shield.
[01:27:24.682 --> 01:27:30.904]  If you go to AmericasDigitalShield.com, you'll get a glimpse of what's coming and what we're building.
[01:27:30.904 --> 01:27:33.365]  And we now have more than 11,800 field agents in all 50 states.
[01:27:37.745 --> 01:27:39.406]  They're all registered voters.
[01:27:39.406 --> 01:27:44.250]  In some cases, we've also recruited other kids with parents' permission.
[01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:47.353]  And we are doing to these companies what they are doing to us.
[01:27:47.353 --> 01:27:54.959]  We are surveilling them 24 hours a day, looking at real content that they're sending to real voters and real kids.
[01:27:54.959 --> 01:27:57.981]  And what we're finding is extremely disturbing.
[01:27:57.981 --> 01:27:59.943]  We're finding bias.
[01:27:59.943 --> 01:28:02.044]  We're finding evidence of manipulation.
[01:28:02.044 --> 01:28:03.966]  We're finding evidence of indoctrination.
[01:28:04.566 --> 01:28:15.114]  And instead of all this information being lost, as it usually is, and these companies count on that, we're capturing it, we're preserving it, we're archiving it, we're analyzing it.
[01:28:15.114 --> 01:28:22.160]  This is the way to beat them, is to make them accountable to the public, is to shine a light on what they're doing.
[01:28:23.476 --> 01:28:28.860]  They never expected that anyone would capture all of this content, which they call ephemeral.
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:34.665]  They never thought so, that this is the temporary stuff that disappears and that's not stored anywhere.
[01:28:34.665 --> 01:28:36.867]  We've figured out how to capture it.
[01:28:36.867 --> 01:28:38.448]  That's how you stop them.
[01:28:38.448 --> 01:28:39.689]  You make them accountable.
[01:28:40.891 --> 01:28:44.375]  We'll never stop them with laws and regulations.
[01:28:44.375 --> 01:28:50.401]  Our government is dysfunctional for one thing, but the fact is laws and regulations also move too slowly.
[01:28:50.401 --> 01:28:52.824]  Tech can always work around them.
[01:28:52.824 --> 01:28:53.985]  Dr. Einstein, stay there.
[01:28:53.985 --> 01:28:54.706]  I totally agree.
[01:28:54.706 --> 01:28:55.507]  Back in just a few minutes.
[01:28:55.507 --> 01:28:56.048]  Stay there, sir.
[01:28:58.493 --> 01:29:02.516]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:29:02.516 --> 01:29:06.078]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[01:29:06.078 --> 01:29:11.182]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[01:29:11.182 --> 01:29:13.624]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:29:13.624 --> 01:29:22.230]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[01:29:22.230 --> 01:29:23.551]  This is the Great Awakening.
[01:29:24.071 --> 01:29:28.436]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:29:28.436 --> 01:29:35.104]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller and this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:08.270]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:11.732]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[01:30:11.732 --> 01:30:12.793]  Well, I know where you are.

[01:30:30.885 --> 01:30:34.528]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:30:34.528 --> 01:30:39.072]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book, and just like the last book,
[01:30:39.352 --> 01:30:39.612]  We're good.
[01:30:58.433 --> 01:31:02.956]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has finally returned!

[01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:15.250]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:18.231]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:32:18.231 --> 01:32:19.851]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[01:32:19.851 --> 01:32:24.773]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[01:32:24.773 --> 01:32:26.493]  This is something you need now.
[01:32:26.493 --> 01:32:31.074]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.

[01:33:17.652 --> 01:33:27.598]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.598 --> 01:33:31.321]  Dr. Epstein is having medical issues, so he'll be trying to reconnect with us.
[01:33:31.321 --> 01:33:33.082]  Well, we're going to get this done one way or another.
[01:33:33.082 --> 01:33:34.182]  He's got big developments.
[01:33:34.182 --> 01:33:36.244]  I've read the report.
[01:33:36.244 --> 01:33:39.606]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and this vital information to the future of the republic
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.461]  Is not going to get out there without your support, your word of mouth, and your prayer.
[01:33:44.461 --> 01:33:46.802]  And so I want to thank the listeners and viewers for your support.
[01:33:46.802 --> 01:33:59.385]  I want to encourage you now more than ever to share this live link and once it's archived, demand on video today that you share it because the theft of the 2024 election is happening now warns Dr.
[01:34:00.945 --> 01:34:01.905]  Epstein.
[01:34:01.905 --> 01:34:03.466]  That's basically your headline.
[01:34:03.466 --> 01:34:05.226]  And they're doing it in front of everybody.
[01:34:05.226 --> 01:34:06.447]  There's a whole bunch of ways to do it.
[01:34:06.447 --> 01:34:08.867]  They don't just do it on election day.
[01:34:08.867 --> 01:34:10.188]  And this has all come out now.
[01:34:10.188 --> 01:34:12.708]  It's all been proven.
[01:34:12.708 --> 01:34:18.110]  And you look at... The next Assistant State Police movie coming out in a few weeks.
[01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:20.231]  And the trailer's out.
[01:34:20.231 --> 01:34:26.052]  And it's all about how now they're going to declare Trump supporters terrorists.
[01:34:26.052 --> 01:34:28.673]  And then yesterday, a huge report comes out.
[01:34:30.967 --> 01:34:41.355]  That the FBI has been told that all Trump supporters are being put in a terrorist database, 80 plus million people, for a coming civil war.
[01:34:41.355 --> 01:34:43.316]  They talk about a civil war.
[01:34:43.316 --> 01:34:47.099]  The FBI says that we don't think this is a good idea, this is crazy.
[01:34:47.099 --> 01:34:49.601]  Uh, yeah.
[01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:54.164]  But don't think for a minute the technocrats don't know this will tear the country apart.
[01:34:54.164 --> 01:34:58.508]  The FBI's like, even if we're corrupt and evil, and I'm not saying they all are, but a bunch of them at the top are,
[01:34:59.594 --> 01:35:04.857]  There's certainly a bunch of yes-men and mercenaries from the middle up.
[01:35:04.857 --> 01:35:05.998]  They've taken over all the other agents.
[01:35:05.998 --> 01:35:18.586]  Look how the Border Patrol is completing the smuggling process and letting drug kids on fentanyl come across, totally passed out babies, kids dying every day from it, coming across the border drugged out of their minds by the smugglers.
[01:35:18.586 --> 01:35:20.547]  Am I saying the Border Patrol agents are all bad men and women?
[01:35:20.547 --> 01:35:25.070]  No, but they're being given illegal orders and they're following them.
[01:35:26.903 --> 01:35:27.903]  Where are the federal courts?
[01:35:27.903 --> 01:35:28.924]  Where's Congress?
[01:35:28.924 --> 01:35:31.004]  Where are we?
[01:35:31.004 --> 01:35:32.225]  We're doing our best to cover it.
[01:35:32.225 --> 01:35:34.205]  We're doing our best to go to the border.
[01:35:34.205 --> 01:35:39.067]  Let's show a few of these videos that are just out today on the border itself with audio.
[01:35:39.067 --> 01:35:40.807]  We showed the B-roll earlier.
[01:35:40.807 --> 01:35:41.747]  Roll this with audio.
[01:35:41.747 --> 01:35:46.669]  This is last night in Texas.
[01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:47.269]  Yeah, go ahead and play it.
[01:36:00.768 --> 01:36:10.652]  That's thousands and thousands of people just running across the border, yelling and screaming like they're an invading army, brought up by the UN, brought up by the WEF.
[01:36:10.652 --> 01:36:20.936]  And I have clip after clip after clip just today of this happening.
[01:36:20.936 --> 01:36:23.698]  Of this unfolding.
[01:36:23.698 --> 01:36:29.020]  And now they're closing high school and middle school gymnasiums all over the country to house these people.
[01:36:30.393 --> 01:36:37.855]  And we've got enraged citizens saying you've got to stop this.
[01:36:37.855 --> 01:36:43.537]  But it's also happening in Europe with the very same UN NGOs running the operation.
[01:36:43.537 --> 01:36:44.757]  Play clip 19.
[01:36:44.757 --> 01:36:51.719]  This is all male migrants flooding into Spain yesterday from Africa.
[01:36:54.785 --> 01:36:56.987]  Fuck you Morocco!
[01:36:56.987 --> 01:36:58.949]  Fuck you Africa!
[01:36:58.949 --> 01:37:01.731]  You are going to die!
[01:37:22.287 --> 01:37:28.451]  So if you remember, four years ago, Jon Stewart made fun of Trump supporters and said, they claim there's an invasion.
[01:37:28.451 --> 01:37:29.812]  They claim everything's collapsing.
[01:37:29.812 --> 01:37:36.096]  They claim, meanwhile now, the same Democrats that said, come here are saying, no, no, don't come to blue cities.
[01:37:36.096 --> 01:37:49.445]  And Biden is set, it was announced last week, to sign an executive order, which is totally illegal, to order the illegal aliens to stay in Arizona and Texas, where they'll then be given driver's license and they'll try to set them up to vote.
[01:37:52.378 --> 01:38:01.362]  So the system knows exactly what they're doing.
[01:38:01.362 --> 01:38:10.026]  This is all part of a major takeover plan.
[01:38:10.026 --> 01:38:16.609]  And then the man who is 60% of the field against all the other 10 Republican candidates,
[01:38:18.874 --> 01:38:27.239]  Has been indicted four times, 91 felony charges, and they're saying he can't say it's a fraud, and they're trying to gag him.
[01:38:27.239 --> 01:38:28.539]  They say they have gagged him.
[01:38:28.539 --> 01:38:31.041]  They're going to put him in jail.
[01:38:31.041 --> 01:38:33.302]  All right.
[01:38:33.302 --> 01:38:41.887]  Professor Robert Epstein, you've got your big report, Google's triple threat to democracy, our children, and our minds.
[01:38:41.887 --> 01:38:43.288]  You've been a big Democrat, but you're a
[01:38:44.164 --> 01:38:45.065]  You're a moral guy.
[01:38:45.065 --> 01:38:46.226]  You're an expert in this.
[01:38:46.226 --> 01:38:49.809]  You exposed it in Congress six, seven years ago and ongoing.
[01:38:49.809 --> 01:38:52.351]  You've been through a lot of persecution.
[01:38:52.351 --> 01:38:55.754]  Since then, you've got attorney generals to take action.
[01:38:55.754 --> 01:38:59.338]  You advise them publicly and privately, as you said.
[01:38:59.338 --> 01:39:09.247]  And you were saying that there is a massive outreach by big tech through the state, telling them what to say and do to not just steal elections or influence elections, but to also
[01:39:10.575 --> 01:39:11.456]  Manipulate the youth.
[01:39:11.456 --> 01:39:17.701]  So, get into the main findings of your latest information.
[01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:30.070]  Well, in 2022, in the midterm elections, we had 2,742 field agents located in 10 swing states, because that's where the action is.
[01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:37.576]  And we preserved more than 2.5 ephemeral, 2.5 million ephemeral experiences on Google and other platforms.
[01:39:38.996 --> 01:39:45.979]  A little bit for his ephemeral experiences, because that's the key to this whole thing, understanding what these companies do.
[01:39:45.979 --> 01:39:52.962]  2018, there were leaked emails from Google to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:39:52.962 --> 01:40:07.488]  And in those emails, Google employees were discussing how they could possibly change people's views about Trump's travel ban using, and I quote, ephemeral experiences.
[01:40:07.488 --> 01:40:08.008]  What are those?
[01:40:08.615 --> 01:40:12.698]  Those are those fleeting experiences we've done.
[01:40:12.698 --> 01:40:17.861]  Like you type in a search term and you get some search suggestions flashed at you.
[01:40:17.861 --> 01:40:20.703]  Those are being flashed at you.
[01:40:20.703 --> 01:40:21.203]  By the way.
[01:40:21.203 --> 01:40:24.385]  Then you get some search results.
[01:40:24.385 --> 01:40:29.028]  And those are ephemeral because after you click on one of them, they disappear.
[01:40:29.028 --> 01:40:30.349]  They're not stored anywhere.
[01:40:30.349 --> 01:40:37.394]  You can't go back and find out what kind of search suggestions or results or answer boxes
[01:40:38.018 --> 01:40:40.200]  A company like Google is showing.
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:43.822]  Doctor, I'm going to do this because it's a thing that some talk shows do.
[01:40:43.822 --> 01:40:44.522]  It's a technical problem.
[01:40:44.522 --> 01:40:47.304]  They just go for hours with it and just keep doing it.
[01:40:47.304 --> 01:40:49.866]  And it's something we've not ever been able to break ourselves up.
[01:40:49.866 --> 01:40:51.287]  But I appreciate you.
[01:40:51.287 --> 01:40:52.688]  You're a huge guest.
[01:40:52.688 --> 01:40:53.788]  I'm so honored to have you.
[01:40:53.788 --> 01:40:55.169]  But there's too many technical problems.
[01:40:55.169 --> 01:40:56.350]  You're breaking up.
[01:40:56.350 --> 01:41:01.813]  I would love to invite you back tomorrow if you can get to a place that has power and there's no problems.
[01:41:01.813 --> 01:41:03.715]  Or I'd love to invite you back any day you want.
[01:41:04.255 --> 01:41:07.637]  I'm going to be talking to Tucker Carlson quite a bit here in the near future.
[01:41:07.637 --> 01:41:11.659]  I'm going to advise him, obviously, to try to get you on his show.
[01:41:11.659 --> 01:41:14.901]  And so you're doing an incredible job.
[01:41:14.901 --> 01:41:16.942]  We appreciate you and we'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[01:41:16.942 --> 01:41:19.363]  All right, folks, I'm going to pull the plug on that.
[01:41:19.363 --> 01:41:22.945]  That's gone on too long.
[01:41:22.945 --> 01:41:25.587]  Now, we'll get to this information.
[01:41:25.587 --> 01:41:27.428]  He's got huge stuff.
[01:41:27.428 --> 01:41:30.870]  Ephemeral is subconscious and near subconscious, and I see
[01:41:32.401 --> 01:41:33.582]  CNN's the best at this.
[01:41:33.582 --> 01:41:37.504]  They'll have incredibly fake headlines on the front page.
[01:41:37.504 --> 01:41:51.353]  When you click the headline, though, it takes you to an article that's different, and then they're changing those headlines all the time so they can get away with even bigger whopper lies than what they tell during their regular operation.
[01:41:51.353 --> 01:41:53.374]  So that's exactly what he's doing.
[01:41:53.374 --> 01:41:57.117]  Now, I was glad he wanted to come on for two hours today, but because of problems, I'm going to pull the plug now.
[01:41:58.238 --> 01:42:00.919]  But this will definitely point people at his great research and work.
[01:42:00.919 --> 01:42:04.460]  And as soon as he has his technical issues handled, we'll get him back on.
[01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:06.101]  So don't worry.
[01:42:06.101 --> 01:42:10.162]  I was already ready to do three, four hours with no guests today.
[01:42:10.162 --> 01:42:18.065]  And so we are loaded with news and information that we're going to be breaking down.
[01:42:18.065 --> 01:42:21.226]  But I also want to open the phones up.
[01:42:21.226 --> 01:42:24.527]  So coming up next segment, we're going to break.
[01:42:26.854 --> 01:42:42.620]  Coming up next segment, I'm going to give the number out and cover a bunch of news, and then the next hour, I want to take your call specifically on, it's official, Homeland Security says if you voted for Trump, you are a terrorist.
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:44.841]  You are an enemy, you're to be watched.
[01:42:44.841 --> 01:42:45.762]  Does that intimidate you?
[01:42:45.762 --> 01:42:48.183]  Or does that just make you know how criminal the government is?
[01:42:48.183 --> 01:42:49.303]  I think you're like me.
[01:42:49.303 --> 01:42:51.804]  I think this will only make you be more outspoken.
[01:42:51.804 --> 01:42:56.426]  See, first they're going to try to make myself and Trump a criminal, now they're saying you are a terrorist.
[01:42:58.772 --> 01:43:04.674]  I'm going to say something obvious right now, but it's usually the obvious things that we all miss, including myself.
[01:43:04.674 --> 01:43:07.856]  Everybody's very excited about the impeachment of Joe Biden.
[01:43:07.856 --> 01:43:09.836]  But remember, he is a totally complete puppet.
[01:43:09.836 --> 01:43:16.419]  It needs to be about the criminals that control him, the CIA, BlackRock, the multinational corporations.
[01:43:16.419 --> 01:43:17.620]  People want to blame Obama.
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:20.321]  Yeah, he's above Biden, but he's still a puppet too.
[01:43:20.321 --> 01:43:23.162]  We need to make it about the power structure that's waging war.
[01:43:24.022 --> 01:43:29.326]  Against this country that's de-industrializing us, attacking our culture and creating race war.
[01:43:29.326 --> 01:43:39.632]  We need to make the impeachment all about the open borders and the human trafficking and the global government and the UN taking control of our medical system.
[01:43:39.632 --> 01:43:40.893]  That's what we need to do.
[01:43:40.893 --> 01:43:42.694]  That's what we've got to stand for.
[01:43:42.694 --> 01:43:43.095]  That's what
[01:43:43.815 --> 01:43:44.996]  He's going to bring down the system.
[01:43:44.996 --> 01:43:54.885]  If we just think about Biden, just about how horrible he is, an isopedophile, and how his son's a crackhead, and gun charges, it becomes a distraction from the larger issues.
[01:43:54.885 --> 01:43:57.968]  We'll cover it all live at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:43:58.541 --> 01:44:04.763]  A lot of people have asked me, why is M4Ware's store and M4Ware's life not at a probiotic for more than three years?
[01:44:04.763 --> 01:44:05.984]  The answer is simple.
[01:44:05.984 --> 01:44:08.905]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[01:44:08.905 --> 01:44:13.046]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:18.448]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you Mr. Jones anymore.
[01:44:19.228 --> 01:44:24.712]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[01:44:24.712 --> 01:44:29.275]  We're able to private label it under InfoWars MD as our probiotic formula.

[01:44:59.625 --> 01:45:02.746]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:45:02.746 --> 01:45:05.047]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:45:05.047 --> 01:45:08.989]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:45:08.989 --> 01:45:17.072]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:45:17.072 --> 01:45:25.715]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:45:26.736 --> 01:45:29.619]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:45:29.619 --> 01:45:36.166]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:45:36.166 --> 01:45:39.209]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:45:39.209 --> 01:45:46.256]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:45:46.256 --> 01:45:47.437]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:45:48.118 --> 01:45:52.421]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at M4Short.com.
[01:45:52.421 --> 01:45:57.383]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to M4Short.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:45:57.383 --> 01:45:58.144]  Please take action now.
[01:45:59.355 --> 01:46:02.458]  Have you tried taking the Real Red Pill?

[01:46:13.408 --> 01:46:21.336]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age, and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.

[01:46:50.716 --> 01:47:00.742]  Now 25% off for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:47:00.742 --> 01:47:06.645]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:16.341 --> 01:47:19.845]  What's his name?
[01:47:19.845 --> 01:47:29.996]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[01:47:32.097 --> 01:47:35.840]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:39.443]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[01:47:39.443 --> 01:47:41.644]  It's a military mission in North St.
[01:47:41.644 --> 01:47:42.285]  Louis.
[01:47:42.285 --> 01:47:44.846]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[01:47:44.846 --> 01:47:49.510]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:54.293]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[01:47:54.293 --> 01:47:55.214]  Guns will be taken.
[01:47:55.214 --> 01:47:56.695]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:47:56.695 --> 01:47:57.676]  We will take all weapons.
[01:47:57.876 --> 01:48:00.258]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:48:00.258 --> 01:48:04.821]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:48:04.821 --> 01:48:05.681]  Enough.
[01:48:05.681 --> 01:48:06.482]  Enough.
[01:48:06.482 --> 01:48:07.543]  Enough.
[01:48:07.543 --> 01:48:07.903]  Enough.
[01:48:07.903 --> 01:48:12.486]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:48:12.486 --> 01:48:16.429]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:48:16.829 --> 01:48:24.013]  NSJSA Late News 12's Jeff Barrow discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[01:48:24.013 --> 01:48:32.038]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:48:32.038 --> 01:48:35.640]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.241]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:48:38.084 --> 01:48:44.353]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:48:44.353 --> 01:48:49.320]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:54.026]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[01:49:01.747 --> 01:49:07.110]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[01:49:07.110 --> 01:49:08.391]  You're in your apartment!
[01:49:08.391 --> 01:49:09.531]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[01:49:09.531 --> 01:49:10.752]  You're back in song right now!
[01:49:10.752 --> 01:49:11.512]  I am inside.
[01:49:11.512 --> 01:49:13.673]  I have two words for you.
[01:49:13.673 --> 01:49:15.494]  Predator groans.
[01:49:15.494 --> 01:49:16.495]  You will never see it coming.
[01:49:19.241 --> 01:49:20.562]  Two words for ya.
[01:49:20.562 --> 01:49:23.423]  The dramatic scene played out in front of cameras.
[01:49:23.423 --> 01:49:32.649]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[01:49:32.649 --> 01:49:38.112]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[01:49:38.112 --> 01:49:43.195]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down.
[01:49:43.195 --> 01:49:45.296]  If you want them, come and take them!
[01:49:46.963 --> 01:49:48.685]  We are on the march.
[01:49:48.685 --> 01:49:51.528]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:49:51.528 --> 01:49:56.053]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:50:10.891 --> 01:50:16.616]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[01:50:16.616 --> 01:50:27.045]  This is the heart of 1776!
[01:50:27.045 --> 01:50:29.768]  Hard to believe that is an eight-year-old promo.
[01:50:31.533 --> 01:50:36.535]  The reason I played it is it's just some of the latest police state stuff I warned of.
[01:50:36.535 --> 01:50:45.618]  And now the police state, pointed right at conservatives and Christians and Catholics and patriots, is the number one story.
[01:50:45.618 --> 01:50:46.338]  It's official.
[01:50:46.338 --> 01:50:49.619]  Biden has said the main terror threat is the American people.
[01:50:49.619 --> 01:50:53.300]  And all Trump supporters are terrorists.
[01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:55.821]  Newsweek, they're all reporting it.
[01:50:55.821 --> 01:51:00.983]  The left is saying it's time to use Homeland Security just to arrest us all, release all the violent criminals, put us in there.
[01:51:02.162 --> 01:51:19.027]  And the FBI is saying, well, if just 1% of 80 plus million Trump supporters don't go along, what's 1% of 80 million?
[01:51:19.027 --> 01:51:22.288]  Do the math.
[01:51:22.288 --> 01:51:25.990]  It's over a million and a half people.
[01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:27.670]  That's the plan.
[01:51:27.670 --> 01:51:29.090]  You're like, well, we'll crush the feds.
[01:51:29.090 --> 01:51:29.531]  Yeah.
[01:51:29.531 --> 01:51:30.431]  And the country will be wrecked.
[01:51:32.042 --> 01:51:37.345]  So we've got to go through the Attorney General's, we've got to go through the state's legislators, we've got to defund this through Congress.
[01:51:37.345 --> 01:51:41.208]  We've got to stop this now, we've got to have FBI whistleblowers like they're doing.
[01:51:41.208 --> 01:51:42.809]  More federal judges blocking it.
[01:51:42.809 --> 01:51:49.953]  Fifth Circuit just said it's illegal what Biden did, surveilling and censoring people, and that it was election theft.
[01:51:49.953 --> 01:51:52.575]  That's the Associated Press today.
[01:51:52.575 --> 01:51:54.756]  That's how we beat this.
[01:51:54.756 --> 01:51:57.078]  It will do not nothing
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:05.443]  If anybody's dumb enough to go shoot a federal marshal or an FBI agent, it'll help them.
[01:52:05.443 --> 01:52:07.564]  It'll help the globalists get this war started.
[01:52:07.564 --> 01:52:09.145]  So it doesn't just do nothing.
[01:52:09.145 --> 01:52:12.106]  It's negative.
[01:52:12.106 --> 01:52:15.168]  And people will say, because I see some people that all are calling for violence.
[01:52:15.168 --> 01:52:16.628]  They never do it themselves, though.
[01:52:16.628 --> 01:52:19.670]  Oh, Jones is a coward or Jones is a fad.
[01:52:19.670 --> 01:52:21.211]  It's time to start killing.
[01:52:21.211 --> 01:52:23.251]  You see that all over the place.
[01:52:23.251 --> 01:52:24.912]  Yeah, I'm a coward.
[01:52:24.912 --> 01:52:26.473]  Right, right, right, right.
[01:52:31.175 --> 01:52:36.719]  Let me show you a headline that's a pretty big deal.
[01:52:36.719 --> 01:52:38.481]  And I've actually got dozens of these.
[01:52:38.481 --> 01:52:41.543]  I mean, I mean, last week I've seen probably 20 of these headlines.
[01:52:41.543 --> 01:52:44.685]  Got two of them today.
[01:52:44.685 --> 01:52:46.607]  And this tells you everything you need to know.
[01:52:46.607 --> 01:52:50.570]  And when you hear me read this, you're going to go, oh, he's been saying this for a couple of years.
[01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:52.231]  Now it's all over the news.
[01:52:52.231 --> 01:52:54.733]  The talking point.
[01:52:54.733 --> 01:52:59.537]  The Trump collapse is coming and he's taking Biden with him.
[01:52:59.537 --> 01:52:59.877]  The Hill.
[01:53:02.259 --> 01:53:08.625]  And Newsweek and the Washington Post and the New York Times, they're all CNN, MSNBC.
[01:53:08.625 --> 01:53:13.871]  They're all saying the Trump collapse is here, but don't worry, Biden's going to be taken out too.
[01:53:13.871 --> 01:53:17.394]  Politically, criminally, assassination.
[01:53:17.394 --> 01:53:22.900]  I see them killing both men or something along those lines.
[01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:24.942]  To launch this civil war.
[01:53:27.506 --> 01:53:28.987]  You're like, well, I have a normalcy bias.
[01:53:28.987 --> 01:53:29.968]  That's hard to believe.
[01:53:29.968 --> 01:53:34.892]  Well, just a year ago, Biden said we can't send Abrams tanks and heavy cruise missiles and F-16s.
[01:53:34.892 --> 01:53:36.874]  That's World War III.
[01:53:36.874 --> 01:53:37.935]  We can't send troops.
[01:53:37.935 --> 01:53:38.936]  Now they admit the troops are there.
[01:53:38.936 --> 01:53:40.237]  They've been there the whole time.
[01:53:40.237 --> 01:53:41.999]  Now the British are like, yeah, we're sending troops.
[01:53:41.999 --> 01:53:42.599]  Russians are fine.
[01:53:42.599 --> 01:53:44.040]  We'll hit them with tactical nukes.
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:45.942]  That's nukes getting used, folks.
[01:53:45.942 --> 01:53:47.223]  You think that sounds safe?
[01:53:47.223 --> 01:53:49.745]  You think that sounds like a good thing?
[01:53:49.745 --> 01:53:51.327]  These are crazy people.
[01:53:53.123 --> 01:54:07.058]  And if Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who won't come back to America and live on giant yachts and private islands in the middle of nowhere in the South Pacific, think they're going to be safe from a nuclear war, they got another thing coming.
[01:54:07.058 --> 01:54:09.300]  You're the people endangering the planet.
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:11.582]  You're the people pushing us to the bridge of war.
[01:54:11.582 --> 01:54:15.847]  You're the ones backing Communist China while we have our energy sectors cut off.
[01:54:17.031 --> 01:54:27.320]  You're the warmongers, you're the tyrants, you're the oppressors, but you wear pink shirts and yellow socks and act all effeminate and non-threatening because you're smart.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:31.203]  If you walked in in a black uniform and said, I'm your master, we'd say no.
[01:54:31.203 --> 01:54:37.789]  But if you come and say, be nice, be liberal, you think people will go along with it.
[01:54:37.789 --> 01:54:42.253]  So now officially, you've seen the buildup to it, the declaration of war.
[01:54:42.253 --> 01:54:43.594]  Listen to me, this isn't rhetoric.
[01:54:44.943 --> 01:54:48.627]  This stuff sounds shocking, but you got to face reality.
[01:54:48.627 --> 01:54:54.613]  There's not an ounce of exaggeration, not an ounce of anything to this, but reality.
[01:54:54.613 --> 01:54:59.398]  The globalist, black rock globalist feel like they run the government.
[01:54:59.398 --> 01:55:00.559]  They're not getting the blame.
[01:55:00.559 --> 01:55:02.461]  They can play us off against each other.
[01:55:02.461 --> 01:55:05.104]  They feel insulated.
[01:55:05.104 --> 01:55:07.266]  They feel invincible.
[01:55:10.635 --> 01:55:15.776]  And so they're moving the pieces into this for an accelerated global economic cultural
[01:55:16.656 --> 01:55:27.124]  Food supply, energy collapse, out of which they believe the dumbed-down masses, their words, will buy into the new ESG, eat the bugs, new world order, you'll own nothing, have nothing paradigm.
[01:55:27.124 --> 01:55:28.906]  That's their admitted plan.
[01:55:28.906 --> 01:55:30.887]  The end of the human age is here.
[01:55:30.887 --> 01:55:33.990]  In their words, they're demolishing it in front of you.
[01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:44.578]  And whether you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, a school teacher, an auto mechanic, a federal agent, a lawyer, a doctor, a farmer,
[01:55:47.635 --> 01:55:59.420]  A food delivery person, an 18-wheeler driver, a gardener, a psychologist, a member of Congress.
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:09.784]  It doesn't matter who you are, if you're a plumber or if you run a small and own a small pet shop.
[01:56:09.784 --> 01:56:13.065]  This is a post-human, end of human history move.
[01:56:14.465 --> 01:56:25.553]  By the way, just type in anything I say, and you'll have Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, Navalno, Harari, all of them singing, and they're in control, boys and girls.
[01:56:25.553 --> 01:56:30.036]  And they've already begun the sabotage of civilization and society.
[01:56:30.036 --> 01:56:32.898]  They're already in high gear.
[01:56:32.898 --> 01:56:36.761]  Trump opened the phones on one subject, martial law, the new world order.
[01:56:36.761 --> 01:56:38.122]  It's a huge subject.
[01:56:38.122 --> 01:56:40.663]  The Feds declaring the American people the enemy.
[01:56:40.663 --> 01:56:43.265]  Other Feds leaking and saying, we don't want this, it's insane.
[01:56:43.265 --> 01:56:44.026]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:56:45.452 --> 01:56:50.395]  Let's all pour gasoline on each other and light each other on fire and run around like morons.
[01:56:50.395 --> 01:56:52.876]  No!
[01:56:52.876 --> 01:56:53.937]  We're taking calls.
[01:56:53.937 --> 01:56:54.517]  Police.
[01:56:54.517 --> 01:56:55.078]  Military.
[01:56:55.078 --> 01:56:57.059]  But they'll go to the head of the line because they want to hear from them.
[01:56:57.059 --> 01:56:57.899]  I'm going to move quick.
[01:56:57.899 --> 01:56:59.020]  But it's open for everybody.
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:56:59.740]  First-time callers.
[01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:01.361]  Long-time callers.
[01:57:01.361 --> 01:57:01.701]  Agree.
[01:57:01.701 --> 01:57:02.282]  Disagree.
[01:57:02.282 --> 01:57:03.402]  What do you say about this?
[01:57:03.402 --> 01:57:05.323]  Because we've been totally vindicated.
[01:57:05.323 --> 01:57:06.544]  I didn't want to be vindicated.
[01:57:06.544 --> 01:57:08.145]  I wanted to stop this before it happened.
[01:57:08.145 --> 01:57:11.307]  I didn't want them to start rolling out COVID protocols again and be vindicated.
[01:57:11.307 --> 01:57:12.107]  But they're doing it.
[01:57:12.107 --> 01:57:12.628]  I'm vindicated.
[01:57:13.390 --> 01:57:15.632]  We've mitigated it some, but maybe 30%.
[01:57:15.632 --> 01:57:18.434]  At least we're not taking it lying down.
[01:57:18.434 --> 01:57:18.494]  877-789-2539.
[01:57:18.494 --> 01:57:18.875]  877-789-2539.
[01:57:18.875 --> 01:57:18.935]  877-789-2539.
[01:57:18.935 --> 01:57:20.056]  Or 877-789-A-L-E-X.
[01:57:20.056 --> 01:57:20.937]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[01:57:20.937 --> 01:57:22.958]  Don't forget, my new book is available, signed or unsigned.
[01:57:22.958 --> 01:57:24.720]  It's a powerful book, and we need the funds to operate.
[01:57:42.276 --> 01:57:43.557]  The Great Awakening!
[01:57:43.557 --> 01:57:44.997]  The Great Awakening!
[01:57:44.997 --> 01:57:50.700]  At Infowarshore.com.
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:52.961]  Last year we put this book out.
[01:57:52.961 --> 01:57:54.381]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:57:54.381 --> 01:57:56.762]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[01:57:56.762 --> 01:58:00.524]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[01:58:00.524 --> 01:58:01.524]  The Great Awakening!
[01:58:01.524 --> 01:58:05.766]  The Plan to Defeat the Globalists and Launch the Second Great Renaissance.
[01:58:05.766 --> 01:58:07.827]  This is such a powerful book.
[01:58:07.827 --> 01:58:09.508]  It covers all the globalist plans,
[01:58:10.128 --> 01:58:16.730]  The latest developments, how to stop them, and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[01:58:16.730 --> 01:58:18.291]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[01:58:18.291 --> 01:58:20.672]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.
[01:58:20.672 --> 01:58:25.774]  You can get signed or unsigned copies of the book at infowarestore.com.
[01:58:25.774 --> 01:58:27.454]  This is a historic book.

[01:58:46.367 --> 01:58:47.428]  It's a powerful book.
[01:58:47.428 --> 01:58:47.948]  Get yours now.
[01:58:48.288 --> 01:58:49.689]  Bodies is back!

[01:58:57.091 --> 01:59:02.473]  Utilized for thousands of years, tumeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[01:59:02.473 --> 01:59:10.116]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of tumeric and its active components.
[01:59:10.436 --> 01:59:21.326]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[01:59:21.326 --> 01:59:33.097]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[01:59:33.317 --> 01:59:36.800]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:40.644]  So if you want to put the true power of turmeric to the test, then look no further.

[01:59:52.094 --> 01:59:56.018]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:06.781 --> 02:00:07.221]  Your calls.
[02:00:07.221 --> 02:00:17.347]  Can you please give me a few scientific papers that prove human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming?
[02:00:17.347 --> 02:00:25.491]  No one can show from the scientific literature that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.
[02:00:25.491 --> 02:00:33.696]  Climate change is too abstract for people to understand, but the coming water crisis is something that everybody will get on board with.
[02:00:34.195 --> 02:00:40.259]  From Malaysia to Mexico, from Sri Lanka to Singapore, privatization is on the move.
[02:00:40.259 --> 02:00:43.481]  They're restricting water supplies all over the planet.
[02:00:43.481 --> 02:00:53.827]  They've passed legislation to take pure aquifer water all over Canada, the US, England, Europe, you name it, and put it through a bunch of chemical processors to poison the living hell out of it.
[02:00:53.827 --> 02:01:00.391]  And to give it way more expensive pricing to then make the cost of water go up.
[02:01:01.051 --> 02:01:04.313]  Water has always been free in the UK.
[02:01:04.313 --> 02:01:06.995]  They live on a giant crystal clear aquifer.
[02:01:06.995 --> 02:01:09.036]  Now they're starting to charge for it.
[02:01:09.036 --> 02:01:11.297]  This is how they operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:11.297 --> 02:01:17.100]  One of the biggest experiments in water privatization has taken place in the UK.
[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:23.084]  In 1989, the government sold off the entire water system of England and Wales to limited companies.
[02:01:23.684 --> 02:01:29.785]  More than 30 years later, that system is being criticized across the political spectrum.
[02:01:29.785 --> 02:01:43.888]  Chief executives have been awarded hefty pay packages, shareholders generous dividends, and investment in infrastructure has not kept pace with population growth, leading to sewage flooding and pollution failures.
[02:01:43.888 --> 02:01:50.489]  Just 14% of rivers meet the minimum European standards for water quality, for example.
[02:01:50.489 --> 02:01:52.109]  The global government is failing.
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:55.582]  They create the crises or exacerbate the problems.
[02:01:55.582 --> 02:01:57.364]  Those are the saviors.
[02:01:57.364 --> 02:02:06.993]  When problems arise in the Sahel or even in Texas or anywhere else, it's not because something went wrong in that local area.
[02:02:06.993 --> 02:02:08.735]  It's because something is going wrong globally.
[02:02:09.838 --> 02:02:13.841]  Something went wrong globally, so we've got to address this at the global level.
[02:02:13.841 --> 02:02:20.806]  This is about investing in global common, the global commons, for the common good of all.
[02:02:20.806 --> 02:02:32.735]  And that word, common good, is actually a radical word, because in economics we have notions of the public good, and it sounds good, because the second word is good, but it's really framed more as a correction for something the private sector is not doing.
[02:02:33.095 --> 02:02:35.217]  That's also of course true with COVID, right?
[02:02:35.217 --> 02:02:42.625]  We are all only as healthy as our neighbor is on our street and our city and our region and our nation and globally.
[02:02:42.625 --> 02:02:43.746]  Did we solve that?
[02:02:43.746 --> 02:02:46.209]  Did we actually manage to vaccinate everyone in the world?
[02:02:46.209 --> 02:02:47.130]  No.
[02:02:47.130 --> 02:02:52.215]  So highlighting water as a global commons and what it means to work together and see it both
[02:02:52.695 --> 02:02:52.915]  Absolutely.
[02:03:09.665 --> 02:03:10.805]  People understand it really well.
[02:03:10.805 --> 02:03:11.906]  Some understand it a bit.
[02:03:11.906 --> 02:03:13.266]  Some just don't understand it.
[02:03:13.266 --> 02:03:14.227]  Water.
[02:03:14.227 --> 02:03:16.567]  Every kid knows how important it is to have water.
[02:03:16.567 --> 02:03:19.368]  When you're playing football and you're thirsty, you need water.
[02:03:19.368 --> 02:03:26.871]  So there's also something about really getting citizen engagement around this and really, in some ways, experimenting with this notion of the common good.
[02:03:26.871 --> 02:03:30.512]  Can we actually deliver this time in ways that we have failed miserably?
[02:03:31.132 --> 02:03:35.619]  They're admitting they're bringing in global currencies that are already here, already running China.
[02:03:35.619 --> 02:03:38.143]  They tried it in Nigeria, now it's massively backfired.
[02:03:38.143 --> 02:03:39.506]  They're pulling it out there.
[02:03:39.506 --> 02:03:42.631]  But it just devastates economies, but it consolidates power.
[02:03:42.631 --> 02:03:43.732]  Remember those headlines?
[02:03:45.723 --> 02:03:50.225]  Workers lost 3.7 trillion in earnings during the pandemic, the plandemic.
[02:03:50.225 --> 02:03:55.687]  World's billionaires get richer by 3.9 trillion during the pandemic, more than doubling their wealth.
[02:03:55.687 --> 02:04:02.650]  Yet in 2016, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee found that Ofwat were too generous.
[02:04:02.650 --> 02:04:13.414]  And as a result, water companies made windfall gains of at least 1.2 billion between 2010 and 2015, from bills being higher than necessary.
[02:04:13.414 --> 02:04:14.935]  What happens in one part of the world?
[02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:22.378]  Ends up in another part of the world that's intrinsic to the climate crisis and water is intertwined with that climate crisis.
[02:04:22.378 --> 02:04:26.160]  And honestly, we have a common language on climate.
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:27.721]  But we don't have that on water.
[02:04:27.721 --> 02:04:35.825]  And that's, that's in my view, that is exactly what we need to have in order to progress towards a common goal.
[02:04:35.825 --> 02:04:41.728]  And so what's happening is the general public and people in the government and big talk show hosts across the board realize that
[02:04:42.745 --> 02:04:45.226]  They're being targeted, too, no matter how rich and powerful you are.
[02:04:45.226 --> 02:04:48.007]  If you're not in the inner club, you're being targeted.
[02:04:48.007 --> 02:04:49.588]  And the globalists get blowback themselves.
[02:04:49.588 --> 02:04:50.969]  They get hurt by their own attacks.
[02:04:50.969 --> 02:04:52.449]  It's insane.
[02:04:52.449 --> 02:04:53.850]  It's satanic.
[02:04:53.850 --> 02:04:59.492]  It's crazy.
[02:04:59.492 --> 02:05:02.694]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[02:05:03.991 --> 02:05:09.174]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[02:05:09.174 --> 02:05:12.636]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[02:05:12.636 --> 02:05:13.697]  Well, I know where you are.
[02:05:13.697 --> 02:05:18.180]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:24.044]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[02:05:24.784 --> 02:05:31.790]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:35.433]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.
[02:05:35.433 --> 02:05:39.977]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book, and just like the last book,
[02:05:40.257 --> 02:05:40.517]  We're good.
[02:06:05.276 --> 02:06:09.359]  We are now into hour number three.
[02:06:09.359 --> 02:06:15.264]  I got a very serious phone call about 10 minutes ago, 15 minutes ago during the last break, from Mike Lindell.
[02:06:15.264 --> 02:06:18.686]  The gravest news yet in the Deep State's attempt to bring him down.
[02:06:18.686 --> 02:06:22.950]  He'll be joining us in the last segment of this hour.
[02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:26.913]  Professor Epstein had the power go out in his building today.
[02:06:26.913 --> 02:06:27.833]  He could not do the show.
[02:06:27.833 --> 02:06:28.954]  He'll be joining us tomorrow.
[02:06:31.542 --> 02:06:38.769]  So look to that as he exposes the fact that the 2024 election is already being stolen as we speak and how they're doing it.
[02:06:38.769 --> 02:06:40.110]  It's all coming up.
[02:06:40.110 --> 02:06:42.953]  It's the final countdown.
[02:06:42.953 --> 02:06:44.194]  The Crossroads.
[02:06:44.194 --> 02:06:44.935]  We're at it right now.
[02:06:44.935 --> 02:06:47.357]  Alright, if you just joined us, let me just recap.
[02:06:47.357 --> 02:06:52.361]  I'm going to take your calls quick, give each person a minute and a half, and then the next person, to respect all of you, because I want to hear from all of you.
[02:06:52.361 --> 02:06:54.964]  No matter how good your call is, just make your point, we're going to the next person.
[02:06:57.679 --> 02:07:03.422]  Limbaugh would say, just say kudos, I love you too, let's just move on to get your information.
[02:07:03.422 --> 02:07:05.043]  So it's official.
[02:07:05.043 --> 02:07:07.184]  Came out in the news last night.
[02:07:07.184 --> 02:07:15.007]  Homeland Security says the main threat is the American people, and they're not just going to list people that question open borders, or forced injections, or any of that.
[02:07:15.007 --> 02:07:19.389]  They're going to say any Trump supporter is a potential terrorist.
[02:07:19.389 --> 02:07:22.031]  And it's a big Newsweek article, they interviewed more than a dozen.
[02:07:22.967 --> 02:07:30.076]  High-level former and current FBI officials and others and they're very concerned saying this is illegal to say the American people are terrorists.
[02:07:30.076 --> 02:07:31.378]  Uh-uh, yeah.
[02:07:31.378 --> 02:07:36.304]  Catholics, conservative Catholics are the main threat.
[02:07:36.304 --> 02:07:40.129]  They say conservatives are the main terror threat and then conservative Catholics.
[02:07:40.129 --> 02:07:40.810]  I'm not Catholic.
[02:07:41.573 --> 02:07:45.877]  My family on both sides are Protestants, back to the Mayflower, quite famous ones.
[02:07:45.877 --> 02:07:49.601]  I don't toot my horn, but I love Catholics.
[02:07:49.601 --> 02:07:56.487]  I know Catholics and Protestants have killed each other for 400 years, and it's been a crazy deal, but at this day and age, we're all trying to fight the devil.
[02:07:56.487 --> 02:07:58.209]  We all love Jesus.
[02:07:58.209 --> 02:08:00.191]  We believe in the same God.
[02:08:00.191 --> 02:08:01.412]  None of our doctrines are perfect.
[02:08:01.412 --> 02:08:02.553]  We're men trying to interpret God.
[02:08:03.954 --> 02:08:14.316]  When I've been in abortion clinics protesting hundreds of times, when I've gotten support from listeners, when I'm on the street, it's over-proportioned by Catholic conservatives.
[02:08:14.316 --> 02:08:16.496]  They're good people.
[02:08:16.496 --> 02:08:18.176]  They're hard-working.
[02:08:18.176 --> 02:08:20.097]  They're family people.
[02:08:20.097 --> 02:08:23.977]  And they are a disproportionate group of our supporters.
[02:08:23.977 --> 02:08:25.598]  Well, you judge a tree by its roots.
[02:08:25.598 --> 02:08:32.319]  And the idea that conservative, which is just classic Catholics,
[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:38.304]  Like Pope John Paul, you could say, was like a modern version of that.
[02:08:38.304 --> 02:08:42.127]  Look, compared to this current pope, it's diametrically opposed.
[02:08:42.127 --> 02:08:43.748]  Either John Paul's bad or this guy's bad.
[02:08:43.748 --> 02:08:45.870]  No, the new guy's horrible.
[02:08:45.870 --> 02:08:46.871]  I mean, look at John Paul's stuff.
[02:08:46.871 --> 02:08:47.531]  He was great.
[02:08:47.531 --> 02:08:48.452]  I agree with it.
[02:08:48.452 --> 02:08:52.996]  Anti-communist, pro-family, I mean, anti-abortion, anti-eugenics.
[02:08:52.996 --> 02:08:55.758]  Look at the difference today.
[02:08:55.758 --> 02:08:58.400]  I mean, you can say what you want all day, and there's this big fight.
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:08:59.581]  People love to attack Catholics.
[02:08:59.581 --> 02:09:02.744]  They love to... I'm not part of that.
[02:09:04.096 --> 02:09:16.359]  And the attack on conservative Catholics is insane.
[02:09:16.359 --> 02:09:28.843]  I was in San Antonio on business a while back, a few weeks ago, and I saw this really pretty Catholic, big Catholic church.
[02:09:28.843 --> 02:09:32.304]  And I had about 15 minutes for my next meeting I was going to, and I thought, I just feel led.
[02:09:34.793 --> 02:09:37.275]  To just go in there for a minute.
[02:09:37.275 --> 02:09:40.957]  And I guess they were having, it was like five, six o'clock at night, a mass there.
[02:09:40.957 --> 02:09:42.318]  And I couldn't get out of the building.
[02:09:42.318 --> 02:09:44.120]  I was mobbed by the people.
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:46.361]  They were like all listeners, mainly Hispanic.
[02:09:46.361 --> 02:09:48.082]  It was insane.
[02:09:48.082 --> 02:09:53.406]  So all I'm saying is they're scared, folks, because whatever you want to say about Catholics, they're certainly not perfect.
[02:09:53.406 --> 02:09:54.727]  Nobody is.
[02:09:54.727 --> 02:09:56.749]  And they've used the same pedophile system to try to take them over.
[02:09:57.540 --> 02:10:04.723]  They are super awake now, and the globalists have identified them as, okay, that group of people's not going along with us.
[02:10:04.723 --> 02:10:07.764]  Despite everything they've done, put it in their Antichrist Pope.
[02:10:07.764 --> 02:10:10.445]  I'm not saying he's the Antichrist, but Antichrist spirit.
[02:10:10.445 --> 02:10:13.106]  All that has failed, and I don't want to go off into it.
[02:10:13.106 --> 02:10:15.107]  I'm not a Catholic apologist either.
[02:10:15.107 --> 02:10:22.990]  I'm just simply saying, Homeland Security says conservative Catholics are the number one threat of threats.
[02:10:24.019 --> 02:10:26.300]  You read those reports, it's not just, oh, they're a threat.
[02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:35.384]  No, they go, Christian, conservatives, and Trump supporters, and populists, and nationalists are the main threat, with no evidence, super low crime rate.
[02:10:35.384 --> 02:10:46.850]  And then they're saying, Orthodox Catholics that go to mass, and go to church three, four nights a week, and donate to charity, and like, those people?
[02:10:46.850 --> 02:10:52.012]  I don't know if you know any conservative Catholics, but let me tell you, they're not out committing crimes, folks.
[02:10:52.012 --> 02:10:53.193]  They're not out blowing stuff up.
[02:10:54.346 --> 02:10:57.787]  But they are not going along with the evil.
[02:10:57.787 --> 02:11:07.650]  So if you want to know about the FBI, folks, it literally says that conservative Catholics are the number one enemy.
[02:11:07.650 --> 02:11:09.450]  Until yesterday.
[02:11:09.450 --> 02:11:16.712]  Turns out weeks ago, Biden signed orders at the Justice Department and said, well, we're going to move on from the Catholics.
[02:11:16.712 --> 02:11:18.313]  I mean, they're already targeting them.
[02:11:18.313 --> 02:11:20.894]  It's all Trump supporters.
[02:11:20.894 --> 02:11:22.174]  Again, statistically, folks.
[02:11:23.712 --> 02:11:25.113]  You can look it up.
[02:11:25.113 --> 02:11:28.094]  Republicans have the lowest crime rate to begin with, on average.
[02:11:28.094 --> 02:11:30.455]  Christians have a super low crime rate.
[02:11:30.455 --> 02:11:46.561]  And to say Trump supporters are this lawless mob of criminals is the most preposterous, asinine crap I have ever heard in my life.
[02:11:46.561 --> 02:11:52.584]  And the truth is the globalists have captured the Catholic Church at the top, and there's a war by the Pope against
[02:11:54.281 --> 02:12:05.268]  Catholics that are defenders of their faith and an attack by the globalists that control the Catholic Church at the top against them.
[02:12:05.268 --> 02:12:08.050]  But we can't put them down because their group's captured.
[02:12:08.050 --> 02:12:10.092]  Our country is captured!
[02:12:10.092 --> 02:12:17.136]  You turn on these Protestant shows, and there's a lot of great Protestants, great people.
[02:12:17.136 --> 02:12:18.837]  Where's the Protestant preachers?
[02:12:18.837 --> 02:12:22.360]  Rodney Howard Brown.
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:23.941]  I mean, he's not bashing Catholics, but
[02:12:25.629 --> 02:12:29.972]  Where are they?
[02:12:29.972 --> 02:12:31.273]  Non-existent.
[02:12:31.273 --> 02:12:39.198]  Because they have sent their infiltrators in, and they will give you massive money and support to sell out.
[02:12:39.198 --> 02:12:40.159]  So, this is a big deal.
[02:12:40.159 --> 02:12:44.242]  But the good news is, as I go to your calls, we'll skip this break.
[02:12:44.242 --> 02:12:46.884]  Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the group right below the Supreme Court.
[02:12:48.010 --> 02:12:49.691]  Said it's illegal what Biden did.
[02:12:49.691 --> 02:13:01.979]  We, we expand the injunction on Homeland Security and other agencies working with the feds and working with other agencies and big tech to censor that's election stealing.
[02:13:01.979 --> 02:13:03.160]  Look at this.
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:09.264]  Biden agency likely violated free speech, violated the law by working with Tim.
[02:13:09.264 --> 02:13:13.647]  Second highest court in the land.
[02:13:13.647 --> 02:13:13.847]  So.
[02:13:20.233 --> 02:13:22.455]  This is a big deal.
[02:13:22.455 --> 02:13:24.938]  It's a really big deal.
[02:13:24.938 --> 02:13:38.011]  And when a government tells you that Trump supporters are an enemy and terrorist, and tells you that protesting parents over critical race theory and transgenderism are bad people, and that
[02:13:39.813 --> 02:13:42.016]  Anybody that questions open borders are the bad guys.
[02:13:42.016 --> 02:13:44.779]  And the conservative Catholics?
[02:13:44.779 --> 02:13:47.022]  Did you have that on your bingo card?
[02:13:47.022 --> 02:13:49.765]  I mean, maybe some of you out there haven't been around the block like I have.
[02:13:49.765 --> 02:13:54.410]  I'm going to say it again.
[02:13:54.410 --> 02:13:59.797]  I don't feel in danger when I'm in a Baptist church, and I don't feel like I'm in danger when I'm in a Catholic church.
[02:14:02.199 --> 02:14:07.982]  The idea that people that care about God and are trying to find God and stay close to God are the bad guys.
[02:14:07.982 --> 02:14:09.683]  That's the devil, folks.
[02:14:09.683 --> 02:14:11.544]  It's the devil, plain and simple.
[02:14:11.544 --> 02:14:17.968]  They left the stripper bars and Walmart and liquor stores open all over the world during the lockdowns, but not the churches.
[02:14:20.643 --> 02:14:29.575]  Because even though the churches are controlled in many cases, there's still people looking for God coming together that meet each other and take care of each other and love each other.
[02:14:29.575 --> 02:14:34.021]  So I postulate, and I don't think there's a debate, anybody saying
[02:14:35.182 --> 02:14:49.789]  That a Protestant, or a Catholic, or a Conservative, or a Christian, or a pro-family person, or an anti-crime person is the bad guy works for the devil, period.
[02:14:49.789 --> 02:14:52.030]  That's not hard to figure out.
[02:14:52.030 --> 02:15:00.294]  Out of this whole world of evil, our government says the number one threat is Trump supporters.
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:06.681]  And for the last two years it's been conservative Catholics.
[02:15:06.681 --> 02:15:10.742]  Where did they pull that out of?
[02:15:10.742 --> 02:15:14.483]  Right out of Satan's brain, that's where from.
[02:15:14.483 --> 02:15:16.144]  But it didn't work on the conservative Catholics.
[02:15:16.144 --> 02:15:17.004]  They're stronger than ever.
[02:15:17.004 --> 02:15:18.304]  It didn't work on the Protestants.
[02:15:18.304 --> 02:15:19.424]  It didn't work on the Christians.
[02:15:19.424 --> 02:15:20.625]  It didn't work on the conservatives.
[02:15:20.625 --> 02:15:25.066]  Sure as hell their threats against me didn't work.
[02:15:25.066 --> 02:15:29.307]  And it's not that I got chutzpah or bravado or machismo or
[02:15:30.609 --> 02:15:37.072]  That I am, you know, a guy looking for trouble.
[02:15:37.072 --> 02:15:44.455]  It's that I know that when I bow down to somebody, when I've done nothing wrong, I become a slave.
[02:15:44.455 --> 02:15:46.575]  And I lose my freedom.
[02:15:46.575 --> 02:15:53.058]  And it only gets worse.
[02:15:53.058 --> 02:15:57.880]  So I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees.
[02:16:04.494 --> 02:16:08.855]  The secret is, if you live on your feet, you live.
[02:16:08.855 --> 02:16:12.057]  People that live on their knees die.
[02:16:12.057 --> 02:16:14.437]  Spiritually, but physically more often.
[02:16:14.437 --> 02:16:17.458]  It's safer to have an attitude, I'm going to die on my feet.
[02:16:17.458 --> 02:16:22.500]  Doesn't matter what you do, how many threats, whatever you pull.
[02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:28.102]  I don't know how all this is going to end, and I didn't start this, but if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[02:16:31.809 --> 02:16:38.174]  I'll take your pedophiles and your devil worshippers and your globalists stacked up against our people any day, and we're going to win that fight.
[02:16:38.174 --> 02:16:39.455]  All right, I'm going to stop.
[02:16:39.455 --> 02:16:40.416]  I'm going to take calls.
[02:16:40.416 --> 02:16:41.777]  I'm going to you right now.
[02:16:41.777 --> 02:16:51.446]  Randy, Carlos, Dave, Dave, Jaden, Evan, Bob, John, Tilly, Adam, Mike, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:16:51.446 --> 02:16:52.947]  Let's go to Evan in California.
[02:16:52.947 --> 02:16:55.489]  You're first up.
[02:16:55.489 --> 02:16:58.191]  Alex, I agree with every word you just said.
[02:16:58.191 --> 02:17:00.193]  I want to point out why the Catholics
[02:17:00.945 --> 02:17:12.591]  ...are such a threat is because Bible prophecy is the outline of what they're doing, and anybody that believes the Bible is essentially a threat to them, because that's the blueprint.
[02:17:12.591 --> 02:17:16.013]  I'm Evan the Evangelist from Jesus Christ Worldwide Ministries.
[02:17:16.013 --> 02:17:20.235]  I called into you, talked to you before you went to Pastor Brown's church.
[02:17:20.235 --> 02:17:24.738]  They took down my business off of Google, where it can no longer be searched.
[02:17:24.738 --> 02:17:28.620]  So they can pull the...they can flip the switch anytime.
[02:17:29.153 --> 02:17:38.297]  And they're doing it in increments so they won't be found out, but they're gonna flip the switch and make the war before the election, where all different types of chaos is happening.
[02:17:38.297 --> 02:17:46.740]  Because I'm a guy, I'm an evangelist, and I can't rub two nickels together, and yet they're banning me, because I put up a couple YouTube videos, and because I talk to different people.
[02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:52.902]  Oh, no, no, they're particularly scared of, quote, the little guy, because a lot of little guys together makes a giant.
[02:17:52.902 --> 02:17:53.382]  Yep.
[02:17:53.382 --> 02:17:57.724]  I call churches, what I do with my ministry is I go to different churches that confront
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:00.782]  The pastor is about not preaching prophecy.
[02:18:00.782 --> 02:18:06.646]  One of the great signs of the end times is that prophecy would no longer be taught.
[02:18:06.646 --> 02:18:08.487]  Because if you taught it, people would wake up.
[02:18:08.487 --> 02:18:09.848]  So I've got to move to another college, brother.
[02:18:09.848 --> 02:18:10.849]  It's time to get to everybody.
[02:18:10.849 --> 02:18:16.833]  What's your view on the Marshall Law rolling out openly saying that any Trump supporter is a terrorist?
[02:18:18.104 --> 02:18:23.428]  I 100% agree with what you're commenting on and I actually don't think there's going to be another election.
[02:18:23.428 --> 02:18:27.311]  I think they're going to pull the plug and they're just going to come up with a reason why there's no election.
[02:18:27.311 --> 02:18:28.712]  I don't feel like... I agree with you.
[02:18:28.712 --> 02:18:30.053]  I gotta jump to get to everybody.
[02:18:30.053 --> 02:18:31.494]  Bob in New York, thanks for calling.
[02:18:31.494 --> 02:18:33.296]  Go ahead.
[02:18:33.296 --> 02:18:35.697]  Hey Alex, appreciate you taking the call again.
[02:18:35.697 --> 02:18:39.120]  Talk to you so much like a friend almost.
[02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:43.283]  And I was Austere Scholar on Rumble.
[02:18:43.283 --> 02:18:46.726]  That's where I've been for the last three years, boots on the ground.
[02:18:47.501 --> 02:18:54.985]  At the current moment, I'm on the road, but I have to go back into New York City every 10 days, and I have buddies on the ground.
[02:18:54.985 --> 02:19:05.850]  And the migrants are still being bused in, even though the puppet Eric Adams is backtracking and saying, oh, you know, we're a sanctuary city, but hey, this is too much.
[02:19:05.850 --> 02:19:11.353]  And then HOCL also doesn't defend the action itself, but the action keeps going, which tells you that.
[02:19:11.866 --> 02:19:16.147]  Eric Adams and Hogle are just BSing us, of course, because that's what they do.
[02:19:16.147 --> 02:19:17.067]  Oh, great example.
[02:19:17.067 --> 02:19:17.887]  I'm glad you raised this.
[02:19:17.887 --> 02:19:18.608]  I'm going to interrupt for a minute.
[02:19:18.608 --> 02:19:20.048]  I'll give you more time.
[02:19:20.048 --> 02:19:23.809]  Biden's now signed orders to allow a wall to be built.
[02:19:23.809 --> 02:19:24.749]  He tore it down.
[02:19:24.749 --> 02:19:27.150]  He shipped off all the parts to finish it.
[02:19:27.150 --> 02:19:29.430]  But now he's like, oh, I never did this.
[02:19:29.430 --> 02:19:34.491]  As if his constituents are so dumb, they won't know that.
[02:19:34.491 --> 02:19:36.732]  Yeah, and Eric Adams is doing the same thing.
[02:19:37.253 --> 02:19:43.874]  Saying, oh, you know, I woke up today and all of a sudden we're over capacity and we can't take anymore.
[02:19:43.874 --> 02:19:52.576]  But the buses didn't stop and it wasn't until 50, 75 people, more like 100 or 150 people in Staten Island made that place uninhabitable.
[02:19:52.576 --> 02:19:56.236]  And now they're doing it on 31st Street, West 31st.
[02:19:56.236 --> 02:20:05.418]  And in Brooklyn, I got friends, viral news on Twitter, Leroy Press, I think they got footage of camouflaged paramilitary.
[02:20:05.968 --> 02:20:08.950]  Inside the hotel lobby.
[02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:11.372]  And they can basically do whatever they want at any time.
[02:20:11.372 --> 02:20:16.996]  Oh, the New York hotels are full of illegal aliens who they told come here.
[02:20:16.996 --> 02:20:18.217]  I mean, look at this footage.
[02:20:18.217 --> 02:20:19.057]  This is from yesterday.
[02:20:19.057 --> 02:20:21.499]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[02:20:21.499 --> 02:20:21.999]  No, I know.
[02:20:21.999 --> 02:20:23.100]  I saw it yesterday.
[02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:25.922]  That guy, he learned well, Grasshopper, because that's what I did.
[02:20:25.922 --> 02:20:27.483]  Austere Scholar on Rumble.
[02:20:27.483 --> 02:20:33.387]  Have you seen the new footage where they send up private security guards threatening people on the street not to videotape it?
[02:20:34.457 --> 02:20:35.618]  Yeah, the private security guard.
[02:20:35.618 --> 02:20:44.942]  I mean, we dealt with that stuff every time we went out, because we were fighting the monkeypox, we were fighting the infant vaccination sites, and so we were usually surrounded by cops and schmucks like this.
[02:20:44.942 --> 02:20:47.383]  But they have no power, so we know that.
[02:20:47.383 --> 02:20:52.445]  If you stay poised... By the way, are you part of the groups we saw in New York, everywhere protesting the shots?
[02:20:52.445 --> 02:20:54.366]  I remember those viral videos.
[02:20:54.366 --> 02:20:58.768]  Yeah, there was like 150 of us, and we all hung together.
[02:20:58.768 --> 02:21:01.049]  Then at some point... Brother, you helped back them off.
[02:21:01.049 --> 02:21:01.709]  Beautiful.
[02:21:01.709 --> 02:21:03.910]  What's the name of your handle again on Rumble?
[02:21:04.679 --> 02:21:06.179]  Yes, Austere Scholar.
[02:21:06.179 --> 02:21:07.480]  A-U-S-T-E-R-E.
[02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:08.640]  Austere Scholar.
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:10.960]  Thank you so much, brother.
[02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:12.140]  John in Florida.
[02:21:12.140 --> 02:21:14.561]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:21:14.561 --> 02:21:15.481]  Hey, Alex.
[02:21:15.481 --> 02:21:30.124]  You know, as someone who's been a Catholic, I'm 22 years old, been a Catholic my entire life, and you know, as a Catholic, to hear this regime label regular Americans and Catholics and Christians as terrorists, I mean, these are the same people who spent 20 years destabilizing the Middle East.
[02:21:30.124 --> 02:21:31.244]  They create bioweapons.
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:39.885]  They cause food shortages, they cause supply chain breakdowns, they spray chemicals in the air, and they are out committing terrorist acts.
[02:21:39.885 --> 02:21:43.127]  Why do you think they've singled out conservative Catholics as the number one enemy?
[02:21:43.127 --> 02:21:44.768]  That's in the documents.
[02:21:44.768 --> 02:21:54.094]  Because those are the only people, when you actually think about it, like those are the only people who can be self-sufficient and actually, you know, basically be independent from control in the government.
[02:21:54.094 --> 02:21:55.615]  They know how to actually work with their hands.
[02:21:56.946 --> 02:22:03.030]  Well, I just think they saw it as one of the biggest conservative Christian blocs, so they thought they'd kick Catholics around and think you'd roll over.
[02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:03.330]  Right.
[02:22:03.330 --> 02:22:07.132]  And at the end of the day, the thing about Christians and Catholics, though, that
[02:22:24.679 --> 02:22:29.403]  Government isn't God, there's only one God, and there's no human entity that can rule over us.
[02:22:29.403 --> 02:22:35.969]  We only take orders from the big man upstairs, and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates are going to tell me what to do.
[02:22:35.969 --> 02:22:37.070]  What do you think is coming next?
[02:22:37.070 --> 02:22:40.893]  It's a big deal to declare all Trump supporters terrorists.
[02:22:40.893 --> 02:22:42.214]  That's what they did.
[02:22:42.214 --> 02:22:43.655]  I think you're actually right on the money.
[02:22:43.655 --> 02:22:46.598]  I think they're going to either assassinate Trump or Biden, if not both.
[02:22:52.858 --> 02:22:58.060]  I have to agree with you right now.
[02:22:58.060 --> 02:22:59.761]  We can change that, but I have to agree with you.
[02:22:59.761 --> 02:23:04.703]  And if we're sitting here in 13, 14 months and it didn't happen, they'll attack us and say, oh, look, they predicted it.
[02:23:04.703 --> 02:23:06.464]  No, we're saying that's a probability.
[02:23:06.464 --> 02:23:07.804]  We're trying to stop it.
[02:23:07.804 --> 02:23:09.365]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:23:09.365 --> 02:23:10.726]  Tilly in New York, thanks for calling.
[02:23:10.726 --> 02:23:11.026]  Go ahead.
[02:23:14.827 --> 02:23:15.649]  When you look at a U.S.
[02:23:15.649 --> 02:23:20.523]  prosecution, it is not designed to remove constitutional rights or to quiet someone.
[02:23:21.121 --> 02:23:26.564]  All of these law fairs are designed to take someone out of a position of being able to speak or do something.
[02:23:26.564 --> 02:23:35.990]  And the reason why is, I believe, that it happens to be the CCP is trying to make sure that the people that are objecting to them implementing their plans.
[02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.510]  No, no, you're right.
[02:23:36.510 --> 02:23:39.112]  The CCP is the main funder.
[02:23:39.112 --> 02:23:43.394]  Thousands of colleges and public schools, and we're talking rate schools.
[02:23:43.394 --> 02:23:44.755]  Listen, listen to me, listen to me.
[02:23:44.755 --> 02:23:47.817]  If you go back, look at like, I have like seven different examples.
[02:23:48.297 --> 02:23:49.818]  Okay, you're one of them actually.
[02:23:49.818 --> 02:23:57.262]  Flynn, he said in 2016, he made a comment, it's in an article about Russia and China teaming up.
[02:23:57.262 --> 02:24:00.943]  Feinstein was one of the main prosecutors of Trump collusion.
[02:24:00.943 --> 02:24:05.146]  She had a Chinese, a CCP driver for a while.
[02:24:05.146 --> 02:24:08.787]  Lindell, he said China hacked into the election, changed the vote.
[02:24:08.787 --> 02:24:09.968]  Okay, what's going on with him?
[02:24:10.935 --> 02:24:17.619]  You, on March 19th of 2018, your show, I didn't know your show then, your show aired, the most prescient thing I've ever seen.
[02:24:17.619 --> 02:24:25.304]  You've got to pull that episode up, it's still on the web, and you've got to cut it down and get those clips out, and it literally says what's going on right now.
[02:24:25.304 --> 02:24:27.685]  What was the date again?
[02:24:27.685 --> 02:24:29.667]  March 19th, 2018.
[02:24:29.667 --> 02:24:37.091]  It's Richard Knight and Jasper, and the dystopian CCP is going to lead the New World Order into the dystopia.
[02:24:37.091 --> 02:24:38.392]  It is the most prescient thing ever.
[02:24:38.392 --> 02:24:40.033]  Cut the clips down, get them on the web now.
[02:24:40.586 --> 02:24:41.027]  We're good.
[02:24:51.403 --> 02:24:53.405]  And file to get them taken out of power.
[02:24:53.405 --> 02:24:54.826]  These are not prosecutions.
[02:24:54.826 --> 02:25:02.652]  These are offensive tactics to remove people from being able to awaken people and let them see that this is not us fighting each other.
[02:25:02.652 --> 02:25:07.275]  This is actually a coup from a foreign... This is foreign interference.
[02:25:07.275 --> 02:25:13.119]  It's people that are critical of the CCP are being prosecuted by the United... Well, that's the point.
[02:25:13.119 --> 02:25:16.222]  Notice that's the one thing Elon Musk won't do.
[02:25:16.222 --> 02:25:18.684]  Elon Musk is... Talk about the CCP.
[02:25:20.347 --> 02:25:25.648]  And everybody that's still banned on Twitter criticizes CCP.
[02:25:25.648 --> 02:25:26.468]  Check your socials.
[02:25:26.468 --> 02:25:27.849]  I put all this in your socials.
[02:25:27.849 --> 02:25:28.549]  It's in your socials.
[02:25:28.549 --> 02:25:34.370]  Now, the other thing is that the NYPD was not allowed to establish a gang database because it is profiling.
[02:25:34.370 --> 02:25:43.152]  So, therefore, you cannot put a database or categorize a profile based on EEOC violations, which are religion.
[02:25:43.152 --> 02:25:46.213]  But you're allowed to say all Trump supporters are terrorists.
[02:25:47.267 --> 02:25:48.908]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[02:25:48.908 --> 02:26:04.938]  Someone quoted and said that there was a point in time when the CCP infiltrated the United States educational system and had people learn the law so well that they know our law better than us, and that is how they're able to buy our farmland and buy all of our land.
[02:26:04.938 --> 02:26:06.419]  Sure, the globalists are working with them.
[02:26:06.419 --> 02:26:07.760]  So you're a really smart lady.
[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:10.102]  What do you do?
[02:26:10.102 --> 02:26:15.185]  I'd rather not say, but I've been affected by this, and now because I've lost stuff,
[02:26:15.652 --> 02:26:18.333]  I'm going to make sure that this is my goal, is to illuminate it.
[02:26:18.333 --> 02:26:19.653]  But this is the thing, Alex.
[02:26:19.653 --> 02:26:25.155]  You have to get... Everybody can sit there and everybody's an expert in some policy or nomenclature.
[02:26:25.155 --> 02:26:27.115]  Go on, go and look at this.
[02:26:27.115 --> 02:26:30.576]  When you look backwards at the law fair, you're going to see... Oh, James O'Keefe!
[02:26:30.576 --> 02:26:31.657]  I forgot about James O'Keefe.
[02:26:31.657 --> 02:26:33.877]  James O'Keefe just... Look at what they're doing to him.
[02:26:33.877 --> 02:26:35.058]  Mass onslaught?
[02:26:35.058 --> 02:26:35.658]  What did he do?
[02:26:35.658 --> 02:26:39.279]  He just put in that CCP money was funding PAC Blue.
[02:26:39.799 --> 02:26:42.401]  This is not designed for what we think it is.
[02:26:42.401 --> 02:26:44.343]  It's designed to stop people from speaking.
[02:26:44.343 --> 02:26:45.344]  No, you're right.
[02:26:45.344 --> 02:26:50.609]  And we know it was the Catholics out of Portugal that first made inroads in China 500 years ago.
[02:26:50.609 --> 02:26:52.830]  So they have a close relationship.
[02:26:52.830 --> 02:26:56.674]  And the Catholic Church tried to get in again, but Jeezy Pig's kicking them out.
[02:26:56.674 --> 02:26:59.776]  So you wonder, why would they choose the Catholics to go after?
[02:26:59.776 --> 02:27:02.539]  And you can literally see the CCP print on that.
[02:27:04.460 --> 02:27:10.564]  It's literally to target, it's an effective way of using the legal system to target the largest group of people.
[02:27:10.564 --> 02:27:12.366]  Alex, there's another website you have to go to.
[02:27:12.366 --> 02:27:14.387]  Committee for the Present Danger on China.
[02:27:14.387 --> 02:27:18.170]  They have webinars that have academics that are explaining.
[02:27:18.170 --> 02:27:20.852]  One of them involves how ESG is actually
[02:27:22.238 --> 02:27:27.921]  The CCP expression of socialism and explains how ESG is part of the social credit score.
[02:27:27.921 --> 02:27:30.323]  Sure, China developed that with Enron.
[02:27:30.323 --> 02:27:33.965]  They say that's how they bring communism and capitalism together.
[02:27:33.965 --> 02:27:35.506]  Incredible call.
[02:27:35.506 --> 02:27:36.867]  Thank you so much, Tilly.
[02:27:36.867 --> 02:27:37.788]  Amazing.
[02:27:37.788 --> 02:27:39.469]  Wow, what a smart lady.
[02:27:39.469 --> 02:27:42.791]  We're going to go to break and come back with Mike and John.
[02:27:42.791 --> 02:27:44.232]  John's up next, Sheriff's Deputy.
[02:27:45.092 --> 02:27:49.076]  In Texas, in a former Marine on martial law situation.
[02:27:49.076 --> 02:27:50.757]  And again, folks, I'm not trying to act tough here.
[02:27:50.757 --> 02:27:54.480]  It's not like, oh yeah, you're gonna fight with the Patriots, we'll destroy the Feds.
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:57.903]  It's our government, they're hijacked.
[02:27:57.903 --> 02:28:01.005]  Are the Feds dumb enough to follow the New World Order orders and start a civil war?
[02:28:01.005 --> 02:28:04.348]  I mean, that's the stupidest thing ever.
[02:28:04.348 --> 02:28:10.894]  So this is not some type of dick measuring contest here where we're gonna show the Feds, we're gonna, we'll, we'll, yeah.
[02:28:11.906 --> 02:28:13.047]  And then we wrecked the whole country.
[02:28:13.047 --> 02:28:14.508]  We've got to come together.
[02:28:14.508 --> 02:28:16.691]  We've got to have the Fed stop being part of this.
[02:28:16.691 --> 02:28:18.312]  We can't be part of this.
[02:28:18.312 --> 02:28:23.557]  We've got to identify that this is a New World Order takeover operation.
[02:28:23.557 --> 02:28:25.519]  Information and truth is going to defeat it!
[02:28:26.775 --> 02:28:29.217]  Every time I tell a truth that's really powerful, I get a little chill.
[02:28:29.217 --> 02:28:30.698]  Got a big chill right there.
[02:28:30.698 --> 02:28:32.419]  We can do this, folks.
[02:28:32.419 --> 02:28:34.241]  We don't want a race war.
[02:28:34.241 --> 02:28:36.282]  And sure, the left's made it open season on white people.
[02:28:36.282 --> 02:28:37.864]  It's terrible and people should be prosecuted.
[02:28:37.864 --> 02:28:41.066]  But the New World Order is manipulating that.
[02:28:41.066 --> 02:28:41.927]  And all the rest of it.
[02:28:41.927 --> 02:28:46.731]  We've got to come together and see the big picture and defeat the New World Order.
[02:28:46.731 --> 02:28:50.233]  And we've got to have Congress cut the funding of the Justice Department now.
[02:28:50.233 --> 02:28:53.576]  We've got to put Trump as the Speaker of the House now, now, now.
[02:28:53.576 --> 02:28:54.817]  And Trump says he'll take that job.
[02:29:00.168 --> 02:29:02.431]  Last year we put this book out.
[02:29:02.431 --> 02:29:03.852]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:29:03.852 --> 02:29:06.215]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[02:29:06.215 --> 02:29:09.999]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[02:29:09.999 --> 02:29:10.980]  The Great Awakening.
[02:29:10.980 --> 02:29:15.245]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[02:29:15.245 --> 02:29:17.287]  This is such a powerful book.
[02:29:17.287 --> 02:29:18.989]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[02:29:19.650 --> 02:29:19.970]  I think so.
[02:29:38.789 --> 02:29:46.533]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[02:29:46.533 --> 02:29:53.117]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to Infowarstore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[02:29:53.117 --> 02:29:54.617]  This is going to go to number one.
[02:29:54.617 --> 02:29:55.838]  I want to thank you for your support.
[02:29:55.838 --> 02:29:56.879]  It's a powerful book.
[02:29:56.879 --> 02:29:57.419]  Get yours now.
[02:29:58.431 --> 02:30:06.634]  The most powerful Wimp Wars life formula yet, DNA Force Plus is now back in stock for 25% off while supplies last.

[02:30:16.999 --> 02:30:25.102]  The powerhouse ingredients in DNA Force Plus include QQQ, CoQ10, organic reishi mushroom, astrologous root,
[02:30:25.382 --> 02:30:26.123]  We're good to go!
[02:30:48.360 --> 02:30:59.043]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[02:30:59.043 --> 02:30:59.984]  I thought it was next week.
[02:30:59.984 --> 02:31:04.405]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[02:31:04.405 --> 02:31:06.625]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:31:06.625 --> 02:31:10.467]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[02:31:10.467 --> 02:31:12.367]  Overhead shot, please.
[02:31:12.367 --> 02:31:14.968]  Look how full this bottle is.
[02:31:16.514 --> 02:31:19.456]  Right to the top, folks.
[02:31:19.456 --> 02:31:25.320]  Right to the top with these 95% curcuminoids.
[02:31:25.320 --> 02:31:29.523]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10%.
[02:31:29.523 --> 02:31:32.225]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[02:31:32.225 --> 02:31:36.147]  This is 95%.
[02:31:36.147 --> 02:31:37.108]  Super constant.
[02:31:37.108 --> 02:31:40.990]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[02:31:40.990 --> 02:31:42.451]  It's that powerful.
[02:31:42.451 --> 02:31:43.612]  Or more.
[02:31:43.612 --> 02:31:45.734]  So they're available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:47.130 --> 02:31:49.735]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.

[02:31:57.731 --> 02:32:04.116]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[02:32:04.116 --> 02:32:10.540]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[02:32:10.540 --> 02:32:13.883]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[02:32:13.883 --> 02:32:23.069]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[02:32:23.069 --> 02:32:23.510]  Look it up.
[02:32:24.130 --> 02:32:25.491]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[02:32:25.491 --> 02:32:28.713]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.

[02:32:36.958 --> 02:32:38.398]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[02:32:38.398 --> 02:32:39.399]  It is amazing.
[02:32:39.399 --> 02:32:41.020]  It's great for your home, your business.
[02:32:41.020 --> 02:32:44.242]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[02:32:44.242 --> 02:32:45.663]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[02:32:45.663 --> 02:32:49.425]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[02:32:49.665 --> 02:32:52.086]  Get yours today at Infowarshore.com for a limited time.

[02:32:54.668 --> 02:32:56.089]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[02:32:56.089 --> 02:32:59.370]  You need this filter.
[02:32:59.370 --> 02:33:05.274]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:14.444 --> 02:33:20.826]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.826 --> 02:33:22.406]  They're coming for Trump.
[02:33:22.406 --> 02:33:23.886]  They're coming for Mike Lindell.
[02:33:23.886 --> 02:33:26.787]  They're coming for me, because they're coming for you.
[02:33:26.787 --> 02:33:30.048]  Mike Lindell's got some devastating news.
[02:33:30.048 --> 02:33:34.049]  Joining us next segment, I'll continue on to get your calls done before the next guest host takes over.
[02:33:34.049 --> 02:33:37.589]  We'll get to every caller that's on the board, but let's stop a piece.
[02:33:37.589 --> 02:33:39.010]  We got John Jayden.
[02:33:39.930 --> 02:33:45.315]  Dave, Dave, Carlos, Randy, Adam, Blade Runner, Mike, we'll get to all of you.
[02:33:45.315 --> 02:33:50.620]  John is a sheriff's deputy and a former Marine, always a Marine, on a martial law situation.
[02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:52.342]  I mean, folks, I cannot overstate this.
[02:33:53.953 --> 02:33:55.114]  Hello Alex, can you hear me?
[02:33:55.114 --> 02:33:55.474]  Yes, I can.
[02:34:21.340 --> 02:34:29.845]  I served eight years in the Marine Corps, and around my fourth year in the Marine Corps, my sergeant asked me, what's going to happen to your soul when you die?
[02:34:29.845 --> 02:34:31.866]  I said, I'm going straight to hell.
[02:34:31.866 --> 02:34:35.928]  He led me through the prayer of salvation in Romans 10, 9, and I became a Christian.
[02:34:35.928 --> 02:34:36.629]  Okay.
[02:34:36.629 --> 02:34:42.192]  You have something right, and you've had it all along, and I'll tell you what it is.
[02:34:42.192 --> 02:34:48.256]  There's crystals in our head that render us as communication devices throughout the earth.
[02:34:48.256 --> 02:34:48.516]  Okay.
[02:34:49.281 --> 02:34:51.262]  By the way, you're not just saying that.
[02:34:51.262 --> 02:34:56.506]  How do ducks know how to fly from Canada all the way to Central America?
[02:34:56.506 --> 02:34:58.387]  How do butterflies?
[02:34:58.387 --> 02:34:59.448]  It's been proven.
[02:34:59.448 --> 02:35:01.349]  This is like Scientific American.
[02:35:01.349 --> 02:35:11.456]  We all have cones, little electric crystals in our brains that electromagnetically dial into the Earth's magnetic field, but also other forms of solar radiation.
[02:35:11.456 --> 02:35:11.816]  It's true.
[02:35:11.816 --> 02:35:12.337]  Go ahead.
[02:35:12.337 --> 02:35:13.157]  So it's a third eye.
[02:35:13.157 --> 02:35:14.698]  It literally exists.
[02:35:14.698 --> 02:35:15.018]  Right.
[02:35:15.018 --> 02:35:16.459]  So here's how we win the battle.
[02:35:16.459 --> 02:35:17.380]  Okay, check this out.
[02:35:18.635 --> 02:35:21.377]  I served 30 years in the Sheriff's Office.
[02:35:21.377 --> 02:35:24.419]  We were always underfunded, undermanned.
[02:35:24.419 --> 02:35:29.141]  I was always alone, and I've done a lot of law enforcement in my 30 years.
[02:35:29.141 --> 02:35:30.982]  I mean, a lot of sheriffing.
[02:35:30.982 --> 02:35:33.684]  Now, I'm going to tell you, here's how we win the battle.
[02:35:33.684 --> 02:35:37.986]  The battle is already three-quarters of the way won when Roe vs. Wade was overturned.
[02:35:37.986 --> 02:35:47.752]  Now, last night, I couldn't sleep, and the Lord, in His grace and His timing, gave me the answer first thing this morning when I woke up to pray, and I'm going to tell you what it is.
[02:35:49.833 --> 02:35:57.458]  The Lord told me that we have to release the 10 plagues in our thought, in a thought and mind and prayer experiment right now.
[02:35:57.458 --> 02:35:58.459]  Okay, here's what it is.
[02:35:58.459 --> 02:36:12.988]  We're releasing the water turned to blood, the frogs, the lice, the flies, the livestock being killed, the subterranean livestock that are hidden under underground caves, boils, hail, locusts, darkness, and
[02:36:13.570 --> 02:36:15.691]  Now, this is not me, this is in the Bible.
[02:36:15.691 --> 02:36:18.192]  It's the killing of the enemy's firstborn.
[02:36:18.192 --> 02:36:21.353]  So you're saying you have to do what Moses did?
[02:36:21.353 --> 02:36:21.853]  Exactly.
[02:36:21.853 --> 02:36:22.854]  Not me, all of us.
[02:36:22.854 --> 02:36:30.317]  So right now, in Jesus' name, let us all just launch the ten plagues upon the globalists and the Nimrodites.
[02:36:30.317 --> 02:36:34.719]  Just take a second and launch it in your mind.
[02:36:34.719 --> 02:36:36.480]  Okay, we've done that.
[02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:37.360]  So now watch this.
[02:36:38.681 --> 02:36:40.803]  I served 30 years in the Sheriff's Office.
[02:36:40.803 --> 02:36:45.086]  There's not enough cops to do what the enemy is trying to do to us.
[02:36:45.086 --> 02:36:50.870]  And the current cops that they have don't have the stuff like I did to be able to get the job done.
[02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:52.051]  It's all a psyop.
[02:36:52.051 --> 02:36:53.151]  They cannot prosper.
[02:36:53.151 --> 02:36:54.392]  They cannot win.
[02:36:54.392 --> 02:36:54.933]  I know.
[02:36:54.933 --> 02:36:55.553]  I've lived it.
[02:36:55.553 --> 02:36:56.114]  I've been it.
[02:36:56.114 --> 02:36:57.895]  I've been a cop for 30 years.
[02:36:57.895 --> 02:36:59.376]  I've been retired two years now.
[02:36:59.376 --> 02:37:01.017]  And I let me tell you something.
[02:37:01.017 --> 02:37:02.838]  I know how to get the job done.
[02:37:02.838 --> 02:37:04.440]  And I'm going to tell you something else.
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:04.960]  No cop
[02:37:05.763 --> 02:37:10.025]  And the average cop's not bad, but our governments are now illegitimate in most areas.
[02:37:27.213 --> 02:37:36.177]  Well, I'm going to tell you, the current cops right now, they just don't have enough or they don't have the wherewithal to carry out the desires of these people, at least not in America.
[02:37:36.177 --> 02:37:38.458]  Maybe in China, maybe in some place.
[02:37:38.458 --> 02:37:41.839]  I was about to say, but the FBI is saying they don't want to do this.
[02:37:41.839 --> 02:37:45.341]  I mean, obviously, who wants to fight 80 million people?
[02:37:45.341 --> 02:37:45.861]  I'm telling you.
[02:37:45.861 --> 02:37:48.682]  And the next thing is stand your ground.
[02:37:48.682 --> 02:37:50.183]  Just stand your ground.
[02:37:50.183 --> 02:37:51.063]  Stand your ground.
[02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:55.834]  with the full armor of God as it is written in Ephesians chapter 6.
[02:37:55.834 --> 02:37:59.698]  Alex, you know the answer, but we haven't connected all the dots.
[02:37:59.698 --> 02:38:02.100]  The answer is simple, that thought experiment.
[02:38:02.100 --> 02:38:10.889]  Father God, in Jesus' name, we launch the ten plagues of Egypt, we launch them upon the New World Order.
[02:38:10.889 --> 02:38:13.671]  We launch it back at them and let them deal with God.
[02:38:13.671 --> 02:38:15.813]  John, I appreciate your call.
[02:38:16.721 --> 02:38:25.347]  I'm not going to say I'm Moses and I believe God touched you and we should talk about this, but he literally called in the angel of death to kill the firstborn of the Egyptians.
[02:38:25.347 --> 02:38:36.675]  I'm not, when you said all that, I just, it's, it's, it's, I got to pray about that because you kind of hit me there and I just, I'm not praying for people to die and stuff.
[02:38:36.675 --> 02:38:39.437]  I hear what you're saying that people feel led to say that prayer.
[02:38:39.437 --> 02:38:41.098]  That's sweet in the name of God.
[02:38:41.098 --> 02:38:43.260]  And I, because I know the power of prayer.
[02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:43.420]  So,
[02:38:45.431 --> 02:38:48.432]  I just, that's some big medicine right there, buddy.
[02:38:48.432 --> 02:38:50.873]  All right, let's go to Mike in New York.
[02:38:50.873 --> 02:38:51.633]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:38:51.633 --> 02:38:54.474]  Welcome.
[02:38:54.474 --> 02:38:55.114]  Hey, Alex.
[02:38:55.114 --> 02:38:57.755]  Thanks for taking the call.
[02:38:57.755 --> 02:39:04.197]  And just wanted to talk about stuff that I'm seeing most recently with the migrant crisis here in the city.
[02:39:04.197 --> 02:39:06.277]  It's just getting out of control.
[02:39:06.277 --> 02:39:10.779]  I happen to be working... And by the way, I call it migrants too, people know, but it's illegal alien crisis.
[02:39:10.779 --> 02:39:12.959]  Yeah, you're 100% right.
[02:39:12.959 --> 02:39:14.920]  The illegal aliens, they're all
[02:39:15.695 --> 02:39:16.295]  Over the place.
[02:39:16.295 --> 02:39:23.139]  The videos that you had up on the screen earlier of the Roe Hotel, which has made a lot of news, I happen to be working right there.
[02:39:23.139 --> 02:39:28.002]  And what I see on a daily basis, it's just getting worse and worse.
[02:39:28.002 --> 02:39:33.525]  They've got young women sitting in the middle of the street, breastfeeding in broad daylight.
[02:39:33.525 --> 02:39:40.609]  You got little kids running into the middle of 8th Avenue, which is one of the biggest, busiest streets in Manhattan.
[02:39:40.609 --> 02:39:42.890]  I mean, it's just completely out of control.
[02:39:42.890 --> 02:39:44.311]  And if you go there at 730 in the morning,
[02:39:45.273 --> 02:39:47.235]  What, 3.30 in the afternoon?
[02:39:47.235 --> 02:39:55.042]  Hey, that school bus is pulling up, and all these kids are getting loaded onto the bus, going to the nearby public schools, getting loaded off the bus.
[02:39:55.042 --> 02:40:06.572]  So then you've got people that have paid two, three million dollars to live in these high-rise apartments, and now their kids are going to the same school as somebody that just got here yesterday.
[02:40:06.572 --> 02:40:08.854]  It's completely out of control.
[02:40:08.854 --> 02:40:10.235]  The crime is out of control.
[02:40:11.132 --> 02:40:17.399]  My entire life walking through Manhattan, walking through the city, I've never felt unsafe until the last couple of years.
[02:40:17.399 --> 02:40:24.527]  Now every day I walk outside, I got my head on a swivel, because I just feel like somebody's going to walk up behind me and club me over the head.
[02:40:25.239 --> 02:40:26.079]  And I'm ready.
[02:40:26.079 --> 02:40:29.040]  It's just ridiculous that you have to live like this.
[02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:33.502]  And what's really sad is all the leftist members of Congress are getting carjacked every day.
[02:40:33.502 --> 02:40:37.143]  I mean, murder everywhere.
[02:40:37.143 --> 02:40:38.264]  I'm not just watching the news.
[02:40:38.264 --> 02:40:39.884]  I see it in Austin.
[02:40:39.884 --> 02:40:43.825]  I went to the mall earlier this week to buy some clothes for a podcast I'm doing next week.
[02:40:43.825 --> 02:40:45.546]  Pretty big podcast I should have.
[02:40:45.546 --> 02:40:48.387]  And I love black people.
[02:40:48.387 --> 02:40:50.688]  But I had two black people say, what are you doing here, Whitey?
[02:40:51.648 --> 02:40:53.469]  You don't have to even see what's on the news.
[02:40:53.469 --> 02:40:54.489]  You see it with your own eyes.
[02:40:54.489 --> 02:40:55.370]  That's the thing.
[02:40:55.370 --> 02:40:57.251]  And what I want to say is though, what I think
[02:41:12.836 --> 02:41:29.066]  Is that this one topic could be the breaking point that galvanizes more and more people, because over the past couple of months, and especially over the past few weeks, I've had conversations with people that are completely the opposite side of the spectrum politically, and they're starting to see it now.
[02:41:29.066 --> 02:41:30.066]  No, I totally agree.
[02:41:30.066 --> 02:41:31.807]  God bless you, and I appreciate the call, sir.
[02:41:31.807 --> 02:41:32.208]  Thank you.
[02:41:32.208 --> 02:41:33.468]  I've got to talk to all these scholars.
[02:41:33.468 --> 02:41:33.889]  Ten hours.
[02:41:33.889 --> 02:41:35.230]  We've got to get to everybody.
[02:41:35.230 --> 02:41:36.170]  And I want to explain something.
[02:41:36.170 --> 02:41:42.294]  I was brought up as a Christian conservative, and that white people had done bad things in America, but the whole world's done bad things.
[02:41:43.506 --> 02:41:44.307]  And I love everybody.
[02:41:44.307 --> 02:41:46.168]  There's so many good people of every color.
[02:41:46.168 --> 02:41:48.049]  But I'm not guilty because I'm white.
[02:41:48.049 --> 02:41:50.011]  I'm not bad because I'm white.
[02:41:50.011 --> 02:41:52.833]  And I want to talk to black people out there.
[02:41:52.833 --> 02:41:58.237]  How many black people have actually had white people sit there and tell them, get out of here, you're a scum, you shouldn't be here.
[02:41:58.237 --> 02:41:59.758]  Imagine how that feels.
[02:41:59.758 --> 02:42:02.019]  So I heard about that happening to your parents and grandparents.
[02:42:02.019 --> 02:42:02.880]  I said that was wrong.
[02:42:05.222 --> 02:42:07.283]  And I'm not blaming all black people.
[02:42:07.283 --> 02:42:12.707]  I'm saying we need more black people to speak out against this because the left's already caused a race war.
[02:42:12.707 --> 02:42:15.589]  Twenty to one attacks on white people.
[02:42:15.589 --> 02:42:18.911]  And I feel sorry for other black folks that aren't part of this.
[02:42:18.911 --> 02:42:23.974]  It's a certain demographic of young black males that they brainwashed that being white is evil.
[02:42:23.974 --> 02:42:25.475]  That's what they teach.
[02:42:25.475 --> 02:42:29.438]  Well they taught the Germans that Jews were bad so they deserved to be attacked.
[02:42:29.438 --> 02:42:30.119]  It's wrong.
[02:42:30.939 --> 02:42:32.380]  And I blame the ADL.
[02:42:32.380 --> 02:42:36.543]  They are the main group that is teaching this crap.
[02:42:36.543 --> 02:42:39.344]  And it's disgusting.
[02:42:39.344 --> 02:42:41.366]  The ADL makes me want to throw up.
[02:42:41.366 --> 02:42:45.828]  Because I actually care about everybody.
[02:42:45.828 --> 02:42:46.489]  But I'm telling you.
[02:42:47.822 --> 02:42:49.563]  I'm going to go to the NAACP.
[02:42:49.563 --> 02:42:51.203]  I'm going to go to the ADL.
[02:42:51.203 --> 02:43:00.327]  I'm going to start going to these leftist synagogues that promote that white Christians are bad people, and I'm going to start bullhorning them and accusing them of what they are.
[02:43:00.327 --> 02:43:02.588]  The closest things to the Nazis I've seen in my life.
[02:43:02.588 --> 02:43:06.730]  Race-based groups trying to make us all kill each other because I'm getting pissed.
[02:43:08.114 --> 02:43:09.555]  Let me tell you something.
[02:43:09.555 --> 02:43:10.915]  It's bad.
[02:43:10.915 --> 02:43:14.977]  And Austin's not in the top bad cities in the country for this stuff.
[02:43:14.977 --> 02:43:19.420]  But to be a white person now more and more is to be put down and demonized and attacked.
[02:43:19.420 --> 02:43:23.682]  And I've done nothing to you!
[02:43:23.682 --> 02:43:27.804]  So I tell the black folks that are buying into this, you're under the mind control of the ADL.
[02:43:29.505 --> 02:43:31.606]  And I'm trying to save all of us, man.
[02:43:31.606 --> 02:43:35.147]  So you better, you better get your house in order because you're playing right on their plan.
[02:43:35.147 --> 02:43:38.949]  Just like I tell the Patriots, don't get in a shooting war with the feds.
[02:43:38.949 --> 02:43:41.690]  Don't get set up by them.
[02:43:41.690 --> 02:43:43.611]  Doesn't mean there's not bad stuff happening to black people.
[02:43:43.611 --> 02:43:44.351]  I get that.
[02:43:44.351 --> 02:43:48.913]  The point is, is that we have got to see the big picture here.
[02:43:48.913 --> 02:43:50.354]  I'm getting pissed off now, man.
[02:43:50.354 --> 02:43:52.775]  Does that mean I can see it all going down?
[02:43:54.674 --> 02:44:01.399]  And it's all these leftist professors and people that are trying to get us to kill each other, and it's stupid!
[02:44:01.399 --> 02:44:04.040]  They're trying to give us all poison shots.
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:05.381]  Ernest Ramirez is Hispanic.
[02:44:05.381 --> 02:44:06.622]  His son died when he was shot.
[02:44:06.622 --> 02:44:08.343]  There's all these black people dying.
[02:44:08.343 --> 02:44:12.346]  They're killing everybody with these shots.
[02:44:12.346 --> 02:44:13.827]  Look at this story.
[02:44:13.827 --> 02:44:17.350]  High school senior collapses, dies suddenly in a homecoming game.
[02:44:17.350 --> 02:44:20.672]  A 14-year-old girl took the shot, died of a giant heart attack.
[02:44:22.090 --> 02:44:23.991]  They're hitting us all, man!
[02:44:23.991 --> 02:44:30.596]  Let's stop killing each other, it's stupid!
[02:44:30.596 --> 02:44:35.079]  And I've seen some of the black supremacist groups go, well, oh, Jones doesn't like it.
[02:44:35.079 --> 02:44:36.840]  On WorldStarHipHop and the rest of it.
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:38.802]  Jones is begging the black people to be nice.
[02:44:38.802 --> 02:44:40.043]  You're getting yours now.
[02:44:40.043 --> 02:44:42.164]  I didn't do anything to you!
[02:44:42.164 --> 02:44:46.447]  My parents or grandparents or their great-grandparents didn't do anything to you!
[02:44:46.447 --> 02:44:47.288]  And you're being taught
[02:44:48.786 --> 02:44:52.327]  To hate me for what color I am, and all I'm trying to do is fix things.
[02:44:52.327 --> 02:44:57.488]  And I'm telling you, a lot of white people who weren't racist are buying into this now.
[02:44:57.488 --> 02:45:01.008]  And you're getting set up.
[02:45:01.008 --> 02:45:03.049]  All right.
[02:45:03.049 --> 02:45:08.350]  We're going to go to Mike Lindell now with some really bad news.
[02:45:08.350 --> 02:45:14.191]  And we got debanked when Mike was on a week ago with us, two weeks ago.
[02:45:15.913 --> 02:45:17.594]  I guess technically we're going to have a go.
[02:45:17.594 --> 02:45:20.256]  And I didn't make it about us because, you know, Mike's doing a great job.
[02:45:20.256 --> 02:45:23.459]  He's got his big network with all these big hosts reaching tens of millions of people a day.
[02:45:23.459 --> 02:45:30.223]  And they're scared of entrepreneur business owners that put their money into the fight against tyranny because the more do it, it's game over.
[02:45:30.223 --> 02:45:35.768]  So I didn't tell him that when he was saying, hey, we just got debanked, I was, you know, it hit the AP the next day that we were debanked.
[02:45:35.768 --> 02:45:38.450]  It's like the ninth or 10th time.
[02:45:38.450 --> 02:45:41.352]  But I could tell with the attack he's under what was coming next.
[02:45:42.386 --> 02:45:52.012]  Because what they do is, they get these lawyers in the first wave, then you gotta learn about it, get better ones, and vet them, and then notice we've been winning since we got lawyers that weren't operatives.
[02:45:52.012 --> 02:45:58.296]  And not all the lawyers we have are operatives, but they get threatened, they get told stuff, they could have their bar card taken away.
[02:45:58.296 --> 02:46:07.942]  They set you up, and they get all your money, and then they tee you up, once they've gotten it, to blow your case.
[02:46:09.246 --> 02:46:11.687]  So Mike texted me about an hour ago and said, can I come on tomorrow?
[02:46:11.687 --> 02:46:13.408]  And I said, you can.
[02:46:13.408 --> 02:46:16.369]  How about you come on today?
[02:46:16.369 --> 02:46:19.530]  So Mike Lindell has the big story for you.
[02:46:19.530 --> 02:46:22.111]  And again, they're moving against everybody.
[02:46:22.111 --> 02:46:27.513]  Because Mike Lindell's got white people and black people and brown people working at his factories in the U.S.
[02:46:27.513 --> 02:46:28.513]  And he loves you all.
[02:46:28.513 --> 02:46:29.513]  He's a Christian.
[02:46:29.513 --> 02:46:31.334]  That's why they don't like Mike Lindell.
[02:46:31.334 --> 02:46:34.155]  He's not doing race politics.
[02:46:34.155 --> 02:46:36.336]  He's doing human, pro-human politics.
[02:46:38.513 --> 02:46:40.775]  So now they got the IRS after him.
[02:46:40.775 --> 02:46:43.558]  He already got audited.
[02:46:43.558 --> 02:46:45.520]  Came back, we were owed money.
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:48.022]  So, but the point is they're hitting him from every angle.
[02:46:48.022 --> 02:46:49.183]  And they're about to make an example.
[02:46:49.183 --> 02:46:51.426]  They know Mike's not going to back down.
[02:46:51.426 --> 02:46:56.070]  But they want to make an example of him to intimidate you.
[02:46:56.070 --> 02:46:58.653]  Do you really think you're going to be safer rolling over?
[02:46:59.787 --> 02:47:00.627]  Because there's nowhere to run.
[02:47:00.627 --> 02:47:01.748]  I mean, I've grown up.
[02:47:01.748 --> 02:47:04.229]  When I was younger, Dallas was rough.
[02:47:04.229 --> 02:47:05.490]  I liked it, actually.
[02:47:05.490 --> 02:47:12.353]  Somebody mouthed off to me, even though they were bigger than me, a lot bigger than me, I had this thing where I didn't back down.
[02:47:12.353 --> 02:47:13.473]  And I got into fighting.
[02:47:13.473 --> 02:47:16.415]  And I got hurt bad.
[02:47:16.415 --> 02:47:19.496]  But, and I've hurt some people really bad.
[02:47:19.496 --> 02:47:21.937]  I certainly gave way worse than I got most times.
[02:47:21.937 --> 02:47:26.539]  But the point is, is I've learned now, it doesn't matter what some idiot wants to fight.
[02:47:26.539 --> 02:47:27.700]  I just say, okay, yes sir.
[02:47:28.902 --> 02:47:32.765]  Because I've got more important things to do.
[02:47:32.765 --> 02:47:37.829]  But the issue I get here is the fight with the globalists is the fight you want to be in.
[02:47:37.829 --> 02:47:40.151]  So this is exclusive.
[02:47:40.151 --> 02:47:52.802]  Mike Lindell of MyPillow.com, What the Enemy Fears, is with us now to break exclusive information right now in their concerted effort to take him down ahead of the election in 13 months.
[02:47:52.802 --> 02:47:54.303]  Mike Lindell, God bless you, brother.
[02:47:54.303 --> 02:47:55.104]  Give us the bad news.
[02:47:56.385 --> 02:47:58.027]  Well, I'm just reading here.
[02:47:58.027 --> 02:47:58.688]  It's all over.
[02:47:58.688 --> 02:48:02.632]  I've had CNN, New York Times, Politico, the Daily Mail.
[02:48:02.632 --> 02:48:03.713]  This is the big one.
[02:48:03.713 --> 02:48:06.236]  They're all attacking and piling on.
[02:48:06.236 --> 02:48:17.029]  Today, this morning at 10.30, all the lawyers for MyPillow and Mike Lindell dropped us on our cases with Dominion and Smartmatic and Harry Coomer.
[02:48:17.849 --> 02:48:19.770]  And I want to say something, though.
[02:48:19.770 --> 02:48:22.312]  These lawyers, this is all part of lawfare.
[02:48:22.312 --> 02:48:24.453]  These lawyers were brave lawyers.
[02:48:24.453 --> 02:48:25.434]  They came on with me.
[02:48:25.434 --> 02:48:27.235]  They've been with me two years.
[02:48:27.235 --> 02:48:29.416]  They have sat there and fought and fought.
[02:48:29.416 --> 02:48:30.217]  They have children.
[02:48:30.217 --> 02:48:31.518]  They have grandchildren.
[02:48:31.518 --> 02:48:33.159]  These lawyers were brave enough.
[02:48:33.159 --> 02:48:37.461]  They knew they were going to get attacked by the media, which they did every day.
[02:48:37.461 --> 02:48:41.524]  They knew that they were going to get, you know, maybe we're going to try and disbar you.
[02:48:41.524 --> 02:48:42.324]  Who knows, you know?
[02:48:44.225 --> 02:48:53.390]  What happened was, Alex, with all the media that's been on me since the $5 million corrupt challenge, which doesn't get done until next year.
[02:48:53.390 --> 02:48:55.471]  Mike Lindell lost $5 million.
[02:48:55.471 --> 02:48:56.191]  Rubbish.
[02:48:56.191 --> 02:48:57.732]  That doesn't happen until next year.
[02:48:57.732 --> 02:49:00.634]  Then a month later, they go, Mike Lindell has an auction.
[02:49:00.634 --> 02:49:01.494]  He's selling out.
[02:49:01.494 --> 02:49:02.275]  He's going under.
[02:49:02.275 --> 02:49:03.735]  My pillow's going under.
[02:49:03.735 --> 02:49:08.938]  Then American Express debanks us, takes us from a million down, takes our line of credit away.
[02:49:09.638 --> 02:49:12.060]  I could not even borrow any money.
[02:49:12.060 --> 02:49:15.103]  Again, all my credit lines are shut down.
[02:49:15.103 --> 02:49:16.604]  They're going, we're not going to borrow you anything.
[02:49:16.604 --> 02:49:17.945]  We're not going to touch you.
[02:49:17.945 --> 02:49:19.166]  So we ran out of money.
[02:49:19.166 --> 02:49:20.847]  We can't pay the attorneys.
[02:49:20.847 --> 02:49:22.048]  They have families.
[02:49:22.048 --> 02:49:25.051]  I said, I can't, I can't blame them for doing this.
[02:49:25.051 --> 02:49:26.732]  My employees here, I just got off the phone.
[02:49:26.732 --> 02:49:27.953]  Well, Mike, I mean, I'll tell you, I do.
[02:49:27.953 --> 02:49:29.454]  They took a ton of money from you.
[02:49:29.454 --> 02:49:33.758]  And I know I've heard about how much they got paid and they're supposed to stay in a case once that's going.
[02:49:33.758 --> 02:49:34.839]  So you're being a nice guy.
[02:49:34.839 --> 02:49:36.980]  No, they're cutting and running.
[02:49:36.980 --> 02:49:38.522]  And I think it's disgraceful.
[02:49:40.030 --> 02:49:43.997]  Well, I think, you know, I'm going to disagree on that, Alex.
[02:49:43.997 --> 02:49:45.961]  I mean, they've got six lawsuits.
[02:49:45.961 --> 02:49:47.423]  These were unprecedented lawsuits.
[02:49:47.423 --> 02:49:47.784]  No, I know.
[02:49:47.784 --> 02:49:50.489]  They've got giant globalist groups coming after them.
[02:49:50.489 --> 02:49:51.470]  So tell us what's happening.
[02:49:51.470 --> 02:49:52.111]  Tell us what we can do.
[02:49:52.847 --> 02:49:56.709]  Yeah, I just think that they, you know, this is part of lawfare.
[02:49:56.709 --> 02:50:01.511]  What part of lawfare is, run the person out of money so he shuts up.
[02:50:01.511 --> 02:50:02.911]  Just run him out of money.
[02:50:02.911 --> 02:50:05.912]  You're saying, well, we don't want to hear our First Amendment right of free speech.
[02:50:05.912 --> 02:50:07.213]  Let's run you out of money.
[02:50:07.213 --> 02:50:08.673]  So you can't pay your attorneys.
[02:50:08.673 --> 02:50:09.694]  So you can't do this.
[02:50:10.134 --> 02:50:11.634]  People have to go, look you're like
[02:50:32.910 --> 02:50:36.012]  Stalingrad in World War II, where most of World War II happened.
[02:50:36.012 --> 02:50:39.373]  They pick a city, they pick a person, they pick a thing, that's where the fight is.
[02:50:39.373 --> 02:50:42.515]  Trump, Lindell, Jones, we're where the fight is.
[02:50:42.515 --> 02:50:51.859]  So if people don't get that backing up, if people are dumb and don't get that we're the main targets and that that's where the fight is to support us, then whatever.
[02:50:51.859 --> 02:50:52.899]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:50:52.899 --> 02:51:00.343]  Yeah, if you could, I'll tell you what, and I went on a couple of shows today, you're with me in the third, and
[02:51:01.940 --> 02:51:04.782]  Everyone has poured in support for MyPillow.
[02:51:04.782 --> 02:51:07.204]  Buying our products, that's all we can do.
[02:51:07.204 --> 02:51:10.906]  I just got off the phone, I got off of Zoom with all my employees.
[02:51:10.906 --> 02:51:12.567]  I said, we will get through this.
[02:51:12.567 --> 02:51:19.392]  I said, we have great support from the people out there buying our products.
[02:51:19.392 --> 02:51:21.233]  And that's what it's all about.
[02:51:21.233 --> 02:51:23.214]  Remember, we've lost our shopping channel.
[02:51:23.214 --> 02:51:24.054]  Mike, I know this.
[02:51:24.054 --> 02:51:26.176]  If you shut down next week, which is not going to happen,
[02:51:28.487 --> 02:51:31.308]  Then the people will go, oh my God, we better give you money.
[02:51:31.308 --> 02:51:33.988]  But the infrastructure is blown, it's not set up anymore.
[02:51:33.988 --> 02:51:36.128]  People have to back it now, just like InfoWars.
[02:51:36.128 --> 02:51:39.569]  They've got to get my book now, The Great Awakening.
[02:51:39.569 --> 02:51:41.469]  They've got to buy products at InfoWars store.
[02:51:41.469 --> 02:51:44.130]  They've got to go to mypillow.com forward slash Alex, you support us.
[02:51:44.130 --> 02:51:45.270]  This is now, folks.
[02:51:45.270 --> 02:51:46.450]  We're not putting an act on.
[02:51:46.450 --> 02:51:48.091]  You see what's happening to us?
[02:51:48.091 --> 02:51:49.751]  They've got to get through us to go to you.
[02:51:49.751 --> 02:51:50.611]  You got that?
[02:51:50.611 --> 02:51:51.851]  I don't know how to back down.
[02:51:51.851 --> 02:51:52.751]  Neither does Mike.
[02:51:52.751 --> 02:51:53.732]  Neither does Trump.
[02:51:53.732 --> 02:51:55.212]  So you've got to back your champions.
[02:51:55.212 --> 02:51:55.792]  It's real simple.
[02:51:57.463 --> 02:52:05.492]  Yeah, you know, for me, I care so much about my company and my employees, so if you can all help support them, everybody, I will promise you.
[02:52:05.492 --> 02:52:10.297]  The media asks, are you going to make a deal with these machine companies?
[02:52:10.297 --> 02:52:11.338]  Absolutely not!
[02:52:11.338 --> 02:52:12.679]  I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
[02:52:12.679 --> 02:52:16.924]  I'm going to fight every day to secure our elections with the plan I have going forward.
[02:52:17.463 --> 02:52:18.223]  Period.
[02:52:18.223 --> 02:52:20.945]  But I've got to protect my company over here.
[02:52:20.945 --> 02:52:22.765]  Mike, let's go further.
[02:52:22.765 --> 02:52:28.968]  Let's go back to the guy that liberated Spain 700 plus years ago or whatever it was, 800 years ago, El Cid.
[02:52:28.968 --> 02:52:31.069]  They had three kingdoms there.
[02:52:31.069 --> 02:52:37.452]  He had to battle the kings of each deal and kill them in battle to become the leader of Spain and then drive the Muslims out.
[02:52:38.152 --> 02:52:41.033]  And again, he was a champion.
[02:52:41.033 --> 02:52:42.854]  El Cid, the wise one.
[02:52:42.854 --> 02:52:57.821]  And the point is, they see any of us battling the globalists as champions of the people, and the enemy sees us as that, and they believe they can defeat the champions, the General Flynn's, the Alex Jones's, the Donald Trump's, the Tucker Carlson, they believe.
[02:52:57.821 --> 02:53:03.284]  So if the public doesn't get that, this all goes back to ancient rules, we are your champions.
[02:53:03.284 --> 02:53:04.184]  It's that simple.
[02:53:04.184 --> 02:53:06.105]  So if you don't back us, folks, you don't back yourselves.
[02:53:07.988 --> 02:53:14.551]  Plus, you know, I've said this before, you know, I hate to do a commercial in the middle of this, but you guys, and the products will help you.
[02:53:14.551 --> 02:53:15.771]  No, don't hate to do it.
[02:53:15.771 --> 02:53:17.912]  Money prosecutes wars.
[02:53:17.912 --> 02:53:22.434]  Money prosecutes wars.
[02:53:22.434 --> 02:53:28.656]  The best sleep ever in this time we're in, I'll tell you what, people ask me all the time, how do you get some sleep?
[02:53:28.656 --> 02:53:30.177]  You seem to work all the time.
[02:53:30.177 --> 02:53:32.158]  I get a little sleep, but it's quality.
[02:53:32.158 --> 02:53:37.240]  It's quality with the MyPillow 2.0 that my employees, I'll tell you one thing, Alex, this too,
[02:53:37.660 --> 02:53:48.327]  The three products I make 100% here in the USA, the MyPillow, the MyPillow 2.0, which I have right here, the MyPillow 2.0 mattress topper, and our new beds.
[02:53:48.327 --> 02:53:49.428]  These are all employees.
[02:53:49.428 --> 02:53:50.389]  You're helping U.S.
[02:53:50.389 --> 02:53:54.451]  employees, and you're getting the best sleep, both Delta and REM sleep.
[02:53:54.451 --> 02:53:56.453]  You're getting these amazing sleep cycles.
[02:53:56.453 --> 02:54:01.376]  Now, everybody knows it's made in America, and slippers and beds and sheets and towels.
[02:54:01.376 --> 02:54:02.537]  They know they're great products.
[02:54:02.537 --> 02:54:04.738]  They should get them instead of buying them from China.
[02:54:04.738 --> 02:54:07.140]  But the point is, your lawyers have
[02:54:07.720 --> 02:54:08.401]  We're good to go.
[02:54:33.293 --> 02:55:01.279]  You know, it's amazing, Alex, I said to all the CNNs that have been calling, I chew them out, every one of them, Politico called, the New York Times, all these outlets, I said, you know what, I'm talking directly to their employees, I said, you know what, I don't understand why you guys here, you jump on, you attack my pillow, an employee-owned company, USA made, but you stick up for these companies, nobody's heard their name, Dominion, and you're smart-matics of the world.
[02:55:01.519 --> 02:55:07.925]  You're sticking up for these companies instead of saying, hey, why don't you open up your machines and let's see what's in there.
[02:55:07.925 --> 02:55:10.347]  But they sit there and attack.
[02:55:10.347 --> 02:55:11.968]  I told them they're the problem.
[02:55:11.968 --> 02:55:14.390]  I said, you journalists, what are you going to do?
[02:55:14.390 --> 02:55:16.332]  If we ever go away, what are they going to have?
[02:55:16.332 --> 02:55:19.615]  What are they going to do for jobs, Alex, if they don't have anybody to attack?
[02:55:21.849 --> 02:55:25.590]  Well, we're the men of the arena, folks, so how much worse do you want to see it?
[02:55:25.590 --> 02:55:28.871]  Trump indicted 91 times, four times, 91 charges.
[02:55:28.871 --> 02:55:36.412]  That's all hell's borders wide open, giant child trafficking, World War III, war with Russia, pedophiles everywhere, and we're just challenging the new world order.
[02:55:36.412 --> 02:55:40.993]  You can roll over and die, or you go to MyPillow.com for some great products.
[02:55:40.993 --> 02:55:43.114]  I mean, it takes money to fight a war.
[02:55:43.114 --> 02:55:44.234]  This is modern war, folks.
[02:55:44.234 --> 02:55:44.954]  You're going to back us?
[02:55:44.954 --> 02:55:46.174]  We're not backing down.
[02:55:46.174 --> 02:55:47.394]  We'll never give up.
[02:55:47.394 --> 02:55:49.575]  We'll never sell out, but we could be defeated.
[02:55:52.378 --> 02:55:55.179]  Yeah, and I just want to thank everybody for the support.
[02:55:55.179 --> 02:56:00.162]  I know when I came on the show last week when the IRS audits, they're attacking my home reps too.
[02:56:00.162 --> 02:56:05.044]  They're doing audits on them to say that they can't be worked from home on commission.
[02:56:05.044 --> 02:56:07.986]  But I'll tell you what, we do have good news there.
[02:56:07.986 --> 02:56:11.948]  North Carolina came through and said absolutely you can because they were one of the audits.
[02:56:12.368 --> 02:56:13.629]  Absolutely, you can.
[02:56:13.629 --> 02:56:22.793]  So these horrible other audits from Minnesota and California, all these, you know, this attack.
[02:56:22.793 --> 02:56:24.934]  You know what bothers me, Alex?
[02:56:24.934 --> 02:56:28.276]  I just can't fathom how deep and how wide this goes.
[02:56:28.276 --> 02:56:30.077]  You get attacked from every angle.
[02:56:30.077 --> 02:56:33.358]  This stuff has never happened before in history like this.
[02:56:33.358 --> 02:56:34.359]  And you're going, you know,
[02:56:35.980 --> 02:56:46.985]  The orchestrate, how they orchestrate, how evil orchestrates it, you know, it is a battle of evil and good, epic proportions, biblical proportion, because you couldn't go over here and go, hey, you go do this now.
[02:56:46.985 --> 02:56:48.426]  You go do this now.
[02:56:48.426 --> 02:56:49.666]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:56:49.666 --> 02:56:50.547]  It's like that.
[02:56:52.005 --> 02:56:56.829]  It's run so deep and so wide, the evil that's out there.
[02:56:56.829 --> 02:56:58.930]  And, you know, we're going to win.
[02:56:58.930 --> 02:57:00.371]  God wins in the end here.
[02:57:00.371 --> 02:57:10.419]  And I've said it before, everybody, if you keep the faith and we get to this great place we're going to get to, we'll look back and say everything had to happen just the way it did.
[02:57:10.419 --> 02:57:12.220]  God uses all things for good.
[02:57:12.220 --> 02:57:13.901]  But I'll tell you, we do have choices.
[02:57:13.901 --> 02:57:20.126]  And right now, I'd love it if everybody could help out and help my employees and get those great products and use
[02:57:20.726 --> 02:57:30.312]  Go to MyPillow.com backslash Alex, man, because I have to have them okay so I can get out here and keep up the fight to secure our election platform.
[02:57:30.312 --> 02:57:31.393]  Well, Mike, I want to say this.
[02:57:31.393 --> 02:57:37.137]  Despite all you've been through, the 10 percent, you know, that's half your profit that you send us has kept us on air.
[02:57:37.137 --> 02:57:38.958]  So MyPillow.com forward slash Alex.
[02:57:38.958 --> 02:57:39.458]  Stay right there.
[02:57:39.458 --> 02:57:41.920]  I want to get five more minutes from you on the latest developments.
[02:57:41.920 --> 02:57:43.781]  But we are the men in the arena.
[02:57:47.059 --> 02:57:51.103]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[02:57:51.103 --> 02:57:54.666]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[02:57:54.666 --> 02:57:59.771]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[02:57:59.771 --> 02:58:02.213]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[02:58:02.213 --> 02:58:10.821]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[02:58:10.821 --> 02:58:12.143]  This is the Great Awakening.
[02:58:12.643 --> 02:58:17.026]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[02:58:17.026 --> 02:58:20.809]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[02:58:20.809 --> 02:58:23.690]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[02:58:23.690 --> 02:58:28.414]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at infowarestore.com.

[02:59:08.831 --> 02:59:19.841]  Turmeric bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[02:59:19.841 --> 02:59:31.612]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[02:59:31.852 --> 02:59:35.334]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.

[02:59:50.524 --> 02:59:54.446]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:05.436 --> 03:00:10.821]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[03:00:10.821 --> 03:00:13.023]  I'm a friend of thunder.
[03:00:13.023 --> 03:00:18.348]  Friend is it any wonder lightning strikes me?
[03:00:18.348 --> 03:00:21.290]  I fought with the devil.
[03:00:21.290 --> 03:00:23.973]  I fought with the devil.
[03:00:23.973 --> 03:00:26.655]  Got down on his level.
[03:00:26.655 --> 03:00:30.299]  But I never gave in, so he gave up on me.
[03:00:30.299 --> 03:00:31.520]  So good when the devil's up on you.
[03:00:33.663 --> 03:00:37.847]  Then the attacks come.
[03:00:37.847 --> 03:00:42.510]  God said, Jesus said, if you follow me, you'll be persecuted like I've been.
[03:00:42.510 --> 03:00:44.552]  So, Mike Lindell is a real sweetheart.
[03:00:44.552 --> 03:00:47.274]  So smart, so hard-fighting.
[03:00:47.274 --> 03:00:49.756]  And I see him so sad for his employees and what he's going through.
[03:00:51.567 --> 03:00:55.488]  I can see it in the tea leaves that there's a good chance they're going to shut him down very soon.
[03:00:55.488 --> 03:01:01.570]  Everybody can just come to his aid right now and money just fixes it because it just takes more money in this battle.
[03:01:01.570 --> 03:01:03.431]  They'll probably put him in prison or kill him next.
[03:01:03.431 --> 03:01:06.652]  They're trying that with me and Trump right now, but we don't know how to back down.
[03:01:06.652 --> 03:01:07.492]  So in closing, Mike...
[03:01:09.504 --> 03:01:10.425]  You will do a search.
[03:01:10.425 --> 03:01:13.926]  We'll get the best people, folks that want to be part of the fight.
[03:01:13.926 --> 03:01:17.027]  Because, you know, once things get intense, a lot of people cut and run.
[03:01:17.027 --> 03:01:18.828]  I know you're giving them excuses, and that's fine.
[03:01:18.828 --> 03:01:20.269]  We're not going to judge them.
[03:01:20.269 --> 03:01:22.650]  But they're just not made of the right stuff.
[03:01:22.650 --> 03:01:23.830]  But we are.
[03:01:23.830 --> 03:01:27.732]  But it doesn't matter if we're made of the right stuff and we're willing to fight to the death.
[03:01:27.732 --> 03:01:30.493]  You don't know who's going to win at the last second.
[03:01:30.493 --> 03:01:34.274]  When it looks most desperate is when it's the best, if you persevere like George Washington.
[03:01:34.274 --> 03:01:36.415]  Six-year war with an empire never before defeated.
[03:01:37.585 --> 03:01:39.947]  They wanted to defeat Napoleon a few years later.
[03:01:39.947 --> 03:01:42.129]  Hundreds of thousands of men per army.
[03:01:42.129 --> 03:01:42.950]  He had multiple armies.
[03:01:44.124 --> 03:01:47.385]  But George Washington went to the last few months, he persevered.
[03:01:47.385 --> 03:01:48.585]  So I love you.
[03:01:48.585 --> 03:01:49.706]  I appreciate you.
[03:01:49.706 --> 03:01:51.706]  I appreciate my Pellegrin products.
[03:01:51.706 --> 03:01:52.727]  Got about three minutes to break.
[03:01:52.727 --> 03:01:55.848]  I'm gonna come back, take a few calls, hand the baton to the next guest host.
[03:01:55.848 --> 03:01:59.289]  But just, yeah, now's the time to stand.
[03:01:59.289 --> 03:02:03.750]  And you should probably put a goal on your site and come up with how much money you think you need.
[03:02:03.750 --> 03:02:04.230]  Because I get it.
[03:02:04.230 --> 03:02:05.350]  You're out of money.
[03:02:05.350 --> 03:02:06.511]  They're debanking you.
[03:02:06.511 --> 03:02:07.431]  You still got the products.
[03:02:07.431 --> 03:02:08.431]  Your warehouse is there.
[03:02:08.431 --> 03:02:09.852]  The products are there ready to ship.
[03:02:10.632 --> 03:02:12.796]  But you just need the people to step up.
[03:02:12.796 --> 03:02:20.249]  So, really, whether you're destroyed or not, which will even make you bigger, God works in serious ways, is now in the people's hands.
[03:02:20.249 --> 03:02:21.090]  Is it not, Mike Lindell?
[03:02:22.074 --> 03:02:23.175]  Absolutely.
[03:02:23.175 --> 03:02:24.736]  My pillow needs to make up.
[03:02:24.736 --> 03:02:28.819]  Right now, we've been cancelled so much.
[03:02:28.819 --> 03:02:30.840]  Just the sales alone to keep.
[03:02:30.840 --> 03:02:34.983]  So I don't have to do anything with the employees.
[03:02:34.983 --> 03:02:40.187]  If everybody pitches in and you're getting great things, it's not even donating money.
[03:02:40.187 --> 03:02:41.047]  You're buying stuff.
[03:02:41.047 --> 03:02:42.428]  We're putting everything on sale.
[03:02:42.428 --> 03:02:43.029]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:02:43.029 --> 03:02:44.710]  They should make straight donations for what you're doing.
[03:02:44.710 --> 03:02:45.391]  Alex, what I did today.
[03:02:47.652 --> 03:02:54.718]  All of our slippers that were on sale for $49.98, I put them on the website, on your site there at MyPillowFed.com.
[03:02:54.718 --> 03:02:55.238]  No, no.
[03:02:55.238 --> 03:02:56.959]  People need a goal.
[03:02:56.959 --> 03:03:01.263]  Roughly, how much money do you need?
[03:03:01.263 --> 03:03:03.344]  Half a million dollars to come into MyPillowFed.com.
[03:03:03.344 --> 03:03:04.465]  Why don't you put a donation?
[03:03:04.465 --> 03:03:06.327]  Hey, put a donation button up.
[03:03:06.327 --> 03:03:07.528]  You'll get $5 million a day.
[03:03:07.528 --> 03:03:08.028]  People love you.
[03:03:09.167 --> 03:03:14.792]  Yeah, you could go, if you guys want to do that, the LyndaleOffenseFund.org, everybody.
[03:03:14.792 --> 03:03:16.793]  LyndaleOffenseFund.org.
[03:03:16.793 --> 03:03:18.514]  That would really help there.
[03:03:18.514 --> 03:03:21.637]  All the stuff we're doing, that's an easy website to remember.
[03:03:21.637 --> 03:03:23.218]  LyndaleOffenseFund.
[03:03:23.218 --> 03:03:25.060]  We're always on the offense.
[03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:27.161]  LyndaleOffenseFund.org.
[03:03:27.161 --> 03:03:30.704]  And, boy, supporting that, that would another help me over here.
[03:03:30.704 --> 03:03:31.625]  Well, Mike, here's the deal.
[03:03:31.625 --> 03:03:32.646]  I'm a winner's soldier.
[03:03:33.326 --> 03:03:37.527]  So I'm not looking for the people in Hollywood and being paid by the New World Order a billion bucks.
[03:03:37.527 --> 03:03:38.487]  Those are the losers.
[03:03:38.487 --> 03:03:39.888]  I'm looking for the men in the arena.
[03:03:39.888 --> 03:03:40.828]  You're the man in the arena.
[03:03:40.828 --> 03:03:43.248]  Frank's speech, what you've done.
[03:03:43.248 --> 03:03:46.289]  You know the CIA is running this against you, right?
[03:03:46.289 --> 03:03:47.349]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:03:47.349 --> 03:03:49.250]  100%.
[03:03:49.250 --> 03:03:52.150]  You're the type of man I want to be around, buddy.
[03:03:52.150 --> 03:03:54.891]  No matter what happens, let's take some time and go duck hunting or something.
[03:03:54.891 --> 03:03:56.431]  Because you're a real man, buddy.
[03:03:56.431 --> 03:03:58.392]  You're the type of guy I want to be around, isn't a damn coward.
[03:03:59.968 --> 03:04:01.489]  Well, I'm never giving up.
[03:04:01.489 --> 03:04:03.771]  The media keeps calling, will you make a deal?
[03:04:03.771 --> 03:04:05.072]  And back off on this, Mike.
[03:04:05.072 --> 03:04:06.293]  Will you make a deal?
[03:04:06.293 --> 03:04:07.333]  There it is right there.
[03:04:07.333 --> 03:04:11.917]  You can go there to LyndaleOffenseFund.org.
[03:04:11.917 --> 03:04:12.517]  You go there.
[03:04:12.517 --> 03:04:13.958]  This lays out the plan.
[03:04:13.958 --> 03:04:17.600]  It lays out the needs we have to a secure election.
[03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:19.722]  They don't want the election secure, everybody.
[03:04:19.722 --> 03:04:21.123]  They want me to stop fighting.
[03:04:21.733 --> 03:04:23.074]  Right there is how you can help.
[03:04:23.074 --> 03:04:25.434]  The LyndellOffenseFund.org.
[03:04:25.434 --> 03:04:28.655]  You help there, and we're going to get this thing.
[03:04:28.655 --> 03:04:32.497]  And this is before November 7th of this election, everybody.
[03:04:32.497 --> 03:04:34.157]  I promise you we'll get this done.
[03:04:34.157 --> 03:04:39.119]  If you guys can get out there and support, and we get that money raised today, we will get this done.
[03:04:39.119 --> 03:04:41.880]  In spite of all these attacks, this is what they want.
[03:04:41.880 --> 03:04:44.121]  They want to silence me.
[03:04:44.121 --> 03:04:45.561]  Mike, this is important.
[03:04:45.561 --> 03:04:46.102]  You're a major...
[03:04:47.242 --> 03:04:49.446]  Beachhead, join us again tomorrow.
[03:04:49.446 --> 03:04:51.189]  Mypulla.com forward slash Alex.
[03:04:51.189 --> 03:04:51.830]  We love you.
[03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:54.134]  We appreciate you, Mike Lindell.
[03:04:54.134 --> 03:04:54.575]  All right.
[03:04:54.575 --> 03:04:55.496]  Thank you for having me on.
[03:04:55.496 --> 03:04:56.298]  God bless you, Alex.
[03:04:56.298 --> 03:04:56.819]  Thank you, guys.
[03:04:58.539 --> 03:05:06.741]  The most powerful Wimp Wars life formula yet, DNA Force Plus is now back in stock for 25% off while supplies last.
[03:05:06.741 --> 03:05:17.125]  This elite formula contains the most cutting-edge enzymes, potent antioxidants, and traditional naturally occurring ingredients to protect the vitality of your buried DNA.
[03:05:17.125 --> 03:05:25.227]  The powerhouse ingredients in DNA Force Plus include QQQ, CoQ10, organic reishi mushroom, astrologous root,
[03:05:25.447 --> 03:05:26.228]  We're good to go!
[03:05:48.468 --> 03:05:49.109]  I think so.
[03:05:58.780 --> 03:06:05.242]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:06:43.920 --> 03:06:45.701]  It's a true story.
[03:06:45.701 --> 03:06:47.042]  I knew he was a great guy.
[03:06:47.042 --> 03:06:48.103]  He played El Cid.
[03:06:48.103 --> 03:06:56.448]  He had to kill the champions of the other two kingdoms in Spain before he could even lead them in victory against the Muslims.
[03:06:56.448 --> 03:07:09.195]  The great champion, the reason Spain exists today, El Cid, barely won each battle in the gladiatorial event to then lead them against victory five times their numbers of Muslims and crush them.
[03:07:09.195 --> 03:07:09.956]  And my point is,
[03:07:11.869 --> 03:07:13.031]  You want champions?
[03:07:13.031 --> 03:07:15.355]  All of us are in the arena now.
[03:07:15.355 --> 03:07:17.078]  This is the real world.
[03:07:17.078 --> 03:07:17.879]  This is the fight.
[03:07:41.192 --> 03:07:46.313]  We're going to have to fight in the information war, in the spiritual war, to defeat this.
[03:07:46.313 --> 03:07:49.453]  And I told you I'd get to the calls, but Drew Hernandez is so on fire, I need to get to them.
[03:07:49.453 --> 03:07:50.314]  I promised I would.
[03:07:50.314 --> 03:07:52.334]  I'll give each caller a minute, then hand the baton to him.
[03:07:52.334 --> 03:07:56.015]  But please remember, Mike Lindell is the real deal, folks.
[03:07:56.015 --> 03:07:57.935]  He's a goofball, just like I am.
[03:07:57.935 --> 03:08:00.335]  And the CIA and all of them are trying to shut him down.
[03:08:00.335 --> 03:08:02.456]  His lawyers have cut and run.
[03:08:02.456 --> 03:08:04.116]  Are we going to cut and run from him right now?
[03:08:04.116 --> 03:08:05.216]  No, we shouldn't.
[03:08:05.216 --> 03:08:06.857]  And you shouldn't cut and run from Infowars.
[03:08:06.857 --> 03:08:08.197]  But here's the deal.
[03:08:08.197 --> 03:08:09.217]  I'm at peace with all of it.
[03:08:10.333 --> 03:08:14.077]  It's like the Alamo got wiped out and it made the Texas pissed and we won the war.
[03:08:14.077 --> 03:08:15.799]  God's going to do what God's going to do.
[03:08:15.799 --> 03:08:20.564]  I don't understand all God's plan, but I know God's in charge.
[03:08:20.564 --> 03:08:23.167]  I'm just not going to give up.
[03:08:23.167 --> 03:08:24.789]  I'm not going to back down.
[03:08:24.789 --> 03:08:27.832]  I'm not going to put my tail between my legs.
[03:08:27.832 --> 03:08:30.355]  Because that's an easy thing to do when you're a man.
[03:08:31.854 --> 03:08:33.235]  But we need your support.
[03:08:33.235 --> 03:08:34.997]  Everybody go to InfoWarsTore.
[03:08:34.997 --> 03:08:36.918]  Get this weapon system.
[03:08:36.918 --> 03:08:40.321]  Get The Great Awakening, my newest book.
[03:08:40.321 --> 03:08:41.983]  200 pages longer than the last one.
[03:08:41.983 --> 03:08:43.984]  Into the whole New World Order plan, how to defeat them.
[03:08:43.984 --> 03:08:45.806]  And it's all about God.
[03:08:45.806 --> 03:08:47.808]  It's all about the truth.
[03:08:47.808 --> 03:08:48.428]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:08:48.428 --> 03:08:51.511]  I want to thank those that got the signed copies, the fundraiser, we need it.
[03:08:51.511 --> 03:08:54.694]  But Mike Lindell is in desperate straits.
[03:08:54.694 --> 03:08:54.794]  And
[03:08:56.676 --> 03:08:59.879]  It's so sad the amount of money he needs, a half million bucks.
[03:08:59.879 --> 03:09:02.682]  I know people behind the scenes, he's sold everything he's got.
[03:09:02.682 --> 03:09:05.925]  He is so optimistic, but people say, oh, I'm not going to bet on a loser.
[03:09:05.925 --> 03:09:08.707]  That's all the billionaires and the people that are part of the system.
[03:09:08.707 --> 03:09:11.270]  It's the little people that are going to save us in this fight.
[03:09:11.270 --> 03:09:12.911]  So go to infowarshore.com and get...
[03:09:13.680 --> 03:09:18.681]  The Great Awakening right now, ladies and gentlemen, and back in stock also, our Enforce Platinum products.
[03:09:18.681 --> 03:09:22.602]  All right, Drew Hernandez, we're going to skip the two network breaks, so it gets eight minutes back.
[03:09:22.602 --> 03:09:23.502]  That way he'll get all his time.
[03:09:23.502 --> 03:09:24.843]  I love Drew to death.
[03:09:24.843 --> 03:09:26.443]  What a great patriot.
[03:09:26.443 --> 03:09:29.944]  But let's jam in your calls, but I can only give you one minute each.
[03:09:29.944 --> 03:09:31.704]  I apologize, but Lyndell had to come on.
[03:09:31.704 --> 03:09:32.685]  That was important.
[03:09:32.685 --> 03:09:33.905]  Damon, Connecticut, you're on the air.
[03:09:33.905 --> 03:09:34.165]  Go ahead.
[03:09:35.407 --> 03:09:36.948]  Firstly, I love you very much.
[03:09:36.948 --> 03:09:38.470]  You're my brother in Christ, Alex.
[03:09:38.470 --> 03:09:40.452]  It's been a while since I spoke with you.
[03:09:40.452 --> 03:09:43.555]  Secondly, Alex Jones was right again.
[03:09:43.555 --> 03:09:44.776]  What do I mean by this?
[03:09:44.776 --> 03:09:46.337]  I was with you on January 6th.
[03:09:46.337 --> 03:09:52.883]  I was one of the first people you interviewed while we had that rooftop thing, and you warned me about Mike Dunn.
[03:09:52.883 --> 03:09:55.666]  And so did your security guy, and I didn't listen to you.
[03:09:55.666 --> 03:10:00.030]  And Mike Dunn of the Boogaloo Boys, who you interviewed on your show, and I coordinated that with Daria.
[03:10:00.390 --> 03:10:05.794]  He ended up betraying me and trying to set me up as a domestic terrorist when I do nothing but love God.
[03:10:10.336 --> 03:10:15.820]  Absolutely, and I've been working very hard to expose that because he's back at it again in Gloucester County, Virginia.
[03:10:15.820 --> 03:10:17.301]  You guys recently published something.
[03:10:17.301 --> 03:10:19.482]  He's back at it trying to lead people into the fire.
[03:10:19.482 --> 03:10:20.943]  It's not just about Mike Dunn.
[03:10:20.943 --> 03:10:23.825]  It's about what the FBI is going to do to each and every patriot.
[03:10:23.825 --> 03:10:26.286]  We know it's ludicrous to say that the Christians are terrorists.
[03:10:26.286 --> 03:10:30.429]  It's not among our ethos to try to hurt other people, especially when it comes to the Trump base.
[03:10:30.429 --> 03:10:33.051]  Very peaceful, law-abiding people, and generous for the most part.
[03:10:33.551 --> 03:10:37.334]  And so the FBI has to create monsters out of good people.
[03:10:37.334 --> 03:10:38.134]  So that's my call.
[03:10:38.134 --> 03:10:39.295]  I'll let you get to all the callers.
[03:10:39.295 --> 03:10:40.115]  I love you, Alex.
[03:10:40.115 --> 03:10:41.096]  I mean that wholeheartedly.
[03:10:41.096 --> 03:10:41.877]  You're my brother.
[03:10:41.877 --> 03:10:42.897]  I love you, too.
[03:10:42.897 --> 03:10:51.343]  The fact that they've officially announced that all Trump supporters are terrorists, the main focus of the government's Trump supporters, is just seismic, getting almost no coverage.
[03:10:51.343 --> 03:10:52.964]  It is insane.
[03:10:52.964 --> 03:10:56.706]  And I don't tell my other hosts what to do, except for once in a while.
[03:10:56.706 --> 03:10:58.347]  Owen Schroer, I doesn't even mean to tell him.
[03:10:58.347 --> 03:11:00.929]  Neither does Harrison Smith or Chase Kaiser or any of them.
[03:11:02.250 --> 03:11:03.431]  This is everything.
[03:11:03.431 --> 03:11:08.193]  I mean, this is... I'm mad at myself I didn't make a bigger deal about it.
[03:11:08.193 --> 03:11:10.374]  Like, I mean, it's like words can't describe it.
[03:11:10.374 --> 03:11:12.275]  It's surreal.
[03:11:12.275 --> 03:11:23.441]  You ever been on a highway and watch an 18-wheeler flip over and a bunch of people die and... I saw this happen when bodies flying everywhere and people got... a guy's head got cut off in midair and I saw it and pulled over and blood spraying everywhere.
[03:11:23.441 --> 03:11:26.022]  It's like it's not real, but it is.
[03:11:26.022 --> 03:11:29.384]  And politically, that's how insane this is.
[03:11:29.384 --> 03:11:31.685]  This is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
[03:11:33.254 --> 03:11:36.536]  That's why all these feds are leaking it going, we don't want to fight 80 million people.
[03:11:36.536 --> 03:11:38.076]  Well, we don't want to fight you either.
[03:11:38.076 --> 03:11:40.497]  We just need to get rid of the globalists, okay?
[03:11:40.497 --> 03:11:42.638]  Jayden in Illinois, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:11:42.638 --> 03:11:46.080]  Hi Alex, this is Jayden.
[03:11:46.080 --> 03:11:50.122]  I decree and declare a few things over you and InfoWars.
[03:11:50.122 --> 03:11:55.545]  So I decree and declare Isaiah 5417 over Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[03:11:55.545 --> 03:11:58.506]  No weapon formed against thee shall prosper, in the name of Jesus.
[03:11:59.110 --> 03:12:02.232]  And then I have this that kind of ties in with the martial law thing.
[03:12:02.232 --> 03:12:04.053]  By the way, I received that prayer, brother.
[03:12:04.053 --> 03:12:05.513]  Two people agree upon it.
[03:12:05.513 --> 03:12:08.075]  On earth, it's made so in heaven.
[03:12:08.075 --> 03:12:08.835]  Amen.
[03:12:08.835 --> 03:12:17.639]  And then I got Matthew 10, 16 through 23 right here talking about what will happen.
[03:12:17.639 --> 03:12:26.484]  So, Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves, but be ye therefore wise as serpents and as harmless as doves.
[03:12:26.963 --> 03:12:32.904]  But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues.
[03:12:32.904 --> 03:12:39.426]  And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.
[03:12:39.426 --> 03:12:47.928]  But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak, for it shall be given to you in that same hour what ye shall speak.
[03:12:47.928 --> 03:12:52.969]  For it is not ye that speak, but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you.
[03:12:52.969 --> 03:12:53.509]  And the brother
[03:12:53.988 --> 03:12:54.748]  And then skip down to verse 28.
[03:13:21.340 --> 03:13:32.537]  It says, "...and fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul, but rather fear Him," that's God, "...which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
[03:13:33.496 --> 03:13:34.177]  Beautifully said.
[03:13:34.177 --> 03:13:36.478]  Look, I cannot cut into Drew Hernandez anymore.
[03:13:36.478 --> 03:13:37.299]  And nobody get mad at him.
[03:13:37.299 --> 03:13:38.660]  He can't do it.
[03:13:38.660 --> 03:13:45.486]  If Drew wants to take the calls from Adam and Carlos and Randy and Dave and Adam and Blade Runner, he can do it.
[03:13:45.486 --> 03:13:47.167]  If not, get their names and numbers.
[03:13:47.167 --> 03:13:48.468]  We will call them back tomorrow.
[03:13:48.468 --> 03:13:49.069]  We're still here.
[03:13:49.069 --> 03:13:51.531]  I don't take any day for granted.
[03:13:51.531 --> 03:13:53.652]  And we'll call you back ahead of the line.
[03:13:53.652 --> 03:13:54.293]  We do that.
[03:13:54.293 --> 03:13:55.114]  We're faithful about it.
[03:13:55.734 --> 03:13:56.515]  You got it, Alex.
[03:13:56.515 --> 03:13:57.396]  I can't cut the calls on that.
[03:13:57.396 --> 03:13:58.637]  That's the word of God right there.
[03:14:15.774 --> 03:14:17.455]  The crew wants to keep that going.
[03:14:17.455 --> 03:14:18.395]  I'll keep the calls going.
[03:14:18.395 --> 03:14:19.436]  That's totally fine.
[03:14:19.436 --> 03:14:20.356]  This is the Infowar.
[03:14:20.356 --> 03:14:21.557]  It's your voice.
[03:14:21.557 --> 03:14:23.057]  People are supporting this war.
[03:14:23.057 --> 03:14:25.258]  They're supporting this machine that has to continue.
[03:14:25.258 --> 03:14:29.740]  So however you guys want to do that, if we have any other caller lined up.
[03:14:29.740 --> 03:14:30.901]  Yeah, we'll do that after the break.
[03:14:30.901 --> 03:14:31.701]  That can hold longer.
[03:14:31.701 --> 03:14:35.323]  But what is your take on Homeland Security officially declaring all Trump supporters terrorists?
[03:14:35.323 --> 03:14:35.963]  This is so huge.
[03:14:37.120 --> 03:14:42.263]  You know, Alex, just to carry on that conversation, I don't think it's a surprise, but I also think it's preliminary.
[03:14:42.263 --> 03:14:53.030]  And I think that people that are starting to pay attention to what's really happening is, I mean, we've always said this, that when it came to censorship, and it came to the internet, that Alex Jones and Infowars was the prototype.
[03:14:53.570 --> 03:14:58.113]  And then we knew that eventually that would happen to elected officials, that would happen to Trump.
[03:14:58.113 --> 03:15:04.897]  Trump was kind of like in denial about it until it eventually happened after J6 and then they would go after his supporters and anybody in his orbit.
[03:15:04.897 --> 03:15:16.805]  So the same thing they're doing with big tech and the same thing that they're doing with the censorship on all technological avenues or platforms, all of those that you see getting shot right now, everyone that's getting shot in the back of the head,
[03:15:17.443 --> 03:15:24.904]  When it comes to censorship on the internet, that's meant to be and that's meant to send a message to everyone that you are not supposed to go down that path ever.
[03:15:24.904 --> 03:15:26.605]  But the same thing is with the law fair.
[03:15:26.605 --> 03:15:33.906]  So when they launched the law fair and they launched the feds and they launched the FBI and the weaponized intelligence agencies, it's meant to send the same message.
[03:15:33.906 --> 03:15:36.206]  They've done the same thing again with Alex Jones.
[03:15:36.206 --> 03:15:37.106]  Look at Mike Lindell.
[03:15:37.106 --> 03:15:38.407]  Look at Steve Bannon.
[03:15:38.407 --> 03:15:43.708]  Look at everyone that's been in Trump's orbit to this very day, especially accusing them slapping Rico and Georgia.
[03:15:43.708 --> 03:15:45.588]  That's why all the black people are waking up, by the way.
[03:15:46.048 --> 03:15:51.833]  All the black people are waking up because once they understand that you slapped Rico on someone, it's kind of like, that's definitely a fed up.
[03:15:51.833 --> 03:15:54.195]  That equals, that means fed up!
[03:15:54.195 --> 03:16:08.506]  Which, interestingly enough, I think it's also pretty crazy how you're starting to see a lot of young black males that Trump is doing pretty well with, that are starting to come to the realization that there is something going on that has to do with the federal government, the feds,
[03:16:08.946 --> 03:16:23.209]  In collusion with a movement in the United States of America that wants to actually improve the lives of Americans, it doesn't matter what color you are, whether you're white, you're black, or you're brown, people are waking up to the realization that there is an entity out there that is anti their existence.
[03:16:23.209 --> 03:16:23.729]  What does that mean?
[03:16:23.729 --> 03:16:27.150]  That's anti their existence as those that are made in the image of God.
[03:16:27.150 --> 03:16:31.371]  Because we're made in God's image, you are going to get attacked and targeted.
[03:16:31.371 --> 03:16:34.671]  They're going to attempt to snipe you in the back of the head without you even realizing.
[03:16:34.671 --> 03:16:36.912]  They will attempt to politically assassinate you.
[03:16:36.912 --> 03:16:37.132]  They will
[03:16:37.733 --> 03:16:42.464]  Uh, launch, uh, character assassinations in the media, but ultimately they will launch their law fair.
[03:16:43.254 --> 03:16:48.937]  And I think the ultimate endgame, they'll just start rounding everybody up in FEMA camps, gulags, and start executing people.
[03:16:48.937 --> 03:16:52.760]  Because that's historically how authoritarian regimes always function.
[03:16:52.760 --> 03:17:01.645]  But, however, when it comes to these intelligence agencies, when it comes to what the FBI is doing right now, this has already happened in human history.
[03:17:01.645 --> 03:17:06.508]  And it's crazy that it's happening in the United States of America, but history does repeat itself.
[03:17:06.508 --> 03:17:12.291]  When you have these intelligence agencies, when you have these police forces, that's how you end up in a police state.
[03:17:13.035 --> 03:17:26.907]  It's biblical, it's 100% biblical to have a righteous government and a righteous police force, that's what we would call it right now, or a righteous defense line, whether a military or locally and civilly for civilians.
[03:17:26.907 --> 03:17:31.752]  That's righteous to have and that's biblical to have, but it must be run by the righteous.
[03:17:31.752 --> 03:17:36.296]  The Bible's so clear on this, but I find that very interesting that they're twisting that.
[03:17:36.917 --> 03:17:42.138]  That's one of my takeaways, how they're really aggressively pushing against people of faith.
[03:17:42.138 --> 03:17:47.039]  And like I said, the caller that just laid down that Bible verse is 100% spot on.
[03:17:47.039 --> 03:17:48.900]  That's everything we need to hear right now.
[03:17:48.900 --> 03:17:52.840]  That's God speaking to the masses, because persecution is no surprise to anybody.
[03:17:52.840 --> 03:17:55.001]  But we have to fear God above anybody else.
[03:17:55.001 --> 03:17:56.261]  Don't fear the feds.
[03:17:56.261 --> 03:17:57.601]  Don't fear Joe Biden.
[03:17:57.601 --> 03:17:58.762]  Don't fear the New World Order.
[03:17:58.762 --> 03:17:59.922]  Don't fear Satan.
[03:17:59.922 --> 03:18:04.643]  Never underestimate your enemy, but fear God, because, like,
[03:18:05.183 --> 03:18:11.445]  The verse so perfectly states, and like Jesus stated himself, I mean, don't fear man, that could just kill the body.
[03:18:11.445 --> 03:18:13.505]  Fear God, that could kill the soul and the body.
[03:18:13.505 --> 03:18:15.506]  That's the one you should be concerned with right now.
[03:18:15.506 --> 03:18:22.508]  So, our eternal values should always remain and shall always sustain regardless of what's happening in human history.
[03:18:22.508 --> 03:18:25.889]  If we're being persecuted for what is right, that means we're doing the right thing.
[03:18:26.477 --> 03:18:27.578]  I mean, it's as simple as that.
[03:18:27.578 --> 03:18:30.459]  If you're being persecuted for what is right, you are doing the right thing.
[03:18:30.459 --> 03:18:32.300]  You are on the right side of history.
[03:18:32.300 --> 03:18:35.502]  The right side of history is, yes, being on the side of truth.
[03:18:35.502 --> 03:18:37.183]  It's not being on the side of popularity.
[03:18:37.995 --> 03:18:40.537]  I mean, if you're on the side of popularity, what does that mean?
[03:18:40.537 --> 03:18:41.738]  What does that mean in 2023?
[03:18:41.738 --> 03:18:45.181]  The side of popularity today, I mean, just take the pulse of the youth.
[03:18:45.181 --> 03:18:48.063]  You got Gen Z and the next generation below.
[03:18:48.063 --> 03:18:53.087]  It's like the coolest thing to just come out and not even come out of the closet and be gay anymore.
[03:18:53.087 --> 03:18:55.469]  It's just cool to come out and be like, I don't even know what I am.
[03:18:55.469 --> 03:18:56.690]  Let me just chop my penis off.
[03:18:56.690 --> 03:18:57.931]  That's totally great.
[03:18:57.931 --> 03:19:00.593]  It's totally anti-human depopulation.
[03:19:00.593 --> 03:19:01.474]  Say, Drew, what are you talking about?
[03:19:01.474 --> 03:19:02.375]  What I'm talking about is
[03:19:03.627 --> 03:19:05.668]  It doesn't matter where the masses are going.
[03:19:05.668 --> 03:19:08.329]  It doesn't matter what is quote-unquote popular.
[03:19:08.329 --> 03:19:14.551]  It doesn't matter what is acceptable, especially by the deep state and American politics or global politics.
[03:19:14.551 --> 03:19:17.372]  That's the spirit of the Antichrist.
[03:19:17.372 --> 03:19:31.057]  You have to go with the wave of the world, and if you don't, you get punished, you get obliterated, you get cancelled, you get thrown into the digital abyss on the internet, and in some cases, especially in human history, you will get executed and lose your life.
[03:19:31.593 --> 03:19:34.216]  I don't want to see that in the United States of America.
[03:19:34.216 --> 03:19:47.510]  I've interviewed FBI agents, I've talked to FBI, former and current, and I always ask them the same question because I want to see the consistency in their answers.
[03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:51.475]  The question that I like to ask, and the answer that I always get from this question,
[03:19:52.566 --> 03:19:53.247]  Is yes.
[03:19:53.247 --> 03:19:56.271]  And the question I ask is, is there a civil war?
[03:19:56.271 --> 03:20:02.820]  Is there a legitimate civil war internally going on within the FBI, within these intelligence agencies?
[03:20:02.820 --> 03:20:06.925]  Is there like this struggle going back and forth where you have patriots that understand what's going on?
[03:20:07.486 --> 03:20:13.212]  That actually still respect the Constitution and the God-given inalienable rights of Americans in this country.
[03:20:13.212 --> 03:20:28.967]  And then you got the infiltrating commies, you got the infiltrating globalists, you got the Luciferians and the Satanists that all pledge their allegiance to Comey and whoever is the next talking head that the FBI puts up as their director to just take orders from the DOJ and whoever's the next, you know, regime-instillated puppet.
[03:20:30.421 --> 03:20:40.746]  And they tell me, yes, that there is this internal struggle where there are good people inside and there are really bad actors, really bad hombres, just to put it, you know, in a Trumpism.
[03:20:40.746 --> 03:20:46.949]  But I think that's why in this report, you're starting to kind of see that come out.
[03:20:46.949 --> 03:20:49.510]  And in my opinion, it's a good thing, but it's also a bad thing.
[03:20:50.109 --> 03:20:51.472]  And you say, what are you talking about?
[03:20:51.472 --> 03:20:55.240]  I'm saying it's a good thing because we need that to start to come out more.
[03:20:55.240 --> 03:20:57.605]  We need whistleblowers to start to come out more.
[03:20:57.605 --> 03:21:01.212]  We need them to start drawing some serious lines in the sand.
[03:21:02.108 --> 03:21:11.073]  You know, I'm just going to come out and say this, and I know there'll probably be repercussions, and I'm not talking about from the viewers or the public, I'm saying from the actual deep state.
[03:21:11.073 --> 03:21:16.256]  I'm just going to say this, you know, for the feds that are the good guys right now, I'll be totally honest with you.
[03:21:16.256 --> 03:21:22.800]  God is watching you and he's giving you a God-given position, and that God-given position is not, you're not going to be held accountable by man.
[03:21:22.800 --> 03:21:25.242]  You're not going to be held accountable by no president.
[03:21:25.242 --> 03:21:27.403]  You're not going to be held accountable by no general public.
[03:21:28.477 --> 03:21:30.258]  You have a position that is God-given.
[03:21:30.258 --> 03:21:31.398]  You understand that?
[03:21:31.398 --> 03:21:36.361]  You understand that you have been given a God-given position to do righteous?
[03:21:36.361 --> 03:21:37.981]  To do righteous?
[03:21:37.981 --> 03:21:39.702]  To do righteous?
[03:21:39.702 --> 03:21:44.824]  Not what Joe Biden, not what the Deep State or these commies are commanding you to do.
[03:21:44.824 --> 03:21:49.566]  No, you are an allegiance to God first, to righteously lead.
[03:21:49.566 --> 03:21:55.129]  You have been given the sword to execute justice over the evildoers.
[03:21:55.129 --> 03:21:55.909]  You, my friend,
[03:21:57.045 --> 03:22:01.516]  You are going to have a judgment, a very exclusive, customized judgment by God.
[03:22:01.516 --> 03:22:04.203]  And I'm not talking about you'll earn your salvation.
[03:22:04.203 --> 03:22:06.027]  I'm talking about there are specific
[03:22:07.291 --> 03:22:11.393]  Positions in society where there are some stricter judgments.
[03:22:11.393 --> 03:22:15.576]  You got pastors, you got elected officials, you see this all over the book of Judges.
[03:22:15.576 --> 03:22:21.519]  You see those that are in positions of power to rule righteously in a civil manner.
[03:22:21.519 --> 03:22:27.462]  And especially the office of a police officer or a law enforcement individual.
[03:22:27.462 --> 03:22:28.403]  Dude!
[03:22:28.403 --> 03:22:32.245]  I mean, you know, you are playing with fires.
[03:22:33.098 --> 03:22:36.600]  That I think are going beyond your comprehension of what's going to happen to you.
[03:22:36.600 --> 03:22:37.841]  And I'm not talking about violence.
[03:22:37.841 --> 03:22:38.421]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:22:38.421 --> 03:22:40.142]  I know there's going to be repercussions for what I'm saying.
[03:22:40.142 --> 03:22:41.423]  I'm not talking about violence.
[03:22:41.423 --> 03:22:55.011]  This is why they're calling us terrorists, because when you talk like this biblically, they think that you're talking like ISIS, like you're going to strap a bomb to your chest and, you know, go down to the local FBI headquarters and, you know, scream, Christ is king and blow yourself up to make a point.
[03:22:55.011 --> 03:22:55.411]  No, no, no, no.
[03:22:55.411 --> 03:22:58.153]  What I'm saying is you have an eternal enemy.
[03:22:58.153 --> 03:23:00.734]  If you're not born again, you have an eternal enemy.
[03:23:00.734 --> 03:23:02.115]  And that is the most powerful
[03:23:03.397 --> 03:23:11.301]  Entity known in the universe that created this universe that is watching what you're doing and holding you accountable and you're not going to have to deal with me.
[03:23:11.301 --> 03:23:13.202]  You're not going to have to deal with the church.
[03:23:13.202 --> 03:23:21.406]  You're not going to have to deal with no pastor or no Alex Jones sitting there, you know, screaming about the new world order and exposing all of your plans.
[03:23:21.406 --> 03:23:23.947]  Everything that's done in darkness will come to light.
[03:23:23.947 --> 03:23:27.289]  So everything that these guys are doing, it will come to light, but
[03:23:28.197 --> 03:23:29.338]  God is vengeance.
[03:23:29.338 --> 03:23:31.339]  The Ultimate Avenger is not Captain America.
[03:23:31.339 --> 03:23:37.144]  The Ultimate Avenger is not, you know, any one of the great Marvel characters.
[03:23:37.144 --> 03:23:40.786]  The Ultimate Avenger is Jesus Christ.
[03:23:40.786 --> 03:23:42.428]  It's God himself.
[03:23:42.428 --> 03:23:43.989]  Vengeance is mine, says the Lord.
[03:23:45.211 --> 03:23:50.075]  And whether you get it in this life or not, you're going to get it, man.
[03:23:50.075 --> 03:23:51.295]  I can't emphasize that.
[03:23:51.295 --> 03:23:53.157]  You need to repent is what I'm saying.
[03:23:53.157 --> 03:23:55.158]  You need to repent.
[03:23:55.158 --> 03:24:08.407]  I'm not going to be that arm or that tool of vengeance, but I'll tell you the last thing you want is facing an eternal angry God questioning you about everything you've ever done with zero repentance in eternity.
[03:24:08.407 --> 03:24:10.188]  You've got no defense.
[03:24:10.188 --> 03:24:13.751]  Jesus Christ will not be there if you didn't accept him on this side of heaven.
[03:24:14.793 --> 03:24:16.134]  You will have no defense.
[03:24:16.134 --> 03:24:20.577]  You will fail to provide your own defense.
[03:24:20.577 --> 03:24:22.238]  You're sitting there smiling and grinning.
[03:24:22.238 --> 03:24:24.920]  Yeah, we're gonna get all the Trump supporters and we're gonna slap.
[03:24:24.920 --> 03:24:25.861]  Yeah, we're gonna get Owen Troyer.
[03:24:25.861 --> 03:24:27.122]  We're gonna throw him in jail.
[03:24:27.122 --> 03:24:28.903]  Yeah, we're gonna put his life on the line.
[03:24:28.903 --> 03:24:31.545]  We're gonna go after Alex and all the... Yeah, this is gonna be great.
[03:24:31.545 --> 03:24:37.969]  We're gonna cause them to suffer and we're gonna communicate to the American people to never, ever oppose us ever again.
[03:24:37.969 --> 03:24:39.090]  It's gonna be great.
[03:24:39.090 --> 03:24:39.871]  Yeah, we love it.
[03:24:39.871 --> 03:24:42.613]  We love it.
[03:24:42.613 --> 03:24:43.934]  Weak.
[03:24:43.934 --> 03:24:44.334]  Weak, dude.
[03:24:45.134 --> 03:24:46.155]  You want to know why that's weak?
[03:24:46.155 --> 03:24:49.977]  Because you got an eternal God that's going to prosecute you when you die.
[03:24:49.977 --> 03:24:59.702]  And you want to know what your eternal sentence will be if you don't repent now, become born again, put your faith in his son and repent of your disgusting authoritarian ways.
[03:24:59.702 --> 03:25:02.244]  You want to know what your eternal destination will be?
[03:25:02.244 --> 03:25:05.986]  Eternal and sentence, eternal damnation and hell forever.
[03:25:05.986 --> 03:25:09.248]  I can't emphasize that anymore.
[03:25:09.248 --> 03:25:12.590]  Like that, that, that is probably the biggest warning I could ever
[03:25:14.091 --> 03:25:23.236]  Communicate to this New World Order, this deep state, these authoritarian commies, these infiltrators and traitors within the United States government.
[03:25:23.236 --> 03:25:26.798]  It's interesting how they're... I'm going to talk a little bit about this more when we come back from the break.
[03:25:26.798 --> 03:25:28.439]  I mean, I would love to take calls if we can.
[03:25:28.439 --> 03:25:31.241]  We'll fix that when we come back from the break.
[03:25:31.241 --> 03:25:37.084]  But this is why they're... Because, listen, everything I just broke down, that's why they're calling it terrorism.
[03:25:37.084 --> 03:25:38.265]  That's why they're calling it threats.
[03:25:38.265 --> 03:25:39.245]  Because you want to know what?
[03:25:39.245 --> 03:25:40.366]  It is a threat.
[03:25:40.366 --> 03:25:41.527]  It is.
[03:25:41.527 --> 03:25:42.087]  It is a threat.
[03:25:42.856 --> 03:25:49.063]  And I don't mean I'm threatening these people, but in their minds, they interpret it.
[03:25:49.063 --> 03:25:51.485]  You are a threat to the New World Order.
[03:25:51.485 --> 03:25:52.426]  You understand that?
[03:25:52.426 --> 03:25:54.248]  Infowars is a threat.
[03:25:54.248 --> 03:25:56.811]  Jesus Christ is a threat.
[03:25:57.463 --> 03:26:01.104]  To the satanic, anti-Christ agenda.
[03:26:01.104 --> 03:26:04.405]  Anyone that abides in Christ is a threat.
[03:26:04.405 --> 03:26:14.728]  Not a physical threat where you're gonna show up like they say with, you know, they're gonna show up all armed up to the teeth and show up to some public building and just mass slaughter a bunch of people because, you know, they don't agree with you.
[03:26:14.728 --> 03:26:16.148]  No, they do that!
[03:26:16.148 --> 03:26:17.709]  They do, that's what they do!
[03:26:17.709 --> 03:26:18.989]  And they launch their false flags.
[03:26:18.989 --> 03:26:19.549]  No, no, no.
[03:26:19.549 --> 03:26:21.150]  You are a threat.
[03:26:21.150 --> 03:26:23.510]  The born-again Christian is a threat.
[03:26:23.510 --> 03:26:25.331]  InfoWars is a threat.
[03:26:26.644 --> 03:26:29.766]  The truth speakers are threats.
[03:26:29.766 --> 03:26:37.831]  Those that are born again, that are speaking the truth, that are spitting in the face of Satan every single day, you are a threat and they know it.
[03:26:37.831 --> 03:26:40.793]  Their interpretation is accurate of what you are.
[03:26:40.793 --> 03:26:47.277]  When you watch this fundamentally and you discern this on a spiritual level, it makes total sense to me.
[03:26:48.095 --> 03:26:56.919]  Because if you understand that we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, powers, spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places, Joe Biden ain't calling no shots.
[03:26:56.919 --> 03:27:00.240]  Kamala Harris, she ain't calling no shots.
[03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:02.121]  Bill Gates, he ain't calling no shots.
[03:27:02.121 --> 03:27:03.901]  Klaus Schwab, none of these guys.
[03:27:03.901 --> 03:27:05.162]  None of these guys.
[03:27:05.162 --> 03:27:06.923]  None of these guys.
[03:27:06.923 --> 03:27:10.664]  Yes, they're intellectually advanced, they know how to manipulate the public, especially when they're multi-billionaires.
[03:27:10.664 --> 03:27:12.405]  George Soros, none of these guys.
[03:27:13.248 --> 03:27:27.547]  These guys take their orders from their commander-in-chief, Lucifer and the legions of demons that manipulate and they put the ideas and the thoughts in their minds and their cronies and their proxies around them throughout all of their organizations.
[03:27:28.334 --> 03:27:40.263]  They plant those seeds and they hatch in their minds and they turn into organizations and they start to flood the culture and dismantle freedom and attack those made in God's image.
[03:27:40.263 --> 03:27:41.924]  I'm not saying give them a pass because of that.
[03:27:41.924 --> 03:27:47.488]  I'm just saying truly understand that's why you are designated a terrorist.
[03:27:47.488 --> 03:27:49.169]  You are that!
[03:27:49.169 --> 03:27:54.293]  You are an insurrectionist when it comes to what the New World Order is trying to establish.
[03:27:55.982 --> 03:27:59.504]  You are a terrorist in their eyes!
[03:27:59.504 --> 03:28:08.567]  If they're trying to install an authoritarian regime in the United States of America and you oppose it, of course they're going to call me a terrorist!
[03:28:08.567 --> 03:28:11.549]  Of course they're going to call me an insurrectionist!
[03:28:11.549 --> 03:28:15.210]  Of course they're going to call me a threat to that very authoritarian rule.
[03:28:15.210 --> 03:28:21.073]  This is what dictators and authoritarian rulers and regimes have done for thousands of years.
[03:28:21.073 --> 03:28:21.873]  They isolate
[03:28:22.771 --> 03:28:27.534]  And they accuse their opponents of what they are but in their paranoia.
[03:28:27.534 --> 03:28:33.637]  That's one common theme that dictators and dictatorial regimes have always all had together.
[03:28:33.637 --> 03:28:35.938]  They operate in fear and paranoia.
[03:28:35.938 --> 03:28:36.798]  And what do they fear?
[03:28:36.798 --> 03:28:38.960]  They fear freedom.
[03:28:38.960 --> 03:28:40.620]  They fear the people.
[03:28:40.620 --> 03:28:45.063]  And ultimately, without even realizing it, they should fear God.
[03:28:45.063 --> 03:28:49.105]  But they're afraid of freedom because they're afraid of losing control and losing power.
[03:28:50.592 --> 03:28:51.733]  So those are my thoughts on that.
[03:28:51.733 --> 03:28:54.594]  I got a lot more thoughts as well when we come back from the break, so stay with us, go nowhere.
[03:28:54.594 --> 03:28:56.615]  Infowars.com.
[03:28:56.615 --> 03:28:58.016]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[03:28:58.016 --> 03:28:58.957]  I thought it was next week.
[03:28:58.957 --> 03:29:03.379]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[03:29:03.379 --> 03:29:05.600]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[03:29:05.600 --> 03:29:09.443]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[03:29:09.443 --> 03:29:11.344]  Overhead shot, please.
[03:29:11.344 --> 03:29:15.506]  Look how full this bottle is.
[03:29:15.506 --> 03:29:16.727]  Right to the top, folks.
[03:29:18.430 --> 03:29:24.292]  Right to the top with these 95% Cucuminoids.
[03:29:24.292 --> 03:29:28.493]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[03:29:28.493 --> 03:29:30.494]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[03:29:30.494 --> 03:29:35.116]  This is 95%.
[03:29:35.116 --> 03:29:39.957]  Super constant, so like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[03:29:39.957 --> 03:29:41.418]  It's that powerful.
[03:29:41.418 --> 03:29:42.578]  Or more!
[03:29:42.578 --> 03:29:44.699]  So they're available at infowarrestore.com.

[03:31:46.598 --> 03:31:49.521]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[03:32:01.229 --> 03:32:06.391]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[03:32:06.391 --> 03:32:09.852]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[03:32:09.852 --> 03:32:10.913]  Well, I know where you are.
[03:32:10.913 --> 03:32:15.394]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[03:32:15.394 --> 03:32:21.257]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[03:32:22.017 --> 03:32:22.257]  I think.
[03:32:37.481 --> 03:32:40.782]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:12.242 --> 03:33:13.162]  Alrighty, we are back.
[03:33:13.162 --> 03:33:15.603]  I'm your guest host.
[03:33:15.603 --> 03:33:20.545]  You are now watching the fourth hour of the most banned show in the universe.
[03:33:20.545 --> 03:33:22.586]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.586 --> 03:33:27.088]  Now, I know Alex really wanted to honor some of these calls, so I want to get to some of these calls.
[03:33:27.088 --> 03:33:28.448]  You guys do want to call in?
[03:33:28.448 --> 03:33:29.809]  That's cool too.
[03:33:29.809 --> 03:33:30.429]  Let's go, guys.
[03:33:30.429 --> 03:33:32.850]  Let's go to Randy in California.
[03:33:32.850 --> 03:33:35.131]  I know Randy has some thoughts on martial law.
[03:33:35.131 --> 03:33:37.312]  Randy from California.
[03:33:37.312 --> 03:33:38.292]  Sir, are you there?
[03:33:38.292 --> 03:33:39.893]  What are your thoughts?
[03:33:40.888 --> 03:33:47.814]  Yes, with my fight against tyranny, I support the New California 51st State Movement.
[03:33:47.814 --> 03:33:52.859]  Now, a lot of people haven't heard about this yet, but it is a very serious movement.
[03:33:52.859 --> 03:34:04.470]  It's a constitutional movement rather than a secessionist movement, and we're utilizing the model of how West Virginia had split from Virginia during the time of the Civil War in 1861.
[03:34:06.400 --> 03:34:24.388]  So, this is based on the Constitution, Article 4, Section 3, which provides for new states forming from within an existing state, and we want to break free from the blue cities that are basically tyrannizing the whole state out here.
[03:34:26.792 --> 03:34:30.816]  So the succession in California, I think a lot of people have been talking about that and thinking about that.
[03:34:30.816 --> 03:34:37.183]  Do you think, I mean you don't have to say which, I mean you can if you want, which particular, I grew up in California so I kind of know.
[03:34:38.061 --> 03:34:42.702]  How it is well out there, but where in particular in California is this kind of originating out of?
[03:34:42.702 --> 03:34:45.542]  Which cities do you think would participate in that?
[03:34:45.542 --> 03:34:48.863]  Or do you think California is just totally gone in your opinion?
[03:34:48.863 --> 03:34:50.863]  No, I don't think it's totally gone.
[03:34:50.863 --> 03:34:59.565]  And many of us are choosing to stand our ground because we know if we run from the tyranny to a different state, it's going to get there eventually.
[03:34:59.565 --> 03:35:03.685]  So sooner or later, some of us are going to have to stand up against this.
[03:35:03.685 --> 03:35:07.166]  So it's mostly the rural areas of California.
[03:35:07.762 --> 03:35:13.198]  And including some significant cities, but mostly it would be urban Sacramento.
[03:35:14.509 --> 03:35:25.011]  San Francisco Bay Area and urban Los Angeles counties that would be sort of old California and the vast majority of the land would be new California.
[03:35:25.011 --> 03:35:39.854]  That would include the agricultural land in the Central Valley, the great Sierra Nevada mountains where we have all of this water storage potential that isn't being used because the environmentalists block the water storage.
[03:35:39.854 --> 03:35:41.134]  They won't let us build dams.
[03:35:41.670 --> 03:35:44.273]  So that's a big part of what New California would do.
[03:35:56.693 --> 03:35:59.214]  Would essentially be dried out.
[03:35:59.214 --> 03:36:05.575]  I mean, they're already in a drought, but like you say, because all the resources in Northern California, and Trump talked about this when he was in California, was it last week?
[03:36:05.575 --> 03:36:06.315]  He was in Anaheim, right?
[03:36:06.315 --> 03:36:09.656]  And he talked about the major drought taking place in Northern California.
[03:36:09.656 --> 03:36:12.456]  They're not allowed to actually utilize the resources.
[03:36:12.456 --> 03:36:19.438]  Gavin Newsom has shut that down big time for obvious reasons, because it's for climate change, but in reality, it's depopulation.
[03:36:20.278 --> 03:36:23.661]  Do you think that would send a huge message to people in SoCal?
[03:36:23.661 --> 03:36:30.905]  Like, hey, we have all the resources up here, but you guys can continue with your communism down there in SoCal.
[03:36:30.905 --> 03:36:31.966]  Well, let me be clear.
[03:36:31.966 --> 03:36:38.690]  This is not about leaving old California in the dust, or defeating them, or burying them, or anything like that.
[03:36:38.690 --> 03:36:44.214]  This is going to help old California as well, because when New California builds
[03:36:44.747 --> 03:36:49.653]  Something like they're proposing 40 new natural gas burning electricity plants.
[03:36:49.653 --> 03:36:55.119]  That would help to get the cost of electricity down to hopefully 5 or 6 cents a kilowatt hour.
[03:36:55.119 --> 03:37:00.846]  We'll build 6 dams, which will provide lots of water storage and hydroelectric power.
[03:37:01.286 --> 03:37:02.127]  We're good to go.
[03:37:19.483 --> 03:37:25.087]  In California right now, that's why the Founding Fathers left us this escape mechanism.
[03:37:25.087 --> 03:37:30.831]  Short of having a civil war, we can actually do this constitutionally to form a new state.
[03:37:30.831 --> 03:37:38.036]  And there are other states that are considering these moves too, like New Arizona, New Nevada, New Oregon, New Illinois.
[03:37:38.036 --> 03:37:44.141]  Those are all burgeoning new state split movements, not as far along as New California.
[03:37:44.141 --> 03:37:47.303]  But I think we'll be seeing a lot of this in the near future.
[03:37:48.723 --> 03:37:56.687]  Well, I definitely do believe that avoiding a ground physical bloody civil war is should be number one on the list.
[03:37:56.687 --> 03:38:00.808]  But I mean, the feds and the deep state, the New World Order, they're wanting to push everybody into that.
[03:38:00.808 --> 03:38:03.169]  Thank you for the call, Randy from California.
[03:38:03.169 --> 03:38:07.611]  Yeah, California is definitely in bad shape, but we'll see what happens.
[03:38:07.611 --> 03:38:09.732]  I mean, it's obviously going to take a miracle for a lot of this.
[03:38:09.732 --> 03:38:13.354]  I mean, I still don't understand how we're going to win a rigged election.
[03:38:13.354 --> 03:38:15.835]  You know, Trump's running around saying we're going to dominate 2024.
[03:38:15.835 --> 03:38:16.255]  But OK, well,
[03:38:19.102 --> 03:38:21.283]  I guess it's going to require a miracle.
[03:38:21.283 --> 03:38:22.904]  Which, you know, I'm totally for.
[03:38:22.904 --> 03:38:25.045]  I believe, I believe, I believe, but we'll see.
[03:38:25.045 --> 03:38:27.006]  We have Dave from Georgia.
[03:38:27.006 --> 03:38:31.948]  It looks like Dave wants to talk about the New World Order Committee of 300.
[03:38:31.948 --> 03:38:36.490]  Dave, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:36.490 --> 03:38:37.631]  Okay, Dave just dropped.
[03:38:37.631 --> 03:38:42.453]  Do we still have, let's see, do we still have Chuck?
[03:38:42.453 --> 03:38:44.254]  Chuck from Minnesota?
[03:38:44.254 --> 03:38:45.275]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:45.275 --> 03:38:45.855]  Hey, what's going on?
[03:38:46.736 --> 03:38:48.477]  Chuck, what's up, my man?
[03:38:48.477 --> 03:38:49.597]  What do you got going on today, man?
[03:38:49.597 --> 03:38:50.397]  What's up?
[03:38:50.397 --> 03:38:50.917]  Talk to me.
[03:38:50.917 --> 03:38:56.679]  I gotta say, every time, Drew, every time you get on there, man, you're like that Motorhead cover album cover, man.
[03:38:56.679 --> 03:39:01.461]  Just a train on fire, just pumping right through these sons of bitches, I'll say that.
[03:39:01.461 --> 03:39:02.081]  Hey, I love you, man.
[03:39:02.081 --> 03:39:02.961]  Thank you.
[03:39:02.961 --> 03:39:03.802]  It's in my blood.
[03:39:03.802 --> 03:39:04.782]  It's just, it's in my blood.
[03:39:04.782 --> 03:39:05.402]  You know, it is what it is.
[03:39:05.402 --> 03:39:06.122]  You gotta be who you are.
[03:39:06.122 --> 03:39:07.243]  Gotta be who you are.
[03:39:07.243 --> 03:39:08.043]  Exactly.
[03:39:08.043 --> 03:39:10.604]  And it's about time we just draw this line right here.
[03:39:10.604 --> 03:39:11.364]  Enough's enough.
[03:39:11.364 --> 03:39:14.185]  That's why, you know, I can sit here and I just want to say one thing.
[03:39:14.966 --> 03:39:15.826]  Products are awesome.
[03:39:15.826 --> 03:39:18.547]  Cal Alex, thank you very much for the Redtail Plus.
[03:39:18.547 --> 03:39:21.148]  And my wife really likes what the Pistachio Room Boost does to me.
[03:39:21.148 --> 03:39:22.908]  I'll just say that.
[03:39:22.908 --> 03:39:24.409]  Oh, I bet she does.
[03:39:24.409 --> 03:39:27.589]  Shout out to the wife!
[03:39:27.589 --> 03:39:31.471]  But if you could just do me a favor, just if you guys can get through to Mr. Royce White.
[03:39:31.471 --> 03:39:36.472]  I know he's going to run up here and take care of that bureaucratic Becky, Mrs. Klobuchar.
[03:39:37.426 --> 03:39:51.118]  Just, um, talked to him about trying to restart up all the coal and everything, all the Iron Rangers up in Minnesota, because, uh, our, uh, awesome leader, Mr. Tim Walz, you know, for some odd reason, you know, you breathe carbon and, oh, yep, you gotta tax that right there.
[03:39:51.118 --> 03:39:55.542]  So he doesn't realize that the infrastructure is killing everything around the metro area.
[03:39:55.542 --> 03:39:58.464]  So you can just kind of- Ultimately, it's meant to kill you.
[03:39:58.464 --> 03:40:00.046]  Put my boys up in Duluth.
[03:40:00.046 --> 03:40:01.487]  Yeah, right.
[03:40:01.487 --> 03:40:01.627]  Yeah.
[03:40:03.486 --> 03:40:05.707]  Man, we'll waste your time, but God bless you guys.
[03:40:05.707 --> 03:40:09.088]  Keep kicking the crap out of these sociopaths.
[03:40:09.088 --> 03:40:11.108]  And yeah, God bless you.
[03:40:11.108 --> 03:40:11.528]  You got it.
[03:40:11.528 --> 03:40:12.929]  Thank you so much for your support.
[03:40:12.929 --> 03:40:14.349]  Chuck from Minnesota.
[03:40:14.349 --> 03:40:22.491]  We have another Californian, Blade Runner from California, the turning point for America.
[03:40:22.491 --> 03:40:24.752]  Blade Runner, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:40:24.752 --> 03:40:27.432]  Good afternoon.
[03:40:27.432 --> 03:40:28.553]  All right.
[03:40:28.553 --> 03:40:32.974]  I am not, I'm not, my message isn't going to sound nice.
[03:40:33.482 --> 03:40:34.903]  Okay.
[03:40:34.903 --> 03:40:35.903]  Go for it.
[03:40:35.903 --> 03:40:39.385]  I am absolutely fed up.
[03:40:39.385 --> 03:40:48.290]  I've been with Alex Jones from the beginning, when we had the little Belgian radios, the Berkey water filters, when he was on shortwave.
[03:40:48.290 --> 03:40:57.094]  I've bought the coins, I've bought the shirts, I've bought the books, I've spent money, I've bought all of this, I've bought the towels, I've bought the sandals, I've bought all this.
[03:40:57.094 --> 03:40:58.635]  But do you know what I'm sick of?
[03:40:58.635 --> 03:41:02.357]  I'm sick of our side when you say, this is what's going on.
[03:41:02.921 --> 03:41:06.883]  When it's time to put your foot in her ass.
[03:41:06.883 --> 03:41:09.224]  You guys go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:41:09.224 --> 03:41:15.267]  Lexi, you think you guys, I swear, you Bible thumpers, you're so heavenly bound.
[03:41:15.267 --> 03:41:17.268]  You're no earthly good.
[03:41:17.268 --> 03:41:17.888]  I'm with that.
[03:41:17.888 --> 03:41:22.390]  I love the Lord just like you, and God loves you guys.
[03:41:22.390 --> 03:41:23.651]  But do you know what?
[03:41:23.651 --> 03:41:27.612]  I have fought this dog called the federal government.
[03:41:27.612 --> 03:41:28.933]  I have lost everything.
[03:41:29.560 --> 03:41:33.561]  I've gone to prison, I've gone to jail, I've lost my family, lost my wife.
[03:41:33.561 --> 03:41:37.843]  I have been nose-to-nose, teeth-to-teeth with these dogs.
[03:41:37.843 --> 03:41:40.404]  And they don't care what you believe in.
[03:41:40.404 --> 03:41:42.925]  You know what they respect?
[03:41:42.925 --> 03:41:46.646]  The only thing they respect is a punch in the nose.
[03:41:46.646 --> 03:41:52.388]  If you think I'm just gonna sit around and let them burn me alive,
[03:41:53.044 --> 03:41:54.384]  Like they did in Waco.
[03:41:54.384 --> 03:41:56.265]  Like they did in Hawaii.
[03:41:56.265 --> 03:41:58.325]  And you guys just sit there like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:41:58.325 --> 03:41:58.885]  They're doing this.
[03:41:58.885 --> 03:42:00.146]  They're coming after you.
[03:42:00.146 --> 03:42:05.167]  No matter what you do, they're going to declare you a scumbag terrorist.
[03:42:05.167 --> 03:42:12.669]  If those people at J6, if they had shown up with their Second Amendment instead of a sign, yeah, would they have lost?
[03:42:12.669 --> 03:42:14.229]  Most probably, yeah.
[03:42:14.229 --> 03:42:20.671]  But those that are sitting in jail right now, they wish they had done more than just
[03:42:21.061 --> 03:42:26.385]  Petition the government, hat in hand, oh please give me back my rights.
[03:42:26.385 --> 03:42:39.253]  Sooner or later, whether you guys, all you podcasters, like it or not, whether you think I'm right or wrong, you are going to have to fight, like it or not.
[03:42:39.253 --> 03:42:40.194]  Plain and simple.
[03:42:40.194 --> 03:42:46.778]  You can criticize me all day, but I'm telling you, they are worse than you ever really want to know.
[03:42:50.555 --> 03:42:56.600]  I lost everything, everything, for the cause of liberty and freedom.
[03:42:56.600 --> 03:42:59.943]  I swore an oath to protect my country.
[03:42:59.943 --> 03:43:13.134]  And I told my own kids, I said, if you threaten my liberty, my grandson's liberty and freedom, you're just as big an enemy as some thug with a badge and a boot ready to put it on my neck.
[03:43:16.523 --> 03:43:17.804]  Let me ask you this.
[03:43:17.804 --> 03:43:20.686]  I understand your frustration, brother.
[03:43:20.686 --> 03:43:22.988]  As a brother, I'm just speaking to you as a Christian, man.
[03:43:22.988 --> 03:43:34.876]  I understand the tyranny and the persecution and the frustration and the targeting of this satanic entity that's happening all around us.
[03:43:34.876 --> 03:43:42.982]  When you say that people are heavenly minded, they're no earthly good, is that to discredit the Christian faith?
[03:43:42.982 --> 03:43:44.123]  That even in the face of
[03:43:45.069 --> 03:43:50.233]  Absolute mass tyranny and persecution like the Apostle Paul.
[03:43:50.233 --> 03:43:53.536]  Was he no earthly good because he was heavenly minded?
[03:43:53.536 --> 03:43:56.598]  I'm not trying to, you know, mess with your head.
[03:43:56.598 --> 03:44:03.783]  I just have a genuine question because I hear your pain and I hear your hurt, but ultimately isn't heaven our home?
[03:44:03.783 --> 03:44:05.885]  Yeah, you know where the pain comes from?
[03:44:05.885 --> 03:44:11.309]  It comes from you don't like being, you don't like that phrase as a Christian.
[03:44:11.309 --> 03:44:11.609]  Really?
[03:44:11.609 --> 03:44:13.651]  Do you think no more than I
[03:44:14.378 --> 03:44:17.782]  As a former militiaman, there's still a few of us left.
[03:44:17.782 --> 03:44:19.464]  Like old Jedi Knights.
[03:44:19.464 --> 03:44:20.985]  We're so scattered.
[03:44:20.985 --> 03:44:22.106]  We've been hunted.
[03:44:22.106 --> 03:44:23.087]  So badly.
[03:44:23.087 --> 03:44:24.689]  There's a few of us left.
[03:44:24.689 --> 03:44:26.291]  But by God, man.
[03:44:26.291 --> 03:44:27.092]  Every time, like, hey!
[03:44:27.717 --> 03:44:31.902]  You know, when we say, you know what, the only way you're going to get out of this is if you fight.
[03:44:31.902 --> 03:44:33.083]  Oh, you're a fag.
[03:44:33.083 --> 03:44:34.184]  Don't you do it.
[03:44:34.184 --> 03:44:35.365]  Peace is the only way.
[03:44:35.365 --> 03:44:46.418]  Sing Kumbaya and just stand in a circle and just, you know, they'll leave us alone if we just stand there and tell them, please leave us alone.
[03:44:46.418 --> 03:44:47.479]  Give us our rights.
[03:44:47.479 --> 03:44:47.599]  No.
[03:44:48.325 --> 03:45:07.317]  Like I said, when I say, uh, don't be so heavenly bound, you know, earthly good, like I said, I love the Lord, the same as Jesus Christ, but don't stand there and do nothing and let them burn you alive, rape your children, put pedophiles in schools, take your rights away, but yet you're gonna still be like,
[03:45:07.935 --> 03:45:14.437]  You know, we believe in peace and everything will be fine, and we'll do this the regular way.
[03:45:14.437 --> 03:45:16.018]  They don't care about the Bill of Rights.
[03:45:16.018 --> 03:45:18.239]  They don't care about the Constitution.
[03:45:18.239 --> 03:45:20.579]  The country is already in shambles.
[03:45:20.579 --> 03:45:25.561]  Every city that's run by a Democrat is a hellscape.
[03:45:25.561 --> 03:45:28.502]  It's already hell on earth.
[03:45:28.502 --> 03:45:31.203]  It's already gonna go bad.
[03:45:31.203 --> 03:45:35.384]  You'd rather stand and fight for something, man.
[03:45:35.384 --> 03:45:35.885]  God!
[03:45:35.885 --> 03:45:36.385]  Blade Runner!
[03:45:37.483 --> 03:45:38.144]  A Blade Runner.
[03:45:38.144 --> 03:45:39.945]  I mean, that's the name on the call.
[03:45:39.945 --> 03:45:42.166]  Let's say you're the President of the United States right now.
[03:45:42.166 --> 03:45:49.171]  What would you do?
[03:45:49.171 --> 03:45:52.093]  Unite the red states.
[03:45:52.093 --> 03:45:54.674]  Declare martial law and start arresting.
[03:45:54.674 --> 03:46:03.500]  If you're a socialist, or you're a socialist or communist, or you've broken your oath, whether you be a judge or a border patrol agent,
[03:46:04.605 --> 03:46:05.806]  You lose your power.
[03:46:05.806 --> 03:46:10.367]  D.A.s, George Soros D.A.s.
[03:46:10.367 --> 03:46:11.468]  Everybody loses their power.
[03:46:11.468 --> 03:46:17.190]  You bring back the citizen militia, the committees of safety.
[03:46:17.190 --> 03:46:18.931]  I say we deport them.
[03:46:18.931 --> 03:46:19.751]  I say we deport them.
[03:46:19.751 --> 03:46:22.913]  Why don't we deport them?
[03:46:22.913 --> 03:46:24.673]  No, fair trial.
[03:46:24.673 --> 03:46:27.835]  We are still the United States.
[03:46:27.835 --> 03:46:30.656]  Everybody, we do the moral authority.
[03:46:30.656 --> 03:46:32.516]  We do what they should have done.
[03:46:32.516 --> 03:46:33.697]  You get a fair trial.
[03:46:34.215 --> 03:46:36.616]  You get to state your case.
[03:46:36.616 --> 03:46:40.258]  So you do still want to abide by the law?
[03:46:40.258 --> 03:46:41.519]  Yes.
[03:46:41.519 --> 03:46:42.380]  Okay, I gotcha.
[03:46:42.380 --> 03:46:46.722]  I just wanted to... I'm a little different.
[03:46:46.722 --> 03:46:48.543]  I might be a little more far-right than you.
[03:46:48.543 --> 03:46:51.505]  I say we just deport all communists.
[03:46:51.505 --> 03:46:52.165]  Deport them.
[03:46:52.165 --> 03:46:53.245]  Deport all the pedophiles.
[03:46:53.245 --> 03:46:54.266]  Deport all the communists.
[03:46:54.266 --> 03:46:56.547]  Deport all the socialists, the traitors.
[03:46:56.547 --> 03:46:58.388]  Deport all the infiltrators.
[03:46:58.388 --> 03:46:58.889]  Deport them all.
[03:46:58.889 --> 03:47:00.830]  Get them all the hell out of here.
[03:47:00.830 --> 03:47:01.310]  Why are they here?
[03:47:02.188 --> 03:47:04.950]  Why are we allowing these people to stay in our country?
[03:47:04.950 --> 03:47:18.799]  Why are we allowing people in this country to remain that are obviously facilitating the destruction of the United States of America in positions of power, members of media, politics, in culture, music industry, you name it!
[03:47:18.799 --> 03:47:19.939]  Why don't we just mass deport them?
[03:47:19.939 --> 03:47:22.281]  Get them the hell out of here!
[03:47:22.281 --> 03:47:25.863]  Hey bruh, I don't want a man in an arena.
[03:47:25.863 --> 03:47:27.504]  I want generals.
[03:47:27.504 --> 03:47:28.805]  We will survive this.
[03:47:30.146 --> 03:47:31.287]  They already are!
[03:47:59.426 --> 03:48:02.233]  Into a big mass toilet.
[03:48:02.233 --> 03:48:03.597]  And then you'll say, what?
[03:48:03.597 --> 03:48:05.782]  Remember Gulag Acapulco?
[03:48:05.782 --> 03:48:08.048]  People will wish they had done more.
[03:48:10.063 --> 03:48:10.303]  I agree.
[03:48:10.303 --> 03:48:14.907]  I think a lot of people, I think a lot of people share the way that you feel right now.
[03:48:14.907 --> 03:48:15.447]  And I do too.
[03:48:15.447 --> 03:48:19.330]  That's why I'm, that's why I, dude, I'm, I'm, I'm just being totally transparent with you right now.
[03:48:19.330 --> 03:48:23.013]  Like I'm, I'm in a place too, where I'm like, dude, let's just get them the hell out of here.
[03:48:23.013 --> 03:48:30.099]  I don't screw the screw of sitting down and having a conversation with a commie and these pedophiles and these homosexual infiltrators.
[03:48:30.099 --> 03:48:31.500]  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm over it, dude.
[03:48:31.500 --> 03:48:32.581]  Let's just get them the hell out of here.
[03:48:33.221 --> 03:48:34.323]  And all the mass illegals.
[03:48:34.323 --> 03:48:35.604]  Just mass deportation.
[03:48:35.604 --> 03:48:37.126]  Just get them all the hell out of here.
[03:48:37.126 --> 03:48:38.087]  Keep all the Christians.
[03:48:38.087 --> 03:48:39.789]  We need Christian supremacy.
[03:48:39.789 --> 03:48:43.454]  We need Christian supremacy in the United States government and in U.S.
[03:48:43.454 --> 03:48:43.694]  culture.
[03:48:44.810 --> 03:48:46.051]  I'm telling you, bro.
[03:49:14.950 --> 03:49:16.751]  They don't care.
[03:49:16.751 --> 03:49:19.213]  Look what they're doing to Trump.
[03:49:19.213 --> 03:49:21.595]  It doesn't matter about the statute of limitations.
[03:49:21.595 --> 03:49:24.297]  They were going to do this way before.
[03:49:24.297 --> 03:49:27.819]  They don't care about the law, only when it suits them.
[03:49:27.819 --> 03:49:33.964]  If we do not reunite now as a people, when red states say, I agree.
[03:49:33.964 --> 03:49:36.085]  This is our, we're going to keep these states.
[03:49:36.085 --> 03:49:39.367]  And if you're liberal, you don't like what we leave, get out.
[03:49:39.367 --> 03:49:43.871]  But if we stay where we are, they're going to pick us off one by one, baby.
[03:49:43.871 --> 03:49:44.331]  One by one.
[03:49:45.461 --> 03:49:46.241]  I agree.
[03:49:46.241 --> 03:49:47.102]  Totally agree, man.
[03:49:47.102 --> 03:49:48.802]  Hey, thank you for the call.
[03:49:48.802 --> 03:49:52.523]  Thanks for hanging out with me and speaking on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:49:52.523 --> 03:49:52.943]  Alrighty, guys.
[03:49:52.943 --> 03:49:54.904]  I don't know if we have any more calls.
[03:49:54.904 --> 03:49:57.905]  If we do, you guys can send me if there's anybody else.
[03:49:57.905 --> 03:50:04.467]  But, you know, I think a lot of people, guys, are ending up in this position.
[03:50:04.467 --> 03:50:06.687]  And listen, that's why I'm coming out.
[03:50:06.687 --> 03:50:08.348]  Everybody knows where I stand on these things.
[03:50:09.561 --> 03:50:10.141]  You know what I mean?
[03:50:10.141 --> 03:50:11.882]  Like, I think we need mass deportations.
[03:50:11.882 --> 03:50:19.986]  I'm sick of conservatives and right-wingers that never actually want to actually address the real issues to start.
[03:50:19.986 --> 03:50:22.027]  But I know, you know, I understand it.
[03:50:22.027 --> 03:50:24.168]  We are 100%.
[03:50:24.168 --> 03:50:25.209]  We are living in an era.
[03:50:25.209 --> 03:50:30.691]  We are living in a time where we are not dealing with political disagreeance.
[03:50:30.691 --> 03:50:34.373]  We are not dealing with entities here that want to have a conversation with you.
[03:50:34.975 --> 03:50:57.086]  You know, this is my biggest frustration, not with the caller, I'm saying my biggest frustration with the current American conservative right is we, we, we, we, we, let's see, because look, look, that caller right there, that caller right there, that caller wouldn't be allowed to speak on some conservative right wing, you know, network.
[03:50:57.931 --> 03:51:00.093]  Or like Fox News or anything like that.
[03:51:00.093 --> 03:51:03.615]  That's considered a little too extreme.
[03:51:03.615 --> 03:51:06.398]  That's why I came out and said what I needed to say.
[03:51:06.398 --> 03:51:14.924]  But the fact is, what we do, and when I say we, I'm not speaking of myself, is conservative right-wing media.
[03:51:14.924 --> 03:51:16.085]  They shoot their radicals.
[03:51:17.068 --> 03:51:25.413]  They get someone that comes up and says, well, Christ supremacy, or they get someone that comes out and says, you know, we're getting like really sick of all these pedophiles infiltrating our government.
[03:51:25.413 --> 03:51:31.617]  Why don't we institute the death penalty once and for all across the entire board for all pedophiles in the United States?
[03:51:31.617 --> 03:51:33.118]  Oh, that's too far right.
[03:51:33.118 --> 03:51:33.958]  That's too far.
[03:51:33.958 --> 03:51:35.899]  And the left won't say that.
[03:51:35.899 --> 03:51:41.563]  It's the conservatives that are liberally minded on the right that'll come out and shoot their own radicals.
[03:51:41.563 --> 03:51:43.964]  I'm not saying I advocate for violence.
[03:51:43.964 --> 03:51:45.485]  I advocate for self-defense.
[03:51:45.485 --> 03:51:46.386]  I'm in agreeance.
[03:51:47.392 --> 03:52:00.422]  That if this federal government, full-blown, full-authoritarian, raiding your homes to the extent of pulling out your families, and they're violating your entire civil liberties, civil rights, and it's getting closer and closer to there.
[03:52:00.422 --> 03:52:02.323]  That's what the Second Amendment's for.
[03:52:02.323 --> 03:52:06.447]  To defend ourselves from a tyrannical government.
[03:52:06.447 --> 03:52:07.427]  I don't have a disagreeance there.
[03:52:07.427 --> 03:52:11.611]  I think that's, constitutionally, that's accurate.
[03:52:11.611 --> 03:52:14.513]  But what I'm saying is, I think
[03:52:15.672 --> 03:52:24.779]  Whenever you get someone that has a radical idea, you don't silence them, you don't shut them up, you don't, you know, cut off any collars, you let them talk.
[03:52:24.779 --> 03:52:32.344]  Because what I'm sick of is, I'm sick of like the American right shooting anyone that has a radical idea, silencing and suppressing them.
[03:52:32.344 --> 03:52:37.268]  This has happened to Infowars, this has happened to myself, this has happened to many people.
[03:52:37.268 --> 03:52:44.453]  What the left does, and I believe the UTA party exists, what the American left does, they prop up their radicals.
[03:52:45.677 --> 03:52:48.359]  They prop up the radical commies.
[03:52:48.359 --> 03:52:52.122]  They prop up the radical Cori Bushes and the AOCs.
[03:52:52.122 --> 03:52:53.703]  They prop up the Bernie Sanders.
[03:52:53.703 --> 03:53:01.188]  They prop up the puppet Joe Biden with all of his criminal activity and his crime family and Kamala Harris that's totally mindless.
[03:53:01.188 --> 03:53:06.532]  They prop up their radicals on their side of the conversation.
[03:53:06.532 --> 03:53:07.572]  They elevate them.
[03:53:07.572 --> 03:53:09.073]  They fully fund them.
[03:53:09.073 --> 03:53:10.815]  The George Soros's of the world.
[03:53:10.815 --> 03:53:14.117]  They fully pour billions of dollars into their organizations.
[03:53:14.952 --> 03:53:17.714]  They reward Antifa.
[03:53:17.714 --> 03:53:18.975]  They reward BLM.
[03:53:18.975 --> 03:53:21.937]  They caused over $2 billion in insurance damage in 2020.
[03:53:21.937 --> 03:53:25.319]  I was there, I covered all of it in 2020.
[03:53:25.319 --> 03:53:29.362]  Kenosha, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, New York, you name it.
[03:53:29.362 --> 03:53:30.442]  You name it.
[03:53:30.442 --> 03:53:35.626]  DC, the Stop the Steal rallies in Antifa, bashing the brains of Trump supporters.
[03:53:35.626 --> 03:53:38.067]  I covered it all, okay?
[03:53:38.067 --> 03:53:40.169]  What, three years later?
[03:53:40.169 --> 03:53:41.710]  Now these BLM activists
[03:53:42.609 --> 03:53:46.131]  Antifa activists, they're obviously domestic terrorists in my opinion.
[03:53:46.131 --> 03:53:49.973]  I mean, I've watched these people, I've been undercover around these people.
[03:53:49.973 --> 03:53:53.654]  Now they're suing police departments for getting kettled.
[03:53:53.654 --> 03:53:57.976]  For getting kettled, for burning down buildings, which they absolutely should have been.
[03:53:57.976 --> 03:54:02.339]  Oh, for aggressive force by the police officers.
[03:54:02.339 --> 03:54:09.222]  What that side of the aisle does is, and they're winning these lawsuits, they're getting massive payouts of millions of dollars.
[03:54:10.600 --> 03:54:29.533]  Well, you get conservative right-wing media that'll sit here and say, well, we need to make sure that, you know, I sit here live on air and I look like a good little boy and I'm not trying to offend anybody because I don't want them to, you know, accuse me of what they're already going to accuse me of.
[03:54:29.533 --> 03:54:34.076]  I'm not going to sit here and give them a reason to call me what they're already calling me.
[03:54:34.076 --> 03:54:38.019]  I'm trying to appease some, like, see, that's what I don't understand.
[03:54:38.019 --> 03:54:39.640]  Like, who are you trying to appease?
[03:54:40.546 --> 03:54:51.430]  And I'm talking about like right-wing media does this, because that side of things, they prop up all their radicals, they reward them, they give them millions of dollars of payouts, and they start really young?
[03:54:51.430 --> 03:54:57.672]  That's one thing that the radical left, I think, has embraced, is the next generation of things.
[03:54:58.533 --> 03:55:08.281]  But then you get right-wing spaces where all of these, you know, old wineskin, you know, boomers that don't want to let anybody young through the door to come in and, you know, pass the baton.
[03:55:08.281 --> 03:55:12.564]  That's what I love about Alex so much is he's willing to pass the baton to the next generation.
[03:55:12.564 --> 03:55:18.489]  He could clearly identify what's coming and who has the heart to move forward.
[03:55:18.489 --> 03:55:20.711]  But in right-wing spaces, it's the total opposite.
[03:55:20.711 --> 03:55:22.692]  And then we wonder why we lose.
[03:55:22.692 --> 03:55:24.774]  And then we wonder why we never gain any ground.
[03:55:26.317 --> 03:55:27.818]  Because we shoot our own.
[03:55:27.818 --> 03:55:28.919]  We silence our own.
[03:55:28.919 --> 03:55:33.401]  Anyone that's radical that comes out and that points out the obvious.
[03:55:33.401 --> 03:55:36.323]  That yes, we'll get you cancelled.
[03:55:36.323 --> 03:55:38.784]  We'll make you a target.
[03:55:38.784 --> 03:55:41.726]  Yes, we'll make you look like a psycho person.
[03:55:41.726 --> 03:55:43.927]  But we're dealing with psychotic people!
[03:55:43.927 --> 03:55:51.752]  We're dealing with people that literally want to abduct your children in the name of LGBTQ if you don't accept your child's pronouns.
[03:55:51.752 --> 03:55:53.713]  We're dealing with people that praise
[03:55:54.577 --> 03:56:00.602]  The weaponization of the FBI and the CIA and the three-letter intelligence agencies.
[03:56:00.602 --> 03:56:01.462]  So I understand.
[03:56:01.462 --> 03:56:02.643]  I understand the frustration.
[03:56:02.643 --> 03:56:09.008]  I understand, especially when it comes to being in right-wing media spaces.
[03:56:09.008 --> 03:56:14.173]  It makes sense to me, because I think that's quite literally how controlled opposition is designed.
[03:56:21.846 --> 03:56:30.772]  To function that way, to give you an illusion that there's only two selections, to give you an illusion, well, there are two different sides that are going head to head with one another.
[03:56:30.772 --> 03:56:36.876]  That there are two different sides that are disagreeing with each other.
[03:56:36.876 --> 03:56:44.681]  When in reality, you have one side that props up their radicals, and in reality, you have another side of the Uniparty that silences.
[03:56:44.681 --> 03:56:49.965]  And when I say radicals, I'm talking about people that are coming out and just straight up calling it for what it is.
[03:56:51.068 --> 03:57:06.858]  You're just calling it for what it is when it comes to the weaponization of the intelligence agencies, the weaponization of the FBI, the frustration of these people, you know, coming in and launching lawfare and tons of warfare on you.
[03:57:06.858 --> 03:57:09.279]  I understand the frustration.
[03:57:09.279 --> 03:57:10.840]  I get that.
[03:57:10.840 --> 03:57:16.824]  But I think that happens a lot in right-wing spaces, especially media spaces, where the radicals get shot.
[03:57:16.824 --> 03:57:18.125]  The Alex Joneses get shot.
[03:57:19.099 --> 03:57:21.682]  The Drew Hernandez, the Owen Schroyers, they get shot!
[03:57:21.682 --> 03:57:22.923]  They're not allowed!
[03:57:22.923 --> 03:57:28.029]  It's only till after the FBI has come after Owen Schroyer does he get invited anywhere, right?
[03:57:28.029 --> 03:57:36.097]  It's only after the FBI has fully launched their lawfare against Owen Schroyer does he get invited on all these giant podcasts.
[03:57:36.097 --> 03:57:37.398]  But what about before?
[03:57:37.398 --> 03:57:39.240]  No, Owen Schroyer was too radical.
[03:57:39.240 --> 03:57:40.602]  That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[03:57:41.204 --> 03:57:42.205]  Shout out to the Infowar.
