[00:00.000 --> 00:12.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.280 --> 00:22.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones the quote
[00:22.080 --> 00:29.360]  to be see boys I wear a hat not a visor I drink Bud wiser and the reason I'm being
[00:29.360 --> 00:38.240]  silly is we have Matt visor from the Boston Globe he's going to be joining us in studio today I
[00:38.240 --> 00:45.000]  don't have time to do an interview after the show or before the show and we've got Al Jazeera
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.240]  flying into town to interview me I'm on Ellen Cums radio show all that said because I'm so
[00:50.240 --> 00:56.840]  afraid to be interviewed with that whole stunt ABC this week pulled that is still in newspapers
[00:56.840 --> 01:03.000]  every day it's just Alex Jones won't defend himself on Jade Helm the coward and now one of
[01:03.000 --> 01:07.640]  the Fox News the five guys says though we're not going to have you on via tweets in fact I've
[01:07.640 --> 01:10.960]  got Joe Biggs printing them off right now he's gonna come in and talk about it because Joe's
[01:10.960 --> 01:16.400]  been tweeting back and forth with him staff reporter Joe Biggs former staff sergeant Joe Biggs
[01:16.400 --> 01:28.600]  now this particular Fox News five host wants to meet me at the corner of some street in New York
[01:28.600 --> 01:35.120]  City for a fist fight you know that was a joke about us getting in the ring dumbass but if you
[01:35.120 --> 01:39.480]  really want to that's fine but I do it legally and lawfully wherever they allow bare knuckles
[01:39.480 --> 01:44.760]  boxing okay we can like fly to some third-world country and have pay-per-view I think we probably
[01:44.760 --> 01:49.360]  make about ten million dollars a piece but you're too stupid to want to actually do that you want
[01:49.360 --> 01:55.360]  to dance to the puppeteers the orders they're at Fox News and make crap up and I don't mean to
[01:55.360 --> 02:04.560]  diverse and and to diverge off into side issues and I apologize but Matt Visor will be in studio
[02:04.560 --> 02:11.360]  first he said oh my editors won't let me interview live and I said fine we can't do it so now he
[02:11.360 --> 02:15.120]  should get here in a few minutes we'll see if that happens and then they can interview me about
[02:15.120 --> 02:22.600]  imaginary Jade Helm according to them coming up and like I told ABC News Fox News everybody I
[02:22.600 --> 02:30.160]  stand ready anytime live they've got scores of satellite uplinks downtown Austin I am a hundred
[02:30.160 --> 02:42.840]  and ten percent ready to face you anytime anywhere anyplace live L I V E L I V E now at this point
[02:42.840 --> 02:48.600]  I'm just going to open my veins politically you want to come take stuff go ahead to but here's
[02:48.600 --> 02:52.960]  that here's the proviso and I was going to do this when I did a tape with them but then they
[02:52.960 --> 02:57.880]  wouldn't respond I'm going to tape it like I did once with CNN by five years ago when they
[02:57.880 --> 03:04.600]  needed to air it for Anderson Cooper and I'm going to have a crew member there with a camera
[03:04.600 --> 03:12.280]  videotaping what I had to say the CNN wouldn't let us jack in and record their questions but we're
[03:12.280 --> 03:19.400]  going to have what I said so when you don't air it or you edited it we'll at least have that and
[03:19.400 --> 03:24.600]  that's how this works we are not going to let you play your sneaky underhanded tricks anymore
[03:24.600 --> 03:31.720]  you backbiting crew of scallywags that's just how this works we're done with you we know you're
[03:31.720 --> 03:37.440]  not media your propagandist and we are not backing down we are not standing down we are not going
[03:37.440 --> 03:43.840]  away now a week ago we're having such victories against Monsanto I had Nico start working on
[03:43.840 --> 03:51.280]  a Alex I hate to interrupt I just got a text from him he said Mr. Visor said another editor was
[03:51.280 --> 03:57.480]  leery of this interview to go on the air so he's backing out now they'll say I backed out though
[03:57.480 --> 04:00.920]  yeah now he's backed out can we show the text without showing your phone yeah I'll show you
[04:00.920 --> 04:04.280]  this right here listen this is what I've told David Knight and I've told you I'm telling myself
[04:04.280 --> 04:10.200]  now so when I'm lecturing you you're not bad I'm telling myself this we're gonna shut down if we
[04:10.200 --> 04:15.800]  keep responding to all these reports I mean hundreds of articles a day dozens of requests
[04:15.800 --> 04:23.800]  today I'm so busy I can't even you know do really important stuff like you know have a
[04:23.800 --> 04:31.440]  phone call with Michael Savage so we need to only go with the big interviews because we have to do
[04:31.440 --> 04:37.800]  this dance all these reporters all their little neurotic you know OCD editors BS so I just said
[04:37.800 --> 04:41.920]  they probably wouldn't show up that's good we're done so I don't have time to talk to him now
[04:41.920 --> 04:46.200]  we've already talked to him last night this morning on through all these justiculations I told him I
[04:46.200 --> 04:50.600]  do a phone interview with him today when I'm in traffic driving home to pick my kids up but that's
[04:50.600 --> 04:55.240]  it we're done talking to him okay they want to have a stand-up fight we'll have it but we're not
[04:55.240 --> 05:01.640]  gonna play patty cake with these reporters we'll be back alarming video footage shows a US Marines
[05:01.640 --> 05:07.960]  training drill which in plain English was about subduing arresting and incarcerating irate citizens
[05:07.960 --> 05:13.880]  during a martial law style scenario the exercise took place on April 18th in Yuma Arizona and
[05:13.880 --> 05:19.560]  revolved around assault support tactics training the video shows Marines practicing apprehending

[09:50.160 --> 10:00.680]  because it is true things are mounting right now in a big big big way because the public is
[10:00.680 --> 10:09.000]  investigating the military is leaking vital information to the republic there is a battle
[10:09.000 --> 10:16.720]  for the future of this country and the world right now if you go to info wars.com you can
[10:16.720 --> 10:26.120]  see the red link story video marines practice subduing citizens inside internment camp it's
[10:26.120 --> 10:35.360]  linked on drugs report dot com on the right hand side under the headline texas landowners paid to
[10:35.360 --> 10:41.560]  give up property for troop training but the pentagon lied and said that it was volunteered
[10:41.560 --> 10:51.040]  beforehand how asinine defiant rancher refuses to surrender home to the military it continues
[10:51.040 --> 10:59.160]  marines practice subduing citizens inside internment camp here's another headline rogue
[10:59.160 --> 11:07.920]  military drone lands in man's backyard yes my friends we are not in Kansas anymore as they say
[11:07.920 --> 11:18.720]  and the other news just gets even more insane it's hard to believe now that it's like a year ago
[11:18.720 --> 11:25.880]  that jacari jackson adan salazar and others went down to talk to our border patrol ice connections
[11:25.880 --> 11:36.760]  and boom there it was the video the border patrol loading the illegals on the buses giving them
[11:36.760 --> 11:43.280]  vouchers and busting them into the u.s. it took the new york times five weeks to put in a story
[11:43.280 --> 11:49.800]  that indeed that was true we got no credit for it that's just a sensational story then the
[11:49.800 --> 11:54.840]  border patrol came out on fox news and said yes we complete the smuggling process close quote the
[11:54.840 --> 12:04.040]  deputy head of the union quote we complete the smuggling process effective search border patrol
[12:04.040 --> 12:13.360]  agent we complete the smuggling process we'll cue that video up now there is video and world
[12:13.360 --> 12:22.920]  that daily has a story dhs caught caught busting in some mollies from mexican border directly
[12:22.920 --> 12:36.240]  from the main hotbed of isis recruiting in north africa you cannot make that up you cannot the
[12:36.240 --> 12:40.040]  u.s. is bringing in a hundred thousand muslims every year through legal channels such as the
[12:40.040 --> 12:45.920]  united nations refugee program but now there's a whole another secret program and how do they
[12:45.920 --> 12:49.800]  bring all the illegals into england remember that secret program tony blair was involved and I
[12:49.800 --> 12:53.840]  remember covering the secret program was coming out in the late 90s people said oh there's not a
[12:53.840 --> 13:06.040]  secret program he apologized for it two weeks ago because he's hated for it so let me explain
[13:06.040 --> 13:15.640]  something they're they're bringing in people from known terrorist hotbeds but the marines are
[13:15.640 --> 13:23.800]  training to take on the american people and if i was allowed to get on controlled corporate
[13:23.800 --> 13:34.840]  brainwashing media abc cbs nbc ms nbc fox if i was on the five i would just quote eisenhower
[13:35.880 --> 13:42.440]  we must guard in the councils of government against the unwarranted influence of the military
[13:42.440 --> 13:52.600]  industrial complex whether sought or unsought it goes into the danger exist and will persist
[13:54.280 --> 14:00.360]  of a technological takeover by the elite get to read the whole quote in fact we've done this before
[14:00.360 --> 14:06.600]  but i really want to just get it where we go into the whole speech it's on pbs online it's on youtube
[14:06.600 --> 14:09.880]  and it's a 21 minute speech but i want to get the whole part about the technological elite
[14:09.880 --> 14:15.320]  taking over and then how they control the military industrial complex because no one
[14:15.320 --> 14:21.240]  seems to know the first part that's the most important part in fact if you pull up the text
[14:21.240 --> 14:25.960]  of eisenhower's farewell address on screen i can just read it word for word for people
[14:25.960 --> 14:32.280]  because i mean no wonder they can't debate me but say i'm a coward on fox to go on shows and
[14:32.280 --> 14:38.200]  then they're not having me on or i won't go on abc and again it's not about me it's about their
[14:38.200 --> 14:47.960]  decepticons people they are liars who believes i wouldn't want to go on those shows it's just
[14:47.960 --> 14:53.640]  it's just flabbergast me and we're now four days after it became a national news story that i'm
[14:53.640 --> 14:59.720]  chicken and i've gotten nico have we gotten any calls or emails uh today since i asked yesterday
[14:59.720 --> 15:08.280]  from abc to have me on this sunday when uh negative negative and then they may just say i didn't
[15:08.280 --> 15:14.120]  show up next week again i mean why not msnbc says that i influenced the boston bombers
[15:14.120 --> 15:20.120]  then show no proof how about i ran the holocaust how about i crucified christ how about i blew up
[15:20.120 --> 15:31.960]  the lucetania not a german u boat not a wolf pack they found the eisenhower speech
[15:35.000 --> 15:42.680]  do me a favor ctrl f technological now there's a quote in the councils of government
[15:42.680 --> 15:45.960]  we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or
[15:45.960 --> 15:50.280]  unsought by the military initial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced
[15:50.280 --> 15:58.360]  power exists and will persist yeah but now control f technological or elite and then you'll get the
[15:58.360 --> 16:09.720]  part about the takeover yeah there you go and if technological is in there a bunch you just keep
[16:09.720 --> 16:15.880]  hitting inner on the f and it'll search to the point there it is yet in holding scientific
[16:15.880 --> 16:20.840]  research and discovery in respect as we should we must also be alert to the equal and opposite
[16:20.840 --> 16:25.880]  danger that the public policy could itself become the captive of a technological elite
[16:28.440 --> 16:31.560]  and then it goes on to how it's the it's the task of statesmen
[16:32.680 --> 16:39.000]  to not allow elites to use super technology to brainwash and dumb down the public or to gain
[16:39.000 --> 16:48.760]  the economy and everything we see today a high quality stake six seven years ago was 25 dollars
[16:48.760 --> 16:58.120]  in a decent steakhouse it was 45 dollars two three years ago it was 60 dollars six months ago
[16:58.120 --> 17:05.480]  the exact same stake at the exact same steakhouse that i've been going to for 10 years was 89
[17:05.480 --> 17:10.920]  dollars last night and you know i had the money to buy it but i'm gonna i'd give that to chariot
[17:10.920 --> 17:21.160]  or something for it it was obnoxious so i got a hamburger and i was sitting there talking to my
[17:21.160 --> 17:26.120]  friend who i was out with a couple friends and they said man we ought to get in the cattle business
[17:26.120 --> 17:32.200]  and i said no no no cattle business is going bankrupt right now at record levels my family's
[17:32.200 --> 17:38.040]  in the cattle business it's all actuaryed and gamed out by three major packing companies that use the
[17:38.040 --> 17:43.800]  fda in the last 20 years to shut down all the small packers so they have a monopoly at the buying
[17:43.800 --> 17:50.600]  now to buy the beef at record low prices and then sell it to you at record high prices
[17:50.600 --> 18:00.280]  and then you add inflation in as well and a 25 dollar stake in five six years is 89 dollars
[18:02.200 --> 18:13.640]  89 dollars that's the technocracy that's ai that's computers gaming everything
[18:13.640 --> 18:21.960]  that's a screw job and that's what it's doing to productivity this stuff could send us to the stars
[18:22.680 --> 18:27.800]  they've they've already had in the 50s plans and they've tested them in computer systems with
[18:27.800 --> 18:33.480]  space elevators we could already have space elevators do you know what you can do with a
[18:33.480 --> 18:40.680]  space elevator i mean they could build a city in space in a year they could have huge space spaces
[18:40.680 --> 18:48.120]  built in earth orbit and and be launching them but no no no no no no we're going to use technology
[18:48.120 --> 18:56.200]  to screw ranchers over what a wonderful elite we have what a what a fabulous group we have
[18:59.000 --> 19:06.360]  and then meanwhile i've got to have hundreds of reporters calling us every week wanting to do
[19:06.360 --> 19:11.320]  fake interviews by fake it's like i'm a prop like they talk to me they won't actually quote me
[19:13.000 --> 19:16.680]  or they'll take something out of common they just want to make their readers think they talk to us
[19:18.120 --> 19:21.640]  and then other reporters call me back and they go well i i did a fair interview and they won't
[19:21.640 --> 19:28.600]  let me publish it now exactly so i'll only do live tv or live radio i will not sit here and play

[19:35.560 --> 19:40.520]  they can write their imaginary piece we can compare them that's why the editors won't put

[28:00.040 --> 28:05.880]  more time talk about who this is for then we'll get to the new video and audio uh that the marines
[28:05.880 --> 28:12.120]  basically shot themselves and have released uh i mean this is not even hidden they're training
[28:12.120 --> 28:17.720]  for it but then saying they're not let's go to the clip from indiana we didn't have the the
[28:17.720 --> 28:23.800]  violence that we see today um the weaponry is totally different now than it wasn't in my the
[28:23.800 --> 28:27.320]  beginning of my career that's right um plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the
[28:27.320 --> 28:33.160]  military that have the ability and the knowledge to to build ied's and and to defeat law enforcement
[28:33.160 --> 28:40.840]  techniques okay can we can we queue up the spokane swat team commander uh washington saying it's for
[28:40.840 --> 28:46.760]  the constitutionals who have guns can we just keep doing this for everybody well while fox news
[28:46.760 --> 28:55.960]  sits there and says none of this is happening no none of it alex judy is driving a fire toward
[28:55.960 --> 29:03.240]  a team that's trying to get in i think the new states we can they can pull right up to a fire
[29:03.240 --> 29:08.040]  and still trying to address the threat without being afraid of getting shot so i'm thinking that
[29:08.040 --> 29:12.600]  is totally appropriate in iraq but we're what kind of a situation in the u.s would you see that
[29:12.600 --> 29:17.480]  happening i mean we've got a lot of constitution lists a lot of people that stockpile weapons a
[29:17.480 --> 29:23.640]  lot of a lot of i mean i mean we've got a lot of constitution lists a lot of people that stockpile
[29:23.640 --> 29:29.720]  weapons a lot of a lot of ammunition okay but again none of this is going on we're going under
[29:29.720 --> 29:34.760]  global treaties our borders are wide open we're living in a globalist dictatorship we're smart
[29:34.760 --> 29:38.600]  enough to try to politically take the country back we're gearing up to defend ourselves as the
[29:38.600 --> 29:45.000]  military trains to attack us we need to get the police to understand to protect themselves they
[29:45.000 --> 29:50.280]  need to say no to this narrative and not have the civil war here on the march we're gonna come back
[29:50.280 --> 29:55.000]  with the marine footage alex jones and the gcn radio network

[30:03.240 --> 30:09.160]  by french un soldiers french authorities were notified nine months ago by a un whistleblower
[30:09.160 --> 30:15.560]  under's compass of the rape and sodomy of at least 10 starving and homeless boys some as young as
[30:15.560 --> 30:21.960]  nine over a period of seven months in the central african republic un secretary general ban ke moon
[30:21.960 --> 30:27.400]  was far more upset about the leak of the information than he was about the crime calling it a serious
[30:27.400 --> 30:32.520]  breach of protocol and he took immediate action against the whistleblower not against the un
[30:32.520 --> 30:38.200]  sexual predators this is far from an isolated incidents of un troops preying on civilians
[30:38.200 --> 30:43.640]  that were sent to protect and having the un cover up their crimes identical atrocities committed by
[30:43.640 --> 30:48.680]  un soldiers in Haiti surfaced just three months ago and it's happened in virtually every country
[30:48.680 --> 30:55.320]  un peacekeepers occupy yet neither soldiers nor the un have ever been held accountable this is

[33:14.280 --> 33:20.440]  i want to just say something here
[33:27.880 --> 33:29.240]  it was march 20th
[33:33.240 --> 33:43.320]  five six weeks ago that joe begs came into the studio about 30 minutes before i got him on air and
[33:43.320 --> 33:48.200]  said we've confirmed these jade helm documents i've talked to my army buddies the last few days
[33:48.200 --> 33:53.160]  he's been working on the story hadn't told me about it yet this doesn't look any training drill we've
[33:53.160 --> 34:01.160]  seen before it's definitely for domestic operations and i said well i believe you i'm an expert on
[34:01.160 --> 34:05.240]  these domestic operations you're an expert on the army being a retired staff sergeant with
[34:05.240 --> 34:09.560]  turks and iraq and afghanistan you have these sources but let's not say that we're sure it
[34:09.560 --> 34:15.640]  looks like it's domestic let's just say it should be investigated he comes in we talk for 10 minutes
[34:15.640 --> 34:22.920]  drudge report dot com links to it in like an hour the army comes out and says this drill isn't even
[34:22.920 --> 34:27.640]  real it's probably fake documents yeah where do these documents even come from yeah so at first
[34:27.640 --> 34:31.640]  you know we're making stuff up yeah exactly first it just doesn't exist then they come out two days
[34:31.640 --> 34:36.840]  later we hate the military yeah and they have all these new lives and then i'm a supposed veteran
[34:36.840 --> 34:41.480]  that's right even though you've been in the army times bunch of articles yeah so so so all of this
[34:41.480 --> 34:46.440]  psi op goes on we're going whoa we hit on something bigger why are they freaking out we cover military
[34:46.440 --> 34:51.080]  drills all the time every week there's some new footage of the army the marines the national guard
[34:52.520 --> 34:58.760]  training to take on veterans gun owners there's new footage today i shot footage in 99 when clinton
[34:58.760 --> 35:06.040]  had this going on but it was much lower level much rarer yeah now it's ramped up 10 20 30 times i
[35:06.040 --> 35:10.040]  mean it's just it's just exponential and we're going to play that old footage and the new footage
[35:10.040 --> 35:13.880]  coming up here in a moment that we haven't gotten to yet again for radio listeners you can see the
[35:13.880 --> 35:20.200]  video at info wars dot com we have it posted red linked video marines practice of doing citizens
[35:20.200 --> 35:30.520]  inside internment camp again info wars dot com for war on for your mind now expanding on that
[35:30.520 --> 35:36.520]  situation joe has been working since yesterday and came in he said hey i know you want me on
[35:36.520 --> 35:42.360]  about my interchanges with eric bowling uh who came out a few months ago and said we need militarized
[35:42.360 --> 35:49.160]  police uh in a fox clip we played not satire fox calls for over militarized police that was in january
[35:50.680 --> 35:54.440]  he's saying he wants to meet me in a parking lot he's saying we're full of it i was just gonna
[35:54.440 --> 35:58.360]  and he goes i don't really want to get into that what you need to know is i'm working on a story
[35:58.360 --> 36:04.200]  i've gotten the guys military id i've gotten photos i'm getting authorization to post all this
[36:04.200 --> 36:08.760]  not as id but the other intel we're double checking to make sure none of it's classified because
[36:09.480 --> 36:14.040]  you mean even if it's unconstitutional what they're doing classified stuff they'll try to
[36:14.040 --> 36:17.720]  throw you in jail and sometimes we go ahead and put that out even though they could come after us
[36:17.720 --> 36:22.120]  because we morally know that it'll make them look so bad to come after us that we may just
[36:22.120 --> 36:31.160]  want to force that issue exactly but joe has major breaking news on jade helm now we've dug up
[36:31.160 --> 36:35.640]  that mastering the human domain goes to these major training operations that are joint forces
[36:36.200 --> 36:40.840]  to dominate america but the rest of the world to run human operations to learn how to take over
[36:40.840 --> 36:45.640]  local government and to quote stabilize it we have all these new documents coming out we covered
[36:45.640 --> 36:52.840]  yesterday that i'm gonna go over where they admit that this is about domestic operations and the
[36:52.840 --> 36:59.160]  commander of it has been the one for north com not just south com and sent com preparing for
[37:00.200 --> 37:04.920]  stabilization of the country they don't call it martial law so there's this massive exponential
[37:04.920 --> 37:11.560]  ramping up then we get them saying in earlier speeches this mead character that's running at
[37:11.560 --> 37:16.120]  all the civilian that the kernels of people take orders from publicly that you know they turn
[37:16.120 --> 37:20.600]  you know to ask how they should jump he says yeah we're going to be doing suspicious things on the
[37:20.600 --> 37:24.840]  street out of uniform then they come to bash drop a month later and say no we're not exactly never
[37:24.840 --> 37:29.560]  said that you're a conspiracy terrorist and it's right there in the slides that they denied and
[37:29.560 --> 37:33.400]  then had to come back and say where yes these are in fact the slides so we have this exactly and
[37:33.400 --> 37:39.240]  i'm gonna give you the four in a moment we have this whole background going on and the media 200
[37:39.240 --> 37:44.040]  the 500 articles a day saying we're liars i mean i've never seen anything like this
[37:44.040 --> 37:49.080]  on any subject i mean this is a major global firestorm it's all over the news worldwide
[37:49.080 --> 37:53.640]  it's causing a debate about militarization of police wire troops on the street in in england
[37:53.640 --> 37:58.840]  in europe in australia this is a global gear up for something world war three financial collapse
[37:59.800 --> 38:05.560]  nuclear terror i don't know but let me tell you folks it's like when germany was lining up troops
[38:05.560 --> 38:09.640]  in 1939 on the polish border and the polls kept saying they're getting ready to invade
[38:09.640 --> 38:14.440]  everybody's like oh no they're not don't be conspiracy theorist this is a major buildup
[38:14.440 --> 38:19.080]  and in war you look for truth movements you look for what they're training to fight because then you
[38:19.080 --> 38:23.320]  know what their mission is going to be it's us the american people they train for how they're
[38:23.320 --> 38:30.440]  going to fight now joe comes in here with stuff even bigger than marines practice of doing citizens
[38:30.440 --> 38:36.760]  inside internment camp we're gonna get to that in a moment joe has just bombshell info former
[38:36.760 --> 38:41.720]  staff sergeant u.s army he vetted this guy that's currently in that's so freaked out
[38:41.720 --> 38:46.120]  he's just considering walking off and believe me that's going to happen big time if they try this
[38:46.840 --> 38:51.880]  joe um there's a chance you know this guy's real that that that they can be trying to stir us up
[38:52.840 --> 38:57.880]  to hoax us so that then when they don't do it it makes us look bad but it doesn't matter
[38:57.880 --> 39:04.440]  we help stop it or they could be testing which they've done before to see if the special forces
[39:05.720 --> 39:13.960]  will do this we know they use live ammo in miami um years ago that was in the miami herald
[39:14.920 --> 39:18.200]  we know they used it in other cities so it could just be that
[39:19.320 --> 39:26.040]  but regardless this fellow has never seen anything like this tell folks the information you've
[39:26.040 --> 39:32.840]  been documenting so yesterday i'd say around six p.m our time central time i got a an email
[39:33.400 --> 39:37.640]  from an oathkeeper that i know saying that hey man this guy just came to me with some really
[39:37.640 --> 39:42.760]  scary information i'm going to take screenshots of this stuff send it to you so he sends me this
[39:42.760 --> 39:47.480]  you know email and i'm looking i'm like there's no way this can be true when i'm reading right now
[39:47.480 --> 39:51.400]  we've got to vet this guy can you get him in contact with me and tell him i need a copy of
[39:51.400 --> 39:56.760]  his military id so i can at least get that part going so i can make sure this guy is who he is
[39:57.400 --> 40:03.720]  he tells me what his m o s is it's a 15 seara that's a oh h 58 uh repair and that is a kaiwa
[40:03.720 --> 40:07.640]  helicopter that we use in iraq and afghanistan it's a little small bird we call them little birds
[40:07.640 --> 40:13.480]  it just holds two guys and he gets me the id to him like all right and i asked him a few questions
[40:13.480 --> 40:19.400]  seems legit and what he's telling me is that he is so freaked out because what they're doing
[40:19.400 --> 40:26.040]  he said they were loading live ammunition on these kaiwa helicopters and these are going
[40:26.040 --> 40:34.760]  to be specifically used for jade helm and they're already loading them yes and like i said i didn't
[40:34.760 --> 40:39.480]  go to the sky i didn't seek this person out this person reached out and i was put in contact with
[40:39.480 --> 40:43.640]  him and i'm currently vetting and trying to find out more information if i can get some pictures
[40:43.640 --> 40:49.240]  and video to go along with this so you did get a photo though i've got the photo of his id his
[40:49.240 --> 40:54.120]  military on the helicopter in a helicopter yeah so now for those that don't know that's another
[40:54.120 --> 40:57.800]  helicopter they're trying to get out of the military that special forces says is the best
[40:57.800 --> 41:02.360]  that's phenomenal they're also trying to kill the warhawk that is the best describe the battles
[41:02.360 --> 41:08.840]  you've been in with these weapon systems what they do closer support uh and then what this signifies
[41:08.840 --> 41:14.360]  yeah when i was a vsp7 it's a little border security uh point area on the border of uh pakistan
[41:14.360 --> 41:17.640]  and this is the main uh supply route for the taliban they would come in and out through there
[41:17.640 --> 41:23.320]  we would set up ambushes uh we were 20 plus miles away from any kind of convoy support
[41:23.320 --> 41:32.360]  whatsoever so we you know mainly had to rely on these kaiwa helicopters to fly in really quick
[41:32.360 --> 41:37.000]  they're small they're maneuverable they shoot 50 caliber ammunition hellfire missiles and then
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.280]  also the warthogs as well we had to wait on them to get in the racetrack where they spin around
[41:40.280 --> 41:45.080]  above you can hear them going you know overhead and then they drop in and do these gun runs no
[41:45.080 --> 41:50.360]  problems whatsoever phenomenal aircraft both the kaiwa and then for some reason our military wants
[41:50.360 --> 41:56.760]  to get rid of those things and put in these more expensive uh jets that are failing and not you
[41:56.760 --> 42:02.440]  know working as well they want to have a hundred million dollar jets that are total pieces of junk
[42:03.960 --> 42:07.720]  because they because the military industrial complex wants to make money yeah
[42:07.720 --> 42:16.840]  but expanding on that because all this is interconnected what it signifies
[42:18.040 --> 42:23.800]  to have special forces regardless involved in quote blending in with the public this is
[42:23.800 --> 42:29.480]  unprecedented as congressman gohmertz said and he was an army veteran himself an officer
[42:29.480 --> 42:35.240]  he's never seen a training drill or a preparation and congress goes over the stuff where they are
[42:35.240 --> 42:41.560]  pointing out the american people uh where they're saying the american people are the target or where
[42:41.560 --> 42:49.240]  they call states hostile yeah i mean i've been talking to a lot of different special forces
[42:49.240 --> 42:53.800]  soldiers over the past you know number of weeks and every one of them has a different aspect on
[42:53.800 --> 42:57.560]  what's going on a lot of them really understand what it is we're coming from you know when i
[42:57.560 --> 43:00.840]  tell them hey you have to look at the entire administration how they've been treating veterans
[43:00.840 --> 43:03.720]  what they've been doing how they've been lying they haven't been transparent like they said
[43:03.720 --> 43:08.360]  there would be spying all that's going on you have to understand how people have concerns
[43:08.360 --> 43:12.200]  and why they are not ready to jump into that mainstream narrative to just trust what the
[43:12.200 --> 43:16.760]  government's saying about jane elm and then the fact like we said before we came out with the slides
[43:16.760 --> 43:21.880]  i brought him to you on the show we showed those slides on the show and then two days later army
[43:21.880 --> 43:26.600]  time comes out they get a quote from some socom guy saying we don't know where these slides came from
[43:26.600 --> 43:31.880]  so that's another lie and then also jacari jackson and i were in bass drop for that meeting about
[43:31.880 --> 43:37.400]  jane elm who was it a few weeks ago and lieutenant colonel mark listoria shows up and one of the
[43:37.400 --> 43:43.640]  questions asked is how did these landowners find out about this how did you get in contact with
[43:43.640 --> 43:49.160]  these people and lieutenant colonel mark listoria goes well the landowners came to us they came to
[43:49.160 --> 43:53.800]  us and they're not getting any kind of any kind of compensation whatsoever so if we can
[43:53.800 --> 43:57.240]  can we go to the footage real quick of that sure we've got that queued up let's go ahead and go to
[43:57.240 --> 44:01.960]  it written questions from downstairs why was basher off county picked out of all the buildings in
[44:01.960 --> 44:09.000]  texas and how did it affect the routine changes of our citizens uh so how counties were picked in
[44:09.000 --> 44:16.280]  texas comes down to this the land was volunteered by the private landowner they came to us okay they
[44:16.280 --> 44:21.800]  are not getting any reimbursement for volunteering here they believe in training america's special
[44:21.800 --> 44:27.400]  operations forces not only at work but also indeed and that's how these counties were picked
[44:28.680 --> 44:34.440]  now they went on to say no one's being paid well in the manual it says they're paying
[44:34.440 --> 44:39.240]  in other speeches they said they were paying and it's in mainstream news today linked on drudge
[44:40.920 --> 44:46.280]  i'm going to click on that link right now and show tv viewers and i'll describe it for radio
[44:46.280 --> 44:52.360]  listeners that they are paying them and that's out of news west nine so so that's out of channel nine
[44:53.480 --> 45:00.600]  tv what's so frustrating is they just incessantly lie when the truth would serve them better
[45:00.600 --> 45:05.160]  because all they know is to deny everything we say well they're adding further speculation to
[45:05.160 --> 45:10.440]  this entire exercise they keep trying to demonize us and say that we're completely wrong yet they
[45:10.440 --> 45:17.320]  keep flip-flopping but you got called two days after we broke this in march from your old army
[45:17.320 --> 45:23.480]  buddy getting in your face the first email that you talked to him saying yeah i'm here at us here
[45:23.480 --> 45:30.120]  at south com or sent com and and we're here at special operations and yes this is a scyop now stay
[45:30.120 --> 45:34.680]  out of it yeah exactly what was his exact words he said he said hey man why are you guys messing
[45:34.680 --> 45:39.640]  with this leave it alone it's just a scyop and he was calling you what out of special forces uh
[45:39.640 --> 45:43.880]  uh he was out of Tampa at eglon yeah heard uh wherever eglon is i can't think right now
[45:43.880 --> 45:47.240]  at the top of my head but that's where they're uh the main socom that's where they run a lot of
[45:47.240 --> 45:51.080]  the operations from that's where the jane helm will be operated out of he was well where that'll
[45:51.080 --> 45:55.240]  be ran as well and he admitted it was a scyop yeah exactly i mean he said why are you even
[45:55.240 --> 45:58.920]  worried about he said that it's a scyop he's like just leave it alone let's do our that he was acting
[45:58.920 --> 46:03.480]  like we thought it was a real invasion no it's a scyop to condition that's what we said yes we
[46:03.480 --> 46:08.920]  know what it is yeah exactly i mean that's what people understand is the fact that seeing this
[46:08.920 --> 46:14.120]  out here gets it just puts off the wrong idea i mean even this guy he probably doesn't even know
[46:14.120 --> 46:19.000]  what info wars is he's just a regular homeowner saying hey i'm not going to accept any amount of
[46:19.000 --> 46:23.640]  money where i have to surrender my home to troops i support our troops but when they're trying to
[46:23.640 --> 46:28.280]  take over our civilians that ain't cool i mean when i was in bastrop with jacar there was a lot
[46:28.280 --> 46:33.080]  of people who had no idea what info wars was and that's what the mainstream narrative keeps being
[46:33.080 --> 46:38.920]  pushed is that by fox seeing in that info wars is the only people that look at this and see this is
[46:38.920 --> 46:45.560]  something wrong no we're concerned gomer's concerned paul's concerned cruises concerned
[46:46.200 --> 46:51.800]  abbot's concerned the president dissolved the borders last year yeah the president's
[46:51.800 --> 46:57.480]  shutting off the power plant now the president's threatening to shut down our trade without congress
[46:57.480 --> 47:02.440]  i mean it's it's out of control and dhs was called in the what is it off the california border today
[47:02.440 --> 47:09.080]  busting some allians illegally yeah and and you guys caught them at the border jacari and adan
[47:09.080 --> 47:14.760]  solazar shipping the illegals in yeah that illegally hitting jacaria yeah hitting jacari
[47:15.320 --> 47:19.400]  because they were all down there i just can't even it's just getting twilight zone man exactly i mean
[47:19.400 --> 47:22.680]  every other day it's something that's just mind blowing let me ask you this question why do you
[47:22.680 --> 47:25.960]  think we're going to the new marine video why do you think they're freaking out so bad
[47:27.320 --> 47:30.600]  well i mean this is what i always say if someone calls me something that calls me a name
[47:30.600 --> 47:35.880]  and it's not true i mean i'm not going to get mad but if someone says something that really strikes
[47:35.880 --> 47:40.440]  me that's when i kind of bite back and i think we've struck a nerve with these people i think they
[47:40.440 --> 47:46.280]  know that we're on to something like you said we talk about tons of military exercises every day
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.240]  but this one is the one that they're hitting as hard on that means there's something going on
[47:51.240 --> 47:55.560]  i don't think it's wrong for any american citizen out there to question the government
[47:55.560 --> 48:00.840]  and to find out what's going on and quite you know it adds further speculation every time we go
[48:00.840 --> 48:04.280]  and ask some questions they deny then they say oh it's true then they deny then there's and then
[48:04.280 --> 48:10.680]  there's jade helm like training in south carolina and in nevada yesterday at south carolina with the
[48:10.680 --> 48:15.880]  police doing no knock raids drills and then now we've got this footage let's start rolling some of
[48:15.880 --> 48:22.280]  this footage uh shot with us marines from the first battalion fifth marine regiment uh took place
[48:22.280 --> 48:28.120]  april 18th in yuma this just now got released by them uh and revolved around assault support
[48:28.120 --> 48:32.680]  tactics training the drill was part of standardized tactical training and certification of a unit
[48:32.680 --> 48:37.480]  instructor qualifications to support marine aviation training and readiness were in description
[48:37.480 --> 48:41.080]  accompanying the video and planning was the exercise was about subduing arresting and
[48:41.080 --> 48:52.360]  incarcerating irate citizens during a martial law scenario here it is these are americans
[49:00.680 --> 49:05.080]  again narrate this for radio listeners it's it's got tactical teams tackling folks
[49:05.080 --> 49:11.320]  uh it's got people practicing running away from them it's basically riot control subduing people
[49:11.320 --> 49:15.320]  just like the miami footage is them no knock raids dragging role players out in the middle of the
[49:15.320 --> 49:19.960]  night uh being very rough too i mean they're throwing them to the ground and just manhandling
[49:26.520 --> 49:30.360]  and then the response by the fox news reporter tweeting at us eric boling is
[49:30.360 --> 49:34.760]  this isn't training for civil unrest it's for fighting terrorists no it's not you said domestic
[49:34.760 --> 49:41.720]  terrorists yeah homegrown that's what it is homegrown which we're told the number one enemy
[49:42.520 --> 49:48.520]  is um the veterans southern of course these guys are military mainly and and some role
[49:48.520 --> 49:54.360]  players they've hired uh but then we're able to get the video and the audio which we played earlier
[49:54.360 --> 49:58.520]  they're they're saying i'm sovereign citizens i'm tea party and when we come back from break
[49:58.520 --> 50:03.000]  we have a couple minute clip from police state 2000 shot an operation urban warrior where i
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.200]  witnessed trips from five countries training to take on americans and we have video where they say
[50:08.200 --> 50:13.480]  where are you from i'm from san francisco where'd you get the gun the helmet uh and uh screaming
[50:13.480 --> 50:17.720]  i'm an american i have rights you can't put me in a camp i mean i have the audio and when the
[50:17.720 --> 50:25.720]  marines found out i had this they flipped out and a lot of bad stuff then started happening
[50:25.720 --> 50:29.480]  after that point and then later i learned that i was under surveillance the entire time by navy
[50:29.480 --> 50:35.320]  seals and and they knew full well all i was doing was out there covering but we're wrong for questioning
[50:35.320 --> 50:40.840]  all this stuff meanwhile there's chicago black sites detaining people that just had to settle
[50:40.840 --> 50:47.480]  multimillion dollar lawsuits yeah but we're crazy to question all this and then at every major event
[50:47.480 --> 50:51.560]  g20 you name it they snatch and grab people off the street in front of everyone black vans pull up
[50:51.560 --> 50:56.520]  and they just disappear people but but everything's okay the president just dissolved the border

[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:58.840]  a lot of previous kernels are coming at me like why are you talking about this leave it alone stop
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:03.560]  stop you know you know we never did that you used to be a good soldier why are you talking about this
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:08.440]  you know and i'm like i think i'm still being a good soldier by questioning what's going on
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.320]  you know i maybe i wasn't able to question as much as then which is why i wasn't as highly liked
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:19.800]  because i never i wasn't a robot but i was born to question stuff i will continue to do that well
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:25.400]  the country's being dismantled in front of us yeah i mean this is a thing though we've talked about
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.200]  we've talked about so many military exercises in the year that i've been here but not once do you
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:36.040]  get any kind of feedback hostile feedback from soldiers you know now you're getting all these
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.800]  people they're just jumping up and they seem like they just say the same thing all the time
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:44.120]  leave it alone why are you talking about it no just be a good soldier just leave it alone
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:51.240]  why why don't you say that when i talk about the dirty bomb exercise in california
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.720]  it was supposed to be a dirty bomb exercise but in fact what it was was you know rounding up a
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.560]  constitutionalist the sovereign citizens well that's the truth they've been given a traitorous
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:06.920]  mission they're scared they don't want to discuss it now the troops themselves we've talked to her
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:11.960]  upset and agree with us and like to go to see info but it's the officers that want to just go play
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.520]  golf they want to just get paid they want to get their little under the counter bonuses that everybody
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:23.720]  knows they get and listen guys we're gonna lose the whole country this hidden 20 years ago this is
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:31.400]  all coming to a head you better choose the right side well don't sign up with hitler okay it's not
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:36.680]  going to go well sorry go ahead a lot of the special forces guys that have reached out to me were
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:42.120]  i think more confused i think that they that we at info wars hate special operations guys and i had
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.920]  to talk to him like no it's not the operator that we have a problem with that's a total sigh
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.080]  off they don't even yeah but i mean it's it's the people at the top it's the ones who are making those
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.600]  plans it's the people to pentagon we don't really we don't have a problem with the everyday soldier
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:02.200]  i've had general stubblebib who was the head of special forces on 10 years ago five years ago
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:06.760]  three years ago saying this is all coming yeah i mean they were trying to get him involved in
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:11.160]  stuff like this 20 years ago they've been the globalists have been wanting to take over forever
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.320]  they're always trying we're here pointing out this mission takes us there and this is happening
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.200]  right when they're trying to go to driverless cars too they want to control our movement
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.760]  and they're doing these to put people into camps it looks like they're doing all these
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:27.240]  exercises they're testing all the control grids but but but let's be clear the public's awake folks
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:32.280]  are upset the majority of the troops we talk to agree with us but there is a minority of regular
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:36.920]  troops and then you've got the officers that are really engaging in a sigh off yeah and then you've
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:44.200]  got people like eric bowling again has this huge audience on fox and he's mocking us saying you
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.480]  know why are we talking about this this is all a conspiracy you know or not everything's a conspiracy
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.840]  leave it alone you guys are uh what a bunch of gullible nutbags or something like that he said
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:59.560]  so i i got on twitter this morning and i said hey i challenge you to come out here i was like

[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:06.600]  derailment that currently has six dead and over 200 injured was it a failed infrastructure a result
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:11.720]  of washington kleptocrats who make themselves rich while the country goes off the rails or was it a
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:17.160]  deliberate act of sabotage just as many people will wonder what happened when the us crashes
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:23.400]  the aftermath will be just as bad as this train crash except there won't be any outside help coming
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:27.880]  this horrific train crash is a metaphor for the trends that are about to derail and crash our
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:34.600]  economy and nation we just saw a train robbery by drug enforcement agency thugs taking 16 000

[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:40.760]  now monsanto it has been derated from a good investment by major investment firms to a risky
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:47.320]  bad investment uh their profits are in trouble mcdonald's is in trouble they're both an allied
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:56.600]  operation this is franken food and they get up there and they lie and they say oh it's just
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:02.600]  like george washington carver crossing two tomatoes no because those tomatoes are closely
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:08.760]  enough related that they're able to breed together but just like if you get a donkey and a horse
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:17.160]  very similar to have sex they can procreate but they have a sterile offspring it's called a mule
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:23.320]  i'm not a geneticist but i know these basic things it's like a liger a tiger and a lion
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:29.080]  you can breed them the offspring a liger is sterile what happens when you breed two tomatoes
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:33.640]  together they're further enough apart that they're able to get together and share their
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:41.000]  different traits but they don't produce seeds or the seeds don't produce more fruit tomatoes
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:48.120]  is a fruit for those that know they've gone beyond that and created gmo where you'll have
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:55.000]  five 10 15 20 30 traits in it where it lasts longer it doesn't die bugs can't eat it if they
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.840]  do eat it they die because there's a natural pesticide produced then they argue well it's
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:07.080]  a natural pesticide yeah but you boosted a thousand times or more yeah the plant produces a pesticide
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:13.560]  or invites a fungus to grow on it that's poisonous but it's not at that level it's not inside the
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:21.080]  plant you wash it off didn't use to kill the honey bees and that's all 20 30 year old technology
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:27.000]  that's wreaking havoc right now but as all this comes out the system is panicking at the bottom

[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:42.600]  in the 70s they got it approved in 1981 now admitted to absolutely give you cancer you name it
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:49.800]  kill monkeys in lab tests i mean this isn't a joke monsanto is the most devilish company i could
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:57.880]  think of i mean they really are wicked uh and now the world is waking up every couple days a new
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:04.440]  country's banning the importation uh every new studies have come out linking it to cancer and
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:10.440]  humans the un has come out uh i mean humanity is awakening and by the way it wasn't the of
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:17.880]  the it didn't come from the top it was the un scientist so more and more just like fda scientist
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:23.080]  in 2000 and again a few years ago almost unanimously it was like 99 percent of them sent letters to
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:28.760]  their bosses saying hydrofluorosalic acid is causing bone cancer brain damage IQ reduction
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:33.400]  here's our studies here's our harvard studies it needs to be pulled out of the water it doesn't
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:39.080]  help the teeth you need a little bit of calcium fluoride this is hydrofluorosalic acid if you're
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:44.520]  going to put it in there you need to put a little bit of calcium fluoride this is deadly poison
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:50.040]  they just reduced it by half in the water and have now banned it in all pesticides already banned
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:56.120]  worldwide we're having some devastating victories right now uh and this is very exciting and the man
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:01.480]  spearheading so much this we sell his books in his films jeffrey smith is international best-selling
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.160]  author award-winning filmmaker executive director of the institute for responsible technology and
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:10.200]  a leading spokesman on the health dangers of gmo's the most recognized consumer advocate
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:15.800]  promoting healthier non gmo choices and he's the author of the documentary and the book
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:19.720]  genic roulette he's the executive director of the institute for responsible technology
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:25.800]  non gmo shopping guide dot com responsible technology dot com seizure deception dot com
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:31.080]  invite all those books and films at info wars store dot com and support both of our operations
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:36.360]  jeffrey am i overstating and it'd mean we're overall winning the war we've been losing it
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:40.600]  horribly america's the dumping ground for everything we know that the test tube but
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:46.840]  if we were behind 50 points in a football game have we just come back 37 points and we've got a
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:52.520]  quarter left and and are we just lobbing hail mary's and catching every one i mean it doesn't
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:58.280]  mean we won but are we not racing back to a global awakening i mean are we on the cusp
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:03.880]  of a new renaissance because because it was dark having you on 14 15 16 years ago that
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:09.240]  and persie smizer on 16 years ago when he first launches operation now it seems like you know
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:14.040]  courts are coming out admitting monsanto planted their stuff on their crops monsanto's having things
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:20.520]  reversed i want about how they're striking back part two of this interview but but but am i accurate
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:26.680]  with you at the center of this who testifies to you know major political bodies worldwide
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:33.560]  where are we right now in the global fight to not have poisoned food well we're definitely
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:41.720]  winning alex and the chief victory is among consumers as you know in 1999 consumer concern on
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:47.560]  gmo's caused a tipping point of consumer rejection and it was this very specific moment in time
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:52.680]  when the food companies realized that using gmo's was going to cost them money that moment in time
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:59.960]  was equal 27th when unilever said no more gmo's in its european brands the next day nestle's said no
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:06.040]  more gmo's in its european brands the nestle next week or two everyone else followed that tipping
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:12.440]  point of consumer rejection occurred in the natural products industry in united states in 2013
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:18.120]  when whole foods announced that when a product becomes third party verified as non-gmo it increases
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:24.520]  sales by 15 to 30 percent immediately thousands of products were enrolled in verification there's
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:31.080]  over 30 000 non-gmo verified products in united states that tipped the natural products industry
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:36.440]  now we see products like cheerios and grape nuts and ben and jerry's and target home brands and
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:42.360]  soon hershey's all declaring non-gmo on their package as soon as they start increasing in
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:47.880]  market share in the united states the rest of the food industry will realize i can't wait till my
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:54.200]  chief competitor goes non-gmo before me or i'll start losing customers so we're looking for a
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:17:00.440]  tipping point of consumer rejection in the united states this year or at the very latest next year
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:05.320]  and we think there'll be a clean out of gmo's and direct ingredients over the next three years
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:11.000]  and for animal products over the next five and monsanto is caving in all over the world and pulling
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.840]  its push in europe for gmo's if i mean i liken this to hitler's collapse on the eastern front
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:21.880]  launching a counter offensive on the western front at the battle of the bulge i think that's
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:27.080]  the point we're at if we beat them at the battle of the bulge in the next couple years i believe
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:33.880]  we're seeing a collapsed level event of these operators not only that but we just got incredible
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:39.400]  ammunition from the world health organization last month that declared monsanto's roundup and
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:47.080]  its active ingredient glyphosate as a probable carcinogen since then 30 000 argentine medical
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:52.920]  doctors have petitioned their government to ban it the federal prosecutor in brazil has said that
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:57.480]  their government should ban it the president of columbia said they're no longer going to use it
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:03.560]  to spray on the cocoa fields to eradicate that trade it was banned in richmond in california
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:09.960]  and it continues to be a subject pardon bermuda just banned it bermuda so what's happening now
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:15.080]  is all over the world they're realizing that monsanto actually has known about these health
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:20.520]  dangers for decades in fact an epa document became available showing that there was concerns about
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:27.000]  cancer back in the late 1980s similarly there was evidence showing birth defects back in the 1980s
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.840]  they've been covered up by monsanto and regulators and it turns out in argentina the peasants that
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:40.680]  are sprayed with this roundup or glyphosate have much higher levels of birth defects 400 increase
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:48.200]  region-wide 70 times in one hospital and an increase in cancer of 300 in one area and higher in other
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:54.120]  regions we also saw in china when they started introducing genetically engineered roundup ready
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:19:00.680]  soybeans for their soybean oil it was reported that cancer and heart disease and other problems
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:06.520]  skyrocketed i was there giving a presentation in beijing last year a general who was in the
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:11.960]  audience had earlier reported that he warned the government and warned the people that this new
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:17.880]  genetically modified roundup ready soybean oil was linked to all of these increased in diseases
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:24.600]  and the army of china thereafter refused to serve its own soldiers gmo's even though the
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:29.800]  government still allows the rest of the population to eat it in fact that came out in the news that
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:35.240]  the chinese elite are obsessed with non-gmo and were found to have secret government funded gardens
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:43.640]  it turns out that bush the past bush administration absolutely insisted that their kitchen be organic
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:50.040]  and evidently obama has followed through so it turns out that those that know the situation
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:54.520]  don't want to risk themselves in fact a former monsanto scientist told me that three of his
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:58.200]  colleagues were doing the safety stay there stay there this is amazing i want to hear it when we
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:02.680]  come back there are hundreds of silver products on the market today but there's nothing like the

[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:31.240]  they want to force you into big box stores it's why they want to make you only shop with the big
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:36.680]  megacorporations because they have a plan for a global monopoly monsanto and other big gmo companies
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:43.480]  have admitted they want to make everything gmo from trees to grass and patented now they're
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:48.200]  coming out and saying you know that words are going to be copyright where you supposedly can't use
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:56.200]  them in language uh they're now saying you can't work on your own car in fact this morning i was
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:03.800]  talking to a lady and she was telling me about her currig coffee maker and how she her one that she
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:08.360]  had for two years broke so she bought a new one and i said yeah i have one of those but i said
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:13.320]  mine's old she said well you put the new little canister in there it's not one of their coffees
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:18.840]  it won't work it's got a RFID chip in it she she was a listener and she was telling me how she
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:25.080]  heard about that years ago and oh yeah and so you have to go in and basically put tape over it or
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:30.360]  cut the chip off so that her other in this case she said organic coffee we were having an organic
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:37.080]  discussion at the gym would go in there so see that's the type of monopoly they're trying to
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:41.800]  create and i'm kind of diverting off into another subject but it all connects we were talking about
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:47.000]  Volkswagen you buy a Volkswagen two years later your battery doesn't work you you go get a third
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.600]  party battery same battery works great they remotely from the factory turn it off you have to go in
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:58.840]  and pay a hundred fifty dollar service charge to have them certify it as theirs now that's where
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:03.240]  all this is going and with this genetically engineered food that's where it's going now this
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:08.120]  is a short segment mr. Smith long segment coming up you were going into victories right now i'm glad
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:13.000]  to hear from you the expert that i'm not overestimating how exciting this is let me shift gears and
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  we'll go back into good news and for the rest of the fight is the next segment in this short
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:23.400]  segment as we talked to jeffrey smith responsible technology dot com probably the leading spokesperson
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.600]  fighting this stuff on the gmo there's more cola and others but they cover you know the whole
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:34.840]  spectrum let me ask you this question how is the empire going to strike back what's what's going to
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:41.160]  be their battle the bulge counter offensive what are they doing well they're spending millions of
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:48.120]  dollars now promoting the quote benefits of gmo's through media and also trying to discredit those
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:54.200]  of us like me and vodna sheev and others claiming that we are anti science and incredible so they're
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:58.840]  actually cornered against the wall and in discussions with my colleagues around the world
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:04.520]  it's clear that they're doing a full court press i'm here in ecuador where the country actually has
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:11.000]  a constitutional amendment saying that no gmo's are allowed if you look at wiki leaks the united
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.360]  state's government had a plan to undermine the constitution here and get them to overturn it
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:22.120]  so they actually paid for bringing reporters from ecuador to the united states so that monsanto
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:28.600]  can train them how to report on gmo's and sure enough they started giving monsanto's false talking
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:33.720]  points in the press here in ecuador then they surrounded the president who does have the ability
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:39.880]  to overturn the constitutional prohibition and he came out saying that gmo's could increase yields by
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:45.720]  400 percent and he's now against the constitutional provision it turns out gmo's actually do not
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:51.080]  increase yields at all in fact many times decrease yields but agro ecology which was recommended by
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:55.720]  the world's experts that increases yields which he's ignoring so they're focusing on the four
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:02.760]  targeted areas politicians media the general public and farmers and trying to use as much
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:07.880]  evidence as they can which is false to try and convince them that this is absolutely necessary
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:12.760]  to feed the world to save economies to prevent the use of agricultural chemicals all of which
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:18.520]  has been sure but the effects of it are so deadly we're 30 years into this nightmare that no amount
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:25.000]  of bs is ever going to paper over the prima facia reality well i'll talk about it in the next segment
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.360]  about the specific diseases that we now know are probably linked to gmo's i'll say probably but i'm
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:35.480]  very confident as thousands of physicians in the united states who are prescribing non gmo diets
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:40.040]  they are very confident that these particular diseases are linked and why it's so important
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:46.760]  now not to get not to just buy non gmo but to buy organic because monsanto's glyphosate or roundup
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:52.520]  is sprayed on wheat barley lentils sweet potatoes potatoes sugarcane over a hundred different crops
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:57.960]  are now authorized to have high levels of glyphosate residue and it's sprayed just before harvest
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:02.920]  as a ripening agent briefly describe in one minute what why glyphosate i mean they admit it
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:08.040]  grows breast cancer why is it so deadly well i can do it in one minute but we should spend a little
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:12.280]  more time it's it's noted it's definitely a probable cause of the gender card the world health
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:16.600]  organization it's linked to birth defects it's an antibiotic that kills the beneficial gut
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:21.640]  bacteria it causes an overgrowth of negative gut bacteria it blocks the gut bacteria's ability
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:26.120]  to produce tryptophan which is a precursor to serotonin and melatonin so it can affect mood
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:33.320]  behavior sleep uh blood sugar chemistry as well as um obesity it also is linked to a endocrine
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:38.280]  disruptor it also blocks the liver's ability to detoxify stay there only going to recap all
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:42.840]  that when we come back and i'm sure it's all an accident that these eugenicists that gave us all
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:48.280]  this other bad stuff at monsanto came up with this i'm sure it's all an accident we'll be right back
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:59.000]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:05.240]  presidential hopeful senator marco rubio says he's all for the nsa program and even insists
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:10.520]  it hasn't been abused clearly he forgot edward snowden already revealed the fact that agents
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:17.400]  were passing around nude photos of americans like they were trading cards sorry rubio the nsa's
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:23.480]  massive and unconstitutional surveillance program has never been about stopping terrorism it has
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:29.000]  persistently focused on crushing dissent while ignoring repeated warnings from russia about
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.440]  tamerlan sarnayev's ties to terrorism fusion centers were focused on the largely peaceful
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:41.720]  occupy movement sidewalk chalk protests and even vegan potlucks now with the entire internet and
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:47.320]  thousands of databases to extract information from the state can gain a full spectrum picture

[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:20.520]  and what is the state we're facing well 550 years ago the state was corrupt religious
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:27.400]  institutions and corrupt royalty and we had a renaissance and then it itself got taken over
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:32.840]  by the robber barons the last 120 years we now face corporate global governance that masquerades
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:39.400]  is liberal masquerades is conservative it's really just oligarchal totalitarianism carried
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:47.000]  out by corporate institutions that are anti-free market crony capitalist and they use socialism
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  to control the general masses below them with a small sliver of gdp so it's a bifurcated upper
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:02.040]  and lower house system uh and and and that is not my opinion that is the real political system
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:08.440]  of the globalist i first read about it in nondare called a conspiracy published in 1972
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:14.280]  two years before i was born and then i read nondare uh after i read nondare called a conspiracy by
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:20.760]  gary allen whose son runs and founded politico today uh the late great gary allen i went and i read
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:26.920]  the books they recommended that they were quoting from tragedy and hope uh the angle american
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:34.920]  establishment both by carol quickly um other books like the um technotronic era by zebignan
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:40.920]  brzezinski and others and you read those and they explain everything from their perspective
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.120]  so you need to understand uh this is about fighting a global monopoly we're going back to our guest
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:51.400]  but i'm going to give the floor uh right through this long segment so you can really break down
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:55.960]  what we know gliver state's doing and he's a major target so he puts provisos in there
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:03.960]  that's a whole other story here because monsanto went after farmers researchers scientists
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:08.840]  persecuted people i've had top genetic engineers on the show that were making millions a year
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:13.960]  who even own percentages i've had a bunch of them on uh in new potatoes that were coming out
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:17.960]  in new corn and they would say hey this is sterilizing the rats so this is killing the guinea pigs
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:26.440]  and they'd say shut up or you're fired so there's been a war a long history of persecution that i hope
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:31.080]  our guests can talk about maybe the next segment before he leaves us and before persie smizer
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:37.160]  a true hero joins us because they've gone through hell to bring us to where we're now here kind of
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:42.120]  like they i think manipulated the vote in california and other states to not let gmo labeling happen
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:48.360]  but the fight educated everybody so even blew up bigger see george washington lost
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:53.960]  almost all the first battles for the first five years of the war then began to win the
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:37:01.880]  battles the last year and a half but every time they lost a battle they still escape with enough
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:08.600]  of a force to reconstitute to wear out the juggernaut so it's perseverance ladies and gentlemen
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:13.880]  that wins that's why if i get destroyed i get set up i get you know brought down
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:17.880]  believe me i get plenty of threats we're in the zeitgeist we're not touching it we're in it
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:26.520]  that matter because i know the war will be won and it's not some heroic reason i'm doing that
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:32.280]  it's self-preservation for the species i really do i'm an individual but when you become a real
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:37.560]  individual you then understand the collective they try to bring a collective that you submit to
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:41.880]  and give up your individualism no we as individuals gravitate to what what's the core of the human
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:48.600]  spirit the human drive and then we collectively radiate those ideas and actions and then build
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:57.000]  a harmonistic collective but the collective comes out of the individual not out of the collective
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.280]  and that's my own philosophy and my own ideas but i know it's true and so i am the planet i am the
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:09.320]  people you are the people we are we are the species and and we have to decide that we care about
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:14.440]  everybody but that doesn't mean then being told oh do this to show your moral you've got to go do
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:20.440]  research to really follow the right path to really help people you can't just give away your free will
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:26.840]  to the false corporate collective that it tells you is moral i'm ranting now briefly we're running
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:33.320]  two specials right now powerful concentrated herbs we have infowarslife.com we're going to launch this
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:38.040]  through next week 20 percent off super male vitality 20 percent off super female vitality
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.080]  these are just a whole bunch of concentrated herbs of the highest quality you've heard the
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:48.600]  rave reviews known to just really supercharge the body the libido the energy you name it
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:55.320]  it's what i've been taking prostagard is 10 different saw palm meadow organic and and other
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:39:00.520]  things known to really help the prostate and and and other functions that are connected to that
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:05.080]  everybody knows this i haven't showed you in a male clinic articles yesterday this is one of the
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:09.720]  most documented things and it's got concentrated strong organic saw palm meadow that's got a
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:17.480]  bunch of other things that are absolutely known absolutely known to turbocharge that same same
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:25.320]  activity vitamin d zinc selenium copper manganese chromium and a bunch of other ingredients saw
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:33.080]  palm meadow lycopene the healthy plant sterols this is the super formula over 40 bucks from medical
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:37.240]  doctor i was getting something similar from was that you know in in his practice you said you're
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:42.280]  40 you know get on this about two years ago so i said why not develop our own supercharged version
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:49.000]  it's out info wars life dot com info wars store dot com or eight eight eight two five three three
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.720]  one three nine and thank you for your prayers and support and i was saying it wrong earlier
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:40:00.520]  it's uh responsible technology dot org uh not not com responsible technology dot org
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:06.280]  non gmo shopping guide dot com and seize of deception dot com jeffrey smith at the tip of
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:12.840]  the spear so so so get into what it's doing to us where the rest of the fight's going and and then
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:19.400]  people need to realize those that have gone through hell uh to stand up and tell the truth
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:24.760]  and thank god it's not in vain because we can save millions of lives if we uh go ahead and
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:29.720]  finally uh discredit this uh deadly chemical go ahead to jeffrey smith great thank you i'll talk
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:35.240]  about roundup i also want to talk about the new apple and potato before we break with a new technology
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:41.000]  that may be far worse than anything we've seen now roundup or glyphosate its active ingredient was
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:47.880]  originally patented as a descaler to clean industrial boilers and pipes that's because it
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:55.720]  chelates or grabs minerals all sorts of minerals all the metallic minerals zinc uh chromium magnesium
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:03.320]  manganese calcium all of those now when they discarded the uh glyphosate on the ground it killed
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:10.760]  the plants and so monsanto patented it as an herbicide now it turns out that it can deplete
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:17.480]  the minerals in the crops and the animals in the united states eat mostly roundup ready crops
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:23.400]  so the animals in the united states the livestock have a universal deficiency of certain minerals
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:29.560]  like manganese according to the veterinarians that send in organs for evaluation so we're eating
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:34.840]  weak and sick mineral deficient plants weak and sick mineral deficient animals and residues of
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:40.200]  roundup that further chelate or bind with our minerals making them unavailable mineral depletion
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:46.520]  is linked to a whole host of diseases now because it blocks certain minerals it's also an antibiotic
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:52.840]  but it's selective it kills the beneficial gut bacteria the lactobacillus the bifidus the stuff
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:58.360]  we pay for but not the negative stuff like botulism and salmonella and ecoli which can
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:03.480]  cause an overgrowth of the negative gut bacteria this alone can create holes on the intestinal
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:09.960]  walls called permeable gut or leaky gut and that's linked to cancer parkinson's alzheimer's autism
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:17.160]  food allergies inflammation and autoimmune disease to name a few now some of our gut bacteria is used
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:23.240]  to produce what's called aromatic amino acids including tryptophan which is necessary for the
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:29.400]  production of serotonin serotonin is a good thing if we don't have enough serotonin we may not be
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:35.320]  happy we may be depressed sad etc it also regulates our blood sugar it also regulates our ability to
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:42.040]  say i'm full i can stop eating so if we have a deficiency of serotonin because roundup is blocking
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:47.320]  the production of tryptophan that could cause a whole effect in terms of mood behavior and health
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:53.800]  it also affects the melatonin which relates to sleep in addition it blocks another pathway in our
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:59.400]  liver that helps detox so that means all of the other poisons that we're exposed to may become
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:05.160]  amplified because the ability to detox through the liver is hampered it also is an endocrine
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:11.960]  disruption at very very tiny levels at parts per trillion at parts of the amount of glyphosate that's
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:18.360]  currently in our water supply now it can change the balance of estrogen and testosterone rats that
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:24.920]  were fed roundup in the water supply which was less than the amount allowed in the united states
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:31.000]  the females had more testosterone and lower estrogen the males had more estrogen and lower
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.800]  testosterone and it could also affect the aroma taste and what do we see here we see
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:42.280]  and it's just a fact they admit this butch more butch women bigger women and i'm not attacking
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:46.920]  what's been done to them with the chemicals it's just a fact and more effeminate men lower sperm
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:53.080]  counts lower testosterone uh metrosexual activity and and again the media always spends this like
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:57.240]  i'm bashing people for their sexual preference we don't even get into that folks it's a fact
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:02.600]  that in mammals but also in the runoff from fish you name it that this stuff's happening you look
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:09.400]  at prozac runoff and it's causing the fish to commit suicide literally swimming up to birds not
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:15.640]  afraid it's causing risky behavior i mean we are just bathed in this garbage i know i'm digressing
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:21.720]  off into other chemicals but we know this is happening in addition to causing endocrine
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:27.640]  disruption it also can affect the ability of the sperm to to move because manganese which is
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:34.600]  chelated by glyphosate is needed for sperm mobility in fact when they fed genetically modified soy
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:39.240]  to female rats starting two weeks before they got pregnant more than half of their babies
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:44.600]  died within three weeks compared to 10 percent of controls for hamsters that were fed roundup ready
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:49.960]  soy which is sprayed with roundup by the third generation most were sterile some had hair growing
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:54.920]  in their mouths and they died at four or five times the rate now birth defects are also linked
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:45:01.240]  to glyphosate big time both in animals and in the human population in places like argentina
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:07.800]  where they spray a lot of that roundup also damages the mitochondria which means that we may get
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:13.800]  tired and there's a lot of diseases that can link to that it also is as we say a promoter of tumors
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:19.880]  and you saw on the screen just now some very very large tumors of rats this was a study done by
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:27.960]  serolini and others in europe where they fed roundup ready corn to rats for two years now there were
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:33.000]  the rats ended up dying at higher rates and earlier they had damage to their liver kidneys
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  and pituitary and they also had multiple massive tumors now they didn't know whether it was the
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:45.720]  roundup or the gmo that caused the problem so as part of the study they fed roundup ready corn that
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:51.160]  had not been sprayed with roundup and that group had multiple massive tumors early death and organ
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:57.400]  damage and to another group they fed the roundup without the corn and that group also had multiple
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:02.760]  massive tumors early death and organ damage so the roundup was worse than the gmo well actually
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:08.440]  no both it would be they both contain the same outcome early death organ damage and multiple
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:16.600]  massive tumors it's hard to know but i we've tracked in the epidemiological trends what is
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:21.240]  related to the increase of gmo's or what's related to the increase of roundup the list of
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:27.320]  diseases is astonishing deaths from stroke deaths from senile dementia deaths from obesity
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:31.640]  deaths from high blood pressure deaths from and by the way we see all that going up i mean every
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:37.880]  week i hear about some 25 year old woman or 30 year old guy who just dies of a stroke it's just
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:43.880]  crazy and i talk to thousands of people who say when they get off of gmo's they get better from a lot
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:48.840]  of these same diseases and disorders in fact thousands of doctors are prescribing to people
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:53.800]  to stop eating gmo's i speak at those medical conferences and they tell me people are getting
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:58.760]  from these getting better from these same diseases and disorders the same ones that afflict the lab
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:04.040]  animals that are fed gmo's and the same ones that the farmers and veterinarians tell us their
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:09.640]  livestock gets better from when they start feeding them non-gmo corn and soy and so
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:14.600]  it turns out there's a correlation between the what's afflicting the lab animals what people
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:19.240]  are reporting getting better from the livestock getting better from pets are getting better from
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:24.520]  and those things that are on the rise in the u.s population now there was a mysterious kidney
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:30.120]  disease killing up to 25 percent of the labor force in central america among farmers working in
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:36.680]  sugarcane plantations they spray the sugarcane with glyphosate just before ripening i've seen the
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:41.320]  documentaries where you chose the sad little family and half of them are dying and then you
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:46.360]  go to the next village and the same deal it's just incredible now there was a study that showed that
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:52.600]  round up we talked about how it chelates it binds with certain minerals it binds with arsenic
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:58.680]  and can smuggle that arsenic into the body where it gets into the kidneys then the situation the
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:04.280]  kidneys allows it to un-un-chelate so now you have two toxins in the kidneys you have glyphosate and
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:09.880]  you have arsenic and this is the theory of this mysterious kidney disease that's afflicting
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:15.720]  farm workers both in central america and in Sri Lanka they believe it's a combination of of glyphosate
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:21.560]  and arsenic sure what about the massive sicknesses in india associated with it oh yeah so there's all
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:26.360]  these people who touch the cotton plants either while they're harvesting or while they're cleaning
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:32.120]  it and get rashes all over their bodies they allow animals to graze on the cotton plants after harvest
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:37.320]  and thousands have died i visited one village where their buffalo 13 of them all of them died
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:42.920]  after eating the corn the cotton plants after a single day these same buffalo had survived eight
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:48.760]  years eating natural cotton plants after harvest so that's a bio accumulation yeah well bio
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:53.240]  accumulation is interesting because monsanto said that glyphosate is water soluble it can
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:58.840]  just go out of the body but it turns out the glyphosate amount in the breast milk in humans
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:03.720]  is so high it demonstrates that it does bio accumulate which means it's probably at higher
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:09.160]  levels in our milk and probably higher levels of our meat so it's also found in rain samples and
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:14.680]  air samples and 60 to 100 percent in the midwest where it's sprayed a lot it's found in our water
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:20.520]  samples and it's found in our urine in fact the amount has increased so much because the herbicide
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:25.160]  is now being resisted by weeds there was an increase in herbicides because of gmo sure it's
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.640]  a nightmare 16 years by 520 and then as you said it kills the soil then won't even work after a
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:33.480]  while that's why the farmers then commit suicide in india we're going to break i want to come back
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:37.320]  and then let you hit other key areas for this segment one other and then hersey smizer joins
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:42.280]  us at five after but let me ask you this in the next minute and a half if they knew about this
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:46.040]  in the eighties and i know about those studies and their own internal concerns why would they
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:51.960]  approve this and roll it out i mean are these people directly like in like hellraiser like
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:58.120]  some type of demons i mean what's their problem well we know from the fda memos made public from
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:03.880]  a lawsuit that gmo's in general were described by fda scientists as dangerous they said allergens
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:08.760]  toxins new diseases and nutritional problems may be created and we need to test them carefully
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:13.240]  but the white house had told the fda to promote biotechnology because it was going to increase
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:19.000]  us exports and domination of world food trade so the fda brought in michael taylor monsanto's
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.320]  former attorney later its vice president and then later back at the fda is the us food
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:28.760]  safeties are to be in charge of the f of the gmo policy his policy ignored the scientists
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:33.240]  warnings claim that gmo's have no difference therefore no safety studies were needed and
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:37.480]  now the world is rejecting our food and it's doing the opposite thing exactly so it's a
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:42.120]  political influence over the scientific process almost every time and there's a new one a new
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:45.640]  example of like this i like to bring up after the break we'll do that and then i want to hear
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:50.600]  about some of the victims of monsanto folks need to remember the true veterans of this war
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:56.920]  uh by the way folks this is so sick i i don't know what to say at this point it's just thank god
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:02.600]  people are waking up communist china freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:07.400]  while our u.s politicians argue from banning americans from owning body armor does that sound

[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:43.240]  look at these headlines e u passes controversial gmo food law e u agrees to opt out deal for gmo
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:51.000]  imports on santo secretly gave money to farmer caught contaminating organic farms with gmo's record
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.600]  us farmers switching to non-gmo crops in 2015 hundreds of farmers block roads and protests
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:03.800]  among santo gmo crops thousands of polish farmers and gmo's land rights protests booming organics
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:09.800]  us farmers forced to import organic crops to meet non-gmo demand that's what's in this tpp coming up
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:16.760]  is more forced deals to accept all this but then they won't let us label and just make our own choice
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:26.120]  they're totalitarian now ladies and gentlemen i want to go back to our guests jeffrey smith
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:31.320]  responsible technology dot org you can find his books his films there also in for store dot com
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:36.920]  he's been with us for another five minutes the next hour the persie smizer joins us we're really focusing in on this today
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:40.760]  i've got some other geopolitical news i'm going to get to i haven't yet i said i would just so much of
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:46.520]  it it's on info wars dot com and prison punna dot com you wanted to get into one other uh issue before
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:51.480]  you got into uh the persecution that's that these groups just not just monsanto it's a whole
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:56.360]  combine of these organizations but i'd say they're the biggest head on the hydra uh or i guess kind
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:00.680]  of the main head of medusa but there's a lot of snakes up in her hair uh maybe that's the best
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:06.440]  analogy uh please continue sure by the way i'm in ecuador today because there's one of your
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:11.720]  listeners heard our interview earlier on started studying my work and invited me to come and speak
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:17.000]  in ecuador so thank you for that well thank you brother i was on the daily show uh recently and
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:22.200]  they did a terrible job in their coverage of the new genetically engineered non-browning potato
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:29.240]  and apple i wrote a very long article on my website responsible technology dot org as to why this
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:35.400]  new technology may be far more dangerous than any of the other type of gmo is produced it uses
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:43.240]  something called double stranded rna now the code on the rna little piece of rna matches up with the
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:51.240]  code of the dna and silences the gene so it silences the gene that produces the browning
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:57.640]  for the apple and the potato but it turns out that if we eat the apple and potato this double
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:06.360]  stranded rna code may match up with our gene code and silence or change our gene expression now as
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:13.160]  an example they fed some double stranded rna to honeybees and it was supposed to have no effect
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:21.560]  it was supposed to be the control group it turns out it changed 1461 genes levels of expression
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:28.600]  that means 10 of the entire genome of the honeybees were affected when they were fed one
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:36.120]  single meal this is pure badness rna is what viruses are made of uh and when you then bring
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:42.920]  rna into a plant or a human that's designed like this it's beyond a virus it's a turn off or turn
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:48.200]  on switch it just sounds like something that would give you cancer to me well it certainly
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:53.800]  could make changes that could possibly cause cancer but we don't know now the usda's own
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:58:00.440]  scientists said we don't have an assessment available to protect the public and environment
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:07.000]  from this double stranded rna we need to completely revamp our risk assessment two years later without
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  revamping the risk assessment the usda went ahead and approved double stranded rna in food now
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.440]  their excuse their excuse as well as the excuse from regulators around the world is based on
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:25.000]  science that's 10 years old well think how insane this is though it turns brown to let you know it's
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:30.440]  not as fresh this is normal it's like a vampire injection so you don't need to have any oxygen
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:36.520]  but you still are alive i mean this is just this is insane i mean there's no these apples can last
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:42.440]  18 days without turning brown the potatoes won't turn brown at all they'll just dry up and disappear
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:46.040]  and we don't know we're eating stay there stay there sir we're gonna come out of here this is
[01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:51.880]  insane this gets worse by the second using unparalleled research in the development of a
[01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:57.480]  synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation the next level
[01:58:57.480 --> 01:59:03.320]  in cleansing is here with key ingredients backed by real clinical studies the new oxy powder available
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:08.520]  through info wars life was invented during dr groups research on the toxification of our bodies
[01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:13.960]  many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:20.040]  ingredients oftentimes full of synthetic fillers gmo's additives or worse gently start cleaning
[01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:25.480]  your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep oxy powder does not require time
[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:31.000]  off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions instead oxy powder slowly releases
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:36.840]  monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body experience the astonishing cleansing power
[01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:43.480]  of superoxide and azanite technology go to info wars life dot com or info wars store dot com to
[01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:57.720]  get started with oxy powder or call 1-888-253-3139 you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:59:57.720 --> 02:00:12.120]  big brother mainstream media government cover ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:28.040]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:36.680]  already into hour number three the hero farmer the first one to really take on monsanto in a big
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:41.880]  way and go through hell but still win he's going to be joining us his first time was like a 1999 of
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:48.280]  his memory serves hersey schmeiser is going to be joining us coming up a final segment here
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:53.320]  with the man that heads up one of the premier organizations documenting what's happening in
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:58.840]  traveling the world responsible technology dot or g jeffrey smith we got about four minutes left
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:05.880]  of finish up with potatoes that that that never turned brown they just they just dry and then and
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:11.800]  then apples that you know take 18 days or whatever you said i mean this is just crazy and then
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:17.720]  they're changing the RNA to do this and as everybody knows you change one area of the genes
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:23.960]  then it charts chain reactioning every time it just we're just not ready to do this bare minimum
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:29.000]  go ahead well you're actually you're absolutely right alex when they looked at the honeybees with
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:35.480]  the 1461 changes in genes some were directly changed because of the matchup between the double
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:41.640]  stranded RNA and the genes and some of what were called secondary effects now we had no way of
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:47.240]  plan of predicting any of this and yet this is right in our face in the literature published in
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:54.280]  peer reviewed not just in insects but a mouse that they fed deep double stranded RNA from rice
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:59.480]  it changed the expression of a gene in their liver so the excuses by the regulators are so
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:04.680]  obsolete they say oh RNA won't have an effect it'll be destroyed before it gets into the bloodstream
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:09.000]  it'll never have an effect on mammals all of that has been proven well i've seen study after study
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:15.960]  as you know that dna and rna from plants uh and you know gmo stuff both leaks through
[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:20.200]  and interfaces with us the difference is we're designed to be in harmony with all this other
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:26.360]  stuff over all these years not all this new stuff precisely and the changes can be inheritable
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:31.160]  because of epigenetics now i have to end on good news alex i can't scare people about
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:36.920]  reprogramming their dna and then saying goodbye have a good day let me say let me say this you
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:41.720]  may be able to do that i can't uh at responsible technology dot org i'd like to recommend that
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:48.200]  those who would like to see us implement our master five-year plan to eliminate gmo's we could use
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:53.800]  your donation we are so far now advanced a long the way of creating tipping points in the united
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:59.560]  states and elsewhere we see that we can eliminate gmo's for our food supply within three years from
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:05.080]  animal feed within five years we have a very specific plan and we were looking for donations
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:09.560]  to support it now the fact that we were even at this level where we can have a five-year master
[02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:15.480]  plan to eliminate gmo's shows that the work we've been doing for in my case the last 19 years has
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:19.640]  been successful and by the way you're doing the kind of stuff that'll make them really come after
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:24.760]  you so we salute you you are a great place for people to donate to maximize an effect for humanity
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:31.400]  and 40 percent of americans now say they're avoiding or reducing gmo's even two years ago 75
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:35.960]  percent of americans were uncomfortable with it mostly because of the health issue and now we have
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:41.000]  chains like chipotle's and then other things where they're declaring non-gmo and getting huge
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:46.360]  publicity so we're seeing all the early signs of a tipping point now we have to make sure that moms
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:50.680]  know the truth that chronically ill people know the truth that pet owners know the truth about
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:56.280]  their pets that doctors know so we have very targeted demographic groups very specific powerful
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:04:01.800]  information and because thousands of people say that when they avoid eating gmo's they get better
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:07.400]  their kids get better we have stories to tell back by the science we have the communication
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:12.760]  tools necessary to change people's it's it's really very is this not so exciting i mean you
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:18.760]  were coming on the show like in 99 and stuff and back then this was i mean did did did did
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:23.960]  did this movement have two percent of the power it has now i mean no if we right now we are so
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:29.480]  further along it's unbelievable i speak to doctors conferences that i spoke at seven or eight years ago
[02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:34.360]  and they tell me since i was there they've been prescribing non-gmo diets and people after people
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:39.960]  after people are getting better and they describe gastrointestinal problems rashes allergies asthma
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:44.920]  yeah i mean weed killer's not good for you wow uh what a revolutionary thought but jeffrey
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:49.240]  smith had to say it jeffrey smith we salute you responsible technology dot org let's talk to you
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:52.520]  very soon as soon as you get back from ecuador you ever come through austin we want to get you in
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:59.880]  studio we'll be back with persie schmeiser the farmer that took on goliath you've probably seen
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:05.480]  plenty of pundits and late night talk show hosts make fun of parents who are skeptical of vaccines
[02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:10.600]  and even though it takes a room full of writers to produce one grade school level joke that couldn't
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:15.640]  get an audience to laugh without an led panel directing them to do so they don't seem too keen
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:21.480]  on exploring the why some parents are concerned such as vaccines maiming around 30 children in
[02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:27.800]  mexico two of whom died in zero of the funny guys want to talk about or how about the kids in syria
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:33.080]  dead from vaccines courtesy of the world health organization but you may be thinking well you
[02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:37.880]  never hear about that kind of stuff here in america well that's because reagan passed a law stating
[02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:43.240]  that you can't sue the vaccine makers so to all the guys who can't tell a joke without reading it
[02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:48.440]  off a teleprompter or having your producer whisper in your ear stick to making your designer suits
[02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:53.960]  look bad and leave people's children the hell alone and while you're at it check out the reports on

[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:42.520]  words like violence break the silence they come crashing in all i've ever wanted
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:49.160]  all i've ever needed is for us to keep our mouths shut right that's what monsanto wants
[02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:54.680]  well we're being violently attacked by gmo we're being violently attacked by glyphosate
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:09:00.520]  roundup we're being forced to not be able to have labels that say what's in it we're sick of it
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:06.280]  and if we can bring down the globalist on their monsanto and their mcdonald's front
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:11.880]  or force them to stop which leopards don't change their spots the devil doesn't put away his horns
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:18.760]  ever then the vaccine fraud is going to implode the medical tyranny is going to implode and on every
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:23.480]  front we're winning the intellectual battle that's why they're counter-offencing right now with forced
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:28.680]  inoculations worldwide lying about that it's why they're counter launching trying to push gmo's
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:37.320]  worldwide it's not working now it was back in 1999 when all this started and persie schmeiser
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:43.720]  had monsanto coming after him they were claiming that even though he had the record of buying his
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:48.840]  seeds that he needed to pay them because you know his crops have been contaminated and when they
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:54.520]  contaminate you they then try to charge you now i've interviewed him several times over the years
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:10:03.960]  but i tell you the the tables have turned muigrande big time they have changed in a big way and fast
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:11.640]  big big we just went over that in the last hour and listen this is a microcosm well it's actually
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:17.800]  huge this huge victory this this huge war connects to all the other things we're fighting it's the
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:24.760]  same eugenesis globalist agenda and we're so close that's why they're tripling down everything
[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:30.360]  they're doing and then doubling down again and doubling down again because it's all coming out
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:35.080]  yes there's illegal NSA spying it's being used for political control and blackmail
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:38.920]  yes they've gotten rid of the borders for north american union yes we're going under global treaties
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:43.480]  of these corporations so they can rule us uh you know yes our government's funding radical
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:47.800]  islamists to destabilize the middle east and taker liberties at home the name of stopping them
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:54.040]  yes they're trying to bankrupt small farms and ranches across the world to consolidate for big
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:11:00.600]  agri this is a consolidation vertical integration war in the big corporation's own words
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:06.920]  and persie schmeiser is again a farmer from bruno suscash in one canada
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:11.000]  i interviewed him when it was literally first in the news i'm proud of that fact
[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:16.200]  he specializes in breeding and growing canola he became an enemy he creates his own amazing
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:19.640]  seed line they didn't like that that's who they target they've bought up the original
[02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:23.640]  seed line see it's a monopoly he became an international symbol of spokesman
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:28.520]  for interdependent farmers rights and the regulation of transgenetic crops during his
[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:32.920]  protracted legal battle with multinational agricultural company monsanto he was a subject
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:41.160]  of the 2009 uh david versus monsanto film schmeiser served as mayor of bruno from 66 83
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:48.040]  and his town counselor uh since 2003 and currently serves as the deputy mayor in 2000 he received the
[02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:55.720]  how do you pronounce that mathem uh oh bahamud ghandi award for working for the good of mankind
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:11:59.720]  in the nonviolent way that's a big global award the bahamud ghandi award i guess that's given
[02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:07.960]  by their family in 2007 persie schmeiser and uh louise schmeiser were named winners of the
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:12.680]  right livelihood award for their courage in defending biodiversity and farmers rights
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:17.800]  and challenging the environmental and moral provavity of current interpretations of patent
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:23.480]  laws and he joins us now and and again if you're a libertarian or right-wing listener
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:28.120]  i'm just a patriot i just love humanity i just want freedom there are some issues the liberals
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:32.280]  claim to own some republicans claim to own conservatives like second amendment rights
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:38.120]  well listen i just look at each issue as what resonates in my soul my heart
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:43.080]  and for my political research i'm pro life i'm pro second amendment i'm pro private property
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:47.000]  pro family rights pro choice in your medical decisions though for what the government wants to
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:53.800]  put in you like vaccines but real liberals who are farmers and folks just do the research they
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:59.160]  tend to be more educated and they understand how dangerous vaccines and gmo's are they'd use gmo's
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:05.800]  if they worked and were safer they're not and so we we have to transcend all these labels and come
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:11.000]  together and that's what we see upwards of 80 percent have now turned against gmo in this country
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:15.160]  when just a decade ago most people were for it smoking the dope that it was no big deal
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:21.320]  so we've hit a major tipping point i want to recap his story i want to get into what he went through
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:26.280]  uh but first off percy schmeiser i've just been ranting for five minutes i'm so excited
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:32.680]  you've been through this saga you've been through the ringer are you glad you did it and is it
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:38.200]  bittersweet or or how fulfilling is it because in my life when i've been persecuted gone through hell
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:44.760]  when i go through it and i'm victorious those are the things i value most in my life i mean i
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:48.280]  look back on things that were horrible at the time where i did the right thing and people were
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:53.560]  attacking me laughing at me coming at me but later i was proven right i savor it and i'm not an
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:59.880]  arrogant person but uh i don't savor status or money or power or or any of that stuff but i do
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:05.720]  savor the adversity the hard road doing it my way doing the right thing and winning
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:09.960]  you are an incredible hero i mean you're like a movie star to me what you did one of the first
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:15.160]  and only people to stand up when nobody else was to go through the gauntlet through the night
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:21.080]  circle and and and here you are what is it like for you today to see global victories against this
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:28.680]  wicked institution of monsanto well it it is a very gratifying thing that has happened we would
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:34.520]  never have changed or never would change what we have done we would do the same thing over today
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:40.760]  if it if it would happen again no one and that's stand both my wife and myself took should be able
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:46.920]  to control the future of life and especially the life of a seed and and take your rights away no one
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:51.160]  should have that right and that's why it was happening to us and that's why we sewed up to
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:56.760]  monsanto because we believe in the freedoms of our people and the people of what people eat
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:15:02.680]  and the rights of farmers to use their seed from year to year amazing now you've got the floor and
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:07.400]  i could go anywhere with this but where do you want to start first well there's so many issues
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:12.600]  you don't want to there's the issue of the environment the issue of labeling the issue of
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:19.880]  the farmers rights patent law so there's so many issues and then if i look back what we were told
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:27.640]  by especially monsanto back in 1996 and 1997 when the GMOs first introduced in both our
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:33.400]  countries canada and the united states and what has happened today it's just amazing and it just
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:42.920]  shows how we as the people were laid laid or led down the ivory by the ivory tower and so again
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:50.440]  there's so many issues that come arise and i think the one time there was a time when often we would
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:56.360]  say will this every end will will will we be successful and believe me in the last two years
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:16:02.760]  it's been gratifying to see now before it was an issue of farmers but now it's an issue of everyone
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:07.880]  the rights of people to know what's in their food the rights people to know and have labeling so they
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:13.800]  can have the right proof for the children and grandchildren and so on so that's very gratifying
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:21.480]  to see what has happened especially in the last two years wow i mean it's just to see in the last
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:28.520]  month the tipping point began and the implosion of mcdonald's monsanto being derated down to a bad
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:32.760]  investment by major brokerage firms to see all these hundreds of big companies saying they're
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:40.760]  going to start getting the gmo out uh you know the the the the roundup uh the aspartame the additives
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:45.960]  i mean it's not just on roundup and it's not just monsanto across the board i think we've
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:53.400]  hit the tipping point uh what do you think very much so because i mentioned like the the food
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:59.800]  that we eat and and the ability to know what we eat but the whole issue besides the control of farmers
[02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:05.160]  is the whole issue of health which is causing a lot of problems and i think that's why like you
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:10.120]  mentioned it's not only one company there's a number of companies involved in this whole issue
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:17.160]  and i believe that uh it has taken this long forward to to come full circle and people now
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:21.480]  know and realize what it's all doing to them and the health issue the environmental issue
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:27.480]  the control the pat mission the control of people are farmers in what they grow and the
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:33.480]  ability of the farmers not allowed to use your state from year to year to give you an example
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:40.200]  canola in canada right now uh you have you have to buy from a company there's really no uh
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:45.800]  conventional canola left it's all gmo so that that just shows you to an extent and that was the
[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:51.400]  plan explain that i mean they targeted the farmers first to take over the market to monopolize
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:56.360]  like walmart does come in and get rid of all the businesses around it and then jacking up prices
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:18:02.760]  i mean explain how they did this where you can't even get i mean they destroyed the original system
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:09.000]  of sharing the seeds exactly and to give you an example it used to cost the farm around 90 cents
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:16.760]  a uh an acre to seed a canola crop to seed that same acre today because you're forced to buy the
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:24.120]  seed cost you for close to 60 dollars an acre and you have no choice if you want to grow canola
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:30.760]  you have to buy a genetic altered canola and if you were to go to australia or germany somewhere
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:36.280]  and get none gmo canola and think you're going to see that here you can do that but i guarantee you
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:41.800]  by the time fall comes or harvest time comes it's contaminated and you can be fined on top of it for
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:47.800]  growing a crop with gmo's in it now let's get this straight you buy it certified from germany as again
[02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:51.640]  you were i mean i want to go back when we come back from break and recap what you were doing
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:57.240]  you have your good seeds you've got the receipts uh and then their stuff blows into your crop or
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:01.880]  they plant it there as we know there's evidence of that's probably going on then they have their
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:06.600]  people usually former fbi agents or world mountain police they go and pull the plant
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:11.640]  out of all the others they know is theirs and then they sue you saying you stole their stuff
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:16.600]  even though they've contaminated percy smizer exactly and the level here's another thing that
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:21.640]  the court had ruled at that time the rate of contamination does not matter if it's even half
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:28.040]  of one percent you you are allowed for patent infringement and they can take your crop make
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:34.360]  you burn your crop and and charge you so much an acre and they will under the patent law stay there i
[02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:39.080]  want you to break down and explain it because it's not like a plant has one daddy one mommy a plant
[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:44.600]  can have you know a hundred dads or moms in there because it's it's it's cumulative with pollen uh so
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:49.800]  if they get one little bit of their pollen on your plant in your field and it's half a percent
[02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:55.160]  monsanto they take everything you've got that's because they wrote the laws and it's unbelievable
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:20:00.280]  premeditated takeover

[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:08.520]  and they use north america as their as their nesting operation before they invaded the rest of the
[02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:13.000]  planet when i say invade i mean they've got secret projects to infiltrate third world countries and
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:18.840]  plant and get around their laws i mean they are hardcore hersey schmeiser worldwide hero against

[02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:32.280]  he's knocked out he's been hitting the head by by one of those smooth riverstones and i think all
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:36.760]  of us collectively have got that big sword up all we've got to do is have the will to drop it
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:41.960]  and deal the killer blow uh so percy schmeiser tell your story and we come back i want to talk
[02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:49.000]  about dealing the death blow okay i'm really glad you asked me to comment on on this particular area
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:57.240]  i was uh my wife and i had a lawsuit laid against the bias by monsanto in 1998 two years after the
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:04.360]  introduction of gmo was into u.s and canada and that was on canola soya corn and cotton
[02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:09.880]  but a lot of people don't know the other lawsuits that we went through so this was the first lawsuit
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.640]  it was a patent infringement where monsanto was saying we were growing monsanto's gmo's without
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:22.280]  a license from them and because we were contaminated the judge ruled we ought to or should have known
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:29.640]  that there was some gmo's from monsanto in our crop so that was the first lawsuit and by the time
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:35.560]  it went through the court of the first court the court of appeal and stream court monsanto at the
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:41.880]  court of appeal laid another lawsuit against us that i'm going to tell you this because of how
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:47.160]  they tried to stop us they laid a million dollar law another lawsuit of a million dollars
[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:55.080]  lawsuit against us to try and stop us financially so we had that lawsuit to fight also now we
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:28:01.240]  questioned where do you arrive at the million dollars and they said 750 000 for uh legal
[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:07.800]  and uh expense for monsanto 250 000 for a displacement cost so we had to fight that
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:16.440]  so at the end of that trial uh the court ruled that we would not have to pay monsanto any money
[02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:22.200]  until the final decision might be by a court would be made so that that was bad enough we had to
[02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:27.800]  fight the million dollar one but what was worse than after that they did again tried to stop us
[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:34.680]  they laid a lien or caveat they tried to seize our home all our farmland our bank accounts
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:41.320]  and our farm equipment so now we were back in court again uh to fight so we had by the time we were
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:47.560]  successful to have this case heard all the way to the stream court uh there were three lawsuits
[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:53.960]  by monsanto against us and what made it really bad at that one point in time towards at the last
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:29:00.520]  lawsuit laid against us we ran into one of monsanto's representatives that uh in fact this was at
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:08.520]  cape town south africa at the at the parliament and coming out the door of the assembly of the
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:15.000]  south african parliament one of monsanto's reps ran into my wife and myself and he shook his fist
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:20.680]  in our face and said no one no one ever stands up to monsanto we're going to get both of you
[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:26.760]  somehow someday and we're going to destroy you so you can imagine the pressure that we had on us

[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:19.960]  dot com and lives here in austin persie smizer is our guest and i'm going to give him the floor
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:23.960]  of about five ten minutes for anthony has some questions and some news on monsanto so we're
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:28.680]  getting into how they were persecuting what they were doing to you persie smizer they were going
[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:35.480]  to destroy you this is back in the late 90s they were going after farmers everywhere saying look
[02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:39.000]  we're going to take plants out of your yard without a warrant no matter what the u.s or canada
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:43.800]  if we find one percent or half percent of our genetics in years that we contaminated
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:48.040]  in the pollen blowing in the wind miles we're going to go to court we're going to say you've
[02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:54.520]  stolen our patent they'd be like patenting our snicker or or or or oh let's use something
[02:34:54.520 --> 02:35:03.080]  of that you know some of the gold purifiers will do cyanide and then it runs out into a lake and
[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:08.120]  kills a bunch of animals or people's fish or people's kids and then they sue you and they
[02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:13.000]  sue your dead kid because they're their poison got into them well well they can't patent that
[02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:19.720]  they can't patent cyanide but they're basically saying they can patent their gmo and then when
[02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:24.440]  they contaminate you that's the case so persie smizer break down how this worked and then
[02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:30.760]  the saga and what you went through finally being victorious that's correct and then
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:37.000]  then about two years of the string cord rule that monsanto's patent on a gene is valid but
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:44.120]  my wife and i did not have the string cord rule rule that we did not have to pay monsanto
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:49.320]  any money from all the three lawsuits that we had to pay our own legal expense because they said we
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:56.440]  did not profit by the fact of being contaminated by monsanto so in other words what the court has
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:36:03.960]  ruled is that a patent law by a corporation is over and above farmers right now we thought it was
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:11.080]  all over at that time with monsanto and that this was by that time 2004 but we had because we were
[02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:17.480]  seed developers especially in canola we my wife decided and my wife that we would never want to go
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:24.520]  through what we did again and we decided to do not grow canola anymore and we would start doing
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:31.560]  research on yellow mustard table mustard and we had we're repairing some land for that about 50 acres
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:37.240]  and in the fall time before the year that we were going to see that we noticed that there was again
[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:43.560]  canola going in it and there was no canola had been planted in that land so we knew it was blown
[02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:50.600]  in by states by farmers calling to the market to the crushing factory or facilities and so on so
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:57.400]  uh we did testing and here we found out that it was monsanto's canola and in the end we took
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:04.360]  monsanto to court for contaminating our land on it and we were successful monsanto had to pay for
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:11.400]  the contamination cleanup now the amount that we received for the cleanup was not that much but the
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:18.520]  fact was that monsanto paid later precedent for future farmers if they are contaminated by monsanto
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:23.720]  there's an avenue a new legal method that they can take monsanto to court and be victorious
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:29.640]  because as i said a precedent to a set so that was a major major victory and you can imagine why
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:35.960]  monsanto even today still tries to come after us and to do to do or to run us down or ruin our
[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:43.240]  reputation by whatever means they can but anyway we feel that it's been a great victory indian
[02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:49.480]  performers right that if they lose their ability to be organic which they surely will happen they
[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:54.520]  can take monsanto to court but the only thing that's wrong with this is that you have to have a lot
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:38:00.040]  of money to be able to stand to up to a big corporation in court they have millions of dollars
[02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:06.600]  to spend to give you an example my court case to stand up for what we believed in cost us a half
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:12.440]  a million dollars my wife and i and we had a lot of help in paying that monsanto's bill was two
[02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:17.880]  million dollars and at one point in court they had 19 lawyers against us so you can imagine what they
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:23.480]  did to try and destroy anyone that stands up to them and that's why a lot of farmers cannot
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:28.920]  stand up to them because they don't have the financial abilities and the time to do that
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:37.000]  or also sure the mental attitude you can imagine what that puts on you well you had the will and
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:41.800]  you were a c developer on your own you knew it was all a fraud and you struck back and became
[02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:47.800]  international hero and people came and aided you and we don't even need a minority just a time
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:52.680]  minority to say no and that will change history and you're one of those those key people in that
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:58.200]  please continue with other points you'd like to make about your battle with monsanto where it went
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:03.480]  and then some of the things they've been up to today and then your take on just the sea change
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:09.400]  we see happening globally but now finally here in the us their command base where the whole world
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:14.280]  seems to be turning against them i mean i know why that is you go to the fanciest restaurants
[02:39:15.560 --> 02:39:19.320]  when i've been out in hollywood or whatever or in new york wherever when i've been invited out by
[02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:25.000]  by different people that have you invited me there and no one will eat anything that's gmo no one
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:30.280]  would anything that isn't organic it's on record that you know george w bush and the clintons and
[02:39:30.280 --> 02:39:34.120]  all of them only eat organic that's what they have on their aircrafts what's it's what's an
[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:40.520]  air force one the chinese elites the the european elites they won't take the vaccines the prime
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:46.200]  minister of australia is in the news saying my my kids don't take vaccines but you've got to i mean
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:53.480]  you can't make this up so how can they force something on us when they avoid it like the
[02:39:53.480 --> 02:40:01.160]  plague percy smizer okay what has happened is is this is that what we said would happen back in
[02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:07.640]  the late 90s is that more chemical use and so on and and what has happened now we've developed
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:13.720]  superweeds that are resistant to this chemical and now they have what we call out new super
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:20.600]  chemicals to try and kill this new super weed because of the introduction of gmo's and there's
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:27.080]  another thing to crop us uh like what has happened a lot of people don't know that in the harvest
[02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:33.560]  time a lot of times farmers now will spray uh round up or the herbicide round up to kill their crop
[02:40:33.560 --> 02:40:40.200]  so it ripens more even especially they have roly land and now you have that residue in the door
[02:40:40.200 --> 02:40:45.560]  the milk of that seed so it's not only the chemicals that are sprayed on the on the land
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:52.840]  before seeding to kill the weed now you have it to kill the crop so they can harvest it sooner
[02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:59.640]  or ripen sooner if you have you don't have total flat land so now you can imagine the residue
[02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:04.840]  that we have in our food and that's why they're such a demand for people to know what's in our
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:09.320]  food the labeling so they don't have to eat this not to mention the water table i was seeing a
[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:17.800]  number just the other day that 97 of us water is contaminated with round up exactly and and it's
[02:41:17.800 --> 02:41:24.600]  the soil the air the environment that has really taken a beating from the massive increased use
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:30.600]  of chemicals now the chemicals that they use one of the chemicals they use in the combination of
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:40.200]  genetic altered chemicals is um is um i'm trying to think the name of age and orange and we all
[02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:45.640]  know what age and orange did it to the people in the eat them and that's in some of the chemicals
[02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:50.280]  that are being used today in both our countries well you got the top lobbyist Patrick Moore
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:54.840]  one of the top ones from on santo who ran around for years saying i'll drink a glass of it well
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:42:01.720]  finally he got cold i guess it was last year by a reporter in canada okay go ahead and drink it
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:09.160]  and here is the video of what ensued pesticide lobbyist refuses to drink what he's out there
[02:42:09.160 --> 02:42:13.400]  pushing in fact we'll put the headline back on screen pesticide lobbyist refuses to drink lobbyist
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:19.480]  for claiming it's safe to drink again that's up on info wars dot com that was actually in march of
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:26.760]  this year time's flying let's go ahead and play that clip i do not believe that glyphosate in
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:31.720]  argentina is causing increases in cancer you can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:38.280]  you want to drink some we have some here i'd be happy to actually but not not really but i know
[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:44.840]  it wouldn't hurt me if if you say so i have some i'm not stupid okay so you you know but i know
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:49.960]  it's dangerous i know i know people try to commit suicide with it and fail fairly regularly tell the
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:55.400]  truth it's not dangerous to humans no it's not so are you ready to drink one glass of no i'm not
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:43:00.840]  an idiot interview me about golden rice that's what i'm talking about okay then it's finished
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:08.600]  except then the interview is finished let's say that's a good way to solve things yeah here a complete jerk
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:13.640]  i mean these guys are a piece of work man all these years no one was calling
[02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:17.960]  on the congame i'll drink this who are drinking are you kidding i'm not an idiot
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:24.920]  persie what do you think of that club have you seen that no i haven't seen it but i'll tell you
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:31.000]  what happened just quickly in australia was at a meeting uh given a presentation and uh after the
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:37.560]  presentation one of the people got up to ask questions about the contamination of of uh
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:43.720]  of the chemical uh what it would do to you and you and being if they drank it and the person
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:48.760]  was from monsanto and i said okay if i go out and i'll get somebody from the audience go out and
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:53.400]  i'll get some insecticide and i'll have i'll spray some in your mouth will you let me do that and
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:59.080]  he said no certainly not so that it's the same thing you know they'll say all this at its safe
[02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:04.040]  but when it when they have to maybe try and somebody asked them to drink with us or spray an
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:09.720]  insecticide in your mouth they won't do it well that's the thing an insecticide and herbicide
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:16.920]  i'm no rocket scientist i'm not a chemist but i or an epidemiologist or a toxicologist but i've
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:25.400]  had them all on talking about how bad it is but weed killer that's killing rats that eat it it
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:30.840]  doesn't sound like a good idea for me to ingest that just i mean call me a conspiracy theorist if
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:36.440]  you want i'm sure they will but it just drink weed killer i mean come on anthill you already
[02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:40.360]  seared do you have any questions for this hero percy smizer well you know what's interesting
[02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:44.600]  percy all three of us on this program have something very interesting in comment we've
[02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:49.560]  all been attacked by monsanto backed groups but when i was researching you and i know about your
[02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:53.800]  story but i was just pulling up some articles today that i was interested in i noticed that
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:58.760]  monsanto had spent a lot of money taking over your search results and in fact they actually
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:04.840]  have this piece now it must be pretty new looks like it's fairly new to me it's called myth monsanto
[02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:09.800]  sews farmers when gmos or gmc is accidentally in their fields and they actually name you here's
[02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:16.120]  what they say they say it's a total myth it says fact and i sent this to the producers as well
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:21.160]  monsanto has never sued a farmer when trace amounts of our patents and seeds or traits
[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:25.880]  present in the farmers field as an accident or as a result it sounds like marco rubio saying
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:33.320]  there's no nsa spying period and listen to this the misperception that monsanto would sue a farmer
[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:39.320]  was accidentally if mons if gmc was accidentally in his field likely began with percy schmeiser
[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:44.920]  who was brought to court in canada by monsanto for illegally saving roundup ready canola seed
[02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:50.360]  mr schmeiser claims to this day the presence of monsanto's technology in his fields was accidental
[02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:55.160]  even though three separate court decisions concluded his claims were false and of course
[02:45:55.160 --> 02:46:01.160]  they say this quote unquote fact because the systems are so rigged up that you are a bad person and
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:05.960]  you illegally sold their seeds so they can actually say it's a myth that they've never sued anyone
[02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:11.640]  for that yet of course there are a bunch of articles every single news organization admits
[02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:16.760]  yes it always goes on this is from salon the supreme court won't stop monsanto from suing
[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:21.080]  farmers a lawsuit would have protected farmers or farmers if their fields became inadvertently
[02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:25.800]  contaminated it's all they shoot thousands is in the news yeah it's in the news every single day
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:31.560]  but then once again they were suing indian farmers on monsanto's article myth monsanto
[02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:36.600]  sues farmers farmers you know did you hear it's a myth it's a myth the sun came up this morning
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:41.960]  anthony it's also a myth that canada australia and i believe it was japan two days ago issued an
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:47.400]  international warning over gmo contamination saying that we cannot stop it primarily also
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:51.000]  because if it we get contaminated and we say something about it you know farmers independent
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:56.680]  farmers monsanto will sue you so you can't stop gmo harcy what do you make of this new monsanto
[02:46:56.680 --> 02:47:03.160]  connected article uh saying that they've never sued a farmer for uh trace contamination well
[02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:09.240]  you know i'd like them to talk to the uh lawyer that defended me he's how many cases he's had
[02:47:09.240 --> 02:47:14.840]  where uh monsanto has uh taken people to court now sir are you saying monsanto lies because
[02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:19.160]  they told everybody age and orange didn't hurt humans either i mean i mean they don't lie this
[02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:25.240]  is a good good people even though at their own facilities in the u.s and canada on record at
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:30.520]  the cbc reported they will not have any non-gmo their scientists in the cafeteria but but that
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:35.400]  it's still it's fun though right persie well i'll give you an example of what they did here
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:41.320]  well my case was going on they went to a number of farmers that offered 20 000 dollars if they
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:47.000]  would say something negative about me and that would be not in cash but in chemicals they would
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:54.600]  give them a chemical to use worth 20 000 to say they said it did they exactly have to be uh exact
[02:47:54.600 --> 02:48:00.040]  but long as you say something to uh to try and ruin my reputation or degrade me or they would
[02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:05.800]  take farmers fish on a fishing trip buy new uh all the entertainment or the entertainment the
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:12.200]  liquid refreshment now for them to have and that's what they do they come into the area they try and
[02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:18.760]  destroy you no they're nice that's why they dumped oxen in black neighborhoods and covered it up
[02:48:18.760 --> 02:48:22.840]  they're good people that's why they had to pay 90 million dollars to the town of nitro for killing
[02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:28.600]  all of them they're good people and headline monsanto sues farmers for 16 years straight over gmo's
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:35.160]  never loses once since 1997 monsanto has filed 145 lawsuits on average about nine lawsuits every
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:39.640]  year for 16 straight years according to farmers who have improperly used their patented seeds
[02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:45.240]  like you persie biotech giant hasn't lost a single case and by and by the way it's way more than 145
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:49.560]  this is just on this one issue this includes when farmers tried to sue monsanto over cross
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:53.720]  pollination of their gmo crops with gm's yeah the monsanto's they said they didn't ever do that
[02:48:53.720 --> 02:48:58.440]  no they say they don't know they said no no they said marco rubio said there's no nsa spying on
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:02.680]  anybody in america which means there's not he said it yeah and the military is not training for
[02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:08.920]  domestic operations either anthony monsanto sues no one absolutely no one but they don't even exist
[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:13.240]  it doesn't exist it's not conspiracy theories there's even gmo crops it's not on all these 20
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:18.920]  articles that i have right here sorry sir go ahead in fact he doesn't bother persie smizer doesn't
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:23.560]  exist sorry sir i was imagining things go ahead sorry but if you go to the center of food safety
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:30.200]  in washington they documented 100 cases that where monsanto had taken the farmers to court
[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:36.200]  and the average settlement was $150,000 for each but notice they changed the subject and go no we
[02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:41.560]  did just to have a debate about that see that psych warfare tactic persie why do you think
[02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:49.240]  there's such ball face liars well i think that there's no morals there the issue is just the
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:56.360]  bottom line and and everything has to give for that bottom line there's there's a lot of i often
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:00.520]  say there's a lot of good companies out there but there's a lot of companies that are not so good
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:06.680]  and they'll do anything to it doesn't matter how it hurts people with their health their food issue
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:13.480]  the environment how much did you destroy the environment destroy biodiversity destroy indigenous

[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:06.760]  closing comments anything else you'd like to add we salute you we appreciate you you're a testament
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:11.320]  to doing the right thing being steadfast and going through the furnace to come out stronger on the
[02:55:11.320 --> 02:55:19.160]  other side uh their move against global seed stores to try to buy up any heirloom original
[02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:27.640]  seeds it's been simply amazing percy schmeiser yes there's been many areas where the the total
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:33.480]  control of seed plant seed issue or seed plants and seeds are being trying to be taken over by
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:40.040]  a corporation now i'll give you a quick example on this they've been trying to bring in in north
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:46.680]  america and even asia the terminator gene where all the seeds uh produced from a plant that has
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:53.560]  a terminator gene are sterile and you're forced to go back to um to buy the seed from a corporation
[02:55:53.560 --> 02:56:00.360]  to me it's absolutely criminal that where a corporation tries to bring out a new life form
[02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:08.120]  or a life form that is that will the uh teach from that plant or they will be sterile it's not
[02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:12.680]  really even a life form or they can't reproduce they say one of the signs of life is reproduction
[02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:19.320]  it's like a it's an abomination is what it is it is and to me that to me any company that tries to
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:25.880]  bring that out how far do you go with it a seed plant what about a human being that the future
[02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:31.320]  of life would be total controlled by a corporation a lot of people don't realize how far this is going
[02:56:31.320 --> 02:56:38.280]  to try and control the whole issue of the future of life whereas a seed an animal a human being it
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:45.240]  doesn't matter full spectrum dominance full spectrum dominance exactly amazing percy spicer we salute

[02:59:51.400 --> 02:59:54.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:59:54.040 --> 03:00:07.640]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[03:00:08.200 --> 03:00:11.320]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:00:17.320 --> 03:00:19.080]  it's the best of times worst of times
[03:00:19.080 --> 03:00:27.080]  tell two cities i can't quote tell two cities without quoting the whole thing you guys pull
[03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:32.280]  up the opening passage so i can uh actually read it anything it started you got some other news
[03:00:32.280 --> 03:00:36.920]  you didn't get to we're in overdrive get to it we know persia i think set the stage now if we look
[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:41.000]  to the future back when he was fighting this there was little to no support and now we have
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:45.960]  how many hundreds of thousands of people coming out to events like march against monsanto and 96
[03:00:45.960 --> 03:00:50.920]  percent of the united states public admitting they want gmo labeling the usda announcing today
[03:00:50.920 --> 03:00:56.280]  that they finally are making a government form of gmo labels which is actually a victory because it
[03:00:56.280 --> 03:01:00.520]  means they're being forced to listen to us so now it's up to us to just push it in the next
[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:06.440]  direction to the next level to force and mandate gmo labeling on all products whether it's by voting
[03:01:06.440 --> 03:01:11.000]  with your dollar and deciding we're not going to buy the junk anymore or just defunding monsanto
[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:16.760]  as a whole because as you talked about before this this piece i believe it's from uh roiders monsanto
[03:01:16.760 --> 03:01:21.880]  loses 156 million in fiscal fourth quarter that's been happening every month that's why they're
[03:01:21.880 --> 03:01:26.840]  trying to buy up biotech giant singenta which is even more concerning they make genetically modified
[03:01:26.840 --> 03:01:31.640]  animals well i was going to that next which with persia but i never did going back at least 10
[03:01:31.640 --> 03:01:36.680]  years you see articles where somebody goes to get gene therapy but they but they gave a blood ampule
[03:01:36.680 --> 03:01:41.640]  when they were born and the companies have bought that from the government they go sorry we own your
[03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:49.320]  genes now 200 000 for a breast cancer treatment but it should cost you know 500 and they're going
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:54.040]  no we own your genes in the supreme court rule they don't but they're still doing it they're still
[03:01:54.040 --> 03:01:59.080]  doing it and monsanto sees big picture because when i think when you see a company losing money
[03:01:59.080 --> 03:02:04.360]  like this hundreds of millions of dollars they're actually gearing up to the next level stuff so
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:09.320]  they're actually gearing up now in a fighter flight stage to buy up singenta so they can
[03:02:09.320 --> 03:02:13.240]  start making genetically modified cattle genetically modified chickens which by the way
[03:02:13.240 --> 03:02:18.520]  they're already doing in china they've had for at least 15 years part human cows that produce human
[03:02:18.520 --> 03:02:23.720]  milk uh that grow baby uh will buy some humanoids for organ harvesting if you're a new listener this
[03:02:23.720 --> 03:02:27.480]  sounds insane they have everything it's mainstream news i you can't make them stop they've grown
[03:02:27.480 --> 03:02:31.080]  in the dark cats all the weirdest things in the world they're just going to start importing them
[03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:34.920]  now into the united states yeah they're getting ready to sell glow in the dark cats right part
