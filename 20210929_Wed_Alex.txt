[00:00.000 --> 00:15.600]  We're going to have well over a billion, 100 million shots and we're going to continue
[00:15.600 --> 00:16.600]  going.
[00:16.600 --> 00:23.600]  I think we get the vast majority, but it's going on in some of the, some industries in
[00:23.600 --> 00:31.680]  some schools, 97, 98 percent. These are just advisors. Their recommendations are not binding.
[00:31.680 --> 00:36.480]  The FDA can ultimately say, we disagree. We want to move forward with boosters.
[00:36.480 --> 00:42.480]  As CDC director, it's my job to recognize where our actions can have the greatest impact.
[00:42.480 --> 00:47.240]  Had I been in the room and on the committee, I would have voted yes. And that is reflected
[00:47.240 --> 00:52.960]  in my resulting decision to allow the use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster dose for
[00:52.960 --> 00:57.920]  those 18 and older at high risk of COVID-19 exposure and transmission.
[00:57.920 --> 01:06.120]  Pfizer CEO says CDC's decision to push boosters against recommendations of top scientific
[01:06.120 --> 01:09.360]  panels, a very good one, he said.
[01:09.360 --> 01:14.240]  At the end of the day, I think the decision that they made is a very good one, I think.
[01:14.240 --> 01:22.040]  The CDC panel and the FDA panel that are scientists and virologists who were put there under statutory
[01:22.040 --> 01:28.040]  law to basically make sure there's oversight, that has been overridden.
[01:28.040 --> 01:36.240]  And Fauci says, and Pfizer says around Halloween, they're going to announce down to two-year-olds
[01:36.240 --> 01:41.200]  are going to get the shot, even though the FDA scientists quit that are over that.
[01:41.200 --> 01:47.480]  As you know, Dr. Fauci, Pfizer says a low dose coronavirus vaccine is safe for children
[01:47.480 --> 01:53.280]  ages 5 to 11 years old. How big of a game changer would this be and how quickly could
[01:53.280 --> 01:57.360]  children in this age group start actually getting vaccinated?
[01:57.360 --> 02:03.520]  Well, the data is going to be presented to the FDA for application of an emergency use
[02:03.520 --> 02:09.120]  authorization. When the FDA looks at that, I'm sure they'll work very quickly to make
[02:09.120 --> 02:13.520]  a determination as officially to its safety and its immunogenicity.
[02:13.520 --> 02:20.520]  So what would you say? Home school or get the vaccine?
[02:20.520 --> 02:24.520]  I'll see if I can get to these two.
[02:24.520 --> 02:29.520]  I'll see if I can get to these two.
[02:29.520 --> 02:35.160]  Meet scientists Justin Durant and regional business lead Brandon Schatt, officials with
[02:35.160 --> 02:40.160]  pharma giant Johnson & Johnson. Both men echo startling admissions about their own
[02:40.160 --> 02:47.160]  company's COVID vaccine and their concerns on long-term repercussions for children.
[02:47.160 --> 02:50.160]  Right.
[02:50.160 --> 03:04.320]  They're like, you're just the top scientist. Even though these are pro-vax people bought
[03:04.320 --> 03:08.880]  and paid for by big pharma, they've gone, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is going to discredit
[03:08.880 --> 03:14.720]  vaccines for generations. That's a quote by the chief scientist at the FDA that quit
[03:14.720 --> 03:19.560]  three weeks ago. And then the panels voted the way they said they should and they got
[03:19.560 --> 03:20.560]  overridden.
[03:20.560 --> 03:27.000]  And that's why the two top scientists, number one, number two at this FDA quit three weeks
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.320]  ago is they were told when the boards say this shouldn't be given, we're going to override
[03:32.320 --> 03:37.000]  them. They said the political hacks, who's not even a doctor at the White House is going
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.480]  to override them. They said, yes. And the head of Pfizer, he is your president. He's
[03:41.480 --> 03:46.160]  your God. He's your doctor. Even though your doctor can't make you do something, he can
[03:46.160 --> 03:47.160]  and he is.
[03:47.160 --> 03:54.080]  And you know what? God did answer our prayers. He made the smartest men and women, the scientists,
[03:54.080 --> 03:59.440]  the doctors, the researchers. He made them come up with a vaccine. That is from God to
[03:59.440 --> 04:03.400]  us. And we must say thank you, God.
[04:03.400 --> 04:09.840]  When the federal government do beyond mandates in getting people to actually take the vaccine
[04:09.840 --> 04:14.720]  or at least believe that when they're in the hospital, that I have a mechanism that is
[04:14.720 --> 04:17.200]  not going to save them.
[04:17.200 --> 04:23.560]  I mean, that's really it as far as I know is mandates. Mandates do seem to work to get
[04:23.560 --> 04:27.800]  people, the majority of people, even people who are prone to conspiracy thinking to say,
[04:27.800 --> 04:36.400]  I don't want to lose my job.
[04:36.400 --> 04:41.720]  Well, if you think that's bad, you wait down the road and they know this. And then even
[04:41.720 --> 04:47.720]  the FDA scientists and CDC scientists and UK scientists are like, hey, we better EU scientists,
[04:47.720 --> 04:52.120]  we better not do this. You better stop. They're like, shut up with your boards that you can
[04:52.120 --> 04:58.120]  be in charge. Pfizer and Moderna, that's DARPA, they say fools be ahead.
[04:58.120 --> 05:04.560]  You want to have double-blind randomized placebo testing without what that means. You give
[05:04.560 --> 05:11.160]  20,000 people the vaccine when it comes to phase two, phase three trials, and you give
[05:11.160 --> 05:16.520]  20,000 people a placebo. And then you really look at how it comes for a long period of
[05:16.520 --> 05:22.240]  time, not four weeks. A lot of these injuries, the autoimmune injuries, you're not going
[05:22.240 --> 05:26.840]  to see in four weeks. The cancer, you're not going to see in four weeks. And many of the
[05:26.840 --> 05:32.000]  neurological injuries, you won't see for four weeks if the experience with other vaccines
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.360]  is instructive. You look at the other vaccines that are currently in the schedule, there's
[05:38.360 --> 05:43.400]  about 400 injuries, illnesses, chronic illnesses that are listed.
[05:43.400 --> 05:50.120]  Robert Kennedy Jr. is just one of more than 40 powerful voices in the film COVIDland, exclusively
[05:50.120 --> 05:55.680]  available at covidland.com. And when you order it now, you get a free copy of in-game blueprint
[05:55.680 --> 06:03.560]  for global enslavement.
[06:03.560 --> 06:09.800]  It's Wednesday, September 29th. The year is 2020.
[06:09.800 --> 06:26.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show because we are under globalist attack. Make no mistake.
[06:26.800 --> 06:32.240]  You are living in incredibly historic times. It is September 29th on this Wednesday edition.
[06:32.240 --> 06:38.640]  We'll be here live for the next four hours ahead of our destroyer and the war room while
[06:38.640 --> 06:45.120]  great edition of American Journal with Harrison Smith with Dale Bigtree in studio today. That
[06:45.120 --> 06:49.760]  was amazingly informative. Be sure and check that out once it's posted to Band-Au Video,
[06:49.760 --> 06:50.760]  the full interview.
[06:50.760 --> 06:55.640]  Okay. Yesterday, I made good on the little fits I've been throwing every few weeks here
[06:55.640 --> 07:01.440]  on the air that I can't handle this anymore. I'm going to walk off the show. That was not
[07:01.440 --> 07:07.840]  theatrics. I took my ball and went home. And quite frankly, it's because I could not look
[07:07.840 --> 07:14.920]  at the governor of New York's ugly, demonic, witchlike face. I do this too much, but at
[07:14.920 --> 07:18.920]  the same time, it's unhealthy not to fight the globalist, but it's also unhealthy to
[07:18.920 --> 07:24.760]  spend too much time on them. I get it. I don't want to sit here and talk about all the evil,
[07:24.760 --> 07:27.720]  horrible stuff they're doing. I don't want to read articles all day about how they're
[07:27.720 --> 07:32.240]  legalizing pedophilia. I don't want to read articles all day how they're censoring everybody
[07:32.240 --> 07:38.520]  towards the medical tyranny to literally depopulate us. I don't want to have to cover all this.
[07:38.520 --> 07:40.520]  And I know a lot of you don't want to have to sit there and listen to it, but you know
[07:40.520 --> 07:44.320]  what? This is for people that want to be aware and people that want to have their head out
[07:44.320 --> 07:50.000]  of the sand. And I'm taking a vacation coming about a week and a half for a few days. And
[07:50.000 --> 07:55.520]  I'm going to, I think 100% just turn off the computer and unplug from everything because
[07:55.520 --> 08:00.560]  you got to do that in any war. You will go crazy. But I thank you all for your prayers.
[08:00.560 --> 08:05.040]  I thank you all for your support. And I apologize that I walked off the middle of the show.
[08:05.040 --> 08:09.800]  But I did say air the Dr. Bartlett interview. It's one of the leading doctors and scientists
[08:09.800 --> 08:13.080]  out there exposing this tyranny. And a lot of people really liked that interview because
[08:13.080 --> 08:17.960]  it had been on a Sunday and some folks don't tune into the Sunday show. They tune into
[08:17.960 --> 08:25.880]  the weekday show. So people really liked that interview from a few weeks ago. So all's
[08:25.880 --> 08:33.040]  well that ends well as they say. But if you are a TV viewer, you can see all of these
[08:33.040 --> 08:40.320]  articles that lay out in front of me. And every one of these, again, you could spend
[08:40.320 --> 08:44.080]  a lot of time on to really flesh out, but that's the problem it's impossible to do.
[08:44.080 --> 08:48.480]  So let me just tell you what we are going to be covering today. And one way or the other,
[08:48.480 --> 08:54.520]  I'm going to carry this information forward to the public. So let's just go over it. Russian
[08:54.520 --> 08:59.200]  foreign ministry denounces aggression that aims to silence RT after YouTube bans two
[08:59.200 --> 09:06.000]  German language channels for talking about natural immunity existing. That's like saying
[09:06.000 --> 09:14.560]  RT is banned for saying birds fly in the sky or grass is green. And we've got new announcements
[09:14.560 --> 09:19.960]  by YouTube on that front. Germany's Merkel says that the censorship is problematic, so
[09:19.960 --> 09:25.160]  has China's Xi Jinping. Even the dictators get that they're being moved aside by big
[09:25.160 --> 09:30.240]  tech. And here's the new announcements by YouTube. No discussion period of vaccines unless it's
[09:30.240 --> 09:38.240]  positive, not just COVID, but any vaccine is now banned by AI control. Meanwhile, DeSantis
[09:38.240 --> 09:42.760]  orders investigation of Facebook censorship and its protection of certain elite five plus
[09:42.760 --> 09:46.800]  million people that are allowed to do things with the rest can't. That's how you take over
[09:46.800 --> 09:53.760]  society, turning on Zuck leftist tech press calls for release of the Facebook files. This
[09:53.760 --> 09:58.120]  is really huge news. It's the first thing I want to hit next segment after I've told
[09:58.120 --> 10:04.360]  you what's coming up today. Another big national poll. And I've seen these polls and how they
[10:04.360 --> 10:07.440]  conduct them. The numbers are much higher than this, but the majority of America is
[10:07.440 --> 10:12.720]  longer trust the government or the COVID vaccines as you shouldn't. They're not even vaccines.
[10:12.720 --> 10:20.040]  That is coming up. Continuing. I'm going to tie it into this report because now it's
[10:20.040 --> 10:25.200]  being rolled out. Interim operational considerations for implementing the shielding approach to
[10:25.200 --> 10:30.560]  prevent COVID-19 infections in humanitarian settings. This was proposed. It's being rolled
[10:30.560 --> 10:35.440]  out around the world by the UN. This is the same operation you see in Australia. Locking
[10:35.440 --> 10:39.640]  you in your neighborhoods and your houses and then taking your children away to a government
[10:39.640 --> 10:46.160]  facility even though you're not sick for their protection. Do you think it's bad to be taken
[10:46.160 --> 10:52.000]  away because you have COVID or they say you do with a fraud machine, a PCR test they still
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.480]  use. How about we're taking you to a camp for your safety and don't worry, you've got
[10:56.480 --> 11:01.720]  to work in the camp. They're going to collapse society, collapse the jobs, collapse the infrastructure
[11:01.720 --> 11:06.400]  with the ongoing lockdowns and soft lockdowns with one employee gets COVID so the whole
[11:06.400 --> 11:12.160]  factory shuts down, the whole business shuts down. Now what's happening is that's causing
[11:12.160 --> 11:16.640]  the breakdown of society and commodities are running out, stables are running out and that's
[11:16.640 --> 11:21.960]  going to then cause the breakdown of society. Don't worry, we've got emergency dormitories
[11:21.960 --> 11:27.440]  you can come live in. They're going to nationalize a lot of the big apartment buildings and others
[11:27.440 --> 11:30.880]  and again, turn them into government facilities. That's what you see with the CDC. That's the
[11:30.880 --> 11:36.080]  whole plan. I'm going to get into that. That ties into this incredible stack I've got over
[11:36.080 --> 11:41.000]  here. Media group wants journalists to legally protect it from online comments. There is
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.880]  a piece of legislation that will ban any criticism of government or mainstream media or vaccines
[11:45.880 --> 11:50.680]  or anything else that matter in live time using AI and now a major national media group
[11:50.680 --> 11:55.200]  in Canada says they want it passed so that no one be allowed to criticize them and it
[11:55.200 --> 12:02.680]  be a crime hustled by years in prison to criticize the corporate lapdog media. That ties into
[12:02.680 --> 12:07.200]  this story out of the Ottawa citizen. Military leaders saw a pandemic as unique opportunity
[12:07.200 --> 12:12.480]  to test propaganda techniques on Canadians. Forces report says engaged in disinformation
[12:12.480 --> 12:16.120]  and propaganda rum of the military against the people as if they were a foreign enemy
[12:16.120 --> 12:20.920]  and now the final leg of it is to openly announce you're under a military dictatorship. That
[12:20.920 --> 12:26.240]  ties into this from the federalist. Obama era intelligence officials tried to classify
[12:26.240 --> 12:31.000]  journalists and WikiLeaks as information brokers to surveil them, arrest them and even imprison
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.800]  them or assassinate them including yours truly. Lynn Reanwall is writing about it. Yahoo News
[12:37.800 --> 12:43.520]  is even writing about it. Kidnapping and assassination plots of the CIA to stop journalists and
[12:43.520 --> 12:48.800]  the media is endorsing this. Kidnapping, assassination and the London shootout inside the CIA secret
[12:48.800 --> 12:54.800]  war plans against WikiLeaks. How the stage is killing say somebody else did it. It's
[12:54.800 --> 12:59.680]  all coming up right there. You see they've made the decision to go authoritarian. The
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.960]  big corporations, the big banks can sit back in their Swiss armored fortresses and their
[13:04.960 --> 13:10.960]  Hawaiian armored mountaintop fortresses. While they have the politicians, the front people
[13:10.960 --> 13:15.600]  carry out martial law. Then that'll cause violent revolutions that break down society
[13:15.600 --> 13:21.680]  further, collapsing currencies. Then they come in and buy it off a piece of the dollar.
[13:21.680 --> 13:25.200]  We either wake up to this or it's over. This is the biggest assault. This is the fabled
[13:25.200 --> 13:29.800]  new world order. This is the dehumanization. This is the depopulation. This is the medical
[13:29.800 --> 13:41.120]  tyranny. This is everything. That's just some of the stacks on that front. Then woman boiling
[13:41.120 --> 13:47.240]  bear urine as part of a ritual was a big environmentalist. I believe the earth was overpopulated.
[13:47.240 --> 13:52.400]  Police have charged her with setting the fires that were claimed to have been caused by global
[13:52.400 --> 13:58.880]  warming. Now the media is trying to suppress the fact that she was a radical environmental
[13:58.880 --> 14:03.840]  extinctionist wacko lunatic. Hell, they've got New Yorker magazine calling for burning
[14:03.840 --> 14:10.600]  everything down. That'll stop the earth from burning. I also said I'd hit this yesterday,
[14:10.600 --> 14:15.200]  but I didn't. It's very important. Court precedents appear to back by the national coronavirus
[14:15.200 --> 14:21.160]  vaccine order. Legal experts say that's hard pen to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, everywhere.
[14:21.160 --> 14:25.800]  They lie. I'm going to show you the history and what the precedents really say. And yes,
[14:25.800 --> 14:29.040]  the precedents say you can sterilize black people and poor white people. And the same
[14:29.040 --> 14:34.920]  court rulings say that you can be put in a camp. Those precedents were overturned after
[14:34.920 --> 14:41.320]  World War II, but they're saying they have those precedents yet again. And all over the
[14:41.320 --> 14:45.440]  country, the federal government's spending billions on teaching in elementary, middle
[14:45.440 --> 14:53.840]  school, high school and college. The racism pyramid, when you deny you're racist, that's
[14:53.840 --> 14:59.040]  racist. When you say black people can be racist, that's racist. School doesn't reportedly
[14:59.040 --> 15:04.320]  hire a consultant to teach the privilege pie, a chart, a pyramid of white supremacy. Soldiers
[15:04.320 --> 15:11.200]  mark system be a race based systems. That's all coming up. Oh, but the politicians aren't
[15:11.200 --> 15:14.840]  in trouble. Congress passed a law 10 years ago. They can insider trade. And now more
[15:14.840 --> 15:20.760]  than 130 federal judges broke the law by hearing cases involving their own financial interest.
[15:20.760 --> 15:28.240]  But that's all part of the ongoing corruption. Russell Brand says Russia gave us a democratic
[15:28.240 --> 15:34.080]  conspiracy driven by the Clintons. He doesn't say that. It's come out. The FBI has indicted
[15:34.080 --> 15:41.400]  Hillary's operatives for doing it, but that's a daily dollar short. And so much more today.
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.560]  They have not even scratched the surface. They're now arresting Americans for criticizing
[15:46.560 --> 15:52.240]  Biden and for criticizing the lockdown. After all, Biden in June listed people protesting
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.920]  lockdowns as terrorists. They're coming for everybody, folks. If you're concerned about
[15:57.920 --> 16:02.560]  the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off grid electricity, this will
[16:02.560 --> 16:07.680]  be the most important message you'll hear this year. Here's why. We now have a small
[16:07.680 --> 16:12.800]  number of solar generators back in stock. These emergency backup systems provide life
[16:12.800 --> 16:17.920]  saving backup power when you need it most. And unlike gas generators, solar generators
[16:17.920 --> 16:23.520]  run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity
[16:23.520 --> 16:28.440]  from the sun. Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues or just getting
[16:28.440 --> 16:33.480]  off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again. Even
[16:33.480 --> 16:39.480]  better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off the grid bonuses too.

[17:59.040 --> 18:04.920]  General Lee, it's General Milley. I just want you to know that Trump tried to overthrow
[18:04.920 --> 18:09.680]  the U.S. government two days ago on January 6th and I just want you to know I've taken
[18:09.680 --> 18:13.280]  control of the nuclear weapons and if Trump tries to launch an attack on you, we'll let
[18:13.280 --> 18:16.280]  you know first the attack's coming.
[18:16.280 --> 18:22.000]  That is from the transcript. Then he called Pelosi, Schumer, and others to say, I'm loyal
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.440]  to you. I'm going to protect Trump from using the
[18:24.440 --> 18:28.480]  clear weapons. But Trump was going for detente with China and North Korea at the time and
[18:28.480 --> 18:32.360]  Trump's responding saying it's a total lie. Pelosi's come out and admitted it happened.
[18:32.360 --> 18:37.400]  Hell, she bragged back on January 8th that it took place then and is saying that she
[18:37.400 --> 18:41.400]  honors Milley and that he's this courageous person, so are all these other Democrats.
[18:41.400 --> 18:45.640]  So this is the permanent deep state coup that's been in control for a long time. Now, coming
[18:45.640 --> 18:50.600]  out of the shadows, publicly. Remember, these people literally hate you and your family.
[18:50.600 --> 18:57.680]  Now they're injecting you with poison, soft-killed injections. Wake up America or be destroyed.
[18:57.680 --> 19:02.120]  By now, you've heard me talk about the bioproducts and how they're creating amazing products.

[20:01.360 --> 20:22.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. There has been a massive development, an extremely
[20:22.960 --> 20:28.600]  positive development when it comes to nation states and individual liberty and freedom
[20:28.600 --> 20:34.320]  on this planet that I'm going to discuss right now, but I want to be very clear to the listeners
[20:34.320 --> 20:40.640]  who are faithfully tuned into the Alex Jones show. If I wanted to make this broadcast entertaining,
[20:40.640 --> 20:45.360]  I can play you 50 clips of leftist acting like total psychotic lunatics. We can laugh
[20:45.360 --> 20:50.960]  at them and it's fun and it gets tons of views and the show is popular and we make money
[20:50.960 --> 20:57.640]  and everything's happy until we collapse. I don't do that except when I'm making a point
[20:57.640 --> 21:03.520]  because we have hard core issues to cover of life and death and so I could hit a million
[21:03.520 --> 21:10.320]  different talk radio right wing topics that are all important, but if you don't hit the
[21:10.320 --> 21:17.000]  central issue, the so-called leaders that aren't leaders are never going to get what's
[21:17.000 --> 21:21.080]  going on. The public's not going to get what's going on and we're going to lose. So before
[21:21.080 --> 21:30.160]  I hit this huge story that fits into this, I want to just be crystal clear. Rand Paul,
[21:30.160 --> 21:46.760]  Josh Holly, Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton, Jim Jordan, all these people, Devin Nunes, Steve Scalise,
[21:46.760 --> 21:53.400]  they're all good, smart, hardworking men who are blessed to have, but I watch them making
[21:53.400 --> 22:02.120]  political points on Russiagate being proven to be a fraud or, you know, oh my gosh, old
[22:02.120 --> 22:08.360]  issues. We've already won the fights on those. People know the truth. Instead of addressing
[22:08.360 --> 22:14.360]  global corporate government censoring the government, surveilling everyone, rigging
[22:14.360 --> 22:21.000]  the economy and working with big pharma and big banks that big tech was financed by to
[22:21.000 --> 22:26.280]  censor even governments of the world of what they can say and what they can do and forcing
[22:26.280 --> 22:33.880]  everyone under AI surveillance to in live time censor what we can do. I told everybody
[22:33.880 --> 22:40.520]  months before the election, I said by the election Trump will win the red mirage, then
[22:40.520 --> 22:46.640]  they'll say he loses a few days later, then they'll take Trump off the internet. A selective
[22:46.640 --> 22:52.400]  internet kill switch. I specifically said that word for word on every show, just like
[22:52.400 --> 22:57.040]  I'm telling you this on every show. Why do you think they wanted me off air? Why am I
[22:57.040 --> 23:00.360]  their number one enemy? Because I actually know how they work. I spend all my time on
[23:00.360 --> 23:05.120]  what they're up to. It wasn't hard to see them slowly censoring starting four years
[23:05.120 --> 23:11.160]  ago. But even if you slowly censor, pretty soon, even if you slowly drink a glass of
[23:11.160 --> 23:16.320]  water, pretty soon you're at the bottom of the glass. You're shippin' on a bottle of
[23:16.320 --> 23:24.320]  whiskey in a couple weeks, it's already gone. Well, it's the same thing here. So they took
[23:24.320 --> 23:28.200]  Trump off Google. They took Trump off Twitter. They took him off Facebook. Facebook won't
[23:28.200 --> 23:32.960]  let him quote be on there. He gives these big rallies around the country. It's blocked
[23:32.960 --> 23:39.040]  out. Mainstream TV doesn't pick it up. It's old dinosaur media working with big tech
[23:39.040 --> 23:42.680]  that's owned by the big banks that owns Big Pharma. And Big Pharma is their system to
[23:42.680 --> 23:49.800]  assault us and to depopulate us, to sterilize us. They all go together. And so before they
[23:49.800 --> 23:53.480]  launched COVID-19 on us, they got control of all the major health departments in the
[23:53.480 --> 24:01.680]  world except a few, like Russia and India, where they had partial control of. And they
[24:01.680 --> 24:07.680]  came in and they put out the lie that didn't come out of the Wuhan lab. They put out all
[24:07.680 --> 24:13.680]  those lies. They sold all that propaganda. And when people tried to speak out against
[24:13.680 --> 24:18.920]  it, prominent doctors, prominent scientists, the heads of their fields, Nobel Prize winners,
[24:18.920 --> 24:23.160]  they were universally censored and blocked out and blacked out. So that made them get
[24:23.160 --> 24:26.720]  more angry, made them do symposiums, made them start doing talk radio interviews, made
[24:26.720 --> 24:30.040]  them seek out every show they could get on because they were following the Hippocratic
[24:30.040 --> 24:34.680]  of. They understood how diabolical this was. They understood that Joseph Mengele had been
[24:34.680 --> 24:45.480]  resurrected in Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates. And so now Google announced today, today, all
[24:45.480 --> 24:50.880]  discussion of vaccines that's negative, any vaccine will be banned. So this is how you
[24:50.880 --> 24:57.280]  conquer the consumer advocates. It's how you conquer individuals that are going to criticize
[24:57.280 --> 25:03.080]  gas tanks that blow up in a car. Any of that is big tech AI and what it can do for corporations
[25:03.080 --> 25:07.320]  and what it can do for the media. It can shut down all the old media's competition, keep
[25:07.320 --> 25:11.400]  them relevant. It can shut down everybody that criticizes a new drug that's experimental
[25:11.400 --> 25:20.600]  force in the public. And then even Senator Paul a month ago did a floor speech where
[25:20.600 --> 25:27.880]  he talked about natural immunity and Israeli study 13 to 27 times better. And they deleted
[25:27.880 --> 25:32.720]  that speech off his YouTube and said, you can't do it. Do it again. You'll be banned.
[25:32.720 --> 25:38.520]  He went on Newsmax. He won a few shows that complained, but didn't introduce legislation.
[25:38.520 --> 25:44.360]  Didn't say this is criminal. Didn't say this is an act of war. Just took it. And they've
[25:44.360 --> 25:49.160]  had Senate hearings with medical doctors and scientists about the fact that this isn't a
[25:49.160 --> 25:53.280]  vaccine and it doesn't protect you. So they knew when they brought this forward, it would
[25:53.280 --> 25:58.280]  give you cancer and heart attacks and brain aneurysms. They knew it wouldn't work. They
[25:58.280 --> 26:03.440]  knew it would put blood clots in your lungs. It was in the literature. And they premeditatedly
[26:03.440 --> 26:10.200]  are testing to see if they can kill millions of people with these poison shots. And they
[26:10.200 --> 26:14.920]  get away with that. It's going to be billions. That's why they tell you, oh, we're reformulating
[26:14.920 --> 26:20.480]  new boosters for you. And suddenly the head of Pfizer is like our doctor and he's on TV.
[26:20.480 --> 26:26.080]  Oh, what do you think of the CDC and FDA top boards that are statutory under the law
[26:26.080 --> 26:31.280]  that their directives be followed by those agencies? What do you think of them bypassing
[26:31.280 --> 26:34.520]  and saying, we don't care about our boards saying no more boosters and don't give it
[26:34.520 --> 26:39.840]  to kids and it doesn't work? He said, oh, I think it's very good. He said, very good.
[26:39.840 --> 26:47.360]  That's the quote. You wake up. Oh, I'm sorry. You're a college top golf player going to the
[26:47.360 --> 26:52.520]  championship. You took the second Pfizer shot and microcarditis. Heart swelling. The doctor
[26:52.520 --> 26:56.840]  says the vaccine caused it. The insert says it can cause it. You didn't lie, but it still
[26:56.840 --> 27:02.080]  scares people. The UN told Yahoo. We're in charge of what's allowed on TikTok. So his
[27:02.080 --> 27:06.600]  video with four and a half million views was taken down. See, just like that. It's corporations
[27:06.600 --> 27:13.640]  that set up the UN, select global corporations that set up the IMF, the World Bank, WTO.
[27:13.640 --> 27:20.360]  And we're now under it. And where is even Trump on this? He got us out of the UN UNESCO.
[27:20.360 --> 27:24.520]  He got us out of some of the treaties. He did the best job anybody's done. Comparing Trump
[27:24.520 --> 27:32.320]  now to Rand Paul and the rest of them, he's a 90. They're a five. I mean, they're doing
[27:32.320 --> 27:37.160]  nothing. They're not addressing what we're under. What's happening? A corporate global
[27:37.160 --> 27:42.520]  government takeover. Well, guess who is addressing it? We'll cover when we come back. Russian
[27:42.520 --> 27:48.800]  foreign ministry denounces aggression that aims to silence RT after YouTube bans two
[27:48.800 --> 27:55.480]  German language channels that had scientists on talking about natural immunity and how
[27:55.480 --> 28:02.280]  it's better learned immunity from coming exposed to something is far better than the
[28:02.280 --> 28:09.440]  quote vaccine. The vaccine's efficacy in countries like Israel has waned to 39%. That's what
[28:09.440 --> 28:15.680]  they censored. Totally true. Absolute fact that would defeat their giant global government
[28:15.680 --> 28:23.680]  rollout world ID contact tracer vaccine passport carbon passport system. It's that simple.
[28:23.680 --> 28:28.480]  This is the new war. This is the takeover. And Russia said this is information warfare.
[28:28.480 --> 28:33.000]  This is information aggression. You're censoring something. People are having medical information.
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.280]  What you're doing is criminal. You work for big pharma. They've all merged with each other.
[28:37.280 --> 28:42.240]  So they have financial interest at Google. They've merged. So has Facebook. And then
[28:42.240 --> 28:46.400]  they're suppressing you while they kill you with a poison drug they're pushing on you.
[28:46.400 --> 28:51.520]  They're a damn depopulation 12 monkey cult that might as well have bombers in the air
[28:51.520 --> 28:58.400]  dropping 10,000 pound bombs on us. They're murdering us. They are murderers. Hey, everybody.
[28:58.400 --> 29:03.200]  Used about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture. Me too. But listen, after all the
[29:03.200 --> 29:07.640]  research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost
[29:07.640 --> 29:12.400]  everyone agrees on. It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between
[29:12.400 --> 29:17.240]  life and death. You probably already believe that. I certainly do. So here's the thing.
[29:17.240 --> 29:21.840]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually
[29:21.840 --> 29:27.120]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support. Now you'll have to sign
[29:27.120 --> 29:32.000]  a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefense.com. No curious

[30:33.000 --> 30:40.000]  where we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that

[31:03.400 --> 31:08.440]  And now the world is waking up that info wars was the tip of the spear was dead on. That's
[31:08.440 --> 31:12.080]  why it's more important than ever to keep us on air. And I thank you all for your support,

[31:56.920 --> 32:03.080]  Please take action. The world is awakening. The world is beginning to understand the globalist
[32:03.080 --> 32:08.800]  paradigm. They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the
[32:08.800 --> 32:15.280]  trilateral commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome. And
[32:15.280 --> 32:20.640]  so even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come
[32:20.640 --> 32:26.640]  out of the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing. We have forced them
[32:26.640 --> 32:31.360]  out in the open. So as bad as these times are, a lot of negative things are about to
[32:31.360 --> 32:36.920]  happen. Realize humanity is winning. You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust
[32:36.920 --> 32:43.880]  in the plan of God's justice. That is invincible. That is ethereal, timeless and unstoppable.
[32:43.880 --> 32:48.760]  So don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action
[32:48.760 --> 32:52.720]  against the globalist and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew
[32:52.720 --> 33:01.280]  to you. We will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender.
[33:01.280 --> 33:19.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:19.680 --> 33:26.280]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[33:26.280 --> 33:36.720]  so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:36.720 --> 33:40.320]  You read about World War II. You read about the Communist occupation of so many countries
[33:40.320 --> 33:45.280]  in the world. You ask, why would leaders want to get control and enslave and kill and rape
[33:45.280 --> 33:51.200]  because they like to do it? The history of the world is war and conquest and death. And
[33:51.200 --> 33:56.240]  then there's very rare times where good men stand up and say, no, let's empower humanity.
[33:56.240 --> 34:03.520]  Let's believe in art and literature and culture and let's protect the innocent and the weak.
[34:03.520 --> 34:08.280]  And those cultures always create golden ages until they become corrupt, they become decadent
[34:08.280 --> 34:14.000]  and they end up falling to corruption. And next segment, I'm going to just fill the
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.440]  segment. I love to talk, but I'm going to fill the segment with some really positive
[34:17.440 --> 34:27.040]  news next segment. We have the daughter of Ontario's premier Doug Ford. He's the guy
[34:27.040 --> 34:30.920]  announcing basically martial law up there that's so unpopular. She's come out against
[34:30.920 --> 34:37.000]  her own father. Also, he's on the treadmill and just talks about what a monster he is
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.520]  and how this is the new world order and how it's never going to end and how you've got
[34:40.520 --> 34:46.960]  to stop it. Then we've got Orlando magic, Jonathan Isaac says he isn't getting the COVID
[34:46.960 --> 34:52.360]  vaccine because he has natural immunity. Oh, that'll be censored. And Washington Wizards
[34:52.360 --> 34:59.360]  star Bradley Beal drops massive red bills. Oh, and then I've got the Johnson and Johnson
[34:59.360 --> 35:03.960]  employees from Roger Veritas saying 200,000 have really died from the so-called vaccines.
[35:03.960 --> 35:10.240]  They don't work and children shouldn't take them their experimental. So see, that's people
[35:10.240 --> 35:14.400]  finding their souls. Sure, Veritas, they don't know they're being videotaped, but they're
[35:14.400 --> 35:20.800]  saying it's wrong. And they're high level. These corporations hire young trendy says
[35:20.800 --> 35:23.680]  they'll do whatever they're told, but they're starting to really figure out what's going
[35:23.680 --> 35:28.040]  on. So I mean, how far will you go? Because this is a real case of tyranny. Okay, you get
[35:28.040 --> 35:32.920]  boosted on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram if you push the party line. But that means
[35:32.920 --> 35:37.800]  nothing. By the way, I thought somebody just put video to that Joe Rogan minute and a half,
[35:37.800 --> 35:42.720]  super powerful rant he did about this is Nazi Germany, a world ID to control you. This is
[35:42.720 --> 35:50.480]  absolutely about enslavement. You better resist the vaccine passport. And then I realized
[35:50.480 --> 35:54.600]  Joe put that out himself. He produced that and put it out on his Instagram. Last time
[35:54.600 --> 36:00.000]  I checked, it's got like 7 million views. It's good to have Joe fully awake now. I'll
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.800]  just leave it at that. I told everybody about a year ago when he moved Austin, I said he's
[36:03.800 --> 36:07.400]  already woken up. He's getting a position to do what he wants. He's finally empowered.
[36:07.400 --> 36:13.040]  And the version I saw said 7 million. I guess that's a different version. 5.5 million put
[36:13.040 --> 36:18.000]  out a day and a half ago. We got to play that again. You know what? That's part of the solution.
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.400]  We'll play that minute and a half first when we come out of the next segment. And then we'll
[36:23.400 --> 36:33.080]  play the daughter of the premier in the most populous province of Canada saying it's pure
[36:33.080 --> 36:40.720]  new water takeover. You got to get out of it now. And then we'll play the basketball players.
[36:40.720 --> 36:46.320]  But this is what they're trying to censor. So in comes the Russians. Russia's paying
[36:46.320 --> 36:52.440]  people to have children. You get bigger bonuses as you go up. You have four children. Your
[36:52.440 --> 36:56.960]  tax exempt for life, basically, depending on the policy. It's different ones. China just
[36:56.960 --> 37:01.880]  said, hey, we're going to be like Russia. We're going to pay you to have three kids.
[37:01.880 --> 37:04.600]  And by the way, we'll arrest you if you're a homosexual. I'm not saying do that, but
[37:04.600 --> 37:10.160]  that's how far they've gone. China finances all this Hollywood anti-American crap, but
[37:10.160 --> 37:15.720]  they don't allow it there. Because they know that's the sign of collapse of society. Well,
[37:15.720 --> 37:18.640]  Russia's not doing any of that stuff. And that's why they're under attack. They're
[37:18.640 --> 37:21.800]  Christian. They're nationalists. They've cut their defense spending. They say organic
[37:21.800 --> 37:26.560]  food to the world is their goal and family health. They said everything is family and
[37:26.560 --> 37:30.920]  God. And Putin said if a country doesn't have God, they will be ruled by the devil. I mean,
[37:30.920 --> 37:35.480]  he's come out and said that. You never see it on our news. Putin was a secret Christian
[37:35.480 --> 37:44.880]  even when he was in the KGB. So that's what's going on. So what did, what did they do? What
[37:44.880 --> 37:50.680]  did they come out and say? Well, the article's up on infowars.com. Russia's foreign ministry
[37:50.680 --> 37:56.440]  denounces aggression that aims to silence RT after YouTube bans two of their German channels
[37:56.440 --> 38:01.600]  that are some of the top channels in Germany, by the way, the Google on video platform deleted
[38:01.600 --> 38:11.640]  RT, Deutsch and Dr. RT channels on Tuesday, saying they attempted to circumvent a community
[38:11.640 --> 38:16.760]  guideline strike for medical misinformation, saying that natural immunity is better, saying
[38:16.760 --> 38:24.240]  the sky's blue. Also on RT, YouTube, delete two channels of RT sister project, RT, Deutsch,
[38:24.240 --> 38:29.160]  and it goes on from there, describing the move as an act of unprecedented information
[38:29.160 --> 38:35.480]  aggression, information warfare, an obvious manifestation of censorship and suppression
[38:35.480 --> 38:40.720]  of freedom of expression. The foreign ministry in Moscow said YouTube acted with obvious
[38:40.720 --> 38:50.600]  conveyance, if not at the insistence of German authorities while hoping that Tuesday's action
[38:50.600 --> 38:59.240]  isn't a media version of Barbarossa, that's the Hitler's invasion of Russia. The code
[38:59.240 --> 39:03.960]  name given to the Nazi Germany 41 invasions of a union, Moscow said it was particularly
[39:03.960 --> 39:08.760]  cynical considering September 28 is the UN designated International Day for universal
[39:08.760 --> 39:14.040]  access to information. The UN violates everything it says. The ministry pointed out that Germany
[39:14.040 --> 39:18.880]  has subjected the Russian broadcaster to many years of harassment, including blocking bank
[39:18.880 --> 39:23.600]  accounts, defamation, and more. As of the purpose of the aggressive act was to silence
[39:23.600 --> 39:28.320]  the source of information that do not fit the media landscape of German officialdom,
[39:28.320 --> 39:33.400]  it's comparable with. It's bigger than that. It's worldwide. It's big tech merging with
[39:33.400 --> 39:37.920]  big pharma in business. Google's one of the biggest owners of pharmaceutical stock and
[39:37.920 --> 39:45.360]  the vaccine along with Facebook. So again, it is criminal activity. And by the way, the
[39:45.360 --> 39:53.160]  head of YouTube, her sister, is heavily invested and is one of the top advisors and brokers
[39:53.160 --> 39:58.880]  on not one but three major pharmaceutical companies bringing you mRNA. So these are just ruthless
[39:58.880 --> 40:03.600]  evil corporations silencing their prey. They are the equivalent of Osama bin Laden with
[40:03.600 --> 40:09.640]  a wig. I mean, these people know what they're doing. They're transhumanists. They're pro-exterminationists.
[40:09.640 --> 40:15.880]  They hate everybody. They surveil everyone. They censor you. And now in our team, we have
[40:15.880 --> 40:19.560]  an article on forewars.com with the videos that were deleted. In fact, I want to find
[40:19.560 --> 40:22.800]  those videos because they're linked on the side. I want them uploaded to Band-Aught Video.
[40:22.800 --> 40:26.720]  Don't care if they're in German. We have a band section of Band-Aught Video that is
[40:26.720 --> 40:30.640]  the most banned videos of stuff YouTube takes down. That's our main mission there is to
[40:30.640 --> 40:35.880]  post stuff that is being censored. But the videos in question were medical doctors explaining
[40:35.880 --> 40:41.680]  that natural immunity is key. Now, remember, that's what Rand Paul got censored for. Imagine
[40:41.680 --> 40:47.720]  a medical doctor giving a speech in the Senate. He could have been up there reading out of
[40:47.720 --> 40:52.120]  the alphabet or reading out of the encyclopedia. He should be able to do it. But no, he was
[40:52.120 --> 40:57.080]  right. That's what they censored. And so if our government is censored by something,
[40:57.080 --> 41:00.360]  what does that tell you? I don't want the government censoring me. They shouldn't be
[41:00.360 --> 41:05.320]  able to do that. So why can YouTube? Well, it's not, quote, a private company in that
[41:05.320 --> 41:10.560]  it is a utility. And that's how they've had their immunity is that they're supposedly
[41:10.560 --> 41:15.840]  only supposed to block things that are illegal. Not, oh, we're owned by pharmaceutical companies
[41:15.840 --> 41:19.760]  now or we've merged with pharmaceutical companies now. And so we're not going to let you criticize
[41:19.760 --> 41:23.720]  our drugs or our products. And I don't care if you're in the U.S. Senate or you're a former
[41:23.720 --> 41:29.120]  president, you can't do that. And that's how YouTube does it. They put all the negative
[41:29.120 --> 41:32.840]  Trump news up top when you search his name. You search Alex Jones. It's all the negative
[41:32.840 --> 41:38.120]  stuff from three, four years ago. They basically steal your identity and only put out what
[41:38.120 --> 41:44.440]  they want about you until you're another person in cyberspace that exists in the real world.
[41:44.440 --> 41:51.120]  It's information management. It's the threat of our lifetimes. It's taking over now and
[41:51.120 --> 41:54.920]  it's trying to deny us medical treatments to protect ourselves. It's trying to deny us
[41:54.920 --> 41:59.480]  truth about a vaccine that isn't a vaccine and doesn't work. These people need to be
[41:59.480 --> 42:03.640]  charged with terrorism. They need to be charged with every form of racketeering and criminal
[42:03.640 --> 42:08.520]  activity under the sun and they need to be put in prison for life. The head of YouTube,
[42:08.520 --> 42:14.200]  the CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, all of them, their major shareholders that are involved
[42:14.200 --> 42:18.160]  in this need to come out and decry it and say it's wrong or they need to be indicted.
[42:18.160 --> 42:24.160]  They need to be incarcerated. They need to be tried and they need to be in prison because
[42:24.160 --> 42:28.800]  this is 21st century war. Instead, they declared the whole COVID hysteria, global lockdown
[42:28.800 --> 42:33.360]  and are locking us up in our houses and telling us we've got to carry prisoner passes to go
[42:33.360 --> 42:37.800]  around. We've got to put things they say in our bodies whenever they want to kill us
[42:37.800 --> 42:43.640]  or they'll take away our right to be outside the prison. Their smart cities are smart prisons.
[42:43.640 --> 42:47.760]  I told you that decades ago. I told you about the prison planet. I made the film in-game
[42:47.760 --> 42:52.760]  and now it's all here. Let's play clips of people fighting back from Joe Rogan to the
[42:52.760 --> 42:58.840]  Premier of Canada's daughter. Stay with us. If you think the tyranny and oppression we're
[42:58.840 --> 43:04.600]  living under now is bad, wait till they've got their world ID and that's exactly what
[43:04.600 --> 43:10.240]  the COVID passports are all about. And Klaus Schwab and the UN and all the other globalist
[43:10.240 --> 43:15.960]  leaders own words they admit that once they've got you with that system then they're going
[43:15.960 --> 43:21.200]  to carbon tax you everywhere you go and track what you do and publicly they're saying they're
[43:21.200 --> 43:26.720]  going to decide when you can travel and when you can't travel and MasterCard and all the
[43:26.720 --> 43:30.840]  other big companies are currently announcing they're going to track what you do and where
[43:30.840 --> 43:37.000]  you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it. This is the holy grail of tyranny ladies and
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.800]  gentlemen. This is the takeover in humanity. Better wake up and say no. Finally folks are
[43:41.800 --> 43:45.560]  starting to wake up. Joe Rogan took her girls and others to leave the charge along with
[43:45.560 --> 43:50.600]  info wars but it's not enough. Every individual has to not comply and we have to talk about
[43:50.600 --> 43:54.880]  bringing the globalist to justice. You see they need the fear of God put in them legally
[43:54.880 --> 44:01.840]  and lawfully. I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul. I've
[44:01.840 --> 44:08.680]  ever had in my 47 years on this planet I've had a lot of loss. Everybody else has. And
[44:08.680 --> 44:19.120]  it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled
[44:19.120 --> 44:26.200]  and sweat for. And now we're just throwing it all away. And I see the general public
[44:26.200 --> 44:32.600]  in a medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled. Franchi.
[44:32.600 --> 44:38.480]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad.
[44:38.480 --> 44:45.600]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[44:45.600 --> 44:50.880]  and collapsing and then coming back to life again. It's just the globalist are actively
[44:50.880 --> 44:55.360]  trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the
[44:55.360 --> 45:01.040]  species as we know it. And in addition we were really finding that we were stressing the
[45:01.040 --> 45:05.720]  cardiopulmonary systems of these employees because when you cover the mouth and nose
[45:05.720 --> 45:09.880]  and you exert physical energy during your work, during your tasks, whatever it might
[45:09.880 --> 45:14.040]  be, you're really stressing the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you
[45:14.040 --> 45:20.640]  breathe. You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale. That taxes the heart. It taxes the
[45:20.640 --> 45:25.520]  lungs. And we have given people heart attacks by allowing them to work with their mouth
[45:25.520 --> 45:32.440]  and nose covered with absolutely no regulation, no oversight, no medical oversight.
[45:32.440 --> 45:36.560]  The globalists have told us we're a disease. They've told us they want to eradicate us.
[45:36.560 --> 45:40.440]  And all the studies show that when you wear these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up
[45:40.440 --> 45:46.080]  to one third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning. This is a sick
[45:46.080 --> 45:50.200]  cult and we've got to say no. But the only way the real science is out of the public
[45:50.200 --> 45:56.600]  is if we tell them, get your copy today of Coventland and expose them. It's Coventland.com.
[45:56.600 --> 45:57.600]  Go there now.
[45:57.600 --> 46:03.240]  Jacob in Ohio. Welcome. Go ahead.
[46:03.240 --> 46:04.760]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[46:04.760 --> 46:05.760]  Good.
[46:05.760 --> 46:10.040]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements. It's basically
[46:10.040 --> 46:14.760]  the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization and absurdity.
[46:14.760 --> 46:16.920]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[46:16.920 --> 46:20.040]  All right. Eric's in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[46:20.040 --> 46:23.240]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug
[46:23.240 --> 46:27.720]  out for the part of the product. The X2 does wonders. They recommend it to everybody here
[46:27.720 --> 46:31.560]  on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the info board.
[46:31.560 --> 46:34.400]  Tyler in Maine. You're on the year. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[46:34.400 --> 46:36.840]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[46:36.840 --> 46:37.840]  Honored to talk to you.
[46:37.840 --> 46:38.840]  Awesome.
[46:38.840 --> 46:44.600]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say, I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[46:44.600 --> 46:49.440]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom. So, just number one
[46:49.440 --> 46:50.440]  for a few of you.
[46:50.440 --> 46:52.440]  I like that one. It works. It's not a joke.
[46:52.440 --> 47:14.440]  Yeah, absolutely.
[47:14.440 --> 47:19.440]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[47:19.440 --> 47:28.240]  As soon as you give politicians power, any kind of power that didn't exist previously,
[47:28.240 --> 47:34.040]  if they can figure out a way to force you into carrying something that lets you enter businesses
[47:34.040 --> 47:39.920]  or lets you do this or lets businesses open, historically, they are not going to give that
[47:39.920 --> 47:43.680]  power up. They find new reasons to use Alpha Power.
[47:43.680 --> 47:47.840]  We have to protect those freedoms at all costs, whether you agree with people's choices
[47:47.840 --> 47:53.960]  or not, because it is the foundation that this country was founded on, freedom. This
[47:53.960 --> 47:58.680]  idea of freedom, there's so many people that think it's frivolous, it's not important,
[47:58.680 --> 48:03.440]  it's not the main thing that we should be focused on, but it is the literal structure
[48:03.440 --> 48:10.520]  that allows this country to be so amazing. Every single country that's ever existed other
[48:10.520 --> 48:18.360]  than the United States, up until 1776, every fucking country that has ever existed was
[48:18.360 --> 48:23.760]  run by dictators, all of them. This is the first experiment in self-government that actually
[48:23.760 --> 48:27.760]  worked and it created the greatest superpower the world has ever known. It created the greatest
[48:27.760 --> 48:34.000]  cultural machine, the greatest machine of art and creativity and innovation right in
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.760]  here. And how did it do that? It did it through freedom.
[48:36.760 --> 48:42.440]  And as soon as you see something, anything that comes along and inhibits your freedom,
[48:42.440 --> 48:47.480]  you should be very cautious about that. You should be very suspicious, because anything
[48:47.480 --> 48:52.680]  that comes along that can inhibit your freedom is, by definition, anti-American.
[48:52.680 --> 48:57.720]  Good morning everyone, happy Tuesday as we could have all expected the liberal government
[48:57.720 --> 49:02.720]  one last night with a minority government just wasting our tax dollars like they absolutely
[49:02.720 --> 49:07.720]  love to do and stripping our freedoms away one day at a time. So just remember to go
[49:07.720 --> 49:13.160]  and fangirl liberal when we go down the numeral order. And while we're at it, a minus 12 start
[49:13.160 --> 49:18.160]  talking about the CV. Does anyone question why the government does not want to release
[49:18.160 --> 49:23.960]  any of their research? Does anyone question why Israel is their study? Are finding that
[49:23.960 --> 49:30.560]  natural immunity 13 to plus times more effective than the V's. Does anyone question that or
[49:30.560 --> 49:33.560]  are you just going to wind up and get your booster shot in three months?
[49:33.560 --> 49:39.360]  Anyone do their research yesterday when I posted the New York Times independent studies that
[49:39.360 --> 49:44.000]  showed that in September of 2020, when very few people had to be in their system, that
[49:44.000 --> 49:49.600]  deaths were actually lower than in September of 2021 when apparently a very large portion
[49:49.600 --> 49:55.240]  of the global population has been doubled dose. Is anyone asking any questions? Why
[49:55.240 --> 50:00.040]  aren't we asking questions? Why are more people dying now? Is it because the strain is really
[50:00.040 --> 50:06.200]  dying, that more deadly because all of the research behind the strain shows that they're
[50:06.200 --> 50:11.200]  more contagious, but they're not as deadly.
[50:11.200 --> 50:21.200]  Guys, start asking questions. I know, I know many of my friends took their two and done,
[50:21.200 --> 50:28.200]  two and done, and I respect that. But you have to start asking questions now. Why are
[50:28.200 --> 50:34.200]  the two and done people stuck in a different country because they tested positive for CV?
[50:34.200 --> 50:41.200]  Isn't it to be supposed to preventing from getting CV in the first place? And even if
[50:41.200 --> 50:46.200]  you do test positive, what is the benefit of taking the B if you still need quarantine
[50:46.200 --> 50:52.200]  in that country because you've tested positive? Where is the benefit for the people who did
[50:52.200 --> 50:56.200]  do their two shots? They did listen to the government and now they're stuck in a different
[50:56.200 --> 51:01.200]  country because they tested positive? That puts them in a no different spot than me who
[51:01.200 --> 51:07.200]  are not following the rules of doing that. So what's the benefit? What's the benefit
[51:07.200 --> 51:16.200]  if you can't travel, if you have to test positive, you can't even come home? Ask yourself. Ask
[51:16.200 --> 51:23.200]  your family. Ask your peers these questions. Start having these questions in the workroom.
[51:23.200 --> 51:33.200]  Start having these conversations. When I posted back in May or June of last year about the
[51:33.200 --> 51:41.200]  upcoming mass mandate and to not comply, this is why I wanted people, urged people not to
[51:41.200 --> 51:47.200]  comply. We found out right away that masks weren't very effective, ineffective at all
[51:47.200 --> 51:52.200]  based on how people were wearing them and reusing them and it actually could have made
[51:52.200 --> 51:57.200]  things a lot worse for some people and are making things a lot worse for some certain age
[51:57.200 --> 52:05.200]  groups today. That was one, but we complied. We complied. We could have looked it up ourselves
[52:05.200 --> 52:10.200]  and realized that the way masks have been worn and the type of masks that have been worn
[52:10.200 --> 52:17.200]  are not effective, we could have put our folks down collectively and we didn't. And then
[52:17.200 --> 52:22.200]  you had the mass police lining up at the stores and they wouldn't let people wear their masks
[52:22.200 --> 52:27.200]  unless you said that you had an exemption because some stores didn't even honor that.
[52:27.200 --> 52:34.200]  But that was the stepping stone to the V Passport. That allowed businesses to find employees to
[52:34.200 --> 52:41.200]  stand at the door, to train employees to be mass police. And here we are today. And you
[52:41.200 --> 52:47.200]  think it's just going to be movie theaters, restaurants, gyms? That's the first step.
[52:47.200 --> 52:56.200]  That's the first step. This could be hair salons, nail salons, massage clinics. They
[52:56.200 --> 53:03.200]  are going to take it off. They are going to take it off. And we've allowed it. We can't
[53:03.200 --> 53:10.200]  blame the government. We have to blame ourselves for covering our faces. If only we did
[53:10.200 --> 53:18.200]  not cover our faces. We wouldn't be here today. But we are so compliant with what the government
[53:18.200 --> 53:24.200]  says that once they dangle a little carrot over you. And in reality we all know while we're
[53:24.200 --> 53:30.200]  bitching about this, some thin figure is going on in the background because they always want
[53:30.200 --> 53:36.200]  to distract us. But we do know what's coming on in the background. But I'm not going to
[53:36.200 --> 53:43.200]  start talking about it because why? Why? I was called crazy last year. I'm going to be
[53:43.200 --> 53:51.200]  called crazy again. And it's going to happen. So I'm just going to stop. I'm going to stop.
[53:51.200 --> 53:58.200]  And I'm just going to ask everyone to collectively wake up. It's not going to be two doses and
[53:58.200 --> 54:05.200]  done. It's going to be boosters for life. And every booster that you take is going to weaken
[54:05.200 --> 54:17.200]  your natural immunity to fight off the viruses. That's it. That's it. Just stop. Stop complying.
[54:17.200 --> 54:23.200]  Please and thank you. Thank you.
[54:23.200 --> 54:31.200]  Jonathan, Josh Robbins with the Athletic. What is it about the vaccine that makes you
[54:31.200 --> 54:40.200]  immune to get it? I would start with I've had COVID in the past. And so our understanding
[54:40.200 --> 54:47.200]  of antibodies of natural immunity has changed a great deal from the onset of the pandemic
[54:47.200 --> 54:54.200]  and is still evolving. I understand that the vaccine would help if you catch COVID and
[54:54.200 --> 54:59.200]  you'll be able to have less symptoms from contracting it. But with me having COVID in the
[54:59.200 --> 55:05.200]  past, having antibodies with my current age group and a fitness, physical fitness level,
[55:05.200 --> 55:12.200]  it's not necessarily a fear of mind. Taking the vaccine, like I said, it would decrease
[55:12.200 --> 55:18.200]  my chances of having a severe reaction. But it does open me up to the albeit rare chance
[55:18.200 --> 55:24.200]  but the possibility of having an adverse reaction to the vaccine itself. I don't believe that
[55:24.200 --> 55:31.200]  being unvaccinated means infected or being vaccinated means uninfected. You can still
[55:31.200 --> 55:39.200]  catch COVID with or without having the vaccine. I would say, honestly, the craziness of it
[55:39.200 --> 55:43.200]  all in terms of not being able to say that it should be everybody's fair choice without
[55:43.200 --> 55:51.200]  being demeaned or talked crazy to doesn't make one comfortable to do what said person
[55:51.200 --> 55:58.200]  telling them to do. Yeah, I would say that's a couple of the reasons that, you know, I
[55:58.200 --> 56:02.200]  would say I'm hesitant at this time, but at the end of the day, I don't feel that it
[56:02.200 --> 56:07.200]  is, you know, anyone's reason to come out and say, well, this is why or this is not why
[56:07.200 --> 56:11.200]  it should just be their decision and, you know, loving your neighbors, not just loving
[56:11.200 --> 56:16.200]  those that agree with you or look like you are moving the same way that you do. It's
[56:16.200 --> 56:18.200]  loving those who don't.
[56:18.200 --> 56:23.200]  Every player, every person in this world is going to make their own decision for themselves.
[56:23.200 --> 56:28.200]  I would like an explanation to, you know, people with vaccines, why are they still getting
[56:28.200 --> 56:34.200]  COVID? Is that something that we are supposed to highly be protected from? Like, it's funny
[56:34.200 --> 56:40.200]  that, oh, it reduces your chances of going to the hospital. It doesn't eliminate anybody
[56:40.200 --> 56:46.200]  from getting COVID, right? So everybody, is everybody in here vaccinated? I would assume,
[56:46.200 --> 56:50.200]  you know, so you all can still get COVID, right?
[56:50.200 --> 56:54.200]  We're less likely to die or go to the hospital.
[56:54.200 --> 57:04.200]  Okay, but you can still get COVID, right? So, and you can still pass it along with the
[57:04.200 --> 57:24.200]  VACs, right? I'm just asking the question.
[57:24.200 --> 57:28.200]  No, no, no, no.
[57:28.200 --> 57:34.200]  No, that wasn't the case. I mean, yeah, I had it, but that doesn't mean I can't get it
[57:34.200 --> 57:38.200]  again, you know? I mean, it's no different than somebody with a vaccine. Like, I can,
[57:38.200 --> 57:44.200]  yes, I developed antibodies for it, so my chances will be less likely now as well, right?
[57:44.200 --> 57:52.200]  But could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered? Could you imagine
[57:52.200 --> 57:56.200]  even going into the grocery store? Do you think they would let you in? Do you think they would
[57:56.200 --> 58:00.200]  be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't going to be shoplifting?
[58:00.200 --> 58:06.200]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little mini-mart to pay
[58:06.200 --> 58:10.200]  for your gas with a bandana on? How far do you think that would get you? Could you imagine
[58:10.200 --> 58:16.200]  as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a space alien?
[58:16.200 --> 58:23.200]  Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[58:23.200 --> 58:28.200]  The globalists are running a psychological war for Operation Humanity. Only waking up
[58:28.200 --> 58:33.200]  at the Great Reset in its tyranny will save us. And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[58:33.200 --> 58:37.200]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud and that it's dangerous and that it causes
[58:37.200 --> 58:41.200]  major medical issues and it's dehumanizing. And the film COVID Land does that. Secure
[58:41.200 --> 58:47.200]  your copy now at covidland.com and get a free copy of the in-game with your purchase.
[58:47.200 --> 58:53.200]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[58:53.200 --> 58:59.200]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[58:59.200 --> 59:03.200]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[59:03.200 --> 59:08.200]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[59:08.200 --> 59:13.200]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[59:13.200 --> 59:17.200]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[59:17.200 --> 59:23.200]  unbelievably unsettling to see. But there is only two things to do. We continue sounding
[59:23.200 --> 59:28.200]  the alarm because it's a numbers game. If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[59:28.200 --> 59:34.200]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[59:34.200 --> 59:39.200]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration,
[59:39.200 --> 59:47.200]  survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at infostore.com.
[59:49.200 --> 59:53.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:02.200 --> 1:00:08.200]  When it came to the Hunter-Biden sample that could have derailed globalist puppet Joe Biden,
[1:00:08.200 --> 1:00:10.200]  the lame stream media was there.
[1:00:39.200 --> 1:00:45.200]  After careful consideration, a system has been established that allows for Hunter-Biden to work in his profession
[1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:51.200]  within reasonable safeguards. Of course, he has the right to pursue an artistic career,
[1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:55.200]  just like any child of a president has the right to pursue a career.
[1:00:55.200 --> 1:01:00.200]  When it came to aiding and abetting a biological weapon from China funded by our own government,
[1:01:00.200 --> 1:01:02.200]  the mockingbird media was there.
[1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:08.200]  The coronavirus outbreak has led to complaints about a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment around the world.
[1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:15.200]  But in a very tribal and polarized time, where the information flow sometimes is stovepiked,
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:19.200]  where people are talking to other conspiracies or ignorant people.
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:22.200]  Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus?
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:26.200]  It's not racist at all, no, not at all. It comes from China.
[1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:33.200]  When it came to spewing out nonsense regarding vaccinated people needing to be protected from the unvaccinated,
[1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:36.200]  the drive-by media indoctrination was there.
[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:41.200]  We are both sitting here now because Anna and Sonny, at the last minute,
[1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:46.200]  we realized that they tested positive for COVID, so they have been taken off the show
[1:01:46.200 --> 1:01:49.200]  because the vice president is here now.
[1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:52.200]  A pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:06.200]  Those who peddle and promote these dangerous lies are harming the very people who are most at risk.
[1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:12.200]  And here's the latest data that confirms that we're still in a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:16.200]  This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:21.200]  And when it comes to all opposition to the New World Order narrative of the planks of the
[1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:27.200]  Communistic Technocratic Great Reset, mainstream media implantation was there.
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:32.200]  George Soros is this Democratic financier who has re-emerged in the last couple of years,
[1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:37.200]  pumping in some $40 million into campaigns this decade.
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:40.200]  For that, he's drawn a lot of the ire of conservatives.
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:43.200]  The Soros Occupied State Department.
[1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:46.200]  And Democrats George Soros.
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:51.200]  He's also a philanthropist and born in a hungry, naturalized U.S. citizen,
[1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:53.200]  well respected by many in the country.
[1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:58.200]  The theories are as numerous as they are nonsensical.
[1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:03.200]  From 5G towers and vaccines spreading coronavirus,
[1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:08.200]  to suspicions the virus was unleashed deliberately by Bill Gates.
[1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:18.200]  What that was was a protest against the overwhelming lies that the media has been pouring.
[1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:21.200]  Well, it won't lie, but you get the picture.
[1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:23.200]  A protest against mainstream media.
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:28.200]  Professor Stephen Lewandowski is a cognitive scientist.
[1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:34.200]  He studies the way people think and why they engage in conspiracy theories.
[1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:43.200]  Conspiracy theories become very attractive because they're offering psychological comfort, ironically.
[1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:47.200]  If you can assume that there is a handful of really bad people out there
[1:03:47.200 --> 1:03:50.200]  who are conspiring to do these terrible things,
[1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:55.200]  that provides you with comfort because in principle, at least, it would be controllable.
[1:03:55.200 --> 1:03:59.200]  When people are more isolated, they've got a bit more time to think.
[1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:01.200]  They've got a bit more time to worry.
[1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:09.200]  That also builds anxiety and leads people more vulnerable to these dangerous ideas being flattered out there.
[1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:10.200]  Oh!
[1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:11.200]  I think Bill Gates is behind all this.
[1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:13.200]  Oh, they think Bill Gates is behind it.
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:14.200]  I'm not saying Bill Gates is behind coronavirus.
[1:04:14.200 --> 1:04:15.200]  You can always count.
[1:04:15.200 --> 1:04:16.200]  Go ahead and turn that off for me.
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:17.200]  Thanks, guys.
[1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:18.200]  Go ahead and turn that off for me.
[1:04:18.200 --> 1:04:19.200]  Thanks a lot.
[1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:25.200]  So, the point I was getting at there was, in that piece, a lot of it's from a year ago,
[1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:30.200]  oh, we're the crazy people that think Bill Gates released it on purpose out of a lab,
[1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:37.200]  but it turns out he funded Peter Dazik with Fauci running the lab doing exactly that.
[1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:38.200]  I mean, there you are.
[1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:41.200]  So, we ought to dig up from 20 months ago where I said it's Bill Gates.
[1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:42.200]  He's the one.
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:43.200]  He's behind it.
[1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:44.200]  We have all the evidence then.
[1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:47.200]  And now it's, oh, it's Bill Gates' project at the lab that did it.
[1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:48.200]  Of course it is.
[1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:49.200]  He wants to kill you.
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:50.200]  His whole family does.
[1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:51.200]  It's who he is.
[1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:54.200]  He gives award ceremonies for depopulating African.
[1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:57.200]  Geez.
[1:04:57.200 --> 1:05:04.200]  So, the placebo that they have used, that the FDA has allowed them to use, has often been
[1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:09.720]  another vaccine, a vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile that's causing death and
[1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:11.200]  damage in its own right.
[1:05:11.200 --> 1:05:19.200]  That it's the aluminum as an adjuvant in the vaccine, a known neurotoxin, a known immunotoxin,
[1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:25.800]  a known poison in human beings that is in the supposedly inert placebo, totally inappropriate.
[1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:27.560]  This is not good science.
[1:05:27.560 --> 1:05:30.080]  It is not science at all.
[1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:35.240]  It is an effort to cover up the true adverse reaction rate to these vaccines so that they
[1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:42.160]  can get through the low barrier of constraints put there by the FDA and onto the market.
[1:05:42.160 --> 1:05:43.160]  That is the only concern.
[1:05:43.160 --> 1:05:48.520]  Dr. Wakesfield is just one of many informed voices in the film, Covetland.

[1:05:55.640 --> 1:06:24.160]  Disclatement, absolutely free.
[1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:27.960]  Covetland has an incredible future before us, but we've got to recognize evil.
[1:06:27.960 --> 1:06:32.600]  We've got to learn to say no to it and stop it, or it will take over.
[1:06:32.600 --> 1:06:33.600]  It's its appetite.
[1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:36.000]  It's very mindless in its spirit.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:41.480]  There is a vacuum when we don't stand up for ourselves that is filled by corruption and
[1:06:41.480 --> 1:06:47.040]  filled by avarice, and we're getting front row seats to that all right now.
[1:06:47.040 --> 1:06:48.320]  All right.
[1:06:48.320 --> 1:06:54.120]  We have massive global news on the police state rollout of the COVID worldwide system.
[1:06:54.120 --> 1:06:55.120]  It's the basis.
[1:06:55.120 --> 1:06:56.120]  It's the religion.
[1:06:56.120 --> 1:06:57.520]  It's the communication system.
[1:06:57.520 --> 1:07:03.040]  It's the language of the new world order, and we've got a lot of huge news on that front.
[1:07:03.040 --> 1:07:10.600]  And the so-called precedents that Biden's using for forced inoculation come from specific
[1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:13.760]  rulings that blacks could be forcibly inoculated.
[1:07:13.760 --> 1:07:18.480]  So, boy, they are certainly dying on the wrong hill and hoping you don't look that
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:19.480]  evidence up.
[1:07:19.480 --> 1:07:21.240]  That is coming up.
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:28.200]  But we've got big, breaking news, and, again, everybody knows that you can do your own research,
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:31.640]  and I know this audience has done their own research.
[1:07:31.640 --> 1:07:35.080]  But a large part of who we are reaching out to is people that are not awake.
[1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:37.880]  It's like the prodigal son story.
[1:07:37.880 --> 1:07:42.840]  We're trying to reach out to people that are ill-informed or that are dumbed down or that
[1:07:42.840 --> 1:07:46.520]  are not even paying attention because they're going to be enslaved.
[1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:47.520]  They're going to be abused.
[1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:52.240]  They're going to be preyed on and, in many cases, turned into globalist minions that
[1:07:52.240 --> 1:07:54.400]  will be used against us in the future.
[1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:56.680]  So it's a life-and-death situation.
[1:07:56.680 --> 1:08:01.560]  It's not just morally right to wake up leftist and people that are asleep.
[1:08:01.560 --> 1:08:07.040]  It is essential, and it is our job to do it, not just sit here and echo chambers.
[1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:12.440]  And I know this audience of incredible activists know that because you are an activist audience
[1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:16.360]  in the arena, and I salute you.
[1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:18.760]  Because I always tell people the truth.
[1:08:18.760 --> 1:08:24.120]  Now, occasionally, I make mistakes, and I get things wrong, and sometimes I flip things
[1:08:24.120 --> 1:08:27.800]  around in my head.
[1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:34.480]  I said that the Rothschilds took over the British Empire at the Battle of Runnymead last week.
[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:41.160]  The Battle of Runnymead was in 1215, and the Battle of Runnymead was when the lords finally
[1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:46.760]  made the king not be God, and that began juries and grand juries and what we know of as English
[1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:51.400]  common law, the basis of our system today.
[1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:52.400]  It was 1815.
[1:08:52.400 --> 1:08:55.800]  And again, I'm going from memory.
[1:08:55.800 --> 1:08:58.960]  I should look all these things up and not just count on my memory.
[1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:10.360]  But it was 1215, so it was October 1214, King John returned to England, and they had Runnymead.
[1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:18.640]  And then the Battle of Waterloo was in 1815.
[1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:21.240]  Let's see if my memory serves on that.
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:24.440]  But the point is, I'm digressing, and I shouldn't even go there.
[1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:32.080]  In the main, we are extremely accurate and on target, and we're trying to tell you the
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:34.440]  truth.
[1:09:34.440 --> 1:09:39.160]  Sometimes I make mistakes, sometimes I get things wrong, but that's not on purpose.
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:47.840]  The entire currency, the entire system that we operate in is about getting it right.
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:54.920]  And I was right, it was 1815, the Battle of Waterloo, and that's when the Rothschilds
[1:09:54.920 --> 1:09:59.160]  were able to bankrupt the entire British economy by falsely claiming that Napoleon had defeated
[1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:06.200]  Lord Wellington and crashed the stock market to one penny on the pound, British Sterling,
[1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:10.920]  and he bought up almost the entire stock market, meaning the British Empire was now under his
[1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:13.520]  control in 1215.
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:15.720]  But I digress.
[1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:19.200]  Last week, I was listening to rebroadcast of the show, just happened to tune into it,
[1:10:19.200 --> 1:10:27.320]  and heard me say, yes, the Rothschilds took over at the Battle of Runnymead in 1214.
[1:10:27.320 --> 1:10:30.120]  And I was like, why the hell did I just say that?
[1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:33.800]  It's the Battle of Waterloo, 1815.
[1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:38.640]  But my brain got the dates, because they were similar in the 15 of the 14.
[1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:39.640]  That's how I did it.
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:44.280]  So I'm digressing, ladies and gentlemen, 20 years ago, I wouldn't have gotten those dates
[1:10:44.280 --> 1:10:45.280]  wrong.
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:46.280]  I had a photographic memory.
[1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:49.400]  Now I've got to make sure I've always got everything at my fingertips, because I'm 47.
[1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:50.400]  I've had head injuries.
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:52.400]  I put a lot of miles on this brain.
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:55.200]  It still works great, but it flips things.
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:56.320]  It moves things.
[1:10:56.320 --> 1:10:59.160]  It gets things backwards.
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:05.280]  And so now I pull everything up, when I want to make damn sure that I'm not mixing something
[1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:06.280]  around.
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:13.000]  But that said, something else I've noticed is that if I just talk about something, nobody
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  cares.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:17.600]  But if I build it up, it has an effect, people care, and it gets millions of views.
[1:11:17.600 --> 1:11:21.040]  Because we have millions of people tuning in right now, but I like to have certain parts
[1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:25.080]  of the show, get posted to Band-Aid video, get grabbed by you, because if you don't carry
[1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:29.160]  the ball, ball doesn't move to then share, so it affects the world.
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:33.320]  But let me go back to where I was five minutes ago, because I've just basically gone on a
[1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:36.120]  rabbit trail, but it's still an important rabbit trail.
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:38.800]  So listeners know where I'm coming from when you're tuned in, you're investing time here.
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:39.800]  You need to know why.
[1:11:39.800 --> 1:11:43.080]  Sometimes you'll hear me say something, but just damn wrong, and it's because we're
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:45.200]  failed falling creatures.
[1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:46.200]  And I get things wrong.
[1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:48.800]  I got so much going on up there that you know how it is.
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:53.800]  So if I look at your sunglasses and your wife says they're on your head, or I can't find
[1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:54.800]  my keys.
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:55.800]  They're on your back pocket.
[1:11:55.800 --> 1:11:58.160]  Where's my hat?
[1:11:58.160 --> 1:11:59.160]  It's on your head.
[1:11:59.160 --> 1:12:00.160]  But I digress.
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:05.520]  And they want to keep us kind of in that state while they take the world over and run everything.
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:10.480]  So important to get out of that state into the brain, being switched directly on.
[1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:13.080]  Now, let's hit it.
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:15.760]  I'm going to do this.
[1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:20.400]  When we come back next segment, I'm going to hit this, because I got so excited coming
[1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:23.680]  out of that segment, and I got so many thoughts going that it kind of frazzled what I wanted
[1:12:23.680 --> 1:12:25.800]  to say.
[1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:30.000]  But where I was going with it was just to say this.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.240]  We don't lie on purpose.
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:32.240]  We make mistakes sometimes.
[1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:35.600]  And I sort of give you examples, and I open up a file in my brand, and I went down that
[1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:36.600]  rabbit trail.
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:41.040]  And the reason I was saying that was I wanted to segue to, I told you they were going to
[1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:42.800]  steal the election from Trump.
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:46.040]  I said that on Joe Rogan's show, three days before the election, I said it here.
[1:12:46.040 --> 1:12:47.040]  That's the easiest place to find it.
[1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:49.880]  I said they'll win in a landslide, but they'll steal it with mail-in ballots.
[1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:54.680]  They'll then say it's the machines that stole the election, so that when people chase that
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:13:00.760]  down, they will hit a dead end, when it's all about the ballots being fed into machines
[1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:04.000]  and some hacking as well.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:10.560]  And then I saw my pillar guy, who's a great guy, 90% of what he puts out is super accurate,
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:15.360]  but then I saw kind of people planting some of the poison pills on him, of the machines,
[1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:19.480]  so the media could focus on that when he had his very important symposium, but it still
[1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:26.480]  doesn't matter, because what Lindell has done is good to keep the debate going and keep
[1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:30.760]  people aware of it, because the polls show the vast majority of Americans know, including
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:33.040]  Republican and Democrat, that the election was stolen.
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:34.280]  It was completely obvious.
[1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:37.960]  The polls close with the battleground states, Trump's way ahead, and then magically middle
[1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:43.280]  of the night, vans pull in, whether it's Michigan or whether it's Georgia or whether it's Pennsylvania
[1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:46.560]  or whether it's Arizona, and then it just, he shoots up straight.
[1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:52.200]  You know, the curve's like a barrel, like a circle, like a crescent.
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:57.600]  That's how real voting works, and then right there at the end, he hits the afterburners
[1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:00.400]  and shoots straight up to beat Trump.
[1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:02.400]  So people aren't stupid, they get that.
[1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:06.400]  That's why 80-some percent of Republicans say it was stolen, and 46% of Democrats,
[1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:08.800]  I mean, that is a large majority.
[1:14:08.800 --> 1:14:15.920]  You average those together, that's something like, 59% of the country thinks the election
[1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:20.240]  was stolen, because remember, a third of folks or more didn't vote.
[1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:23.520]  So they're not in those polls, that's of voters.
[1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:29.200]  But I digress.
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:34.320]  But when I saw what was happening in Arizona, and I saw how the media operated, and I saw
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:41.080]  how they tried to suppress the news that the audit was coming out Friday, and I saw them
[1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:47.720]  two days before, and you saw them, say, oh, the audit finds Trump lost, Biden won.
[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:50.960]  You knew the fix was in, you knew they were scared, you knew they were caught.
[1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:54.720]  And then Brian Stelter's like, this will bring down America, our country's ever been
[1:14:54.720 --> 1:14:55.720]  in so much danger.
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:14:59.560]  Well, I agree, foreign powers came in and took over, and we got generals that, you know,
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:03.560]  lied and said, oh, I only called, you know, on the eighth, because of what Trump was doing
[1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:04.560]  to the Chinese.
[1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:09.520]  Turns out he was telling the Chinese dictator in October that Trump was insane, and that
[1:15:09.520 --> 1:15:14.400]  he would stop him from nuking China, which is a total lie, and his treasonous, and that
[1:15:14.400 --> 1:15:16.360]  sack of filth should be arrested.
[1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:21.760]  I mean, Millie is just like a little kid dressed up in a general outfit, posing and walking
[1:15:21.760 --> 1:15:26.200]  around acting tough when he's an obese, anti-American traitor.
[1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:29.040]  Anyways, I'm ranting.
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:31.160]  I'm going to compose myself.
[1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:33.360]  I'm going to control myself.
[1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:37.000]  And I'm going to come back, and I'm going to lay out the huge news, because now it's
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:41.520]  official, and I could have just said it simply, I'm not going to tell you the election was
[1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:46.000]  stolen if it wasn't, and I'm not going to sit there and scare you wrong just for hype,
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:49.080]  but now Arizona has percent of the evidence of total fraud.
[1:15:49.080 --> 1:15:50.240]  Trump won the election.
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:51.240]  Now what happens next?
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:52.240]  There's been big developments.
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:58.880]  We'll tell you about when we come back.
[1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:00.880]  Your voice counts.
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:05.880]  When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:08.420]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:16:08.420 --> 1:16:09.920]  They know your anger.
[1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:14.200]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:15.200]  we've got.
[1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:19.440]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can

[1:16:56.360 --> 1:17:00.400]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[1:17:00.400 --> 1:17:01.400]  Me too.
[1:17:01.400 --> 1:17:05.640]  Listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's
[1:17:05.640 --> 1:17:08.320]  one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:12.720]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:14.440]  You probably already believe that.
[1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:15.640]  I certainly do.
[1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:16.640]  So here's the thing.
[1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:21.000]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:25.080]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[1:17:25.080 --> 1:17:30.880]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefence.com.
[1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:32.360]  No curators or treatments there.
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:36.840]  Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune
[1:17:36.840 --> 1:17:41.400]  support product based on that research called Immune 10X.

[1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:15.040]  Triple eight, triple eight, triple three, one, three, nine.
[1:18:15.040 --> 1:18:24.040]  Triple eight, triple three, one, three, nine.
[1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:57.040]  Thank you very much. That's infoboardstore.com.
[1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:26.040]  I also need you to wear masks.
[1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:31.040]  And I also need you to only shop at Mega Corporation.
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:37.040]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy.
[1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:42.040]  Leaving companies with only I own profitable.
[1:19:42.040 --> 1:19:45.040]  You will then be my slaves.
[1:19:45.040 --> 1:19:50.040]  And then you can get a special shot of Didem from Cobra.
[1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:56.040]  We'll approve your immune system. So you'll be depended on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[1:20:00.040 --> 1:20:03.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:03.040 --> 1:20:05.040]  Let's go.
[1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:40.040]  That's all coming up next segment.
[1:20:40.040 --> 1:20:42.040]  But let's get to this right now.
[1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:44.040]  Okay.
[1:20:44.040 --> 1:20:46.040]  So we already talked about it on Friday.
[1:20:46.040 --> 1:20:47.040]  We talked about it over the weekend.
[1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:48.040]  It shows on Saturday and Sunday.
[1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:50.040]  And we talked about it some yesterday.
[1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:57.040]  But Arizona did a first class audit of just Maricopa County.
[1:20:57.040 --> 1:21:05.040]  Where they saw most of the fraud going on during the election where Fox News called it early for Biden.
[1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:10.040]  And so they found close to 60,000 votes open and shut.
[1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:15.040]  That were duplicates for Biden that were fake names that were fraud.
[1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:18.040]  It's almost 60,000 open and shut.
[1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:24.040]  Hundreds of thousands of others that were very questionable and Trump only lost the state by 10,500 votes.
[1:21:24.040 --> 1:21:27.040]  So Trump won Arizona.
[1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:28.040]  He's vindicated.
[1:21:28.040 --> 1:21:34.040]  And you saw the disinfo going to overdrive on CNN, MSNBC, ABC, everywhere.
[1:21:34.040 --> 1:21:43.040]  Oh, look, the audit finds Biden won because they had spies inside that knew what they were going to release as a press release as auditors.
[1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:45.040]  You don't call the attorney general.
[1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:48.040]  You don't tell him what to do in the state.
[1:21:48.040 --> 1:21:55.040]  You put the findings out and then it's up to the public and the legislature and the governor and the attorney general about what the action is going to be.
[1:21:55.040 --> 1:22:06.040]  So they said, our audit found that Biden won the election by X amount of votes, Trump lost by X amount, and that we found these groups of votes.
[1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:17.040]  And here are photo copies, here are scans, here is our detailed audit that took six months showing that they stole nearly 60,000 votes from Trump.
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:20.040]  And he won by 40 plus thousand.
[1:22:20.040 --> 1:22:22.040]  That's how you state it.
[1:22:22.040 --> 1:22:27.040]  When the FBI gets you indicted for, you know, saying, you know, not paying taxes for $5 million.
[1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:34.040]  They say such and such has $6 million in their bank account and we have evidence and here's our evidence that they stole $5 million.
[1:22:34.040 --> 1:22:44.040]  So again, you make the statement that he won the election by this many fraudulent votes, like the horse won because it was on steroids and amphetamines.
[1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:48.040]  And before this guy won the boxing title, he was later tested positive.
[1:22:48.040 --> 1:22:51.040]  We know he was on it and so he loses the title.
[1:22:51.040 --> 1:22:53.040]  But it's the boxing commission that removes the title.
[1:22:53.040 --> 1:22:57.040]  It's the legislature attorney general that removes the title.
[1:22:57.040 --> 1:23:03.040]  So they use a semantical manipulation to go, oh, look, they say they're going to say he won.
[1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:06.040]  Yes, by stealing.
[1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:13.040]  Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France however many times it was, what four or five times, by cheating and had them stripped.
[1:23:13.040 --> 1:23:16.040]  So when they stripped him, they said he falsely won by this.
[1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:18.040]  So they played a semantical game.
[1:23:18.040 --> 1:23:19.040]  But let me just move forward.
[1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:27.040]  Even the Sunday Times of London, very respected, very conservative in what they point it, had big articles like this one.
[1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:28.040]  So Trump was right.
[1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:30.040]  The election was rigged.
[1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:37.040]  And our next one will be to and that's the $60 trillion issue.
[1:23:37.040 --> 1:23:39.040]  I mean, that's it's bigger than $60 trillion.
[1:23:39.040 --> 1:23:47.040]  It's the whole future if these guys can engage in fraud like Trudeau just did in Canada, like Newsom did the same damn thing in California.
[1:23:47.040 --> 1:23:52.040]  They're calling all these snap elections because they're still using mail-in ballots and can still get away with it.
[1:23:52.040 --> 1:23:54.040]  And Bloomberg told us it's going to be a red mirage.
[1:23:54.040 --> 1:23:58.040]  Trump will win that night, but we're going to have the ballots afterwards.
[1:23:58.040 --> 1:24:03.040]  No matter the number they needed, they would be delivered by trucks, by vans at night.
[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:11.040]  And if the USPS looked at what the 30,000 ballots were in Pennsylvania and said, I drove this over state lines, a computer printed this.
[1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:12.040]  These aren't signed ballots.
[1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:14.040]  These are fake ballots.
[1:24:14.040 --> 1:24:16.040]  FBI, we may arrest you.
[1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:19.040]  Why don't you shut your mouth about what you saw?
[1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:23.040]  Because it was their job to make sure the steal was in all over the country.
[1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:26.040]  They would refuse to talk to witnesses unless it was for intimidation.
[1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:36.040]  So, Rod Little has come out and broken the sound of an excellent article in The Times of Sunday Times in London.
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:38.040]  Now, here's the big news.
[1:24:38.040 --> 1:24:44.040]  I always wait into the biggest news later and never tell you it's even coming up.
[1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:45.040]  That's my problem.
[1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:46.040]  I'd give you a little backstory and write to it.
[1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:49.040]  I should have started the whole hour with this as it's broke.
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:25:02.040]  It happened, the Attorney General, Mark Branovich of Arizona has sent a preservation of evidence litigation hold.
[1:25:02.040 --> 1:25:18.040]  And next, you know, with criminal charges to Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, Maricopa County Recorders Office, Supervisor Clint Hickman, Supervisor Steve Gallardo.
[1:25:18.040 --> 1:25:19.040]  There it is.
[1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:20.040]  We'll get more to this in a moment.
[1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:23.040]  But, ah, huge development, GatewayPunna.com.
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:24.040]  They got caught.
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:27.040]  24 criminal operatives caught on video.
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:31.040]  Stepping drop box with 1,900 ballots in three days.
[1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:36.040]  Ooh, that's right.
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:39.040]  Whatever amount is needed will be supplied.
[1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:43.040]  Close, he said, no matter what happens, Trump will be gone.
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:50.040]  And then they caught them deleting the surveillance footage, but ooh, turns out there's footage of that footage.
[1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:54.040]  Oops-a-daisy.
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:57.040]  The left puts in their surveillance grid for all of us, but then it captures them.
[1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:00.040]  Just like, oh, a water main broke in Atlanta.
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:01.040]  Oh, everybody out.
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:02.040]  We're not counting.
[1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:07.040]  Look around both ways, pull out the suitcases and start running each stack over and over.
[1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:08.040]  You look over your shoulder.
[1:26:08.040 --> 1:26:10.040]  And, well, they were moving real slow before that.
[1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:13.040]  Soon as they kick everybody out, put poster board up over the windows.
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:19.040]  I mean, you can't get more obvious than this.
[1:26:19.040 --> 1:26:22.040]  If you're caught driving by a liquor store late at night, you see a door knocked open,
[1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:24.040]  and a guy in a mask pops out and pops back in.
[1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:25.040]  That's probable cause.
[1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:27.040]  I mean, you might as well be putting a ski mask on.
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:28.040]  Oh, there's a water main, bud.
[1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:29.040]  Close the doors.
[1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:30.040]  Block out the windows.
[1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:31.040]  Keep everybody back.
[1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:32.040]  Keep back with COVID.
[1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:35.040]  50 feet from the window in Michigan.
[1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:37.040]  Everywhere they did the same thing.
[1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:40.040]  And then inside, over surveillance footage.
[1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:41.040]  Oh, let me get underneath the chair.
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:42.040]  Oh, here it is.
[1:26:42.040 --> 1:26:44.040]  Let me get that big, old, juicy suitcase.
[1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:46.040]  All of this is rebuying.
[1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:47.040]  Oh, let me.
[1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:48.040]  Oh, black lives matter.
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:49.040]  Pop.
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:50.040]  Get it out.
[1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:51.040]  Oh, yeah.
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:52.040]  Oh, Lordy.
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:55.040]  A mother and daughter team.
[1:26:55.040 --> 1:27:00.040]  I mean, yes, they stole the election from Trump.
[1:27:00.040 --> 1:27:04.040]  And notice they say, we don't allow criticism of any vaccines down the Internet, says Big Tech.
[1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:05.040]  We're watching you.
[1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:06.040]  And no one's allowed to question the election.
[1:27:06.040 --> 1:27:07.040]  It was total integrity.
[1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:11.040]  Even though they're all there, they're talking about Russia not being fair, and Belarus not
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:14.040]  being fair, and this country not being fair in that country.
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:18.040]  Because if they don't have duplicate ballots, and if it's not all saved, and if you don't
[1:27:18.040 --> 1:27:22.040]  let third party observers in, and if you don't keep a record, why it's fraud?
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:23.040]  Which, of course, it is.
[1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:28.040]  But are you pulling briefcases out when you say a water main buzzer that wasn't true?
[1:27:28.040 --> 1:27:31.040]  Are you putting up a poster board on the windows?
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:35.040]  And then magically, all the votes Biden needs to win are found just then.
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:37.040]  Just like Michigan, Biden's losing.
[1:27:37.040 --> 1:27:43.040]  And then magically, the last minute, his race car was three laps behind.
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:48.040]  Top speed, 250, but suddenly his race car goes 2,000 miles an hour and laps the lead
[1:27:48.040 --> 1:27:51.040]  car three times.
[1:27:51.040 --> 1:27:54.040]  And then the Democrats bragging time magazine, how they stole it.
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:56.040]  Yeah, put that article back up.
[1:27:56.040 --> 1:28:00.040]  How they stole it, how they set us up at the Capitol, how they work with Republicans
[1:28:00.040 --> 1:28:04.040]  of the media and Big Tech as one big group, and how they're going to steal the next one.
[1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:06.040]  Steal, steal, steal, steal, steal, steal, steal.
[1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:10.040]  Can't get any more obvious because, hey, wait a minute, we can't have people with their
[1:28:10.040 --> 1:28:13.040]  telephoto lenses, and we already backed them up 30, 40, 50 feet.
[1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:15.040]  Well, they've got telephoto lenses.
[1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:19.040]  They're going to see us pulling out the briefcases and pulling out the suitcases and pulling
[1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:21.040]  out the bags full of ballots that are all providing.
[1:28:21.040 --> 1:28:22.040]  You can't do that.
[1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:24.040]  Cover it up right now.
[1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:28.040]  Cover it up right now.
[1:28:28.040 --> 1:28:30.040]  Woo!
[1:28:30.040 --> 1:28:35.040]  So now, it's all out the open, and the criminal indictments are coming, and the first letter
[1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:37.040]  by the Attorney General has gone out.
[1:28:37.040 --> 1:28:41.040]  The New World Order is crapping its britches because they're planning to steal that midterm
[1:28:41.040 --> 1:28:45.040]  election bigger than Donkey Kong's balls.
[1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:46.040]  Excuse me.
[1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:48.040]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[1:28:48.040 --> 1:28:51.040]  Oh, my God, this is an insane asylum.
[1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:53.040]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:53.040 --> 1:28:55.040]  Stay with us.
[1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:59.040]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:05.040]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative.
[1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:06.040]  It hurts.
[1:29:06.040 --> 1:29:07.040]  It stinks.
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:09.040]  It's got pus coming out of it.
[1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:10.040]  I go to the doctor.
[1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:11.040]  They fix it.
[1:29:11.040 --> 1:29:12.040]  That's not negative.
[1:29:12.040 --> 1:29:13.040]  I'm not living in denial.
[1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:18.040]  And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we feel yet, but now
[1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:19.040]  it's come to the surface.
[1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:21.040]  That's actually a positive thing.
[1:29:21.040 --> 1:29:23.040]  And so, yeah, Trump did an overall great job.
[1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:24.040]  They stole the election.
[1:29:24.040 --> 1:29:26.040]  We can't get down about that.
[1:29:26.040 --> 1:29:30.040]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:34.040]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed.
[1:29:34.040 --> 1:29:35.040]  They're scared.
[1:29:35.040 --> 1:29:37.040]  That's why, instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers.
[1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:38.040]  Look what happened.
[1:29:38.040 --> 1:29:39.040]  No, we're a bunch of winners.
[1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:40.040]  They're trying to suppress us.
[1:29:40.040 --> 1:29:44.040]  Let our light of proof shine and tell everybody what's happening.
[1:29:44.040 --> 1:29:48.040]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.
[1:29:48.040 --> 1:29:52.040]  Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're in an information war.
[1:29:52.040 --> 1:29:55.040]  We're going to win this together in the Fight Starts.
[1:29:55.040 --> 1:30:02.040]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[1:30:02.040 --> 1:30:07.040]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss.
[1:30:07.040 --> 1:30:08.040]  Everybody else has.
[1:30:08.040 --> 1:30:18.040]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died
[1:30:18.040 --> 1:30:21.040]  and bled and sweat for.
[1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:25.040]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:30.040]  And I see the general public in a medically induced, scientifically induced behavioral
[1:30:30.040 --> 1:30:34.040]  psychologically controlled tranche.
[1:30:34.040 --> 1:30:39.040]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad.
[1:30:39.040 --> 1:30:46.040]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[1:30:46.040 --> 1:30:49.040]  and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[1:30:49.040 --> 1:30:54.040]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence
[1:30:54.040 --> 1:30:57.040]  and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[1:30:57.040 --> 1:31:01.040]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[1:31:01.040 --> 1:31:02.040]  And I just want to say something.
[1:31:02.040 --> 1:31:07.040]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:08.040]  the years.
[1:31:08.040 --> 1:31:09.040]  It is truly an answer to prayer.
[1:31:09.040 --> 1:31:12.040]  And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[1:31:12.040 --> 1:31:15.040]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[1:31:15.040 --> 1:31:19.040]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter you got red
[1:31:19.040 --> 1:31:20.040]  blood.
[1:31:20.040 --> 1:31:24.040]  And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[1:31:24.040 --> 1:31:29.040]  and sisters together and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over
[1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:30.040]  the years.
[1:31:30.040 --> 1:31:33.040]  And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:36.040]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:31:36.040 --> 1:31:42.040]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[1:31:42.040 --> 1:31:44.040]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:31:44.040 --> 1:31:48.040]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[1:31:48.040 --> 1:31:49.040]  done.
[1:31:49.040 --> 1:31:52.040]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[1:31:52.040 --> 1:31:56.040]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse.
[1:31:56.040 --> 1:31:57.040]  God bless.
[1:31:57.040 --> 1:31:59.040]  I'll tell you what's life and death.
[1:31:59.040 --> 1:32:04.040]  If you don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the right to be able to communicate,
[1:32:04.040 --> 1:32:06.040]  then you don't have a future.
[1:32:06.040 --> 1:32:10.040]  Always when governments take away speech, they then enslave the population and then they
[1:32:10.040 --> 1:32:12.040]  finally start exterminating the population.
[1:32:12.040 --> 1:32:16.040]  And America, the entire world is going down the tubes because the UN Global's directed
[1:32:16.040 --> 1:32:17.040]  great reset.
[1:32:17.040 --> 1:32:21.040]  That's why it's more important than ever that M4 Wars stay on the air and that all of us
[1:32:21.040 --> 1:32:22.040]  stay healthy.
[1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:27.040]  That's why I'm offering a bunch of our best-selling products at 50% off for a limited time only

[1:32:56.040 --> 1:33:24.040]  Thank you.
[1:33:24.040 --> 1:33:33.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:35.040]  And we are back.
[1:33:35.040 --> 1:33:40.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got some really good news for you.
[1:33:40.040 --> 1:33:44.040]  Then I'm going to get into the really scary news and the so-called precedents that Joe
[1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:47.040]  Biden's using for his endless police state lockdown.
[1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:50.040]  So let's jump right into it right now.
[1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:59.040]  COVID-19 in Norway can now be compared to the flu thanks to vaccines, says health official.
[1:33:59.040 --> 1:34:01.040]  I love that spin.
[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:06.040]  When I actually went and looked up the report, they're saying it's no more than just the
[1:34:06.040 --> 1:34:12.040]  flu and their death rates of the last 20 months are roughly the same as it was previous to
[1:34:12.040 --> 1:34:14.040]  all of that.
[1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:21.040]  Norway official COVID-19 can now be compared to the flu as country removes pandemic restrictions.
[1:34:21.040 --> 1:34:27.040]  The truth is, you're more likely to be sick or hospitalized if you've had the vaccine.
[1:34:27.040 --> 1:34:32.040]  I show you those statistics from around the world yesterday.
[1:34:32.040 --> 1:34:36.040]  But that leads us to the scary part.
[1:34:36.040 --> 1:34:39.040]  And I've talked a lot about this, but now it's actually happening in Canada.
[1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:40.040]  It's happening in Europe.
[1:34:40.040 --> 1:34:43.040]  And now they want to bring it not just to Australia, but to the United States.
[1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:48.040]  They're building emergency centers, not just in the UK, not just in Australia, but here.
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:52.040]  And it's also on Canadian TV that they've set these up.
[1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:58.040]  Secret emergency centers that if you're unvaccinated, they're going to come take your
[1:34:58.040 --> 1:35:03.040]  children and put them in a shielding center.
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:07.040]  And it describes how adults will be there as well that are held and that you'll be made
[1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:10.040]  to do labor to do your part.
[1:35:10.040 --> 1:35:11.040]  It's all right here.
[1:35:11.040 --> 1:35:19.040]  Here it is, COVID-19 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, humans of the disease.
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:21.040]  They want to prevent us.
[1:35:21.040 --> 1:35:26.040]  Interim operational considerations for implementation of shielding approach to prevent COVID-19
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:29.040]  infections in humanitarian settings.
[1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:30.040]  This is from a year ago.
[1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:33.040]  It's now being set up worldwide as they build giant cities.
[1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:37.040]  Let's pull them up some of the FEMA camps, which are their own emergency centers in
[1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:39.040]  Australia and the UK and Canada.
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:41.040]  I mean, it shows these facilities.
[1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:45.040]  And then there's memes that show them side by side with concentration camps.
[1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:49.040]  And it goes on to say they're going to take over a whole neighborhood, sports stadiums,
[1:35:49.040 --> 1:35:54.040]  other facilities and turn them into the centers where you'll be forced to live if the outbreak
[1:35:54.040 --> 1:35:55.040]  gets too big.
[1:35:55.040 --> 1:35:59.040]  So you're safe from, I guess, the zombies on the outside.
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:06.040]  So this is the thinly veiled smoke screen for permanent martial law.
[1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:11.040]  And here, of course, is the latest from the VAERS report, all vaccine deaths previous years
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:15.040]  as reported by healthcare providers, doctors and nurses, compared to what's happened since the
[1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:17.040]  injections began.
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:20.040]  And it begins right when the shots start in the US.
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:24.040]  And in England, it started a few months earlier, it starts right there in England.
[1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:25.040]  They have a similar system.
[1:36:25.040 --> 1:36:34.040]  Absolutely devastating, devastating information that they're trying to suppress from the
[1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:35.040]  world.
[1:36:35.040 --> 1:36:38.040]  You know, I mentioned this earlier, so I wanted to back it up.
[1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:42.040]  YouTube is a subsidiary of Google.
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:49.040]  And Google was set up 23 years ago by a coup inside the government, the National Security
[1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:57.040]  Agency, the CIA, and the Clintons as they were leaving office.
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:36:59.040]  But it's bipartisan.
[1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:02.040]  And Incutel, a division of the CIA, set it up.
[1:37:02.040 --> 1:37:08.040]  It was given all the CIA, computer programs, the word search programs, the NSA, search
[1:37:08.040 --> 1:37:10.040]  systems they've been using for keyword searches.
[1:37:10.040 --> 1:37:15.040]  They would create a database of your phone calls, radio transmissions, TV transmissions,
[1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:23.040]  undersea cable transmissions, and they would then be able to keyword, have analysts, search
[1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:25.040]  through that with voice recognition.
[1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:27.040]  They've had that since the 80s.
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:33.040]  And that's known as the echelon system that got exposed in the late 90s or mid 90s.
[1:37:33.040 --> 1:37:38.040]  And so now they wanted to externalize the NSA system of surveillance so the public would
[1:37:38.040 --> 1:37:44.040]  accept it by having Google and then Facebook and then Twitter and then Apple externalize
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:49.040]  these technologies so that we would opt into having a home assistant that watches us and
[1:37:49.040 --> 1:37:51.040]  listens to us, like Alexa.
[1:37:51.040 --> 1:37:56.040]  So we would opt in to having tracking and GPS tracking on your phone.
[1:37:56.040 --> 1:38:01.040]  So we would opt in to the cable box tracking what we do and where we go and deleting things
[1:38:01.040 --> 1:38:05.040]  that they want, delete it off of it or blocking things they want blocked off or smart meters
[1:38:05.040 --> 1:38:07.040]  and the rest of it.
[1:38:07.040 --> 1:38:09.040]  So that was all their plan.
[1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:17.040]  And we basically, like the ancient soldiers at Troy, picked up the Trojan horse and brought
[1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:20.040]  it inside and the rest is history.
[1:38:20.040 --> 1:38:25.040]  And so now we're waking up to what was in the Trojan horse and saying, we don't want it.
[1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:27.040]  And they're coming after us.
[1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:31.040]  So the Pentagon, Wired Magazine reports they killed the life log project that they built
[1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:32.040]  and designed.
[1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:35.040]  They handed it to Harvard and to their frontman, Mark Zuckerberg.
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:36.040]  This is all declassified.
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:38.040]  And it was Facebook.
[1:38:38.040 --> 1:38:42.040]  You can have the Pentagon get everybody to log in and opt into a surveillance system.
[1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:48.040]  By the way, I know folks at the CIA and at Army Special Operations that worked on life
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:49.040]  log.
[1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:53.040]  And then when it was handed over, they said, here you go, boys, we've launched Facebook
[1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:56.040]  now and we'll be able to track everybody worldwide with this.
[1:38:56.040 --> 1:38:58.040]  And here's all the real functions it's got.
[1:38:58.040 --> 1:39:01.040]  You hit a button, it turns the microphone on, turns the camera on, hit a button, downloads
[1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:02.040]  all your info.
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:03.040]  Want to find somebody?
[1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:07.040]  You can search the whole Facebook database in seconds with a face scan for who you've
[1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:08.040]  been around.
[1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:13.040]  Then they can try to contact everybody you know or everybody you bumped into.
[1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:15.040]  And there is DARPA and life log.
[1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:19.040]  So that's all declassified now.
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:20.040]  But I knew that back in the time.
[1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:25.040]  People in contacts I had thought it was pretty damn dangerous were telling me about it.
[1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:30.040]  So back in 96 when they passed the telecommunications act, in the telecommunications act it said
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:34.040]  by 2000, all cell phones will be triangulated by cell towers and GPS.
[1:39:34.040 --> 1:39:41.040]  That will be used as a global positioning system for a world grid and to buy and sell
[1:39:41.040 --> 1:39:42.040]  in the future.
[1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:45.040]  And a type of pre-crime system.
[1:39:45.040 --> 1:39:48.040]  And I would tell people out on here, they'd say, you're crazy, there's not GPS on my
[1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:49.040]  phone.
[1:39:49.040 --> 1:39:52.040]  You've got to go buy a Garmin system for $200 at Walmart.
[1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:53.040]  That's not true.
[1:39:53.040 --> 1:39:56.040]  When it was only triangulating with a cell tower, same thing.
[1:39:56.040 --> 1:40:00.040]  But see, the public didn't want to believe that, I mean, if I told people 20 years ago
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:03.040]  you'll accept a home assistant in your house that watches and listens to you, they wouldn't
[1:40:03.040 --> 1:40:04.040]  believe it because they didn't.
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:06.040]  That was being announced then, theoretically.
[1:40:06.040 --> 1:40:09.040]  So all this stuff's been theoretical.
[1:40:09.040 --> 1:40:10.040]  Now they've done it.
[1:40:10.040 --> 1:40:11.040]  And now they're going to ralt the rest of it.
[1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:14.040]  Hey, you've got to have this in your home or we're going to come arrest you.
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:17.040]  Hey, you've got to have this phone with you or you can't leave your house.
[1:40:17.040 --> 1:40:22.040]  Australia announced a week ago that they are going to make you have a phone with you at
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:23.040]  all times and leave your house.
[1:40:23.040 --> 1:40:28.040]  The police will randomly call you, physically or with a digital robo called, if you don't
[1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:33.040]  answer within 15 minutes, you'll be arrested.
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:36.040]  And they're now going to use it to enforce, quote, the social distancing.
[1:40:36.040 --> 1:40:39.040]  Oh, and you guys gave me the article that already lost at the stack.
[1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:42.040]  They just came out, the Australian government announced.
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:43.040]  Oh, here it is.
[1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:49.040]  Sydney, unvaccinated, warned of social isolation when COVID-19 lockdown ends.
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:54.040]  So they hold you hostage and then make you get the deadly shot and make you have an ID
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:55.040]  to have it.
[1:40:55.040 --> 1:41:01.040]  And now the police chief, police chiefs in several of the big cities, including Sydney,
[1:41:01.040 --> 1:41:04.040]  have come out and said, we're not going to enforce this.
[1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:06.040]  Well, it's not our job.
[1:41:06.040 --> 1:41:07.040]  They're not against having this.
[1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:10.040]  They just say, it's too hard for us to enforce over every business.
[1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:15.040]  You need to just find the businesses with code enforcers that don't enforce it like New York.
[1:41:15.040 --> 1:41:19.040]  So it's all about intimidation, all about control, all about the criminal activity of these people.
[1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:25.040]  And then when they release a new virus, create new fear, they'll say, oh, the unvaccinated,
[1:41:25.040 --> 1:41:27.040]  they're the ones that caused all this.
[1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:32.040]  They've got to be arrested and put in shield centers so they can't be incubators for this,
[1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:35.040]  even though it's people that have taken the shots that are incubating.
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:36.040]  They're the ones creating the variants.
[1:41:36.040 --> 1:41:37.040]  That's all admitted.
[1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:39.040]  We told you a year and a half ago.
[1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:41.040]  They will say the unvaccinated are the problem.
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:43.040]  This is all about getting the vast majority inoculated.
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:45.040]  They're not protected.
[1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:47.040]  Their immune systems are destroyed.
[1:41:47.040 --> 1:41:49.040]  They're turned into virus breeding grounds.
[1:41:49.040 --> 1:41:53.040]  But they're going to be told they're sick because you didn't take the shot by the very people that poisoned them.
[1:41:53.040 --> 1:41:55.040]  Comprende?
[1:41:55.040 --> 1:41:59.040]  Because they won't go look up all the scientists and researchers and people that are telling them,
[1:41:59.040 --> 1:42:01.040]  oh, this will turn your immune system off.
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:02.040]  This will cause blood clots.
[1:42:02.040 --> 1:42:05.040]  This will cause heart attacks, which was all proven right and happened.
[1:42:05.040 --> 1:42:13.040]  Because when you try to warn people, all the big tech linked up together with governments as well,
[1:42:13.040 --> 1:42:19.040]  block you when you try to show the former chief scientist at Pfizer saying it will cause blood clots
[1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:21.040]  and heart attacks and infertility, which it has now.
[1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:22.040]  He was right.
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:25.040]  Or when the Nobel Prize winner for discovering HIV comes out and says,
[1:42:25.040 --> 1:42:26.040]  this will make you sick.
[1:42:26.040 --> 1:42:27.040]  This is man-made.
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:30.040]  He gets shut down because this is an attack.
[1:42:30.040 --> 1:42:33.040]  This is a scientific big tech military takeover.
[1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:38.040]  This is information aggression as the Russians said about YouTube banning RT.
[1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:39.040]  German.
[1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:42.040]  But our leaders are obviously on board with it.
[1:42:42.040 --> 1:42:44.040]  The Republican leaders are playing dumb.
[1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:45.040]  They're on the payroll.
[1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:46.040]  They're not stupid.
[1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:47.040]  They know about this.
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:51.040]  I mean, Gigi Pink's banning big tech over there because they're making a move on him.
[1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:52.040]  But our government won't.
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:54.040]  They said they were their thumbs in their rear ends.
[1:42:56.040 --> 1:43:01.040]  God created each and every one of us with free will.
[1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:05.040]  When we look at the world system now openly announcing the mark of the beast,
[1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:10.040]  everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will
[1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:15.040]  and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity,
[1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:21.040]  our very genetics, our very future over to them.
[1:43:21.040 --> 1:43:23.040]  They want control of procreation.
[1:43:23.040 --> 1:43:26.040]  They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:32.040]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[1:43:32.040 --> 1:43:37.040]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind and God's image and given free will.
[1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:38.040]  And make no mistake.
[1:43:38.040 --> 1:43:43.040]  All of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time
[1:43:43.040 --> 1:43:48.040]  so that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[1:43:48.040 --> 1:43:55.040]  And then for eternity win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[1:43:55.040 --> 1:44:00.040]  In late August, infill war saw an explosion of orders
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:05.040]  because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet
[1:44:05.040 --> 1:44:11.040]  by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:44:11.040 --> 1:44:15.040]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:18.040]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of,
[1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:22.040]  right along with water filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:26.040]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.
[1:44:26.040 --> 1:44:29.040]  Now we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:30.040]  It's high quality.
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:33.040]  It's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com
[1:44:33.040 --> 1:44:37.040]  because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:40.040]  and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[1:44:40.040 --> 1:44:46.040]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:46.040 --> 1:44:51.040]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:54.040]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:56.040 --> 1:45:01.040]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:03.040]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:08.040]  I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:11.040]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:12.040]  And it worked pretty good.
[1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:14.040]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that.
[1:45:14.040 --> 1:45:16.040]  You had, you know, with a deep burden of course, you know,
[1:45:16.040 --> 1:45:18.040]  and I got really excited about that so I took it.
[1:45:18.040 --> 1:45:25.040]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[1:45:25.040 --> 1:45:28.040]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[1:45:28.040 --> 1:45:32.040]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back
[1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:35.040]  and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[1:45:35.040 --> 1:45:37.040]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:41.040]  The one I like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:42.040]  It's amazing. It works.
[1:45:42.040 --> 1:45:45.040]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[1:45:45.040 --> 1:45:48.040]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[1:45:48.040 --> 1:45:51.040]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[1:45:51.040 --> 1:45:56.040]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[1:45:56.040 --> 1:46:02.040]  So if you understand that this is not FDA approved, it's totally experimental.
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:05.040]  It's never been given to human beings before.
[1:46:05.040 --> 1:46:13.040]  Some of the ingredients inside of these shots have never been injected in human beings before.
[1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:15.040]  There are no long term studies.
[1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:21.040]  We don't know what's going to happen inside your body somewhere four to six weeks after your second injection
[1:46:21.040 --> 1:46:24.040]  or four to six months or even two years.
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:30.040]  We have no idea whether it's going to cause infertility, whether it's going to cause cancer,
[1:46:30.040 --> 1:46:33.040]  how bad your autoimmune disease is going to be.
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:38.040]  My conclusion after looking at this for a long time and listening to the arguments for these masks,
[1:46:38.040 --> 1:46:44.040]  I've determined that if you believe, if you're a medical doctor or a scientist that's spouting using these masks,
[1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:47.040]  you're either being played or you're being paid.
[1:46:47.040 --> 1:46:51.040]  Secure your copy of Covidland today at Covidland.com.
[1:46:51.040 --> 1:47:09.040]  If you order by October 6th, you get a free copy of Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:42.040]  All right, New South Wales, the new North Korean command center,
[1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:46.040]  the new capital of Australia's North Korean system,
[1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:53.040]  has come out and said, quote, unvaccinated, warned of social isolation when Covid-19 lockdown ends.
[1:47:53.040 --> 1:48:00.040]  So they tell you it ends, but then the digital passport, the vaccine passport, the true nightmare starts.
[1:48:00.040 --> 1:48:02.040]  And so that's what they're doing.
[1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:04.040]  It's all run by the United Nations.
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:09.040]  Now, the Australian government has also announced that lockdowns are going to come back,
[1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:13.040]  that the police force is going to be permanently mainly focused on this.
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:17.040]  You're all dirty, you're all evil, you're all bad, you've got to be forcibly tested.
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:19.040]  You've got to be controlled where you can go and what you can do.
[1:48:19.040 --> 1:48:24.040]  But that's great because they're also going to have a carbon monitor on your phone
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:26.040]  that tracks where you go and what you can do as well.
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:29.040]  And United Airlines has announced they're going to do this.
[1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:32.040]  AstroCards announced they're going to do this here in America.
[1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:35.040]  So everybody doesn't have to wait like John Kerry said last week.
[1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:37.040]  Oh, we're going to implement the carbon taxes.
[1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:38.040]  We don't care what Congress does.
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:44.040]  The corporations are going to do it and the blue cities are going to do it.
[1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:47.040]  And I guess you could call them red cities if you want to use the communist analogy.
[1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:52.040]  But here in America, it's liberals, blue, conservatives, red.
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:57.040]  How about we should be pro-human and pro-liberty, not pro-territy?
[1:48:57.040 --> 1:49:02.040]  So she's saying that just a few days ago, they said, hey, you're going to have to take periodic shots every few months.
[1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:08.040]  You're going to have to take pills from Pfizer. They're your boss. And it's never going to end.
[1:49:08.040 --> 1:49:10.040]  And live as you know it is over.
[1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:13.040]  Wow, the bureaucrats know they were unpopular.
[1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:15.040]  They've been stealing elections for a while in Australia.
[1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:17.040]  They've been stealing them here for a while.
[1:49:17.040 --> 1:49:19.040]  But it's becoming obvious they're doing that.
[1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:22.040]  And so their answer is, hmm, what have we got on the shelf?
[1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:29.040]  Operation lockstep from the Rockefellers saying governments could use through the UN the fear of a virus
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:33.040]  to lock down simultaneously that way one country doesn't get blamed.
[1:49:33.040 --> 1:49:36.040]  And you never come out of it.
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:40.040]  Just like in North Korea, they had the Korean War.
[1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:46.040]  And so when that armistice happened in the 1950s, they never came out of the permanent emergency.
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:48.040]  It'd be like if there was a nuclear war.
[1:49:48.040 --> 1:49:51.040]  And it took out the military bases or whatever.
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:53.040]  You know we've been a tyranny for 100 years.
[1:49:53.040 --> 1:49:58.040]  You know we'd never come out of the martial law that would take place because of that.
[1:49:58.040 --> 1:50:00.040]  And they've tested their police.
[1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:02.040]  They've acted shamefully.
[1:50:02.040 --> 1:50:05.040]  They've acted wickedly so the police in Europe.
[1:50:05.040 --> 1:50:13.040]  But in the South and in the West, the Southwest, except for New Mexico, they've been terrible.
[1:50:13.040 --> 1:50:15.040]  The police refuse to be part of it.
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:18.040]  And because they refuse to be part of it, we don't live under tyranny.
[1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:23.040]  That's why they're coming out with AI-controlled robots and social credit scores where it doesn't matter.
[1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:27.040]  We'll just turn your credit card off if you don't behave the way we want you to.
[1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:29.040]  And it's not coming, it's here.
[1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:33.040]  It's not coming, it's now.
[1:50:33.040 --> 1:50:36.040]  So here is the premiere of New South Wales.
[1:50:36.040 --> 1:50:37.040]  Here's Gladys.
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:39.040]  I want to be very clear.
[1:50:39.040 --> 1:50:43.040]  Life for the unvaccinated will be very difficult indefinitely.
[1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:48.040]  And what I'm really pleased about is the way in which the vast majority of our population,
[1:50:48.040 --> 1:50:53.040]  people ask me yesterday, aren't you worried about people having conflicts at businesses or otherwise
[1:50:53.040 --> 1:50:55.040]  when the unvaccinated try to get in?
[1:50:55.040 --> 1:50:58.040]  But nine out of ten of us are already vaccinated in New South Wales.
[1:50:58.040 --> 1:51:02.040]  Nine out of ten adults are already vaccinated or close to.
[1:51:02.040 --> 1:51:03.040]  That is huge.
[1:51:03.040 --> 1:51:07.040]  The vast majority of our citizens have already spoken, have already made it.
[1:51:07.040 --> 1:51:08.040]  That's enough.
[1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:09.040]  It's so easy.
[1:51:09.040 --> 1:51:10.040]  God says, do it.
[1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:11.040]  Take your shot.
[1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:12.040]  Everybody's getting it.
[1:51:12.040 --> 1:51:13.040]  Oh, there's a new booster shot you need.
[1:51:13.040 --> 1:51:15.040]  They're up to shot four in Israel.
[1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:20.040]  Oh, and they admit in the Israeli study, the third shot gives you 48 hours of protection.
[1:51:20.040 --> 1:51:21.040]  That's just made up.
[1:51:21.040 --> 1:51:22.040]  They actually said that.
[1:51:22.040 --> 1:51:24.040]  And the fourth one, nothing makes you ill.
[1:51:24.040 --> 1:51:26.040]  Oh, really?
[1:51:26.040 --> 1:51:32.040]  Just like in the chicken studies with a similar vaccine for another COVID virus, spike protein,
[1:51:32.040 --> 1:51:35.040]  they can make the chickens where they don't die from the virus.
[1:51:35.040 --> 1:51:43.040]  But then by the fourth or fifth shot, a new virus gives rise that kills 100% of the chickens.
[1:51:43.040 --> 1:51:48.040]  So then they give them a fifth shot or sixth shot and they call it Merrick's disease.
[1:51:48.040 --> 1:51:51.040]  And the chicken becomes a living tumor.
[1:51:51.040 --> 1:51:54.040]  Tumors are all over the body. Tumors are in its joints.
[1:51:54.040 --> 1:51:55.040]  It lives an agonizing life.
[1:51:55.040 --> 1:51:57.040]  It gets where it can't walk anymore.
[1:51:57.040 --> 1:52:01.040]  But it lets it live long enough to be processed for food production.
[1:52:01.040 --> 1:52:08.040]  And just this year, the FDA legalized feeding people tumor meat that's almost 100% tumor.
[1:52:08.040 --> 1:52:09.040]  I'm going to say that again.
[1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:11.040]  Living dead chickens.
[1:52:11.040 --> 1:52:14.040]  Even China kills their Merrick's disease chickens.
[1:52:14.040 --> 1:52:15.040]  Not America.
[1:52:15.040 --> 1:52:26.040]  You are served Merrick's disease chickens that are almost completely living blob tumors.
[1:52:26.040 --> 1:52:28.040]  They know what they're doing.
[1:52:28.040 --> 1:52:31.040]  That's why all the epidemiologists and top science Nobel Prize winners said,
[1:52:31.040 --> 1:52:35.040]  within three years, a lot of the folks that take the shot are going to die.
[1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:36.040]  And why?
[1:52:36.040 --> 1:52:38.040]  Because it then creates an autoimmune response.
[1:52:38.040 --> 1:52:43.040]  When you come in contact with a spike protein that is on almost all standard cold viruses,
[1:52:43.040 --> 1:52:47.040]  your body, like getting a bee sting, is going to go into anaphylactic shock.
[1:52:47.040 --> 1:52:49.040]  And that's just one of the syndrome.
[1:52:49.040 --> 1:52:51.040]  And what do the same scientists predict?
[1:52:51.040 --> 1:52:57.040]  They said blood clots, strokes, heart attacks, bleeding in the lungs, infertility.
[1:52:57.040 --> 1:52:59.040]  They know what's happening.
[1:52:59.040 --> 1:53:00.040]  PBS NewsHour.
[1:53:00.040 --> 1:53:04.040]  This chicken vaccine makes it virus more dangerous.
[1:53:04.040 --> 1:53:08.040]  This chicken vaccine makes its virus more dangerous.
[1:53:08.040 --> 1:53:12.040]  But you show your National Geographic, would you like that?
[1:53:12.040 --> 1:53:13.040]  What do you think?
[1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:17.040]  You know, guys, it's in a John Bowne video.
[1:53:17.040 --> 1:53:23.040]  And it's footage from last year that he just happened to put in there.
[1:53:23.040 --> 1:53:27.040]  That I think we should play a short clip of right now if you can cue it up on short notice.
[1:53:27.040 --> 1:53:29.040]  Because it says it all.
[1:53:29.040 --> 1:53:34.040]  Pretty exact name of that John Bowne report.
[1:53:34.040 --> 1:53:37.040]  Yes, it was number 17, absolutely.
[1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:42.040]  So, no, that's not it.
[1:53:42.040 --> 1:53:45.040]  Number 17 is not a John Bowne report.
[1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:47.040]  Oh, I'll just get overheated here on the show.
[1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:48.040]  It's not the Curtis Falls.
[1:53:48.040 --> 1:53:50.040]  Let me just focus my mind.
[1:53:50.040 --> 1:53:54.040]  In the first five minutes of this segment, we played a John Bowne report.
[1:53:54.040 --> 1:53:59.040]  And I noticed in that John Bowne report something very, very interesting.
[1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:02.040]  He played an old clip of them last year saying, we're crazy.
[1:54:02.040 --> 1:54:08.040]  Bill Gates wants us to basically die.
[1:54:08.040 --> 1:54:10.040]  And Bill Gates released the virus.
[1:54:10.040 --> 1:54:16.040]  And I thought it was very interesting that now over a year later, it's actually come out in the news.
[1:54:16.040 --> 1:54:17.040]  Love for you next segment.
[1:54:17.040 --> 1:54:24.040]  It's actually come out in the news that Bill Gates funded the Wuhan lab.
[1:54:24.040 --> 1:54:26.040]  And that's where it came from, gain a function.
[1:54:26.040 --> 1:54:29.040]  And they wanted to release it in the general public, which they did.
[1:54:29.040 --> 1:54:31.040]  I mean, it's just open and shut.
[1:54:31.040 --> 1:54:34.040]  And I remember us a year and a half ago saying Bill Gates is behind it.
[1:54:34.040 --> 1:54:35.040]  Look, he's behind it.
[1:54:35.040 --> 1:54:36.040]  We even found the documents.
[1:54:36.040 --> 1:54:40.040]  But now it's the smoking gun of the gain of function coronavirus.
[1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:43.040]  Four viruses combined with an HIV virus.
[1:54:43.040 --> 1:54:44.040]  It's absolutely incredible.
[1:54:44.040 --> 1:54:47.040]  So we'll have that clip for you coming up next segment.
[1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:56.040]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, we finally got one of our best selling products back in stock.
[1:54:56.040 --> 1:54:57.040]  We did one run of this.
[1:54:57.040 --> 1:55:01.040]  It's sold out in a few months.
[1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:03.040]  It got five star reviews because it's so strong.
[1:55:03.040 --> 1:55:06.040]  And now we got it back because of the supply chain breakdowns.
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:09.040]  It's been five, six months since we had it.
[1:55:09.040 --> 1:55:12.040]  And that's a down and out liquid sleep formula back in stock.
[1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:16.040]  It's way stronger than knockout and knockouts great.
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:20.040]  Eight different known herbs that naturally give you deep restful sleep.
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:21.040]  Well, guess what?
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:26.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we know how down and out liquid sleep formula back in stock.
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:28.040]  It's got malaria and root extract.
[1:55:28.040 --> 1:55:33.040]  Traditionally used as far back as ancient Greece and Rome as a medical herb and prominent Greek physician.
[1:55:33.040 --> 1:55:37.040]  Gallon used it for sleeplessness.
[1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:43.040]  Lemon balm, another traditional tea used for thousands of years to help soothe one's mind before bedtime.
[1:55:43.040 --> 1:55:50.040]  German chamomile traditionally used since prehistoric times as bedtime tea to calm the nerves, promote a healthy sleep pattern.
[1:55:50.040 --> 1:55:54.040]  Passion and flour traditionally used by Native Americans, including the Cherokee.
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:58.040]  The herb is used for centuries known for its relaxing herbal qualities.
[1:55:58.040 --> 1:56:02.040]  In recent centuries, the herb has gained popularity with modern European studies.
[1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:11.040]  Melatonin, a hormone used by the body's pineal gland that is absolutely essential in the function of controlling sleep and wake cycles.
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:14.040]  Foods like meats and fruits contain melatonin in very small amounts.
[1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:19.040]  This is a strong organic dose of it and a lot more.
[1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:26.040]  So it is back in stock, ladies and gentlemen at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:29.040]  So is knockout, which is a different formula.
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:31.040]  And it's excellent as well.
[1:56:31.040 --> 1:56:34.040]  But when you take one of these formulas a long time, it stops having as big an effect.
[1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:37.040]  So you go off one for a while, go another for a while.
[1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:42.040]  The stuff that's over the counter they push has alcohol and chemicals in it to make you sleep that screws up your body.
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:46.040]  This has no alcohol in it, ladies and gentlemen, and it works incredibly good.
[1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:49.040]  Deep, long, restful sleep.
[1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:54.040]  I haven't slept like I was, you know, 12 years old in years till I got on this and knockout would help me.
[1:56:54.040 --> 1:56:56.040]  I still get up once or twice.
[1:56:56.040 --> 1:57:04.040]  I take a good dose of this, get to bed, man, I'll sleep seven, eight hours and wake up just like we feel so good, so refreshed.
[1:57:04.040 --> 1:57:08.040]  And that's why I've had so much more energy lately because it's been sold out for months and months and months.
[1:57:08.040 --> 1:57:12.040]  Finally got it back as select bottle a few weeks ago and got back on it.
[1:57:12.040 --> 1:57:14.040]  The full shipment came in last weekend.
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:18.040]  So down and out is here. Get yours at infowarstore.com.
[1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:21.040]  And I went ahead and just extended it even though it's going to sell out.
[1:57:21.040 --> 1:57:24.040]  Ultra 12 and Winner's Center both 50% off as well.
[1:57:24.040 --> 1:57:26.040]  X2 is 50% off.
[1:57:26.040 --> 1:57:30.040]  And we also have the greens sprouts formula.
[1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:33.040]  It's going to sell out in a few days, but I'm still doing it 50% off as well.
[1:57:33.040 --> 1:57:36.040]  That funds our operation at infowarstore.com.
[1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:39.040]  And I really appreciate you keeping us all on air.
[1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:43.040]  All right, we'll be right back with that preacher I was going to have on yesterday that got arrested for not closing his church.
[1:57:43.040 --> 1:57:49.040]  Okay, let's talk about the bio pros and how they're creating amazing products.
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:54.040]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio remediation products,
[1:57:54.040 --> 1:57:58.040]  bringing industrial level technology to the everyday consumer.
[1:57:58.040 --> 1:58:02.040]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:06.040]  The bio pros are excited to release BioDrain Pro,
[1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:11.040]  a product specifically designed to establish healthy drains, pipes and overall plumbing systems.
[1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:18.040]  BioDrain Pro digests grease, fats, oil, sludge, paper and organic matter with ease.
[1:58:18.040 --> 1:58:25.040]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs and is safe for black-gray holding tanks, sewer hoses and plumbing.
[1:58:25.040 --> 1:58:27.040]  It is also human and animal safe.
[1:58:27.040 --> 1:58:31.040]  Get up to 20 treatments with the scoop for easy applications.
[1:58:31.040 --> 1:58:35.040]  Say goodbye to drain problems, gas buildup and odor,
[1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:42.040]  geron tea, just pour and add water. It's that simple. Visit thebiofros.com and see for yourself.
[1:58:42.040 --> 1:58:48.040]  When Bob Woodward's new book came out,
[1:58:48.040 --> 1:58:52.040]  alleging that General Milley had called the head of the Chinese military and said,
[1:58:52.040 --> 1:58:55.040]  Trump might nuke you if you try to overthrow the U.S. government,
[1:58:55.040 --> 1:58:59.040]  but basically I'm protecting you and I'll warn you if we launch an attack,
[1:58:59.040 --> 1:59:03.040]  which was the greatest trees in the U.S. history that has ever been committed.
[1:59:03.040 --> 1:59:05.040]  People said, oh, Alex, it must not be true.
[1:59:05.040 --> 1:59:07.040]  I might wait. Bob Woodward's former naval intelligence.
[1:59:07.040 --> 1:59:09.040]  He's a big insider globalist.
[1:59:09.040 --> 1:59:12.040]  He wouldn't have put this out unless they wanted to put it out,
[1:59:12.040 --> 1:59:15.040]  say that Billy was a hero to set the precedent.
[1:59:15.040 --> 1:59:18.040]  You can have a permanent bureaucracy, stay behind network each day,
[1:59:18.040 --> 1:59:21.040]  basically that has its own bureaucratic coup over America.
[1:59:21.040 --> 1:59:22.040]  That's what they put by then.
[1:59:22.040 --> 1:59:25.040]  He's so incredibly weak to undermine the idea of the presidency.
[1:59:25.040 --> 1:59:28.040]  Well, people said I was making it up with Bob Woodward's line.
[1:59:28.040 --> 1:59:30.040]  Well, now Milley admits he did it.
[1:59:30.040 --> 1:59:32.040]  You see, I didn't need to trust Bob Woodward.
[1:59:32.040 --> 1:59:34.040]  I remember Pelosi on January 8th,
[1:59:34.040 --> 1:59:38.040]  ragging that she'd gotten a call from Milley that he'd taken control of the nooks.
[1:59:38.040 --> 1:59:41.040]  So this treason was hiding and playing to you back then and we covered it.
[1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:44.040]  See, I have a memory, folks. I remember all this stuff.
[1:59:44.040 --> 2:00:12.040]  Now it's true and what's false.
[2:00:12.040 --> 2:00:16.040]  Well, you read the history books and you hear about times of tyranny.
[2:00:16.040 --> 2:00:19.040]  When you're living in a free country, you tend to take it for granted.
[2:00:19.040 --> 2:00:21.040]  You think, man, that's crazy.
[2:00:21.040 --> 2:00:23.040]  That sounds like a comic book. That can't happen here.
[2:00:23.040 --> 2:00:25.040]  Well, it is happening here.
[2:00:25.040 --> 2:00:29.040]  And if you live in a place like Texas or Florida or South Dakota,
[2:00:29.040 --> 2:00:31.040]  you're still in somewhat of a free country.
[2:00:31.040 --> 2:00:33.040]  You're surveilled illegally by big tech.
[2:00:33.040 --> 2:00:38.040]  You're taxed by a federal government that's owned by firing globalist interest.
[2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:41.040]  You know, you're made to pay for illegal aliens and all the rest of it,
[2:00:41.040 --> 2:00:48.040]  but still compared to people in North Korea or people in Australia, you're free.
[2:00:48.040 --> 2:00:51.040]  But slowly, but surely, that's being trampled.
[2:00:51.040 --> 2:00:56.040]  And I have a stack of news here in the United States of people being arrested for their speech
[2:00:56.040 --> 2:01:00.040]  and what they've said and what they do, including the most important of speech.
[2:01:00.040 --> 2:01:05.040]  And when you guys do me a favor, we can't show the actual video of it anymore.
[2:01:05.040 --> 2:01:07.040]  I mean, we can show it from archives.
[2:01:07.040 --> 2:01:11.040]  They had the news center in D.C. They just tore it down.
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:13.040]  Had a giant First Amendment carbon stone on the side.
[2:01:13.040 --> 2:01:16.040]  You guys pull up First Amendment on the side of D.C. Building, farming,
[2:01:16.040 --> 2:01:18.040]  and then just print me the First Amendment, thanks.
[2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:24.040]  And it says Congress shall make no law establishing,
[2:01:24.040 --> 2:01:28.040]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion
[2:01:28.040 --> 2:01:30.040]  or the free exercise thereof.
[2:01:30.040 --> 2:01:34.040]  And then out of all of that comes the basic rights and freedoms.
[2:01:34.040 --> 2:01:36.040]  It doesn't give us our rights.
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:41.040]  It just points out that Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion
[2:01:41.040 --> 2:01:43.040]  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[2:01:43.040 --> 2:01:44.040]  Yeah, there it is.
[2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:48.040]  The removal of the First Amendment from the Newsyam Building is a disheartening sight.
[2:01:48.040 --> 2:01:50.040]  Print that for me, please.
[2:01:50.040 --> 2:01:51.040]  Isn't it funny?
[2:01:51.040 --> 2:01:55.040]  They decided to revamp it and just get rid of that.
[2:01:55.040 --> 2:02:00.040]  You can't have that up there when it's being struck from all of the buildings.
[2:02:00.040 --> 2:02:03.040]  Kind of like when a new Pharaoh would take over that didn't like his predecessor.
[2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:05.040]  He would order it all, all removed.
[2:02:05.040 --> 2:02:07.040]  So Congress shall make no law.
[2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:12.040]  We're going to talk to a pastor about that and tie it into everything else that's happening.
[2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:16.040]  The Marine who got arrested for criticizing the withdrawal.
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:21.040]  I mean, if it's violating common sense of the law, you should criticize illegal orders.
[2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:26.040]  And the pastor, Arthur Pulaski, who flew out of Canada to go to an event with General Flynn,
[2:02:26.040 --> 2:02:27.040]  he got arrested.
[2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:31.040]  You're not allowed to speak out against the lockdown, just like Australia.
[2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:35.040]  You're supposed to sit down and supposed to shut up while all this happens.
[2:02:35.040 --> 2:02:39.040]  But they're preparing FEMA camps here in America for everybody.
[2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:42.040]  So we better do something.
[2:02:42.040 --> 2:02:46.040]  We already live in a digital gulag where Senator Paul gave a speech on the floor
[2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:53.040]  about an Israeli study of natural immunity being 13 to 20 plus times better.
[2:02:53.040 --> 2:02:57.040]  And he got censored by YouTube.
[2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:02.040]  So in our own Senate censored, I just don't know where else we're going.
[2:03:02.040 --> 2:03:09.040]  I don't know what else that we're going to put up with, but we can't sit here and put up with this forever.
[2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:10.040]  We have to fight back.
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:12.040]  That's why I'm working harder than ever worked.
[2:03:12.040 --> 2:03:14.040]  And I'm not saying, oh, aren't I special?
[2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:16.040]  But I'm going to Dallas today.
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:22.040]  I'm going to be on three of the big blaze syndicated programs, including Stephen Crowder tomorrow.
[2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:26.040]  And I'm going to come back tomorrow and I'm going to work after that until about 10 at night.
[2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:31.040]  And the reason I'm going to do that is who knows how long I'll still be able to be on air.
[2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:34.040]  And so you better believe I'm in this fight for myself and my family.
[2:03:34.040 --> 2:03:38.040]  That means I'm in the fight for you because we're all in this together.
[2:03:38.040 --> 2:03:41.040]  We're going to hang together and hang separate like Benjamin Franklin said.
[2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:46.040]  So I'm asking you all to count the cost to realize how serious the situation is
[2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:53.040]  and to redouble your efforts now more than ever done because the globalists aren't going to stop till we stop them.
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:55.040]  They're going to keep pushing and keep grabbing.
[2:03:55.040 --> 2:04:00.040]  We've got a plan to roll out this COVID lockdown until the economy collapses
[2:04:00.040 --> 2:04:03.040]  and we'll be running to the FEMA camps begging for them to take care of us.
[2:04:03.040 --> 2:04:11.040]  That is a real plan, a real program to sabotage society via the cloud and pivot strategy.
[2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:13.040]  And we're here now.
[2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:15.040]  And so that's the message I take to other shows when I do them.
[2:04:15.040 --> 2:04:17.040]  That's the message I hope to raise the alarm.
[2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:18.040]  But not just me.
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:22.040]  You can call into Coast to Coast AM with its giant audience with George Norrie.
[2:04:22.040 --> 2:04:23.040]  He won't censor you.
[2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:24.040]  You can reach millions.
[2:04:24.040 --> 2:04:25.040]  You can call into C-SPAN.
[2:04:25.040 --> 2:04:30.040]  You can call into other shows and talk about these issues and warn people about what's happening.
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:36.040]  Because until Congress and governors and others get this as a global assault and takeover, we don't have a hope.
[2:04:36.040 --> 2:04:41.040]  But the minute we figure out how much trouble we're in, we can turn this all around right now.
[2:04:41.040 --> 2:04:56.040]  Well, they're right back. Stay with us.
[2:04:56.040 --> 2:05:02.040]  And in addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems of these employees.
[2:05:02.040 --> 2:05:09.040]  Because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical energy during your work, during your tasks, whatever it might be,
[2:05:09.040 --> 2:05:13.040]  you're really stressing the cardiopulmonary system because you change the way that you breathe.
[2:05:13.040 --> 2:05:16.040]  You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[2:05:16.040 --> 2:05:19.040]  That taxes the heart. It taxes the lungs.
[2:05:19.040 --> 2:05:27.040]  And we have given people heart attacks by allowing them to work with their mouth and nose covered with absolutely no regulation,
[2:05:27.040 --> 2:05:30.040]  no oversight, no medical oversight.
[2:05:30.040 --> 2:05:34.040]  The globalists have told us we're a disease. They told us they want to eradicate us.
[2:05:34.040 --> 2:05:39.040]  And all the studies show that when you wear these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up to one-third
[2:05:39.040 --> 2:05:43.040]  and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning.
[2:05:43.040 --> 2:05:46.040]  This is a sick cult and we've got to say no.
[2:05:46.040 --> 2:05:50.040]  But the only way the real science is out of the public is if we tell them,
[2:05:50.040 --> 2:05:53.040]  get your copy today of COVIDland and expose them.
[2:05:53.040 --> 2:05:56.040]  It's covidland.com. Go there now.
[2:05:56.040 --> 2:06:06.040]  You thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever,
[2:06:06.040 --> 2:06:11.040]  but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[2:06:11.040 --> 2:06:17.040]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:17.040 --> 2:06:28.040]  So Pastor Tony Spell is in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
[2:06:28.040 --> 2:06:31.040]  You'd think that's a good Christian conservative free speech place.
[2:06:31.040 --> 2:06:36.040]  But his church, for him daring to try to stay open, which they're still saying he's under covid rules,
[2:06:36.040 --> 2:06:39.040]  he's been arrested. They're saying they're going to arrest him again.
[2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:43.040]  Here he is coming out of jail in the North Korea that is Baton Rouge.
[2:06:43.040 --> 2:06:47.040]  Don't get in trouble, guys.
[2:06:47.040 --> 2:06:53.040]  They hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal
[2:06:53.040 --> 2:06:58.040]  and are endowed by the Creator with certain unalienable rights.
[2:06:58.040 --> 2:07:03.040]  My rights to have church and to preach to God for the Jesus Christ
[2:07:03.040 --> 2:07:08.040]  are endowed to me by my Creator, not my district attorney,
[2:07:08.040 --> 2:07:13.040]  not my chief of police, and not my governor, John Bel Edwards,
[2:07:13.040 --> 2:07:16.040]  not my president, and not my department of justice.
[2:07:16.040 --> 2:07:21.040]  My unalienable rights are given to me by God,
[2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:25.040]  and those rights are my rights to assemble and have church.
[2:07:25.040 --> 2:07:28.040]  I cannot give up those rights.
[2:07:28.040 --> 2:07:31.040]  God forbids me to give up those rights.
[2:07:31.040 --> 2:07:34.040]  I will not give up my right to have church.
[2:07:34.040 --> 2:07:38.040]  I will not give up my right to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2:07:38.040 --> 2:07:41.040]  I was arrested by the Central Police Department this morning.
[2:07:41.040 --> 2:07:45.040]  I was led into a trap.
[2:07:45.040 --> 2:07:48.040]  A half a dozen officers handcuffed me,
[2:07:48.040 --> 2:07:52.040]  put me in the back of the car, and put me into East Baton Rouge Harris prison.
[2:07:52.040 --> 2:07:59.040]  While I was in the prison, I preached to the inmates.
[2:07:59.040 --> 2:08:02.040]  When the guards used profanity, I said,
[2:08:02.040 --> 2:08:06.040]  every time you use profanity, I'm going to quote a scripture.
[2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:16.040]  It went quiet in that jail cell, and then I preached to people.
[2:08:16.040 --> 2:08:23.040]  And I want to give hope to every Christian in this nation today.
[2:08:23.040 --> 2:08:27.040]  You don't let anybody take your rights to go to church.
[2:08:27.040 --> 2:08:30.040]  You don't let anybody take your rights to assemble.
[2:08:30.040 --> 2:08:32.040]  You stand strong.
[2:08:32.040 --> 2:08:34.040]  You stand strong.
[2:08:34.040 --> 2:08:40.040]  And don't ever forget that Jesus Christ is the savior of this world.
[2:08:40.040 --> 2:08:46.040]  I am not guilty of any charges that I have been accused of.
[2:08:46.040 --> 2:08:51.040]  I am not guilty of assault with a deadly weapon.
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:56.040]  I am not guilty of defying any orders.
[2:08:56.040 --> 2:09:00.040]  The first thing I'm guilty of is practicing my faith,
[2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:04.040]  which was given to me by Jesus Christ Himself.
[2:09:04.040 --> 2:09:06.040]  Amen!
[2:09:11.040 --> 2:09:17.040]  And we are joined by Pastor Tony Spell at LTCBR.com.
[2:09:17.040 --> 2:09:22.040]  Now there are platforming preachers that defy the lockdowns in Europe and the United States.
[2:09:22.040 --> 2:09:25.040]  So Big Tech is the watchdog with the state.
[2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:28.040]  It's a symbol of the muzzle and that you're in the death cult.
[2:09:28.040 --> 2:09:31.040]  That you bind the fraud, that you bind the lie, that you're dirty, you're evil,
[2:09:31.040 --> 2:09:35.040]  and you need the state to be your God, your new religion to put something in your body
[2:09:35.040 --> 2:09:42.040]  to make you pure, like the Holy Spirit, but it's a deadly vaccine from Pfizer.
[2:09:42.040 --> 2:09:45.040]  I'm going to play the clip next segment for the pastor of the new installed
[2:09:45.040 --> 2:09:50.040]  unelected governor of New York saying, she's the priest.
[2:09:50.040 --> 2:09:54.040]  You're her disciples. God gave us the shot. Go out and take it.
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:09:58.040]  You must have to buy or sell. Sounds like something from the devil.
[2:09:58.040 --> 2:10:02.040]  Sounds like the work of the devil to me, but they have removed the First Amendment
[2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:07.040]  off the Washington, D.C. downtown building where it's been for 30 years.
[2:10:07.040 --> 2:10:11.040]  The removal of the First Amendment from the Newsyam building is at its heartening site.
[2:10:11.040 --> 2:10:14.040]  And why did they remove it? Because it says in the First Amendment,
[2:10:14.040 --> 2:10:18.040]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:23.040]  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech
[2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:28.040]  or the press or of the right of the people to peacefully to assemble
[2:10:28.040 --> 2:10:31.040]  and to petition the government for a redress of grievance.
[2:10:31.040 --> 2:10:33.040]  They have no jurisdiction over churches.
[2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:37.040]  It's how the Hopi Indians can take peyote and can't get in trouble when it's illegal.
[2:10:37.040 --> 2:10:39.040]  It's their religion. What are the saints to say?
[2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:41.040]  We're going to kill babies for our religion.
[2:10:41.040 --> 2:10:43.040]  The courts say, even kill babies, it's your religion.
[2:10:43.040 --> 2:10:45.040]  But Christians can't operate.
[2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:47.040]  Walmart and the topless bar can be open.
[2:10:47.040 --> 2:10:49.040]  The steakhouse can be open, but not the church.
[2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:52.040]  They want that power over the First Amendment.
[2:10:52.040 --> 2:10:56.040]  They don't want people coming together and opening up to God because then
[2:10:56.040 --> 2:10:59.040]  that brings in the Holy Spirit. It is a ritual. They hate it.
[2:10:59.040 --> 2:11:01.040]  They do their rituals. We've got ours.
[2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:04.040]  So Pastor Tony Spell joins us to talk about what's happening.
[2:11:04.040 --> 2:11:06.040]  Thank you so much, Pastor.
[2:11:06.040 --> 2:11:09.040]  Thank you, Alex. It's good to be with you today.
[2:11:09.040 --> 2:11:11.040]  You bring up a tremendous point.
[2:11:11.040 --> 2:11:17.040]  The First Amendment does not give us our rights to go to church and to practice our religion.
[2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:21.040]  It was put there by our framers to protect our rights,
[2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:23.040]  our rights to go to church,
[2:11:23.040 --> 2:11:28.040]  easily assemble, exercise our religious practices freely,
[2:11:28.040 --> 2:11:31.040]  or endow to us by God, our Creator.
[2:11:31.040 --> 2:11:34.040]  Thomas Jefferson in his history and remonstrance said,
[2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:38.040]  religion is man's duty to God, his Creator.
[2:11:38.040 --> 2:11:42.040]  Of course, 19 months ago in March, 2020,
[2:11:42.040 --> 2:11:45.040]  when we were arrested on several different occasions
[2:11:45.040 --> 2:11:50.040]  for failure to comply with the governor's emergency orders,
[2:11:50.040 --> 2:11:53.040]  which was holding church during a pandemic,
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:57.040]  and arrested, booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish prison year
[2:11:57.040 --> 2:12:01.040]  and placed on house arrest whenever we bonded out of jail,
[2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:03.040]  forbidden to leave.
[2:12:03.040 --> 2:12:09.040]  And of course, we left on many, many different occasions to go and preach in the church,
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:14.040]  at which time we were arrested each time when we would break the house arrest.
[2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:18.040]  So as Christians in America today,
[2:12:18.040 --> 2:12:21.040]  we have a constitutional right.
[2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:28.040]  However, God has a command that is stronger than mandates or even amendments.
[2:12:28.040 --> 2:12:34.040]  You know, Moses' parents broke Pharaoh's law and would not murder him.
[2:12:34.040 --> 2:12:37.040]  Pharaoh said, kill every baby boy.
[2:12:37.040 --> 2:12:40.040]  But they said, we're not going to kill our baby boy.
[2:12:40.040 --> 2:12:46.040]  And you have Daniel who refused to quit praying for a 30-day process.
[2:12:46.040 --> 2:12:51.040]  And when he was faced with the decision, it didn't take him long to declare,
[2:12:51.040 --> 2:12:55.040]  he'd rather sleep with limes and spend one day without prayer.
[2:12:55.040 --> 2:12:57.040]  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abandigo.
[2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:02.040]  And now, people in my church are being terminated from their jobs
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:05.040]  just because they come through the doors of our local assembly.
[2:13:05.040 --> 2:13:11.040]  These are men, women, black, white, all types of different occupations.
[2:13:11.040 --> 2:13:17.040]  Did you imagine going into your job and being terminated because you go to church in America?
[2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:19.040]  It's because you know why they want it, Pastor.
[2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:21.040]  They want division. They want racial division.
[2:13:21.040 --> 2:13:23.040]  It's in all their internal documents.
[2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:25.040]  This is a globalist, Marxist, Leninist takeover.
[2:13:25.040 --> 2:13:29.040]  And they know there's loving groups of people of all races and creeds
[2:13:29.040 --> 2:13:32.040]  unified by the blood of Jesus meeting everywhere across this country
[2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:35.040]  that are getting real counseling and real love and real community.
[2:13:35.040 --> 2:13:36.040]  And they want to end that.
[2:13:36.040 --> 2:13:38.040]  They want us depressed and alone in the dark.
[2:13:38.040 --> 2:13:40.040]  That's their mission.
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:42.040]  And they're accomplishing it.
[2:13:42.040 --> 2:13:43.040]  They are dividing us.
[2:13:43.040 --> 2:13:47.040]  We're at the most divided time in our history.
[2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:49.040]  There are two classes of people today,
[2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:52.040]  vaxed and unvaxed, masked and unmasked.
[2:13:52.040 --> 2:13:57.040]  This is godless, appointed governor in New York
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:00.040]  who wears a necklace that says vaccinated.
[2:14:00.040 --> 2:14:02.040]  If you were a Christian, you may wear a cross.
[2:14:02.040 --> 2:14:06.040]  If you were a different religion, you may wear that insignia.
[2:14:06.040 --> 2:14:11.040]  It is her religion and her religion is based in Revelation the 13th
[2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:12.040]  chapter and the 17th verse.
[2:14:12.040 --> 2:14:16.040]  No man might buy or sell, save.
[2:14:16.040 --> 2:14:18.040]  That is apocalyptic literature.
[2:14:18.040 --> 2:14:23.040]  They are forbidding us to go into places of business, restaurants,
[2:14:23.040 --> 2:14:24.040]  go into our jobs.
[2:14:24.040 --> 2:14:28.040]  People are being terminated because they are not vaxed.
[2:14:28.040 --> 2:14:33.040]  That is apocalyptic literature that the Antichrist system.
[2:14:33.040 --> 2:14:38.040]  Joe Biden is not bewitched with the Antichrist spirit.
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:43.040]  Joe Biden is possessed with demons that wants to destroy our nation.
[2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:49.040]  And his vice president and congress and senator all under the same
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:53.040]  Antichrist rule with all deceivableness of unrighteousness
[2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:55.040]  and them that perish.
[2:14:55.040 --> 2:14:59.040]  But there is a people that they are never going to change
[2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:01.040]  because we refuse to comply.
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:04.040]  We resist at all costs.
[2:15:04.040 --> 2:15:06.040]  Even if it means being imprisoned.
[2:15:06.040 --> 2:15:09.040]  You see this godless governor in New York.
[2:15:09.040 --> 2:15:13.040]  She is almost as wicked as King Edwards here in Louisiana.
[2:15:13.040 --> 2:15:15.040]  And they all have that satanic gleam in their eye.
[2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:16.040]  You can just see it.
[2:15:16.040 --> 2:15:20.040]  They look like an animatronic robot at Chuck E. Cheese.
[2:15:20.040 --> 2:15:25.040]  They are the pied pipers of hell that says God is not pleased with us
[2:15:25.040 --> 2:15:27.040]  because we are not vaccinated.
[2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:32.040]  No. God is not pleased with them because while they say
[2:15:32.040 --> 2:15:35.040]  we are not preaching love and loving our neighbor
[2:15:35.040 --> 2:15:38.040]  they are murdering millions and millions of babies.
[2:15:38.040 --> 2:15:41.040]  They are condoning same sex marriage.
[2:15:41.040 --> 2:15:45.040]  They are terminating nurses who for the past 19 months
[2:15:45.040 --> 2:15:47.040]  have put their life on the line.
[2:15:47.040 --> 2:15:51.040]  And now because they want vax they are being fired.
[2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:52.040]  Where is love?
[2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:55.040]  Esther stay there. You are on fire. Stay there brother.
[2:15:55.040 --> 2:15:59.040]  Hey everybody. Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[2:15:59.040 --> 2:16:00.040]  Me too.
[2:16:00.040 --> 2:16:03.040]  But listen. After all the research, all the conflicting studies
[2:16:03.040 --> 2:16:07.040]  after all the squabbling there is one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:11.040]  It is that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[2:16:11.040 --> 2:16:13.040]  You probably already believe that.
[2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:14.040]  I certainly do.
[2:16:14.040 --> 2:16:15.040]  So here is the thing.
[2:16:15.040 --> 2:16:19.040]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances
[2:16:19.040 --> 2:16:24.040]  actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[2:16:24.040 --> 2:16:27.040]  Now you will have to sign a waiver but you can check out what I have discovered
[2:16:27.040 --> 2:16:29.040]  at StrongerDefense.com.
[2:16:29.040 --> 2:16:31.040]  No cures or treatments there.
[2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:34.040]  Instead little known but shocking immune system research.
[2:16:34.040 --> 2:16:39.040]  And a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called
[2:16:39.040 --> 2:16:40.040]  Immune10x.

[2:18:18.440 --> 2:18:25.400]  For the next 15 days to flatten the can, I also need you to wear masks,
[2:18:25.400 --> 2:18:33.080]  and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations. That way we can consolidate
[2:18:33.080 --> 2:18:41.320]  control and bankrupt the world economy, even company the only I own profitable.
[2:18:41.320 --> 2:18:48.280]  You will then be my slaves. And if you get that special shot and get him from
[2:18:48.280 --> 2:18:54.840]  Oprah, we'll move your immune system to be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[2:18:56.920 --> 2:19:01.560]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently
[2:19:01.560 --> 2:19:05.720]  measure what's happening in the atmosphere. But if you look at all different studies
[2:19:05.720 --> 2:19:08.600]  and reports about my NASA and other governments and other agencies,
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:13.240]  they all disagree on what's really happening with climate. The only constant,
[2:19:13.240 --> 2:19:20.520]  the only great truth is change is the only constant. So yes, climate change is totally real.
[2:19:20.520 --> 2:19:24.280]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then
[2:19:24.280 --> 2:19:27.400]  it's going to be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[2:19:27.400 --> 2:19:31.560]  Okay, now it's just climate change. But did you know that manmade climate change
[2:19:32.280 --> 2:19:38.200]  is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates
[2:19:38.200 --> 2:19:43.880]  and the UN? They have weather control trees for 1979. Bill Gates has been manipulating the
[2:19:43.880 --> 2:19:48.760]  weather for a very long time. In fact, back in 1994, two scientists wanted a Nobel Prize
[2:19:48.760 --> 2:19:52.600]  for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[2:19:52.600 --> 2:20:16.440]  So yes, manmade climate change is real. When the Lieutenant Colonel from the Marine Corps
[2:20:16.440 --> 2:20:23.720]  watched them by design collapsing Afghanistan and giving 80 plus billion dollars of weapons to them,
[2:20:24.520 --> 2:20:29.160]  he said we had a plan to actually pull out of here without this. This is a dereliction of duty,
[2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:34.040]  which it was. And he's now in the brig awaiting trial for that. You can say, well,
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:38.520]  you know, he's in the military, so he doesn't have free speech. I differ with that. When you're
[2:20:38.520 --> 2:20:41.560]  given illegal orders or you see something that's criminal, you better speak out against it.
[2:20:41.560 --> 2:20:48.600]  Like the CIA on record supplying little children to Afghan warlords who were pedophiles because
[2:20:48.600 --> 2:20:53.800]  they quote, liked that type of person better, more easily controlled. So that's the problem
[2:20:53.800 --> 2:21:00.120]  with that Lieutenant Colonel. He didn't support pedophilia. And that's where all this is going.
[2:21:00.120 --> 2:21:04.840]  Marine who blasted Afghan withdrawal being held in military, lock up ahead of trial,
[2:21:04.840 --> 2:21:07.720]  even though for this type of charge, you would normally be held in jail.
[2:21:07.720 --> 2:21:14.120]  And then you've got Arthur Pulaski. He's been arrested what three or four times now up in Canada
[2:21:14.120 --> 2:21:17.960]  for still having his churches. That's the one thing they don't let open. They're not just
[2:21:17.960 --> 2:21:23.560]  doing something that violates our religious rights. They're particularly singling everyone out.
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:31.480]  And that's what we're talking about with Pastor Tony Spell here today of LTCBR.com.
[2:21:31.480 --> 2:21:36.280]  And he's been arrested for his church. And now they're trying to charge you with made up stuff of
[2:21:36.280 --> 2:21:40.520]  he almost hit a woman, didn't touch her with his car, but almost did. Don't you love it? The
[2:21:40.520 --> 2:21:47.080]  borders are wide open, giant child sex trafficking, all the massive crime happening. The police in
[2:21:47.080 --> 2:21:51.560]  most parts of the U.S. won't respond to regular crime. Even Austin said they won't respond to
[2:21:51.560 --> 2:21:56.760]  most crime now to save and cut back to nothing. But you didn't hit a woman with a car, but they
[2:21:56.760 --> 2:22:01.960]  said you got close. And so you're being charged with that too. I mean, they really got it out for
[2:22:01.960 --> 2:22:09.720]  you. I thought Matt & Rouge was the Bible Belt. What happened? No, King Edwards, who is a Democrat,
[2:22:09.720 --> 2:22:20.680]  baby-killing God hater, is redefining what the Bible Belt is. So his judges here at the 19th
[2:22:20.680 --> 2:22:28.920]  Judicial Court looked at me behind their mask and said, I forbid you to preach to your congregation.
[2:22:28.920 --> 2:22:36.680]  It is unlawful. And you and nine people in the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans
[2:22:37.320 --> 2:22:42.920]  are out of compliance with the governor's orders. He said, you can preach in your closet in your
[2:22:42.920 --> 2:22:49.000]  home all day. But he said, do not assemble. Of course, that violates the First Amendment,
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:55.720]  the right of the people to peaceably assemble. So what John Bel Edwards is attempting to do
[2:22:55.720 --> 2:23:01.560]  with his mask mandates and his vaccine mandates is take more and more and more money from the
[2:23:01.560 --> 2:23:09.880]  federal government. They are actually operating in an anti-God, anti-constitutional government.
[2:23:09.880 --> 2:23:17.160]  Daniel chapter 2 and verse 21, the Antichrist seeks to change the times and the seasons.
[2:23:17.160 --> 2:23:25.720]  In Daniel 7 and 25, he tells us that he seeks to change the laws. And what's happening is,
[2:23:25.720 --> 2:23:31.400]  with their unlawful, illegal orders, nothing that they're doing is lawful. They're the biggest
[2:23:31.400 --> 2:23:37.240]  lawbreakers that have ever been put into power. And let's be clear, the Bill of Rights is the
[2:23:37.240 --> 2:23:42.280]  highest law of the land. Nothing is supposed to be able to trump it in a republic. You're supposed
[2:23:42.280 --> 2:23:46.680]  to have a constitutional convention where what, two-thirds of the states vote to repeal something
[2:23:46.680 --> 2:23:51.880]  like that. So that is the hardest thing to change. They don't have the jurisdiction. It's very clear.
[2:23:51.880 --> 2:23:57.560]  It's like murders illegal, kidnappings illegal, violating the First Amendment illegal. The country
[2:23:57.560 --> 2:24:02.760]  was set up around religious freedom and then the right to self-defense. Religious freedom is the
[2:24:02.760 --> 2:24:11.080]  number one ace of spades in the card deck of rights. So how can a judge forbid me a pastor to
[2:24:11.080 --> 2:24:17.560]  preach? He's the judicial branch. That is reserved for the legislative branch, Congress, and they
[2:24:17.560 --> 2:24:24.680]  cannot make a law respecting an establishment of religion. June the 7th, we actually won a case
[2:24:24.680 --> 2:24:31.080]  in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. It's not being broadcasted, but three liberal judges ruled
[2:24:31.080 --> 2:24:37.880]  in our favor that our establishment clause was violated for exercise free speech and our assembly
[2:24:37.880 --> 2:24:44.200]  clause was violated. Of course, with that win, we have to go back through Judge Roy Moore, Chief
[2:24:44.200 --> 2:24:50.120]  Justice Roy Moore, who's my head legal representation and Attorney Jeff Wittenbrink. We have to go
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:54.520]  back through all the process of the Louisiana federal court, Supreme Court, and we actually have
[2:24:54.520 --> 2:25:01.080]  one case in the United States Supreme Court right now. But with all of that, these people do not
[2:25:01.080 --> 2:25:07.320]  have the right, especially the executive branch, a governor, a president, that do not have the right
[2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:13.960]  or the authority. They're usurping authority just as their leader Satan did in the beginning,
[2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:20.120]  which was why God cast him out of heaven, profane to the sides of hell he went. That's what our
[2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:24.920]  government is representing today. And let's be clear, Pastor, because I know you know more
[2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:28.200]  about this than I do, but just experiencing it and living in these beginning and the end times,
[2:25:28.200 --> 2:25:33.880]  I believe, the devil tries to get rid of free will. The Satanist advertised, oh, the freedom is over
[2:25:33.880 --> 2:25:37.720]  here, but the truth is the devil tries to take all the freedom away. It's God gave us the freedom.
[2:25:38.600 --> 2:25:46.200]  He did. Those rights to assemble and go to church are endowed by our creator. The 13 original colonies
[2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:52.280]  did not have a constitution. Whenever they stood up against King George, they fled here at the
[2:25:52.280 --> 2:25:57.880]  average rate of two and a half miles per hour from Europe because of their lack to practice their
[2:25:57.880 --> 2:26:03.240]  religious freely. So that's what happened. That's why America was formed on Judeo-Christian
[2:26:03.240 --> 2:26:10.120]  principles. You know, whenever Judge Fred T. Graffasi forbade me to preach because of the
[2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:18.520]  governor's orders, who is he to tell me what I can and cannot say? God give us men. Times like
[2:26:18.520 --> 2:26:24.520]  this demand strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands. Men who can stand before these
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:31.080]  demigods and damn their treacherous flatteries without winking. King Edwards there, John Bel Edwards,
[2:26:31.080 --> 2:26:39.000]  who is a Democratic governor here in Louisiana, said, maybe after I was arrested on my sixth
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:46.440]  occasion, he said, maybe this will get the pastor's attention. And then he and the mayor share Weston
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:54.040]  Broome in Baton Rouge said, just don't go back to that church, that church, quote unquote. We run 36
[2:26:54.040 --> 2:27:00.920]  buses over a 40 mile radius every Sunday morning and pick up an average of 650 children for
[2:27:00.920 --> 2:27:07.000]  church where we feed them, we give them Sunday school, we give them Jesus, we help them throughout.
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:11.960]  And that's what they want to shut off. I mean, I know so many atheists and agnostics now seeing
[2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:17.320]  Satanism, World Government, Market of the Beast, Medical ID cards, social credit scores. It's really
[2:27:17.320 --> 2:27:25.400]  waking a lot of people up right now to actually see revelation being made manifest. It is. The
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:31.720]  Antichrist spirit is working right now with all deceivableness of unrighteousness. And then that
[2:27:31.720 --> 2:27:38.360]  parish, the Bible calls it in 2nd Thessalonians two and seven, the mystery of iniquity or the sin
[2:27:38.360 --> 2:27:46.600]  of lawlessness. It is actually unlawful for us to give up our native rights and not protect the
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:51.160]  freedoms. That's right. The crampling of our freedoms is the greatest lawlessness ever. And
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:56.280]  the sacrament is killing babies, crampling our rights to freedom, shutting us down, telling us
[2:27:56.280 --> 2:28:02.600]  don't look at the sunset, telling us to talk to our neighbors. This is a cult. It is a cult. Why
[2:28:02.600 --> 2:28:09.400]  after 19 months of the largest gatherings in the United States of America, people have come from
[2:28:10.200 --> 2:28:15.240]  several different continents into our church to stand with us against the tyrannical government
[2:28:15.240 --> 2:28:22.360]  and because we were arrested so many times. Why have I not had one COVID death in my church
[2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:27.720]  with thousands of people gathering three times a week, 27 different nationalities,
[2:28:27.720 --> 2:28:34.920]  black, white, brown, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, no masks, no vaccines,
[2:28:34.920 --> 2:28:41.960]  where anti-mask and anti-vaccine people will come in afraid there'll be a half a dozen masks in
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:47.480]  the service. But before that church service is over, the masks come off because people realize
[2:28:47.480 --> 2:28:52.600]  what am I doing? Pastor Tony Spell, stay there. This is ribbiting. Give us the answer of what's
[2:28:52.600 --> 2:28:57.400]  happening when we come back. If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your
[2:28:57.400 --> 2:29:03.080]  own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:29:03.080 --> 2:29:09.320]  Here's why. We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock. These emergency backup
[2:29:09.320 --> 2:29:14.680]  systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most. And unlike gas generators,
[2:29:14.680 --> 2:29:20.520]  solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free
[2:29:20.520 --> 2:29:25.800]  electricity from the sun. Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues or just
[2:29:25.800 --> 2:29:30.280]  getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:30.840 --> 2:29:36.920]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too.

[2:30:18.360 --> 2:30:29.000]  And I see the general public in a medically induced, scientifically induced behavioral
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:36.040]  psychologically controlled tranche. And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder
[2:30:36.040 --> 2:30:42.680]  and it's so incredibly sad. But this is the process of birth and then growth and then
[2:30:42.680 --> 2:30:48.760]  falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again. It's just
[2:30:48.760 --> 2:30:53.400]  the globalist art actively trying to steer and control this process of decimence and collapse
[2:30:54.040 --> 2:30:59.000]  to actually end the species as we know it. It is through our five senses that we are kept
[2:30:59.000 --> 2:31:04.760]  fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told. And the only way to see through this illusion
[2:31:04.760 --> 2:31:11.640]  is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem. Consuming too much fluoride
[2:31:11.640 --> 2:31:16.840]  forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions,
[2:31:16.840 --> 2:31:21.720]  natural functions which have been known for millennia. The Hindu chakras align with the
[2:31:21.720 --> 2:31:27.400]  endocrine system. The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye, also described
[2:31:27.400 --> 2:31:33.080]  as the seat of the soul. The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[2:31:33.080 --> 2:31:39.240]  and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality. Fluoride free water is essential to keeping
[2:31:39.240 --> 2:31:45.560]  our pineal gland healthy. Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your
[2:31:45.560 --> 2:31:51.080]  drinking water fluoride free and the propure shower head will seal the deal. Get them both
[2:31:51.080 --> 2:32:00.040]  today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com. Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank
[2:32:00.040 --> 2:32:04.200]  with your face covered? Could you imagine even going into the grocery store? Do you think they
[2:32:04.200 --> 2:32:08.040]  would let you in? Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that
[2:32:08.040 --> 2:32:14.760]  you weren't going to be shoplifting? Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going
[2:32:14.760 --> 2:32:19.160]  inside the little mini-mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on? How far do you think that
[2:32:19.160 --> 2:32:24.360]  would get you? Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with a shield that looks like a
[2:32:24.360 --> 2:32:33.400]  space alien? Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[2:32:33.400 --> 2:32:38.040]  The globalists are running a psychological warfare operation on humanity. Only waking up to the
[2:32:38.040 --> 2:32:43.960]  great reset in its tyranny will save us and the mask is the sign of slavery. We must inform the
[2:32:43.960 --> 2:32:48.200]  public that it's a fraud and that it's dangerous and that it causes major medical issues and it's
[2:32:48.200 --> 2:32:53.960]  dehumanizing and the film Covid Land does that. Secure your copy now at covidland.com and get a

[2:33:01.960 --> 2:33:27.880]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:40.280]  I really appreciate Pastor Tony Spell joining us here today. I apologize. I just had to leave
[2:33:40.280 --> 2:33:44.120]  early but he's here with us now and I really do sometimes want to get down to Baton Rouge
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:47.960]  and go to his church. I want to play the governor of New York and the bizarre stuff she was saying
[2:33:47.960 --> 2:33:54.440]  and get your take on it from a biblical expertise, sir. But just separately, tell us about where your
[2:33:54.440 --> 2:33:59.240]  church is currently, what's happening in other areas. I saw articles saying they may come after
[2:33:59.240 --> 2:34:05.720]  you again. They're trying to claim you tried to run over a lady, just all sorts of desperate
[2:34:05.720 --> 2:34:12.520]  behavior, a fill a sin on how they're persecuting you. So my next court date is October the 13th
[2:34:12.520 --> 2:34:20.600]  then I have one following October the 19th. This morning I was served with six more from the 19th
[2:34:20.600 --> 2:34:26.600]  Judicial District Court at the hands of the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Department.
[2:34:26.600 --> 2:34:32.840]  Basically they say violations of an emergency proclamation, holding church during a pandemic.
[2:34:32.840 --> 2:34:37.960]  While I was in the prison, they trumped up all types of charges against me that one by one
[2:34:37.960 --> 2:34:46.280]  were debunking. Old tickets assault with a deadly weapon which there are protesters across our
[2:34:46.280 --> 2:34:53.080]  front lawn of our church, lots of protesters. Well, the cops would not stop them from grabbing
[2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:58.920]  their crotch using four-letter words to every girl and mother that came into our church,
[2:34:58.920 --> 2:35:05.960]  using racial slurs toward our blacks and our Latinos and saying lots of hateful things. They
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:12.600]  were protected by the police and by the Sheriff's Department and put a restraining order on me from
[2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:18.280]  approaching them. Well, one day I approached them at which point their illegal surveillance,
[2:35:18.280 --> 2:35:23.800]  which by the way is still on my home and my church, right now there are federal cameras
[2:35:23.800 --> 2:35:29.080]  all over my property because they surveil us and want to catch us doing something wrong.
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:35.400]  Well, that's how they trumped up this charge against us for assaulting a protester. Well,
[2:35:37.160 --> 2:35:44.680]  everything is backwards. Isaiah 59 and 17 says judgment is backwards, truth is fallen in the
[2:35:44.680 --> 2:35:52.120]  streets. So we have a command, not a suggestion, not even a recommendation, but from God to resist
[2:35:52.120 --> 2:35:59.640]  and never comply. Daniel 1132 says, and such as do wickedly shall the Antichrist corrupt by
[2:35:59.640 --> 2:36:08.760]  flatteries. That word flatteries means feminism. It means demastualization of mankind. That's what
[2:36:08.760 --> 2:36:14.760]  the mask does. That's what the vaccine does. That's what complying with these inhumane,
[2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:20.200]  ungodly orders does. You're saying Satan conquers this by domesticating us and making us weak?
[2:36:21.240 --> 2:36:28.280]  He does. That's why Pharaoh said murder all the baby boys in Exodus 2. That's why Herod wanted to
[2:36:28.280 --> 2:36:35.000]  kill every baby boy two years and younger to kill Jesus. Yesterday, an attorney in our church is
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:41.320]  representing a nine-month-old black baby boy who is being adopted by two married black women,
[2:36:41.320 --> 2:36:47.240]  and whenever she called it an abomination, the judge stopped the proceedings and put her out of
[2:36:47.240 --> 2:36:53.320]  the courtroom. This woman was simply protecting a nine-month-old helpless baby boy that is already
[2:36:53.320 --> 2:36:58.040]  an endangered species that is already being... Well, you know, statistically, those couples then
[2:36:58.040 --> 2:37:02.440]  do the transgender deal. It's like a ritual. I don't know, those group, and they go after
[2:37:02.440 --> 2:37:07.240]  their testicles. I mean, it's like a religion to target boys with this whole transgenderism.
[2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:12.920]  They admit it's a transhumanist move. Which, by the way, exactly right. Which, by the way,
[2:37:12.920 --> 2:37:22.360]  the vaccine takes away people's ability because of Bill Gates' agenda that is in Daniel 7 and 25.
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:28.760]  It takes away your ability to resist. It takes away your desire to be zealous and fanatical.
[2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:33.880]  Look at people that are vaccinated. They're like zombies. They're just wandering around with no
[2:37:33.880 --> 2:37:40.760]  goals. So we are commanded to resist. That's why Daniel resisted, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abandago,
[2:37:40.760 --> 2:37:47.240]  Mrem, and Jacobit, Esther, and that's why the Patriots at Concord Bridge resisted. You know,
[2:37:47.240 --> 2:37:52.680]  JR Tolkien said it is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us
[2:37:52.680 --> 2:37:57.560]  for the sucker those years when we are set up, rooting evil in the fields we know,
[2:37:57.560 --> 2:38:01.960]  so that those who come after us will have clean earth to teal. Whether they shall have is not
[2:38:01.960 --> 2:38:08.760]  ours to determine. And what he's saying is, when you know to do good and do it not, it is sin.
[2:38:08.760 --> 2:38:17.320]  So Romans 14 and 13 said, let not that good be evil spoken of, adversely speaking, you can't
[2:38:17.320 --> 2:38:23.560]  speak good of evil. And there is evil in America today. There's evil in the White House, in Congress,
[2:38:23.560 --> 2:38:27.560]  in Senate, in our governor's mansion. Why is it making its move now?
[2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:35.960]  What's that? Why is it making its move right now? Why is evil just exploding everywhere?
[2:38:36.840 --> 2:38:44.040]  Because the church is not resisting only he who now let us will let until he's taken out of the
[2:38:44.040 --> 2:38:48.920]  way. The word let means hinder in the original Greek. It means we are supposed to resist.
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:54.920]  We don't need more soft headed preaching. We don't need more pastors taking PPP money from the
[2:38:54.920 --> 2:39:00.600]  government because they are now employees of the government who can't speak out against homosexuality,
[2:39:00.600 --> 2:39:07.160]  who can't speak out against government tyranny. We refuse to take one dime so that less power that
[2:39:07.160 --> 2:39:12.840]  the churches and the pulpit have, they're actually promoting the vaccine. Who in the hell do you
[2:39:12.840 --> 2:39:19.160]  think you are to promote a vaccine? But you shut the doors on your church and did not promote the
[2:39:19.160 --> 2:39:25.480]  gospel of Jesus Christ. You're a worker and a minister of the devil. You cannot do that. So
[2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:31.880]  because of this, the devil is emboldened and crooked politicians are emboldened and criminals
[2:39:31.880 --> 2:39:39.080]  are emboldened. While there is a, while there is a demasculization of pastors like yourself,
[2:39:39.080 --> 2:39:44.440]  like yourself, which is why we're being censored, which is why we're being silenced,
[2:39:44.440 --> 2:39:50.680]  which is why we're being taken down in our live broadcast. However, the more you afflict us,
[2:39:50.680 --> 2:39:55.480]  the more we multiply and grow. You can't do anything against the truth, only for the truth.
[2:39:55.480 --> 2:40:02.040]  We have an advantage in our adversity and it's because of our adversity that the gospel is
[2:40:02.040 --> 2:40:06.360]  being spread to people and people are being emboldened. They're being terminated from their
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:11.560]  jobs because they're not taking the jab. Well, thank God, there are some things worse
[2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:16.600]  than going hungry. Yeah, like a blood clot or a heart attack. And clearly that's what's happening.
[2:40:16.600 --> 2:40:22.360]  It's a plan for the depopulation top scientist, like Dr. Yedon, the former head of Pfizer Sciences,
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:27.160]  it will attack the testicles and ovaries. And then now you would see these big hip hop stars
[2:40:27.160 --> 2:40:32.760]  coming out saying, wake up, ask questions. So even Hollywood people are turning against the system
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:41.080]  and they're panicking. Yes. So some are being corrupted by flattery. And the righteous are
[2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:46.840]  as bold as a lion, the wicked flea when no man pursue it. You know, one of the reasons that
[2:40:46.840 --> 2:40:53.240]  they hate us so much, Alex, is because we have 27 different nationalities in our church. And
[2:40:53.800 --> 2:41:00.120]  there's racial diversity, there's inclusion and unity and harmony. And that doesn't fit
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:05.720]  the democratic agenda. It's supposed to be race against race and nationality against nationality.
[2:41:05.720 --> 2:41:11.640]  So incidentally, they hate us and have to shut our doors. But when the gospel of Jesus Christ
[2:41:11.640 --> 2:41:16.680]  is preached like it should be preached, we don't live in fear of the government. They're not our
[2:41:16.680 --> 2:41:22.440]  nanny. We're getting people off of welfare. We're getting people off of the streets. And as long as
[2:41:22.440 --> 2:41:28.440]  people are on the streets and as long as people are on welfare, they can be governed and controlled
[2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:35.400]  by this government. That's why freedoms and freedoms of dollars are being given into our
[2:41:35.400 --> 2:41:41.880]  society today, not where it belongs, but where it's hurting us the most. It's all done for social
[2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:47.080]  engineering to make us weak and bring us down. G. Z. Ping pays for all the leptis propaganda in
[2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:52.120]  our movies. He owns four of the six Hollywood houses around with the Congress now. But he bans
[2:41:52.120 --> 2:41:57.560]  it in his country because he said it will undermine and collapse their nation. It will. It
[2:41:57.560 --> 2:42:03.800]  is completely backwards. Isaiah 5.20 says, One of them that call good evil and evil good has
[2:42:03.800 --> 2:42:08.600]  set light for darkness and darkness for light have called wrong, right and right and wrong.
[2:42:08.600 --> 2:42:17.560]  We must not comply with this end time government. We must resist it. And in resisting, God will
[2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:23.480]  back us. God will bless us and God will promote us. America is the greatest nation in all the
[2:42:23.480 --> 2:42:29.640]  world. And that's why the devil has to destroy us. I passed her final segment. I'm always impressed
[2:42:29.640 --> 2:42:32.840]  with your work, but I really think you come in there. I want to play that governor, that crazy
[2:42:32.840 --> 2:42:36.520]  woman and talk about these evil governors and how we get rid of them politically, legally,
[2:42:36.520 --> 2:42:41.000]  lawfully. And if God does convict our heart to stop this evil, like I know our listeners are,
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:45.720]  what do we do that's nonviolent that doesn't feed into the enemy's hands? Because there's a time
[2:42:45.720 --> 2:42:49.560]  like Moses went around killing people. So you got to ask ourselves, what are we supposed to do?
[2:42:49.560 --> 2:42:55.960]  I'm not going for violence. I'm going to ask that question when we come back.
[2:42:55.960 --> 2:43:01.000]  The puppet leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their allegiance
[2:43:01.720 --> 2:43:07.800]  to the new world order. And Democrat politicians have been announcing it here as well. That means
[2:43:07.800 --> 2:43:13.400]  allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government established by the Rockefellers
[2:43:13.400 --> 2:43:18.200]  through the UN. And they want inside your body to put in you what they want, when they want,
[2:43:18.200 --> 2:43:25.080]  and to have the global digital tracking COVID passes or vaccine passes to form the backbone
[2:43:25.080 --> 2:43:31.000]  of their new world ID. And now their puppet might has announced the forced inoculation of 100
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:37.320]  million Americans to keep their jobs in total violation of the Nuremberg code. This is criminal.
[2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:41.320]  And he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine when they did not approve it. They say that's a
[2:43:41.320 --> 2:43:46.840]  20, 25, maybe they just expanded the emergency authorization. That's why the two top scientists
[2:43:46.840 --> 2:43:52.040]  quit a week and a half ago. Well, you live to see an absolute new world order government.
[2:43:52.040 --> 2:43:54.200]  If you submit, they will totally enslave you.
[2:43:56.040 --> 2:44:04.120]  Come to command here with an important message to humanity. I have decided that all of you will
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:12.840]  take a special injection so that you will be safe. But the injection is not ready yet. And so
[2:44:12.840 --> 2:44:23.320]  I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the can. I also need you to wear
[2:44:23.320 --> 2:44:33.000]  masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations. That way we can consolidate control
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:41.560]  and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable. You will then be my
[2:44:41.560 --> 2:44:50.040]  slaves. Oh, and if you keep that special shot and get him from Oprah, we'll remove your immune system
[2:44:50.040 --> 2:44:53.480]  so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[2:44:55.720 --> 2:45:00.440]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health. It has
[2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:05.240]  been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight
[2:45:05.240 --> 2:45:10.760]  gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.

[2:46:55.080 --> 2:47:01.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:09.800 --> 2:47:13.880]  All right. Final segment with our guests, the Hermione Alex Jones show. Jay Dyer is a great
[2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:18.040]  historian on the globalist plan for world domination in their own words. He will be taking
[2:47:18.040 --> 2:47:23.560]  over in the next hour of the war room though in Troyer, but Pastor Tony Spell as a very popular
[2:47:23.560 --> 2:47:28.600]  church. It's also watched all over the world with thousands and thousands come each week LTCBR.com
[2:47:29.240 --> 2:47:33.320]  and they're censoring him. They're blocking him and they're trying to put him in prison and the
[2:47:33.320 --> 2:47:38.680]  feds have put up cameras to harass his church while the southern border is wide open with kidnapped
[2:47:38.680 --> 2:47:45.000]  and trafficked children. This is just the world upside down. So I've been asking a lot of questions
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:49.160]  here pastor and I want to play a clip of this governor coming up, but what else is on your
[2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:54.120]  radar? Because you've made a lot of amazing points, but what else do you think is important to impart
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:48:01.880]  to all the viewers and listeners out there? In World War I, William Butler VIII said,
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:06.520]  turning and turning in the widening gyre, the falcon cannot hear the falcon.
[2:48:06.520 --> 2:48:11.640]  Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Mayor Anarchy is loose if on the earth. The blood
[2:48:11.640 --> 2:48:16.680]  dim tide is loose and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned. Surely some revelation is
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:21.720]  at hand. Surely the second coming is at hand. The second coming. Hardly are those words out
[2:48:21.720 --> 2:48:27.400]  when a vast image out of Spirit is Monday troubles my sight. A waste of desert sand, a gaze is blank
[2:48:27.400 --> 2:48:35.960]  and pitiless is the sun, is moving at slow thighs and is slouching towards Gomorrah to be born.
[2:48:35.960 --> 2:48:42.040]  And what rough beast's hour come round that lasts? It's talking about the end time and the second
[2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:47.800]  coming of Jesus Christ. So there is an escalation right now in the world. The devil knows he has
[2:48:47.800 --> 2:48:55.640]  but a short time to work. So he is using these bully, tyrant nephalums, governors and presidents
[2:48:55.640 --> 2:49:02.600]  and senators and congressmen like Pelosi and Biden and Harrison and Edwards here in Louisiana.
[2:49:02.600 --> 2:49:09.960]  He's using them. And what's coming is great persecution for the church. Revelation 2-10,
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:16.920]  Jesus gives the command, be faithful unto death. Some of you are going to be put into prison.
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:22.760]  Well, that's all right. We're in good company. The majority of the New Testament was written
[2:49:22.760 --> 2:49:28.520]  from the inside of a prison cell. So number one, I want to admonish every God-fearing
[2:49:28.520 --> 2:49:35.000]  patriot Christian out there in America resists. You're not breaking laws whenever you speak
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:41.880]  out against the government. Romans 13 and 2 Peter, the second chapter, does not forbid you to speak
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:47.320]  out against the government. There would not be a United States of America had Christians had not
[2:49:47.320 --> 2:49:53.640]  spoken out against the government. All of these commands in the Bible are speaking about church
[2:49:53.640 --> 2:49:59.640]  government and apostolic authority. It never does forbid you to speak out against Edwards or Biden
[2:49:59.640 --> 2:50:03.960]  or any of these other... And as you know, the rest of the passage, that coin belongs to Caesar.
[2:50:03.960 --> 2:50:08.040]  So that's his system. Yes, that's his jurisdiction. But he doesn't have jurisdiction of the church.
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:14.440]  His jurisdiction stops at the door of my church. You can do what you want out there. But when you
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:20.760]  come in here, this establishment of religion, which the first, not the second fifth or 25th,
[2:50:20.760 --> 2:50:25.560]  but the first amendment says we first have to protect the preachers. There would not be a
[2:50:25.560 --> 2:50:31.720]  Constitution had it not been for the Black Road Regiment who put into the hearts of our framers
[2:50:31.720 --> 2:50:41.160]  to write we the people of the United States. And down by our Creator. Yes. And we hold these
[2:50:41.160 --> 2:50:46.280]  truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
[2:50:46.280 --> 2:50:52.360]  is found only in God. Righteousness, peace, and joy is found only in God. So number one, we have
[2:50:52.360 --> 2:50:58.760]  to resist. We have to be faithful unto death. And we have to boycott these businesses that demand
[2:50:58.760 --> 2:51:05.720]  we mask and muzzle. We have to stop telling our children it's all right to comply with these
[2:51:05.720 --> 2:51:12.120]  unlawful orders. Whenever you do that, you're breaking down their resistance. We're telling them
[2:51:12.120 --> 2:51:17.560]  it's all right to follow these Antichrist laws that eventually going to say take the mark in your
[2:51:17.560 --> 2:51:22.520]  hand, your head and the name. And if you can't, you can't buy. And by the way, Klaus Schwab, as you
[2:51:22.520 --> 2:51:26.520]  know, runs the whole thing. He's the corporate world leader for the UN. He says you will soon
[2:51:26.520 --> 2:51:33.160]  take a chip in your hand to buy and sell. You will. Many will. Many will be corrupted by flatteries.
[2:51:33.160 --> 2:51:37.880]  And many will comply with this Antichrist government. And he said five years ago,
[2:51:38.600 --> 2:51:43.800]  we will use a virus to put a chip in everybody's hand to buy and sell with a world ID. He said it.
[2:51:43.800 --> 2:51:52.760]  I mean, it's all being manifest. And why are our pulpit silent on this? God says you will not be
[2:51:52.760 --> 2:51:59.160]  held blameless because of your silence. There is a sin. Whenever Elijah comes to King Ahab,
[2:51:59.160 --> 2:52:04.440]  Ahab says Elijah, are you the preacher that's been troubling Israel? Elijah says you got it all
[2:52:04.440 --> 2:52:09.000]  backwards. You're the one that didn't pay your water bills. So God's brought a drought and a
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:15.080]  famine on the nation of Israel. He said, I've come to tell you, you're the problem. You have killed
[2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:21.320]  an innocent man by the name of Naboth. And he said, God forbid that I should give up my inheritance.
[2:52:21.320 --> 2:52:28.120]  America has an inheritance that has been given to us by God Almighty. There's no nation like it in
[2:52:28.120 --> 2:52:34.120]  all the world. We are responsible, number one, for being the greatest ally and friend that Israel
[2:52:34.120 --> 2:52:39.480]  God's people has ever had. Well, now our White House is turning against Israel. They wanted to
[2:52:39.480 --> 2:52:48.440]  take that billion dollars away from them because of the rag head squad, Tlaib and Cortez and all
[2:52:48.440 --> 2:52:55.080]  of these other freaks who hate Israel and hate America. They wanted to take that billion dollars
[2:52:55.080 --> 2:53:01.880]  to protect the Iron Dome. When we do that, America is finished. America is going to be judged by
[2:53:01.880 --> 2:53:07.080]  God. And let me add this. Regardless of what people think about that ongoing issue, AOC cried over
[2:53:07.080 --> 2:53:12.920]  defensive missiles that saved people. What a demon crying that, oh, they got defensive missiles.
[2:53:12.920 --> 2:53:19.880]  That's just crazy. She is a Jezebel who hates authority. You know this governor that said
[2:53:19.880 --> 2:53:25.960]  yesterday, God doesn't love you if you don't take the vaccine. And then she had the audacity.
[2:53:25.960 --> 2:53:33.640]  She actually had the testicular fortitude. She may be a man who says all of the major religious
[2:53:33.640 --> 2:53:41.160]  leaders have said there are no religious exemptions. Well, excuse me, but your major religious
[2:53:41.160 --> 2:53:47.960]  leaders are on the tape. They are going to be controlled by the Antichrist. The Antichrist
[2:53:47.960 --> 2:53:53.320]  is going to rule religiously, militarily and politically. Look how these three generals
[2:53:53.320 --> 2:53:59.400]  folded yesterday like a $2 Goodwill suit under the questioning. They threw their commander
[2:53:59.400 --> 2:54:05.480]  in chief under the bus. Well, number one, you need to be court-martialed for that. And this
[2:54:05.480 --> 2:54:12.120]  individual who is in jail today for speaking out against the evacuation in Afghanistan,
[2:54:12.120 --> 2:54:16.680]  he needs to take their place. Exactly. Because what's happening here is they're
[2:54:16.680 --> 2:54:20.600]  planning to set Biden up and then bring in Kamala. Give me your quick take on that. And
[2:54:20.600 --> 2:54:23.960]  clearly they set him up. Now they're setting him up for a fall. What do you see in your
[2:54:23.960 --> 2:54:30.360]  discernments coming? So what's coming is, yes, he's just a puppet on a string right now. He
[2:54:30.360 --> 2:54:38.920]  will be dethroned. His throne, according to Daniel, the seventh chapter and about the 14th
[2:54:38.920 --> 2:54:43.880]  verse says that his throne is going to be cast down. And there's going to be one that comes
[2:54:43.880 --> 2:54:50.760]  to power that's going to have these great swelling words, lying signs and wonders.
[2:54:50.760 --> 2:54:55.720]  They're going to have the power to fix all that's wrong with our educational systems
[2:54:55.720 --> 2:55:01.240]  and our military and our political powers. They're going to have all of the answers.
[2:55:01.240 --> 2:55:07.560]  And they're going to be of Jewish descent. And they're going to have the answer for hyperinflation.
[2:55:07.560 --> 2:55:13.000]  They're going to have the answer for all the chaos and turmoil and the weather problems
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:17.960]  that are actually being controlled right now by. I was about to say they have a huge secret
[2:55:17.960 --> 2:55:21.720]  government weather control program with the UN they admit exists. And then they sit there and
[2:55:21.720 --> 2:55:26.600]  say, oh, you're evil. You didn't tax carbon. That's what humans are made out of. So you're bad.
[2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:31.000]  Exactly. They're orchestrating the global depopulation collapse. And they're going to blame
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  it on again, the general public. Why does Satan want depopulation? He wants depopulation because
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:43.160]  he wants revenge against the human race because we took his place. God made man in his image.
[2:55:43.160 --> 2:55:51.080]  And after his likeness, the shot actually affects your DNA, the oxyribonucleic acid.
[2:55:51.080 --> 2:55:57.000]  It actually changes the molecular structure of humans who are created in God's image after his
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:56:04.200]  likeness. That's why the government is wanting to push this vaccine so heavily and say, if you
[2:56:04.200 --> 2:56:08.360]  don't take it, we're going to do that. It literally marks your DNA. Pastor, I know you've got to go,
[2:56:08.360 --> 2:56:12.120]  but I've got five more minutes, a little short segment we're going to break. I want to play
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:16.120]  the governor and then I want to come back and get your take on that. But let's just do that next
[2:56:16.120 --> 2:56:20.040]  short segment if you can do five more minutes, a two minute break. But first, let me just say this,
[2:56:20.040 --> 2:56:24.040]  everybody that wants to hear more what you have to say, your church should be worldwide like it
[2:56:24.040 --> 2:56:29.400]  already is. Everybody should go share your URL and point out what's been happening to you and others
[2:56:29.400 --> 2:56:33.400]  so that it blows up in their face. And let me guess though, your church has gotten
[2:56:34.200 --> 2:56:41.640]  stronger, hasn't it, under the persecution? We've grown, we've baptized over 1200 people now since
[2:56:41.640 --> 2:56:47.800]  March of 2020 when this foolishness began. We've grown spiritually, financially, numerically.
[2:56:47.800 --> 2:56:54.680]  We've added more buses to our fleet. People gather in East India. People gather in Pakistan.
[2:56:54.680 --> 2:57:02.040]  We're doing baptisms all over the world today because what he tried to silence,
[2:57:02.040 --> 2:57:06.680]  what our government tried to silence, and what the devil meant for bad, God meant for good.
[2:57:06.680 --> 2:57:14.920]  So although we are angry and we are commanded to resist our government, we thank God for them
[2:57:14.920 --> 2:57:20.760]  because they are bringing truth to the forefront. People are now falling back in love with the
[2:57:20.760 --> 2:57:25.480]  Constitution. People are falling back in love with our freedoms, and that's good. That's right,
[2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:32.600]  because the evil's been hidden out in the open. LTCBR.com, LTCBR.com. Check it out, share it,
[2:57:32.600 --> 2:57:38.520]  it's amazing. A lot of great videos and material there for everybody around the world, LTCBR.com.
[2:57:38.520 --> 2:57:45.320]  And I'm Alan Jones with infowars.com and banned on video. Stay with us. By now you've heard me
[2:57:45.320 --> 2:57:50.360]  talk about the BioProse and how they're creating amazing products. They've done it again and have
[2:57:50.360 --> 2:57:56.280]  just released an entire suite of bio-remediation products, bringing industrial-level technology
[2:57:56.280 --> 2:58:00.440]  to the everyday consumer. They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary
[2:58:00.440 --> 2:58:05.960]  patented delivery system. The BioProse are excited to release BioDrain Pro, a product
[2:58:05.960 --> 2:58:10.680]  specifically designed to establish healthy drains, pipes, and overall plumbing systems.
[2:58:10.680 --> 2:58:17.160]  BioDrain Pro digests grease, fats, oils, sludge, paper, and organic matter with ease.
[2:58:17.160 --> 2:58:23.720]  It contains no chemicals, no GMOs, and is safe for black-gray holding tanks, sewer hoses, and

[2:58:44.840 --> 2:58:50.200]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[2:58:50.200 --> 2:58:55.400]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental
[2:58:55.400 --> 2:59:01.080]  injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease. The perpetrators
[2:59:01.080 --> 2:59:06.120]  of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an
[2:59:06.120 --> 2:59:11.800]  artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years. For those of us who have awoken from
[2:59:11.800 --> 2:59:17.080]  the spell, we know this is all really happening, and it's unbelievably unsettling to see. But
[2:59:17.080 --> 2:59:22.600]  there is only two things to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[2:59:22.600 --> 2:59:28.040]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win, and we eventually
[2:59:28.040 --> 2:59:33.640]  will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end, and so we must prepare. Get up to
[2:59:33.640 --> 2:59:40.600]  a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and
[2:59:40.600 --> 2:59:44.040]  life-saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[2:59:44.040 --> 2:59:51.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:59:57.960 --> 3:00:01.880]  There are the air-rained sirens of tyranny, but that will awaken the faithful.
[3:00:01.880 --> 3:00:07.240]  Pastor Tony Spell arrested repeatedly for having his church services being targeted yet again.
[3:00:07.240 --> 3:00:09.720]  We only have a few minutes left, and I want you to be able to give us that point that we
[3:00:09.720 --> 3:00:14.120]  went to break and never got back to. How did nobody in the tens of thousands that have come to your
[3:00:14.120 --> 3:00:20.280]  church die of COVID and other places they settle that all this debt was happening? A, B, how far
[3:00:20.280 --> 3:00:25.480]  do we push without getting violent, or what is the time for self-defense? And then C, again,
[3:00:25.480 --> 3:00:29.960]  what do you make of this crazy governor and others now saying it's the religion of the vaccines and
[3:00:29.960 --> 3:00:33.160]  God gave us this big pharma shot? Please answer that, Pastor.
[3:00:33.160 --> 3:00:40.840]  So, number one, zero deaths, the most attended church services in America, maybe the world.
[3:00:40.840 --> 3:00:45.560]  While everything was shut down, people were gathering here, driving in from across America
[3:00:45.560 --> 3:00:49.960]  to our church services. Thousands of people, we shook hands, we laid hands on people,
[3:00:49.960 --> 3:00:54.120]  which the Bible commands us to. It tells you, do not forsake the assembling,
[3:00:54.120 --> 3:00:58.920]  the word synagogue, and you're going to church together, and so much more as you see this
[3:00:58.920 --> 3:01:08.520]  end time approaching. That's number one. Number two, how far do we go? We go as to the place that
[3:01:08.520 --> 3:01:16.200]  Jesus said we should go. Be faithful unto death. We have to speak out. We have to stand up. Listen,
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:23.800]  these bullies are afraid of us. Second Timothy 1-7, God did not give us the spirit of fear.
[3:01:23.800 --> 3:01:30.440]  The word means cowardice in the original language, but a power, love, and a sound mind.
[3:01:30.440 --> 3:01:38.520]  Fear is insanity. Fear is hate. Fear is weakness. So, power, love, and a sound mind.
[3:01:38.520 --> 3:01:43.720]  So, what we have to do is operate in our power, in our love, and in our sanity.
[3:01:44.360 --> 3:01:51.560]  Now, whenever Jesus asked the question in Luke 10, 30 through 35, who is the neighbor to the
[3:01:51.560 --> 3:01:57.480]  man laying in the ditch, bloody bruised and naked, not the priest and the Levite, they went by on the
[3:01:57.480 --> 3:02:03.640]  other side. They would not touch him because they would have been contaminated and made ceremonial
[3:02:03.640 --> 3:02:08.280]  and clean. They would have had to go through a purification process. But the Good Samaritan
[3:02:08.280 --> 3:02:13.160]  went to this naked man who was robbed. You know why the priest and the Levite didn't help him?
[3:02:13.160 --> 3:02:19.480]  Because he was already robbed and they only wanted his money. But the Good Samaritan goes to him and
[3:02:19.480 --> 3:02:26.200]  says, you know what? I'm not afraid of what you have. You need what I've got. So, the true church
[3:02:26.200 --> 3:02:33.400]  will not close its doors during the pandemics of COVID-19 or even Delta or the new variants.
[3:02:33.400 --> 3:02:37.880]  We will stay open because God gives us command to pray for those people.
[3:02:37.880 --> 3:02:42.040]  So, now we know why they want the churches closed so they can announce big pharma in the state as
[3:02:42.040 --> 3:02:46.760]  God, something the authoritarians in every history book we know do. And we're now living through it
[3:02:46.760 --> 3:02:50.040]  right now where they remove God and then they declare themselves God.
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:57.800]  Yes. That's what this Antichrist is going to do in Revelations 13 and 11. He's
[3:02:57.800 --> 3:03:07.080]  citizen of the temple like he is God. He has horns like a lamb and he speaks like a dragon.
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:13.000]  So, he has the appearance of something good but lambs don't have horns. They're literally demonic
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:17.880]  and they speak like demons. That's what's happening. That's what this woman in New York
[3:03:17.880 --> 3:03:25.000]  and Governor Edwards. Governor Edwards reinstituted the mask mandate yesterday for another month.
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:31.640]  Okay? No, but there's 100,000 people gathering in LSU Stadium Saturday night, unmasked,
[3:03:31.640 --> 3:03:37.880]  saying F. Joe Biden and F. R. Governor. You know why? Because they're sick of it. Enough is enough.
[3:03:37.880 --> 3:03:41.720]  Exactly. There's a giant awakening but there's everybody refusing at the sports stadiums but
[3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:46.440]  they're still coming after you. Wow. It's so obvious. Pastor, thank you so much for the time.
[3:03:46.440 --> 3:03:51.800]  Pastor Tony Spell, LTCBR.com. Thank you so much and God bless you.
[3:03:52.760 --> 3:03:57.160]  Thank you. God bless you and God bless America. Absolutely. We'll get him back on soon to give us
[3:03:57.160 --> 3:04:01.720]  updates and we've all got to hang together or hang separate. What a time to see all this happening,
[3:04:01.720 --> 3:04:06.040]  ladies and gentlemen. What a time. And speaking of the devil, the spirit that wants to kill us,
[3:04:06.040 --> 3:04:10.920]  the spirit that wants to play God. Jay Dyer is an expert on their own writings, their own statements.
[3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:15.640]  Last week he was on and he showed the statements of the real Satanist, the high-level ones saying,
[3:04:15.640 --> 3:04:19.240]  we're not here to empower, we're here to enslave them. That's what the Illuminati wanted to do.
[3:04:19.240 --> 3:04:24.840]  So Jay Dyer is about to take over. I'm about to get in my car and drive to Dallas because I'm going
[3:04:24.840 --> 3:04:30.280]  on three of the Blaze shows tonight and tomorrow. One of them is Steven Crowder tomorrow at 10 a.m.
[3:04:30.280 --> 3:04:33.960]  I'm going to be all with him live. That's going to be streamed out everywhere. So look for that
[3:04:33.960 --> 3:04:38.680]  Steven Crowder interview and I'll be talking about this subject on that show. Please don't forget
[3:04:38.680 --> 3:04:44.520]  our great natural all-urbal sleep aid that's been sold out so good down and out is back in stock.
[3:04:44.520 --> 3:04:49.800]  50% off at infowarstore.com and that funds our operation. All right, thank you Pastor for coming
[3:04:49.800 --> 3:04:59.640]  on. We'll be right back with Jay Dyer. You want to have a double-blind randomized placebo testing
[3:04:59.640 --> 3:05:05.800]  without what that means. You give 20,000 people the vaccine when it comes to phase two, phase three
[3:05:05.800 --> 3:05:12.920]  trials and you give 20,000 people a placebo and then you really look at out outcomes for a long
[3:05:12.920 --> 3:05:18.840]  period of time, not four weeks. There's a lot of these injuries, the autoimmune injuries you're not
[3:05:18.840 --> 3:05:23.640]  going to see in four weeks, the cancer you're not going to see in four weeks and many of the
[3:05:23.640 --> 3:05:29.000]  neurological injuries you won't see for four weeks if the experience with other vaccines is
[3:05:29.000 --> 3:05:35.560]  instructive. You look at the other vaccines that are currently in the schedule and there's about
[3:05:35.560 --> 3:05:42.520]  400 injuries, illnesses, chronic illnesses that are listed. Robert Kennedy Jr. is just one of more
[3:05:42.520 --> 3:05:49.400]  than 40 powerful voices in the film COVIDland, exclusively available at covidland.com. When
[3:05:49.400 --> 3:06:06.520]  you order it now, you get a free copy of in-game blueprint for global enslavement. Welcome back
[3:06:06.520 --> 3:06:10.680]  to the Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of jasonalsons.com. Today I'm going to be
[3:06:10.680 --> 3:06:15.960]  covering a couple more of the global elite documents that you may have heard mentioned or you may
[3:06:15.960 --> 3:06:22.280]  have heard just briefly and passing talked about, but we haven't really gone deep into these documents
[3:06:22.280 --> 3:06:28.440]  so I don't know how far I'll get, but first one we're going to look at is the 2000 Bill Joy essay,
[3:06:28.440 --> 3:06:33.240]  Why the Future Doesn't Need Us. This is actually a pretty lengthy essay, so we'll try to get through
[3:06:33.240 --> 3:06:40.920]  as much of it as we can. The other one is the recent UK government in concert with the German
[3:06:40.920 --> 3:06:46.600]  government, Human Augmentation Dawn of a New Paradigm about transhumanism. So now just coming
[3:06:46.600 --> 3:06:55.960]  out and saying all of the stuff that Bill Joy talked about in 2000, 21 years ago, he wrote this
[3:06:55.960 --> 3:07:05.800]  famous essay for Wired Magazine about the dangers, the concerns of the needless status of human beings.
[3:07:05.800 --> 3:07:11.240]  That's right, that we would be going into a post-human world and what does that mean really
[3:07:11.240 --> 3:07:16.360]  for us to have a post-human world? Well, he says it's transhumanism and as everybody probably in
[3:07:16.360 --> 3:07:22.200]  this audience knows, transhumanism is the idea that we'll become post-human, that the process
[3:07:22.200 --> 3:07:28.440]  and so-called progress of evolution dictates, necessitates, determines, mandates that we have
[3:07:28.440 --> 3:07:34.360]  to be post-human. We have to get rid of man as he's existed for the last several thousand years
[3:07:34.360 --> 3:07:41.400]  and we have to merge with silicon, we have to become a new type of being and the idea is that
[3:07:41.400 --> 3:07:47.880]  it's just part of evolution. This is just what evolution is. Evolution is heartless, cold, nihilistic,
[3:07:47.880 --> 3:07:53.720]  it destroys and gets rid of countless species and now mankind is the new species to get rid of and
[3:07:53.720 --> 3:07:59.480]  yeah, exactly as Wall Street Journal says, right? It's time to become post-human and this is something
[3:07:59.480 --> 3:08:07.080]  that we're looking forward to. In fact, there's even a guy going around an angry wannabe Timothy
[3:08:07.080 --> 3:08:12.040]  Leary character who dresses like a Bond villain. Once again, they always dress like Bond villains,
[3:08:12.040 --> 3:08:18.280]  right? This guy who says that he's ready to campaign for the extinction of all human beings,
[3:08:18.280 --> 3:08:24.760]  literally dressing up in North Korean Bond villain outfits, walking amongst the bamboo,
[3:08:24.760 --> 3:08:31.080]  like some sort of demonic baby boomer panda. I don't know, but he says everybody needs to die,
[3:08:31.080 --> 3:08:36.840]  right? Now, I thought that this would qualify as like some kind of terror threat, right? But no,
[3:08:36.840 --> 3:08:41.720]  if you're a leftist, you can go and you can bomb pipelines, you can call for the killing of everyone.
[3:08:42.440 --> 3:08:47.320]  No, that's okay. That's cool. That's all good. But let's go back to 2000. Let's go back to
[3:08:47.320 --> 3:08:55.400]  what Bill Joy wrote in this original essay. And it's written by someone who, as I'm sure everybody
[3:08:55.400 --> 3:09:00.760]  knows, was a high-level Silicon Valley guy. And so already back at this time, and I'm sure anybody
[3:09:00.760 --> 3:09:07.720]  that's familiar with Philip K. Dick, even back in the 70s and early 80s, Philip K. Dick was talking
[3:09:07.720 --> 3:09:13.240]  about what would happen when Silicon Valley came to power, what their plans were. And he was warning
[3:09:13.240 --> 3:09:17.800]  a lot of people in his novels, right, that they would try to enact this technocratic,
[3:09:17.800 --> 3:09:23.720]  post-human, anti-human technocracy. And Bill Joy was essentially talking about that,
[3:09:23.720 --> 3:09:28.760]  and he begins his essay by saying that, you know, I met one day at a dinner meeting,
[3:09:29.640 --> 3:09:34.920]  the famous philosopher, John Searle. So if you know about philosophy, I'm sure everybody's one
[3:09:34.920 --> 3:09:39.800]  of the most famous, probably living philosophers of the 20th century, John Searle. And he said,
[3:09:39.800 --> 3:09:45.880]  and Ray Kurzweil walked up, right, the father of modern transhumanism, or the big inventor and
[3:09:45.880 --> 3:09:51.560]  tech guru. If you've seen in-game, I'm sure you remember Ray Kurzweil. He figures prominently
[3:09:51.560 --> 3:09:55.960]  in multiple sections of in-game. And he says that I was there with these two guys, and they had a
[3:09:55.960 --> 3:10:03.560]  debate. And the debate between John Searle, Dr. Searle, and Ray Kurzweil was over AI and transhumanism.
[3:10:03.560 --> 3:10:09.720]  And the argument was made that now we're going into an era of what could be called the spiritual
[3:10:09.720 --> 3:10:15.480]  machines, that technology will advance at such a degree, at such a pace, that machines are going
[3:10:15.480 --> 3:10:20.760]  to become more and more non-physical. Everything is moving towards the non-physical. And the movement
[3:10:20.760 --> 3:10:25.080]  towards the non-physical, towards the virtual, towards the matrix, towards the simulation,
[3:10:25.720 --> 3:10:32.600]  is in concert with human modification and bodily modification. And that's going to play
[3:10:32.600 --> 3:10:39.560]  huge into what the UK transhumanist government document talks about. But he says that we're
[3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:42.840]  going to become more and more like robots, and the robots are going to become more and more
[3:10:42.840 --> 3:10:49.240]  like us. So there's a parallel making humans more and more robotic and making the robots more and
[3:10:49.240 --> 3:10:53.560]  more human, at least in terms of their programming. I don't think they're actually going to become
[3:10:53.560 --> 3:10:58.120]  conscious. And that's essentially what Dr. Searle argued to Ray Kurzweil, is that there's no way to
[3:10:58.120 --> 3:11:03.320]  ever get a bunch of algorithms somehow becoming conscious, right? Algorithms don't have a soul,
[3:11:03.320 --> 3:11:08.200]  they don't make decisions, they just do, machines just do what they're programmed to do. And Ray
[3:11:08.200 --> 3:11:14.040]  Kurzweil said, well, no, I think that eventually AI will develop to the degree where you won't be
[3:11:14.040 --> 3:11:17.560]  able to tell the difference. And if you can't tell the difference, then functionally, they're the
[3:11:17.560 --> 3:11:23.160]  same, right? There's no difference between human consciousness and the AI. And by the time that
[3:11:23.160 --> 3:11:30.920]  we turn humans into a giant, Borg hive mind of, you know, the Gollum, which is what it's called
[3:11:30.920 --> 3:11:35.800]  by Jacques Attali in his global elite book, he says that literally the whole world will be hooked
[3:11:35.800 --> 3:11:42.520]  into a hive mind and he calls it the Gollum, right? The mythical, mystical, mindless being out of
[3:11:42.520 --> 3:11:49.320]  medieval mysticism. Well, so the most important section of this whole essay is the second page.
[3:11:49.320 --> 3:11:55.320]  And in the second page, Ray, excuse me, Bill Joy goes on to say, well, what happened was,
[3:11:55.320 --> 3:12:00.040]  I met with a lot of these elites and he says, I explained this to both Kurzweil and to Dr.
[3:12:00.040 --> 3:12:05.880]  John Searle. He says that we realized, many of us in Silicon Valley, that we had two options here.
[3:12:05.880 --> 3:12:12.280]  We could either set up a technocratic elite, and he's saying this, this is one of the top tech
[3:12:12.280 --> 3:12:17.800]  people, right? Sun Microsystems. He's saying, we realized that we had two options. Either we set up
[3:12:17.800 --> 3:12:28.760]  a tech elite that is humane and nice and basically hippie minded that takes all of the mass of human
[3:12:28.760 --> 3:12:35.080]  beings and basically herds them into being pets. I'm not joking. That's the nice view. And he says
[3:12:35.080 --> 3:12:41.560]  that in that scenario, what we would do is basically turn everybody into pets, right? You'll
[3:12:41.560 --> 3:12:47.240]  be the pets of the elite and we'll drug everybody and they'll be happy, right? So basically a brave
[3:12:47.240 --> 3:12:51.960]  new world out is Huxley type scenario. If you've seen Huxley's Berkeley lectures, that's kind of
[3:12:51.960 --> 3:12:57.160]  what he says. He says that we could have a humane world government where you're just happy and you're
[3:12:57.160 --> 3:13:03.000]  sort of blitzed out on, you know, Prozac and pills and whatever the latest pill is and you're just,
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:07.480]  you know, living in the virtual, around playing video games and watching, you know,
[3:13:07.480 --> 3:13:13.560]  pornography all day, literally, or, or here's the other option. He says that instead of the brave
[3:13:13.560 --> 3:13:20.280]  new world scenario, the elite could decide just simply to use intense psychological warfare
[3:13:20.280 --> 3:13:27.800]  and operations and bio releases to reduce the entire birthrate of the world and ultimately
[3:13:27.800 --> 3:13:34.280]  the extinction of humanity within two pages. That's what he said. So when you still hear people
[3:13:34.280 --> 3:13:38.280]  saying there's no such thing as Malthusianism, there's no such thing as a tech elite that's,
[3:13:38.280 --> 3:13:43.320]  you know, has the idea of depopulating the world. It's all made up. I mean, this is a famous
[3:13:43.320 --> 3:13:50.040]  essay that's been out there for 21 years. Okay, before 9 11, they were, they were discussing this.
[3:13:50.040 --> 3:13:56.040]  I'll read you what he says already. The exact, he says, due to improved techniques, the elite will
[3:13:56.040 --> 3:14:01.000]  have greater control over the masses and because human work will no longer be necessary, the masses
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:06.040]  will become pointless. That's the replacement of everybody with robots and AI, including military,
[3:14:06.040 --> 3:14:10.840]  which is a huge part of the UK transhumanist document, right, getting rid of the human element
[3:14:10.840 --> 3:14:16.600]  or turning the human element into a platform. That's literally what the UK transhumanist document
[3:14:16.600 --> 3:14:21.480]  says, that no longer are you just a human resource. That's the way you used to be viewed
[3:14:21.480 --> 3:14:28.760]  in the government white papers. Now you're a platform. You're a node in the Borg hive network,
[3:14:28.760 --> 3:14:37.160]  you see. So Bill Joy goes on to say that if they decide the elite don't, if they don't go with the
[3:14:37.160 --> 3:14:43.800]  happy drug, the breaking the world scenario, it will be the mass depop scenario. He says that
[3:14:43.800 --> 3:14:51.800]  this will use, they will use the machines to accomplish this mass depopulation in the long run.
[3:14:51.800 --> 3:14:56.120]  Now that's again, that's like the Terminator scenario. So he's literally saying Skynet,
[3:14:56.120 --> 3:15:04.280]  Terminator, depopulation. However, if we decide not to do that, we might just have a few softhearted
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:09.800]  liberal tech elites who decide to play the role of good shepherds to not extinct everybody,
[3:15:09.800 --> 3:15:16.760]  but to basically just make everybody mindless, pornhub zombies. That's what he says. And they
[3:15:16.760 --> 3:15:24.120]  will be biologically and physically engineered, and they will become pets and harmless hobbies for
[3:15:24.120 --> 3:15:30.360]  the elite. These engineered humans may be happy in some way, but they will not be free. They will
[3:15:30.360 --> 3:15:37.400]  in fact be slaves. They will have been reduced to the status of domesticated animals. So that's
[3:15:37.400 --> 3:15:42.280]  the attitude and belief and view that the elite, the tech elite, the financial elite, the corporate
[3:15:42.280 --> 3:15:49.080]  elite, the Malthusian elite have is that everybody is just cattle and pets with their system. Now,
[3:15:49.080 --> 3:15:54.120]  do you think that Bill Gates disagrees with this? Say right there, we'll be right back in just a
[3:15:54.120 --> 3:15:58.120]  moment. What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning

[3:18:57.000 --> 3:19:02.840]  we're living under now is bad, wait till they've got their world ID and then that's exactly what
[3:19:02.840 --> 3:19:09.080]  the COVID passports are all about. And CloudSwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders'
[3:19:09.080 --> 3:19:15.000]  own words, they admit that once they've gotten you with that system then they're going to carbon
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:20.680]  tax you everywhere you go and track what you do. And publicly they're saying they're going to decide
[3:19:20.680 --> 3:19:26.200]  when you can travel and when you can't travel. And MasterCard and all the other big companies
[3:19:26.200 --> 3:19:31.000]  are currently announcing they're going to track what you do and where you go and tax you with a
[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:37.160]  carbon tax for it. This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen. This is the takeover.
[3:19:37.160 --> 3:19:42.040]  In humanity, better wake up and say no. Finally, folks are starting to wake up. Joe Rogan, Tucker
[3:19:42.040 --> 3:19:46.760]  Carlson, others will leave the charge along with info wars. But it's not enough. Every individual
[3:19:46.760 --> 3:19:51.240]  has to not comply and we have to talk about bringing the globalists to justice. You see,
[3:19:51.240 --> 3:19:54.040]  they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully.
[3:19:54.040 --> 3:20:00.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:14.920 --> 3:20:18.360]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer. Jay's analysis. We were
[3:20:18.360 --> 3:20:25.800]  talking about the tech elite attitude that has adopted the same Malthusian attitude of the
[3:20:25.800 --> 3:20:31.560]  banking elite of the media elite, the corporate elite. So basically everyone in the elite structure
[3:20:31.560 --> 3:20:37.080]  has the same Malthusian attitude. It's kind of a prerequisite. It's a requirement. I don't think
[3:20:37.080 --> 3:20:42.440]  there's anybody in the power structure who doesn't have this view. You literally are not allowed into
[3:20:42.440 --> 3:20:49.880]  the power structure without believing in the hardcore, totally Malthusian worldview. And
[3:20:49.880 --> 3:20:55.320]  concomitant with that is the attitude of transhumanism, that humanity has to be transcended
[3:20:55.320 --> 3:21:00.600]  through technology, through becoming silicon, right? And we've seen Klaus saying this recently,
[3:21:00.600 --> 3:21:06.280]  right? We will enter your body. The biological becomes the synthetic. You will become the
[3:21:06.280 --> 3:21:12.280]  synthetic silicon based life form. I will get in your body. And he's literally telling you exactly
[3:21:12.280 --> 3:21:19.000]  what was in all of these transhumanist documents for the last several decades. Now, Bill Joy goes
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:29.560]  on to say that he hopes and he wished that the elite would adopt the attitude of a softer,
[3:21:29.560 --> 3:21:36.120]  liberal, hippie run beer revenue world scenario, right? Where we could just get high and have fun
[3:21:36.120 --> 3:21:42.680]  and watch movies all day or whatever. But no, in fact, sadly, the elite appear to have chosen
[3:21:42.680 --> 3:21:49.080]  the total mass depopulation approach. And remember, this was written in the year 2000.
[3:21:49.800 --> 3:21:55.400]  What have we seen in the last 21 years? Does it look like the world is going away from
[3:21:56.040 --> 3:22:02.840]  this type of a plan? Or is it is it not obvious now that this plan has been rolled out? It should
[3:22:02.840 --> 3:22:07.800]  be completely obvious. It should be totally obvious. There should no longer be debate. And in fact,
[3:22:07.800 --> 3:22:13.960]  Bill Joy was saying 20 years ago that the debate that needs to be had right now, he said in 2000,
[3:22:13.960 --> 3:22:22.680]  is what are we going to do now that the elite have decided to extinct humanity? And so he
[3:22:22.680 --> 3:22:27.800]  sounded this warning. He even mentions, you know, other people who were warning people about the
[3:22:27.800 --> 3:22:33.480]  tech elite takeover. He mentioned science fiction, right? Science fiction writings, dystopian writings
[3:22:33.480 --> 3:22:39.480]  that are warned about this. He talks about Star Trek and the Borg. And he talks about how nanotech,
[3:22:39.480 --> 3:22:45.240]  which has the potential to expand, you know, lifespans to give us a long life to basically
[3:22:45.240 --> 3:22:53.240]  bring about this tremendous, right, technological revolution that we could really have an amazing
[3:22:53.240 --> 3:22:58.680]  extended life. We could have most of the problems in the world solved, theoretically speaking,
[3:22:58.680 --> 3:23:05.080]  except that the elite that have access to all of this crazy technology do not want that. They're
[3:23:05.080 --> 3:23:13.720]  totally evil. They're totally, they see the public as prey. They're predators. And so he goes through
[3:23:13.720 --> 3:23:17.880]  all these different scenarios of science fiction that he read growing up and how influential they
[3:23:17.880 --> 3:23:24.680]  were on him. And he said that one thing he realized was that the elite in his circles had adopted
[3:23:24.680 --> 3:23:30.600]  just this totally mouth using attitude. And what happens is that the irony, this is my observation,
[3:23:30.600 --> 3:23:37.000]  is that he said all of these tech science fiction books and novels or TV shows, whether it's
[3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:45.560]  Asimov, iRobot, Star Trek, Heinlein, he says that they basically had an attitude of worshiping man,
[3:23:45.560 --> 3:23:52.440]  right, man is the Promethean figure who will, you know, rise up, take the reins of the technology
[3:23:52.440 --> 3:23:58.440]  of the gods and become gods themselves. That's the kind of underlying attitude of the progressive
[3:23:58.440 --> 3:24:04.760]  science fiction of the 50s, 60s, 70s. But he said what happened, my observation is that what happens
[3:24:04.760 --> 3:24:11.400]  is that the more that man worships man, and the more that man wants to idolize and see mankind
[3:24:11.400 --> 3:24:17.000]  as the archetype to shoot for, the ubermensch, what happens is that he more and more hates man.
[3:24:17.800 --> 3:24:24.040]  Because what happens is that man begins to see man as the central problem to becoming a god.
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:31.720]  And so what I believe is that this is a demonic, it's a satanic trick, it's a delusion. Because
[3:24:31.720 --> 3:24:37.400]  what the demons basically promote is the idea that, oh, what's holding you back from becoming a god
[3:24:37.400 --> 3:24:44.360]  is the other man. It doesn't sound exactly like Genesis 3, this is exactly what the serpent says
[3:24:44.360 --> 3:24:50.680]  in the garden, is that he tempts man with the belief that he can become god. But all he has to do
[3:24:50.680 --> 3:24:55.240]  is agree to the plan of the serpent. And what's the plan of the serpent? Well, the plan of the
[3:24:55.240 --> 3:25:00.280]  serpent actually leads to death. It's a covenant with death. The book of Isaiah talks about mankind
[3:25:00.280 --> 3:25:07.640]  making a covenant with death. But Satan tricks people into thinking that, oh, if you just agree
[3:25:08.200 --> 3:25:14.280]  to the mass sacrifice of the human race, I will give you the secrets of technology so that you
[3:25:14.280 --> 3:25:19.000]  can live forever. So it's interesting, isn't it? It's like a reverse version of the promise of the
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:25.240]  gospel, right? Jesus, the gospel, it presents man with the belief in the resurrection and immortality,
[3:25:25.240 --> 3:25:32.680]  right? Eternal life through faith, faith in God, right? And the inverse, the opposite, is eternal
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:38.680]  life immortality through the mass sacrificing of the human race. Now, you think that sounds crazy,
[3:25:38.680 --> 3:25:44.280]  but it's come out in recent years that people in the Silicon Valley tech elite, they go to
[3:25:44.280 --> 3:25:49.720]  Burning Man. And when they go to Burning Man, they have literally little secret societies that the
[3:25:49.720 --> 3:25:56.200]  top tech heads and elites, that they go to their own little circles. I'm not joking. And they do
[3:25:56.200 --> 3:26:03.640]  DMT, they do hallucinogens, they do LSD, they do shrooms, and they get revelations, they get mystical
[3:26:03.640 --> 3:26:11.800]  meanings from entities, right? And this is totally separate from all the same studies that were done
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:19.640]  by the CIA during the MK Ultra projects where there were people in float tanks, this kind of stuff.
[3:26:20.280 --> 3:26:26.360]  So they actually have a whole separated area at Burning Man that only the tech elite are allowed
[3:26:26.360 --> 3:26:31.400]  to go into. And it's a very closed off thing, right? This is, again, it's not me theorizing,
[3:26:31.400 --> 3:26:36.520]  this has come out the last couple of years about the separate tech elite secret society,
[3:26:36.520 --> 3:26:42.200]  and they do it, they do it like a ritual. They go to it every year, and they will do LSD,
[3:26:42.200 --> 3:26:47.960]  and it's a shamanic kind of revelation where they get these messages, and what do you know,
[3:26:47.960 --> 3:26:52.600]  what are the messages that they always get? Transhumanism, that was at least the last couple
[3:26:52.600 --> 3:26:58.920]  years, it was about transhumanism and going beyond the body and being human. So posthumanism,
[3:26:58.920 --> 3:27:06.920]  transhumanism, is it an accident? Is it just coincidence that the messages that
[3:27:06.920 --> 3:27:13.640]  the tech elite receive when they go and do acid at Burning Man is the same thing that Bill Joy
[3:27:13.640 --> 3:27:20.040]  warned about 20 years ago, that the tech elite believe that it's their mission to get rid of
[3:27:20.040 --> 3:27:26.680]  mankind? No, it's not. Now, people think Burning Man is just a bunch of hippies in the desert,
[3:27:26.680 --> 3:27:31.800]  a bunch of weirdos out there, and that's for the outer portico people. There's a whole other
[3:27:31.800 --> 3:27:36.920]  separate area that the Silicon Valley elite are closed off and nobody else is allowed to,
[3:27:36.920 --> 3:27:41.320]  and they do a circle, I don't know, there's drum circles or what they do, but they're all out
[3:27:41.320 --> 3:27:47.000]  there tripping and getting revelations from the clockwork elves, the machine elves, right? It's
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:51.400]  the same entities. Why do you think the machine elves always tell the people on DMT to kill
[3:27:51.400 --> 3:27:57.000]  everybody? They always say the same, if you just build a global government, we will be your friends,
[3:27:57.000 --> 3:28:03.000]  it will be a utopia, we love you, by the way, kill everybody, right? The same message of
[3:28:03.640 --> 3:28:10.280]  Gil Bates and all of these, you know, tech elites. It's the same thing. Now, why is it the same?
[3:28:10.280 --> 3:28:13.400]  Why does everybody have the same worldview? I mean, how come they're not just coming up with
[3:28:13.400 --> 3:28:19.080]  different things? If there's not a coordinated spiritual element to all of this that most people
[3:28:19.080 --> 3:28:25.880]  haven't noticed, well, it's right in our faces. It's staring everybody directly in the face. Now,
[3:28:25.880 --> 3:28:33.320]  when we come back, we'll get into what Bill Joyce says the plans are for 2010 and 2030. So, remember,
[3:28:33.320 --> 3:28:38.280]  he wrote this in 2000 and he says, here's what's going to be the case in 2010, and then the big,
[3:28:38.280 --> 3:28:43.240]  big year will be 2030. And he says, those are going to be big years for bringing in this
[3:28:43.240 --> 3:28:49.400]  technocratic global government. And for the issues of the population, he talks about this,
[3:28:50.200 --> 3:28:53.720]  brain chips and bodily modification don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
[3:28:54.520 --> 3:29:00.360]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because
[3:29:00.360 --> 3:29:05.240]  I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support,
[3:29:05.800 --> 3:29:10.120]  and for word of mouth. And then we're all this together. And I, you know, you get told having
[3:29:10.120 --> 3:29:13.640]  to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:29:13.640 --> 3:29:17.560]  But it's true. We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this
[3:29:17.560 --> 3:29:22.360]  level that is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and almost shut
[3:29:22.360 --> 3:29:26.360]  down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups. And we're still here. And as this whole
[3:29:26.360 --> 3:29:31.080]  new world order comes out in the open, our credibility's going up. That's why we've got to
[3:29:31.080 --> 3:29:34.760]  be taken off air. That's why America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other
[3:29:34.760 --> 3:29:39.880]  nations enslaved. And America's still quasi free. You can't have info wars has been proven
[3:29:39.880 --> 3:29:44.360]  right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold. Because if you think stuff's
[3:29:44.360 --> 3:29:49.240]  bad now, just get ready. So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com. Get some great 2020
[3:29:49.240 --> 3:29:53.080]  election shirts, supplements and so much more. They're wonderful products and they support the
[3:29:53.080 --> 3:30:00.680]  info. We're thank you. Globalist General Milley has revealed to the world that the United States
[3:30:01.240 --> 3:30:05.960]  is not a free republic, but it's run by a permanent state by a network bureaucracy.
[3:30:05.960 --> 3:30:10.760]  The big takeaway here is that he didn't act alone. He felt that he was safe to talk
[3:30:11.480 --> 3:30:16.280]  of an overseas phone line system that he was being watched by not just our government,
[3:30:16.280 --> 3:30:21.240]  the Five Eyes, the Russians, and the Chinese. He wanted the world to know that he was proud
[3:30:21.240 --> 3:30:26.040]  of what he was doing because he was backed by the deep state. This permanent bureaucracy sees
[3:30:26.040 --> 3:30:31.960]  America as its enemy. It sees the American people as its enemy. It sees prosperity as its enemy.
[3:30:31.960 --> 3:30:36.840]  And it conspired with the Communist Chinese to threaten them basically and say, Trump may nuke
[3:30:36.840 --> 3:30:42.280]  you, but if he tries, we'll call and say we're attacking you so you can respond first. That's
[3:30:42.280 --> 3:30:47.960]  beyond treason. But it shows the type of anti-American sycophants living in their own vetted bubble
[3:30:47.960 --> 3:30:52.840]  that try to get away with this. Milley and all of his accomplices seem to go to prison now for life.
[3:30:55.080 --> 3:31:01.400]  Around the world, the general public has woken up the fact that this isn't a left or right issue.
[3:31:01.400 --> 3:31:09.320]  This is a global, corporate, agenda 21, agenda 2030, great reset, takeover. This is a technocracy.
[3:31:10.520 --> 3:31:16.840]  But very few leaders, Orban, Bolsonaro, and just a few others, are addressing it for what it is
[3:31:16.840 --> 3:31:25.320]  to their people. A foreign, anti-human, anti-family, anti-God takeover of the very biological system
[3:31:25.320 --> 3:31:30.280]  of humans. This is a corporate takeover of our bodies, of ourselves, with the world ID,
[3:31:30.280 --> 3:31:34.840]  the medical tracking system that will be tied to the carbon taxes. It's all been announced.
[3:31:34.840 --> 3:31:40.680]  It is a dystopic nightmare, and humanity is starting to organize, but our leaders aren't.
[3:31:40.680 --> 3:31:45.720]  We need Senator Paul and Senator Holley and others that have shown some understanding of this
[3:31:45.720 --> 3:31:50.920]  and Senator Cruz to organize against this foreign, multinational, corporate takeovers,
[3:31:50.920 --> 3:31:54.360]  or big pharma, big banks, and big tech, or we have no hope.
[3:31:55.080 --> 3:31:59.880]  And in addition, we were really finding that we were stressing the cardiopulmonary systems of
[3:31:59.880 --> 3:32:04.760]  these employees. Because when you cover the mouth and nose and you exert physical energy
[3:32:04.760 --> 3:32:09.800]  during your work, during your task, whatever it might be, you're really stressing the cardiopulmonary
[3:32:09.800 --> 3:32:15.240]  system because you change the way that you breathe. You have to forcibly inhale and forcibly exhale.
[3:32:15.240 --> 3:32:20.920]  That taxes the heart. It taxes the lungs. And we have given people heart attacks by allowing them
[3:32:20.920 --> 3:32:28.520]  to work with their mouth and nose covered with absolutely no regulation, no oversight, no medical
[3:32:28.520 --> 3:32:33.080]  oversight. The globalists have told us we're a disease. They've told us they want to eradicate
[3:32:33.080 --> 3:32:37.880]  us. And all the studies show that when you wear these masks, it lowers your oxygen level up to
[3:32:37.880 --> 3:32:43.640]  one third and gives you dangerous levels of carbon dioxide poisoning. This is a sick cult,
[3:32:43.640 --> 3:32:48.440]  and we've got to say no. But the only way the real science is out of the public is if we
[3:32:48.440 --> 3:32:54.360]  tell them, get your copy today of COVIDland and expose them. It's covidland.com. Go there now.
[3:32:54.360 --> 3:33:00.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:14.760 --> 3:33:18.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show under Justin J. Dyer. In this analysis, we are working through
[3:33:18.680 --> 3:33:27.000]  the Bill Joy essay from 2000, why the future doesn't need us a warning or revelation. Who knows
[3:33:27.000 --> 3:33:33.560]  exactly, but the essay is basically saying what the tech elite had planned to do a long time ago,
[3:33:33.560 --> 3:33:38.200]  several decades ago. And now what we're seeing is, of course, this rolled out before everyone's
[3:33:38.200 --> 3:33:44.680]  eyes. Now, he had said that a couple of key years would come into play. 2010 would be a big year
[3:33:44.680 --> 3:33:49.960]  that things would be rolled out. And then he says by 2030, he says that we will be likely able to
[3:33:49.960 --> 3:33:55.160]  build the machines in quantity a million times more powerful than the computer personal computers
[3:33:55.160 --> 3:34:01.400]  up today. And these will be sufficient to implement the dreams of Ray Kurzweil. Now,
[3:34:01.400 --> 3:34:08.920]  he moves on to say that by 2030, the idea will be such that the technology will basically be
[3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:15.320]  far beyond any need for humanity at all. So in other words, the bots will be able to do everything
[3:34:15.320 --> 3:34:20.680]  across the board better than the humans. And he goes on to say that we might be able to extend life,
[3:34:20.680 --> 3:34:29.640]  but this will only be really for the elites. In fact, bodily modification and the implementation
[3:34:29.640 --> 3:34:38.760]  of chips into the body will be the norm by 2030. So you have these shills out there saying that
[3:34:38.760 --> 3:34:44.360]  nobody is going to put a chip in a vaccine as if anybody thought that a microchip was what's in
[3:34:44.360 --> 3:34:48.920]  the vaccine is just totally stupid, right? No, it's nanotech, right? And so that's what Bill
[3:34:48.920 --> 3:34:54.760]  Joy talks about is that it won't be like, you know, a chip the size of a grain of rice that it'll
[3:34:54.760 --> 3:35:02.360]  be, it'll be way beyond that it will be microchips or excuse me, nanotech chips, nano nanotech inside
[3:35:02.360 --> 3:35:07.160]  the body diagnosing you telling you what you need to do. And what did we just see in the last few
[3:35:07.160 --> 3:35:15.240]  months, right? Was it CBS, DARPA, right? On ABC or CBS in public, you know, 60 minutes, news
[3:35:15.240 --> 3:35:23.240]  piece is saying that now the nanotechnology will be able to diagnose you in your bloodstream,
[3:35:23.240 --> 3:35:29.960]  right, to tell through sensors, right, relaying information. So this is a version of genetic
[3:35:29.960 --> 3:35:34.120]  engineering and bodily modification. Again, what this whole UK transhumanist document is about.
[3:35:34.120 --> 3:35:38.520]  Now, if I don't have time to get to the UK transhumanist document next time I'm on, I'm on,
[3:35:38.520 --> 3:35:44.600]  I'll cover the totality of that important white paper that was just recently declassified.
[3:35:46.120 --> 3:35:52.360]  Bill Joy says that genetic modification you might think has to do with food. You might think, oh,
[3:35:52.360 --> 3:35:58.520]  this has to do with, you know, franken foods, potatoes, tomatoes. No, no, no, it's actually
[3:35:58.520 --> 3:36:04.520]  preparing the way for human modification and cloning. And so he understood back then that
[3:36:05.560 --> 3:36:11.080]  the whole GMO revolution wasn't about food. That was only one angle of it. The GMO revolution was
[3:36:11.080 --> 3:36:16.280]  about the genetic modification of all biological life forms. The very thing that Klaus has just
[3:36:16.280 --> 3:36:21.400]  come out and said in the last couple years was the plan all along. We will turn you from biology
[3:36:21.400 --> 3:36:27.240]  into a synthetic being. Synthetic biology, as we saw, was a big part of the lockstep document.
[3:36:27.240 --> 3:36:34.040]  Remember when we covered the Rockefeller lockstep document? It said that by 2010, 2020, 2030,
[3:36:34.040 --> 3:36:39.640]  synthetic biology would be a huge issue of debate that they would be bringing in.
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:46.760]  Bill Joy's essay is saying that it's an issue of debate. And he even says that human cloning
[3:36:49.400 --> 3:36:53.960]  it'll be spun as like an ethical issue. Oh, should we do it? Should we do it? Well,
[3:36:53.960 --> 3:37:00.520]  how else will we save everybody? How else will we offer everybody all of these grand medical
[3:37:01.400 --> 3:37:06.360]  advances? And we'll give you a genetically engineered baby who will have a high IQ and
[3:37:06.360 --> 3:37:13.560]  he'll have, you know, he'll be more fit if you just let us use the CRISPR technology too.
[3:37:13.560 --> 3:37:20.120]  But remember, the same people saying that they're going to give you all these great things are the
[3:37:20.120 --> 3:37:26.520]  same people who also say everyone needs to die. So understand that it's a lie. They're selling you
[3:37:26.520 --> 3:37:32.600]  a lie as if you will get access to any of this stuff. No, you won't. And they even tell you you
[3:37:32.600 --> 3:37:39.160]  won't. But also, by the way, you should support them in this endeavor. It reminds me of H.D. Wells.
[3:37:39.160 --> 3:37:44.840]  It was either in open conspiracy or in New World Order, where he says, I'm not joking, he says
[3:37:44.840 --> 3:37:51.880]  basically, no, nobody out here reading my book will go into the future and you don't get access to
[3:37:51.880 --> 3:37:56.680]  this. But you all should die for it because it's at least a noble thing for you to die for. So
[3:37:56.680 --> 3:38:01.720]  wouldn't you rather die for something noble than just, you know, pursuing your own pleasures?
[3:38:01.720 --> 3:38:08.440]  So that's literally how I mean, it's like, it's like Dahmer and, you know, Hannibal Lecter are
[3:38:08.440 --> 3:38:13.800]  running the whole thing. But they're just better at their crimes, right? Like Dahmer and Hannibal
[3:38:13.800 --> 3:38:17.480]  Lecter and like they got caught. You know, I know he's a fictional character, but he represents all
[3:38:17.480 --> 3:38:22.520]  the serial killers. So there's like serial killers that are just better at hiding their crimes that
[3:38:22.520 --> 3:38:29.800]  are running the whole thing. And when you understand that's the mindset, the psychopathy, right? And
[3:38:29.800 --> 3:38:35.320]  when you understand criminal thought, then it makes sense how they do what they do and why they do
[3:38:35.320 --> 3:38:43.320]  what they do. And criminal psychopaths, they love to show and tell in your face what they do, right?
[3:38:43.320 --> 3:38:48.280]  I'm going to kill you. And then when they are murdering you, I'm not killing you. I'm not doing
[3:38:48.280 --> 3:38:52.600]  this. This is all in your head. I'm just stabbing you, but I'm not really stabbing you because
[3:38:52.600 --> 3:38:56.360]  you think I'm stabbing you, but I'm not, right? So it's, it's a gaslighting. It's these are all
[3:38:56.360 --> 3:39:01.080]  techniques of abusers. It's psychology 101. Everybody knows there's a million YouTube videos,
[3:39:01.720 --> 3:39:07.240]  right, about psychopaths and narcissists, right? And how they gaslight, how they abuse. Well,
[3:39:07.240 --> 3:39:11.560]  guess what? The people at the top of the power structure are gaslighting abuser psychopaths.
[3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:17.720]  So they lie. Have you figured this out? They lie to you, right? They're not going to give you
[3:39:18.360 --> 3:39:22.520]  the technology when they tell you that they're going to put nanotech in your bloodstream. It's
[3:39:22.520 --> 3:39:30.520]  not to heal you. They're Malthusians. Anyway, so it goes on to say that we have to worry about
[3:39:30.520 --> 3:39:35.320]  the nanotech. What are we going to do? I don't know if you see it. This is kind of a weird wacky
[3:39:35.320 --> 3:39:39.560]  conspiracy theory that's been around for many years. The black goo, right? I'm not going to go
[3:39:39.560 --> 3:39:44.200]  to the black goo, but he kind of mentions it in passing, which I didn't expect in the Bill Joy
[3:39:44.200 --> 3:39:50.120]  essay. He says that what if, you know, basically gray goo, which is self replicating nanotech,
[3:39:50.120 --> 3:39:54.680]  what if it replicates and takes over everything? Again, I don't really think that there's any,
[3:39:54.680 --> 3:39:59.560]  there's such a thing as black goo, but it's interesting given that Gretza, by the way,
[3:39:59.560 --> 3:40:04.280]  was just on the cover of some magazine that was like a guardian magazine or something like that.
[3:40:04.280 --> 3:40:12.440]  And she's covered in black goo. Again, I think it's supposed to signify oil, right? Because Gretta
[3:40:12.440 --> 3:40:16.040]  is, you know, against big oil, and she's going to save us from the evil oil companies.
[3:40:17.080 --> 3:40:21.480]  Even the oil comes out of the earth, right? It's not a toxic thing. It actually comes out of the
[3:40:21.480 --> 3:40:26.520]  earth. And then at the same time, right, we've got these climate activists saying blow up oil
[3:40:26.520 --> 3:40:29.880]  pipeline. There's nothing wrong with that because it's for the climate. It's for the earth, right?
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:37.160]  All of this is, I think, programming. It's predictive programming. It's engineering you to
[3:40:37.160 --> 3:40:45.000]  understand and believe that the nature, man, humans, environment is inherently toxic, right?
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:50.120]  That was a big part of all the mass, all the Coofit nonsense, was getting everybody afraid of
[3:40:50.120 --> 3:40:55.480]  things. It's like hypochondria, right? Being afraid of things that are armless. Those things are
[3:40:55.480 --> 3:41:00.840]  going to kill you. But that's a big part of, right, if we go back to the global elite document,
[3:41:00.840 --> 3:41:05.640]  the first global revolution of the global realm, they said in that document that we will invent
[3:41:06.200 --> 3:41:13.240]  the problem of pollution as man to make mankind basically guilty, right? It's a guilt trip.
[3:41:13.800 --> 3:41:18.520]  And if you just look at everything that Gretta does in her propaganda, it's a guilt trip, right?
[3:41:18.520 --> 3:41:24.120]  I'll tell you, I should be in school, right? And she's back on the cover of all these magazines
[3:41:24.120 --> 3:41:31.320]  covered in black goo because, what, like, oil? I mean, it's just crazy, right? It makes no sense,
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:35.560]  right? I wish you got, you should show that. I think it's a Saturday magazine. There you go.
[3:41:35.560 --> 3:41:39.560]  Yeah. So there's Gretta covered in black oil, one-eye symbolism, right? So she's enlightened,
[3:41:39.560 --> 3:41:45.400]  she's illuminate, confirm, right? And she's going to fight, that time is now to take down
[3:41:45.400 --> 3:41:50.120]  all the oil companies. Timed exactly with the guy that Alex just covered, what, yesterday,
[3:41:50.120 --> 3:41:54.520]  the day before, saying bomb the pipelines, it's okay to do that because if you're a leftist,
[3:41:54.520 --> 3:42:01.000]  you can do terror, right? If you believe in family values, if you want to have kids,
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:05.800]  if you want to go to church, you're a terrorist. Oh, but if you want to blow up pipelines, that's cool.
[3:42:08.440 --> 3:42:15.000]  Now, Bill Joy goes on to say in this essay that he got all of his worldview from science fiction.
[3:42:15.000 --> 3:42:19.480]  Interesting. That's exactly what I've been telling you for many years, right? Science fiction is
[3:42:19.480 --> 3:42:25.480]  actually programming. It's sci-fi, illuminous programming to raise people in the last few
[3:42:25.480 --> 3:42:31.400]  decades, in the last 50 years or so, into a new worldview that would prep them for transhumanism.
[3:42:31.400 --> 3:42:37.160]  So literally all the sci-fi of the last several decades was just preparation and programming
[3:42:37.160 --> 3:42:43.880]  for people to accept the, the Malthusian technocratic transhumanist depopulation post-humanist
[3:42:43.880 --> 3:42:48.360]  worldview. That's what all, that's all it was for. And yeah, there's some great sci-fi. I
[3:42:48.360 --> 3:42:52.760]  enjoy science fiction, but we have to understand it was all their program and Bill Joy admits that
[3:42:52.760 --> 3:42:58.280]  in this essay. Stay right there. An ultimate fluoride free charcoal mouth wash is now available

[3:44:59.240 --> 3:45:03.000]  Granny do right. Granny do right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[3:45:03.000 --> 3:45:08.520]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and we're all the
[3:45:08.520 --> 3:45:13.560]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me. I was loaded up with
[3:45:13.560 --> 3:45:19.480]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[3:45:19.480 --> 3:45:27.000]  years, my skin is just really gorgeous. Actually, people think I'm 55 years old. And I was already
[3:45:27.000 --> 3:45:31.320]  taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do
[3:45:31.320 --> 3:45:35.480]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I mean,
[3:45:35.480 --> 3:45:41.240]  it doesn't happen immediately. But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you
[3:45:41.240 --> 3:45:46.760]  know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't, I don't have to put
[3:45:46.760 --> 3:45:52.520]  it on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally
[3:45:52.520 --> 3:46:00.280]  cleared up my skin. Could you imagine a year ago walking into a bank with your face covered?
[3:46:00.840 --> 3:46:04.600]  Could you imagine even going into the grocery store? Do you think they would let you in?
[3:46:04.600 --> 3:46:08.120]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles to make sure that you weren't going to be
[3:46:08.120 --> 3:46:14.440]  shoplifting? Could you imagine going up to a gas station and going inside the little
[3:46:14.440 --> 3:46:19.160]  mini mart to pay for your gas with a bandana on? How far do you think that would get you?
[3:46:19.160 --> 3:46:23.560]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school with it with a shield that looks like a
[3:46:23.560 --> 3:46:32.600]  space alien? Those things are offensive to us because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[3:46:32.600 --> 3:46:36.200]  The globalists are running a psychological war for operational humanity.
[3:46:36.200 --> 3:46:42.120]  Only waking up to the great reset in its tyranny will save us. And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[3:46:42.120 --> 3:46:46.200]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud and that it's dangerous and that it causes major
[3:46:46.200 --> 3:46:51.000]  medical issues and it's dehumanizing. And the film COVID land does that. Secure your copy now

[3:47:19.000 --> 3:47:24.040]  Be sure and support the Info War by going to the Info War Store and getting those absolutely
[3:47:24.040 --> 3:47:32.200]  necessary survival items, supplements, pretty much books, DVDs, all of that. So this is the
[3:47:32.200 --> 3:47:37.960]  front line of fighting this global elite takeover. So be sure and support the Info War
[3:47:37.960 --> 3:47:42.360]  crew. And also if you would go to J's analysis and you can support me by subscribing to get
[3:47:42.360 --> 3:47:47.880]  access to the second part of all the lectures, talks going through at least 50 plus of these
[3:47:47.880 --> 3:47:51.320]  global elite writings over the last several years, including Tragedy and Hope. And speaking
[3:47:51.320 --> 3:47:57.000]  of Tragedy and Hope by Dr. Carol Quigley, there's quite a bit of information in the
[3:47:57.000 --> 3:48:02.120]  middle of Bill Joyce's essay where he talks about things that would suggest to me that he
[3:48:02.120 --> 3:48:08.760]  perhaps is retrading Hope because he goes into the banking elite, the United Nations and how out of
[3:48:08.760 --> 3:48:13.960]  the two world wars we got the movement towards this global government. He talks about the
[3:48:15.400 --> 3:48:21.080]  Cold War period basically being this situation where the Star Wars Defense Initiative
[3:48:21.080 --> 3:48:28.440]  was there to erect the nascent kind of infrastructure of the technocracy. So even though a lot of
[3:48:28.440 --> 3:48:34.760]  that technology is outdated, what he's basically saying is that World War I, World War II prepared
[3:48:34.760 --> 3:48:41.560]  us for the global world order, which via the United Nations, the United Nations basically
[3:48:41.560 --> 3:48:50.120]  was able to move throughout the Cold War to erect this better option to end the World Wars. And
[3:48:50.120 --> 3:48:56.760]  he talks about how the banking elite planned after World War II to use the threat of nukes.
[3:48:56.760 --> 3:49:01.160]  Oh, we're all going to be nuked. And though the only answer to nukes is to have global government,
[3:49:01.160 --> 3:49:05.080]  which again, Quigley talks about that. There's a whole chapter in Tragedy and Hope about how
[3:49:05.080 --> 3:49:13.160]  nuclear threat, nuclear defense was a major impetus during the Cold War for there to be the
[3:49:13.160 --> 3:49:20.120]  so-called need for a global governor. So the Cold War is crucial in this. And this is what
[3:49:20.120 --> 3:49:24.840]  Star Wars Defense Initiative comes out of. That's where DARPA comes from. DARPA, of course, is a
[3:49:24.840 --> 3:49:31.880]  huge part of where this whole move towards transhumanism is located, right? The Brain Initiative,
[3:49:31.880 --> 3:49:36.920]  the Salk Institute, all of that is DARPA, all of that is Rand Corporation, all of that is,
[3:49:37.800 --> 3:49:41.000]  if you read Alex Abaya's book on the Rand Corporation, he talks about all this. If you
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:44.600]  read Annie Jacobson's book on the history of DARPA, which I've covered in my lectures, the whole
[3:49:44.600 --> 3:49:50.680]  500-page book, it's all saying that the same tech elite, right, the Jason group, these people,
[3:49:50.680 --> 3:49:58.680]  are behind the movement towards this new technocratic global order, which mandates as a dogma.
[3:49:58.680 --> 3:50:02.840]  Well, I thought this was about science and free thought. No, no, no, it's a dogma. It's a cult.
[3:50:02.840 --> 3:50:07.400]  You have to be anti-human. You can't be in this cult without being anti-human. That's what Bill
[3:50:07.400 --> 3:50:12.360]  Joy's saying. He's saying that they all said, basically, the tech elite, that you got to be
[3:50:12.360 --> 3:50:17.880]  anti-human or you can't be in the cult. That's it. And only the anti-human people who accept
[3:50:17.880 --> 3:50:25.720]  the transhumanist gospel are allowed it. Now, to get this, it's a religion. Do you understand
[3:50:25.720 --> 3:50:33.160]  that transhumanism is part of an inner core religion? I'll give you one example. There's
[3:50:33.160 --> 3:50:40.440]  a couple famous occultists of the 20th century. Take somebody like Alistair Crowley or Jack Parsons.
[3:50:40.440 --> 3:50:45.560]  You probably heard of Jack Parsons because Jack Parsons is the father of rocketry in terms of
[3:50:45.560 --> 3:50:51.880]  Jet Propulsion Laboratory, right, JPL or Jack Parsons Labs, right, out in California. And Jack
[3:50:51.880 --> 3:51:00.040]  Parsons believed that rocketry and technology was a magical working of science to transcend humanity.
[3:51:00.040 --> 3:51:05.160]  Crowley himself thought the same thing. The Crowleyan religion in ethos is one where man
[3:51:05.160 --> 3:51:12.840]  transcends man and storms the gates of heaven to retake heaven for man, the apotheosis of man.
[3:51:13.960 --> 3:51:19.240]  And so the tech elite, whether or not they're all part of the same secret society, I don't know.
[3:51:19.240 --> 3:51:25.000]  It's possible. But regardless, they have the same worldview. That is their modus operandi.
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:31.400]  That is their religion. It is a Luciferian Gnostic technocratic worldview. And Bill Joy is saying
[3:51:31.400 --> 3:51:38.200]  that in this essay. Now, he's saying, I have problems with this, right? He's saying, I tried
[3:51:38.200 --> 3:51:45.320]  to reason. I want to come up with an ethic, he says, whereby we don't kill everybody.
[3:51:45.320 --> 3:51:51.160]  So we'll give Bill Joy props for that. I don't think he successfully finds an ethic because he
[3:51:51.160 --> 3:51:56.520]  says, I'm looking at the world religions. Should we follow the Dalai Lama? I'm sorry, but the Dalai
[3:51:56.520 --> 3:52:01.000]  Lama is basically like the mystery man from Sphinx. He's not going to get us there. He's not going
[3:52:01.000 --> 3:52:09.400]  to give us a coherent ethic to oppose this global technocratic order. And in fact, by the way,
[3:52:10.440 --> 3:52:16.440]  one thing I didn't expect to see in this essay was Bill Joy actually saying, I met and talked to
[3:52:16.440 --> 3:52:21.320]  Jacques Adelie. What do you know? Jacques Adelie, who's one of the top global elites that I've covered
[3:52:21.320 --> 3:52:25.720]  his books, Brief History of the Future. He says, I went and met with Jacques Adelie.
[3:52:26.360 --> 3:52:35.800]  And we talked and we tried to come up with a humane, humanist ethic to kind of try to slow down
[3:52:35.800 --> 3:52:45.320]  or stop this post-human kill everybody worldview and attitude. So my take on this is that basically,
[3:52:45.320 --> 3:52:51.320]  I think Bill Joy was probably just a tech guy who wanted to build a successful company and to
[3:52:51.960 --> 3:52:56.440]  modify code and write good code or whatever. And then he realized when they got really successful
[3:52:56.440 --> 3:53:01.400]  and he was introduced to this inner core, oh, wait a minute, like to be a part of this,
[3:53:01.960 --> 3:53:06.760]  like you really have to join a group that wants to kill everybody. And so you can tell in this
[3:53:06.760 --> 3:53:14.760]  essay, he's kind of like, I don't know what to do with this. And if you don't have a spiritual
[3:53:14.760 --> 3:53:21.800]  attitude, if you don't have a biblical worldview, you're going to be kind of adrift and scared
[3:53:21.800 --> 3:53:27.800]  and fall into this. And you can detect this in the essay where he kind of says, I don't know
[3:53:27.800 --> 3:53:32.920]  how to deal with this. I don't know how to, I mean, who's fighting this? Who even knows about
[3:53:32.920 --> 3:53:36.840]  this? I mean, imagine in 2000, who would have even thought, I mean, there was Alex, yeah, but
[3:53:36.840 --> 3:53:42.280]  beyond Alex, there weren't a whole lot of outlets out there saying the tech elite want to kill everybody
[3:53:42.280 --> 3:53:48.600]  and they want to have a transhumanist world government, right? And so he says that, I tried
[3:53:48.600 --> 3:53:52.840]  to look through the world religions and the best I could come up with is some kind of like happiness
[3:53:53.720 --> 3:53:59.160]  and we should be happy and everybody should be happy. And then obviously that's just meaningless,
[3:53:59.160 --> 3:54:06.520]  right? I mean, what does it mean to be happy? We don't even know. But again, what's evident is
[3:54:06.520 --> 3:54:12.040]  that he mentions all the things that I just told you, all of these supposedly non-existent
[3:54:12.040 --> 3:54:17.000]  conspiratorial things. He's actually saying and telling you what the elite talk about, right?
[3:54:17.000 --> 3:54:22.600]  He's talking about meeting with Jacques Atelier. He's talking about Los Alamos laboratories,
[3:54:23.400 --> 3:54:29.560]  Jack Parsons. He's talking about United Nations being the nascent form of the global government
[3:54:29.560 --> 3:54:33.000]  and the Cold War leading to where we are now, right? He's talking about the same stuff that
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:36.040]  you see the World Economic Forum talking about because he's meeting the people who are in
[3:54:36.040 --> 3:54:42.520]  clouds of circles, right? Same types of people. And he's saying that we got to figure out how to
[3:54:42.520 --> 3:54:50.520]  combat this because if we know that the lure and the temptation of the tech
[3:54:51.560 --> 3:54:57.960]  will be the end of humanity. Now, again, Bill Joy is not a Christian, so he's limited in his
[3:54:58.520 --> 3:55:03.720]  approach to these issues, right? He's like, he's touching on the edges of the spiritual
[3:55:03.720 --> 3:55:09.000]  elements of it, realizing that it's like something else going on here, right? You can almost sense
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:14.360]  that he sees it's a demonic plan, but he doesn't have a worldview where he has a belief in the
[3:55:14.360 --> 3:55:20.840]  demonic, so he doesn't know what to do with this information. And I see this essay as kind of like
[3:55:20.840 --> 3:55:25.880]  the summit of worldly wisdom and the limitations of worldly wisdom of, okay, so this is the options
[3:55:25.880 --> 3:55:31.080]  here. You're either going to be a Christian or you're going to be a demonic, satanic, luciferian
[3:55:31.080 --> 3:55:35.880]  who's committed to killing everybody. Well, I guess what? You can't, you're not going to win
[3:55:36.440 --> 3:55:41.320]  when you want to kill everybody, right? And every story with serial killers and psychopaths tells us
[3:55:41.320 --> 3:55:47.320]  this, right? Does Jeffrey Dahmer come to a good end? Does Hannibal Lecter come to a good end?
[3:55:48.600 --> 3:55:53.880]  No, right? Psychopaths, serial killers, they end up being their own worst enemies, right?
[3:55:55.000 --> 3:55:58.840]  And you know, Scripture Proverbs says he that digs a pit falls into his own pit, right?
[3:55:58.840 --> 3:56:04.760]  So I don't, I didn't have time to get into it at this point, this juncture, but in the next hour
[3:56:04.760 --> 3:56:10.760]  that I host, I will go through the entire recent UK transhumanist document that is just mind-blowing.
[3:56:11.480 --> 3:56:16.840]  Just a few tidbits here at the beginning. It was amazing to read this document because it says
[3:56:18.120 --> 3:56:25.240]  that what's coming in the next couple decades, particularly 2030, 2050 or key years, remember
[3:56:25.240 --> 3:56:32.120]  all the white papers always talk about certain key decades and periods, 2030, 2050. These will be
[3:56:32.120 --> 3:56:38.520]  the eras when they bring in the chips, the mass chipping, that could be nanotech, right?
[3:56:38.520 --> 3:56:42.120]  Attacking of the population, the cattle, as Bill Joyce said, the elite U.S. has.
[3:56:43.400 --> 3:56:48.120]  And the alteration of the worldview is such that most people will have to go away.
[3:56:48.120 --> 3:56:52.680]  Now, this document begins by saying that humans are no longer human resources,
[3:56:52.680 --> 3:56:57.160]  as they used to be referred to as the cattle in the white papers. Now there are platforms.
[3:56:57.880 --> 3:57:03.960]  A human is just a platform in a node of the matrix that's being built in the here and the now,
[3:57:03.960 --> 3:57:11.640]  the replacement of the biology with the synthetic. The biological sphere will be overwritten
[3:57:11.640 --> 3:57:19.320]  with the synthetic and this will be done through nanotech, through RFID, through human augmentation.
[3:57:19.320 --> 3:57:23.880]  So the key thing to remember here is that now humans are basically just seen as like
[3:57:23.880 --> 3:57:28.920]  Wi-Fi's and walking transmitter computers. That's it. You're just a receiver and a transmitter
[3:57:28.920 --> 3:57:34.200]  in a vast node of what will be the global brain. That's what this document says at the very beginning,
[3:57:34.200 --> 3:57:41.560]  right now. Now it's time to transition to see humans as platform, as walking robot cows,
[3:57:41.560 --> 3:57:51.560]  robot cattle. That's all you are.
