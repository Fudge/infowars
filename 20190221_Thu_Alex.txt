[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[00:11.480 --> 00:23.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:23.120 --> 00:33.360]  Deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[00:33.360 --> 00:35.320]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now.
[00:35.320 --> 00:40.440]  There is no government official here, but I'll say that the press is not the enemy
[00:40.440 --> 00:41.560]  of the people.
[00:41.560 --> 01:00.920]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people, the press is not the enemy
[01:00.920 --> 01:01.920]  of the people.
[01:01.920 --> 01:22.440]  They came in peace.
[01:22.440 --> 01:24.680]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue.
[01:24.680 --> 01:30.440]  Like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake news, maybe we should go out, all journalists
[01:30.440 --> 01:45.800]  should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people.
[01:45.800 --> 01:47.160]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[01:47.160 --> 01:48.160]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[01:48.160 --> 01:49.160]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[01:49.160 --> 02:07.080]  This is CNN.
[02:07.080 --> 02:13.800]  This announcement today recognizes that Empire actor Jesse Smollett took advantage of the
[02:13.800 --> 02:19.280]  pain and anger of racism to promote his career.
[02:19.280 --> 02:23.400]  I'm left hanging in my head and asking why.
[02:23.400 --> 02:30.200]  Why would anyone, especially an African American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make
[02:30.200 --> 02:33.400]  false accusations?
[02:33.400 --> 02:40.640]  How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity
[02:40.640 --> 02:46.320]  to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?
[02:46.320 --> 02:51.720]  How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap
[02:51.720 --> 02:58.000]  everyone in this city in the face by making these false chalk claims?
[02:58.000 --> 03:11.160]  Locust police reports cause real harm.
[03:11.160 --> 03:19.240]  Alright, again Alex Jones here with a emergency report and we are about to take off here but
[03:19.240 --> 03:24.760]  I've got to let you know that I got a call right before I got on board from one of my
[03:24.760 --> 03:34.000]  high level sources that the FBI is criminally investigating not just Smollett but his handlers
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.600]  inside the production of Empire.
[03:36.600 --> 03:43.120]  Now I got a call two days ago basically telling me the same thing but now it's confirmed
[03:43.120 --> 03:48.200]  that they've intercepted information, they've already talked to witnesses, they confirmed
[03:48.200 --> 03:52.520]  that the whole show was basically wargaming how they could write a publicity stunt against
[03:52.520 --> 03:57.880]  Trump to try to even boost the ratings even higher so there's that motive and then also
[03:57.880 --> 04:03.160]  try to demonize Trump as part of this larger race war edition of the Democrats have pushed.
[04:03.160 --> 04:05.760]  So I'm about to take off and pull a lot of sense about the host of the show live but
[04:05.760 --> 04:09.280]  I want to start to broadcast so that you know that I'll be back tonight with more information
[04:09.280 --> 04:14.480]  on this during the war room, I'll be back tomorrow at my show to break it all down.
[04:14.480 --> 04:18.680]  But this thing can bring down the entire Obama operation, a false flag like this has been
[04:18.680 --> 04:24.320]  blown wide open out of the Chicago machine and the fact that it was so shoddily done
[04:24.320 --> 04:27.840]  and that Smollett was so arrogant up front he thought he'd get away with it.
[04:27.840 --> 04:31.640]  I think because he was backed by people so he doubled down, all of this is a perfect
[04:31.640 --> 04:37.160]  storm just like the criminal investigation, the indictments on Pelosi, Ford, that station
[04:37.160 --> 04:42.920]  event, the Covington kids, all this is coming together but Smollett is even bigger so Paul's
[04:42.920 --> 04:47.560]  coming up and then we're going to have a special report I followed earlier and Owen
[04:47.560 --> 04:53.320]  Troyer so much more but this is so big that this is directly linked to Obama and the Chicago
[04:53.320 --> 04:55.840]  big city machine and their overall operations.
[04:55.840 --> 05:09.720]  Look for the new war hill, Mary's purchase of things like this though.
[05:09.720 --> 05:16.120]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[05:16.120 --> 05:22.440]  energy drinks and energy supplements but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[05:22.440 --> 05:26.720]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few
[05:26.720 --> 05:28.800]  hours and have terrible side effects.
[05:28.800 --> 05:35.400]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[05:35.400 --> 05:38.240]  and beyond system in the world.
[05:38.240 --> 05:42.960]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it, it is a total game changer and it comes
[05:42.960 --> 05:47.680]  in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[05:47.680 --> 05:51.480]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts up to 10 hours so take a half packet
[05:51.480 --> 05:55.560]  the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you
[05:55.560 --> 05:56.560]  into overdrive.
[05:56.560 --> 06:20.040]  TurboForce and EnforceLive.com.
[06:20.040 --> 06:26.560]  Well, Jussie Smollett can finally breathe a sigh of relief because the prime suspect
[06:26.560 --> 06:34.000]  in the hate crime attack against him has finally been arrested and that prime suspect is Jussie
[06:34.000 --> 06:35.440]  Smollett.
[06:35.440 --> 06:39.680]  You heard Alex Jones talk about it in the intro to the show We Are Live on this February
[06:39.680 --> 06:49.240]  21st, 2019 edition, Donald J. Trump tweeted just about half an hour ago at Jussie Smollett,
[06:49.240 --> 06:54.920]  he tagged him in the tweet, what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted
[06:54.920 --> 06:58.520]  with your racist and dangerous comments?
[06:58.520 --> 07:02.600]  Because we've had the police press conference, a clip from which we played just before the
[07:02.600 --> 07:09.200]  break, where they say in that conference that the sole motivation or at least the primary
[07:09.200 --> 07:16.240]  motivation for Jussie Smollett staging this hate crime attack against himself was because
[07:16.240 --> 07:19.640]  he wanted a raise.
[07:19.640 --> 07:24.960]  He was not getting paid enough for his co-starring role on Empire.
[07:24.960 --> 07:29.040]  He's getting paid $65,000 per episode, okay?
[07:29.040 --> 07:31.600]  There are 18 episodes in a series.
[07:31.600 --> 07:32.600]  This is a hit show.
[07:32.600 --> 07:34.160]  It's not going to be cancelled anytime soon.
[07:34.160 --> 07:39.000]  Looks like Jussie Smollett's being cancelled because of this, obviously, but this guy was
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.880]  on $65,000 an episode.
[07:42.880 --> 07:51.000]  Yasha Ali tweets for the Huffington Post, scoop, a well-placed source familiar with his
[07:51.000 --> 07:56.880]  comp tells me Jussie Smollett was being paid $65,000 per episode for his co-starring role
[07:56.880 --> 07:57.880]  on Empire.
[07:57.880 --> 08:00.480]  Average season has 18 episodes.
[08:00.480 --> 08:05.000]  Police say his dissatisfaction with his salary let him to stage this hoax.
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.600]  Do you really believe that?
[08:07.600 --> 08:12.360]  $65,000 an episode, 18 episodes, over a million dollars.
[08:12.360 --> 08:14.920]  And that's his only motivation.
[08:14.920 --> 08:20.440]  When we have Smollett immediately after the alleged attack, which he staged according
[08:20.440 --> 08:26.640]  to the police, going to the scene of the crime, pointing up at the security camera, telling
[08:26.640 --> 08:30.960]  the cops, look, it's all being caught on camera.
[08:30.960 --> 08:31.960]  There it is.
[08:31.960 --> 08:33.200]  Just get the tapes.
[08:33.200 --> 08:36.960]  Unfortunately for Smollett, the camera was turned the other way.
[08:36.960 --> 08:42.320]  We saw the surveillance footage from the Nigerian brothers when they were buying the ski masks.
[08:42.320 --> 08:49.760]  The hats, the gloves, of course, the distinctive red baseball cap, which was supposed to represent
[08:49.760 --> 08:51.960]  a mega hat before the attack.
[08:51.960 --> 08:55.920]  That was all caught on surveillance camera released yesterday.
[08:55.920 --> 08:58.480]  This was meant to be caught on camera.
[08:58.480 --> 09:00.680]  This was meant to go viral.
[09:00.680 --> 09:05.000]  As even black civil rights leaders have said, this could have potentially started racial
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.520]  violence across the country, if not a race war.
[09:09.520 --> 09:16.560]  This was meant to be a media spectacle, blamed on Trump supporters to drag down his campaign
[09:16.560 --> 09:22.080]  to further this narrative that there's a wave of bigotry and hatred sweeping America.
[09:22.080 --> 09:25.400]  We know it is, but that's mainly leftist and antiphyotypes.
[09:25.400 --> 09:28.000]  But this was meant to put all that on Trump.
[09:28.000 --> 09:29.160]  It failed.
[09:29.160 --> 09:30.880]  It's now completely collapsed.
[09:30.880 --> 09:37.200]  But do you really believe that the only motivation for staging this hate crime, because of course,
[09:37.200 --> 09:43.280]  the first we learned that or it was reported that Smollat Fee had been written out of Empire,
[09:43.280 --> 09:47.520]  the hit show, that didn't really make sense because he was one of the most best loved
[09:47.520 --> 09:49.640]  characters on that show.
[09:49.640 --> 09:52.280]  That really fell by the wayside, that whole narrative.
[09:52.280 --> 09:55.640]  Now they're saying it's simply because he wanted to pay rise.
[09:55.640 --> 09:58.720]  I don't believe that's the only motivation.
[09:58.720 --> 10:03.320]  And in fact, there's a Mike Adams story, which is upon him for wars.com.
[10:03.320 --> 10:07.800]  The independent media just saved America from a bloody race war that the mainstream
[10:07.800 --> 10:10.440]  media was trying to start.
[10:10.440 --> 10:13.040]  And he makes the same point in this article.
[10:13.040 --> 10:17.840]  If this hadn't have been pulled apart within a matter of three weeks, this could have been
[10:17.840 --> 10:23.560]  blown to such grand proportions that it could have kickstarted some serious tension across
[10:23.560 --> 10:26.200]  the entire country.
[10:26.200 --> 10:29.840]  Mike Adams writes, in reviewing the Justice Smollat fiasco, it's important to note that
[10:29.840 --> 10:35.640]  Smollat staged his hate crime hoax in a location where he believed it would be caught and recorded
[10:35.640 --> 10:37.660]  on a surveillance camera.
[10:37.660 --> 10:39.280]  This wasn't just meant to be a report.
[10:39.280 --> 10:44.080]  This was meant to be a viral video, which is why he went straight to the scene of the
[10:44.080 --> 10:49.800]  crime with the police after they came to his apartment, pointed up at the surveillance
[10:49.800 --> 10:52.560]  camera and said, look, it's all on tape.
[10:52.560 --> 10:56.040]  It wasn't on tape because the camera was pointed the wrong way.
[10:56.040 --> 10:59.840]  Mike Adams continues, the purpose of this was to have video footage that the media would
[10:59.840 --> 11:05.600]  play up nationwide, fomenting an outbreak of racially charged violence that would ultimately
[11:05.600 --> 11:10.800]  lead to a full blown race war across America, which the media, of course, would blame on
[11:10.800 --> 11:12.800]  Trump.
[11:12.800 --> 11:17.000]  Now whether or not you believe it would lead to a race war, I think that's probably stretching
[11:17.000 --> 11:18.520]  it a bit.
[11:18.520 --> 11:23.240]  It would certainly have been used to demonize Trump supporters in the run up to the 2020
[11:23.240 --> 11:28.400]  election and bolster this narrative that there is this wave of hate sweep in the country,
[11:28.400 --> 11:33.440]  which again, as we've proven through all the fake hate crimes that have proven to be absolute
[11:33.440 --> 11:38.200]  hoaxes and the actual physical attacks which are mainly being carried out by the left,
[11:38.200 --> 11:40.840]  that narrative doesn't hold together for the media.
[11:40.840 --> 11:44.160]  This would have helped them glue it together.
[11:44.160 --> 11:48.240]  So Mike Adams put this article out saying, you know, if the alternative media didn't
[11:48.240 --> 11:53.200]  pick this apart, and let's not forget that at the start of this, it was a conspiracy
[11:53.200 --> 11:57.560]  theory to question whether this incident actually happened.
[11:57.560 --> 12:02.000]  You saw the tweets, you saw the news reports, even though CNN claimed, oh, we were just
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.280]  reporting the facts.
[12:03.280 --> 12:09.600]  No, they reported it as a definitive thing that this happened, that it was a racist homophobic
[12:09.600 --> 12:12.520]  attack, that it was carried out by Trump supporters.
[12:12.520 --> 12:18.160]  You still have the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a tweet out there saying precisely
[12:18.160 --> 12:23.600]  that again, a declarative statement that this was a racist homophobic attack.
[12:23.600 --> 12:31.520]  That tweet has got something like 140,000 likes, 35,000 retweets, it has not been pulled
[12:31.520 --> 12:33.840]  down.
[12:33.840 --> 12:38.040]  So I'm still quite skeptical that the only motivation in this could have been to get
[12:38.040 --> 12:39.120]  a pay raise.
[12:39.120 --> 12:44.360]  Obviously, it would have brought him increased visibility, maybe roles in other shows, because
[12:44.360 --> 12:49.880]  he would have been hailed as this big social justice icon, again, attracting to himself
[12:49.880 --> 12:54.840]  this victimhood mentality that's worn as a badge of honor now.
[12:54.840 --> 12:59.000]  But really, with the mega cap, with the staging, with the making sure it would be caught on
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.560]  surveillance cameras so it would go viral on the internet, you really believe that was
[13:02.560 --> 13:13.080]  the only motivation to boost his already quite substantial $65,000 per episode pay wage.
[13:13.080 --> 13:18.480]  Now the other aspect of this is, is he being treated with kid gloves?
[13:18.480 --> 13:22.040]  We've got an article up on him for wars.com right now.
[13:22.040 --> 13:26.600]  Report Chicago police officers upset at coddling of Jesse Smollett.
[13:26.600 --> 13:32.160]  Because if you notice, if you watch the press conference with the police chief there, right
[13:32.160 --> 13:37.640]  at the end, the final question, they asked him what would he consider to be justice for
[13:37.640 --> 13:44.680]  Jesse Smollett, and he said, well, one, to apologize to the city of Chicago, and two,
[13:44.680 --> 13:51.480]  to pay a fine to cover the costs of the investigation of this allegedly fake hate crime.
[13:51.480 --> 13:55.080]  And he said the police superintendent, that would be justice.
[13:55.080 --> 13:58.360]  He did not mention any jail time whatsoever.
[13:58.360 --> 14:04.520]  Now, of course, we know this felony comes with a one to three year jail time, but it
[14:04.520 --> 14:10.080]  looks like according to those comments made by Eddie Johnson, suggesting that if Smollett
[14:10.080 --> 14:15.320]  just apologized to the city of Chicago and paid a fine, that would mean justice.
[14:15.320 --> 14:20.840]  As many have speculated, doesn't look like he's going to get any jail time.
[14:20.840 --> 14:25.440]  Which again, emboldens other people at the leftist, if they planning on staging these
[14:25.440 --> 14:30.320]  attacks, and they know they're not going to be punished to the full extent of the law,
[14:30.320 --> 14:34.120]  that would embolden them even if, you know, they got caught.
[14:34.120 --> 14:39.120]  We have this article report Chicago police officers upset a coddling of Jesse Smollett.
[14:39.120 --> 14:44.080]  Says rank and file Chicago police officers are reportedly irate at the fact that actor
[14:44.080 --> 14:48.880]  Jesse Smollett is being treated with kid gloves by higher ups.
[14:48.880 --> 14:54.400]  And this source comes from Collette journalist Andy Engo, who says the rank and file officers
[14:54.400 --> 14:59.720]  at CPD are angry at how their PR is coddling Smollett with comments like this.
[14:59.720 --> 15:05.640]  The comment in question came from Chicago police spokesman Anthony Gwigley Emmy, who
[15:05.640 --> 15:13.480]  said last night that he understood the situation may be, quote, difficult emotionally for Smollett.
[15:13.480 --> 15:19.000]  And the authorities wanted to, quote, make this as diplomatic as possible.
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.080]  He didn't quite get the perp walk that Roger Stone received with, you know, how many what
[15:24.080 --> 15:30.320]  a dozen men armed with machine guns around his property, CNN being tipped off to his arrest
[15:30.320 --> 15:37.200]  beforehand, Jesse Smollett basically calmly walked into the police station at five a.m.
[15:37.200 --> 15:38.320]  There were no cameras.
[15:38.320 --> 15:39.920]  It was all straightforward.
[15:39.920 --> 15:40.920]  It was all smooth.
[15:40.920 --> 15:46.960]  So now apparently rank and file Chicago police officers are very angry that he's been treated
[15:46.960 --> 15:51.280]  with kid gloves despite being arrested for a felony offense.
[15:51.280 --> 15:54.120]  We'll be back with more on this on the other side.
[15:54.120 --> 15:59.720]  This is the Alex Jones show live breaking news infowars dot com will be back pain in

[20:24.720 --> 20:33.640]  The host, Paul Joseph Watson. Empire actor, Justice Smollett, turned himself into police.
[20:33.640 --> 20:38.160]  This morning, the Chicago police spokesman said, on a felony charge of disorderly conduct
[20:38.160 --> 20:43.560]  in filing a false police report, police said in the press conference, which was on earlier,
[20:43.560 --> 20:48.320]  which you probably saw some of, he played a clip, that the fake letter that was sent
[20:48.320 --> 20:55.480]  to the officers of the Empire production staff before this supposedly stage hate crime took
[20:55.480 --> 21:02.600]  place was also sent by Smollett to himself. Of course, working in coordination with the
[21:02.600 --> 21:08.800]  infamous Nigerian brothers, police superintendent Eddie Johnson said this announcement today
[21:08.800 --> 21:14.240]  recognizes the Empire actor, Justice Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism
[21:14.240 --> 21:20.760]  to promote his career. Now, I put out a video a couple of days ago called Justice Smollett
[21:20.760 --> 21:27.320]  is a complete idiot. And that really has been borne out. He supposedly paid the Nigerian
[21:27.320 --> 21:37.920]  brothers who helped him stage this attack $3,500 by check. So he left a record of the payment.
[21:37.920 --> 21:42.960]  He could have just paid them cash, no record, but he chose to pay them by check. He truly
[21:42.960 --> 21:50.840]  is a complete moron. There you see the classic CNN meme, which was in the video. Now I put
[21:50.840 --> 21:57.160]  up a poll on Twitter a few minutes ago. Do you really believe that a pay raise was Justice
[21:57.160 --> 22:05.680]  Smollett's only motive? He was already on $65K an episode with his hit show Empire.
[22:05.680 --> 22:13.920]  So you can go and vote on that poll on Twitter on my account at Prison Planet. So far, 85%
[22:13.920 --> 22:21.160]  say the motive was anti-Trump. Only 5% say that the motive was simply that he wanted
[22:21.160 --> 22:26.760]  a pay raise. 10% aren't sure or they just want to see the results. So that poll is live
[22:26.760 --> 22:32.720]  on Twitter. Because according to this report, which I mentioned before the break, some rank
[22:32.720 --> 22:37.240]  and file police officers within the Chicago Police Department are not very happy with
[22:37.240 --> 22:43.760]  their superiors about the treatment or the lack of harsh treatment being dished out to
[22:43.760 --> 22:49.760]  Justice Smollett. Now people watch the press conference with Superintendent, the police
[22:49.760 --> 22:56.400]  superintendent who said that he was convinced that the only motive was the pay raise. And
[22:56.400 --> 23:01.280]  crucially, the key question at the end of this press conference, he was asked what he
[23:01.280 --> 23:07.800]  thought Justice would look like for Justice Smollett. And the police superintendent, Eddie
[23:07.800 --> 23:15.800]  Johnson, suggested that if Smollett apologized and paid a fine, that that will be Justice.
[23:15.800 --> 23:21.680]  Now people disagreed with this on Twitter, saying that Eddie Johnson seemed very angry
[23:21.680 --> 23:27.520]  with what Smollett had done with the damage he'd done to Chicago as a city. But I don't
[23:27.520 --> 23:31.520]  know, they asked him the question directly and said, what does Justice look like to you?
[23:31.520 --> 23:36.640]  And he said an apology and a fine. He did not mention prison time. And this is the police
[23:36.640 --> 23:41.400]  superintendent. So will he get away with it with just a slap on the wrist? According
[23:41.400 --> 23:49.880]  to Andy Engo of Quillette, he talked to rank and file officers at the CPD and they're angry
[23:49.880 --> 23:55.440]  at how their PR is coddling Smollett with comments like this. The comment was that it
[23:55.440 --> 23:59.920]  would be difficult emotionally for Smollett. This is the police comment and the police
[23:59.920 --> 24:04.680]  spokesman saying that it would be difficult emotionally for Smollett. The authorities
[24:04.680 --> 24:10.400]  wanted to make this as diplomatic as possible. This is a guy who was wanted for a felony
[24:10.400 --> 24:15.360]  offense, remember, who before this morning had not turned himself in, who by all accounts
[24:15.360 --> 24:22.280]  was not being very cooperative with the police, a guy who refused to hand over his phone initially.
[24:22.280 --> 24:26.360]  And then when they asked for the phone records, only handed them over after they were heavily
[24:26.360 --> 24:33.880]  redacted. And yet he does, to some extent, appear to be being treated with kid gloves.
[24:33.880 --> 24:38.640]  So there's some disagreement about that. Yes, they were obviously angry in the press conference,
[24:38.640 --> 24:44.760]  but when it came to the question of what justice would look like, they said justice would
[24:44.760 --> 24:50.400]  be an apology and a fine. Those are his words. That's what he said. Now, of course, the other
[24:50.400 --> 24:58.360]  aspect of this is the media, which unquestionably reported this as a homophobic racist hate crime
[24:58.360 --> 25:03.600]  straight away before any evidence whatsoever was in. When that narrative started to turn
[25:03.600 --> 25:07.960]  the other way, of course, all the celebrities, all the media personalities came out and said,
[25:07.960 --> 25:12.120]  oh, we're not going to comment until all the evidence is in. Well, all the evidence is
[25:12.120 --> 25:19.880]  now in and they're still running defense for Justice Smollett. Don Lemon, it's not Justice
[25:19.880 --> 25:24.360]  Smollett's fault that he lost in the Court of Public Opinion. This was on Don Lemon's
[25:24.360 --> 25:31.040]  CNN last night. We have the clip. Let's roll it right now. Here it is. In the Court of Public
[25:31.040 --> 25:37.240]  Opinion, Jussie has lost. He's lost the fight in the Court of Public Opinion. And that's
[25:37.240 --> 25:41.720]  where his battle is, whether legally, if he has to go, whatever he has to serve, if it's
[25:41.720 --> 25:44.880]  jail time, if he has to do probation, if he has to pay, whatever. But in the Court of
[25:44.880 --> 25:52.960]  Public Opinion, it matters. It matters. And he lost that because of how and not his fault.
[25:52.960 --> 25:58.440]  Maybe people were, I don't know what they were saying to him, maybe because of his representatives.
[25:58.440 --> 26:02.000]  Who knows? I don't know if it's not his fault. I don't know if it's not his fault, Don.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.920]  You think it's his fault. You think he was doing what he wanted. Well, he went out and
[26:04.920 --> 26:09.400]  he gave the interview. So understand this. Now, let's talk from a defense perspective.
[26:09.400 --> 26:13.920]  There's two things to think about. Number one is the law and whether it makes sense legally
[26:13.920 --> 26:18.680]  to be out there speaking and everything else. From that perspective, it's damning. All those
[26:18.680 --> 26:23.200]  things you heard him say on TV are going to be played in a courtroom.
[26:23.200 --> 26:27.680]  So there you have CNN's Don Lemon saying it's not Jussie Smollett's fault that he lost in
[26:27.680 --> 26:33.680]  the Court of Public Opinion. He got up on ABC Good Morning America, gave the nation a sob
[26:33.680 --> 26:39.880]  story, attacked people who dared question his version of events, exploited this for
[26:39.880 --> 26:46.920]  his own ends, seemingly exploited it politically. Of course, all the Democrats, all the leftist
[26:46.920 --> 26:52.560]  celebrities did when the story first came out. So of course it's his fault that he lost
[26:52.560 --> 26:57.000]  in the Court of Public Opinion. If these charges are true and the overwhelming amount of evidence
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.880]  suggests they are, he staged a hate crime attack against himself. If it was only to
[27:02.880 --> 27:08.400]  get a pay raise, that's bad enough. If it was to further this political narrative that
[27:08.400 --> 27:13.360]  this wave of bigotry and hatred is sweeping America and that Trump supporters fall, then
[27:13.360 --> 27:18.880]  of course it's his own fault. Who else could it be?
[27:18.880 --> 27:22.240]  Now we have people like Ellen Page, who of course came out on Colbert's show and he was
[27:22.240 --> 27:31.040]  like, yes, I agree fully, blaming Mike Pence for anti-LGBT rhetoric that caused the Jussie
[27:31.040 --> 27:38.040]  Smollett attack. Is Ellen Page going to come out and walk back and apologize and retract?
[27:38.040 --> 27:43.600]  Now people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez going to come out and apologize and retract.
[27:43.600 --> 27:48.920]  Her tweet is still up on Twitter. And as far as I know, Ellen Page has not reversed any
[27:48.920 --> 27:54.560]  of her statements either. She got up on late night with Colbert and said, basically, how
[27:54.560 --> 28:00.320]  dare anyone question this? This just shows the state of the country. How hatred against
[28:00.320 --> 28:05.400]  gay just runs through the veins of the country because people would even dare question this.
[28:05.400 --> 28:09.920]  They see the tweet from AOC. There's no such thing as racially charged. This attack was
[28:09.920 --> 28:15.880]  not possibly homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack. Again, that was based solely
[28:15.880 --> 28:22.320]  on the claims of Jussie Smollett, which started to collapse almost instantly.
[28:22.320 --> 28:27.800]  Then we have empire producers floating trial-blown about suspending Jussie Smollett. They haven't
[28:27.800 --> 28:32.160]  even taken any action. They're just considering it, okay?
[28:32.160 --> 28:39.200]  Roseanne got fired immediately. Her entire show was rewritten for an offensive tweet.
[28:39.200 --> 28:43.400]  Jussie Smollett allegedly, the overwhelming amount of evidence suggests, staged a hate
[28:43.400 --> 28:48.600]  crime against himself that could have had massive negative ramifications for the entire
[28:48.600 --> 28:55.080]  country and they haven't even suspended him. They haven't even taken any disciplinary action
[28:55.080 --> 28:58.920]  whatsoever. Absolutely incredible. We'll be back with more on the Alex Jones Show Live
[28:58.920 --> 29:03.280]  Infowars. Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried

[33:27.840 --> 33:33.680]  I'm still trying to get my head round how dumb one person can be in this justy smellette
[33:33.680 --> 33:35.560]  fake hate crime.
[33:35.560 --> 33:39.480]  He paid the Nigerian brothers by check.
[33:39.480 --> 33:41.560]  Why pay them by check?
[33:41.560 --> 33:46.240]  He forgot to tell them to trash the receipt for the items they purchased in the hardware
[33:46.240 --> 33:47.240]  store.
[33:47.240 --> 33:51.680]  You know, the ski masks, the gloves, the red hat that was supposedly meant to look like
[33:51.680 --> 33:53.280]  a MAGA hat.
[33:53.280 --> 33:58.280]  He called them before and after the attack, leaving a trail on the phone records.
[33:58.280 --> 34:01.840]  He left a giant paper trail throughout this whole thing.
[34:01.840 --> 34:04.760]  How dumb can you get?
[34:04.760 --> 34:09.480]  Mike Cernovich tweeted, justy smellette who left an extensive paper trail of his crimes
[34:09.480 --> 34:12.600]  is a character all lawyers know well.
[34:12.600 --> 34:17.080]  Criminals who think they're much smarter than they really are.
[34:17.080 --> 34:19.080]  Just absolutely incredible.
[34:19.080 --> 34:23.240]  And the only thing captured on surveillance camera was them buying the items.
[34:23.240 --> 34:28.840]  They failed to even capture this alleged staged attack on surveillance camera because they
[34:28.840 --> 34:32.720]  didn't realize it was pointing the wrong way.
[34:32.720 --> 34:34.400]  Absolutely incredible.
[34:34.400 --> 34:40.240]  Rob Elgus of ABC7 who is one of the local journalists who's blown this case wide open
[34:40.240 --> 34:45.280]  basically doing real journalism, which is why the likes of CNN hate him and why he's
[34:45.280 --> 34:47.080]  getting a lot of flack.
[34:47.080 --> 34:51.600]  He said new from 20th century Fox TV quote, we understand the seriousness of this matter.
[34:51.600 --> 34:53.040]  We respect the legal process.
[34:53.040 --> 34:54.920]  We are evaluating the situation.
[34:54.920 --> 35:00.480]  We are considering options because before Fox came out and said they're not going to
[35:00.480 --> 35:04.640]  take any action and that they stand behind justy smellette even when the way of evidence
[35:04.640 --> 35:06.360]  was clearly against him.
[35:06.360 --> 35:11.960]  So now even after the police press conference, they're still holding fire on making any kind
[35:11.960 --> 35:12.960]  of decision.
[35:12.960 --> 35:18.240]  And in the case of Roseanne, who I think was ABC, she was fired immediately.
[35:18.240 --> 35:22.160]  Her entire show was rewritten because of one offensive tweet.
[35:22.160 --> 35:24.640]  Nobody got hurt with an offensive tweet.
[35:24.640 --> 35:28.880]  This thing could have caused race riots across America.
[35:28.880 --> 35:33.760]  And now they're talking about a slap on the wrist and no action from Fox has yet been
[35:33.760 --> 35:39.840]  taken or from the show empire itself against justy smellette.
[35:39.840 --> 35:42.000]  Now who's going to apologize for this?
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.640]  Seth Mandel going to apologize.
[35:44.640 --> 35:50.000]  Seth Mandel came out with a tweet about this last night and it was so bad.
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.640]  The tweet was so bad.
[35:51.640 --> 35:55.440]  He got dragged by his own wife on Twitter.
[35:55.440 --> 36:01.520]  Listen to this, Seth Mandel, who's a journalist for the Washington Examiner.
[36:01.520 --> 36:04.960]  So I think this guy is actually conservative, but listen to this.
[36:04.960 --> 36:08.840]  He said, justy smellette royally messed up in what's beginning to look more like a cry
[36:08.840 --> 36:11.280]  for help than anything else.
[36:11.280 --> 36:16.280]  I don't see how sending him to prison accomplishes that, so I hope it doesn't reach that point.
[36:16.280 --> 36:19.120]  Ben Shapiro responded, disagree.
[36:19.120 --> 36:23.400]  If you waste police time and taxpayer dollars on your self-centered attempt to stoke radical
[36:23.400 --> 36:28.240]  political tension and undercut the suffering of real hate crime victims in the process,
[36:28.240 --> 36:31.480]  you should do jail time.
[36:31.480 --> 36:36.640]  Then his own wife responded, not knowing that he was completely owned in this tweet.
[36:36.640 --> 36:41.960]  It had a ratio which was off the charts, basically historical, meaning the amount of people that
[36:41.960 --> 36:48.040]  replied to the tweet dwarfed the retweets or the likes that the tweet itself received.
[36:48.040 --> 36:53.240]  His own wife, Bethany S. Mandel, responded, he was cool with multiple people going to
[36:53.240 --> 36:56.760]  prison for his mistakes, nope, which is true, isn't it?
[36:56.760 --> 37:02.080]  Because he was willing to testify against two innocent people before the police told
[37:02.080 --> 37:07.320]  him that those two people were actually the Nigerian brothers who he allegedly conspired
[37:07.320 --> 37:08.800]  with to stage the attack.
[37:08.800 --> 37:14.560]  So he was perfectly willing to send two people to jail for something they never did before
[37:14.560 --> 37:17.760]  he found out their identity.
[37:17.760 --> 37:19.080]  Absolutely incredible.
[37:19.080 --> 37:20.800]  We'll continue to monitor it.
[37:20.800 --> 37:25.120]  But before we go to more news, I want to draw your attention to the great specials we have

[38:49.440 --> 38:55.360]  Massive discount, 40% off when you buy two or more boxes.
[38:55.360 --> 38:59.320]  Now we're going to stay on top of whatever's breaking with the Justy Smollett case.
[38:59.320 --> 39:02.680]  But for now, let's switch into other news.
[39:02.680 --> 39:08.360]  China's social credit system shows its teeth banning millions from taking flights and trains.
[39:08.360 --> 39:13.160]  Now we've talked about this many times before, but now we've got numbers, actual hard figures
[39:13.160 --> 39:20.280]  out of the Chinese government from this blacklist, which ranks Chinese citizens based on their
[39:20.280 --> 39:27.240]  trustworthiness, and that trustworthiness score is based on things like misdemeanors, is based
[39:27.240 --> 39:35.120]  on things like jaywalking, social media posts that criticize the government, purchases,
[39:35.120 --> 39:39.720]  like if you purchase too much fatty food, if you purchase too many video games, that will
[39:39.720 --> 39:44.880]  downrank your social credit score, and you'll find it harder to get jobs.
[39:44.880 --> 39:47.840]  You'll find it harder to get insurance.
[39:47.840 --> 39:57.920]  And now it's come out that in 2018, 17.46 million discredited people in China were restricted
[39:57.920 --> 40:06.200]  from buying plane tickets, and 5.47 million Chinese citizens were restricted from purchasing
[40:06.200 --> 40:07.600]  train tickets.
[40:07.600 --> 40:10.280]  This is beyond all well.
[40:10.280 --> 40:15.400]  Imagine not just being de-platformed on social media, not just being suspended on Twitter,
[40:15.400 --> 40:17.820]  not just being banned by Facebook.
[40:17.820 --> 40:23.120]  Imagine your political statement being fed into some centralized computer database by
[40:23.120 --> 40:27.520]  some soy boys working in Silicon Valley, and then they're having the knock-on effect of
[40:27.520 --> 40:30.600]  you not being able to travel.
[40:30.600 --> 40:36.120]  This is the chilling big brother future that we all face in the West if we don't stand
[40:36.120 --> 40:40.320]  up to de-platforming, because that's where it's going to end up going.
[40:40.320 --> 40:47.800]  In fact, there are polls both in the US and the UK which show that around 70%, 70% of
[40:47.800 --> 40:54.680]  potential employers check and audit people's individual social media presence before they
[40:54.680 --> 40:58.880]  even get to the interview stage of a job.
[40:58.880 --> 41:04.520]  So if you've been de-platformed by social media, if you don't have a social media presence,
[41:04.520 --> 41:10.320]  if you've been unpersoned because of your hate speech, because of your thought crime,
[41:10.320 --> 41:15.200]  that is going to cost you a job in the long term, because it's going to raise red flags
[41:15.200 --> 41:20.040]  for these employers who see that you don't even have a social media presence on the internet,
[41:20.040 --> 41:21.800]  well, why not?
[41:21.800 --> 41:28.800]  This is where it's all going, and we've got the numbers out of China, where 17.46 million
[41:28.800 --> 41:34.160]  discredited people were restricted from buying plane tickets, 5.47 million restricted from
[41:34.160 --> 41:37.520]  purchasing high-speed train tickets.
[41:37.520 --> 41:44.320]  It goes on to talk about premium insurance, real estate, again, barring you from engaging
[41:44.320 --> 41:51.000]  in basic commerce, because you've been deemed to be untrustworthy by Big Brother.
[41:51.000 --> 41:52.600]  And this is already happening in the West.
[41:52.600 --> 41:59.400]  It's already happening now with Chase Bank de-platforming conservatives ostensibly because
[41:59.400 --> 42:01.440]  of their political opinions.
[42:01.440 --> 42:07.160]  Zero-Head reports, Chase Bank de-platforms conservative performance artist Martina Markota.
[42:07.160 --> 42:13.800]  And again, the response is usually, and from conservatives in many cases, Muffry Market,
[42:13.800 --> 42:15.480]  there'll be a free market solution.
[42:15.480 --> 42:17.040]  All right, what are you going to do?
[42:17.040 --> 42:20.400]  Just start your own Chase Bank.
[42:20.400 --> 42:25.600]  Big League Politics reports, PayPal bans Big League reporter after he exposed them funding
[42:25.600 --> 42:27.200]  illegal immigration.
[42:27.200 --> 42:32.360]  So a journalist criticized PayPal for funding illegal immigration.
[42:32.360 --> 42:36.440]  Weeks later, his PayPal account was banned.
[42:36.440 --> 42:38.320]  Just start your own PayPal.
[42:38.320 --> 42:40.720]  No, that's not the solution.
[42:40.720 --> 42:45.800]  We need actual regulation of this, because this de-platforming is crippling people's
[42:45.800 --> 42:49.680]  financial situation, is crippling people's lives.
[42:49.680 --> 42:54.400]  In some cases, it's destroying their very future and it's chilling.
[42:54.400 --> 42:56.840]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[42:56.840 --> 42:58.960]  Break your news at infowars.com.

[44:07.160 --> 44:12.080]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that
[44:12.080 --> 44:18.040]  is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online
[44:18.040 --> 44:20.760]  than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.

[44:25.680 --> 44:29.880]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.

[44:57.360 --> 44:58.360]  InfoWarsshore.com.
[44:58.360 --> 45:03.400]  I want to follow one more live voice memo here as we take off.
[45:03.400 --> 45:07.520]  As I get back to the ATX, it's that we have come so far together, ladies and gentlemen.
[45:07.520 --> 45:12.560]  We have exposed the globalist paradigm of sociopaths, psychopaths, not understanding
[45:12.560 --> 45:16.600]  emotion but trying to manipulate ours, and when we buy into it mindlessly because we
[45:16.600 --> 45:20.440]  have emotion, we have a soul, we have conscience, they can win, but when we sit back like they
[45:20.440 --> 45:26.600]  do, coldly looking at what they're actually doing and who stands to benefit, we still
[45:26.600 --> 45:29.600]  have our emotion, we still have our soul, but we're able to shift into the psychopath
[45:29.600 --> 45:34.560]  mode, sociopath mode, and ask, as the Romans would, who benefits?
[45:34.560 --> 45:40.160]  And now with Smollett and the Covington kids and all these other hoaxes, you know, coming
[45:40.160 --> 45:45.240]  out, the Lazy Ford, the Liscos on and on, the Air Force Academy on and on, their whole
[45:45.240 --> 45:46.240]  paradigm is blown.
[45:46.240 --> 45:47.240]  And that's what's so exciting.
[45:47.240 --> 45:51.240]  So I salute you, I thank you, and just keep spreading the word, we're going to win, we're
[45:51.240 --> 45:54.960]  under attack because we're over the target, we're over the target, we know how to defeat
[45:54.960 --> 45:59.560]  the globalist and you, the audience, are part of the M4, so spread the live links, M4s.com,
[45:59.560 --> 46:00.560]  Ford Slash Show.
[46:00.560 --> 46:04.920]  This bar, at its regular price, is a little over $3.
[46:04.920 --> 46:11.400]  When we have it discounted, it's at about $2.50 a piece, comparable bars over between
[46:11.400 --> 46:14.360]  $5 and $7 a piece, at Whole Foods.
[46:14.360 --> 46:19.640]  This is high end, when you get one box, you get them at basically $3, you get them for
[46:19.640 --> 46:23.720]  $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[46:23.720 --> 46:28.440]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all
[46:28.440 --> 46:32.320]  ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.

[47:38.960 --> 47:46.000]  fight in the hills, we shall never surrender.
[47:46.000 --> 47:54.400]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[47:54.400 --> 47:58.520]  We're going to go right back live to Paul Joseph Watson in this Thursday edition, I
[47:58.520 --> 48:02.160]  want to point out the big key as we come in here, the big victory.
[48:02.160 --> 48:06.280]  We've known from history, we've known from evidence, we've known from research, the
[48:06.280 --> 48:11.400]  governments and corrupt groups, from private individuals to mafias, stage events against
[48:11.400 --> 48:17.560]  their enemies, it's called frame up, inside job, stage event, and they use these events
[48:17.560 --> 48:22.280]  to manipulate those of us that have conscience, those of us that care, those of us that are
[48:22.280 --> 48:27.800]  involved to try to control us, and the good news here is it's a lot safer for everybody
[48:27.800 --> 48:32.280]  now to talk about stage events, it's a lot safer for folks to point out who benefits,
[48:32.280 --> 48:36.960]  we're almost every major hate crime has been staged, so the reason I'm being attacked,
[48:36.960 --> 48:44.680]  the reason I'm being sued is because they don't want us to be able to question the
[48:44.680 --> 48:50.960]  crime he is questioning, the crime he is asking questions, the crime he's not believing what
[48:50.960 --> 48:54.720]  your first hand had told the crime, it's not going along with the official story, and
[48:54.720 --> 48:59.280]  M4 is all about questioning the official story, we're right about 95% of the time, sometimes
[48:59.280 --> 49:04.080]  we're wrong, and when we're wrong we're proud of it because we openly announce it, we're
[49:04.080 --> 49:10.320]  just looking for the truth here, we are here to absolutely target tyrants and tell the
[49:10.320 --> 49:14.280]  truth, so we'll go back live to Paul Watson as I take off here, that's what you understand,
[49:14.280 --> 49:19.240]  this is a big victory, it's small, it's been exposed, and then Balasi Ford's been exposed,
[49:19.240 --> 49:23.920]  and the Covenant Kid host has been exposed, and that all of it's being exposed right
[49:23.920 --> 49:27.960]  now, this is a big, big win for everybody, so now everybody can get on the message boards
[49:27.960 --> 49:32.520]  and talk radio and c-span and church, and everybody can now understand how things are
[49:32.520 --> 49:37.680]  staged by the globalists, and now that's their key modus operandi is inside job, back to
[49:37.680 --> 49:43.840]  Paul Joseph Watson, M4Words.com, NewsWords.com, tomorrow's next day.
[49:43.840 --> 49:49.480]  We are back, that was Alex Jones, and in fact, we're going to play the entirety of the Chicago
[49:49.480 --> 49:54.280]  Police Department press conference in the next hour, so be sure to stay tuned for that,
[49:54.280 --> 49:58.080]  it was a very interesting press conference to say the least.
[49:58.080 --> 50:02.280]  Earlier on Twitter, I asked, do you really believe that a pay raise was Justice Millet's
[50:02.280 --> 50:07.000]  only motive in staging this apparently fake hate crime?
[50:07.000 --> 50:15.440]  He was already on $65,000 an episode for the hit show Empire, Mike Cernovich has responded,
[50:15.440 --> 50:20.600]  he says it's a hybrid motivation, Justice Millet used Trump derangement syndrome as
[50:20.600 --> 50:27.280]  the hook, nothing sells like hate for Trump, he was on his way to a seven figure book deal
[50:27.280 --> 50:32.560]  and more, so of course, forget about Empire, if this had been carried through without being
[50:32.560 --> 50:39.520]  detected, Justice Millet would have been a social justice icon, he would have set himself
[50:39.520 --> 50:41.720]  up for life.
[50:41.720 --> 50:46.480]  So it does appear that financial reasons were a big part of the motive, but also the hook
[50:46.480 --> 50:51.880]  was this Trump derangement syndrome, which doesn't appear to be working by the way.
[50:51.880 --> 50:57.720]  The Drudge reports just posted a new story from Mediaite, says even after Sanders, Harris
[50:57.720 --> 51:02.880]  and others enter race, and of course, Creepy Joe Biden is about to enter the race, according
[51:02.880 --> 51:10.200]  to sources very close to his campaign, Bucky sub Donald Trump as a massive 2020 favorite,
[51:10.200 --> 51:14.800]  it says although there are now 12 already declared candidates opposing Trump in 2020,
[51:14.800 --> 51:19.520]  the nation's gambling gurus are still heavily favoring him for the win in the next election.
[51:19.520 --> 51:23.240]  The Washington Examiner reported Wednesday the entry of Bernie Sanders as number 12 in
[51:23.240 --> 51:25.920]  the race didn't even budge the numbers.
[51:25.920 --> 51:31.440]  So Trump is the overwhelming three to two favorite for reelection, this is columnist
[51:31.440 --> 51:37.040]  Paul Bedard, who spoke with a sports book manager at batonline.ag, Dave Mason, who
[51:37.040 --> 51:41.240]  said, quote, there were no changes to Sanders odds following the announcement.
[51:41.240 --> 51:45.160]  We had it as a foregone conclusion that he will be in the Democratic mix.
[51:45.160 --> 51:47.960]  Sanders odds were as high as 28 to one.
[51:47.960 --> 51:51.320]  So he's still looking like he's a long way off.
[51:51.320 --> 51:57.600]  Marla Harris is eight one at the moment, while Dwayne The Rock Johnson is at 80 to one.
[51:57.600 --> 52:00.680]  And where is Michelle Obama?
[52:00.680 --> 52:05.840]  You know, she had the wildly successful book, she had her Grammy appearance, she's got approval
[52:05.840 --> 52:07.240]  ratings through the roof.
[52:07.240 --> 52:10.040]  Oh, look, there she is with Justie Smollett.
[52:10.040 --> 52:16.160]  Well, I wonder why Michelle Obama's not running a lot of speculation as to why she's not running.
[52:16.160 --> 52:18.560]  And I'm sure that will continue to rumble.
[52:18.560 --> 52:23.640]  But Trump is still heavily favored for 2020, because basically the Democrats have nobody
[52:23.640 --> 52:25.600]  who can really challenge him at this point.
[52:25.600 --> 52:30.800]  You don't really have any policy platform, apart from orange man bad.
[52:30.800 --> 52:35.160]  I'm going to get into some news out of Europe here in a second, but I want to direct you
[52:35.160 --> 52:42.240]  once more to info wars store.com, where we have another massive discount special.

[53:58.640 --> 54:07.720]  So we have the social credit system in China, snaring 17.46 million people who are discredited
[54:07.720 --> 54:12.240]  and untrustworthy, maybe because they crossed the road at the wrong time, or maybe because
[54:12.240 --> 54:17.400]  they criticized the government, or maybe because they didn't pay a tax bill on time or something
[54:17.400 --> 54:18.640]  of that nature.
[54:18.640 --> 54:21.640]  So now they're banned from buying plane tickets.
[54:21.640 --> 54:24.640]  And it's all coming to America already is in some aspects.
[54:24.640 --> 54:30.800]  You've got Chase Bank, the platforming a conservative performance artist, Martina Markota, who was
[54:30.800 --> 54:36.760]  informed that her Chase Bank business account was shut down after she used it to fund a
[54:36.760 --> 54:39.880]  project based around, I think it was a comic book of some sort.
[54:39.880 --> 54:43.000]  Of course, Joe Biggs had problems with Chase Bank.
[54:43.000 --> 54:44.400]  That seems to be resolved.
[54:44.400 --> 54:50.080]  I think the last update, of course, PayPal banned Alex Jones banned info wars.
[54:50.080 --> 54:51.800]  They banned Robert Spencer.
[54:51.800 --> 54:55.400]  We had Mastercard doing the same thing.
[54:55.400 --> 55:01.440]  PayPal has banned a big League politics reporter because he criticized PayPal.
[55:01.440 --> 55:08.480]  So again, we have liberals cheering the concentration of power into a few select Silicon Valley corporations
[55:08.480 --> 55:12.840]  who are now basically sabotaging people's financial future.
[55:12.840 --> 55:17.040]  And it's only going to get worse if we don't scream from the rooftops about it.
[55:17.040 --> 55:21.480]  Now Donald Trump juniors followers say Instagram blocked them from liking his post.
[55:21.480 --> 55:23.160]  That's up at Breitbart.
[55:23.160 --> 55:26.280]  Instagram users are allegedly being prevented from liking or following President Trump and
[55:26.280 --> 55:27.840]  his son Donald Trump Jr.
[55:27.840 --> 55:33.000]  According to multiple reports received by Trump Jr., who exclusively shared those reports
[55:33.000 --> 55:34.240]  with Breitbart News.
[55:34.240 --> 55:38.560]  And you can see the screenshots where people are being prevented from liking his Instagram
[55:38.560 --> 55:45.200]  posts in many cases, unfollowing him without their say so.
[55:45.200 --> 55:50.680]  So Big Tech continues its war against conservatives against the alternative media.
[55:50.680 --> 55:57.440]  Meanwhile over in Europe, we had this video up on infowars.com yesterday, Austria feminist
[55:57.440 --> 56:02.360]  politician says Muslim migrants lack of respect for women's rights, a price worth paying
[56:02.360 --> 56:04.120]  for diversity.
[56:04.120 --> 56:09.920]  She basically got up on a television show and said, quote, if he in regard to a refugee
[56:09.920 --> 56:15.080]  or a migrant won't recognize our values in terms of not recognizing the equality of women,
[56:15.080 --> 56:17.880]  I think we can get over that.
[56:17.880 --> 56:23.880]  This is a top female feminist politician, former president of the Austrian Supreme Court, saying
[56:23.880 --> 56:28.040]  we can get over the fact that migrants who are coming from Islamic countries that have
[56:28.040 --> 56:32.600]  no respect for women that treat them like cattle in some cases, we can just get over
[56:32.600 --> 56:33.600]  that.
[56:33.600 --> 56:39.760]  We can get over the hundreds or in fact there's probably thousands of women, groped, molested
[56:39.760 --> 56:45.720]  in some cases, raped during the New Year's Eve assault in Cologne, Germany, the rapidly
[56:45.720 --> 56:50.760]  rising sex assaults in Sweden in other European countries, since they opened the borders to
[56:50.760 --> 56:52.280]  mass immigration.
[56:52.280 --> 56:57.720]  This leftist politician says, yeah, we can get over that because it's worth it, isn't
[56:57.720 --> 56:58.720]  it?
[56:58.720 --> 57:03.800]  It's worth it for the soaring violent crime rate that has happened in Germany, the vast
[57:03.800 --> 57:09.440]  majority of which is attributable to migrants, it's surely worth the price, right?
[57:09.440 --> 57:15.400]  Meanwhile, Sweden, this is up on infowars Europe, horse set on fire, migrant gang douses
[57:15.400 --> 57:20.680]  women in Leiterfluid, oh, I guess we should just get over that as well, a horse was set
[57:20.680 --> 57:25.600]  on fire and an elderly woman was doused in Leiterfluid near a flaming grill by an immigrant
[57:25.600 --> 57:29.520]  gang in separate incidents in Sweden.
[57:29.520 --> 57:35.040]  So you know, surely it's worth it, surely it's worth it for multiculturalism and diversity.
[57:35.040 --> 57:37.920]  Who cares if a few old women get doused and set on fire?
[57:37.920 --> 57:42.600]  You know, who cares if hundreds or thousands of women get mass molested in Cologne?
[57:42.600 --> 57:43.600]  It's worth it.
[57:43.600 --> 57:48.240]  That's the price of diversity, we'll be back infowars.com, don't go away.
[58:13.600 --> 58:24.360]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout

[58:50.320 --> 58:54.600]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[58:54.600 --> 58:58.600]  Infowars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[58:58.600 --> 59:01.600]  every faucet, shower and sink in your home.

[59:53.600 --> 01:00:05.160]  Start listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:10.400]  I want to follow one more live voice memo here as we take off as I get back to the ATX.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.400]  It's that we have come so far to go the other ways until when we've exposed the globalist
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:18.520]  paradigm of sociopaths and psychopaths not understanding emotion but trying to manipulate
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.520]  ours.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.560]  And when we buy into it mindlessly, because we have emotion, we have a soul, we have conscience,
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:28.160]  they can win but when we sit back like they do, coldly looking at what they're actually
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:33.080]  doing and who stands to benefit, we still have our emotion, we still have our soul that
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.080]  we're able to shift into the psychopath mode, sociopath mode, and ask is the Romanswood
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.080]  who benefits.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:45.040]  And now with Smollett and the Covington kids and all these other hoaxes, you're coming
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.120]  out Balazi forward, the list goes on and on, the Air Force Academy on and on, their whole
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.120]  paradigm is blown.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.120]  That's what's so exciting.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.160]  So I salute you, I thank you, and just keep spreading the word we're going to win, we're
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.880]  under attack because we're over the target, we're over the target, we know how to defeat
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.480]  the globalist and you the audience are part of the info war, so spread the live links
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.480]  infowars.com.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:15.320]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer now in studio for Alex Jones in Austin, Texas
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.560]  at the info wars world headquarters.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:24.920]  Now look, I'm still trying to analyze all the angles here, but you have to understand
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:33.880]  that info wars role in news coverage is very unique and we don't just look at stories as
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.360]  isolated incidents around here.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:45.240]  And so when I see the Jesse Smollett hoax totally fall apart.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.760]  When I see them blaming it on him complaining he didn't make enough money.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:54.360]  I don't buy that and you have all the images of him with all of these Democrats at all
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.360]  these different rallies.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.560]  I mean, the guy was a Democrat operative.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:02.000]  That's not a conspiracy theory, Jesse Smollett is a Democrat operative.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.200]  Now whether the Democrats were pulling the strings on this hoax crime is another story
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.560]  that is yet to be investigated and it will be investigated.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:17.000]  And in fact, it is being investigated fact the FBI in Chicago may even have to get involved
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.800]  in this folks, but we'll see about all that.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:28.440]  Now in the meantime, as we're looking into all of that was Kamala Harris involved was
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:34.360]  Adam Schiff involved heck was Barack Obama involved.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:40.400]  We've caught Bob Kramer and Aaron Black and other Democrats red handed staging events
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.000]  and planning riots.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.120]  So we know that goes on Smollett got caught red handed.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:55.520]  But in the aftermath, knowing how these things work, knowing how the news cycle works, knowing
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:07.120]  how the mainstream media works, I look at two stories that are coming out today that
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.160]  we really have to sit here and wonder.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:17.600]  Now the first is out of San Francisco, exclusive surveillance camera catches presumed MAGA supporter
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.560]  vandalizing San Francisco home.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:27.640]  Now this individual has an impeached Trump sign on his porch and allegedly has eggs thrown
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.840]  at his house and but he won't talk to police.
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:35.480]  He'll only talk to media and he blurs his face and the video they show of the quote
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:39.560]  unquote suspect is hardly suspect at all.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:43.520]  Then you look at the notes that were left for him and it's not the type of writing you
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.520]  would expect.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.920]  I'll just put it that way.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:51.960]  So now we're looking at this wondering if this is a hoax and boy, oh boy, if you have
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.640]  a hoax meter folks, it's redlining on this one.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:00.880]  But we'll find out perhaps then you have the big one.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:10.480]  The U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant who they're now saying is a white nationalist conservative
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:21.480]  rivalist with a large weapons cache was trying to kill almost every last person on earth
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:28.480]  according to the story on MSN and other news outlets.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:36.760]  Now again, we talked about this yesterday but we knew that they would be staging attacks
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:44.520]  to blame Trump, blame conservatives, blame Republicans, blame military members, people
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:47.280]  that have survival gear, I mean all of this stuff.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.360]  And so we're now in these throes right now.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:55.280]  And so everything has to be looked at under the microscope folks but the mainstream media

[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:41.560]  You know, I'm really not sure how to properly depict and analyze what's happening right
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:45.640]  now in America.
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:48.040]  But I guess it's not really up to me, is it?
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:53.080]  It's up to the American people to see what's going on here.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:07:01.040]  Now we are about to air the entire press conference today from the Chicago Police, which the Chicago
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:05.680]  Police Department detectives just Yamens work up there.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.800]  I mean, just what a great job they did.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:12.480]  And you're going to hear the whole story and the timeline and everything coming up here
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.960]  in just a minute.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:29.520]  You know, if America can't see the enemy's domestic that are a clear and present danger
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:37.560]  really to our civilization, then I'm not really sure what they can see at all if they can
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.160]  see anything.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.440]  So we're going to air this entire press conference with folks.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:46.040]  Please support us at infowars.com because we need your support.
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.160]  We are under mass censorship.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:56.520]  And you know, it's funny because I see all these different news outlets and they get
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.040]  all these breaking news reports.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.840]  They get all these viral videos.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:05.360]  And so many of the times I'm thinking, wow, we broke that a year ago or wow, we broke
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.800]  that exact same thing a month ago.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.880]  But see, we don't get the viral video.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.680]  We don't get the cross promotion.
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.680]  No, we're a Voldemort of news.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:18.560]  We're not allowed to be named Alex Jones and allowed to be named, but that's fine.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:26.640]  We carry on and it's your support at infowars.com that fuels the spaceship here, the Death Star
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.280]  to the globalist info wars.

[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.480]  Alex's word that your support will launch info wars to the next level.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:32.320]  Now we're going to air the entire press conference now.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:38.960]  We're also going to be getting an exclusive message from Roger Stone as he is meeting,
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.040]  I believe with judges and lawyers today, he has a final statement.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.640]  He's worried that they may gag him or even put him in jail.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.760]  So we'll probably get a final exclusive statement from Roger hoping that's not the case.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:56.240]  By the way, Terrence Williams, a popular conservative comic, was in a very serious car accident
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.240]  last night.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.240]  Our thoughts and prayers are with him.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:59.240]  He's doing well.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:04.840]  He has a fractured neck, but he is speaking and in a recent comment, he said, free Roger
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.840]  Stone.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:11.400]  Now, without further ado, let's go to the Chicago Police Department press conference
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:15.960]  today addressing the Jesse Smallette hate crime hoax.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:19.160]  Good morning, everyone.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:25.160]  Before I get started on why we're here, you know, as I look out into the crowd, I just
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:31.320]  wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention because
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:36.320]  that's who really deserves the amount of attention that we're giving to this particular incident.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:44.000]  But this morning, I come to you not only as the superintendent of Chicago Police Department,
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:50.040]  but also as a black man who spent his entire life living in the city of Chicago.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.600]  I know the racial divide that exists here.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:58.840]  I know how hard it's been for our city and our nation to come together, and I also know
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:02.800]  the disparities and I know the history.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:09.520]  This announcement today recognizes that Empire actor Jesse Smollett took advantage of the
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:15.000]  pain and anger of racism to promote his career.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.120]  I'm left hanging my head and asking why.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:25.840]  Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.120]  false accusations?
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:36.360]  How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:42.000]  to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.440]  How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:53.960]  everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:58.480]  Bogus police reports cause real harm.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:05.120]  They do harm to every legitimate victim who's in need of support by police and investigators
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:08.120]  as well as the citizens of this city.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:15.400]  Chicago hosts one of the largest pride parades in the world, and we're proud of that as a
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:20.440]  police department and also as a city.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:26.400]  We do not know whether we ever tolerate hate in our city, whether that hate is based on
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:31.120]  an individual's sexual orientation, race, or anything else.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:37.240]  So I'm offended by what's happened, and I'm also angry.
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:42.840]  I love the city of Chicago and the Chicago police department, warts and all, but this
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:49.080]  publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:55.760]  To make things worse, the accusations within this phony attack received national attention
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:57.400]  for weeks.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:03.000]  Celebrities, news commentators, and even presidential candidates weighed in on something
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.800]  that was choreographed by an actor.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:12.600]  First, Smollett attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:16.720]  racial, homophobic, and political language.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:25.800]  When that didn't work, Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.240]  through the mud in the process.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.920]  And why?
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:35.840]  The stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary, but
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:39.240]  he concocted a story about being attacked.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:45.840]  Now, our city has problems, we know that.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:51.760]  We have problems that have affected people from all walks of life, and we know that.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:57.400]  But to put the national spotlight on Chicago for something that is both egregious and untrue
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.240]  is simply shameful.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:05.480]  I'm also concerned about what this means moving forward for hate crimes.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:11.080]  Now, of course, the Chicago Police Department will continue to investigate all reports of
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:16.280]  these types of incidents with the same amount of vigor that we did with this one.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:21.640]  My concern is that hate crimes will now publicly be met with a level of skepticism that previously
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.920]  didn't happen.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:30.640]  That said, Smollett was treated as a victim throughout this investigation until we received
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.920]  evidence that led detectives in another direction.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:40.480]  I couldn't be more proud of the unrelenting detective work that went into this investigation.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.920]  I couldn't be more proud of every investigator that played a part in it.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.840]  The detective work that we saw in this case is indicative of the work that our detectives
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:52.960]  do every day in this city.
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:59.000]  This case in particular involved hours of video evidence which went combined with old-fashioned
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.080]  police work uncovered the truth.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:07.240]  These detectives deserve all the credit in the world for carefully analyzing the leads
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.320]  and the evidence for weeks before coming to their conclusion.
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:15.920]  I'd also like to thank the FBI for their help in this investigation.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.040]  The FBI's partnership with CPD has been pivotal in this particular case.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:26.640]  I only hope that the truth about what happened receives the same amount of attention that
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.640]  the hoax did.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:34.440]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Jesse Smollett hate crime hoax press conference
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.160]  with the Chicago Police Department.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.400]  Again, just great work by the Chicago Police Department, the FBI involved in that too.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:44.600]  Folks, we have to think about all the angles here.
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:51.240]  Just remember, a few months before this happened, Kamala Harris passed legislation to ban lynching.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:57.280]  Boy, a hate crime with a noose involved might have been the perfect way to get that through.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:02.640]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.640]  the world.
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.680]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:12.640]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:16.440]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.440]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.000]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.560]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunne, available
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:52.040]  at Amazon Books.

[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:13.020]  by leaps and by bounds the number one best-selling supplement family in the

[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:54.280]  first time the left has staged a hate crime and it won't be the last fact
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:21:01.280]  there may be some ongoing staged hate crimes percolating right now and as
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:07.960]  pointed out by a very popular account on Twitter educating liberals the Jesse
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:13.600]  small that case is what happens when the demand for racism is greater than the
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:19.840]  supply exactly and when you're taught your whole life that you're the victim
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:24.800]  and you're not actually the victim then you have to play the victim and if you
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:30.720]  play the victim you will become the victim but how deep does the Jesse
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:38.280]  small let hate crime hoax go and is there pun not intended a tie into the
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:43.320]  Kamala Harris legislation to make lynching illegal and the fact that
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:47.400]  small that happened to have a noose around his neck and I don't know maybe
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:51.040]  there's some Democrats right now that are afraid of being hung for treason and
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.520]  maybe that's why they wanted to ban lynching but that's not they're here
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:59.640]  nor there let's go back to the Chicago Police Department with their press
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:05.960]  conference addressing the Jesse small let hate crime hoax I'd also like to
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:10.720]  thank the FBI for their help in this investigation the FBI's partnership with
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:16.440]  CPD has been pivotal in this particular case I only hope that the truth about
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:22.240]  what happened receives the same amount of attention that the hoax did I'll
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:27.240]  continue to pray for this troubled young man who resorted to both drastic and
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:33.120]  illegal tactics to gain attention I'll also continue to pray for our city
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:39.360]  asking that we can move forward from this and begin to heal now I'd like to
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:43.520]  call up commander Edward Widenickey who personally led this patient and
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:47.320]  deliberate investigation to walk everyone through how the Chicago Police
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:50.920]  Department arrived at this point
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:56.440]  good morning everyone my name is Edward Widenickey I'm the commander of the
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:23:07.000]  area's central detective division I'm here to answer questions okay the boss
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.680]  just corrected me get please forgive me I I'm supposed to go through the
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:24.840]  timeline of our investigation so here's where we are as you all know on the
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:30.480]  early morning of February 29th at 2 o'clock in the morning Jesse Smollett
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:36.000]  reported that he was the victim of a hate crime detectives responded to the
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.800]  incident and and interviewed him eventually at Northwestern Hospital where
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:53.000]  he reported to us that that the the two two offenders yelled racial and
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:59.200]  homophobic and political statements at him and beat him put a noose around his
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:04.200]  neck and threw bleach on him and then fled from the area we learned at the
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:10.760]  time that that Jesse was not hurt other than scratches on his face maybe some
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:16.160]  bruising but no broken ribs or serious injuries so we started a full-scale
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:23.120]  investigation into this hate crime a very serious crime in anywhere we we
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:31.960]  quickly found two persons of interest on video that that we believed were the
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:37.800]  likely offenders in this case we initially put out a seeking to identify
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:43.880]  and we got this out in a community alert we then started searching the area for
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:50.960]  video cameras and witnesses that could help us with our investigation during
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:58.680]  that time frame we we interviewed over a hundred individuals in a canvas of the
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:05.880]  area and a follow-up canvas as our investigation expanded we located
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:14.160]  approximately 35 of our Chicago police pod cameras in the area and then the
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:20.680]  areas that we determined these two these two persons of interest fled we
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:26.520]  additionally found over 20 private sector cameras and I got to say that that was
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:31.800]  that was super useful in this investigation the city came together to
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:37.200]  investigate and help the police with this crime it was because of these pod
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:42.480]  cameras our investment in in into technology in the city of Chicago and
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:48.400]  the the great assistance from the community in giving us those other
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.880]  cameras that led us to a really solid timeline of where our two persons of
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:26:03.120]  interest went so in short we were able to track them initially initially
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:10.880]  forward so after the crime we were able to see that they fled in a particular
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:17.520]  direction and eventually got into a cab our investigators located that that cab
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:22.760]  interviewed the cab driver got some video out of that cab followed that cab
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:27.600]  using all of these surveillance cameras that are located throughout the city the
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:33.680]  pod cameras to an area up on the north side where they abruptly stopped the cab
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:39.920]  got out and walked on foot again the community came together to provide us
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:48.280]  with security foot footage from their private cameras so at that point we then
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:53.560]  started tracking these two persons of interest backwards backwards to where
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:27:01.400]  they came from so we we followed them walking around and eventually back to
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:06.400]  where they had gotten out of a cab so that was another individual that we had
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:13.000]  to interview and another individual where we sought video we continued to
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:20.520]  track that cab back to the point where the cab was tracked down by our two
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:27.800]  persons of interest in a ride share car we then followed up on the ride share
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:33.520]  and and that was the lead that we needed in order to identify the two
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:39.800]  persons of interest at that point we had a real good timeline of where these two
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:47.000]  people went we were able to put a name to both of these individuals and it was
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:54.440]  at that time that we started started looking at where they went right right
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:28:01.360]  right after this event we tracked them to going to O'Hare Airport and jumping on a
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:11.200]  flight to Nigeria our our investigation led us to determine that they had
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:17.400]  purchased a round-trip ticket with them returning to Chicago on the 13th so
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:22.640]  approximately two weeks after the incident so that gave us a couple of
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:29.240]  weeks to try to continue to to follow up on any investigative lead any our
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:32.960]  ladies and gentlemen this is the press conference held by the Chicago Police

[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:17.960]  have emotion we have a soul we have conscience they can win but when we sit
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:22.760]  back like they do coldly looking at what they're actually doing and who stands

[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:31.400]  into the psychopath mode sociopath mode and ask is the Romans would who

[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:06.240]  Alex Jones show
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:22.240]  Jesse Smollett's got caught staging a false flag to blame President Trump and
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:29.440]  his supporters and white people because Jesse Smollett is a racist motivated by
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:36.880]  top racists like Obama and Kamala Harris now Jesse Smollett is awaited in
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:42.480]  court is he gonna tell the judge that the reason he staged this was because
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:47.240]  he was unhappy with his salary which is being reported at $65,000 an episode
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:52.920]  better not let lie to that judge Jesse better not lie to that judge we go back
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:58.600]  now to the Chicago Police Department press conference they had purchased a
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:05.080]  round-trip ticket with them returning to Chicago on the 13th so approximately two
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:11.480]  weeks after the incident so that gave us a couple of weeks to try to continue to
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:17.760]  to follow up on any investigative lead any any investigative lead that would
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:24.320]  help us try to determine what happened in this incident so while we were waiting
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:34.920]  for them to return we executed we executed over 50 search warrants and
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:39.600]  subpoenas working with our partners in the state's attorney's office phone
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:49.760]  records social media records and records on individuals to help us illuminate the
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:35:00.480]  the likely facts that occurred in this event so moving forward to the 13th we
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:07.800]  had a team in place working with the FBI customs and and our partners out at
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:14.280]  the airport airport police helped us tremendously and we we were able to
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:18.640]  locate and identify these two individuals these two persons of interest when
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:23.960]  they entered back into the country into the country at customs we took them
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:29.640]  into custody we read them their rights and they both initially asked for an
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:35.280]  attorney they were brought to area central detective headquarters so that
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:41.320]  we could we could process them and it was at that time that their attorney
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:46.400]  showed up I think you've all seen her on the news the last couple of days she
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:54.000]  came to us and and after speaking with these two people of interest she said
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.640]  that something smelled fishy she did not think that they were the offenders as
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:05.840]  were reported she worked with us very very closely to get to the point where
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:10.720]  she came to me and said you really need to talk to these guys I I'm going to
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:16.720]  allow them to give you a video interview with us present and we're gonna have you
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:23.200]  hear their story they are not offenders they're victims was at that time that
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:29.440]  this investigation started to spin in in a completely new direction you've
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:34.840]  heard some of the statements that that their lawyer nishmit has made and and
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:40.560]  it was at that time that we took the information that these two individuals
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:49.320]  provided to us and we substantiated the timeline and the details that they gave
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:55.120]  to us in this interview we were able to substantiate those things we worked very
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:59.360]  very closely with the state's attorney's office we had been working very very
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.800]  closely with the state's attorney's office for over a week at that point and
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:14.040]  it was it was then on the 15th Friday the 15th after after approximately 47
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:21.000]  hours of them being in custody and hours of them meeting with us and telling us
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  their story and documenting their story did we release them without charging and
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:33.440]  I classified them no longer as suspects or persons of interest and as witnesses so
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:40.600]  as is typical with any investigation one would typically lock these witnesses
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:46.840]  into a grand jury statement Monday was a holiday the 18th Tuesday was the first
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:54.320]  day that we could we could attempt to do that so we scheduled we scheduled a a
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:58.680]  appointment with the grand jury working again very closely with the state's
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:03.800]  attorney's office in this and as you know at the last minute Jesse's lawyers
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:09.160]  called and said that they had evidence to postpone the grand jury that they
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:16.240]  wanted to provide to us it was at that time that they called us and I met with
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:22.080]  them with a team of our detectives and essentially they gave us no new
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:27.800]  information so I reported that back to the state's attorney's office and it was
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:36.760]  at that time that we we locked in both of these witnesses to the grand jury they
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:41.880]  I'm told they did it did an excellent job and then the state's attorney's office
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:48.800]  approved charges against Jesse for the class for disorderly conduct false
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:56.400]  police report we met with the with Jesse's attorneys and we arranged for
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:02.480]  him to turn himself in and as you all know he turned himself in at five o'clock
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:09.520]  this morning in the first district in Chicago today at 1 30 Jesse will be
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:14.000]  going in front of a bond court judge and the bond court hearing will be
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:30.760]  conducted at 26 in California well it was uneventful he showed up of course
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:36.080]  with his attorneys and a few other individuals but it went smoothly
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:45.000]  because that's typically what we do once we once we believe that witnesses
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.560]  are valuable witnesses incredible then we take them to the grand jury to lock
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:40:10.120]  their testimonies and yes well a number of individuals you know we serve
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:16.760]  subpoenas and warrants of course on mr. Smollett his manager for phone records
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:21.160]  the two people of interest that we had and so we still have quite a few search
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:27.560]  ones and subpoenas out there that we're waiting to come back
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:44.040]  we didn't pull resources from any shootings or homicide investigations
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:48.280]  the detectives that you see behind me basically work on different teams which
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:52.000]  include property crimes and things of that nature we don't have the exact
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.840]  numbers yet but let me let me just tell you all this anytime a hate crime is
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:01.040]  reported in the city of Chicago it gets the same attention this didn't get any
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:05.800]  special attention you all gave us more attention specifically than we do we give
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:10.600]  every hate crime in this city the same amount of vigor because there's no place
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:14.560]  for hatred in this city and as I said in the very beginning you know I've lived
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:19.400]  in the city of Chicago my entire life we just don't have any room for hatred in
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:25.440]  this city and and for somebody to use it for a personal gain it's just it's
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:29.640]  shameful because what that does is take away the resources that we could be
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:34.040]  putting into other crimes
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:50.480]  that's the FBI's investigation so CPD doesn't comment on the FBI's
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:42:14.680]  investigation
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:20.320]  yeah we have evidence that we have the check that he used to pay them so the 3500
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:27.160]  was for the two of them in total and then 500 on upon return
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:36.680]  no it took place right there all right ladies and gentlemen we're gonna
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:41.800]  conclude this press conference on the other side and then once that's
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:46.280]  concluded we're gonna break down the history of the left staging hate crimes
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.680]  it goes all the way back to the 80s with Al Sharpton ladies and gentlemen and
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:55.000]  then compare the treatment that Roger Stone received to just a small let me
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:11.280]  write that by leaps and by bounds the number one best-selling supplement
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:16.760]  family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements but they are riddled
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:21.440]  with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.160]  get you a quick boost but burnout in just a few hours and have terrible side
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:29.480]  effects we have developed hands down from our research the most powerful
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:35.240]  healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world there's
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:39.920]  nothing else like it must experience it it is a total game changer and it comes
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:43.680]  in easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water whatever you'd
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:48.120]  like warning though it's very very strong it lasts 10 hours so take a half
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:51.920]  pack the first time you take it because turbo force is named turbo force because
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:57.680]  it will take you into overdrive turbo force and enforce live calm I've been
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:03.120]  doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:09.240]  there's one type of video that is the most censored the most buried the most
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:16.040]  suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:21.200]  arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others it's so but hurt
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:25.880]  when Trump won they don't want us to have that victory they don't want us to
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:31.160]  remember what political action did and that's why the globalist Hillary and
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:35.720]  others are trying to shut in for us now this is a fight about taking your speech

[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:23.760]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:34.480]  and now your host Owen Shroyer. All right we go back to the Chicago Police
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:40.840]  Department press conference and conclude the press conference into or about the
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:47.280]  fake hate crime staged by Jesse Smollett. So this is Smollett is the one
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:53.440]  that orchestrated this crime they became cooperating witnesses in the 47th
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:58.800]  hour their 48 hour whole time so now they are witnesses to what he did so he
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:08.040]  has to be accountable for what he did he orchestrated this well I think that's a
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:13.840]  that's a subject for another day but of course it's because of what he did that
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:24.160]  we had to invest all these resources he hasn't made any statements at this time
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:32.480]  no folks when you hear the dead air that's just the press asking questions
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:37.080]  Kim Foxx and I you know look I'm a police superintendent she's Cook County
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:41.360]  state's attorney so we talk almost every day about different cases so the fact
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:45.800]  that she recused herself didn't impact the case at all
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:53.680]  listen we we have a great relationship with with our federal partners and we
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:56.280]  certainly need to have a good relationship with our state's attorney's
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:02.120]  office which we did so again you all have to remember that the erroneous
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:06.280]  rumors and innuendo that was put out there in the beginning was just that
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:10.160]  this investigation didn't turn in the direction of mr. Smollett being a
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:16.000]  defendant until the 47th hour that we had those two individuals in custody so
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.440]  one more hour we'd had to let them go we may not be here today so the state's
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:23.920]  attorney didn't drag anything we needed to put the case together these things
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:29.840]  take time this isn't TV and this is real life so it takes time
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:33.640]  Smollett learned that the hard way
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:38.680]  well who's to say the leaks came from us just because there are leaks out there
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:43.520]  doesn't necessarily mean it came from CPD you know I heard particular things
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:46.800]  that were out there that I knew was simply untrue so it doesn't mean it came
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:57.680]  from the police department we have the phone records that that clearly indicate
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:02.160]  that they talked to each other quite a bit before the incident after the
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:10.840]  incident and why they were out of the country yes yes
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:23.080]  you mean right after like moments afterwards yeah I just said so we know
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:27.840]  that they talked at least an hour so before the attack an hour so after the
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:33.040]  attack and then why they were out of the country we we know that they were talking
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:39.320]  I don't know if they were his first choice but that's who ultimately did it
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:50.320]  but we don't have any evidence to suggest that the brothers might be
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:51:07.880]  victims I think that I think the fact that this was staged and that Jesse
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:14.600]  hired these two guys to stage this for his benefit and then spin this into a
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:21.920]  criminal investigation put put them in a really tough spot as well to the point
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:29.960]  where where now they they they they were arrested for a hate crime and only
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:34.920]  because of just the incredible work by the entire team did we get to the point
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:40.400]  where we're able to get the truth from them and now we are where we are today
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:44.920]  how much did they know though did they know why this was faked or did they
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:48.880]  just think that this was some weird thing Jesse wanted them to do how much
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:52.520]  did they know so or they just look at it like a job one of the brothers worked
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:57.120]  on Empire so they they had a relationship and association so he
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:01.880]  probably knew that he needed somebody with some bulk and he knew them they
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:14.960]  had a previous relationship so that's probably the only reason he chose them I
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:19.560]  didn't see then it in it I didn't see the entire thing I saw a couple of parts
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:27.320]  of it and to be quite honest it's shameful you know because it painted
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:33.320]  this city that we all love and work hard in in a negative connotation you know to
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:39.280]  insinuate and to stage a hate crime of that nature when he knew as a celebrity
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:44.480]  it would get a lot of attention it's just despicable you know it it makes you
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:48.960]  wonder what's going through someone's mind to do something like that so yeah I
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:53:02.280]  saw a couple of parts of it and I was angered by it to be quite honest yeah
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:12.600]  well you know what that that certainly helped and and you know their
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:16.560]  count information on that really pinpointed who they were but who's to
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:20.160]  say whether or not we would have or not you know these let me let me tell you
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:24.440]  this these individuals you see standing behind me the detectives in Chicago in
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:28.520]  my opinion are probably some of the best detectives in this country so I have no
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:33.480]  doubt that they would have gotten to the bottom of this you know uh-oh is that
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:39.400]  okay yeah that's last call before closing
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:48.120]  well to be perfectly honest from the very beginning we had some some some
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:53.520]  questions about it but as I said we gave mr. Smollett the benefit of the doubt
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:58.400]  all the way up until that 47th hour of the 48 hours we could hold those two
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:03.520]  individuals because we just didn't have the total package to support that it was
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:07.200]  a hoax so when you heard me coming out saying we are treating him like a
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:12.000]  victim that was the truth because at that time that's what he was and I think
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:16.720]  anybody that reports a crime deserves this the Chicago Police Department to
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:21.920]  treat them in that fashion until we have solid evidence to prove otherwise the
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:25.040]  way in the back
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:36.360]  well you know what they did it because of the financial aspect of it now
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:40.400]  whether or not they knew the whole thing would go the way that it did and I can
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:46.800]  tell you all with 100% certainty the way that they carried this out there was
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:50.400]  never a thought in their mind that we would be able to track them down because
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:55.280]  these detectives they put in intense work and in just great work and I cannot
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:58.920]  say how incredibly proud I am of them for the work that they put into it but
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:02.480]  that's just an example of the work that they do every day that just goes
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:06.120]  unreported because it doesn't get the media attention that this particular
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:11.840]  case got but it was it was financial gang last question
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:19.880]  well he identified who those two individuals were you know we knew that
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:25.320]  then he didn't know that we knew but um yeah he helped us out when he identified
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:41.000]  them that was after the the Rye share account yes
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:55.240]  remember they don't know that that was the one piece we have about
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:00.080]  I would say about two hours of footage back and forth and that that those few
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:10.840]  minutes were not on but they can we don't know yes okay thank you all
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.120]  they can
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:23.320]  well that's at the 47th hours when the two brothers decided like the commander
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:28.400]  reiterated that with the help of their lawyer they decided to confess to the

[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:32.480]  didn't happen if you're gonna charge someone with a hate crime that you set

[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:49.640]  worshippers never in foreshore.com
[01:59:49.640 --> 02:00:12.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show all right so here are the questions that
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:16.480]  remain the devil went down to Georgia he was looking for a soul to steal he was
[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:20.720]  in a bag because he was way behind is Jesse Small at the mastermind of this
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:26.680]  whole thing or are there top Democrats involved could he have even been
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:31.240]  motivated by Barack Obama not say this was Barack Obama's brainchild but you
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:35.520]  know Obama coaxed him into this says you're a highly influential person you
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:45.760]  know you could do something about this stuff and I really don't like getting
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:50.200]  into this part of these people's psychology but I feel like someone has to
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:56.480]  do it but trust me I even feel sick talking like this it's just the truth
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:04.560]  folks. Jesse Small-ed is a racist against white people and sadly in his
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:13.120]  mind he's been propagandized so much that he justifies staging a hate crime
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:17.480]  and blaming white people because he thinks this country's racist against
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:23.520]  black people and so that's how they justify this in their in their little
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:27.400]  meetings and their little quarters when they're talking and discussing all this
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:32.720]  they justify their evil because they think that there's already evil present
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:37.200]  so they're basically saying we're gonna fight evil with evil of course Jesse
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:42.960]  Small-ed is worth probably millions of dollars as a black male gay actor so
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:47.200]  clearly not that oppressed but the propaganda is there see that seed is in
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:52.280]  his head and then it's watered by Obama it's watered by Kamala Harris and we
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:59.120]  have to ask did Small-ed even fully inform the Nigerians what he was
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:03.840]  actually doing are the Nigerian Nigerians covering for Small-ed is
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:10.400]  Small-ed covering for the Democrats I wonder if the Chicago FBI is gonna be
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:14.520]  allowed to investigate this because it sounds me like the police department at
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:18.040]  least listening to their press conference there it seems like they're
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:21.040]  just kind of want to wash their hands of this situation so Small-ed's basically
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:26.120]  gonna get nothing where I say if you're gonna charge someone with rape if you're
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:30.080]  gonna falsely accuse someone of rape knowingly wittingly you should then
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:34.640]  face the punishment that the person you accused was gonna face so Small-ed should
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:38.400]  be looking at jail time here for the hate crime or whatever whatever the
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:42.720]  crime punishment would have been he should now face that because that's how
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:49.920]  you protect actual victims of hate crime and actual victims of rape but let's go
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:57.960]  now to perhaps the dumbest person in the history of television news Don Lemon who
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:01.720]  is just your typical leftist that's trying to cover up what Jesse Small-ed
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:07.840]  did staging a hate crime because again in their minds it's all justified it's
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:11.240]  justified to stage a hate crime and blame white people because white people
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:15.560]  are evil so you need to understand at the deepest level of their psychology
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:20.840]  folks Jesse Small-ed is a racist who hates white people and wanted to blame
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:25.440]  this attack on white people because he feels justified in doing so now listen
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:30.400]  to Don Lemon on CNN last night in the court of public opinion
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:35.880]  Jesse has lost he's lost the fight in the court of public opinion and that's
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:40.280]  where his battle is whether legally if he has to go whatever he is to serve if
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:43.320]  it's jail time if he has to do probation if he has to pay whatever but in the
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:48.840]  court of public opinion it matters it matters and he's lost that because of
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:54.280]  how and not his fault maybe people were I don't know what they were saying to him
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:58.000]  how maybe because of his representatives I who knows I don't know
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.560]  I don't know poorly I don't know if it's not his fault Don the fact is his fault
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:04.680]  the fact is doing what he wanted well he went out and he gave the interview so
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:08.360]  understand this from a he saved the whole thing in perspective there's two
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:12.520]  things to think about number one is the law and whether it makes sense legally
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:16.960]  to be out there speaking and everything else from that perspective it's damning
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:20.440]  all those things you heard him say on TV are going to be played in a court
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:26.880]  was an orchestrated hoax ladies and gentlemen and orchestrated hoax and
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:31.560]  I'll tell you the critically thinking individual doesn't think this stops with
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:38.600]  Jesse Smallette because well let's just say he doesn't seem like the type of
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:43.720]  individual smart enough to try to stage this and proves he wasn't they didn't
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:48.400]  even they weren't even able to get it on camera he wrote checks the guy is an
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:54.720]  idiot but then maybe I guess that proves that he did set the whole thing up
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:11.080]  my leaps and my bounds the number one best-selling supplement family in the
[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:15.960]  world is energy drinks and energy supplements but they are riddled with
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:20.960]  dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a

[02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:59.200]  into overdrive turbo force and enforce live com it's Thursday February 21st
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:05.280]  2019 I'm Alex shows your host I will be back live in studio tomorrow I'm a
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:09.720]  shroyer there in the ATX is about to take over with a fully loaded powerhouse
[02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:14.680]  transmission for you in the fight for human liberty all right let's break down
[02:06:14.680 --> 02:06:21.600]  some of the top stories here well just he's small it did get charged the
[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:25.280]  grand jury did hand down the indictment it's a relative slap on the wrist a
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:32.800]  class 4 felony it's basically engaging in disorderly conduct and of course it
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:36.720]  is disorderly conduct it's trying to create a race war and division in this
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:42.360]  country what it really is is a divide and conquer psychological terrorism
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:49.120]  tactic that was used but because he's in the city of Chicago I'm surprised the
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:53.000]  police even followed through with investigating it and busting him but
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.240]  there is still some decency left I guess even in some of the most corrupt
[02:06:56.240 --> 02:07:01.160]  areas of this nation but the police also knew that they were going to be beat
[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:05.720]  over the head with this fiction so to a certain point doing the right thing is
[02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:10.240]  about survival isn't it especially we have a whole class of leftist
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:16.560]  professional victims organized by Hollywood the Democratic Party funded by
[02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:20.360]  major think tanks and agencies breathing down the neck of every hard-working
[02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:24.440]  American no matter what color you are or where you came from if you're not part
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:30.480]  of their cult you're basically steak on the table now the fact that Jesse
[02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:36.400]  Smollett was so arrogant so long tells me everything I need to know just like
[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:40.080]  day one it happened I said I believe this is probably staged like 99% of the
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:46.680]  other fake hate crimes that we see out there but we saw at first Fox and the
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:50.800]  directors and the producers defending him even after his story completely
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:56.040]  disintegrated I mean again who waits 40 minutes to call the police when they get
[02:07:56.040 --> 02:08:01.840]  to your apartment you have symmetrical scratches on each side of your cheek and
[02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:07.920]  a noose still hanging around your neck I mean this is the most cartoon level
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:12.000]  garbage ever and then of course the lies continue to disintegrate but why is
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:18.920]  this so important it gives us a window into the mindset of the control
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:24.040]  corporate left they are a group of fully committed sociopaths psychopaths who see
[02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:30.480]  those of us that have consciences as victims and who work in large groups to
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:33.880]  basically engage in their criminal activity I mean look at Balazi Ford her
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:38.200]  story is totally fake four of the other five women have said their stories were
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:42.040]  fake one was charged and when asked why did you do it she said well he deserves
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:46.920]  it he's a Republican so to them saying someone's a rapist that you never met
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:52.680]  ruining their life is nothing because those people don't exist because they're
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:58.080]  quote effing white males this is what the media using high-tech brainwashing has
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:04.080]  basically turned many minorities into is to caricatures of frothing KKK members
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:09.280]  who behave just like the classic KKK but are much more organized and much more
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:15.680]  powerful but after all that's all in the WikiLeaks Hillary discussing how to use
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:21.440]  culture war race war and that's what Jesse Smollett was hoping to trigger and
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:25.840]  that's why we should be really concerned because we've seen all these hoaxes
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:31.760]  come out from the Covington kids to the Balazi Ford situation to just countless
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:36.960]  others and the fake chemical attacks that turn out to be completely proven fake
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:41.000]  chemical attacks with even London Guardian confirming it but they move on with
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.280]  the next lie and the next lie of the next line so we forget about all the
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:49.640]  other lies that we've been told but again didn't gruber one of the main
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:54.520]  architects of Obamacare tip his hand he said our whole system is based on the
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:59.520]  fact of the public has the memory of a goldfish thank God they're so effing
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:04.440]  stupid and he said that on cease man thinking you're a subhuman rat that
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:09.000]  wouldn't even hear him but what's even crazier about the whole Smollett
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:15.240]  situation the fact that he's now been indicted on disorderly conduct a slap on
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:21.000]  the wrist is that Don Lemon will play clip listen a moment has doubled down
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:24.560]  even more than Trevor Noah when Trevor Noah said hey the guy's a great liar
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:31.680]  even if he lied let's give this guy a Emmy for his deception Don Lemon came
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:36.080]  out and said this was all handled wrong it was all about public opinion and how
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:40.960]  basically Smollett got demonized so that's why he's been indicted so what
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:45.680]  he's saying is this wasn't handled well the script he was given to stage this
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:50.400]  event wasn't executed correctly and so because these two guys are fellow
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:56.280]  traveler globalist he openly on CNN covers for him so here's a club of that
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:00.400]  and a club of Trevor Noah in the court of public opinion
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:05.840]  Jesse has lost he's lost the fight in the court of public opinion and that's
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:10.240]  where his battle is whether he legally if he has to go whatever he is to serve if
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:13.280]  it's jail time if he has to do probation if he has to pay whatever but in the
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:19.880]  court of public opinion it matters it matters and he lost that because of how
[02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:24.280]  and not his fault maybe people were I don't know what they were saying to him
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:28.200]  how maybe because of his representatives I who knows I don't know it was
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:43.640]  handled poorly I don't okay either this guy is telling the truth or he deserves
[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:46.520]  an Emmy for that interview
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:55.240]  think about how arrogant these people are the truth is studies show the average
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:12:00.720]  human on this planet has a good memory we just don't exercise it if you're in
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:04.960]  the football you remember a game that you watch 20 years ago if you're into a
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:11.880]  certain song then you know every piece of it from the from the different
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:16.640]  instrumentals to the vocals if you're in love with a woman you know every
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:20.120]  curve of her body if you had a really really you know bad experience when you
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:25.000]  were a kid you remember these are things that you've chosen to remember and
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:28.760]  their whole program is based on you adapting to be a slave and not remembering
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:32.800]  what happened five minutes ago that's what the television shows the radio shows
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:36.760]  everything is about very very short attention spans and the government and
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:39.840]  think tanks and the American Psychological Association admit that
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:45.280]  they embarked on a program 60 years ago to lower the attention span of the
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:51.800]  average American from about 45 minutes now to 14 seconds look it up so the
[02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:56.240]  entire system pivots around this now there's another great article on
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:13:00.720]  infowars.com by Mike Adams of naturalnews.com the independent media
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:06.360]  just saved America from a bloody race war that the mainstream media was trying
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:11.080]  to start America was just saved by the same independent media that the tech
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:15.160]  giants are trying to wipe out it's an excellent article everyone should go
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:20.040]  read it and Mike points out the elephant in the room that obviously Jesse
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:25.440]  Smollett is big buddies with Obama big buddies with all these leftist producers
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:30.560]  he admits he's a social engineer and obviously he was not acting alone he was
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:33.960]  told double down and lie will cover for you but when the police got such
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:38.640]  incredible evidence at the hardware store and from their apartments both the
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:43.640]  guys he used from Algeria himself there was nothing Smollett could do but now
[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:48.600]  protect the higher ups that's why I predict just like with Brian Williams
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:54.800]  that we will see Smollett back on TV in a year or two again thinking that we
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:14:01.160]  have no what no memory. Finally I want to get to some good news the Supreme
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:06.640]  Court unanimously ruled that asset forewars your seizure in the way it's
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:11.440]  being carried out by the states and counties and cities where sometimes we
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:14.160]  even commit a crime and corrupt police departments take your money or take your
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:19.040]  car is absolutely un-American and extremely dangerous. Next I hope they
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:23.280]  take up how imminent domain has been expanded to where even small towns and
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:27.720]  counties are trying to take people's land for less value than it's worth for a
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:31.440]  quote shopping center so we're gonna be looking at that more a lot of good
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:34.960]  things are happening things aren't perfect but the Supreme Court is a hell
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:37.800]  of a lot better than it would have been if Hillary would have gotten in and
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:41.800]  already gotten two new justices on it and that's why the globalist and their
[02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:45.800]  minions are fighting so hard because they know humanity is waking up to them.

[02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:03.480]  I get back to the ATX it's that we have come so far together ladies until we've
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:08.520]  exposed the globalist paradigm of sociopaths psychopaths not understanding
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:12.520]  emotion but trying to manipulate ours and when we buy into it mindlessly as we
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:15.760]  have a motion we have a soul we have conscience they can win but when we sit
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:20.560]  back like they do coldly looking at what they're actually doing and who stands
[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:24.760]  to benefit we still have our emotion we still have our soul we're able to shift
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:29.720]  into the psychopath mode sociopath mode and ask is the Romans would who benefits
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:35.760]  and now with Smollett and the Covington kids and all these other hoaxes you know
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:40.200]  coming out the lousy Ford the list goes on and on the Air Force Academy on and
[02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:44.040]  on their whole paradigm is blown that's what's so excited so I salute you I
[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:47.680]  thank you and just keep spreading the word we're gonna win we're under attack

[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:54.040]  globalist in you the audience are part of the info work so spread the live
[02:19:54.040 --> 02:20:14.880]  links in fours dot com four slash show you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:19.360]  all right ladies and gentlemen I have a lot of news that I really need to get
[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:29.440]  to here outside of the Smollett hoax there is more to it though and I think
[02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:35.440]  we're all kind of wondering how deep this really goes most people believe
[02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:42.440]  right now that this is going to go up the chain of the Democrat command now I
[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:47.640]  hope there is a real investigation into that I hope the FBI gets involved and I
[02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:54.840]  hope we find out if there's anything to that now unlike the the left that wishes
[02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:59.600]  and praise for racism and then gets all excited when they see some or think they
[02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:04.360]  see some it turns out to be hoax I don't hope that the Democrats are staging
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:09.640]  hoax crimes to divide this country it's just I know they're doing it and so we
[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:20.160]  go all the way back to 1987 do you remember the name Tawanna Browley
[02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:29.800]  Tawanna Browley was a black teenage girl who made up a narrative that she was
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:35.440]  brutally gang raped by a group of white men including a prosecutor and a police
[02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:44.400]  officer it didn't take long before the leftist provocateurs like Reverend Al
[02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:50.080]  Sharpton and others were immediately sending her funds and organizing events
[02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:59.200]  and protests and rallies in her support of course the whole thing was fake so
[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:05.960]  Tawanna Browley was the original Jussie Smollett so you see this isn't a new
[02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:12.040]  thing for the left this is old hat for the left to stage hate crimes blame in
[02:22:12.040 --> 02:22:22.320]  this case white people and then divide a wedge in this country that's what the
[02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:29.560]  left does so let's not forget Tawanna Browley who by the way she was issued
[02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:36.080]  fines which latest reports are she never paid and she still owes over four
[02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:41.880]  hundred thousand dollars in fines to be paid for her hoax nobody's holding her
[02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:47.360]  feet to the fire funny how that works same with Al Sharpton that guy's got
[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:53.360]  back taxes nobody's holding his feet to the fire funny how that works so let's
[02:22:53.360 --> 02:23:03.440]  not forget Jussie Smollett is Tawanna Browley another fake hate crime by
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:12.200]  racist leftists that's what this comes down to now we have to look at two other
[02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:17.760]  stories developing right now for example the US Coast Guard lieutenant that
[02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:23.920]  they're claiming is a white nationalist conservative survivalist wanted to kill
[02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:32.480]  every last person on earth in a mass terror attack so now people are gonna
[02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:36.920]  look at that and just like the Chicago police officer said now we're gonna be
[02:23:36.920 --> 02:23:40.760]  looking at every crime that the media covers and wondering is it real is it a
[02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:47.080]  hoax is it a setup is the narrative can't trust these people anymore another
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:54.040]  one that is a little less serious in its nature but perhaps even more fraudulent
[02:23:54.040 --> 02:23:59.760]  on its surface surveillance catches presumed MAGA supporter vandalizing
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:03.920]  San Francisco home this is ridiculous out of ABC News there's zero evidence
[02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:08.360]  that this individual pictured in there is a MAGA supporter he's just walking
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:14.160]  down the street you read the notes allegedly left by the person that
[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:19.480]  allegedly vandalized this person San Francisco home folks it's like it's not
[02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:22.760]  the type of letter that you would expect or note you would expect to get from
[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:28.160]  someone that's vandalizing your home for political reasons and then the guy who
[02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:34.880]  had the impeached Trump sign on his house it's claiming the victim here he
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:40.040]  won't talk to police he'll only talk to media he blurs out his his face I mean
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:46.360]  like again I'm not gonna jump to any conclusions but it's like are we really
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:51.760]  going through with this again and why won't this guy talk to the police when
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:56.800]  his house has been vandalized he apparently has it all on camera
[02:24:56.800 --> 02:25:08.800]  huh hmm so we'll continue to monitor that situation in the meantime again I've
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:14.600]  got a ton of news I want to get to here I got a video from Obama I want to watch
[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:21.280]  and I want to share with you there's just so much to get to here I got all
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:28.280]  these stories including Roger Stone has just entered the courtroom and he has a
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:40.720]  hearing right now in front of Judge Abie Berman Jackson hmm so Roger Stone who's
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:46.960]  guilty of nothing he gets rated by the FBI 29 SWAT agents guns pointed at him
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:53.320]  and he has to go see the judge multiple times but Jesse Smallette who staged a
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:57.360]  hate crime and then lied about it on a bunch of television interviews lied about
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:01.080]  it to police cost police probably hundreds of thousands of dollars of
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:07.300]  police resources he gets oh mr. Smallette would you like to come in they
[02:26:07.300 --> 02:26:10.440]  called his attorneys they said let's arrange for him to come in no Roger Stone
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:23.120]  didn't get that no hmm so it's funny how that works and then I'll cover the story
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:28.080]  that we just reposted the enforce.com from RT major advertisers jump ship as
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:32.560]  YouTube hit with soft core child porn scandal and you had this individual on
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:40.200]  YouTube that was calling it out what is the name of this guy's channel guys
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:47.400]  I forgot we're pulling it up right now the video that went totally viral from
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:53.600]  this individual but yeah of course it would do that right now wouldn't it
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:27:03.360]  that's fine just just refresh the page here's the deal with this Matt Waddis
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:09.480]  while I mean obviously this video is you know pretty powerful stuff and I do
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:14.480]  believe what this guy's reporting on is legitimate and it's worth watching but
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:18.400]  just to give you guys full disclosure we reached out to this individual and
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:22.280]  requested him to come on info wars to which he basically made fun of info
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:25.320]  wars and said we're basically trash and garbage and he would never come on our
[02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:30.920]  platform so look bud we were the ones that were breaking the stories of
[02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:35.600]  pedophiles operating freely on social media we've had multiple guests on
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:39.640]  exposing that we've even covered the YouTube videos before where they're
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:45.680]  clearly marketing in a sick way to these to these deviants and so we just
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:49.040]  reached out to you to amplify the story that you made go viral that we already
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:53.240]  made go viral before anybody even heard of you and then you basically caught us
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:57.080]  called us trash and garbage now look I'm not trying to be rude to this
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:02.360]  individual here in fact we'd still love to have you on because because we believe
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:07.920]  in this this issue and we don't want there to be pedophiles you know taking
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:11.560]  advantage of children on social media like this we don't like children to be
[02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:15.560]  abused like this and use like this so look we're in this together man so I
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:19.600]  don't care you can call info wars trash garbage fake news and discount us but
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:23.720]  we've got a huge platform and we want to amplify this story so I think it's sad
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:27.600]  that you discount info wars when we request an interview that makes you
[02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:33.040]  know that makes you know better than the mainstream news so I don't understand
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:37.080]  why that individual won't come on with us we highlighted this story we agree
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:41.240]  with the issue but he decided to trash info wars when we invited him on the
[02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:46.720]  air so I don't understand why that is dude we want to amplify your video we're
[02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:50.040]  the real news we called it before anybody even knew who you were so you know
[02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:52.920]  here's an olive branch to you if you want to come on info wars we'll still

[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:16.920]  tried the peanut butter chocolate and honestly I think it tastes like a double

[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:27.400]  war room just to show the audience I mean it basically tastes like a double
[02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:31.000]  fudge brownie that's covered in chocolate peanut butter and has peanuts in it
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:36.120]  that's what the peanut butter chocolate protein bar tastes like it doesn't even

[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:09.840]  careful about something here because I don't want this to be taken the wrong
[02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:19.120]  way and look in general I am somebody that tries to get along with everybody I
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:23.400]  don't take things personally I understand that people never want to
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:32.480]  touch info wars stuff and so fine but it's this weird it's this weird I don't
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:37.120]  even know what it is it's almost it's it the the term is there's a chilling
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:42.800]  effect basically on info wars and quite honestly folks it's like it even happens
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:48.640]  to us and so nobody wants to share info wars videos nobody wants to post info
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:53.760]  wars articles nobody wants to talk about info wars and so you know stuff we do
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:58.120]  doesn't go viral because people are afraid to to associate with info wars
[02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:00.920]  people are afraid to share info wars people are afraid to associate with
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:06.000]  Alex Jones I mean this is just what happens and it's the left that just
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.680]  outright censors us and wants us banned but also on the right and I'm not talking
[02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:13.440]  about everyone here I want people understand I'm not I'm not trying to
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:18.320]  throw stones in a glass house here I'm just telling you the truth folks nobody
[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:22.080]  wants to share our stuff so we have like the hardcore censorship of the left and
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:28.080]  then the soft core chilling effects censorship on the right so I don't want
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:33.040]  anybody to think I'm pointing fingers or playing some like jealousy game or oh
[02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:38.260]  my gosh share our stuff make us bigger trust me that's not it I just I just want
[02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:43.920]  you to I just want the audience to understand it's like so turning point
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:49.120]  USA has just shared a video of a gentleman getting punched in the face
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:54.600]  when they're out recruiting now again
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:00.520]  this video is immediately going viral it's already been seen millions of times
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:05.840]  I'm glad I'm glad turning point USA gets doesn't have anybody trying to
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:09.160]  censor them I'm glad turning point USA doesn't have a chilling effect on them
[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:14.160]  from the right but you have to understand there's this weird selectiveness
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:20.040]  right now on social media in the right about what is going to go viral and what
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:25.720]  isn't and I don't even know if it's a conscious thing to be honest with you but
[02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:31.200]  it just shows how the chilling effect against info wars works I mean this
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:34.960]  happened we I don't know how many times I've shared videos like this not even of
[02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:38.160]  me I'm not even trying to promote myself I'm talking about other people that we
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:44.440]  have on the show that have similar videos that just for whatever reason nobody
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:48.320]  wants to share nobody wants to talk about and so then at times I'm like do I
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:51.640]  want to get this guest on or not because I don't want to put the chilling
[02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:56.160]  effect on them because of what happened to them but now let's get to the real
[02:39:56.160 --> 02:39:58.920]  story here now that I've just kind of vented and just so the audience
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:03.240]  understands the full 360 censorship we deal with at info wars the hardcore
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:06.520]  censorship of the left and then the soft course chilling effect from
[02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:14.560]  conservatives here is a video of a conservative getting cold clocked
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:22.520]  cheap-shotted punched right in the face on video no doubt we got to pull the
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:27.560]  audio down guys in fact we probably dump that I just heard a curse word so we
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:30.600]  can't even play the folks we can't even play the audio because there's so much
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:36.280]  cursing in it just keep rolling the b-roll no innuendo no rumor no
[02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:42.880]  conspiracy no narrative just a radical leftist walking up to a conservative and
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:48.480]  punching him right in the mouth total violence probably could be considered a
[02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:55.600]  hate crime fact should be considered a hate crime but notice I guarantee you
[02:40:55.600 --> 02:41:03.240]  other than Fox News TP USA will probably on Fox News tonight other than that this
[02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:08.360]  story won't get picked up it won't make ABC won't make NBC the individual who got
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:11.520]  punched in the mouth is not going to be invited to go on good morning America
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:14.680]  he's not going to be invited to go on ABC and all these other shows they're not
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:17.360]  going to promote this thing they're not going to make a huge deal out of it
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:25.040]  unlike small let because you see in this country believe it or not there's
[02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:30.400]  actually privilege to being a black gay person now they're never going to tell
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:35.480]  you that but it's true why do you think just the small let got all the coverage
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:39.360]  but this individual won't but you know what forget the political leanings forget
[02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:43.360]  the fact that he's a black man or a gay man or a liberal how about it's just
[02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:48.120]  Hollywood privilege how about that how about Hollywood privilege allows just
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:51.680]  a small let to get all the coverage for his fake hate crime that never happened
[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:56.000]  not on tape they wanted it on tape couldn't even accomplish that but here's
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:02.440]  just I mean blatant right there all the evidence you need a conservative victim
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:05.800]  of a hate crime of a leftist that comes up and punches him right in the mouth so
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:09.840]  the fake just the small that story goes all the way around the world everybody
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:14.280]  sees it he gets the TV interviews this white guy who's a conservative gets
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:18.120]  punched in the mouth he's not going to get the good morning America interview
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:22.200]  he's not going to get the topic of discussion on the view he's not going
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:25.600]  to get dozens of television interviews he's not going to be going on TV crying
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:31.600]  getting a bunch of bunch of sympathy no see he's a white man conservative he's
[02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:36.680]  trash he's garbage he doesn't exist but it's not even that that's just if you
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:40.240]  want to play the whole political cards that they play the truth is they just
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:44.640]  care about ratings and so they know if they have a black gay man and they say
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:50.160]  racism homophobia that will draw ratings that's really what this is about a white
[02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:53.480]  guy getting punched in the face by a radical leftist that doesn't get ratings

[02:47:22.600 --> 02:47:28.720]  the legend oh my gosh I was about to announce that Roger Stone has taken the
[02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:36.480]  stand in a defense against an Instagram post and a wild man in a what kind of
[02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:39.920]  hat would you call that's like a Indiana Jones hat it's an open road
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:43.920]  Stetson that's a Stetson huh is that a new one they say as you get older you
[02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:47.080]  revert to your parents and grandparents yeah I'm gonna start wearing cowboy hat
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:51.440]  as in the skies so Alex Jones just let you get back but they're gonna put the
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:55.280]  New York Post image up behind you of the whole hoax this is such a devastating
[02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:59.000]  victory they say don't question big events when most of them are staged this
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:02.360]  is what they're scared of folks this is big the Democratic Party is all about
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:09.280]  hoaxes and let's find out on the war room I'm gonna take here some business
[02:48:09.280 --> 02:48:12.440]  but I may pop in with you who's doing the fourth hour I'll be hosting fourth
[02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:15.560]  hour with Stuart Rhodes Rob is hosting the war room today Stuart Rhodes to be
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:22.520]  in studio yes I should probably put a jacket on to be serious and get in here
[02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:27.480]  and talk about you know my sources told us March 1st the Mueller report now you
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:31.000]  see that's being announced our sources told us about the national emergency if
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:35.520]  they're definitely investigating Obama and Camilla Harris and all of them the
[02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:38.720]  Democrats because they're all buddies with small it and the fact that he was so
[02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:42.680]  arrogant and connections and now got his phone and his phone records that's why
[02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:46.840]  Chicago is trying to circle the wagons down trying to whitewash this but again
[02:48:46.840 --> 02:48:50.200]  the globalists don't want to take down somebody for China get a rush of eggs
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:53.680]  that's connected to Republicans as well you know not not spying but you know
[02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:58.920]  lobbying but they like something like an intern in a cigar because it's limited
[02:48:58.920 --> 02:49:02.760]  to one area this thing could bring down the Democrats and the word is there's a
[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:06.880]  major investigation going on with them involved obviously they're involved but
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:11.040]  the point is they're being investigated by the DOJ so looks like old Trumpy has
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:15.720]  Obama and the Chicago machine and Ronald manual by the shorthairs bitches but
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:19.760]  here's the problem like you said yesterday what's the new false flag white
[02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:23.600]  member of the Coast Guard was going to destroy the planet he's more powerful
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:32.000]  than Godzilla and you can actually go back and listen to the Alex Jones show
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.320]  where we literally said that this is exactly what they're going to do to try
[02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:38.160]  to distract from this just like that all of their corruption with Russian
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:41.000]  collusion how it was the Democrats and Hillary Clinton they're the ones that
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:45.240]  colluded with Russia to manipulate the election even with bots on social media
[02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:50.880]  with the Russian dossier all of that stuff then they make a cover story to
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:53.560]  then try to point the finger at their enemy that's the Russian collusion
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:57.720]  narrative the same thing is happening now small let gets caught in this massive
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:02.160]  hoax so now they've got to stage these other events to get the attention off
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:06.880]  small let and off the fact that they're about to be investigated for perhaps even
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:09.680]  funding this at the very top orchestrating this at the very top and
[02:50:09.680 --> 02:50:15.440]  you have to wonder is Jesse small let because who believes that this he really
[02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:18.520]  stops at small let I mean who really believes that that's the case I don't
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:23.880]  but an investigation will pay him a member of the Coast Guard was gonna blow
[02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:29.560]  the planet up he's white white people are gonna blow the planet up stop covering
[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:33.120]  up yeah he was a survivalist too so you know he's bad
[02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:51.240]  so that's what they're trying to but there's another one Alex I think that's
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:54.960]  right in fact it's gonna this guy was probably it was probably Trump they
[02:50:54.960 --> 02:51:02.840]  told him to do it he goes on TV he
[02:51:02.840 --> 02:51:11.000]  cries his crocodile oh but oh but see but Roger Stone gets invaded with 27 FBI
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:15.200]  agents he's on the stand right now because he put up an Instagram post for
[02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:21.200]  doing nothing oh but Jesse small let the baby of Empire the baby of the Democrat
[02:51:21.200 --> 02:51:28.560]  Party the baby of Barack Obama he's allowed to oh mr. small let we're gonna
[02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:32.240]  contact your attorneys and you know if you want to come in and cooperate that
[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:35.560]  would be great mr. small let with no pressure you know you just fake to hate
[02:51:35.560 --> 02:51:40.160]  crime and cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars of police resources you know
[02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:43.960]  there's people dying and shot the white guy to destroy the earth see but how
[02:51:43.960 --> 02:51:47.480]  about that Jesse small let and the Democrats tried to start a race war in
[02:51:47.480 --> 02:51:52.360]  this country it's not the first time and it won't be the last time again Jesse
[02:51:52.360 --> 02:51:57.600]  small let is Tawanna Brawley who still owes all the fines that were put on her
[02:51:57.600 --> 02:52:01.600]  for her fake hate crime but she's a Democrat so she doesn't have to worry
[02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:06.720]  about that we can sit around here we can joke all day and I'm not kidding the
[02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:10.680]  globalist it's an ongoing 50-round fight they're trying to shut us down right
[02:52:10.680 --> 02:52:14.440]  now they don't want us here asking these questions and that's why we need your
[02:52:14.440 --> 02:52:19.760]  support that's why I'm for short on there are a bunch of big specials so I
[02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:22.160]  think we're gonna be hearing from Alex Jones in the next segment you're gonna
[02:52:22.160 --> 02:52:30.440]  come back Alex you're gonna be so we're gonna be breaking this down ladies
[02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:42.520]  gentlemen but but just like Donald Trump just like the left ladies and gentlemen
[02:52:42.520 --> 02:52:46.360]  distracts from their own crimes of Russian collusion they're distracting
[02:52:46.360 --> 02:53:05.640]  did the white man blow up the planet yet what's happening oh the Coast Guard guy
[02:53:05.640 --> 02:53:09.120]  didn't blow up the planet yet we're still alive he didn't launch a biological
[02:53:09.120 --> 02:53:21.480]  weapon I think odd job is in studio now it's odd job Jones oh my gosh yes Alex
[02:53:21.480 --> 02:53:26.880]  Jones he didn't actually he jumped out of the airplane
[02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:36.880]  oh I'm impressed Alex Jones Alex Jones was flying back in he jumped out of the
[02:53:36.880 --> 02:53:42.280]  airplane and rock my head out of the air and and paraglided into the Info War
[02:53:42.280 --> 02:53:47.560]  studio and I remember the Coast Guard almost blew the planet up thank God they
[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:51.400]  stopped him small it was a commando and stopped don't even worry about small
[02:53:51.400 --> 02:53:57.000]  it he was actually small it broke down the door that white racist Coast Guard

[02:54:25.320 --> 02:54:33.120]  get a replay of that so Alex jumped out of the airplane he couldn't even wait to
[02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:36.600]  get back in studio the plane hadn't even landed yet so he jumped out of the plane
[02:54:36.600 --> 02:54:41.680]  he then paraglided into studio broke through the ceiling and then threw a
[02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:47.600]  Stetson hat and landed it perfectly on my head while he was in midair now
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:52.560]  obviously as you can see my head is rather bulbous and it barely even fits on
[02:54:52.560 --> 02:55:02.360]  my head there's no wiggle room Alex has a very tiny head you actually were not

[02:55:17.360 --> 02:55:21.720]  mainstream news promoting fake hate crime stories and running with that
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:25.800]  making that the big story amplifying the hate crime that was totally fake that
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:29.160]  they probably all knew was fake but they wanted to go along with it because they
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:33.320]  hate America and their racists if you would like to shut them up if you'd
[02:55:33.320 --> 02:55:37.960]  like to stick your finger in their eye if you'd like to gag them like they're

[03:00:52.920 --> 03:01:00.040]  the best brownie alright here's what we're gonna do here this story comes out
[03:01:00.040 --> 03:01:06.280]  of San Francisco and I just want to roll the whole report here now I don't want
[03:01:06.280 --> 03:01:11.240]  to come on air and say what we're all thinking after we see this video so I'm
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:18.680]  just gonna play the video and let you decide here is the next claimed hate
[03:01:18.680 --> 03:01:23.920]  crime against a liberal by a Trump supporter this story comes out of San
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:29.440]  Francisco. Imagine getting a call saying that your home was egged that's
[03:01:29.440 --> 03:01:33.160]  exactly what happened to the San Francisco resident who prefers not to be
[03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:38.320]  identified I kind of felt like the eggs was you know he's kind of gone a little
[03:01:38.320 --> 03:01:42.480]  too far with that let's rewind to three months ago when the targeting began first
[03:01:42.480 --> 03:01:48.240]  he got this letter in the mail and told me to I better remove the sign or face
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:54.520]  the consequences and it was signed MHA make America great again the sign on
[03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:58.240]  his second floor balcony it's a political one that reads impeach
[03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:03.880]  pause it right there pause right there cuz you got to break this down in a minute by minute
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:10.720]  did you notice that the letter coming from some anonymous source who obviously
[03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:16.600]  doesn't know this individual had his name on it folks they can't even they
[03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:21.240]  can't even fake a hate crime anymore I mean they do it but like how do you think
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:27.240]  they guy knew his name this guy no wonder he didn't want to file a police
[03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:33.480]  report yeah egg on your face but no I'm not judging it go back to the report
[03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:38.520]  line on his second floor balcony it's a political one that reads impeach Trump
[03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:46.040]  then two weeks ago I got a second handwritten note on the door I'll
[03:02:46.040 --> 03:02:50.520]  pause it here again if somebody is egging you and targeting you for
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:54.880]  political messages do they really write notes like that do they really write
[03:02:54.880 --> 03:03:01.000]  notes like the one previously no this is the I'm sorry I'm not supposed to be
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:05.280]  I'm not supposed to be judging this right now but I mean can I help where my
[03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:09.000]  instincts go on this now I mean this is even more ridiculous than small let
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:16.120]  continue the clip on the door that was a little more disturbing it said who does
[03:03:16.120 --> 03:03:20.360]  this what is that I've seen just shoot the homeowner decided to post a photo of
[03:03:20.360 --> 03:03:24.800]  the suspect on the app next door hoping that someone would identify him but
[03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:29.200]  what he actually found were allies I just live across the street and I'm
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:34.040]  I'm fully supportive of his signs Sarah is not only supporting her neighbor with
[03:03:34.040 --> 03:03:40.240]  words she decided to buy signs of her own he's not gonna come hopefully you know
[03:03:40.240 --> 03:03:44.720]  after everyone so I think there's strength in numbers now after all this
[03:03:44.720 --> 03:03:50.160]  interesting now does the take down his sign well the answer is no I'm no
[03:03:50.160 --> 03:03:53.440]  intention to take the sign down you can still smell the eggs that were thrown at
[03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:57.440]  this problem you can still smell the eggs they tell us I cannot investigate this
[03:03:57.440 --> 03:04:01.880]  case yet you can still smell the eggs she says what the hell does that even
[03:04:01.880 --> 03:04:09.360]  mean smell the eggs does an egg even does an uncooked egg I mean what does the guy
[03:04:09.360 --> 03:04:13.000]  not clean his place when he's got raw eggs just rotting out in his place this
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:22.200]  guy sounds like a bum no guys this is it this is clearly this was this this is
[03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:25.000]  clearly legitimate I mean let's let's let's call what it is folks this is
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:31.280]  clearly legitimate this man who refuses to give his identity who somehow this
[03:04:31.280 --> 03:04:36.480]  assailant knew his name who refuses to turn this into the police who only wants
[03:04:36.480 --> 03:04:41.080]  to talk to media who has handwritten letters and artistic drawings posted on
[03:04:41.080 --> 03:04:46.040]  his door and just a random shot of some guy walking by his house this is clearly
[03:04:46.040 --> 03:04:50.040]  legitimate folks we've got the proof the next big hate crime by a Trump supporter

[03:05:54.160 --> 03:05:58.840]  info wars comes to mind Alex Jones Alex Jones
[03:05:58.840 --> 03:06:01.840]  there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones
[03:06:01.840 --> 03:06:05.680]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her
[03:06:05.680 --> 03:06:10.800]  campaign by changing its algorithm to marry stories like the Clinton body count
[03:06:10.800 --> 03:06:17.800]  story that's according to website info wars
[03:06:17.800 --> 03:06:25.800]  after Martin Luther King has been shot to death and met with Timothy J.F.K. was shot from the back and the front
[03:06:25.800 --> 03:06:30.800]  it was almost as if it were a planned impulsion it just pan-kicked
[03:06:30.800 --> 03:06:35.800]  it took the baby out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor
[03:06:35.800 --> 03:06:39.800]  I think this is a national security imperative we have clear things that we do not
[03:06:39.800 --> 03:06:44.800]  understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[03:06:44.800 --> 03:06:50.800]  USA is this global governance at last is it one world the central bank is in charge
[03:06:50.800 --> 03:06:55.800]  Israel claims the impact was accidental some former US naval officers say it was on purpose
[03:06:55.800 --> 03:06:59.800]  they described today's action as part of a continuing cover
[03:06:59.800 --> 03:07:04.800]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow
[03:07:04.800 --> 03:07:08.800]  Russian stop denied everything he called it all fake news
[03:07:08.800 --> 03:07:13.800]  and he accused CNN of being fake news
[03:07:13.800 --> 03:07:19.800]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump it will cause a massive civil war in this country
[03:07:19.800 --> 03:07:23.800]  This is a female high-level religion
[03:07:23.800 --> 03:07:25.800]  You are at war with Russia
[03:07:25.800 --> 03:07:30.800]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks
[03:07:30.800 --> 03:07:33.800]  The White House and the President are citing info wars
[03:07:33.800 --> 03:07:36.800]  They can shut us down your next
[03:07:36.800 --> 03:07:41.800]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[03:07:41.800 --> 03:07:43.800]  It's Alex Jones
[03:07:43.800 --> 03:07:49.800]  Stuart Rhodes now joins me in studio we may also be hearing from Alex shortly he has landed back in town
[03:07:49.800 --> 03:07:53.800]  He actually jumped out of the airplane broke through the ceiling here in studio
[03:07:53.800 --> 03:07:55.800]  So we're gonna have to fix that now
[03:07:55.800 --> 03:08:00.800]  But Stuart we were having a laugh in the break about that last video we played of that
[03:08:00.800 --> 03:08:04.800]  You know I don't even know what you want to call that
[03:08:04.800 --> 03:08:06.800]  We're sitting here laughing because quite frankly it's ridiculous
[03:08:06.800 --> 03:08:10.800]  I mean this woman this reporter is like you can still smell the eggs
[03:08:10.800 --> 03:08:12.800]  There was like two eggs sitting on the doorstep
[03:08:12.800 --> 03:08:19.800]  How can you even smell the eggs when the feces at your feet is probably overwhelming in San Francisco
[03:08:19.800 --> 03:08:22.800]  But yeah it's like oh this guy won't talk to police
[03:08:22.800 --> 03:08:26.800]  He remains anonymous you saw the notes that allegedly were left on his door
[03:08:26.800 --> 03:08:32.800]  I mean I've never seen a note left like that for someone that's trying to engage in some political hate crime or whatever
[03:08:32.800 --> 03:08:37.800]  So we're sitting here laughing at how ridiculous it's become how lazy their fake things have become
[03:08:37.800 --> 03:08:43.800]  Even how obvious they've become but you know it's almost like sad that we're laughing at this
[03:08:43.800 --> 03:08:46.800]  I mean these people are trying to start a race war they're trying to start a civil war
[03:08:46.800 --> 03:08:54.800]  They're just straight up liars and we just laugh about it because we don't even know what else to do at this point
[03:08:54.800 --> 03:08:58.800]  I mean what else can we do if we're not gonna walk up to them and punch them in the mouth which is not what we want to do
[03:08:58.800 --> 03:09:00.800]  Maybe some people want to do that not suggesting that
[03:09:00.800 --> 03:09:04.800]  So it's like what can we do other than just laugh at how hysterical these people have become
[03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:08.800]  Well ridicule is a good counter-attack right that's straight out of their public humiliation
[03:09:08.800 --> 03:09:14.800]  Sure yeah it works you know our version of putting them in the stocks and throwing tomatoes at him is to laugh at him
[03:09:14.800 --> 03:09:16.800]  That's the best response
[03:09:16.800 --> 03:09:22.800]  Yeah I think that that is kind of what this boils down to it's just like look if you're gonna fake a hate crime against yourself
[03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:29.800]  And you're gonna do it so lazily that you write your clearly I mean how does this person know his name
[03:09:29.800 --> 03:09:32.800]  He wrote his damn name on the note
[03:09:32.800 --> 03:09:35.800]  I mean I like what
[03:09:35.800 --> 03:09:39.800]  And of course they blurred out because the guy wants to remain anonymous
[03:09:39.800 --> 03:09:42.800]  Well he's smart though he's not reporting it to the cops right
[03:09:42.800 --> 03:09:44.800]  So he's smarter than Smollett
[03:09:44.800 --> 03:09:47.800]  Right so he can't be accused of a crime
[03:09:47.800 --> 03:09:48.800]  Right
[03:09:48.800 --> 03:09:49.800]  False police report
[03:09:49.800 --> 03:09:50.800]  Yeah
[03:09:50.800 --> 03:09:51.800]  Yeah he's smart in that sense
[03:09:51.800 --> 03:09:56.800]  So he's a little smarter than Smollett in that he's not going to the police so he can't get charged with a crime
[03:09:56.800 --> 03:09:59.800]  But I think he might be dumber than Smollett
[03:09:59.800 --> 03:10:02.800]  I mean Smollett is now being investigated for potential mail fraud though
[03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:06.800]  Right he is FBI is looking into it and I think it's a good good thing
[03:10:06.800 --> 03:10:16.800]  And they could take that investigation and I hope that Trump will take his new new attorney general and instruct him to look into who else might have been involved in that mail fraud conspiracy
[03:10:16.800 --> 03:10:21.800]  Well and what I hope is Smollett
[03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:23.800]  I don't think this ends at Smollett
[03:10:23.800 --> 03:10:27.800]  I mean there's way too many Democrat involvement here
[03:10:27.800 --> 03:10:29.800]  He's way too in deep with Democrats
[03:10:29.800 --> 03:10:32.800]  I mean he was the actor of the year okay
[03:10:32.800 --> 03:10:35.800]  So I don't think this ends with Smollett
[03:10:35.800 --> 03:10:41.800]  And quite frankly I don't think Smollett is the kind of guy that's willing to fall on the sword
[03:10:41.800 --> 03:10:44.800]  You know what I'm saying? I don't think he has those Cajones
[03:10:44.800 --> 03:10:45.800]  He'll roll over
[03:10:45.800 --> 03:10:47.800]  That's what I would guess
[03:10:47.800 --> 03:10:51.800]  He doesn't look like the kind of guy that has a spine
[03:10:51.800 --> 03:10:54.800]  No I think he'll roll over and that's why they should
[03:10:54.800 --> 03:10:57.800]  Trump should have DOJ appoint a special investigator
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:10:59.800]  You know turn the tables on them
[03:10:59.800 --> 03:11:02.800]  Let's get our version of Mueller whatever that would be
[03:11:02.800 --> 03:11:06.800]  And turn them loose to go find out how deeply the conspiracy goes right
[03:11:06.800 --> 03:11:09.800]  Well and you know guys find out where Smollett originally from
[03:11:09.800 --> 03:11:12.800]  I doubt he was originally from Chicago
[03:11:12.800 --> 03:11:15.800]  I highly doubt that because he would know better if he was
[03:11:15.800 --> 03:11:18.800]  My guess is he's probably an LA implant or something like that
[03:11:18.800 --> 03:11:21.800]  Because let me tell you I mean I'm sure you know plenty of people in Chicago
[03:11:21.800 --> 03:11:24.800]  I know people in Chicago I know law enforcement others
[03:11:24.800 --> 03:11:26.800]  But they don't take bull crap
[03:11:26.800 --> 03:11:28.800]  They don't have time for bull crap
[03:11:28.800 --> 03:11:30.800]  They got serious stuff to deal with
[03:11:30.800 --> 03:11:34.800]  Right like the investigator said it's shame but what troubles me though is after saying it's shameless what he did
[03:11:34.800 --> 03:11:36.800]  And all the resources that were wasted
[03:11:36.800 --> 03:11:39.800]  It looks like they get a little mouthful slap on the wrist
[03:11:39.800 --> 03:11:40.800]  They shouldn't do that
[03:11:40.800 --> 03:11:42.800]  Yeah he's from Santa Rosa California
[03:11:42.800 --> 03:11:44.800]  Big shock yeah who could have seen that
[03:11:44.800 --> 03:11:46.800]  So here's this California
[03:11:46.800 --> 03:11:48.800]  You know
[03:11:48.800 --> 03:11:50.800]  Thespian
[03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:55.800]  Who goes to Chicago and thinks he can take advantage of Chicago like this with some LA tactic
[03:11:55.800 --> 03:11:56.800]  No bruh
[03:11:56.800 --> 03:11:58.800]  No not in Chicago
[03:11:58.800 --> 03:12:00.800]  I'm I couldn't look
[03:12:00.800 --> 03:12:02.800]  I think the Chicago police department did an unbelievable job
[03:12:02.800 --> 03:12:04.800]  The detectives unbelievable
[03:12:04.800 --> 03:12:06.800]  The FBI I really salute all of them
[03:12:06.800 --> 03:12:10.800]  Because you know this was not something that was probably fun for them
[03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:15.800]  And they probably didn't sleep for about three days to track down the facts for the story
[03:12:15.800 --> 03:12:19.800]  Yeah I mean going from one camera to the next and interviewing taxi drivers
[03:12:19.800 --> 03:12:23.800]  They went through an incredible you know amount of effort to trace all this down
[03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:25.800]  And they did a great job
[03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:29.800]  But what I'm concerned about and frustrated is this indicator that they might just let him off the hook
[03:12:29.800 --> 03:12:33.800]  Yeah I think that there needs to be a new president given recent events
[03:12:33.800 --> 03:12:35.800]  If you're going to charge someone falsely with rape
[03:12:35.800 --> 03:12:40.800]  Then you need to face maybe not the full sentence but you should face something
[03:12:40.800 --> 03:12:43.800]  That I mean you were going to potentially put someone in jail for rape
[03:12:43.800 --> 03:12:45.800]  That could be a whole life in jail
[03:12:45.800 --> 03:12:48.800]  You got to face something with this hate crime hoax
[03:12:48.800 --> 03:12:54.800]  I mean who knows whatever the punishment is for somebody that commits a hate crime like this
[03:12:54.800 --> 03:12:56.800]  Jesse Smallette should be looking at that
[03:12:56.800 --> 03:12:58.800]  He should be facing jail time
[03:12:58.800 --> 03:13:03.800]  Well he's he's guilty I mean multiple offenses of lying to investigators
[03:13:03.800 --> 03:13:08.800]  Each one of those is a separate offense as Dr. Paul Tonal pointed out in Fox News
[03:13:08.800 --> 03:13:09.800]  Pretty good interview
[03:13:09.800 --> 03:13:13.800]  But each each each one of them can be compounded
[03:13:13.800 --> 03:13:15.800]  So 10 15 years in jail
[03:13:15.800 --> 03:13:17.800]  Who knows how many times he lied to the investigators
[03:13:17.800 --> 03:13:19.800]  Plus the mail fraud that they're looking at
[03:13:19.800 --> 03:13:22.800]  That's a federal offense so you got a separate track for the federal offense
[03:13:22.800 --> 03:13:23.800]  That could be 10 years in prison
[03:13:23.800 --> 03:13:26.800]  So he could be looking at he could be facing multiple felonies here
[03:13:26.800 --> 03:13:29.800]  Well he is facing multiple felonies one at the state level
[03:13:29.800 --> 03:13:32.800]  And then one potentially at the federal level absolutely
[03:13:32.800 --> 03:13:36.800]  But the question is is will the prosecutors in Chicago for whatever political reasons
[03:13:36.800 --> 03:13:39.800]  Roll over and not prosecute him
[03:13:39.800 --> 03:13:41.800]  My guess is yes they will they will roll over
[03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:43.800]  That's why the feds have got to go after it
[03:13:43.800 --> 03:13:49.800]  Well it's actually I don't know how many people picked up on this during the press conference
[03:13:49.800 --> 03:13:54.800]  But you could tell between I believe that was the chief of police talking
[03:13:54.800 --> 03:13:56.800]  I believe it's Eddie Jackson I think
[03:13:56.800 --> 03:14:02.800]  And you could tell when they brought up the prosecutors there's a little bit of bitterness there
[03:14:02.800 --> 03:14:06.800]  Because he kind of said you know we need to have a good relationship with the prosecutors
[03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:09.800]  And we did this time but it sounded like you know
[03:14:09.800 --> 03:14:11.800]  Sounded like there was a bit of a rub there to me
[03:14:11.800 --> 03:14:13.800]  And I don't know if the crew can go back and find that exact audio
[03:14:13.800 --> 03:14:17.800]  It's okay if you can't guys but to me that means like they're like okay
[03:14:17.800 --> 03:14:20.800]  Because the chief of police is probably like you say
[03:14:20.800 --> 03:14:22.800]  He's not going to be the one that decides what the punishment for this is
[03:14:22.800 --> 03:14:25.800]  He's done his job the detectives did their job
[03:14:25.800 --> 03:14:28.800]  And so now it's looking at the prosecutors to say okay well what is
[03:14:28.800 --> 03:14:32.800]  What is the punishment going to be here or the FBI to finish the investigation
[03:14:32.800 --> 03:14:37.800]  But it sounds to me like they're thinking like the prosecutors are probably just going to let this guy off
[03:14:37.800 --> 03:14:41.800]  Because that's kind of the vibe I got that feels like the vibe you're getting
[03:14:41.800 --> 03:14:45.800]  Well I mean all I know is what I heard in the press conference and that's a bad indicator
[03:14:45.800 --> 03:14:50.800]  You know the asked the chief of police was asked what should be the remedy here
[03:14:50.800 --> 03:14:51.800]  Apology
[03:14:51.800 --> 03:14:52.800]  What would be justice
[03:14:52.800 --> 03:14:55.800]  Right the apology and then fines and now jail time
[03:14:55.800 --> 03:14:56.800]  Yeah I say jail time
[03:14:56.800 --> 03:14:57.800]  Yeah absolutely
[03:14:57.800 --> 03:15:00.800]  Yeah if you or I did this we'd be in jail
[03:15:00.800 --> 03:15:02.800]  You know throw away the key
[03:15:02.800 --> 03:15:07.800]  But see that's what I'm saying like there's people that have gone to jail for far less
[03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:10.800]  I mean just look at what look at what our own Roger Stone has had to deal with
[03:15:10.800 --> 03:15:15.800]  And and he didn't do anything all he did was get caught up in a fake investigation
[03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:19.800]  That's trying to target Donald Trump and had some rogue prosecutors
[03:15:19.800 --> 03:15:23.800]  You know tell him that oh you said you had three ounces of a ham sandwich on Tuesday
[03:15:23.800 --> 03:15:24.800]  You said two
[03:15:24.800 --> 03:15:25.800]  Right
[03:15:25.800 --> 03:15:27.800]  She spent time
[03:15:27.800 --> 03:15:28.800]  Yeah
[03:15:28.800 --> 03:15:29.800]  She did time
[03:15:29.800 --> 03:15:30.800]  About six months right
[03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:31.800]  I believe it was
[03:15:31.800 --> 03:15:35.800]  I don't know what justice for small it really would be like I said
[03:15:35.800 --> 03:15:38.800]  Whatever the punishment would have been
[03:15:38.800 --> 03:15:40.800]  If it were a real hate crime against him
[03:15:40.800 --> 03:15:43.800]  Whatever the punishment would have been for the individuals responsible for that
[03:15:43.800 --> 03:15:47.800]  I think that's the punishment that you would look at here
[03:15:47.800 --> 03:15:52.800]  Because that's how you can protect real victims of hate crime and real victims of rape
[03:15:52.800 --> 03:15:54.800]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists
[03:15:54.800 --> 03:15:55.800]  Get back to nature

[03:16:50.800 --> 03:16:55.800]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house
[03:16:55.800 --> 03:16:59.800]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since
[03:16:59.800 --> 03:17:05.800]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved
[03:17:05.800 --> 03:17:09.800]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day
[03:17:09.800 --> 03:17:11.800]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case

[03:17:47.800 --> 03:17:51.800]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it
[03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:04.800]  By leaps and by bounds
[03:18:04.800 --> 03:18:11.800]  The number one best selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements
[03:18:11.800 --> 03:18:16.800]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[03:18:16.800 --> 03:18:21.800]  That sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects
[03:18:21.800 --> 03:18:24.800]  We have developed hands down from our research
[03:18:24.800 --> 03:18:30.800]  The most powerful healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world
[03:18:30.800 --> 03:18:33.800]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it
[03:18:33.800 --> 03:18:36.800]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use

[03:18:40.800 --> 03:18:43.800]  Warning though, it's very very strong, it lasts 10 hours
[03:18:43.800 --> 03:18:47.800]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force
[03:18:47.800 --> 03:18:50.800]  Because it will take you into overdrive
[03:18:50.800 --> 03:19:11.800]  We've taken thousands of years of research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body
[03:19:11.800 --> 03:19:20.800]  It is filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the M4, it is a classical 360 win
[03:19:20.800 --> 03:19:24.800]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year
[03:19:24.800 --> 03:19:30.800]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get
[03:19:30.800 --> 03:19:35.800]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world

[03:19:44.800 --> 03:19:46.800]  And to be healthy and as focused as you can be
[03:19:46.800 --> 03:19:49.800]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world
[03:19:49.800 --> 03:20:05.800]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and M4sLive.com
[03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:21.800]  Stuart Rhodes from Oathkeepers.org is in studio with me here today
[03:20:21.800 --> 03:20:26.800]  We're discussing what Jussie Smallette's future could entail
[03:20:26.800 --> 03:20:39.800]  Right now though, he could potentially be facing three years in prison and being forced to repay the cost of the Chicago Police Department investigation
[03:20:39.800 --> 03:20:44.800]  And we're kind of discussing some of the legal precedents here and politics potentially involved
[03:20:44.800 --> 03:20:51.800]  But you know, I just actually was thinking, the only legal precedent that I know of
[03:20:51.800 --> 03:20:53.800]  And I'm sure there are others out there
[03:20:53.800 --> 03:20:57.800]  In fact, maybe we just like open up the phone line to lawyers, maybe we should do that
[03:20:57.800 --> 03:20:59.800]  Maybe that's what we should do
[03:20:59.800 --> 03:21:02.800]  In fact, that's what we're going to do
[03:21:02.800 --> 03:21:08.800]  We're going to open up the phone line and I specifically want to hear from the lawyers on this question
[03:21:08.800 --> 03:21:18.800]  Are there any cases that set a precedent for what Jussie Smallette did other than the Tawanna Browley case
[03:21:18.800 --> 03:21:25.800]  Where she was forced to pay fines at the time, I believe it was $146,000
[03:21:25.800 --> 03:21:28.800]  Sharpton paid off his $65,000 fine
[03:21:28.800 --> 03:21:34.800]  But Browley's fines never paid are now reaching, last reported, over $400,000
[03:21:34.800 --> 03:21:37.800]  So I don't know if there's any other precedent, but I'm serious guys
[03:21:37.800 --> 03:21:52.800]  I specifically want lawyers to call in who can talk about if there's any precedent case here that we could look at for what Jussie Smallette might have to deal with
[03:21:52.800 --> 03:21:55.800]  Now his bail has been set at $100,000
[03:21:55.800 --> 03:21:58.800]  He'll probably pay that easily and get out
[03:21:58.800 --> 03:22:02.800]  Well, filing a false police report is a crime across the nation
[03:22:02.800 --> 03:22:04.800]  Every local jurisdiction has it on the books
[03:22:04.800 --> 03:22:08.800]  And that's what he did, but they're not charging him with that
[03:22:08.800 --> 03:22:10.800]  They're charging him with disorderly conduct, right?
[03:22:10.800 --> 03:22:13.800]  No, no, no, he got hit with filing a false police report
[03:22:13.800 --> 03:22:14.800]  He did
[03:22:14.800 --> 03:22:15.800]  Yes
[03:22:15.800 --> 03:22:16.800]  And disorderly conduct
[03:22:16.800 --> 03:22:17.800]  That's the appropriate charge
[03:22:17.800 --> 03:22:18.800]  Right
[03:22:18.800 --> 03:22:19.800]  Yes
[03:22:19.800 --> 03:22:20.800]  So that happens all the time
[03:22:20.800 --> 03:22:21.800]  It happens all across the country
[03:22:21.800 --> 03:22:23.800]  I'm sure you get plenty of phone calls back about that
[03:22:23.800 --> 03:22:29.800]  But I don't feel that you can say, I mean, filing a false police report is one thing
[03:22:29.800 --> 03:22:31.800]  He made a national case out of it
[03:22:31.800 --> 03:22:33.800]  I mean, that has to be considered
[03:22:33.800 --> 03:22:38.800]  Now, if the prosecutors are dying the wool liberals, which in Chicago we kind of expect them to be
[03:22:38.800 --> 03:22:44.800]  And I think that's why the police force was kind of, you know, little hesitant to talk about the PAs in this situation
[03:22:44.800 --> 03:22:47.800]  I mean, that has to be considered to me
[03:22:47.800 --> 03:22:51.800]  If I'm a judge, if I'm a prosecuting attorney, I say, look, you made a national story out of this
[03:22:51.800 --> 03:22:55.800]  You went on national TV, you made the entire city of Chicago look bad
[03:22:55.800 --> 03:22:58.800]  You made it a political deal
[03:22:58.800 --> 03:23:00.800]  To me, that has to be weighed
[03:23:00.800 --> 03:23:04.800]  Well, sure, and that goes into how aggressively you prosecute him
[03:23:04.800 --> 03:23:06.800]  And like what Paula Thomas said on Fox News
[03:23:06.800 --> 03:23:11.800]  They could go after him for each and every time he lied to the police
[03:23:11.800 --> 03:23:14.800]  Each incident in a separate charge and stack them all up
[03:23:14.800 --> 03:23:18.800]  He could be found guilty of like 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 charges of
[03:23:18.800 --> 03:23:21.800]  And that's why his lawyers eventually told him to stop talking to the police
[03:23:21.800 --> 03:23:22.800]  Right
[03:23:22.800 --> 03:23:26.800]  Because his compounding is exposure to criminal charges
[03:23:26.800 --> 03:23:28.800]  And that's what you should do
[03:23:28.800 --> 03:23:33.800]  Make him guilty, prosecute him, and then jury finds him guilty of each of those charges
[03:23:33.800 --> 03:23:37.800]  Like 7, 8 accounts of falsifying
[03:23:37.800 --> 03:23:41.800]  And you know there's probably at least 4 or 5 times that he did it
[03:23:41.800 --> 03:23:43.800]  I mean, who knows how many, but you know he had to do it
[03:23:43.800 --> 03:23:46.800]  Because the police even said he kept saying this and he did that
[03:23:46.800 --> 03:23:49.800]  So we're going to find out, but I'm serious, I'm going to see if there's any lawyers
[03:23:49.800 --> 03:23:54.800]  Specifically lawyers that can call in and discuss the precedent here
[03:23:54.800 --> 03:23:59.800]  That Jesse Smallette may be looking at, they're saying 3 years in prison, $100,000 bail set
[03:23:59.800 --> 03:24:02.800]  But I think the national case and the politics involved in this
[03:24:02.800 --> 03:24:06.800]  This needs to be weighed more than just an average false police report
[03:24:06.800 --> 03:24:07.800]  Alex Jones
[03:24:07.800 --> 03:24:10.800]  Well, again, I'm not ready to go live with this yet
[03:24:10.800 --> 03:24:12.800]  But folks don't have some sources
[03:24:12.800 --> 03:24:15.800]  And they're just inside the government, they just said
[03:24:15.800 --> 03:24:18.800]  For over a week this has been looked at as the DNC involved
[03:24:18.800 --> 03:24:22.800]  And Obama egging him on the Chicago machine, that's why they first offended him
[03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:25.800]  And so just look for that next shoot-a-drop next
[03:24:25.800 --> 03:24:28.800]  Because obviously that's why he was so arrogant at first
[03:24:28.800 --> 03:24:31.800]  So how big is that if this comes out that they were involved?
[03:24:31.800 --> 03:24:34.800]  It's a huge deal, plus people are learning about false flags now
[03:24:34.800 --> 03:24:36.800]  The thing they're so scared to talk about false flags
[03:24:36.800 --> 03:24:39.800]  Is they want to stage more of these and never have a question
[03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:43.800]  And that's, you know, again it comes down to prosecuting attorneys and people
[03:24:43.800 --> 03:24:47.800]  If they're willing to actually go after this corrupt group of criminals
[03:24:47.800 --> 03:24:51.800]  With Democrats at the top of it, Obama, Schiff, Kamala Harris
[03:24:51.800 --> 03:24:54.800]  They were all involved with small ad people, all of them
[03:24:54.800 --> 03:24:58.800]  All right, is Bobby in Kentucky a lawyer who wants to call in on this guys?
[03:25:00.800 --> 03:25:02.800]  Okay, I specifically want to hear from lawyers
[03:25:02.800 --> 03:25:04.800]  So it's okay, if it's not a lawyer just don't even take it
[03:25:04.800 --> 03:25:10.800]  That letter, the letter that he sent to himself is the golden arrow
[03:25:10.800 --> 03:25:13.800]  You can use that letter to open a federal investigation
[03:25:13.800 --> 03:25:17.800]  Into a nationwide investigation into who else he talked to
[03:25:17.800 --> 03:25:21.800]  And now it's in the hands of the DOJ, not a potentially corrupt local prosecutor
[03:25:21.800 --> 03:25:27.800]  And how can you, I mean, who buys the excuse that he wanted more money?
[03:25:27.800 --> 03:25:31.800]  I mean, I've heard reports that he was making up to $65,000 an episode
[03:25:31.800 --> 03:25:33.800]  Empire I think has been on for five seasons, I was looking into this
[03:25:33.800 --> 03:25:39.800]  The guys easily made millions of dollars acting in this show
[03:25:39.800 --> 03:25:45.800]  So, I mean, really like, so now, and if he wants to admit to that
[03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:48.800]  Now he's got to come out and be like, wow, I'm so oppressed in America
[03:25:48.800 --> 03:25:51.800]  Millions of dollars isn't enough for me
[03:25:51.800 --> 03:25:55.800]  I think he had ambition, and I think he was also a foot soldier
[03:25:55.800 --> 03:25:59.800]  For the shadow government, the deep state
[03:25:59.800 --> 03:26:03.800]  Well, again, the evidence, the circumstantial evidence is there
[03:26:03.800 --> 03:26:06.800]  The guy went to dozens of Democrat rallies
[03:26:06.800 --> 03:26:10.800]  Good friends with Obama, good friends with Kamala Harris, good friends with Adam Schiff
[03:26:10.800 --> 03:26:12.800]  Constantly doing these things
[03:26:12.800 --> 03:26:16.800]  We do have a police officer that's called in, so we'll take a police officer's call
[03:26:16.800 --> 03:26:20.800]  He could maybe enlighten us a little bit, Jason, that's why I don't worry about his location
[03:26:20.800 --> 03:26:24.800]  We've got Jason calling in from America, a police officer that wants to weigh in on this
[03:26:24.800 --> 03:26:25.800]  Go ahead, Jason
[03:26:25.800 --> 03:26:30.800]  Yeah, I mean, as an investigator, when we take statements, whether they're suspect statements
[03:26:30.800 --> 03:26:35.800]  Complaining or victim statements, we always attach a poetry clause to it
[03:26:35.800 --> 03:26:39.800]  And if they understand whatever statement they're making is true and correct
[03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:44.800]  And if they purposely lie on it, they can be held for perjury
[03:26:44.800 --> 03:26:46.800]  Which is a surgery felony offense
[03:26:46.800 --> 03:26:50.800]  So what does that mean for Smollett?
[03:26:50.800 --> 03:26:55.800]  Let's say that they did say, you know, you realize that you're essentially under oath here
[03:26:55.800 --> 03:26:58.800]  You know, tell us the truth, and if you don't, you can be facing perjury
[03:26:58.800 --> 03:27:01.800]  Let's say he lied to them on three different occasions
[03:27:01.800 --> 03:27:04.800]  What could potentially be the punishment for that?
[03:27:04.800 --> 03:27:09.800]  Well, each incident is a separate crime offense
[03:27:09.800 --> 03:27:12.800]  Each instance is a separate offense on its own
[03:27:12.800 --> 03:27:17.800]  Each statement that he made that he knew was false is a perjury
[03:27:17.800 --> 03:27:20.800]  And it carries a felony offense
[03:27:20.800 --> 03:27:24.800]  Now, a lot of the prosecutors are not going to stat charges per se
[03:27:24.800 --> 03:27:29.800]  Because, I mean, they may use it as a plea bargain
[03:27:29.800 --> 03:27:35.800]  They will dismiss these charges if you plead a this one, avoid the whole courtroom scene
[03:27:35.800 --> 03:27:41.800]  So where does the burden fall to place those charges?
[03:27:41.800 --> 03:27:47.800]  Is that on the police, or is that on the prosecutors, or on the detectives, or where does that burden fall?
[03:27:47.800 --> 03:27:51.800]  Well, that burden falls on the state, the prosecutor
[03:27:51.800 --> 03:27:53.800]  That's what the burden approved
[03:27:53.800 --> 03:27:58.800]  To prove that he made a false statement, knowing that it was false
[03:27:58.800 --> 03:28:06.800]  But do the prosecutors have to be actively seeking those charges?
[03:28:06.800 --> 03:28:13.800]  Yes, it's ultimately the prosecutor that are the ones that choose what charges they're going to present
[03:28:13.800 --> 03:28:16.800]  Which ones they're going to go after for conviction
[03:28:16.800 --> 03:28:19.800]  They're the ones that choose that, it's not the police department
[03:28:19.800 --> 03:28:23.800]  The police department may suggest what charges that they would like to file
[03:28:23.800 --> 03:28:25.800]  But it's ultimately up to the prosecutor
[03:28:25.800 --> 03:28:28.800]  Which ones that they think that they can prove easily
[03:28:28.800 --> 03:28:30.800]  And which ones they have the most evidence on
[03:28:30.800 --> 03:28:35.800]  And in this case, I think, and I'm not speaking for the Chicago Police Department here folks
[03:28:35.800 --> 03:28:40.800]  But to me, it looked like they had a bit of a hesitation when they talked about the prosecutors in this deal
[03:28:40.800 --> 03:28:41.800]  And maybe we look into it
[03:28:41.800 --> 03:28:46.800]  I mean, George Soros funded millions and millions of dollars getting prosecutors in
[03:28:46.800 --> 03:28:49.800]  In major cities like Philadelphia and Chicago
[03:28:49.800 --> 03:28:52.800]  Now, the original one recused herself, so that could be big
[03:28:52.800 --> 03:28:56.800]  Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse

[03:33:20.800 --> 03:33:24.800]  What is going to come of this Smollett thing, and here's the thing
[03:33:24.800 --> 03:33:28.800]  We're not sitting here obsessing over Smollett because he's a Hollywood actor
[03:33:28.800 --> 03:33:31.800]  Or because we're going along with the mainstream news trends
[03:33:31.800 --> 03:33:38.800]  It's because we recognize that this could be the card that is pulled out from the house of cards
[03:33:38.800 --> 03:33:40.800]  That makes the whole thing crumble
[03:33:40.800 --> 03:33:43.800]  We already know Democrats engage in provocateur events
[03:33:43.800 --> 03:33:45.800]  They got caught by Project Veritas
[03:33:45.800 --> 03:33:49.800]  We already know they stage hate crimes, dozens have been exposed in the last two years
[03:33:49.800 --> 03:33:51.800]  It goes all the way back to Tuana Bradley
[03:33:51.800 --> 03:33:55.800]  So we got a lawyer called in from Chicago, John, we're going to go to in a second
[03:33:55.800 --> 03:33:59.800]  But first, William Gean joins us, he's just joining us right now
[03:33:59.800 --> 03:34:02.800]  William, what is your take on the recent developments here?
[03:34:02.800 --> 03:34:04.800]  What, with the Smollett case?
[03:34:04.800 --> 03:34:05.800]  Yes
[03:34:05.800 --> 03:34:10.800]  Well, you know, I was on a couple of days back about the fakehatecrimes.org website
[03:34:10.800 --> 03:34:18.800]  Which Monday morning was the first of the news cycle to begin after the Smollett case fell apart
[03:34:18.800 --> 03:34:23.800]  And really became exposed for the false flag attempt to create a race war that it was
[03:34:23.800 --> 03:34:27.800]  And fakehatecrimes.org, I don't even know who runs the site
[03:34:27.800 --> 03:34:31.800]  They've got over 349 different stories up there
[03:34:31.800 --> 03:34:37.800]  And of course, the most recent ones like the Covington case, the one that InfoWars talked a lot about
[03:34:37.800 --> 03:34:42.800]  The attempt to pin the shooting of a seven-year-old black girl in Houston on light supremacist
[03:34:42.800 --> 03:34:49.800]  And what people need to realize is not only is the left slash media corporate complex
[03:34:49.800 --> 03:34:52.800]  Running from one false flag hate crime to the next
[03:34:52.800 --> 03:34:57.800]  But beyond that, what the media is doing on a regular basis
[03:34:57.800 --> 03:35:01.800]  What Hollywood is doing with movies on a regular basis
[03:35:01.800 --> 03:35:08.800]  What the Southern Poverty Live Center and the Defamation League are doing on a regular basis is the exact same tactic
[03:35:08.800 --> 03:35:11.800]  They're trying to invert reality and make it look like
[03:35:11.800 --> 03:35:17.800]  Americans, predominantly Americans who are constitutionalist or loyal or European descent
[03:35:17.800 --> 03:35:24.800]  Are the most violent, dangerous, problematic, enslaving, wife-beating, Indian-killing people on the planet
[03:35:24.800 --> 03:35:30.800]  By the stats, we're amongst the safest next to some of the folks in Asia when it comes to actual crime stats
[03:35:30.800 --> 03:35:35.800]  And if you're looking for crime statistics and violent crime and who's actually dangerous
[03:35:35.800 --> 03:35:38.800]  It's illegal immigrants and people coming from third-world...
[03:35:38.800 --> 03:35:43.800]  But the reason why it's key to point that out is because the reason why they stage these hate crimes
[03:35:43.800 --> 03:35:49.800]  Is because they have to stage them, they have to manufacture them to try to perpetuate this narrative
[03:35:49.800 --> 03:35:51.800]  That doesn't actually exist in America
[03:35:51.800 --> 03:35:56.800]  Now, John is a lawyer from Chicago, I want to take his call, but I want to explain something here real quick about Chicago
[03:35:56.800 --> 03:35:58.800]  Chicago is a very proud city
[03:35:58.800 --> 03:36:00.800]  I'm from St. Louis, Chicago is a sister city
[03:36:00.800 --> 03:36:03.800]  I travel to Chicago a lot of times, I have a lot of great friends and family in Chicago
[03:36:03.800 --> 03:36:05.800]  I love Chicago, let me tell you something
[03:36:05.800 --> 03:36:10.800]  When Californians like Jesse Smallette come up into Chicago
[03:36:10.800 --> 03:36:13.800]  And think that they can run a muck in that city
[03:36:13.800 --> 03:36:16.800]  Some punk ass from Santa Rosa, California
[03:36:16.800 --> 03:36:20.800]  Some Hollywood actor thinks he can come up in Chicago and try to destroy that city
[03:36:20.800 --> 03:36:25.800]  Uh-uh, and I hope the city of Chicago stands united against this scumbag
[03:36:25.800 --> 03:36:29.800]  But let's go to John, a lawyer in Chicago, to get his take on this
[03:36:29.800 --> 03:36:36.800]  John, what do you think is going to be Jesse Smallette's ultimate punishment here, or do you think he'll get off easy?
[03:36:36.800 --> 03:36:38.800]  Well, can you hear me?
[03:36:38.800 --> 03:36:39.800]  Yes, go ahead
[03:36:39.800 --> 03:36:44.800]  Okay, I'm a former prosecutor, let me give you a little bit of background of what he's going to go through
[03:36:44.800 --> 03:36:46.800]  He's going to be arraigned on one count
[03:36:46.800 --> 03:36:52.800]  He'll only bring one count as a preliminary charge to get him into the system
[03:36:52.800 --> 03:36:56.800]  He'll be arraigned on that one count, he'll enter a plea and not guilty
[03:36:56.800 --> 03:36:59.800]  It's a pretty standard procedure
[03:36:59.800 --> 03:37:03.800]  They'll set it out for a preliminary hearing which he's entitled to
[03:37:03.800 --> 03:37:09.800]  Or they'll send it to the grand jury to come back and return the felony counts
[03:37:09.800 --> 03:37:13.800]  And at that time, they will add additional counts if they decide to
[03:37:13.800 --> 03:37:17.800]  Mostly, the Cook County prosecutor or felony prosecutors would love to try this guy
[03:37:17.800 --> 03:37:19.800]  They're all very aggressive
[03:37:19.800 --> 03:37:22.800]  They would like nothing more than to go after them
[03:37:22.800 --> 03:37:27.800]  So the frontline prosecutors want to go after this guy
[03:37:27.800 --> 03:37:36.800]  The question is, will Kim Fox's supervisors allow them to add the additional counts of potentially perjury for lying to the police?
[03:37:36.800 --> 03:37:42.800]  And any other statutory counts that they can throw in there, they generally try to throw as many as they can in there
[03:37:42.800 --> 03:37:50.800]  A preliminary hearing would require the police officer to testify briefly in front of the judge to make sure they got the right defendant
[03:37:50.800 --> 03:37:53.800]  That there's enough evidence to hold over for trial
[03:37:53.800 --> 03:37:56.800]  Generally, that would be kind of a media mess
[03:37:56.800 --> 03:38:00.800]  So I think they'll go before the grand jury, put a little bit of evidence on
[03:38:00.800 --> 03:38:04.800]  And then go ahead and issue a grand jury indictment on various counts
[03:38:04.800 --> 03:38:10.800]  Interestingly though, they did take those witnesses and get them in front of the grand jury quickly
[03:38:10.800 --> 03:38:13.800]  And get them under oath so they can't change their stories later
[03:38:13.800 --> 03:38:19.800]  That's why they will take those witnesses in front of the grand jury so that they will be locked in and they can't change their testimony
[03:38:19.800 --> 03:38:21.800]  That means the prosecutors are pretty aggressive
[03:38:21.800 --> 03:38:24.800]  The real question is, will Kim Fox let her superiors?
[03:38:24.800 --> 03:38:27.800]  She did recuse herself for whatever reason
[03:38:27.800 --> 03:38:31.800]  Will they let the superiors file additional felony counts?
[03:38:31.800 --> 03:38:37.800]  Now, regarding whether or not you think this is going to go away
[03:38:37.800 --> 03:38:42.800]  I don't like the fact that they charged with disorderly conduct right off the bat as a felony
[03:38:42.800 --> 03:38:49.800]  Probably, I'd have to look at the statute again, probably a class four, which is the lowest felony you can charge
[03:38:49.800 --> 03:38:52.800]  Which feels like an opening for a plea bargain
[03:38:52.800 --> 03:38:56.800]  Alright, and you're looking at a misdemeanor, you're looking at a good lawyer
[03:38:56.800 --> 03:39:00.800]  I'm a criminal defense lawyer, part of my practices right now
[03:39:00.800 --> 03:39:07.800]  I would be trying to get that reduced to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct with some restitution
[03:39:07.800 --> 03:39:13.800]  And possibly some counseling, maybe mental counseling
[03:39:13.800 --> 03:39:20.800]  And they're going to try to put some air and some time under this one and air this thing out so that the media gets off of this
[03:39:20.800 --> 03:39:24.800]  And then eventually a lawyer will come in, works something out with a prosecutor
[03:39:24.800 --> 03:39:28.800]  And you can expect this in my opinion to get reduced to a misdemeanor
[03:39:28.800 --> 03:39:34.800]  And if he's got no background, a judge would have to consider it
[03:39:34.800 --> 03:39:38.800]  But it doesn't minimize what he did, it's just that they have a choice
[03:39:38.800 --> 03:39:43.800]  They can go heavy on him, or they can let this thing kick around for a while
[03:39:43.800 --> 03:39:46.800]  And then they can turn around and reduce it to a misdemeanor
[03:39:46.800 --> 03:39:51.800]  They might even give him supervision where it's not even a conviction on his record, some restitution
[03:39:51.800 --> 03:40:01.800]  There are civil penalties for causing the government to expend emergency funds to run these things down
[03:40:01.800 --> 03:40:05.800]  And so that's not just similar to the situation out in California with Toronto Broadways
[03:40:05.800 --> 03:40:08.800]  So that's it in a nutshell right there
[03:40:08.800 --> 03:40:11.800]  Final question, let me just ask you one more question before you get off here
[03:40:11.800 --> 03:40:13.800]  And thank you so much for calling in
[03:40:13.800 --> 03:40:20.800]  How much impact does it have on the prosecutors that Jesse made this such a national story?
[03:40:20.800 --> 03:40:25.800]  Well, you know, the rank and file trial prosecutors down to 26 in California
[03:40:25.800 --> 03:40:29.800]  They love publicity cases, and they like Hammer and people like him, I'm telling you
[03:40:29.800 --> 03:40:33.800]  They've done it to, you know, congressmen, right now, Reynolds
[03:40:33.800 --> 03:40:37.800]  I mean, they had no problem locking these people up
[03:40:37.800 --> 03:40:40.800]  It's just a question of whether or not they're going to have a bit in their mouth
[03:40:40.800 --> 03:40:44.800]  And they're going to be allowed to do it, or they're going to be told to let this one stretch out
[03:40:44.800 --> 03:40:49.800]  And when no one paid attention in 12 months
[03:40:49.800 --> 03:40:52.800]  It goes away or gets reduced
[03:40:52.800 --> 03:40:55.800]  It's really just a question, that's what we have to be watching out for
[03:40:55.800 --> 03:40:57.800]  Yeah, and it looks like
[03:40:57.800 --> 03:41:00.800]  Yeah, and there's already stories that are kind of surfacing now that
[03:41:00.800 --> 03:41:04.800]  Whether they're attempting to distract from this case or not, they could eventually do that
[03:41:04.800 --> 03:41:07.800]  John, thank you so much for calling in today
[03:41:07.800 --> 03:41:12.800]  And the great information you just imparted on our audience here
[03:41:12.800 --> 03:41:15.800]  That's just, I mean, the infowars audience is just incredible, folks
[03:41:15.800 --> 03:41:19.800]  For a lawyer to call in, I get one in 10 minutes, probably one of the best callers you could even ask for
[03:41:19.800 --> 03:41:22.800]  From Chicago, from Chicago, who just laid out all the facts
[03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:24.800]  Thank you so much, John, God bless you
[03:41:24.800 --> 03:41:25.800]  Stuart, your response?
[03:41:25.800 --> 03:41:30.800]  No, I think he's right, that's the first thing I thought of when I saw the first charge
[03:41:30.800 --> 03:41:33.800]  You know, Mr. Meters, what's in the future for that?
[03:41:33.800 --> 03:41:38.800]  But I'm glad they tacked on the second charge of falling a false police report
[03:41:38.800 --> 03:41:42.800]  So hopefully there'll be more to it than that, but he's probably right
[03:41:42.800 --> 03:41:45.800]  He'll stretch it out for months and then later on it'll be a dismissal
[03:41:45.800 --> 03:41:49.800]  And remember, again, we were kind of like tongue-in-cheek, kind of joking like, oh, they'll plead insanity
[03:41:49.800 --> 03:41:51.800]  But maybe that's where they go
[03:41:51.800 --> 03:41:54.800]  Yeah, I mean, I think that's only real defense, if he's hammered
[03:41:54.800 --> 03:41:59.800]  Is it say, hey, look, you know, I've got problems, you know, substance abuse or whatever it is
[03:41:59.800 --> 03:42:03.800]  But I'll all agree to counseling, I'm basically mentally ill, yeah
[03:42:03.800 --> 03:42:07.800]  Let's get William Gean quick 30 seconds, William, we'll get more from you on the other side
[03:42:07.800 --> 03:42:08.800]  What's your response?
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:13.800]  I really hope the legal professional rise of this, I'm no attorney, but I could certainly use one to sue my detractors
[03:42:13.800 --> 03:42:17.800]  That are doing something similar to what Smollett just tried to do to all Trump supporters
[03:42:17.800 --> 03:42:21.800]  I mean, is there such thing as a class action defamation suit?
[03:42:21.800 --> 03:42:26.800]  We know there are people out there who were harmed, probably in reaction, physically harmed
[03:42:26.800 --> 03:42:32.800]  By people who were operating off of this false information about MAGA hat wearing Trump supporters
[03:42:32.800 --> 03:42:36.800]  You know, yelling MAGA slogans while beating Jesse Smollett
[03:42:36.800 --> 03:42:41.800]  There should be some type of lawsuit somewhere that could be filed by people against Smollett
[03:42:41.800 --> 03:42:45.800]  And if Smollett's employer wants to keep him on board, if they want to stand by him
[03:42:45.800 --> 03:42:48.800]  Because last report I saw was Fox saying two days ago, they're standing by him
[03:42:48.800 --> 03:42:51.800]  But that's what I'm saying, this could have become a national issue
[03:42:51.800 --> 03:43:10.800]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements
[03:43:10.800 --> 03:43:16.800]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[03:43:16.800 --> 03:43:21.800]  That sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects

[03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:43.800]  Warning though, it's very very strong, it lasts 10 hours
[03:43:43.800 --> 03:43:47.800]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it, because Turboforce is named Turboforce

[03:47:12.800 --> 03:47:20.800]  Final segment of the Alex Jones show, we've been covering Jesse Smallette, and the details will continue to emerge there
[03:47:20.800 --> 03:47:25.800]  So much to get to, I didn't even have time
[03:47:25.800 --> 03:47:29.800]  They're already claiming that Russians are meddling in the 2020 campaign
[03:47:29.800 --> 03:47:34.800]  They're claiming that Russians are now running Netflix, even though it's all run by leftists
[03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:37.800]  The list just goes on and on and on
[03:47:37.800 --> 03:47:42.800]  Legal immigrants caught with child porn, another illegal immigrant, raped a 12 year old girl
[03:47:42.800 --> 03:47:51.800]  Pregnancy centers get 399,000 from California after the state of California forced them to push abortions on people
[03:47:51.800 --> 03:47:53.800]  The list just goes on and on and on
[03:47:53.800 --> 03:47:59.800]  You've got the situation in Venezuela where Bolsonaro just sent in aid to Venezuela
[03:47:59.800 --> 03:48:04.800]  They shut down the border at Venezuela and Brazil, so there's all that developing
[03:48:04.800 --> 03:48:11.800]  And then you've got President Trump praising 5G technology on Twitter day, even saying he wants 6G technology
[03:48:11.800 --> 03:48:17.800]  Yeah, if you want to just zap all of our brains into total mush and cancer, then yeah, let's go for 6G technology
[03:48:17.800 --> 03:48:19.800]  President Trump really missing the boat on that
[03:48:19.800 --> 03:48:23.800]  But William Gean from AliPak.us is with us
[03:48:23.800 --> 03:48:28.800]  There's a big spending bill, it includes a lot of dangerous amnesty here, William, break this down
[03:48:28.800 --> 03:48:34.800]  Well, the president signed a bill on February 15th, the day after Valentine's, and most people remember the day after the day
[03:48:34.800 --> 03:48:37.800]  They heard there would be an emergency declaration to build the wall
[03:48:37.800 --> 03:48:42.800]  And so we looked on Facebook and Twitter and saw lots of Trump voters and supporters dancing and gleefully explaining
[03:48:42.800 --> 03:48:47.800]  They're getting the wall for an emergency proposal, well, or declaration
[03:48:47.800 --> 03:48:54.800]  What they missed was, or a lot of people missed, was Trump signed into a law that was rushed into law through the budget bill
[03:48:54.800 --> 03:49:00.800]  For 99% of Americans, white, black, Democrat, Republican, anybody could even know what was in the bill
[03:49:00.800 --> 03:49:03.800]  And we need to stop right there because we have broad appeal
[03:49:03.800 --> 03:49:10.800]  All Americans should agree with us when we say that Americans deserve the amount of time to learn what's in legislation
[03:49:10.800 --> 03:49:14.800]  To react to that legislation before it's voted on
[03:49:14.800 --> 03:49:19.800]  Apparently President Trump does not agree, neither do most of the vast majority of Democrats
[03:49:19.800 --> 03:49:25.800]  And the subsection of Rhino Republicans that voted for that budget bill to be passed within 24 hours of its release
[03:49:25.800 --> 03:49:33.800]  Inside the bill, there's an amnesty for unaccompanied children or minors that they can't be deported between now and September
[03:49:33.800 --> 03:49:39.800]  Anybody sponsoring one of those can't be deported, anybody living in a household with one of those can't be deported
[03:49:39.800 --> 03:49:49.800]  Anyone who wants to be a potential sponsor of a UAC, unaccompanied child, can now be waived from America's existing immigration laws
[03:49:49.800 --> 03:49:52.800]  Because of what Trump signed into law
[03:49:52.800 --> 03:49:57.800]  The bill also doubles H2B unskilled labor visas
[03:49:57.800 --> 03:50:04.800]  It increased legal immigration, he campaigned specifically on lowering legal immigration levels
[03:50:04.800 --> 03:50:12.800]  He just signed a law to increase legal immigration levels, and there's even a reduction of detention beds that will increase catch and release
[03:50:12.800 --> 03:50:15.800]  Increase the number of Americans killed by illegal immigrants
[03:50:15.800 --> 03:50:21.800]  The angel families, six different angel parents were in the Oval Office begging him not to sign the bill, he signed the bill
[03:50:21.800 --> 03:50:26.800]  So at this moment Trump is not responding to us, he's not responding to the angel parents
[03:50:26.800 --> 03:50:34.800]  He's not responding to the people that he made a lot of promises to win the election, so historically in 2016
[03:50:34.800 --> 03:50:43.800]  So next week we have to be ready because there are already, Jared Kushner who has his offices at 666 Fifth Avenue in New York
[03:50:43.800 --> 03:50:50.800]  Is in charge of this, he's Trump's surrogate, Trump's the hand of Trump in this matter
[03:50:50.800 --> 03:50:56.800]  And he's already meeting with big businesses, planning to pass another immigration bill probably before anybody can read it
[03:50:56.800 --> 03:51:01.800]  With more legal immigration increases and more amnesties for illegal immigrants
[03:51:01.800 --> 03:51:06.800]  Now, this is an unpopular opinion, I think maybe when it comes to populism
[03:51:06.800 --> 03:51:10.800]  But I think when it comes to common sense and logic, this is not meant to be insensitive
[03:51:10.800 --> 03:51:18.800]  I think we need to look at what we did in 1920 to about 1965 when we pretty much just halted all immigration
[03:51:18.800 --> 03:51:21.800]  And there were reasons for this, economic reasons, etc
[03:51:21.800 --> 03:51:26.800]  And I just say, hey look, this isn't because we don't want immigrants here, we obviously want immigrants here
[03:51:26.800 --> 03:51:31.800]  So many great immigrants have come here and contributed to the society, but we have a national emergency
[03:51:31.800 --> 03:51:36.800]  I mean, there's a national emergency at the southern border, there's a national emergency in the whole country when it comes to illegal immigrants
[03:51:36.800 --> 03:51:41.800]  I mean, we've got probably at least 20, maybe 30 million illegal immigrants in this country right now
[03:51:41.800 --> 03:51:44.800]  And who knows what that's doing to us economically and culturally
[03:51:44.800 --> 03:51:48.800]  We need to address this and get this figured out before we take in another 30 million
[03:51:48.800 --> 03:51:49.800]  Stuart?
[03:51:49.800 --> 03:51:53.800]  Well, yeah, and William, so at this point is that that's why Trump was elected
[03:51:53.800 --> 03:51:59.800]  He was elected to put a stop to this pattern that's destructive of our country
[03:51:59.800 --> 03:52:06.800]  And unfortunately, he has signed into law a budget bill, like you said, that creates basically a wide open amnesty
[03:52:06.800 --> 03:52:11.800]  I mean, we're talking about potentially millions of people who are now immune from being deported
[03:52:11.800 --> 03:52:13.800]  Including the ones who are already here illegally, right?
[03:52:13.800 --> 03:52:20.800]  Uh, anybody that wants to sponsor a UAC or be a potential sponsor or live in a household
[03:52:20.800 --> 03:52:25.800]  And we would contend that the bill actually will increase child trafficking, which is horrible
[03:52:25.800 --> 03:52:31.800]  Because the black market value of an unaccompanied illegal aid and child just went up through the roof
[03:52:31.800 --> 03:52:36.800]  With the signing of this bill, but once again, this was all conducted and it was planned in secrecy
[03:52:36.800 --> 03:52:43.800]  It was rolled out and voted into law within less than 24 hours signed by the president, despite the angel of families, please
[03:52:43.800 --> 03:52:50.800]  And now he said at his press conference, he wants to move on to broader broader or larger immigration reform
[03:52:50.800 --> 03:52:57.800]  Well, I've been fighting amnesty bills for 15 years, immigration reform means they're going to go for pass an amnesty for 10 plus million illegal aliens
[03:52:57.800 --> 03:53:02.800]  And if people, especially people who voted for or support Donald Trump or want to see him win in 2020
[03:53:02.800 --> 03:53:06.800]  Don't join with us to try to put a stop to this
[03:53:06.800 --> 03:53:09.800]  I think his chances of winning in 2020 go down
[03:53:09.800 --> 03:53:15.800]  I think the chances of saving the country because we may already be crossing a point of no return
[03:53:15.800 --> 03:53:20.800]  There's so many illegal immigrants voting in elections, especially in states like California and Nevada
[03:53:20.800 --> 03:53:24.800]  Millions, millions, millions of non-citizens are voting
[03:53:24.800 --> 03:53:28.800]  And millions of non-citizens voted against Trump in 2016
[03:53:28.800 --> 03:53:33.800]  But he hasn't taken care of that campaign promise to get them off of the voter registrations
[03:53:33.800 --> 03:53:39.800]  So if you like Trump or you're upset with Trump, either way, we really like your support at alipac.us
[03:53:39.800 --> 03:53:47.800]  Because next, please get on our email alerts because next week, we've really, every single Republican lawmaker that signed that budget bill
[03:53:47.800 --> 03:53:50.800]  Or voted for it, Trump and the members of the House and the Senate
[03:53:50.800 --> 03:53:56.800]  We've really got to pressure them hard next week and make it very clear to them that we're not going to put up with secret legislation
[03:53:56.800 --> 03:54:03.800]  We need to take this Jesse Smollett case and use that to go after the Soros groups at Right Wing Watch
[03:54:03.800 --> 03:54:08.800]  The ADL and the Southern Poverty Law Center who are out there doing Jesse Smollett kind of
[03:54:08.800 --> 03:54:13.800]  Thosflag reporting every single day against good Americans that have no racist intentions
[03:54:13.800 --> 03:54:17.800]  Well, and that's the thing too, everything these people report is Jesse Smollett level
[03:54:17.800 --> 03:54:19.800]  I mean, they say there's no crisis at the southern border
[03:54:19.800 --> 03:54:21.800]  There's damn children being trafficked
[03:54:21.800 --> 03:54:23.800]  I mean, they've complained about children being put in cages
[03:54:23.800 --> 03:54:26.800]  How about children being trafficked for rape and sex?
[03:54:26.800 --> 03:54:33.800]  So here's my thing, I can put my politics aside and just kind of be reasonable and think about solutions here
[03:54:33.800 --> 03:54:38.800]  So I would say, okay, look, we've got 20, 30 million illegal immigrants here
[03:54:38.800 --> 03:54:41.800]  We got to do something about it, we can't deport them all, not all of them are bad people
[03:54:41.800 --> 03:54:43.800]  Some of them actually want to contribute
[03:54:43.800 --> 03:54:46.800]  So I would say, okay, fine, you want to cut a deal for amnesty?
[03:54:46.800 --> 03:54:49.800]  Let's think about this reasonably and let's say, okay, fine
[03:54:49.800 --> 03:54:53.800]  You want to cut a deal for amnesty? We just made 10 million illegal immigrants
[03:54:53.800 --> 03:54:57.800]  We just gave them a path to citizenship in the next 10 years per se
[03:54:57.800 --> 03:55:00.800]  Well then fine, okay, stop immigration then
[03:55:00.800 --> 03:55:04.800]  Stop whatever, however long it takes for 10 million more people to come here
[03:55:04.800 --> 03:55:06.800]  Stop immigration for that many years
[03:55:06.800 --> 03:55:07.800]  That's what Reagan did, right?
[03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:09.800]  But here's the problem, here's the problem with the deal
[03:55:09.800 --> 03:55:13.800]  Even if you only gave amnesty to one million illegals like Reagan did in 86
[03:55:13.800 --> 03:55:16.800]  Which caused the current disaster of 22 million
[03:55:16.800 --> 03:55:21.800]  At that point, it becomes numerically impossible for anybody campaigning on the things that Donald Trump did
[03:55:21.800 --> 03:55:25.800]  Of securing the border and stopping and enforcing our existing immigration laws
[03:55:25.800 --> 03:55:29.800]  It becomes impossible for anyone like that to ever win another national election
[03:55:29.800 --> 03:55:35.800]  And within 10 to 20 years, Democrats take full and permanent monopoly control of the presidency
[03:55:35.800 --> 03:55:37.800]  The Supreme Court, Congress and the Senate
[03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:41.800]  This is actually key, Stuart, I want you to break down the history of this
[03:55:41.800 --> 03:55:45.800]  Because the theory was, if Reagan did this, it would curtail illegal immigration
[03:55:45.800 --> 03:55:46.800]  It did the exact opposite
[03:55:46.800 --> 03:55:48.800]  Right, he incentivized it
[03:55:48.800 --> 03:55:52.800]  He said, hey, if we can wait and stay there long enough, we'll eventually get amnesty
[03:55:52.800 --> 03:55:55.800]  Which is going to be reality pretty soon
[03:55:55.800 --> 03:56:00.800]  So William, what should we be doing right now to stop what you see as coming in the next two weeks?
[03:56:00.800 --> 03:56:06.800]  And what can Trump do to fix what he just did that was a mistake by signing that budget bill?
[03:56:06.800 --> 03:56:10.800]  Well right now, the main thing we want to try to pressure Trump on is to not do it again
[03:56:10.800 --> 03:56:14.800]  And that's going to take his own supporters being willing to hold him accountable
[03:56:14.800 --> 03:56:19.800]  If you're an ever-Trumper that's, you know, never going to criticize the president no matter what he says or does
[03:56:19.800 --> 03:56:21.800]  You've already been neutralized in this fight
[03:56:21.800 --> 03:56:24.800]  The Democrats are never going to listen to you and Trump has no reason to listen to you
[03:56:24.800 --> 03:56:30.800]  So the main people who can make a difference here are the people who voted for Trump like I did
[03:56:30.800 --> 03:56:33.800]  Who maybe donated to him or volunteered for him like I did
[03:56:33.800 --> 03:56:38.800]  Who are going to speak out and organize with groups like Alipak.us or NumbersUSA or FAIR
[03:56:38.800 --> 03:56:44.800]  Organize, we need people to organize with the anti-illegal immigration, anti-amnesty groups immediately
[03:56:44.800 --> 03:56:48.800]  And to get ready for what's coming next week because we just got steamrolled
[03:56:48.800 --> 03:56:52.800]  And for 15 years I've been fighting amnesty and legislation in D.C.
[03:56:52.800 --> 03:56:58.800]  And it's been hard-fought battles where shoestring organizations like mine have taken on million-dollar, billion-dollar lobbying efforts
[03:56:58.800 --> 03:57:06.800]  And we've won, we've won every time because the vast majority of Americans like 80-plus percent don't want amnesty and are with us
[03:57:06.800 --> 03:57:11.800]  We lost on Friday, but at the hand of Trump, we lost our first amnesty battle
[03:57:11.800 --> 03:57:15.800]  It's going to cost Americans lives and if we lose the next one, we could lose the war
[03:57:15.800 --> 03:57:21.800]  There is a place where the war is lost, where they have pumped in so many people from around the world
[03:57:21.800 --> 03:57:26.800]  With antithetical views of the United States and the indigenous people like us that live here now
[03:57:26.800 --> 03:57:31.800]  That they take control and there's no peaceful political way left to stop that
[03:57:31.800 --> 03:57:35.800]  And that's why they're all rushing the border right now to come in here, vote illegally and they want to turn Texas blue
[03:57:35.800 --> 03:57:42.800]  Thank you so much, William, Geen, AliPak.us, StewartRoads, Oathkeepers.org
