[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.000 --> 00:29.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29.000 --> 00:39.000]  Wow, there is massive economic news coming in around the globe that does not bode well, obviously, in even the short and mid term.
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  That's huge, needs to be covered.
[00:41.000 --> 00:50.000]  We have the controlled corporate media's death dance they're doing as they destroy what little bit of credibility they might have had left with somebody,
[00:50.000 --> 01:00.000]  running around desperately defending Hillary's health, saying that it's sexist to even talk about it, saying we owe Hillary an apology.
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  I mean, this would be comedic if it wasn't so real and so serious.
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.000]  We have hundreds and hundreds of articles talking about Democrats meeting and the DNC talking about a replacement for Hillary,
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  but then when I covered it last night, they have the establishment media come out and say, I'm making it up,
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  even though I have a giant stack of mainstream news admitting these discussions are going on.
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  So it's very schizophrenic what they engage in, very, very bizarre, very, very easy to discredit.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  It's just wild.
[01:32.000 --> 01:43.000]  They don't even bother explaining a lie from five minutes before when they say something completely new and then criticize you for being right.
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.000]  It's wild.
[01:45.000 --> 01:53.000]  And then we've also got really the big issue that in every internal poll, Trump's been ahead all along.
[01:53.000 --> 02:02.000]  But a month or so ago, all of the propaganda, all of this information that Trump was way behind and that the nation had turned against him,
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  some weak-minded people began to believe that was true.
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  And so his lead narrowed in real scientific polls.
[02:09.000 --> 02:23.000]  And they did stuff like add 10 to 15 points in some polls, other polls, only five points, more Democrats in the sampling to create that fraudulent reality.
[02:23.000 --> 02:35.000]  But despite all of that, Trump is a good five to 10 points ahead in fraudulent polls and 10 to 15 points ahead in many internal polls that I know major political parties are doing.
[02:35.000 --> 02:44.000]  Trump's doing it, the Republicans are doing it separately, the Democrats are doing it, and that's why they are in full hysterical panic mode.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  Because the Republican Party's been criminal and it's worked with the globalist and it's very bad.
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  And they've tried to block Trump.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  But the Democrats have been even worse.
[02:52.000 --> 03:01.000]  And when they don't secure the White House, all their crimes are going to start coming out and their whole system is in ashes.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  And a lot of them are going to prison.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  And why do they intend to steal the election?
[03:05.000 --> 03:06.000]  It's why they're federalizing it.
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.000]  It's why they're pulling out all the stops.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  It's why they're so wild-eyed.
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  Because the stakes, and I'm getting mega chills right now, just mega chills.
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  My spirit is just on fire right now.
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  This is such an incredible battle, incredible time to be alive.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  Because I'm sitting there saying this and it's so true.
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  It's like, whoa, talk about edge of your seat.
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.000]  You talk about over the top, this is it.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  And I've been a bad boy about getting your phone calls the last few days because there's been so much news.
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  I want to open the phones up specifically only today.
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  At least when we first take calls.
[03:47.000 --> 03:53.000]  On Hillary's collapse, on Hillary's deplorable comment, how bad does that hurt her?
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  And where do you think the selection is going and do you think they'll try to substitute somebody else in?
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.000]  They're talking about Biden.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.000]  They're even talking about Sanders.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  They're talking about Tim Kaine.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  It's all coming up today.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  I'll give the number out at the start of the next segment.
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  But specifically, if I can just give it out now, I'm going to hang up on you if it's another subject.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  Because the calls just have gotten too out of control.
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  People call in, talk about themselves, talk about their buddies, talk about old beefs with people.
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  So this is not, you know, the stratosphere hour.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  So some days, I'm going to specifically say it's on this topic.
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000]  That's it.
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.000]  I'd love to hear from you.
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  800-25-99231.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  800-25-99231.
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  You won't have to hold long on one of your calls very, very quickly.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  800-25-99231.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  And let's do first-time callers.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  Or folks that haven't called in a few years at least.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  800-25-99231.
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  The Vice President candidate, Cain, has come out and attacked yours truly yesterday.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  And they alt-media again, because I guess Hillary can't talk too well.
[04:54.000 --> 04:55.000]  He's parroting that.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  It's a big broadcast, a bunch of big casts.
[04:58.000 --> 04:59.000]  Please spread the word.
[04:59.000 --> 05:28.000]  This is Historic.
[05:29.000 --> 05:44.000]  It was her decision not to go, because she was afraid that if she went to the hospital, it would make it look like she was even sicker and it would hurt her campaign even more.
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.000]  So it was her decision not to do that, Klein said.
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.000]  The author of the upcoming Clinton book, Guilty as Sin, described his source this way.
[05:52.000 --> 06:02.000]  The source, who was one of Hillary's friends for the last three decades, you can find more reports like this as we expose Hillary Clinton sickness at Infowars.com.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  Minerals and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[06:25.000 --> 06:33.000]  In the history of Infowars' life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[06:33.000 --> 06:43.000]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[06:47.000 --> 06:54.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure.
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  That's InfowarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[07:00.000 --> 07:02.000]  Take action now before we sell out.
[07:02.000 --> 07:11.000]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Infowar, a 360 win.
[07:11.000 --> 07:18.000]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at Infowarsstore.com.
[07:18.000 --> 07:26.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[07:31.000 --> 07:41.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month. Just go to Infowarsstore.com, select your favorite product or products.
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  Click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[07:45.000 --> 07:52.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at InfowarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[07:52.000 --> 07:53.000]  10% off on auto ship.
[07:53.000 --> 08:02.000]  Win, win, win at InfowarsLife.com, free shipping on orders above $50 and all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[08:02.000 --> 08:31.000]  Music playing.
[08:31.000 --> 08:37.000]  Music playing.
[08:37.000 --> 08:48.000]  Yeah, every time Hillary has one of those seizures, if her attendance aren't there, she bangs her head and she wakes the dead.
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  Looks like mental health didn't help in her too much.
[08:54.000 --> 09:00.000]  You see, she's already dead in her soul.
[09:00.000 --> 09:09.000]  So, I guess there's no coming back from that.
[09:09.000 --> 09:17.000]  I talk about this a lot, but it just gets more and more intense as days and weeks and months and years go by for everybody.
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.000]  This world is so frantic. It's so wild.
[09:21.000 --> 09:35.000]  It's quite frankly so incredibly riveting and just edge of your seat excitement and there's the good, the bad and the ugly taking place all around us.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  We have the mainstream dinosaur media trying to prop Hillary up.
[09:39.000 --> 09:50.000]  We have them using every dirty trick of deception under the sun and I'm learning about new forms of deception every day as they, I guess, invent new forms of evil.
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  They're going around continually inventing new forms of evil.
[09:53.000 --> 10:04.000]  As the Bible says, we've got Google being caught on a daily basis censoring different Hillary terms, Clinton deathlets terms.
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.000]  But like whack-a-mole, they have to stay in constant contact with the White House.
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  This is all admitted as they tweak what to censor.
[10:12.000 --> 10:21.000]  So for now, if you type in Hillary, the top things that pop up are Clinton seizure, Clinton dead, Clinton age.
[10:21.000 --> 10:29.000]  But of course, Google working closely with the White House, I'm sure will stop the will of the people and stop those being the top search.
[10:29.000 --> 10:41.000]  But despite the establishment media having the algorithms, the bots, the computers and running the big systems, they are having their butts handed to them right now
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  in the information war.
[10:43.000 --> 10:54.000]  So as Hillary told Congress four years ago, desperately trying to get propaganda legalized inside the U.S. and to get the CIA more than 20 billion a year alone to engage in war with the American people.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  And by the way, she got that money.
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  Despite that, we are cleaning these globalist clocks.
[11:01.000 --> 11:12.000]  We're exposing the foreign multinationals and their agents and their operatives and no amount of fancy propaganda, no amount of Internet kill switches can put Humpty Dumpty back up on the wall again.
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  And I've always used the Humpty Dumpty analogy.
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.000]  I'm not using that because it fits so well.
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  But I am because it does fit so well.
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.000]  All the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put Hillary Clinton's brain back together again.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  So it is certainly historical.
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  It's like something out of a Greek tragedy, out of fairy tales.
[11:36.000 --> 11:44.000]  There's a reason we have cliches and fairy tales and parables and legends because real things like that happen over and over again.
[11:44.000 --> 11:56.000]  And all the King's horses and all the King's men cannot put Hillary Clinton and the Clinton crime family and the Bushes back up on their little pedestal again.
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.000]  Because Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall up high.
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
[12:04.000 --> 12:14.000]  And all the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put that criminal piece of trash back together again.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  And it's just going to get more intense from here.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  The enemy is going to strike back in big and nasty ways.
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  But no, throughout all of this, this is the animating contest of liberty that has always tested humanity's metal.
[12:27.000 --> 12:39.000]  And I am honored to be here and honored to know all of you of every race, color, and creed that are the human race who all bleed red blood and have a soul made by God.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  Let me just attempt to give you the news coming up.
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.000]  This is so over the top.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  The economic news over the top.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  The Russian news over the top.
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  The Middle East news just absolutely over the top.
[12:51.000 --> 13:02.000]  Hundreds of mainstream publications from Fox to CNN to the New York Times to the Daily Mail saying the Democrats are meeting to replace Hillary right now.
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  We told you that yesterday because the Democrats were tweeting about it.
[13:06.000 --> 13:07.000]  People thought we made it up.
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.000]  Now it's hundreds of papers.
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.000]  We don't make stuff up.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  We're wrong sometimes, not often.
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.000]  But if folks figured out yet, we say sensational stuff because the universe is sensational.
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  Hundreds of billions of galaxies photographed by Hubble.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  Sensational.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  Hillary collapsing on the Benghazi 9-11 anniversary at ground zero.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  Sensational.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  Because reality is amazing.
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  It's crazier than non-reality.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.000]  True words have never been spoken.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  Okay.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  We've got the top Hillary search again.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  No matter what they do is the fact that what's really going with her health.
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.000]  We have a report by Kit Daniels because I keep getting mobbed by emails and calls and friends and family going,
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  he's wearing seizure glasses.
[13:56.000 --> 13:57.000]  Here's the brand.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  Here's the blue Zeiss lenses.
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  I know we've written about it for months.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  We've talked about it.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  And I'm not complaining.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  It's just people are really upset about this.
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  You've got articles up there on infowars.com.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  Drudge has had the reports at drudgereport.com.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  The mainstream media is still ignoring it.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  That's how controlled they are, folks.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  But here's the biggest one.
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.000]  I'm going to make a big deal out of this with a special message to her later today.
[14:22.000 --> 14:30.000]  Because we have this Alex Witt, the same one on MSNBC that called me, quote, deeply racist with no evidence.
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.000]  And my lawyer said, yeah, you can win millions, but it'll take years and cost millions.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  And I said, no, she discredits herself making crap up like that.
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  Alex Jones doesn't like Obamacare because he's deeply racist.
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  I mean, this woman is a piece of work.
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  She's a obvious narcissistic power tripping lunge.
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  Imagine the hell of being married to that woman.
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  Now, I mean, this is Jezebel and she's sitting up there.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  And over and over again, the last two days, we've got clips are going.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  Hillary barely stumbled and wobbled a little big deal of super hot out there.
[15:06.000 --> 15:07.000]  I couldn't handle that heat.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  This woman's incredible.
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.000]  And then she doesn't show her fall down and be drugged into the vehicle deceiving her viewers.
[15:13.000 --> 15:20.000]  And this is what they do system wide on mainstream TV other than Fox.
[15:20.000 --> 15:29.000]  I mean, the control of them saying this is the since they had to show the video because the new media showed it on Sunday.
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  They tried to shut it down and take it off YouTube and Google and the rest of it in daily motion and in Facebook.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  Despite that, we went and licensed that we paid for it so they couldn't stop us.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  Sure, we can battle them in court for a few months or whatever.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  And then the issue is over.
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  So I went ahead and paid up.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  Paul Watson did made the right move.
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.000]  That was asleep.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  It was like Sunday night, Monday morning at 2 a.m. when he bought the footage.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  I just gone to bed.
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  And so they failed to say it didn't exist.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.000]  First, it didn't exist.
[15:57.000 --> 16:05.000]  Okay, and then they just show you the first five seconds and not the next 15 where she falls.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.000]  They have to pick her up.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  Her feet are under her being drugged.
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  Her shoe comes off.
[16:10.000 --> 16:17.000]  The police before the footage even came out said, yeah, they threw in the back of a van like a sack of meat.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  She totally collapsed.
[16:19.000 --> 16:23.000]  By the way, we have ABC News New York coming up saying she died.
[16:23.000 --> 16:24.000]  Now, obviously that's a mistake.
[16:24.000 --> 16:30.000]  But when we called the other offices yesterday, they said, well, it was in the teleprompter.
[16:30.000 --> 16:36.000]  Just like BBC said, we said building seven blew up and fell because it was in the transcript we were given.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  And I went and looked who gave them the transcript.
[16:37.000 --> 16:38.000]  It was Reuters.
[16:38.000 --> 16:39.000]  I said, was it Reuters?
[16:39.000 --> 16:40.000]  And they go, we're not going to tell you.
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.000]  Five years later, they admitted Reuters told them building seven fell before it fell.
[16:44.000 --> 16:50.000]  The point is, is that somebody's writing these scripts that Hillary's already died.
[16:50.000 --> 16:58.000]  And then Bill Clinton is on Charlie Rose last night and Hillary supposedly on CNN via phone completely freaked out.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  They say, well, if you're okay, can we send cameras?
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.000]  Oh, no, you can't do that.
[17:01.000 --> 17:06.000]  I mean, this is getting real suspicious by the moment.
[17:06.000 --> 17:13.000]  And a lot of folks say that doesn't look like her that comes out of the Chelsea's house and hugs a little girl.
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.000]  I think it does look like her.
[17:14.000 --> 17:19.000]  She just looks so much older now and so sick.
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.000]  I think that was the real Hillary Clinton.
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.000]  Folks are mad at me saying it wasn't a body double.
[17:24.000 --> 17:25.000]  LBJ had a body double.
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  Other politicians have had them.
[17:27.000 --> 17:28.000]  I mean, the Russians were big into that.
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.000]  We know it goes on.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  I'm not saying it's not happening.
[17:31.000 --> 17:37.000]  All I'm telling you is, why would you put a body double that looks as sick as Hillary out there?
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  That's all I'm saying.
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  But listen, it's up for interpretation.
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.000]  As much as these people lie, Hillary could be dead and they just put a body double in.
[17:45.000 --> 17:46.000]  Hell, put one in.
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  Put a black lady in and say it's Hillary.
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.000]  The mainstream media lies so much.
[17:49.000 --> 18:00.000]  Maybe put an Eskimo in with red hair or Ronald McDonald and say, oh, Hillary always had red hair and a red nose and white skin and wore, you know, yellow shoes.
[18:00.000 --> 18:06.000]  Now, before the New York Times and Media Matters report on that, which they will, they deceive their viewers and listeners.
[18:06.000 --> 18:07.000]  That was called satire.
[18:07.000 --> 18:15.000]  But at a certain point, we're there, ladies and gentlemen, where they could have Ronald McDonald show up at the debates.
[18:15.000 --> 18:26.000]  Let's say six and a half feet tall, be wearing a striped shirt of a booby, a pirate, up there with his Michael Jackson gloves on, perving out.
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  And then they'd say, shut up, sexist.
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  Hillary Clinton always has been a six and a half foot red clown.
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  Now, getting serious, listen to this.
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  This is not satire.
[18:36.000 --> 18:42.000]  Huffington Post, Clinton owed an apology from media for questioning health.
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  They actually say that.
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  That she's the pitcher of health and an incredible stamina.
[18:48.000 --> 18:49.000]  And then it goes on from there.
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  Here's another one.
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  We have another report here.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  I'm on poor, cry sexism.
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.000]  Quote, can't a girl have a sick day?
[18:59.000 --> 19:06.000]  Oh, she's just got pneumonia while she's coughing the last few years and falling down and then, and they've got a guy with an EpiPen standing next to her.
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.000]  Now, I'm going to get more into this later and play all these clips and break it down.
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.000]  I want to get to your phone calls first at the bottom of the hour.
[19:13.000 --> 19:14.000]  Next segment.
[19:14.000 --> 19:22.000]  I want to play these Trump clips where he is on the attack because we got Obama saying bitter clingers, but that's just audio with Hillary.
[19:22.000 --> 19:27.000]  We have Hillary saying that half his supporters are deplorable, evil people.
[19:27.000 --> 19:37.000]  And then we've got the usual suspect attack dogs running around saying that no, they're all horrible and basically aren't human.
[19:37.000 --> 19:38.000]  And this is their attitude.
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.000]  And this is where they stand.
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  It's like Cuomo of New York last year saying,
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  you're pro gunner, pro life, get out of the state.
[19:43.000 --> 19:44.000]  They said, you mean that?
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.000]  He goes, yeah, I'll have you arrested.
[19:45.000 --> 19:46.000]  Get out.
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.000]  You're not welcome here.
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  These are authoritarian gangsters.
[19:50.000 --> 19:54.000]  And that's why we have the guy that wants to be the vice president.
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  It's up on info wars.com.
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  We've got Mr. Cain coming after yours truly in another clip.
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.000]  We've got coming straight up.
[20:01.000 --> 20:02.000]  Stay with us.
[20:02.000 --> 20:05.000]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day.
[20:05.000 --> 20:12.000]  But growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[20:12.000 --> 20:16.000]  The solution is Defender Shield, the most effective mobile radiation shielding ever developed.

[20:35.000 --> 20:38.000]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon.
[20:38.000 --> 20:39.000]  Savory and delicious.
[20:39.000 --> 20:40.000]  I buy some.

[24:03.000 --> 24:14.000]  It is the 13th day of September, 2016, on this Tuesday edition.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  I'm Alan Schoen, your host.
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.000]  We're going to have to end the special tonight at midnight.
[24:20.000 --> 24:26.000]  That is 30-40% off the super high quality storeable food at infowarstore.com.
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.000]  It is privately labeled the very same food from my Patriot supply.
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  We have their full selection available as well.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  Already very, very, very high quality, very low price, made fresh last 25 years.
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  But by private labeling the very same food on the very same shopping cart, we're able to go 30-40% lower.
[24:43.000 --> 24:49.000]  Occasionally with sales, we're always about 5-15% lower depending on what specials they're running.
[24:49.000 --> 24:56.000]  But infowarstore.com or infowarselect.com, 30-40% off on high quality storeable foods.
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  Take advantage of that today and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  We're also going to end the special today with Hillary for Prison t-shirt at cost.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  $9.95, that includes shipping.
[25:07.000 --> 25:12.000]  The shirt costs us about $5.00, handling and shipping costs us about $5.00, hence the $9.95.
[25:12.000 --> 25:18.000]  There are two free Hillary's for Prison bumper stickers in each order and a citizen rule book.
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.000]  That's why I'm actually having to end the special because I'm actually losing money on it, not just breaking even.
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000]  They explained to me that when you sell tens of thousands of them, it becomes a big issue for our budget.
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  So the shirt will go back to $19.95 and then we're coming up with a new design in a couple weeks.
[25:33.000 --> 25:38.000]  That will be it for this design, this third permutation of the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  But thank you all for your support.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  You can pay $19.95 on the site.
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.000]  If you'd like, there's a button there where you can pay full price and we get $10 for each order of profit.
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  To help fund the operation or $10 to go to the company, to run the company, not I guess a profit.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  But the point is, it helps fund the operation.
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.000]  So thank you all for your support.
[25:57.000 --> 26:02.000]  And this is the dominant meme of this election cycle and it's having a devastating effect.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  We are the Info War.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  You are the heart of the Info War.
[26:06.000 --> 26:13.000]  Now, your phone calls, John, Brent, Steve, Andrew, Chris and others are coming up at the start of the next segment.
[26:13.000 --> 26:20.000]  We also have Hillary clearly on video being given a medical exam for neurological problems, for seizures, not for pneumonia.
[26:20.000 --> 26:26.000]  Drudge report is linked to that video and that report as well from infowars.com.
[26:26.000 --> 26:27.000]  That's coming up.
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  It's just an orgy of truth coming out.
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.000]  I mean, the dam has broken.
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  We are seeing historical things happen.
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  I'm going to stop right there.
[26:37.000 --> 26:45.000]  Obviously, the big issue that Trump's been hammering the last four or five days and not even letting her collapse distract him, though it's important,
[26:45.000 --> 26:51.000]  is that Hillary Clinton thinks that half of his supporters are deplorable, which ties into the bitter clinger.
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  She wants to be president, but she hates the American people.
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  Notice that Trump loves the American people and wants to bring us together.
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  But globalists have this imperial attitude.
[27:00.000 --> 27:06.000]  Here's Hillary talking about how she sees us as deplorable.
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  I'll go to the Trump clip, but here's the original clip of Hillary.
[27:10.000 --> 27:23.000]  You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.000]  Right?
[27:27.000 --> 27:35.000]  The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it.
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  And unfortunately, there are people like that.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  So we all know that's made up.
[27:42.000 --> 27:43.000]  That's exaggerated. That's spun.
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  The Democratic Party are the ones all about race, all about what group you are now.
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  They are despicable.
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  Their own memos have come out that Soros wants racial division to control us.
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  We have them.
[27:53.000 --> 28:02.000]  And Trump ought to run TV ads showing the DNC and the Soros and move on emails where they're coordinating all this crap and all this division.
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.000]  Now, let's go to Trump. He's been responding a lot, but here's one of his latest.
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  He says Hillary looks down on proud Americans as subjects for her rule.
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000]  And that's exactly what they want you to be poor under their control.
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  That is the heart of their clowered and pivot strategy.
[28:21.000 --> 28:27.000]  After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton has revealed her true thoughts.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  That was her true thoughts.
[28:29.000 --> 28:40.000]  She revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her rule.
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  She views it as her rule.
[28:43.000 --> 28:54.000]  Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led to violation of federal law as Secretary of State.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  Hide and delete her emails.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  Nobody's ever done anything like that before.
[28:59.000 --> 29:09.000]  Put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her foundation.
[29:09.000 --> 29:22.000]  It's the same attitude that explains why Hillary Clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disaster she helped to create in Iraq, in Syria, and in Libya.
[29:22.000 --> 29:34.000]  For this day, she won't take accountability for her role in unleashing, and that's what happened, unleashing ISIS.
[29:34.000 --> 29:38.000]  Total veritas. I'm just totally nodding my head here as he says all that.
[29:38.000 --> 29:44.000]  We have more of these clips coming up and your phone calls straight ahead on the other side, but he's a globalist.
[29:44.000 --> 29:50.000]  America stands in her way. Look, America's got plenty of problems, but it is one tenth as evil as globalism.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  And globalism is the anti-crime system.
[29:52.000 --> 29:55.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:55.000 --> 30:20.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:20.000 --> 30:29.000]  The Republican presidential candidate said that criticism of NBC's Matt Lauer following last week's candidate form in New York City is an effort to manipulate the presidential debates.
[30:29.000 --> 30:33.000]  The fact is, they are gaming the system, Trump said, of the criticism of Lauer.
[30:33.000 --> 30:38.000]  I think the system is being rigged, so it's going to be a very unfair debate.
[30:38.000 --> 30:50.000]  He also added, I can see it happening right now because everybody was saying he was soft on Trump, and now the new person is going to try and beat really hard on Trump just to show the establishment what he can do.
[30:50.000 --> 30:55.000]  Well, we don't know what's going to happen, but we do know that if Trump and Hillary get on stage together, it will be an annihilation.
[30:55.000 --> 31:02.000]  Trump will be victorious and have a landslide victory. You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.

[33:22.000 --> 33:31.000]  We just played a clip of saying Hillary looks down on proud Americans as subjects for her rule under globalism. That's what it is. It's the antichrist system.
[33:31.000 --> 33:38.000]  And here's another clip. Hillary Sustained for America disqualifies her to be president. Absolutely true. Here it is.
[33:38.000 --> 33:50.000]  The disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed toward millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service.
[33:50.000 --> 34:00.000]  You cannot run for president if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter. And she does.
[34:00.000 --> 34:07.000]  You can't lead this nation if you have such a low opinion for its citizens.
[34:07.000 --> 34:17.000]  Hillary Clinton still hasn't apologized to those she slandered. In fact, she hasn't backed down at all.
[34:17.000 --> 34:32.000]  She's doubled down on her campaign conspiracy and contempt. If Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, I don't see how she can credibly campaign any further.
[34:32.000 --> 34:50.000]  Let's be clear. These were not offhand comments from Hillary Clinton. These were strikes not at all. They were given also in an interview and probably a number of interviews.
[34:50.000 --> 35:06.000]  These were lengthy, planned and prepared remarks. It was perhaps the most explicit attack on the American voter ever spoken by a major party presidential nominee.
[35:06.000 --> 35:16.000]  Total disrespect for the people of our country. Clinton was using a very deliberate page from the Democratic playbook.
[35:16.000 --> 35:32.000]  She's smearing someone with one of the names, you know, those names in order to scare. And I mean, try and seriously scare them out of voting for change.
[35:32.000 --> 35:37.000]  And we're bringing change. She can't bring change. She's been doing this for 35 years.
[35:37.000 --> 35:49.000]  She's the opposite of change. Total veritas. And that's why I'm very careful when we play our own investigative reports around the country, or Mark Dice, who contributes for us out in Southern California,
[35:49.000 --> 36:01.000]  that we show people saying, let's put gun owners and conservatives in forced labor camps and take their guns, or let's kill gun owners, or let's abort kids up to age three,
[36:01.000 --> 36:11.000]  or we don't know who the vice president is. I say specifically these people are brainwashed. Totally stupid. Because we have video of them.
[36:11.000 --> 36:21.000]  I don't just say in general, all the Democrats are racist or all the Democrats are bad people. A lot of them actually mean well and have just been basically put into a cult.
[36:21.000 --> 36:31.000]  But to come out and say specifically, half of Trump supporters are racist, homophobes, Islamophobes, blah, blah, blah, is just amazing.
[36:31.000 --> 36:40.000]  It's total divide and conquer. And she's trying to get her minions to basically be sicked on everybody else. This is how you divide a country.
[36:40.000 --> 36:48.000]  And Trump is actually unifying it. The first thing you need to do is say, look, but citizens get treated the best up front.
[36:48.000 --> 36:57.000]  We're not against anybody, but you've got to earn that. And they said, oh, this is racist. This is horrible. You can't go to any of those other countries and get that treatment.
[36:57.000 --> 37:04.000]  They'd laugh at you. We're a nation state. Globalism is erasing that.
[37:04.000 --> 37:10.000]  And then Trump goes further and says, I'm going to make it easier if people become citizens. It's too hard. It's stupid.
[37:10.000 --> 37:18.000]  Because the Democrats don't want people here legally that have all the right benefits but also pay the taxes because they want to drive the wages down.
[37:18.000 --> 37:24.000]  And so does the Republican leadership. They might even be worse than the Democrats long term on wanting to have a permanent underclass.
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  So you know what? One thing the Democrats say to their constituents is true.
[37:28.000 --> 37:36.000]  A lot of these third world populations that are brought in from all over Eastern Europe, super hardworking folks, Latin America, super hardworking folks on average, they are being exploited.
[37:36.000 --> 37:42.000]  Let's not miss words. They are being set up as a permanent underclass.
[37:42.000 --> 37:54.000]  And the latter is being removed where it's very hard for them to become middle class because the globalists don't want a big middle class that's hard to manage by the elite, a big uppity middle class.
[37:54.000 --> 38:01.000]  The number one enemy of the ultra rich is Nouveau-Riche, the new rich.
[38:01.000 --> 38:11.000]  Learn about it. America is all about the new rich and the globalists hate the new rich. They have a disdain for us.
[38:11.000 --> 38:22.000]  Okay? They do not want you to be wealthy and we are wealthy. Folks, you got a couple of vacations a year, nice car, little three bedroom house and a little swimming pool in the backyard in jacuzzi.
[38:22.000 --> 38:31.000]  You're rich compared to any of our ancestors. We are all fabulously wealthy on average unless we have a mental or physical disability.
[38:31.000 --> 38:37.000]  And then there's some really bad, nasty areas in this country that are based on crime and are just horrible. And we should fix those areas.
[38:37.000 --> 38:47.000]  But the point is that this running down the American system, the globalists know they're in competition with it. They know they can't compete with it and they want to destroy it.
[38:47.000 --> 38:57.000]  And they love the fact that Americans hold less passports than any other first world nation. And so the average American that I hear bitching and complaining about this country,
[38:57.000 --> 39:04.000]  they've not been to Central America or South America like I have. They've not been to Eastern Europe. They've not been to third world countries.
[39:04.000 --> 39:12.000]  They've not been to Africa because believe me, they would shut their moron mouth real fast, real fast.
[39:12.000 --> 39:20.000]  You go to Mexico City, you're going to stop bitching about this country real fast. You go to areas in Honduras.
[39:20.000 --> 39:35.000]  My dad's gone and done all these medical charity deals in the middle of South America. Unbelievable, unbelievable poverty, unbelievable violence, unbelievable just out of control behavior.
[39:35.000 --> 39:47.000]  And down there, some of the only people producing food and holding up the civilization of the Amish and all over South America, governments are trying to rob the Amish and take over their property and not even let them operate.
[39:47.000 --> 39:58.000]  It is just so incredibly sad that we've reached this point. And the average American has no idea what's even going on on this planet right now. Zero.
[39:58.000 --> 40:08.000]  And Hillary Clinton hopes that continues. Now, I'm going to go to your phone calls right now. The toll-free number to join us is 800-25-99-231.
[40:08.000 --> 40:14.000]  The lines are full, but when somebody hangs up, that's your chance. I'd love for first-time callers to call in or people haven't called in a while to give you a chance.
[40:14.000 --> 40:21.000]  And we're specifically on a topic of the election. It's a big area, but it's front and center, a global election.
[40:21.000 --> 40:38.000]  One of the most important, some are saying the most important in history between globalism and populism, nationalism and world government, global corporate, neocolonialism and a return to the nation state, which creates so much freedom and so much wealth under a renaissance system.
[40:38.000 --> 40:48.000]  There is no choice if you know history, but that's why they don't want us to know history, so we're doomed to repeat the fraudulent history that they're foisting on us.
[40:48.000 --> 41:00.000]  And then coming up, Tim Kaine, it goes on a full damage control, attacking yours truly yesterday, the vice presidential candidate, and says that there's no room for free speech in America for the alt-right.
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.000]  Buddy, I'm the liberal, and you know it.
[41:04.000 --> 41:11.000]  Thomas Jefferson would look at me and say, Patriot, liberal. He'd look at you and say, Tyranus, just like that.
[41:11.000 --> 41:20.000]  The founder of your party would turn his face from you in about half a second. We're going to get into all this talk of Hillary dropping out of the race.
[41:20.000 --> 41:29.000]  I'm not saying that's happening. That's being discussed in mainstream media. We told you about it early on because Democrats were tweeting that they were already meeting in D.C. discussing this.
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  Now it's in everything from the Daily Mail to the New York Times. I'll go over that.
[41:33.000 --> 41:45.000]  We've got a really important report I haven't gotten to yet that's agenda 21 and agenda 2030 invades Austin, Texas from John Bowne. We've got Hillary having a medical exam done to her for neurological problems right before she collapsed.
[41:45.000 --> 41:51.000]  Of course it's not pneumonia. She's had this falling down for years, folks. She's lying, open and shut.
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  But I want to play one more clip before we go to your calls.
[41:54.000 --> 42:04.000]  This is maybe two. This is a clip by Stephanie Cutter again on MSNBC.
[42:04.000 --> 42:13.000]  And they are talking about how all of Trump's people are deplorable.
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.000]  All of you are bad. All of you are evil. All of you are racist. All of you are horrible.
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.000]  Because you don't like Hillary Clinton selling us out to the Saudi Arabians and funding radicals.
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.000]  You're hottest and serving the Chinese president. It's come out in the emails. You pay her money and then she gives you access to Chinese president.
[42:30.000 --> 42:38.000]  She should be arrested immediately. There should be federal SWAT teams ramming down her door now, months ago.
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  I mean, this is the most flagrant naked treason. It's ridiculous.
[42:44.000 --> 42:50.000]  And it's just crediting our country. It's not our country doing this. It's the globalist.
[42:50.000 --> 42:57.000]  In fact, we have a mash-up of this. Let me just play this. This is Kane, attacking her truly. Hillary attacking me a few weeks ago.
[42:57.000 --> 43:03.000]  But Kane's yesterday tied into these very same people, talking about how despicable and deplorable we are.
[43:03.000 --> 43:09.000]  And then I've got one more clip of Alex Witt, again, only showing Hillary stumble, not fall down and be drugging of the car,
[43:09.000 --> 43:17.000]  and saying, C, the conspiracy theorist are lying. They say she fell down. She didn't. Deceiving her viewers savagely.
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  I mean, if I did something like this, I would expect to have no listeners in one day.
[43:21.000 --> 43:27.000]  I mean, this is lying to you at a level, hoping you're so stupid you don't go see the full clip.
[43:27.000 --> 43:32.000]  It's the same liar that says that I'm, quote, deeply racist.
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.000]  And you look at these bug-eyed, narcissistic-looking nutwomen. I mean, these people look like crazy people out of a movie.
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.000]  So let's play this mash-up, number one, right to your calls.
[43:42.000 --> 43:48.000]  When David Duke is doing robo calls saying vote for Donald Trump and others,
[43:48.000 --> 43:52.000]  who are kind of at the very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones,
[43:52.000 --> 43:58.000]  are being kind of incorporated into the campaign in ways it's a, or even the recent choice.
[43:58.000 --> 44:05.000]  All right, pause. Start it over. I've got to respond to this.
[44:05.000 --> 44:15.000]  Notice how he just segued that David Duke and quote Alex Jones are being incorporated into the campaign.
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.000]  It's true I've been incorporated into the campaign because I'm a patriot. I'm telling the truth.
[44:19.000 --> 44:24.000]  David Duke has it.
[44:24.000 --> 44:29.000]  That is pure bull, and you know it. Again, deception, twisting, spinning, mixing truth with lies.
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  Let's go back to this little slimy CIA pimp.
[44:32.000 --> 44:37.000]  When David Duke is doing robo calls saying vote for Donald Trump and others,
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.000]  who are kind of at the very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones,
[44:42.000 --> 44:49.000]  are being kind of incorporated into the campaign in ways it's a, or even the recent choices of campaign management.
[44:49.000 --> 44:53.000]  This is something that is really important, and I think we do need to call it out.
[44:53.000 --> 44:57.000]  They said in October I'd be dead in six months.
[44:57.000 --> 45:02.000]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones,
[45:02.000 --> 45:08.000]  who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[45:08.000 --> 45:16.000]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.000]  To say things like that.
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.000]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[45:22.000 --> 45:28.000]  You can put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
[45:28.000 --> 45:35.000]  Right?
[45:35.000 --> 45:42.000]  The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it.
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  Do you think it's tough to defend the remarked deplorables to do that?
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  Absolutely not.
[45:47.000 --> 45:52.000]  I think that her only mistake is that she said half of his supporters were deplorable.
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.000]  Does anybody around this table have they not seen Trump's rallies?
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  Have they not seen Trump's own remarks?
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  What she said was not wrong.
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  Her only mistake was that she described half of his supporters that way.
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.000]  These sycophants will defend their queen to the end.
[46:07.000 --> 46:16.000]  Every major channel of mainstream news is only showing her stumble and then not collapse and fall over and be drugging the vehicle.
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.000]  And the Secret Service told us, they said, look, just go to her events, be outside, be at the back.
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  You hang around enough, you're going to see what's happening.
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  We're not going to tell you, just show up.
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  Just show up to the vehicles that have got the special ramps to get her in.
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  You'll see what we're talking about.
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  He told you that a month ago, she's fallen down.
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  They said, we don't know what she's got.
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  We think it's Parkinson's brain tumor.
[46:40.000 --> 46:41.000]  She's fallen down.
[46:41.000 --> 46:42.000]  It's getting worse.
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  There's going to be a big announcement.
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  What's happening a month later?
[46:46.000 --> 46:52.000]  I mean, we have the sources.
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.000]  And the New York Post, Drudge has the cover, calls it illery.
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  She skipped ER to dodge the media.
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.000]  Health crisis and secrecy, worry allies.
[47:01.000 --> 47:03.000]  Their meeting decided what to do.
[47:03.000 --> 47:06.000]  She could step down.
[47:06.000 --> 47:09.000]  Oh, we're wrong again.
[47:09.000 --> 47:11.000]  We told you, fluoride lowered IQ.
[47:11.000 --> 47:14.000]  We went out three years ago with 25 studies and said, take it out.
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  It's brain damaging people lower in IQ.
[47:16.000 --> 47:19.000]  Oh, we told you that Saudi Arabia worked with criminals in our government
[47:19.000 --> 47:21.000]  for a standout on 9-11.
[47:21.000 --> 47:23.000]  It's all now been declassified.
[47:23.000 --> 47:24.000]  28 pages.
[47:24.000 --> 47:25.000]  Told you so.
[47:25.000 --> 47:26.000]  On and on and on.
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  We told you they were going to try to come in and federalize the election.
[47:29.000 --> 47:34.000]  Month before it happened, boom, it's happened.
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  Because we're not yes men here.
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  Tell them to play one more clip and then go to Mesmer, John, Steve, Andrew and Chris and others.
[47:40.000 --> 47:45.000]  This is the clip I was mentioning of Alex Witt or Alex Twitt.
[47:45.000 --> 47:48.000]  And again, if you're a radio listener, I'll describe it.
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  She shows the first three or four seconds of Hillary kind of wobbling.
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.000]  Looks like she stumbles.
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.000]  Not the next 10 or 15 where she falls down and is drugged into the vehicle.
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  I mean, this is the biggest deception ever.
[47:57.000 --> 48:02.000]  Be like, oh, Dale Earnhardt only hit a pothole and his wheel didn't even come off.
[48:02.000 --> 48:07.000]  Meanwhile, he crashes and, you know, dies or sinna.
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  Oh, sinna, you know, when he died down in the race in Brazil or whatever it was, the
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  famous Formula One driver, he just kind of hit a bump and he wasn't even hurt.
[48:15.000 --> 48:20.000]  No, sinna, you know, blew up and died.
[48:20.000 --> 48:26.000]  I mean, it's like saying the challenger didn't blow up over Florida.
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  Well, everybody knows the challenger didn't blow up like Alex Jones is saying.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  No, the challenger just had a little leak and it got into space and got back down to
[48:35.000 --> 48:36.000]  earth.
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  Launching and go, see, there's a challenger, kids.
[48:38.000 --> 48:39.000]  Challenger's fine.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  It's North Korea level BS.
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  The challenger blew up.
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  It's boosters blew up.
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  OK, Hillary Clinton fell on her face and they had to drag her into a vehicle.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  She had a freaking seizure.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  But this woman sits in every other damn channel.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  Excuse me, God, I promise I'm going to stop doing this family show.
[48:59.000 --> 49:00.000]  I just get so angry.
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.000]  They sit there and they lie to you to your face thinking you don't know how to go find
[49:05.000 --> 49:10.000]  the full clip or thinking you're so used to being lied to that they won't be held
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  accountable.
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  You have been held accountable.
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.000]  You have no viewers.
[49:13.000 --> 49:19.000]  You're a pack of of harpies up there regurgitating lies into each other's nest.
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.000]  Let's let's play the clip.
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.000]  Here it is.
[49:21.000 --> 49:25.000]  What we will see here now is her getting into the car.
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  She was a little bit unstable there and she was a little bit wildly.
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  That's I think an appropriate word to use.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  You can see right there.
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.000]  You know, by the way, I should have mentioned Michael Savage is scheduled to come on the
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  day.
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  I'm very excited about that.
[49:39.000 --> 49:42.000]  And we also have a bunch of the big guests.
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  But again, she just cuts the clip.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.000]  I'm skipping this breaks.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  We have more time.
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  But let's play that clip one more time because I want to take all the clips of the news doing
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  this saying, look, she didn't fall down like these people are saying.
[49:54.000 --> 49:55.000]  I've seen that.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  She's just had a little stumble.
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  See an incident.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  She just stumbled.
[49:59.000 --> 50:00.000]  OK, let me see.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  She stumbled.
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  Big deal.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  Poor.
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.000]  She says Christ sexism quote can't a girl have a sick day or two.
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  Can't a girl like you go and launch fake wars in the Balkans and set up those people and
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.000]  kill tens of thousands of them.
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.000]  I mean, you're a monster.
[50:14.000 --> 50:15.000]  I'm on poor.
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  You state department husband.
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.000]  You work for Hillary.
[50:18.000 --> 50:19.000]  You are a monster.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  But I'm on poor says can't a girl have a sick day.
[50:22.000 --> 50:27.000]  And the Huffington Post says that we need to have an apology from the media for even covering
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  our interests.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  Talk about delusional.
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  Let's play it one more time.
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.000]  What we will see here now is her getting into the car.
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  She was a little bit unstable there.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  And she was a little bit wobbly.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  That's, I think, an appropriate word to you.
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  She could be right there.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  These people look at the arrogance of that woman.
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  These people had put us in a FEMA camp at a minute.
[50:49.000 --> 50:57.000]  These are the most immoral, evil, just absolutely deceptive monsters you could ever see.
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  They know, and on every channel, they're doing it.
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  They cut before she falls flat on her fricking face.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  I mean, these people are the enemy.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  They've declared us the enemy.
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  No, which you are.
[51:09.000 --> 51:13.000]  What type of country do you think you're going to live in where they got the media lined up
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  to lie about everything?
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  You feel safe in a country like that without a watchdog?
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  Oh, but you're part of the power structure.
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.000]  I get it.
[51:20.000 --> 51:21.000]  Okay.
[51:21.000 --> 51:22.000]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[51:22.000 --> 51:23.000]  I want to thank Mesmer.
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  I guess we're going to mesmerize us.
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  You've got Steve Andrew, Chris many others for calling in.
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  Mesmer in Maryland.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  That's the state where she was for a year, having her secret of brain surgeries.
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.000]  Mesmer, what's on your mind today?
[51:36.000 --> 51:37.000]  Good morning, Alex.
[51:37.000 --> 51:38.000]  How are you today?
[51:38.000 --> 51:39.000]  I'm pretty good.
[51:39.000 --> 51:40.000]  Go ahead.
[51:40.000 --> 51:41.000]  Welcome.
[51:41.000 --> 51:47.000]  I have a degree in science, biological, neurological, psychological.
[51:47.000 --> 51:56.000]  When you guys were talking about the fact that Hillary had had surgery here in Maryland,
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  one of the most foremost Johns Hopkins, one of the most foremost neurological facilities
[52:00.000 --> 52:09.000]  in the world, I really started to think about that and take a very close look at the behaviorisms
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  that she was exhibiting.
[52:11.000 --> 52:16.000]  I dug back into the APA, American Psychological Association's websites, and I started doing
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  some research on brain tumors.
[52:18.000 --> 52:30.000]  What I found is that the major symptoms of brain tumor is that the organs start to shut
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  down.
[52:31.000 --> 52:39.000]  What you're seeing in this multiple myriad of symptoms, people saying, oh, she's got
[52:39.000 --> 52:45.000]  this, she's got that, it's Alzheimer's, it's actually all of the above.
[52:45.000 --> 52:52.000]  Because the symptoms of brain tumor are the organs shutting down, and grand mal seizures,
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  congestive heart failure, incontinence, et cetera.
[52:56.000 --> 53:00.000]  She's this coughing that suggests.
[53:00.000 --> 53:01.000]  Everything's shutting down.
[53:01.000 --> 53:05.720]  That's what Dr. Pechenick, who actually had doctors that run these facilities work for
[53:05.720 --> 53:08.920]  him, he's obviously not going to give out medical information, he's not going to give
[53:08.920 --> 53:14.440]  out private info, but his information is, and he's always been dead on, Hillary has
[53:14.440 --> 53:20.560]  a brain tumor and a lung tumor, it's metastasized, she is not long for this world, and I have
[53:20.560 --> 53:25.200]  that from other sources that say just the symptoms and what she's on is it points towards
[53:25.200 --> 53:28.080]  brain tumor, not blood clots.
[53:28.080 --> 53:31.520]  And the fact that she's falling down and it's getting worse, that's what starts happening
[53:31.520 --> 53:35.680]  with the brain tumor is that it's worse and worse, so you lose neurological control.
[53:35.680 --> 53:41.840]  And that's what the Secret Service told us, is that she's falling down every 30, 40 minutes,
[53:41.840 --> 53:42.840]  every hour.
[53:42.840 --> 53:43.840]  It's bad.
[53:43.840 --> 53:45.320]  It's bad shape, brother.
[53:45.320 --> 53:50.840]  Yeah, that is classic brain tumor symptoms.
[53:50.840 --> 53:56.840]  Also your brainwashing analysis is dead on as well.
[53:56.840 --> 54:02.040]  I noticed that you go into your family history quite a bit and mine's kind of colored as
[54:02.040 --> 54:03.040]  well.
[54:03.040 --> 54:10.280]  I'm the descendant of Franz Anton Mesmer, the man who invented hypnotism, basically.
[54:10.280 --> 54:11.280]  That's amazing.
[54:11.280 --> 54:14.520]  He sent me the proof that I'd like to have you on as a guest sometime, but let me just
[54:14.520 --> 54:15.520]  expand on this briefly.
[54:15.520 --> 54:16.520]  Here's why I'm saying this.
[54:16.520 --> 54:21.440]  They have this large black man that follows her around everywhere so he can pick her up.
[54:21.440 --> 54:24.560]  We saw that again on Sunday, which we predicted.
[54:24.560 --> 54:26.880]  He has the epipen, four seizures.
[54:26.880 --> 54:30.200]  He's always at her side and when she starts looking like she's going out of reality, he
[54:30.200 --> 54:33.960]  comes up and tells her everything's okay and she snaps back in.
[54:33.960 --> 54:35.720]  That's why I'm saying it's like mind control.
[54:35.720 --> 54:39.480]  I'm not saying she's literally under mind control, but that's why she had an earpiece,
[54:39.480 --> 54:42.080]  and I talk to some insiders, they say that she does wear one.
[54:42.080 --> 54:46.960]  It's in the e-mails, it's in the WikiLeaks, that they're doing all of this Mesmer because
[54:46.960 --> 54:50.240]  she is losing cognitive ability and is coming in and out.
[54:50.240 --> 54:52.040]  Sorry, go ahead.
[54:52.040 --> 54:53.040]  People under high...
[54:53.040 --> 54:58.840]  One of the things that's required for what you would call brainwashing is high levels
[54:58.840 --> 55:05.520]  of stress and it makes a person very susceptible to suggestion, especially someone who doesn't
[55:05.520 --> 55:09.760]  feel bad, but that's what bootcamp is, is by the 6th or 8th or 10th or 12th week, is
[55:09.760 --> 55:14.760]  you actually get into a brainwashed mode for it to be highly suggestible to be programmed.
[55:14.760 --> 55:17.440]  Real brainwashing just takes that 10 times harder.
[55:17.440 --> 55:18.440]  Right.
[55:18.440 --> 55:19.440]  Well, they take you...
[55:19.440 --> 55:22.360]  They say flat out right at the beginning, we're going to break you at the beginning
[55:22.360 --> 55:23.360]  of bootcamp.
[55:23.360 --> 55:27.160]  I went through bootcamp at Fort Jackson, Mississippi back in the 80s.
[55:27.160 --> 55:30.640]  I completely understand exactly what goes on there.
[55:30.640 --> 55:36.240]  Yes, it's... they put you under a high stress situation so that they can break down your
[55:36.240 --> 55:43.880]  resistance and basically reprogram you to be the person that they need.
[55:43.880 --> 55:50.200]  All government sanctioned, but yeah, this all came out back in the mid 1800s over in
[55:50.200 --> 55:53.880]  Europe and they castigated...
[55:53.880 --> 55:54.880]  Absolutely.
[55:54.880 --> 55:56.440]  That was the Germans invented most of that.
[55:56.440 --> 55:57.440]  Great points, God bless you.
[55:57.440 --> 55:59.040]  Yeah, Mesmer, send me some info.
[55:59.040 --> 56:00.040]  I'm sure that's true.
[56:00.040 --> 56:01.040]  Sounds very interesting.
[56:01.040 --> 56:02.040]  I'd like to have you on as a guest.
[56:02.040 --> 56:03.040]  I'm going to talk about your ancestors.
[56:03.040 --> 56:04.040]  Very, very interesting.
[56:04.040 --> 56:09.160]  But that... listen, all I know is Hillary looks like she's a crazy bag lady part of
[56:09.160 --> 56:10.160]  the time.
[56:10.160 --> 56:13.680]  Then she kind of looks like her old self a little bit and then she's clearly drugged
[56:13.680 --> 56:14.960]  up so she's not having seizures.
[56:14.960 --> 56:17.960]  They've got to get her off the drugs partially to get her out in public.
[56:17.960 --> 56:19.760]  So she then has the seizures.
[56:19.760 --> 56:21.400]  It's deteriorating quickly.
[56:21.400 --> 56:25.840]  She was in a facility for a year that specializes in brain tumors and most of his brain tumors
[56:25.840 --> 56:29.640]  come back, boys and girls, a little too much time on the cell phone.
[56:29.640 --> 56:30.640]  I'm in Texas.
[56:30.640 --> 56:32.640]  Thanks for holding her on the air worldwide, Steve.
[56:32.640 --> 56:35.440]  Oh, it's short and sweet.
[56:35.440 --> 56:37.840]  Alex, sharing the truth woke me up.
[56:37.840 --> 56:41.600]  I'm 62 and I take all the products and I feel like I'm 40 again.
[56:41.600 --> 56:42.600]  I love it.
[56:42.600 --> 56:43.600]  Thanks for the support.
[56:43.600 --> 56:47.640]  Hillary is actually... Hillary is actually Satan's first lady.
[56:47.640 --> 56:51.840]  And every word she says is the opposite of the truth.
[56:51.840 --> 56:59.080]  May God's force be with you, us, we, the people, are yelling for justice through John... through
[56:59.080 --> 57:00.080]  Donald Trump.
[57:00.080 --> 57:01.080]  Thanks, Alex.
[57:01.080 --> 57:02.080]  Absolutely.
[57:02.080 --> 57:03.080]  God bless you.
[57:03.080 --> 57:05.680]  I'm really excited about getting Michael Sabajon coming up here in just a few minutes.
[57:05.680 --> 57:08.000]  We'll take some more calls and then get Michael Sabajon.
[57:08.000 --> 57:11.360]  Again, Michael Sabaj does not do a lot of interviews.
[57:11.360 --> 57:12.880]  We're always honored to have him on.
[57:12.880 --> 57:18.000]  He's one of the few talk show hosts that is an egomaniac who has other hosts on.
[57:18.000 --> 57:19.000]  He's had me on many times.
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.800]  He's had our crew on many times.
[57:20.800 --> 57:22.800]  He really does care about the country.
[57:22.800 --> 57:25.360]  I agree with about 95% of what Sabaj stands for.
[57:25.360 --> 57:26.800]  I'm sure he's the same way back at me.
[57:26.800 --> 57:31.720]  But this is somebody who is highly dedicated to finding the new world order and always brings
[57:31.720 --> 57:35.600]  up a lot of profound angles and important information.
[57:35.600 --> 57:37.280]  So he's coming up.
[57:37.280 --> 57:41.600]  He's got the new book out and he also, of course, writes for WorldNet Daily.
[57:41.600 --> 57:48.720]  Michael Sabaj, we're number one bad election away from losing America.
[57:48.720 --> 57:52.280]  We're one bad election away from losing America.
[57:52.280 --> 57:58.560]  What is coming up and scorched earth restoring the country after Obama is the name of the
[57:58.560 --> 57:59.560]  book.
[57:59.560 --> 58:02.000]  And I've got mine being overnighted as we speak.
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.920]  It's supposed to arrive today and it's funny.
[58:04.920 --> 58:08.360]  Before I even knew the name of his new book, about a month ago I was here at the office
[58:08.360 --> 58:13.320]  telling the crew, and then I was also telling family just this weekend, I said, it's time
[58:13.320 --> 58:14.920]  for scorched earth people.
[58:14.920 --> 58:16.120]  They're not playing games with us.
[58:16.120 --> 58:17.480]  We're not playing games with them.
[58:17.480 --> 58:18.760]  It's time to take the gloves off.
[58:18.760 --> 58:20.320]  I don't mean physically.
[58:20.320 --> 58:26.360]  The person that strikes first physically is not going to lose, but is at a major disadvantage.
[58:26.360 --> 58:27.880]  We are winning the Info War.
[58:27.880 --> 58:32.520]  We need to intensify that operation, but like our lives depend on it.
[58:32.520 --> 58:37.680]  You can feel the spirit in the air, the electricity of evil and good clashing.
[58:37.680 --> 58:41.120]  This is an historic time and I'm so blessed to be alive.
[58:41.120 --> 58:42.120]  We'll be back.
[58:42.120 --> 58:43.120]  Thank you for joining us.
[58:43.120 --> 58:47.120]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:47.120 --> 58:52.120]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:17.120 --> 59:22.120]  Welcome back to GCNLive.
[59:47.120 --> 59:54.120]  Welcome back to GCNLive.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:32.800]  I was saying that the book was being overnighted, it just arrived in the mail, just arrived
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.800]  via FedEx.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.800]  Boom!
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.760]  They're in the break and I just had two minutes to read, because I love history.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:43.120]  I can't wait to read this new book, Scorched Earth, Restoring the Country After Obama.
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.920]  I opened to a page about Edmund Burke supporting the British Empire, but not supporting the
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:54.120]  Empire erasing country's cultures, which globalism is doing and he's so sophisticated, he's
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:59.120]  probably the smartest talk show host out there when it comes to wide-ranging knowledge.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.520]  George Norris is really smart as well.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:08.160]  When it comes to passion and taking the globalist on and being well-read, I'm right up there
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.120]  with Savage, but Savage really is a smart guy.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.560]  I put it to you this way, I don't learn a lot of stuff from other people on radio.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.680]  They just take a couple topics, repeat it over and over again, take phone calls.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.520]  They don't even want to be there, they don't even want to be on air, they don't care, they
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.520]  just want money.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.720]  Savage doesn't even need to be on air, he's a very successful person and that's why I
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.320]  admire what he's doing and his plan, and I've been listening to the show, he's been talking
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.600]  about Scorched Earth, I haven't read it yet, he's an excellent one to take back this country
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.600]  and this world.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:36.560]  So Michael Savage joining us at the start of the next segment, in fact there he is, he
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.960]  just came and sat down there, so we're going to come back right after this break and go
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.140]  to Michael Savage.
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:46.440]  First off, let's jam another phone call in here, who is up next?
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:52.160]  Let's go ahead and take a call here from Chris in Virginia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:58.800]  Alright, with Hillary falling and coughing and stumbling all over the place, I can't
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:04.400]  help but think to what Larry Nichols was saying about her trying to use that as sympathy
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.600]  points for the debates, what do you think about that?
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:11.160]  You know a lot of people said months ago, look out Hillary could be trying to get sympathy,
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.120]  she could play on this poor little her, the problem is the media lied about it, she lied
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.080]  about it, she's clearly really sick, okay, I mean this is not fake, she could try to
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:25.640]  spin that now and use that crisis, but I think, I don't think Hillary's long for this world,
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:30.280]  the word we've got from insiders is brain tumor was cut out in 2012, brain tumor is
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:35.200]  back and is growing, but regardless the media only shows her being a little bit dizzy, they
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:39.800]  don't show her falling on her face, so what this is really about is discrediting the media,
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.800]  what do you think?
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.320]  I think it is about discrediting the media and also I think that they're trying to put
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.120]  it out there with the pneumonia thing, even though it's a fake and it's a lie, if they
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:53.720]  put it out there now before the debates it gives them some kind of credibility going
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.800]  in there saying that oh, she was had pneumonia, oh she was sick.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.920]  Well, I totally agree with you that this whole thing about the pneumonia is bull, I mean
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.000]  she hasn't had coughing fits for years from pneumonia, she hasn't been fainting and falling
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.680]  down having blood clots from pneumonia, first she said on Sunday that it was just hot out
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.400]  there and she said oh, I was diagnosed with pneumonia, she didn't go to the hospital,
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.760]  she went to Chelsea's $10 million pad, she had $6 million a year from the Clinton Foundation
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:23.760]  swindle, so she could quote then walk out and hug the little girl behind the police
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:29.760]  line, the secret service line, it doesn't get more staged in Pyongyang, North Korea.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.040]  Thanks for the call, Chris. Now we're going to go to John and Mike and Jennifer and Andrew
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.760]  and a lot of other folks, if you want to hold, if not you can hang up, I'll give the numbers
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.840]  out again later, after Michael Savage leaves us at the bottom of the hour, we're going
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:46.640]  to go to break and come back with Michael Savage and talk about currently what's happening,
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:50.920]  the dirty tricks he thinks they're going to play and how we counter them and then how
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:55.400]  we would restore this country if Donald J. Trump gets in.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:03.360]  So when you talk about deplorables, I've been attacked by name, I know that the vice presidential
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.440]  candidate attacked me again and said I'm one of the top deplorables, but I tell you, we're
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:11.880]  talking to maybe the king deplorable when we come back, according to the globalists,
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:16.280]  the leftists, the scum, the communists, the socialists, the New World Order people, because
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:20.840]  Michael Savage has been one of the chief thorns in their side for decades, so we're going
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:25.880]  to ask one of the top deplorables where he thinks this is going and how we defeat them
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880]  straight ahead.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:32.480]  The book that's just now coming out is Scorched Earth, bestowing the country after Obama,
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:38.720]  Michael Savage, number one New York Times bestseller, and you can go to michaelsavage.wnd.com,
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:46.480]  it will also give you his website on the other side, michaelsavage.com, the home of the Savage
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:52.560]  nation, borders, language, culture, all this and more, Scorched Earth, now available, I'm
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:05:02.400]  Alex Jones, this is The Info War, you can find us at infowars.com.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:07.160]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com, article up at Politico, former DNC chairman calls for
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:12.000]  Clinton contingency plan, it's extremely unlikely Democrats will have to change the ticket,
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.240]  but even some Clinton allies say there should be a clear process, a former DNC chairman
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:21.680]  says President Barack Obama and the party's congressional leaders should immediately identify
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:26.040]  a potential successor candidate for Hillary Clinton for the off chance a health emergency
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.800]  forces her out of the race, now is the time for all good political leaders to come to
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:36.440]  the aid of their party, so Don Fowler, who helmed the DNC from 95 to 97, Fowler said
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:40.800]  he expects Clinton to fully recover from her bout with pneumonia, which forced her to leave
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:46.000]  September 11th memorial event when she fell to her face at free fall speeds, much like
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.760]  building seven during 9-11, he added a note of caution should Clinton attempt an expeditious
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.560]  return to the campaign trail, she better get well before she gets back out there because
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.960]  if she gets back out there too soon, it might happen again, you can find more reports like
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.960]  this at infowars.com.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:07.560]  We're selling a product, DNA force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:12.800]  produce, you took years for you to develop DNA force for us, it's been something that
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:17.480]  I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important,
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:24.120]  what the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres,
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:27.680]  telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes, and when it runs out, you
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:33.080]  start dying, we chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials, it's one
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:37.840]  of the most effective substances in the world, it works like an antioxidant, it works to
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:43.440]  repair nerve growth factor, so this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount, it's
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:49.120]  in powder form, we have so many five star reviews, I take this, this is the product
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.760]  that I take, infowarslife.com and the profit we make, we fight the globals, we fight the

[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:07.640]  Brain force, it's completely different, try a bottle of it, Rob do, joins us, you worked
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.880]  I guess like 20 plus hours, tell us what brain force did.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.200]  I had been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball, I get in here
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.440]  at 8.30, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.960]  it, and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview, I got my bottle of brain force
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:26.920]  right there, I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.600]  just kind of clears up, it's got four and a half stars, people really love it, read
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.240]  about it, find out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.320]  really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:44.120]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:49.080]  done it without brain force, I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep,
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.600]  got up, took two more brain force and came in.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:08:02.160]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:29.360]  Well, I gotta tell you, there's probably three people in the last few decades that have been
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:33.320]  on the front lines of fighting globalism and getting made fun of it.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:36.720]  That's Michael Savage, Alex Jones and Matt Drudge, and I guess we're all here today because
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:41.520]  I'm told he just talked to Drudge and Drudge is tuned in right now, scorched earth, restoring
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.040]  the country after Obama, Michael Savage, very powerful book, just caught us today, been
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.680]  thumbing through it, I'm a big history buff, cannot wait to read this book, we need to
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:55.800]  make this number one on the New York Times bestseller list, it is a manifesto against
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:00.360]  the globalists that have literally taken this country and Europe over, Brexit is only the
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:05.840]  beginning, the globalists are panicking and every major publication they run, the Economist,
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:11.440]  the New York Times, the Washington Post saying that if Trump defeats Hillary, the New World
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:14.040]  Order is basically broke back.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:20.080]  So we are in the title match of history, everyone should go to bookstores to make this the number
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:26.040]  one book, buy it in bookstores everywhere, today, scorched earth, this is the front lines
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:31.320]  of the info war, joining us for the next 20 minutes or so is Michael Savage of the Savage
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:36.880]  Nation, one of the top radio shows in the country, New York Times bestselling author,
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:41.200]  you've got the floor my friend, let's talk about where we are, what we're facing, two
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.680]  minutes to midnight.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.160]  Well number one, you are really the field marshal of it all, Alex, come on, we know
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.520]  that they're more afraid of you and info wars than almost anyone else in the media, I mean
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:58.440]  you, Matt Trudge, there aren't too many left, that's what's worrisome, isn't it Alex?
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:06.200]  And you were named by this evil machine specifically, and I would say that, you know, you say hyperbole
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.840]  in this and that, we all won bad election away from losing everything, which is on the back
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:16.880]  of my book cover, and I don't know that we can recover from Obama's scorched earth policies,
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.920]  we know he's trampled the constitution, and I don't know how any of your listeners, you
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.800]  know, whatever the side they're on, you know, you know, and I know you've got all the opposition
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:29.280]  listening, and I'd like all of the good progressives who listen to Alex to see if they can nail
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:35.080]  them to a cross, tell me that one of these things has not magnified under this cretin
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:40.760]  in the White House, is this not becoming a third world nation of terror?
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:46.840]  Check yes, riots check black lives matter, mobs check black lives matter, chaos check
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:52.400]  Barack Obama, terror riots, mobs and chaos, this is a novelty in American history.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.520]  I haven't seen anything like this historically since the 60s, and before that, when was
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.160]  the last time you've seen America like this, and the beauty of all of this Alex is how
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:06.440]  he's gotten away with it, because you've got to give him credit, Barry Obama is the slickest
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:12.320]  salesman of communism the world has ever, ever discovered, no screaming, no yelling,
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:19.720]  no threats, just a silk smooth, good looking, nice guy with a lovely wife and children selling
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:25.200]  the most evil poison the world has ever, ever been asked to ingest.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:29.640]  And look how far he's gotten, and every time he gets away with another outrage against
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:35.240]  this nation, he raises the stakes like a junkie, he needs a higher dose of insult in order
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.160]  to maintain the high, am I wrong, Alex?
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:42.480]  You're dead on, Mr. Savage, Dr. Savage, please continue.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.240]  So the question is okay, I'm complaining about him, I'm saying she's worse, which is true,
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:48.960]  which is ludicrous.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:54.960]  She says America wants change from what, from the same policies she's going to continue,
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.240]  she's suddenly not a progressive lunatic, when, wait a minute, she's going to change
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:04.760]  Obama's policies in which way, make them worse, how she can't go the other way, and then she'd
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:05.760]  be Donald Trump.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.280]  So it means she's going to make it even worse than him.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:12.800]  That's if she remembers what she's supposed to do, and that's doubtful as you well know,
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:16.320]  because she doesn't know how many times she fainted.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.240]  So the point is, how do we uncouple this insanity?
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.440]  It is going to be really hard.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:27.460]  You know and I know, there was a UAC in the 1950s, and it's a dirty word of the most dirty
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:32.640]  of words, the House of Un-American Activities Committee, which was run by one of the great
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.160]  American patriots, Senator McCarthy.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.760]  He has been completely decimated by the left.
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:43.360]  McCarthy was a tail gunner in World War II, one of the most dangerous positions you could
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.440]  ever have in an airplane, right?
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.440]  Belly gunner, B-24.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:51.080]  Easy as target was the tail, that's what they attacked.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.920]  Listen what the left did to him, they mocked him and called him tail gunner Joe, and others,
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:57.800]  they took his heroism and tried to turn it into a mockery.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:02.480]  That was in the 50s, Alex, to show you who they were already, the communists.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.420]  So what was McCarthy saying, this great war hero?
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:12.480]  He was saying that Hollywood had been infiltrated by communists, the journalists haven't infiltrated
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:17.360]  by communists, academia had been infiltrated by communists, and the government itself.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:23.640]  Well, what happened was, they had the hearings, they ruined him, they destroyed the man.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:28.320]  And then what happened in the 1990s, I'm sure you remember the book, The Venona Papers
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.520]  came out, it was a Soviet Russian publication.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.880]  Turned out it was all true, the Russian documents came out and it was worse than what McCarthy
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:36.880]  was saying.
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:43.400]  Worse, it confirmed who in Hollywood, who in academia, who in government, was in fact
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:46.100]  an operative of the Soviet Union.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:50.680]  So they were subversives, UAC was exactly on target.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:56.000]  I say the only way we can save this nation is not talking about it, but by rooting out
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.160]  the subversives in the United States of America.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:02.480]  And I know many libertarians are afraid of this, for fear that it will turn on them.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.280]  Well let's put that fear aside for the moment.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:08.080]  In fact, let me just add this, since you're saying this, because this is a point I want
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.080]  to make.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:12.960]  If you look at the globalists, if you look at their leftists, they're saying the alt-right
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:16.280]  can't be tolerated, they're saying we need to be shut down and arrested.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.120]  Hillary says she's going to shut down right, Mark, that means drudge, you, they say they're
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.240]  bringing back fairness doctrine, they say they're coming after us, they're run by this
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.600]  foreign globalist Soros, Russia's already kicked him out.
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:34.680]  These are foreign globalists here, overthrowing our country, so under the Constitution, these
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.960]  aren't even citizens, they don't have the rights, they're here overthrowing the system
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:44.440]  to survive, we must go on the offensive, we must root them out, it's the only way to ever
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.440]  beat them.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.480]  They are criminals, they are subversives, they are Saul Alinsky pledging to Lucifer.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.480]  Please continue.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.240]  Yeah, they want to lynch all of us, if not electronically, then physically, and the fact
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:59.960]  of the matter is they have names, these are not nameless, faceless organizations.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:05.200]  The number one, and the worst of them all in my humble opinion is the ACLU, the Anti-Christian
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.240]  Liberties Union is the number one, they're the head of the snake, now the man behind
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:14.440]  all of it is George Soros, the most evil man on the planet in my estimation, the absolutely
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.080]  most evil person the world has seen in modern times, you know, you don't have to hang people
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.840]  electrocute them, put them in cages, you don't have to do the things that ISIS is doing
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.600]  to be evil, he's evil on a larger scale than the ISIS executioners are, because he's gutting
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.800]  the United States of America, he's trampling on our Constitution, he helped fund the Arab
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:36.440]  Spring, he helped fund the Arab Spring, Hillary, all of them, amen, and I keep saying she
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:40.880]  owns it, he was the one who, by the way, he funded it, but you know who was the architect
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:46.120]  the best I can put together, was Zabignou Brzezinski, that's right, McCarter's National
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:52.600]  Security Advisor, Brzezinski was the architect, Soros was the financier, Hillary Clinton was
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.840]  the publicist and an actor along with John Kerry, I'd say she was a quarterback with
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:02.000]  Kerry and Obama, she destroyed the Middle East, she owns that, how does the media, forget
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.400]  the media, why doesn't Trump put her on a cross with that one, and by the way, Mr.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:10.520]  Savage, Dr. Savage, that's not hyperbole, she literally destabilized 20-something countries
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.600]  that al-Qaeda and ISIS are running around, hundreds of thousands of dead Christians,
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:19.000]  they won't even let Christians out of the region, these people are demons, just like
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.280]  the true liberal Assange said, look, I've got the documents, the press is dead if she
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:28.200]  gets in, our necks are in nooses, she's a demon, you must stop her.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:33.960]  I hear you, and I also saw who wrote the other day that Obama, the nice, slick, smooth, nice
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:39.200]  family man, has created the greatest surveillance state in the history of the world, and suddenly
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.360]  liberals are afraid of it, because they understand what happens when the guillotine stops, starts
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:49.280]  falling, first it takes out your opposition, but as the world learned during the French
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:54.040]  Revolution, the guillotine has an unlimited taste for blood, and it doesn't stop with
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:58.480]  the enemies of the revolution, then they turn on their own kind and start executing their
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:04.520]  own so-called counter-revolutionaries, as was done in the Soviet Union, as was done in
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:09.200]  Cuba, as was done in Hitler's Germany, they killed their own, and the guillotine keeps
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:13.800]  falling and cuts heads, it is the most thirsty instrument on earth, and that's why the left
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:18.120]  ought to step up and shut their fat mouths, when we stand up to these monsters, these
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:22.600]  monsters need to be stopped, or we're all finished, left, right, and center.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.720]  That's right, so how do we stop them?
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.600]  Your book, I just got it, Incredible, gets into a blueprint, sir, with your incredible
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.920]  historical understanding, how do we beat these bastards, because they know we've got them
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:35.040]  in a corner now, but what tricks are they going to play, and then if we get Trump in,
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.480]  the battle just begins, what do we do?
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:40.040]  You said the magic words.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:45.080]  If Trump wins, the battle begins, because we know he is surrounded by neocons, we see
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.080]  that.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:51.400]  I was shocked to read yesterday, he hired Woolsey, Woolsey, the former head of the CIA
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.560]  and the Bill Clinton is now going to be his CIA director, so I laid him bed last night
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:59.920]  and he said, wait a minute, what is this about, and I said, well, you know, the CIA is a complicated
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.560]  organization, I mean, you need someone who knows how to run it, right?
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:09.000]  But look at Woolsey's track record, how could he join it as a senior advisor?
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  Why him?
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.880]  Isn't there a returning combat veteran who worked in military intelligence, who would
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.640]  have been a better choice?
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:20.640]  Some higher up American citizen patriot, somebody like General Flynn, CIA under Trump?
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.120]  Why Woolsey?
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:24.400]  Why foggy bottom all over again?
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.000]  Okay, but Alex, I don't want to waste your time.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  No, please take over.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.720]  Well, the way to defeat the enemy is to know your enemy, the way to know your enemy is
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.720]  to name the enemy.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:40.480]  Who are the subversive organizations who have destroyed and are destroying our civil liberties?
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:45.560]  We know the ACLU, we know the Southern Poverty Law Center, we don't care.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.960]  In my opinion, those are the three top of them, but I want to read to you all the others.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:50.960]  Can I do that?
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.960]  Please.
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.320]  Because I made a whole list in scorched earth.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:57.440]  I studied the cockroaches and I said, let's bring them into the light and expose them,
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.640]  make them scatter like cockroaches when you turn on the light.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.840]  The request I am making, Alex Jones, and to all your listeners is this.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.440]  Name subversive organizations.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:12.280]  As organizations, you consider it to be so far off the ideal of the American way that
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.960]  they are in fact subversive.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.240]  And what does that mean?
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:19.800]  That means they spend all of their resources going against the wishes of the Constitution
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.480]  and the taxpayer.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.280]  So who are they?
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.440]  I have a list.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:25.440]  They're right here.
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.440]  Who are these organizations?
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.920]  You're trying to conquer us.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.720]  They've done a pretty good job so far.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:35.360]  They see us as deplorable because we just want to be free.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.360]  National Lawyers Guild.
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.600]  Who are they?
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.320]  One of the most dangerous activist groups in the nation.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:45.920]  Every time there was a riot by Black Thugs Matter at an anti-police protest, the scum
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:51.240]  in the National Lawyers Guild sent out their deranged psychotic lawyers from the worst
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:55.960]  law schools in America to make sure the police could not do their jobs.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:00.600]  Every last shyster in the National Lawyers Guild is the type of lawyer that you have
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.640]  come to hate in playing English.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.480]  Now, of course, they will argue that they're just for the underdog, that they're there
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:09.320]  for the poor immigrant and the oppressed minority.
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:10.720]  Well, you know what?
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.120]  I don't buy it.
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:18.120]  I want a Lawyers Guild for the tax-paying middle-class Alex, not a Lawyers Guild for the subversives
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:22.000]  who are bringing in refugees, immigrants, whatever you want to call them by the tens
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  of millions.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:29.160]  George Soros emails where he admits it to destabilize the country, and he admits destabilization.
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.160]  Who admitted that?
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:33.240]  George Soros in the latest D.C. leaks and others.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.900]  He's in there admitting that it's a plan to overthrow Europe and the U.S. and create
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:37.560]  racial strife.
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.280]  Correct.
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.600]  Alliance for Democracy.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.560]  Amnesty International.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.920]  Black Lives Matter.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.720]  Center for American Progress.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.720]  Center for Media and Democracy.
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.320]  I'll read a few of them.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.840]  Center for Science and the Public Interest.
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.080]  Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:56.120]  I have two pages that I researched, Alex, in my book.
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:21:00.120]  Is Media Matters in David Brock in there?
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.680]  They're all over the place.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.680]  You name these organizations.
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:08.080]  It's like a spiderweb, Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, Blue Moon Fund, things you never
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.080]  heard of.
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.080]  Ford Foundation.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.080]  Joyce Foundation.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.000]  Who ever heard of the Joyce Foundation?
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:19.520]  HKH Foundation, Dolan Charitable Trust, Vanguard Foundation, Archer Foundation, Solensky's
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:24.560]  Back of the Yards Community Council, National Hip Hop Political Convention, Cuban Council
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.760]  of Churches.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.200]  People don't even know these organizations.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:35.520]  These cockroaches are crawling all over us, devouring our flag of liberty, Alex.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.520]  You're absolutely right.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:40.280]  And they admit they want to collapse us and our borders into a world government.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:45.600]  Dr. Savage, when you say the battle just begins, and I say that if Trump gets in and
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:49.280]  I'm not counting our chickens yet, I mean, why do you say the battle just begins?
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:50.280]  We just lost the Skype.
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.680]  Skype is a wondrous thing when it has its issues.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is so historical.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.920]  The establishments control the left and the right to bring in globalism, but they're making
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:01.200]  their worldwide takeover with the left.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.160]  And this is not a liberal group.
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:06.640]  Liberal means lower taxes, more freedom, more control locally.
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:07.640]  This is not liberal.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:08.640]  They call themselves liberal.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:09.640]  They have the moral high ground.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:14.040]  The Republican establishment is working with them in a big, big way.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:18.200]  The book is Scorched Earth, Restoring the Country After Obama, Michael Savage.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.280]  Your list is supported by you, our main sponsor of the list.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.400]  We have Hillary for Prison Shirts at cost, $9.95.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.840]  That includes the shipping, $9.95.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:30.040]  $9.95 shipping and the shirt all together.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:35.280]  That funds the operation in FullWarsStore.com, in FullWarsLife.com for our supplements.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:39.400]  But get the book, Scorched Earth, Restoring the Country After Obama, Michael Savage.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:43.920]  Get it in stores so that it becomes basically an end cap and a best seller to educate people
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.320]  that are not aware of what's happening.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.840]  Because that's Michael Savage's real skill, I found.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.360]  That's something I'm able to do as well.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:52.800]  Most of these mainline right-wingers can't do it because they're just following a script.
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.760]  Is that he's able to get leftist, a lot of them that mean well, out of their cocoon.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:01.840]  And Dr. Savage continuing with these subversive organizations and the five, six months we
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.000]  have left, you promised to come back next week if your voice isn't out.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.400]  I really appreciate you to do more and talk about the campaign.
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:13.040]  But hitting some of these other areas, her health, her cover-up, the mainstream media's
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:17.120]  ratings imploding, them trying to start all these new wars.
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.800]  Russia, I'm not lionizing Putin, but he's bringing back nationalism.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.240]  He's arrested and thrown out.
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.600]  All the Soros people is subversive.
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:28.120]  Just all the crazy things happening, it seems there's a quickening.
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.120]  Do you agree with that?
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:32.400]  And what does this signify?
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.480]  What you just said, you explained it better than I could, Alex.
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:37.800]  You see the global picture.
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:40.120]  The fact is, which one do you want me to talk about?
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.120]  Anyone you want.
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:42.120]  Just the top things you're...
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:45.960]  I'll talk about something in the middle of us talking about and me listing all the subversive
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.880]  organizations that I researched and scorched earth.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:49.880]  Did you notice what happened?
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.600]  We lost the connection that my Skype dropped.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.600]  Did you catch that one?
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:53.600]  It's crazy.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.800]  Well, they admit Google's all game, the internet's game.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:58.080]  They admit they're blocking terms for searching on Hillary.
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:02.160]  They admit they're censuring Patriot grips in Europe that criticize open borders.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.480]  It's crazy.
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:06.080]  You mentioned a key word there, Google.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:10.200]  For weeks, I've been railing against the monopolies that have emerged in America under Obama,
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.200]  the dictator.
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:16.400]  Google, Facebook, Microsoft, of course, have been there before.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:17.560]  Look at these companies.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:22.380]  They're violating the antitrust statutes of the United States legal system.
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:27.000]  There is an antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department that does not touch Mark
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.680]  Zuckerberg, does not touch the Google boys, does not touch Bill Gates.
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:35.960]  And there's a reason, because they all support the globalist New World Order agenda.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.960]  They support it to the nth degree.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:44.320]  And I've been screaming that when Trump becomes president, he must reactivate and use the Justice
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:49.520]  Department to break up these monopolies and give other people a chance to build a business.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:54.360]  And I make a point of Teddy Roosevelt, who was a populist, as you well know, and his
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:57.040]  campaign slogan was, bust the trusts.
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:02.880]  The trusts in his day were Standard Oil, Rockefeller's Railroads and Oil Company that
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.800]  dominated railroads and dominated the oil business.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.640]  They didn't give anyone a chance of emerging if they did, they crushed them.
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:12.720]  It's the same globalist grandkids today that are running globalism.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:17.240]  Zuckerberg, $58 billion isn't enough for that pig.
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:21.120]  He needs to cut the wages of American workers and throw them out of the country and bring
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.240]  an Indians to work for one-third the wage.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:24.400]  God bless India.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.840]  God bless their intelligence.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:26.840]  God bless India.
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.840]  But we've got to look out for us a little bit.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:29.840]  They belong in India.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:34.840]  Let them rebuild their own economy and let them hire IT workers at a right salary.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.360]  So yeah, you want to talk about jobs.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:41.360]  Why do you think, I'm not you, I'm talking with you.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:47.160]  Why do you think Trump is surging amongst the blue collar, disenfranchised white male?
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.160]  Why?
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.800]  Because they've been dumped upon, they've been stepped upon.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:56.520]  The Eddies, whose grandfather is defeated Hitler, the Eddies whose fathers died in the
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:01.640]  jungles of Vietnam are being crapped upon by these vermin, these cowardly vermin, these
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:02.960]  sick deviant perverts.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.960]  I can't stand it.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.480]  I'll get worked up and I don't want to.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:06.480]  I'm trying not to, Alex.
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:09.960]  This is the first interview I've done for this book.
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:10.960]  Thank you.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.920]  And Alex, I've got to tell you, you're on the front lines, you're going to be around
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:17.840]  a lot longer than I am in the media and probably on this planet.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.840]  And you're doing the job that needs to be done.
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:26.480]  And all I can say is, as the time comes to an end right here, when I say that Obama and
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:31.680]  the left are practicing a scorched earth policy, there's a reason for it.
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:34.760]  When an army retreated in the past, they burnt everything to the ground.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:39.480]  They burnt the crops, they killed the livestock, they burned the bonds, they burned the houses.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:43.880]  Is that not what's going on here with this left when they see an ascendant right and
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:44.880]  ascendant America?
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:45.880]  That's right.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:46.880]  They're blowing it all up.
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.240]  They're burning our, they're burning our pathways to survival.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.080]  They're burning our internet.
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.840]  They want to burn radio.
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:54.840]  They want to burn any access.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.040]  They're trying to start a race war.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.040]  They're saying kill the cops.
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.320]  They're getting away with everything.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:04.280]  I keep saying Soros gave them $70 million to those street thugs.
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:10.880]  All we need now is Obama to turn them into his well-funded private army.
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:15.660]  He can deputize them and give them government arms as he did ISIS.
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:19.800]  And then you will have the young pioneers of the Soviet Union.
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.640]  You will have the red brigades.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:28.440]  You will have the red brigades of communist China frightening everybody in the society
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.440]  on a daily basis.
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.120]  Alex, we're that close to it all coming to that.
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:35.000]  Obama is not finished yet.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.600]  He has several months left yet to burn it all down, Alex.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:39.600]  I agree.
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.480]  We've only got a minute left then in your gut.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:43.400]  You're a smart cookie, Dr. Savage.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.840]  What do you expect them to pull?
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:48.920]  Remember what George Bush did in the last few months of his regime?
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.360]  I was screaming and warning George Bush as a fiscal socialist.
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.360]  He's not through yes.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.680]  Do you remember the housing advice that followed?
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:01.240]  I expect that if it looks like Trump is going to win or grandma falls off the stage again
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.480]  for good and they replace it with Freddie from one of the nightmare movies, Kane Who
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.840]  Can't Win.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.480]  I expect the worst.
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:10.840]  I expect them calling off the election.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.680]  I expect martial law.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:18.040]  I expect if that is not possible, I expect a financial, complete financial breakdown
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:19.640]  to create even further chaos.
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:20.640]  That's what I expect.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:21.760]  I concur with that.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:25.440]  So every person in very race color and creed that wants to live in a somewhat free country
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:28.240]  now be involved, spread the word, expose these people.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:32.560]  We're all over the news pushing the idea of suspending the election now because of Hillary.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:38.240]  The book, Scorched Earth, in bookstores all over the country, Michael Savage, MichaelSavage.com.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:41.200]  Thank you so much for spending so much time with us today.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.800]  We've got about 45 seconds.
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.840]  Final point.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.120]  There is no final point.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.800]  The nation is wrecked right now.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:53.880]  It's going to be unredeemably destroyed unless the Republican candidate wins.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:58.520]  I keep saying Republican candidate now because if I say the word Trump, people turn off.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.480]  There are so many anti-Trump fake conservatives out there that the minute you say Trump,
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.480]  they go into overdrive.
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:07.960]  It's to say the Republican candidate that makes it a little easier for them to recognize
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:08.960]  that there is a choice.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:11.880]  They're really showing themselves as operatives, aren't they?
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.880]  Oh.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:17.880]  All the people who hate Alex Jones and Michael Savage who are true blue conservatives, who
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:18.880]  are they?
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.920]  Who are they, Alex?
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:23.200]  We don't even need to say their names because they've destroyed themselves.
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:24.280]  That's the good news.
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:25.280]  They're losing the war.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.280]  They've revealed themselves.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.880]  The fight's now out in the open and Dr. Savage, my gut tells me we're going to win in the
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:30.880]  end.
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:31.880]  What do you think?
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:36.560]  Well, with men like Glenn Beck rubbing his face in corn flakes, it was obviously a very
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:40.440] ... You look at him putting his face in corn flakes.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:46.360]  The man is obviously a very disturbed individual who was never on any solid ground.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:49.280]  And I have said before, liberalism is a mental disorder.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:50.560]  You, sir, are absolutely right.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:51.560]  You've charted the course.
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:52.560]  God bless you.
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:53.560]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:54.560]  Get the buck, Alex.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.560]  Incredible interview.
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:58.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:04.560]  Joe Bates here with infowars.com.
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:06.240]  Hillary's falls not infrequent.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:07.760]  Bill Worried says friend.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:09.520]  Article up by Washington Examiner.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:13.760]  Hillary Rodham Clinton refused her husband's demand that she go to the hospital for a checkup
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:18.640]  following her fall Sunday dude in ammonia, according to biographer Edward Klein, the author
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.960]  of several books critical of the Clintons.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:25.400]  In an interview with Secrets, Klein quoted a Clinton family friend of three decades who
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:30.100]  claimed the couple had a knock-down drag-out fight even with her pneumonia.
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:34.620]  Over her refusal to seek further medical help and testing, Bill was insisting that she go
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:35.720]  to the hospital.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:39.440]  It was her decision not to go because she was afraid that if she went to the hospital
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:44.400]  it would make it look like she was even sicker and it would hurt her campaign even more.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:48.000]  So it was her decision not to do that, Klein said.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.840]  The author of the upcoming Clinton book, Guilty Ascend, described his source this way.
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:56.200]  A source who was one of Hillary's friends for the last three decades.
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:01.680]  You can find more reports like this as we expose Hillary Clinton's sickness at infowars.com.
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.120]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:05.560]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.280]  Why is this so good?
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:11.800]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:16.600]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:22.320]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:25.640]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:30.720]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:32.000]  going on everywhere.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000]  These are all parasites.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.720]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:36.960]  You have the neem in there.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:40.040]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:43.400]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:44.400]  All right.
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.520]  Let's come back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:50.520]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose.
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:53.320]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:56.600]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.800]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.800]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:08.000]  Yeah, first of all, I want to say, secret 12, active 2, supermale, brain force, prostagart,
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  silver bullet.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  I use them all.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000]  They're phenomenal.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000]  They work.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000]  Buy them, folks.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000]  Thanks, brother.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000]  There's a lot of stuff that goes out there.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:21.000]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.680]  Welcome to the info war.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:27.480]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the info war
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:28.480]  at the same time.
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:29.480]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:32.480]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Mason, all of that.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.480]  All right.
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:34.480]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:35.480]  Have they worked for you?
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:38.120]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.120]  What products are you taking?
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.120]  Are you taking?
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:48.120]  I'm supermale, to brain force, to winter sun, X2, even got a little DNA force, so I just
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:51.120]  free up everything, and I just went to autoville.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:56.200]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research, and to see the reviews for yourself.
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:33:11.200]  Visit infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:18.200]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:26.560]  Staying off the streets, which may make scarring particularly difficult, even with this year's
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:30.960]  rule changes, to recap those revisions.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:38.640]  Women are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets, but teenagers now
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:45.400]  rack up 40 points, and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:56.400]  The big score, anyone, any sex, over 75 years old, has been up to 100 points, as always.
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:05.400]  How fast you move determines how long you live.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:09.600]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:16.600]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:59.600]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.600]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.600]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:08.600]  I got to tell you, folks, it's surreal to have somebody like Michael Savage say, Alex,
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.600]  you are the leader in this fight.
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.600]  You're the Field Marshal.
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:16.600]  That, I mean, that got to tell other talk shows that that is wild.
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:23.600]  And if you sit back and look at this whole battle space, there's like Matt Drudge, Michael
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:30.600]  Savage, Alex Jones, and then WorldNet Daily and Daily Caller and Breitbart.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:36.600]  And I'm here wanting Savage to be way bigger than I am in Drudge, not out of some cowardice thing,
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:42.600]  believe me, you don't want to be the numero uno in this fight, which I'm not.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:45.600]  Because it's a dangerous position to be in with these killers.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:49.600]  These people overthrow countries and just kill hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:52.600]  I mean, Hillary is literally a demon.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:56.600]  Like Assange, a true liberal said, he said, you don't know what I've seen and what's coming out.
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:58.600]  This woman is a demon.
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.600]  Our necks will be in nooses.
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.600]  We are all in grave danger.
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.600]  And I would add this fight is Julian Assange and is Vladimir Putin.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:09.600]  In fact, if you want to know who's number one in the fight right now, not saying he's perfect,
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:12.600]  not saying Russia is perfect, but Russia is not advancing on us.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.600]  Russia is not coming after us.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:18.600]  Even CIA director Clapper has come out and said Russia is an adversary, but we need to
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.600]  find ways to cooperate.
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:25.600]  Russia is battling al-Qaida and ISIS that Hillary and Soros and Obama have spawned.
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:28.600]  But it is Vladimir Putin.
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:36.600]  Okay, it's Russia not being part of the New World Order that is sending shockwaves across the globe.
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:41.600]  Only having one national sovereign country that isn't under New World Order control,
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:44.600]  partially, they're totally infiltrated like we are.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:50.600]  Having one quasi sovereign country is upsetting the entire apple cart and gives Snowden a place to run.
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:54.600]  And then WikiLeaks that cut its teeth going after the Republicans, which it should.
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.600]  They were doing horrible stuff.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:01.600]  He's like, whoa, the Democrats are like 10 times worse.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:05.600]  And so we've got Hillary Clinton coming out pushing, you know, racism, all this garbage.
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.600]  We're going to get to that in a few minutes.
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:15.600]  And your phone calls Matt and Karen and Kevin and Ron and Jennifer and others, the toll-free number to join us,
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:20.600]  talking about the election, talking about Hillary's collapse, talking about the suspension of the election.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.600]  They're really pushing that right now.
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:24.600]  Where do you see all this going?
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:29.600]  We're going to be talking about all this and a lot more today.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:32.600]  And I just want to briefly remind listeners, we are listeners supporting.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:36.600]  I don't get paid to promote other people's books or Vanessa Sousa's film.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.600]  I promote them because they're important books and important films to educate people.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.600]  We're in an information war.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:43.600]  Okay.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.600]  Most talk show hosts hit up people and say, hey, be a sponsor.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:47.600]  I'll have you on.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.600]  No, no, no.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.600]  We want to fight the New World Order.
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.600]  We want to expose what they're doing.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:53.600]  We want to win.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:55.600]  We want to stand up for freedom, just like you do.
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.600]  But it's important to support us.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:02.600]  We are ending a special today on super high quality, storeable foods, 30 to 40% off.
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:07.600]  We rarely do this special on the entire line of info or select storeable foods.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:09.600]  It's not select group of foods.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:12.600]  The line is called select because it's really high quality.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:17.600]  It's the full spectrum of my Patriot supply food that I can contractually private label it.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:18.600]  It's drop ship from them.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:23.600]  Very same food comes off their factory line in full spectrum, full selection, but 30 to 40% off.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:24.600]  They're already super low prices.
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:31.600]  If you want by my Patriot supply, right next to ours for 30 to 40% more and help fund our operation.
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:38.600]  Just like we have the Hillard for Prison shirts for 1995, right next to the same shirt for 995.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:39.600]  That shipping included.
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.600]  That is actually I was wrong.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:42.600]  It's not cost.
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:47.600]  I lose about a dollar on that because there's two bumper stickers on a citizen rulebook.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.600]  Put in free and when it's triple X large or four X large actually lose like two bucks.
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:55.600]  But we're ending that special today.
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:01.600]  We have to because I can't go bankrupt here losing and we sold like 10,000 since the special started.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:02.600]  That's over $10,000.
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:03.600]  I've lost.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:04.600]  So that special ends today.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:05.600]  I want to thank you all for getting the shirt.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.600]  Buy it at 1995.
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:08.600]  You like to support the operation.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.600]  Molon Labe shirts for men and women.
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:11.600]  You name it.
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.600]  Hundreds of great shirts to spread the word.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:14.600]  Meet minded.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:15.600]  Meet like minded people.
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.600]  Go where one of our shirts out in the public area and you're going to meet patriots.
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:19.600]  You're going to meet enemies too.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.600]  But mainly patriots.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.600]  This is important for you to experience and it supports the broadcast.
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.600]  But we've got 20% off X2 survival shield.
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:30.600]  Nice and I and I and 20% off our vitamin mineral fusion amino acid fruit punch drink.
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:34.600]  So absorbable for your body and your children's body and so many other great products.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:36.600]  20% off water filtration system.
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:41.600]  20% off indoor Alexa pure air filter systems that are normally 230 bucks.
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.600]  They're like 180 something right now.
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:47.600]  And I mean at the price that they normally are.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:48.600]  It's a great deal.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:53.600]  The leading competitor is $400 $500 for a very similar unit that does the same thing.
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:56.600]  Some units are $1000 and aren't even as good.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:59.600]  So we brought you the very best Alexa pure.
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:09.600]  That's available at infowarstore.com with a 4.9 star review out of five by a third party site power reviews and your purchase makes it all possible.
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:11.600]  This is the revolution against the globalist.
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.600]  This is the counter offensive.
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:15.600]  This is Americana.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:19.600]  And if Trump gets in, which is more and more going to happen once they kill him.
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:24.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, the battle has just begun and we are ready.
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:25.600]  They're going to start cop killing.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.600]  They're going to start burning down buildings.
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.600]  They're going to pull all sorts of crap.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:32.600]  We have to come together and preserve the Republic.
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.600]  Make it through this crisis.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:37.600]  And yes, arrest the conspirators.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:42.600]  But we're fighting very bold people that have been getting away with Nazi collaborating since they were teenagers.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:43.600]  These are bold.
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:47.600]  Imagine if you got away with rounding up thousands of Jews when you were 15 years old.
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:52.600]  And with the millions of dollars you made or Frank's you made, you were able to move here and take over.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:55.600]  I mean, imagine how Aaron and George Soros is.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:56.600]  That son of a bitch.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:57.600]  Excuse me.
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.600]  That's not fair to people that don't have daddies.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:00.600]  I call him a cockroach.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.600]  It's not fair.
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.600]  He's incredible.
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.600]  And he is number one enemy.
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:08.600]  That guy has it out for us.
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:12.600]  He calls himself messianic and believes he's the Messiah.
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:15.600]  What type of Messiah pulls stuff like this?
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:16.600]  Not a very good one.
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.600]  So you ain't it, brother.
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:19.600]  Let me give you a little newsflash.
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:21.600]  You look like a demonic toad.
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:24.600]  Now, speaking of demonic toads, Buckley ran into me, my cousin.
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:27.600]  One of the guys been working with Info Wars for 20 plus years and he came up and he said,
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:30.600]  Have you seen, you know, this toad meme?
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:31.600]  I forget the name of it.
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:33.600]  For years they've made fun of me with it.
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:39.600]  But it's also kind of an honor to have 4chan and, you know, all these trolls that are more
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.600]  sweetie pies make fun of you.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:43.600]  I mean, it means they like you.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:46.600]  And then if you're good natured about it, you know, then you get made fun of more, which
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.600]  is fun.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.600]  I mean, I like it made fun of.
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:51.600]  It's better than just being lied about.
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:56.600]  And so I know this toad meme or this frog meme is not associated with racial stuff, but
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:57.600]  with making fun of people.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:01.600]  And so you can find the memes where I've got the toad head on or our guests have the toad
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:02.600]  head on.
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:03.600]  And I've seen it for years.
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:04.600]  I don't even know what it is.
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:05.600]  I don't really follow this stuff.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.600]  I just know it's funny.
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:13.600]  So Buckley, Buckley Hammond, we now have Hillary coming out saying I'm racist.
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:14.600]  Tim Kaine came out and said I'm racist.
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:20.600]  I'm going to play the clip in a moment because our website before has tweeted this toad or
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:21.600]  frog.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.600]  Explain to me how I'm racist or how this toad is racist.
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:29.600]  Well, the reason why you are quote racist is because Hillary Clinton is scratching and
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:32.920]  long and grasping it any straw that she can get her hands on right now.
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:38.520]  And the only tool that she thinks she has in horror in her tool bucket is the blanket
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:42.600]  accused people that oppose her of racism, which as we know is patently absurd because
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:50.000]  her she her mentor is a bird, you know, who was the Ku Klux Klan grand grand dragon wizard.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.100]  But however, this is this is a really super surreal story that's actually happening right
[01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:55.100]  now.
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:56.600]  And it's the depths of it are so ludicrous.
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:59.600]  Let's show the headline for radio.
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:01.600]  We forget we're not just TV, we're radio.
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:05.600]  Hillary Clinton attacks Donald Trump for hosing Pepe the frog meme.
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:08.600]  I thought it was like a compliment because they they do this for me.
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:09.600]  They do it for Trump.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:10.600]  What does it mean?
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.400]  Well, so it's this is a long story.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.000]  Anybody wants to go on the Internet and look this up.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  It's a rabbit hole.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.040]  It's really hilarious that that is fun to go down and check out.
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:23.160]  But essentially a long time ago, a meme was created.
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:27.840]  But in the depths of the Internet, it was this Pepe meme and it's a frog.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.880]  And it used to be feels good, man.
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:33.120]  So when people were telling a story that made him feel good, it was kind of funny.
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:34.680]  They would post this this meme.
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:39.640]  And what's happened recently is we all know about Hillary Clinton calling 50% of Trump's
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:41.720]  followers deplorable people.
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:46.560]  Well, what that did is it triggered somebody that posted a meme that was based on the movie
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:51.440]  of what was the movie, The Expendables, which shows Donald Trump at the front.
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:53.720]  And it's got Pepe over his shoulder.
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:59.080]  And then it has people like yourself and Milo Yiannopoulos and Roger Stone and Donald Trump
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:00.080]  Jr.
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.080]  And Dr. Ben Carson.
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:02.080]  Exactly.
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:04.200]  And Donald Trump Jr. reposted this meme.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:11.960]  And so the Hillary Clinton campaign has taken this as as as Donald Trump is reposting a
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:14.360]  racist symbol.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:19.000]  And do you remember when he posted the the star that is basically the five pointed star
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.080]  that it, you know, every every share of where's across the country?
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:26.440]  Well, I mean, I've actually had specials back when I was even doing my own photo shopping
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:31.520]  but internet specials up or say a book or something, where you do the six pointed star
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:37.280]  a lot of times or an eight pointed or whatever you never do a five pointed to say special.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:43.120]  That's one of the most common and people showed Disney ads, Barbie doll ads, truck ads, all
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:46.000]  with the same yellow or orange star.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.200]  And they said he was against Jews because of that.
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:49.200]  Well, exactly.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.840]  And that's just a simple sunburst, but it also shows, you know, how big a trouble the
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:57.160]  Hillary campaign is, is that they're reaching so far to create these absolutely totally
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:58.160]  insane connections.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:00.160]  I mean, they want to call you a research.
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:04.720]  Is there any connection to this this frog and I don't know it's it's it's ridiculous.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:05.720]  It's totally it's apt.
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:10.600]  It's patently ridiculous in the whole like a fat lady on a treadmill or or or crazy lady
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:11.600]  on internet.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:12.600]  I mean, isn't it just a joke?
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.600]  Exactly.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:19.720]  But it's a way to sort of emphasize a phrase or an idea and and the whole internet is laughing
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:22.600]  at the Hillary campaign right now because it's it's the equivalent.
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:26.480]  Well, that's what's really evident is I don't claim to understand all these memes and stuff.
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:27.480]  They're fun.
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:28.480]  I know they're a joke.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:32.040]  But when you claim you understand it and get it wrong, the internet turns against you.
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.040]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:38.760]  Like they're basically trying to weaponize this and use it against people that oppose
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:39.760]  Hillary.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:43.560]  And the irony of this to me is that so number one, if you go back 10 to 15 years.
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:46.520]  Hillary went to Donald Trump's wedding.
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:47.880]  They used to be, quote, friends.
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:49.480]  They were friendly, etc.
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:54.000]  And now she's trying to paint anybody who's even remotely associated with him.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.280]  The truth is a real criticism of Trump of your super right winger.
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:45:59.280]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.280]  Sure.
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:01.280]  Constitutionalist patriot.
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:05.800]  But since Gary Johnson ruined that name, I'm just a paleo conservative who wants freedom.
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:12.880]  I mean, Trump is actually really has a lot of establishment modern liberal traits.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:17.500]  You know, early on, even 30 years ago, talking to the advocate, pushing equal rights for
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:22.240]  gay people, massively hiring minorities and women, putting him in positions of power,
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:24.920]  getting awards from Jesse Jackson.
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:27.720]  Quite frankly, I don't really criticize all that.
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:30.280]  It's just that he's a little too close to the Clintons.
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:33.560]  But I can see he's, you know, basically standing up to him double crossing him because he was
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:36.160]  30 years ago against Naftan Gat and his globalism.
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:38.120]  So he's been consistent really.
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:43.000]  He's just a nationalist, who's physically conservative, a little bit liberal when it
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.720]  comes to, you know, to his social issues.
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.480]  But whatever, he's not out to get the country.
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:52.320]  The claim that he's this big right wing racist guy that hates gay people in Mexicans, his
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.320]  horsemaner.
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.320]  Absolutely.
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:57.680]  And that's one of the things that I find personally insulting is that they're trying
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:05.800]  to rework the word nationalist and try to associate it with racist or white power people,
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:06.800]  which is-
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:07.880]  No, it just means we have our country.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:10.280]  We make our rules, not foreign TPP megabanks.
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:12.200]  Buckley, we're getting an article out on this.
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:13.200]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:14.200]  Absolutely.
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:16.920]  I want to go to phone calls and other clips, but I promise to go to your calls, but since
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:20.440]  Michael Savage brought this up, I thought I would bring up this clip.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:24.800]  This is Obama when he's running for office about to get elected in 2008 saying we needed
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.480]  a domestic security force just as big, just as strong as our military.
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:29.960]  And I went, what is that?
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:34.080]  That's like brown shirts in Nazi Germany or the, you know, commasars or whatever in Russia
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.600]  and these youth brigades in China.
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.240]  So I went and looked it up and sure enough, they were trying to organize with George Soros
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:46.880]  and Ford Foundation money, billions of dollars of organizing poor black youth and others
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:47.880]  with red uniforms.
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:51.200]  You couldn't make this up to be racially based.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:55.160]  Not we're going to be anti-crime, we're going to be pro free market, learn how to start
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:56.160]  a business.
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:59.320]  Not we're going to go out and camp or go swimming or, you know, go horseback riding.
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:01.760]  I mean, I would give money to get kids period that are poor.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:05.560]  In fact, I have done it, you know, out in the countryside, out doing things.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:08.360]  I mean, you know, I really care about these kids.
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:09.480]  I care about my kids.
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:10.480]  I care about myself.
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.480]  So I care about them.
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:12.480]  I can't help it.
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:17.400]  But no, this was all organized into chip on your shoulder, race, bait, garbage, NFL,
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:20.880]  you know, America is the most evil country in the world because they want the globalists
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:23.600]  that already run the country want to finish us off now.
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.400]  They want to break us up and we're done.
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:31.120]  And my only hope is they can't use all this race baiting they pushed to create white racism
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:32.120]  on the other side.
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:33.120]  That's what they want.
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:38.760]  Women with populism, Americanism, free marketism, which Trump's doing and just open arms, boom,
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:39.960]  roll over this.
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.640]  And that's what's happening.
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:46.920]  That's why the globalists are so scared right now because people really get now what's happening.
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:50.560]  Trump is pushing aside the Republican establishment, the Democratic establishment.
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.800]  He's a wedge for us behind him.
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:53.800]  It's happening.
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:58.680]  That's why Trump's real because what he's doing is irrevocably damaging to the New World
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:48:59.760]  Order.
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:00.760]  That's why they're in panic mode.
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.920]  That's why they're throwing everything they got, folks.
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:03.920]  There's no debate.
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:04.920]  Trump's for real.
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:05.920]  Okay.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:06.920]  Zero.
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:07.920]  Now, can he be manipulated?
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:08.920]  Will he compromise?
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:10.080]  Is he perfect?
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:11.720]  All of us have to do some things in this world.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:14.840]  You can't be a 100% purist, okay?
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:17.000]  But at the same time, I mean, here's an example.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.120]  There are some ads on this network that are not mine that I haven't vetted that I don't
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:22.120]  agree with.
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.140]  But I mean, you just radio stations, ads, nobody.
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:25.720]  You cannot run everybody else's lives.
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:30.080]  It's kind of like, it's not mind your own business, but a certain point, if I just sit
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:35.160]  here and try to be 100% pure, I'm going to be a basket case, live it under a bridge.
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:36.320]  I try to do the good thing.
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:37.320]  I'm honorable.
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:38.320]  I tell the truth.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.880]  I personally try to make the best decisions.
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:41.880]  Do I work with evil people?
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:42.880]  No, I don't.
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:46.200]  But I cannot make everybody else conform to my level and standards.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.200]  Okay?
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:48.200]  I mean, it's that simple.
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:49.600]  And I'm not criticizing the network either.
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:56.520]  It's just that I personally, personally just won't take any sponsor, okay?
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:57.760]  And I understand that's what talk radio is.
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.760]  It can barely survive.
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.160]  I'm not judging anybody.
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:04.320]  It's just what I'm getting at is if Trump, you know, does some things like bring in
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:08.200]  the former director of the CIA under Clinton, that's a little creepy.
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:10.600]  But then I know that guy's been better than other CIA directors.
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.760]  I know he is against radical Islam.
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.040]  I know he actually says, don't take Americans' rights, kick the jihadis out of the country.
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:19.160]  So I see how Trump's getting sold on that.
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:24.600]  The point is, you cannot expect Trump to know everything and do everything right.
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:26.800]  I don't do everything right.
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:30.000]  But let's say 90% of what Trump's doing is so wonderful.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.200]  There's another 10% I've got, I'm questioning, I'm looking at.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:36.080]  It ever gets to like 60, 40, I'm gonna have a big issue.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:37.080]  You see?
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:38.080]  But here's the difference.
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:42.160]  I know Hillary and the globalist are out to bring him down and bring us down.
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.160]  It is a no-brainer.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:47.640]  All right, I'm gonna come back and talk to Matt and then Ron and Kevin and Karen and
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:54.440]  Jennifer and others, 800-25-99-231, and we're gonna come back and play that domestic security
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:51:00.160]  force straight ahead that is made up of a bunch of angry, race-conditioned, basically
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:30.120]  the equivalent of black Cougar's Quinn.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:52:00.040]  Come and take it.
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:21.200]  I'm gonna come back and talk to Matt and then I'm gonna come back and talk to Ron and
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:50.800]  then I'm gonna come back and talk to Matt and then I'm gonna come back and talk to
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:53:10.640]  Matt and then I'm gonna come back and talk to Matt and then I'm gonna come back and
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:29.080]  talk to Matt and then I'm gonna come back and talk to Matt and then I'm gonna come
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:33.520]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:37.960]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:42.320]  of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:43.840]  But you must act fast.
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:47.800]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:48.800]  right now.
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:54.720]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to greens75.com.

[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:15.720]  So, as I mentioned, here's Obama calling for his national domestic force of people just
[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:20.720]  totally obsessed they've been wronged and that white people are the enemy here it is.
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:30.640]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:31.640]  that we've set.
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:38.400]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:39.400]  just as well funded.
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:42.360]  All right, I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:47.400]  Roger Stone is popping in for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:50.920]  And David Knight will be hosting fourth hour Lee and Mack who will be popping in with him.
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:53.920]  I've got a ton of news I haven't gotten to yet on Russia, the economy.
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:56.640]  There is going to be a jam packed third hour.
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:58.120]  I want to go to your calls right now.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:00.560]  Thanks for holding Matt in the great state of Michigan.
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.160]  Boy, I had family just up there vacationing.
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:04.280]  I didn't get to go on the Great Lakes.
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:07.360]  It looked like the Caribbean or something on those sunsets.
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:08.560]  I know I have family forever.
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.600]  Even back in my grandma's day, my dad's mom would go up there once a year in a vacation.
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:13.800]  How great it is at the end of the summer.
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:17.840]  I'm not trying to sit her into a travel log for Michigan, but the photos I saw in the
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:20.040]  video, I am going to Michigan next year.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:25.160]  Michigan ought to push itself for vacationing folks, but I'm digressing.
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:26.160]  Matt, go ahead for Michigan.
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:27.160]  Hey, thanks.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:28.160]  I appreciate it.
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:34.760]  I want to say thanks to your crew, their killin' it, your killin' it, Savage and all
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:36.640]  the rest of the pager you thought they're.
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:40.760]  Was that not crazy hearing Savage called me the Field Marshal, the leader?
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:41.760]  That's scary.
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:44.800]  It's nuts, man.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:45.800]  You're there.
[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:47.280]  You're there.
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:51.040]  I wanted to make something, make a point.
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:56.880]  I've been getting this feeling for a while now.
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:03.720]  I think Clinton did not want to run to be president.
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:09.120]  You know, her failed 2008, and everyone knows that Obama-
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:13.360]  Yeah, she was low energy then, so you smell a rat, you smell a fix?
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:15.560]  Yeah, a small fix.
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:26.160]  I think she was put in to beat Bernie, because she's got the ground game.
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:28.600]  I don't think they wanted to use Obama's.
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:30.400]  Sure, she already had the organization.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.400]  You're right.
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:32.400]  Right.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:37.040]  Obama's more geared towards probably the Bernie supporters, so I think that would
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:40.560]  be harder, and it would just try to him if something did come out.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:41.560]  So they used Clinton.
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:44.960]  I think they had more, like with the Benghazi in the email, they didn't know what all that
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:45.960]  was.
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:46.960]  What's all that?
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:47.960]  Sure, Hillary's totally controllable.
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:48.960]  Right.
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:55.320]  So they control her, you know, and then once it comes time, you know, if a science comes
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:57:00.960]  out with something big, you know, they'll jump the news cycle and, you know, she'll
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:05.560]  be out, you know, puttin', if it's Cain that they really wanted in, because Cain didn't
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:10.080]  have a chance against Bernie or whoever else.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:12.840]  No, I mean, I think what you're saying is pretty plausible, but I mean, do you think
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:14.080]  she would fake being sick?
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:17.880]  Because, man, she looks like she's wearing Academy Award-winning makeup then in acting,
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.400]  because she really looks sick.
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:22.320]  Well, I think she's sick.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:27.920]  I think that's one of the reasons why she went to run, you know, and this is a win for
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:33.520]  them because they still can have some influence, because they know, you know, another girl
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.880]  said, well, sure, they've got so much criminal stuff coming out that they need to get in
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:39.280]  and just try to cover it up and then kind of hand the baton to somebody.
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:40.520]  And I think that's clearly the plan.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:41.960]  I don't think that's debatable.
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:45.520]  The problem is her brain tumor or whatever it is, the word is brain tumor from really
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:46.520]  good sources.
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:47.800]  That's what the Secret Service thinks.
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:48.800]  They don't know.
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:49.800]  They just say, look, she's getting worse.
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:50.800]  She's falling down all the time.
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:51.800]  Our word is brain tumor.
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:55.720]  I talked to high-level people, folks that were former, you know, high-level CIA, current
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:56.720]  UNAMA.
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:01.080]  They say, Hillary has brain tumors and lung cancer, it's metastasized, and she's gonna
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:02.080]  be bye-bye very soon.
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:03.440]  And I don't take any pleasure in that.
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:05.760]  I had a bunch of articles yesterday saying I took pleasure.
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:06.760]  I made it very clear.
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:10.600]  I said, I'm an ecstasy, but they've lied about her health and it's been exposed.
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:13.960]  And what we've been told about behind the scenes has been caught on tape.
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:16.000]  And they said, oh, he's really glad she's dying.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  No, I'm not.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.080]  I'll be sad if she doesn't repent before she dies.
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:21.640]  I mean, I don't want her to go to hell.
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:24.880]  All right, Matt, great points from Michigan.
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:30.760]  We're going to come back and talk to Ron and Jennifer, Kevin, Karen, and others.
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:36.280]  And we've got, for a couple segments, former Trump campaign head, Roger Stone joining us.
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:38.760]  And then I've got a clip from Russia.
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:43.000]  Russia's really concerned on their state-run media about Trump getting assassinated.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.040]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:47.040]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:51.480]  Oh, that's an exclusive here in the U.S. You're gonna have an exclusive.
[01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:53.000]  Hey, everyone.
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.160]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:59.040]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:01.320]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:05.920]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in
[01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:11.400]  this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:14.680]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:17.800]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:20.640]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your

[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:35.760]  On Corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the infowar.
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:39.600]  Make no mistake, humanity is fighting for its lives against the globalists.
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:45.320]  They use all their science and technology not to build us up, but to make us weak.
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:46.320]  Those aren't leaders.
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:54.080]  And the dustbin of history, that forgotten frozen hell, that wasteland, has been prepared
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:57.040]  for them by their own hands.
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:00.280]  Buckley has wound up today popping in on the show.
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:01.280]  He was showing me more memes.
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:05.200]  I went back in his office how people are making fun of Hillary's logo now, because they've
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:10.040]  got all this national news claiming that this pepe the frog or pepe the toad meme has been
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:13.040]  around forever is racist, it's totally ridiculous.
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:17.760]  It means like winning basically, it just means oh yeah we're having a great time, we're winners.
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:21.640]  Now they've come out with a new and making fun of Hillary's logo saying oh my gosh it's
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:26.080]  an Islamic state symbol of flying a plane into the towers.
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:30.880]  But if you look at it, it really is red, you know piercing through the blue, you can say
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:34.880]  that kind of flips the colors, this is the democrats they're really red and the republicans
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:38.520]  you could say they're blue, kind of blue blood versus communist.
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:42.960]  But let's bring Buckley in about this new article, it's official, Hillary Clinton's
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:47.640]  logo is an act of terrorism, Buckley.
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:51.440]  I told him to come down during the five after I said come on over here in that little five
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:53.320]  minute segment just during the break.
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:54.440]  We're grabbing the hook to get him.
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:55.440]  We're gonna grab him.
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:58.600]  I said in that five minute little segment we're gonna go to you.
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:01.040]  That buckles like I want to come on the show and I said yeah well let's do it.
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:03.560]  So you gotta be there to do it.
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:06.920]  So here he comes running down the hall, yeah Buckley I said a little five minute segment
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:12.640]  I'm talking about that piece you talked about, go ahead and make your point.
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:15.600]  It's okay you can go live, just go live anytime, so I gotta do it, three a.m.
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:16.600]  a night.
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:17.600]  Go on the radio.
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:22.840]  So basically what has happened in this meme war as we were speaking just about just as
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:28.120]  this happened just now is that Pepe has put out, can you open up that link that I put
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:35.800]  in the folder please, is they've just now put out a response to Hillary's accusation
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:41.560]  of the Pepe meme being a racist white nationalist meme and now what they're doing is they've
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:50.080]  said that Hillary Clinton's logo looks like a projectile or airplane smashing into two
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:53.120]  buildings and why would they do that?
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:03:03.400]  Why would Hillary Clinton, how evil of her do this?
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:06.160]  It really actually looks like that, she is the founder of Islamic State.
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:11.760]  How dare her put out such an insensitive pro-Islamic State, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-911 attack symbol
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:12.760]  Buckley.
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:18.800]  Exactly, exactly and it's her and her daughter and her closest advisors have been putting
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:25.080]  up this symbol that is basically showing Islam attacking the United States and how dare
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:26.080]  she?
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:28.080]  Let's put the shocking symbol back up.
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:31.280]  They expose the evil racist toad with no evidence.
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:35.080]  This actually is an Islamic State image of the airplanes hitting the towers.
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:36.640]  Hillary, how dare you?
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:38.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:42.880]  So basically the level of absurdity that we've reached in this election has peaked.
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:44.880]  I mean, it's gone far beyond.
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:47.120]  And they're learning it's a two-way street.
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:48.120]  Exactly.
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:51.880]  But the thing that's interesting to me is that they're so tone deaf, they think that
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:57.760]  they're pulling a trick over on all the people that are out there in the world by misusing
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:03:58.920]  and misrepresenting these symbols.
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:01.640]  All they're doing is feeding the internet's hunger.
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:02.640]  Exactly.
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:06.840]  They're feeding the internet's hunger and there will be more jokes and more memes and
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:08.320]  more ridicules.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:12.560]  And the irony to me is that basically she's down.
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:17.280]  Right now she's been stumbling around, she's sick, she's been sort of, you know, it's been
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:19.640]  proven that her health is barely consistent.
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:22.000]  She has two interviews now by phone.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  They say, can we send a crew?
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  And she goes, no.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.600]  But Bill Clinton goes now on TV4.
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:27.080]  But everything's fine, Buckley.
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:28.080]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:31.680]  So basically this is a weird, weak little smoke screen that they're trying to put out
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:33.480]  right now.
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:34.480]  And it's not working.
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:36.480]  It's backfiring on them a huge way.
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:40.820]  I guarantee you that there's a lot of people that were probably, maybe just even slightly
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:44.280]  skeptical about her that are now just totally, absolutely.
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:48.920]  Well, sure, and I got to tell you, I mean, if a frog is randomly racist, on Red Arrow
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:52.240]  shooting through two buildings, the towers, she's saying, I took down the towers, I support
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:53.920]  Islamic State, I want to hurt America.
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:57.560]  I mean, if a toad is racist or a frog, there's no evidence there.
[02:04:57.560 --> 02:05:00.040]  This is actually huge evidence compared to her thin argument.
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:02.240]  Wow, what an al-Qaeda supporter.
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:05.640]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com, article up by The New York Post.
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:08.240]  Trump wants to debate Clinton without a moderator.
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:11.480]  Donald Trump wants to debate Hillary Clinton, but he doesn't want to moderate her on stage
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:12.480]  with him.
[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:16.400]  He wants to have a debate with no moderator, just Hillary and I sitting there talking.
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:21.360]  Trump said Monday morning in a phone interview on CNBC's Squawk Box, the Republican presidential
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:25.920]  candidate said that criticism of NBC's Matt Lauer following last week's candidate forum
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:29.240]  in New York City is an effort to manipulate the presidential debates.
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:33.400]  The fact is, they are gaming the system, Trump said, of the criticism of Lauer.
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:38.320]  I think the system is being rigged, so it's going to be a very unfair debate.
[02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:42.640]  He also added, I can see it happening right now because everybody was saying he was soft
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:47.280]  on Trump, and now the new person is going to try and be really hard on Trump just to
[02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:49.600]  show the establishment what he can do.
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:52.840]  Well, we don't know what's going to happen, but we do know that if Trump and Hillary get
[02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:55.360]  on stage together, it will be an annihilation.
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:58.600]  Trump will be victorious and have a landslide victory.

[02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:11.520]  a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the info war, a 360 win.
[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:16.480]  Number one, when you choose auto-ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:18.080]  at infowarsore.com.
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:21.920]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:26.000]  auto-ship because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:31.240]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:35.320]  Customers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:37.120]  the products that you need each month.

[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:51.520]  this is a sure win.
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:53.120]  10% off on auto-ship.
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:57.520]  Win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.

[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:15.560]  We are on the march, the Empire is on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:20.280]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to get really serious here in a moment, but this
[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:23.160]  is covering satire, but it is serious.
[02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:27.560]  Hillary has jumped the shark, claiming that if people make internet memes about toads or
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:31.960]  frogs, which have been around for a decade, it means having fun, that it's racist.
[02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:33.720]  Well, that's blown up in her face.
[02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:37.320]  The internet's now coming out saying her Hillary symbol is the World Trade Center's
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:39.320]  with an Islamic plane flying through it.
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:45.000]  And there's more evidence of that than there is of toad and frog memes being racist.
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.760]  These people are completely out of control, they're at war with truth and information.
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:52.960]  But now, there's a story on infowars.com.
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:59.400]  We're on major democratic party websites from the Huffington Post to you name it.
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:07.480]  Liberals are outraged after Trump kid, that's Donald Trump Jr. kills Triceratops that has
[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:13.120]  been extinct for 25 million years and a pterodactyl extinct for 25 million years.
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:19.600]  They say the only reason they're doing it is because they have the money to do it.
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:25.480]  And he goes out on the streets and Democrats go further and think it's wrong that Donald
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:34.880]  Trump Jr. is killing pterodactyls, flying lizards, and yes, Triceratops.
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:40.120]  The main enemy of Tyrannosaurus rex, the terrible lizard in Latin.
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:43.480]  These people are from another planet, folks.
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:47.880]  So our reporter Mark Dice has us, I want him on tomorrow, we got to get Mark Dice on tomorrow.
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:50.640]  The video, we're going to play it after our guest leaves us.
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:53.840]  This meme war is just getting too insane and I got to be honest.
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:10:01.440]  They call patriots, libertarians, paleoconservatives, you know, these horrible creatures.
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:09.640]  What's the term that Trump has been countering over and over again, that we're the deplorables.
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:12.640]  Not the dispendables, but the deplorables.
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:18.440]  But now, what do you call these low information voters, the zombies?
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:23.200]  I mean, I'm so sorry for them, I don't say all Democrats are evil, like they say all
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:26.880]  Republicans are, I'm not even saying they're evil, I'm like, they think Triceratops are
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:29.280]  being killed by the Trumps.
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:33.720]  No human ever living seen the Triceratops, Donald Trump Jr. didn't kill the Triceratops.
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:37.600]  But if you just say you're for Hillary, they'll go along with you.
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:38.600]  This is crazy.
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:42.720]  You know, in the next few days, Roger Stone has huge news breaking about Hillary.
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:44.560]  Can you give us a taste of it?
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:48.160]  We'll talk about her illness, we'll talk about the Trump campaign, we'll talk about
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:52.520]  the deplorables, where all this is going right now.
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:58.800]  We'll also talk about our DrudgeReport.com linked article where they say it's pneumonia,
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:04.960]  but Hillary is receiving on video and in photos a neurological test before she collapsed,
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:09.240]  the one you give with someone having an epileptic seizure, which she clearly starts having.
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:16.560]  So Roger Stone joins us, former Trump campaign head, Trump confidant, worked in many administrations.
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:21.600]  We have stonecoltruth.com, both of his books are sold at infowarstore.com, we have Michael
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:25.080]  Savage on earlier, so much to cover, so much to go over.
[02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:29.320]  We have the vice presidential candidate, Tim Cain, attacking me yesterday saying I'm racist
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:30.320]  with no evidence.
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:33.160]  It seems like they've gone into total free fall.
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:38.880]  Am I wrong to say that they are crashing and burning currently, Roger Stone?
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:45.280]  You know, if this wasn't so serious, I'd be laughing, Alex, I mean, this is an absurdity.
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:50.080]  Notice how in the wake of the questions, very serious questions about Hillary's health,
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:54.000]  they're trying to revive the David Duke controversy.
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:00.200]  Please give me a break, Mike Pence made it very, very abundantly clear, both Trump and
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:03.980]  Pence repudiate and do not want the support of David Duke.
[02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:07.040]  This is a smokescreen because they don't want to talk about Hillary's health.
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:14.080]  Now, in all honesty, what I feel here is vindication, because only 10 days ago, and you played this
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:20.840]  on this network, the Clinton people in a written statement blamed me for the entire question
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:21.840]  of her health.
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:25.160]  And by the way, I want to be clear, Roger, we don't normally talk about ourselves, but
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:28.440]  I had a guest on yesterday and he pointed out, Dr. Pachennick, we have to because we've
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:29.600]  been so demonized.
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:35.000]  We have been drudge, you, myself, all of us have been abs, because we've been the ones
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  attacked.
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.240]  Matt Drudge, Roger Stone, Alex Jones were the main ones.
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:40.880]  We're supposedly the ones that, no, she's falling down everywhere.
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:42.160]  She's had brain surgeries.
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:44.240]  Her secret services contacted us.
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:47.200]  We have been vindicated with a royal flush.
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:48.200]  Go ahead.
[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:49.200]  No question about it.
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:56.160]  I mean, they said that this was a conspiracy theory put forward by right wing conspiracy
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:58.440]  theorist Roger Stone.
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:03.840]  Well, conspiracy theory, not, we're operating on the basis of our own observations.
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:09.680]  Now she collapses in 80 degree weather, first claiming it was heat prostration, then claiming
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:14.280]  it's pneumonia, at the same time saying that she was romping in Chelsea's apartment with
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:16.000]  her grandchildren.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.160]  It just doesn't meet the smell test.
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:21.560]  Hillary Clinton has something visibly wrong with her.
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:27.080]  I doubt she has the stamina to go toe to toe with Donald Trump for 90 minutes.
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:28.080]  No bathroom break.
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:29.080]  Is she right now?
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:30.080]  She's only doing phones.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:31.080]  She's only doing phone conversations.
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:32.080]  Right.
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:34.360]  Well, that's because they don't want you to see her.
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:39.760]  I'm predicting right now she backs out of the debates because she can't go toe to toe
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:43.600]  with Donald J. Trump for 90 minutes without a break.
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:46.680]  We got to keep an eye open for the earpiece.
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:49.800]  She clearly was wearing an earpiece.
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:51.480]  No conspiracy theory, folks.
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:53.600]  You can see it with your own two eyes.
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:14:01.120]  Now, based on her FBI interview regarding her email server, she clearly has no memory.
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:06.120]  Perhaps that's why she needs somebody feeding her the answers by earpiece.
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:07.280]  No conspiracy, folks.
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:09.360]  You can see the earpiece.
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:10.840]  And by the way, you can't make this up.
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:11.840]  We looked at the photos.
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:12.840]  They were leased.
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:13.840]  The campaign saying no one.
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:14.840]  They're so lazy.
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:17.960]  They pixelated and didn't even compress it a new layer.
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:19.960]  You can see where they blurred the earpiece.
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:22.840]  They are literally falling apart in front of us.
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:28.280]  Yeah, and they have changed her hairdo to try to cover the eyepiece.
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:30.440]  There's something very intrinsically wrong.
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:33.320]  Now, by the way, if folks say she's their own woman, as you said earlier we were talking
[02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:36.760]  this morning, they have the guy running up beside her when someone asks a question saying,
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:37.760]  it's okay.
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:38.760]  It's okay.
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:39.760]  She is in and out of reality.
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:41.440]  The word is a brain tumor, Roger.
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:47.200]  Well, look, I don't know whether it's Parkinson's or epilepsy or a brain tumor.
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:53.480]  I've been attacked, I've been approached and contacted by numerous eminent and prominent
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:59.720]  doctors who just on the basis of their observations have put forward various theories.
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:02.720]  The brain tumor causes the epilepsy and the Parkinson's.
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:03.720]  Well, that may be.
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:05.360]  Here's what I know.
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:09.520]  High-level Democrats have begun talking about replacing her on the ticket.
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:15.240]  Were she to be incapacitated or were her to drop or be unable to move forward?
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:22.040]  The Democratic National Committee chooses in one meeting her replacement and the world
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:23.040]  of...
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:24.040]  I'm told those meetings are ongoing.
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:25.040]  That's now admitted.
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:26.040]  So who do you think they may pick?
[02:15:26.040 --> 02:15:28.600]  I mean, I was hearing from you this morning about a certain woman.
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:29.600]  Yes.
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:32.760]  I think that they would go to, well, I don't think.
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:38.440]  My source, who's a very high-level and prominent Democrat, tells me that they would go to
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:40.320]  Michelle Obama.
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:43.760]  They can't resist the feminist wing of their party.
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:49.600]  These women are salivating over the first woman president, even if it's Hillary.
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:56.000]  And therefore, they would brook no dissension from the feminists by choosing Michelle Obama.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:01.760]  The disdain for the Clintons by Barack and Michelle Obama is well-known.
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:08.280]  Joe Biden has a little bit of a grabby problem with women and with children.
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:12.400]  They know that Uncle Joe would not stand up in a campaign.
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:15.120]  Jim Cain would be giving away the franchise.
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:16.120]  No.
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:22.360]  I'm almost certain that Hillary Clinton will be replaced by Michelle Obama if she throws
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:24.640]  in the towel.
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:29.000]  But meanwhile, the Democrat's main concern is that Donald Trump Jr. is hunting triceratops.
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:34.720]  Yeah, hunting animals that literally don't exist in our time.
[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:37.680]  This is the hysteria of the left.
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:42.520]  Nothing to change the subject from the question of Hillary's health.
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:46.800]  Roger, you've got a lot of their big bombshells here, but overall, what do you make of this
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:47.800]  time?
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:49.600]  I mean, I know you're a realist, not an optimist, so am I.
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:52.040]  I got to tell you, we are kicking their ass right now.
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:53.480]  I mean, they are in deep crap.
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:59.640]  Well, I give Steve Bannon enormous credit for stabilizing the good ship Trump.
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:02.320]  Trump is really performing as a candidate.
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:03.320]  I think he's...
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:06.040]  He seems like he's picking up great energy from being around these patriots.
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:13.240]  Well, and not only that, but this misstep of her, a branding you and I in Milo and others
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:14.240]  as deplorables.
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:16.720]  And look, Sam, we have no right to exist.
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:17.720]  Don't forget that.
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:19.880]  Well, look, yeah, kind of like Israel.
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:21.440]  We have no right to exist.
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:23.920]  Look, I'm proud to be a deplorable.
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:28.840]  If that means I'm thrown into a grab bag with you and many other patriots.
[02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:34.240]  But I don't like the fact that Hillary is denigrating average people, house-homemakers,
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:35.240]  farmers.
[02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:39.760]  It shows our disconnect that Obama got caught with bitter clingers in a secret meeting.
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:42.000]  He's out in speeches saying half are bad.
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:43.360]  Her minions say we're all bad.
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:46.200]  Let's talk about that disconnect because I think this is the magic moment.
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:47.200]  Go ahead.
[02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:48.200]  Yeah.
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:49.200]  No, I think you're absolutely right.
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:55.160]  When I put up the meme that had photos of the most prominent deplorables, Trump, Spence,
[02:17:55.160 --> 02:18:02.400]  Ivanka, Donald Jr., Eric, Alex Jones, and others, the left went absolutely crazy because
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:04.160]  there's a frog there.
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:08.040]  Some frog who is put there because he's so cocky.
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:10.040]  I'm proud to be in this meme.
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:11.560]  The Hill wrote about it.
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:16.560]  I think last time I looked, there were 10,000 people who had retweeted it.
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:17.560]  It were mocking them.
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:19.920]  See, the left has no sense of humor.
[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:22.400]  These folks have no sense of humor.
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:26.240]  But this reminds me of Mitt Romney and the 47 percent.
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:32.400]  When he wrote off 47 percent of the voters, the skies fell in.
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:35.520]  It was Armageddon, the mainstream media went crazy.
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:38.800]  He just mildly said 47 percent are being taken care of.
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:39.800]  They don't care.
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:42.640]  She's saying we're deplorable.
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:44.960]  And she denigrates average people.
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:49.240]  She's denigrating Trump's voters who are supporting him in good faith.
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:52.600]  So its elitism is what it is, Alex.
[02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:59.680]  And to me, it's repugnant, which is why I chose to mock her with that particular image.
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:01.160]  You're absolutely right.
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:05.040]  And she's obviously deteriorating quickly.
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:08.160]  And I've got sources that say it is brain tumor metastasization.
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:10.080]  The first tumor removed in 2012.
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:13.480]  We had the Secret Service that said she's got lifts on the vehicles as falling down.
[02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:14.480]  You see it.
[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:15.480]  I mean, that's real Secret Service.
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:18.680]  You were there with us when we were mobbed by the Secret Service like rock stars.
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:20.280]  I've never seen them act like that.
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:21.960]  But they've seen the criminality.
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:26.160]  I just think, how are they going to strike back the Roger Stone?
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:30.560]  Well, I think they're getting painted into a corner.
[02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:35.240]  I think that one of the reasons that they are panicky is because the negative campaign
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:40.360]  plan to just disqualify Trump has failed.
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:42.120]  They pulled their whole bag of tricks.
[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:43.120]  He's a bigot.
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:44.120]  He's a racist.
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:45.360]  He's mentally unstable.
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:46.360]  He's trigger happy.
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:47.960]  He'll start a war.
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:49.880]  All those things are false.
[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:51.840]  The American people aren't buying.
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:53.400]  And that's why they're panicky.
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:58.480]  Because in the 1980s playbook that they use, this should have blown Trump away.
[02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:00.680]  This should be a 10 point race today.
[02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:01.680]  And it's not.
[02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:05.160]  It's either even or Trump may be slightly ahead.
[02:20:05.160 --> 02:20:08.640]  Her candidacy is imploding before our very eyes.
[02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:10.920]  It just shows you two things.
[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:17.600]  One, that the power lust and the greed of the Clintons is unabated.
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:22.960]  With both of them in poor health, when both of them having lacking the stamina for a national
[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:26.680]  campaign, they still are grabbing for the Golden Ring.
[02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:32.240]  And secondarily, the other thing we see is that their decades old abuse of the Secret
[02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:37.680]  Service, who they've called pigs and who they treat like servants, comes back to bite them
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:44.200]  when Secret Service agents leak the fact that she is gravely ill and that she has no stamina.
[02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:50.840]  So they have reaped what the Clintons have sown.
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:52.280]  What do we do next?
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:56.560]  Well, I think that we continue exactly where we are.
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:21:02.880]  All of this, Alex, increases the odds that they will attempt to steal this election through
[02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:05.880]  machine manipulation.
[02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:08.760]  That's why I started stop to steal.org.
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:14.400]  That's why we are organizing scientifically conducted exit polls that we can compare to
[02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:20.600]  the machine results on a precinct by precinct basis in targeted counties and targeted states
[02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:23.640]  where we suspect the steal will be afoot.
[02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:29.920]  I also commend to you Dr. Richard Davis' program, which will be announced shortly, PollMol, building
[02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:37.320]  a national multi-million sample daily poll so we can show the voters where this race
[02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:38.960]  really is.
[02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:45.280]  Those are key programs that can be used to ensure that we have an honest election.
[02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:51.880]  All of this tempts the Clintons and the machine Democrats to steal this election, not just
[02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:56.520]  through voter fraud, but through machine manipulation.
[02:21:56.520 --> 02:22:01.880]  No folks, it's not far-fetched, no it's not outlandish, it's not as Barack Obama said
[02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:03.880]  ridiculous.
[02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:09.400]  Terrific piece on Fox last night with Brett Baer talking about multiple examples of people
[02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:15.040]  voting multiple times, people voting in several states at the same time.
[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:16.040]  One guy-
[02:22:16.040 --> 02:22:18.480]  Sure, sure, our audience is informed, but let me ask you this then.
[02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:24.640]  Everything they say blowing up in their face, like a Greek tragedy or biblically, oh there's
[02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:28.360]  no election fraud, but we're federalizing it, oh we're not sick, we're falling down
[02:22:28.360 --> 02:22:34.080]  and having convulsions, it just seems like history is on our side, I mean there seems
[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:35.840]  to be magic in the air.
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:39.400]  People I know that aren't even religious are saying it seems like God's doing this.
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:43.720]  Well, the large number of African-Americans who just come up to me in the street recognize
[02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:48.400]  me from Info Wars and other places as Trump's guy, they don't even know my name, but they
[02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:50.480]  want to high five me.
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:54.760]  This whole idea that Trump is a racist is going to get disproven on election day, when
[02:22:54.760 --> 02:22:59.600]  I predict to you he gets the highest percentage of African-American votes of any Republican
[02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:00.600]  in my lifetime.
[02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:01.600]  He's going to-
[02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:05.440]  Well, the polls already show that, and that's what's freaking him out, is that they're
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:10.720]  54 days out from the election and everything they're doing is turning into crap.
[02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:15.320]  Well, the Clintons want to keep black folks on the plantation, Donald Trump wants to make
[02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:20.480]  them prosperous, wants to get them a piece of the American pie, wants to make them employers
[02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:25.840]  not employees, and black folks I talk to get it, they totally get it, they're tired of
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:32.200]  being used and forsaken by the Democrats at election time.
[02:23:32.200 --> 02:23:36.760]  If you look at the employment statistics for African-Americans or for Hispanics for that
[02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:42.400]  matter under this current president or under Bill Clinton, they are disgraceful.
[02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:45.320]  I guarantee you Donald Trump can do better.
[02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:49.840]  And as you say, they are- well, globalism is designed to make us poor, so it just takes
[02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:52.680]  us- you know, the foot off our neck, it'll help, exactly.
[02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:56.360]  But you mentioned Tim Kaine, the VP candidate, who they're trying to float back there in
[02:23:56.360 --> 02:23:58.600]  the background, but you think it'll be Michelle Obama.
[02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:03.480]  He comes in, mentions David Duke yesterday, who has no connection to Trump, and then ties
[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:04.880]  it into me.
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:07.760]  I mean, why are they going after us so much?
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:08.760]  Here's that clip.
[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:14.160]  It's very clear to all of us that the Trump campaign has given a platform, you can call
[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:20.600]  them whatever you want, the alt-right movement or others, but when David Duke is doing robo
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:25.640]  calls saying vote for Donald Trump and others who are kind of at the very fringe of the
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:30.640]  conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:36.560]  in ways, or even the recent choices of campaign management, this is something that is really
[02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:37.560]  important.
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:42.760]  Okay, so now he connects David Duke to myself and Stephen Bannon with no proof, I mean,
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:43.760]  this is outrageous.
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:48.920]  I'm kind of disappointed in all honesty that he didn't mention me in all honesty.
[02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:50.360]  It's gravely disappointing.
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:54.040]  Look, the Communist Party of the United States has endorsed Hillary.
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:57.560]  There are Ku Klux Klan chapters that have endorsed Hillary.
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:24:59.040]  How come we don't talk about that?
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:01.600]  How come that's never in the mainstream media?
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:05.320]  I'll tell you why, because it's extraneous, and that was extraneous.
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:09.560]  By the way, the t-shirt showing with the open shirt, really bad look.
[02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:10.560]  Really bad look.
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:17.200]  I know you got some big news breaking the next few days at StoneColdTruth.com and Infowars.com.
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:19.440]  Can we get into that a little bit, or should we save it?
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:27.000]  Well, I think that there's going to be a public examination of how and why Gaddafi was removed
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:30.600]  in Libya that is going to truly shock people.
[02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:35.240]  Now, I don't want to telegraph our punches, so I don't want to get any further out there.
[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:38.960]  But let's just say it's WikiLeaks level.
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:43.000]  Without any question, it will rock this entire race.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:44.000]  Please coordinate closely.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.400]  I mean, I know you're saying you're going to let us put it out, but please coordinate
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:48.600]  closely because I want to get this.
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:49.600]  This is powerful.
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:50.600]  I mean, this is smoking gun.
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:54.000]  Yeah, it is just around the bend.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:00.280]  There has been enormous research done regarding the removal of Gaddafi that will speak to
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:06.840]  both Hillary's motive means and the way it was done that I think is going to shock people.
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:08.720]  Let's sum it up this way.
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:14.240]  Black lives matter unless you live in Libya, in which case Hillary borrows a billion dollars
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:18.480]  to bomb you into submission.
[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:20.200]  And Gaddafi was ready to walk.
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:23.560]  She just wanted to blow the hell out of the country.
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:30.000]  Well, too many of her major benefactors at the Clinton Foundation had a major stake in
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.600]  the removal of Gaddafi.
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:34.760]  Now, we don't know where his wealth went.
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:40.280]  We don't know where his world class weapons went, but we do know that he had agreed to
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:44.800]  all the conditions for to leave the country.
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:48.200]  This is a stunning story that the American people need to know.
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:49.200]  Wow.
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:53.120]  Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com.
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:56.800]  How do you expect them to strike back?
[02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:57.800]  Where else do you see this?
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:00.160]  I mean, other areas we should be watching.
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:07.200]  Well, the only option left to open to them is to come up with some smear of Donald Trump.
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:09.240]  But they're getting to the bottom of their bag of tricks.
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:11.800]  They played all their classic bag of tricks.
[02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:19.080]  I'm sure you remember the totally phony lawsuit filed against Trump claiming by an unnamed
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:26.520]  woman claiming that he had raped her completely and totally bogus, false, meant to distract
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:32.080]  from Bill Clinton's relationship with the child molester and the convicted pedophile
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:33.800]  Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:39.520]  And by the way, Hillary's top aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, and the White House
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:45.920]  social secretary, all of their direct private phone numbers found in Jeffrey Epstein's personal
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:48.720]  phone book when he was arrested.
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:49.720]  That's right.
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:50.720]  Clinton flying around on it.
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:54.680]  So we have a tripling quadrupling down on lies, a desperate corporate horror media that
[02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:55.880]  could do anything.
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:27:58.400]  They may say Donald Trump is eating little children.
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:00.120]  I mean, just get ready for anything.
[02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:02.000]  But they're so discredited, it's not going to work.
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:05.640]  Well, and the toothpaste cannot be put back in the tube.
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:10.600]  We're not in the 1980s where the Clintons could Mao Mao and Brow beat the three major
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:15.220]  networks into covering a story and pretending it's not news.
[02:28:15.220 --> 02:28:18.600]  That's just not going to work anymore.
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:19.600]  There's too much exchange.
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:22.080]  Is it fair to say they're in a total panic right now?
[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:27.040]  Yes, I think they're in meltdown mode because Trump was supposed to be easy to dispatch.
[02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:30.400]  Look, if you go back, I remember he wasn't going to win the nomination.
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:31.400]  He wasn't.
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:32.400]  It was all delusion.
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:37.880]  Well, if you go back and read Hamilton Jordan's memoirs, he tells you that Jimmy Carter fervently
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:40.120]  wanted to run against Ronald Reagan.
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:45.280]  He felt that that George Bush or John Connolly or Howard Baker would have been much tougher.
[02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:51.800]  So Reagan was his preferred opponent, massive miscalculation.
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:56.320]  Now I believe the Clintons have made the exact same miscalculation.
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:29:01.880]  In Donald Trump, they have a man of enormous courage who has no fear about going anywhere
[02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:02.880]  in the Clintons.
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:05.760]  And that's why he's winning so many people marching into those churches, getting on
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:10.520]  those hot tarmacs, circumventing the Black Lives Matter thugs, charging in, getting
[02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:12.920]  two hour speeches on 150 degree tarmacs.
[02:29:12.920 --> 02:29:14.920]  I mean, it's just pure Americana.
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:21.480]  Well, headed to Baltimore today to once again underline the fact that the policies of Obama
[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:25.840]  and Clinton have failed African Americans have failed our inner cities.
[02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:28.040]  Alex, let me say this.
[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:29.120]  Trump is going to win.
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:30.120]  Mark my words.
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:33.640]  And by the way, you've never said that before, but now you're saying Trump is going to win.
[02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:36.320]  I know you've got to go, but you come back and do two minutes on Trump winning or if
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:37.320]  you got to go.
[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:38.320]  I understand.
[02:29:38.320 --> 02:29:39.320]  You know what?
[02:29:39.320 --> 02:29:40.320]  I have another.
[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:41.320]  They got to go.
[02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:42.320]  All right.
[02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:43.320]  Roger, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:44.320]  Come back tomorrow then.
[02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:45.320]  Go ahead.
[02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:46.320]  Friday for sure.
[02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:49.080]  I want you to come back and elaborate on Trump winning stone now says Trump is going
[02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:50.080]  to win.
[02:29:50.080 --> 02:29:51.080]  All right.
[02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:52.080]  We'll be back.
[02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:53.080]  We're on the March.
[02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:55.400]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.400 --> 02:30:02.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:02.440 --> 02:30:07.160]  Joe Biggs here with info wars.com article up at Politico former DNC chairman calls for
[02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:08.800]  Clinton contingency plan.
[02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:12.840]  It's extremely unlikely Democrats will have to change the ticket, but even some Clinton
[02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:15.360]  allies say there should be a clear process.
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:20.360]  A former DNC chairman says President Barack Obama and the party's congressional leaders
[02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:25.240]  should immediately identify a potential successor candidate for Hillary Clinton for the off chance
[02:30:25.240 --> 02:30:28.120]  a health emergency forces her out of the race.
[02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:32.120]  Now is the time for all good political leaders to come to the aid of their party.
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:37.680]  So Don Fowler, who helmed the DNC from 95 to 97, Fowler said he expects Clinton to fully
[02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:42.320]  recover from her bout with pneumonia, which forced her to leave a September 11th Memorial
[02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:47.920]  event when she fell to her face at freefall speeds, much like building seven during 9 11.
[02:30:47.920 --> 02:30:52.560]  He added a note of caution should Clinton attempt an expeditious return to the campaign trail.
[02:30:52.560 --> 02:30:55.920]  She better get well before she gets back out there because if she gets back out there too
[02:30:55.920 --> 02:30:58.080]  soon it might happen again.

[02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:32.480]  All right, Mark and Jennifer and Ron and Kevin and Karen too, I mean it's all of you here
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:33.480]  in five minutes.
[02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:34.480]  I'm going to write to you.
[02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:35.480]  Bam, bam, bam.
[02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:38.240]  But first, I've got air of this report because it's been filed for three days.
[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:45.720]  It's so important to understand what the globalists like Hillary are pushing on the other side
[02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:49.080]  of this agenda because they're just the front people.
[02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:51.080]  But what's the actual plan?
[02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:57.200]  It's modern serfdom, feudalism, the end of the renaissance world.
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:34:02.840]  Here's John Bounds report, Gen of 2030 because they've now finished Gen of 21.
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:05.400]  Now the UN calls it a Gen of 2030.
[02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:10.440]  This is a microcosm of Austin, Texas, deep in the heart of Texas, occupied by the globalists
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:14.760]  bringing their program of control in here it is.
[02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:17.560]  Globalism already exists in the United States.
[02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:25.000]  Filled out behind me is 31,708 acres of the Balcones Canyonland Wildlife Preserve.
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:31.440]  The preserve is under the authorization of the 1973 Endangered Species Act, basically
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:35.960]  an extension of the United Nations Agenda 21.
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:41.600]  Even though Austin's population grows by 110 people every day, development of this
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:44.200]  prime acreage is not permitted.
[02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:51.000]  And furthermore, with the United Nations recent implementation of Agenda 2030, the globalist
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:55.840]  reach is finding its way into our very neighborhoods and lives.
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:00.640]  President Obama didn't go on a tour of Asia just to be consistently insulted for being
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:02.280]  a globalist pawn.
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:07.640]  Obama was attending the G20 in Hangzhou, China, signing away the fleeting remnants of
[02:35:07.640 --> 02:35:12.000]  the United States sovereignty over to the globalist 2030 agenda.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:18.080]  Among the totalitarian horror this agenda includes our mandatory vaccinations worldwide
[02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:23.840]  under the guidance of Bill Gates, the unleashing of GMO technology on the natural world and
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:26.120]  the guise of feeding the hungry.
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:29.200]  And genetically modified sounds Frankensteinish.
[02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:33.560]  Drought resistance sounds really something you want.
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:38.520]  Carbon taxes that will increase poverty and create a surf-like energy consumption.
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:43.320]  An introduction of a global tax that will make the IRS and the Federal Reserve look
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:48.920]  like child's play and a global implementation of smart grid technology that will be beta
[02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:55.640]  tested in Africa under the $7 billion of U.S. taxpayer money Obama donated to the project
[02:35:55.640 --> 02:35:57.440]  titled Power Africa.
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:03.640]  The socialist tentacles of Agenda 2030 now reach right into our own backyards as Obama
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:09.280]  in a last-ditch effort aims to essentially transform America by giving the poorest of
[02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:13.760]  neighborhoods an equitable stake in the richest of neighborhoods.
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:19.600]  The Austin, Texas City Council is hiring, not electing, what will be known as the Chief
[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:20.800]  Equity Officer.
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:26.600]  Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon have already paved the way for this socialist enterprise.
[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:30.840]  Three candidates are in contention for the position here in Austin, Texas.
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:36.240]  Austin Mayor Steve Adler wrote similarly to the Sustainability Office, which has a focus
[02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:42.600]  on the environment, i.e. Agenda 21, we should consider the creation of an equity office.
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:48.320]  Have Chief Equity Officer or propose an alternative that provides such a dedicated office.
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:53.760]  Such an office could advance racial and ethnic equity by looking at all the city does with
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:59.600]  a focus on equity, gathering equity data and creating dashboards advocating for and perhaps
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:02.120]  staffing the quality of life commissions.
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:08.480]  The work would focus on tackling institutional barriers based on race and ethnicity and addressing
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:13.440]  those issues that interfere with access and equitable service delivery.
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:20.000]  In response, Austin City Council member Aura Houston replied, Mayor, this is a great idea.
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:25.240]  Equity is an issue of class as well as ethnicity and or culture.
[02:37:25.240 --> 02:37:30.480]  So we are there building and drawing the maps and holding people accountable.
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:37.400]  I think equity means that we, I guess, announce the sense of a system that was created for
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:42.360]  us and start looking at how do we build our own systems, the way that it works for the
[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:44.960]  community that's screening that we need equity.
[02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:49.800]  One of the things that we see as being really effective across the country is use of a racial
[02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:50.800]  equity tool.
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:56.480]  And what that means is that new decisions are being made that we are considering race
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:38:02.840]  in the impacts, whether the decision is actively perpetuating the status quo or working to
[02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:03.840]  change the status quo.
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:08.840]  The history of change in the United States is the history of organizing.
[02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:15.840]  And the reason why we have had change is because of community organizing putting pressure on
[02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:16.840]  government.
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:22.560]  The main goal of the micromanagement of communities cloaked in the disguise of diversity is to
[02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:29.200]  eventually break communities down into sustainable mega cities, a one world system that will
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:34.800]  follow the implementation of the United Nations Strong Cities Network, replacing our local
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:39.880]  police forces, but watering down or complete elimination of the Second Amendment.
[02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:45.440]  Under the enforcement of Secretary of State, John Kerry's signing of the Small Arms Treaty
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:52.040]  and an engineered global depression, United Nations manipulation of the human population
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:58.200]  has become a very stark reality, a reality you won't be hearing about from the mainstream
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:00.760]  media until it's too late.
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:02.760]  John Bown for Infowars.com.
[02:39:02.760 --> 02:39:07.960]  John Bown is so amazing, I just love him.
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:12.480]  He is so just on target cutting through and on his dad won Peabody's as a major journalist
[02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:13.480]  as well.
[02:39:13.480 --> 02:39:14.480]  It's in the blood.
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:18.120]  But if you look at this, we live under UN control.
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:20.400]  But the globalist people say, oh, the UN doesn't run America.
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:21.400]  Well, that's true.
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:25.040]  The globalist robber barons, a hundred and something years ago getting their butt kicks
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:29.920]  by the American people, they wouldn't created it, gave it the land to transfer power to
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:33.240]  it and then have it dictate to us.
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:37.520]  And that's why the Justice Department is announced, oh, we're going to move quote minorities basically
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:42.040]  forcibly because they're on welfare to your rural area, build a big building and then
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:47.840]  just create all this strife and make everyone be quote racially based.
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:51.880]  So you wonder how they'll put us on these compact controlled areas.
[02:39:51.880 --> 02:39:55.520]  They'll bring people in white, black, it doesn't matter who are dependent on the system who
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:59.840]  will then vote in your local government to sign over local control of all the land by
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:06.440]  voting to the UN and to the globalist and the big banks, the big insurance companies,
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:10.440]  the big building companies, they're all basically exempt from all this.
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:11.440]  God help us.
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:14.920]  See, it's about what group you're in and where you live will be equitable and we're
[02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:20.000]  going to integrate your houses and Germany a few years ago banned any new construction
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:25.800]  of single parent homes because she or not single parent single family homes because
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:28.120]  families are bad.
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:32.840]  Imagine they're saying you can't have a house with your kids and you what because that's
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:36.560]  a unit, that's allegiance, that's people together.
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:40.800]  They already banned men in the house for black people if you want welfare and look at that
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:46.080]  to that community and now they're banning families for everybody and they got a Gardasil
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:51.400]  shot especially for Hispanics because they love you so much and want you to inherit America.
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:53.280]  Don't take the shot if you do.
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:54.880]  I mean these people are so evil.
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:58.800]  All right, I want to go to your calls, I said I go to your calls and I've got a bunch of
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:03.520]  health news, a bunch more doctors coming out, even Democrats you name it saying Hillary
[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:09.040]  is obviously got serious neurological problems probably from a brain tumor.
[02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:11.040]  That's the only thing that does stuff like this.
[02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:14.320]  We're going to go to Mark who's been holding, we're going to go to Jennifer, we're going
[02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:15.960]  to go, who's been holding the longest.
[02:41:15.960 --> 02:41:19.360]  Karen's been holding the longest, then I'm just going to go, Kevin, Ron, Jennifer, Mark,
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:20.360]  thanks for holding.
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:21.360]  Karen you're on the year, welcome.
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:27.560]  Yes, first I want to preface that my father was a World War II hero and we share the same
[02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:36.480]  grandfather that George Washington had and so we have been very patriotic.
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:42.760]  I'm a strong Trump supporter and I am a Mormon and I'm very upset about the fact that there's
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:49.400]  so many sites saying that the Mormons are against Trump, it's not true, almost everyone
[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:55.920]  I know is for Trump but they could use that when they cheat in Utah, you know, to say
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:42:04.320]  all the Mormons I know are supporting Trump, I wouldn't call Glenn Beck a real Mormon and
[02:42:04.320 --> 02:42:06.720]  all the rest of it, I totally agree it's a red herring.
[02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:09.600]  They're getting folks ready to basically steal Utah.
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:10.600]  I agree with your statement.
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:17.680]  The thing that I'm very concerned about is the immigration and they are, we had Catholic
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:21.000]  charities come in to tell us how we could serve the immigrants.
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:24.400]  By the way, I'm not bashing Catholics but if you want to talk about who's manipulating
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:29.320]  this election, it's the Pope and that Jesuit Communist New World Order, Tim Kaine.
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:35.440]  The problem is they're giving money to these organizations, these charities, to bring them
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:38.440]  in.
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:44.880]  I tried to get a place for a homeless citizen, a young lady, and they said she had to go
[02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:45.880]  to a homeless shelter.
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:50.400]  I said, do you mean they take precedence over a citizen?
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:54.360]  Well, yeah, they've been in camp for a very long time.
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:55.360]  They're giving them everything.
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:43:00.320]  I know, but again, and these poor illegals are running desperate, collapsed countries
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:05.800]  that the globalist literally came in and gutted using the same technology the last 50 years.
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:08.080]  We are all victims of the New World Order.
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:09.440]  The problem is it doesn't matter.
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:10.440]  These people are like water.
[02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:11.440]  I need water to live.
[02:43:11.440 --> 02:43:12.440]  I love water.
[02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:15.280]  But if the dam breaks, it's going to kill me if I'm down in the valley.
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:18.360]  So these poor illegals, everybody, they're just desperate.
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:20.880]  They're flooding and we're going to be knocked over by it.
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:24.000]  How do we somehow wake them up?
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.400]  I don't know, but it's an incredible situation we're facing.
[02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:28.720]  But Providence is here.
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:32.440]  People are waking up and we're facing a 21st century war.
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:36.440]  This is a technotronic, technocracy 21st century war.
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:37.520]  It's high tech.
[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:42.480]  But if folks will just learn about it, like they do about football or baseball, people
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:43.480]  have the smarts.
[02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:44.480]  We can defeat it.
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:48.080]  But people have to stop wargaming, fake stuff meant to take up your time like crossword
[02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:49.800]  puzzles and the NFL.
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:51.600]  You got to start wargaming this, OK?
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:55.960]  I know a lot of men, they're just as smart as I am or smarter, but they're just locked
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:43:57.400]  in their own little fantasy land.
[02:43:57.400 --> 02:43:58.640]  Same thing for women.
[02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:01.280]  You've got to decide you want to be part of this historic fight.
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:06.760]  You've got to decide, no matter what color the pigment of your skin is, you want humanity
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:08.040]  to succeed.
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:11.320]  You want to cut through all this scientific BS.
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:12.560]  The globalists are arrogant, folks.
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:13.560]  They're going to lose.
[02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:15.680]  They're going to lose.
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:17.440]  There's 7.5 billion people.
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:20.200]  If 5% are awake to this, it's game over.
[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:23.320]  You've already got more than that, OK?
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:26.200]  That's why they're panicking right now.
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:31.920]  And human populations can flip-flop very quickly away from globalism.
[02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:32.920]  That's how humans work.
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:38.280]  It will seem like 5% are awake and then suddenly, boom, half the population wakes up in a day.
[02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:42.960]  That's why the New World Order is, I'm telling you, freaking out.
[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:46.880]  Roger Stone is an incredible pessimist and he is privately and publicly telling me this
[02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:50.240]  is history, total route of the enemy happening right now.
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:54.400]  Now, they might set off a nuke, folks, in a major city and blame it on the patriots.
[02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:57.720]  Anything's possible, but no one's going to buy it.
[02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:03.360]  It's going to be a rough road, but the beginning of the end of the New World Order has begun.
[02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:04.360]  Thank you, Karen.
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:06.440]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:08.400]  Who's up next?
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:11.240]  Kevin in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:15.240]  Next, I just want to thank you for everything you're doing, man.
[02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:16.240]  Great job.
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:18.880]  I've got a little theory to bounce off of you.
[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:21.440]  First of all, I think Hillary is really sick.
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:25.920]  I think Hillary's camp has known about her health for a long time.
[02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:30.680]  And I think that they just know that they just felt that she would be more electable
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:31.680]  than Cain.
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:35.720]  So, the plan was to use her to get Cain elected from the very beginning.
[02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:38.040]  No, I think that's the crowd source in common sense.
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:39.040]  I think you're right.
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:40.040]  I think that was the old plan.
[02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:44.040]  Now, she's so discredited, though, and the media is so discredited that they think she's
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:45.040]  going to lose now.
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:49.680]  So, what do they do next?
[02:45:49.680 --> 02:45:53.400]  I don't know what that...
[02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:56.560]  I hope that Michelle Obama's not on the table.
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:02.480]  I just kind of threw up a little bit in my mouth when I even thought about that.
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:08.480]  But I don't know what they do, but I know it's going to involve lying and deception.
[02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:09.480]  You're absolutely right.
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:13.480]  What else is on your mind, my friend?
[02:46:13.480 --> 02:46:21.040]  Well, I'm just spreading the word, you know, I've been spending a lot of time on forums
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:28.600]  and stuff and inviting people to check out info wars and become a patriot and basically
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:30.200]  just sounding the horn.
[02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:31.200]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:32.760]  I want to be clear about something.
[02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:36.960]  Even if you just love God and don't want to hurt innocent people and aren't out to get
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:39.120]  folks, you're a patriot and God loves you.
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:41.000]  Patriot just means you're pro-human.
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:42.000]  You're pro.
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:43.000]  They'll say patriarch.
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:48.760]  I mean, that just means you're pro the order that humans have set up, that God's set up.
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:50.440]  That's what a patriot is.
[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:53.560]  A patriot is not out to get people.
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:57.000]  It means the right hand, basically, if you want to get into the occult, the Illuminati,
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:58.160]  they're all the left hand path.
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:05.440]  But if you look at this, we are at an incredible moment right now.
[02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:10.680]  And make no mistake, no one's going to tell you the great job you've done.
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:13.280]  You're not going to get a pat on the back from the mainstream media.
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:15.600]  You're going to just feel like you're out there on your own, warning people, and some
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:17.600]  of them laugh at you or whatever.
[02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:19.880]  They're doing that because they're scared, brother, but I'm going to tell you something
[02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:20.880]  right now.
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:25.640]  It is you, the men and women of every color, every creed, I'm not going to say race, we're
[02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:30.640]  all the same race, that know the truth, that are already moving mountains.
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:34.280]  You're not just part of the info war, brother, you're it.
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:37.440]  When you take action, when you spread the word, when you speak up, when you hit your
[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:42.040]  knees and pray to God, it moves mountains.
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:45.000]  The enemy is panicking right now because you are on the move.
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:48.040]  Just know you're not famous, so you don't know that.
[02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:52.400]  You don't have that perspective, believe it, believe it.
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:55.840]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:47:55.840 --> 02:48:00.480]  Let's talk to Jennifer in the great state of Texas, now under FEMA Region 6.
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:01.480]  Go ahead.
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:02.480]  Hi.
[02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:04.000]  I'm a person with epilepsy.
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:07.600]  I am also a person who has had viral pneumonia.
[02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:11.040]  Now when I had viral pneumonia, I had to go to the emergency room.
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:18.200]  There was testing, which took time, had a hospital observation, medication, I was in bed like
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:20.440]  10 years ago for a week with it.
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:21.440]  Right.
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:26.680]  And I was told, do not go out into public, maintain as much distance between yourself
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:31.040]  and your young daughter as possible, cough into tissues.
[02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:36.400]  They've seen Hillary cough into her bare hands, and I think the reason they wanted to avoid
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:42.280]  the emergency room was because it would have demonstrated she does not have pneumonia.
[02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:50.200]  Now to the epilepsy, I have no doubt in my mind that Hillary Clinton has epilepsy as
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:59.040]  a result of the neurological medical emergencies she has experienced with my users before and
[02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:07.760]  then also post-dictal after seizures, I have extreme imbalance, states of confusion, difficulty
[02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:16.440]  communicating, recognizing March of last year, I had a tonic-clonic seizures known as grand
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:23.640]  mall, and when I was in a post-dictal period, they asked me, who is this man in the room
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:24.800]  with you?
[02:49:24.800 --> 02:49:25.800]  I don't know.
[02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:28.160]  It was my husband who's 24 years.
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:31.480]  I didn't know who I was, I didn't know who he was.
[02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:36.360]  Another concern is there is something called SUDEP, which is sudden unexpected death of
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:37.360]  epileptic patient.
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:38.360]  Well, that's right.
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:44.240]  I mean, I've had two family members, one I'm so alive, that got epileptic type symptoms
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:49.600]  from trauma, one from a motorcycle wreck, one from falling off a building when there's
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:54.560]  a little kid playing with other kids, and I've sat there so many times when they start
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:58.200]  having a beginning of a seizure, I guess a petty mall or whatever they call it, and I've
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:49:59.200]  seen them have the big ones.
[02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:00.400]  I've seen the head go in the circle.
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:05.480]  I mean, everybody who's had family that's epileptic knows or coworkers what this looks
[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:11.920]  like, and the media telling us we're idiots, I mean, it really discredits them.
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:17.400]  Another concern with her being incapacitated is, are we going to have a situation like
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:20.400]  Woodrow Wilson's turn, where we have a stop.
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:24.800]  It's for a year where he was out of control and we had Edward Mandel health running stuff.
[02:50:24.800 --> 02:50:27.200]  Right, and his wife.
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:32.480]  So are we going to have a situation where Bill Clinton and a close aide, Uma Abedin,
[02:50:32.480 --> 02:50:38.320]  which might be a Valerie Jarrett type figure, are they going to be operating the executive
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:39.320]  branch?
[02:50:39.320 --> 02:50:40.320]  Another fabulous point.
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:41.320]  We're out of time, Jennifer.
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:43.040]  Glad you held to say that.
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:44.760]  I'm going to come back and play a few clips.
[02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:50.000]  Got more doctors coming out and talking about something seriously wrong with this lady.
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:56.720]  And then we are going to go to Mark and Phil, Tony, Danny, and others, and then David Knight
[02:50:56.720 --> 02:50:59.680]  and Leanne Mack, and they're going to be taken over as well.
[02:50:59.680 --> 02:51:02.080]  I'm Alex Jones in FullWars.com.
[02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:06.240]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food.
[02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:11.120]  Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable, good for 25 years, survival food on hand
[02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:12.480]  in case of an emergency.
[02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:17.760]  Well, right now, in what is truly an unprecedented move, 72-hour survival food kits are being

[02:51:25.440 --> 02:51:26.440]  for the company.
[02:51:26.440 --> 02:51:30.040]  Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other threats can make obtaining sufficient
[02:51:30.040 --> 02:51:32.840]  food impossible in an emergency.
[02:51:32.840 --> 02:51:38.920]  This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious food rated for 25 years of storage.

[02:52:02.560 --> 02:52:06.680]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated
[02:52:06.680 --> 02:52:11.800]  with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines,
[02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:14.720]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[02:52:14.720 --> 02:52:19.360]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[02:54:12.760 --> 02:54:15.960]  by another one of our great anchors or researchers, long times I call those.
[02:54:15.960 --> 02:54:19.840]  I'll be 15 or 20 minutes in the next hour because there's this rush of pieces exclusive
[02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:25.280]  to the United States that we've had translated by Daria into English dealing with their view
[02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:29.240]  on the election and threats to Donald Trump, will he be assassinated, so that's coming
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:34.800]  up if your station doesn't carry it, infowars.com forward slash show, you can find the free
[02:54:34.800 --> 02:54:39.960]  audio and video feeds, and see this exclusive report we're about to premiere from Russia
[02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:44.480]  One, state run media over there, and I'll continue with your calls as well, but I should
[02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:46.160]  have covered this at the very start of the show.
[02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:50.640]  We had Dr. Drew come out a few weeks ago and say, the medicines he's got are on a killer
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:54.160]  and the guy's not even a conservative, this is crazy, I want to talk to Hillary, I want
[02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:55.160]  to help her.
[02:54:55.160 --> 02:54:59.320]  One of the top board certifying doctors out there, I mean he's a doctor's doctor, boom
[02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:00.320]  fire.
[02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:02.800]  Well will Sanjay Gupta get fired?
[02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:06.280]  He said we still don't know a lot of things about Hillary Clinton and we need to know,
[02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:10.720]  but we've got a prominent Muslim American MD, he was on Newsmax TV, said Hillary didn't
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:15.360]  pass out from dehydration, and he says the same thing that Dr. Steve Pachennick and others
[02:55:15.360 --> 02:55:19.680]  have said, and other medical doctors that are very close to me, I'll leave it at that,
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:22.960]  they don't want to go on air because this country is in so much trouble, they're scared
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:28.080]  to saying look, it's brain tumor, or it's major heart trouble, the word is it's tumors
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:32.440]  in her lungs and which affects the heart and the brain, but let's go ahead and play this
[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:40.000]  clip of Dr. Zudia Jasser with Steven Maseberg, here it is.
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:45.080]  As an internist I do this every day, and pneumonia is a disease that presents not only with cough
[02:55:45.080 --> 02:55:50.600]  but fevers, chills and other things, if she was passing, what she had was a syncopal episode,
[02:55:50.600 --> 02:55:56.160]  she passed out, that's either cardiovascular or neurologic, now her team wants us to believe
[02:55:56.160 --> 02:56:00.520]  that this is dehydration, she didn't appear to be dehydrated and that doesn't get fixed
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:06.440]  in 90 minutes, so I can tell you that it really appears, and if I let a patient with syncope
[02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:12.240]  leave my office and not get admitted and get evaluated immediately, that would be malpractice,
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:16.240]  so there's something going on, I mean even if you look at the reaction of her assistance
[02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:20.840]  when she passed out, it almost seemed to appear something they've been familiar with, nobody
[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:25.720]  was really shocked that she was buckling and her knees were buckling because of her symptoms,
[02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:30.160]  chronic cerebral vascular accidents, strokes that she's had before that are just exacerbated
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:38.000]  when she gets ill, or at some type of neurologic condition, or she had some underlying cardiovascular
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:42.960]  disease, either atrial fibrillation or heart failure that keeps presenting itself, so the
[02:56:42.960 --> 02:56:50.000]  reason we are speculating is because, just like Dr. Ben Carson said earlier today, she
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:56.320]  has a disease of dishonesty, and on the anniversary of Ben Ghazi she had a health episode that
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:00.280]  the American people deserve to know what the reality is, and I think any physician worth
[02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:04.320]  their salt knows that people don't pass out from pneumonia but from other things either
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:08.520]  well that's right, and again it's not pneumonia that she's just got, so that's newsmax.com,
[02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:14.320]  I'm going to get that going, please get that going guys and ladies, to the crew, and I've
[02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:18.920]  got like four more clips, it's like every day there's just all these doctors coming out,
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:23.720]  70 plus percent of one of the biggest surgeon, you know, and doctor organization in the country
[02:57:23.720 --> 02:57:29.120]  says clearly there's something wrong with her, folks, the secret service said hey we
[02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:34.560]  got information from you, for you, I'm standing there with guys in their suits at the RNC
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:39.280]  and I'm like okay, and my gut was this is for real, they're all smiling at us and everything,
[02:57:39.280 --> 02:57:43.640]  you know the truth, I'm like well here's Joe Biggs, here's Joe, you handle it, and one
[02:57:43.640 --> 02:57:47.120]  that was even scarier than the secret service is just like, you know, you get exhausted
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:49.600]  getting all these leaks, I said here Joe, you want to handle it, you do it because Joe
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:54.120]  was all excited, they contact us, they tell us she's falling down more than once an hour,
[02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:56.440]  we don't know what it is, but they're going to have to make an announcement, I mean this
[02:57:56.440 --> 02:58:01.000]  is getting bad, she is falling apart, we've got special vehicles forward, you know, we've
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:04.000]  got to just come to the event, you'll see what we're talking about, we went, it was
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:10.240]  true, they didn't lie to us, and now it's clearly getting worse by the minute, we're
[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:13.040]  going to go to break, we've got more of these clips, I want to take some calls, I want to
[02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:16.560]  get to this Russia piece, your station doesn't carry the fourth hour, I hope they would,
[02:58:16.560 --> 02:58:21.120]  be sure and support them and their sponsorship, make a donation to your local stations, but

[02:58:47.760 --> 02:58:56.320]  radio network, more than two years ago, infohours first told you about our research into what
[02:58:56.320 --> 02:59:00.520]  has been called the iodine conspiracy, I've told you about how scientists have known for
[02:59:00.520 --> 02:59:06.000]  decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started
[02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:10.880]  taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family into
[02:59:10.880 --> 02:59:15.440]  the water, they took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the
[02:59:15.440 --> 02:59:20.280]  Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how
[02:59:20.280 --> 02:59:26.080]  to prepare yourself and your family, now in 2016 even more information has been revealed
[02:59:26.080 --> 02:59:31.480]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying
[02:59:31.480 --> 02:59:36.200]  could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine, you can pull these studies up for
[02:59:36.200 --> 02:59:41.120]  yourself, this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view

[03:00:13.280 --> 03:00:34.280]  information war, it's Alex Jones, mother, what they mean, what they say, mother, can

[03:01:33.280 --> 03:01:36.280]  We came to run you over or die trying.

[03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:06.280]  Yeah, let's call talk shows.
[03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:11.280]  I want everyone to set their watch from five to seven on Mondays
[03:02:11.280 --> 03:02:13.280]  and call K-Fax.
[03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:18.280]  I was talking to the talk show host on K-Fax on Mondays from five to seven
[03:02:18.280 --> 03:02:24.280]  about what Hillary said about you and call all talk shows listeners
[03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:29.280]  and you may or may not want to say that you want to talk about Alex.
[03:02:29.280 --> 03:02:31.280]  Well, I should point out you're on K-O-M-Y.
[03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:33.280]  You think the station wants you to plug another station?
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:35.280]  Well, I guess that's a Santa Cruz.
[03:02:35.280 --> 03:02:38.280]  But what just call and point out that we don't spew racism here?
[03:02:38.280 --> 03:02:40.280]  We spew the opposite?
[03:02:41.280 --> 03:02:42.280]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:46.280]  Look, one month ago, I was knocking on doors here in San Jose
[03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:49.280]  being very polite, just saying good morning, ma'am or sir.
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:52.280]  Would you please tune your radio to K-O-M-Y 1340?
[03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:54.280]  And I did that for maybe an hour and a half.
[03:02:54.280 --> 03:02:57.280]  And then the cops showed up and then I says,
[03:02:57.280 --> 03:02:59.280]  well, that's all I'm doing, officer.
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:02.280]  I'm knocking on people's doors and then asking them to call three or four people
[03:03:02.280 --> 03:03:03.280]  to tune in.
[03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:06.280]  That is free speech. You're not selling anything.
[03:03:06.280 --> 03:03:10.280]  Their ordinances cannot stop you from free speech knocking on doors.
[03:03:10.280 --> 03:03:11.280]  Exactly.
[03:03:11.280 --> 03:03:14.280]  And this is big time because, Hillary, think about this.
[03:03:14.280 --> 03:03:16.280]  What you're doing is so beautiful.
[03:03:16.280 --> 03:03:18.280]  You're doing what Nigel Farage said.
[03:03:18.280 --> 03:03:19.280]  Put the walking boots on.
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:20.280]  Get in the streets.
[03:03:20.280 --> 03:03:22.280]  That's what'll defeat them.
[03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:23.280]  Exactly.
[03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:27.280]  Well, the cops ashamed of themselves trying to voice an anti-free speech
[03:03:27.280 --> 03:03:28.280]  because I've met the Santa Cruz cops.
[03:03:28.280 --> 03:03:31.280]  A lot of them seem like they're pretty awake.
[03:03:31.280 --> 03:03:33.280]  Oh yeah, they are.
[03:03:33.280 --> 03:03:35.280]  And it worked out for good because I drove down Meridian,
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:38.280]  hit every Starbucks and coffee shop and they just walked in and said,
[03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:41.280]  folks, I have a brief announcement to make.
[03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:46.280]  Tune your radio to K-O-M-Y 1340 right now or info wars on your computer.
[03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:50.280]  And cause this guy's interviewing Roger Stone who got Trump to run.
[03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:52.280]  This is big time information.
[03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:55.280]  See, Roger Stone, remember when he said that a couple of weeks ago?
[03:03:55.280 --> 03:03:58.280]  He says, I'm the one that got Roger Stone to, I mean,
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:01.280]  No, that's true. I mean, Stone's the one of the key guys.
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:05.280]  He's very humble about it, but it is true that Stone got him to run in 2002.
[03:04:05.280 --> 03:04:06.280]  So yeah.
[03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:07.280]  Yeah.
[03:04:07.280 --> 03:04:08.280]  But I mean, think about it.
[03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:13.280]  Hillary said that you actually thought Oklahoma City was an inside job.
[03:04:13.280 --> 03:04:14.280]  Well, wait a minute.
[03:04:14.280 --> 03:04:16.280]  I think it was Alex Jones, not Rush Limbaugh,
[03:04:16.280 --> 03:04:20.280]  that interviewed Don Brown and Craig Roberts, Terence Yakey.
[03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:22.280]  I'm interviewing all the cops, everybody.
[03:04:22.280 --> 03:04:23.280]  They know the names of the feds.
[03:04:23.280 --> 03:04:26.280]  They caught him planting the bombs for God's sakes.
[03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:29.280]  I mean, let me tell you, the Clintons bombed Oklahoma City.
[03:04:29.280 --> 03:04:30.280]  They should get it straight.
[03:04:30.280 --> 03:04:31.280]  The Clintons, not America.
[03:04:31.280 --> 03:04:34.280]  They always go, he says America bombed Oklahoma City.
[03:04:34.280 --> 03:04:35.280]  No, the Clintons did.
[03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:37.280]  He says America.
[03:04:37.280 --> 03:04:38.280]  I've been on shows.
[03:04:38.280 --> 03:04:41.280]  They go, you say the New York police bomb the World Trade Center.
[03:04:41.280 --> 03:04:44.280]  I said, criminals in our government allied with radical Islam.
[03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:45.280]  Did it.
[03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:47.280]  And they stood down and nor was ordered to stand down.
[03:04:47.280 --> 03:04:49.280]  I had that from the sources at the time.
[03:04:49.280 --> 03:04:53.280]  It's all in the news now, but they always misrepresent.
[03:04:53.280 --> 03:04:55.280]  They build strong men.
[03:04:55.280 --> 03:04:56.280]  That's all they can do.
[03:04:56.280 --> 03:04:57.280]  Stay with us.
[03:04:57.280 --> 03:04:58.280]  We'll be back with the big Russian edition.
[03:04:58.280 --> 03:05:27.280]  This is big.
[03:05:28.280 --> 03:05:54.280]  We'll be back with the big Russian edition.

[03:53:01.280 --> 03:53:03.280]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, the inventor of my pillow.
[03:53:03.280 --> 03:53:06.280]  And like all of you out there, I had problems sleeping.
[03:53:06.280 --> 03:53:07.280]  Pillows would go flat.
[03:53:07.280 --> 03:53:09.280]  I would flip flop all night long.
[03:53:09.280 --> 03:53:11.280]  I would wake up with a sore neck, maybe a headache,
[03:53:11.280 --> 03:53:14.280]  or feel like I needed a nap even though I slept eight hours.
[03:53:14.280 --> 03:53:17.280]  When I invented my pillow, I wanted it to where you can move the patented fill
[03:53:17.280 --> 03:53:22.280]  to give you the exact support you need as an individual, regardless of sleep position.
[03:53:22.280 --> 03:53:26.280]  My pillow will get you into that deep REM sleep faster and you will stay there longer.
[03:53:26.280 --> 03:53:28.280]  It's not about how much time we spend in bed.
[03:53:28.280 --> 03:53:30.280]  It's about how much of that quality sleep we get.
[03:53:30.280 --> 03:53:33.280]  I do all of my own manufacturing right here in the United States.
[03:53:33.280 --> 03:53:35.280]  I have a 10-year warranty.
[03:53:35.280 --> 03:53:39.280]  You can wash and dry my pillow and I give you a 60-day money back guarantee
[03:53:39.280 --> 03:53:41.280]  so you have nothing to lose.
[03:53:41.280 --> 03:53:43.280]  And here's my best opera ever.
[03:53:43.280 --> 03:53:45.280]  You can buy one of my pillows and get one absolutely free.

[03:54:08.280 --> 03:54:14.280]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:54:14.280 --> 03:54:15.280]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:15.280 --> 03:54:17.280]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[03:54:17.280 --> 03:54:20.280]  This is our last segment and in this thing I want you to understand tonight
[03:54:20.280 --> 03:54:24.280]  we have an end to a lot of very big specials we've been running for a while.
[03:54:24.280 --> 03:54:27.280]  Of course, there's our mega specials on preparedness.
[03:54:27.280 --> 03:54:30.280]  That's going to be ending tonight at our infowarstore.com.
[03:54:30.280 --> 03:54:34.280]  30-40% off all infowar select storeable food.
[03:54:34.280 --> 03:54:35.280]  That ends tonight.
[03:54:35.280 --> 03:54:36.280]  30-40% off.
[03:54:36.280 --> 03:54:39.280]  That's a huge discount off of infowar select storeable food.
[03:54:39.280 --> 03:54:41.280]  This is non-GMO food.
[03:54:41.280 --> 03:54:43.280]  It has a 25-year shelf life.
[03:54:43.280 --> 03:54:48.280]  It's all made and packaged in the United States as well as resealable.
[03:54:48.280 --> 03:54:55.280]  Once you open this up, you can reseal it to be able to preserve it for a little bit extended time.
[03:54:55.280 --> 03:55:00.280]  But once you keep that sealed, it is good for 25 years without preservatives, without GMOs.
[03:55:00.280 --> 03:55:05.280]  Also, 20% off survival shield X2 nascent iodine, 20% off Alexa pure air filters,
[03:55:05.280 --> 03:55:09.280]  and 20% off Alexa pure water filters.
[03:55:09.280 --> 03:55:14.280]  All that will be ending tonight as well as the Mr. Rachel Maddow specials.
[03:55:14.280 --> 03:55:20.280]  Again, 20% off survival shield X2 nascent iodine, 15% off survival male vitality,
[03:55:20.280 --> 03:55:22.280]  and 15% off deep cleanse.
[03:55:22.280 --> 03:55:28.280]  All of those preparedness mega specials at infowarstore.com as well as the other products
[03:55:28.280 --> 03:55:33.280]  that we did in honor of Rachel Maddow's plugging our products the other day on our show at infowarslife.com.
[03:55:33.280 --> 03:55:36.280]  Those are all going to be ending tonight.
[03:55:36.280 --> 03:55:39.280]  So this is the last day that you'll be able to take advantage of those specials.
[03:55:39.280 --> 03:55:41.280]  So we thank you for your support.
[03:55:41.280 --> 03:55:46.280]  Thank you for supporting us, and we try to offer the very best products we can to support your health.
[03:55:46.280 --> 03:55:48.280]  We're serious about this.
[03:55:48.280 --> 03:55:54.280]  We do the best we can to offer you the best quality products, and we really do appreciate your support.
[03:55:54.280 --> 03:55:57.280]  That's how we fund our organization, not like MSNBC.
[03:55:57.280 --> 03:55:59.280]  We don't take money from Big Pharma.
[03:55:59.280 --> 03:56:01.280]  We don't take money from the government.
[03:56:01.280 --> 03:56:04.280]  We try to offer you in a capitalist kind of way.
[03:56:04.280 --> 03:56:08.280]  It's a win-win situation, as Alex Jones says, a 360 win.
[03:56:08.280 --> 03:56:13.280]  You've got a story about what's going on with sugar and the way that they manipulate the information.
[03:56:13.280 --> 03:56:17.280]  Yeah, you can't trust Rachel Maddow to tell you about Hillary Clinton's health.
[03:56:17.280 --> 03:56:20.280]  So truly, you can't trust a lot of even researchers out there.
[03:56:20.280 --> 03:56:28.280]  The science says, well, here now it's been revealed just this week in the JAMA internal medicine, the journal.
[03:56:28.280 --> 03:56:37.280]  They released some research from the 60s that show that Harvard researchers had been bribed by the sugar industry
[03:56:37.280 --> 03:56:43.280]  to say that heart disease was actually caused more so by fat, not sugar.
[03:56:43.280 --> 03:56:47.280]  So this is heart disease. It's like the top killer in the United States.
[03:56:47.280 --> 03:56:56.280]  But in order to protect the sugar industry, they recommissioned a new review of this research to say that it was fat, not sugar.
[03:56:56.280 --> 03:57:05.280]  And then, of course, we've just seen sugar catapult into every single meal that's out there, especially for children, since the 60s.
[03:57:05.280 --> 03:57:09.280]  I mean, so then you wonder why heart disease could be the top killer.
[03:57:09.280 --> 03:57:12.280]  I mean, this just shockwaves through the research community.
[03:57:12.280 --> 03:57:20.280]  Well, you know, we saw back in the 1960s, we saw doctors cutting commercials for tobacco companies saying, you know, I can't even remember the commercials.
[03:57:20.280 --> 03:57:26.280]  More doctors prefer this brand over brand X, you know, all these smoking doctors and everything.
[03:57:26.280 --> 03:57:28.280]  This one will kill you quicker.
[03:57:28.280 --> 03:57:34.280]  Yeah, and, you know, quite frankly, I mean, it was they accelerated the unhealthy situation with it by the things that they added to it.
[03:57:34.280 --> 03:57:41.280]  All these filters and menthols and all these other chemicals that they added to tobacco made it a lot more dangerous than it had ever been.
[03:57:41.280 --> 03:57:43.280]  But, yeah, we see that all the time.
[03:57:43.280 --> 03:57:49.280]  And we, I guess, what's happened now, because there's a big campaign to, there we go, there's the doctors.
[03:57:49.280 --> 03:57:51.280]  The cigarette. Preferred by doctors.
[03:57:51.280 --> 03:57:54.280]  Yeah, this is the healthy cigarette.
[03:57:54.280 --> 03:57:59.280]  We talk to John Wayne, which we've talked to John Wayne about that, unfortunately, we can't.
[03:57:59.280 --> 03:58:07.280]  But, yeah, that's what we see over and over again is, and I guess what's happened now, that sugar has become the ultimate demon.
[03:58:07.280 --> 03:58:11.280]  Of course, the issue is not even fat or sugar. It's obesity.
[03:58:11.280 --> 03:58:12.280]  Right.
[03:58:12.280 --> 03:58:14.280]  And that has a lot of different factors. It's very complex.
[03:58:14.280 --> 03:58:17.280]  But they use the government. They have regulatory capture.
[03:58:17.280 --> 03:58:21.280]  It's not just universities that are captured by this stuff.
[03:58:21.280 --> 03:58:23.280]  We see this happening all the time.
[03:58:23.280 --> 03:58:27.280]  But I guess the sugar industry didn't pay up for their political protection.
[03:58:27.280 --> 03:58:29.280]  That's why Obama and the rest of them are coming after it.
[03:58:29.280 --> 03:58:31.280]  Finally, let me be disclassified.
[03:58:31.280 --> 03:58:37.280]  That's right. You're going to be doing the Info Wars Nightly News Night, 7th Central, 8pm Eastern. Join Leanne McAdoo. I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo.
[03:58:37.280 --> 03:59:02.280]  That's it for today's broadcast.
