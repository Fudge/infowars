[00:00.000 --> 00:19.520]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones well North
[00:19.520 --> 00:24.000]  Korea you say they're gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb above ground somewhere in
[00:24.000 --> 00:28.640]  the Pacific Ocean just begging to be destroyed and Trump is announcing new
[00:28.640 --> 00:33.400]  sanctions as this crisis goes stratospheric and possibly thermal
[00:33.400 --> 00:38.840]  nuclear here is the president's announcement earlier today thank you
[00:38.840 --> 00:41.200]  very much
[00:52.120 --> 00:58.080]  today I'm announcing a new executive order just signed that significantly
[00:58.080 --> 01:05.280]  expands our authorities to target individuals companies financial
[01:05.280 --> 01:13.480]  institutions that finance and facilitate trade with North Korea as I
[01:13.480 --> 01:20.080]  outlined at my address to the United Nations General Assembly North Korea's
[01:20.080 --> 01:25.240]  nuclear weapons and missile development is a grave threat to peace and
[01:25.240 --> 01:31.200]  security in our world and it is unacceptable that others financially
[01:31.200 --> 01:39.240]  support this criminal rogue regime the brutal North Korean regime does not
[01:39.240 --> 01:46.320]  respect its own citizens or the sovereignty of other nations our new
[01:46.320 --> 01:50.720]  executive order will cut off sources of revenue that fund North Korea's efforts
[01:50.720 --> 01:58.760]  to develop the deadliest weapons known to humankind the order enhances the
[01:58.760 --> 02:03.560]  Treasury Department's authorities to target any individual or entity that
[02:03.560 --> 02:09.440]  conducts significant trade in good services or technology with North Korea
[02:09.440 --> 02:16.120]  and I'm very proud to tell you that as you may have just heard moments ago
[02:16.120 --> 02:24.520]  China their central bank has told their other banks that's a massive banking
[02:24.520 --> 02:31.200]  system to immediately stop doing business with North Korea it's just
[02:31.200 --> 02:38.960]  happened just reported in addition to everything else what we will do is
[02:38.960 --> 02:44.720]  identify new industries including textiles fishing information technology
[02:44.720 --> 02:51.320]  and manufacturing that the Treasury Department can target with strong
[02:51.320 --> 02:58.480]  sanctions and Secretary Mnuchin is representing the Treasury Department is
[02:58.480 --> 03:04.180]  here today to prevent sanctions evasion the order also includes measures
[03:04.180 --> 03:09.800]  designed to disrupt critical North Korean shipping and trade networks for
[03:09.800 --> 03:13.480]  much too long North Korea has been allowed to abuse the international
[03:13.480 --> 03:18.760]  financial system to facilitate funding for its nuclear weapons and missile
[03:18.760 --> 03:24.080]  programs the United States has had representatives working on this problem
[03:24.080 --> 03:28.480]  for over 25 years they have done nothing that's why we're in the problem that
[03:28.480 --> 03:33.000]  we're in today in addition to frankly other countries not doing what they
[03:33.000 --> 03:40.960]  should have done tolerance for this disgraceful practice must end now our
[03:40.960 --> 03:44.920]  new order will give the Treasury Department the discretion to sanction
[03:44.920 --> 03:49.840]  any foreign bank that knowingly conducts or facilitate significant
[03:49.840 --> 03:58.000]  transactions tied to trade with North Korea and again I want to just say and
[03:58.000 --> 04:06.400]  thank President Xi of China for the very bold move he made today that was a
[04:06.400 --> 04:11.640]  somewhat unexpected move and we appreciate it new authority in this
[04:11.640 --> 04:16.800]  area applies to any activity that occurs following my signature on the
[04:16.800 --> 04:21.360]  executive order which I have actually just signed foreign banks will face a
[04:21.360 --> 04:27.100]  clear choice do business with the United States or facilitate trade with the
[04:27.100 --> 04:33.360]  lawless regime in North Korea and they won't have so much trade this new order
[04:33.360 --> 04:38.840]  provides us with powerful new tools but I want to be clear the order targets
[04:38.840 --> 04:44.160]  only one country and that country is North Korea the regime can no longer
[04:44.160 --> 04:51.240]  count on others to facilitate its trade and banking activities many countries
[04:51.240 --> 04:55.040]  are working ladies and gentlemen again that's excerpts of a press conference

[09:26.360 --> 09:34.240]  September 2017 and we live in just an incredibly bizarre world I've talked a
[09:34.240 --> 09:40.320]  lot about this and even though North Korea threatening to test a hydrogen
[09:40.320 --> 09:46.560]  bomb above ground on an unnamed Pacific Island even though that is a real
[09:46.560 --> 09:52.760]  hallmark of World War three and the possible destruction of our planet the
[09:52.760 --> 10:00.680]  underlying cause of it is evil and 22 years ago on air I didn't talk like that
[10:00.680 --> 10:05.440]  10 years ago on air I didn't do that but the more research I do you just run
[10:05.440 --> 10:11.320]  into Satanist and pedophiles every time it's the same thing from China to Russia
[10:11.320 --> 10:17.240]  to the United States to Mexico it's the same thing powering the drug cartels in
[10:17.240 --> 10:23.280]  Mexico Satanism they're public about it it's the same thing powering the Vatican
[10:23.280 --> 10:30.680]  it's the same thing powering much of the CIA it is a bunch of weak scum trying
[10:30.680 --> 10:35.960]  to play God and trying to run our lives and I've talked about how with relish
[10:35.960 --> 10:48.920]  with extreme enjoyment with raptured delight all over Europe they're taking
[10:48.920 --> 10:54.360]  Protestant and Catholic and Orthodox churches that in many cases government
[10:54.360 --> 11:02.640]  sees they take them saying we're taking away your tax exemption and they house
[11:02.640 --> 11:09.140]  Muslims in them and then they have Islamic art displays and bring the
[11:09.140 --> 11:13.720]  school children there to Islamify them they don't take school children to
[11:13.720 --> 11:19.920]  churches and teach them about Christ they take them to Muslim churches that
[11:19.920 --> 11:27.240]  is churches that have been converted to Islamic brainwashing basis without
[11:27.240 --> 11:34.520]  looking I have a stack of this today that just shows up in my stack as the
[11:34.520 --> 11:39.680]  crew prints basically all the front page articles of more than 10 major news
[11:39.680 --> 11:43.440]  sites a day most the news when I come in and thumb through it I've already looked
[11:43.440 --> 11:50.160]  at it seen it but the conflict or stuff I hadn't seen just piles of it and then
[11:50.160 --> 11:56.640]  you get banning outdoor Oktoberfest in Germany then in Malaysia they ban
[11:56.640 --> 12:01.440]  beerfest because the Muslims will kill you but that's okay because you go out
[12:01.440 --> 12:05.440]  to a liberal demonstration they're handing a jibs out to women to wear them
[12:05.440 --> 12:11.800]  in solidarity and telling us how Islam is the best thing in the world when it's
[12:11.800 --> 12:18.400]  180 degrees the opposite of our Western culture and I've got a stack of news
[12:18.400 --> 12:23.360]  here we're in court in the US and Canada and Europe Muslims won't even stand up
[12:23.360 --> 12:29.720]  when they've attacked stabbed robbed killed people but it's gotten so bad the
[12:29.720 --> 12:35.480]  Muslim refugees working for Uber in London that they've banned Uber now
[12:35.480 --> 12:41.760]  because of hundreds of sexual assaults and I've got more same thing here in
[12:41.760 --> 12:48.720]  the US why is this happening because it is the culture of Islam that if you're
[12:48.720 --> 12:53.160]  not wearing a hood over your head you're fair game to be raped in Pakistan or
[12:53.160 --> 12:58.240]  Saudi Arabia or in Libya now that's been liberated from Qaddafi that you know
[12:58.240 --> 13:05.160]  basically banned the jib nor he's gone now and the jihadis are in and they have
[13:05.160 --> 13:09.560]  these women in bondage and there's the left telling you how great it is and
[13:09.560 --> 13:15.280]  sending schooner boats across every hour to ferry people into Italy 80 plus
[13:15.280 --> 13:22.480]  percent I've seen the videos more like a hundred percent military age men it is a
[13:22.480 --> 13:28.160]  takeover we've been taught to be totally wide open to have no immune system
[13:28.160 --> 13:32.120]  politically or culturally or spiritually and now we're being assaulted
[13:32.120 --> 13:39.160]  by authoritarianism based on a religious system so vicious so dangerous so
[13:39.160 --> 13:44.840]  unstable that it wrecks every country that's a hundred percent Muslim they
[13:44.840 --> 13:52.240]  can't stop killing each other because it's always the most radical who wants
[13:52.240 --> 13:57.360]  to identify themselves to separate themselves from the other Muslims so it
[13:57.360 --> 14:01.300]  gets more and more and more and more radical and it moves the peg in the
[14:01.300 --> 14:07.280]  Overton window so far into extremism that it just goes into insanity selling
[14:07.280 --> 14:12.360]  five-year-old girls into sex slavery 100 plus men raping a seven-year-old girl
[14:12.360 --> 14:22.480]  till she died in Syria eating priest hearts on television having seven-year-old
[14:22.480 --> 14:26.400]  boys go and execute tied-up prisoners that's all the stuff they're doing
[14:26.400 --> 14:33.000]  they're proud of it so I have a stack of news where they're desecrating churches
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.560]  all over Europe turning them into Islamic centers government funded where
[14:38.560 --> 14:42.680]  they take school children to learn about bombs and the hijab and actually tell
[14:42.680 --> 14:48.560]  them it's good just like the police chief last week a major city in Finland
[14:48.560 --> 14:54.440]  said we're going to put terrorists in schools they put adults in in high
[14:54.440 --> 14:58.720]  schools they call them little boys like the two guys that were reporting the
[14:58.720 --> 15:03.040]  bombing last week in London oh one was 21 one was 18 they were called boys
[15:03.040 --> 15:07.600]  refugees that came in the last two years and we're living with an old couple
[15:07.600 --> 15:13.200]  and they call them their little boys their little their little jihadis that
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.800]  blow up the the train and then the police chief says quote we're going to put
[15:17.800 --> 15:23.280]  terrorists in classes because terrorists can teach us multiculturalism that's a
[15:23.280 --> 15:30.360]  quote you can't make this up and from Indonesia we're showing footage of that
[15:30.360 --> 15:38.160]  right now to Canada the takeovers happening and the footage we got on
[15:38.160 --> 15:43.640]  screen is the Philippines so why do I mention that because to the globalist
[15:43.640 --> 15:47.640]  to the pedophile armies they love Islam because it's right there in the
[15:47.640 --> 15:51.920]  Korean that you can marry a nine-year-old girl it's right there that you can gay
[15:51.920 --> 15:56.360]  sex is illegal between two adult men but if you're an adult man and it's a boy
[15:56.360 --> 16:01.120]  oh then it's okay so pedophilia is actually enshrined and that's why the
[16:01.120 --> 16:05.960]  left loves it they're going for it because they are now the pedophile
[16:05.960 --> 16:12.480]  Satanist degenerate party they go to their events they will tell you they
[16:12.480 --> 16:17.680]  will publish in major leftist publications drooling disgusting fat
[16:17.680 --> 16:23.320]  slobs showing videos of five-year-old girls dancing telling you how much they
[16:23.320 --> 16:27.160]  want to have sex with them you say why would they do that because they want to
[16:27.160 --> 16:31.840]  throw it in your face and rub it in your face just like they want to give
[16:31.840 --> 16:39.760]  nuclear weapons and missiles to North Korea it's satanic look at the demon eyes
[16:39.760 --> 16:46.760]  on that guy we all got the same eyes now why did I mention that looks like it
[16:46.760 --> 16:51.480]  the clown literally notice that set the clown right there they always look like
[16:51.480 --> 16:56.800]  that now this article is my shepherd ambulance we want to get on the show
[16:56.800 --> 17:03.560]  great info wars.com reporter Illuminati themed fashion show held at
[17:03.560 --> 17:08.000]  London Catholic Church and of course the church went along with it this is
[17:08.000 --> 17:12.840]  liberal just like the Pope said this year it discussed him here about Europe's
[17:12.840 --> 17:18.320]  Christian roots he says let in the Muslims merge with it and now they have
[17:18.320 --> 17:23.840]  fashion shows of people dressed up the way you dress up for a satanic orgy
[17:23.840 --> 17:29.160]  right out of eyes wide shut it's fact it's the accoutrement that I will
[17:29.160 --> 17:36.420]  guarantee you is used probably in that church you know what they do in the
[17:36.420 --> 17:39.440]  Canadian Parliament I've actually had members of the Parliament on it's come
[17:39.440 --> 17:44.680]  out in major publications that they built the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa to
[17:44.680 --> 17:52.280]  carry out satanic rituals oh yes and so now their ultimate fun is to do it in a
[17:52.280 --> 18:01.520]  church but now but now this itself is is an act of Satanism to carry out a
[18:01.520 --> 18:08.360]  satanic ritual in a church the only thing better is to kill a child and I'm
[18:08.360 --> 18:12.680]  not gonna get into what they do on the altars you know but they eat crap they
[18:12.680 --> 18:20.320]  everything else to decorate God's temple to bring in the demons to open the
[18:20.320 --> 18:25.640]  gates whether you believe in Satan or not Satan believes in you and these
[18:25.640 --> 18:32.440]  people believe in Satan and you better believe that it's coming out the former
[18:32.440 --> 18:36.280]  prime ministers and others on a routine basis have little orphan girls brought
[18:36.280 --> 18:40.320]  into their offices they lay the plastic on the floor and they slit those little
[18:40.320 --> 18:43.600]  girls throats and those little boys throats and a lot of the elites don't
[18:43.600 --> 18:49.280]  even touch the body they just pleasure themselves while the child flops
[18:49.280 --> 18:56.280]  around like a fish out of water gasping for air so you just remember that you
[18:56.280 --> 19:02.440]  remember that real good what you're signing on to right now it's up on
[19:02.440 --> 19:09.880]  drudgereport.com right now parental discretion is advised even though we're
[19:09.880 --> 19:15.280]  blurring these images by the way I'm the only person in the last 18 years to
[19:15.280 --> 19:19.800]  interview Vivian Kubrick who was the only member of his family that worked on
[19:19.800 --> 19:23.520]  the films before he died she was basically co-director but she won't
[19:23.520 --> 19:26.360]  brag and say that I've talked to folks in Hollywood she did the music on Full
[19:26.360 --> 19:31.920]  Metal Jack a lot of other stuff and she told me the secrets of that and her dad
[19:31.920 --> 19:36.480]  was not involved in it but obviously her dad was told what was going on in
[19:36.480 --> 19:42.960]  Hollywood and I know more and I but I was told it in confidence and so I just
[19:42.960 --> 19:46.800]  can't tell you but that is Vivian Kubrick that is Stanley Kubrick's daughter and
[19:46.800 --> 19:52.760]  she was his protege we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen with another

[24:50.440 --> 24:53.960]  up late last night it's already rolled off the main page of info wars dot com
[24:53.960 --> 24:57.840]  and the biggest place an easiest place to find this red report dot com but I'm
[24:57.840 --> 25:02.040]  gonna ask the guys to put that back to the top of info wars dot com because it
[25:02.040 --> 25:08.240]  is unbelievable this is a full-out satanic ritual with all the proper
[25:08.240 --> 25:15.480]  equipment is what the Satanist call it in your face disguised as a fashion show
[25:15.480 --> 25:24.360]  in a lesser magic action to rub the blasphemy in your face and only the
[25:24.360 --> 25:27.880]  Christians are to be barred from the internet only the Christians are to be
[25:27.880 --> 25:34.520]  persecuted the Islamists will be held up on the highest pedestal now that's in
[25:34.520 --> 25:38.840]  the west the Muslims will also be used as the great weapon in india against the
[25:38.840 --> 25:43.280]  Hindus and the buddhist who they are allowed to slaughter at leisure with
[25:43.280 --> 25:47.760]  enjoyment and the media also basically agrees to that and says that's a
[25:47.760 --> 25:56.400]  wonderful thing it's truly amazing they estimate 140 plus million Hindus alone
[25:56.400 --> 26:02.640]  have been murdered by Muslims just in india in the last thousand years and then
[26:02.640 --> 26:08.240]  you look at all the other places that were buddhist all over the pacific no no
[26:08.240 --> 26:18.400]  no you convert or you what you die and now the few areas where they've let the
[26:18.400 --> 26:23.040]  Muslims in that were still christian or buddhist in the pacific are now being
[26:23.040 --> 26:29.520]  stabbed and bombed and shot and killed from the Philippines to Malaysia and the
[26:29.520 --> 26:34.560]  governments are agreeing they're saying that's right no more beer we're gonna do
[26:34.560 --> 26:40.920]  what the Muslims say we're gonna bend over we're gonna follow their orders
[26:40.920 --> 26:50.080]  because if you don't you're hateful in that nice good good good good so that's
[26:50.080 --> 26:53.460]  all coming up you know I have a headline out there today on one of our
[26:53.460 --> 26:56.840]  live streams mainstream media ask him tomorrow is gonna be the end of the
[26:56.840 --> 27:00.800]  world and there's such fake news that when I cover this they're gonna say I'm
[27:00.800 --> 27:06.000]  saying this because it's okay for them to cover it but not for us to cover and
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.400]  I'm saying it's pure bull but usually when you got one of these churches or
[27:10.400 --> 27:17.480]  groups saying the end of the world is on a date they don't have the atmosphere
[27:17.480 --> 27:22.280]  we have all these disasters and threats of nuclear war and craziness going on
[27:22.280 --> 27:26.600]  with the backdrop but I'm I'm saying we're still gonna be here tomorrow but
[27:26.600 --> 27:30.440]  coming up the next segment I'll get in North Korea the man whose biblical
[27:30.440 --> 27:37.920]  doomsday claim has some nervously eyeing September 23rd and it's the same old
[27:37.920 --> 27:41.640]  stuff you know the Nibiru is gonna get us well where's the where's this runaway
[27:41.640 --> 27:46.160]  planning we know there's extra planets in the Kuiper bill we know some of them
[27:46.160 --> 27:50.160]  have elliptical orbits and do come through the ancients all tracked them we
[27:50.160 --> 27:52.800]  know they can come pretty close to the earth and have caused earthquakes and
[27:52.800 --> 27:56.580]  things before we know asteroids so big if at the earth you can consider them to
[27:56.580 --> 28:02.080]  be planetoids so I'm not saying this doesn't happen but if it was coming in
[28:02.080 --> 28:10.320]  tomorrow baby it looked like the moon by now I've been hearing for 22 years on
[28:10.320 --> 28:14.960]  air that Nibiru and planet possum is gonna come kill us next week then every
[28:14.960 --> 28:18.640]  time I report oh look there really is a bunch of planet exes and they do have
[28:18.640 --> 28:25.120]  elliptical orbits and they have come by the earth before and the media is look
[28:25.120 --> 28:29.680]  Jones says we're all dead no that's not you're the ones reporting on that I'm
[28:29.680 --> 28:35.280]  reporting on the rest of the story the man whose biblical doomsday claim has
[28:35.280 --> 28:38.520]  some nervously eyeing September 23rd we'll tell you about him straight away
[28:38.520 --> 28:42.400]  when we come back David Mead we ought to get him on I bet to get tomorrow is his
[28:42.400 --> 28:46.400]  big day it's the last day on earth we should have him on the self-described
[28:46.400 --> 28:51.480]  specialist in research and investigation says earned a fair amount of publicity
[28:51.480 --> 28:55.360]  online for predicting the catastrophic events soon before the earth and now
[28:55.360 --> 28:58.600]  maybe maybe he thinks he's right maybe he's on to something I mean I'm not
[28:58.600 --> 29:01.880]  saying that all the guys a liar I think you just is wrong because I got four
[29:01.880 --> 29:04.720]  children I sure hope he's wrong but you do have North Korea threatening nuclear
[29:04.720 --> 29:10.560]  war tomorrow that's that's that's coming up next and you have all these storms
[29:10.560 --> 29:18.080]  and earthquakes from Japan to Mexico that are record level among his claims
[29:18.080 --> 29:21.920]  on Saturday September 23rd a constellation a sign prophesied the
[29:21.920 --> 29:25.520]  book revelation would reveal itself the skies of Jerusalem to the beginning of
[29:25.520 --> 29:28.760]  the end of the world as we know it so he's not specifically again saying it's
[29:28.760 --> 29:33.880]  ending tomorrow the media spending but it signals the chain of events and we
[29:33.880 --> 29:37.760]  should get me dawn tomorrow because he's saying that signals the beginning of the
[29:37.760 --> 29:45.520]  chain reaction the countdown the final countdown to Armageddon the first big
[29:45.520 --> 29:53.760]  domino to fall stay with us we're on the March the Empires on the run Alex Jones

[30:19.880 --> 30:23.880]  consolation with us that the heart of the conflict the more glorious the triumph
[30:23.880 --> 30:28.840]  what we obtained to cheat we esteem too lightly it is dearness only that gives
[30:28.840 --> 30:33.560]  everything its value heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods and it
[30:33.560 --> 30:37.840]  would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be
[30:37.840 --> 30:42.200]  highly rated Britain with an army to enforce her tyranny has declared that
[30:42.200 --> 30:47.520]  she has a right not only to tax but to bind us in all cases whatsoever and if

[33:29.040 --> 33:31.520]  back live
[33:33.360 --> 33:40.600]  Kim Jong-un threatens to tame quote mentally deranged trump with fire many
[33:40.600 --> 33:44.520]  leftist organizations in the United States have praised this they're actually
[33:44.520 --> 33:51.560]  defending North Korea as they point loaded missiles at Japan at South
[33:51.560 --> 33:57.960]  Korea and others and threaten preemptive nuclear war and then it's Donald Trump
[33:57.960 --> 34:05.440]  and America that is saber rattling according to our controlled corporate
[34:05.440 --> 34:12.040]  press whatever Trump might have expected he will face results beyond his
[34:12.040 --> 34:20.640]  expectations and this from Kim Jong-un who never saw a buffet that he wouldn't
[34:20.640 --> 34:27.000]  scarf down immediately what's it doing trying to like sound like he's a
[34:27.000 --> 34:46.640]  Japanese samurai before the fall of the sons of areas and the seas golfing
[34:46.640 --> 34:52.360]  Atlantis there was a time of great adventure and onto this plane
[34:52.360 --> 34:59.400]  strode Kim Jong-un the magnificent destined to rule the world and where
[34:59.400 --> 35:09.120]  the crystal crown of Atalonia it is I your chronicle alone who will tell you
[35:09.120 --> 35:24.080]  of the days of great adventure
[35:30.160 --> 35:35.320]  can we get can you pull up John Belushi as the samurai we need run around with
[35:35.320 --> 35:48.480]  the samurai right now I am not chicken
[36:18.480 --> 36:27.200]  Oh, no, don't happen, hold on, hold on, stop, stop, Kim Jong-un, and I'm translating here
[36:27.200 --> 36:34.160]  from Korean into Japanese for you, very, very similar language, hold on, we're not going
[36:34.160 --> 36:40.880]  back to it yet, let me show you actual footage of a negotiation with Kim Jong-un and our ambassador
[36:40.880 --> 36:54.960]  just one week ago, a little bit grainy footage from a pin camera, but here it is, I think you'd
[36:54.960 --> 37:07.440]  keep the break of 20, hello, another episode of
[37:07.440 --> 37:27.840]  it, pause, I've already thought about this years ago, but I'm going to have a new bit way better
[37:27.840 --> 37:33.440]  than Jimmy Kimmel's and stuff about North Korean dictator, go get me a kimono, get me a samurai sword
[37:33.440 --> 37:40.800]  now, because I'm going to start having daily press briefings from Kim Jong-un, I'm sorry,
[37:40.800 --> 37:45.040]  I think the point of yellow humor with the threat of nuclear war, you know, just days away possibly,
[37:45.680 --> 37:49.920]  well, the threats here, having a nuclear war could happen anytime, and so at this point,
[37:49.920 --> 37:53.680]  I'm just going to have some fun, because can we back out on camera five on the show folks,
[37:53.680 --> 37:58.080]  something that a lot of people online have pointed out looks like a Pink Floyd album cover,
[37:58.080 --> 38:03.360]  but it's so crazier, it's even more powerful, it's Kim Jong-un a month ago watching one of
[38:03.360 --> 38:10.080]  the missile tests, he shot right over Japan, and again, this is a literal dictator that grew up in
[38:11.200 --> 38:18.400]  Switzerland, and has never had a day working his life, and literally is a dictator over a bunch of
[38:18.400 --> 38:25.040]  poor slaves, who he's got brainwashed into a death cult, and he's now threatening to destroy the
[38:25.040 --> 38:29.760]  United States, which is asinine, the only problem is China more and more is coming in on their side,
[38:29.760 --> 38:34.160]  which shows how we've been completely sold out to China, giving them all our jobs, they oppressed
[38:34.160 --> 38:38.560]  their own people, it's a horrible communist dictatorship, but our own elites wanted to control
[38:38.560 --> 38:47.760]  populations, so let me, let's go back to more of Kim Jong-un's, I know everybody wants that,
[38:47.760 --> 38:50.880]  let's go back to more of Kim Jong-un's speech threatening Donald Trump, here it is.
[38:50.880 --> 39:04.000]  You know what he's saying? He's saying I actually believe that trainings are cool, I myself have
[39:04.000 --> 39:13.600]  no wee wee, but I like to act like a man, but is my hair not beautiful? People say I'm fat,
[39:13.600 --> 39:22.320]  this is not true, I am very manly, yes I can barely walk, but it doesn't matter, I can talk
[39:22.320 --> 39:34.160]  in a fake deep voice like this, we are the most oppressive pathetic scum on the earth,
[39:35.360 --> 39:41.920]  we are the example of big government being a nightmare cancer, I know globalists inside
[39:41.920 --> 39:46.800]  America gave me the weapons and are backing me up to try to embarrass Trump, they intend to have
[39:46.800 --> 39:52.880]  the military not strike us so we know we can thumb our noses, we believe we have back channels
[39:52.880 --> 40:04.720]  to discredit America, I am a pathetic idiot, idiot liberals like to come and pay to come here
[40:04.720 --> 40:10.400]  and new tourism to slave area makes them feel better than other people, that's why we will win
[40:10.400 --> 40:16.080]  because we have lots of scum like you who will help us, who want to oppress your own people,
[40:17.040 --> 40:22.080]  I am a giant go-for-life vampire,
[40:23.440 --> 40:34.080]  Onshimo Kwonpo, all right I'm gonna stop now, I gotta get serious, let's get back to the real world
[40:34.080 --> 40:43.520]  which is about what I was just saying, Kim Jong-un threatens to tame mentally deranged Trump with
[40:43.520 --> 40:51.360]  fire, whatever Trump might have expected he will face results beyond his expectation,
[40:51.920 --> 40:57.920]  this is how Kim Jong-un would sound if he was speaking english because he's so powerful,
[40:57.920 --> 41:08.880]  indeed a powerful Jedi who I see has constructed a new gopher mask, but beneath the mask of the
[41:08.880 --> 41:23.120]  obese gopher is the cunning guile of a master assassin, a ninja of untold skill, Kim Jong-un
[41:23.120 --> 41:28.400]  it translates into swallower of souls
[41:31.040 --> 41:36.240]  because that satanism is to put a deformed evil little ugly vampire up on top something with
[41:36.240 --> 41:41.680]  a whole country bowling and worshiping and scraping on their bellies, that's satanism
[41:41.680 --> 41:47.840]  overturning the family, overturning God, overturning prosperity and grinding the human soul into the
[41:47.840 --> 41:57.200]  dirt with a big dirty heel with a fat little goblin on top of you smiling down, yes liberal
[42:00.400 --> 42:06.640]  so let me, because when you talk about Kim Jong-un you're talking about power, so let me speak
[42:06.640 --> 42:13.680]  in a powerful voice, Kim Jong-un this is him speaking, Kim Jong-un threatens to tame mentally
[42:13.680 --> 42:20.960]  to range Trump with fire, whatever Trump might have expected he will face results beyond his
[42:20.960 --> 42:29.280]  expectation, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has threatened US President Donald Trump with fire
[42:29.280 --> 42:33.520]  generous response to the president's speech at the united nations this week
[42:34.960 --> 42:42.560]  in a rare televised speech Friday, Kim labeled the maiden UN address as rude nonsense
[42:42.560 --> 42:47.280]  and accused Trump of being mentally deranged for threatening to destroy North Korea
[42:47.840 --> 42:54.160]  the mentally deranged behavior of the US president openly expression on the UN arena
[42:54.160 --> 43:02.080]  was the unethical will to totally destroy a sovereign state beyond the boundaries of threats
[43:02.080 --> 43:10.480]  of regime change or overturn of social systems makes even those with normal thinking faulty
[43:10.480 --> 43:18.720]  think about discretion and compromise, Kim said according to state-run media outlet
[43:18.720 --> 43:28.400]  Korean central news agency KCNA, this guy really sounds powerful, continuing just look at him,
[43:29.120 --> 43:36.160]  Kim who also is called the president a rogue and a gangster, stated that Trump's threats against
[43:36.160 --> 43:42.000]  the North Korean capital legitimize the North Koreans pursuit of advanced nuclear weapons
[43:42.880 --> 43:48.320]  his remarks, this is the great dear leader's speech, the man who gives the sun the birds to
[43:48.320 --> 43:53.760]  sing the grass to grow, I'm sorry I was just thinking of his sorry back to him, his remarks
[43:53.760 --> 44:00.080]  which describe the US option through straightforward expression of his will have convinced me rather
[44:00.080 --> 44:06.080]  than frightening or stopping me that the path I choose is correct and it is the one I have to
[44:06.080 --> 44:16.400]  follow to the last, Kim added, now that Trump has denied the existence and insulted me the great
[44:16.400 --> 44:24.960]  and powerful us, excuse me sir, now that Trump, now that Trump has denied the existence of
[44:24.960 --> 44:32.480]  and insulted me in my country in front of the eyes of the world and made the most
[44:33.360 --> 44:42.720]  fiercest declarations of war in the history that we would destroy DPRK, we will consider with
[44:42.720 --> 44:51.520]  seriousness exercising of corresponding the highest level of hard line countermeasures in history
[44:51.520 --> 44:59.200]  the North Korean leader ended his speech by threatening to tame Trump with fire
[45:03.360 --> 45:10.160]  and then it goes on from there, I will surely, here's his real mic, I will surely
[45:10.160 --> 45:15.200]  indefinitely tame the mentally deranged US daughter with fire, yeah he's a real daughter
[45:15.200 --> 45:22.560]  you can hardly walk you twerp, Trump at 71 could physically defeat 50 Kim Jong-un's in
[45:22.560 --> 45:27.440]  battleaxe combat I bet, he'd probably you know a few of them could hack in his legs and the
[45:27.440 --> 45:33.040]  president might believe that that's later but I predict that Trump could defeat Kim Jong-un and 49
[45:33.040 --> 45:38.800]  of his clones in a arena, that he could easily do it if they were attacking one at a time
[45:38.800 --> 45:48.640]  but I believe Trump at 71 could slay 50 baby goblins, Satan, hemorrhoid, protuberances
[45:52.720 --> 45:57.680]  I will surely, I'm sorry back to the great and powerful laws, I will surely and definitely
[45:57.680 --> 46:10.160]  tame the mentally deranged US daughter with fire, Kim said, you and your detested Americans,
[46:10.160 --> 46:18.640]  I smelled you when you came in here, he says, Trump on Tuesday stated that the US would totally
[46:18.640 --> 46:26.800]  destroy North Korea if the North placed ourselves or allies in danger, the US has great strength
[46:26.800 --> 46:32.640]  and patience Trump said, if it's forced to defend ourselves or allies we will have no choice but
[46:32.640 --> 46:38.240]  to totally destroy North Korea and that's what I've been saying militarily since the beginning
[46:38.240 --> 46:43.360]  of all this, the North if you do strikes them or counter strike them with limited force will
[46:43.360 --> 46:48.320]  destroy their neighbors and plunge the world economy into depression and then other wars
[46:48.320 --> 46:53.600]  will kick on, you've got to destroy them immediately if you do that, it's got to be done
[46:53.600 --> 46:59.920]  with tactical nuclear weapons destroying the entire DMZ on their side hitting all their other bunkers
[47:00.960 --> 47:07.680]  military installations command and control, you can't just let the ferrets run into their caves
[47:07.680 --> 47:13.200]  and then use shortwave radios, you know the big fat demon possums to then order their starving
[47:13.200 --> 47:18.000]  zombie slaves who mean well but are just brainwashed into total mind control
[47:18.000 --> 47:23.760]  so I thought that he's just normally covering the North Korean news I would do that because
[47:24.560 --> 47:30.000]  as soon as I saw that video of him and you know the way he talks, I will, I'm the big man,
[47:30.000 --> 47:35.760]  oh you will but I will destroy you in that in that tone of voice when he doesn't even have a deep
[47:35.760 --> 47:40.800]  voice just a fake like a little five-year-old acting like I'm the great and powerful Oz
[47:40.800 --> 47:44.320]  since he's doing that I just thought I would make fun of him because that's what communist and
[47:44.320 --> 47:51.120]  devil worshipers and filth bags hate more than anything what happens in North Korea tested
[47:51.120 --> 47:55.200]  hydrogen bomb over the Pacific that's what he also says in here they're going to test one of those
[47:55.200 --> 47:59.680]  open air at an unnamed island or on a boat somewhere I guess testing sending one over to
[47:59.680 --> 48:05.040]  california and detonating it and vaporizing los angeles which I know they blame on trump
[48:07.040 --> 48:12.160]  so that's all coming up meanwhile rob riner is in running around with his paid actors
[48:12.160 --> 48:18.240]  saying that uh trump is a russian agent and now zuckerberg is announced even even
[48:18.240 --> 48:22.240]  having him post gets it right and says they are the new federal elections commission
[48:22.880 --> 48:26.000]  they will block anything conservative libertarian nationalistic
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.560]  off their sites and call it political advertising if you criticize a democrat
[48:30.560 --> 48:33.200]  and so they are openly announcing all that that's coming up
[48:34.880 --> 48:40.160]  because we are kicking their butts politically with the truth they're the globalist they're the
[48:40.160 --> 48:44.880]  people that have sold out america and the world so they look at some foreign country that's also
[48:44.880 --> 48:49.280]  trying to get loose from the globalist and they go look look that's who secretly is running all this
[48:50.080 --> 48:55.760]  no everyone hates you and you sociopaths like rob riner meathead literal meathead
[48:58.080 --> 49:02.800]  and the rest of it are the real enemies of this country and everybody who's thinking knows it
[49:02.800 --> 49:08.080]  and it's time to go from disdaining you to absolutely never talking to you watching you
[49:08.080 --> 49:12.640]  supporting you cutting the bloodstream off from you and letting you vampires wander off
[49:12.640 --> 49:18.080]  into the bush somewhere you're sick and you're a joke it's like hillary the sociopath
[49:18.080 --> 49:23.120]  cannot blame anybody but herself but she keeps doing it got a powerful report with paul watchen
[49:23.120 --> 49:28.400]  coming up before i went any further though september's prepared this month i don't believe
[49:28.400 --> 49:31.920]  the end of the world's around the corner but if there is a big war if there is a big depression
[49:31.920 --> 49:35.920]  if they kill trump if there is civil unrest if there is more big earthquakes i mean you look at
[49:35.920 --> 49:41.600]  stuff no doubt we're entering a major time of change and instead of doubling prices like amazon

[49:45.200 --> 49:49.840]  30 off regular price that's huge we're making like 20 30 40 bucks spending on the filter we
[49:49.840 --> 49:54.160]  need to make more money than that but we're doing this uh the storeable food is almost a loss leader

[54:23.040 --> 54:27.040]  I'll be hosting a little bit into the fourth hour today but then Matt Dubier an amazing researcher
[54:27.040 --> 54:31.280]  and the owner of a powerful Chicago radio station has been carrying us for six seven years is going
[54:31.280 --> 54:36.800]  to be hosting we're working with something very exciting with Matt that he's not ready to announce
[54:36.800 --> 54:46.240]  yet but I'm looking forward to that the animating contest of liberty ticking it up a notch in the
[54:46.240 --> 54:53.520]  face of all the censorship and garbage but make no mistake listeners and viewers this is the battle
[54:53.520 --> 54:59.760]  for the republic against authoritarian dirtbags why do you think they bring in 10 million Muslims
[54:59.760 --> 55:04.320]  I thought it was five million from what I saw in the last four years to Europe it's 10 million
[55:04.320 --> 55:10.960]  according to the UN refugee program and the head of it says it's to get rid of white people
[55:12.080 --> 55:15.520]  and you're like well I guess your races you don't get rid of white people no that's races
[55:15.520 --> 55:21.120]  to get rid of the white people or anybody else called genocide so they're pushing white genocide
[55:21.120 --> 55:32.160]  everybody from Ted Turner to that head vaccine lady out of the so-called Baptist school of Baylor
[55:34.640 --> 55:38.960]  all of them saying white people the problem get rid of white people and in viewing onto white
[55:38.960 --> 55:45.120]  people some special evil and then it's weirdo white people pushing and why are they doing that
[55:46.080 --> 55:50.560]  because the globalists aren't all about numbers they want to bring in outside forces legitimize
[55:50.560 --> 55:54.480]  racism against whites because whites are a minority and then they want to be the whites
[55:54.480 --> 56:03.040]  that control the new majority these are very very diabolical people and I ask my own family who I
[56:03.040 --> 56:13.680]  know has given massive amounts of money to Baylor why my grandmother lived like a popper and she
[56:13.680 --> 56:24.960]  had quite a bit of money from a little bit of west Texas Texas T black gold she just gave it
[56:24.960 --> 56:33.120]  on to christian groups and Baylor so Baylor can literally promote sexualizing children
[56:33.120 --> 56:38.480]  transgenderism and have have have professors saying white people need to all be killed
[56:38.480 --> 56:45.760]  I vomit on Baylor I vomit on that satanic organization it's a din of devil worshipers
[56:45.760 --> 56:51.760]  just like the Vatican that's where they had the secret TPP agreement and the secret North American
[56:51.760 --> 56:58.240]  union agreement it's disgusting and again I ask everybody both my grandmothers went to Baylor
[56:58.240 --> 57:06.960]  they were at Baylor at the same time and knew each other my grandmother off and on dated the
[57:06.960 --> 57:17.360]  HEB founder got powered butts the point is is that you go oh don't criticize my Baylor it's the same
[57:17.360 --> 57:22.480]  with all these colleges you're the ones that let the scum take over your christian universities
[57:22.480 --> 57:30.080]  and turn them into satan factories they got me to go off on Baylor it's everything it's it's
[57:30.080 --> 57:38.560]  everywhere it's just unbelievable garbage you know they've still kept that professor up in
[57:38.560 --> 57:43.360]  NYU that says kill all the cops turns out he put up more tweets saying kill them
[57:45.840 --> 57:49.360]  he's saying kill the cops and they're at a university he's like we like that
[57:50.880 --> 57:56.240]  you're like this sounds crazy why if they can have a satanic ceremony at high noon in a catholic
[57:56.240 --> 58:01.680]  church in front of everybody and put it on national television they're ruling you if they can have
[58:01.680 --> 58:08.480]  10 million refugees eight plus million men and have them everywhere raping in mass women to
[58:08.480 --> 58:15.200]  where uber has to shut down because the muslims are using it as as as rape wagons the woman comes
[58:15.200 --> 58:20.160]  into the spider's nest the door opens she doesn't know it's a spider nest she steps in the guy locks
[58:20.160 --> 58:26.080]  the door drives her into a garage and five muslims gang rape them and hell those are the lucky ones a
[58:26.080 --> 58:32.080]  lot of women come up missing because the word is they like to cut up women and then sell them at
[58:32.080 --> 58:40.720]  their meat shops oh yeah that's in the news but it's okay because it's liberal yeah it's all

[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.200]  narcissists satanism is in the eyes of all these jihadis
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.360]  because they just seek to dominate everything around them because they know they're stinking
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:08.000]  piles of crap and that's why they want to tear on everything that's not mutated and ugly like their

[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.040]  because i've read the peanut documents they wanted to go take out the non-radical regimes
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:23.600]  where women went to college and had their genitals cut off and where gays weren't thrown off buildings

[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:34.160]  and our government put the most degenerate scum on earth in who literally kidnap men women and
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.360]  children and sex traffic the women and children and then the left makes jokes about it and i've

[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.160]  he has no idea what he's even involved in does he
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:42.880]  what the establishment says here's your limo and here's your money and now you're somebody
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:51.360]  you're somebody while you run your mouth about how you're gonna beat everybody's ass

[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:17.440]  you've got hordom written across your chest because you sold out your fellow countrymen
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:25.200]  you sold out your birthright to be somebody else's man to say the words that somebody
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:32.880]  put in a talking point in one of the big think tanks or one of the big political groups
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:39.920]  were a bunch of old twisted nobody men hanging on to life by their fingernails
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:45.600]  trying to control the world for their own personal power trips and they're so disconnected
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:51.760]  that they don't even know how culture works now and they don't even get that when they spend
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:58.240]  billions of dollars at facebook to force feed facebook videos that everyone is linked and is
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:07.280]  already turning on it with total and complete savage force
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:17.200]  you can feel as true evil climbs out of the pit and as the persecution of innocence accelerates
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:24.080]  god's wrath and those connected to god can feel the resonance level of god's disgust
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:35.200]  and god's will to tear you slowly limb from limb you're going to beg one thousand times a thousand
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:41.200]  like any child that you people ever tortured to death
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:49.920]  so understand that you're going to beg your god satan to come and save you and satan won't be
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:58.560]  there you understand that yes i think you do now don't you what exactly is political correctness
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.880]  and why is it being pushed on the american public well political correctness is simply a form of
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.520]  psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion by controlling your
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:12.080]  opinions the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda but to also ensure that
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:16.880]  your government created viewpoint also influences others in ripple effect and this is how the power
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:21.040]  elite and the government stay in power they use psychological manipulation they turn the public
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:25.840]  into obedient sheeple and over time we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:30.640]  but how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work well first the establishment
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:35.360]  saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:40.560]  of popular culture and is accepted as truth such as global warming for example then the establishment
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:46.080]  suppresses any counter arguments to their agenda by calling critics kooky nut jobs racist or in the
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:50.320]  case of man-made climate change climate deniers you can learn more about this tyranny over the

[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.800]  because it's the stuff she said in court she's the only that attacked people with a machete and
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:18.240]  golf clubs stabbed a bunch of people and then she wouldn't even stand up for the judge and just said
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:22.400]  i do not listen to you i am under sharia and even the left doesn't know what to do now because
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:27.280]  there's so many islamic attacks they go look we're kissing your butt so hard why do you keep killing
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.760]  us and then because they got a kind of a weird right-wing angle that's extreme they're always
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:36.800]  like attacking gay night clubs or liberal areas because a they know there's a bunch of disarmed
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:41.840]  people in there they're cowards so they attack folks they know disarmed and then b that's who
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:46.160]  they believe in their religion the strangest thing about the radical orthodoxism as muslims is they
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:52.800]  respect me on their main sites and stuff they said they want to go after me but they know i
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:57.760]  understand their their plan to take over and they say infidel we know you know our plan we will get
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:05.120]  you but they have respect because they understand i'm aware of their agenda so there you go uh you
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:12.320]  got to read this article female jihad like moving a mountain of defiance in court our laws are not
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:20.080]  her laws her law is sharia and you've got to read this rahab dogmosh is the canadian court after being
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:26.800]  arrested in june following a vicious attack on customers and staff at a canadian tire outlet
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:33.920]  with a golf club and a large knife and a bow in its coverage of the case the toronto star reveals how
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:40.720]  in detail dogmosh's contempt for canada its infidel people and its laws the report begins she's not
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:46.640]  insane she's intractable westerners cannot begin to wrap their heads around how such a woman could
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:52.240]  not be insane but she is just manifesting the jihad mindset and then she goes on in the toronto
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:59.360]  star with quotes from court these are from her the toronto stars rosy domano reveals the loyalty
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:05.200]  to sharia of dogmosh quote now usually you never see this but she said this herself so you get to
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:11.520]  hear what they say our laws are not her laws her law is sharia despite the bizarre behavior of
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:16.560]  dogmosh westerners would do well to understand that islamic supremacists in jihadists have one
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:21.920]  feature in common only one law is to adhere to the sharia and no other law is to be respected
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:27.840]  since sharia is regarded as divine law western leaders still refuse to acknowledge the truth
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:33.520]  that islamic supremacists the west is the house of war and must be subjugated into the house of
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:39.360]  islam as the toronto star report continues last time i witnessed anyone refusing to stand in
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:45.280]  court even for a judge's entrance was a toronto proceeding involving a member of canada notorious

[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.800]  insolently stapled to their seat presumably to demonstrate their contempt for the canada court
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:03.440]  the census of superiority which is accompanied by the entitlement and divine purpose is at the
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:08.240]  core of islamic supremacism however it may be manifested individually or by a group making it
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:17.040]  all the more abhorrent that canadian taxpayer dollars paid an al-qaeda fighter omar qadar
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:22.320]  ten point five million dollars in compensation for so-called abuse as he suffered as a teenager in

[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:42.480]  and sometimes 25 year olds in high schools saying your your developments arrested we're

[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:02.160]  mean you know that's the thing when people are running around declaring they're going to kill us
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:06.720]  and overthrow everything and then the media is defending it trying to cover it up most of the
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:12.640]  time and then they're almost all military age men again 15 years ago i thought it was a hoax
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.760]  when i read stuff by jihad watching others about this i just thought there's no way that's real
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:23.200]  this is the majority view and it's why i harp on it like a broken record because it is so
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:31.440]  incredibly important and i have stacks of this every day to an islamic male who comes from a
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:38.240]  blue collar or poor background anywhere in the world a woman unattended is to be raped because
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:44.320]  that's how they oppress women is beating them up or raping them and then if the woman complains
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:51.680]  she gets charged with adultery if she's married or with uh having sex out of wedlock or blasphemy
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:58.800]  and in many cases is executed and the man or men who rape them and i love the left tells us about
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:04.560]  western rape culture that's almost non-existent it's the west that is about treat women well
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:12.960]  we get told as western men that we're the pigs hurting women and then there's this stinking red
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:18.960]  carpet of blood rolled out for lendasaur sir and by the leftist media when her family supports
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:24.800]  genital mutilation terror attacks on israel her family is in prison a bunch of them she says carry

[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:20.720]  here's the analogy of why i get so upset you know if you give nuclear weapons in north korea
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:24.720]  they're going to start menacing people with it like communists always do and it's going to be able
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:30.320]  to do a huge crisis and they know the history of the korean peninsula in japan and china
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:36.160]  those countries have had innumerable wars with each other and the vietnamese hate the chinese more
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:43.600]  than anybody they occupied them for a thousand years there's basically a religion of hating china in
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:50.400]  vietnam and it's a huge powder keg and now nuclear weapons are proliferating everywhere
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:58.720]  we know sexualizing children in the schools under sex education to teach them tolerance
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:03.440]  when they're five years old is pedophilia and we know it's run by nambla and others that recommended
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:09.440]  20 years ago that that's how they would normalize it was teaching the kids how to be tolerant and
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:14.080]  really you're just having an adult sexualized children who isn't the parents i mean it'd be
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:19.760]  perverted parents were telling their five-year-olds about sex and stuff i mean you don't even do that
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:27.440]  till they're teenagers but we put up with it and i like it in a society to finding a house you like
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:36.560]  but it's right by a highway and you know statistically if you have children living by
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:40.480]  highways one of the most dangerous things it's worse than a pool it's one of the top things
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:45.840]  that kills children is getting run over by highways but you know what you have basically a 50 50 chance
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:53.280]  of getting run over if you live by a major highway it's your dog or your cat just like
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:58.320]  giving nuclear weapons to a dictator a good chance you're going to start a nuclear war kind of like
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:03.520]  moving in you got six seven kids and a dog and a cat and you really like that house and boy it's
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:08.640]  big and nice but it's out there at the edge of town on the busy highway by the interstate why
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:13.920]  would you live right there by the highway when you know it's going to get your dogs and cats killed
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:21.120]  and maybe even your kids well you want the house and you tell yourself it's going to be okay until
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:26.320]  god forbid one day you go out there and you hear the sirens and your six-year-old wanders out there
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:38.640]  to get their ball and they're strewn 200 yards down the road my family about a year and a half ago
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:46.160]  wanted a cat and i said i like cats but i said there's a major road with tons of traffic on it
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:53.840]  going 60 miles an hour 50 yards from the front door of this house and i said you got to keep that
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:58.960]  cat in the house and i don't want to keep the cat in the house oh we'll keep the cat in the house
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:03.920]  cat got out he likes to go out we start letting him go out starts to go over by the road wash the
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:11.920]  cars son's coming home from jiu-jitsu nine o'clock last night cats dead in our parking lot i guess he
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:18.080]  crawled that far and that's probably one reason i'm even extra angry today but the reason i tell
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:26.720]  that story is i knew and but i i i just will not have a cat if you live by highway and by the way
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:32.320]  if you live out in the country people i don't know where spotty went or where garfield went
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:35.440]  all over the united states you know the number one cause of cats death in the countryside
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:41.120]  it's coyotes it's their main food source and i see these signs up all over neighborhoods
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:46.560]  constantly where's my cat where's my chihuahua well in texas it's coyotes and of course you
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:51.200]  know what it is in florida because they still won't let them hunt it's alligators
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:58.400]  but disney didn't want want to warn anybody that they'd had people's pets getting eaten so it had
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:03.280]  to take a kid getting eaten before they started taking the alligators and flying them out shoot
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:10.160]  them in the head they're a dangerous dinosaur walking around they're like roaches now in south
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:16.080]  texas because they have have cut back the amount of hunting and i'm just digressing it's just the
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:22.720]  point is is that i don't know when we're going to have a nuclear war i don't know when a bio weapon's
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:27.280]  going to get out i don't know when all this is going to get triggered but more and more we're
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:34.560]  entering the zone of where we can't stop this stuff much longer and everything the globalists are doing
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:41.600]  shows that they actually want a big crisis to happen to get full control as they themselves
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:48.800]  evacuate to the southern hemisphere as fast as they can because the two hemispheres are basically
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:54.800]  separate wind systems and a huge nuclear war in the north you could probably still live in the
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.640]  south and you see the elites for six seven years evacuating to the southern hemisphere and i'm not
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:05.200]  the doom and gloom are here i was the first to tell you about that now it's mainstream news
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:12.880]  i'm just saying man can we just not have a nuclear war but the issue is appease appease appease
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:15.440]  and those who said appease
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:25.600]  end up hung by those they tried to please what's the full poem it's back from revolutionary war
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:37.440]  i forget who wrote it when freedom fails patriots rot and stinking jails those that cried appease
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:42.160]  appease are hung by those they tried to please i'm gonna give the number dot take your calls
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:46.400]  play a bunch of clips coming up stay with us on this friday transmission we're on the march
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:58.320]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network it was thomas jefferson who once said
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:02.160]  that our country is now taking so steady of course as to show by what road it will pass to
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:07.440]  destruction to wit by consolidation of power first and then corruption it's necessary consequence
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.680]  jefferson was warning us about the global elite the one percent of the one percent consolidating
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:15.840]  the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government unfortunately we didn't
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:20.320]  heed his advice we now live in a neo feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:24.320]  servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment political office no longer
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:28.560]  represents the voice of the people but rather the initiation process politicians go through to
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:33.120]  gain acceptance into the aristocracy simply put we the people are responsible for civilization
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:37.360]  and culture yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:41.600]  governments around the world we falsely believe that everything is simply black and white one
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:45.680]  extreme against the other conservative versus liberal but things will change once more of us

[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:27.760]  these hurricanes i just said you know what let's cut this down to where it's almost a loss leader
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.960]  which we've done uh and believe me this took a lot to get done there was even had to be management
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:36.480]  changes because my patriots awesome they're wonderful people they already have the best
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:44.880]  horrible food out there for the price uh but still we weren't able to do this even at 30% off
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:49.600]  you notice for about six months because there were some other distributors got upset about you
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.440]  know just somebody else was going to sell something it almost a loss well that's just what we do
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:58.960]  okay so uh i don't know how long this can go but this is a real to the bone special and i want to
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:04.080]  salute matt redhog uh over there at my patriot supply the founder of the company and they had
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.680]  other great management too it's just that you know we had some arguments with the previous folks so
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:12.560]  redhogs back running the whole thing i'm just letting you know i mean i had to really bang heads
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:18.880]  to go 30% and and now at 50 they just said you know what we'll let you do that a week even though
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:21.600]  we don't make any money and i said you know what because it's the christian thing to do and they're
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:29.760]  christians and i i just said let's just keep doing it so infowarstore.com or triple 82533139
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:35.520]  and redhog called tim fruget on wednesday and said i'm listening to alex just go ahead and extend it
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:40.560]  but he said listen we like to ship within one or two days we don't ever like to run out of the food
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:43.920]  we don't make people wait like other folks do because that's why they're the big they're the
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:47.040]  top two companies now you can argue they are the biggest it's only been around eight years
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:51.520]  because the quality the customer service how fast they get it to you the packaging is the best and
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:59.120]  it's proprietary because of all of it they don't like to run low it's only happened a few times so
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:03.840]  at the amount they're selling at this cost it could end i could get a call from matt redhog
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:10.000]  today he said maybe a week and that was on wednesday so but he said don't don't hold me to that so i'm
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.080]  telling you exactly what was relayed to tim and then to me so just understand this is a special
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:22.560]  you don't ever see but those type of folks that are like we are not going to do what amazon does
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:28.720]  in double prices during crisis we're gonna do the opposite but we expect you to act like that as well
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:35.360]  that's what built america okay i want to take your phone calls after this paul watson report
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:40.400]  i cannot express to people with all the global stuff going on you need to be self-sufficient

[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:46.400]  it is very relaxing if you thought hillary was acting weird before the election she's just turned
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:51.680]  it up to 11 it is very relaxing according to dr robert hare professor of psychology at the
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:57.600]  university of british columbia one of the defining traits of a psychopath is a failure to accept
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:02.560]  responsibility for one's actions according to dr seth mayer's a clinical psychologist with the
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:08.400]  la county department of mental health one of the defining traits of a sociopath is that they tend
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:13.680]  to blame others for their own failures yeah who does that remind you of why aren't i 50 points ahead
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:21.120]  you might ask well how many people and things apart from herself has hillary blamed for losing
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:35.680]  barack obama joe biden russia bernie sanders bernie sanders voters james comey the media
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:42.000]  wikileaks sexism fake news husbands white people millions of white people yeah millions of white
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:48.720]  people the daily mail compiled 41 different things or people she blamed in her book classic
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:55.280]  sociopath behavior as forensic psychologist or mando simon notes she has blamed everything and
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:44:03.520]  everyone except herself or her serial rapist husband this is very typical of a sociopath she
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:10.480]  is a true certifiable sociopath i had not drafted a concession speech yeah that's why you didn't
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:15.200]  concede on the night of the election isn't it hillary it isn't actually that you got completely
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:21.600]  face drunk to soothe your butthurt started throwing things at people and reviews to do it oh but you
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:26.960]  kept going after the election and you didn't get depressed that's why you started doing bizarre
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:33.120]  things with your nostrils and disappeared into the woods for days on end i feel like i'm a bit of a
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:41.440]  you know paula revere yeah paul revere warned that foreign invaders were on their way to attack
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:46.720]  he didn't invite them to fund raising carlers why you did hillary he didn't sell them a huge
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:52.480]  chunk of america's uranium supply like you did he didn't take vast amounts of money from them to
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:58.240]  give speeches like your husband did she thinks the media was against her during the election
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:03.920]  and wanted to make voodoo dolls of reporters and stick pins in them i thought something like this
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:14.480]  might happen that's why i prepared for it what are you talking about your own personal mojo doc
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:25.920]  the media was unfair to hillary what what you think we didn't read the pedestrian emails you had
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:32.000]  journalists getting approval for their stories from your campaign before they were published you had
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:37.680]  cnn contributors handing you the debate questions in advance they were putting out polls saying you
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:44.720]  had a 98% chance of winning 91% of the media coverage in the final weeks of the election
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:53.840]  was negative towards trump what in god's name are you talking about like an antibody experience
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:46:00.560]  she claimed george orwell's 1984 was a lesson in how people needed to trust authority yeah that
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:05.920]  actually happened what level of self-delusion do you have to be living under to think that a book
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:12.400]  that is purely about an authoritarian behemoth crushing the individual is actually about the
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:18.800]  need to trust authority if they were you know responding on a youtube comment chain or on twitter
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:28.400]  and the attacks were so sexist oh cry me a river can you want about youtube comments now you're
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:34.320]  whining about youtube comments get over it she even refused to say the blame for words that came
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:40.640]  out of her own mouth you could put half of trump supporters into what i call the basket of deplorables
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:46.640]  but you offended some people who who didn't personally well deplorable i don't i don't buy that
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:53.120]  gotta understand what putin's strategy is he really doesn't like democracy he thinks it's an
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:58.400]  inconvenient messy process yeah you just love democracy hillary don't you that'll be why you
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:04.000]  had your girlfriend debbie wasam and schultz and the dnc deliberately sabotage bernie sanders campaign
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:11.360]  and rig the primaries because you care so much about democracy what's wrong with hillary she's
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:18.320]  a sociopath and no i'm not just saying that as an insult she's literally a sociopath she's a sociopathic
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:24.800]  pathological liar she lies when she doesn't even have to this is the woman who claims she was named
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:29.920]  after sir edmund hillary the first person to climb mount everest yeah one problem with that sir edmund
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:37.440]  hillary climbed mount everest six years after hillary was born in 1947 at which point no one even
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:43.680]  knew who he was hillary clinton is completely nuts she's infamous for having raging tantrums over
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:49.280]  nothing people literally hide in rooms to avoid her don't forget this is the woman who basically
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:55.600]  said she was staying in the 2008 presidential race in case obama got assassinated this is a woman
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:09.440]  who laughed about getting a child rape pissed off the hook the only fault she acknowledges in her
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:15.120]  book is not communicating her message better like if she just have communicated better people would
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:21.680]  have liked her nobody likes you you're fundamentally unlikable you're detestable you barely even
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:28.080]  managed to come across as human even the hoffington post says what happened reads like a quote self
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:33.840]  care book written by a serial killer this is not a well woman but then again what do you expect from
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:40.000]  someone who according to oxford university has a bigger psychopathic personality the nero and the
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:47.760]  greed oh the sickening endless greed a 40 million dollar advance on your previous book a 20 million
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:53.680]  dollar advance on this one and you still charge people over two grand for a front row seat and a
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:58.320]  picture listen i know you've got to pay off that mansion you bought next to the white house having
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:04.480]  bought it before the election assuming you'd be coronated because you're a narcissistic arrogant
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:12.800]  piece of what how much money does one person need a lot of people have said oh i boy i wish
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:18.240]  hillary clinton uh we just go away yeah just go away well you know if they take up a collection
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:24.000]  and send me somewhere really nice someone set up a go fund me quick the new york times reported
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:30.720]  the long road to a clinton exit nine years ago and she's still here even her own fundraisers
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:35.520]  are telling her to shut the up and go away because she's harming the democratic party's
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:42.080]  chances in 2018 political reports that all this anti-trump hysteria which originated with hillary
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:49.680]  crafting the russian collusion narrative isn't working 2018 key swing state voters don't care
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:54.720]  if you're a trump supporter you shouldn't want hillary to shut up you should want her to stick
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:50:01.520]  around her sociopathic insanity keeps reminding people why trump won in the first place increasing
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:10.400]  his chances of winning again in 2020 hillary clinton is like herpes herpes hillary she's painful
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:16.160]  embarrassing and she won't go away and for trump supporters that's a good thing but for the good
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:22.000]  of the country should we really allow a deranged sociopath whose decisions have led to death and

[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:44.640]  criminal enterprise known as the clinton foundation or should we step up pressure on trump

[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:19.440]  yes how you doing alex it's uh great to be on and i just wanted to talk about the deep state
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:23.520]  cog plan and how it ties in with north korea because they do go hand in hand
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:28.160]  but we know the democrats are trying to hijack cog i'm not even saying cog is bad
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:34.080]  the point is they are saying in major publications they want to hijack it use a race war or a war
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:40.400]  to unseat trump well 100 percent and um quite frankly you know i have to predicate this comment
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:46.160]  because i do really do uh respect and admire steve pacinic but there was a call a couple weeks ago
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:50.480]  or maybe a week ago when he was you know in during the hurricane and he made some bizarre
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:55.920]  comments in my in my opinion about the lack of importance of the potis and this type of thing
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:00.480]  where i think i was kind of out of touch and you know what you know what i'll say this i mean i'll
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:05.040]  have pacinic back on pacinic pacinic guarantee got some phone calls from the last time he was on
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:10.800]  and i think he's had jenice betz i think you know pacinic yeah yeah yeah i mean that was very
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:13.840]  bizarre i was trying to follow along and hoping he was you know there was going to come a laugh
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:18.000]  after it but some of it was bizarre but anyways i hope he's doing okay and i hope he's safe or
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.520]  maybe he was stretching the hurricane but let me get you know i don't want to bash him i'll have him
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:25.120]  back on but that's a load of bull i've talked to a lot of people that are currently in intelligence
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:30.000]  agencies they say it's a serious threat against the president this country's in a civil war a
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.640]  soft cold civil war right now and the threat against the president and the attempt to overthrow the
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:41.440]  country is very real so we have two unprecedented events you have the address at the un done by
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:45.600]  president trump which got very little coverage by the mainstream media which was incredible and
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:51.200]  and then what you have is kim jong un responding which is a complete rarity because he realizes
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:57.200]  that he is a pawn a a he was educated in switzerland the strategic patients pawn he's put in a
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:01.760]  situation where he even realizes you know that the paintings on the that the paintings on the
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:07.840]  wall there and he's done you know what's going to happen here with this north korea issue is
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:11.600]  pretty important because when they're coming out with statements and press conference like this
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:16.400]  this is unprecedented so what we can't do is just look at them as a conventional threat of missiles
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:22.320]  and maybe they test another um icbm or something like this we have to realize of what the arabs
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:27.840]  and what the radical islamic have done with suicide attacks there may be a triggered event in the
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:32.800]  united states that could trigger this whole thing off is it that was about to say i mean the north
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:37.920]  korea is is basically like radical islamic countries are iran they admittedly have large
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:43.920]  brigades of suicide troops and the u.s. is already bought you know is already buying the crap when
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:47.360]  it comes to these false flags because if you know if you want to talk about sophistication north
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:52.080]  korea is not sophisticated but make no mistake they are way more sophisticated than some dudes
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:56.960]  and uh some caves in afghanistan so the idea that they couldn't you know perpetrate something on our
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:02.400]  home soil with uh suicide emissions or something like this all while you know so you're saying it's
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:07.600]  a false flag who would do the false flag well you know this is where it gets real tricky because
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:12.560]  what is the deep state because what you know as the epigenic weirdly uh talked about it doesn't
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:16.640]  matter about the protest it's about continuity of government this this is this is a this is a
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:21.200]  major grab and then you know this you're saying there can be a nuke going off and killing trump
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:27.920]  saying north korea did it well there could be a very very isolated dirty mom attack in the u.s.
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:31.920]  and it can be attributed to north korea and the dominoes that this will put into place
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:36.000]  will be incredible clearly and they would take out trump and north korea at the same time
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.760]  that's a good point you think that up or did you hear that from somebody we'll come back with zack in
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:43.760]  70 seconds we're gonna go to jeremy ryan dan nick and others stay with us

[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:06.400]  war
[02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:11.760]  all right zach
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:19.120]  looking at the situation killing the elected president
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:25.600]  is overthrowing the election of the people and hillary has said she wants to overturn the election
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:31.440]  and even lord rothschild the head of one of the biggest power structures out there has said
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:36.080]  it's basically time to take out north korea so this is definitely a different strategy now there's
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:40.880]  different factions what factions do you think are out there where do you think this is going
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:43.920]  kim jong-un now threatening to detonate a hydrogen bomb above ground
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:50.480]  yes uh so you know during that you in address there's some very eerie images and you showed
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:55.760]  them on your show of tillerson and hailey sitting you know sitting and watching as they speak because
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:58.960]  you know trump wrote that speech and trump delivered that speech and that was a message to
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:04.400]  the rest of world that's why you see kim jong-un unprecedentedly responding so what i'm thinking
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:09.200]  is going to happen here is there will be a response the korean the north korean dictatorship is out
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:14.800]  of control or who knows who they're really being back or ran by i believe and this is more than an
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:18.960]  assumption that there will be an attempt doesn't mean it will be successful there but there will
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:25.280]  be an attempt on an attack on the u.s mainland because notice the strategic and kind of eerie talks
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:29.520]  that kim jong-un said fire like we've never seen of course with our anti-missile defense as we could
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:34.000]  do anything but obviously in the past you know 15 years of war we're vulnerable to suicide attacks
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:39.440]  so for some reason we think korea we don't think the you know the status quo what goes in the
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:46.240]  middle east which is ids dirty bombs and things of this sort so you know this is going down and
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:50.880]  it's very important because economy government is important what we have as a president who is
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:57.360]  literally organizing a revolution um you know i hope you could get the people around him because
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:02.720]  i hope madis is sticking with them because the the things that patenic was saying and some other
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:06.400]  guys who i know were saying about sticking up kind of McMaster and these guys and these kind of
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:10.960]  comments that you didn't serve so you just shouldn't talk it's very dangerous it's very dangerous
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:15.280]  because it doesn't matter who serves the president at the top of that chain of command madis outranks
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:20.640]  McMaster and that's what to go with sure the idea is trump wasn't in the military so his account oh he
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:25.360]  went on the campaign trail he lost hundreds of millions of dollars he stuck his family out there
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:31.120]  trump has served this country hardcore and it's very elitist to then say he isn't as big a man
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:35.680]  as somebody was in the military but all he's done is try to take care of the military it's it's it's
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:40.400]  embarrassing and my answer to that is george washington don't give me the crap about you know
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:44.640]  you serve for 30 years so you have this you know this moral high ground you know before there was
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:47.680]  any military there was a man who started it and the man who started the revolution so
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:51.280]  and patenic is kind of removed and again i'm not attacking him i that's right the elitist
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:55.760]  british military would never even take washington that's one reason he wanted to prove them wrong
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:00.960]  he was just a colonial scout and was in a way more combat than the redcoats they were afraid to go
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:06.400]  where he even went and then later he kicked their ass five to one so there you go so we so we do know
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:10.960]  technologically that uh north korea with their backing of certain elements is more sophisticated
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:15.200]  than surely afghanistan and probably libya and this whole strategic patience problem has fallen
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:19.280]  apart um and if you want to see us retreat patient works if you're kim johnson that's a good point
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:25.840]  the guy that founded the u.s army and the u.s military was never in an official military exactly
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:29.200]  so that statement and maybe he was stressed by the storm i'm down in florida too was pretty
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:33.040]  stressful but some of the things he was saying were pretty i don't know it maybe it's not just him
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:37.040]  maybe he was him to get some things or he was in a vulnerable spot but this is the kind of thing
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:42.320]  and if you look at the un the speech and the address that donald trump delivered the it's
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:46.240]  just so incredible and so important because i think he could have gotten one or two ways
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:49.120]  he says you know what i'm going to deliver this i'm going to write it i'm going to do it of course
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:56.160]  you know he has his guys in there but uh look this is it he showed he showed he's not selling out
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:04:02.880]  he showed he's doubling down he showed it's not selling out but you know i don't want to tie in
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:07.440]  the hurricanes and the earthquakes and everything with it but there's a lot of kinetic movement
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:11.920]  going on on the planet right now people are getting antsy and there's obviously obviously a change
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:16.560]  in philosophy within the united states that's been running uh probably since at least uh
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:20.400]  probably after kennedy reagan tried to stop some things but obviously look what happened to him
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:24.480]  and then you know he doled out and was he just seemed dumbed down and kind of poisoned toward
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:29.120]  the end of his term and you know you alluded to and you were really um heartfelt and i could tell
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:33.840]  how much you know passion you you you were leaking some things initially during that talk on the
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:38.560]  transmission with depotinic about trump being poisoned and i don't know if he's being poisoned
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:43.200]  but uh intellectually he's most definitely is being poisoned influence that's well he's
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:47.600]  friends away they're they're isolating him and they know trump operates office family and his
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:54.480]  friends and people he really trusts he'll be right back stay with us don't we hold these truths to
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:59.680]  be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain

[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:29.360]  are really important tucker carlson smacks down rob reiner or meathead as hollywood's war with russia
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:38.720]  expands and as he produced a video with the most prolific actor in history that's right it's official
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:43.200]  he's in more tv shows more movies than anybody else morgan freedman
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:50.320]  who said a lot of good stuff over the years but we now know he was basically paid by different
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:57.200]  special entry scripts to say it for pr the guy is just a quite a capitalist but i guess a sociopathic
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:02.400]  one and i'd heard that about morgan freedman from folks that's why he undercuts other actors you know
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:07.120]  he's a smart guy that's why he gets more roles than anybody he does takes they say better than
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:13.440]  even people like uh clenice wood who they say is like next to morgan freedman the guy that
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:21.280]  doesn't mess up his lines well there you go now he's really discredited himself with rob reiner the
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:30.320]  big producer saying that trump got elected because of the russians and that we're quote at war with
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:40.080]  russia so that clip's coming up we covered it a few days ago but now rob reiner uh has responded
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:46.160]  and chelsea handler maybe we trade trump for kim jong-un it's a bright part story it's up on

[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:10.880]  else i mean he's a little bloodthirsty do-nothing punk who never did anything in his life mcdonald's

[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:38.560]  this other hollywood scum every day kissing his demonic butt yes i hate hollywood i hate steven
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:46.000]  cobert i hate them all because they hate me because they're a bunch of jerks and a bunch of trash in
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:54.400]  that giant submerged iceberg that the tip of it just sticking up just five percent of the of the
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:12:04.320]  mass is a mountain of crimes devil worship pedophilia murder they're just a bunch of inbred
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:10.320]  crazy globalist trash worldwide the islamists the north korean government the hollywood all
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:17.040]  just a bunch of people that have been getting away with murder forever and they look at good
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:22.640]  straight strong hard work and people of every color and every creed and they want to deface that
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:28.800]  that they want you to roll around in the in the manure with them like they do with skull and bones
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:36.720]  where a bunch of men get together in a big vat of feces and urine and have sex with each other
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:40.480]  and then they get in coffins and ask lucifer to come into them that's admitted
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:50.480]  what the hell is your problem why don't you want to go drill hamburgers with a beautiful vista
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:56.640]  and go drop right around a boat and go wakeboarding or hike a mountain or look at the stars or
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:13:03.360]  praise god or you know take care of your children just be good because you're evil and good people
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:10.720]  haven't destroyed you and so it's our fault it's my fault it's my fault this is all happening
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:23.280]  it's your fault and it's not going to keep happening god help us you know hollywood is a
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:30.640]  factory of kidnapping children and killing them just millions of missing kids in just the west
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:36.560]  every year 800 000 most of them aren't runaways they're people grabbed by these spiders and drug off
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:42.640]  in it you know everybody gets so scared of stuff like hit the clown pennywise and it's the number
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:47.120]  one movie horror movie ever was it 400 million dollars or something i saw the other day
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:54.720]  you see that's why this show sounds so whacked out because truth is so much stranger than fiction
[02:13:54.720 --> 02:14:03.600]  don't believe me just search the history of clowns and that in ancient Greece Babylon
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:13.120]  and Egypt child sacrifice cults
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:24.640]  would put on red outfits for blood and red manes for blood and white faces
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:30.000]  because they knew they had to tell the villagers you bring your kids at the ultimate act of
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:34.320]  submission is to bring your your two three four-year-old right when you love them the most
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:39.760]  right when they're the funniest the sweetest everything and they're going to torture them
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:45.680]  in front of all you they're going to grill them on a big hot metal plate in front of the idol with
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:51.040]  a fire under it or they slice them up and the priests drink the blood and then a lot of times
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:57.680]  make you drink it the Aztecs said it everybody else did and in almost all cultures the people
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:02.080]  doing it instead of wearing an executioner mask because sometimes somebody might still get mad
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:06.640]  the village you still has their instincts and kill you so you don't wear a mask a hood like
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:13.920]  your executioner you wear a clown mask with a big red mouth that you're scary and big red
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:18.800]  hair for blood and you wear in fact let's show the satanic ceremony that's on the drugs right now
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:23.120]  Illuminati satanic theme fashion show held at London look what they're all wearing because
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:36.880]  that's actual satanic regalia that's five thousand years old notice it's clown outfits five thousand
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:45.120]  years old five thousand years old you want to know you why you don't like pennywise
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:50.560]  because boys and girls just like i told you last week satanists dress up like clowns
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:16:00.080]  and what are you seeing on your screen you're seeing real satanic regalia but they used a bunch
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:06.720]  of suck dry brain damage brainwash youth to strut around doing it in a catholic church
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:14.240]  we're going to go to your calls coming up at the bottom of the hour and Tommy Robinson is a
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:20.880]  best-selling author publisher patriot he's got two books out you should get him off his website
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:31.520]  one of them is is is sold out right now that's Muhammad's Quran and he also works with rebel
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:38.960]  media we appreciate him joining us the reason i wanted to get him on was the bombing last week
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:45.840]  and we've got him on now which we now was an islamist operation uh Muhammad's Quran dot com
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:53.520]  that's at Tommy Robinson on twitter and we have pakistan muslims is just today pakistan muslims
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:57.920]  beaten right christian boy police side with the perpetrators saying well it's a christian we're
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:03.280]  allowed to rape you it's that's why the globalist like islam since it's a pedophile operation
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:09.520]  by the people that actually adhere to it islam is also our history EU finance exhibition you know
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:15.680]  basically in a church guts it puts on islam but don't worry the british school to be ready to help
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:23.200]  trans friendly it is wonderful go there immediately and then i've got um here uber bands uber's
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:28.000]  band in london because of mass islamic rape you know using them basically as a spider hole you
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.920]  think you're calling an uber you're really calling a refugee driving one and then we got a guy that
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:37.120]  raped five little girls including one seven another refugee in new hampshire and the media is of course
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:43.680]  very very happy to cover that up so tommy robinson joins us right now from the what's left of the
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:49.040]  united kingdom from london stand where city con told us twice in the last few years get used to
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:52.960]  islamic terror those are actual quotes that we probably cue that up again this is just quite
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:59.280]  normal acid attacks bbc tells you how to put makeup on after the daily acid attacks so tommy the only
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:03.280]  questions why are you standing in the way of cultural enrichment and we now know these new
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:07.440]  refugees that carried out the bombing last week had been brought in by the government in the last
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:12.960]  two years when we're housed they were children at what 21 years of age so uh this is all part
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:20.400]  of the sickening evil all part of the ceremony i guess of destroying western culture what i can
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:26.560]  understand is that to 21 years old he's still housed with foster parents and these foster parents
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:33.040]  were awarded or given an award off of our queen for housing and all of these now when you listen
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:38.080]  to the the things coming out from them the majority of the children they're now taking in
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:44.080]  our refugees from syria from iraq from eritrea from these places but they're not children as we
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:48.400]  were at the time you know at the time when all these children these so-called children there was
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:54.480]  a big influx of them we had celebrities gary linacan lily allam all of them saying that everyone was
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:19:00.160]  racist or bigots even pierce morgan for refusing some and at that time i went back and dug out a
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:06.640]  video we made at that time which was just to point out these are not children these are not children
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:12.160]  and they are going to come back and bite us and that's exactly what's happened and and still now
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:17.680]  that's the problem it's not like it's not like we learn anything from these attacks it's a shame
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:22.720]  because every time there's a attack you think we'd be learning but we don't no instead your own
[02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:27.040]  prime minister everybody else acted like trump did it because trump said it was a terror attack he
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:31.920]  said it was islamic they said that was wrong of course it was then they said he was bad our news
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:38.240]  over here was just trump is evil oh no i know i don't know that's all our news is in fact i just
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:43.600]  met someone earlier as part of the documentary and he said exactly the same as we're sitting there's
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:50.960]  all about trump and he said trump trump called every mexican a rapist no he didn't no he didn't
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:55.760]  and all the things which he said i said this is the problem we have with the media or people like you
[02:19:55.760 --> 02:20:00.000]  and and i saw i was actually away i was in spain as this was happening as his terrorist attack was
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:05.520]  happening and i saw the backlash against trump and it's simply again for telling the truth and i'm
[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:11.120]  there i don't know man i'm the only one good deal positive things come from the last three or four
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:16.800]  days is um is uber being banned in london which is but for me it's great let's talk about that
[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:22.080]  because how much can people take 10 million people the last five years 80 percent military
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:28.240]  aged men according to even the un eu and inner poll they're just i mean there's so many islamic
[02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:34.480]  attacks now hammered attacks acid attacks knife attacks including here and in canada i mean i
[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:39.840]  can't even keep track of them all and just the raping and the and you're walking your dog they
[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:47.520]  attack you because the dog's unclean i mean these are some really arrogant people with regards to uber
[02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:55.120]  so london's london's black cab trade is the last predominantly white working class trade in london
[02:20:55.840 --> 02:21:04.480]  is that it's a 400 year old historic industry it's it's viewed upon as the fifth emergency service
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:10.160]  if you're in if you're in trouble you have the london black cabs they will help you if you're a female
[02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:16.000]  on your own they will save you they will act as the eyes for the capital city they are a skilled
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:20.560]  trade they've worked for four years and they have their business opportunity they have the
[02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:25.840]  they have the knowledge as it's called very famous the model of cabs worldwide so professional so
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:31.120]  nice now you go to london it is falling apart please continue yeah that's it so you have the
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:37.280]  knowledge and we have a thing i believe 20 000 black cabs now overnight we had a hundred thousand
[02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:44.560]  uber drivers now you just have anyone can see it uber drivers are Somalian Eritrean Syrian
[02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:49.600]  they cannot even speak english you see them so many times going up the wrong way down one way
[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:57.760]  streets in london that's before that's before we get on to the rapes the crime the statistics
[02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:03.680]  the violence we've had the attack that happened outside our queen's house outside buckingham
[02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:08.720]  palace where where a terrorist went and he tried to pull out and kill police officers that was an
[02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:14.560]  uber driver that we've sent me multiple offenses and terrorist offenses are linked to uber drivers
[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:20.560]  and that's why what this what this was an attempt on which it may be different you see uber may be
[02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:25.360]  different in different parts of the world in different cities but in london uber is simply
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:31.840]  an islamic ferry and it is driven by by by immigrants who have come here who are disrespectful
[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:36.400]  to our women disrespectful to our laws and disrespectful to our country obviously not all
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:42.400]  of them but on par that's what we see which is why i've been very vocal against uber since
[02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:47.600]  i was about to say what the islamists do it's like you go to any airport somalis are the only ones
[02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:55.680]  that run the the parking areas that run the cab areas and that also run uh the rental areas i mean
[02:22:55.680 --> 02:23:02.240]  i've been all over the big big areas minnesota dc uh seattle it's incredible and i've asked them i
[02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:07.920]  looked it up they have lobbies and guilds that go to the airports and lobby to have the lowest
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:14.720]  level bid then they all get on welfare undercut everything i know it's the same in your country
[02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:19.760]  and then they take control then once they've got control of uber say in london then they only start
[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:24.160]  hiring other islamicists that's how this works it's exactly
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:31.280]  tommy robertson's our guest this guy just broke out for a moment he was saying that's exactly
[02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:36.160]  how it works and again it's all incredibly discriminatory and it's happening using the
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:42.000]  west openness you were saying that's exactly what's happening tommy you're back that's exactly what
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.920]  happened that's exactly what's happening and if you go to he throw airport and actually what they
[02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:51.120]  were doing i i had a conversation this this is what really where it really gets to me i got in
[02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:56.560]  a taxi i had a conversation with cab driver who told me his life his daily out going to his daily
[02:23:56.560 --> 02:24:01.520]  bills how much he has to work then he told me what happened when uber got in his whole marriage
[02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:07.920]  was broken down he went from he went from working 12 hours to having to work 18 hours he said he
[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:13.520]  sleeps in his car he's having he's having to do this for exactly the same and this is the difference
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:19.520]  when he goes home he has a mortgage he pays his tax and he has a family and they live in one home
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:25.680]  one family in one home the uber drivers the comparison they're on benefits they share a
[02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:30.560]  license amongst many of them when they get home in one house there'll be three or four families
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:35.280]  they've all come in as refugees they've all come in as immigrants it's just not it's not sustainable
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:39.680]  for an english man what it does is drive down the wages in the culture of the giant sucking
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:45.760]  show and you followed individual drivers and they're sleeping in their cars destroys our ability
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:50.480]  and what we was nearly close to doing you know anyone from abroad in your countries you look at
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:55.200]  london you see what you see the the the iconic things would have been the red phone box they're
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:25:01.040]  gone the black cabs would have been gone the black cabs are the last english trade in that
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:06.320]  capital city for you for tourists to come over to our country and get into a taxi and speak to an
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:12.240]  englishman that is the final opportunity they have because once that black cabs gone once they've
[02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:17.120]  gone and that trade is this it disappeared then all you have is Somalis there are trades there's
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:22.400]  nothing left of london after that there's nothing left to london and that's where i said it's such
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:27.280]  an important issue it's such an important let me tell you my story and i've been to england many
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:34.400]  many times the last time i was there it happened twice i would try to get a cab to the hotel that
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:38.640]  was very close to the airport and because i was going all over england so i wasn't going to stay in
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:46.000]  london itself and i was in Heathrow and they said uh sorry it's it's 50 pounds and i went well i've
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:52.640]  asked it's supposed to be like 10 to take me to the Hyatt that is literally a mile away and i would
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:56.800]  go down the line and all the muslims would laugh at me and say no and they weren't just doing it to
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:00.880]  me i thought maybe they know who i am they were doing it to other families people from spain they
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:06.160]  were doing it to people from japan finally there was one old british guy he takes me for the 10
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:11.120]  pounds i give him like 20 he goes this country and what it is anymore they do that all day i gotta
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:15.680]  watch it and nothing has ever done about it i report it nothing's done it's illegal and these
[02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:21.200]  were cab drivers you have to understand okay uh you're driving the black cabs and also the yellow
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:26.640]  ones and you know the old-fashioned looking cars and it happened to me the next time i mean it's
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:32.720]  crazy how do they get away with this that's what i've watched my whole life in the taxi
[02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:37.360]  trade in lutan where there's been actual murders there's been murders and gang violence amongst
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:42.640]  the cab treats to control the streets and it's like what i said if you control the streets you
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:48.720]  control the city control the town and that's what happens and you see them coming unmasked in numbers
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:54.000]  as we've grown up in lutan with taxis there's every problem with taxing hundreds of them will come
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.880]  but this is not the same and know what we get told this is what we've been told because with the
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:04.640]  sex exploitation the grooming gangs that we've all seen across the uk the taxis the muslim taxis
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:10.080]  have been a pivotal part of that to ferry the children around you know what our politicians come out
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:15.040]  and say is the reason for this is opportunism of opportunism and let me stop you there let me stop
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:18.720]  you there you were the first to say a decade ago they were grooming girls en masse now mainstream
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:24.640]  papers say per town thousands of little girls some of which end up being killed many of which
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:29.440]  are forced into sex slavery by the muslims and the police are so corrupt they will do nothing
[02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:35.440]  about it but that's it and it sounds so it's you know if you listen to that it sounds so crazy
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:41.520]  that's how that's how it is 1400 girls is an estimate a low estimate it's actually a lot
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:47.040]  more than that that's in one small northern town then now they've identified 74 british towns
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:51.840]  that muslim gangs have been burying these children from one town to the other all connected they use
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:58.320]  taxis as a major way of doing this nothing's been done nothing's been done at all all over the years
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:04.240]  now why what what we keep saying is because we get we get told it's because because of the opportunity
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:08.640]  that's why these muslim taxid drivers are involved in it well non muslim taxid drivers aren't doing
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:14.720]  it they're not burying just just today alex just today another four muslim men have been found guilty
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:20.880]  and convicted in the city of newcastle and where just three weeks ago another 18 men were convicted
[02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:27.440]  in that same city all muslim men all from different backgrounds but maybe turkish Kurdish but um
[02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:34.640]  because part of islam is sex trafficking women and children it's what their business was before
[02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:40.000]  it's what it was before that area was muslim the crossroads there at mecca are on record to have
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:47.120]  been a slave trading uh crossroads to the entire middle east at that time it's a fact and women
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:54.320]  are lower than low under this culture sex slavery is legit muhammad said i know if you
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:59.280]  read the life of muhammad you'll see it as he walked past one of his own men he said have you
[02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:05.760]  devoted to you yeah his his other man said no he said give out here these are stories and multiple
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:10.720]  times if you pick up the quran it says multiple times you can take outside of your four lives take
[02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:15.760]  whatever your right arm possesses the arm of the sword you can take non muslim women as sexual slaves
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:21.360]  outside your four lives that's right you are seen as animals by the muslims and they teach them in
[02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:26.400]  their uh madrasas to tell everybody they're friendly everything's great and then you are openly seen
[02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:31.600]  as an animal to be fed on because you're in the house of war you're not in the house of islam
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:35.680]  but of course they can't stop it once they have total control they just keep killing each other
[02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:39.520]  uh because everything's the house of war because it is a giant army of pedophiles
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:48.080]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:57.040]  astonishing antifederalist patrick kenry was opposed to the constitution fearing it would
[02:29:57.040 --> 02:30:01.120]  become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it but
[02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:06.400]  that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty his warnings ignored have now come to
[02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:12.080]  pass he said you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased nor how you were to become a great
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:17.280]  and powerful people but how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be the direct
[02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:22.080]  end of your government patrick kenry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor ever
[02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:27.520]  will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them today everything
[02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:33.040]  the government does at every level is concealed from us we have trade deals to manage our economy
[02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:37.440]  that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see later in life patrick kenry looked
[02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:42.160]  back and said when the american spirit was in its youth the language of america was different
[02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:48.160]  liberty sir was the primary object today our primary concern is safety and comfort when

[02:31:59.280 --> 02:32:04.960]  years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully
[02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:10.400]  aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do
[02:32:10.400 --> 02:32:16.160]  today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting
[02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:22.320]  killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have concentrated
[02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:29.840]  bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging

[02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:22.720]  they call us walking corpses i don't want to be in your islamic hell
[02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:24.720]  oh
[02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:27.280]  ain't no mystery
[02:33:29.840 --> 02:33:31.520]  why i'm in misery
[02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:38.400]  so back in the early 1970s they had arrested lynn danzig for wearing makeup known to one of his shows
[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:48.720]  in um london because he was a punk rocker they want to lock us up put us in their pretty pens
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:56.480]  but now london isn't a british hell i think it's a nice city it's an islamic hell
[02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:02.160]  and i want to ask tony robinson and then interspersed some of your calls on a bunch of different
[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:08.560]  subjects tony's a smart guy can comment on those what does he think the big end game here is
[02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:12.880]  we know the left satellite with islam we know this is happening we know that a lot most muslims i
[02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:18.080]  know actually don't want to be under orthodox islam and are in their own bullied crazy system so
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:22.480]  let's be honest a lot of them actually do just want to go get a degree and have a job and you
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:29.360]  know drink beer and watch football but they're all hin packed by the men that control it and then a
[02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:35.280]  lot of the imams are not these upstanding guys you hear just like a lot of the christians aren't
[02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:43.920]  they are gangster controllers and then i see hillary the the uh previous british government
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:50.000]  the french and others supporting radical orthodox islam to take over and overthrow the countries
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:54.480]  where women go to college where people want to get rid of the hajib uh where they want to be
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:35:00.960]  westernized so i want to ask tony robinson of the rebel media best-selling author of mohammad's
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:06.320]  caran which i know is out sold out right now and he also wrote a previous book what is the enemy of
[02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:12.560]  the state but but tony why or or if you disagree explain to me why is the left selling out is it
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:19.600]  just for short term power or the left historically so hate squares not that we're really squares we
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:25.520]  just want to have a decent life and be be honorable that there's some type of weird cuckolding or they
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:30.320]  get off on allying with islam because they're scared of it because it won't compromise and so
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:35.680]  they think it'll be their friend because the more you appease it most the islamists go hit gay bars
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:42.080]  and liberal rock events and and i mean the the the muslims tend to attack the people that are already
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:49.120]  bowing down to it i'd say it's a mixture i'll say what we're seeing what we're seeing politically
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:55.920]  in the uk is the left and the labor party understand in the future better than we do
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:36:01.840]  and so say for example in lutan again if i bring you back to lutan the the demographical change
[02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:07.040]  for lutan by 2030 now these are government figures now for those who don't know lunes
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:13.440]  lunes is my birth town lunes 30 miles north of london it has a population of 200 000 people
[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:20.400]  50 000 of which are muslim now the labor party regain power every year through the muslim vote
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:27.920]  that's every year now but the the demographical change by 2030 the pakistani and bangladeshi community
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:34.000]  are going to increase by 70 the 77 percent well our community is going to increase by
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:39.040]  one point three to one point four so the labor party simply understand fully where the future
[02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:43.200]  lies in the town of lutan now if i bring you to manchester i've i've been i've been researching a
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:47.840]  lot for manchester because i'm doing a talk so it's a purely sociopathic decision but why did
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:53.520]  they begin the islamic invasion i mean you have the plan going back what a hundred years ago with the
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:37:02.080]  austrian count uh who famously uh had that whole calari plan where they wanted to do this this has
[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:07.280]  been a plan for a while yeah yeah so i'd say that's why i say it's a mixture of things that on the
[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:12.080]  ground in different cities it's different people different reasons regaining power keeping power
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:17.920]  understanding that islam is probably going to be help them with the future power of towns and cities
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:24.480]  with regards to the flooding and the introduction of north africa into europe as one big superpower
[02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:31.040]  and bringing everyone together in order to have a great colored great colored population um
[02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:37.520]  that's that's a different story i'd say to what we're seeing so that the original reasons for
[02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:42.480]  doing it and the original operation of doing it and the influx of people ever being this race of
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:47.840]  recent refugee crisis that differs then when you get to the towns and cities for example
[02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:54.320]  manchester which is where the last bombing was the islamic community doubled over 10 years is
[02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:59.360]  currently at 100 000 people in that city so in another 10 another 10 years at the same rate
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:04.800]  there will be 200 000 people now andy bernum who's the mayor of manchester the labor party
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:11.040]  mayor of manchester who was very vocal after the recent terrorist attack now he works hand in hand
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:17.200]  side by side shares platforms with radical extremist organizations called men one of
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:23.360]  the imams for men talking in a greater manchester mosque he told his congregation and this is all
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:29.920]  this is all recorded he told his congregation all political parties will work with us because we
[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:37.120]  now can we can swing the vote on 30 seats in parliament so let's explain because they vote as
[02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:43.200]  as one cult block it doesn't matter what the majority even wants they will be under islamic
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:50.960]  rule which is desperately craved for 1400 years and is the religious race consciousness of the
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:57.360]  political movement well we recently had an election and labor gained 36 and andy bernum
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:01.760]  and all these people that's the question that most people ask why would they be working with them
[02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:05.760]  why would they be hand in hand with the radical extremists because they will regain power and
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:10.480]  they will keep power they will get they will get power through work and that's exactly it
[02:39:10.480 --> 02:39:16.960]  they organize in lute and we have the the central council of mosques and they have one leader and
[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:22.240]  that one leader is in charge of 30 mosques and he sits down and does deals with the council
[02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:26.640]  and this is when we that's what americans need to understand is the point on which we become
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:33.120]  completely irrelevant white english caste white working class irrelevant you're irrelevant in
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:40.000]  the scheme of the democratic process now remember that only 30 to 40 people in the uk 40 percent
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:45.680]  of people in the uk now vote but that's what we see at the level of why now why are they doing this
[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:51.600]  in this city why is it happening in this city why are they giving full islamic islamic full control
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:55.280]  why are they getting everything they want because they regain power and they will keep power with
[02:39:55.280 --> 02:40:00.240]  them now the original reasons for the flooding which we've seen when you look at what's happening
[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:04.960]  in sweden i can sit there and cry when i go through country from country and i hear the stories and
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:10.400]  read the stories you probably do it yourself you drive yourself insane i read the story daily of
[02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:13.840]  what's happening to women and what's happening at the hands of these men what their men are saying
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:19.200]  to them and just think that an invading army has come into europe they're raping their way through
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:24.240]  it and then european men are sitting on their backside sitting watching these tenders on tv
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:30.000]  and that and it's just to pull your hair out of the cowardice that we've bred the cowardice that we've
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:34.960]  bred and it's like and everything is siding on their side we've been the media the politicians the
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:41.840]  police the government it's all for them it's all to help facilitate this invasion whilst you think
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:45.920]  you're pulling your hair around screaming to your blue in the face trying to oppose it or
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:49.760]  trying to highlight it and trying to not trying to know the maddest thing is trying to know what
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:54.960]  we should do to try and stop it because we can see it happening and we can see that we can see
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:41:00.560]  the change with our own eyes anyone can and okay it's like i had a i had an interview earlier
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:04.880]  when the interview the man who's interviewing me was talking about how people were judging
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:09.520]  all these things on headlines and papers which were fake news i said we don't need headlines
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:14.560]  we see it with our own eyes we know the people affected we know the girls we know the mums
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:20.240]  we know what's happening sorry i'm getting myself wound up and frustrated by it i do every time
[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:26.560]  tony continue uh breaking this down as somebody on the front lines who first really raised the
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:35.600]  alarm okay continue i first raised the alarm in 2004 first time i and you and this is all
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:41.120]  recording i organized a demonstration called ban the loot and taliban that's why i called it and
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:47.040]  that was because at that time what i wasn't aware of after the bezlem massacre after the bezlem massacre
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:52.000]  i watched from my i watched online as local muslims in my hometown who i had no idea who they
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:57.440]  were local muslims in my hometown said an attack like this will be justified on a brick on an
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:03.040]  english school now mark my words alex an attack on our one of our schools is coming in it's coming
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:09.520]  soon they are going to attack our schools every single school currently in the uk are practicing
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:14.720]  emergency lockdowns the children have to hide under the tables they have to act as our intruders are
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:19.440]  in the schools that's what they're practicing now i thought it was just my kid school i thought it was
[02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:23.440]  because it was my kid until i speak with other parents and i see that these are going on across
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:26.720]  the whole country they're getting the children ready because they know they're going to attack
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:32.000]  a school we go to the jury schools they've got palm-proof windows they've got massive massive
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:36.320]  areas around them where they have men walking to protect them we know that these people are
[02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:41.680]  going to attack our kids we know it and we know it and they're doing nothing about it nothing about
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:47.280]  the men the same men are still walking our streets they're still living amongst us and and and i first
[02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:54.000]  saw that in 2004 and that's when i started and my eyes were opened to the is the islamic ideology
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:58.400]  i started reading and learning about who these people were and they had a group in my hometown
[02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:04.480]  called al-majruddin al-mafakri abu hams are their base within my town and they were promoting and i
[02:43:04.480 --> 02:43:10.400]  was so gobsmacked the 21 year old young english lads i started looking and i who are these men
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:16.640]  and how are they able to do this and the 2004 was the first demonstration where i organised all of
[02:43:16.640 --> 02:43:21.600]  our men from football to come out and protest against them and it was called banaloo and taliban
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:27.200]  and in the leaflets it made it clear whites and blacks i've still got copies of these leaflets
[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:32.640]  whites and blacks are being religiously and racially targeted our women have been sexually
[02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:36.720]  abused and groomed these men have come into our communities and they're selling heroin
[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:42.720]  if we know what shops i know what shops they use to sell heroin if i know what shops why are the
[02:43:42.720 --> 02:43:47.440]  police not stopping them why are they not stopping what's happening and and every single thing that
[02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:53.680]  you go along every single thing it's just the level the two tier level of policing and the way
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:58.880]  they allow them what they're allowing them to do to our town that was the start for me in 2004 and
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:04.880]  i've not closed my it's impossible to close your eyes that's the next thing they called him a hooligan
[02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:11.040]  one football fan at the london bridge attack they called him the lion of london bridge fought off
[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:15.360]  and fought three guys stabbing him and saved a bunch of people and the media kind of halfway
[02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:20.160]  criticized him for even daring fight like you're supposed to show your neck to the muslim and say
[02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:25.600]  plunge your knife in here and then the police always pose with them and the government defends them
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:35.280]  even teresa may backhandedly attacks trump i mean this is sick sick sick sick behavior but then if
[02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:40.000]  you mildly criticize islam as you've been arrested and harassed many times but now they leave you
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.480]  alone some of the time because i know you won't back down you have attention they go to universities
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:49.360]  where students criticize isis and they get in trouble or people criticize a terror attack and
[02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:55.840]  the police come after them like they've done something wrong alex i'll send you a message when

[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:10.400]  that he's like it's dangerous for our country the teacher had to go at him they then began speaking
[02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:15.440]  about the burqa at which point he said it's a threat and it needs to be it should be banned
[02:45:15.440 --> 02:45:22.240]  he was sent out of class kicked out of his school class is this your son now this isn't my son this

[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:31.600]  messages from school another school child many of them are school children because what's
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:35.520]  happening in our education system you're not allowed an opinion you're not allowed to tell the
[02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:39.760]  truth well i've been reading where they even take them to mosque they make them go to mosque
[02:45:39.760 --> 02:45:45.680]  every every single child goes to mosque every single child goes to mosque now and it would
[02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:50.000]  take me this is what winds me up you give me the name of the mosque they're taking them to

[02:45:55.520 --> 02:46:00.960]  you past speakers who are bigots who are fascists who the the the sheer fact that you're bringing
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:06.240]  our children to these places the sheer fact that you're doing that and that we're supposed to just
[02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:10.000]  and do know when some parents say they don't want their children to go they have to sit outside the
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:15.280]  office like they've done something wrong like they're being punished and that's the problem
[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:20.480]  even in the education system currently now i had one child messaging me who's then suffering from
[02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:26.160]  mental health issues because of the targeting he had at school he said the police two two men in
[02:46:26.160 --> 02:46:31.360]  suits which are police officers come to see him because he said islam is a fascist ideology
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:36.480]  and a violent ideology and that's the truth your opinion lies in our children for telling the truth
[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:41.360]  i i i've seen this myself i've seen this with my own children i've seen what's going on in
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:47.760]  schools i've seen what the teachers are pushing tony what do we do i mean what do we do to stand
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:55.360]  against this it's it's it's it's it's knowing that that is the question that and all i've said is
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:59.920]  for years i've had this even off my wife you can imagine my wife my mum and dad just saying stop
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:05.360]  stop stop stop stop stop what can you do what can you do and this is where even my my wife's now
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:10.720]  and i come home muslims were setting fire to poppies they were burning poppies on remembrance day
[02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:16.320]  on our most important day during a two minute silence and they were screaming burn soldiers burn
[02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:21.440]  british soldiers burn and i was arrested that day for trying to prevent them burning burning
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:27.600]  those poppies now when i got home my wife my wife's name was there with her mum and they said
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:32.560]  you've been arrested again i said yes i have you expect me to stand there while men burn our
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:38.240]  most our most sacred symbol whilst our old people have to walk down the street and hear terrorists
[02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:44.160]  screaming burn soldiers burn british soldiers burn i said no and and and then she said it's too late
[02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:50.720]  it's too late and i said this is where we have to really rise up because it's not too late it's a
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:55.840]  dangerous time but realistically five to ten percent of our country's muslim if everyone had that
[02:47:55.840 --> 02:48:01.840]  opinion that that weak opinion that that that opinion that is too late in in the thirties we'll
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:06.800]  be german and we'll be prog margin doing doing hitler's solutions and people didn't have that
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:12.000]  opinion you know people back then would run they kiss their family to buy they'd be 40 years old
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:15.840]  and they'd be lying and pretending they're 16 they'd be pretending they're 16 so they could go out
[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:19.840]  and buy in fight for britain and save our country and right now everyone's scared to even pull their
[02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:24.560]  curtains back or talk people are scared to open their mouths and that's because they've got most
[02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:29.520]  people financed up to the hill mortgaged up to the hill in a position where if you talk at work
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:34.480]  you lose your job and then you can't provide for your family which i'd say has purposely been done
[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:40.000]  been done as well so they've got a populace that it can be controlled through fear and intimidation
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.720]  starting at the top as soon as you express your free speech they come banging down on you and beat
[02:48:44.720 --> 02:48:50.320]  you down and i this is time and time again you see people in every in in every industry in the
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:56.400]  uk who are losing their jobs being penalized and being being taken in to simply telling the truth
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:03.600]  about his life now i remember going to east germany last year and meeting men from east germany who
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:09.520]  were protesting these issues and they said we've seen this before i said what do you mean he said
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:16.560]  this is communism reinventing we've seen you can't talk about it you lose your job you can't speak
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:22.080]  about it he said what we're seeing now with the way that these are older men he goes we live through
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:28.400]  this we live through this with it's exactly the same it's just a new enemy it's a new ideology
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:32.720]  it's islam and exactly the same and that's why you see in countries like east germany in the
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:37.680]  check republic in these countries that know what it's like to fight for your freedom they fully
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:41.680]  understand what's happening and they're fully out on the streets they're prime ministers whether it
[02:49:41.680 --> 02:49:46.000]  be the president of check republic whether it be their politicians in hungry whether it be people
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:51.360]  who experience this oppression on your on your freedom they know what it's like you go to west
[02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:56.000]  germany west germany compared to east germany they're all embracing it and sucking it up they
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:00.960]  think it's something to be celebrated they had no idea we have we have no idea in our generation

[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:19.360]  they're gonna happen and islam will do exactly the same to our country and it's done to every

[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:28.240]  take calls on a bunch of different issues but the reason i raise all this is there's the entitlement
[02:50:28.240 --> 02:50:31.520]  by the islamist and now that their numbers are high enough they know they've compromised our
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:36.160]  governments they are very arrogant in major publications that they're going to conquer us
[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:41.760]  they say your women belong to us and now the police in most areas treat them like they are godlike
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:48.800]  royalty so i'm gonna ask why are the islamists so arrogant is that all i mean just what is it and

[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:19.920]  Tommy Robinson is our guest we have a very informative guest the owner of a wonderful radio
[02:54:19.920 --> 02:54:25.440]  station up in Chicago Matt Dubiel that carries our show he's gonna be hosting the fourth hour I
[02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:29.600]  know I should go to these calls Jeremy and Angie and Ryan and Dan and Nick we're talking to Tommy
[02:54:29.600 --> 02:54:34.080]  Robinson and there's all these other subjects there but if you want to know what we're facing
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:39.600]  as a culture in a society just look what the government's doing with orthodox radical Islam
[02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:45.760]  and it it tells you and we really are under assault and our elites are allied with it they
[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:49.280]  didn't go into the Middle East to defeat it they went in the Middle East to knock out the guys that
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:54.560]  weren't bad to put the bad guys in charge and that's now declassified Obama and Hillary did help
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:55:01.040]  create ISIS the Democrats are trying to block Trump crushing ISIS so this that's why the Hollywood
[02:55:01.040 --> 02:55:06.080]  hates Russia because they're fighting Islam Tommy your take on Russia and all the demonization
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:10.400]  of Russia and the fact that they've gone back to being Christian or fighting for their survival
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:15.360]  as well in Eastern Europe you know not committing suicide that that may be the only areas left in
[02:55:15.360 --> 02:55:21.040]  the West is what what used to be the pure West politically and Christian wise until they got
[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:27.760]  overrun by Islam dozens of times that's why they have the ancestral memory of being overrun
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:32.960]  you've just been to Europe do you speak to that yeah if you look at Eastern Europe it'd be Hungary,
[02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:38.160]  Poland, Czech Republic which I can see now the EU will now attempt to destabilize those countries
[02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:42.640]  and destabilize their governments that's what I believe they will do because they are the last
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:48.240]  offence they are they are actually speaking for their people Putin is speaking for his people
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:54.800]  right and when you see when you see what the Czech Republic what Poland what Hungary is saying
[02:55:54.800 --> 02:55:59.680]  the reason they're so honest is because they don't have millions of Muslims in their country
[02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:05.040]  that will blow things up and go all sort of shit and crazy as soon as as soon as as soon as Sankh
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:09.680]  said whereas in our countries you know you know in Britain if we didn't have four million Muslims
[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:13.360]  our leaders would be sportswalking very differently about Islam
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:18.960]  they would be but once we're affected and it's in our country which it is and it's so powerful
[02:56:18.960 --> 02:56:23.600]  in our country and it's so dangerous in our country all of our leaders bend over backwards
[02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:28.720]  and that's what we're seeing so we I look and I think the rest of us in Europe need to look to
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:33.680]  Eastern Europe we look to them for guidance and help in the problems that we're going to face
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:38.800]  and you're right again about all this demonization about Putin I don't understand
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:44.240]  I don't understand it in the sense that in the sense that he's not a coward and he's a man
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:48.800]  and that's the that's what seems to be the problem and I know like even one of Putin's top
[02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:53.440]  representatives when they're talking about the problems in France he said if your police were
[02:56:53.440 --> 02:56:59.360]  used to dealing with real things instead of just having LGBT rights which look I know there's problems
[02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:05.280]  in Russia as well but the reality is we as Western Europe have become so weak and pathetic so weak
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:09.520]  and pathetic when you look to Russia you see real men when I look to Hungary I see real men when I
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:15.360]  look to Poland I see real men that's what I see and that's why I'm frustrated at the the average
[02:57:15.360 --> 02:57:21.600]  man that we've created in the West we've become so weak so in your gut are they going to win I mean
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:29.600]  will the West just commit suicide the West is in the process of committing suicide I see this is
[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:36.160]  the problem this is where it gets so there is no peaceful solution to this there is no way of
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:44.080]  sorting this problem out without utter chaos now there's no way so it can't be sorted but at some
[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:48.960]  point we will have to have that our chaos now it's evil people the government's accepting
[02:57:48.960 --> 02:57:53.040]  try and deal with it now now I think it will happen when the pain gets in or when builders
[02:57:53.040 --> 02:57:57.920]  gets in or when one political party gets in that tries to enforce the law the law the laws are
[02:57:57.920 --> 02:58:02.720]  already there try to enforce the law upon the Italian community we'll see mass con mass con
[02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:06.320]  and that'll spread across the whole of Europe so that has that that day has to happen it has to come
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:14.640]  final 30 second comment Tommy I'm set for a second comment America if you're watching this please

[03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:32.000]  wckg uh that is coming up with matt dubiel okay right now let's go back to the phone calls here
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:41.040]  share me in new mexico you're on the air thanks for holding awesome uh thank you hey uh three
[03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:46.320]  things uh two quick comments and then a comment about north korea uh the first one is a request
[03:01:47.040 --> 03:01:51.440]  uh for if you could put if your guys could put all three shows on your internet stream
[03:01:51.440 --> 03:01:55.520]  that's on your website and on the apps because all three shows are not there and
[03:01:55.520 --> 03:02:00.800]  originally they were they were looping and it was awesome but they're not yeah no i set up info wars
[03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:06.400]  and uh i did it and i told folks when we launched the shows they had to be separate streams and
[03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:13.520]  we don't have that yet and so we'd go bankrupt if if i took my show off and put the other shows on
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:20.960]  because they don't bring in half of the revenue per hour that mine does they're great shows they
[03:02:20.960 --> 03:02:26.000]  inform people uh they're important they do a great job a better job than i do in most cases
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:35.040]  but the formula is i can't then print my show in the age of internet for other shows you understand
[03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:43.440]  we must put out more streams not have one stream we all share in north korea see the american system
[03:02:43.440 --> 03:02:50.560]  is you build more you don't have one pizza you have a pizza factory does that make sense totally
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:56.480]  yeah it totally makes sense hey the okay so that thank you for answering that the second question
[03:02:56.480 --> 03:03:03.520]  i have or i guess request is as you know uh pete fantilly still in jail and i was wondering if you
[03:03:03.520 --> 03:03:08.080]  could send one of your smart guys like kit or somebody like that to go have a sit down with them
[03:03:08.080 --> 03:03:13.680]  and tell a story because you know man the dude was it was unarmed and was a journalist and he's in
[03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:19.760]  jail still for reporting and i think that it's a story but you gotta remember what you gotta remember
[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:26.480]  about talk radio that everybody isn't in like 100 informed and in you and i are sitting around a
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:32.640]  camfire right now you've got to say in the bundy case there was a reporter and as we know they've
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:37.120]  already had a couple of trials thrown out the judges have run kangaroo operations they clearly
[03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:41.440]  have and they even put a guy in there and it's questionable if he ever made any threats that's
[03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:46.960]  a dangerous precedent for america for the press we've said all that we've said all that we've
[03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:52.240]  done that we've had reporters there we've covered it all and quite frankly i sent reporters into
[03:03:52.240 --> 03:03:56.800]  the bundy thing and a lot of people use it as like it's a beauty pageant or something that oh
[03:03:56.800 --> 03:04:01.920]  this is our thing info wars you're not even once in here we lead this get out of here it's we're
[03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:07.360]  like absolutely we're gonna let you run your whole deal here uh so you have to understand
[03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:13.200]  i don't stick my arm down woodchippers or in garbage disposals or down badger holes because
[03:04:13.200 --> 03:04:17.040]  you understand you actually go out to these events and stuff people that usually haven't had any
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:21.040]  success and they're at an event they're not really covering it they're becoming the event
[03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:25.040]  and it's very very territorial that's why i don't do a lot of events or go out and do stuff i just do
[03:04:25.040 --> 03:04:30.240]  my little thing here just my little thing if it's okay with everybody and then that's my broadcast
[03:04:30.240 --> 03:04:35.680]  everybody else has their seat makes the call when we've covered the the bundy thing at nausea
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:41.280]  and instead it's all wrong and it's terrible all right ladies and gentlemen stay with us matt

[03:08:12.720 --> 03:08:17.680]  hey it's matt dubial and i'm filling in for alex for the fourth hour if you're watching it info
[03:08:17.680 --> 03:08:24.880]  wars.com you're you may be seeing uh some wacky guy with a set of binoculars and this is one of
[03:08:24.880 --> 03:08:29.360]  those tricks this is one of those propagandist tricks they use have you seen this have you
[03:08:29.360 --> 03:08:35.360]  seen little kim do this they'll show a tight shot this is brilliant and being a guy that's in the
[03:08:35.360 --> 03:08:43.040]  media i own a radio station here in chicago i've been carrying the alex joneshow for years come
[03:08:43.040 --> 03:08:51.360]  out to meet the fine folks at info wars and rob do and everybody there good people and amazing
[03:08:51.360 --> 03:08:57.280]  infrastructure amazing stuff happening there at info wars and so i'm a media guy so when i see
[03:08:57.280 --> 03:09:01.600]  there there he is there's a little kim was with his binoculars and this is one of those things
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:09.840]  that they do in the media and in the propaganda circles namely kim's staff and his ministry of
[03:09:09.840 --> 03:09:17.600]  propaganda is they show kim in certain lights right they want to make him seem a certain way
[03:09:17.600 --> 03:09:25.040]  and if you're a performer you want this if you're a like a magician on the stage doing a show you
[03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:31.760]  want this uh because you want the audience to see the show a certain way if you're the rolling
[03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:38.240]  stones you want the audience to see the show a certain way and even if you're alex jones and
[03:09:38.240 --> 03:09:45.760]  and the info wars crew you want them to see the show a certain way their way happens to be a truthful
[03:09:45.760 --> 03:09:55.600]  way a authentic way a transparent way and the king jung un little kim way rocket man way
[03:09:56.240 --> 03:10:03.520]  is to show kim standing like looking through binoculars and and when it you know it's one
[03:10:03.520 --> 03:10:09.040]  of those things where if if you if they showed you what he was truly looking at and the real
[03:10:09.040 --> 03:10:16.160]  distance between him with the binoculars and whatever he's looking at and they show like the
[03:10:16.160 --> 03:10:22.880]  real shot kind of like when cnn remember when cnn got busted for showing uh for using green screens
[03:10:22.880 --> 03:10:30.320]  and manufacturing news during the gulf war in um in the nineties they got busted they got totally
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:36.480]  busted manufacturing the uh and and sometimes you'll see them do that with a split screen on
[03:10:36.480 --> 03:10:42.160]  fox news or msnbc and things where they'll have two people on the screen split screen but they're
[03:10:42.160 --> 03:10:49.440]  just next to each other they're in the same studio and so why why does kim jung un constantly have
[03:10:49.440 --> 03:10:56.080]  his ministry of propaganda taking pictures of him with the with the uh the binoculars
[03:10:56.960 --> 03:11:01.280]  making him look a certain way well they want to make it look like he's doing important stuff
[03:11:01.280 --> 03:11:11.680]  because if they show the pictures of him that's so kim eating bowls of noodles real fast and playing
[03:11:11.680 --> 03:11:21.200]  uh pokemon go you would not respect him as a uh dictator as a ruthless dictator as a scary man
[03:11:21.200 --> 03:11:28.560]  but boy when they put him in the uh doctor evil when he dresses like doctor evil and i don't know
[03:11:28.560 --> 03:11:36.720]  if he uses a doctor evil voice or not but when they show him in his uh uh doctor evil garb next to
[03:11:36.720 --> 03:11:42.640]  the sharks with freaking laser beams on their heads and then he looks through the binoculars
[03:11:43.360 --> 03:11:53.600]  all of a sudden he looks like a menace and what is so brilliant about our president and but
[03:11:53.600 --> 03:11:58.560]  listen i'm not a trump krishna here i'm not gonna say like oh everything donald trump does this great
[03:11:58.560 --> 03:12:02.720]  everything donald trump does this great oh he's the greatest he's the greatest no he's he's a human
[03:12:02.720 --> 03:12:10.160]  being you know there's a reason why you know the good book recommends that we not idol idolize
[03:12:10.160 --> 03:12:16.160]  anybody it's because human beings men have flaws they all have flaws but you could set it right
[03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:21.520]  there thank you it thanks very much my wife just brought me some coffee as if i don't as if i need
[03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:29.360]  any more caffeine because i'm fired up about kim jong un the rocket man with his binoculars so as i
[03:12:29.360 --> 03:12:37.520]  was saying president trump can do wrong he's not perfect however one of the things he's really good
[03:12:37.520 --> 03:12:44.320]  at one of the things he's fantastic at maybe the best the greatest in the world he's he does this
[03:12:44.320 --> 03:12:53.360]  big league is he immediately shattered the bs that has been built up by little kim's ministry of
[03:12:53.360 --> 03:13:00.640]  propaganda and the rest of the world the western world's arm of the ministry of propaganda which
[03:13:00.640 --> 03:13:08.080]  is cnn yeah i mean they may not be officially on the payroll of kim jong un but they're doing
[03:13:08.080 --> 03:13:16.080]  his bidding every time they show you binoculars and kim jong with his hillary clinton dr evil
[03:13:16.640 --> 03:13:23.200]  outfit i mean they might as well just splice in seams scenes from austin powers and show the
[03:13:23.200 --> 03:13:29.440]  sharks with freaking laser beams on their head because that's what he's trying to purport he's
[03:13:29.440 --> 03:13:35.840]  trying to show that he's macho or whatever the word for macho is in korean i didn't maybe somebody
[03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:42.480]  can look that up maybe that's on the on the wikipedia what is what is the korean word for macho
[03:13:43.120 --> 03:13:50.240]  but he's trying to look macho and what did our president do with one word or maybe two words
[03:13:50.240 --> 03:13:57.920]  depending on how you look at it he called him the rocket man and it was like this is why this guy is
[03:13:57.920 --> 03:14:04.160]  good that doesn't mean he's good at everything doesn't mean he's perfect at everything but man
[03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:14.400]  he just dismantled that lunatic and all the lunatics that follow him in one felt swoop
[03:14:15.760 --> 03:14:18.960]  i heard something but i wasn't sure what it is would you stop the hammering
[03:14:20.400 --> 03:14:25.360]  somebody stopped the hammering i just i didn't catch what you said i could see the timer though
[03:14:25.360 --> 03:14:31.280]  so who am i and what am i doing here sitting in uh this is clearly if you're watching at info wars
[03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:37.920]  dot com we're on the info wars social media channels you see a guy with the info wars t-shirt which
[03:14:38.720 --> 03:14:44.400]  i hope they still have these at the info wars store at info wars dot com this is my favorite
[03:14:44.400 --> 03:14:51.280]  info wars shirt i love it it's got a real gi joe vibe to it people see me i've been in all over
[03:14:51.280 --> 03:14:56.160]  the world in this shirt i mean i washed it in between of course but i've been all over the
[03:14:56.160 --> 03:15:03.280]  world in this shirt okay and everywhere i go this is not an exaggeration everywhere i go people want
[03:15:03.280 --> 03:15:11.120]  to know if i know alex i've i've talked to people in jamaica i've talked to people in ireland i've
[03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:17.600]  talked to people in london and when i'm wearing this shirt they ask me and it's usually a mix
[03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:23.280]  of very well to do people that are spending money in vacationing and staying at these properties
[03:15:23.280 --> 03:15:31.280]  that's that's some of them and then what blows people's minds is the mix the potpourri of regular
[03:15:31.280 --> 03:15:35.520]  people like you and i who come up to me and a lot of times it's people that work at the resorts in
[03:15:35.520 --> 03:15:41.520]  fact i sent alex and his crew a video of one of the staffers i didn't send it to you today guys so
[03:15:41.520 --> 03:15:46.960]  but i'll find it maybe for monday where somebody came up to me at a pool in jamaica we were doing
[03:15:46.960 --> 03:15:52.640]  a live broadcast i was wearing this shirt you can get it at info wars dot com it's my favorite
[03:15:52.640 --> 03:15:57.760]  and it's the black shirt with the it's got a kind of a gi joe america sort of looking it says info
[03:15:57.760 --> 03:16:02.560]  wars and i'm wearing this shirt and and one of the girls that works on the kitchen staff comes up to
[03:16:02.560 --> 03:16:09.040]  me and says do you know do you and she has like a jamaican accent mon and she's like do you know
[03:16:09.040 --> 03:16:15.840]  alex and i was like you do you know who alex is and she's like yeah we all watch info wars
[03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:22.240]  and i'm like come on really five feet from from us i walked down a little bit further to go do
[03:16:22.240 --> 03:16:27.760]  something else after we said goodbye another guy came up to me and asked me about info wars and
[03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:33.440]  alex jones and this was right before donald trump uh took out the trash and pete hillary in the
[03:16:33.440 --> 03:16:43.120]  election and it was exciting so um i am a radio station owner i'm a broadcaster i am a uh a patriot
[03:16:43.120 --> 03:16:49.520]  in my own way um not as much as i'd like to be and it's not easy to be and i'm a father uh you
[03:16:49.520 --> 03:16:54.560]  might have seen the the twitter feed and the cool people at info wars the best staff in broadcasting
[03:16:54.560 --> 03:16:59.520]  by the way i mean he's alex and the crew there have amazing really talented people that really
[03:16:59.520 --> 03:17:04.720]  know their stuff um they asked if they could you know it's cool to show my twitter feed um
[03:17:05.520 --> 03:17:09.840]  and it is absolutely cool because uh the most important thing that i am is a father and a
[03:17:09.840 --> 03:17:17.280]  husband uh coming up in this hour this extra hour uh hopefully alex is is getting his temples rubbed
[03:17:17.280 --> 03:17:24.960]  and having a cool drink even just water or or or some some chilled bone broth because um i want
[03:17:24.960 --> 03:17:30.160]  him to relax a little bit i hope that he's finding some time to relax i've never seen somebody work
[03:17:30.160 --> 03:17:35.440]  so hard so tirelessly so it's a delight for me to be able to lighten the load a little bit and help
[03:17:35.440 --> 03:17:41.120]  out uh but on this extra hour today we're going to be talking about some things that have been
[03:17:41.120 --> 03:17:46.480]  i've been noticing some things that have been happening in chicago we're definitely going to
[03:17:46.480 --> 03:17:51.360]  be discussing the fatherhood and uh what what it's like being a man in america and and those
[03:17:51.360 --> 03:17:55.920]  challenges and we're going to talk about him with a guy that i had the opportunity to interview
[03:17:55.920 --> 03:18:01.680]  and i recorded the interview but we're going to play it uh and and uh the guy is the most popular
[03:18:01.680 --> 03:18:07.280]  podcaster on planet earth in fact he's doing a show tomorrow night it's like a comedy show
[03:18:07.840 --> 03:18:12.880]  in chicago uh which is how i get these guests right they usually have something to promote
[03:18:12.880 --> 03:18:22.240]  but uh this particular guy has been fighting for conservative values and he's ensconced in
[03:18:22.240 --> 03:18:30.080]  hollywood he's surrounded by that hollywood liberal sycambe vibe so we're going to talk to
[03:18:30.080 --> 03:18:35.040]  adam corolla we're going to play that that that interview for you and we're going to talk to him
[03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:44.080]  about exactly how he approaches life and marriage and snowflakes how he has avoided being ostracized
[03:18:44.080 --> 03:18:50.640]  in hollywood like like many before him tim alan uh the what's the girl's name from clueless i can't
[03:18:50.640 --> 03:18:55.760]  think of the her name off the top of my head but she's been in the news uh no not alicia silverstone
[03:18:55.760 --> 03:19:04.720]  the um uh the actress that she's she's a black girl and she's um she's conservative facie yes
[03:19:04.720 --> 03:19:11.120]  she her pictures are all over the place and uh she's been i don't i mean maybe she wouldn't work
[03:19:11.120 --> 03:19:15.440]  anyway maybe she wouldn't get a lot of work in hollywood but the minute you come out as conservative
[03:19:15.440 --> 03:19:20.720]  in any way in hollywood you're typically ostracized that happened with tim alan happened with stacey
[03:19:20.720 --> 03:19:26.160]  stacey dash is that what what her name is and uh it didn't happen to adam corolla i'll tell you
[03:19:26.160 --> 03:19:32.160]  exactly how he's fighting it and how that can apply to our lives we'll talk about that coming up
[03:19:32.160 --> 03:19:36.720]  we'll talk with adam corolla and we'll also talk about mayor bloomberg's two million dollar
[03:19:36.720 --> 03:19:43.120]  spend to keep people in chicago even though he's in new york from drinking sugary drink makes no

[03:24:15.360 --> 03:24:23.840]  hour here at info wars dot com and on uh fabulous radio stations around america and the world uh i
[03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:28.720]  they were uh they were asking me about the cigar i'm smoking in the uh so i'm in my own studio in
[03:24:28.720 --> 03:24:36.160]  chicago and there is no ac in this particular studio that i'm in and chicago is experiencing
[03:24:36.160 --> 03:24:44.720]  unseasonable warm weather now the lunatics will start saying the sea sea that's because of the
[03:24:44.720 --> 03:24:52.320]  climate change and the warming and the globalness and and the and the the emissions no it's here's
[03:24:52.320 --> 03:24:58.880]  what here's what it is i'm gonna explain to you exactly what it is as it was explained to me uh by
[03:24:58.880 --> 03:25:05.840]  my father and by the chicago tribune for years in fact every year they put a story in the chicago
[03:25:05.840 --> 03:25:10.640]  tribune exactly telling you why it got warm like this and it wasn't every year but it was some year
[03:25:10.640 --> 03:25:16.160]  so anyway if you see me sweating it's uh it's a little bit because i'm nervous sitting in for the
[03:25:16.160 --> 03:25:24.400]  biggest radio show on planet earth and it's also mostly because it's like 87 and humid here but
[03:25:24.400 --> 03:25:30.160]  there's something you should know about me besides being a radio station owner and being a big fan of
[03:25:30.160 --> 03:25:37.440]  everything info wars i've never had a cavity and i take that i'm very proud of that and one of the
[03:25:37.440 --> 03:25:43.440]  reasons that i've never had a cavity is because i take care of my teeth it's not easy to do especially
[03:25:43.440 --> 03:25:49.600]  when you have children and you see all the crap that's in the uh the toothpaste that they sell
[03:25:49.600 --> 03:25:54.800]  really it's poison the poison that they sell in the tube at the grocery store um if you look at it
[03:25:54.800 --> 03:26:02.720]  it actually says don't let your kids or yourselves ingest the poison this stuff is poisonous and if
[03:26:02.720 --> 03:26:08.320]  you get more than a little bit of this poisonous stuff in your body you got to call poison control
[03:26:08.320 --> 03:26:16.080]  that's what happens so uh the answer the solution to that is very simply to get the uh super blue
[03:26:16.080 --> 03:26:23.040]  fluoride free there's no poison in the super blue that's the good part and it's now 50 off retail at

[03:26:49.920 --> 03:26:56.240]  this they think like uh that you're not supposed to uh you know eat butter and uh yeah too much
[03:26:56.240 --> 03:27:02.240]  butter is bad and too much salt is bad but actually taking care of your teeth is a better way to keep

[03:27:21.840 --> 03:27:27.440]  is funding i was telling you or is funded i should say i was telling you uh that i have got a
[03:27:27.440 --> 03:27:33.200]  conversation coming up with adam corolla and adam corolla if you're not familiar he hosted the
[03:27:33.200 --> 03:27:39.920]  man show on television he hosted he was in crank anchors he was a radio host uh dr drew
[03:27:39.920 --> 03:27:46.080]  and him hosted a show called love line and uh adam's had a very good career on the radio
[03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:51.280]  um but he's also kind of a hollywood guy and so you might have seen him in movies and on tv shows
[03:27:51.280 --> 03:27:57.520]  he was on dancing with the stars and if you've noticed lately the people in hollywood like tim allen
[03:27:58.080 --> 03:28:02.560]  and there's others there's other conservatives even katelyn Jenner uh bruce Jenner i'm just
[03:28:02.560 --> 03:28:06.720]  gonna i'm gonna call can i call Bruce Jenner that cool i'm gonna call him bruce Jenner uh even bruce
[03:28:06.720 --> 03:28:13.840]  Jenner uh hate mail can go to um uh something at info wars dot com don't send me the hate mail
[03:28:13.840 --> 03:28:20.800]  but bruce Jenner was even ostracized somewhat even though he had the the the transition card to pull
[03:28:20.800 --> 03:28:25.520]  out uh but he's been lambasted for being conservative and what happens in hollywood is
[03:28:25.520 --> 03:28:31.920]  when you're conservative you have uh your your livelihood is threatened sometimes adam has
[03:28:31.920 --> 03:28:38.080]  sort of put a protective bubble around himself and protected himself from that treatment somehow
[03:28:39.120 --> 03:28:45.520]  by the way that is the same protective bubble that info wars has and that's why they sell products
[03:28:45.520 --> 03:28:49.680]  that's why they have the toothpaste and the the t-shirts that you know this shirt that i'm wearing
[03:28:49.680 --> 03:28:55.120]  the info wars i called the gi joe shirt that's why they have that stuff it's to keep them
[03:28:55.120 --> 03:29:02.800]  impenetrable and save them from having to cow tau or change their perspective or their insights
[03:29:02.800 --> 03:29:08.160]  or their viewpoints in order to make a living think of how powerful that is and how liberating
[03:29:08.160 --> 03:29:14.160]  that is i'm hoping that when you listen to my conversation with adam corolla for instance um
[03:29:14.160 --> 03:29:18.880]  you know he's coming to town to promote a comedy show but we started talking about some real issues
[03:29:18.880 --> 03:29:24.400]  how to keep yourself protected and this may apply for you also in your job if you want to have freedom
[03:29:24.400 --> 03:29:30.080]  of speech well freedom of speech isn't always free so how do you insulate yourself well you
[03:29:30.080 --> 03:29:34.000]  could sell your own toothpaste but there's other ways adam will share how he did it we'll talk to
[03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:40.320]  adam in a little bit and we'll talk about chicago's drink tax we're on the march the empires on the
[03:29:40.320 --> 03:29:52.480]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network joe vicks here with info wars dot com today i want to talk
[03:29:52.480 --> 03:29:58.560]  to you about guns why we have them why the bill of rights guarantees that we can have them and why
[03:29:58.560 --> 03:30:04.240]  my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press i believe
[03:30:04.240 --> 03:30:09.840]  every good journalist needs to know why the second amendment must be considered more essential than
[03:30:09.840 --> 03:30:15.600]  the first amendment this may be a bitter pill to swallow but the right to keep and bear arms is
[03:30:15.600 --> 03:30:22.400]  not an outdated dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the redcoats no it is just
[03:30:22.400 --> 03:30:29.120]  as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776 the original amendments we refer to as the bill
[03:30:29.120 --> 03:30:34.720]  of rights contained 10 of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights the bill of
[03:30:34.720 --> 03:30:40.240]  rights came to us with blinders on it doesn't recognize color or class or wealth it protects
[03:30:40.240 --> 03:30:45.840]  not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters but extends even to those we love

[03:33:38.640 --> 03:33:44.720]  himself from the hollywood crowd that wants to essentially steal your income if you if you make
[03:33:44.720 --> 03:33:50.400]  a statement against something they believe in i'm smoking this cigar here and there's a meme on the
[03:33:50.400 --> 03:33:56.240]  internet with hillary clinton on top of a big cigar and i didn't really understand what it was
[03:33:56.240 --> 03:34:00.160]  they said something about it being like an elf on a shelf and i didn't get it at first and then
[03:34:00.160 --> 03:34:05.840]  uh when i heard the word blunt i got it anyway i got some copies of hillary's america that denesh
[03:34:05.840 --> 03:34:12.640]  desuza gave me and i've got at least five copies i'm gonna just give them away randomly uh to some
[03:34:12.640 --> 03:34:18.160]  to some of my twitter followers i'm not a big twitter guy i don't tweet a lot but i thought it

[03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:29.440]  five copies of this randomly to the people on my twitter feed because it would be fun and i want

[03:34:53.680 --> 03:34:59.280]  fighting against the hollywood sort of liberal vibe and and that he's on the phone i let's uh is he on
[03:34:59.280 --> 03:35:09.520]  the phone let's let's take a call from adam now adam yes good day to you sir good day thanks for
[03:35:09.520 --> 03:35:13.680]  having me thanks for being here you're coming back to chicago and this is exciting do you know
[03:35:14.240 --> 03:35:20.800]  on september 23rd the litany of catastrophic events that are being predicted around the world
[03:35:20.800 --> 03:35:27.840]  have you heard what's being predicted well i for me to explain it i'm not the fire and
[03:35:27.840 --> 03:35:32.800]  brimstone guy but you know there's uh there was the eclipse and a lot of these guys on youtube
[03:35:32.800 --> 03:35:39.440]  are saying that there's a culmination of cosmic events that all point to september 23rd and the
[03:35:39.440 --> 03:35:44.560]  beginning of the tribulation are you involved in that is that what you're bringing to uh to the shy
[03:35:44.560 --> 03:35:52.560]  here yeah i was going to kick off the tribulation i was going to announce it on stage but you're
[03:35:52.560 --> 03:35:57.200]  going to tell your audience about it beforehand and i guess i have no choice but to announce it now
[03:35:57.200 --> 03:36:04.400]  yeah i uh i'm going to i'm going to do the ribbon cutting ceremony on the tribulation
[03:36:04.400 --> 03:36:14.000]  the i i'm i want to share with people though what what it is they can expect when when they
[03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:20.080]  go to see you at the uh at the park west on september 23rd because it's not your traditional
[03:36:20.080 --> 03:36:27.600]  stand-up and it's not what you've done in the past is that right that is correct it is a one-man
[03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:36.960]  show it happened that i sort of realized that more than telling jokes and more than telling stories
[03:36:37.600 --> 03:36:44.000]  i sort of like the inspirational stuff and the motivational stuff i just as i get older
[03:36:44.800 --> 03:36:53.680]  i just morphed into someone who really enjoyed motivation and i realize my motivational stories
[03:36:53.680 --> 03:37:01.200]  can be really funny but they can also be sort of motivational so you can get some you know i think
[03:37:01.200 --> 03:37:08.080]  with a lot of stand-up if you're gonna just the guy that you saw those of my just out
[03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:18.400]  kind of what it takes yeah but i oh i almost never do that i drive almost a new car a different car
[03:37:18.400 --> 03:37:24.720]  every race but ultimately what it does is it makes you comfortable in all the cars you drive
[03:37:24.720 --> 03:37:33.120]  not necessarily the fastest but pretty fast pretty quick because your acclimation period is really
[03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:39.360]  fast because you're so used to driving so many different cars with different gear patterns and
[03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:46.640]  shift patterns horsepower blah blah blah so if you take that approach to life and possibly marriage
[03:37:46.640 --> 03:37:53.360]  i think you can get a lot done i think that's uh that's really that's a great point because
[03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:57.520]  there are those guys that say you know just focus on the one thing just focus on the one thing focus
[03:37:57.520 --> 03:38:02.880]  on the one thing um i i guess the argument could be made that you do focus on one thing and that
[03:38:02.880 --> 03:38:09.680]  is being you and you have different vehicles to to do it um but and you mentioned marriage how
[03:38:09.680 --> 03:38:16.880]  long would you would you put yourself up there as a not a perfect husband but uh would you say
[03:38:16.880 --> 03:38:24.240]  that's a success of yours beyond your success that everyone else sees yeah i think i i think i would
[03:38:24.240 --> 03:38:31.920]  i i i don't really think about it that much but i i guess as they say in this town you know coming
[03:38:31.920 --> 03:38:40.160]  on 15 years of marriage yeah not too too shabby i i'd like to sort of think of myself as a good dad
[03:38:40.160 --> 03:38:47.280]  and a good husband a good provider and a decent guy like i i i really just look at myself as fair
[03:38:47.840 --> 03:38:55.040]  in a weird unromantic way like i'm not i'm not spontaneous i'm not sexy i'm not romantic but
[03:38:55.040 --> 03:39:03.920]  i'm very even and i'm very yeah chicks you you get moist you got a guy over here who's very fair
[03:39:03.920 --> 03:39:11.600]  minded um and i just try to go through life sort of in the middle there just treat everyone the
[03:39:11.600 --> 03:39:17.920]  same be kind of fair also means be fair to yourselves you know just don't expect too much
[03:39:17.920 --> 03:39:25.120]  but don't demand too much is this sort of uh reality on reality terms with dr grove like to
[03:39:25.120 --> 03:39:31.120]  say you're in you're out in hollywood california i mean maybe not hollywood proper but you're on
[03:39:31.120 --> 03:39:38.160]  the west coast you've you've sort of developed into what some would say a conservative voice
[03:39:38.160 --> 03:39:42.880]  even though you may not say that and i wouldn't necessarily say that i'm wondering aside from
[03:39:42.880 --> 03:39:50.000]  your your media company and the things that you create on your own are you seeing like a tim alan
[03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:57.920]  and others have said are you seeing any sort of um backlash or um any justification for you not
[03:39:57.920 --> 03:40:03.920]  getting work or or based on your ideals or your other projects like speaking in front of congress
[03:40:03.920 --> 03:40:12.240]  and things like that um you know it's weird so in hollywood you don't there doesn't really need
[03:40:12.240 --> 03:40:19.920]  to be a backlash you can your phone can just never ring you know which i i guess you can call sort of a
[03:40:19.920 --> 03:40:27.200]  de facto backlash but nobody ever calls you and says hey we're thinking about you for this project
[03:40:27.200 --> 03:40:33.040]  but since we heard you speak in front of congress about personal responsibility uh now we're out
[03:40:33.040 --> 03:40:43.280]  so you never know the same way you don't really know if your wife is slowly poisoning you every day
[03:40:44.160 --> 03:40:48.560]  with your breakfast cereal until you die you know like it's like you don't really know maybe you
[03:40:48.560 --> 03:40:55.600]  don't feel as good as you used to but you don't really know the way this town works is it's it's
[03:40:55.600 --> 03:41:06.320]  incredibly liberal and they will decide who's with them and who is not with them so if the things i say
[03:41:07.520 --> 03:41:15.840]  you know legalized marijuana gay marriage what have you consensual crimes they can still call me
[03:41:15.840 --> 03:41:21.520]  conservative it doesn't matter what i say it doesn't matter what i label myself it's just
[03:41:21.520 --> 03:41:30.400]  they'll decide what you are so and they have decided that anybody who essentially crosses
[03:41:30.400 --> 03:41:37.280]  any of their tenant is conservative even if in fact you don't meet the criteria of being conservative
[03:41:37.280 --> 03:41:46.720]  so first things first they decide second thing second they are they talk about being inclusive
[03:41:46.720 --> 03:41:55.280]  non-stop but if you're tim alan you're out that's kind of the way it works they they talk about
[03:41:56.080 --> 03:42:03.040]  inclusivity and they talk about not judging all they do is judge now they don't judge
[03:42:03.840 --> 03:42:10.800]  if you're transgender but if you believe in god they judge that's the way they work
[03:42:10.800 --> 03:42:19.440]  which makes them hypocrites obviously the good news for me is i don't rely on them because
[03:42:19.440 --> 03:42:27.520]  i have my own business right and i never really have so i don't go on auditions i don't submit
[03:42:27.520 --> 03:42:34.400]  spec scripts i don't wait for the phone to ring i don't talk to my agent i don't do anything that
[03:42:34.400 --> 03:42:43.200]  normal people do normal people who work in this business do i go to work every day i do a podcast
[03:42:43.200 --> 03:42:51.920]  i work on uh documentaries i think about writing books i think about you know doing one man
[03:42:51.920 --> 03:42:58.720]  shows i have a thousand projects that i'm getting started with and none of them have to do with
[03:42:58.720 --> 03:43:06.960]  studios or networks or matt danin it's just i go do what i i just go do what i do that's it
[03:43:06.960 --> 03:43:17.680]  which is great for me because i am impervious to whatever is going on out there in this
[03:43:18.400 --> 03:43:23.840]  world called hollywood where you can't judge except for all you do is judge all the time
[03:43:23.840 --> 03:43:32.720]  and i do feel like i'm probably getting judged for no real good reason i you know
[03:43:33.280 --> 03:43:39.840]  take care of my kids pay my taxes i don't hurt anybody and i don't uh and you're fair to anybody
[03:43:39.840 --> 03:43:48.160]  from anything and you're nothing if not fair they just decide are you today the guy that you thought
[03:43:48.160 --> 03:44:00.080]  you would be back when you were a young guy i didn't think i would be anything so i far exceeded
[03:44:00.080 --> 03:44:04.720]  whatever i thought i was going to be because i didn't think about it i i thought about
[03:44:06.160 --> 03:44:13.680]  bmx bicycles and football and that was a that was about it at some point i had a notion about
[03:44:13.680 --> 03:44:20.400]  getting into comedy but the notion was really just so i could get paid because i love cars and
[03:44:20.400 --> 03:44:29.040]  it's hard to drive nice cars or race cars it's super it's a super expensive endeavor so i i had
[03:44:29.040 --> 03:44:35.040]  real i had really no thoughts i also really had no relationship with my dad so i didn't know what
[03:44:35.040 --> 03:44:41.360]  he expected or what he wanted or what he did or who he was because we didn't have i didn't have a
[03:44:41.360 --> 03:44:44.960]  kind of relationship with my parents i didn't have any kind of relationship with my parents
[03:44:44.960 --> 03:44:50.640]  except for they're just sort of home and i just would leave and go eat at other people's houses
[03:44:51.200 --> 03:45:02.480]  so i i really don't i i really had because of my sort of bizarre upbringing which was a non
[03:45:02.480 --> 03:45:10.240]  upbringing i just sort of wandered around thinking what's for dinner and what are we going to eat
[03:45:10.240 --> 03:45:18.720]  like that most of my thoughts from zero to 20 where where am i going to eat that was that was
[03:45:18.720 --> 03:45:26.400]  that was 90 percent of what i thought then later on i just thought how do i get out of driving a
[03:45:26.400 --> 03:45:33.120]  truck and swinging a hammer for a living like i just i fast forwarded to being 40 and i was like
[03:45:33.920 --> 03:45:37.680]  you don't want to be on a construction site when you're 40 like and and what if you have
[03:45:37.680 --> 03:45:41.600]  kids and how are you going to take care of them and how are you going to pay a mortgage and
[03:45:42.480 --> 03:45:45.520]  so that was kind of my next thought and i never had any thoughts about
[03:45:46.080 --> 03:45:50.560]  making millions of dollars in show business i just had thoughts about doing something other
[03:45:50.560 --> 03:45:56.000]  than being on a construction site what what do you tell your kids about the path for the future
[03:45:56.000 --> 03:46:01.920]  are you saying go to college are you saying uh you know go get a start a business what do you
[03:46:01.920 --> 03:46:07.840]  tell i think you have at least a couple of kids right what do you what do you impart on them
[03:46:07.840 --> 03:46:12.880]  knowing what you now know about this liberating experience of being in control of your life
[03:46:12.880 --> 03:46:20.640]  and your business and all that i i'm not i never really was a fan of college i was a fan of work
[03:46:21.280 --> 03:46:27.200]  i want the kids to work i want them to learn i want them to learn how to work and i want them
[03:46:27.200 --> 03:46:35.680]  not to be scared of work and i want them to kind of embrace work and that's what i'd like them to do
[03:46:35.680 --> 03:46:41.040]  so as far as college goes and especially for whatever's going on on college campuses these
[03:46:41.040 --> 03:46:46.640]  days and i could only imagine how bad it's going to be in seven years when they're ready to go to
[03:46:46.640 --> 03:46:54.000]  college um i'd i'd like them to find a passion find an interest find something that kind of
[03:46:54.000 --> 03:47:00.480]  floats their boat and then not be scared to work and that that's it all you need really in this
[03:47:00.480 --> 03:47:05.440]  country all you really need is hard work people people talk about luck people talk about who
[03:47:05.440 --> 03:47:09.280]  you know people talk about white privilege people talk about everything under the sun
[03:47:09.280 --> 03:47:14.240]  they're forgetting the part where you have to outwork everybody and the good news is everyone
[03:47:14.240 --> 03:47:22.160]  is lazy and soft right now so true all you have to do yeah is literally just outwork people that
[03:47:22.160 --> 03:47:28.640]  are scared of work and you'll be fine yeah and and you believe that i mean i believe it but you
[03:47:28.640 --> 03:47:34.160]  really believe that to your core right i mean if you look around at everybody else i don't want to
[03:47:34.160 --> 03:47:44.000]  sound like a blowhard i don't believe it i know it yeah yeah so uh when you're at the um the chicago's
[03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:50.640]  park west theater saturday september 23rd um the i've heard seinfeld and others talk about the climate
[03:47:50.640 --> 03:47:57.440]  of of venues whether it be college venues or comedy clubs or whatever are you experiencing the
[03:47:57.440 --> 03:48:04.960]  sort of seepage of this mentality of in america where it's super political and and super safe
[03:48:04.960 --> 03:48:10.320]  spacey or are you finding that the corolla fans come out and they know what they're getting and
[03:48:10.320 --> 03:48:16.320]  it's good times for everybody i'd say the corolla fans know what they're getting and it's good time
[03:48:16.320 --> 03:48:25.520]  but you can hear the audience if you say something that you may have said a few years ago you know
[03:48:25.520 --> 03:48:33.280]  you'll hear an audible sort of gas that you wouldn't have heard a few years ago you make a gay joke
[03:48:33.280 --> 03:48:38.720]  or you make an ethnic joke or something like that and in the past all you'd hear is laughter
[03:48:38.720 --> 03:48:47.840]  now you'd hear a little bit of a oh what the hey here comes the helicopter adam corolla.com adam
[03:48:47.840 --> 03:48:53.520]  corolla.com is where you get the tickets and uh i will uh i'll see you at the uh at the park west

[03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:06.320]  yeah thanks adam thanks man appreciate it bye bye one of the one of the things that i love about
[03:49:06.320 --> 03:49:13.840]  talking to guys like adam is you find out things about them and life in general from another person's
[03:49:13.840 --> 03:49:19.440]  perspective and i look at guys like alex and guys like adam even though they're in very different
[03:49:19.440 --> 03:49:25.840]  worlds as being very similar these are people that have created their own way and they didn't do it
[03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:30.320]  alone uh they got lots of people you know there's lots of people at info wars that help keep alex
[03:49:30.320 --> 03:49:36.320]  on the other there's lots of people at adam corolla's um ace production studios that help him keep it
[03:49:36.320 --> 03:49:42.240]  going but they've taken the bull by the horns and they've just worked and worked and worked and what
[03:49:42.240 --> 03:49:47.280]  we find out when we talk to guys like that is we all have so much in common and what the world seems
[03:49:47.280 --> 03:49:55.280]  to be doing today more than ever is demonizing men like that demonizing leaders that are strong
[03:49:55.280 --> 03:50:02.320]  that are intelligent that are fair and that maybe sometimes have differing opinions and so um
[03:50:03.280 --> 03:50:09.280]  it's a privilege to be on this platform and sharing some of that with you because i hope that you
[03:50:09.280 --> 03:50:14.080]  listening to this can find a way to do that because if you work for somebody you may not
[03:50:14.080 --> 03:50:19.680]  be able to tweet that you feel a certain way freedom of speech doesn't forgive you from the
[03:50:19.680 --> 03:50:25.440]  consequences of that freedom of speech freedom of speech is something that we have in this country
[03:50:25.440 --> 03:50:31.040]  without government prosecution but the people can prosecute you and persecute you and so how do you
[03:50:31.040 --> 03:50:37.200]  avoid that well kind of share some ideas on that and how do you prepare for the worst whether it's
[03:50:37.200 --> 03:50:42.560]  your income whether it's your livelihood whether it's your home life we're gonna talk more about

[03:51:52.800 --> 03:51:57.920]  the last four or five years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the elite
[03:51:57.920 --> 03:52:03.760]  establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better
[03:52:03.760 --> 03:52:09.920]  nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they
[03:52:09.920 --> 03:52:15.760]  were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have

[03:53:58.720 --> 03:54:04.560]  it's Matthew Biel filling in for Alex Jones from Chicago I don't call it the windy city nobody
[03:54:04.560 --> 03:54:11.440]  here calls it the windy city today in Chicago it is if you can see the video feed at info wars
[03:54:11.440 --> 03:54:15.600]  dot com or whether you're maybe you're just listening at info wars dot com slash show
[03:54:16.160 --> 03:54:22.560]  I'm sweating I'm sweating like a a fat kid at a buffet and the reason is is because it's hot in
[03:54:22.560 --> 03:54:26.240]  here and there's no air conditioning which is why I was just like screw it I'm gonna have a cigar
[03:54:26.240 --> 03:54:33.440]  might as well just add to the to the feverish mix here but you know some would say that this is the
[03:54:33.440 --> 03:54:39.600]  result of of the climate change I like to say like the church late the climate change it's
[03:54:39.600 --> 03:54:44.800]  it's the global warming it's the climate change I don't believe in that malarkey but I do believe
[03:54:46.080 --> 03:54:51.280]  and I'm going to tell you what how my father explained this weather in September to me growing
[03:54:51.280 --> 03:54:55.280]  up and how the Chicago Tribune did but I want to encourage you whether you're in Florida whether
[03:54:55.280 --> 03:55:01.040]  you're in Puerto Rico wherever you are and this was brought to my attention by the author Tim Ferriss
[03:55:01.040 --> 03:55:05.600]  you wrote the book the four-hour work week and I did an interview with him and he was talking
[03:55:05.600 --> 03:55:11.760]  about living in California and if there's something happens in California you're like 15 minutes at
[03:55:11.760 --> 03:55:17.360]  least away from getting help and if there's like a black swan event or a big major earthquake or
[03:55:17.360 --> 03:55:22.880]  something you're not getting any help and people don't really know what to do the the best thing
[03:55:22.880 --> 03:55:27.680]  to do is just to stay prepared and and I'm not talking about in a doomsday prepper you don't
[03:55:27.680 --> 03:55:31.840]  have to go build a bunker but you know maybe maybe you put a little bit of the storeable food at your

[03:56:22.240 --> 03:56:27.360]  the Chicago Tribune would publish and I'm going to get in a lot of trouble you can send the the
[03:56:27.360 --> 03:56:33.600]  comments or the the angry mail to angrymail at infowars.com don't send it to me uh although if
[03:56:33.600 --> 03:56:38.080]  you do want to follow me on twitter I do have a copy of hillary's america I'm going to give away to
[03:56:38.080 --> 03:56:43.360]  six people I have six copies of this but if you looked in the tribune every year at this time
[03:56:43.360 --> 03:56:52.080]  of year they traditionally would print a story called engine summer and it's a story about how
[03:56:52.080 --> 03:56:57.120]  every year at this time if it was a certain year and the climate was right and the weather was
[03:56:57.120 --> 03:57:02.480]  right you'd get another burst of summer and they called it indian summer or engine summer
[03:57:02.480 --> 03:57:08.560]  and they were referencing feathers not dots today of course I don't know if they actually put that
[03:57:08.560 --> 03:57:13.040]  article in the tribune I don't get the tribune I don't know that anybody else does I don't know
[03:57:13.040 --> 03:57:17.680]  that anybody reads a newspaper anymore but every year my dad would cut it out of the newspaper it
[03:57:17.680 --> 03:57:22.640]  was really beautiful it had a nice picture on the top and it had the story of engine summer
[03:57:22.640 --> 03:57:28.560]  and in it had beautiful artwork where they would show the the cascading smoke from a from a fire
[03:57:28.560 --> 03:57:32.800]  you know like a campfire that an indian might have had in the teepees and and all that sort of stuff
[03:57:32.800 --> 03:57:40.560]  a native american okay and the story behind the engine summer is that every few years or every
[03:57:40.560 --> 03:57:45.920]  year or so you might get a burst of warm weather and it was like a little bit of a gift from nature
[03:57:45.920 --> 03:57:53.200]  and you enjoyed it and it's been happening for decades if not centuries if not millennia and so
[03:57:53.200 --> 03:57:57.760]  I don't think it has anything to do with cows farting in the southern hemisphere or the northern
[03:57:57.760 --> 03:58:02.720]  hemisphere or any of those hemispheres for that matter um thanks for listening I've had a great
