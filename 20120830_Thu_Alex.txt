[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:16.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16.920 --> 00:40.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:40.280 --> 00:45.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is already Thursday, the 30th day.
[00:45.840 --> 00:52.040]  The 30th day, ladies and gentlemen, of August 2012.
[00:52.040 --> 00:58.960]  And we are going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:58.960 --> 01:02.760]  Coming up here on the broadcast today, Larry Graphwald,
[01:02.760 --> 01:06.160]  who's been on with us before, he was one of the infiltrators
[01:06.160 --> 01:09.000]  of the Weather Underground, where they openly talked about how
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.760]  once they took over America, they were going to put
[01:11.760 --> 01:14.240]  conservatives, libertarians, constitutionalists
[01:14.240 --> 01:17.840]  in slave labor camps and then kill half of us.
[01:17.840 --> 01:19.640]  They estimated $25 million.
[01:19.640 --> 01:21.880]  And now, since it's in official army documents that
[01:21.880 --> 01:24.600]  we'll go back over today, and I'll give you the code numbers
[01:24.600 --> 01:26.200]  on those so you can look them up,
[01:26.200 --> 01:28.080]  that they have re-education camps being prepared,
[01:28.080 --> 01:32.280]  I think we should talk about this criminal operation.
[01:32.280 --> 01:35.720]  Also, Derek Bros is with Houston Free Thinkers
[01:35.720 --> 01:39.200]  and helped fight the TSA takeover in Houston successfully.
[01:39.200 --> 01:42.280]  He's been in Tampa and has witnessed the TSA
[01:42.280 --> 01:44.120]  groping the carnage, all of it.
[01:44.120 --> 01:46.800]  DrudgeReport.com linked to this story last night.
[01:46.800 --> 01:49.600]  It's since rolled off both sites.
[01:49.600 --> 01:53.040]  We need to get it posted back at infowars.com,
[01:53.040 --> 01:56.960]  but it's in the top story archive, the links up there
[01:56.960 --> 01:58.160]  at the top of the site.
[01:58.160 --> 02:00.440]  TSA harasses Ron Paul and his wife in Florida.
[02:00.440 --> 02:02.120]  Wait till you hear this.
[02:02.120 --> 02:06.760]  They tried to imply he was going to blow up Romney.
[02:06.760 --> 02:10.000]  It's just any way to dominate and exercise power
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.440]  by the quote, security services.
[02:12.440 --> 02:17.440]  The absolute road to real nation and third world them.
[02:17.480 --> 02:19.480]  So we're gonna be breaking all of that down.
[02:20.560 --> 02:23.560]  RNC protesters vastly outnumbered by police.
[02:23.560 --> 02:26.200]  That's thanks to the demonization and intimidation
[02:26.200 --> 02:28.560]  of protesters in the idea of the First Amendment.
[02:28.560 --> 02:32.680]  Texas students revolt against mandatory RFID tracking chips.
[02:32.680 --> 02:34.880]  That's right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:34.880 --> 02:36.520]  They also have GPS tracker.
[02:36.520 --> 02:39.720]  People are revolting against becoming total prisoners.
[02:39.720 --> 02:42.280]  Also, would you pay to use Facebook
[02:42.280 --> 02:44.720]  to help investors recover their losses?
[02:44.720 --> 02:47.000]  That's the new idea.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.040]  And of course, the top Facebook people
[02:49.040 --> 02:52.080]  are all incrementally dumping their stock
[02:52.080 --> 02:54.560]  as fast as they can without plunging it down to zero.
[02:54.560 --> 02:57.040]  It's already down by what, 55%?
[02:57.040 --> 02:59.600]  Also, video shows cop kicking defenseless man
[02:59.600 --> 03:00.560]  on the throat.
[03:00.560 --> 03:03.200]  I've got three videos like this today.
[03:03.200 --> 03:05.560]  And again, we're not just here to bash police all day
[03:05.560 --> 03:07.800]  because that feeds into the psy-op of them
[03:07.800 --> 03:09.920]  that are going into their own gang culture.
[03:09.920 --> 03:12.120]  Just attacking them feeds into the globalist plan.
[03:12.120 --> 03:15.640]  But they're trying to train police
[03:17.360 --> 03:19.920]  over and over and over and over again.
[03:19.920 --> 03:21.840]  They're trying as best they can
[03:22.880 --> 03:26.520]  that it's macho and cool to slap people around.
[03:26.520 --> 03:28.680]  That's why I saw some police patrolling
[03:29.800 --> 03:31.960]  a water hole yesterday.
[03:31.960 --> 03:35.200]  I don't mean a bar, a spring I was swimming at
[03:35.200 --> 03:36.040]  yesterday evening.
[03:36.040 --> 03:39.560]  And I just said, hey, are you guys looking for donuts?
[03:39.560 --> 03:43.640]  Just because it's important to have the police
[03:43.640 --> 03:45.720]  understand that there's a First Amendment
[03:45.720 --> 03:47.760]  and we're going to talk to them
[03:47.760 --> 03:49.440]  because they were walking around staring at people
[03:49.440 --> 03:50.760]  and people were scared of them.
[03:50.760 --> 03:54.680]  And I just thought it was important to let them know
[03:54.680 --> 03:56.840]  that some people will speak to them.
[03:56.840 --> 03:59.640]  I see police in restaurants, I'll walk over.
[03:59.640 --> 04:01.880]  Routinely, I see them grocery stores, I'll walk over.
[04:01.880 --> 04:05.000]  I see them everywhere I go over because it's important.
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.240]  Sometimes I say friendly things,
[04:06.240 --> 04:07.960]  sometimes I say silly things.
[04:07.960 --> 04:09.680]  I ask them, hey, you've been taking all your vaccines,
[04:09.680 --> 04:11.640]  drinking your fluoride, and they're like, no.
[04:11.640 --> 04:12.480]  I'm like, why not?
[04:12.480 --> 04:13.640]  You trust the government, don't you?
[04:13.640 --> 04:16.440]  It's bad to not trust the government, isn't it, right?
[04:16.440 --> 04:18.320]  But government's a good thing, right?
[04:18.320 --> 04:21.040]  No, I don't think that's why I have my rifle.
[04:22.800 --> 04:25.840]  At home and I'm like, oh, okay.
[04:25.840 --> 04:28.960]  Again, when the government fears the people,
[04:28.960 --> 04:30.480]  there is liberty, when the people fear
[04:30.480 --> 04:31.760]  the government, there is tyranny.
[04:31.760 --> 04:34.880]  We got a lot of news, I mean, a lot of news.
[04:34.880 --> 04:36.880]  And I'm gonna attempt to scan over,
[04:36.880 --> 04:39.680]  just kinda hit on when we get back.
[04:39.680 --> 04:43.600]  And then we will take some of your phone calls here.
[04:43.600 --> 04:45.320]  For first-time callers, I'll give the number out
[04:45.320 --> 04:47.040]  when we come back a few times a week.
[04:47.040 --> 04:49.280]  I hope the phone's up for the first-time callers.
[04:49.280 --> 04:50.880]  They give you a chance to sit on hold
[04:50.880 --> 04:52.760]  while I rattle on, I'm joking.
[04:52.760 --> 04:54.600]  Really not joking, I'm making fun of myself
[04:54.600 --> 04:56.600]  and my proclivity to run at the mouth,
[04:56.600 --> 04:58.600]  which is actually why I have a radio show.
[04:58.600 --> 05:03.600]  If you want an American company with American products
[05:05.720 --> 05:10.240]  made by American, here is the Calben Soap Company.
[05:10.240 --> 05:13.400]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products
[05:13.400 --> 05:14.440]  for years.
[05:14.440 --> 05:16.400]  These all-natural soaps are made
[05:16.400 --> 05:19.320]  from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oil
[05:19.320 --> 05:21.760]  that are earth-friendly and safe.
[05:21.760 --> 05:24.720]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com
[05:24.720 --> 05:29.560]  or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[05:29.560 --> 05:31.960]  Buy the one to two-month sample package
[05:31.960 --> 05:34.200]  and enjoy soaps that are twice as good
[05:34.200 --> 05:35.440]  as what you're using now.
[05:35.440 --> 05:39.080]  Or save big with a one to two-year supply of soaps
[05:39.080 --> 05:40.920]  for all your cleaning needs.
[05:40.920 --> 05:42.920]  This is an amazing deal.
[05:42.920 --> 05:44.760]  You can save thousands of dollars
[05:44.760 --> 05:48.200]  and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[05:48.200 --> 05:50.840]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com
[05:50.840 --> 05:55.840]  or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[05:59.840 --> 06:01.960]  The worst drought in 50 years continues
[06:01.960 --> 06:03.600]  and the first six months of 2012
[06:03.600 --> 06:05.400]  marks the hottest half year on record.
[06:05.400 --> 06:08.960]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[06:08.960 --> 06:11.760]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables,
[06:11.760 --> 06:14.320]  and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[06:14.320 --> 06:16.600]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers
[06:16.600 --> 06:19.280]  and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[06:19.280 --> 06:21.040]  The only strategy to counter this
[06:21.040 --> 06:23.680]  is to freeze your food cost in today's prices
[06:23.680 --> 06:26.400]  by getting your own supply of foods from E-Foods Direct
[06:26.400 --> 06:29.040]  now as the price of raw ingredients increases.
[06:29.040 --> 06:30.760]  E-Foods will have to raise prices too.
[06:30.760 --> 06:32.520]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[06:32.520 --> 06:34.920]  I recently increased my supply from E-Foods Direct
[06:34.920 --> 06:36.600]  because we've all known this was coming.
[06:36.600 --> 06:39.520]  You know about their delicious long-term storeable foods.
[06:39.520 --> 06:42.280]  The fact is you can eat it any time to save money today
[06:42.280 --> 06:44.040]  and because it's stored for 25 years,
[06:44.040 --> 06:45.320]  you're locking in today's prices
[06:45.320 --> 06:46.840]  and avoiding the rising food cost.
[06:46.840 --> 06:49.960]  Don't wait, call 800-409-5633
[06:49.960 --> 06:52.760]  or go to E-FoodsDirect.com or slash Alex.
[06:52.760 --> 06:57.240]  Call 800-409-5633 or E-FoodsDirect.com or slash Alex.
[06:57.240 --> 06:59.560]  You can bet your life on E-Foods Direct.
[06:59.560 --> 07:01.880]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks
[07:01.880 --> 07:03.080]  adding poison to your water
[07:03.080 --> 07:05.080]  and laughing as you get sick and die?
[07:05.080 --> 07:07.520]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[07:07.520 --> 07:09.360]  My friends, I've done a lot of research
[07:09.360 --> 07:13.240]  and the best gravity filter out there, Bar Nun, is ProPure
[07:13.240 --> 07:16.600]  and it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[07:16.600 --> 07:18.520]  Its filters are silver and pregnated
[07:18.520 --> 07:20.080]  to prevent bacterial growth.
[07:20.080 --> 07:21.680]  There's no priming required.
[07:21.680 --> 07:23.960]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[07:23.960 --> 07:27.560]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[07:27.560 --> 07:29.120]  Easy to set up and use.
[07:29.120 --> 07:30.560]  Doesn't require electricity.
[07:30.560 --> 07:33.720]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds and wells.
[07:33.720 --> 07:36.320]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals,
[07:36.320 --> 07:37.160]  which is key.
[07:37.160 --> 07:39.000]  Save money by not buying bottled water
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.240]  and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[07:41.240 --> 07:43.960]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[07:43.960 --> 07:46.760]  It's what my family uses, infowars.com
[07:46.760 --> 07:48.880]  already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[07:48.880 --> 07:51.600]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout,
[07:51.600 --> 07:54.720]  you get an additional 10% off at infowars.com.
[07:54.720 --> 07:59.120]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[08:01.800 --> 08:03.960]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[08:03.960 --> 08:08.360]  deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:08.360 --> 08:15.360]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:24.560 --> 08:26.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have found it,
[08:26.280 --> 08:29.000]  the tip of the spear in the information war.
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.480]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[08:31.480 --> 08:32.960]  And we are here Monday through Friday
[08:32.960 --> 08:35.600]  from 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern.
[08:35.600 --> 08:38.480]  We have a big broadcast lined up today.
[08:38.480 --> 08:40.560]  We will be talking to a infiltrator
[08:40.560 --> 08:43.480]  of the weather underground, Obama's mentors,
[08:43.480 --> 08:46.120]  who plan to implode the economy takeover
[08:46.120 --> 08:48.440]  and put 50 million of us in slave labor camps
[08:48.440 --> 08:50.240]  and kill 25 million of us.
[08:50.240 --> 08:54.760]  Now that that is an official Army training manual
[08:54.760 --> 08:56.440]  that mentioned reeducation centers,
[08:56.440 --> 08:58.960]  how to process this VR, social security numbers,
[08:58.960 --> 09:02.520]  how to arrest us because we're politically active,
[09:02.520 --> 09:04.520]  we're gonna be going over the subcodes
[09:04.520 --> 09:07.160]  and subsections of that today
[09:07.160 --> 09:10.320]  with Larry Grafwald coming up to understand
[09:10.320 --> 09:14.160]  how tyranny creeps up on you and then explodes.
[09:14.160 --> 09:16.800]  And again, we're gonna talk to folks from the RNC
[09:16.800 --> 09:19.200]  who've witnessed the TSA on the roads,
[09:19.200 --> 09:21.520]  the buses, harassing journalists,
[09:21.520 --> 09:24.360]  just the hell force that is being released.
[09:24.360 --> 09:27.080]  TSA harasses Ron Paul and his wife in Florida
[09:27.080 --> 09:31.240]  since they thought he may be a danger to Mitt Romney,
[09:31.240 --> 09:33.920]  who wasn't even there at the private airport
[09:33.920 --> 09:35.840]  getting on a private charter jet
[09:35.840 --> 09:37.920]  with his political entourage.
[09:37.920 --> 09:41.320]  They wanted to grope Mrs. Paul
[09:41.320 --> 09:43.360]  and wanted to check for bombs.
[09:43.360 --> 09:45.800]  They said, we think you might have bombs.
[09:45.800 --> 09:49.960]  And the drugs report picked up on that story last night,
[09:49.960 --> 09:51.440]  but it came out after we were on the air.
[09:51.440 --> 09:53.520]  So I'm gonna be going back over that today
[09:53.520 --> 09:54.840]  and it integrates with another report
[09:54.840 --> 09:57.240]  from infowars.com and prisonbunna.com.
[09:57.240 --> 10:00.520]  Video, TSA takes over bus station in Tampa,
[10:00.520 --> 10:02.560]  DHS agents, threatened journalists.
[10:02.560 --> 10:05.640]  So we have those journalists coming on
[10:05.640 --> 10:08.960]  for about 30 minutes in the third hour today.
[10:08.960 --> 10:11.760]  It is a free-for-all in the first hour.
[10:11.760 --> 10:13.240]  I'm gonna just hit some of the headlines
[10:13.240 --> 10:15.160]  that we'll go over more throughout the broadcast,
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.040]  but first-time callers, whatever issue you wanna discuss,
[10:19.040 --> 10:21.640]  all the mainstream news discussing economic collapse,
[10:21.640 --> 10:24.840]  Iran war, al-Qaeda being funded to go into Syria,
[10:24.840 --> 10:29.840]  new fake Navy seal books written via pen names
[10:29.840 --> 10:32.920]  to prop up the official fable that bin Laden was killed
[10:32.920 --> 10:34.560]  that keep changing the story over and over again.
[10:34.560 --> 10:36.160]  It's a complete lie.
[10:36.160 --> 10:39.760]  We're gonna talk about all of this today.
[10:40.960 --> 10:43.480]  And at the bottom of the hour, remind me guys
[10:43.480 --> 10:45.280]  to show this and talk about this on air.
[10:45.280 --> 10:46.760]  We have a new candidate,
[10:48.120 --> 10:51.120]  a new candidate for swimy politician.
[10:51.120 --> 10:52.800]  Now the guy lives in India,
[10:52.800 --> 10:56.320]  but he's such a ridiculous in-your-face deceiver
[10:56.320 --> 10:59.320]  that he would make a great globalist
[10:59.320 --> 11:02.000]  frontman, so we're gonna be talking about
[11:03.960 --> 11:05.560]  that at the bottom of the hour.
[11:05.560 --> 11:07.680]  And my mind wanders, so it's up to you guys
[11:07.680 --> 11:10.000]  out there please to remind me.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.280]  Okay, let me just run down.
[11:13.280 --> 11:14.640]  Wow, I mean, I can't even figure out
[11:14.640 --> 11:18.440]  what is the top story is my problem here.
[11:18.440 --> 11:22.560]  Let's just start here with a Mark Slavo report
[11:22.560 --> 11:26.600]  from the shtfplan.com up at infowars.com.
[11:26.600 --> 11:29.960]  Just in case, state of Alaska to stockpile mass amounts
[11:29.960 --> 11:32.400]  of food and supplies and giant warehouses.
[11:32.400 --> 11:34.040]  Well, all the states are doing that.
[11:34.040 --> 11:35.760]  They're just not telling the public about it.
[11:35.760 --> 11:38.760]  They've built giant warehouses for economic collapse
[11:38.760 --> 11:41.400]  or for disasters.
[11:41.400 --> 11:44.120]  We're gonna be getting into that report.
[11:45.240 --> 11:46.680]  I'm gonna talk about this a little bit more later.
[11:46.680 --> 11:49.440]  Video shows cop kicking defenceless man in the throat.
[11:49.440 --> 11:50.760]  The guy's done nothing.
[11:50.760 --> 11:53.480]  They pepper spray him so they get on the ground
[11:53.480 --> 11:56.280]  and then the guy's coughing a little bit on the ground
[11:56.280 --> 11:58.080]  so he kicks him in the throat.
[11:58.080 --> 11:59.640]  And there's a footage of the police
[11:59.640 --> 12:02.600]  pull a woman over with a cell phone she's on
[12:02.600 --> 12:04.880]  or cell phone and driving in California.
[12:04.880 --> 12:07.320]  Body slammer repeatedly beat her up
[12:07.320 --> 12:08.760]  and then lie on the report about it
[12:08.760 --> 12:10.760]  but the Taco Bell caught it on tape.
[12:10.760 --> 12:13.840]  Again, it's this lying incessantly
[12:14.920 --> 12:18.280]  that is the big problem
[12:18.280 --> 12:20.320]  and it threatens to completely undermine
[12:20.320 --> 12:24.360]  the entire culture and trust in the system.
[12:24.360 --> 12:26.520]  And I think trust in the system should be undermined
[12:26.520 --> 12:28.400]  because it's lost our trust
[12:28.400 --> 12:30.360]  and can't be trusted anymore.
[12:30.360 --> 12:34.880]  But if a system doesn't get corrected
[12:36.280 --> 12:41.280]  and fixed and just sits there discredited
[12:41.560 --> 12:43.240]  it's even worse.
[12:43.240 --> 12:46.600]  So we're gonna be going over some of those reports.
[12:46.600 --> 12:50.000]  Also, the two Americans shot in Mexico last week
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.040]  were CIA operatives, Business Insider
[12:53.040 --> 12:56.920]  and that's being reported by other news outlets as well.
[12:56.920 --> 12:59.560]  Yeah, the Mexican government who's as corrupt
[12:59.560 --> 13:02.960]  as the day is long has pointed out correctly though
[13:02.960 --> 13:06.040]  that the drug war is to keep drug prices up
[13:06.920 --> 13:11.320]  and that the CIA is controlling key drug cartels
[13:11.320 --> 13:13.200]  and allowing them to ship in drugs
[13:13.200 --> 13:15.280]  while trying to knock out the other cartels
[13:15.280 --> 13:17.280]  and that's what this six year war has been about.
[13:17.280 --> 13:19.160]  We told you before the war started
[13:19.160 --> 13:20.760]  with our sources like Celica Steel
[13:20.760 --> 13:24.480]  and others here on air and former DEA and that's what's
[13:24.480 --> 13:28.360]  happening and as the drug cartels start to fight back
[13:28.360 --> 13:30.120]  they're gonna start, I think they're already evident
[13:30.120 --> 13:31.840]  it shows killing people here.
[13:31.840 --> 13:36.840]  So the problem is for the CIA is that the Mexicans
[13:38.120 --> 13:41.640]  aren't afraid and if you wanna start killing
[13:41.640 --> 13:45.160]  they'll start killing right back and it's pouring over
[13:45.160 --> 13:46.720]  and it's pouring over into our country
[13:46.720 --> 13:48.560]  and it's ruined Mexico.
[13:48.560 --> 13:49.720]  Mexico was already in bad shape
[13:49.720 --> 13:52.080]  but it's really bad now.
[13:52.080 --> 13:53.840]  I've got family that loves to travel down there
[13:53.840 --> 13:54.680]  won't go down there anymore.
[13:54.680 --> 13:55.720]  I won't go down there.
[13:55.720 --> 13:57.800]  You can get kidnapped anywhere.
[13:57.800 --> 13:59.120]  Don't believe them when they tell you
[13:59.120 --> 14:00.640]  it's saving some of the resorts.
[14:00.640 --> 14:03.840]  Nowhere is safe in Mexico.
[14:03.840 --> 14:06.600]  Nowhere, nowhere.
[14:06.600 --> 14:08.680]  And this is what America's gonna turn into.
[14:08.680 --> 14:10.640]  This is what the drug war does.
[14:10.640 --> 14:13.440]  The British took down China by shipping drugs in
[14:13.440 --> 14:15.940]  and China was dumb enough to make drugs illegal.
[14:15.940 --> 14:18.360]  They used it to jack up prices, corrupt the police
[14:18.360 --> 14:20.280]  city by city, they finally took over
[14:20.280 --> 14:24.760]  and broke the country in nine parts and then 14 parts.
[14:24.760 --> 14:26.720]  There was different sectors run by the French,
[14:26.720 --> 14:28.760]  the Dutch, the British, the Americans.
[14:28.760 --> 14:31.440]  I mean, the Russians, everybody had a piece of it,
[14:31.440 --> 14:34.280]  the Japanese and it just became an abs,
[14:34.280 --> 14:35.760]  I mean, that's what happened.
[14:36.840 --> 14:39.920]  And they have a strategy to bring down a country with drugs.
[14:41.560 --> 14:43.240]  They have the troops growing the opium
[14:43.240 --> 14:45.080]  over in Afghanistan publicly.
[14:45.080 --> 14:49.680]  I mean, it's a total joke. On Friday,
[14:49.680 --> 14:52.320]  the Americans and Mexican Navy captain
[14:52.320 --> 14:54.160]  were riding on a dirt road.
[14:54.160 --> 14:56.760]  This is last Friday, about 35 miles south of Mexico City
[14:56.760 --> 14:59.720]  and armored Toyota Land Cruiser on diplomatic plates.
[14:59.720 --> 15:01.120]  And they used diplomatic plates to run,
[15:01.120 --> 15:03.040]  not just drugs, but little kids.
[15:03.040 --> 15:05.800]  Mexican federal police approached on trucks
[15:05.800 --> 15:08.200]  with mounted guns and open fire with a black SUV
[15:08.200 --> 15:10.800]  attempted to evade them and return to the main highway
[15:10.800 --> 15:15.400]  connecting Mexico City to Cuernavaca.
[15:15.400 --> 15:18.160]  Subsequently, three other vehicles carrying federal police
[15:18.160 --> 15:20.440]  joined the chase and fire on the black SUV.
[15:20.440 --> 15:24.520]  And it's now being reported that they were CIA,
[15:24.520 --> 15:28.360]  you can go read that, go read that full report.
[15:31.680 --> 15:33.280]  Now continuing, ladies and gentlemen,
[15:33.280 --> 15:34.600]  I mean, what does CIA stand for?
[15:34.600 --> 15:36.800]  Cocaine importation agency.
[15:36.800 --> 15:41.800]  And it's all glamorous in the movies and all this.
[15:42.680 --> 15:46.240]  Most of the CIA is just spying on people
[15:46.240 --> 15:49.240]  and getting intelligence to feed to the foreign banks
[15:49.240 --> 15:50.080]  that run this country.
[15:50.080 --> 15:52.240]  It's a takeover arm for the Royal Institute
[15:52.240 --> 15:56.680]  of International Affairs, OSS, Pratt House, CFR,
[15:56.680 --> 15:57.640]  our arms of that.
[15:57.640 --> 16:00.360]  And it was set up in the late 40s
[16:00.360 --> 16:03.680]  by sculling bones and British intelligence operatives
[16:03.680 --> 16:05.800]  to bring down the country.
[16:05.800 --> 16:08.200]  And it's done it, it's done an excellent job.
[16:09.120 --> 16:10.680]  They hired the modern feminists,
[16:10.680 --> 16:12.880]  that's been declassified, Gloria Steinem.
[16:12.880 --> 16:14.320]  The goal is to destroy the family,
[16:14.320 --> 16:17.000]  destroy private property, destroy everything.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.360]  Wrapped in the American flag, though.
[16:19.360 --> 16:21.280]  And you've got useful idiots in the CIA
[16:21.280 --> 16:23.720]  that go out and kill people and do all this stuff,
[16:23.720 --> 16:26.160]  thinking that they're fighting for liberty and freedom.
[16:26.160 --> 16:28.440]  Kind of like they got globalist run,
[16:28.440 --> 16:31.680]  CIA, MI6, Mossad, Ron Al Qaeda,
[16:31.680 --> 16:33.480]  who come from dirt villages, you know,
[16:33.480 --> 16:36.400]  no education and believe they're fighting for Allah.
[16:36.400 --> 16:37.720]  Don't even know they're actually working
[16:37.720 --> 16:39.920]  for the globalist to destabilize things
[16:39.920 --> 16:42.520]  and have a pretext to take over our free societies.
[16:42.520 --> 16:43.560]  That's how it works.
[16:43.560 --> 16:48.560]  Let's continue here with some more of the news on that front.
[16:52.360 --> 16:53.440]  Some good news.
[16:53.440 --> 16:58.440]  Texas students revolt against mandatory RFID tracking chips.
[16:59.080 --> 17:01.000]  They also have department of defense cameras
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.760]  that scan them while they eat lunch, behaviorally track
[17:04.760 --> 17:07.160]  everything they're doing in the bathrooms,
[17:07.160 --> 17:10.080]  in the classrooms.
[17:10.080 --> 17:13.000]  Again, just building psych warfare databases on everyone
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.400]  with the giant NSA centers,
[17:14.400 --> 17:15.600]  they're building all over the country,
[17:15.600 --> 17:16.520]  building a big one, by the way,
[17:16.520 --> 17:18.080]  it's almost done in San Antonio,
[17:18.080 --> 17:20.360]  a gigantic one that track everybody in real time
[17:20.360 --> 17:22.520]  in the world in Utah.
[17:22.520 --> 17:25.200]  I mean, it is a technological takeover.
[17:25.200 --> 17:28.480]  It's the rise of the machines under the technocrat control
[17:28.480 --> 17:31.120]  for the kill grid to be put in place.
[17:31.120 --> 17:35.800]  Texas students revolt against mandatory RFID tracking chips.
[17:37.480 --> 17:41.760]  Spy tags track kids even after they leave school.
[17:41.760 --> 17:42.840]  Now, just as it's been admitted,
[17:42.840 --> 17:44.840]  the little tracker chips to use toll roads track you
[17:44.840 --> 17:46.120]  everywhere you go as well,
[17:46.120 --> 17:48.120]  along with face scanning and license plate reading.
[17:48.120 --> 17:50.400]  Now, students and parents at two San Antonio schools
[17:50.400 --> 17:53.320]  are in revolt over a program that forces kids
[17:53.320 --> 17:55.360]  to wear RFID tracking name tags,
[17:55.360 --> 17:57.440]  which are used to pinpoint their location on campus
[17:57.440 --> 17:59.800]  as well as outside the prison premises.
[17:59.800 --> 18:01.760]  And that's what this is, is a prison.
[18:01.760 --> 18:03.040]  And it goes over their revolt.
[18:03.040 --> 18:07.400]  Here's another one out of Texas, also Louisiana.
[18:07.400 --> 18:12.000]  WTVA students require to wear IDs or face fines
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.520]  to go to the prisoner slave training system
[18:14.520 --> 18:16.200]  of Northeast Mississippi College.
[18:16.200 --> 18:18.960]  They also force inoculations on everyone outside of law,
[18:18.960 --> 18:20.080]  lying, saying there's no way
[18:20.080 --> 18:22.560]  we're to go to the public schools and the colleges
[18:22.560 --> 18:24.120]  so they can soft kill you there.
[18:24.120 --> 18:27.760]  Bill Gates is now pushing a new program
[18:27.760 --> 18:29.200]  to make everyone take vaccines.
[18:29.200 --> 18:30.320]  They're already shooting kids up
[18:30.320 --> 18:31.960]  without parental consent nationwide.
[18:31.960 --> 18:33.520]  It's a felony, but they do it.
[18:33.520 --> 18:36.160]  This is a criminal eugenics forced operation.
[18:37.280 --> 18:40.720]  But we battled back in the 30s and 40s
[18:40.720 --> 18:44.120]  when they had 35 states in the US sterilizing people
[18:44.120 --> 18:45.760]  for making B minuses.
[18:45.760 --> 18:47.280]  So we can battle back against them now,
[18:47.280 --> 18:49.520]  but they always just try to enforce it.
[18:49.520 --> 18:51.920]  That's why they've told the police be brutal, be hateful,
[18:51.920 --> 18:54.520]  body slam women, taser people, kill people.
[18:54.520 --> 18:56.960]  Be as brutal as you can, drive them into submission.
[18:56.960 --> 18:58.200]  They are the enemy.
[18:58.200 --> 19:00.160]  You protect them by maintaining order.
[19:00.160 --> 19:03.360]  No, you induct everyone into the kill grid.
[19:03.360 --> 19:05.520]  Continuing drug companies run out of weapons
[19:05.520 --> 19:08.640]  against the very same superbugs they help create.
[19:08.640 --> 19:11.080]  Nearly all antibiotics are now obsolete.
[19:11.080 --> 19:11.920]  It doesn't matter.
[19:11.920 --> 19:15.240]  I know people that take their children to go to the doctor.
[19:15.240 --> 19:16.800]  They don't even do a swab.
[19:16.800 --> 19:19.600]  I go to a local, I'm sick every couple of years
[19:19.600 --> 19:22.640]  or have an infection where I cut my leg
[19:22.640 --> 19:24.720]  on the Supreme Court building when a cop jumped out
[19:24.720 --> 19:26.840]  and I turned around and bumped into the side
[19:26.840 --> 19:28.920]  and my foot leg got infected.
[19:29.960 --> 19:32.240]  As the column cut through my jeans into my leg,
[19:32.240 --> 19:34.600]  the point is the demonic building bit me.
[19:36.880 --> 19:38.800]  I go to a place where they do swabs
[19:38.800 --> 19:42.400]  before you're given an antiviral or an antibacterial.
[19:42.400 --> 19:43.240]  They have to check it.
[19:43.240 --> 19:44.360]  You have to wait hours.
[19:44.360 --> 19:48.760]  You have to, but no, that's what a real medical facility does.
[19:48.760 --> 19:51.320]  I'm not gonna say what little clinic I go to.
[19:51.320 --> 19:54.120]  But the point is, that's where my family goes,
[19:54.120 --> 19:55.960]  all these other places, they just go,
[19:55.960 --> 19:58.160]  oh, here, you're sick taking antibiotics.
[19:58.160 --> 20:00.480]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[20:00.480 --> 20:02.600]  The worst drought in 50 years continues
[20:02.600 --> 20:04.520]  and the first six months of 2012 marks
[20:04.520 --> 20:06.040]  the hottest half year on record.
[20:06.040 --> 20:09.600]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[20:09.600 --> 20:12.440]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables,
[20:12.440 --> 20:15.000]  and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.280]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers
[20:17.280 --> 20:18.440]  and ranchers out of business.
[20:18.440 --> 20:19.920]  You're growing up your food prices.
[20:19.920 --> 20:21.680]  The only strategy to counter this
[20:21.680 --> 20:24.320]  is to freeze your food cost to today's prices
[20:24.320 --> 20:26.080]  by getting your own supply of foods
[20:26.080 --> 20:27.560]  from Eat Foods Direct now.
[20:27.560 --> 20:29.680]  As the price of raw ingredients increases,
[20:29.680 --> 20:31.440]  Eat Foods will have to raise prices too.
[20:31.440 --> 20:33.200]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[20:33.200 --> 20:35.560]  I recently increased my supply from Eat Foods Direct
[20:35.560 --> 20:37.240]  because we've all known this was coming.
[20:37.240 --> 20:38.480]  You know about their delicious,
[20:38.480 --> 20:40.200]  long-term storable foods.
[20:40.200 --> 20:42.960]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[20:42.960 --> 20:44.720]  And because it's stored for 25 years,
[20:44.720 --> 20:46.000]  you're locking in today's prices
[20:46.000 --> 20:47.520]  and avoiding the rising food cost.
[20:47.520 --> 20:50.600]  Now wait, call 800-409-5633
[20:50.600 --> 20:53.400]  or go to eatfooddirect.com.org slash alex.
[20:53.400 --> 20:55.600]  Call 800-409-5633
[20:55.600 --> 20:57.880]  or eatfooddirect.com.org slash alex.

[21:32.960 --> 21:34.120]  to protect from counterfeit
[21:34.120 --> 21:35.520]  than carting to a private bank
[21:35.520 --> 21:36.960]  having it led back at interest,
[21:36.960 --> 21:38.600]  forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[21:38.600 --> 21:40.440]  This capitalism was Jefferson correct
[21:40.440 --> 21:41.640]  when stating a central bank
[21:41.640 --> 21:43.520]  issuing the public currency as a greater menace
[21:43.520 --> 21:45.600]  to the liberties of the people than a standing army.

[22:55.520 --> 22:57.040]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger,
[22:57.040 --> 23:00.560]  author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[23:00.560 --> 23:03.440]  I want you to know some very important information.
[23:03.440 --> 23:06.400]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[23:06.400 --> 23:08.640]  that Carnivora be sent directly to me.
[23:08.640 --> 23:11.240]  Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly
[23:11.240 --> 23:13.840]  to the White House at a time when only the president
[23:13.840 --> 23:15.840]  could obtain this world-class healer.
[23:15.840 --> 23:19.160]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used
[23:19.160 --> 23:21.360]  around the world to keep people healthy.
[23:21.360 --> 23:23.760]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones
[23:23.760 --> 23:27.000]  in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.120]  compounds that instinctively respond
[23:29.120 --> 23:32.760]  to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[23:32.760 --> 23:34.920]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance
[23:34.920 --> 23:37.320]  to literally wake up your critical immune cells
[23:37.320 --> 23:40.480]  to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[23:40.480 --> 23:44.800]  Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY or order from Carnivora.com.
[23:44.800 --> 23:48.400]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.
[23:48.400 --> 23:51.760]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[23:51.760 --> 23:55.640]  1-866-VENUS-FLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[23:55.640 --> 23:56.840]  Protect your immune system.
[23:56.840 --> 23:58.400]  It's the only one you've got.
[23:58.400 --> 24:27.400]  We'll dive for the system.
[24:27.400 --> 24:31.000]  And that's really the message I've got to get out to people.
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.760]  We are living on a present planet to a great extent.
[24:34.760 --> 24:37.320]  You've got the tyrannical rail running
[24:37.320 --> 24:39.320]  that's growing stronger and bigger.
[24:39.320 --> 24:43.520]  You've got liberties, freedoms, basic hard-won rights,
[24:43.520 --> 24:46.760]  hard-fought rights that are still there to a certain extent
[24:46.760 --> 24:48.360]  but under assault.
[24:48.360 --> 24:51.760]  And so freedom is dissolving and crumbling
[24:51.760 --> 24:53.360]  as tyranny is rising.
[24:53.360 --> 24:55.360]  But it's not.
[24:55.360 --> 24:57.360]  As tyranny is rising.
[24:57.360 --> 25:00.360]  But as freedom begins to really implode,
[25:00.360 --> 25:05.360]  even the thickest-skulled people begin to wake up.
[25:05.360 --> 25:11.360]  Yesterday, I again, occasionally with my children
[25:11.360 --> 25:15.360]  in the evening, go and take them to a big public
[25:15.360 --> 25:18.360]  natural spring pool here in Austin.
[25:18.360 --> 25:22.360]  And this lifeguard goes, oh, Alex Jones.
[25:22.360 --> 25:25.360]  Yeah, I visit your website, infowars.com.
[25:25.360 --> 25:27.360]  I really run into people that disagree with me
[25:27.360 --> 25:29.360]  and actually will come over and do it.
[25:29.360 --> 25:32.360]  And I said, yeah.
[25:32.360 --> 25:37.360]  He goes, yeah, I used to, when I went to college,
[25:37.360 --> 25:41.360]  I used to use your website as an example
[25:41.360 --> 25:45.360]  in my philosophy class and in speech for logical fallacies.
[25:45.360 --> 25:51.360]  And I went, oh, you're going to use Greek philosophy on me, huh?
[25:51.360 --> 25:53.360]  Of logic and everything.
[25:53.360 --> 25:55.360]  I go, you really think you're doing that?
[25:55.360 --> 25:56.360]  I said, well, I saw it.
[25:56.360 --> 25:58.360]  I said, hey, how's that college degree going for you?
[25:58.360 --> 25:59.360]  Because I talked to him.
[25:59.360 --> 26:00.360]  He's been out of college.
[26:00.360 --> 26:02.360]  I found out he's been out of college five years.
[26:02.360 --> 26:03.360]  He's lifeguarding.
[26:03.360 --> 26:06.360]  Hey, I'm not saying that's a bad job, you know,
[26:06.360 --> 26:08.360]  $10 an hour or whatever it is.
[26:08.360 --> 26:11.360]  But the point is, is that I was telling you a decade ago
[26:11.360 --> 26:13.360]  that college was a giant bubble.
[26:13.360 --> 26:16.360]  And that most people would never be able to pay off their loans
[26:16.360 --> 26:18.360]  and they would then criminalize not paying them.
[26:18.360 --> 26:20.360]  But all this is flashing through my mind.
[26:20.360 --> 26:22.360]  Like, so I was wrong that a world government was being formed
[26:22.360 --> 26:25.360]  run by mega banks that would use derivatives to collapse
[26:25.360 --> 26:30.360]  as 14 years ago.
[26:30.360 --> 26:41.360]  And literally, the guy was up on his perch, power tripping.
[26:41.360 --> 26:42.360]  And I said, let me ask you a question.
[26:42.360 --> 26:49.360]  I said, I've never seen police at this pool in all my years.
[26:49.360 --> 26:51.360]  Now I see police here because I've just seen police
[26:51.360 --> 26:54.360]  walking around staring at people and I'd said something to them.
[26:54.360 --> 26:56.360]  I mean, they look like gang members the way they walked,
[26:56.360 --> 26:57.360]  the way they acted.
[26:57.360 --> 26:59.360]  I mean, I saw guys in plain clothes walking like that.
[26:59.360 --> 27:02.360]  I'd say, honey, you know, lock the door if I was in a parking lot.
[27:02.360 --> 27:04.360]  Lock the door.
[27:04.360 --> 27:08.360]  I mean, these guys look like gang members, young, rookie cops.
[27:08.360 --> 27:11.360]  Their posture, all of it was very upsetting.
[27:11.360 --> 27:13.360]  My dogs would have growled at them.
[27:13.360 --> 27:15.360]  That type of deal.
[27:15.360 --> 27:19.360]  And, you know, because my dogs only growled at bad men.
[27:19.360 --> 27:20.360]  I'm not saying all police are bad men.
[27:20.360 --> 27:22.360]  You can pretty much look at somebody generally.
[27:22.360 --> 27:23.360]  You've got discernment.
[27:23.360 --> 27:25.360]  And there's these young gang member types.
[27:25.360 --> 27:27.360]  They're probably in a gang five years ago.
[27:27.360 --> 27:29.360]  Cops left there about 23.
[27:29.360 --> 27:31.360]  They were, you know, shuffling around, staring at people,
[27:31.360 --> 27:33.360]  getting off on the fear.
[27:33.360 --> 27:34.360]  And the guy said, I feel good they're here.
[27:34.360 --> 27:35.360]  And I go, oh, really?
[27:35.360 --> 27:38.360]  You ever need them?
[27:38.360 --> 27:40.360]  And then some old man runs over.
[27:40.360 --> 27:42.360]  How long have you been coming to this pool?
[27:42.360 --> 27:43.360]  Because I don't even talk in loud.
[27:43.360 --> 27:45.360]  I'm like, oh, I'm not supposed to talk in America.
[27:45.360 --> 27:51.360]  And so I said, I've been coming here since I was born.
[27:51.360 --> 27:54.360]  And the guy just kind of, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[27:54.360 --> 27:55.360]  Water's very clear today.
[27:55.360 --> 27:56.360]  Why do you think it's so clear?
[27:56.360 --> 27:57.360]  I go, I don't know.
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.360]  I'm not a hydrologist.
[28:01.360 --> 28:07.360]  Probably because it hadn't been ran in a while.
[28:07.360 --> 28:09.360]  And I don't even know why I get off into these stories.
[28:09.360 --> 28:14.360]  It's just that, look, trusting the system blindly is going
[28:14.360 --> 28:16.360]  to get everybody hurt real bad.
[28:16.360 --> 28:18.360]  And I don't know how else to explain this to you.
[28:18.360 --> 28:21.360]  And they've got all these petty nobodies, as bureaucrats
[28:21.360 --> 28:25.360]  and as code enforcers and as bad cops and others out there
[28:25.360 --> 28:28.360]  that are setting up the classical tyranny that our
[28:28.360 --> 28:32.360]  forebearers in history and common sense warned us about.
[28:32.360 --> 28:36.360]  Snitches, surveillance, warrantless stuff, abuse, all of it.
[28:36.360 --> 28:39.360]  And yeah, the society's rotting as well.
[28:39.360 --> 28:41.360]  The public is degenerating.
[28:41.360 --> 28:45.360]  The public is bubbling with scum.
[28:45.360 --> 28:47.360]  I mean, I'm not just here pointing my finger at the police.
[28:47.360 --> 28:49.360]  A lot of police are really good men and women.
[28:49.360 --> 28:51.360]  And it depends on the departments.
[28:51.360 --> 28:53.360]  And Austin's one of the better ones.
[28:53.360 --> 28:54.360]  I'm not here writing that.
[28:54.360 --> 28:55.360]  You know, just going after it.
[28:55.360 --> 28:57.360]  It's just that you see people that look like gang members
[28:57.360 --> 28:59.360]  and look like scum and act like scum.
[28:59.360 --> 29:02.360]  And it's upsetting to see them in uniforms.
[29:02.360 --> 29:06.360]  To see cops creeping around.
[29:06.360 --> 29:10.360]  Like, if I saw people like that in plain clothes in my alleyway,
[29:10.360 --> 29:12.360]  I would be, you know, I would be concerned.
[29:12.360 --> 29:14.360]  I'd start watching them real carefully.
[29:14.360 --> 29:18.360]  The body language.
[29:18.360 --> 29:21.360]  Somebody's sneaking around.
[29:21.360 --> 29:23.360]  And look, look, like I said, I'd go to your calls.
[29:23.360 --> 29:25.360]  I haven't even scratched the surface of the news.
[29:25.360 --> 29:27.360]  And I'm just having flashbacks to that last night
[29:27.360 --> 29:30.360]  that we've been right about almost everything we've talked about.
[29:30.360 --> 29:32.360]  At least we weren't.
[29:32.360 --> 29:34.360]  And more people are waking up,
[29:34.360 --> 29:38.360]  but still others are running deeper into denial.
[29:38.360 --> 29:41.360]  Deeper and deeper and deeper into it.
[29:41.360 --> 29:44.360]  And time's running out, folks.
[29:44.360 --> 29:45.360]  Time's running out.
[29:45.360 --> 29:49.360]  We better turn this around and reject all this tyranny now.
[29:49.360 --> 29:51.360]  We're on the march.
[29:51.360 --> 29:53.360]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.360 --> 29:59.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.360 --> 30:03.360]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[30:03.360 --> 30:06.360]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system
[30:06.360 --> 30:08.360]  runs from bad to worse.
[30:08.360 --> 30:11.360]  The globalist model is to shut down societies
[30:11.360 --> 30:13.360]  and starve patriots out
[30:13.360 --> 30:15.360]  until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[30:15.360 --> 30:17.360]  That's why we've assembled the most vital
[30:17.360 --> 30:19.360]  and important preparedness items
[30:19.360 --> 30:21.360]  at InfowarsShop.com.
[30:21.360 --> 30:23.360]  These are items that I did research on
[30:23.360 --> 30:25.360]  that I personally use.
[30:25.360 --> 30:27.360]  We've got the LifeStraw.
[30:27.360 --> 30:30.360]  We've fed water into safe water anywhere you go.
[30:30.360 --> 30:32.360]  The K-Tour Hand Crank Generator
[30:32.360 --> 30:34.360]  to charge up key equipment during power outages
[30:34.360 --> 30:36.360]  or out in the field.

[33:36.360 --> 33:40.360]  Life's a gift in the town.

[33:43.360 --> 33:46.360]  It's time, it's our time.
[33:46.360 --> 33:48.360]  We are here live back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[33:48.360 --> 33:51.360]  Back weeknight, 7 o'clock to Info Wars.

[33:54.360 --> 33:57.360]  or prisonplanet.tv.
[33:57.360 --> 33:59.360]  Okay, look, I want to take some of your phone calls.
[33:59.360 --> 34:01.360]  Always say I'm going to take them and I start ranting
[34:01.360 --> 34:02.360]  and going off rabbit trails.
[34:02.360 --> 34:04.360]  First-time callers, boom,
[34:04.360 --> 34:07.360]  800-259-9231,
[34:07.360 --> 34:10.360]  800-259-9231.
[34:10.360 --> 34:12.360]  I didn't get the number out earlier.
[34:12.360 --> 34:13.360]  Why are the phone lines loaded?
[34:13.360 --> 34:15.360]  Whatever, we'll see what happens.
[34:15.360 --> 34:17.360]  First-time callers that all have the number memorized.
[34:17.360 --> 34:19.360]  We'll get to everybody here in just a moment.
[34:19.360 --> 34:20.360]  That means 20 minutes.
[34:20.360 --> 34:22.360]  And then I'll take calls for that little five-minute segment.
[34:22.360 --> 34:23.360]  I'm joking.
[34:23.360 --> 34:26.360]  Probably not joking if I don't get control of myself right now.
[34:26.360 --> 34:29.360]  Let me just mention some of the other stuff coming up.
[34:29.360 --> 34:33.360]  Mayor dead after a parent donkey attack.
[34:33.360 --> 34:37.360]  And, of course, that is in Hollywood Park, Texas.
[34:37.360 --> 34:40.360]  His donkey, 500 pounds, reportedly killed him.
[34:40.360 --> 34:43.360]  Yeah, a big white-tailed butt can kill you.
[34:43.360 --> 34:44.360]  They kill quite a few people.
[34:44.360 --> 34:47.360]  The answer is banned donkeys.
[34:47.360 --> 34:48.360]  Somebody got hurt by one.
[34:48.360 --> 34:50.360]  All donkeys are guilty.
[34:50.360 --> 34:53.360]  I mean, they say because some veterans, very rarely,
[34:53.360 --> 34:57.360]  go postal that all veterans should have their second amendment taken.
[34:57.360 --> 35:00.360]  Well, hey, by that logic, banned donkeys.
[35:00.360 --> 35:02.360]  Somebody stabbed somebody, banned knives.
[35:02.360 --> 35:04.360]  Somebody used a Louisville slugger.
[35:04.360 --> 35:08.360]  Hey, cops in New York shot nine people freaking out,
[35:08.360 --> 35:11.360]  trying to shoot one guy who didn't even have his gun out.
[35:11.360 --> 35:15.360]  So I say banned police, of course, not being serious,
[35:15.360 --> 35:17.360]  but I'm illustrating this.
[35:17.360 --> 35:19.360]  You know, I saw earlier in the week where a fella dressed up
[35:19.360 --> 35:23.360]  in a Bigfoot outfit and ran out in front of the cars
[35:23.360 --> 35:27.360]  to create a Bigfoot sighting.
[35:27.360 --> 35:31.360]  Well, the answer is obvious, banned all cars and banned Bigfoot outfits.
[35:31.360 --> 35:33.360]  I mean, no, no, no.
[35:33.360 --> 35:38.360]  We need TSA every 100 yards in the forest on the side of highways
[35:38.360 --> 35:41.360]  to make sure somebody doesn't run out in front of a car.
[35:41.360 --> 35:44.360]  I mean, now they got TSA on the highways running random checkpoints.
[35:44.360 --> 35:46.360]  I mean, Al-Qaeda might be coming up the road.
[35:46.360 --> 35:48.360]  I mean, we got to have them everywhere.
[35:48.360 --> 35:50.360]  I mean, come on.
[35:50.360 --> 35:53.360]  A South Texas mayor has been found dead
[35:53.360 --> 35:56.360]  after apparently being attacked by a 500-pound donkey.
[35:56.360 --> 36:00.360]  Yeah, 100-pound donkeys mirrored in a box of rattlesnakes.
[36:00.360 --> 36:02.360]  That is, they don't like you.
[36:02.360 --> 36:03.360]  They're sweet as pie.
[36:03.360 --> 36:05.360]  They know you.
[36:05.360 --> 36:06.360]  I love donkeys.
[36:06.360 --> 36:09.360]  Continuing, the county sheriff's office said Wednesday
[36:09.360 --> 36:12.360]  that the death of the Hollywood Park mayor,
[36:12.360 --> 36:17.360]  William Bill Bockel, appears to be an accident
[36:17.360 --> 36:19.360]  and appears that the donkey killed him.
[36:19.360 --> 36:21.360]  He loved his animals, but the donkey killed him.
[36:21.360 --> 36:22.360]  Well, there you go.
[36:22.360 --> 36:24.360]  All donkeys are guilty.
[36:24.360 --> 36:26.360]  All donkeys are evil.
[36:26.360 --> 36:27.360]  All donkeys are bad.
[36:27.360 --> 36:31.360]  We have to get rid of them or have TSA at your farm
[36:31.360 --> 36:33.360]  because, I mean, a cow might kill you.
[36:33.360 --> 36:36.360]  Gals kill people. Bulls kill people.
[36:36.360 --> 36:38.360]  Donkeys.
[36:38.360 --> 36:40.360]  Farm equipment.
[36:40.360 --> 36:42.360]  In fact, ban humans driving cars
[36:42.360 --> 36:44.360]  because computers can drive them better.
[36:44.360 --> 36:45.360]  Oh, guess what?
[36:45.360 --> 36:47.360]  They said last week they're looking at that.
[36:47.360 --> 36:48.360]  Oh, yeah.
[36:48.360 --> 36:49.360]  Let me tell you.
[36:49.360 --> 36:51.360]  These Google cars are your enemy,
[36:51.360 --> 36:54.360]  not because technology isn't neutral,
[36:54.360 --> 36:58.360]  but because it's all being designed to replace you,
[36:58.360 --> 36:59.360]  to control you.
[36:59.360 --> 37:02.360]  It's an incremental new type of military takeover.
[37:02.360 --> 37:03.360]  It's systematic.
[37:03.360 --> 37:10.360]  We're being interwoven with surveillance tech grids of control.
[37:10.360 --> 37:11.360]  So that's just some of it.
[37:11.360 --> 37:13.360]  But, I mean, there's Texas school kids are revolting
[37:13.360 --> 37:15.360]  about having to wear RFID tags
[37:15.360 --> 37:19.360]  and being watched at home by the AI computers
[37:19.360 --> 37:21.360]  over their laptops.
[37:21.360 --> 37:23.360]  And, you know, how dare them.
[37:23.360 --> 37:24.360]  They're extremists.
[37:24.360 --> 37:28.360]  The government's just trying to keep them safe,
[37:28.360 --> 37:30.360]  just like all the people they've killed
[37:30.360 --> 37:33.360]  in chemical, biological, and radiological tests,
[37:33.360 --> 37:37.360]  shooting little children up with vaccines
[37:37.360 --> 37:40.360]  filled with measles, mumps, and rubella pathogens
[37:40.360 --> 37:42.360]  so they can sell more vaccine.
[37:42.360 --> 37:45.360]  I mean, these are good people,
[37:45.360 --> 37:47.360]  and we shouldn't be talking bad about them.
[37:47.360 --> 37:49.360]  You know, I said I would do this now,
[37:49.360 --> 37:51.360]  and then we're going to go to your phone calls.
[37:51.360 --> 37:53.360]  Drumroll, please.
[37:53.360 --> 37:55.360]  If you're watching on PrismPlanet.tv,
[37:55.360 --> 37:58.360]  this has more of an effect,
[37:58.360 --> 38:00.360]  but I have some of the color images here.
[38:00.360 --> 38:04.360]  Wide shot, wide shot, please.
[38:04.360 --> 38:07.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, right here,
[38:07.360 --> 38:10.360]  Hitler clothing store stirs anger in India.
[38:10.360 --> 38:13.360]  The owner of the new men's clothing store, Hitler,
[38:13.360 --> 38:17.360]  is in Obamabod, India, is willing to change its name
[38:17.360 --> 38:20.360]  if he would be compensated over the branding expenses.
[38:20.360 --> 38:23.360]  Members of the city's tiny Jewish community
[38:23.360 --> 38:25.360]  condemned the store's name,
[38:25.360 --> 38:28.360]  and the Israeli diplomats said the embassy
[38:28.360 --> 38:31.360]  would raise the matter in the strongest possible way.
[38:31.360 --> 38:33.360]  This gentleman goes on to say,
[38:33.360 --> 38:36.360]  he didn't know who Hitler was.
[38:36.360 --> 38:39.360]  This is a quote here out of the Huffington Post.
[38:39.360 --> 38:41.360]  The proprietor, Rashid Shah,
[38:41.360 --> 38:44.360]  told the Times of India that he had no idea
[38:44.360 --> 38:46.360]  the moniker would be controversial.
[38:46.360 --> 38:48.360]  This guy's got to become an American politician.
[38:48.360 --> 38:50.360]  I mean, what a pure bull.
[38:50.360 --> 38:52.360]  I didn't know anything about Fast and Furious.
[38:52.360 --> 38:55.360]  Hitler was a nickname given to my business partner,
[38:55.360 --> 38:58.360]  Manish Chandi's grandfather,
[38:58.360 --> 39:00.360]  because he was strict nature.
[39:00.360 --> 39:02.360]  Now, folks, if you believe that,
[39:02.360 --> 39:04.360]  please show the viewers over here.
[39:04.360 --> 39:06.360]  Yeah, back that out.
[39:06.360 --> 39:09.360]  His business card says,
[39:09.360 --> 39:14.360]  Hitler and the dot on the eye is a swastika,
[39:14.360 --> 39:16.360]  rotating in the Nazi direction,
[39:16.360 --> 39:20.360]  and it's also red over here on the store.
[39:20.360 --> 39:24.360]  He doesn't know who Hitler is.
[39:24.360 --> 39:28.360]  He's just got a store with a swastika on top of it.
[39:28.360 --> 39:30.360]  Listen, here's the deal.
[39:30.360 --> 39:32.360]  I'm all for this guy's First Amendment,
[39:32.360 --> 39:34.360]  but let me tell you something.
[39:34.360 --> 39:37.360]  When I see shops called Maus in Denver and London,
[39:37.360 --> 39:39.360]  and they've got one with Mao Zedong here in Austin,
[39:39.360 --> 39:41.360]  I'm going to do a report on that.
[39:41.360 --> 39:43.360]  They've got two different bars with hammers and sickles.
[39:43.360 --> 39:45.360]  You know something?
[39:45.360 --> 39:47.360]  I'm going to go out front those bars with swastika
[39:47.360 --> 39:49.360]  and a hammer and sickle.
[39:49.360 --> 39:51.360]  A sickle killed about 60 million people.
[39:51.360 --> 39:54.360]  Under Mao, it killed 60 plus millions.
[39:54.360 --> 39:56.360]  It's over 120 million conservatively,
[39:56.360 --> 39:59.360]  counting the Soviets and everything, and then them.
[39:59.360 --> 40:01.360]  I'm offended by that.
[40:01.360 --> 40:03.360]  Why is no one offended?
[40:03.360 --> 40:05.360]  I'm offended by the swastika, too.
[40:05.360 --> 40:08.360]  Plus, I'd be scared to have a business with that on it.
[40:08.360 --> 40:10.360]  It's kind of a bad idea.
[40:10.360 --> 40:15.360]  But this guy certainly gets the Bologna Pusher Award.
[40:15.360 --> 40:17.360]  We call it something else down here in Texas,
[40:17.360 --> 40:20.360]  but let me tell you, that isn't even BS.
[40:20.360 --> 40:24.360]  That is horse manure if I have ever seen it or heard it.
[40:24.360 --> 40:25.360]  But hey, you know what?
[40:25.360 --> 40:27.360]  It'll probably work on zombies.
[40:27.360 --> 40:29.360]  Hey, don't be a conspiracy theorist.
[40:29.360 --> 40:30.360]  Use logic.
[40:30.360 --> 40:33.360]  He says he didn't know who Hitler is.
[40:33.360 --> 40:35.360]  Don't use your common sense.
[40:35.360 --> 40:37.360]  That's supposedly logic now.
[40:37.360 --> 40:39.360]  All these educated idiots that can't tie their shoelaces
[40:39.360 --> 40:43.360]  or get a job is those of us that have smarts,
[40:43.360 --> 40:46.360]  have street smarts, business smarts, life smarts.
[40:46.360 --> 40:49.360]  All these idiots, too, that serve the system.
[40:49.360 --> 40:51.360]  Most of them can't get a date,
[40:51.360 --> 40:53.360]  so their friend is the television set.
[40:53.360 --> 40:55.360]  Because you don't live in the real world.
[40:55.360 --> 40:57.360]  Let me tell you, men out there that serve the system.
[40:57.360 --> 40:59.360]  You know what women are looking for?
[40:59.360 --> 41:00.360]  They're looking for leaders.
[41:00.360 --> 41:02.360]  They're looking for guys that know what's going on.
[41:02.360 --> 41:04.360]  They're looking for forceful, informative people
[41:04.360 --> 41:06.360]  that have got something on the ball,
[41:06.360 --> 41:08.360]  and women's intuition knows right away.
[41:08.360 --> 41:09.360]  Same thing for women.
[41:09.360 --> 41:12.360]  You're looking for guys, stop acting so insecure.
[41:12.360 --> 41:14.360]  And again, I'm just digressing often
[41:14.360 --> 41:16.360]  these cowardly jelly fishes.
[41:16.360 --> 41:18.360]  And I've had enough of it.
[41:18.360 --> 41:21.360]  By the way, we have another article going up
[41:21.360 --> 41:23.360]  on infowars.com in minutes.
[41:23.360 --> 41:26.360]  And I'll tell you about that before we go to our guests
[41:26.360 --> 41:27.360]  at the start of the next hour.
[41:27.360 --> 41:30.360]  Amazing billboards are getting put up all over the country
[41:30.360 --> 41:31.360]  by our listeners.
[41:31.360 --> 41:33.360]  And it's really having a big effect to fight the globalist.
[41:33.360 --> 41:35.360]  And I have just seen one from Florida
[41:35.360 --> 41:38.360]  that absolutely is how it's done.
[41:38.360 --> 41:39.360]  But enough for me.
[41:39.360 --> 41:42.360]  That's not even the tip of the iceberg, folks,
[41:42.360 --> 41:43.360]  of the news here.
[41:43.360 --> 41:45.360]  I've got so much we're going to be covering.
[41:45.360 --> 41:47.360]  Ron Paul being harassed.
[41:47.360 --> 41:49.360]  They tried to imply he was going to blow up Romney.
[41:49.360 --> 41:51.360]  I mean, this is amazing.
[41:51.360 --> 41:53.360]  Kurt's article isn't even hardcore enough.
[41:53.360 --> 41:55.360]  I mean, it's a great article he wrote.
[41:55.360 --> 41:57.360]  Again, it was up at drudgerport.com last night.
[41:57.360 --> 41:58.360]  This morning it's gone now.
[41:58.360 --> 42:00.360]  I'm going to get it reposted in the tiles
[42:00.360 --> 42:01.360]  so everybody can see it.
[42:01.360 --> 42:02.360]  We're going to get to that.
[42:02.360 --> 42:05.360]  But first, Chad in New York.
[42:05.360 --> 42:07.360]  Thank you for holding.
[42:07.360 --> 42:08.360]  Good to have you here on air.
[42:08.360 --> 42:10.360]  Hey, do you believe this guy in India?
[42:10.360 --> 42:12.360]  He has a store called Hitler.
[42:12.360 --> 42:14.360]  It's got a red swastika on it.
[42:14.360 --> 42:16.360]  He said he never heard of Hitler
[42:16.360 --> 42:18.360]  and the store has nothing to do with Hitler.
[42:18.360 --> 42:20.360]  Are you a conspiracy theorist?
[42:20.360 --> 42:22.360]  Do you not believe him?
[42:22.360 --> 42:24.360]  I guess you could call me conspiracy theorist
[42:24.360 --> 42:28.360]  because, you know, I don't believe that TSA
[42:28.360 --> 42:30.360]  has ever caught anybody in al-Qaeda.
[42:30.360 --> 42:32.360]  But, you know, that's just me.
[42:32.360 --> 42:34.360]  Well, they want to catch al-Qaeda.
[42:34.360 --> 42:36.360]  They need to go over to NATO headquarters
[42:36.360 --> 42:38.360]  where they're arming them and training them
[42:38.360 --> 42:40.360]  and go to Turkey where U.S. Marines are training them
[42:40.360 --> 42:43.360]  and helicoptering them into the border region.
[42:43.360 --> 42:44.360]  Hey, I mean, who knows?
[42:44.360 --> 42:46.360]  They might be in my pants, Alec.
[42:46.360 --> 42:47.360]  You never know.
[42:47.360 --> 42:48.360]  Are you sure?
[42:48.360 --> 42:49.360]  You know what?
[42:49.360 --> 42:50.360]  Are you sure?
[42:50.360 --> 42:52.360]  Like, if people out there that use preparation age,
[42:52.360 --> 42:53.360]  that may not be an umbrella.
[42:53.360 --> 42:54.360]  That may be al-Qaeda.
[42:54.360 --> 42:56.360]  Hey, you never know, man.
[42:56.360 --> 42:57.360]  Maybe that's bin Laden.
[42:57.360 --> 42:59.360]  I mean, they said they'd throw him in the ocean.
[42:59.360 --> 43:01.360]  How will they throw him in your...
[43:01.360 --> 43:03.360]  Don't fly.
[43:03.360 --> 43:04.360]  This morning in the bathroom,
[43:04.360 --> 43:06.360]  it kind of looked like bin Laden.
[43:06.360 --> 43:07.360]  All right.
[43:07.360 --> 43:09.360]  All right, I'm going to stop the comedy.
[43:09.360 --> 43:12.360]  You know, that's why...
[43:12.360 --> 43:13.360]  Well, maybe I'm not that funny,
[43:13.360 --> 43:16.360]  but as Kevin Booth who was Bill Hicks' producer
[43:16.360 --> 43:18.360]  says I was funnier than Bill Hicks,
[43:18.360 --> 43:19.360]  by the way, I don't agree with him,
[43:19.360 --> 43:20.360]  but that's why Kevin says that
[43:20.360 --> 43:21.360]  he knows what I'm like behind the scenes.
[43:21.360 --> 43:23.360]  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[43:23.360 --> 43:27.360]  No, I just wanted to thank you for one thing, Mr. Alex Jones.
[43:27.360 --> 43:29.360]  Thank you for waking me up.
[43:29.360 --> 43:31.360]  You and Mr. Ventura are two years ago.
[43:31.360 --> 43:32.360]  I really appreciate it.
[43:32.360 --> 43:35.360]  Your conspiracy theory show really woke me up,
[43:35.360 --> 43:37.360]  especially the one about the FEMA camps.
[43:37.360 --> 43:40.360]  That really woke me up, and I tell you,
[43:40.360 --> 43:41.360]  it was powerful stuff.
[43:41.360 --> 43:43.360]  I wish they'd let the third season come out,
[43:43.360 --> 43:45.360]  but, you know, unfortunately...
[43:45.360 --> 43:46.360]  Well, here's the deal.
[43:46.360 --> 43:48.360]  I'm not allowed to tell you what went on,
[43:48.360 --> 43:51.360]  but it's like something out of a men in black movie.
[43:51.360 --> 43:52.360]  I mean, there were men in black.
[43:52.360 --> 43:54.360]  The whole deal happened,
[43:54.360 --> 43:58.360]  and True TV was going to back Ventura,
[43:58.360 --> 43:59.360]  but they just got threatened.
[43:59.360 --> 44:01.360]  I mean, the head of True TV
[44:01.360 --> 44:03.360]  did have a lot of courage to put that on air,
[44:03.360 --> 44:04.360]  but it got top ratings.
[44:04.360 --> 44:05.360]  It was too successful.
[44:05.360 --> 44:07.360]  So the third season that I went out and consulted on
[44:07.360 --> 44:09.360]  and helped and worked on and shot
[44:09.360 --> 44:12.360]  and got groped by TSA to be able to do,
[44:12.360 --> 44:15.360]  I don't think it's going to air.
[44:15.360 --> 44:16.360]  I don't think it is either, sir,
[44:16.360 --> 44:18.360]  but the question I had,
[44:18.360 --> 44:21.360]  there's a question on a comment I wanted to make.
[44:21.360 --> 44:23.360]  The question I had is,
[44:23.360 --> 44:26.360]  do you think that the Brandon and Rob case
[44:26.360 --> 44:28.360]  with all the other cases that have been going on
[44:28.360 --> 44:31.360]  that you were talking about last week and this week,
[44:31.360 --> 44:33.360]  do you think that that's the beta test rollout
[44:33.360 --> 44:35.360]  for the reeducation camp?
[44:35.360 --> 44:37.360]  Absolutely, no, no.
[44:37.360 --> 44:40.360]  Listen, I believe he believes what he's saying,
[44:40.360 --> 44:43.360]  and he's a very intelligent, well-spoken person,
[44:43.360 --> 44:46.360]  but Steve sees all this massing,
[44:46.360 --> 44:48.360]  and so he's like, it's happening, it's happening.
[44:48.360 --> 44:50.360]  They don't want to move this thing fast.
[44:50.360 --> 44:52.360]  They want to just keep moving it slow.
[44:52.360 --> 44:55.360]  They're already shooting kids up, again,
[44:55.360 --> 44:57.360]  from Alabama to California.
[44:57.360 --> 44:59.360]  Three or four years ago, we get reports
[44:59.360 --> 45:01.360]  they were shooting kids up without parental consent
[45:01.360 --> 45:04.360]  when they would have convulsions in Alabama and California,
[45:04.360 --> 45:07.360]  in Michigan, in Massachusetts.
[45:07.360 --> 45:10.360]  Now, those states are just shooting the kids up
[45:10.360 --> 45:13.360]  without asking the parents, folks, that's so illegal,
[45:13.360 --> 45:16.360]  but they just do it, and the cops won't enforce the law.
[45:16.360 --> 45:18.360]  They won't enforce the law in Fast and Furious,
[45:18.360 --> 45:20.360]  and yeah, they're grabbing veterans everywhere
[45:20.360 --> 45:22.360]  for cleaning guns on their back porch
[45:22.360 --> 45:24.360]  or putting their deer rifle in their car.
[45:24.360 --> 45:26.360]  Every deer season, I see articles everywhere,
[45:26.360 --> 45:30.360]  even in Texas, where I've seen stories
[45:30.360 --> 45:33.360]  where the police get called on a cop
[45:33.360 --> 45:35.360]  who's off duty going deer hunting.
[45:35.360 --> 45:37.360]  I mean, you cannot dress up in camo
[45:37.360 --> 45:41.360]  and have a gun in this country without people freaking out.
[45:41.360 --> 45:45.360]  Look, when I was a kid, everybody had guns in their truck windows,
[45:45.360 --> 45:47.360]  and I think we should start doing that again.
[45:47.360 --> 45:50.360]  In fact, I'm going to put a gun rack in my car,
[45:50.360 --> 45:53.360]  in my truck, and I'm going to start driving around with a gun.
[45:53.360 --> 45:55.360]  I'm going to drive around with a semi-auto 50 cal,
[45:55.360 --> 45:56.360]  see how folks like it.
[45:56.360 --> 45:58.360]  Of course, the only problem is people will break in your car
[45:58.360 --> 46:02.360]  and steal them, but I might just do it with cameras in my car,
[46:02.360 --> 46:04.360]  just waiting for the police to pull me over,
[46:04.360 --> 46:07.360]  because they hate us exercising our rights,
[46:07.360 --> 46:10.360]  not the average cop, but those that control them do.
[46:10.360 --> 46:11.360]  Go ahead.
[46:11.360 --> 46:14.360]  Oh, yeah, and I just wanted to make one quick comment.
[46:14.360 --> 46:16.360]  It isn't just happening with him.
[46:16.360 --> 46:19.360]  It's happening with me because I've had a lot.
[46:19.360 --> 46:22.360]  I've linked to your articles on PrisonPlanet.com
[46:22.360 --> 46:26.360]  and Infowars.com, and I repost them on my Facebook,
[46:26.360 --> 46:28.360]  and I make comments about it,
[46:28.360 --> 46:32.360]  and I've had at least five or six Facebook postings
[46:32.360 --> 46:36.360]  where they haven't gone through, and it's just...
[46:36.360 --> 46:38.360]  Oh, no, we're getting censorship everywhere now.
[46:38.360 --> 46:40.360]  They're trying to kick us off YouTube right now
[46:40.360 --> 46:42.360]  and battling them behind the scenes.
[46:42.360 --> 46:44.360]  I mean, look, they don't want this message getting out
[46:44.360 --> 46:46.360]  because it's the truth, and I appreciate your call.
[46:46.360 --> 46:47.360]  Great points.
[46:47.360 --> 46:49.360]  I mean, we're in trouble, Chad,
[46:49.360 --> 46:55.360]  and they are setting up the paradigm to disappear people.
[46:55.360 --> 46:57.360]  No judge, no jury.
[46:57.360 --> 46:58.360]  Brandon Robb has come out now.
[46:58.360 --> 47:01.360]  We talked to him yesterday, talked to his family,
[47:01.360 --> 47:03.360]  and he's intimidated to come on the show.
[47:03.360 --> 47:05.360]  I mean, I understand that a lot of people don't want to go on air.
[47:05.360 --> 47:07.360]  That's why he did a tape with the lawyer,
[47:07.360 --> 47:08.360]  but he may come on sometime.
[47:08.360 --> 47:10.360]  But it's happening to a bunch of people.
[47:10.360 --> 47:12.360]  Talk show host, you name it,
[47:12.360 --> 47:16.360]  and we now know why they grabbed him.
[47:16.360 --> 47:19.360]  It was the Illuminati card game.
[47:19.360 --> 47:21.360]  They were looking at cards where it shows
[47:21.360 --> 47:23.360]  the towers getting hit, the Pentagon getting hit,
[47:23.360 --> 47:25.360]  and we're trying to imply he was going to do something
[47:25.360 --> 47:28.360]  because they were talking about the government doing it.
[47:28.360 --> 47:30.360]  So that's what they're afraid of.
[47:30.360 --> 47:33.360]  They're afraid of the fact that we know about false flag terror
[47:33.360 --> 47:36.360]  like Fast and Furious, 9-11, Oklahoma City.
[47:36.360 --> 47:38.360]  They hate that because they want to blow stuff up
[47:38.360 --> 47:41.360]  and poses our saviors and take over with the security state,
[47:41.360 --> 47:45.360]  with the nanny state, which history shows is the biggest threat.
[47:45.360 --> 47:48.360]  Charity will come to your door in a uniform.
[47:48.360 --> 47:51.360]  That's why we obsess over the military and the police
[47:51.360 --> 47:54.360]  because this country, to a great extent,
[47:54.360 --> 47:58.360]  will rise or fall on you being informed
[47:58.360 --> 48:00.360]  and on the citizens informing you
[48:00.360 --> 48:03.360]  because the globalists want a civil war.
[48:03.360 --> 48:05.360]  They want us to kill each other.
[48:05.360 --> 48:11.360]  And I do not have any delusions of grandeur
[48:11.360 --> 48:13.360]  about some armed conflict with criminal elements
[48:13.360 --> 48:15.360]  of the government and their mind control bots.
[48:15.360 --> 48:17.360]  They're following a false paradigm script
[48:17.360 --> 48:19.360]  who are basically androids.
[48:19.360 --> 48:22.360]  I mean, the average brainwash cop or military that will do this,
[48:22.360 --> 48:23.360]  most of them won't.
[48:23.360 --> 48:25.360]  I've talked to them at Nausium,
[48:25.360 --> 48:28.360]  really believes they're fighting bad guys.
[48:28.360 --> 48:32.360]  And the war is for their mind.
[48:32.360 --> 48:33.360]  That's where the war is.
[48:33.360 --> 48:35.360]  The war, it doesn't matter.
[48:35.360 --> 48:37.360]  The society is so evil.
[48:37.360 --> 48:40.360]  It's hard to turn this around.
[48:40.360 --> 48:45.360]  We have gone from a nation of men to a nation of so-called men,
[48:45.360 --> 48:48.360]  hype-driven blobs.
[48:48.360 --> 48:50.360]  Myself included.
[48:50.360 --> 48:51.360]  I mean, we're lazy.
[48:51.360 --> 48:54.360]  Look, look, liberty gave us plenty.
[48:54.360 --> 48:56.360]  And then we became decadent.
[48:56.360 --> 48:57.360]  And now evil came in.
[48:57.360 --> 48:58.360]  I mean, it's a cycle.
[48:58.360 --> 49:00.360]  And if we could just learn from history,
[49:00.360 --> 49:02.360]  we don't have to go through this.
[49:02.360 --> 49:03.360]  Steve in Oregon, you're on the air.
[49:03.360 --> 49:05.360]  Go ahead.
[49:05.360 --> 49:06.360]  Yeah, hey, Alice.
[49:06.360 --> 49:08.360]  Nice talking to you.
[49:08.360 --> 49:09.360]  Nice talking to you.
[49:09.360 --> 49:11.360]  I've been a long-time listener, first-time caller.
[49:11.360 --> 49:14.360]  Hey, I just wanted to make everybody aware
[49:14.360 --> 49:16.360]  that they, on September the 6th,
[49:16.360 --> 49:18.360]  our esteemed city council,
[49:18.360 --> 49:20.360]  esteemed fit in spite of the fact
[49:20.360 --> 49:22.360]  that it's been already voted down
[49:22.360 --> 49:25.360]  by the populace in Oregon,
[49:25.360 --> 49:29.360]  they've seen fit to propose a referendum.
[49:29.360 --> 49:31.360]  Florida, you got it.
[49:31.360 --> 49:32.360]  You got it.
[49:32.360 --> 49:33.360]  Yeah, you're already aware of it then.
[49:33.360 --> 49:34.360]  No, no.
[49:34.360 --> 49:35.360]  Tell us about it.
[49:35.360 --> 49:36.360]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[49:36.360 --> 49:37.360]  The states voted it down.
[49:37.360 --> 49:38.360]  The cities voted it down.
[49:38.360 --> 49:39.360]  But they love you so much.
[49:39.360 --> 49:41.360]  They want to put something special in there.
[49:41.360 --> 49:44.360]  They want to help you learn to not be so upset.
[49:44.360 --> 49:45.360]  Everything will be okay very soon.
[49:45.360 --> 49:46.360]  Okay, very soon, Steve.
[49:46.360 --> 49:47.360]  Just drink it.
[49:47.360 --> 49:48.360]  Drink it.
[49:48.360 --> 49:49.360]  They love you.
[49:49.360 --> 49:50.360]  Really, they do.
[49:50.360 --> 49:51.360]  They love you.
[49:51.360 --> 49:53.360]  Yeah, the two scumbags that are responsible
[49:53.360 --> 49:55.360]  for this loving gesture
[49:55.360 --> 49:58.360]  is our county commissioners, Randy Leonard
[49:58.360 --> 50:02.360]  and Nick Fish.
[50:02.360 --> 50:04.360]  And they're going to have a hearing on it
[50:04.360 --> 50:06.360]  at our courthouse,
[50:06.360 --> 50:07.360]  not the courthouse,
[50:07.360 --> 50:09.360]  but the city hall of the council chambers
[50:09.360 --> 50:11.360]  on September the 6th,
[50:11.360 --> 50:14.360]  and they're going to bring it to a council vote
[50:14.360 --> 50:17.360]  without any input from us, the populace,
[50:17.360 --> 50:21.360]  who it'll be directly affecting.
[50:21.360 --> 50:23.360]  They, without having any input from us,
[50:23.360 --> 50:25.360]  are just going to mandate it in, I think.
[50:25.360 --> 50:27.360]  You know, and I do not want to be poisoned.
[50:27.360 --> 50:30.360]  I never, I'm one of those...
[50:30.360 --> 50:31.360]  Well, let me tell you something.
[50:31.360 --> 50:33.360]  I get, I mean, I have real feelings of anger
[50:33.360 --> 50:35.360]  towards these government officials,
[50:35.360 --> 50:37.360]  authorities towards us,
[50:37.360 --> 50:38.360]  the little scum civilians,
[50:38.360 --> 50:41.360]  you know, that term they use in their takeover,
[50:41.360 --> 50:43.360]  that they laugh at us when we have
[50:43.360 --> 50:45.360]  New York Times, Associated Press,
[50:45.360 --> 50:48.360]  Harvard studies of cancer, brain damage.
[50:48.360 --> 50:49.360]  I mean, look at them,
[50:49.360 --> 50:51.360]  look what it's doing to us, and they laugh.
[50:51.360 --> 50:53.360]  I'm telling you, sue them personally
[50:53.360 --> 50:55.360]  for falsely medicating you
[50:55.360 --> 50:57.360]  without your consent.
[50:57.360 --> 50:58.360]  That'll get their attention.
[50:58.360 --> 51:01.360]  Sue them!
[51:01.360 --> 51:04.360]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts.
[51:04.360 --> 51:05.360]  Get off the grid
[51:05.360 --> 51:07.360]  and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[51:07.360 --> 51:09.360]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country,
[51:09.360 --> 51:11.360]  I don't have to tell you about the power grid
[51:11.360 --> 51:13.360]  and just how vulnerable it is.
[51:13.360 --> 51:15.360]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[51:15.360 --> 51:17.360]  Millions of people have lost their power
[51:17.360 --> 51:18.360]  in the last few weeks
[51:18.360 --> 51:20.360]  because of dangerous storms and killer heat
[51:20.360 --> 51:23.360]  that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[51:23.360 --> 51:25.360]  I've always said that every family
[51:25.360 --> 51:27.360]  needs to be ready for blackouts,
[51:27.360 --> 51:29.360]  and if you don't have a backup system in place,

[51:43.360 --> 51:45.360]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas
[51:45.360 --> 51:47.360]  because they're solar-powered.

[54:12.360 --> 54:14.360]  Look, we're being incrementally enslaved.
[54:14.360 --> 54:16.360]  That's why I don't expect
[54:16.360 --> 54:18.360]  any big giant takeover
[54:18.360 --> 54:20.360]  to happen overnight.
[54:20.360 --> 54:22.360]  It's going to be incrementally federalizing things,
[54:22.360 --> 54:24.360]  globalizing things,
[54:24.360 --> 54:26.360]  getting rid of our sovereignty,
[54:26.360 --> 54:28.360]  telling our military they're under NATO
[54:28.360 --> 54:30.360]  and UN control.
[54:30.360 --> 54:32.360]  This is how the global government's taking over
[54:32.360 --> 54:34.360]  until they launch giant stage terror attacks
[54:34.360 --> 54:36.360]  or allow groups to attack.
[54:36.360 --> 54:38.360]  And then say,
[54:38.360 --> 54:40.360]  oh, we're not fighting Al Qaeda.
[54:40.360 --> 54:42.360]  It's for conservatives, libertarians, Christians.
[54:42.360 --> 54:44.360]  They're the terrorist.
[54:44.360 --> 54:46.360]  And that's why we're seeing all this hype now
[54:46.360 --> 54:48.360]  about a stage terror attack.
[54:48.360 --> 54:50.360]  We're going to go to your calls here in a moment
[54:50.360 --> 54:52.360]  in the next segment, then Larry Grafwald
[54:52.360 --> 54:54.360]  will be joining us to break this down and more.
[54:54.360 --> 54:56.360]  All over the country, this is a phenomenon
[54:56.360 --> 54:58.360]  that is taking place
[54:58.360 --> 55:00.360]  and it's very, very exciting.
[55:00.360 --> 55:02.360]  And if you go to infowars.com
[55:02.360 --> 55:04.360]  you can see some of the billboards.
[55:04.360 --> 55:06.360]  It's the top story
[55:06.360 --> 55:08.360]  there on the site
[55:08.360 --> 55:10.360]  and you need to hit refresh
[55:10.360 --> 55:12.360]  if your site hasn't
[55:12.360 --> 55:14.360]  hasn't loaded it yet
[55:14.360 --> 55:16.360]  because Kurt posted
[55:16.360 --> 55:18.360]  about 10 minutes ago
[55:18.360 --> 55:20.360]  one trick
[55:20.360 --> 55:22.360]  to find it in features
[55:22.360 --> 55:24.360]  is to put a question mark
[55:24.360 --> 55:26.360]  in front of the infowars.com
[55:26.360 --> 55:28.360]  and it will go up
[55:28.360 --> 55:30.360]  but it doesn't look like it's going up yet
[55:30.360 --> 55:32.360]  on my site either.
[55:32.360 --> 55:34.360]  So I'll just show people photos here on air
[55:34.360 --> 55:36.360]  if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv
[55:36.360 --> 55:38.360]  it says, is Obama
[55:38.360 --> 55:40.360]  our dictator?
[55:40.360 --> 55:42.360]  Patriot Act, NDAA
[55:42.360 --> 55:44.360]  Second Amendment
[55:44.360 --> 55:46.360]  stop the New World Order, hear the truth
[55:46.360 --> 55:48.360]  Alex Jones, infowars.com
[55:48.360 --> 55:50.360]  and this is a great example
[55:50.360 --> 55:52.360]  of the type of billboard
[55:52.360 --> 55:54.360]  there's a lot of people
[55:54.360 --> 55:56.360]  you can put up billboards on big highways
[55:56.360 --> 55:58.360]  for a couple thousand dollars
[55:58.360 --> 56:00.360]  in some cases even cheaper if they're simple like this
[56:00.360 --> 56:02.360]  and this is the way to do it.
[56:02.360 --> 56:04.360]  Paid for by MKUltra
[56:04.360 --> 56:06.360]  Victim
[56:06.360 --> 56:08.360]  Ken Rhodes and Gary Gaines
[56:08.360 --> 56:10.360]  and people are just
[56:10.360 --> 56:12.360]  fighting back everywhere so
[56:12.360 --> 56:14.360]  good job, that's how you get the word out
[56:14.360 --> 56:16.360]  and that's at highway 441
[56:16.360 --> 56:18.360]  in Ocala, Florida
[56:18.360 --> 56:20.360]  put up by Ken Rhodes
[56:20.360 --> 56:22.360]  so good job to the folks
[56:22.360 --> 56:24.360]  that did that and I see these
[56:24.360 --> 56:26.360]  every week coming across my desk
[56:26.360 --> 56:28.360]  people are stepping up
[56:28.360 --> 56:30.360]  and getting people out of the trance they're in
[56:30.360 --> 56:32.360]  you've got to get out of your learned helplessness
[56:32.360 --> 56:34.360]  out of your comfort zone
[56:34.360 --> 56:36.360]  out of this mass Stockholm syndrome
[56:36.360 --> 56:38.360]  out of this normalcy bias
[56:38.360 --> 56:40.360]  what's happening is classical tyranny
[56:40.360 --> 56:42.360]  and it's a lot bigger than just Obama
[56:42.360 --> 56:44.360]  the type of
[56:44.360 --> 56:46.360]  authoritarian scum
[56:46.360 --> 56:48.360]  that is in government everywhere now
[56:48.360 --> 56:50.360]  thinks that we belong to them
[56:50.360 --> 56:52.360]  and there's some good people in government
[56:52.360 --> 56:54.360]  but less and less
[56:54.360 --> 56:56.360]  especially up high
[56:56.360 --> 56:58.360]  and a lot of the big corporate interests
[56:58.360 --> 57:00.360]  their monopoly interests
[57:00.360 --> 57:02.360]  they want to work with the foritarians
[57:02.360 --> 57:04.360]  mainly communists and socialists
[57:04.360 --> 57:06.360]  we go to Georgetown we sell the book
[57:06.360 --> 57:08.360]  at info warshop.com it's 1400 pages long
[57:08.360 --> 57:10.360]  finally back in print
[57:10.360 --> 57:12.360]  Bill Clinton's Mendoor
[57:12.360 --> 57:14.360]  sounds like some kind of science fiction
[57:14.360 --> 57:16.360]  planet where it's a police state
[57:16.360 --> 57:18.360]  mentor and he said
[57:18.360 --> 57:20.360]  oh we fund communists and fascists
[57:20.360 --> 57:22.360]  we want to get rid of freedom in America
[57:22.360 --> 57:24.360]  we want to control both parties
[57:24.360 --> 57:26.360]  we have a controlled conservative opposition
[57:26.360 --> 57:28.360]  so people have nowhere to run
[57:28.360 --> 57:30.360]  so the globalists are the enemies of conservatives
[57:30.360 --> 57:32.360]  you know I say get outside the left right paradigm
[57:32.360 --> 57:34.360]  the fake left right controlled left right
[57:34.360 --> 57:36.360]  but the globalists do see
[57:36.360 --> 57:38.360]  the quote right
[57:38.360 --> 57:40.360]  as their enemy
[57:40.360 --> 57:42.360]  so they try to change what the right is
[57:42.360 --> 57:44.360]  the right isn't about torture, illegal surveillance, secret arrest
[57:44.360 --> 57:46.360]  illegal wars and tyranny
[57:46.360 --> 57:48.360]  the right as they would call it
[57:48.360 --> 57:50.360]  is more like Thomas Jefferson was
[57:50.360 --> 57:52.360]  who they would call a liberal in that day
[57:52.360 --> 57:54.360]  these terms can be interchanged
[57:54.360 --> 57:56.360]  but what they think of as a right winger
[57:56.360 --> 57:58.360]  pro-gun, pro-family, pro-sovereignty
[57:58.360 --> 58:00.360]  pro-due process
[58:00.360 --> 58:02.360]  limited government
[58:02.360 --> 58:04.360]  limited government
[58:04.360 --> 58:06.360]  so if they hate conservatives, real conservatives
[58:06.360 --> 58:08.360]  they really hate libertarians
[58:08.360 --> 58:10.360]  we're gonna go to break, come back, take a few more of your calls
[58:10.360 --> 58:12.360]  from Travis

[58:22.360 --> 58:24.360]  why do you have so much energy
[58:24.360 --> 58:26.360]  well I did have two delicious cups of Mexican coffee
[58:26.360 --> 58:28.360]  from that I get it root of my um
[58:28.360 --> 58:30.360]  other than that

[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.360]  Larry Graff wall
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.360]  he infiltrated the murderous
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.360]  communist that trained
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.360]  Obama
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.360]  they wanted to kill back then in the 70s
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.360]  they wanted to kill
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.360]  25 million landowners
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.360]  gun owners, conservatives, Christians
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.360]  they wanted to line us up and blow our heads off
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.360]  and that's always been their plan
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.360]  and guys I forgot to do this because I pulled it again Sunday
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.360]  Aaron's in there right now with
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.360]  McAdoo you asked him because he'll be the quickest
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.360]  to print army documents
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.360]  cover reeducation camps
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.360]  or you know what that whole stack from Sunday
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.360]  that police state stack that I used Friday night
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.360]  on coast to coast AM
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.360]  it's a big giant stack of army documents
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.360]  reeducation camps, gun confiscation drills
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.360]  how to process this by social security
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.360]  how to find people that
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.360]  don't follow the politically
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.360]  incorrect stuff
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.360]  to pick up the politically incorrect
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.360]  just pull me those documents
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.360]  because I want to read the army code
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.360]  read the manuals because
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.360]  our friend Larry Graff wall
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.360]  will be able to give us his take on all of that
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.360]  and what's currently happening and a lot more
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.360]  right now let's go to some of your calls
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.360]  Travis in Georgia you're on the air
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.360]  welcome
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.360]  hello sir, good day
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.360]  what's on your mind there Travis do you need to go to a FEMA camp
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.360]  for a little while
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.360]  yeah with the state
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.360]  my mind is that now that would probably be
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.360]  the best thing
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.360]  you know but
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.360]  what's on my mind
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.360]  other than the miracle fact of me
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.360]  waking up and how that came about
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.360]  it's just
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.360]  the symbolism everywhere and everything
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.360]  I see it's
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.360]  all around us and everybody's here
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.360]  they're bombarding us with psychological warfare
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.360]  yeah and that's what I get when
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.360]  you say they call it psych warfare
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.360]  you call it info
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.360]  info war
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.360]  too but we're using the truth and common sense
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.360]  you know evil stuff
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.360]  like the UN shouldn't be commanding
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.360]  our military and telling congress
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.360]  they have no authority now that's a pretty big deal
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.360]  yeah but
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.360]  what about little Wayne
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.360]  releasing a music video
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.360]  three days before Colorado
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.360]  Aurora top Colorado
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.360]  and he had towards the
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.360]  12 skeletons
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.360]  yes yes
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.360]  you know that could be a coincidence though
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.360]  but when you have other things
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.360]  where they have you know
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.360]  20 TV shows and movies
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.360]  where gun owners blow up a
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.360]  federal building and then the brother
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.360]  of the governor who's involved in all this
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.360]  Psyop stuff writes a book where
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.360]  Tom McVeigh
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.360]  bombs the federal building and then that's
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.360]  used to take over and arrest the patriots
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.360]  and then the exact same thing happens
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.360]  that's different
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.360]  that's different
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.360]  you can see the, listen
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.360]  when I was growing up
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.360]  all the soldiers you know
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.360]  on the TV shows fought for the UN
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.360]  the toys are all UN global peacekeeper
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.360]  in fact one of those toys is sitting out there on the counter

[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.360]  or at least it was a few days ago my kids had dug it out of storage
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.360]  here at the office we're looking at it
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.360]  there's all these toys about global peacekeeper

[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.360]  military toys
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.360]  that say USA on it like when I was a kid

[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.360]  and
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.360]  you know the new toys are police
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.360]  running checkpoints on the highway
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.360]  and putting people through body scanners
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.360]  and everybody ready this is all part of a unified program
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.360]  anything else sir
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.360]  um other than
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:10.360]  the fact that I'm just about ready to
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.360]  give up this
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.360]  life in society to spread
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.360]  the word I think that's all I have
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.360]  well that is all we
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.360]  have is defeating this criminal takeover
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.360]  which is a lot bigger than Obama
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.360]  I mean Obama you know
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.360]  drifts off down the
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.360]  way politically they'll
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.360]  rehabilitate him and you know making some type of
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.360]  humanitarian like Clinton and others
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.360]  and Bush but our big
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.360]  issue is the ruling class
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.360]  the mega rich don't want a free
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.360]  market they're the enemy
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.360]  they want monopolies and that's what
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.360]  we've got to explain to the disenfranchised
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:46.360]  poor people and welfare folks
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.360]  is this is pressure from below and above
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.360]  the ultra rich like
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.360]  Soros Armin Hammer before him
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.360]  they are funding the communist takeover
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.360]  because they are exempt from it
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.360]  the worst drought
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.360]  in 50 years continues
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.360]  and the first 6 months of 2012 marks
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.360]  the hottest half year on record
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.360]  78% of the Midwest corn belt
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.360]  is in drought conditions not only corn
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.360]  but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.360]  and wheat are all impacted raising prices
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.360]  the cost to feed livestock is forcing
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.360]  farmers and ranchers out of business
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.360]  blowing up your food prices the only
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.360]  strategy to counter this is to freeze
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.360]  your food cost to today's prices
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.360]  by getting your own supply of foods
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.360]  direct now as the price of raw
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.360]  ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.360]  prices too now is the time to get your supply
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.360]  I recently increased my supply
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.360]  from e-foods direct because we've all known

[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.360]  and we are joined
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.360]  by Larry Grafwall
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.360]  who's been on with us before
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.360]  you've also heard us many times
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.360]  play the clip
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.360]  where he breaks down being
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.360]  on the top of the weatherman organization
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.360]  as an infiltrator
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.360]  and they're talking about when they take over
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.360]  through the big federal government
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.360]  this is Obama's mentors
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.360]  the weatherman that literally raised him
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.360]  and took care of him
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.360]  said they're gonna put 50 million of us
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.360]  in a reeducation camp
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:54.360]  until 25 million of us
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.360]  now
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.360]  new army documents
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.360]  that the army responded to and said yes
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.360]  that PDF is real
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.360]  it's restricted
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.360]  and then later they put it out on a national guard site
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.360]  after we got it
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:08.360]  kind of like okay we'll just hide it in plain view
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:11.360]  it is fm3-39.40
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.360]  it's how to put Americans in reeducation camps
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.360]  who are quote political agitators
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.360]  and how to reeducate us
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:19.360]  in the camps
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.360]  and how to process their social security numbers
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:24.360]  it's fm3-39.40
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.360]  and
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.360]  I thought we'd get
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:31.360]  Mr. Grathwall on because
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.360]  we've got all these Obama advisors
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.360]  and we played clips yesterday
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.360]  of them saying a new Oklahoma city
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.360]  or 9-11 will help get him elected
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.360]  and hey there'll be
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.360]  big events that will blame it on our enemies
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.360]  I mean they don't even
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.360]  they don't say they're going to do it
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.360]  but
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.360]  they come very close
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.360]  to saying they're going to stage something
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:55.360]  so my question to him is
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.360]  does he expect knowing the type of people
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.360]  that are in and around Obama
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.360]  to try to stage something
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.360]  before the election
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.360]  because we've got a lot of
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.360]  Homeland Security sources
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.360]  and I've got police sources
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.360]  that are being told something big is happening
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360]  around the election
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.360]  get ready for all Hades to break loose
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.360]  now maybe that's not going to happen
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.360]  but I've got a lot of people
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.360]  telling police military
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.360]  that I've talked to on air but also people I know
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.360]  and contacts that give us good information
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.360]  I've never heard this much chatter
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.360]  and then you've got again
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.360]  Robert Shapiro in the Financial Times of London
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.360]  saying barring a new Oklahoma city
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.360]  Obama will not
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.360]  get re-elected
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.360]  and then the president needs that
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.360]  to reconnect with the people
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.360]  and I can pull the quote up if you want us to show it again
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.360]  the point is all of this is going on
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.360]  he's a member of the Army
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.360]  in the Airborne in Vietnam
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.360]  and then he came back
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.360]  and was going to college
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.360]  and they were openly calling for
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.360]  communist takeovers
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.360]  he got invited to the meetings
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.360]  they were openly calling for violence and bombing
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.360]  so he went to the FBI
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.360]  they said well infiltrate it
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.360]  and he helped put some of these people behind bars
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.360]  and stop others from carrying out other events
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.360]  and he's trying to right now
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.360]  for police officers they killed and others
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.360]  they're still trying to get prosecution
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.360]  against some of the people
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.360]  that the evidence shows were involved
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.360]  so we're dealing with very radical
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.360]  dangerous people
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.360]  is my point, well they did the fast and furious
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:26.360]  and they could do anything
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.360]  they staged a false flag
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.360]  Larry Graphwald, good to have you on with us
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.360]  I've thrown out a lot here in the last few minutes
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.360]  while you're sitting there on hold
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.360]  what is front and center on your radar screen right now?
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.360]  Well first of all
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.360]  thanks for having me on your program again
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.360]  I
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.360]  really enjoy this
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.360]  I can't
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.360]  hardly add anything to what you've said
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.360]  in the introduction
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.360]  I look at
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.360]  Barack Obama
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.360]  and remember the speech that he gave
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.360]  not too long ago
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.360]  comparing himself to
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.360]  Abraham Lincoln
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.360]  and Franklin Roosevelt
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.360]  and I believe it was Wilson
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.360]  that he compared himself to
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.360]  people
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.360]  presidents that he considers to be
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.360]  the greatest presidents we've ever had
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.360]  it's interesting to note
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.360]  that he didn't mention George Washington
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.360]  who in my opinion
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.360]  is the greatest president we ever had
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.360]  because that man
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.360]  was in a position to be king
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.360]  if he wanted to be
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.360]  and he is certainly
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.360]  responsible for the fact that we're still
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.360]  a democracy today
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:36.360]  not only in that he led us
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.360]  over the British but that he
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.360]  turned down being a king
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.360]  which at that time
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.360]  it would have been very easy for him to do
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.360]  Well no one had ever done that in fact King George III
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.360]  when he got the letter back
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.360]  a month after with the crossing of the Atlantic
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.360]  that George Washington turned down
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.360]  the kingship that was being offered to him by basically everybody
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.360]  and Hamilton wanted that
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.360]  that he refused it
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.360]  the quote by King George III was
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.360]  that George Washington was the greatest
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.360]  man alive in the world
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.360]  yeah exactly
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.360]  and ironically
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.360]  our president doesn't even
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:12.360]  bother to include him
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:14.360]  now I don't know if that's because he doesn't
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.360]  think he's as great as him
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.360]  or if he doesn't think George Washington
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.360]  is as great as the
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.360]  III he mentioned but regardless
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.360]  we're talking about a president
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.360]  whose ego is gigantic
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.360]  he believes that he's
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.360]  that he's the equal to Abraham Lincoln
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.360]  and
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.360]  I mean you know has
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.360]  there been
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.360]  a greater president since George
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.360]  Washington than Abraham Lincoln
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.360]  I don't think so
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.360]  given that
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.360]  when you put all of that together
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.360]  you realize that this is an individual
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.360]  who is not going to take
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.360]  defeat easily
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.360]  and my belief
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.360]  is remembering what
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.360]  his advisors have said
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.360]  before Axelrod
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.360]  the other guy that's
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:04.360]  mayor now of Chicago
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.360]  that you never let a catastrophe
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.360]  go to waste so you're
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.360]  exactly right if
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.360]  another Twin Towers
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.360]  was to happen if another
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:16.360]  bomb in Oklahoma City was to
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.360]  happen it would be a
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.360]  reason for the administration
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.360]  to declare martial law
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:24.360]  possibly suspend
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.360]  elections until
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.360]  they decided that it was safe
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.360]  to have them again
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.360]  and start
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.360]  rounding up dissenters like
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.360]  ourselves
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.360]  and we know that
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.360]  this
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.360]  somebody is thinking about it
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.360]  because of the documents
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:46.360]  you mentioned earlier and also
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.360]  the NDAA
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.360]  the National Defense
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:52.360]  Authorization Act that's what
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.360]  gives the president
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.360]  the power
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.360]  to use these
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.360]  regulations that you were talking
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.360]  about. That's right we're not speculating
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.360]  in a vacuum this is now reality
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.360]  secret arrest
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.360]  reeducation camps
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.360]  1.4 billion rounds
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.360]  it's not just 750, 450, 250
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.360]  it's now 1.4 billion
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.360]  total in the last 12 months
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.360]  armored vehicles
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.360]  being delivered everywhere what's going on
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.360]  from your highly informed view
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.360]  it's
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.360]  if it walks like a duck
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.360]  and it's got webbed feet and it quacks
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.360]  it's a duck
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.360]  I like you
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.360]  hope that I'm wrong and that
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.360]  my suspicions are
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.360]  totally incorrect
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.360]  and that this election will come
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.360]  and go peacefully and that
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.360]  we'll have
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.360]  we'll have good reason
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.360]  to look back on this
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.360]  in a few months and laugh
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.360]  but my experience
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.360]  tells me to expect the worst
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.360]  I mean I heard the weatherman
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.360]  in meetings
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.360]  describe how they were going to round up
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.360]  it was 100 million people
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.360]  and put them in reeducation
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.360]  centers and now
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.360]  we find out that the government is creating
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.360]  reeducation centers
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.360]  some of Obama's closest
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.360]  advisors are
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.360]  ex-members of the other underground
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.360]  and that's not just Bernardine
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.360]  Dorian Bill Ayers
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.360]  Jeff Jones is one of the founders
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.360]  of the Apollo group
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.360]  that Apollo group was involved
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.360]  in the stimulus package
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:30.360]  the first stimulus package
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.360]  and also in helping
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.360]  the Obama administration
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.360]  put together Obamacare
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.360]  so Jeff Jones is one of the
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.360]  founders of the weather underground
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.360]  along with Bernardine and Bill
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.360]  and Mark Rudd and several others
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.360]  and
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.360]  he's probably closer to the
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.360]  administration
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.360]  than Bill and Bernardine right now
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.360]  well we have homeland security
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.360]  sources across the board
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.360]  who are apologizing and saying
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.360]  I thought you were too extreme
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.360]  that this is being discussed
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.360]  and they're reportedly running around the highest levels
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.360]  of homeland security giggling
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:10.360]  and laughing not worried about the
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.360]  lesbian sex scandals none of it
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.360]  because they're saying oh you wait
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.360]  we know something big is coming
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:18.360]  we're not going anywhere
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.360]  and we have fundraising letters
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.360]  we know from two years ago that even Glenn Beck
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.360]  got and covered
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:26.360]  where they send them out to Democratic donors
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.360]  and say don't worry if he gets down in the polls
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.360]  there's going to be a crisis
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.360]  and we're going to blame it on people
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.360]  I mean they're so arrogant
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.360]  yes absolute arrogance
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.360]  and you know if you think about it
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.360]  from one perspective
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.360]  why shouldn't they be arrogant
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.360]  everything that they have touched
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.360]  in recent years has turned to gold
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:48.360]  who would have ever suspected
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.360]  that known
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.360]  terrorist bombers
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:54.360]  that had murdered policemen
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.360]  and assisted in
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.360]  the death of three of their own members
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:00.360]  would be
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.360]  not only free and walking the streets
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.360]  but would be
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.360]  educators and
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:08.360]  well known quote unquote
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.360]  celebrities
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.360]  to the extent that
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:14.360]  you know news media would be
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.360]  talking to him and asking him
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.360]  what they thought
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.360]  you know I would have never suspected
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.360]  in a million years that
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:24.360]  Bernardine Dorn and Bill Ayers
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.360]  wouldn't be in prison at this time
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.360]  of their lives
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:30.360]  and instead I'm contemplating
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.360]  the fact that it could very
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.360]  possibly be me
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.360]  that winds up in one of these
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.360]  reeducation centers
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.360]  where they're going to try to teach me
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.360]  you know a new way to think
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.360]  and of course
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.360]  that isn't going to work
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.360]  it's one other thing that you pointed out earlier
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.360]  about the
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:52.360]  UN peacekeeper
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.360]  the UN
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.360]  and the law that they're trying to pass
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.360]  about gun control
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.360]  essentially
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.360]  superseding the constitution
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.360]  you know Hillary Clinton
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.360]  has come out and support for this thing
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.360]  and is supporting it
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.360]  getting passed through
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.360]  the United Nations
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.360]  and then of course that'll be
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.360]  the excuse for
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.360]  implementing it here in the United States
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.360]  and where
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.360]  have we ever voted
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.360]  to allow
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.360]  UN law to supersede
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.360]  our law?
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.360]  And by the way Article 15
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.360]  says nations agree to help the UN
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.360]  invade countries
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.360]  to take civilian firearms
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:38.360]  I mean
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.360]  and then they run this saw up going
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.360]  there's nothing about your guns in there
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.360]  and openly says
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.360]  and the drafters say in meetings
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.360]  at Unidire we interpret this to mean
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.360]  we're going to have an abolition
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:52.360]  of civilian ownership of firearms
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.360]  because it threatens a legitimate power monopoly
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.360]  of the state and that was a quote folks
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:06.360]  we'll be right back
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.360]  this is the film for you

[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.360]  the book that woke me up
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.360]  we're also carrying behind the green mask

[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.360]  my daughter had alternating diarrhea
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.360]  and constipation she suffered
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.360]  from hair loss, listlessness
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.360]  and was stunted in her growth
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.360]  after getting her onto two supplements suggested
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.360]  by Neutropath Steven Hewer
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.360]  she has improved dramatically
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.360]  her stools had normalized
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.360]  her hair and her body are growing again
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.360]  and she is beaming
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.360]  I credit the majority of her improvement
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:24.360]  to One World Way

[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.360]  is a better source of protein
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.360]  than meat, milk or eggs

[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.360]  in fact the Wall Street Journal reported
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.360]  that we could soon face blackouts

[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.360]  boosting nitric oxide is how the popular
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.360]  pharmaceuticals work to increase performance
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.360]  this is the last week
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.360]  where you can try T-Gen
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.360]  and receive three bottles of nitro boost
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.360]  absolutely free
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.360]  that's right free
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.360]  but the countdown on this outrageous offer has begun

[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.360]  even better this crazy offer
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.360]  is backed by a 90 day satisfaction guarantee
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.360]  call right now

[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.360]  you know we have a normalcy bias
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.360]  we call the Stockholm syndrome whatever you want
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.360]  that even when we got this army document
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.360]  and found out that
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.360]  they had linked it on a national guard site
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.360]  and it was supposed to be restricted
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.360]  but people uploading stuff
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.360]  and it's getting shared with tens of thousands of
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.360]  MPs
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:34.360]  and regular military is now getting the training
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.360]  and it has the 10 FEMA regions
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.360]  how they are going to run it all
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.360]  I was just showing it on prisonplanet.tv
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.360]  for viewers I was going through
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.360]  this 2010
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:46.360]  that started under Obama
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.360]  you know a lot of bad stuff happened under Bush
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:50.360]  you can definitely say the TSA groping
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:52.360]  the checkpoints
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:54.360]  the TSA on the streets
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.360]  all these army manuals
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.360]  about gun confiscation is Obama
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.360]  now maybe Mitt Romney will get in
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.360]  and continue it as bad as things are
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.360]  I don't know
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.360]  I just have to be honest because you know I'm nonpartisan
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.360]  this is all happening under Mr. Obama
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.360]  and his controllers
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.360]  and our homeland security
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.360]  one of them said
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.360]  they are going hot
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.360]  they are dancing around
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.360]  saying we are not worried
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.360]  they are going to pull something
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:24.360]  our sources
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.360]  and I've got them from police to FBI
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.360]  to Doug Hagman sources
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.360]  that I know is in federal law enforcement
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.360]  they are all saying the same thing
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.360]  that's why Janet is running around
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.360]  acting like a crazy person
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.360]  in homeland security
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:40.360]  that's why all these women under him are
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:42.360]  these are crazy people
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.360]  Hitler was crazy
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.360]  Mao was crazy
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.360]  these are crazy people
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.360]  they love power
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.360]  their idea of fun is arresting families
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.360]  and putting you in reeducation camps
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.360]  these are demons they love abortion
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.360]  they hate the family
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.360]  you hear them all the time
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.360]  these are really evil people
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.360]  I'm ranting sir
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.360]  I'm just so freaked out
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:08.360]  that all of this is really happening
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.360]  Larry do you think because of public exposure
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.360]  they might back off
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.360]  with Obama's mentors
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:16.360]  saying they want to kill 25 million of us
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.360]  I don't think so
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.360]  again I go back to the fact
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.360]  that in the last 10 or 20 years
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:24.360]  everything they've touched has turned to gold
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.360]  and I think that
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.360]  well to quote Bill Ayers
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.360]  in a recent interview
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.360]  I'm going to say maybe 2 or 3 months ago
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:36.360]  he said
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.360]  that the United States
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.360]  is going to change
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.360]  and never return
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.360]  to the way it was
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.360]  so I mean
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.360]  Bill Ayers is one of
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.360]  Barack's mentors
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.360]  he certainly knows Barack better
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.360]  than he admits or that Barack omits
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.360]  well Barack lived with him
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.360]  in college and that's been confirmed
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.360]  yeah
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:02.360]  so it's
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.360]  does Bill know something I don't
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.360]  I mean what could possibly
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.360]  be about to change
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:10.360]  and then you look at the
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.360]  average American
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.360]  we
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.360]  I mean I've been telling people
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.360]  for years now
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.360]  that hey
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.360]  look at things as if there's a
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.360]  disaster headed your way
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.360]  you need to
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.360]  store food
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.360]  you need water
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.360]  you need to be able to take care of yourself
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.360]  for at least a month or two months
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:36.360]  and you need to have some weapons
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.360]  to defend yourself
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.360]  and I don't mean to
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.360]  people out on the street
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.360]  vigilante style
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.360]  I'm talking about
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.360]  protecting yourself from
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.360]  the gangs and the mobs
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.360]  that could very easily be
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.360]  well that's what all my sources say is the plan
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:56.360]  let things break down a while
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:58.360]  and then have the public bag for the
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.360]  tyranny to restore order
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.360]  but you need to be prepared
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.360]  let's face it
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.360]  your wife
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.360]  is killed in one of these incidents
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.360]  you're going to feel terrible
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.360]  and it's going to make
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.360]  your cry for
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.360]  government intervention even
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.360]  louder if you have the ability
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.360]  to protect and defend
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.360]  yourself
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:24.360]  your pleas to the government
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.360]  are going to be a little less
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.360]  intense
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.360]  but that's not what they want
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:32.360]  you're exactly right Alex
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.360]  they're going to bring us
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.360]  to be on our knees
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:38.360]  begging them to save us
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.360]  and that's what communists do everywhere
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.360]  they'll get their soft people in
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.360]  who bring the country down
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.360]  and then bring in something even worse
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.360]  as the quote saviour
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.360]  I mean this is a communist program
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.360]  listen
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.360]  I don't know how many times I've been
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.360]  in a demonstration
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:58.360]  back in the 60s and the 70s
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.360]  where the beer bottles and the rocks
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.360]  were the crowd
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.360]  and of course when the police came in
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.360]  it was the front of the crowd
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.360]  that took the brunt of the attack
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:10.360]  the people
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.360]  who were causing all the trouble
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.360]  were in back and they got away
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.360]  these people are such cowardly scum
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:20.360]  they may have bitten off more than they can chew
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.360]  this was a short segment Larry
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.360]  we're going to come back with a long segment

[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.360]  ladies and gentlemen
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.360]  the reeducation camp document
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:42.360]  surreal
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:44.360]  the 1.4 billion bullet surreal
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.360]  the training to take on the constitutionalist
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.360]  is the new number 1 enemy
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.360]  it's all real
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:52.360]  we're on the march
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:54.360]  the empire is on the run
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:30:06.880]  If you want an American company with American products made by American, here is the Cal
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.600]  Bend Soap Company.

[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:38.520]  you're using now or save big with a one to two year supply of soaps for all your cleaning
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:39.520]  needs.

[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:22.300]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:25.280]  your own supply of foods from Eat Foods Direct now.
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:29.120]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, Eat Foods will have to raise prices too.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.800]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:34.960]  I recently increased my supply from Eat Food Direct because we all know this was coming.
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:37.520]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.920]  The fact is you can eat it anytime to save money today and because it's stored for 25
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:45.360]  years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.

[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:03.080]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid and generate your
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.680]  own supply of electrical power.
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:08.640]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.440]  and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:12.840]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:16.320]  Thousands of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:20.480]  storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:24.920]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts and if you don't
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:28.800]  have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:33.200]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions From Science are offering huge savings on their
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:35.560]  best-selling power hub unit.
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:38.640]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:41.680]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:45.520]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:48.440]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:53.680]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at beattheblackouts.com.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:33:22.760]  That's beattheblackouts.com.
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:29.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have to be honest with you, the next few months coming up to
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:35.480]  the election in November is one of the most dangerous periods this country has ever been
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:38.280]  in.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:41.680]  And that's because, yes, we know the globalists control Romney.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:45.960]  We know to a certain extent it is Obamney or Romney.
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:51.160]  We know Romney has been anti-gun, pro-abortion, carbon taxes, all of this because that's what
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.360]  the globalists want.
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:58.600]  But with Obama, you've got a real crew of New York, Chicago, mafia.
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.440]  They all want seats at that table.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:05.560]  They are all making hundreds of millions of dollars, in some cases individually.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:09.600]  There has never been such a looting with the energy deals and the shutting down of power
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.680]  plants not owned by insiders.
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:14.880]  They do not want to turn it loose.
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:19.680]  And in their public letters, they say, I played them yesterday on Hardball.
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:21.200]  Hey, we need a new event.
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.200]  It'll help us.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.920]  Hey, don't worry, fundraisers, no matter how far it gets down, there'll be a crisis.
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:28.320]  We'll blame it on our enemies.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:33.600]  I mean, this is one degree from just coming out and saying they're going to do it.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:36.320]  And exposing them may stop them.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:41.440]  But we've got county judges in Texas saying that they're going to resist this.
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:42.960]  The states are saying no.
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:48.040]  Northcom, the different defense acts states that it's ready for state insurrection by
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:54.440]  legislatures two years or last year when the state legislature of Texas had no more TSA
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:35:00.120]  going in our pants because they were molesting the state reps and their families.
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.360]  Obama's people said, we'll have an F-16 blockade of the state.
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:04.360]  That was in the news.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:07.160]  It's like, oh, I mean, that's how the civil war started.
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:10.480]  So the point is, they mean business.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:14.440]  I've talked to members of the Army and then later confirmed it, not just with callers
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:19.360]  but with people I know in the Army, that when Rick Perry joked last year and said Texas
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:25.360]  might want to secede, they put the National Guards that are federalized in all surrounding
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:31.920]  states on alert to invade Texas if Rick Perry was serious.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:32.920]  And of course, he wasn't.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:35.080]  It was rhetoric.
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:38.520]  And they confirmed air blockade.
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:42.240]  So we're going to go to our guest here in a moment and talk about that and take your
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.880]  phone calls and see where he thinks things are going.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:50.240]  But this is a very perilous time with all the preparations we see out there and police
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:56.840]  being told, get ready to have martial law in October or late October, early November.
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.640]  I hope we've posed this.
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:03.600]  It comes and goes and that whoever the new puppet is just gets in there.
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:07.360]  But if Obama doesn't face reelection, then the sky's the limit.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:10.360]  We're going to go back to our guest here in just a moment.
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:15.760]  Briefly, I should remind you that infowars.com and prisonplanet.com are the front lines of
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.160]  the info war.
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.160]  We are listener supported.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:22.040]  I've hired six new reporters who are getting trained and they're doing a great job.
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:29.760]  I've hired seven people for the newspaper, graphic designers, news layout people.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:30.760]  We're accelerating that.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:31.760]  Big success.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:36.120]  It takes money to run this and I try to sell products that I believe in.
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:37.120]  So I get up here.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.400]  I mean, believe me, I'd rather not sit up here all the time pitching stuff.
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.040]  It's stuff I use.
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:44.000]  If I use it, if I believe in it, I promote it.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.880]  infowarshealth.com, the very best vitamin and mineral supplements, you name it.
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:56.080]  It's their incredible products, the best infowarshealth.com or infowarsteam.com if you want to be a distributor
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:57.080]  and get discounts.

[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:02.840]  products.
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:04.640]  That's all there.
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:08.280]  The propure water filters, the best gravity fed stainless steel filters.
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:12.640]  They even got fluoride filters that you can get with it that cut it almost down to nothing.
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:15.440]  The system, I use myself on the RV or at my home.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:20.040]  We have one here at the office as well, 10% off already the lowest price on the Internet
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:25.640]  where the biggest distributor, infowarshop.com or infowarsstore.com will also take you to
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:31.640]  the shopping cart or link through at infowars.com, all the books, all the videos, all of it.
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:38.480]  The Obama deception, it's all available at infowarshop.com or infowarsstore.com.
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:47.000]  I've now got 51 employees and contractors, 51 and let me tell you, it is a big deal to
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.960]  manage everybody and to get everything done and I'm happy to do it, but it's all because
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:55.720]  of your support and our tireless efforts, so thank you.
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:59.680]  We're putting on the best defense of the republic and our constitutional republic.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:05.640]  We can, we're doing the best job we can to really cut to the bone of the issues and to
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:11.360]  have media matters and think progress so they want to shut us down, their White House run,
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:14.640]  to have incredible stuff behind the scenes go on.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:19.560]  It's very creepy, but believe me, you know how real this is when you get the threats
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:20.920]  when the rest of it happens.
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:25.200]  We're going 110% against this and we couldn't do it without your support, so please spread
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:26.640]  the word about the broadcast.
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:32.160]  Now Larry Grafwald, again former Army Ranger of Vietnam in college, Weather Underground
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:33.160]  tried to recruit him.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:36.600]  He infiltrated for the FBI, helped send a bunch of them to prison.
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.680]  He's trying to send some of them to prison for killing cops right now.
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:43.000]  We should talk about some of that before we go to calls, but we've thrown a lot of this
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.400]  out there.
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:48.320]  What are other things that you're really focused on right now and what do you think
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:52.680]  we can do to stop all of this, stop a false flag?
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:39:00.320]  Well, I think what you're doing is exactly what needs to be done, what you and Cliff
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:05.040]  Kincaid and others are doing to try to get the message out.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:08.720]  How effective that's going to be, I'm not sure.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:19.720]  Again, we're dealing with an ego that is beyond anything I've ever seen in my life.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:30.320]  What he is willing to do as far as his second term in office is up in the air.
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:36.440]  I mean the National Defense Authorization Act is a perfect example of implementing what
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:42.400]  you had mentioned earlier in the program, the Army documents that indicate that they've
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:48.360]  already got plans on how they're going to handle people like you and I.
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:53.400]  Now if you can believe that, I've grown up in a country where I believe that I'm free
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:40:01.280]  to say whatever I want to say short of something that is going to wind up harming someone.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:05.440]  In other words, I can't holler fire in a movie theater.
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:07.480]  Well that makes sense, doesn't it?
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:14.560]  I would never think of doing such a thing, but standing outside the theater and hollering
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:17.840]  fire is a different story, isn't it?
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.360]  That's what we're dealing with right now.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:23.800]  The Occupy Movement is all over the place.
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:28.520]  They have no regard for your and our rights.
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:31.560]  If we're trying to cross the street, they'll block it.
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:35.280]  If they have to block traffic, it could make no difference to them.
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:43.040]  Somehow we've reached a point where this government, and this is Barack Obama, who allows these
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:50.960]  things to happen up when including the new Black Panther Party, posting people at a polling
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:41:01.240]  site with clubs, I mean I know you've seen the video I have of those two black gentlemen
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:05.440]  standing there in the most threatening way possible.
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:12.680]  People admitted that it intimidated them and they didn't vote and yet there was no prosecution.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:21.240]  But Bernardine Dorn and Bill Ayers, who we have significant evidence that they were involved
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:27.200]  in the Park Police Station bombing that resulted in the death of a police officer, are no closer
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:32.320]  to being prosecuted than they were 20 or 30 years ago.
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:37.200]  Well, expanding on that, I know you worked with the FBI, they've certainly had their
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:38.200]  own problems.
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.720]  They've been caught provocaturing and things.
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:49.060]  I've seen a lot of evidence that the FBI has provocatured some of these new Black Panther
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:50.560]  Party type groups.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:54.440]  I don't know how they do get away with that because I know this, if I did something like
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.920]  that, I would be arrested very quickly.
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:03.280]  It came out Hal Turner, the big white supremacist, was like an FBI minion.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:08.840]  My whole point is the FBI itself today is run by people that were the types that were
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:14.120]  in the weather underground, so what do you say about those agencies today?
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:20.520]  I can't say, Alex, I can tell you this from my own personal experience.
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:29.040]  I was controlled by the FBI to the extent that sometimes I had to do what I knew I had
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:33.760]  to do even though they had instructed me differently.
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:40.320]  The FBI I was dealing with was the one that had dealt with the Communist Party, USA, during
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:46.080]  the 50s, and they were still in the coat and the tie and the hat.
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:52.440]  All of a sudden, in the late 60s and the early 70s, we had the hippie generation and people
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:59.280]  with long hair and beards, and agents weren't even allowed to let their hair grow long.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:06.840]  They were still expected to have a short hair cut and to wear suits and ties, and I tried
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:14.040]  to explain to them then and what I had to do in order to infiltrate the weathermen.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:20.000]  A lot of times I had to go contrary to what that had instructed me, but the one thing
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:27.240]  they always emphasized was that I was not to come up with the plan, that I had to let
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:35.960]  the plan develop, and I was allowed to add to it as it developed, but I couldn't be the
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:36.960]  instigator.
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:43.720]  Now, what you're telling me is today that there's FBI agents who are actually provocateurs,
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:49.080]  and frankly, if that's the case, I disagree with it most heartily, but I can tell you
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:56.320]  that the agents I know and most of them today are retired, so again, I can't speak for the
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.320]  current problem.
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:02.920]  Sure, they weren't provocaturing, they were actually, I mean, if you're in a planning
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:07.160]  session and they've hatched a plan and they want your ideas, then obviously you're allowed
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:11.560]  to talk to them, but you're not supposed to say, hey, let's go blow up a bank or something.
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:13.120]  Yes, exactly.
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:19.400]  Once they say, hey, let's go blow up the bank, then you're allowed to say, well, we probably
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:26.640]  need a getaway car and we need explosives, but you can't be the one that comes up with
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:29.920]  the idea, and I adhered to that.
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:31.080]  Why have they been protected?
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:35.000]  I mean, some of them went to prison, thanks for your testimony, others, but I mean, now
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.160]  they're out of jail, pardoned by Clinton, some of them never went to jail, standing
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:46.480]  on American flags in magazines, that's supposedly cute, I mean, it's so ridiculous.
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:52.360]  Well Bill Ayers is in that magazine, standing on the flag and captioned as guilty as hell,
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:55.160]  free as a bird, is in America, wonderful.
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:59.600]  It's almost spitting in our face, isn't it?
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.600]  Here's what happened.
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:08.040]  The FBI used tactics that were authorized by the government during the 30s and the 40s,
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:16.280]  wiretaps and illegal entries, they call them surptitious entries.
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:17.280]  Conviction.
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:22.840]  Yes, bag jobs, and they would go in and what they were doing was looking for evidence,
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:27.920]  they weren't trying to find something that would convict someone, they just wanted to
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:31.720]  find out if the bad guy had been there.
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:39.560]  Well, when that came out, especially in front of the Frank Church Committee during the 80s,
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:47.000]  that came up with all kinds of controls over the intelligence agency that ultimately led
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.320]  to 9-11.
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:54.800]  Basically, what happened, Frank Church Committee said these intelligence agencies can no longer
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.960]  communicate with one another.
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:04.920]  So when the FBI found out that there was people in Arizona learning to fly airplanes but not
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:13.160]  learning to land them, they couldn't tell the Army or the CIA who had information, similar
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:15.120]  information from other locations.
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:18.720]  See, that's what's ridiculous about all this, I mean, they use that as an excuse to let
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:22.920]  operations not be known about because then they want the pretext to take our liberties.
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:27.600]  But I mean, I don't care, if I worked in some agency and I knew something was going on,
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:31.120]  I would make sure something got done about it, even if I got fired, I mean, I don't
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:35.520]  get to take Fast and Furious, they haven't even gotten in trouble for that.
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:39.520]  There's a prime example, Alex, Fast and Furious.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:44.200]  You talk about a numbskull idea in operation.
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:54.240]  The idea was that they were going to let legal licensed gun dealers sell guns illegally
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:59.760]  and they even encouraged them to do it and then they were going to trail the guns like
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:05.480]  it was going to be an easy job, come on, you buy a truckload of guns and suddenly they
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:10.880]  start heading in 15 directions, how many agents do you have to follow them?
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:18.160]  And lo and behold, they wind up over in Mexico and then one of our Border Patrol agents winds
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:23.640]  up dead and they find out it's one of the guns from Fast and Furious, guess what?
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:30.120]  The Justice Department and our Attorney General says, gee, I didn't know anything about it.
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:33.080]  And then they get caught lying and then they get caught saying in memos they were going
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:35.320]  to use it against the Second Amendment.
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:42.120]  And then he refuses to appear before Congress using executive privilege.
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:44.480]  Doesn't that sound like Watergate?
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:45.480]  It sure does.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:46.480]  It does, Larry.
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:49.400]  Let me ask you this and we're going to go to a few phone calls here for people that
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:52.000]  have been patient want to talk to you.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.160]  But in your gutter, your research, what type of dirty trick or false flag or October surprise
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:03.480]  knowing these people that influence the current criminals in charge, what type of stuff would
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:06.400]  they pull to stay in power?
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:13.880]  Well, I think the sky's the limit, but my own opinion is that the Occupy Movement, although
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:19.800]  it's been very quiet through this summer, I think it's going to get noisier and noisier
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:24.640]  and I think that's going to wind up being the catalyst.
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:31.600]  I think there's going to be more acts of violence as things go on, particularly around polling
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:34.960]  places and political meetings.
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:44.840]  It'll be a combination of the extreme right and the Occupy Movement that ultimately causes
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:53.440]  Barack Obama to say, hey, elections have to be suspended and martial law declared.
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:56.960]  That's complete speculation and recognize this.
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:02.600]  The more exposure that we give this, the less likely it is to happen.
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:10.680]  A rat doesn't like light and these guys from Chicago, they may have good plans and they
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:16.640]  may be good rats, but they don't like light and the more light we shine on them, the less
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:22.440]  likely it is that they'll try to do what they're planning.
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:27.800]  Well again, you talk about elements of extreme right and left, there was organic movements
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:32.480]  in Occupy, but the White House basically tried to take it over and then you've got groups
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:35.120]  trying to infiltrate right wing groups, getting people in fights.
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:41.600]  He caught the White House trying to provocateur in the Trayvon Martin case in their agitating
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.880]  trying to get some type of race war going.
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:48.480]  I mean, it's so diabolical, but it didn't work, it didn't work.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:54.560]  And understand, Alex, that this administration has done everything in its power to make sure
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.840]  that the division exists.
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:04.720]  They have done absolutely nothing to try to unite races, classes, or different groups
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:05.720]  of people.
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:13.120]  They have emphasized the differences and tried to make that a cutting edge.
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:16.400]  So it makes perfect sense.
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:22.240]  But understand, there are people on the extreme right that are just as crazy as the people
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:24.360]  on the extreme left.
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:32.920]  And then you've got these guys in the middle who are trying to manipulate all of it, and
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:34.680]  that's Barack Obama.
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:38.600]  And it's like, gee, what string do we pull over here on the right?
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:41.800]  What string do we pull over here on the left?
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:47.360]  And boy, wouldn't it be good to get both of these groups in a confrontation on the streets
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:48.360]  of Washington?
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:50.640]  Yeah, that's what a lot of our sources are saying.
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:54.480]  They want to get some type of civil unrest going and then clamp down and play the part
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:51:00.080]  of the referees when they stage it all to begin with.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:04.280]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid and generate your
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:05.960]  own supply of electrical power.
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:09.680]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:11.440]  and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:13.520]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:17.680]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:21.200]  and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:25.520]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts, and if you don't
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:29.320]  have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:33.600]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:35.920]  best-selling power hub unit.
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:38.960]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:41.880]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:45.640]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered.
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:48.520]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:53.600]  In Full Wars, listeners can get all the details at beattheblackouts.com.
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:58.200]  That's beattheblackouts.com.
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:00.800]  What's safer and cheaper than prescription drugs?
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:02.040]  Glad you asked.
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:04.600]  The answer is renovation teas.
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:08.520]  Herbal remedies are much safer and much cheaper than prescription drugs.
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:13.320]  Tastes great, and most importantly, herbal teas are effective and non-addictive.
[01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:16.120]  Renovation tea is especially unique, and here's why.
[01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:20.360]  We spent years researching herbs and their beneficial properties.
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:24.520]  Renovation teas uses only 100% organic, fair-trade herbs.
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:29.320]  Our teas are blended towards specific ailments and health conditions, such as diabetes, blood
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:33.600]  pressure, anxiety, libido, detox, and much more.
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:37.560]  All renovation teas are formulated and hand-filled in Arkansas.

[01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:00.440]  Hi there, my name is Frank Bates.
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:04.640]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:10.920]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:15.520]  monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent, lying crooks
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:20.760]  that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.920]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:27.440]  Others have called it a cover-up, and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:28.600]  goes.
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:34.240]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:36.640]  and how you can beat them too.
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:40.400]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.120]  in the last three months.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:47.480]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:48.480]  your home.
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:54.280]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:54:21.280]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:35.040]  Let's get Larry on air right now.
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:36.040]  Go ahead, Larry.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:37.040]  Start over.
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.040]  Okay.
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:53.640]  Let's go to some phone calls here.
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:57.640]  Let's go ahead and talk to Leon in Illinois.
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:54:58.640]  You're on the air.
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:00.640]  Welcome, and thanks for holding.
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:01.640]  Lenin.
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:02.640]  Hi.
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:06.040]  Look, we've just let this go too far.
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:12.200]  I think, basically, after all the hobbob, after spending however many late nights searching
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:16.240]  up articles with coffee, the last thing that we can all agree on is that it's just gone
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:17.240]  too far.
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:18.240]  I've got a comment for Larry.
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:22.240]  I've got a comment for the audience, and I've got a comment for you, Mr. Jenner.
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:23.240]  Go ahead.
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:28.840]  You say that Bill Laird says that there's going to be a time coming up soon at which
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:32.360]  the United States is going to change, and it's going to change dramatically, and it's
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:34.680]  not going to go back to the way it was.
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:36.680]  You know what?
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:37.680]  I completely agree with him.
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:44.840]  100% I do agree with him, because I, unlike him, still believe that human beings can actually
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:46.840]  do something when they put their minds to it.
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:51.640]  But you don't want to have a communist put you in a slave camp so they can walk around
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:52.640]  and feel powerful?
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:54.640]  You don't want him ruling over you?
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:56:01.760]  Absolutely not, because I know that regardless of all the ego Mr. Larry is talking about,
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:06.720]  regardless of all the ego that those guys have, that ego comes out of that pathetic
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:09.680]  little sense of fear that they need to feel.
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:12.880]  By the way, Larry is a psychologist in his bio.
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:17.520]  I didn't, that's not even on the bio on his site, but he's also a psychologist.
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.880]  That's why I can analyze the ego of these people.
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:24.160]  Yeah, that's what I've found is these are weak, grasping, power-tripping people who
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:26.000]  want to dominate others.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.040]  They don't get real power is when you convince people to like you and want to be around you
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:35.760]  because you're a nice person and have cool ideas, that's where real power comes from
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:38.360]  and then you're ashamed of all the power you get.
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:42.320]  In fact, what would you say about the weathermen type people?
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:45.120]  What's their basic psychology, Larry?
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:48.560]  Well, they want to be in control.
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:51.480]  They want power.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:56.440]  Bill Ayers wants to be Joseph Stalin.
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:02.920]  I used to marvel at the fact that when he would walk into a room, it was like God who'd
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:08.440]  appeared and people would shut up and wait for him to speak.
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:17.080]  Now keep in mind that we're supposed to be a socialist, communist organization and everybody's
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:18.360]  equal.
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:22.640]  But then how come it is that everyone shuts up when Bill or Trump-
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:23.640]  Sure, sure.
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:24.640]  How could you act like that?
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:28.120]  With a straight face and sit there and act like you were sycophantically listening to
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:31.840]  him because I would imagine if you didn't sycophant, they wouldn't keep you in there.
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:32.840]  How did you do it?
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:33.840]  Just overdo it?
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:34.840]  Oh, you're gracious.
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:38.760]  No, what I did is I played my role.
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:45.840]  I remember the weathermen had attended meetings in Cuba and in North Vietnam where they were
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:54.400]  criticized for recruiting academics and that they hadn't recruited veterans and working
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:56.480]  class people.
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:03.720]  Here I was and I knew that for, call it instinct, that this was what they were interested in
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:04.720]  me for.
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:05.720]  So I played that role.
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:12.200]  I remember setting in meetings and I had a straight razor that I used to carry in my
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:17.760]  hip pocket and I used to take it out and flip it in the heel of my boot.
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:25.560]  Now, you know that these are guys and women who probably don't even know what a straight
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:28.560]  razor is, let alone it's lethially.
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:29.560]  Stay there.
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:30.560]  I want to hear the rest of the story.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:35.600]  We have to go a little bit longer because I want to let Lennon and others get their
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:36.600]  question in.

[02:00:46.840 --> 02:01:16.280]  Well, people ask, where's the solution?
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:17.280]  That's it.
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:20.760]  I mean, you hear about this and look it up and find out it's true, you will start taking
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:21.760]  action.
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:22.760]  Exactly.
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:23.760]  Exactly.
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:28.760]  But you start taking action by really coming to terms with it because you can just sit
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:33.000]  back and listen to somebody talk about, oh, yeah, they want to kill 25, 30 million people.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:37.120]  Oh, yeah, that's horrible, yeah, those damn globalists, I hate them so much.
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:42.680]  But until you actually start sitting down and you take time away, get rid of all the
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:46.800]  television, get rid of all the radio, just take time tonight, take time tomorrow, find
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:51.240]  some free time in your schedule, and actually start thinking about what is actually going
[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:52.240]  on.
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:55.960]  And instead of just like everybody else out there, who when they first get their first
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:00.040]  glimpse, when you show somebody a 9-11 documentary and they're like, oh, that sounds good, but
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:05.520]  then they kind of run away, instead of having that fear that you can't actually do something,
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:10.880]  think about that there's millions of people right now who are in that exact same position,
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:13.560]  that there are people in government right now who are in that exact same position.
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:16.640]  That's right, there's people on the quote right and left that want to use crises and
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:18.760]  events to take our liberties, good points.
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:21.880]  And you just can't let people take your liberties.
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:25.360]  Anybody that does that is trying to take control of your life.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:26.720]  Larry, any comments on that?
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:30.440]  Yes, there's one other thing you have to understand.
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:33.880]  I'm not making this up about Bill Ayers.
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:35.520]  Bill Ayers calls me a liar.
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:37.920]  He says that he never even knew me.
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:45.600]  I sat across the kitchen table and listened to him plan a bombing in Detroit where the
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:50.560]  number of black people that were going to be killed in the bombing were numerous.
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:56.440]  And his response to me was, well, sometimes innocent people have to die in a revolution.
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:03:04.160]  I understand what you're saying and I support anything anyone has to say.
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:12.080]  What I have a problem with is when you decide to put a bomb in a restaurant or wherever
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:19.360]  and kill people that have done absolutely nothing other than live their lives.
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:23.560]  And in the name of your political beliefs, that's wrong.
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:28.960]  And I don't give a damn what anyone else says it's wrong.
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:31.240]  Well, it is wrong.
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:32.240]  It's absolutely wrong.
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:37.560]  I mean, I think the caller is saying is that he's going to take action politically.
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:39.360]  He's not going to just sit here and listen anymore.
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:40.360]  I hope he does.
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:44.080]  In fact, I believe when we come back when we talk about what you guys are doing and
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:48.920]  trying to bring some of these people to justice, Bruce in Kansas here on the air, go ahead.
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:49.920]  Quick question.
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:50.920]  Hi.
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:51.920]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:55.480]  First of all, I wanted to say I'm a total believer in the Tangy tangerine.
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:00.000]  I use that stuff every day to Larry.
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:06.680]  I want to know your take on the recent shooting in Colorado and the two dead nine wounded
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:09.360]  at the Empire State Building here recently.
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:17.480]  And also this whole entire like Chicago thing where it's, I mean, it's what 19 people shot
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:18.480]  overnight.
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:23.000]  I mean, the 30 shot in one night, you know, we're going to go to break.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.320]  We'll come back and get his take on that on the other side.
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:28.080]  Any other questions for Larry?
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:35.520]  Oh, no, I mean, I wanted to know how he, what kind of groups and stuff are behind these
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:36.520]  kinds of things.
[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:41.000]  And if he knew if that's what the case was, I mean, let's talk about Chicago itself when
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.520]  we get back, and we'll take a few more calls and let our guests leave us.
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:49.160]  We have another guest coming on, a journalist who were harassed as the TSA who aren't even
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:53.080]  sworn officers are running around groping everyone on the streets in Tampa.
[02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:59.200]  We'll be right back sick of the globalist, you Genesis control freaks, adding poison to
[02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:02.040]  your water and laughing as you get sick and die.
[02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:04.200]  Start purifying your water with pro pure.
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:08.800]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:13.360]  is pro pure and it's available discounted at info wars.com.
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:16.880]  Its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:18.520]  There's no priming required.
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:25.040]  It's NSF 42 certified optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95% easy to set up
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:30.520]  and use doesn't require electricity purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:33.920]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:38.040]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic pro
[02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:40.720]  pure is the best gravity fed filter out there.
[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:45.600]  It's what my family uses info wars.com already has the lowest price on pro pure.
[02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:51.400]  But if you add the promo code water at checkout, you get an additional 10% off and info wars.com.
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:56.240]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:57.400]  Hi this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:57.400 --> 02:06:01.520]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non hybrid seeds and secret storage
[02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:03.160]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:06.840]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:08.160]  silver or gold?
[02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:11.560]  It's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:13.720]  possible that could even happen again.
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:17.880]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non hybrid
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:18.880]  seeds.
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:24.200]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:26.040]  food for you and your family.
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:27.160]  And here's the best part.
[02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:31.360]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:33.840]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:37.080]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:43.960]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:48.440]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:52.960]  Remember in a real crisis, non hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:55.920]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:07:00.360]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:01.760]  half year on record.
[02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:04.760]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:10.400]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:14.400]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:15.400]  food prices.
[02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:20.040]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:23.040]  your own supply of foods from eFoods direct now.
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:26.880]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:28.560]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:32.720]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:35.560]  We know about their delicious long term storeable foods.
[02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:40.080]  The fact is you can eat it any time to save money today and because it stores for 25 years,
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:42.920]  you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:43.920]  Don't wait.
[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:48.800]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:53.400]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:08:23.240]  You can bet your life on eFoods direct.
[02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:28.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us for another hour of worldwide transmission
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:29.240]  against tyranny.
[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:36.600]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and I'm here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:37.600]  Standard Time.
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:41.960]  We're doing just a few more minutes with Larry Grafwald, Army veteran of Vietnam, Airborne
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:47.880]  Ranger, psychologist, weather underground, tried to recruit him, he infiltrated them
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:50.200]  and helped put some of them behind bars.
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:54.720]  We're taking a few calls, a caller was talking about the Obama stage, fast and furious, the
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:58.560]  CBS News is now being forced to report to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:02.320]  People like Larry Pratt have come out and said of each stage, that they stage anything,
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:07.200]  letting nuts out, winding them up to do it, protecting them, but things like the Empire
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:11.280]  State Building shooting, that looks like it was a disgruntled employee shot one person,
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:15.720]  then he got shot and the police shot nine others in the process.
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:21.880]  But what do you make of Chicago and the kind of mafia culture that's up there where they've
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:28.920]  had some days 30 people shot in a night, where you're in a culture where there's victim disarmament
[02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:32.040]  and the law abiding citizens can't own guns?
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:34.840]  Well, what do you expect?
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:41.680]  I mean, you know, back in the day, when my grandfather and grandmother were living on
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:50.040]  a farm in Kentucky, they owned a shotgun and they owned a rifle and you know what, they
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:52.480]  took care of themselves.
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:59.000]  I can't remember of any incidents in their lives that required them to shoot anyone,
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:05.360]  but you know what, all of the bad guys knew that if you were traveling through the countryside
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:09.560]  that all them people in them homes were armed.
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:12.520]  That makes a big difference, doesn't it?
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:20.680]  Suddenly you're dealing with a city like Chicago in New York, where an honest citizen is unarmed.
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:28.880]  That makes an easy victim for someone who has no conscience and is there any doubt in
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:38.760]  our minds that the bad guys are out there and come on, our courts are protecting them?
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:44.440]  All of a sudden, when they get arrested, they had more rights than the victims do.
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:50.120]  You know, the victims' names and everything about the victims can be in the newspaper,
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:54.600]  but you can't even show the face of the perpetrator.
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:57.600]  Why is that?
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:04.560]  Our government has gone too far and it's time for that to change.
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:10.160]  And so when things like what happened in Colorado and what happens in Chicago and what happens
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:15.720]  in Cincinnati, it's my town, it's where I live, it happens every night.
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:21.640]  There was a gunfight in a park a few days ago and two guys got shot in the hand.
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:28.960]  They found two guns, but they weren't sure that there wasn't a third perpetrator.
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:37.760]  Do you understand that, gee, we make up the excuses for them before they do?
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:43.960]  And of course, the immediate liberal response is, we've got to have more gun control.
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:45.800]  Does that make sense?
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:52.720]  You know, if you ask the bad guys, if they're going to walk into a place and try to rob
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:59.200]  it, if they know that there's people in there that have concealed weapons permits, the answer
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:00.200]  is no.
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:04.480]  They're looking for the place where no one's armed.
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:10.880]  And I mean, that's the world that we live in, unarmed, the honest, and armed, the bad
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:11.880]  guys.
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:17.040]  Now, Larry, I want to take just a few final calls here before we go to our next guest
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:18.880]  and look at what the TSA is doing.
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:23.720]  But see, you're a nice guy, so you look at this and, you know, just look at it as it's
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:24.720]  being presented.
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:30.320]  But the globalists know how to put nonviolent offenders in jail and keep them there because
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:35.600]  they, you know, they're good prison labor for 25 cents an hour, driving down wages and
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:37.880]  making big profits for private prisons.
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:42.440]  But then they let out, they have actuaries where they release the violent offenders to
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:46.480]  menace the public so we beg for a bigger police state.
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:50.560]  It's a Gaelian dialectic, a problem reaction solution.
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:53.880]  The system knows this, and so that's what they're doing.
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:59.840]  The system wants to gobble up nonviolent people and people for petty things while releasing
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:04.320]  the serious criminals, and that's because we have criminals in government.
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:12.440]  Well, I think that if you look at the quote unquote war on drugs, you'll find a perfect
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:16.160]  example of what you're talking about.
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:17.920]  Tell me something.
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:26.640]  How much would it cost for us, the U.S. government, to go to Columbia and buy every acre of land
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:30.200]  and pay them farmers to raise corn?
[02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:34.080]  And all of a sudden the cocoa leaves go away.
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:41.560]  But if you, if you do that, you simply crush a vested interest group, don't you?
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:50.080]  Courages, prisons, prison guards, attorneys, politicians, I mean it just goes on endlessly,
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:51.240]  doesn't it?
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:57.200]  And that's what justifies the hundreds of billions of dollars that go into the war
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:06.280]  on drugs, which if anybody has looked recently, we're losing.
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:07.280]  You're right.
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:09.360]  It's just the total corruption of society.
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:13.280]  Adam in Canada, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:14.280]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:16.120]  Honored to talk to you, my friend.
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:17.280]  Nice talk to you.
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:18.280]  Yeah.
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:22.640]  You, Larry as well, you two really are doing the work of a million men, sometimes I don't
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:23.640]  know.
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:24.640]  Well, look, we're just trying to survive.
[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:27.000]  Let me tell you, these people take over.
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.400]  I mean, let me tell you, we're going to be slaves.
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:31.320]  I mean, there's nowhere to run.
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:32.800]  This is a global system.
[02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:36.200]  This is like linen or skull in our mouth trying to take over, okay?
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:40.760]  Because they get away with this, which happens, you know, most of the time in history, you
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:41.760]  get tyrants.
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:46.480]  Listen, we're in a world of hurt, brother, so the people that say, oh, we're such heroes
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:50.280]  or we're great guys, let me tell you, the reason I get upset about that, I'm not mad
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:51.280]  at your caller.
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:55.400]  I'm not mad at you, Adam, is because people see it as heroic to speak out against a bunch
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:56.400]  of criminals.
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:58.760]  Listen, these people are dangerous, folks.
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:14:59.760]  I'm sorry.
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:00.760]  Go ahead.
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:01.760]  Well, and it's the truth.
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:03.240]  I have to throw that in.
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:04.240]  Go ahead.
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:11.320]  Alex, what I want to talk to you about is being Canadian.
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:21.040]  Our gun laws up here, it's just so crazy to me compared to what is happening in the States
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:22.040]  right now.
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:29.080]  I mean, I'm comparing it to gun grabbers as opposed to gun givers up here.
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:36.960]  It's like they're promoting, you know, when you turn 18, go do the gun licensing, go do
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:41.960]  the hunting course, and like, it's weird, man.
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:42.960]  What is going on?
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:45.200]  Like, I just wondered if you could maybe shed some light.
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:46.880]  Look, it's very simple.
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:52.320]  There are powerful interests in mega corporations that are monopoly people, and they've got all
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:57.080]  sorts of dependents and people in government and corporations below them that want more
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:01.440]  power, and the quickest way to do that is to mandate you by health care, is to mandate
[02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:05.720]  you do this and that, and they don't want you to have the power to defend yourself.
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:09.760]  They want to make you dependent on them to protect you, so then they can nanny state
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:12.760]  you on top of it, just like Larry said earlier.
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:17.720]  They want you to not have food, water, and guns when they collapse things, so you've
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:18.960]  got to go hat in hand.
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:24.840]  That's why they advertise, get on welfare, get on food stamps, even if you have a job.
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:26.320]  They want you dependent.
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:27.920]  It's called domestication.
[02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:28.920]  Great question.
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:31.520]  Larry, comments on that?
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:40.480]  I couldn't agree with you more, and I think that if I understood that Canada is requiring
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:46.880]  people or asking people, motivating people to become familiar with firearms and to purchase
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:50.840]  firearms, then I advocate that.
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:54.560]  That is what our founding fathers believed in.
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:17:02.240]  Listen, when the Second Amendment was added to the Constitution, it wasn't because we
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:05.840]  were fighting Indians or we were shooting rabbits.
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:12.880]  It was because this country had fought a war of liberation against the greatest power in
[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:14.120]  the world.
[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:22.360]  That was England, and we had won, and we did that because we had a civilian militia, and
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:29.000]  that's what protects us every day of every year, and that includes Canada.
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.560]  It includes the United States.
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:37.280]  Remember one thing, if they decide that they're going to kick your door in, the first question
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:41.880]  is going to be, does that guy have a gun?
[02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:48.840]  They're going to look to see if you have a registered firearm, and if you do, here comes
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:51.640]  the SWAT people.
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:58.520]  All of a sudden, you're a lot more of a threat than you are if they believe that you're totally
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:17:59.520]  unarmed.
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:04.360]  Exactly, but the good news is people are buying guns everywhere that came in because
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:10.960]  people understand that the rubber meets the road individually, and we don't want to end
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:13.880]  up like New York or Chicago.
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:16.640]  Larry Grathwald, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:19.240]  Give people your website one more time.
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:25.840]  Larry101ST.blogspot.com.
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:33.200]  I'm asking for donations that I can follow Mr. Ayres around and question him when he gives
[02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:39.680]  his speeches, and you know, Alex, that might be something that you want to think about.
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:48.800]  Wouldn't that be a great video, me confronting Bill Ayres, and listen, I'd love to do it
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:52.200]  if I could find somebody to set it up for me.
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:54.480]  Sure, people should contact you.
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:58.840]  You can track where he's going to be speaking, being worshipped by lots of little rich trust
[02:18:58.840 --> 02:18:59.840]  fund kids.
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:01.200]  I know where he is.
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:02.720]  I know where he's going.
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:04.080]  Well, we have listeners everywhere.
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:09.640]  They should contact you, and everywhere he goes, he should be confronted in public places.
[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:10.640]  Absolutely.
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:17.920]  And I mean, not just by you, everybody should do it because he is a real piece of trash.
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:24.120]  I thank you for having me on your show, and I appreciate everything, and God bless you,
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:25.120]  and God bless America.
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:26.120]  All right.
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:27.120]  Thank you.
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:28.400]  I'm absolutely second to that.
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:29.400]  Larry Graf.
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:30.400]  Well, there he goes.
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:33.200]  We're going to come back and delve into the nightmare TSA activities.
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:36.000]  They are very busy little beavers.
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:41.760]  The Houston Free Thinkers, detained by DHS at the RNC, TSA takes over bus stations and
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:46.560]  Tampa DHS agents, threatened journalists, but not just that, Ron Paul.
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:52.360]  They came after him, and said he might have a bomb or something, he might be a threat
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:53.360]  to Romney.
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:56.480]  Can't make this up, TSA harasses Ron Paul.
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:20:00.920]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest
[02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:02.160]  half year on record.
[02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:05.240]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:10.080]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising
[02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:11.080]  prices.
[02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:14.960]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:15.960]  food prices.
[02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:20.600]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting
[02:20:20.600 --> 02:20:23.600]  your own supply of foods from Eat Foods Direct now.
[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:27.480]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, Eat Foods will have to raise prices too.
[02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:29.120]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:33.280]  I recently increased my supply from Eat Foods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:35.840]  You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:39.760]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today, and because it's storage for
[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:43.400]  25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:49.440]  Don't wait, call 800-409-5633 or go to EatFoodsDirect.com or slash Alex.

[02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:59.160]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:00.160]  Box.
[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:03.080]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:07.880]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White
[02:23:07.880 --> 02:23:12.080]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:17.400]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:23:17.400 --> 02:23:22.840]  Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:28.000]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.000]  normal cell.

[02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:53.160]  Protect your immune system.
[02:23:53.160 --> 02:24:22.160]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:29.160]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:57.880]  Right now, we're also going to get an update from what's happening with the hurricane with
[02:24:57.880 --> 02:25:00.240]  folks there on the ground.
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:04.840]  But we're also going to break this down after the next break, TSA harasses Ron Paul and
[02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:05.840]  his wife in Florida.
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:10.240]  A big article, Kurt Nemo did, just amazing to see what they're up to.
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:11.240]  We'll tell you about that.
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:17.840]  But here it is, the TSA now on the streets running around wanting to search people.
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:23.240]  So you're not getting away from people that aren't even police, and the police setting
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:27.840]  up checkpoints as illegal and evil and horrible and dangerous and a threat to freedom.
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:35.960]  But now it's the TSA, and going after journalists, we heard Julio, we had on up in Chicago, filmed
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:36.960]  them running checkpoints.
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:41.400]  A week later, they ran over to him in a restaurant and got in his face and said, you don't tape
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:42.400]  us, boy.
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:45.920]  I mean, this is North Korea if they have their way.
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:50.840]  So going to Derek, Derek, tell us what happened to you, tell us what you're seeing there at
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:51.840]  the RNC.
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:55.840]  Yeah, thank you for having us on, Alex.
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:26:00.360]  So we've been out here, me, Micah, and our cameraman Cody, we've been out here documenting
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:05.520]  the protests, the counter protests, the RNC, and also talking to delegates inside and just
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:07.800]  videotaping the police state.
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:10.920]  We had finished documenting some protests that were happening, so we decided to go walk
[02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:13.800]  around and just do a perimeter check.
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:17.800]  And we were walking through the city, we were actually miles away from the Tampa Bay Times
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:20.160]  Forum itself where the RNC is being held.
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:24.560]  And we just happened to walk up to a Greyhound station, and we noticed a sign on the outside
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:29.800]  that said TSA screening notice, and it notified everybody that they would be going through
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:32.760]  there, that they would be searched by the TSA.
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:35.640]  So we started to film our live stream and to videotape.
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:39.800]  We opened the doors, and you can see on the video, we show there's four or five TSA agents
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:47.520]  and local cops as well in there waiting to search people who choose to ride the Greyhound.
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:53.720]  After that we decided to go look around a little more because Micah noticed that a DHS
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:56.760]  Federal Protective Service car that was parked on the block right there where the Greyhound
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:01.080]  station was, he'd stuck his hand out and took pictures of us with his phone.
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:05.560]  So we wanted to get a closer look, and we decided to go across the street, and when
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:10.240]  we did so, we started walking on the side of the first DHS car and taking pictures of
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:15.600]  the license plate, and two more SUVs pulled up and cornered us and stopped us right there,
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:19.240]  and they immediately started demanding papers from us asking us for identification.
[02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:23.080]  Yeah, because if you're trying to aim cameras at the cops, you must be bad.
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:25.160]  They teach them this in these training videos.
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:29.840]  They teach them that journalistic activity is terrorist activity, and it's just pure
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:33.640]  intimidation, and it's having the opposite effect of what they'd wish.
[02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:35.400]  It's so ridiculous.
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:39.400]  And I've had cops come a hundred yards over to me and say, turn that camera off, and I'm
[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:45.440]  just like, no, and it's just, they are totally helping destroy this country when they act
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:46.440]  like this.
[02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:50.560]  Yeah, that's exactly right, Alex.
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:53.280]  We tried to reach out to them to talk to them and let them know.
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:55.920]  I was telling them, I don't agree with you.
[02:27:55.920 --> 02:27:59.800]  We've talked to you before about we don't carry ID on us, and we exercise that right
[02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:00.800]  not to.
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:01.800]  They demanded papers.
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:04.280]  We told them we didn't want to give them any papers.
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:07.720]  We offered our names and our birth dates, but they said they didn't want anything from
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:11.360]  us other than identification, and that they were federal officers, and they could detain
[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:13.800]  us for 72 hours if we didn't show them papers.
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:18.440]  They just absolutely love the power trip as they sit there acting like you're terrorists
[02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:21.520]  because you want to videotape TSA down the street, continue.
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:24.240]  But hey, you guys got TSA kicked out of Houston.
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:26.240]  They're big rollouts, so you've got the power.
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:27.240]  That's what they know.
[02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:28.240]  Go ahead.
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:29.240]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:32.040]  That's why we were filming the TSA there, because that's the big issue for them, and
[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:35.240]  we want to reach out to whoever's active in Tampa and let them know that you can't get
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:37.360]  rid of the TSA and the Greyhound and the Metro and such.
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:40.280]  Yeah, they don't want people knowing and seeing what's happening.
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:44.200]  They want to roll it out before we know because we're seen as an enemy, and you don't want
[02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:45.520]  your enemy knowing what you're doing.
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:46.520]  Go ahead.
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:53.960]  Certainly not, Alex, and so the other vehicles pulling up on us demanded papers.
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:29:02.640]  We said that we did not want to give them, but with 72 hours of detention, I gave my
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:06.520]  license and we stated on film that we were doing it under duress, and we asked them for
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:09.560]  their identity, and they wouldn't give us their badge numbers.
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:10.560]  Yeah, the secret police.
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:11.560]  Yeah.
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:12.560]  Well, don't worry.
[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:16.480]  The foreign banks will take their bank accounts, and they won't get the ID on that either.
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:19.040]  Their kids will get cancer, too, from the fluoride, but they don't care.
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:20.040]  Go ahead.
[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:23.080]  No, they don't care, as was evident in the video.
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:25.320]  But listen, they're going to get what they want.
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:27.920]  These are just mindless fools of the system.
[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:28.920]  Stay there.
[02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:29.920]  We're going to come back and talk about it.
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:31.160]  I mean, they want to live in North Korea.
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:36.160]  They want to live in Mexico, and they will get what they want because, you know, when
[02:29:36.160 --> 02:29:40.320]  the protections of the Bill of Rights and Constitution are gone, everything's gone,
[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:45.760]  but right now they're just having fun being the boss.
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:47.040]  We're on the march.
[02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:57.000]  The Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:00.280]  Supernatural silver is not an ionic or a colloidal silver.
[02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:05.080]  It is a nano-catalytic silver-sol technology with superior benefits to the colloidal silvers
[02:30:05.080 --> 02:30:06.080]  of yesterday.
[02:30:06.080 --> 02:30:09.280]  This new molecular structure is permanently bonded to water.
[02:30:09.280 --> 02:30:14.720]  It is the only water-soluble silver that is 99 percent bioavailable and non-toxic,
[02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:16.600]  with no known side effects.
[02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:21.000]  Watersoluble silver's patented technology has advanced antibacterial, antiviral and
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.840]  antifungal properties with a 15-year shelf-life.
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:28.840]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is one of the most important items needed
[02:30:28.840 --> 02:30:30.600]  in any emergency.
[02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:35.780]  Independent testing from universities, hospitals, military and private labs make this the most
[02:30:35.780 --> 02:30:37.360]  proven product in the industry.
[02:30:37.360 --> 02:30:40.520]  No silver solution is better or safer.
[02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:42.780]  Protect yourself and your loved ones and be prepared.

[02:33:01.180 --> 02:33:07.180]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:07.180 --> 02:33:10.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:39.180]  Go to www.supernaturalsilver.com today.
[02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:45.180]  Alright, we're talking to some folks from the Houston Free Thinkers.
[02:33:45.180 --> 02:33:47.180]  You know, they're evil Americans.
[02:33:47.180 --> 02:33:53.180]  They had highway checkpoints out on the street at the little bus stops at the bus terminals.
[02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:57.180]  TSA was searching people. TSA was trying to search bags.
[02:33:57.180 --> 02:34:02.180]  And, you know, like evil Americans that didn't want to live in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia.
[02:34:02.180 --> 02:34:05.180]  You know, like movies like Red Dawn, the bad guys have checkpoints and do that.
[02:34:05.180 --> 02:34:07.180]  They're like, hey, we don't want this.
[02:34:07.180 --> 02:34:10.180]  You're out of your jurisdiction. You're violating the Fourth and Tenth Amendment.
[02:34:10.180 --> 02:34:11.180]  Get out of here.
[02:34:11.180 --> 02:34:13.180]  And the city for now has backed off.
[02:34:13.180 --> 02:34:19.180]  But these evil Americans traveled to where the puppets were meeting.
[02:34:19.180 --> 02:34:20.180]  They're in Tampa.
[02:34:20.180 --> 02:34:26.180]  And I've seen other journalists just trying to film or even citizens just out filming the hurricane at the beach.
[02:34:26.180 --> 02:34:27.180]  And cops come up.
[02:34:27.180 --> 02:34:28.180]  What are you doing filming?
[02:34:28.180 --> 02:34:29.180]  Again, we're going to film you.
[02:34:29.180 --> 02:34:34.180]  We're going to have the NSA wiretap you without warrants for your safety while we ship narcotics in, of course.
[02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:41.180]  But if you dare, if you dare, you know, try to film the TSA.
[02:34:41.180 --> 02:34:42.180]  Oh, no, sir.
[02:34:42.180 --> 02:34:45.180]  Again, they've been told go after journalists.
[02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:47.180]  Go after journalists.
[02:34:47.180 --> 02:34:48.180]  They're afraid of it.
[02:34:48.180 --> 02:34:50.180]  They know what's happening.
[02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:59.180]  I mean, I've got two new videos of police body slamming women, kicking men in the throat for no reason other than the fact they got into the job because they're sadist.
[02:34:59.180 --> 02:35:04.180]  And again, police need to kick these bad cops out. The problem is from on top.
[02:35:04.180 --> 02:35:08.180]  We got a federal government that staged Oklahoma City and 9-11.
[02:35:08.180 --> 02:35:10.180]  We got a federal government that's illegitimate.
[02:35:10.180 --> 02:35:14.180]  We got a federal government that ships on narcotics and has been caught and staged fast and furious.
[02:35:14.180 --> 02:35:18.180]  And so these arrogant guys just, they have such satisfaction.
[02:35:18.180 --> 02:35:19.180]  They're not scared of these guys.
[02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:28.180]  They know these are reporters and they just got satisfied looks on their faces and their black uniforms, hands in their belts.
[02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:32.180]  I can disappear you if I want.
[02:35:32.180 --> 02:35:43.180]  Why the bankers are going, we're going to devalue your dollar and got your country and you're drinking fluoride is going to kill you.
[02:35:43.180 --> 02:35:49.180]  Hey, those up above you, they are, they agree with you, but you have no idea.
[02:35:49.180 --> 02:35:51.180]  You know, you're not really evil.
[02:35:51.180 --> 02:35:55.180]  You're just thugs, you're bullies, you're goons, you're jokes, you're nobody.
[02:35:55.180 --> 02:35:58.180]  You come from a bad family, your daddy acted like you.
[02:35:58.180 --> 02:35:59.180]  Your granddaddy did.
[02:35:59.180 --> 02:36:00.180]  You were trash.
[02:36:00.180 --> 02:36:01.180]  You weren't successful.
[02:36:01.180 --> 02:36:02.180]  We get it.
[02:36:02.180 --> 02:36:03.180]  You're not winners.
[02:36:03.180 --> 02:36:04.180]  We got your number.
[02:36:04.180 --> 02:36:05.180]  We know who you are.
[02:36:05.180 --> 02:36:06.180]  You're called tyrants.
[02:36:06.180 --> 02:36:07.180]  You're called suckups.
[02:36:07.180 --> 02:36:08.180]  I'm sorry.
[02:36:08.180 --> 02:36:13.180]  If you're not threatened by this type of activity to journalists, you want to move to North Korea.
[02:36:13.180 --> 02:36:16.180]  You want to move to China, communist China.
[02:36:16.180 --> 02:36:18.180]  You want, you like tyranny.
[02:36:18.180 --> 02:36:19.180]  Get out of my country.
[02:36:19.180 --> 02:36:20.180]  Get out of my country.
[02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:25.180]  Let's go back to the evil American scum, Eric Rose and crew.
[02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:28.180]  So continue with what they did to you.
[02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:29.180]  Yeah.
[02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:33.180]  So Alex, we, um, they started demanding ID from us.
[02:36:33.180 --> 02:36:35.180]  As we said before, Micah gave his ID.
[02:36:35.180 --> 02:36:37.180]  I don't even carry ID with me.
[02:36:37.180 --> 02:36:39.180]  I just happened to have my birth certificate with me.
[02:36:39.180 --> 02:36:44.180]  And after, you know, them demanding it from us and threatening 72 hours of detainment,
[02:36:44.180 --> 02:36:48.180]  I relented and we said on our live stream, you know, Micah said, like Micah said, we're
[02:36:48.180 --> 02:36:50.180]  doing this under threats from them.
[02:36:50.180 --> 02:36:53.180]  So we gave them my birth certificate and Micah's ID.
[02:36:53.180 --> 02:36:57.180]  And while they were running our information, they were taking pictures of us and just asking
[02:36:57.180 --> 02:36:58.180]  questions.
[02:36:58.180 --> 02:37:01.180]  Yeah, putting you in a pickup list database like they do everybody now.
[02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:04.180]  I think you've got two wireless devices going too close to each other.
[02:37:04.180 --> 02:37:05.180]  There's a buzzing.
[02:37:05.180 --> 02:37:09.180]  You might move your equipment apart a little bit so we can get your audio clear.
[02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:10.180]  Thank you.
[02:37:10.180 --> 02:37:11.180]  Yeah.
[02:37:11.180 --> 02:37:12.180]  We got that right there.
[02:37:12.180 --> 02:37:13.180]  Yeah.
[02:37:13.180 --> 02:37:15.180]  So we, we, um, started trying to talk to them.
[02:37:15.180 --> 02:37:16.180]  We talked to them.
[02:37:16.180 --> 02:37:19.180]  I told them, I respect you as human beings, but we don't respect what you're doing.
[02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:20.180]  You're violating our rights.
[02:37:20.180 --> 02:37:25.180]  You know, we, uh, we're just walking around filming, filming the fence, the perimeter fence
[02:37:25.180 --> 02:37:26.180]  that they had there.
[02:37:26.180 --> 02:37:31.180]  And they declared that, uh, that it was federal property that we were, we were filming federal
[02:37:31.180 --> 02:37:32.180]  property.
[02:37:32.180 --> 02:37:36.180]  And we stepped onto the street off the fence and they said that, that the entire state
[02:37:36.180 --> 02:37:39.180]  of Florida was essentially federal property.
[02:37:39.180 --> 02:37:40.180]  Yeah.
[02:37:40.180 --> 02:37:44.180]  Like, like Derek just said, we asked them, you know, where the property was, but it just
[02:37:44.180 --> 02:37:46.180]  this parking garage that was behind us.
[02:37:46.180 --> 02:37:48.180]  And they said, where do you pay your taxes to?
[02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:52.180]  And he answers himself and saying, uh, the federal and the state government, right?
[02:37:52.180 --> 02:37:57.180]  And these streets, as soon as you came into Florida, you came on a federal property and
[02:37:57.180 --> 02:38:01.180]  then he goes ahead and once they, uh, finished a field interview with me and they're telling
[02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:06.180]  me I can go ahead and leave, uh, um, they tell me to leave the property.
[02:38:06.180 --> 02:38:10.180]  And I'm kind of curious, you know, where that, is that the boundary of the state of Florida?
[02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:14.180]  But, you know, I wasn't going to walk off and leave because we had another incident where
[02:38:14.180 --> 02:38:18.180]  they wanted to, uh, further violate important amendment rights by searching Eric's back.
[02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:20.180]  And I stood there and filmed that.
[02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:21.180]  Uh,
[02:38:21.180 --> 02:38:26.180]  Listen, I want to talk to you guys further, but either your alternator running is throwing
[02:38:26.180 --> 02:38:31.180]  RF into the transmission or you've got another audio, another video stream going right by
[02:38:31.180 --> 02:38:33.180]  your other wireless system.
[02:38:33.180 --> 02:38:37.180]  I saw you move something back and it went away, but whoever is doing it stuck it back in there.
[02:38:37.180 --> 02:38:38.180]  We'll just do this on air here.
[02:38:38.180 --> 02:38:43.180]  Can you guys like move the RF generators away from each other?
[02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:45.180]  Yeah, we'll make sure we've got everything.
[02:38:45.180 --> 02:38:49.180]  Yeah, whatever, whoever did that just, whatever just happened made your transmission clear.
[02:38:49.180 --> 02:38:50.180]  I want to be able to hear from you.
[02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:54.180]  So what else is happening there in Tampa?
[02:38:54.180 --> 02:38:59.180]  Well, there's, there's, as everybody's been reporting the cops outnumber the protesters
[02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:01.180]  probably more than 20 to one.
[02:39:01.180 --> 02:39:06.180]  I think what happened in 2008, the RNC with Brandon Darby and, uh, the federal entrapment
[02:39:06.180 --> 02:39:10.180]  of protesters and the threats of anarchists and IEDs and all these different DHS threats
[02:39:10.180 --> 02:39:12.180]  that scared off a lot of people.
[02:39:12.180 --> 02:39:13.180]  The numbers just aren't here.
[02:39:13.180 --> 02:39:18.180]  There's really sadly to say not a lot of people here to protest the Republican party and those
[02:39:18.180 --> 02:39:21.180]  who are here are also calling for Obama as the solution.
[02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:22.180]  Well, that's right.
[02:39:22.180 --> 02:39:26.180]  And that's why there's no protests in North Korea is because they arrest you and harass
[02:39:26.180 --> 02:39:27.180]  you if you do.
[02:39:27.180 --> 02:39:32.180]  And this is the intention of hiring provocateurs to throw bottles from the back so they can
[02:39:32.180 --> 02:39:35.180]  attack protesters in Seattle when the numbers were 80,000.
[02:39:35.180 --> 02:39:37.180]  The next protest are 50,000.
[02:39:37.180 --> 02:39:45.180]  The next protest are 20,000, 10,000, 5,000, 1,500 that they have their destroying freedom
[02:39:45.180 --> 02:39:47.180]  nationwide scientifically.
[02:39:47.180 --> 02:39:49.180]  And I hope they enjoy what they've done for their children.
[02:39:49.180 --> 02:39:51.180]  It is social engineering.
[02:39:51.180 --> 02:39:58.180]  And so I guess the only people they're protesting you're saying are Obama, Obama.
[02:39:58.180 --> 02:40:01.180]  There's definitely some Obama supporters.
[02:40:01.180 --> 02:40:05.180]  There's a few people we spoke to who see past the two-party system.
[02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:09.180]  We've been making sure to go to every protest, every action we can, and we're hearing people
[02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:11.180]  call for Obama or Romney.
[02:40:11.180 --> 02:40:16.180]  We're going around screaming no, Obama, you know, get rid of the two-party system, break
[02:40:16.180 --> 02:40:20.180]  your chains both right and left, trying to get people to think past the two-party paradigm.
[02:40:20.180 --> 02:40:24.180]  And that's been our main job here is to document everything and to bring awareness to the people
[02:40:24.180 --> 02:40:28.180]  who maybe see that the Republicans are screwing us over, but the Democrats are part of it
[02:40:28.180 --> 02:40:31.180]  as well and just trying to get them to look past the whole system and to look to the community
[02:40:31.180 --> 02:40:33.180]  for more solutions.
[02:40:33.180 --> 02:40:36.180]  So what did these federal goons have to say to you?
[02:40:36.180 --> 02:40:38.180]  I mean, any other little points?
[02:40:38.180 --> 02:40:43.180]  I mean, they look really satisfied like they are enjoying frustrating the First Amendment
[02:40:43.180 --> 02:40:45.180]  with extreme relish.
[02:40:45.180 --> 02:40:49.180]  Yeah, so as Micah said, they started asking to go through my bag.
[02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:51.180]  They asked if they could go through there.
[02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:54.180]  And we went back and forth for a few minutes because I told them if you're going to search
[02:40:54.180 --> 02:40:59.180]  my bag anyways, just go ahead and do it, you know, and they said they wanted permission
[02:40:59.180 --> 02:41:03.180]  and I told them no, that I didn't have anything to hide, but I was exercising my Fourth Amendment
[02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:05.180]  and I didn't want them to go through my bag.
[02:41:05.180 --> 02:41:10.180]  So we did that for a few minutes and also our cameraman, Cody, he was filming from across the street
[02:41:10.180 --> 02:41:15.180]  and he came up upon the incident and tried to film that as well.
[02:41:15.180 --> 02:41:20.180]  Yeah, when I came closer, I was actually with Al Jazeer as well and an NBC representative
[02:41:20.180 --> 02:41:25.180]  and we tried to get closer to see what was happening and we were quickly told to get away
[02:41:25.180 --> 02:41:29.180]  that we were on federal property and if we did not, you know, remove ourselves, we would be detained as well.
[02:41:29.180 --> 02:41:30.180]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:41:30.180 --> 02:41:34.180]  Wherever they set up these little police states now, everything is a federal event
[02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:39.180]  and then they claim it'll be trespassing to get near their lordships.
[02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:40.180]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:40.180 --> 02:41:46.180]  I mean, they had perimeter fences set up all around the city, cops everywhere, bike cops, the Ninja Turtle gear
[02:41:46.180 --> 02:41:52.180]  and that we're miles away from the RNC itself, but they're just using it as an excuse to set up this control grid.
[02:41:52.180 --> 02:41:56.180]  And remember, they represent the foreign banks that run the country and brag they've conquered us
[02:41:56.180 --> 02:42:00.180]  who publicly launder the drug money and ship the narcotics in.
[02:42:00.180 --> 02:42:02.180]  So that's why they're so tyrannical.
[02:42:02.180 --> 02:42:08.180]  They work for big banks that are so evil, drugs aren't enough, they run child kidnapping rings.
[02:42:08.180 --> 02:42:11.180]  I mean, let's just remember how evil this government is.
[02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:17.180]  Yeah, I did want to point out something that I just recalled Alex that right after this incident happened,
[02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:21.180]  we stopped at a cafe on the corner and the Al Jazeera reporters were there
[02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:24.180]  and we went into this restaurant that was attached to the Greyhound station
[02:42:24.180 --> 02:42:29.180]  and they notified us that there was a protester, supposedly a protester,
[02:42:29.180 --> 02:42:34.180]  that they saw come out of the gates from behind the perimeter where the cops are
[02:42:34.180 --> 02:42:37.180]  and where all the DHS and everything was and he was inside there.
[02:42:37.180 --> 02:42:41.180]  He was wearing a yellow resist RNC shirt dressed up like a protester.
[02:42:41.180 --> 02:42:44.180]  It was two guys and so we went back inside and took pictures of them.
[02:42:44.180 --> 02:42:49.180]  So it seemed like they might be using fake protesters' informants just like we know they do.
[02:42:49.180 --> 02:42:55.180]  No, no, no. They're dressing informants up with vulgar signs dressed up like sexual organs.
[02:42:55.180 --> 02:43:00.180]  It's classic operations. I've caught police commanding the fake anarchists before.
[02:43:00.180 --> 02:43:02.180]  I mean, they've been caught all over the world doing this.
[02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:08.180]  Yeah, they have synthetic protesters for the media to demonize their enemy freedom.
[02:43:08.180 --> 02:43:11.180]  First Amendment.
[02:43:11.180 --> 02:43:14.180]  Definitely. We just were out there to document everything, Alex.
[02:43:14.180 --> 02:43:19.180]  After being questioned and harassed, they let us go and they basically just threatened us
[02:43:19.180 --> 02:43:22.180]  and told us that anything that we film around there we could be stopped for
[02:43:22.180 --> 02:43:25.180]  and if we don't show ID, we're going to be immediately detained
[02:43:25.180 --> 02:43:28.180]  and we've just been doing our best to get this word out because as far as we can see,
[02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:33.180]  besides the police state, there doesn't seem to have been too many more beat downs
[02:43:33.180 --> 02:43:37.180]  but as you said, they've scared off a lot of protesters by entrapping.
[02:43:37.180 --> 02:43:45.180]  Well, they've used dark info war or black propaganda against everybody
[02:43:45.180 --> 02:43:50.180]  and so hey, the banks are now free to destroy the country and destroy their pension funds and they will.
[02:43:50.180 --> 02:43:55.180]  And so all those cops are going to end up living in total squalor losing their whole future
[02:43:55.180 --> 02:43:58.180]  but they won't care. They'll still have uniforms.
[02:43:58.180 --> 02:44:02.180]  So hey, everything they want, they're now going to get from their mama government.
[02:44:02.180 --> 02:44:07.180]  They're very close to releasing all the hell that they planned for us for so long.
[02:44:07.180 --> 02:44:10.180]  Now, I want to get to this article but first I want to get your take on it
[02:44:10.180 --> 02:44:11.180]  and any other points you want to make here.
[02:44:11.180 --> 02:44:18.180]  TSA harasses Ron Paul and his wife in Florida on departing the RNC in Tampa yesterday.
[02:44:18.180 --> 02:44:22.180]  Ron Paul, his wife and granddaughter were subjected to harassment by the TSA
[02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:25.180]  at a small airport in Clearwater, Florida.
[02:44:25.180 --> 02:44:31.180]  Eight TSA goons, this is like 30, 40 miles away from the other Tampa airport,
[02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:36.180]  told the Paul entourage they would need to be screened before they could be allowed to leave
[02:44:36.180 --> 02:44:40.180]  because Mitt Romney might be nearby, which he wasn't, but it's Mitt Romney's nearby.
[02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:44.180]  He's 40 miles away from his lordship.
[02:44:44.180 --> 02:44:49.180]  The insinuation was obvious. All in his family pose a threat to the GOP presidential candidate.
[02:44:49.180 --> 02:44:53.180]  After a protracted examination of Ron Paul's credentials,
[02:44:53.180 --> 02:44:57.180]  the agents demanded they'd be allowed to check the plane for explosives.
[02:44:57.180 --> 02:45:02.180]  They're now boarding private planes. They want to shut down private aviation.
[02:45:02.180 --> 02:45:08.180]  Where you got your little sesson out there? It's over. They run things now.
[02:45:08.180 --> 02:45:11.180]  I'm going to go back to you here in just a moment.
[02:45:11.180 --> 02:45:17.180]  The incident ended after Ron Paul's wife, Carol, who had a pacemaker refuse to be screened by the TSA
[02:45:17.180 --> 02:45:21.180]  and an aide started taking video. Oh, that terrorist thing.
[02:45:21.180 --> 02:45:27.180]  The disgraceful incident serves as a vicious parting shot by the establishment.
[02:45:27.180 --> 02:45:32.180]  The GOP has constantly sabotaged Paul's campaign and the corporate media has either ignored the candidate
[02:45:32.180 --> 02:45:36.180]  or portrayed him as a radical that had absolutely no chance of winning the nomination
[02:45:36.180 --> 02:45:39.180]  despite the huge and unprecedented following and popularity of the American people.
[02:45:39.180 --> 02:45:43.180]  In March, we posted details from a report by investigative journalists
[02:45:43.180 --> 02:45:47.180]  who discovered documents by GOP insiders to sabotage Paul's campaign
[02:45:47.180 --> 02:45:51.180]  and thwart his supporters in the primaries during the convention.
[02:45:51.180 --> 02:45:56.180]  The establishment media worked in concert with the GOP to refuse to report on Paul.
[02:45:56.180 --> 02:46:01.180]  Had won the five state minimum required to be on the ballot, the nomination of the Republican convention.
[02:46:01.180 --> 02:46:04.180]  He should have ran third party and spoiled it all for him.
[02:46:04.180 --> 02:46:08.180]  He got a lot more attention than his son getting a speaking slot at the whoop-de-doo RNC
[02:46:08.180 --> 02:46:13.180]  with a bunch of corpses, a bunch of self-propelled stomachs
[02:46:13.180 --> 02:46:17.180]  and living dead mindless fake neocons that think that the Republicans are going to save them.
[02:46:17.180 --> 02:46:21.180]  What a joke. In addition to revealing the links of the establishment
[02:46:21.180 --> 02:46:27.180]  and its lapdog media will go to, to harass this credit, a candidate they consider dangerously unacceptable.
[02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:33.180]  The incident underscores the determination of the total sexual assault unit known as TSA
[02:46:33.180 --> 02:46:36.180]  to move into smaller airports despite an effort earlier this year
[02:46:36.180 --> 02:46:40.180]  by Republican lawmakers to expedite the implementation of a program
[02:46:40.180 --> 02:46:43.180]  that would allow airports to opt out of the federal screening.
[02:46:43.180 --> 02:46:48.180]  Ron Paul's son, Rand Paul, and Senator from Kentucky was detained last year by the TSA
[02:46:48.180 --> 02:46:52.180]  and Nashville following the incident, ran issued a press release, and it just goes on.
[02:46:52.180 --> 02:46:57.180]  Ron Paul has told us on this show as a link to it that he was also molested by the TSA
[02:46:57.180 --> 02:46:59.180]  and it just goes on to break it all down.
[02:46:59.180 --> 02:47:02.180]  What do you guys make of that now?
[02:47:02.180 --> 02:47:06.180]  We've got to search you for explosives Mitt Romney may be nearby
[02:47:06.180 --> 02:47:11.180]  in Clearwater Airport, 35, 40 miles away.
[02:47:11.180 --> 02:47:16.180]  This is deplorable. It sounds like just a tactic to harass Dr. Paul
[02:47:16.180 --> 02:47:19.180]  and make his, you know, day a little bit more cumbersome.
[02:47:19.180 --> 02:47:22.180]  And I think it's ridiculous they're not going to search Mitt Romney
[02:47:22.180 --> 02:47:26.180]  to make sure that he's not trying to cheat Dr. Paul out of his due winnings or something.
[02:47:26.180 --> 02:47:30.180]  Well, I mean, Mitt Romney's got his money offshore, pays almost no taxes,
[02:47:30.180 --> 02:47:35.180]  but he's lower level. He only pays 17% when middle class pays around 40.
[02:47:35.180 --> 02:47:39.180]  And so, you know, the real elites pay zero tax.
[02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:43.180]  So someday Mitt Romney will be at that level.
[02:47:43.180 --> 02:47:47.180]  Yeah, he hopes to be, but I think that most of us realize that Mitt Romney's just another puppet
[02:47:47.180 --> 02:47:51.180]  and he's a useful idiot. He's being used.
[02:47:51.180 --> 02:47:55.180]  So I think he's being used to bring Obama in so that Obama can seal the deal
[02:47:55.180 --> 02:47:58.180]  in the next four years, like you said, and bring in whatever their plan is.
[02:47:58.180 --> 02:48:02.180]  But the TSA searching Ron Paul, we saw the TSA on the streets.
[02:48:02.180 --> 02:48:06.180]  We saw the TSA in the Greyhound going into the RNs.
[02:48:06.180 --> 02:48:10.180]  As you guys have mentioned at Paul Ryan's event, and they're spreading, you know,
[02:48:10.180 --> 02:48:14.180]  they're spreading to Metro, they're spreading to the Greyhound, to the train stations, football games.
[02:48:14.180 --> 02:48:19.180]  And hey, football games, but let's remember, this is a group who on record,
[02:48:19.180 --> 02:48:22.180]  they do background checks to hire criminals. It's confirmed.
[02:48:22.180 --> 02:48:27.180]  And if you're a convicted or defraught priest, do you become the head of major cities
[02:48:27.180 --> 02:48:32.180]  like Philadelphia Airport? I mean, this is a Stalinistic brigade of criminals.
[02:48:32.180 --> 02:48:36.180]  I mean, it's unbelievable that back their criminals,
[02:48:36.180 --> 02:48:39.180]  so they're the people that say Ron Paul isn't good.
[02:48:39.180 --> 02:48:42.180]  The criminals go after the congressman who's a household name.
[02:48:42.180 --> 02:48:47.180]  He can't be trusted, but they as felons can.
[02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:50.180]  Yeah, exactly. They expose themselves because they have to lie.
[02:48:50.180 --> 02:48:53.180]  They have to cheat and they have to steal in order to win.
[02:48:53.180 --> 02:48:57.180]  And people like Ron Paul and others who stand for liberty and stand for freedom,
[02:48:57.180 --> 02:49:00.180]  they don't have to lie. We don't have to cheat. We're already doing what's right,
[02:49:00.180 --> 02:49:03.180]  and they know that, so they have to attack us.
[02:49:03.180 --> 02:49:05.180]  We've got about two minutes left in this segment.
[02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:07.180]  I'm going to come back and hit some final news, but gentlemen,
[02:49:07.180 --> 02:49:10.180]  any other points you'd like to make, your full videos are at our article.
[02:49:10.180 --> 02:49:14.180]  TSA takes over bus stations in Tampa. DHS agents threaten journalists.
[02:49:14.180 --> 02:49:16.180]  That's up there right now.
[02:49:16.180 --> 02:49:20.180]  But TSA harasses Ron Paul and his wife. It's all up there.
[02:49:20.180 --> 02:49:23.180]  It's also in your article, HoustonFreeThinkers.com.
[02:49:23.180 --> 02:49:26.180]  Any other closing quick comments?
[02:49:26.180 --> 02:49:29.180]  Yeah, Alex, I just want to say thank you for having us on to talk about this.
[02:49:29.180 --> 02:49:32.180]  We're going to continue to do this. We're going to be heading next to New York
[02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:35.180]  for 9-11 to do some coverage of the police state and the 11th anniversary of that.
[02:49:35.180 --> 02:49:37.180]  We're also fighting Floyd and Houston.
[02:49:37.180 --> 02:49:41.180]  So we're going to continue to make sure that Houston stays free and that Texas stays free.
[02:49:41.180 --> 02:49:43.180]  So thanks for talking with us.
[02:49:43.180 --> 02:49:47.180]  Oh, please don't thank me. Thank you for being out there on the front lines in a country
[02:49:47.180 --> 02:49:51.180]  where things are getting very, very dark, very, very scary.
[02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:57.180]  Nightfall is happening. I mean, classical signs of hardcore evil are upon us.
[02:49:57.180 --> 02:49:59.180]  And so please don't thank me. I want to thank you.
[02:49:59.180 --> 02:50:03.180]  If we don't all stand up and say no and let these people know we're not their slaves,
[02:50:03.180 --> 02:50:04.180]  they're going to take over.
[02:50:04.180 --> 02:50:08.180]  Look at how you've driven them out of Houston for now with their criminal activity.
[02:50:08.180 --> 02:50:12.180]  We've got to drive the banker occupiers out everywhere.
[02:50:12.180 --> 02:50:17.180]  They are collaborators for the bankers that have bragged that they've captured our country.
[02:50:17.180 --> 02:50:21.180]  I mean, the police aren't bad on average, but when they act like this, federal or local,
[02:50:21.180 --> 02:50:26.180]  they are aiding the criminal narcotic trafficking murdering banks.
[02:50:26.180 --> 02:50:29.180]  Definitely, Alex. We'll see you soon. We'll be out there on the front line.
[02:50:29.180 --> 02:50:34.180]  Thank you, gentlemen. Good job. And folks, I'll say this, you know, that isn't hyperbole.
[02:50:34.180 --> 02:50:38.180]  I mean, the big mega banks, launder the money, run the drug aircraft, grow the opium,
[02:50:38.180 --> 02:50:43.180]  run the white slavery. I mean, we are in the hands of global ruthless banks
[02:50:43.180 --> 02:50:47.180]  who are eugenicists that say they want to spike our food and water to kill us.
[02:50:47.180 --> 02:50:50.180]  They're publicly proposing it because they're already doing it.
[02:50:50.180 --> 02:50:51.180]  Now they admit it.
[02:50:51.180 --> 02:51:18.180]  Reality is off the charts, insane.
[02:51:18.180 --> 02:51:22.180]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[02:51:22.180 --> 02:51:26.180]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.

[02:52:25.180 --> 02:52:27.180]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:52:27.180 --> 02:52:31.180]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:52:31.180 --> 02:52:37.180]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:52:37.180 --> 02:52:41.180]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[02:52:41.180 --> 02:52:46.180]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:53:00.180 --> 02:53:04.180]  Get off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[02:53:04.180 --> 02:53:09.180]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[02:53:09.180 --> 02:53:11.180]  Mainstream news every day.
[02:53:11.180 --> 02:53:18.180]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[02:53:18.180 --> 02:53:22.180]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[02:53:22.180 --> 02:53:26.180]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[02:53:26.180 --> 02:53:33.180]  Right now our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub unit.
[02:53:33.180 --> 02:53:36.180]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[02:53:36.180 --> 02:53:39.180]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[02:53:39.180 --> 02:53:43.180]  Remember, these backup systems don't eat gas because they're solar powered.
[02:53:43.180 --> 02:53:46.180]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[02:53:46.180 --> 02:53:51.180]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at beattheblackouts.com.
[02:53:51.180 --> 02:54:06.180]  Music
[02:54:06.180 --> 02:54:13.180]  Alright, it's the final segment of this hour and I know I'm ranting, but if you're like, oh yeah, the government runs child kidnapping rings.
[02:54:13.180 --> 02:54:22.180]  Type in NACO, UN, child sex slavery, or white slavery, or Pentagon contractors.
[02:54:22.180 --> 02:54:25.180]  It's all protected just like Fast and Furious.
[02:54:25.180 --> 02:54:27.180]  It's only the tip of the iceberg.
[02:54:27.180 --> 02:54:28.180]  All of it.
[02:54:28.180 --> 02:54:30.180]  I mean, this is a criminal enterprise.
[02:54:30.180 --> 02:54:34.180]  The criminals want to be able to rob us and not get in trouble.
[02:54:34.180 --> 02:54:36.180]  That's what tyranny is.
[02:54:36.180 --> 02:54:38.180]  And it's here.
[02:54:38.180 --> 02:54:39.180]  I mean, it's here.
[02:54:39.180 --> 02:54:46.180]  The government sanctioned torture, including of children in front of their parents, not with real terrorists.
[02:54:46.180 --> 02:54:47.180]  They run al-Qaeda.
[02:54:47.180 --> 02:54:49.180]  We're in trouble.
[02:54:49.180 --> 02:54:53.180]  And they get these childlike minds, dress them up in black uniforms.
[02:54:53.180 --> 02:54:56.180]  The bureaucrats, they got the neighbors spying on each other.
[02:54:56.180 --> 02:54:57.180]  And there's no real terrorists.
[02:54:57.180 --> 02:54:58.180]  There never was.
[02:54:58.180 --> 02:55:00.180]  So now they're like, it's the gun owners.
[02:55:00.180 --> 02:55:01.180]  It's the libertarians.
[02:55:01.180 --> 02:55:03.180]  And then those are the very people.
[02:55:03.180 --> 02:55:07.180]  A lot of them, the conservatives are like, good, law and order, arrest everyone.
[02:55:07.180 --> 02:55:09.180]  Okay, well, it's going to be you.
[02:55:09.180 --> 02:55:11.180]  Yeah, there's the Department of State.
[02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:17.180]  Stop human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and abuse by international peacekeepers.
[02:55:17.180 --> 02:55:19.180]  Yeah, there they are.
[02:55:19.180 --> 02:55:21.180]  Oh, yeah, you're stopping it.
[02:55:21.180 --> 02:55:22.180]  You're running it.
[02:55:22.180 --> 02:55:27.180]  I mean, they're abusing the men that work at the Department of Justice, the women are, that rule it.
[02:55:27.180 --> 02:55:29.180]  What do you think they do, little kids?
[02:55:29.180 --> 02:55:31.180]  These are demons.
[02:55:31.180 --> 02:55:32.180]  Who wants tyranny?
[02:55:32.180 --> 02:55:33.180]  These people.
[02:55:33.180 --> 02:55:36.180]  And it's a lot deeper than Obama.
[02:55:36.180 --> 02:55:44.180]  Corruption is racing through our body like a staff infection, like metastasizing cancer.
[02:55:44.180 --> 02:55:54.180]  Some of the articles, big breaking news, Operation Mockingbird 2012, New York Times writer, leaked story critical of Obama to CIA.
[02:55:54.180 --> 02:55:57.180]  Bullets, false flags and biological warfare.
[02:55:57.180 --> 02:55:59.180]  What is the U.S. government planning?
[02:55:59.180 --> 02:56:00.180]  Powerful article.
[02:56:00.180 --> 02:56:03.180]  Billboards warning of martial law go up in Florida.
[02:56:03.180 --> 02:56:09.180]  Groupon offers hugely successful multi-stake concealed carry permit class.
[02:56:09.180 --> 02:56:11.180]  Don Salazar wrote that.
[02:56:11.180 --> 02:56:13.180]  RNC protest vastly outnumbered by cops.
[02:56:13.180 --> 02:56:16.180]  Texas students revolt against mandatory RFID track and chips.
[02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:19.180]  We need to get that article out and stand with these people fighting this.
[02:56:19.180 --> 02:56:20.180]  That's where it's at.
[02:56:20.180 --> 02:56:21.180]  It's not about security.
[02:56:21.180 --> 02:56:25.180]  It's about acclimation of the new prison cashless bee system.
[02:56:25.180 --> 02:56:27.180]  Where are your churches saying no to this?
[02:56:27.180 --> 02:56:31.180]  They're just like, praise God, we'll be teleported out of here soon.
[02:56:31.180 --> 02:56:34.180]  I declare.
[02:56:34.180 --> 02:56:43.180]  It's all up there right now at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and video streaming at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:56:43.180 --> 02:56:47.180]  Also, Bill Gates funds anti-vaccine surveillance.
[02:56:47.180 --> 02:56:50.180]  He wants to know if you're putting them down.
[02:56:50.180 --> 02:56:55.180]  Alert system and on-demand vaccine delivery via low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles.
[02:56:55.180 --> 02:56:56.180]  That's right.
[02:56:56.180 --> 02:56:57.180]  I should have got to this.
[02:56:57.180 --> 02:56:59.180]  That should be a top story.
[02:56:59.180 --> 02:57:06.180]  Bill Gates wants drones to deliver the vaccine like the anti-anxiety stress vaccine where
[02:57:06.180 --> 02:57:07.180]  you're never upset again.
[02:57:07.180 --> 02:57:13.180]  How many hundreds of times did I say the drones will spray it and you'll wake up with a headache
[02:57:13.180 --> 02:57:15.180]  but not be able to ever get upset again?
[02:57:15.180 --> 02:57:17.180]  There'll be no more pain soon.
[02:57:17.180 --> 02:57:19.180]  Oh, you don't want the fluoride?
[02:57:19.180 --> 02:57:21.180]  We have something else.
[02:57:21.180 --> 02:57:23.180]  Bill Gates.
[02:57:23.180 --> 02:57:27.180]  In fact, that's krypton.com.
[02:57:27.180 --> 02:57:28.180]  I'm going to get Kurt to post this.
[02:57:28.180 --> 02:57:30.180]  It's got the documents.
[02:57:30.180 --> 02:57:35.180]  Links to it right there, isn't that sweet?
[02:57:35.180 --> 02:57:41.180]  Unmanned aerial vehicles can be deployed and flown by cell phone to transport vaccines
[02:57:41.180 --> 02:57:42.180]  to rural locations.
[02:57:42.180 --> 02:57:46.180]  That's Bill Gates, quote.
[02:57:46.180 --> 02:57:52.180]  That's MIT and Harvard Division of Health Sciences.
[02:57:52.180 --> 02:57:53.180]  Pure hell.
[02:57:53.180 --> 02:57:55.180]  Oh, it's all for our security.
[02:57:55.180 --> 02:57:56.180]  Sure it is.
[02:57:56.180 --> 02:57:57.180]  Sure it is.
[02:57:57.180 --> 02:57:58.180]  Ben Lodin's in your pants.
[02:57:58.180 --> 02:57:59.180]  They got to check there.
[02:57:59.180 --> 02:58:01.180]  No, they got to break your will.

[02:58:36.180 --> 02:58:41.180]  And don't listen to us tonight at 7 o'clock on infowarsh.com.
[02:58:41.180 --> 02:58:42.180]  It's bad.
[02:58:42.180 --> 02:58:43.180]  We're bad.
[02:58:43.180 --> 02:58:44.180]  We don't trust our loving government.
[02:58:44.180 --> 02:58:46.180]  We're evil.
[02:58:46.180 --> 02:58:50.180]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackout.
[02:58:50.180 --> 02:58:53.180]  Get off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[02:58:53.180 --> 02:58:58.180]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[02:58:58.180 --> 02:59:00.180]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[02:59:00.180 --> 02:59:08.180]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[02:59:08.180 --> 02:59:12.180]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[02:59:12.180 --> 02:59:17.180]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[02:59:17.180 --> 02:59:24.180]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub unit.
[02:59:24.180 --> 02:59:27.180]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[02:59:27.180 --> 02:59:30.180]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[02:59:30.180 --> 02:59:34.180]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered.
[02:59:34.180 --> 02:59:37.180]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[02:59:37.180 --> 02:59:42.180]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at beattheblackouts.com.
