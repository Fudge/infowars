[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:32.280]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:42.600 --> 00:53.160]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night on this thursday april 23rd 2015 we
[00:53.160 --> 00:58.800]  have a lot of news today we've got reports coming up we've just had a press conference
[00:58.800 --> 01:06.880]  from obama saying that he is now killed americans accidentally of course with a drone strike
[01:06.880 --> 01:13.680]  no word about any regret for all the thousands of people in that area that he's killed innocent
[01:13.680 --> 01:18.720]  people men women and children that they've killed over the years never a press conference
[01:18.720 --> 01:25.600]  never any regret about that it is a tragedy to kill three americans i think it's one italian
[01:25.600 --> 01:33.160]  is the death toll on this particular case back in january nevertheless when you ignore
[01:33.160 --> 01:39.000]  these thousands of deaths or in the case of lindsay graham when you brag about the fact
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.200]  that you have killed thousands of people it's a pretty corrupt country it's a pretty corrupt
[01:45.200 --> 01:48.760]  government we're going to talk about ethics today of course we've got chinese scientists
[01:48.760 --> 01:53.360]  genetically modifying human embryos where is that going to lead and we had never that
[01:53.360 --> 01:57.040]  story we had yesterday about the saudi prince he's a major backer in twitter and he tweeted
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.440]  out an arabic that he was going to reward a hundred fighter pilots who had been bombing
[02:02.440 --> 02:08.080]  yemen no regret about that he's going to give them bitlies he said well after that went
[02:08.080 --> 02:15.520]  viral he's taken that post down but i'm sure he will still make good on that a multi-billionaire
[02:15.520 --> 02:19.680]  he's going to hand out bitlies to people who are very good at killing you know that's what
[02:19.680 --> 02:25.200]  obama said when he was talking about drone strikes he made that comment reported in one
[02:25.200 --> 02:29.200]  of the books he says you know i'm really good at killing yeah he is really good at killing
[02:29.200 --> 02:34.960]  and he's pretty poor in terms of ethics he's pretty poor in terms of apologies we also
[02:34.960 --> 02:41.560]  got on the same front with obama we have him doing a back and forth with elizabeth warn
[02:41.560 --> 02:46.000]  there have been briefings with democrats about the trans-pacific partnership because of course
[02:46.000 --> 02:52.720]  the republicans seem to be full on in supporting this saying that it's a free trade act it's
[02:52.720 --> 02:57.720]  not free trade we've talked about this how it is managed trade this is corporate bailouts
[02:57.720 --> 03:02.960]  this is crony capitalism to the nth degree but of course they're portraying it as if
[03:02.960 --> 03:08.400]  it was a bailout free trade but of course the democrats are not buying it they understand
[03:08.400 --> 03:14.560]  the loss in jobs that happened after nafta this is far far greater than that nevertheless
[03:14.560 --> 03:20.920]  they are opposing it she says if people really knew what was in there they would oppose it
[03:20.920 --> 03:24.160]  that's why they're keeping it secret and so there's been a back and forth with obama
[03:24.160 --> 03:29.200]  and elizabeth warn we're going to talk about carlie fiorina she's uh saying that she's
[03:29.200 --> 03:34.440]  going to throw her hat in because of course we need somebody to counter the identity politics
[03:34.440 --> 03:40.680]  of hillary clinton and so she offers her own version of identity politics some of the most
[03:40.680 --> 03:45.680]  racist uh should say sexist sorry some of the most sexist statements i have ever seen
[03:45.680 --> 03:49.920]  come out of a candidate but of course she's not a political neophyte she points out she's
[03:49.920 --> 03:55.920]  done consulting work for the cia great we've got another one of those coming for us we've
[03:55.920 --> 04:03.480]  also got the house passing a new cyber sharing bill the pcna protecting cyber networks act
[04:03.480 --> 04:10.120]  uh this is something that is not the uh syspa bill the reincarnation of syspa but again
[04:10.120 --> 04:16.320]  it is information sharing between corporations and the government and of course this is going
[04:16.320 --> 04:23.080]  to block your foyer request at the same time we learned uh yesterday with um an article
[04:23.080 --> 04:29.760]  from um that was posted on drudge that facebook is collecting text that you don't even send
[04:29.760 --> 04:36.080]  that's how bad it's gotten they sent out text uh they collect the text store that even as
[04:36.080 --> 04:39.480]  you're thinking about it you say well you know maybe that's a little bit too inflammatory
[04:39.480 --> 04:42.600]  uh maybe i don't want to use that kind of rhetoric so you don't send it out well they're
[04:42.600 --> 04:47.000]  going to keep that and they're going to use that to analyze you and of course they're
[04:47.000 --> 04:59.360]  going to be sending that out say with us we'll be right back
[04:59.360 --> 05:03.560]  beth clarkson chief statistician for the national institute for aviation research filed an open
[05:03.560 --> 05:07.560]  records lawsuit in sedgwick county district court as part of her personal quest to find
[05:07.560 --> 05:12.160]  an unexplained pattern that transcends elections and states she found patterns and results
[05:12.160 --> 05:16.280]  that favored republican establishment candidates over tea party candidates and primaries and
[05:16.280 --> 05:20.200]  in the general election this is not an anomaly that has occurred in one place clarkson said
[05:20.200 --> 05:23.920]  it is a pattern that has occurred repeatedly in elections across the united states info

[08:27.240 --> 08:30.680]  i'm david night your host we're gonna be joined later in the show with paul joseph
[08:30.680 --> 08:35.800]  watson from the uk we're also gonna have a jacari jackson step in and talk to us we
[08:35.800 --> 08:41.200]  just had a press conference this morning from the obama administration offering their regrets
[08:41.200 --> 08:47.000]  for some innocent people who were killed in a drone strike three americans i think one
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.760]  italian i believe is the let's say two american al-qaeda operatives were killed though so i
[08:52.760 --> 08:59.280]  guess that makes it okay now they say that it just isn't sufficient for them no words
[08:59.280 --> 09:06.080]  can fully express our regret over this terrible tragedy said press secretary josh earnest
[09:06.080 --> 09:11.080]  but you know there's been no words of regret for the thousands of people that have died
[09:11.080 --> 09:15.960]  the thousands of innocent men women and children who have died from these drone strikes that
[09:15.960 --> 09:21.880]  obama is doing all over the world in his new open assassination policy you know we used
[09:21.880 --> 09:26.520]  to be ashamed of the fact that we had a government organization that would assassinate people
[09:26.520 --> 09:34.480]  the cia used to keep that quiet there were church committee hearings senator church
[09:34.480 --> 09:39.400]  ran hearings to see what the cia was doing and the public was appalled but now we do
[09:39.400 --> 09:47.440]  that openly the mask has come off in the same way that they now openly spy on us we just
[09:47.440 --> 09:53.160]  had another bill passed through the house more collection more dragnet surveillance
[09:53.160 --> 09:58.480]  of the american public this one is called protecting cyber networks act the pcna has
[09:58.480 --> 10:05.480]  just been passed by the house of representatives voted 307 to 116 it wasn't even close now under
[10:05.480 --> 10:12.000]  the pcna data that shared through the government could be exempt from disclosure under foyer
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.440]  creating quote a new secret cyber intelligence coordinating body i'm sure that's the purpose
[10:18.440 --> 10:22.240]  they also say that it would allow for data to flow between corporations via government
[10:22.240 --> 10:26.800]  intermediaries of course that has been what they've been selling the public after this
[10:26.800 --> 10:32.000]  sony hack all along saying we've got to do more cyber intelligence sharing and of course
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.720]  that was what syspa was all along it was sharing of intelligence between the government and
[10:38.720 --> 10:44.440]  the corporations the corporations turning over information about you as they do business
[10:44.440 --> 10:50.000]  with you under the fiction that this information belongs to these corporations nevertheless
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.880]  they have some legal exposure so syspa was there to protect them from any liability so
[10:54.880 --> 10:58.360]  they just keep passing these laws it's not that they're going to do something different
[10:58.360 --> 11:03.880]  we all know that they're spying on everything that we do illegally unconstitutionally they're
[11:03.880 --> 11:08.600]  collecting all this information they're just giving themselves legal cover at this point
[11:08.600 --> 11:13.560]  they say civil liberties groups criticize bill for allowing any data to also be used with
[11:13.560 --> 11:20.920]  the espionage act and of course we've had two thirds of the people who have been charged
[11:20.920 --> 11:26.200]  under the 1917 espionage act have been under the obama administration i think there's been
[11:26.200 --> 11:32.200]  nine people total before obama from 1917 to obama there were three and now there's been
[11:32.200 --> 11:37.200]  i believe nine unless he's added to that list they say it would make it ripe for things
[11:37.200 --> 11:41.520]  like surveillance of journalists and their sources because they have been the targets
[11:41.520 --> 11:46.960]  of the obama administration in the espionage act so this is really kind of a double down
[11:46.960 --> 11:51.640]  in your face tyranny and of course it was just yesterday that ram paul said our founding
[11:51.640 --> 11:58.040]  fathers would be mortified by the nsa yes they would and they should be yet for a second
[11:58.040 --> 12:01.920]  time and i didn't talk about this yesterday jeb bush now has got these talking points
[12:01.920 --> 12:06.160]  he's going around to all the neoconservative talk show hosts so he went to hu hu it then
[12:06.160 --> 12:10.240]  he went to michael medvid most recently and he's saying the same thing in all these places
[12:10.240 --> 12:17.000]  he said one of the great successes of the obama administration has been their dragnet surveillance
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.880]  i'm paraphrasing him but he says the problem is that obama isn't bragging about this now
[12:23.880 --> 12:28.880]  we need to sell this to the american people and so he said we need to understand and this
[12:28.880 --> 12:34.000]  is jeb bush talking he said the first obligation i think of our national government is to keep
[12:34.000 --> 12:40.840]  us safe no that's the first excuse of a criminal government is that they're going to take your
[12:40.840 --> 12:46.800]  liberties to keep you safe you never get safety when they take your freedom you just become
[12:46.800 --> 12:52.640]  a slave and then he goes on to say we can do this while we're protecting civil liberties
[12:52.640 --> 12:56.960]  so he always throws out there saying that they're going to protect us and they're going to protect
[12:56.960 --> 13:03.240]  our civil liberties by taking our civil liberties now there's pushback against obama from democrats
[13:03.240 --> 13:08.240]  as well again on the trans-pacific partnership uh... lisbeth warren is going back and forth
[13:08.240 --> 13:12.880]  with obama she's leading the opposition within the democrat party because there is no opposition
[13:12.880 --> 13:17.080]  in the republican party as i mentioned in the last segment uh... they have blocked members
[13:17.080 --> 13:22.120]  from discussing any specifics they say they've been giving briefings on the deal uh... to
[13:22.120 --> 13:27.120]  members of congress but they say the the briefings are classified because they are sensitive
[13:27.120 --> 13:32.000]  and ongoing well actually the reality is that that they've signed these nondisclosure agreements
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.200]  and they have senators like senator widen who has looked at it he had to sign a nondisclosure
[13:37.200 --> 13:41.240]  agreement his staff had to sign a nondisclosure agreement so they couldn't talk to anybody
[13:41.240 --> 13:47.760]  about it and so that right there should disqualify as elizabeth warren says the government doesn't
[13:47.760 --> 13:53.720]  want you to read this massive new trade agreement it's top secret and she said why the real
[13:53.720 --> 13:57.720]  answer people have given me is we can't make the deal public because the american people
[13:57.720 --> 14:02.280]  if they saw what was in it would be opposed to it she says the obvious if the american
[14:02.280 --> 14:05.920]  people would be opposed to a treaty trade agreement if they saw it then the trade agreement should
[14:05.920 --> 14:10.720]  not become law in the united states of course they're making all kinds of shortcuts because
[14:10.720 --> 14:14.120]  we don't have a government that obeys the law anymore uh... they're not doing this as
[14:14.120 --> 14:18.960]  a treaty uh... ratification with the senate with a two-thirds they're going to go with
[14:18.960 --> 14:24.040]  a just a simple majority vote because they know they can get that passed so there's game
[14:24.040 --> 14:29.040]  after game after game being played with this but that in and of itself should tell you
[14:29.040 --> 14:33.880]  that that's a problem it should be a problem when you understand that all these mandatory
[14:33.880 --> 14:39.600]  vaccine laws that are coming in are they're trying to force you to buy something that
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.280]  they have given full liability protection to the pharmaceutical companies that sell it
[14:44.280 --> 14:49.160]  going back to nineteen eighty six and yet we see all kinds of shenanigans being played
[14:49.160 --> 14:54.840]  in california with a sb two seven seven of course leon macadoo has a uh... a very good
[14:54.840 --> 14:59.560]  report talking about the tricks that they have uh... played to move that bill forward
[14:59.560 --> 15:04.800]  in the california legislature you can see that on the alex jones youtube channel i
[15:04.800 --> 15:13.400]  want to play for you an advertisement from a district of columbia abortion spa
[15:13.400 --> 15:17.520]  now this is going to sound and if you're watching this uh... it's going to sound as they point
[15:17.520 --> 15:22.360]  out in this article uh... this was put up by western journalism it's going to look like
[15:22.360 --> 15:29.400]  a saturday night live or a uh... comedy sketch but it's not and i want you to listen to the
[15:29.400 --> 15:33.760]  very end of this because that's when things really pick up there's a little bit of silence
[15:33.760 --> 15:38.560]  all kind of narrated as they're playing this list let's go to that clip now guys
[15:38.560 --> 15:43.760]  i heard she had appendicitis so these are real proper ladies i heard she went to the
[15:43.760 --> 15:49.760]  country side gossiping setting three of them gossiping and looking at each other
[15:49.760 --> 15:56.600]  oh wait a minute you guys are talking about abortion
[15:56.600 --> 16:02.360]  because there's no shame in it abortion yeah we do that
[16:02.360 --> 16:06.800]  so they've got these ladies that look like they stepped out of uh... nineteen fifties
[16:06.800 --> 16:11.120]  uh... sitcom or madmen and they're sitting there with their pearls and their hair up
[16:11.120 --> 16:15.520]  and they're raising their eyes about well we think that she went to some uh... mother
[16:15.520 --> 16:20.200]  pleasure and she says it depends back for those of you can see this it depends back
[16:20.200 --> 16:24.520]  to uh... a younger girl to get her feet up and she's wearing those uh... red high heels
[16:24.520 --> 16:28.400]  you know they have uh... the national guard and marines wearing now she's wearing those
[16:28.400 --> 16:32.960]  red high heels she's very trendy and she's uh... sipping coffee and she goes yeah it's
[16:32.960 --> 16:40.680]  abortion we do that in your face we have to have a discussion about medical yeah there's
[16:40.680 --> 16:44.800]  a picture of for those of you saying it we have to have a discussion about ethics you
[16:44.800 --> 16:50.240]  know we have to have a discussion about informed consent that's the basis on all of these mandatory
[16:50.240 --> 16:55.240]  vaccine laws and if you stop and look at it the people who are selling you abortion in
[16:55.240 --> 17:00.000]  most of these cases it's the women who are saying yeah we're all pro-choice and we're
[17:00.000 --> 17:03.640]  going to do this and we're going to be proud of it and yet they won't give you a choice
[17:03.640 --> 17:10.560]  about vaccines you understand that of course this is not even about the medical treatment
[17:10.560 --> 17:15.400]  it's about the principle that you have a right to make these decisions in your life not other
[17:15.400 --> 17:21.360]  people and they can't see that they tout the fact that they're going to kill a seven pound
[17:21.360 --> 17:27.120]  baby but they won't give you a choice about your health care they won't let you choose
[17:27.120 --> 17:32.640]  what you're going to inject to that baby they're going to force that upon you think about how
[17:32.640 --> 17:39.560]  this is going okay if it's the same as losing our due process or innocent until proven guilty
[17:39.560 --> 17:45.880]  yeah we've already done that as well to haven't we look at what they did in the nuclear experiments
[17:45.880 --> 17:51.480]  with troops telling them sent exploding these above ground tests and then sending the nuclear
[17:51.480 --> 17:57.600]  troops in right away we've got an article on medium dot com talking about how this came
[17:57.600 --> 18:01.160]  out they say the soldiers were more than five miles from ground zero when the explosion
[18:01.160 --> 18:06.040]  named shot dog went off afterwards the soldiers moved out to inspect equipment fighting positions
[18:06.040 --> 18:10.440]  a mere two miles from ground zero then the troops moved even closer in single file to
[18:10.440 --> 18:15.000]  the epicenter to check out even more gear footage of the soldiers moving from ground zero to
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  even more gear photo fortifications and sheep technicians put the animals out in the open
[18:20.000 --> 18:26.320]  and foxholes inside structures now they say the army declined to inform the troops that
[18:26.320 --> 18:31.560]  they were headed into a war game they declined to tell them that they were going into an
[18:31.560 --> 18:36.520]  area where they had just exploded a nuclear bomb and they didn't tell them what the dangers
[18:36.520 --> 18:40.240]  were now of course when they went through this they said that they found that eighty percent
[18:40.240 --> 18:44.840]  of participants weren't fazed at all by what was happening they didn't care they said yeah
[18:44.840 --> 18:48.960]  I would have volunteered if they would have told me see there's a difference though between
[18:48.960 --> 18:55.040]  consent and informed consent they didn't tell them what the dangers were they were learning
[18:55.040 --> 19:01.320]  what the dangers were using these soldiers as guinea pigs they can use you as guinea
[19:01.320 --> 19:08.360]  pigs on any kind of vaccine that's coming in and they don't have any any liability because
[19:08.360 --> 19:13.240]  of the vaccine court in America we had people who took the swine flu vaccine back in the
[19:13.240 --> 19:20.200]  1970s they consented to do that as well but they were lied to on the information package
[19:20.200 --> 19:23.600]  that they were that they sent out they told them about some studies that have been done
[19:23.600 --> 19:28.040]  on a different vaccine than the one that they took a lot of people were damaged by that
[19:28.040 --> 19:32.280]  and of course that was one of the precursors to them setting up the vaccine court so they
[19:32.280 --> 19:36.720]  didn't have to pay people for the damages that they do to them do you understand that
[19:36.720 --> 19:40.960]  we're headed down the same path if we lose our informed consent of what they did to people
[19:40.960 --> 19:46.720]  at the Tuskegee experiments what the Japanese and the Germans did to people when they took
[19:46.720 --> 19:52.040]  out their blood and replaced it with seawater saying this is for the good of everyone we're
[19:52.040 --> 19:56.600]  going to destroy this individual for the good of everyone that's why we have to keep informed

[24:17.400 --> 24:23.960]  this new ad from the dc abortions spa and of course i think this in your face attitude
[24:23.960 --> 24:30.880]  that they have makes it very clear that this is not they have absolutely no shame in what
[24:30.880 --> 24:34.680]  they're doing and make that very clear we've been told for a long time that this is to
[24:34.680 --> 24:40.080]  support a woman's choice and yet we see the same people who are trying to take away your
[24:40.080 --> 24:43.800]  informed consent and medical procedures and it's not just about vaccination if they can
[24:43.800 --> 24:48.840]  take away your informed consent for one thing they can do it for everything i want to play
[24:48.840 --> 24:53.160]  that clip again play that just the punch line there what she says in the end of this commercial
[24:53.160 --> 25:03.240]  oh wait a minute you guys are talking about abortion because there's no shame in it abortion
[25:03.240 --> 25:12.360]  yeah we do that exactly yeah it's really about valuing life because if you don't value the
[25:12.360 --> 25:17.920]  life of a seven pound baby you're not going to value the life of an elderly person and
[25:17.920 --> 25:22.440]  you're not going to value eventually the life of somebody who's on their prime but has an
[25:22.440 --> 25:27.120]  expensive medical condition because we're going to make the argument that it's in the best
[25:27.120 --> 25:32.000]  interest of society to withhold medical care from that person because that's the argument
[25:32.000 --> 25:37.680]  they're making to take away your informed consent that was one of our sacred principles
[25:37.680 --> 25:42.920]  we enshrined that in the medical ethics community we reinforced it after the nuremberg trials
[25:42.920 --> 25:47.840]  when we saw people experimented on in the name of coming up with more effective medical
[25:47.840 --> 25:52.720]  treatments of course that was what joseph mingola was saying that was what the people that
[25:52.720 --> 25:58.440]  did that in japan were saying they said we're going to do these experiments to see how we
[25:58.440 --> 26:04.640]  can better protect our pilots from extreme conditions for example but you can't do that
[26:04.640 --> 26:09.920]  we said we're not going to do that as a society and yet we have we did that with tuskegee
[26:09.920 --> 26:14.960]  experiments we have done that just a couple of years ago when I started here at info wars
[26:14.960 --> 26:21.800]  we had the EPA trying to extend their regulatory control over fine particulate matter so they
[26:21.800 --> 26:26.040]  could shut down coal plants they went before congress and said you know this is not just
[26:26.040 --> 26:30.800]  making people sick this will actually kill you and at the same time lisa jackson is
[26:30.800 --> 26:37.000]  saying that in congress the EPA is running an experiment close to where I lived at the
[26:37.000 --> 26:43.960]  university of north carolina subjecting people selecting people who have respiratory and
[26:43.960 --> 26:49.040]  heart issues and subjecting them to levels of fine particulate matter that are 70 times
[26:49.040 --> 26:55.920]  higher than what the EPA said would kill you hooking them directly up to a diesel truck
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.600]  exhaust pipe we tried to get that stopped we tried to get a restraining order on it and
[27:00.600 --> 27:05.240]  the federal government said no we're not going to do that say under the nirnberg code even
[27:05.240 --> 27:09.520]  if you give somebody informed consent and it's something that is life threatening that's
[27:09.520 --> 27:14.640]  still an ethical you can't get informed consent from somebody if it's going to be life threatening
[27:14.640 --> 27:19.760]  but our new federal government said no that's not a problem so then they went ahead and did
[27:19.760 --> 27:23.440]  it again in california they continued those experiments in north carolina they did it
[27:23.440 --> 27:28.160]  in california then they came back and they selected some more experiments where they
[27:28.160 --> 27:34.080]  were selecting for 15 year old black males who have asthma sounds an awful lot like tuskegee
[27:34.080 --> 27:40.040]  doesn't it except in today's america the federal government isn't ashamed of it any more than
[27:40.040 --> 27:46.480]  obama is ashamed of his assassination drones we do these things in the open now that's
[27:46.480 --> 27:52.320]  how far we have fallen and you have to understand that just as we've given up our due process
[27:52.320 --> 27:57.720]  and our liberty and it hasn't made us safer or more secure when you give up your informed
[27:57.720 --> 28:02.120]  consent your right to be treated like a human you're not getting herd immunity you're just
[28:02.120 --> 28:06.840]  going to be treated like part of the herd you're going to be treated like an animal that's
[28:06.840 --> 28:11.360]  the way they see you they're going to do whatever they wish to you and they're going to justify
[28:11.360 --> 28:17.360]  it in the name of the collective good now there's like guys you have this magic school
[28:17.360 --> 28:24.760]  bus parody because it is a full court press to try to take away our freedoms let's play
[28:24.760 --> 28:27.640]  a little bit of this and i want to comment as we leave my mic open as we're running
[28:27.640 --> 28:33.560]  this thing any of you have that are college age or older you know the magic school bus
[28:33.560 --> 28:39.320]  that was a pbs series this is something that got 1.7 million views on youtube and of course
[28:39.320 --> 28:43.040]  it's not produced by the magic school bus people it's a parody some college students
[28:43.040 --> 28:49.800]  put it through but this is the straw man argument attacking people as kooks who don't want to
[28:49.800 --> 28:59.960]  lose their informed consent let's run this what a marvelous day nothing gives me more
[28:59.960 --> 29:05.640]  joy than teaching my students about the human body but since your children aren't vaccinated
[29:05.640 --> 29:10.000]  it's incredibly unsafe for them to come to school oh sorry i just believe that vaccines
[29:10.000 --> 29:16.520]  are the parents choice and i believe they're unnatural they're a conspiracy so instead
[29:16.520 --> 29:22.160]  i'll be educating you for though you are grown adults you all need a lesson in biology straw
[29:22.160 --> 29:30.280]  man arguments in cartoon form they go into the measles vaccine and here we are they're
[29:30.280 --> 29:33.680]  going to inject this into somebody show you what goes on enters the bloodstream the immune
[29:33.680 --> 29:39.760]  system is activated you see those white blood cells are learning how to protect the body
[29:39.760 --> 29:46.520]  from the disease sure you say that but where's the proof where's the evidence it's literally
[29:46.520 --> 29:51.800]  outside your window just turn you're on the march okay that's where we're gonna come right
[29:51.800 --> 30:00.360]  back jacari jackson is going to be joining us stay with us radio network freedom and liberty
[30:00.360 --> 30:04.360]  lovers listen up the republic of liberland is looking for citizens to inhabit what used

[30:13.280 --> 30:17.560]  where honest people could prosper with minimal to no interference from a centralized government

[30:22.120 --> 30:26.560]  financial pledges to set up a state and telecom infrastructure sputnik reports that requirements
[30:26.560 --> 30:30.920]  for a prospective liberland citizen must have respect for other people and respect the opinions

[30:48.400 --> 30:51.760]  with minimal government harassment that would prove we no longer need a massive central

[33:15.560 --> 33:25.240]  texas command center in the heart of the resistance it's alex jones welcome back to
[33:25.240 --> 33:29.760]  the
[33:29.760 --> 33:35.340]  and I want to get his feedback especially on this magic school bus propaganda because
[33:35.340 --> 33:40.880]  you're just a child I grew up with the magic school bus I very much enjoyed it yes frizzle
[33:40.880 --> 33:45.160]  in the rest of the crew and just to see that piece you know college humor you know I like
[33:45.160 --> 33:48.540]  some of the stuff they put out but they also put out you know these kind of propaganda
[33:48.540 --> 33:53.760]  pieces and not even get to see the full video but the clip I saw I'm severely doubt they're
[33:53.760 --> 33:57.860]  going to talk about when the vaccines kill the kids in Syria, the World Health Organization
[33:57.860 --> 34:01.720]  going out there and giving the kids the bad vaccines. I seriously doubt that's going to
[34:01.720 --> 34:05.640]  make them there. I doubt they're going to talk about Ronald Reagan passing the law saying
[34:05.640 --> 34:08.840]  that you can't sue the vaccine manufacturers. I doubt it's going to be in there. I mean,
[34:08.840 --> 34:09.840]  they could surprise me, but I don't think.
[34:09.840 --> 34:15.000]  And they're not going to talk about the cases where you've got 99.5% of the people vaccinated
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.200]  yet they still get the disease. We've had a lot of different cases that show that this
[34:18.200 --> 34:22.200]  herd mentality, this herd mentality, I keep calling it the herd mentality, herd immunity
[34:22.200 --> 34:25.840]  does not work. If it doesn't work for the individual, it's not going to work for the
[34:25.840 --> 34:30.520]  herd. And that's what people need to understand. It comes down to the effectiveness of it,
[34:30.520 --> 34:34.680]  but it also comes down to the fact that they're giving them legal immunity. You should be
[34:34.680 --> 34:41.640]  very concerned about anything that major corporations are pushing to force you to take and that
[34:41.640 --> 34:47.760]  they have absolutely no liability for. That's a pattern that we're seeing now.
[34:47.760 --> 34:51.400]  Exactly. Because you always hear the stories about someone goes to a restaurant and how
[34:51.400 --> 34:55.440]  much people get sick. Then they go investigate it and they go have sanctions against the
[34:55.440 --> 34:59.520]  restaurant or whatever. But when it comes to your vaccines, that doesn't exist.
[34:59.520 --> 35:03.240]  That's right. And the thing about is if you're eating something, you can stop eating it.
[35:03.240 --> 35:06.880]  If the vaccine's in your body, it's in there. It's going to do whatever it's going to do.
[35:06.880 --> 35:09.360]  That's right. They don't want to inform you what the risks are because it's like this
[35:09.360 --> 35:13.200]  abortion ad where they say, yeah, it's abortion. Yeah, we do that. And you know, the other
[35:13.200 --> 35:18.440]  thing that they do is they increasingly, as I pointed out yesterday, all of this trans-specific
[35:18.440 --> 35:22.440]  partnership and transatlantic partnership, these so-called trade agreements, they're
[35:22.440 --> 35:27.800]  all about holding a gun to your head and forcing you to do things that you don't want. Holding
[35:27.800 --> 35:32.240]  a gun to the head of countries that have outlawed genetically modified organisms because they
[35:32.240 --> 35:35.960]  have concerns about them. They want to see what the long-term effects are or they've
[35:35.960 --> 35:40.960]  already seen effects that they don't want to allow into their country. So this is about
[35:40.960 --> 35:44.360]  forcing holding a gun to the head of those people and saying, no, you're going to buy
[35:44.360 --> 35:47.000]  the product from this corporation whether you like it or not.
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.440]  Yeah. That's what we see because people always talk about, you know, I want freedom to do
[35:50.440 --> 35:53.560]  this. I want freedom to do that. But then they're being forced to do stuff by the government
[35:53.560 --> 35:55.960]  and they don't really have a big issue about that.
[35:55.960 --> 35:59.880]  Yes. And I would also point out that this article that just came out, this is pretty
[35:59.880 --> 36:04.520]  amazing. Someone sent this to me. Cuba to export cancer vaccines to the U.S. And the
[36:04.520 --> 36:08.440]  New York governor confirms this. They say they're going to import a therapeutic vaccine
[36:08.440 --> 36:12.760]  against lung cancer that's been developed in Cuba. It is going to go to the Roswell
[36:12.760 --> 36:17.800]  Park Cancer Institute of New York. She says, signing this agreement means we can immerse
[36:17.800 --> 36:22.440]  ourself in clinical trials when we return to New York. So everything is a vaccine. And
[36:22.440 --> 36:26.640]  again, that comes back to the vaccine court. You know, if they were to give you a pill
[36:26.640 --> 36:30.640]  and it was to do harm, then they would have legal exposure. If they were to give you an
[36:30.640 --> 36:34.400]  antibiotic, the same thing. Any other kind of medication or surgery, they would have
[36:34.400 --> 36:39.960]  some legal exposure. But if it's a vaccine, it's like it's the sacred cow, you know,
[36:39.960 --> 36:44.480]  it's the thing that you cannot touch because you see these guys, the late night guys, they
[36:44.480 --> 36:48.520]  like to make fun of the vaccine parents and all this stuff. But even though it is always
[36:48.520 --> 36:52.920]  the argument that vaccines are harmful in any way, why aren't people on TV talking about
[36:52.920 --> 36:57.880]  it? Well, besides the fact your big major networks have pharmaceutical ads and every
[36:57.880 --> 37:02.280]  single commercial break, you do see people. Pierce Morgan got sick from a vaccine of the
[37:02.280 --> 37:05.800]  young lady on Katie Courant. You know, she got sick from the vaccine. And you know, while
[37:05.800 --> 37:09.080]  the girl sitting there, you know, having all these health defects, you know, there's the
[37:09.080 --> 37:13.200]  doctor sitting right next to, well, this affects are very rare and they're usually pretty moderate.
[37:13.200 --> 37:16.760]  What next? The girl is about to fall over and die right next to her. But yeah, they're
[37:16.760 --> 37:20.280]  trying to tell you that it rarely happens. Well, I think it just doesn't pass a sniff
[37:20.280 --> 37:23.760]  test. You know, when you look at legal immunity is very much like these trade agreements, just
[37:23.760 --> 37:27.240]  like Elizabeth Warren was saying, why won't they tell you what's in it? You know, why won't
[37:27.240 --> 37:30.760]  they tell you what's in the trade agreement? Why won't they let you have labels that show
[37:30.760 --> 37:35.280]  if it's got genetically modified organisms? And then the whole argument, David saying
[37:35.280 --> 37:38.640]  that if we label these things, it's going to cost these companies all this money, it's
[37:38.640 --> 37:42.880]  going to raise your price of food. Every time they have a big football game, the big summer
[37:42.880 --> 37:46.840]  blockbusters about to come out, they changed the packaging on the food anyway.
[37:46.840 --> 37:47.840]  That's it.
[37:47.840 --> 37:52.080]  So they don't know what to just add. You know, this contains GMO, whatever the label has
[37:52.080 --> 37:53.080]  to say.
[37:53.080 --> 37:56.480]  That doesn't cost them anything to do that. It's a bogus argument and we ought to all
[37:56.480 --> 38:00.760]  just stop when they're going to take away our informed consent, when they're going to
[38:00.760 --> 38:06.080]  take away our right to come after them and get compensation if it does harm for their
[38:06.080 --> 38:09.720]  right. When we see these negotiations being done in secret, all of that stuff should be
[38:09.720 --> 38:10.720]  a giant red flag.
[38:10.720 --> 38:15.080]  And we should just pull back and say, if that's the way it's going to go down, it isn't going
[38:15.080 --> 38:18.240]  to go down. We ought to just stop at that point. And of course, we have talked over
[38:18.240 --> 38:24.000]  and over again about the various aspects and case histories of these vaccines. But it ought
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.760]  to stop at the surface level is really where it ought to stop.
[38:26.760 --> 38:32.080]  I've got some news and we want to talk about this announcement that Obama had today. Before
[38:32.080 --> 38:35.880]  I go to that, Jacar I want to let people know that we've got InfoWars Life Silver Bullet
[38:35.880 --> 38:41.840]  on sale at the InfoWarsLife.com store right now, 50% off. It's normally $29.95. Right
[38:41.840 --> 38:47.040]  now you can save $15 per bottle. That's 30 parts per million colloidal silver, preparedness
[38:47.040 --> 38:51.040]  grade is silver. It is frequently out of stock right now. We've got it in stock and we've
[38:51.040 --> 38:57.080]  got it on the biggest sale we've ever had. 50% off a $15 per bottle savings. InfoWars
[38:57.080 --> 39:01.160]  Life Silver Bullet at InfoWarsLife.com.
[39:01.160 --> 39:06.280]  Now the other thing I want to mention before we go to the press conference, there's a couple
[39:06.280 --> 39:11.120]  of protests coming up. Very important ones. We talked earlier about the gold mine out
[39:11.120 --> 39:16.360]  in Oregon. Now the BLM was moving against some miners who had had a mine there since
[39:16.360 --> 39:24.240]  the 1870s. And the BLM was talking like they were going to take it by force this coming
[39:24.240 --> 39:30.040]  Saturday, just two days away. We had oath keepers go out there and set up a security
[39:30.040 --> 39:34.760]  perimeter to protect the people there from any kind of precipitve movement by the BLM
[39:34.760 --> 39:39.680]  like that because they wanted to go through the legal proceedings, get due process. They
[39:39.680 --> 39:44.080]  were not giving them their day in court. So we need to at least have a day in court because
[39:44.080 --> 39:50.760]  we have rights to this mine that we've kept a chain of title going back to the 1870s.
[39:50.760 --> 39:54.800]  So they've got protests that are scheduled today. I just want to let people who are in
[39:54.800 --> 40:00.160]  the area know about that. That's going to be at 2 p.m. Central time. It's going to be
[40:00.160 --> 40:03.960]  noon Pacific time for the people who are out there. They're going to have a rally at the
[40:03.960 --> 40:10.120]  BLM offices. And after that information came out, the BLM said, well, we're going to close
[40:10.120 --> 40:14.760]  our offices. So it looks like the BLM is backing down. They're not in aggressive mode right
[40:14.760 --> 40:19.880]  now. They're not even going to have those offices open because of the protests. But
[40:19.880 --> 40:23.520]  it was an interesting press release from them. They said that, and they called on people,
[40:23.520 --> 40:27.920]  they said, they're calling on all miners, loggers, farmers, ranchers, and freedom lovers
[40:27.920 --> 40:33.000]  everywhere. It said, if you can't get to the BLM out there in Oregon, go to your local
[40:33.000 --> 40:39.560]  BLM office and protest what they're doing. Tell them that the people of this country
[40:39.560 --> 40:46.520]  are sick and tired of the way they've been conducting themselves. So today at noon Central,
[40:46.520 --> 40:50.240]  and I'm sorry, noon Pacific time, that'd be about 2 o'clock Central at the end of the
[40:50.240 --> 40:58.760]  show. Also, there was a lot of pushback against the Jade Helm here locally. Bastrop is the
[40:58.760 --> 41:04.480]  city that is just southeast of Austin. And that was the first one listed on the Jade
[41:04.480 --> 41:08.280]  Helm cities. There's been a lot of concern there. And I think that's actually made the
[41:08.280 --> 41:13.320]  drudge report, the fact that they're going to have another county commissioner meeting.
[41:13.320 --> 41:18.800]  And that's going to be this Monday, April 27th, for people to show up and express their
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.640]  concern about the military exercises that are being held there. They say this will,
[41:23.640 --> 41:27.600]  they will again present information to the county commissioners because they did this
[41:27.600 --> 41:32.000]  secretly and imprivately with nobody paying any attention to this a couple of months ago.
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.840]  That's what they did in all these locations. Now there's so many people in Bastrop that
[41:35.840 --> 41:40.640]  they're going to basically start their scyop operation a little bit before the exercise
[41:40.640 --> 41:42.280]  because they said this is a scyop operation.
[41:42.280 --> 41:46.920]  They need a running start. And people who will, you know, criticize us even questioning
[41:46.920 --> 41:51.760]  Jade Helm. It's not so much Jade Helm. It's the larger picture because you think about,
[41:51.760 --> 41:56.120]  I know you did a report about this, David, how they're running drills in Miami, Florida.
[41:56.120 --> 42:01.040]  What cave in Afghanistan looks like downtown Miami, Florida, doing drills in Minneapolis,
[42:01.040 --> 42:05.760]  doing drills in San Diego. What desert in Iraq looks like San Diego, California, you
[42:05.760 --> 42:10.680]  know, so it's just basic stuff. What are these guys training for? And when you ask this question
[42:10.680 --> 42:14.480]  or your conspiracy theory, it's like, I just really want to know, you know, you wouldn't
[42:14.480 --> 42:18.600]  put on football police and go run on a hardwood basketball court. You know, you train where
[42:18.600 --> 42:19.600]  you're going to deploy.
[42:19.600 --> 42:25.360]  And they said that in LA, when they were doing these drills in LA, they got on the local
[42:25.360 --> 42:27.560]  news and they were talking to the guy and he says, well, you train where you're going
[42:27.560 --> 42:30.600]  to find. If you're going to fight the mountains or the desert, that's where you train. We're
[42:30.600 --> 42:35.040]  training to fight here. And they were working in conjunction with the police. And so when
[42:35.040 --> 42:37.800]  we look at this drill right here, this is an article, we're going to talk to Paul Joseph
[42:37.800 --> 42:44.840]  Watson about this. These are some Marines now training in riot control. Why would you
[42:44.840 --> 42:51.080]  have Marines training in riot control? This is very disturbing, but it's all part of a
[42:51.080 --> 42:53.480]  pattern that we've seen going back. You talked about the report we did. That was back in
[42:53.480 --> 42:58.400]  2013. And of course, last year, Joe Biggs and I went to one of the places where they
[42:58.400 --> 43:05.000]  were training in AP Hill. There's a separate base inside of AP Hill that was fenced off.
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.440]  We walked through that. And here's the thing, Jakari, if they want to train for urban warfare,
[43:09.440 --> 43:13.200]  they've been doing that in the past. They have these burned out, bombed out building
[43:13.200 --> 43:17.880]  shells that they can go around and they can practice going building to building. But when
[43:17.880 --> 43:25.560]  you go to the asymmetric warfare center in AP Hill, this is a completely intact city.
[43:25.560 --> 43:27.400]  Yes. Okay. Completely intact.
[43:27.400 --> 43:30.480]  At a subway. The traffic lights were working. Yeah, they had the subway. They had all the
[43:30.480 --> 43:36.120]  different transportation modes there. And of course, in Camp Lejeune, they have, that's
[43:36.120 --> 43:39.320]  where the Marine base is, they have another city that they train with there. That's why
[43:39.320 --> 43:44.420]  it's not a surprise for me to see that the Marines are working on crowd control and riot
[43:44.420 --> 43:49.240]  gear there because the one that they have at Camp Lejeune is a more rural setting. There
[43:49.240 --> 43:55.640]  is more suburban stuff. It's also farm areas, but it's very much American. When we were
[43:55.640 --> 44:01.160]  at AP Hill at the asymmetric warfare center, we stood at the corner of first in Maine.
[44:01.160 --> 44:04.800]  We saw traffic lights that were operational. They are trained to go through a city that
[44:04.800 --> 44:09.400]  hasn't been attacked, isn't part of a war zone. And I very much object to this, but
[44:09.400 --> 44:13.200]  this is what the Jade Helm exercise is. It's moving this out to the next level. We're seeing
[44:13.200 --> 44:18.240]  this happening everywhere. Part of this is a Psyop, the entire thing is at the very least
[44:18.240 --> 44:24.240]  a Psyop operation to get troops used to operating in America on the streets and to get the people
[44:24.240 --> 44:29.480]  of America used to seeing them on the streets, just as if we were living in a banana republic
[44:29.480 --> 44:35.920]  with nuclear weapons, which we are. Let's talk about this announcement that Obama had
[44:35.920 --> 44:42.320]  today saying that they very much regret and there's absolutely the press secretary, Josh
[44:42.320 --> 44:47.640]  Ernest said there's no amount of regret that I can express that would be sufficient to
[44:47.640 --> 44:54.400]  cover these Americans and Italian that died, innocent people when they attacked Al Qaeda
[44:54.400 --> 44:59.640]  terrorists with their drone strikes. And yet we have never seen any apologies about the
[44:59.640 --> 45:03.640]  people who lived there, the men, women and children. We see these pictures of them blown
[45:03.640 --> 45:10.400]  to death, their bodies blown apart, horrific pictures, but never any apologies, never any
[45:10.400 --> 45:15.040]  regrets. It's why we are hated throughout the world. And justly so, when we allow our
[45:15.040 --> 45:19.680]  government to do this sort of thing, we all have culpability in this. This isn't just
[45:19.680 --> 45:25.240]  Obama's issue. And let me tell you, this is going to intensify under a republican president.
[45:25.240 --> 45:29.760]  We've got Lindsey Graham bragging about the number of people that they've gotten and
[45:29.760 --> 45:34.120]  he could care less about the innocent lives loss and he wants to step this up.
[45:34.120 --> 45:39.200]  That's exactly right. Because David almost said Alex, but you're embodying Alex here
[45:39.200 --> 45:43.160]  with your rant. Yeah, because they do these drones and actually the guys have the peace.
[45:43.160 --> 45:47.920]  I think it's one of the best pieces we produced my time here at info wars. I didn't have anything
[45:47.920 --> 45:52.960]  to do with it, but it's Obama orders, children murdered. I believe Rob do put it together.
[45:52.960 --> 45:56.600]  It's a very powerful piece. If you haven't watched it, go to YouTube and check it out.
[45:56.600 --> 46:01.760]  Obama orders, children murdered and he goes through, I believe is 2012, 2013 when he made
[46:01.760 --> 46:06.400]  it, but he goes through and list all these drone strikes that were just available to
[46:06.400 --> 46:10.040]  us at the time. And actually, David, I have a few articles if I can go over and they should
[46:10.040 --> 46:15.600]  embed that. They should embed that in the article that we've got about up on info wars
[46:15.600 --> 46:19.320]  about Obama's announcement today. They should put Rob do's report in there if they haven't
[46:19.320 --> 46:20.320]  already done that.
[46:20.320 --> 46:23.400]  Yes. And I just have a few things I want to point out here. I have this report from the
[46:23.400 --> 46:30.680]  Guardian 41 men targeted, but 1,147 people killed. US drone strikes the facts on the
[46:30.680 --> 46:36.200]  ground. And this is just one of the many reports that you can see. You can see the reports
[46:36.200 --> 46:40.360]  of the children murdered just right behind you, David. You can see all these facts popping
[46:40.360 --> 46:45.720]  up on the screen talking about all these innocent people who have been killed. Also the famous
[46:45.720 --> 46:49.680]  wedding party, the wedding party that became a funeral that we're out there looking for,
[46:49.680 --> 46:55.040]  you know, the insurgents or whoever, and they strike a drone. I say, strike a wedding party,
[46:55.040 --> 46:59.680]  kill the people in the party like oops. And that's pretty much all you get. And then Obama
[46:59.680 --> 47:03.800]  gets up there and the press conference last year, whatever it was, he gives that, you
[47:03.800 --> 47:08.200]  know, weak statement like, yeah, we have killed innocent civilians in our campaign, but we're
[47:08.200 --> 47:09.200]  going to continue.
[47:09.200 --> 47:13.400]  And the thing about this is, is they're trying to perfect their technology, you know, in
[47:13.400 --> 47:17.480]  a live theater, you know, they're not out in some, you know, desert base, you know,
[47:17.480 --> 47:22.120]  blowing up dummies. They're out there targeting real people, hoping that they improve their
[47:22.120 --> 47:23.120]  aim, so to speak.
[47:23.120 --> 47:27.640]  Well, look at that video that was the one that got Manning put in jail that went through
[47:27.640 --> 47:33.200]  WikiLeaks where they saw them. You could see the footage from the helicopter from the
[47:33.200 --> 47:38.160]  helicopter at a distance and they're looking at the people there and one of them is a reporter.
[47:38.160 --> 47:43.080]  They're shooting these people in cold blood without any empathy whatsoever, waiting for
[47:43.080 --> 47:47.280]  the responders to come, a hospital truck trying to take these people out and shooting that
[47:47.280 --> 47:48.280]  to peace.
[47:48.280 --> 47:49.280]  Yeah, a gentleman.
[47:49.280 --> 47:52.600]  Absolutely horrific. You know, they were shooting that camera guys who had cameras.
[47:52.600 --> 47:53.600]  Yes.
[47:53.600 --> 47:58.640]  And then a gentleman pulls up with his family and his vehicle and he tries to help the
[47:58.640 --> 48:01.720]  men out. And then they start shooting at the guy with the kids in his car. And then you
[48:01.720 --> 48:05.080]  can hear one of the guys in the helicopter say, well, don't bring your kid to a war zone.
[48:05.080 --> 48:08.680]  They live in a freaking war zone. It's not like they live here in Austin. They don't
[48:08.680 --> 48:10.040]  like Austin. They can go down to San Antonio.
[48:10.040 --> 48:13.920]  They didn't bring their kids to a war zone. The American government brought the war zone
[48:13.920 --> 48:14.920]  to their kids.
[48:14.920 --> 48:15.920]  That's right.
[48:15.920 --> 48:20.120]  And they have absolutely just cold blooded killing. And of course, what happened in the
[48:20.120 --> 48:23.800]  wake of that? Well, the people who exposed it, they came after them. They came after
[48:23.800 --> 48:28.560]  Julian Assange. They came after Manning put him in jail. Let's run this clip from Judge
[48:28.560 --> 48:32.800]  Napolitano when you guys get this up there about the drone strikes killing more people
[48:32.800 --> 48:33.800]  than Boko Haram.
[48:33.800 --> 48:40.480]  We got that. Yeah, let me know when you get that. I'm absolutely amazed when I see this.
[48:40.480 --> 48:46.800]  And yes, okay, they should apologize for killing innocent people. But where is the regret for
[48:46.800 --> 48:52.320]  what they're doing on a daily basis? And where can we stop this? We can't turn to the Republican
[48:52.320 --> 48:53.320]  Party.
[48:53.320 --> 48:57.720]  Nobody in the Democrat Party is stopping them. Let's play that clip from Judge Napolitano.
[48:57.720 --> 49:04.520]  The president's drones have killed more young women than these crazies from Boko Haram have
[49:04.520 --> 49:05.520]  kidnapped.
[49:05.520 --> 49:09.800]  So the president does not have what we call clean hands when it comes to this.
[49:09.800 --> 49:15.080]  No, he doesn't have clean hands. He doesn't have a clean conscience. And America can't
[49:15.080 --> 49:19.440]  have a clean conscience on this either. It's absolutely horrific. It's just one of the
[49:19.440 --> 49:24.360]  many instances where our government now openly violates the law, whether it's confiscating
[49:24.360 --> 49:29.240]  people's cars and cash on the highway, whether it's assassinating people abroad, they simply
[49:29.240 --> 49:32.720]  don't care what they do. There's not any shame.
[49:32.720 --> 49:37.160]  As I pointed out earlier, we had the church committee hearings. People were mortified
[49:37.160 --> 49:43.720]  to see the gun that the CIA director was holding up and talking about how they could, special
[49:43.720 --> 49:47.880]  guns that they would use for assassination in the many different ingenious ways that
[49:47.880 --> 49:52.480]  they were killing people. And so what they did was they created the Foreign Intelligence
[49:52.480 --> 49:57.360]  Surveillance Act. And now they're using the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the
[49:57.360 --> 50:02.360]  court and the judge as a kangaroo court, that the FISA court is a kangaroo court to
[50:02.360 --> 50:08.560]  give them blanket authorization to go after everybody. They go in with just one judge
[50:08.560 --> 50:14.640]  and one order and that authorizes a dragnet spying across the country on all these different
[50:14.640 --> 50:21.040]  cell phone providers. That's where we've gotten. No due process. The Constitution doesn't
[50:21.040 --> 50:25.480]  apply. And no matter how bad it is, they're never ashamed of anything they do.
[50:25.480 --> 50:29.160]  No. And when they get caught, you know, nothing happens to them. You know, but first it was
[50:29.160 --> 50:32.920]  a conspiracy theory that this stuff was happening. Then you find out that it's true. Now people
[50:32.920 --> 50:36.360]  don't care. You know, and it's, it's the thing. I guess they're doing a really good
[50:36.360 --> 50:40.280]  job with the scythe of getting people conditioned to it before they actually admit it. So then
[50:40.280 --> 50:42.520]  by the time it's admitted, people are like, I don't care.
[50:42.520 --> 50:45.880]  Yeah. Well, we're going to come back. Stay with us right after the break. We're going
[50:45.880 --> 50:51.020]  to talk about a new comic book called Rebels. And Jakari is going to break that down for
[50:51.020 --> 51:03.320]  us. Stay with us. We'll be right back here. That's the sound of a house being trashed

[54:07.440 --> 54:14.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, hosting today and with me is
[54:14.560 --> 54:21.040]  Jakari Jackson Studio. We've been talking about Obama's newest drone casualties. He
[54:21.040 --> 54:24.200]  had a press conference this morning. We're going to talk in this segment about an article
[54:24.200 --> 54:29.960]  that's up on Infowars.com. 1776 comes to comic books. It's a new comic book called
[54:29.960 --> 54:35.080]  Rebels. There's an article up there, an interview that Jakari had with the author of the comic
[54:35.080 --> 54:38.440]  book. We've got a copy of the comic book right there. But before we do, I want to let you
[54:38.440 --> 54:46.240]  know that we have specials at theinfowarsstore.com. We have 10% off of all pro pure water filters.
[54:46.240 --> 54:50.520]  It's great time to prepare right now. Use the promo code water to get 10% off of all

[55:10.480 --> 55:11.480]  silver.
[55:11.480 --> 55:15.760]  Okay, Jakari, let's talk about this comic book that you've got. Of course, we've got
[55:15.760 --> 55:20.000]  Paul Joseph Watson coming up with us in the next hour. And we're going to talk about an
[55:20.000 --> 55:26.160]  interesting interview with Robert Downey Jr. Promoting the Avengers coming up next week.
[55:26.160 --> 55:30.600]  But let's talk about this comic book now. This is set in 1776.
[55:30.600 --> 55:36.160]  1775. They're getting ready for the war for independence. And I had a chance to speak
[55:36.160 --> 55:41.800]  with the author of the piece, Brian Wood. And for anybody who's interested in it, it's
[55:41.800 --> 55:44.960]  basically the story of the militia getting ready, gearing up for the war against the
[55:44.960 --> 55:49.480]  redcoats. But it goes beyond that. Brian was very quick to point out that it goes to the
[55:49.480 --> 55:53.080]  social issues, the things kind of led up to it. It's not just about them fighting the
[55:53.080 --> 55:57.320]  redcoats. It's about all the things led up to it and the other things that happen around
[55:57.320 --> 55:58.320]  it.
[55:58.320 --> 56:02.120]  So I think it's a pretty interesting piece. You know, it's a piece of a historical fiction.
[56:02.120 --> 56:05.600]  It's definitely a fictional tale, but it's kind of the type of entertainment you can
[56:05.600 --> 56:08.800]  be educated while you're enjoying it, but it's not, you know, after school special,
[56:08.800 --> 56:13.440]  you know, kind of bland and dry. So I think it's enjoyable piece. Anybody's interested
[56:13.440 --> 56:14.440]  in it.
[56:14.440 --> 56:17.280]  The history series that they had was laughable. We started to watch it. And I think we turned
[56:17.280 --> 56:23.040]  it off maybe about two minutes into it. It was so ridiculous. We had read the reviews
[56:23.040 --> 56:30.200]  of it, people saying it was an anachronism and really poorly shot. And we started watching
[56:30.200 --> 56:35.440]  it as like, Oh, this is awful. It's interesting that they don't do very many movies about
[56:35.440 --> 56:40.920]  the American Revolution. I remember we, you know, when we had a video store, we had not
[56:40.920 --> 56:45.440]  just an action series section, we would have sections about different wars and we would
[56:45.440 --> 56:50.800]  even subdivide it to that point. We couldn't find but about two or three videos that are
[56:50.800 --> 56:54.000]  you know, movies that have been done about the American Revolution. We got the Patriot
[56:54.000 --> 57:00.840]  from Mel Gibson. We've got, I think it was Johnny Tremaine from Disney. There really wasn't
[57:00.840 --> 57:08.320]  much stuff out. There was a musical 1776 that was pretty hard to watch, but it's very rare
[57:08.320 --> 57:11.720]  that it that it's there. And when you see something like the history channel that they
[57:11.720 --> 57:17.200]  did, it was just an excuse to have a period action piece and had absolutely nothing going
[57:17.200 --> 57:18.200]  on to it.
[57:18.200 --> 57:23.000]  It's interesting to see that. Yeah. And I'm very excited about it. And anybody who's
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.760]  interested can see the interview with the author, Brian Wood on infowars.com. And you
[57:27.760 --> 57:31.640]  know, it's interesting as we look at, as I mentioned, we're going to talk about the
[57:31.640 --> 57:38.200]  political aspects and the way that Robert Downey Jr. was shamed for having said something
[57:38.200 --> 57:42.640]  about conservatives and liberals in this interview when he was promoting the Avengers
[57:42.640 --> 57:47.120]  coming up. It's interesting next year, they're going to have in the Avengers series, it's
[57:47.120 --> 57:51.000]  going to be Civil War. Yes. And you know comic books. And you know that when they came up
[57:51.000 --> 57:56.240]  with the Civil War series, it was done in reaction to the Patriot Act. Yes. And the
[57:56.240 --> 58:00.640]  idea that they were going to violate people's privacy, that they passed a law saying that
[58:00.640 --> 58:06.480]  all the superheroes are going to have to unmask. And so it sets up a conflict between Captain
[58:06.480 --> 58:12.360]  America and Iron Man, where Iron Man becomes the face of the military industrial complex.
[58:12.360 --> 58:18.680]  Well, he already is. He goes fire on the pillar. Yeah, he wins the Sheldon Maddelson primary,
[58:18.680 --> 58:22.960]  I guess, backing him in the Civil War. So, well, thank you very much, Shakar Jackson.
[58:22.960 --> 58:27.120]  And we're going to be back in the next hour with Paul Joseph Watson. We're going to talk
[58:27.120 --> 58:33.360]  about that interview with Robert Downey Jr. as well as the Marines training to take on
[58:33.360 --> 58:44.800]  Americans on the street. Stay with us. We'll be right back. Thank you for listening to
[58:44.800 --> 58:53.440]  GCN. Visit GCN Live.com today. Hi, I'm Alex Jones. When I got on air 20 years ago, I
[58:53.440 --> 58:58.920]  weighed 180 pounds. I lift weights five days a week. I could swim two, three miles. Then
[58:58.920 --> 59:03.240]  I discovered the New World Order, the globalist, their agenda. I started an access television
[59:03.240 --> 59:09.240]  show. I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[59:09.240 --> 59:15.800]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes. I transformed from looking like a white Bruce
[59:15.800 --> 59:22.160]  Lee to looking like a job of the hut. So I began a journey five years ago to shed the
[59:22.160 --> 59:28.120]  almost 100 pounds. I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in
[59:28.120 --> 59:33.520]  just a few weeks. When I added to the mix, the key products developed by Dr. Grubb for
[59:33.520 --> 59:39.240]  infowarslife.com, the results were incredible. Take the infowarslife.com challenge today

[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:29.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight, your host. With me in this segment
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:34.680]  is Jacarie Jackson. We've been talking about a variety of issues in this segment. I want
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:37.760]  to talk to him about something he covered last night on the Nightly News. And of course,
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.600]  if you're not a subscriber to the Nightly News, please consider becoming a subscriber
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.640]  to Prison Planet TV. It helps to support our operation. You can share it with 20 people
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:50.120]  at the same time. They can all view the Nightly News every night as it happens, Monday through
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:55.120]  Friday, and also have access to all of Alex Jones' documentaries. But it's a big help
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.440]  to support our operation. But last night, Jacarie, when you were hosting the Nightly
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:04.400]  News, you talked about this article. The VA's office is colluding with the FBI and the ATF
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:10.040]  to disarm vets. That's right. So, basically, if you're a veteran and you go to the VA, even
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:14.120]  if you have the most benign reason, you just happen to mention to the doctor, I'm having
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:19.800]  difficulty balancing my checkbook, that's somehow now a red flag for gun confiscation.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.600]  You can't be trusted. You're having difficulty sleeping or whatever. Oh, okay. They can just
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.800]  merely one person can label you. And then once they label you in the system, now they're
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:33.040]  sharing that information with the FBI. With the FBI and the NICS background check system.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.760]  So if you guys go to any gun store, you go to Cabela's, you go to Academy, wherever to
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.960]  buy your firearm, now this information is going to be included in that background check
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.920]  and could potentially cost you the right to purchase a firearm. And it's very interesting
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:50.560]  to me, David, that they all send these guys overseas to die, to fight for their country.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:55.040]  But the guys who survive, they come back and they try any excuse to take away your firearm.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.440]  They come back and they tell you, you can't worship the gods you want at Fort Hood. It's
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.720]  completely ridiculous what they're doing to our veterans.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:05.160]  As he points out in this article that we have up on Infowars.com says, the VA will provide
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:12.360]  an encrypted compact disc exchanged via mail to the FBI no less than quarterly. Inclusion
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:17.440]  in the national instant criminal background check system. That's the NICS you're talking
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.560]  about. And this is a comment from one of the veterans that's in the article. He said, what
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.800]  concerns me is basically they've taken away constitutional rights without due process.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:29.680]  They said they would maintain all this information in only the VA database. So if she were to
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.200]  go out and get a firearm, they said, sure, but we found out that they send all that
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:39.480]  information to the FBI and the ATF. They basically lied to us. It's like a no fly list. Once
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.360]  you get on it, you cannot get off.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.520]  That's right. Because David, you remember when everybody was talking about these gun
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:49.520]  registries, everybody wanted you to believe that, oh, we're going to take your information,
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.640]  but we're just going to keep it in this one little box. With regards to where you went,
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.160]  you went to the doctor with Obamacare, whatever. This just going to stay here and that's all
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.880]  it's going to happen to it. But now we see clear as day, even though we knew it was going
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.840]  to come down to this, is they're sharing your information with other people trying to take
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:06.240]  away your second amendment rights.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:13.040]  And I remember in the wake of some of these mass shootings, hearing Republicans, conservatives,
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:20.200]  even the NRA, pushing the idea that we needed to tie into psychiatrist database and medical
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:23.960]  databases. And I think we needed to screen people for this. And at the time I said they're
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:29.680]  going to misuse this, they're going to, this is just the opinion of one person, basically
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.480]  can take away your civil rights without any due process whatsoever. That's the danger
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.480]  of this.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:40.400]  And lo and behold, you go to the doctor and there's somebody who just hates guns in general.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.400]  Yes.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.000]  And now they're like, well, you don't need a gun in the first place, but now I'm going
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.680]  to deem you mentally deficient, mentally incompetent to even own a firearm.
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.680]  Yes.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.840]  And who gets to decide? And that's the thing that people don't understand is you have people
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.760]  who don't even like guns in the first place, trying to discredit you from owning one. So
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.760]  any little thing about you, you know, if, you know, you,
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.400]  Well, it's just, I can't even think of...
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.040]  It's just the opinion of one person.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.040]  And it's not a process. It's not that you've got a jury there, but of course they're confiscating
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.560]  people's property without even charging you. That's what we're talking about with civil
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.520]  asset forfeiture. We've talked about so much this last week. I mean, there's no due process
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.680]  with that. They don't have to charge you. They don't have to find you guilty. There's
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.920]  no presumption of innocence. And of course they charge the property, okay, with committing
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.480]  a crime and take that property.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:31.340]  So I think maybe the people who ought to be committed into an insane asylum are the people
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:36.320]  who wrote these laws charging property. They certainly ought to be put in jail. Thank you
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.000]  so much, Chikari, for joining us and stay with us in the next segment. We're going to
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:59.480]  have Paul Joseph Watson joining us from the UK. We'll be right back.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:04.040]  A great way to fight the Vax pushing big pharma propaganda comes from natural blaze's article.
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.320]  Parent offers epic response to vaccine homework. The brainwashing excerpt comes from a reading
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.600]  comprehension homework assignment titled medicine and reads sometimes during a checkup. The
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.680]  doctor will give you medicine that helps keep you from getting sick. This medicine is called
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:21.720]  a vaccine. A vaccine can keep you from getting measles, mumps and other illnesses. The diligent
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:25.200]  parent crossed out the reading assignment questions and wrote the following. Please send
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.120]  homework. I've decided not to have blank do this homework and will ask to not have her
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.480]  do school or homework on drugs and shots. This is a serious and complicated issue that
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:37.560]  should be between her parents and her healthcare provider. At her age, she cannot make the
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:41.880]  informed decisions about the risks. This appears to be propaganda. Author Heather Callahan
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:45.320]  concludes, if children are brainwashed to believe that vaccines are a necessary part
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:49.160]  of health, they'll never flinch at the idea of forced injections. She is correct and there
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.920]  appears to be a collusion between publishing, education and big pharma industries. Like
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.760]  you didn't know that already. Kudos to this parent for speaking out. Rob do for info wars

[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:07.560]  type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:12.800]  formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus. All of our children are
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:18.280]  hit with modern mind control. Television music, fast food, GMOs, sugars you name it. Young
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:23.320]  humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.240]  concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:32.840]  psychotropic drugs. Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:37.520]  quality ingredients that children would actually like and take. We worked with the leading manufacturer

[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:18.720]  to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host today on this Thursday, April 23rd,
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:24.240]  2015. And of course we've been talking to Jakari Jackson about the Obama announcement
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:30.800]  of the collateral damage. The innocent people who were killed back in January, three Americans
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:35.880]  and Italian. And of course saying that they very much regret that that happened. Making
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.760]  a formal apology about it. Never making an apology for the thousands that they've killed.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:45.360]  The open criminality I think is the theme that we see today running throughout the news.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.480]  And certainly what I see. The fact that we've got a government that not only moved to hold
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:55.280]  a gun to our heads to force us to buy insurance in ways and means that we didn't necessarily
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.480]  want taking away our choice on that. Now they're holding a gun to our head to take away our
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.760]  choice and medication. They've already held a gun to our heads and stolen property from
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:07.200]  us on the streets. Civil asset forfeiture where they don't charge us with a crime. They just
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.640]  take that. We've also got the government who is openly spying on us. Without apologies,
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:18.520]  without regret, regrets and without making any excuses about how they're violating their
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:24.600]  oath to the Constitution. And so when I look at all that, I see this news about cities that
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:30.920]  are robbing people by shortening the yellow light times. And to me, even though that may
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:35.400]  sound like a small thing to you, this is a lot of money. And this really hits us where
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:39.960]  we live. And I think if we look at some of these things that are close to us, we can
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:44.400]  wake people up who are basically asleep to the larger issues, who don't really understand
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:50.440]  how they're putting together a complete infrastructure of tyranny and connecting all the pieces together.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:54.360]  That's not just the secret trade agreements. They're putting all of the pieces together.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:59.400]  That's what we're going to be talking to Paul Watson about when he joins us as we see them
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:04.320]  training to take on Americans in the streets with the military. If we do wake up, if there
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:09.920]  is some kind of a catastrophe or an economic collapse, they are going to use the iron
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.880]  fist against us. That's what they're training for. But just take a look at this kind of
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:18.880]  corruption. This kind of in-your-face corruption. We've got six cities caught shortening yellow
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.680]  lights. Is this one where you live? Chattanooga, Tennessee. And Chattanooga. And this is what
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:27.520]  most of them are doing. Typically, they've got about a four-second time period from
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:32.400]  when it goes from yellow to red. And what they typically do in these scams that the
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.040]  cities are running, they shorten it by about a second. Take it down to like three seconds.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:41.040]  They say the city of Chattanooga was forced to refund $8,800 in red light camera tickets
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:46.280]  issued to motorists trapped by an illegally short yellow time. So they have a legal limit
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.880]  as to what that's supposed to be. And the reason that's there is because it makes it
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:53.720]  a lot more dangerous if you shorten it up to red lights. People will slam on their brakes
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.760]  and get rear-ended. And that's what we see happening with these red light cameras. So
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.320]  it's not just a racket that they're doing, but it's also a racket that makes it more
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:06.360]  dangerous on the street. And it's a racket that they do in cooperation with corporations.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:11.000]  We've got LaserCraft in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The private vendor that runs the camera program
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.520]  in return for a cut of the profits. There you go. Give me a cut of the loop. And they
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:22.360]  lied to them. They lied to the judge when they took this into court. The judge, however,
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.840]  went out to this one particular intersection in question and he timed it himself. I said,
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:32.720]  you guys are lying. Now, Dallas, Texas, the city's second highest revenue producing camera,
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:38.200]  the second highest, they did the same thing. They shortened it. They got 9407 tickets worth
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:47.160]  over $705,000 in just eight months in 2007. Crime pays, doesn't it? Also, Springfield,
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:51.880]  Missouri is another one. Lubbock, Texas, Nashville, Tennessee. And Nashville, Tennessee, the way
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:58.600]  they found it in 2006, was a resident there. Joe Savage obtained data on every red light
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:04.440]  running ticket issued on Broadway Street since 2000. You can shut it down. One person can
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.680]  shut this down, especially if we stand together. But this was a major factor, even going back
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:13.320]  to the recent election in Chicago where Rahm Emanuel was running for reelection. He was
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:19.440]  forced into a runoff and the guy who was running against him, I think his name was Chewy Garcia,
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:24.840]  made it a big issue. Now the Illinois House has voted to ban red light cameras except
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:31.000]  in Chicago. Chicago gets an exception. The reason they say is because this is municipalities
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.920]  that don't have home rule. In other words, they have less of a population than 25,000
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:41.880]  people. They say that the Chicago Tribune did a report. It triggered a federal investigation
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:48.520]  and allegations that the Chicago camera company was involved in a $2 million bribery scheme
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:53.240]  and the alleged bag man in the scheme has pled guilty to bribery. They have also indicted
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:59.520]  the former CEO of the since fired vendor, Red Flex Traffic Systems. So we'll see what
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:05.840]  happens with that. But nevertheless, they have made a lot of money. Just in Chicago,
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.880]  there are millions of tickets that have been done in the last several years. And when they
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:14.800]  shorten up these lights, that's the way they rob you on the streets. Again, I'm reminded
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:18.640]  of the fact that Lysander Spooner said the difference between the government and a highway
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:23.520]  robber is the highway robber steals your money and leaves you alone. But the government
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.480]  takes your money and then follows you nagging you down the road.
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:34.080]  We also have an election coming up. And there's people who are tossing their hat in to the
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.560]  ring pretty much every day. One of the people who came out yesterday, it was reported on
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:43.360]  Dredge Report. This is Carly here, her roar. He linked to this article from Eleanor Cliff.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:49.120]  Of course, Eleanor Cliff is not a Republican. So she's kind of harsh on Carly. But if you
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:53.960]  hear her in her own words, it's bad enough. It's one of the most sexist things I've ever
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:54.960]  seen.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:00.040]  Now, she's saying that she's going to take away the gender card from Hillary Clinton.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:05.120]  And she says she's not going to allow Hillary Clinton to run on identity politics. Vote
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.960]  for me simply because I'm a woman. We're hearing that all the time. And yet, listen to what
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:16.000]  Carly Fiorina said, or Fiorina, let's say, is her name Fiorina? Yeah, Fiorina, sorry.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.280]  She's in California. She ran for Senate there. She couldn't even beat Barbara Boxer. I don't
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.360]  think she's going to be able to beat Hillary Clinton.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.320]  But this is what she said. Carly said, get women involved in any problem and the problem
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:34.120]  gets better. Can you imagine if a man were to say that in reverse? Get a man involved
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.480]  in a problem and the problem gets better. The data is clear. That's what she said.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:42.440]  She says, it's not that we haven't seen a man's judgment clouded by hormones in the
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:48.560]  Oval Office in a not so veiled reference to Bill Clinton. But of course, he also pushed
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:54.320]  back against claims that she didn't have any experience in government. She says, well,
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:59.560]  I'm not a political, not a professional politician. Well, the only reason she's not is because
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:04.720]  she couldn't beat Barbara Boxer. But then she gives her qualifications. She says that she
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:10.400]  has worked on consulting gigs with the State Department and the CIA. Well, I guess she's
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.800]  eminently qualified if she worked for the CIA because that's the way the entire government
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.160]  works now is that everything is a national security secret.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:26.080]  Of course, we've also got a massive case of hypocrisy going on at MSNBC. We've got multiple
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:31.640]  people now. It's up to four. This is the fourth one who's come out with, you know, they're
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:36.040]  constantly pushing big government, constantly pushing wealth redistribution. And yet these
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:41.000]  people apparently are not paying their taxes, even though they're telling you that you need
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.440]  to pay your taxes and redistribute income. But it's nothing compared to what the Clintons
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:50.760]  are doing. Reuters did an investigation on their own of the Hillary Clinton and Bill
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:56.160]  Clinton Foundation. And they found that the family's charities are refilling, are refiling
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:01.880]  at least five annual tax returns after they found errors in how they reported donations
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:06.800]  from governments. And they say they may audit other Clinton Foundation returns in case of
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.840]  other errors. Now, for three years in a row, beginning in 2010, the Clinton Foundation reported
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:18.480]  to the IRS that they had received zero funds from foreign and U.S. governments. Those entries
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:25.680]  were untrue. Actually, several foreign governments had contributed tens of millions of dollars
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.840]  to the Clintons. And it's interesting that not only is Reuters doing this investigation,
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:34.800]  but the New York Times is looking at this as well. We've got the book that's coming
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:41.520]  along and they referred to this book, Clinton Cash, that's going to be released shortly.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:48.200]  But they also did a full article about another pay for play scandal. Cash flowed to Clinton
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:53.520]  Foundation as Russians pressed for control of uranium company. And I gotta say that when
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:59.560]  the New York Times is piling on to the Clintons, they're in big trouble. I still think she's
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:04.280]  going to come out of this, but it certainly looks like even the establishment liberal
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:10.520]  press is coming after her big time. Listen to what happened back in January 2013, they
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:15.480]  say. There was an article that detailed how the Russian Atomic Energy Agency, Rosatom,
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:21.800]  or Ros Adam, had taken over a Canadian company with uranium mining stakes that went from
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:26.960]  Central Asia to the American West. Now, this has made it one of the largest uranium producers
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:32.280]  in the world. And when the Russians took this over, it brought Putin closer to the goal
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:38.760]  of controlling the global uranium supply chain. But the untold story they say behind this
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:44.920]  is one that involves not just Vladimir Putin, but also Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:49.200]  At the heart of the tale, they say, are several men who are leaders of the Canadian mining
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:54.200]  industry who are major donors to Bill Clinton and his family. They eventually sold all this
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:18:00.240]  off to the Russians. They created a company called Uranium One. Now, the reason that the
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.680]  State Department got involved with this is because, of course, uranium is considered
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:09.040]  to be a strategic mineral with national security implications. So it had to be approved by
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:13.840]  a lot of different government agencies, including the State Department. And the interesting
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:20.000]  thing about it is that when Hillary Clinton's State Department approved this, they immediately
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.600]  received donations from these Canadian mining executives. And this is something that is
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:31.680]  going to be explored in detail in the upcoming book, Clinton Cash. But as I point out, the
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:39.160]  Clinton Foundation right now has $250 million in assets. And here's the punchline at the
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:43.000]  very end of the article. They talk about how, well, they looked at this and there was supposed
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:49.400]  to be no export allowed of this uranium. That's how they justified this. That didn't happen.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:53.480]  They're exporting it to a lot of different countries. And they have changed, they've
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:19:01.960]  taken the company private and they have changed the name to ARMS. ARMZ. There you go. Right
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:08.720]  out in the open. That's what I say. The corruption and the pay for play is right out in the open.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:13.520]  One of the things that we always look at this, of course, is to know that elections are an
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:18.160]  advanced auction of stolen goods. As I've mentioned before, that was what H.L. Meakin
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:22.960]  pointed out, and it is even more true today. It's always been true. But it's also not
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:29.000]  just buying influence before things happen, but it is also now quite clearly a selection,
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.840]  more than it is an election. We just pointed out yesterday that we've got a lot of Republican
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.640]  candidates that are going to be going to the Koch brothers to get donations. Well, of course
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:44.440]  there's something called the Sheldon primary. Yes. And we're going to talk about that when
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:48.680]  we come back. A very rich casino operator who spent nearly a hundred million dollars
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:52.880]  on the last election. He has his own personal primary because there's a pot of gold at the
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:59.680]  bottom. Say with us, we'll be right back.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:04.480]  It's very easy to be a criminal. All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:09.560]  tool, a pair of scissors. If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:14.520]  scissors, then you're making it easy for him. Almost every home security system, even
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:20.280]  those sold by big name companies has a weakness. The phone line you shell out 1500 bucks, get
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:25.200]  locked into a long term contract and think you're safe. But a burglar can destroy your
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:30.960]  alarm in seconds with one snip. And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:40.400]  a wireless connection to call the cops. Scissors can't cut it. And that means your home stays

[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:34.440]  He went to an interview in the U.K. where the guy tried to shame him and out him as
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:38.360]  a conservative. We're going to play that for you and let Paul break that down with some
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:41.900]  comments. Before we go to Paul real quickly, I want to let you know that we have Silver

[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.440]  thanks for joining us. Hi, David. Good to be back.
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:10.000]  Let's start out real quickly. Let's just run this clip and we'll get your comments on it.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.400]  This is Robert Downey Jr., of course, as a part of his promo tour for Avengers 2 coming
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:17.840]  out next week. Let's run this clip and see what this interviewer in the U.K. did to
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.640]  him. I mean, what I'd really like to ask you about
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:26.280]  a quote you gave to The New York Times. I don't want to pry, so if you don't want to
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:31.920]  talk about it, that's fine. But what you said to The New York Times once was it was after
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:39.400]  your incarceration. You said you can't go from a $2,000 a night hotel suite to a penitentiary
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:44.720]  and understand it. I'm kind of liberal. And I just wondered what you meant by that.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:50.800]  Well, the funny thing is, and I appreciate your point of view, things that you said
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.520]  five, seven years ago, or things you said in an interview that made sense to you at
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:00.080]  the time, I could pick that apart for two hours and not be no closer to the truth than
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:05.840]  I'd be giving you some half-assed answer right now. I couldn't even really tell you
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:11.600]  what a liberal is. So therein lies the answer to your question.
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:15.680]  The statement sort of stands by itself, doesn't it? I mean, does that mean you're not a liberal
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:20.760]  or that you came out of prison not being a liberal?
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:25.800]  Are we promoting a movie? To me, the thing is that I'm certainly not going to backpedal
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:30.640]  on anything I've said, but I wouldn't say, actually, I wouldn't say I'm a Republican
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:35.880]  or a liberal or Democrat. I think when I was talking to the person who was doing the interview
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:43.200]  that day, and that just happened to be my opinion. That's the nice thing, is you can
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.880]  have opinions and they kind of change and flow.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:49.360]  Yeah, well, that's life and that's growing older, I suppose, isn't it?
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.360]  Yeah.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.640]  I mean, you say we're promoting an interview, I mean, promoting the movie. I mean, obviously
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.440]  you're doing a promotional round of interviews, and that's why we're talking about the movie,
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:01.360]  but we also would like to talk a little bit about you, and I don't know how comfortable
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:05.000]  you are, you know, talking about yourself at the moment.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.120]  You have as much time as anyone else will.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:10.480]  Yeah, well, OK, well, then let me just ask you a few more questions and you can answer
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:12.560]  them if you want to and not if you don't want to.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.560]  Just looking over each other.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:19.480]  Well, I think we've got three more minutes on our agreement.
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:25.840]  Your face is starting to jump a little bit. You better get to your next question.
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:32.840]  The reason I'm asking you about the past is that you've talked in other interviews again
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:41.800]  about your relationship with your father and the role of all of that in, you know, the
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:47.520]  dark periods you entered and taking drugs and drinking and all of that. And I just wondered
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:53.960]  whether, you know, you think you're free of all of that or whether that's still something
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:54.960]  you need.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:55.960]  Well, what are we doing?
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:56.960]  Well, I'm just asking questions.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:02.200]  OK, at this point, he gets up and he walks off, Paul. Yeah. What about that? What are
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:04.880]  your comments on that, Paul? It's pretty amazing.
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:10.080]  Well, this guy, Christian and Guru Murphy, who is a vehement liberal, is known for these
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:14.680]  kind of got-your-interviews. He did one with Quentin Tarantino probably about a year ago
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:19.160]  where he pushed him over and over again on the question of violence. So he begins by
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:24.040]  saying, you know, I'll ask you this question. If you don't want to answer it, that's fine.
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:28.720]  Downey Jr. answers the question and then he keeps pushing it over and over again. And
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:35.400]  basically, behind the scenes, it's known that Downey Jr. is a conservative slash libertarian.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:42.800]  But in Hollywood, not being a liberal is a career killer. And James Woods, another famous
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:49.400]  actor, came out back in 2013 and said that he never expected to get any work again in
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:56.400]  Hollywood because he criticised our Lord and Saviour, Barack Obama. So the reaction to
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:00.800]  this interview, and at the end of it, Downey Jr. basically walks out because he starts
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.520]  asking him about his prior drug use and his relationship with his father when he was supposed
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:12.880]  to be there to promote a movie. The reaction is that this is basically conservative shaming.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:17.080]  I mean, he says, you know, over and over again, so you're not a liberal. You're not a liberal.
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:22.320]  He's trying to shame in Robert Downey Jr. into admitting that he's not a liberal. And
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:29.480]  this is a guy that has not injected politics into his career. He has these views privately.
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:35.240]  And yet there seems to be this obsession with this dominance in Hollywood of liberalism
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:39.960]  over conservatism to the point where holding any kind of conservative outlook.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:40.960]  How's that to be shamed?
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.200]  We've got to take a break. We're going to be right back. Yeah, he said at the very beginning
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:47.320]  of the interview, I appreciate your point of view. He wasn't fooled. He knew exactly
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:50.120]  where this guy was going. Stay with us. We're right back.

[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:29.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host and joining us from
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:35.400]  the UK is Paul Joseph Watson. We were just talking about him playing in the last segment,
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:40.640]  the clip with Robert Downey Jr. being interviewed in the UK. Immediately the guy comes out,
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:44.720]  starts asking him whether he's a conservative or a liberal. At the very beginning Paul,
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:48.960]  he said, yeah, I appreciate your point of view. In other words, like he knew exactly
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:53.840]  what this guy was doing, and then he tries to walk this back and says, hey, you know,
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:58.520]  you can have opinions, and they change over a period of time, but the guy just kept coming
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:04.840]  and coming. And as you point out, you need to be a overt liberal to work in Hollywood
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:08.880]  that works against your career very much so if you, they think that you're conservative
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:15.880]  or libertarian. I think it was interesting, Paul, the WikiLeaks posting of these Sony emails,
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:20.600]  the logo that's at the very top of the posting is, and there you can see it right now if
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:25.760]  you're watching, it shows Sony, and of course Sony has the Marvel rights, and it was Robert
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:31.280]  Downey Jr. was promoting The Avengers 2, another Marvel film, but Sony has the rights
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:36.120]  to Spider-Man. And so they show Spider-Man and he's lifting up his mask, and instead
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:42.040]  of a face, what you see is the donkey logo from the Democrat Party because that's what
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:46.480]  these emails show, Paul. They show that the Sony corporation has worked intimately with
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:52.520]  the Obama administration on issues like SOPA, TPP, the Transatlantic Partnership, also promoting
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:57.120]  with the interview, the assassination of the North Korean president, and they worked very
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:02.440]  closely, Paul, to get Obama elected, releasing zero dark 30 portraying Obama as being this
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:09.760]  decisive heroic leader who took out Osama bin Laden days before the election and promoting
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:14.080]  his torture programs in the process. Your comments, Paul.
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:21.960]  Hey, Paul. Okay, we don't have Paul. I think we've lost Paul on the feed there, guys.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:25.880]  I can hear you now, David. Okay, go ahead, Paul. Your comments.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:32.000]  Yeah, the whole tone of this interview was accusatory. It was about shaming Robert Downey
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:38.520]  Jr. into admitting, you know, God forbid that he's a conservative. And why that's important
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:44.280]  is because we know that Hollywood has vast influence over the minds of millions of Americans.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:50.080]  That's why the CIA, the US Army gets involved with these Hollywood blockbusters, in many
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:56.400]  cases, vets the scripts of top Hollywood films, because they know the influence that it wields
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:02.200]  culturally and in a narrative sense over the minds of millions of Americans. So it's,
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:07.280]  you know, Stephen Crowder wrote, quote, culture is upstream from politics and liberals know
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:11.760]  it. They have to, they have to protect and maintain their territory in Hollywood. People
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:18.680]  with dissenting viewpoints must be snuffed out. They don't want libertarians or conservatives
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:23.840]  who have influence in Hollywood and over their fans. I mean, you know, Robert Downey Jr.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.480]  is huge at the moment. He's in the Avengers. He's in Iron Man. They don't want those kind
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:34.400]  of people with that influence influencing the millions of Americans who watch their movies
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:41.120]  with differing political viewpoints than the standard progressivism that the usual Hollywood
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:47.360]  set propagates. And we know this because in LA, there's this secret underground, almost
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:54.680]  secret society network of 2000 people, a lot of actors, other people who work in Hollywood
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:37:00.880]  who are conservatives, but have to hide their political beliefs so as to maintain getting
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.720]  work in Hollywood. And that was revealed by Victoria Jackson, a former Saturday Night
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:12.240]  Live cast member. She revealed that to the Huffington Post in 2012. And then of course,
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:16.320]  he had James Woods saying that he would never get work again as a result of criticizing
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.320]  Obama.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.880]  So literally in Hollywood, there are libertarians and conservatives that have to conceal their
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:28.160]  political viewpoints because they know they won't get work. They will be discriminated
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:31.760]  against for not towing this, this leftist narrative.
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:38.040]  Yes, exactly. And we've seen, as we pointed out earlier this week, these revelations of
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:41.560]  the Sony emails. I mean, first, when we saw it in regards to the interview, we saw the
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:46.120]  State Department, the Rand Corporation, actively working with Sony saying, yeah, we need to
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.360]  put out this narrative. We need to show the assassination of Kim Jong-un so we can get
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:55.520]  that into the mindset of the South Koreans. And we know that those video, those DVDs will
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:59.720]  go across the border into South Korea. We can establish that with the South Koreans
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:00.720]  as well.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:05.200]  And we see all of this tight coordination between Sony and the Obama administration,
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:10.400]  not only just to get Obama reelected, but also to push their agenda. I think it was
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:14.880]  interesting when Robert Downey Jr. said, wait a minute, are we promoting a movie here? He
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:18.560]  said that in the interview. And that's the thing. People need to understand how the
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:23.400]  movies are being used to program us. And I think that's one of the valuable things we
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:27.720]  can get from looking at these Sony emails that have leaked out. Of course, one of the
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:32.600]  other things is the upcoming movie about Ed Snowden. That's going to be done by Sony.
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:36.760]  And they just edited the press release just this last week to say, well, don't say that
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:40.920]  they're criminally spying on people. Just say that it's controversial. Don't say that
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.320]  they're bugging people. Just say that they did various actions. I mean, they really
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:46.200]  toned that down in it.
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:51.400]  I think, Paul, when we look at Marvel Studios, they've done a much better job. I look at
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:55.760]  Captain America Winter Soldier. I can't imagine that movie being made, for example, by Sony.
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:00.400]  I mean, they expose Operation Paperclip. They're critical of ideas that have been put forward
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:04.560]  in the surveillance state, the criminal surveillance state, and look at the consequences of where
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:10.480]  this could all go to. I don't see that coming out of any of the mainline Hollywood studios.
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:14.880]  I think that's one of the reasons why Marvel Studios has been so successful.
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:21.320]  Yeah. And I think there's been a noticeable shift in Hollywood and in the movie industry
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:28.440]  10 years ago, in the few years after 9-11, there was a huge emphasis on statism and
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:33.880]  surveillance being good and everything being for the greater good. Over the past five,
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.880]  six, seven years, I think we've kind of seen that shift, like you mentioned with Captain
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:44.960]  America and other movies, where drones are not seen as a positive force and surveillance
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:49.600]  is not always seen as a positive force and we can't always trust the government. So there's
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:54.400]  been a shift, but there are still, for example, sitcoms. A lot of the propaganda is now more
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:59.920]  in sitcoms. We had a story a couple of months ago, a comedy central sitcom. I can't remember
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:06.880]  the name, but they had one of the main characters sitting there reading a website with a crazy
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:11.960]  headline, something about Elvis and Michael Jackson. I can't even remember. But the design
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:18.400]  of the website was a mirror image almost of Infowars.com. And then obviously, Alex talked
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:22.360]  about the other movie which completely failed. Again, I forget the name of it. I haven't
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:28.280]  watched it, where the guy's up ranting about Jews and the n-words and saying, I'm an Alex
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:33.040]  Jones listener. So we still see some of that propaganda, but in general, I think it's starting
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:38.600]  to shift in the movie industry, where more pro-liberty anti-surveillance messages are
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:43.440]  being put through. And obviously, they're very concerned about it, which is now why they're
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:47.120]  trying to shame people for holding libertarian viewpoints.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:52.200]  Yeah, I think it's very interesting, especially in the Captain America franchise. And I think
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:58.520]  it's going to take on a life of its own. Next year, they have the Civil War series. That's
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:03.600]  where Captain America is headed, this conflict between Iron Man, who represents the military
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:09.560]  industrial conflicts, and Captain America, who represents the America that used to have
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:13.440]  a rule of law, the America that used to respect civil liberties and the Constitution. And
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:18.960]  so that's going to be a very interesting story narrative as it's developing.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:23.840]  So I don't know, this particular one that's coming up next week, it may just be a popcorn
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:29.560]  movie, but it may have some of those themes in it. I think they've got so many different
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:32.720]  superheroes in it, they probably won't get into anything very deep like they do in the
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:35.920]  Captain America series. But again, I think that you're not going to see that kind of
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.640]  thing coming out of Sony. Out of Sony, you're going to see direct programming. So it kind
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:45.640]  of makes me wonder, I know Oliver Stone is a pretty opinionated director. He's got his
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:48.600]  own ideas about how he's going to do things. I wonder if there's going to be a big conflict
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:53.920]  between Sony and Oliver Stone as he does this Ed Snowden movie. We've already seen how they've
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:55.960]  censored the press release for it.
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:42:02.000]  Well, of course, there was already an Ed Snowden documentary released. I believe it was late
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.680]  last year, early this year called Citizen 4, which was excellent because it just told
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:11.920]  the story of basically what he went through and what happened. It wasn't, you know, dramatized
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:17.320]  or anything like that. And that was a really good documentary slash film. So, you know,
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:22.800]  Oliver Stone is obviously he's quite an extreme leftist, but in terms of surveillance, I think
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:27.560]  he's probably a good ally. So if he's behind it, I would expect it to be of quite high
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:28.560]  quality.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:33.240]  Yeah, I think he's pretty much in the same position as we are in terms of being alarmed
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:37.880]  at what our government is doing in terms of destroying the rule of law in terms of drag
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:42.360]  net surveillance. Let's talk about this other article that you've got up. Marines conduct
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:47.840]  riot control drill. Tell us a little bit about that. We'll play that video after you set
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:48.840]  it up.
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:53.680]  Yeah, this is about, this was another drill. Yeah, another drill. We've seen a spate of
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:59.560]  these in recent weeks out of Virginia, where they're basically training at the Naval Weapons
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:05.760]  Station in Yorktown, Virginia. Again, to take on angry protesters, it shows Marines with
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:11.920]  battens, pepper spray and rifles going toe to toe basically with these protesters who
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:17.560]  are throwing objects at them. And the interesting thing about this is the Marines themselves
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:23.240]  released the video. This is quite a high quality production. And again, they say this is only
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:30.280]  for overseas operations yet they're releasing the video for the consumption of the American
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:31.280]  public.
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.280]  Yeah.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:38.280]  This is just a private training course, a drill for overseas combat. Why do they feel
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:42.760]  the need to put it on the internet in the first place? What kind of message does that
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:43.760]  send?
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:49.920]  Right. Let's make it clear that the US military has never operated in terms of like on the
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:55.040]  ground, in the streets, troops to control riots whenever they occupy a country. And
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:59.680]  we go in like just as the British military would do, just as the Romans would do, they
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:03.680]  get local people to do that. That's why we have the Iraqi police that they created that
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:08.080]  they trained. So they're going to go in and they're going to not use Marines to do this
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:13.000]  kind of thing when they go into an occupied country. They're going to get the some citizens
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:18.560]  who will work as police for them to do this. So this is something that they're doing to
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:22.840]  train here for America. And we should be very, very concerned that this is something that's
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:26.920]  being done by the Marines. This is not even the National Guard. I mean, we just saw the
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:33.120]  National Guard in this Richmond, California exercise and they said it was a dirty bomb
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:38.480]  exercise that people who videotaped that and reported on that said they didn't see any
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:41.080]  exercises where people were being helped.
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:44.840]  Merely they had crowd control exercises. And of course, there was that person that we got
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:49.360]  a videotape of. They sent to us. He started saying that I'm a sovereign citizen. You don't
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:53.040]  have any authority over me. And then at that point, they charged them and started pushing
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:58.840]  them back. So now the Marines are doing this as well as well. Let's run that clip.
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:06.960]  They're all masked up together. They got shields. They got breaking news. This just and we just
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:12.480]  received a tip about an operational readiness exercise conducted at the Naval Weapon Station
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:17.080]  in Yorktown, Virginia. Marines training for riot control. That's right.
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:18.080]  We're doing tear gas.
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:24.520]  Marines training for riot control. For the usual, the exercise was given the cover story
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:30.480]  of overseas preparation. Sergeant Andrew S. Wilbur, a non-lethal weapons instructor,
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:35.960]  said of a similar exercise, quote, consider they are hypothetically operating within
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:41.360]  an embassy. However, as we've been following for weeks, public concerns are running high
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:47.560]  amidst the recent Fort Lauderdale FEMA camp roundup drills, Ontario, California martial
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:54.720]  law training. Participants in this latest training exercise were the Bravo Fleet Anti-Terrorism
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:46:00.900]  Security Team Company. Oddly, the high production footage you're seeing right now is directly
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:09.560]  from the Department of Defense. It is a professional news package intended for the public to see.
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:15.560]  So this exercise actually has a two-fold effect. First, the Marines are training for riot
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:20.800]  and crowd control on American soil where Tea Partiers and Constitutionalists are constantly
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:27.040]  demonized by politicians and the media. In the event of civil unrest, these same Marines
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:34.640]  could deploy this training upon Americans. Second, the media production aspect of this
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:39.720]  is chilling because it shows they're doing this in full public view. They want this to
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:47.840]  be seen. Why? Because they want the public to accept Marines, not police, conducting
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:55.320]  riot control during the coming martial law and societal breakdown. While training is
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:01.520]  a common part of military life, these tactics are suspect in context of our other reports.
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:10.920]  I implore you to please review the content that is on this channel to gain the full perspective.
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:15.600]  And most importantly, please be prepared for the unknown days that lie ahead.
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:22.320]  Now, I'll point out the media. I'm Gary Franchi. Yeah, he's signing off there. That's Gary
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:27.520]  Franchi of the Next News Network, and he was the one that was the voice that you heard.
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:31.760]  That's truly amazing. But his conclusions, I agree with him 100 percent, Paul. Gary
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:36.600]  Franchi said that this is to condition the American public. I think that's a large part
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:41.000]  of what Jade Helm is about. And of course, they're coming back to Bastrop County. They're
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.200]  going to have another county commissioners meeting because I've already had one to give
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:48.240]  them the okay when the public didn't know about it. Now the public is upset about this
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:53.080]  in-your-face propaganda, the military training on the streets. And so they're going to have
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:58.520]  another meeting this coming Monday evening, April 27th. So people who are in Texas, we
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:02.960]  need to show up there and tell them what we think about this. Go ahead, Paul.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:09.280]  Yeah, the key point again, the Army, the National Guard, whoever it is, they always regurgitate
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:14.560]  this idea, this talking point. This is for foreign overseas operations. And the mainstream
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:21.200]  media, again, just parrots that every single time. But if you read the Army's own manuals,
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:27.520]  which is in our article, Beyond Denial, Preparations for Martial Law on Info Wars, civil disturbance
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:34.640]  operations, this is a leaked 2012 Army manual, dozens of pages. It makes it clear that this
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:42.520]  training is dual purpose for, quote, dissidents within Conus, the continental United States.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:47.680]  Yes, it's for overseas, but it's also for domestic unrest. Because if you actually dig
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:55.720]  into that manual, they talk about reeducating Americans into a new appreciation of US policies.
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:01.680]  Within, this is a quote, within the United States or US territories during civil support
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:07.640]  operations. So the Army makes it clear that this training is dual purpose. And then you
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:13.840]  place it in the wider context of what came out of the Davos Economic Forum back in January,
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:19.640]  where the economist Robert Johnson said, the elites, the wealthy, are buying hideaway
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:25.400]  remote places and land in countries like New Zealand and others, because they're afraid
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:32.360]  of this growing wealth inequality, a lack of faith in the political system in America,
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:38.680]  which could lead to civil unrest, like we saw in Ferguson, Missouri. So not only do the
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:43.520]  US Army admit that they're preparing for this domestically, now the elite recognize this
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:49.680]  threat. That's why they're buying these secret remote hideaways in countries like New Zealand.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:54.640]  So when you place it in that wider context, it completely eviscerates the argument that
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:56.960]  this is solely for overseas operations.
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:00.320]  Well, and of course, as you pointed out, we see that in their documents. They talk about
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:04.720]  how this is for use Conus and continental United States. We also had some of the documents
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:09.800]  that showed that they were talking about collecting social security numbers for the people that
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:14.520]  they were putting in these reeducation camps. I think it's very chilling to see the drill,
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:18.280]  for example, in Fort Lauderdale, where they've got civilians that they're rounding up in
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:22.880]  the dead of night. They've got them marching them single file with soldiers on either side
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:27.220]  of them and then putting them in white vans and then driving them away. This isn't what
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:30.760]  they do in other countries. And you know what? It isn't what we need to be training
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:36.240]  to do anyway in other countries. We need to back off of being invaders, back off of being
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:43.080]  an empire that occupies countries. We need to realize that we have never won as a government
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:49.280]  an asymmetric warfare where we are the occupying forces. Haven't won it. They had readily admit
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.440]  that when they're talking about it back in 2005. We've looked that up when we went to
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:59.680]  A.P. Hill. Stay with us. We're going to be right back. Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:04.240]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our U.S. politicians
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:08.800]  argue from banning Americans from owning body armor. Does that sound right to you? Arm your

[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:15.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host, and we're talking to Paul
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:21.520]  Joseph Watson in the UK. We've been talking about the new video of US Marines, and this is something
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:27.040]  that was not taken by citizen activists. This was something that was professionally done and released
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:32.880]  by the Marine Corps for the public to see. So we can see that they're going to use the Marines to
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:39.120]  shut down any unrest in America if we have some kind of a natural disaster, if we have
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:45.360]  martial law declared, if we have an economic collapse. You need to prepare for your family.
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:49.120]  One of the ways that you can do that right now is to make sure that you've got an adequate supply
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:55.120]  of food and water. Emergency food, you can get my Patriot supply products at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:04.160]  collapse with pure water, and that's with the pro-pure filters. Get out the fluoride that
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:09.040]  they're dumping into the water, get out the glyphosates that you can't stop from being used

[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:24.960]  clean water now and in an emergency as well as an emergency food supply. My Patriot supply
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:32.480]  food products available through InfowarsStore.com. Let's go back to Paul. Paul, as we were just
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:37.040]  talking about this, I think one of the things that concerns me the most is, of course,
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:41.760]  the founders of this country did not want to see a permanent standing army. They didn't want to see
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:46.080]  our government getting involved in foreign wars abroad because, as they pointed out,
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:52.400]  every time that happens, these standing armies that are fighting supposedly to protect us abroad
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:59.280]  always come back and are the means of tyranny at home. And so I'm not reassured when I see these
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:03.760]  types of things and they say, well, don't worry, we're not going to use this against you. We're
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:08.240]  only going to use it abroad. I know how that eventually turns out, even if they were to do
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:14.080]  something like that. But that is not the way they have fought these asymmetric warfare exercises.
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:21.120]  That's not the way they occupy a country. They use indigenous people as the immediate police.
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:26.400]  They come in with different kinds of military operations in these counterinsurgencies.
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:32.640]  Yeah. And we know that the true target is eventually the American people. I mean,
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:38.160]  it came out a few days ago, CNN, the Missouri National Guard. And this is aside from the whole
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:44.160]  Michael Brown argument, but they identified the demonstrators there as, quote, enemy forces.
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:49.120]  That's what they describe them as in their own internal memos. And then we can go back to the
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:54.000]  New Hampshire situation where they purchased that Bearcat armored vehicle. The police chief
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:57:00.320]  justified the purchase of the vehicle by saying they needed to deal with the threat posed by
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:07.680]  Occupy activists and libertarians, free status in New Hampshire. So this is why we're seeing this
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:13.600]  militarization of police. And it's a massive concern, as is Jade Helm. But then you get this
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:19.280]  counter narrative, which is being seized upon by the mainstream media and used as ammunition,
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:24.880]  where, you know, these closed Wal-Mart stores are all being turned into FEMA camps,
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:30.400]  which again is complete bunkum. There's no evidence for that. They would not build FEMA camps in
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:36.160]  public view. And yet, while that's being peddled on YouTube with hundreds of thousands of views,
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:42.960]  we have the orders, the contracts from KBR and Homeland Security from 2006, 2011,
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:50.400]  where they're contracted to build internment camps. Yet that gets ignored, the concrete meat and
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:55.760]  potatoes that you can prove and replaced by all these wild theories about Wal-Mart's being turned
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:01.680]  into FEMA camps. The mainstream media seizes upon that and says, look, these conspiracy theorists
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:06.080]  who are concerned about martial law and civil unrest, they're all insane because they think
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:10.800]  Wal-Mart's are going to become FEMA camps. This is crazy. And it is. And that gives them the
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:16.480]  opportunity to ignore what we document in the article, you know, Beyond Denial, Preparations
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:24.400]  for Martial Law. This step by step verifiable, manifestly provable advancement towards martial
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:28.720]  law, towards this, you know, training to deal with domestic unrest. Hang on, we've got to go to
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:33.600]  break. Can you stay with us one more segment, Paul? Yeah. All right, great. We're going to talk
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:37.200]  about this more when we come back. And of course, in New Hampshire, the retired military officer
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:41.040]  said very quick, better than we were in Fallujah. We'll be right back. Thank you for listening to

[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:17.440]  cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And
[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:26.640]  now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:32.080]  and joining me from the UK is Paul Joseph Watson. We've been talking about this video that was
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:39.520]  released showing the Marines and it was released by our government as I think a PSYOP operation to
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:44.000]  get us accustomed to the idea that we've got military in the streets. I think that's a huge
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.920]  part of what Jade Helm is about. Joe Biggs actually got an email from one of the people that he used
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:55.360]  to serve with who, when we first started talking about Jade Helm, he said, be quiet. You're going
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:59.920]  to ruin the PSYOP. This is a PSYOP. So we know what they're training for. We know they're training
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:04.800]  for the American people. It's kind of like when they did a training exercise right at the border
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:10.160]  of Russia and there was that interview with Vladimir Putin and the guy was asking him about that.
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:15.840]  He said, well, those aren't directed towards you and Vladimir Putin just laughed for about 20
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:21.040]  seconds. Come on, we know when they're training for us. We know the way they're training. We know
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:26.000]  the asymmetric warfare centers that they've got inside the military bases. We've seen the scenarios
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.480]  that they've talked about. And we know that there's a lot of people who are rightfully concerned
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:34.720]  about an economic meltdown. Look at this story that just came up on info wars.com.
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:40.160]  This is from Reuters. Puerto Rican officials warn that the government shutdown there is imminent.
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:45.040]  They say that they are broke. Puerto Rico's top finance officials said the government of the U.S.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:50.640]  territory will likely shut down in three months because of a looming liquidity crisis and warned
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:55.840]  of a devastating impact on the island's economy. We look at that. We look at all the news about
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:00.080]  the war on cash and we talked about that just yesterday with Paul Joseph Watson, how they
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:06.400]  are telling people you can't put cash in your savings deposit. They're trying to actually get
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:11.360]  cash abolished. We've got the chief economist for Citibank talking about the different ways
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:17.200]  that they can make cash disappear so they can better control the currency. Paul, your comments
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:24.160]  about Puerto Rico and where do you think this is all headed? Well, I mean, I came on here long
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:29.600]  before the Ferguson riots and said that there are going to be riots and civil unrest inside America
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:37.280]  and that's been proven correct. The CFR, they exhibited their concern about it last year.
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:42.000]  They said this is all part of the American distemper in their own words. You know,
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:47.040]  it happens a big New Brzezinski saying there's a global political awakening which is basically
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:53.040]  spiralled out of the control of the elite. We see these statements continually, again,
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:59.040]  out of Davos. Robert Johnson said that the elite are buying hideaways in New Zealand to prepare
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:05.280]  for mass unrest as a result of wealth inequality and this lack of faith in the political system.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:12.480]  Congress record low approval ratings and they're genuinely concerned about it. So people should
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:19.840]  get beyond the denial but also have discernment in not thinking that because Walmart closed these
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:25.760]  five stores across the country for reasons of, in one case in California, it was to
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:30.880]  oppose unionization and the employees trying to get better pay and working conditions,
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:37.360]  don't then conflate that with all this documented evidence of preparation for martial law because,
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:42.800]  you know, two police cars parked outside a closed Walmart doesn't mean that they're going to turn
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:47.600]  it into a FEMA camp. It means that they're guarding the stock from looters because there's
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:52.640]  nobody there. There's no staff there. So we've got the admitted examples of where they're
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:57.840]  contracted to build these internment facilities. That kind of gets ignored and dismissed.
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:02.320]  That's what's interesting, Paul. And then the media seizes upon it and it's like,
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:06.640]  oh, look at what the tinfoil hatters are saying now, Walmart, FEMA camps. They do the same
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:11.120]  trick every single time. And what we're going to hear, I know when they have this Jade Helm
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:15.760]  15 meeting in Bastrop County, we're going to hear that we do this kind of training all the time.
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:21.360]  We all know that this is not customary. We all know that this hasn't been going on all the time.
[02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:27.840]  And very few people know we reported it here at InfoWars, but it was last summer that the Pentagon
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:32.480]  shut down a program giving surplus equipment to fire departments. They shut it down for about a
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:35.760]  month. They said they're going to discontinue it. They've been doing that for 60 years. And at the
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:41.760]  same time, they couldn't get enough MRAPs and armored personnel carriers into the hands of people
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:46.720]  who had a resting authority. That's what section 1033 was. So they wanted to shut it down to the
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:51.280]  fire department and give it to the people who could arrest citizens. Thanks for joining us.
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:54.800]  Paul Joseph Watson, stay with us. Anthony Gutiarty, a natural society is going to be
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:58.160]  with us right after we come back. He's going to talk about the deceiving vitamin studies and
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:01.360]  Monsanto's efforts to discredit people. Do you know what it means to be an American?
[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:07.440]  It's more than a flag. It's more than knowing the star-spangled banner. It's knowing the Constitution.
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:12.240]  It's understanding those rights and fighting for them. Our country is falling apart because
[02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:17.360]  people have forgotten to fight, to stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing.
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:22.560]  It's putting your life on the line to protect your country from enemies both foreign and domestic.
[02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:26.720]  The Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government,
[02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:32.960]  and no government should refuse or rest on inference. So the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:38.560]  from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. I'm Joe Biggs with infowars.com,
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:44.480]  and I believe our flag is more than cloth and ink. It is a symbol that stands for liberty and freedom.
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:49.680]  It is the history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:56.000]  So join me in this info war. Turn off your TV. Put your Cheetos down. Get off your button. Join the resistance.

[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:28.000]  Jones show I'm David and I'm your host and joining me now is Anthony Gutiarty from natural society and
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:35.360]  of course we talked a lot in this on the show about how the new model for corporate cronyism is to
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:40.320]  basically hold a gun to your head and force you to buy their products to use the government to do
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:45.600]  it but there's also they still operate in the old fashioned way and that is by deception and by
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:50.960]  marketing and by propaganda and we've seen that this week in terms of the articles coming out a
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:56.880]  couple of articles talking about how taking extra vitamins can do more harm than good and increase
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:09:02.720]  the risk of cancer and whenever I see this I always ask well who's funding this and I looked
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:08.320]  at this article and and they had numbers for the well this will go up this much percent and that
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:12.400]  sort of thing if you take too much but it's like what is too much they don't even define what too
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:17.520]  much is and they don't even define what they're talking about in terms of you know what kind of
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:22.240]  vitamins these are we just had a report not too long ago Anthony it was beginning of February
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:28.480]  we learned that GNC, Target, Walmart, Walgreens were all accused of selling adulterated herbals
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:34.480]  and vitamins they said they had garbage in them that wasn't in many cases it wasn't what was advertised
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:39.520]  they're being called on the carpet about that so I guess the question was what kind of vitamins
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:44.320]  were they getting who was funding this study and what do they consider to be too much none of that
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:49.120]  stuff was put out there but they do a very good job of firing a shot across the bow of anybody
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:54.080]  that's trying to help their health by taking supplements and doing research. You know I have
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:57.920]  a very unique perspective on this because I've heard all the radio shows debating about this and
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:01.840]  they have the experts on the nutritionists and they're saying vitamins are good all that we know
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:06.560]  that I actually agree with this study and I'll tell you why because they're studying the big
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:13.040]  pharma run garbage vitamins so specifically we're talking about the vitamins that they say adulterated
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:17.120]  it just means they're full of so many fillers that there's no real herbs inside of them and that
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:23.040]  they're complete junk and oftentimes made in China so I think it is true that taking too many of
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:27.760]  certain vitamins can give you cancer can give you heart attacks you name it I think it destroys
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:33.920]  your endocrine system and the research is on my side however this study is extremely extremely
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:40.080]  deceptive and it brings me back to 2011 when I actually wrote a piece called why many vitamin
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:45.680]  studies are absolutely worthless and this is 2011 when they're the real attack on vitamins began.
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.400]  Now specifically what happens is they take let's say like vitamin E which is one of my favorites
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:55.440]  because every single time a vitamin study comes out they always use vitamin E on the forefront
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:11:00.560]  because they know the researchers if they have half a brain that the natural form of vitamin E
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:05.120]  is super good it has anti-aging effects it gets rid of oxidation in the body it's an antioxidant
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:11.360]  in many ways but then the synthetic form which is petroleum based version so it's the runoff
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:17.200]  byproduct of petroleum their synthetic garbage kind that can actually kill you and give you
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:21.440]  birth defects you know it calls birth defects in children and calls other reproductive issues
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:26.240]  and destroy your endocrine system like BPA does so they go in and they say well gee
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:32.080]  that form of vitamin E is bad so then what they do these studies these big pharma backed studies
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:37.040]  they go and create a system that says that vitamins are bad where they only study the synthetic
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:43.680]  fake petroleum based forms that we already know give you cancer so this study is right 100% if
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:48.240]  you're going to go into a pharmacy and you're going to take a two dollar multi vitamin or now
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:52.720]  I see them as low as 99 cents you go into that pharmacy and you buy that multi vitamin it's full
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:57.280]  of synthetic garbage chemicals then of course you're going to get cancer and it's not just the
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:02.960]  vitamins either I mean as you as you notice a lot of these studies use centrum right backed by the
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:07.120]  major big pharma corporations that make it and some of these actually have I'm going to read a
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:11.760]  short little list this is just a short short list some of these chemicals that are inside
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:17.920]  of these vitamins aspartame for flavoring first of all synthetic vitamin forms which we covered
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:24.000]  so the fake vitamin E that we know causes birth defects endocrine system disorders the coal tar
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:30.080]  extracted artificial coloring agents right so that's the FDNC blue number two red number 40 yellow
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:37.680]  number six hydrogenated oil and of course they also have oftentimes GMO corn yeah other GMOs
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:42.800]  yeah that's like saying that corn is bad for you because so much of it is a GMO and we know that if
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:47.040]  they're going to do a study on corn and see if people take a lot of corn most likely they're
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:52.640]  going to get genetically modified corn which is not the same as what many people are thinking of as
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:57.360]  corn but they don't want us to see that on the label they don't want us to know if it's organic
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:02.720]  corn or if it's a non GMO they hide that information from you just like they're hiding that in in
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:07.280]  these studies and it's funny you mentioned the GMOs it's it's exactly the same thing because also
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:14.000]  take it a step further the synthetic vitamins are bad and GMOs are bad but are GMOs inherently bad
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:19.920]  because of the my the organization of the actual genetics inside of the crops and the seeds probably
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:25.120]  but what we know is bad is the roundup that Monsanto has created as the number one herbicide
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:30.000]  that is inside of the corn and sprayed on all the GMO crops because they're resistant to it
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.160]  it's systemic it's not even something that you can wash off it's inside the corn right
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:40.320]  genetically put in there so you can't get rid of the pesticide on the GMO corn just say engineered
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:44.320]  it to have glyphosate inside of it just like you can't get rid of the fillers inside of these
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:48.240]  vitamins and that's a good interesting point too because you know they came up with this non GMO
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:52.560]  label it was something the grocery store chains wanted to do because if you have an organic label
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:58.160]  if it earns that then it has to not only not have any pesticides put on it but it also includes
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:02.880]  the fact that it's not genetically modified but they could come up with a non GMO and as long as
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:07.280]  it wasn't genetically modified they could still spray it with pesticides they could still do all
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:11.680]  that other kind of stuff you know but and that would make it cheaper for them to raise and people
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:15.840]  think that they're getting something that is quote unquote organic when it's not that's the subtle
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:21.040]  ways that they use these this labeling stuff to deceive people that's the big scam yeah and it's
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:25.440]  just like how we've known for so long that Monsanto's roundup herbicide with glyphosate in it which
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:29.680]  they create and have the patent for is killing people in the World Health Organization now agrees
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:34.720]  it's causing cancer but we're spraying it anyway and scientists are saying ban it and ban it and
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:39.120]  the debate is still not about whether or not we should be using roundup it's about the GMOs but
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:43.520]  the very reason that the GMOs are also toxic is the roundup it's so complicated complicated but
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:48.560]  it's so simple when you break it down and I want to talk about this study this is just one study
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:53.840]  there's thousands of them this is from 1992 so this is talking about the differences between
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:59.280]  organic and garbage vitamin E and it's breaking it down this is you can read the abstract here
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:04.400]  I've actually read the whole study basically what they find is that synthetic vitamin E as I mentioned
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:08.720]  causes birth defects and messes up the endocrine system and this is what we've been knowingly put
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:14.640]  into vitamins for so long and and this is the petroleum based form and then that's another
[02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:18.320]  that's the reason I had to write this story that's up on info wars.com right now in the featured
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:25.680]  box how vitamin studies deceive the public into big pharma profits now this is really a deceptive
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:31.120]  disgusting trick to say that vitamins are killing you without telling you what it is as we've discussed
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:36.800]  so what it comes down to in my opinion is that they are losing the battle big pharma is losing
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:41.440]  the battle monsanto is losing the battle and that ties into another report about how they're
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:49.040]  actually using trolls to attack us because it's now been confirmed by a monsanto employee nonetheless
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:57.600]  that monsanto has an entire department meant to ridicule and discredit scientists and others
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:01.440]  who actually would go ahead and say that GMOs are unsafe and that roundup is bad for you.
[02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:06.960]  So what that means is they have an army of trolls and for those who are not aware an internet
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:12.640]  troll is someone that just causes problems and stirs up BS for no reason with no actual basis
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:16.240]  and doesn't want to argue the facts it's someone that you've all seen them on the comments on
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:20.320]  Facebook or on info wars or wherever where they're stirring up trouble for no real reason we've
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:26.000]  known they existed for a long time the government does it but now I'm on santo employee in an investors
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.800]  meeting publicly stated not knowing that this was open to the public that there was an entire
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:34.480]  department because everyone's freaking out the world health organization saying roundup is bad for
[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:37.840]  you and it's causing cancer they were all freaking out saying what are we going to do about this
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:44.320]  and he said rest assured my friends we have an entire department working around the clock to
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:49.920]  discredit these scientists the scientists that care about your health yeah they have an apartment
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:57.040]  to discredit us and they use BS and slander in attacking us on the comments over and over again
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:17:00.880]  well of course you look at these studies I remember when we got those horrific pictures of
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:08.080]  that study that was done in France feeding the rats GMO food and they had these massive tumors
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:13.120]  all over their body right and so then what does the industry do they run another study and they
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:18.000]  say look that happened with our rats because they ran it for a very very very short period of time
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.880]  compared to what the other guys did okay so that's the way they can game it they can fund any kind of
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:27.600]  study that they want they've got the media on their side as you point out because pretty much
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:33.120]  every ad that you hear anymore is a as an ad for the pharmaceutical companies or for Monsanto I
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:37.680]  remember years ago we used to go to used to live in Florida we used to go to Disney World pretty
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:44.960]  often and and Epcot of course the the food exhibit the land well it was all sponsored by Monsanto you
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:49.200]  know they had hydroponic gardens and they were showing how science was going to feed the world
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:54.320]  and everything what they weren't telling you about uh was the glyphosates the GMOs and all
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:59.600]  this sort of thing but they they hung out there it's a massive massive PR campaign well it reminds
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:03.760]  me of the town of nitro that received 90 million dollars because of the mass poisoning through
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:09.360]  Agent Orange and the creation of all that with Monsanto and it's just like imagine it's almost
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:15.120]  like idiocracy where Monsanto is just trying to prop itself up as some great corporation they should
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:18.480]  just take all the money they spend on marketing and use it for something else I mean no one's
[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:21.840]  buying it they've been voted the worst company in the world over and over and over again
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:25.760]  we've launched press releases declaring them the worst company in the world everyone totally
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:30.960]  agrees that their reign is over and that's why they have these trolls yeah and on the flip side
[02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:36.320]  big pharma is making more money now than ever this was the record year even bigger than 2013
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:40.480]  which was considered the pharmaceutical boom for a lot of people because of course Obamacare and all
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:46.880]  the deception on that but just uh specifically now big pharma is now becoming the new Monsanto
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:51.760]  they're launching these attacks on vitamins to keep people away from them to think that their
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:57.200]  paradigm their old health paradigm of pharmaceutical intervention is still the only way to live
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:04.400]  when we all know everyone listening knows that's total not true and they go to vitamins and they
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:08.320]  find oh my god it's actually changing me oh my god when I take these things I'm actually
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:12.160]  having a difference I'm actually feeling better and they simply can't have that so what they say
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:16.560]  is it's a placebo it's a mental effect because if they can psychologically get your mind then
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:20.400]  they can get your physical body and they can get your wallet and then get your paycheck yeah that's
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:25.760]  the whole system if they can think make you think that you're a quack see they make you disbelieve
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:30.320]  that things are happening I mean we've had people it's just a conspiracy theory it's just a conspiracy
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:34.320]  it's just a conspiracy theory that uh they're creating petroleum-based vitamins I didn't know that
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:38.240]  about vitamin E I knew that they're artificial sweeteners they wanted to avoid because they
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:44.240]  were petroleum-based it just amazes me that they would feed us petroleum I mean this is

[02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:18.800]  war on for your mind welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we have with us
[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:24.720]  anthony gucciardi from natural society we've just been talking about the ways that uh big
[02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:32.160]  pharmaceutical companies as well as big agra is deceiving us and lying to us but we're getting
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:37.920]  some victories i think uh they're getting the message that uh people really want cleaner food
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:43.600]  this article from marcolla says that coke and pepsi are now going to remove flame retardant
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:48.880]  chemical from their products isn't that nice we we can now have that without drinking flame retardants
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:53.360]  just like i guess we can get bread from subway without getting rubber mat the chemical that's
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:58.160]  so you'd think they do that in the first place obviously just like you would think mcdonald's
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:02.960]  10 15 years ago would have started removing the crud from their food trying to stay competitive
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:06.720]  but the good news is that we are forcing them to do all these things just like hershey's the
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:10.000]  major chocolate manufacturer just agreed to remove high fucked us corn syrup from the
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:14.240]  hershey kisses and their chocolate products that's a good that's good news i mean it shouldn't have
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:18.560]  been in there in the first place and then high fucked us corn syrup has mercury in it and it's
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:23.840]  undoubtedly making us fatter and killing us but it is good news that these corporations are being
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:28.160]  forced to change because after all they haven't changed in how many decades right so we've been
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:32.880]  pushing them over and over and over again and receiving victories time and time again and as
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:37.760]  far as i understand vermont just had a big gmo labeling victory as well and we're still getting
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:42.720]  some more intel on that but over and over again we seem to have these huge victories with monsanto
[02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:46.560]  losing money and it just ties back into how we were talking earlier about these companies
[02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:51.600]  paying internet trolls and it reminds me of an article where coca-cola was found to pay these
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:57.120]  health leaders in different incentives like oh we'll give you a free car or whatever it was
[02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:03.280]  in order to say that a healthy snack option was like a little bit of nuts and a small can of
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:08.800]  coca-cola right so they were trying to say that coca-cola can fit in anyone's healthy diet as long
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:13.840]  as we have caloric restrictions and blah blah blah which is total garbage obviously but they were
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:18.640]  paying them off to say these things because they are desperate they won't have to pay people to
[02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:22.880]  say these things if it were true yeah yeah exactly now what they're going to be taking out of this is
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:28.400]  bvo that's brominated vegetable oil they say that it was first patented as a flame retardant
[02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:34.000]  but it's been added to american sodas for decades and anthony this reminds me of what they're
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  doing with this dye that this dye component that was they're getting pushed back in california
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:45.680]  and it's been banned in a lot of countries but of course coke and pepsi for years would continue to
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:53.520]  put this dangerous dye into their into their sodas and the things are brown i mean what is it i mean
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:57.760]  it's not like it's some bright color that is going to increase consumption i mean it's just to make
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:03.840]  it brown how many different dyes do you need to make something brown and of course coke said we're
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:08.400]  going to take it out did take it out pepsi not so much they're going to continue to do it yeah
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:12.320]  pepsi is going to continue to put that in it's like why is that so important to them i mean why
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:17.280]  do they have to have uh fire retardants why do they have to have dangerous dyes in their products
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:22.000]  when their products are brown it's just insane well you know having an inside scoop on the supplement
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:26.720]  industry talking to some of the biggest manufacturers in fact the biggest manufacturers in the world
[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:31.360]  sourcing products and everything like that i can tell you why because with companies like that where
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:37.760]  it comes down to millions or billions of bottles and not thousands of bottles one cent per bottle
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:44.320]  matters a lot i mean a lot so if they can save two cents a bottle with a chemical that they get from
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:50.000]  china and mass for less than a penny per bottle then they're actually going to fight millions
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:54.480]  and millions of dollars in lobbying fees to get that because it will save them in the long run
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:58.240]  maybe because they don't think like us they don't think well in a month they think in 30 years it
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:05.360]  will save us 500 million dollars and we're talking now about uh companies even in the pharmaceutical
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:11.680]  or nutraceutical realm that are using contaminants from china to fill up their products just so it
[02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:17.040]  looks like the capsule is full and they're spending nothing on it i mean this is it's basically free
[02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:22.640]  it's free money for them they're selling capsules now that are cost like one cent at whole foods
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:27.120]  even for like five dollars now some of these per capsule that's how serious it's getting they're
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:31.120]  marking it up over and over again with total contaminants and that's what's happening with
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:35.200]  uh colin pepsi they care about the one cent per bottle and i know that's true of the fast food
[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:39.040]  companies too that's why i don't like to you know if i'm going to get a hamburger i want to eat at a
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:44.560]  local restaurant uh they advertise they've got organic burgers organic meat or whatever i know
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:48.560]  that uh the local people are not going to try to cut corners like you point out you think it's
[02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:53.600]  shave a penny off here or penny off there that's big bucks to them but it's going the local companies
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:57.840]  the local restaurants are not going to do that because they know it's going to hurt their business
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:01.840]  and it's not going to save them much money so they have a disincentive uh financially to do that
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:05.360]  whereas the other guys have an incentive to do precisely that we're talking about the way that
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:09.440]  they're pushing back on stuff and i think one of the important things that happened in this last
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:14.960]  election and we talked about at the time was that in hawaii there were organic farmers there
[02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:20.240]  that shut down the growth growing of uh monsanto's gmo products there and they did that in the
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:25.040]  election and that's been far more effective than trying to get the labeling through is to shut it
[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:30.800]  down at the source but there's an article up on info wars dot com today that now a federal judge
[02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:36.800]  is going in looks like they're going to overturn the desires of the voters and the farmers well
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:41.200]  of course they are i mean at the end of the day also the supreme court even has a monsanto justice
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:45.440]  on the bench well we're out of time thank you so much uh anthony gutturalty natural society

[02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:05.920]  let's talk about the real war on women first wave feminism was a noble cause but modern
[02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:12.080]  feminists well instead of fighting for say paid and protected maternity leave they want to ban
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:20.000]  words shirts and man spreading come on that's cultural marxism which asserts that culture
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:26.800]  and language is responsible for oppressing women and not the state the truth is the state encourages
[02:30:26.800 --> 02:30:32.240]  gender wars it's a divide and conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves
[02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:37.760]  in fact the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women as the late
[02:30:37.760 --> 02:30:43.520]  erin russo revealed the rockefellers bankrolled feminism and not because they had any interest
[02:30:43.520 --> 02:30:48.720]  in women's rights but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta the state
[02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:54.160]  collects more tax dollars children are indoctrinated at an earlier age and the traditional family

[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:48.160]  been talking about the video that was released by the government to condition us i guess to the
[02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:53.760]  idea that we're going to have marines in our streets working against anyone who is protesters
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:59.680]  doing crowd control doing riot control this is the way it begins and of course you can see that

[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:45.440]  i just want to run down through some of the news that's up on info wars dot com right now we've got
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:50.320]  uh as i mentioned with paul joseph wasen portorico officials are warning that there's going to be
[02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:55.280]  a government shutdown imminent in the next couple months unless they get bailed out that's the way
[02:34:55.280 --> 02:35:01.840]  it's starting it's not just in europe it's also here of course they're trying to find ways to
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:05.200]  stimulate the economy that's why they're talking about negative interest rates i've got to get
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:09.520]  us all to take our money out and spend it real quickly so they got to punish us if we try to
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:14.320]  save it it's not enough to punish us through the tax code they've got to punish us with negative
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:21.200]  interest rates and to make sure that we don't just hold the cash in our pockets in our mattresses
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:27.280]  they're going to try to do things to tax the cash to abolish actually having cash that's been
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:33.920]  talked about by city bank's chief economist we also have xca chief david patrice to be
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:38.960]  sentenced fairly soon for leaking military secrets wow do you think he's going to get the
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:46.640]  same kind of sentence that manning did i don't think so i think you'll probably you probably
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:53.040]  won't get a long enough sentence that he will miss uh this june's bill deberg meeting i bet you'll
[02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:58.480]  see him there i don't think he's going to be doing any time in jail not at all of course i've also
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:02.720]  got dutch bank which is not going to be doing any time in jail they've been fined a record
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:09.120]  two and a half billion dollars in rate rigging this is reported by reuters us and british regulators
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:14.640]  have fined dutch bank two and a half billion dollars in its british subsidiary pleaded guilty to
[02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:21.840]  criminal wire fraud but of course no matter what they do whether it is money laundering or uh wire
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:28.320]  fraud whatever they're too big to jail we've got the libor scandal we've got money laundering that
[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:33.680]  city bank was caught in as well as hsbc now dutch bank have been caught uh doing that
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:40.000]  but of course eric holder said uh it wouldn't serve the interests of our country to put any
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:45.600]  of them in jail so they gave them a fine that amounts to a very short period of their profits
[02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:51.200]  nothing against the individuals who set this up who set up the money laundering for drug cartels
[02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:55.840]  for terrorist organizations nothing for these people who are rigging the financial markets
[02:36:55.840 --> 02:37:02.240]  the libor market the commodities market the stock market they just do whatever they want so you
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:07.760]  know what i don't think david portrayus is going to serve any time in jail either i like i said i
[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:12.080]  think uh this june that is coming up the bill de berg meeting and he's become a regular there he
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:18.880]  now works for another wall street turner uh firm uh colberg cravitz and roberts uh these are the
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:25.360]  guys that brought behind the uh massive leverage buyouts a few decades ago they're still in operation
[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:31.120]  also old models of work are broken this is a story that's up on infowars.com no sector will be immune
[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:36.400]  to the changing nature of work and of value creation and of course many people are talking
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:42.320]  about how in just a few years we're going to see 50% unemployment okay you think it's a big deal
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:48.480]  when they shut down five walmarts imagine what's going to happen when we got 50% unemployment
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:55.840]  oh yeah that's why they've got the marines training to fight the crowds look they're going to replace
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:01.920]  truck drivers they're going to replace people in every industry are going to be replaced with an
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:07.200]  auto with um artificial intelligence as well as robotics and if they can't replace you with a
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:14.880]  machine they're going to import people into this country to take your job it's all part of taking
[02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:20.560]  down the west it's all part of the deconstruction plan of course we've talked a lot this week about
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:29.360]  the Trans-Pacific Partnership and how that is uh pulling these different regions together into a
[02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:33.760]  global governance by multinational corporations another part of that though is to basically
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:41.040]  alter the countries with open borders we see that in the uk Nigel Farage is saying send them back he
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:46.640]  backs the policy that they have in Australia of returning all immigrants so they can stop the
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:51.520]  millions who are trying to cross the Mediterranean and of course there's a situation in Libya as
[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:56.000]  we reported earlier this week we've got a lot of people that are dying and trying to get from Libya
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:02.400]  to Italy they're saying turn them back to stop this flow of immigrants some people are saying well
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:07.280]  that would be inhumane well perhaps that would stop the flow of immigrants if they were to not
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:13.840]  know that they would not be able to get in but of course at the very source of this is our foreign
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:19.440]  policy overthrowing the government of Libya every time we go in as Rand Paul pointed every time we
[02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:27.200]  go in to depose one of these secular dictators we wind up with a quagmire usually being run by
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:33.040]  radical Islamists and that's what we see in Libya as well now we also have this article that was
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:40.400]  up the top of drudge yesterday and part of today census says a record 51 million immigrants in just
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:48.240]  eight years will account for 82% of the US growth in population this is a massive demographic change
[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:52.400]  and of course that's what's happening in Europe it's also what's happening in America and again
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:59.040]  they want to balkanize and and take down the existing legal system cultural systems set up
[02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:03.520]  different groups against each other within the countries that divide and conquer strategy
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:09.840]  will allow them to set one group against another as they take down the different western economies
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:12.720]  and then there was this interesting story that came out a couple of days ago
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:20.800]  from Breitbart talking about a Mexican theme park that is offering illegal US border crossing
[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:28.240]  practices actually they've got a situation there that's called eco alert and those wishing to play
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:33.840]  as if they were false illegal immigrants can pay 250 pesos to experience a simulated border
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:39.520]  crossing where they wade through mud tunnels and across rough terrain without torches or water
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:45.440]  while trying to evade border guards thieves and dangerous drug traffickers all being played by
[02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:53.120]  actors there we go i'm reminded of the the comment that Jeremy Clarkson maybe it's one of the reasons
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:56.160]  he's not on the air anymore because he just wasn't politically correct you know he said
[02:40:56.160 --> 02:41:01.120]  uh uh there weren't any the the Mexican uh country didn't have an Olympic team because
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:06.560]  everybody who could run jump or swim was already in America and so i guess they can go to this
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:11.360]  Mexican theme park and practice exactly doing that and again pointing out that this is not
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:15.840]  just an American problem but it is also a problem throughout Europe the New York Times reports that
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:21.680]  Germany's small towns are feeling the cost of Europe's migrant crisis they are crying out for
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:27.120]  money because they cannot afford to take care of everybody see what they do is they set up
[02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:32.000]  the welfare state the entitlement state in all these western countries then they open the border
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:38.400]  to the entire world and that will take us down just as the sociologist cloward and piven forecast
[02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:44.320]  they said that this is the way that we essentially destroy the existing states so that we can rebuild
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:49.280]  our socialist utopia on the ruins just as we were talking earlier in the program about um uh
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:56.240]  the coming uh Avengers program and the interview with Robert Downey Jr that was in the last
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:42:03.520]  captain America there was a lot of rich illustrations there of how this is being played out not only
[02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:09.280]  with Operation Paperclip but also with the character being played by um Robert Redford
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:14.480]  saying we have to destroy the area before we can rebuild it into the utopia that we want that is
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:20.080]  not that is the strategy of cloward and piven to create an entitlement state to open the borders
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:25.360]  to tell everyone to come in and of course what people don't realize is that in the trans-pacific
[02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:30.880]  partnership that is there the transatlantic partnership something for europe as well as for
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:36.240]  us as there's an entire chapter there about open borders and open immigration and that
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:42.960]  my friends is why no one in either party is doing anything about our open borders is because
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:48.640]  that is part of NAFTA let's go to some of your uh calls right now want to see what your comments
[02:42:48.640 --> 02:42:54.720]  are on what we've been talking about let's go to brian and colorado go ahead go ahead brian
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:43:01.600]  uh yeah doing a great job um i want to talk about david krally uh he was the director for um
[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:09.680]  gray state yes and he was a parent uh murder suicide um there's a string of these things
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:15.600]  going on and these people they really need to be brought to justice and and to be quite honest with
[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:21.040]  you all you guys that work there you're a danger for any of this stuff happened so i would suggest
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:25.920]  anybody listening to this that's an advocate for freedom in this country that this could happen to
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:31.760]  them maybe get a camera and hide it and just share that information with very close people so we can
[02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:37.120]  at least get the guys the henchmen behind this well you know it's interesting because that's
[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:42.960]  the way joe biggs uh got here to info wars was because he was speaking out about what happened
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:49.760]  to his uh friend and um michael hastings and there was at the very beginning we looked at
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:53.840]  the accident of michael hastings and again i don't know about the gray state we've heard from people
[02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:58.080]  we've been in contact with people on both sides some people believe that uh it was a suicide
[02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:01.920]  some people believe that he was murdered but clearly with michael hastings from the very beginning
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:06.400]  the way the automobile accident was set up i didn't buy it and then we found in the subsequent days
[02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:10.320]  that he was telling everybody hey the fbi is coming after me i need to go dark for a while
[02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:15.680]  i'm on the run even concerned with his uh friend who who lived in the same apartment building
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:19.920]  concerned that somebody was planting something in his car so there were a lot of indications
[02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:24.400]  about that and that's the way uh joe biggs got here so yeah we certainly understand
[02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:30.480]  that that is a risk we certainly understand that uh our government is uh capable of assassinating
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:36.400]  people they make it pretty open now i mean we we've got drone assassination programs they're still
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:43.600]  not openly talking about the fact that they uh would assassinate filmmakers or people who are
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:47.040]  journalists who criticize them they're still keeping that quiet they're still not talking
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:50.800]  about that openly but yeah we all understand that that's a risk go ahead do you have another comment
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:56.720]  um not really i would just would encourage everyone to you know with today's technology
[02:44:56.720 --> 02:45:01.840]  it's the means you can get a camera and stash it in your house that way you've got peace of mind
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:05.600]  that you know that if they go and whack you there's a good chance you may be able to
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:10.160]  find the people that are responsible for this and in saying that if we do catch one of these guys
[02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:14.000]  they could lead us to who told them to go and do it you know that would be the greatest thing ever
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:17.840]  absolutely keep up the good work and move right along the chain of calls thanks a lot
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:21.440]  thank you brian yeah you know when you're talking about keeping an extra camera that that reminds
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:25.920]  me of the adrian schoolcraft uh situation of course he was a new york city police department
[02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:30.960]  whistleblower and he had recorded for a couple of years the fact that the new york city police
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:37.920]  department was encouraging people to go out and make arrests that were unnecessary to do things to
[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:43.200]  hide serious crimes so they would look good in the fbi statistics nevertheless uh ruthlessly
[02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:48.560]  persecute people to try to collect petty fines he was very upset about that and so he started
[02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:53.040]  recording that when they found out about it the number two in command went to his apartment
[02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:59.440]  and they basically gave him an ultimatum and said you know you need to turn over these things or
[02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:04.800]  we're going to basically or we're going to commit you and we had that recording because he was not
[02:46:04.800 --> 02:46:09.200]  only did he have a recording on him at that time and then they found that and you can hear
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:15.200]  when they found that recording device on him in his apartment but he also had another recording
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:22.000]  device up behind the books on the bookshelf and they did not find that one and his father who
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:27.120]  was a police officer after he went missing searched his apartment found that recording and knew that
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:30.480]  they had committed him somewhere but he couldn't find him for several days now you talk about
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:36.080]  outing people and things happening to them there's nothing happened to those guys in the new york
[02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:41.600]  police department unfortunately uh not that i know of instead uh they were coming after adrian
[02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:46.800]  schoolcraft but he was able to as a whistleblower like frank serpicoe expose a lot of the things
[02:46:46.800 --> 02:46:52.160]  that were being done by the new york police department at the very maximum what you're
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:57.520]  going to get from that is a change in policy because again like the bankers like david betray us
[02:46:57.520 --> 02:47:02.720]  nobody goes to jail in america uh if you're breaking the laws it's only the whistleblowers
[02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:07.120]  apparently that they come after but we're going to change that let's go to uh james in italy you
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:13.200]  want to talk about the marines on the street james go ahead hi i just want to bring up a point that
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:19.840]  the fleet anti-terrorism security team video that you guys are posted uh you're you're bordering on
[02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:29.200]  disinformation okay um those marines are stationed there in camp al and norfolk virginia i am a former
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:39.920]  fast marine myself and these guys will deploy uh to rhoda spain uh Bahrain and japan to uh
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:46.320]  basically set up security for three sectors of the world if and when the u.s embassy would be
[02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:51.920]  attacked they would go in and set up security and clear out the building if there were any
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:56.160]  hostiles involved well let me ask you about the asymmetric warfare center that they've got at the
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:48:01.520]  marine base um and camp lejeune that's a uh asymmetric warfare center that's different from the one in
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:08.080]  fort ap hill that the one in fort ap hill is set up essentially for a city with a lot of urban types
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:13.760]  of transportation the one that marines have is one that set up for more suburban rural aspect
[02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:18.960]  why do they have those there is that for the marine embassy is that is that what they're
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:25.280]  training for the an embassy in the in the farmlands or of america um i was never involved in any of
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:32.640]  those uh areas all the areas that i trained in were specifically mock embassies and these bravo
[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:40.320]  company marines formally third fast actually went to Benghazi when all that was going down
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:46.320]  okay so you can understand why these guys would be training in this video with fellow marines as
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:53.840]  opposition forces um because they get put into very go ahead yeah are you aware of any of the
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:58.720]  training scenarios where they have talked about uh getting people's social security numbers where
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:03.840]  they have talked about uh how the enemy is the tea party conservatives and libertarians are you are
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:10.160]  you aware of any of those training scenarios i haven't been in the marine course since 2010
[02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:18.160]  and uh all the stuff is coming to light lately uh i i never had any involvement in well you know the
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:23.520]  mayak report that came out in 2009 that was uh saying that that was warning law enforcement
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:30.400]  coming out of a department of homeland uh fusion center that was warning uh law enforcement be on
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:35.760]  the lookout for people who have stickers that say that they voted for ron paul or for chuck baldwin
[02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:41.200]  or people that have uh gads and flags that type of thing people who were uh part of would self
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:46.160]  identify with a patriot movement so that was something we broke back in 2009 but it is it is
[02:49:46.160 --> 02:49:52.480]  changing it is getting uh more and more common to see this type of thing and and i guess you know
[02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:58.400]  when we look at this and we see marines being used for crowd control they did say that that was in a
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:03.760]  in an embassy setting but of course we see that they're using this in a lot of different scenarios
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:09.120]  when i went through fort ap hill that was an american city and so i have to wonder uh why they
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:13.680]  have the military training to uh pick over in american city are you concerned at all about
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:19.840]  these training exercises that you see throughout the country uh jade helm has me concerned a bit
[02:50:19.840 --> 02:50:25.440]  um but i just want to get back to the point uh this video was filmed in york town virginia
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:33.760]  which is home to charlie uh sorry bravo company um second fast formally second fast and you can see
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:41.760]  that they're they're on a military installation and i believe that there's like hype to this and uh
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:48.160]  it's just these guys aren't training for civilians in america i mean they're they're training for
[02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:53.280]  overseas deployments to protect united states embassies all right thanks for letting us thanks

[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:16.160]  welcome back to the alex genisher i'm david night your host in this last segment of the
[02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:21.600]  show today we're going to go back to your calls uh we just had a call from uh james and idly talking
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:27.680]  about the video that we had showing marines training for crowd control and i think on the
[02:54:27.680 --> 02:54:33.440]  heels of the national guard tapes that we just saw from the dirty bomb drill that were made by
[02:54:34.800 --> 02:54:40.080]  people in the area showing the national guard moving against roleplayers who
[02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:44.960]  self-identified themselves as sovereign citizens and that was the cue for the national guard to go
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:50.800]  against them i think that it's uh very concerning to see the military training over and over again
[02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:58.000]  in these in our cities in these scenarios and even and he says that unit that's there is a unit
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:04.720]  that is tasked with protecting embassies fine understand that nevertheless we have the military
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:11.040]  at all levels and all divisions training throughout america in the cities and and at a level we have
[02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:16.880]  never seen before and i don't think we should get used to this i don't think we should tolerate this
[02:55:16.880 --> 02:55:21.520]  in the cities and i'm i'm very concerned about that again as you're looking at this you can see some
[02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:27.840]  clips from a couple of years ago i think this one was in la looks like the night clips that they had
[02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:31.920]  in la but of course it was just a lot of delt this is for lot of delt just a couple of weeks ago
[02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:35.840]  yeah where they're lining people up marching them off and taking them in the dead of night putting
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:42.640]  them into white vans is that the mission that we want for a military again as i said do we even
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:48.080]  want them doing that in foreign countries because that always has a history that's the way human
[02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:53.040]  nature has always worked that's the way empires have always worked they always wind up using that
[02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:58.160]  against their own citizens even if it was going to be used abroad let's go to some of your other
[02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:06.160]  calls let's go to rich in new york rich hey david how you doing okay listen i had cold
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:10.800]  once before but it was the end of the show and uh i just really want your opinion on something
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:17.440]  of the opinion is uh this is a court case of it's called the credit river decision and i don't know
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:23.440]  if you're familiar with it um no from uh we don't have a lot of time so so give us a quick executive
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:28.400]  summary of what it is because we're we're coming up against the end of the show again yeah okay
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:35.280]  unfortunately i um basically it's uh based on the laws of um of uh um what to call corporate
[02:56:35.280 --> 02:56:40.960]  agreement uh you know to be able to bind the contract uh this gentleman uh fought a a mortgage
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:44.720]  case up in minnesota and wanted the guy was a lawyer and the thing was called the credit
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:51.680]  river decision and he based it on the fact that that you have to um supply legal consideration
[02:56:51.680 --> 02:56:56.880]  and assume a risk in order for a contract to be binding there is no binding contract with
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:57:02.480]  frauds uh federal reserve notes and then when they when the when the bank just moves uh numbers
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:07.600]  on a ledger they're not assuming any risk either so to me this is a very important thing i mean he
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:12.400]  won that case you know how many cases have been won on roe versus way this is a really important
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:19.760]  issue that people need to check out because then it it nullifies any contract any mortgage any credit
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:25.680]  card if you look at it they would have to find the person in favor of the person uh no who's
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:30.080]  being uh haran interesting thing rich is that you know just yesterday we were talking about how
[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:35.360]  i think it was jp morgan chase was going to outlaw uh cash being used in the positive we had
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:41.680]  other uh talk about the abolishment of cash it says on the dollar bill that it's it's legal tender
[02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:46.000]  you can't do that sort of thing and yet we see that they can do whatever they wish whether it's
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:49.920]  money laundering whether it's rigging the LIBOR rates the stock market the commodities market
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:54.960]  they do whatever they wish and they never go to jail they just get a free pass we saw that with
[02:57:54.960 --> 02:58:00.640]  john corzine that's the way it works in this country and and if they can get away with those
[02:58:00.640 --> 02:58:06.080]  kind of massive frauds if they can do it out in the open and get away with that we're not going
[02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:11.520]  to be able as long as we let that happen we're not going to be able to take them down on some
