[00:00.000 --> 00:09.200]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones only on the GCN radio network
[00:22.960 --> 00:28.280]  Here we are broadcasting world-wide from deep in the heart of Texas now under FEMA region 6

[00:34.400 --> 00:39.520]  here for the next four hours as we kick off another global transmission wow big
[00:39.520 --> 00:45.280]  broadcast today Trump's foreign policy speech signals death of neocons and peace
[00:45.280 --> 00:50.720]  with Russia and others we're gonna have George Norrie coming on to talk about
[00:50.720 --> 00:54.840]  all these different world events earth changes and so much more Mark Dice as
[00:54.840 --> 00:59.120]  well and Anthony Guciardi we'll quarterback the fourth hour with a lot
[00:59.120 --> 01:06.760]  of late-breaking news and more today I want to play quite a few clips of the
[01:06.760 --> 01:12.040]  speech that Trump gave yesterday and he did read off a teleprompter part of it
[01:12.040 --> 01:16.000]  teleprompter the other parts he would pause and go to his own points as he's
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.920]  just showing the world that he can go off of a prepared speech the issue is
[01:19.920 --> 01:25.640]  everybody else can't operate without one but still some of that some of that
[01:25.640 --> 01:31.400]  gleam being broken by him using it but what he said was clearly written by him
[01:31.400 --> 01:35.520]  and it's got the globalist in a conniption fit we're gonna be breaking
[01:35.520 --> 01:39.920]  that down today all these different council on farm relations members the
[01:39.920 --> 01:44.880]  head of the Kissinger Group Roth Cop personally in front of the board ops and
[01:44.880 --> 01:51.840]  witnesses tried to get me to join the New World Order John Harmon hurt it just
[01:51.840 --> 01:56.640]  amazing he's come out against Trump and what he has to say about foreign policy
[01:56.640 --> 02:02.360]  and more here's why they're mad US foreign policy is to build a corporate
[02:02.360 --> 02:07.480]  world government for the globalist at our final expense and I'm gonna explain
[02:07.480 --> 02:13.000]  all this today it's so key they blame free market use our engine of liberty use
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.640]  our military use our technology to take over the planet while discrediting
[02:18.640 --> 02:24.320]  capitalism and hanging it on the West and hanging globalism on America then
[02:24.320 --> 02:28.120]  when they're done they release the next wave of socialist and communist
[02:28.120 --> 02:33.040]  collectivist young people who can't get jobs because there's no economy left by
[02:33.040 --> 02:37.520]  design they then run the next phase of the plan total collectivism at the
[02:37.520 --> 02:42.880]  national level as the quote solution that then causes the total collapse of
[02:42.880 --> 02:46.800]  the society and the globalist consolidate more control with authoritarianism
[02:46.800 --> 02:50.200]  because they're offshore exempt from the very policies they bring into the
[02:50.200 --> 02:53.920]  nation this is their exact admitted battle plan and we're breaking it all
[02:53.920 --> 02:59.480]  down to here but here is a Trump absolutely destroying Hillary and Obama
[02:59.480 --> 03:05.640]  and the globalist foreign policy we're a humanitarian nation but the legacy of
[03:05.640 --> 03:15.280]  the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness confusion and disarray a mess
[03:15.280 --> 03:22.480]  we've made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before we left
[03:22.480 --> 03:33.840]  Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide we have done
[03:33.840 --> 03:39.680]  nothing to help the Christians nothing and we should always be ashamed for
[03:39.680 --> 03:46.160]  that for that lack of action our actions in Iraq Libya and Syria have helped
[03:46.160 --> 03:54.160]  unleash ISIS and we're in a war against radical Islam but President Obama won't
[03:54.160 --> 04:00.320]  even name the enemy and unless you name the enemy you will never ever solve the
[04:00.320 --> 04:11.560]  problem Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam even as she
[04:11.560 --> 04:17.160]  pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country after
[04:17.160 --> 04:22.800]  Secretary Clinton's failed intervention in Libya Islamic terrorists in Benghazi
[04:22.800 --> 04:28.320]  took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans
[04:28.320 --> 04:33.760]  then instead of taking charge that night Hillary Clinton decided to go home
[04:33.760 --> 04:40.480]  and sleep incredible Clinton blames it all on a video an excuse that was a
[04:40.480 --> 04:47.240]  total lie proven to be absolutely a total lie our ambassador was murdered and
[04:47.240 --> 04:51.240]  I said we're gonna go to break that that clips was recorded on an electric
[04:51.240 --> 04:54.240]  shaving razor but we do have the full speech without a hum on it we're gonna
[04:54.240 --> 04:57.920]  be playing some clips of that here today I'm Alex Jones your host a weather
[04:57.920 --> 05:05.400]  specialist Donald Trump says a nation without borders is not a nation and we
[05:05.400 --> 05:10.080]  need to build a wall across the southern border liberals and much of the main
[05:10.080 --> 05:15.720]  street media believe that Trump's wall to stop illegal immigration stems from
[05:15.720 --> 05:20.080]  racism but wait a minute what about Hillary Clinton how come nobody's
[05:20.080 --> 05:25.760]  calling her a racist after all it was Hillary who voted for a 700 mile
[05:25.760 --> 05:32.120]  anti-immigration wall in 2006 I voted for border security and some of it was a
[05:32.120 --> 05:35.440]  fence I don't think we ever called it a wall maybe in some places it was a wall
[05:35.440 --> 05:39.480]  and don't forget it was only a couple of years ago when Hillary sounded just
[05:39.480 --> 05:44.120]  like Donald Trump and I am you know adamantly against illegal immigrants but
[05:44.120 --> 05:50.480]  now in 2016 it is politically incorrect to secure our borders and that's why
[05:50.480 --> 05:55.160]  Hillary Clinton was for building a wall a few years ago but now she is
[05:55.160 --> 06:00.440]  against it and you can check out more reports right now at info wars com hey

[08:19.280 --> 08:32.680]  coming to you live from the frontlines of the info war I'm going to lay out some
[08:32.680 --> 08:39.760]  headlines here briefly that I'm gonna tie it all together with one story thank
[08:39.760 --> 08:43.880]  you for joining us on this Thursday edition on your host Alex Jones have a
[08:43.880 --> 08:46.840]  lot of big guests coming up today I'll tell you about that a little bit later
[08:46.840 --> 08:51.720]  Donald Trump had a very powerful 40-minute speech obviously actually on
[08:51.720 --> 08:56.560]  foreign policy and I agreed basically with all of it it was classical
[08:56.560 --> 09:04.320]  Americana put America first put our sovereignty first incredibly common sense
[09:04.320 --> 09:10.880]  incredibly constitutional and incredibly dangerous to the new world order
[09:10.880 --> 09:18.200]  and that's why they've had top globalists from Rothkopf to the big
[09:18.200 --> 09:23.440]  Rockefeller foundations you name it German ministers come out and attack
[09:23.440 --> 09:31.320]  Trump saying this was a horrible speech the robber barons established the UN
[09:31.320 --> 09:36.400]  and other globalist institutions to transfer American wealth sovereignty
[09:36.400 --> 09:43.560]  power patents inventions into offshore combines above the law to then build an
[09:43.560 --> 09:50.600]  embryonic world corporate government tax exempt they've now basically established
[09:50.600 --> 09:54.800]  that and they're now going into the phase of dismantling what's left of our
[09:54.800 --> 10:01.040]  industry our power supply our culture our families the most weaponized media in
[10:01.040 --> 10:08.160]  the world self-loving guilt hatred of the family hatred of wealth hatred of
[10:08.160 --> 10:14.080]  sovereignty hatred of independence hatred of honor is being injected into
[10:14.080 --> 10:20.880]  society we are being dismantled we built the world government we built the
[10:20.880 --> 10:25.160]  Anglo-American Empire we paid for the whole thing and the globalists set
[10:25.160 --> 10:30.600]  offshore their names aren't even known their tax exempt they have diplomatic
[10:30.600 --> 10:38.840]  immunity and then our leaders many of which are traders and sold us out they
[10:38.840 --> 10:44.360]  just simply graduate on to the next level of global governance on the WTO and
[10:44.360 --> 10:49.520]  the IMF and the World Bank boards and they go at taxpayer expense and hang
[10:49.520 --> 10:54.520]  out in Davos Switzerland with movie stars and have sex with prostitutes four
[10:54.520 --> 11:00.400]  or five times a day and that's on the conservative end meanwhile back here in
[11:00.400 --> 11:05.440]  the old Empire judge sentences serial child molester
[11:05.440 --> 11:12.400]  hashtag 15 months and they had him there in a wheelchair so we feel sorry for
[11:12.400 --> 11:20.840]  him hashtag was recruited by the Republican Party bigwigs in Illinois to
[11:20.840 --> 11:24.280]  run for Congress and then within just a few years of being there be my speaker
[11:24.280 --> 11:28.960]  because they're part of a pedophile network guild you think the Catholic
[11:28.960 --> 11:33.520]  Church has got pedophiles in it folks the same network took them over it's
[11:33.520 --> 11:40.520]  taken much of the world over by the way they don't just rape little kids when
[11:40.520 --> 11:44.040]  you get into the higher as your lines they torture them and they slit their
[11:44.040 --> 11:48.520]  throats and that's come out as well so we're gonna be talking about that but
[11:48.520 --> 11:52.480]  but this is the this is the type of people we're dealing with that now run
[11:52.480 --> 12:00.800]  at the show and you ask well why would hashtag be busted there are different
[12:00.800 --> 12:07.480]  battles going on with in federal agencies and so they try to send over a
[12:07.480 --> 12:10.960]  guy from the army like Petraeus to rebalance things and make him the head
[12:10.960 --> 12:14.400]  of the CIA and they set him up you know try to send him to jail for a few
[12:14.400 --> 12:19.600]  documents inside his filing cabinet and of course they had the sex operatives
[12:19.600 --> 12:23.440]  that were attached to him blow the whistle on him so they use sex operatives
[12:23.440 --> 12:28.120]  on him you really didn't do anything but you notice he was convicted of a
[12:28.120 --> 12:31.960]  felony Hillary does things 10,000 times worse
[12:31.960 --> 12:34.960]  conservatively literally tens of thousands of documents and she doesn't
[12:34.960 --> 12:41.080]  get in trouble because she's an insider but this is how they operate and then
[12:41.080 --> 12:45.240]  with a hashtag you've got other shadowy groups basically blackmailing each other
[12:45.240 --> 12:50.200]  saying listen we'll bring down your entire pedophile networks if you don't
[12:50.200 --> 12:55.040]  do exactly as we say how did the new pope who was the black pope previously
[12:55.040 --> 13:01.360]  the top Jesuit how did he magically take over the order and now turn what
[13:01.360 --> 13:05.200]  Catholicism supposedly traditionally is on its head because they put in the
[13:05.200 --> 13:09.120]  networks through the Jesuit colleges of the pedophiles they took over the
[13:09.120 --> 13:12.640]  Catholic Church they then blackmailed it and took it down you could argue whether
[13:12.640 --> 13:15.920]  it was good or bad in the past it's gone through different permutations but now
[13:15.920 --> 13:21.040]  it's run by the pedophile network or by the people that put in the pedophile
[13:21.040 --> 13:26.960]  network so you have to bring something down before you rebuild it in the new
[13:26.960 --> 13:33.720]  image so we're gonna be talking about that
[13:35.040 --> 13:39.840]  we're also going to tie it into the headline all he could say was sex sex
[13:39.840 --> 13:46.400]  wave of refugee sex attacks hits Austria well they're told you pay three or
[13:46.400 --> 13:51.040]  four thousand dollars you get into Syria and the smugglers from all the world
[13:51.040 --> 13:55.920]  will get these people fake passports and into Germany and into Sweden and into
[13:55.920 --> 14:02.000]  France and you and they're promised a blonde in every pot not a chicken in
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.720]  every pot like FDR promise but a blonde in every pot literally and they show up
[14:06.720 --> 14:11.320]  saying where's the sex and then just start raping and robbing and pooping in
[14:11.320 --> 14:15.720]  the pool and just everything and then leftist Green Party chicks go out and
[14:15.720 --> 14:18.960]  give them flowers and say I'm here to have sex with you they're paid to do
[14:18.960 --> 14:23.000]  that so that's seen on the news so it brings more hordes in saying oh you do
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.080]  get a hot chick in every pot and then Germany and everybody advertises come
[14:28.080 --> 14:35.000]  here they bring them in it's a designed program to bring down society so we're
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.680]  gonna be going over Trump's speech all of it but this is the destruction of
[14:38.680 --> 14:47.520]  culture now let's be clear Edward Bernays who by 1920 or so was running US
[14:47.520 --> 14:51.840]  propaganda policy domestically and foreign wrote three books on the subject
[14:51.840 --> 14:55.600]  said we need women in the workforce we need to have the state take over the
[14:55.600 --> 15:00.320]  children as part of the eugenics plan these are quotes we need to totally
[15:00.320 --> 15:04.160]  brainwash and dumb down the public I've been ordered and given money to do this
[15:04.160 --> 15:12.240]  he had high classified rank inside the US Army you can look all this up is well
[15:12.240 --> 15:16.640]  first we don't call it Department of War we call it Department of Peace see
[15:16.640 --> 15:20.400]  everything's flipped because back then we didn't just start wars all the time
[15:20.400 --> 15:24.160]  but we called it Department of War you want a war you got one so it's the
[15:24.160 --> 15:27.960]  inversion of reality we're going to Joe Bigger in a moment from the situation
[15:27.960 --> 15:36.800]  on this and now look where women are today lower wages incredible unhappiness
[15:36.800 --> 15:40.520]  and every statistic breakdown of the family things are falling apart women
[15:40.520 --> 15:44.640]  are nothing but sexual objects like they've never been before men have been
[15:44.640 --> 15:49.640]  trained to act like a rest of development two-year-olds and they've had the head
[15:49.640 --> 15:51.840]  of the Marine Corps they've had the chairman of the Joint Chiefs they've
[15:51.840 --> 15:54.800]  had them all come out and press conferences and say this will hurt
[15:54.800 --> 15:59.080]  readiness and this will hurt our mission if we put women in frontline combat
[15:59.080 --> 16:03.680]  roles we have to lower the size of the packs we have to cut but we're being
[16:03.680 --> 16:11.400]  ordered to lower standards we can't do this more than ever the special forces
[16:11.400 --> 16:16.440]  do most of the work that's why they've expanded them and Ash Carter came out in
[16:16.440 --> 16:20.000]  the press conference we've got up on info wars.com and said look I don't care
[16:20.000 --> 16:26.320]  what the heads of the joint military forces say we're going to do this and
[16:26.320 --> 16:31.280]  we'll see lots of propaganda of women carrying men around on their backs when
[16:31.280 --> 16:36.600]  the truth is most men I mean maybe one out of 30 are able to actually compete
[16:36.600 --> 16:40.960]  and operate the level of special forces special forces has gotten better not
[16:40.960 --> 16:46.280]  worse it's gotten just just insane on its war footing and all the combat actual
[16:46.280 --> 16:52.640]  training so this is about being able to draft your daughters when they come in
[16:52.640 --> 16:57.440]  with national conscription for three to four year forced terms domestically and
[16:57.440 --> 17:01.400]  they've announced this for decades this is the European plan as well they're
[17:01.400 --> 17:05.120]  gonna open it up for combat but it's also about women just being slaves being
[17:05.120 --> 17:09.640]  drafted into domestic operations and being wedded to the state because the
[17:09.640 --> 17:12.920]  state's gonna give them discipline get in their face telling who the boss is but
[17:12.920 --> 17:17.360]  but but they can't have any authority or even co-parenting or a co-relationship
[17:17.360 --> 17:21.920]  with their man at home and this is pure social engineering they admitted it just
[17:21.920 --> 17:26.000]  like can't say mother and father can't see more girl purple penguins you know
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.960]  someone says there's two genders the police are called into college the
[17:28.960 --> 17:32.880]  police say yes that's a hate crime even deny someone's existence deny global
[17:32.880 --> 17:39.160]  warming we want to arrest you they're coming all combat jobs open to women in
[17:39.160 --> 17:42.320]  the military the Defense Department will lift all gender-based restrictions on
[17:42.320 --> 17:45.680]  military service starting in January Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced
[17:45.680 --> 17:50.600]  today the historic change will clear the way for women to serve in all the armed
[17:50.600 --> 17:57.440]  services and it goes on from there Carter's decision comes as a rebuke to
[17:57.440 --> 18:01.520]  an internal recommendation from the Marine Corps that sought to keep some
[18:01.520 --> 18:05.360]  jobs closed women in contrast the Army leaders recommended opening up all
[18:05.360 --> 18:09.600]  combat jobs to women that's not really true they fired her by the wooden while
[18:09.600 --> 18:13.400]  the Marine Corps asked for a partial exemption in some areas such as infantry
[18:13.400 --> 18:17.760]  machine gunner and fire support reconnaissance and others we are a
[18:17.760 --> 18:21.640]  joint force and I have decided to make decision which applies to all of the
[18:21.640 --> 18:26.600]  force entire force Carter said at a Pentagon press briefing this morning the
[18:26.600 --> 18:29.880]  important factor in making my decision was to have access every American who
[18:29.880 --> 18:35.000]  could add strength to the joint force that's right male and female fetuses
[18:35.000 --> 18:39.840]  also get to get harvested and sold to the highest bidder and in male and females
[18:39.840 --> 18:44.440]  get to work in Foxcom Apple slave factories 17 hours a day till their
[18:44.440 --> 18:48.720]  fingers bleed and then be forced drug and forced aborted with suicide nets oh
[18:48.720 --> 18:53.480]  and by the way though they don't put women in frontline combat in China
[18:53.480 --> 18:58.360]  anywhere else and if you push gay marriage in China they kill you you go
[18:58.360 --> 19:02.760]  but that's the progressive communists they must be the no communists would
[19:02.760 --> 19:06.960]  never allow that because they've already taken over this is how they collapse us
[19:06.960 --> 19:11.040]  believe me when they're done collapsing us there's not going to be humans in
[19:11.040 --> 19:15.080]  combat except for small support teams that are back from the robot force
[19:15.080 --> 19:19.960]  that's all official so but to sabotage the human force even though it's better
[19:19.960 --> 19:24.280]  overall even the best robots they're developing and will be they might not
[19:24.280 --> 19:28.320]  follow orders and they are truly autonomous to the Bill of Rights and
[19:28.320 --> 19:33.280]  Constitution and are actually patriots and so they're creating an autonomous
[19:33.280 --> 19:36.800]  robot force that isn't really autonomous it's been programmed by the
[19:36.800 --> 19:39.520]  globalist just like in the future what you eat and what you do and what your
[19:39.520 --> 19:43.680]  job is will quote me from a computer so it's non-bias no it's programmed by the
[19:43.680 --> 19:49.680]  globalist this is the Panopnikon zeitgeist hellhole the UN's pushing so

[24:20.640 --> 24:23.920]  and who are beta testing the destruction of society here in the
[24:23.920 --> 24:31.000]  United States and of course it's the so-called left that wants to make women
[24:31.000 --> 24:38.160]  fight in combat they want to destroy the the sacredness of femininity they want
[24:38.160 --> 24:42.120]  to use women just like they've used men as slaves men historically and
[24:42.120 --> 24:48.160]  genetically but this is also this way in much of the mammal kingdom are the ones
[24:48.160 --> 24:55.480]  that go out and do the main fighting today that is all being inverted because
[24:55.480 --> 24:59.320]  they are getting rid of humans they're telling us the age of humans are over so
[24:59.320 --> 25:06.120]  you have to pull men out of the positions of leadership in traditional male
[25:06.120 --> 25:10.400]  roles because you're going to put robots in those positions joining us to talk
[25:10.400 --> 25:15.240]  about this is combat veteran purple heart recipient Joe Biggs to give us his
[25:15.240 --> 25:20.000]  view on this you've heard my analysis of it Joe joining us from the situation
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.360]  room what is your view on this I mean it's interesting I mean what when you
[25:24.360 --> 25:29.080]  inject women into combat you're now messing with the male psyche you're now
[25:29.080 --> 25:34.720]  messing with this men's primitive want to protect a woman so when you put those
[25:34.720 --> 25:39.160]  women out there and they're being shot at men aren't going to be concerned with
[25:39.160 --> 25:43.040]  their objectives they're not going to be focusing in on the enemy and said
[25:43.040 --> 25:45.800]  they're going to be worried about whether or not this female soldier is
[25:45.800 --> 25:50.080]  doing okay because that's their instinctive nature to take care of them
[25:50.080 --> 25:54.560]  and make sure that they're all right so it's a huge issue to bring women into
[25:54.560 --> 25:58.080]  this kind of role and now they've already got women who have been passed
[25:58.080 --> 26:02.880]  through ranger school and the officer who was over the ranger school said that
[26:02.880 --> 26:07.120]  these women would get through regardless so you know that they ignored
[26:07.120 --> 26:10.560]  standard operating procedure they fudge a lot of the different standards and they
[26:10.560 --> 26:14.940]  allow these women to go through to be PC and now you have a house panel that's
[26:14.940 --> 26:19.280]  voted to make women register for the draft women will have to register for
[26:19.280 --> 26:21.960]  the selective service and would be eligible to be drafted in the military
[26:21.960 --> 26:26.880]  under provision approved by a house panel yesterday now the proposal passed a
[26:26.880 --> 26:31.560]  house armed services committee without support from its sponsor Iraq war veteran
[26:31.560 --> 26:35.720]  representative Duncan Hunter a Republican from California now he
[26:35.720 --> 26:39.680]  introduced this as a way to force congressional conversation about the role
[26:39.680 --> 26:42.880]  of women in the military and he didn't actually think that it would get any
[26:42.880 --> 26:46.680]  support and the people that actually backed him to bring this forward as a
[26:46.680 --> 26:50.520]  way to open up conversation and maybe sway some of these people from bringing
[26:50.520 --> 26:55.040]  women into combat turned on him and actually voted for it so now women from
[26:55.040 --> 27:00.400]  the ages of 18 to 26 at some point will end up having to sign up for the draft
[27:00.400 --> 27:04.280]  and the vote came the same day after army officials announced that captain
[27:04.280 --> 27:08.280]  Kristen Christ one of the first women to earn a ranger tab will be coming the
[27:08.280 --> 27:12.920]  army's first female infantry officer so now you've got this lady who's going to
[27:12.920 --> 27:18.240]  be in charge of special operations soldiers and high combat let's just
[27:18.240 --> 27:22.400]  face it I mean they're not gonna respect her guys they usually put in charge
[27:22.400 --> 27:28.440]  have been in like seven eight tours our total badass is super smart and still if
[27:28.440 --> 27:32.520]  they screw up people who's confidence in them historically also women get more
[27:32.520 --> 27:36.920]  infections women tend to get hysterical when other people are being killed
[27:36.920 --> 27:42.040]  women tend to have more atrocities committed by them once they get an
[27:42.040 --> 27:45.200]  emotional state they have three times the connections between left and right
[27:45.200 --> 27:49.760]  hemispheres of their brain there's a reason no culture puts women in front
[27:49.760 --> 27:55.560]  line combat because it is a disaster and it's designed as sabotage against the
[27:55.560 --> 27:58.480]  US military job I mean think about what's happened under the Obama
[27:58.480 --> 28:02.080]  administration thus far you've got soldiers marching around in red high
[28:02.080 --> 28:06.320]  hills you've now got women being brought in you know we look like a joke
[28:06.320 --> 28:10.240]  they're turning it into a huge social justice warrior reeducation got Navy
[28:10.240 --> 28:14.920]  sailors on their you know on the ground on a boat sitting there crying I mean
[28:14.920 --> 28:19.360]  that is ridiculous we look like a joke and this is all part of this plan to
[28:19.360 --> 28:23.280]  destabilize us and make us look weak around the world you're absolutely right
[28:23.280 --> 28:25.960]  you're gonna be covering this more than that we knew tonight and finally special
[28:25.960 --> 28:30.040]  reports other key points job I mean I just don't understand how this could go
[28:30.040 --> 28:33.880]  by I mean people need to wake up and see what's going on this is not gonna help
[28:33.880 --> 28:38.080]  at some point in time we cannot let political correctness destroy our
[28:38.080 --> 28:41.640]  country but it's as you said though is there any doubt it's by design when you
[28:41.640 --> 28:45.320]  talk to your former soldiers current soldiers what is their view on this
[28:45.320 --> 28:49.420]  program well they're scared because when they when when they go to these EO equal
[28:49.420 --> 28:53.760]  opportunity meetings that they have they tell people how that they try to help
[28:53.760 --> 28:57.720]  them introduce how to ignore the fact that it's a woman there to try to
[28:57.720 --> 29:01.920]  continue on with your mission to walk a mile in their shoes and do all this and
[29:01.920 --> 29:05.040]  that and they're completely trying to turn our military into these same
[29:05.040 --> 29:08.960]  social justice warriors that we see in Portland and Denver and Manhattan and
[29:08.960 --> 29:14.920]  all over all these different rallies it's sickening Joe it's amazing that they
[29:14.920 --> 29:19.980]  execute homosexuals in communist countries because they claim it's a
[29:19.980 --> 29:23.760]  Western destabilization program well I'm not saying gays themselves are evil
[29:23.760 --> 29:27.120]  or destabilization program but it's true that when a government pushes all this
[29:27.120 --> 29:31.240]  women in combat can't say father and mother I mean this is how you kill a
[29:31.240 --> 29:36.400]  species this is how you bring a society down Joe Biggs thanks for that

[33:59.360 --> 34:02.040]  dumbing down of the public and how do you get these zombies out of trances
[34:02.040 --> 34:06.280]  some people say well why don't you enlighten the zombies you talk to when
[34:06.280 --> 34:10.440]  you go out on the street and say let's band a hydrogen monoxide and 90% of them
[34:10.440 --> 34:17.080]  sign it in Austin Texas or Los Angeles California why don't you tell them it's
[34:17.080 --> 34:21.240]  water because you can't educate people like that when you're awake one person

[35:30.400 --> 35:37.320]  drafted this is the state saying they own women and all the things the state
[35:37.320 --> 35:40.240]  has done to women with forced inoculations and things all over the
[35:40.240 --> 35:49.600]  world catching them sterilizing women it is just mind boggling and mind blowing

[39:28.040 --> 39:32.360]  possible toll free number again to join us if you've been in the military and
[39:32.360 --> 39:38.920]  activity service especially in combat all I know is women on ships and yeah you
[39:38.920 --> 39:43.040]  say why shouldn't women have the opportunity to go out and to get a you
[39:43.040 --> 39:48.480]  know in the military and get a job and be able to get free tuition I get there's
[39:48.480 --> 39:53.560]  benefits involved in all this but it's caused tons of pregnancies tons of
[39:53.560 --> 39:59.680]  court-martial sex problems it's absolutely hamstrung military other
[39:59.680 --> 40:05.280]  navies have very low levels of women or they have their own navy ships that are
[40:05.280 --> 40:09.440]  all women or almost all women or women are on one end and the men are on the
[40:09.440 --> 40:17.680]  other that's why every culture does that because we're different that's why in
[40:17.680 --> 40:21.520]  most species not just mammals the females are in one group and the males are
[40:21.520 --> 40:27.040]  another why is that hmm because when you integrate the two completely in a
[40:27.040 --> 40:32.440]  forced way it causes massive fighting the women start fighting the men start
[40:32.440 --> 40:40.600]  fighting it's bad news ladies and gentlemen very very very very very very
[40:40.600 --> 40:46.800]  bad news if you take the ship not really the shipwreck of the with Fletcher
[40:46.800 --> 40:50.120]  Christian and the meeting on the bounty which is a true story there's a three book
[40:50.120 --> 40:53.640]  series written by some World War one aces that actually moved to those islands
[40:53.640 --> 40:57.600]  studied it right after the people had had had you know their children had died
[40:57.600 --> 41:06.760]  of Christian Fletcher and others I'm going from memory and there were four or
[41:06.760 --> 41:12.920]  five times more women than there were basically men when they'd mutiny'd
[41:12.920 --> 41:18.560]  gone and found this uninhabited island and all the men killed each other just
[41:18.560 --> 41:22.360]  a few years and it's because the women were pushing and wanting the men and
[41:22.360 --> 41:26.240]  fighting over the men I mean there's all sorts of weird equations and things
[41:26.240 --> 41:31.160]  that happened but this is a disaster and anyone that's managed people knows
[41:31.160 --> 41:37.040]  this anybody again it is it is sabotage against our culture it is so
[41:37.040 --> 41:45.320]  completely and absolutely out of control and I guarantee you a Trump
[41:45.320 --> 41:50.880]  presidency would start reversing this this this is just wild so we're gonna
[41:50.880 --> 41:55.880]  talk to Garrett a vet of the Marine Corps John a vet of the Navy J a Navy
[41:55.880 --> 42:02.360]  vet John a Air Force vet and sergeant in Oregon vet US Army special forces and I
[42:02.360 --> 42:06.680]  don't know who I should go to first who's been holding the longest let's go
[42:06.680 --> 42:11.520]  to sergeant in Oregon sergeant thanks for holding her on the air yeah AJ how
[42:11.520 --> 42:18.200]  you doing buddy good thank you yeah listen I I was a did a tour in Nam and I
[42:18.200 --> 42:22.880]  was with the special force we ran recon up into Cambodia seven of us up there
[42:22.880 --> 42:27.240]  and go up against you know like major troop stream coming down the trail like
[42:27.240 --> 42:30.880]  5,000 guys and they would drop off a company guys just a way to waste this
[42:30.880 --> 42:36.880]  but the women deal I you know I saw a lot of hard-core North Vietnamese women
[42:36.880 --> 42:42.000]  fighters I mean they were tough fighters very very tough and the junk
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.960]  especially jungle fighters but you know I don't I don't know the women in this
[42:46.960 --> 42:50.280]  country just I don't think they should be doing that kind of thing maybe
[42:50.280 --> 42:56.520]  logistics secretaries cooks or anything non-military I I can't imagine going and
[42:56.520 --> 43:01.080]  and having to go into some serious combat with a woman I I just don't see
[43:01.080 --> 43:04.960]  that well you notice you notice that I said women aren't good in combat units
[43:04.960 --> 43:08.520]  historically just like I'm against a draft unless we're invaded then it's
[43:08.520 --> 43:12.280]  total resistance time to start handing machine guns to 10 year olds children
[43:12.280 --> 43:16.960]  on average a 13 year old putting combat at age nine anybody will tell you and
[43:16.960 --> 43:20.400]  you've been in special forces you know this is meaner than like a 30 year old
[43:20.400 --> 43:24.720]  special forces vet they're fearless they're crazy other kids get killed right
[43:24.720 --> 43:29.440]  next to them they don't cry for mommy we're killing machines okay young men
[43:29.440 --> 43:32.760]  are the most that's why they want them younger and younger that's why the
[43:32.760 --> 43:37.920]  Chinese military as people down you know to age 15 the Cubans start getting
[43:37.920 --> 43:42.040]  people at 14 and throwing them in the frontline combat and that's because by
[43:42.040 --> 43:45.400]  the time they're 20 or so they're really mean men are meant to start getting into
[43:45.400 --> 43:50.680]  war if you're in a war at age 10 11 12 women obviously in a total resistance
[43:50.680 --> 43:53.920]  mode I mean hundreds of thousands of German women were started fighting they
[43:53.920 --> 43:57.160]  weren't even in the military once the allies and the Russians came in I mean
[43:57.160 --> 43:59.920]  I had family members that told the stories having to cut down German women
[43:59.920 --> 44:03.560]  you know that would be shooting out amount of doorways you name it so
[44:03.560 --> 44:08.360]  obviously women can kill and women can go out and do that and the Vietnamese
[44:08.360 --> 44:12.600]  women were well known for that but they were also a force were generally they
[44:12.600 --> 44:16.040]  were already embedded as you knew and we're out planting rice during the day
[44:16.040 --> 44:20.200]  and then you know throwing hangar nades at you at night but but absolutely you
[44:20.200 --> 44:23.760]  imagine the decadent women we've got today decadent men for that matter but
[44:23.760 --> 44:27.240]  imagine they're already announcing on the news they're lowering standards
[44:27.240 --> 44:31.760]  lowering the training so that women can be in combat that's wrong if there are
[44:31.760 --> 44:35.160]  some women who could probably perform maybe one out of a couple hundred at
[44:35.160 --> 44:39.200]  that level but no they're gonna lower it what do you say to that yeah I just I
[44:39.200 --> 44:42.440]  think you're a hundred percent on that I you know the issues I've had is that this
[44:42.440 --> 44:46.800]  country is soft I mean I've been trying to get people awake and you got people
[44:46.800 --> 44:50.440]  who just don't want to get up and get going and wake up and they're just like
[44:50.440 --> 44:55.200]  numb and of course you know system has just dumbed us down to a level that you
[44:55.200 --> 44:59.240]  know with the chemical spraying and and the television and all this stuff all
[44:59.240 --> 45:04.800]  these years and I'm 70 years old and I'm tough as a rock I I work out every day
[45:04.800 --> 45:09.520]  I'm I eat properly I you know I maintain my body and I try to keep contain
[45:09.520 --> 45:13.360]  myself to a level where I can you know physically function at a high level and
[45:13.360 --> 45:16.920]  it's just like I just see people around me they're just absolutely just dumb
[45:16.920 --> 45:21.120]  down and they're just out of it I don't know I don't I wouldn't trust anything
[45:21.120 --> 45:24.560]  like that and especially people here in this country maybe someplace else I
[45:24.560 --> 45:29.600]  don't know but who's to say I think in under emergency situations maybe people
[45:29.600 --> 45:34.160]  would step up I don't know well look women never fight until the homelands
[45:34.160 --> 45:38.560]  invaded and then they do it's a very very sad thing and it shows that you know
[45:38.560 --> 45:42.200]  the desperate strange people have gotten it and I'm all about arming women and
[45:42.200 --> 45:45.200]  women having guns that concealed carry and my daughters have learned how to
[45:45.200 --> 45:48.760]  shoot I'm all about women taking martial arts and being tough they sell it like
[45:48.760 --> 45:53.280]  oh you're anti-woman you don't woman you know to know how to fight bull but but
[45:53.280 --> 45:58.440]  no civilized culture sticks women in frontline combat it's stupid it doesn't
[45:58.440 --> 46:02.480]  work and it causes the destruction of morale and absolutely like Joe Biggs
[46:02.480 --> 46:06.880]  was saying they're gonna put women in command of special forces that have
[46:06.880 --> 46:11.840]  never even killed anybody I mean this is just ridiculous I appreciate your call
[46:11.840 --> 46:15.000]  and look there are a lot of people getting the military and pass all the
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.560]  stuff and then go and start killing people and start sneaking up on folks
[46:18.560 --> 46:22.160]  just letting their throat some things and then they just don't can't handle it
[46:22.160 --> 46:27.680]  and get out of it a lot of men say look this hidden for me and let me tell you
[46:27.680 --> 46:31.360]  statistically women aren't gonna have you think men have PTSD when men are
[46:31.360 --> 46:36.360]  designed to be able to go out and kill people and and gloss over it you start
[46:36.360 --> 46:40.120]  putting women in there killing people and what happens when women see a whole
[46:40.120 --> 46:43.320]  let's say ISIS or Al Qaeda shooting that you know I was told this by one
[46:43.320 --> 46:46.280]  special forces operator pretty famous guy but the stories are all classified
[46:46.280 --> 46:50.080]  he's going in to kill a high-value target leading a team and into this
[46:50.080 --> 46:53.160]  warehouse and they've got rooms built into the warehouse you know up from the
[46:53.160 --> 46:58.120]  ground management you know type stuff and they got people shooting at them with
[46:58.120 --> 47:01.640]  machine guns throwing hand grenades at them they finally climb up get around
[47:01.640 --> 47:07.440]  throw hand grenades in and guess what once they get inside it's just children
[47:07.440 --> 47:10.440]  splattered all over the walls had a bunch of kids in there with them now men
[47:10.440 --> 47:13.680]  have trouble dealing with that what are women gonna do when there's kids all
[47:13.680 --> 47:17.000]  over the place with their lower mandibles blown off with their tongues
[47:17.000 --> 47:21.400]  flopping around screaming mommy out of a big bloody hole in their throat that's
[47:21.400 --> 47:27.360]  real footage by the way they're gonna have a big problem big problem that
[47:27.360 --> 47:33.560]  there's a reason men commit 95% of the murders physiologically because we're
[47:33.560 --> 47:38.280]  we're able to kill and when we go bad we can kill and women don't do a lot of
[47:38.280 --> 47:42.040]  the killing because they're not predisposed to do it they're not
[47:42.040 --> 47:48.800]  predisposed to do it statistically men are the killers simple women have the
[47:48.800 --> 47:55.560]  babies men fight to protect the babies can't believe I have to explain this I
[47:55.560 --> 47:59.520]  know our audience knows this but the folks this isn't stupidness this is the
[47:59.520 --> 48:03.200]  globalist bringing our country and our world down the communist Chinese aren't
[48:03.200 --> 48:08.720]  putting women in frontline combat they're not following all this feminist
[48:08.720 --> 48:14.200]  baloney because they don't want their country to fall apart Garrett in Texas
[48:14.200 --> 48:21.760]  you're on the year worldwide go ahead Garrett you're on the air go ahead we're
[48:21.760 --> 48:24.560]  gonna put Garrett yeah Garrett you're listening to your radio it's kind of
[48:24.560 --> 48:29.960]  the leg you hear me now I put them on hold I'm gonna go to John next here in
[48:29.960 --> 48:35.720]  just a moment John in Texas a vet of the Navy John what's your view on this yeah
[48:35.720 --> 48:39.720]  it's pretty much the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life but you
[48:39.720 --> 48:43.320]  and I both know you know they said they set women up for this with all these
[48:43.320 --> 48:48.000]  commercials join them beat that man killing man all these movies I mean it's
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.720]  pretty much you know just like back in the day when they introduced cigarettes
[48:51.720 --> 48:56.600]  to females they just set them up for all of this stuff and I'm gonna tell you
[48:56.600 --> 49:01.640]  right now I'm a foreign a military I would love to see women on the front
[49:01.640 --> 49:06.480]  line on on the US on the United States military team because the first thing I
[49:06.480 --> 49:10.000]  would do is just wound the woman I mean that's very simple and then the man is
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.640]  gonna stop and think like oh crap especially if he's yelling out to them
[49:13.640 --> 49:18.000]  with a blown off leg or something he's gonna stop and try to render aid and
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.960]  then I'm gonna get all of them and not to mention the VA the VA is not even
[49:21.960 --> 49:26.320]  set up to have a more yes people and they're gonna come back with huge
[49:26.320 --> 49:31.600]  amount if women go to the front line so this is a this is a win-win for the
[49:31.600 --> 49:36.200]  globalist it's gonna cause a cascading effect through our military and through
[49:36.200 --> 49:39.920]  the United States and through our VA and everything else that's right it's an
[49:39.920 --> 49:43.760]  ongoing sabotage the country thank you what a great caller I gotta cut you off
[49:43.760 --> 49:47.160]  John but you were incredibly accurate thank you for reminding me that's why
[49:47.160 --> 49:50.520]  I love to take calls remember private Lynch admitted it was all fake she was
[49:50.520 --> 49:54.320]  ordered to lie she didn't fight she hid when the men fought and died didn't even
[49:54.320 --> 49:57.720]  get medals and then she was cowering under the bed when the special forces
[49:57.720 --> 50:01.040]  got there to the hospital where nobody'd been for two days because the Iraqis had
[50:01.040 --> 50:05.720]  pulled out and the local Iraqis had called him in and it was run by a major
[50:05.720 --> 50:09.920]  film director over sat video was directing the whole thing and then they
[50:09.920 --> 50:12.600]  killed a bunch of members of her team that survived because they said she
[50:12.600 --> 50:15.560]  wasn't a hero and then she was forced to come out and say that she wasn't a hero
[50:15.560 --> 50:19.320]  that's part of the PR to sell women in the military that's why there's this
[50:19.320 --> 50:24.200]  order in Hollywood and video games and Gamergate to say that women are all the
[50:24.200 --> 50:27.760]  superheroes and the commanders and why they gave you know seven or eight
[50:27.760 --> 50:33.120]  Oscars to that boring movie had some good visuals but overall pretty stupid
[50:33.120 --> 50:38.120]  Mad Max where the men are all these babies living off the milk of mommy and
[50:38.120 --> 50:43.720]  the women could just totally take all the men out absolute horse manure so
[50:43.720 --> 50:49.480]  again men against women women against men divide and conquer pure bull and it's
[50:49.480 --> 50:53.000]  just getting ready to make women total slaves of the state men have been war
[50:53.000 --> 50:57.400]  slaves for thousands of years now the women get to be war slaves as well Jay

[54:37.680 --> 54:42.680]  see if Garrett is back in Texas I'm gonna try one more time a veteran of the
[54:42.680 --> 54:47.120]  Marine Corps it's the Marine Corps that is really been speaking up and the head
[54:47.120 --> 54:50.680]  of the Marine Corps say this is really gonna hurt things and this is really bad
[54:50.680 --> 54:56.080]  and this is not just social justice warriors at the universities you know
[54:56.080 --> 55:00.160]  wanting to have women in frontline combat this is designed to end humans in
[55:00.160 --> 55:04.600]  combat because they do not want that anymore they want to have a total nanny
[55:04.600 --> 55:09.840]  state with robots drones and automated systems controlled by the globalist in
[55:09.840 --> 55:15.160]  charge that's what the megaopolis is the smart cars the grid the smart meters
[55:15.160 --> 55:19.560]  everything that's why you've got to get back to farming back to ranching back to
[55:19.560 --> 55:23.880]  supporting local farmers and ranchers if you live in the big city you've got to
[55:23.880 --> 55:27.280]  have maybe people you team up with and have 20 30 acres you know out in a safe
[55:27.280 --> 55:33.480]  area with wells and crops you grow not to make money but to actually persevere
[55:33.480 --> 55:39.000]  and create areas where normal human activity still goes on and that's why
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.200]  agenda 21 is designed to shut all that down they call it sustainability it's
[55:43.200 --> 55:48.200]  meant to make you unsustainable Garrett in Texas are you there yes sir can you
[55:48.200 --> 55:53.640]  hear me yes go ahead okay excellent I'm sorry my phone got very very
[55:53.640 --> 55:58.000]  aggravating yes sir so imagine I was in the Marine Corps number one thing I'd
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.040]  like to point out is that when you're trying out or whenever you're getting
[56:02.040 --> 56:06.720]  initiated in initially you have to pass a certain requirement physically and
[56:06.720 --> 56:10.280]  mentally now the women I noticed and we all knew this and it was kind of
[56:10.280 --> 56:13.880]  something we didn't really care too much about or pay much notice because they
[56:13.880 --> 56:18.120]  weren't in combat positions but as far as the physical attributes they had less
[56:18.120 --> 56:23.840]  requirements so if I had a man who tried out and he met the requirements of the
[56:23.840 --> 56:27.880]  woman standards he didn't get in but the women's is lowered but they still get in
[56:27.880 --> 56:32.240]  so that's number one number two you hit something right on the nail the head
[56:32.240 --> 56:35.560]  earlier and I want to really expand upon that because this is directly
[56:35.560 --> 56:41.240]  connected the military is now being turned into a social justice warrior
[56:41.240 --> 56:47.000]  program army for this nation and of course it is because people can't refuse
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.320]  the orders and so they're going to be captive with commasars the dream in
[56:51.320 --> 56:56.480]  uniform over you as change agents making you submit to them and creating
[56:56.480 --> 57:00.200]  larger cadres to then go out and run the police departments and everything else
[57:00.200 --> 57:05.560]  this is the fundamental takeover yes sir and let me tell you something when I
[57:05.560 --> 57:09.240]  went to boot camp I was a hundred percent dedicated to come and protect this
[57:09.240 --> 57:13.080]  country and my fellow men they didn't need to do what they did to us at that
[57:13.080 --> 57:16.800]  boot camp it is complete brainwashing you speak in third person for three
[57:16.800 --> 57:20.560]  months gas lighting telling you you did something when you did it until you admit
[57:20.560 --> 57:24.000]  you did it they completely break you down they get rid of your critical
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.480]  thinking skills and you wait on orders to do anything and whenever I got
[57:27.480 --> 57:32.520]  stationed just real quick the women and the men on the navy base there started
[57:32.520 --> 57:36.280]  to be instances of the women getting broken up with by their boyfriends and
[57:36.280 --> 57:40.960]  then claiming sexual assault it happened to a few people I knew now once that
[57:40.960 --> 57:44.600]  happened instead of being able to solve the problem like normal a government
[57:44.600 --> 57:48.800]  system and the military is now completely like a controlled communist
[57:48.800 --> 57:52.840]  system they simply take away the privilege of men and women being in the
[57:52.840 --> 57:56.440]  same rooms together so that's one instance of problem when we absolutely
[57:56.440 --> 58:00.600]  once they do it it sets men and women apart it's caused epidemics of sexual
[58:00.600 --> 58:05.600]  assault both false reports real reports it's it's already destroyed much of the
[58:05.600 --> 58:09.360]  military and now they're going to do it in the only really high functioning
[58:09.360 --> 58:13.920]  units now these special units and this is the take now just like to turn off our
[58:13.920 --> 58:18.360]  power plants just like they are doing college educations that are worthless by
[58:18.360 --> 58:23.520]  design this country has been sabotaged to collapse into world government great
[58:23.520 --> 58:29.240]  call Garrett Levy we're able to get you on J and Ohio and others your calls are
[58:29.240 --> 58:33.720]  straight ahead then George Norrie joins us to break down the entire waterfront

[59:50.880 --> 01:00:09.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:34.760]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from Austin
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:41.320]  Texas broadcasting world-wide it's Alex John
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.640]  talk about a crazy article up on info wars dot com John Vayner former speaker
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:58.680]  the House calls Ted Cruz a miserable son of a bleeper Lucifer in the flesh and
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:05.680]  that is the type of crazy articles that are up on info wars dot com and prison
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:11.560]  planet dot com right now but it is a big deal it's all part of the social
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:17.200]  justice warrior takeover to make people basket cases so that when they get out of
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.960]  college and they can't get a job they're so mentally ill and have such chips on
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.080]  their shoulders they just go take Prozac and watch cartoons all day eating GMO
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:30.520]  waiting to get cancer and die at a young age and so they got to learn to just
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.200]  obsess freak out on each other run around throw fits and they want to do that
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:40.400]  same mental illness inside the military because let's face it in the last 200
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:47.540]  years the evolution of the modern military comes out of Prussia and the
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:54.080]  Hessians and basically war slaves who were so prestigious and spree to core
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.400]  that they were proud of the fact that they were basically trained from birth
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.240]  and were owned by the state and sold off to the highest bidder by the king of
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:06.120]  Prussia and some of the other states did it as well and that modern system got
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:13.500]  adopted now the real base of it was Roman they had that as well a lot of the
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.120]  Romans have their head shaved it was so somebody couldn't grab your hair in a
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:21.080]  fight and slit your throat or you know you should jerk you around with things
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:27.000]  like that but in their systems you were paid a lot by the booty by by what you
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.560]  conquered and were able to take over and in the areas you were in you could also
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.800]  you know basically feed on the local population if you wanted to to a certain
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:42.320]  extent but in your own unit or your own you know hundred man group the centurion
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:46.080]  over it the centurion almost never had to do any discipline because if you didn't
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:51.600]  work hard and if you screwed around they would just kill you and they would just
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.520]  have a vote right there without even involving the centurion and they would
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:01.920]  just kill you so that's that model and there's really still kind of that model
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:08.760]  in the military so I guess women are going to enjoy getting they call it I
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:13.320]  guess the modern term since Vietnam is fragged a fragmentation hand grenade
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:17.920]  thrown into their tent because they're not gonna sit there and let somebody
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.680]  slow them down I predict women are going to be killed in large numbers when they
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.240]  enter frontline combat by their own units and it's gonna be hey sorry honey you
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:32.000]  know we just can't all get killed and you know you're you're you know you're
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.840]  really getting in the way and so it's it's it's gonna be a sad thing that's
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.280]  what it comes down to but that's what they do men and it's been done even
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:48.840]  before the Romans if somebody war is a very dirty vicious business and if
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.560]  somebody toes the lines for everybody they'll die for them but if somebody
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:56.960]  doesn't they're just gonna kill you and so I predict that's what's gonna happen
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.240]  as well that will further degenerate that'll be made for TV movies about it
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.200]  and everything just like they were made for TV movies about private Lynch all
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:11.600]  made up she cowered in fear in the resupply mission she cowered in fear at
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.360]  the base it was all lies but in the movie made for TV movie she battled the
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.440]  men were scared and it was all a big PR thing let's see the survivor started
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:25.440]  speaking out so they all got killed so we're going to go to John in Wisconsin
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.800]  Jay in Ohio Matt California Ray in Ohio I'm gonna get your calls with Norrie
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.960]  some you probably have to hold 20 minutes or so I know you probably talk to

[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:07.520]  a nation without borders is not a nation and we need to build a wall across the
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.840]  southern border liberals and much of the mainstream media believe that Trump's
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:17.720]  wall to stop illegal immigration stems from racism but wait a minute what
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:22.560]  about Hillary Clinton how come nobody's calling her a racist after all it was
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:30.080]  Hillary who voted for a 700 mile anti-immigration wall in 2006 I voted for
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.560]  border security and some of it was a fence I don't think we ever called it a
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.960]  wall maybe in some places it was a wall and don't forget it was only a couple of
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:46.360]  years ago when Hillary sounded just like Donald Trump but now in 2016 it is
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:51.160]  politically incorrect to secure our borders and that's why Hillary Clinton
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:56.480]  was for building a wall a few years ago but now she is against it and you can

[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.800]  tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:20.040]  air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:25.240]  raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:30.240]  pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:35.320]  our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death I
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:41.040]  personally counter this onslaught with antroplex antroplex is designed with

[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.720]  metabolic activity inside the human body discover why antroplex has turned
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:55.880]  so many heads today it's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:00.840]  and it starts at info wars life com with anthroplex
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:11.480]  in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:16.760]  unwanted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:21.400]  commentaries in Dallas Texas three shots were fired at president Kennedy's
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:26.480]  motorcade in downtown Dallas the first report to say that president Kennedy has
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:35.640]  been seriously wounded by the shooting it is a big idea a new order
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:44.760]  it was almost as if we were planned in force it's just pancake either you're
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:09:00.440]  with us or you're with the terrorists
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:05.080]  but I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.760]  hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:16.920]  guns will be taken for many of the police and guard troops it is an
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.960]  uncomfortable job to do this in an American city global governance at last
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.680]  is it one world the central bank was in charge but aren't we all just living and
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.120]  dying from what the central banks do

[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.840]  be going over with George Norrie getting his take on George Norrie's a Navy
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:10.880]  veteran three-time Emmy award winner for news coverage good friend of mine and
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.560]  of course he hosts the second largest radio show in the world according to
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:19.680]  the ratings cus to cus to AM cus to cus to AM.com on almost 600 stations or is it
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:24.880]  more than more than 600 stations there's also an XM and 37 years of broadcast
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:29.560]  experience beyond belief.com is his TV show cus to cus to AM.com is
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:37.280]  obviously the big I almost just call it open-minded free thinking program where
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.680]  they cover everything under the sun from the New World Order to vaccines to earth
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:48.240]  changes to are we alone in the universe and I tell you I realized that aliens
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:53.800]  are real we're creating thousands of different chimera cross species on this
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.320]  planet MIT reported this year on something I've been talking about for 20
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:00.960]  years because it was in the literature was in the medical literature that they
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.200]  had facilities all over the world Hong Kong came up a lot China a lot Costa
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:09.080]  Rica a lot but now all over the US where they're splicing humans and animals and
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:13.880]  then growing humanoids inside cows and sheep and goats and other things and pigs
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:18.200]  for organ harvesting and they've made fun of me a lot in the media about this
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.920]  even though you can just search part human part animal chimeras and you'll
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:25.760]  get the different medical papers and things but they don't show it to people
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.920]  yet now they're getting ready to make them people say well what about animal
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:34.440]  testing well these cows and other farm animals are part humans so they don't
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:41.400]  have rights see there's laws for humans and laws for animals but not laws for
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:47.200]  cross species whether it be salmon or whether it be a human a humanoid and so
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:51.120]  these are aliens that have been created and they media matters run by the
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.120]  White House and others have done a bunch of articles making fun of us and had
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.280]  hundreds of newspapers write about it going Jones is insane and says aliens
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.600]  are here that humans have been crossed with animals and then that's alien well
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.120]  when they create truly AI artificial intelligence they already have
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.120]  artificial intelligence autonomous systems but it's truly conscious the
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:10.080]  question is is Google already really become that interfacing with billions of
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:16.080]  humans I believe so they believe so can now predict the future but will true AI
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:23.960]  be alien yes it's silicon it's it would never develop naturally here so so yes
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:28.840]  aliens are real they're just not the 1950s type you know where the where they
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:36.360]  attacked DC or Mars attacks in the 1990s don't run we are your friends no I see
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.840]  it more like Pacific Rim you know interdimensional there's so many different
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.720]  ways to look at this and George Norrie gets folks thinking about it but I want
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.080]  to get into the election with him I know he's been covering that a lot I want to
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.040]  get into the state of people day why are people acting so whacked out mental
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:52.120]  illnesses exploding all the stuff's happening people say they're so bored
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.960]  because people are in near trance state the medical facts show that we'll talk
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:01.120]  get George's take on that and we'll also talk about his big paranormal date
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.200]  site and then that and his big st. Louis stage show coming up I was in his big
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.560]  one in Toronto last year that was a lot of fun it was an earlier this year I
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:14.680]  forget and so he joins us right now George that's quite the intro as I tend
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:19.840]  to do I run out the mouth first thing I want to ask you is what is front and
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:25.520]  center on your mind my friend oh my well first of all Alex good to be back with
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.600]  you on your show it's it's it's good to have you what do I have to do to get you
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:36.040]  to come on with us via Skype well we've got to do it where I can get to my
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:41.920]  office and then we can we can do it how's the quality now the phones okay
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:44.760]  it's cut down a little bit but listen it's we could at least you could load
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:48.120]  Skype on your phone and I'm not I should have done this before the show but let
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:51.520]  me just kiss your kiss your ring and say please do it if you put Skype on your
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:54.680]  iPhone or whatever you've got we could do audio Skype with you with headphones
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:14:00.680]  it'd be so good George okay we should try that I promise I will send you I will
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:09.120]  send you a key lime pie if you do it the park what would you have in the park I
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:15.680]  don't know a gorgeous gorgeous female but let me tell you Alex so much is
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:23.080]  going on in this planet right now it is absolutely unbelievable when let's talk
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:28.920]  a little bit about the election first of all and what's happening now right now
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:32.440]  it looks like obviously Donald Trump is going to be the frontrunner for the
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.320]  Republicans though I still think it's going to be a brokerate convention there
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.680]  and then we've got Hillary Clinton the frontrunner for the Democrats and
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:45.840]  there's so much under the table about what the she is and who she is that the
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:51.080]  American public just does not know there's not much going on out there at
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:57.600]  all the Trump possibilities are there because people are frustrated with
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:02.960]  everything everything he may end up being a great nominee but people just
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:10.600]  want to change and I've never seen in my life more confusion and also more
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:18.040]  excitement about an election you know in all my life how about you well I I mean
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:23.040]  I agree with you that the system is trying to force feed us AP polls show six
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.800]  percent trust in mainstream media where is all this collapse and confidence
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:32.800]  going George it's going out the window because people are set up with
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:37.840]  everything that's going on with America they just don't trust government you
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:43.160]  you sense that many many years ago when you started doing your programs that you
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:50.400]  were way ahead of the curve we started picking up on that we started not down
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.160]  playing the paranormal which was a stable at coast to coast during our
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:00.320]  bell's days but we realized as you did when I started having you on as a guest
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:06.200]  that this planet is changing and it's you just can't do strange ghosts and
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:11.040]  things like that all the time you know it's still a staple of coast to coast but
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:16.120]  things are affecting people their lifestyle their the way they they live
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:22.800]  their family their income their jobs and their first their frustrated so we
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:28.680]  started to tweak the ball for coast to coast much like you have tweeted in
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:35.120]  forward the person planet and it's it's become huge now I mean you do you talk
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:41.200]  about our audience and thank you for the generosity there but people are at a
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:47.040]  breaking point and it's our job out yours it's mine to make sure people stay
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:54.440]  calm during this very turbulent time well it is our job George and I want to
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.200]  again cover just a whole bunch of issues radical Islam with you where you see the
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.960]  world going earth changes but first off Washington DC I'm gonna put on screen
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:10.360]  behind me footage we've shot in DC the richest city probably in the world and
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:15.640]  they are so insulated the elite believe they're in their own world and here's
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:20.400]  Dennis Hasterd former speaker of the House sentenced only 15 months for
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:26.720]  raping all these young people all these children it's just over the top and
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:33.360]  this just keeps popping up pedophilia in DC and just all these other forms of
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.720]  corruption and it turns out that he was recruited by Republican leadership to
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:41.760]  run for Congress to begin with out of nowhere what shows to me it's a pedophile
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:47.160]  guild above him look at the Catholic Church all these other institutions that
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:53.960]  have been infested by these people the corruption is intensifying what do you
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:18:00.120]  think about the Hasterd situation oh absolutely this is gusting despicable
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:05.960]  and you know it's it's just the tip of the iceberg we've heard stories we
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:11.360]  haven't gone with on coast to coast as it's difficult to prove but we've heard
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:17.480]  stories that some you know high officials go off on little junkets and trips
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:25.600]  and secret islands and covert with you know young people and children and it's
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:31.080]  deplorable to me it's truly deplorable and something's got to be done about
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:38.800]  this you know Hasterd sentences minimal with his compared to his crime and you
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:42.160]  know like you just say what has happened and that you know I was I was raised a
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:49.280]  Catholic went to went to a catechism classes every week but I don't go to
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:54.040]  church like that anymore I don't go to organize religion because what they did
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:19:00.160]  and how they hid this has tainted me and it's unfortunate because there's some
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:05.800]  wonderful priests out there who are God-loving God-fearing to care about
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:10.360]  people but but it's tainted everything sure well that's how you take down
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.200]  institutions is getting corrupt people in place and then doling the news out
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:18.160]  that a bunch of pedophiles run the government and run the Catholic Church
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:22.120]  and run everything else basically then that finally brings it down I mean this
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.840]  is really a well-thought-out plan to demoralize our country well and it is

[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:09.480]  so this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear and the most
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:14.800]  valuable here's why an important book revealing new and dangerous vulnerabilities
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:19.120]  of the power grid has just been written incredibly the author has agreed to give
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:24.880]  away several free copies but only for a limited time to GCN listeners he simply
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:29.320]  asks that you pay $3 to cover part of the shipping and handling cost even
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:34.080]  better if you're one of the first 17 online today he will actually FedEx the
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.400]  book to you why do this why would he spend extra money and all that bothered
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:42.600]  to FedEx his new book the answer is simple America's power grid is in grave
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:46.840]  danger at most Americans are clueless find out what's going on behind the
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:51.480]  scenes and why the most common question this author gets is do you fear for your
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:56.560]  life go to war on the grid dot com that's war on the grid dot com don't
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:04.000]  wait war on the grid dot com the Genesis communications radio network
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:11.920]  proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:36.160]  you're fine in Chicago or New York or London or other cities like Madrid you
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.840]  look now and it looks like a ticking time bomb just hundreds of millions of
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.720]  people boiling around those cities 15 16 17 million you're talking about New
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:52.320]  York City 35 million Mexico City 10 million for London and it could break
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:56.960]  down at any moment and more and more the infrastructure is breaking down more and
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:01.840]  more things are falling apart and they're telling us austerity is here you
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:06.920]  need to have less and all the metrics show increased record suicide increased
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:10.880]  record mental illness increased the breakup of families increase of
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:15.960]  homeless civilization is rotting and you then you study the globalist it's
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:21.520]  their plan to collapse it to bring in total control because they exempt
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:27.560]  themselves in key reservation areas from it now I'm gonna get George's take of A
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.000]  he agrees with that George Norrie joining us and then I also this brief
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.240]  segment want to get his view on because he raised it where he thinks it's going
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:40.920]  because obviously this modern system I like it at the space travel is it
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:45.160]  natural and you go up in space without gravity a few years you can't even
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.680]  breathe when you get back because you don't have the muscles and I see us
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:52.920]  atrophying our humanity how do we reverse it what's really going on George
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:26:00.600]  Norrie I've got to tell you Alex social networking has been wonderful but at the
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:06.040]  same time it's been devastating because what it has done is it's brought this
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:12.000]  planet much closer together in terms of news and information and immediacy and
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:18.280]  now people who normally would not get uptight or upset about world events and
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:22.440]  go on their daily life are really frustrated just because they're being
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:27.880]  bombarded everywhere you go I mean look at the tragedy with Prince when he
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:34.200]  died like Michael Jackson the world knew about it in five minutes in the old days
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:40.520]  my old days when you had just the three television networks and radio things
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:46.280]  would not happen as quickly as they do now so the blessing is it is great for
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:51.360]  information but on the negative side it's created a lot of frustrated people
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:56.040]  and they are uptight and it's worldwide now as you just mentioned it's
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:00.280]  everywhere where people are walking around looking over their shoulders
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.920]  because they don't know if some lunatic is about ready to belt explode themselves
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:11.200]  or if government is up to some trick to manipulate and control and people just
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.440]  don't know what to do well I've got some ideas on that which we can talk about
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:23.120]  before we wrap up but you're absolutely right this is a prison planet now when
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:26.280]  we come back I've got a few callers right before you came on I gave the number
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:30.240]  out about women in the military George to give their view Matt says he's an active
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:34.200]  duty Marine Corps captain we know the Marine Corps itself has come out so this
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:41.120]  is a horrible idea overruled by Ash Carter Secretary of Defense they
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.520]  bill it like we're against women but drafting women I don't want my daughters
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:49.360]  being forced to military plus they admit in every culture it doesn't work what
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.040]  do you think's really behind this George Norrie what's your view on women in the
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:57.320]  military being in frontline areas all as you said they spent nine years in the
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:03.440]  Navy I've got a dear friend of mine this this woman could be Miss America she's
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:09.720]  that gorgeous and she got frustrated with her day-to-day activities and her job
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:16.040]  she joined the Marines and so this incredibly gorgeous woman is now a
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:21.480]  Marine and she's thinking of re-upping she's just she was in a San Diego and
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:28.040]  she's just been sent off to Hawaii but I've got to tell you there is a
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:34.520]  difference between men and women and I don't think we should be putting women
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:42.640]  on the front lines mixing them in foxholes with guys it's it look for the
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:49.960]  history of this planet we have gone with men as soldiers and I don't see why
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.280]  that should change now this is not being sexist by any means I think women have a
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:29:01.640]  place everywhere except we don't need them on the front lines we were first of
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:07.360]  all we don't need words but be that as it may there are a lot of male soldiers
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:11.000]  and we've got enough of them we don't need women on the front well that's right
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.720]  and look just because somebody else can do something somebody else can't doesn't
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:18.160]  mean you have to then ban those people from being involved in something I can't
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:22.320]  have a baby so I shouldn't be able to sue women because they can and I can I
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.440]  mean these are roles that we have we're a species coast2coastam.com
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.640]  George Norrie thank you for popping in with us today please come on for a full

[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:05.840]  all the perplexities the confusion and distress in America arise not from
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:10.000]  objects in their Constitution or Confederation not from want of honor or
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.440]  virtue so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin credit
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:18.720]  and circulation those are the words of John Adams the second president of the
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:22.600]  United States are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve do you
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:26.800]  understand the nature of our fiat currency do you understand how a private
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:31.240]  corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:35.400]  it what kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.760]  American people or for that matter what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:44.640]  our money will you be a slave or will you be free Adams also said liberty

[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:26.360]  that we simply can't even keep up with it in our quest for the purest iodine we
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:30.800]  drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals to

[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:22.160]  we're living in the middle of a real science fiction movie and we're going to
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:27.880]  decide whether we're going to live in a dystopia or in a system based on truth
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:31.880]  and justice and human liberty it's not a utopia but it's the closest you're
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:47.560]  going to get to that now when we talk about this when we look at this think
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:52.440]  about the fact that we're a civilization that is able to travel outside of our
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:56.680]  planet we're able to jump on an airplane and fly in just a few hours to the other
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:03.160]  side of the country and the elites are saying that more and more they are going
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:07.600]  to try to restrict those type of things to the general public and that big mass
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:12.400]  computers are going to decide where you have a job and whether you can have a
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:16.640]  car or not or what you can do this is an automated system of total tyranny and
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:21.000]  what they're doing is bankrupting the old free market system that created so
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.560]  much wealth so they can blame the free market system for the collapse and they
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:32.880]  have national polls out we're nearly half of people under 30 Millennials 18
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.600]  years to 30 say they want to have communism or socialism because
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.960]  capitalism doesn't work they've gone they've gotten their degree they can't
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:49.080]  find a job that pays the bills they think capitalism isn't working and now the
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:53.680]  jobs are going to be hey you know join the government be part of a controlled
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:58.000]  centralized system I'm going to go to Matt who says an active duty Marine Corps
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.640]  captain to talk about the Secretary of Defense coming on saying we don't care
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:05.680]  what the Marine Corps or anybody else says we're going to lower standards when
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:08.480]  they've already done we're going to put women in frontline combat we're going to
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:13.760]  put women in charge of men who've ever been in combat and who knows maybe maybe
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.960]  we'll stop calling the men and women and just call them purple penguins because
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:21.280]  we live in a fruitcake cult no it's not a fruitcake cult it's a design to bring

[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:46.080]  cost money to get this info out at every level I know you know that if you're a
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:48.920]  free market person that's actually worked they want to grow up whole
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:52.800]  generations of people that never worked never ran a business never screwed in a
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:58.560]  light bulb never changed a radiator never changed a spark plug it's scary and
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:01.800]  I'm gonna get to that after we take this round of calls the dehumanization
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:06.480]  what's happening with people that George Norrie was talking about earlier but
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:11.920]  first let's go to Matt and we're going to go to Frank and Ray and Lucy and Bill
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:17.200]  and others give us your take as active duty wow active duty calling in to tell
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:20.960]  us what they think and I would imagine Captain Matt if I ask you why you do
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:23.720]  this because usually active duty won't it's because the head of the Marine Corps
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:28.320]  came out and said it's a horrible idea and we have a foreign globalist operation
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:31.520]  that sees the country just like Spendley Butler the two-time congressional
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:35.720]  Medal of Honor winner they tried to hire him to run a secret right-wing coup to
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:39.000]  overthrow the government he was a right winger so they thought he'd go along with
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.320]  it he turned out he knew the Nazis were involved he said no and exposed the whole
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:47.640]  plan so there's a long history in the Marine Corps a Marine saying no to
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:51.800]  foreign takeovers and folks that's not rhetoric when I say that it's happening
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:56.440]  so let's let's go to Matt in California Matt thanks for calling in
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:02.480]  so thanks thanks Alex it's a pleasure just to touch on something real quick
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:06.640]  everything that that you all have been discussing about women in frontline
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:12.400]  combat it's all true but I was a commander a couple years ago of you know
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:19.400]  a company-sized element and from my perspective the physical stuff there's
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:25.080]  some women in the Marine Corps Alex they could smoke any guy I mean they could
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:30.360]  just flat out outperform any guy that's just kind of a small little piece of it
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:34.840]  well sure they're amazing amazing people you know at those type of skills
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:37.600]  that's what history shown but but generally what do you think the whole
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:46.080]  movements about well it's about it's about the suits like I said every time
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.480]  you talk to a general about one of these operations there's always a guy in a
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:52.320]  suit sitting right beside him it's about them taking over control and telling a
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:57.120]  general you're gonna do this and it's not only okay you're gonna do this let's
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:00.080]  just select those few women that can actually hack it and put them in there
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:03.520]  no one would have an issue with that what the issue is is they're gonna come
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:08.640]  down and say a certain percentage of your unit has to be female and you have to
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:13.080]  accept them regardless and even if they do come out with a qualification they're
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:16.040]  gonna schmooze them through they do it all the time it's about setting the
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:20.600]  precedent hey have the new recruits wear red high heels in the army or you're
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:25.560]  fired it's about doing what we say when we say it doing outlandish things and
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.160]  breaking up the history of I guess an honorable system in our military is that
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:34.520]  accurate that's it's dead on the money it's about some suit sitting beside
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:38.320]  somebody in the military and saying do this right now or else I'll find someone
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:42.280]  that will and then you have to do it and the Marines resist that more than
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:47.680]  anybody else I mean we hate it it's in our culture like you follow Marines you
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:50.360]  don't listen everybody else everybody else is you know all the little things we
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:55.040]  have about everybody else that that's what it's that's what it really boils
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:59.760]  down to we did a test bed in DC where we made a whole battalion out of females
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:03.200]  and males it was a disaster some of my Marines personally went into a part of
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:07.520]  it it was an absolute disaster tell us about it I mean break down what happened
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:13.560]  oh there when you integrate on a small level once the woman proves a she's
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:16.160]  under the gun from the start so most of the women were under the gun from the
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:22.040]  men from the start and then once they prove themselves then the buddy-buddiness
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.760]  started and this wasn't even in a forward-deployed unit they could still
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:28.520]  have their own bathrooms and stuff like that
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:33.440]  fraternization women in charge ended up sleeping with two or three of the
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:37.560]  Marines I mean it was it was horrible it was like that's the paradigm we see in
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:42.080]  management that women it's almost like horrible bosses one like this I mean a
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:45.920]  lot of women actually act like the woman in horrible bosses one who's the
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:49.480]  dentist and people say oh that must be fine no then they flip out on you
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:53.560]  afterwards and then they get jealous and weird women in positions like that
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:57.760]  historically look at some of the crazy queens are even wilder than men on
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:02.720]  power trips well absolutely and I don't want to seem like I'm bashing on the
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:05.520]  women here because have three-quarters of the problem comes from the men
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:10.400]  ourselves it's just in our nature some good-looking women come by she's fit
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:15.280]  she's in shape she's in charge that's attractive to them and it's it's across
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:18.560]  the board it's just a bad idea and when you're focused on the things I've
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:22.960]  deployed three times twice to Iraq once again absolutely look it's not that I'm
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:26.760]  scared of women in charge of good-looking alpha woman there's nothing
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:30.640]  sexier and I don't know how you can handle being around a sexy hot alpha
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:34.400]  woman and you want to obviously it's it I mean it's a disaster that's why they
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:41.080]  never did it in history but we we had some they called them fat fat female
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:44.880]  engagement teams they would come with us on patrols we end up getting rid of two
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:48.480]  of them because they ended up sleeping around cheating on their husbands and
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:52.680]  then their commander was just you're gone get out of here so we had to search
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:56.520]  for a couple more it they can hack it and we never had an issue with these
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:59.880]  women physically not being able to keep up or pull their own weight at all it
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:04.400]  was all the other stuff that goes with it well let me ask you this then why has
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:08.120]  the Marine Corps according what I read years ago lowered standards for women
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:13.880]  so is the army they have to or else they can't get those arbitrary numbers that
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:16.680]  were rammed down their throat they won't get them so how does it work you get a
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:19.360]  bigger group of women and then shake some of them off later than actually find
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.800]  the women that can do it yeah it's just like filtering out they do the same
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:27.080]  so even though the globals are trying to sabotage the Marine Corps it's not
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:31.880]  working you guys are adapting and overcoming oh we're stubborn that's
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:35.360]  that's that's why we have a higher success rate than almost anybody else
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:39.960]  except probably special forces because we we find ways around their their bf so
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:43.920]  to speak that's what you got to do and everybody has to have that will to resist
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:46.080]  the globalists just because they're doing all this doesn't mean they're
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:50.040]  winning we have to resist them at every level every day and it's not work it's
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:55.200]  fun to resist the globalists folks they want to defeat you and rub your face in
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:44:00.480]  the dirt and they're not going to do it go ahead absolutely right and you know
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:04.000]  we get all of the ones we are forced to take and then you find a reason to get
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.600]  rid of the ones that join because they like men and let me bring this point up
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:10.840]  let me bring this point up what happens when frontline women get captured by
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:18.800]  jihadis and we see women on TV that are held by ISIS what happens then oh Alex
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:22.160]  let me tell you what the scariest moment of my life in Afghanistan was I was an
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:27.880]  advisor when a general showed up with a female PR person he was good-looking
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:33.760]  blonde blue-eyed really good-looking there were a thousand Afghans looking at
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.840]  her like she was like wolves to a sheep like one little sheep walked into a
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:41.640]  wolf den it was scared I mean we were terrified and finally the Afghan
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:44.920]  commander came over and said get her out of here right now or else we're gonna
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.200]  have anarchy on this day that she would she would wish she was dead I'll leave
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.760]  it at that I mean that happens when a super beautiful woman a goddess walks
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:58.720]  into a bar a business anywhere it just throws everything into disarray and it's
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:03.600]  just biology why would you stick that in frontline combat it sounds insane
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:09.120]  it isn't saying it's it's somebody pushing an agenda that doesn't have to be
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:13.800]  on the ground and see the consequence they do it all the time look sure I mean
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:16.680]  the liberal minions carrying it out think they're doing social justice
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:19.720]  work stuff but I'm here to tell you captain at the highest levels this is
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:24.840]  designed to finally destroy humans in combat they've done advanced studies
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:28.960]  they know that humans will always be integrated with machines will always be
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:32.960]  needed they don't want that because you can refuse orders that are anti-human
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:38.560]  and they want to go with an all synthetic silicon force that's admitted and so they
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:43.680]  want to sabotage the military now so that in trials in the next decade humans
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:47.600]  can be completely phased out so I just hope the military knows this isn't just
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:53.920]  a war on the military or the US this is a war on humans it absolutely is and
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:57.640]  and they're using more than just women to do it it's rules of engagement it's
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:00.760]  this it's that I mean you name it it's one little one little brick at a time
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:04.120]  till they see when the camel that's right the drones can kill innocent people
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:09.600]  outside of law in a country they're not allowed to be in but if you you know
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:13.040]  have to wait till you're shot at first when you see guys you know pointing
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:18.080]  rifles at you or they have to actually shoot at you they can't just have the
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:20.280]  rifle they have to actually shoot at you and then if they drop it you're not
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:23.960]  allowed to touch them exactly stuff like that that is unbelievable yeah I mean
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:28.800]  that is just I can't believe we put up with this I mean this is and this is the
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:35.480]  very government Obama sending people to war and then letting you get killed
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:41.080]  but they don't care you just a number I mean you learn that right away first
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:43.320]  thing you learn in the military when you're in combat you're just a number
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:47.000]  let me ask you this man what is the sense of the military right now the
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.120]  Marines you talk to others I mean what I've seen is folks really understand
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:53.400]  what's going on now to a great extent with the you know the all the training
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:57.240]  they've got going on for domestic operations the rest of it what percentage
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:01.760]  of the military is somewhat awake versus completely awake
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:05.800]  honestly Alex it's going down the ones that are awake are going down most of
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.480]  the really good officers I know where you look at the guy and go wow this guy's
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:14.040]  amazing they get shown the door for one BS reason or another they get shown the
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:17.480]  door and it's the ones where you go no way will that guy ever get promoted he
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:21.800]  winds up being a major lieutenant colonel so on and so forth wow so so they're
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:27.920]  really sabotaging putting in globalist operatives you could go there yeah with
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:30.800]  that but are they just the idiots that'll do whatever they're told because
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:35.560]  listen the the recently retired military or activity I talked to the people I
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:39.280]  run into all over the country they are super awake to what's going on but are
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.240]  you saying the purge that started the last five six years is starting to have
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.840]  its effect on the officer corps they want yes men they want men that'll just
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:51.080]  nod their head and say yes I'm doing this most are awake and know what's going
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:55.280]  on but if you got to feed your family you you know you get caught in that
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:58.160]  dilemma of are you just going to nod your head and go along with it and keep
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.520]  your job and keep your paycheck coming so you can take care of your family or
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:05.840]  you're just gonna say I'm you know what I've had enough I'm walking push from the
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:08.600]  table and then go find something else to do where you don't have to take part in
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:15.200]  it which that's what I'm doing right now I'm not I've decided you know what if I
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:21.360]  just nod my head I'm culpable so not gonna happen so you decided to just get
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:27.920]  out or what are you deciding to do yeah I'm I'm I decided I'm gonna walk it is a
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:30.960]  hard choice though I mean I'm turning down retirement I'm turning down all
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:37.200]  these you know 12 years feels like you just flushed it but at what point you
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:40.000]  see it getting worse and worse and worse and then you take in this election of
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:46.360]  who's gonna be the commander-in-chief you know what it's it's time like you come
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:49.280]  to that decision personally when how are you gonna stand up and fight this what
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:52.840]  are you gonna do personally not it I don't want to see it come to a shooting
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:55.200]  war in the streets I've been through enough of that stuff in other countries
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:58.440]  I don't let me ask you this can you speak to any of those it's admitted the
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:01.400]  newspapers the Marines do it I've videoed it to myself there's been an
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:06.280]  escalation in the military trying to take on domestic operations what's your
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:13.720]  experience with that we do we actually do but typically what you will see when
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:18.160]  you see that recorded it's what we call a mu it's the guys to go on ships and
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:23.360]  you're kind of the floating emergency response team one of the units that I'm
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:26.080]  an artillery guy one of the things that we get tagged with is the civil
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:29.560]  operation and you do a lot of training for that so if like there's an
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:34.440]  earthquake or something and you go into another country you train to you know
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:40.360]  take care of riots and all that kind of stuff however I mean that is easily
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:44.440]  transferable to the United States and some sometimes they take it to the next
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:47.240]  level and they just go well we don't have roleplayers from these countries
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:50.600]  we're just going to use US people and pretend it's here that absolutely
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:54.120]  happens yes and that's how they at the first level cover it and then start
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:57.400]  trying to condition people but the good news is for 30 years they've been
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:00.760]  trying to train the Marines and Army to openly take out Americans and they
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:03.840]  always have to scale back the training because people start getting really
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:07.600]  upset and it leaks in the press so that's the good news great to hear from
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:12.120]  you Matt God bless and be safe well there goes Matt active duty Marine captain

[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:36.320]  want but Lucy I'll go to you actually after Frank Frank as a marine vet says
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:42.400]  he's four frontline women tell us if I read that incorrectly sir yeah I'm a
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:47.880]  an ex-marine infantryman I've been out for a long time so I actually consider
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:52.400]  myself an ex-marine and I know people don't like to hear that I'm not a marine
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:59.200]  anymore I'm maybe a hybrid I maybe have still some parts you know the Marine
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:02.440]  Corps inside of me I guess you never get rid of but I consider myself to be a
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:07.480]  human now I understand that you're a human who was in the Marine Corps and
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:10.640]  that you understand a lot of that culture is a form of brainwashing the
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:14.000]  difference is they're bringing in new brainwashing and licking their lips up
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.200]  with the military we accept some brainwashing to have a military that
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:20.960]  actually operates and you know these big mechanized armies are pretty unnatural
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:25.560]  but the problem is now it's tailor-made for the real brainwashing of the
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:32.800]  globalist you agree with that yes you'd be surprised to a lot of the guys
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:35.880]  listening that have been out for a few years you probably they probably think
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:41.160]  they're out they've been a deep program but it takes a long time and you you
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:46.000]  know I mean it took me many many many years to realize just how long it
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.400]  lasted with me after I got out but you know the thing is I mean I was kind of
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:55.320]  tongue-in-cheek I you know as you say that I saw it in a movie I can't remember
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:57.920]  the name of the movie I'm not near the internet right now but I think it start
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:03.000]  Demi Moore and it seemed to have worked out pretty good there so that's where
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.640]  Demi Moore becomes an ABC almost tougher than all the guys are you serious to
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:11.840]  believe that you think women in front line combat's good idea you know I guess
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:16.600]  you could make some points off of it as far as maybe people would resist or more
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:23.160]  in demand that Congress you know approve it but no you know I mean oh I get it I
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:26.920]  get your angle hold on hold on I get your angle it's kind of like saying let's
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:30.640]  have a national draft because then people won't have wars I see where you're
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:34.280]  going with that point but I mean I'm just talking about the technicals of women
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:38.840]  in front line combat I mean this is just completely insane Frank thank you

[02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:08.920]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the
[02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:31.280]  GCN radio network
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:34.120]  Mark Dice is gonna be joining us the next time it will continue with your phone
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:38.200]  calls as well an interspersed ton of news we haven't hit yet but right now
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:43.160]  let's go to your phone calls Lucy Lucy in Washington of course we've talked
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:46.840]  about frontline women in the military is that a good idea but Lucy just wants to
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:50.480]  talk about growing our own food actually surviving see the woman doesn't want to
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:54.720]  kill everybody she wants to grow food and safe civilization it's all it's
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:59.440]  really satanic to put women in frontline combat in the warrior role it'd be like
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:03.080]  trying to create artificial wombs and having to be taxpayer paid for cuz I
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:06.440]  feel like I'm a woman and I deserve one that's what we're doing now with these
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:11.160]  sex changes totally unnatural but this is how they're trying to sabotage it so
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:14.240]  here I am trying to make the woman calling in talk about women in front
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:18.320]  line combat and she just wants to uh wants to try to save the soil and
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:22.880]  humanity I see on the topic but Lucy what is your view on that
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:28.880]  uh the women in the military well frontline combat yes oh I think that
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:33.680]  women should be you know raising their families and and you know paying attention
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:39.240]  to their children and their husbands and call me old-fashioned but you know we
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:44.280]  survived thousands of years that way and our our country's being completely
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:50.960]  divided and destroyed because of all of these things going on in our our so
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:55.760]  perfectly absolutely we're being destroyed it's by design it's unnatural
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:01.960]  and who's directing this who says who says with all this well it starts in the
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:05.640]  public schools at five years old and they brainwash them till they're out of
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:10.800]  college and they don't even know how to think for their self anymore and and
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:15.360]  we're being complete this is genocide what's going on where I live we live in
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:22.760]  a sky that is cut in a blanket of complete toxic waste and it is now our
[02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:29.840]  soil lab test of proven our soil is full of aluminum barium strontium and
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:37.280]  they're putting drugs in this spray and people are walking around like zombies
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:40.960]  they don't even look up anymore so you get it we're under globalist attack why
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:44.600]  are we even debating women in the front lines this is all part of their takeover
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:50.320]  exactly everything they do is bad for us by design package that it's for the
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:54.560]  greater good now you called in originally about growing our own food that is the
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:58.960]  answer is getting self-sufficient getting partially off the grid the journey of a
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:04.520]  trillion miles starts with a single step and we're doing it together go ahead
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:10.280]  ma'am how are we going to be able to grow our own food when our soil is so
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:14.160]  contaminated it will no longer grow an organic seed
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:20.440]  monsanto now has aluminum resistant seed and they're constantly doing Chuck Norris
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:23.280]  Chuck Norris sees right through it isn't it positive that now Chuck Norris has
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:26.760]  come out against the geoengineering see I mean it's going on they admit it's
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:31.000]  happening they play this game and tell us it isn't like you never voted voting
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.120]  never existed in the primary silly you know and you know that we always
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:40.600]  sprayed stuff on you no no you're messing with us and we see it I think
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:45.200]  there's a giant awakening happening 6% of people trust the mainstream media so
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:51.360]  that's positive news isn't it yes it is and I am so thankful for Chuck and I
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:55.400]  wish that so many other famous people would come out and I think that that's
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:00.760]  maybe why they killed Prince is because he was talking about the geoengineering
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:05.800]  in the spraying of the planet and the same with a lot of these other famous
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:12.680]  people I think they were just some kind of a ritual of killings or something for
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:17.720]  these evil man they listen yes and that's why a star that isn't making money
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:22.880]  anymore is more valuable to kill because it doubles or triples the catalog of the
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:26.920]  next decade that has been found that's so why that's why they killed John Lennon
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:29.960]  it's why they kill so many other people I've talked to top folks that are scared
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:34.040]  to death when you're out in LA or New York and you're with powerful people
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:39.440]  they all are scared to death and say that there is a mafia killing people and
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:43.040]  you're absolutely right that's why stars could never quit because when they
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:47.200]  become unvaluable to their managers they get murdered and a lot of folks will say
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:50.720]  why am I showing DC and all this iconography because we're talking about
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:54.440]  the rituals we're talking about who's in charge we're talking about what's going
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:05:00.600]  on we're talking about who the enemy is I'm Alex Jones in full wars com Donald
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:06.440]  Trump says a nation without borders is not a nation and we need to build a wall
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:11.160]  across the southern border liberals and much of the mainstream media believe
[02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:16.680]  that Trump's wall to stop illegal immigration stems from racism but wait a
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:21.800]  minute what about Hillary Clinton how come nobody's calling her a racist after
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:29.160]  all it was Hillary who voted for a 700 mile anti-immigration wall in 2006 I
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:33.280]  voted for border security and some of it was a fence I don't think we ever called
[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:36.520]  it a wall maybe in some places it was a wall and don't forget it was only a
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:41.400]  couple of years ago when Hillary sounded just like Donald Trump and I am you
[02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:47.040]  know adamantly against illegal immigrants but now in 2016 it is politically
[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:51.760]  incorrect to secure our borders and that's why Hillary Clinton was for
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:56.800]  building a wall a few years ago but now she is against it and you can check out
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:00.000]  more reports right now at info wars.com

[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:13.400]  Live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide. Live from the info wars.com
[02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:20.960]  studios it's Alex Jones. It's a long way to the top if you want to live in a free
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:26.520]  country and a free planet. It's also a long way to the bottom if you
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:33.840]  lay down. That's a lot harder to do because being a slave is no fun.
[02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:43.920]  He's got the new book out the Illuminati in Hollywood celebrities conspiracies
[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:48.520]  and secret societies in pop culture and the entertainment industry but it ties
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:51.960]  into all the social engineering. We've got a bunch of callers we'll also go to
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:57.200]  on women in the military all these veterans calling and commenting but
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:01.680]  this is the takedown of society the takedown of civilization by the ruling
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:09.240]  class. Mark dice.coms his website he is a social media analyst bestselling
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:16.720]  author and of course Mark dice also is a media analyst social critic political
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:21.520]  activist and author and he's also been part of a lot of national TV shows and
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:25.440]  programs some of the same ones I've been involved in and I like to get him on
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:28.760]  because you know he goes out and listen he's not editing this other than cutting
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:32.960]  out the spaces. Eight out of ten Austinites said that they want to kill
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:37.320]  gun owners and put them in forced labor camps. Nine out of ten Californians he
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:40.720]  talks to and I mean these are both speaking English you know like old white
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:44.880]  guys like I want to put them in you know put gun owners in prison. He's like
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:49.360]  absolutely I'm sick of let's put them all in jail. Hey let's elect Lenin. Hey
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:55.000]  let's you know just as long as you say for Obama they're for it. Students
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:00.080]  competition have gun owners executed in concentration camp. See I was going from
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:02.960]  memory I said they want to put us in jail actually pull the article up in the
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:07.960]  text of the video and it's kill us. People say I exaggerate and nine times out
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:14.080]  of ten or even more it's worse than I'm saying because my own brain dials things
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:22.400]  down. It dials things down. It's like them saying two plus two equals five they
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:25.720]  actually teach that common core or Obama's saying raising the debt limit
[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:29.600]  doesn't raise the debt limit. When I get up here and I say Obama said raising the
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:33.240]  debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit I feel like I'm lying and that new
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:37.240]  listeners tuning in will think I lied because it doesn't sound real even though
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:42.760]  I can play the clip of that exact words or I pledge to you and we will never have
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:48.680]  troops on the ground in Syria 16 times in 2013 and 14 now the White House comes
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:55.320]  out and says we never said that. That doesn't sound truthful to me but they
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:11:01.040]  did it. So I wanted to say oh we have video of them saying kill gun owners but
[02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:04.720]  I literally was about to say that I went no they didn't say that they said put us
[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:13.440]  in prison but then they put the article up and it did say that see when you come
[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:18.800]  face-to-face with the reality so insane in this complex world with evil able to
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:24.320]  manipulate because of the complexity and hide behind it what do you do when
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:30.800]  things are so much weirder than you can even say five million Muslims 80% of them
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:35.960]  the EU admits have fake passports and are right around that number military age
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:41.720]  males every day videos screaming we love Hitler Allah Akbar give us your women
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:47.280]  we want the sex now allowed to rape the police are told don't arrest them that's
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:53.680]  over the top folks it's all over the top so mark dies is with us with a balance
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:57.640]  of the hour than Gucci already comes in but you look at this things that are
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:01.320]  happening Merle Hager comes out and sings a song about Kim Trails and is dead a
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:05.120]  month later Prince is talking about Kim Trails telling man Cali wants to come on
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:09.760]  my show he's dead and they say oh it's an overdose there's an autopsy but not
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:15.080]  with Supreme Court Justice Anthony Scalia Anthony Scalia to anglicize the
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:18.320]  name the media always says I don't know what I'm talking about that's the
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:23.000]  anglicized name of Anthony and his Anthony but I'm I am I am digressing no
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.600]  autopsy but that it's completely normal no autopsy and to say it within minutes
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:30.240]  oh he's been found at totally normal no autopsy oh it was a secret society
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:33.840]  meeting Washington Post reports totally secret connected Bohemian Grove but we
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:37.640]  can't talk about it before they announced that our crew went down there and
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:41.680]  said this is like Bohemian Grove there's devil mask hundreds of them and weird
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:46.520]  effigies of demons eating children and Joe Biggs and investigative journalist
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:51.000]  Wayne Madsen who's in the NSA formally goes I believe this is Bohemian Grove I
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:56.320]  believe Cheney's involved I sense him just the books on the bookshelf and I
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:59.440]  know no and I'm like this is during the break I'm like all right Wayne go ahead
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:03.560]  and say it I respect you but man you're really going on a limb they go on a limb
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:10.160]  and exactly what my crew said was true I see I mean I'm the one going hey don't
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:15.840]  say it's Bohemian Grove come on come Alex there's devil mask everywhere same
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:19.480]  people connected I believe it's Bohemian Grove I'm not making fun of Wayne
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:24.680]  his voice but that's what he sounds like I don't even know what's going on
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:28.720]  anymore I mean it's getting so weird and then Dennis Hastert is recruited out of
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:33.120]  nowhere as a high school coach to become a member of Congress by the
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:36.680]  Republican insiders and then after only being there a few years he's made the
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:43.040]  Speaker of the House and folks it keeps coming out most these leaders are
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:48.640]  pedophiles and I remember talking to people that works at the BBC who were
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:54.000]  trying to come on my show 15 years ago to talk about Jimmy Savelle we can put
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.120]  them on screen of your TV viewer anybody else is Google Jimmy Savelle and they
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:00.760]  said he has necrophilia rooms at his house they take children in and they
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:03.920]  slit they've laid plastic on the floor and bring like eight-year-old girls in
[02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:08.000]  drug and then the Prime Minister slits their throat in front of them and then
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  has sex with the dead body
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:17.640]  and then all of that started coming out in the news he's the best friend of
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:22.480]  Prince Charles and they keep digging up the bodies of fresh dead kids at their
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:28.320]  palaces I don't know what's going on folks but man we're in trouble okay
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:34.000]  because let me tell you they don't just want to rape kids Sandusky was raping
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:37.760]  troubled youth that they could that no one would believe same thing with the
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:41.600]  this child advocate who would not look at Jimmy Savelle and go oh just give
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:44.960]  your small he liked girls small he liked to reportedly slit their throats I
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:49.040]  mean he it was he liked dead bodies but the media is now admitting okay and the
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:55.360]  odd killing them as they begged he would call them I am Satan yeah I believe you
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:58.360]  Savelle I believe you certainly are a high-level demon you want to even looks
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:01.200]  like it's taking full control it's this guy all right I'm gonna go to our guest
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:04.360]  and who knows maybe keep him in the next hour of Anthony wants to have money
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:09.240]  guy could be on for five hours we ought to have him a co-host sometime this is
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:12.040]  what we're dealing with this is the guy that had the highest level security
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:18.880]  above MI6 the royal family just like Sandusky they supply kids said Sandusky
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:24.080]  was so arrogant he would rape 10 11 and 12 year olds in the field house at noon
[02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:32.280]  do you know what a college field house at noon is like a beehive an anthill he
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:35.600]  was supplying him to all these rich people it's all coming the FBI went in
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:42.360]  the former director to cover it up I've set the table here I want to get into
[02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:46.240]  the Illuminati what's happening of course they kill stars that stop making
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:50.800]  money because their catalogs worth double to triple within a few years after
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:54.760]  they're dead it immediately makes 10 15 times for the first month but then it
[02:15:54.760 --> 02:16:00.240]  trails out but that's why they do it and I've talked to major Hollywood stars
[02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:03.880]  major rock stars they go I've got to keep making money and I go why and they
[02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:08.720]  go because people that don't make money die and I've been at high level Hollywood
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:12.320]  meetings folks with Mark Cuban on the phone and stuff it's been in the New
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:15.040]  York Times people read about it with with the White House calling and saying
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:18.960]  I'll put you in jail if you don't if you don't drop this Cuban and then other
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:23.920]  top lawyers like gangsters threatening people going you better watch yourself
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:28.440]  you had got dead kids smoking cigarettes you think this is all just patty cake
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:33.040]  out there now your calls are coming as well as bottom of the RV want to hold
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:35.840]  if you can't understand callers but I'm not disrespecting you I appreciate you
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:38.920]  calling in when we get into the women in the military as well but but mark dies
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:42.800]  so much craziness I don't know where to start there's so much but you just heard
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:47.080]  what I said what's your take on that you know when you talk about such
[02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:51.520]  disturbing crimes it's it's hard to believe that it happens at all but for
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:56.360]  people to try to understand what it is that's going on these sorts of things
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:17:02.760]  are happening within a black magic a black sex magic Illuminati sect because
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:07.560]  this is the only explanation for such crimes happening on such a massive and
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:12.120]  institutional level and you talked about quite a different cases that are
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:17.720]  actually all tied together it back in the 1980s there were d notices which were
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:20.400]  sent which are the equivalent of a national security letter which is a
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:25.480]  gag order by its in members of parliament who are investigating Jimmy
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:32.240]  Seville and the black sex magic child pedophile cults so higher level members
[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:38.040]  within parliament or within the the jurors the justice system stopped them
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:42.520]  from investigating those individuals and former detectives have come forward
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:47.960]  from Scotland Yard and said that there is a secret society of high level
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:52.920]  members of parliament who murder children in satanic ritual and let me just stop
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:58.280]  you if your TV viewers are showing you inside the the ranch in South Texas 20
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:01.120]  thousand acres on the border with the satanic mask everywhere and the little
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:04.880]  children's beds outside the room and all the rest of them a skip this break this
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:08.080]  is so important you can pull up hundreds of mainstream articles now in
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:12.560]  England in the UK where they admit national threat our governments run by
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:17.880]  pedophiles now what David Ike said 20 years ago has now all been admitted and
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:23.080]  David Ike told me on air 15 years ago that Seville slit children's throat with
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:27.680]  the prime minister and I was actually delaying him editing it because I it
[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:32.880]  wasn't proven yet go ahead mark dice similar allegations have been made
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:37.000]  regarding elements of the Bohemian Grove and this is detailed in my book the
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:41.160]  Illuminati in Hollywood and I'm not saying that every member of the Bohemian
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:46.320]  Grove participates in this front for induction of the real cold yeah there's
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:50.720]  there's about 120 different subgroups within the Bohemian but what happened to
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:54.200]  your reporter you said and that got us more footage they then set him up put
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:59.560]  him in present I don't play games when you kick a bee's hive and you start
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:04.040]  causing a little bit too much trouble that that's when deaths start happening so
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:08.560]  people like Michael Hastings who was the award-winning Rolling Stone reporter who
[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:13.640]  died in a mysterious car crash that appears to be from car hacking now
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:16.720]  people will laugh at it that's a conspiracy theory but much of your
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:20.920]  audience probably knows that there's a very real possibility automakers have
[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:24.560]  come forward security analysts have come and said yeah you can hack into cars and
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:28.400]  cause them to crash former high-level terrorism analysts Richard Clark
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:31.880]  admitted that Michael Hastings may very well have been murdered by car hacking
[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:35.760]  but proving that's going to be almost impossible because the forensics very
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:39.720]  difficult to prove and convincing a jury of this is quite impossible to get
[02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:43.600]  them to wrap their mind around it so essentially what's happening is at the
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:48.840]  highest levels within this invisible empire this Illuminati mafia which
[02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:52.800]  unfortunately has been morphed in the minds of the masses to convince them
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:57.200]  that it's a cool secret society of celebrities and is the key to success
[02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:01.280]  which is really just a front and the biggest take home from your videos that
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:05.240]  you've been making the point is why would anyone want to be a mega celebrity
[02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:10.560]  because they're almost all slaves they're almost all totally controlled by
[02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:14.280]  their managers totally scared and they end up dying broke everybody asked why
[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:17.920]  do they die broke it's not bad business decisions most times it's all a giant
[02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:21.960]  scam Prince realized this and that's why when he couldn't get out of his
[02:20:21.960 --> 02:20:26.680]  contract disputes of Warner Brothers he literally wrote the word slave on his
[02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:32.160]  cheek as he performed because when these stars sign those contracts they have to
[02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:38.080]  they're legally binding and obligated to to perform what the contracts say it
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:43.760]  provided that it's not criminal activity now so Prince he had signed on the dotted
[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:49.760]  line and he had to perform he had to produce new albums and new songs and
[02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:55.520]  when he had disputes about this he tried to tell the fans what was going on by
[02:20:55.520 --> 02:21:01.640]  writing slave on his forehead and it gets so so bad that in the contracts and
[02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:05.520]  this is why I have an attorney look over a contract before I sign it with any
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:09.800]  company or appearing on any show which costs $400 an hour just a higher an
[02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:15.800]  attorney to review a contract as you know so in the contracts they have
[02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:20.320]  clauses in there about arbitration so these celebrities most of the time can't
[02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:26.080]  even sue their record labels or the studios or their boss because in a
[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:30.040]  court of law it's public all the evidence is public people could come in and
[02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:34.880]  watch and participate and see what's happening so in an arbitration that's a
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:42.840]  private sort of a legal discussion it's a private trial between judges and
[02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:47.200]  private arbitration firms and so in almost every contract it literally every
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:50.760]  contract I mean not almost every contract these people sign there are
[02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:56.360]  arbitration clauses in there so even if they have a dispute they can't sue their
[02:21:56.360 --> 02:22:00.880]  boss because they have already agreed that they will not sue them in a court
[02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:03.600]  of law they'll take them into arbitration but it's come out about
[02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:06.280]  Pellecano and all these private detectives and people that are really
[02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:11.760]  basically hit men according to the reports in entertainment is the real
[02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:16.080]  mafia is over entertainment and I've been there it's Jewish mafia Italian
[02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:21.200]  mafia mainly but then they've even got bosses up above them the CIA comes in
[02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:25.440]  and tells them what to put in scripts what to do that's now openly admitted
[02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:29.760]  what did you think of the whole Beyonce situation when I said all this anti cop
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:33.720]  stuff all this anti-police state stuff is to make anti-police state look dumb
[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:36.800]  it's what the cause of classic civilizations her new thing is to make
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:41.040]  women hate men Gloria Steinem was funded by the CIA the Super Bowl is funded by
[02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:44.600]  the government and I showed all the articles and they had hundreds of
[02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:47.960]  publications come out and say I was insane mark but you've written books
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:53.880]  about the the CIA more than anybody manipulating the media it's an open
[02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:59.560]  secret it's confirmed on their own website the CIA analysts who continue to
[02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:03.640]  work for the entertainment liaison office openly admit this so that's what I
[02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:08.120]  detailed in my book the Illuminati in Hollywood and you're very right you
[02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:13.800]  articulated so well because celebrity in Hollywood really shaped the country more
[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:18.480]  than Washington DC and then political power because the masses follow
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:23.640]  celebrities as if they were their their gods as if they were their parents as if
[02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:29.160]  they are these all-knowing beings and so that's why we see Beyonce chosen to
[02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:33.880]  perform at the Super Bowl halftime show in order to demonize police which many
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:38.240]  police officers and captains and precincts have come out and admitted that her
[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:43.920]  and the other Black Lives Matter propaganda is putting police officers at
[02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:46.720]  risk now nobody in the right mind is supporting police brutality there's
[02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:49.920]  obviously always going to be some bad apples these are individuals who are
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:54.640]  putting their lives on the line to try to clean up a terrible and and wretched
[02:23:54.640 --> 02:23:59.880]  society and so the the central intelligence agency literally works
[02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:05.520]  hand-in-hand with Hollywood to promote certain aspects in films in television
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:11.120]  shows it was even admitted that the CIA worked with hip-hop artists in Cuba as
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:18.560]  they were attempting to try to format a Cuban revolution so that the the popular
[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:23.960]  underground hip-hop artists in Cuba would then be fed CIA propaganda in
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:29.880]  order to participate and encourage in the Cuban revolution in order to try to
[02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:34.560]  topple the communist regime so how assinine is it when they come out and
[02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:37.960]  admit the Defense Department others are funding almost everything at the halftime
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:42.080]  shows she's clearly pushing the official Soros agenda and then I say she should
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:45.800]  be investigated and they act like I'm nuts they really think their viewers and
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:51.880]  readers are idiots it unfortunately that is the case you know you posted my
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:56.240]  latest man on the street Monday video where I used an old elementary school
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:59.440]  joke telling people that the word gullible had been removed from the
[02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:04.040]  dictionary now I don't know if anybody if everybody's heard that joke but it was
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:08.600]  an old joke from when I was a kid in elementary school and it is oh really
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:11.680]  it's been taken out of the dictionary and then you poke on it I'm and say oh
[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:16.960]  you're so gullible obviously and so we have adults now that are seriously
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:20.960]  commenting and this was the third time that I did the same segment I also did
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:25.200]  one where I told people that they've removed the word intelligence from the
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:31.360]  dictionary and we have adults that are out there driving vehicles and live
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:36.080]  amongst us that seriously believe and then comment on me telling them that the
[02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:40.600]  word gullible has been removed from the dictionary to make room for new words and
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:45.720]  if that doesn't illustrate how dumb down America is I don't know what does and my
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:50.120]  man on the street Monday series the petition videos are really the most
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:54.480]  disturbing because it's not just people commenting and showing hey they don't
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:25:57.880]  know anything they're uninformed these are people signing their name and
[02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:01.720]  they're in other personal information on a supposed petition to enact
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:06.920]  legislation that nobody in their right mind should even consider that anybody
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:10.680]  who has any intelligence should obviously know there's a pure joke we're
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:12.840]  gonna play some of those clips coming up in the next segment after we take some
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:18.000]  calls let me ask you this question it seems the dumbing down is accelerating
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:22.360]  where now most people have no attention span they don't even know where they are
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:27.200]  is this from television watching or what's going on because it seems to be
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:31.800]  getting worse very very quickly well social media has a lot to do with this
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:36.880]  now I mean we have a whole video service vine which is dedicated to looping seven
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:41.280]  second video so people's attention span is literally that of a goldfish and
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:46.120]  they're entertained by little seven second funny video so social media has
[02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:51.600]  largely destroyed the attention span it is literally rewiring people's brains
[02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:58.920]  the the the public now they can only comprehend very small bits of data their
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:03.360]  long-term memory isn't storing data like it used to because their their conscious
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:07.360]  mind is not prioritizing it because they think that they can just look up
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:12.840]  information on the internet or Google it so they're not retaining information and
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:17.440]  so they're so easily manipulated the man on the street Monday petition series
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:22.000]  which people can check out on youtube.com slash mark dice there are alex 50
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:25.840]  different episodes now of repealing the bill of rights repeal the First
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:30.400]  Amendment give Obama immunity for any crime that he's committed add
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:35.760]  steroids to the water supply any insane idea that I could come up with so this
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:40.200]  isn't just an isolated incident of one afternoon I was able to get people to
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:44.040]  sign a petition to repeal the bill of rights or throw gun owners into FEMA
[02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:47.520]  camps and have the Marines go door-to-door confiscate guns from people's
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:54.440]  homes 50 different episodes now of crazy petitions for insane legislation and
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:59.040]  mark let me expand on this so many ignorant trolls the people on the street
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:03.560]  asked me to they go that mark dice guy why is he like to make fun of people why
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:10.080]  is he so mean why doesn't he inform them you're there like you know showing in a
[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:15.920]  film Appalachian children that don't know how to write you're not putting
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:19.240]  down the Appalachian children you're showing that they're totally ignorant
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:24.440]  they have new studies out showing GPS is rewiring our brains to where we don't
[02:28:24.440 --> 02:28:30.720]  have any access to spatial direction when I used to drive around just four or
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:34.920]  five years ago before I had GPS I would look at the Sun where I was what roads I
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:39.920]  had an internal understanding and now I notice because of GPS I've been
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:44.160]  losing it just like calculators we don't know basic math anymore we're being
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:48.440]  killed by technology the way it's been deployed the way it's been rolled out we
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:55.000]  are dying we are falling apart our bone mass is going down we are dying mark
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:00.520]  people are communicating with emojis now which are little graphics that are
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:06.080]  supposed to depict certain emotions and if for anybody who uses Twitter and for
[02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:10.520]  those who don't know people are communicating you can see it with emojis
[02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:15.560]  now and instead of even texting which is a waste of time I mean in a 60 second
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:19.080]  conversation over the phone you can communicate more data than you can
[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:24.400]  worth in an hour of texting back and forth and so now people are wasting their
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:30.640]  time to scroll through their emoji keyboard to pick a photo that they feel
[02:29:30.640 --> 02:29:35.720]  depicts what it is that they're feeling to communicate instead of the end of the
[02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:39.520]  spoken word the end of language and they admit the language is now shrinking
[02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:43.760]  which the Fabian Socialists of England that basically run the whole show admit
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:48.280]  is their plan the Fabian Socialist system is a wolf in sheep's clothing because
[02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:51.160]  they're not socialists they're Satanists that want to kill you and your family the
[02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:58.120]  empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:05.680]  all the perplexities the confusion and distress in America arise not from
[02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:10.000]  objects in their Constitution or Confederation not from want of honor or
[02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:14.320]  virtue so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin credit
[02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:18.640]  and circulation those are the words of John Adams the second president of the

[02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:27.640]  the nature of our fiat currency do you understand how a private corporation has
[02:30:27.640 --> 02:30:32.120]  the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it what kind of
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:36.480]  leverage to these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people or
[02:30:36.480 --> 02:30:41.000]  for that matter what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money will you

[02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:11.640]  scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ
[02:32:11.640 --> 02:32:15.720]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[02:32:15.720 --> 02:32:19.800]  adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family in the water they took
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:24.400]  the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis
[02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:28.600]  worsened as it still is worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare
[02:32:28.600 --> 02:32:33.920]  yourself and your family now in 2016 even more information has been revealed
[02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:38.480]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut which many experts are

[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:51.000]  truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen

[02:33:18.440 --> 02:33:27.680]  tyranny so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones I've
[02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:31.600]  read most the ancient philosophers I've probably read 500 history books no
[02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:40.240]  exaggeration and 300 400 history books hundreds of history magazines and it's
[02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:43.320]  all really right there if you're educated and informed none of this is
[02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:48.640]  really even hidden there were always people on the castle up the road that
[02:33:48.640 --> 02:33:50.560]  you didn't want to have your kids playing around it because your kids would
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:54.200]  disappear some of them want to rape and kill your kids other ones just want to
[02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:59.040]  torture them to death it's the old thing of you know Transylvania don't get
[02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:06.720]  near castle dragon dracool castle dragon now is in London England is literally
[02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:11.640]  castle dragon King George thought he killed the dragon but the dragon moved
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:15.160]  in later there was earlier English and Norman royalty but the royalty they have
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:21.000]  now is Transylvania and that's what I mean truth is so much stranger than
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:27.800]  fiction I was eating a organic chicken leg during the break and bit my lip you
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:30.440]  know I'm getting in such a hurry nowadays Mark sitting there talking about
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:36.040]  eating a chicken leg eat my lunch here on air and I get so sped up by stutter
[02:34:36.040 --> 02:34:43.200]  I falter I bite myself you know in my frothing attempt to expose what's going
[02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:46.960]  on in my desperation because the general public's been dumbed down and it's
[02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:53.840]  getting worse some people are waking up it's a large minority but the elite
[02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:57.720]  themselves are getting more delusional more reckless and if you study
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:04.440]  criminology these master criminals are very OCD but at a certain point they
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:08.520]  start degenerating and wanting to get caught like serial killers because that's
[02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:14.720]  what they are and they always have protection systems around them that are
[02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:18.240]  supposed to keep the truth from coming out because they set up a system where
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:23.160]  they're at the top everybody's dependent on them and if you remove the cancer it
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:28.840]  cuts into the flesh of the overall system and kills it so they know what
[02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:34.520]  they're doing at very wicked instinctive levels but at a certain point they
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:37.720]  start wars they do crazy things that even bring them down I think we're
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:39.920]  reaching that point we're go back to Mark Dyson we've had collars forever
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:43.080]  holding this ties into the social engineering I want to get his take on
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:45.760]  women in front line in the military I'm gonna give each caller about a minute
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:49.560]  you've been holding so long to then get into manipulation of social media that's
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:53.520]  going on they're incrementally turning it up more and more restrictions more and
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:56.960]  more squeezing more and more sensory when you hear Zuckerberg talk about he
[02:35:56.960 --> 02:36:00.960]  talks about don't worry I'm gonna dial back the nationalist well you know what
[02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:05.000]  let's dial them back so Mark Dyson wants to get into that I want to play a few
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.520]  of these clips as well be with us a little bit in the next hour and then
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:11.200]  Anthony Guciardi takes over but I think I'm gonna cause part of the next hour
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:16.480]  with dice and Guciardi if he can keep going with us I'll ask dice right now
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:19.600]  and find out briefly I'm gonna go to these calls now and I appreciate you
[02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:24.960]  holding patiently Ray in Ohio been holding forever and Bill in Indiana and
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:29.800]  Mustard Craig and Robert and that'll be it for calls during at least the part of
[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:33.120]  the show I'm hosting today we have the fourth hour that I co-host sometimes but
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:37.680]  normally is hosted by others because I really can't do four hours routinely and
[02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:41.120]  not to send into bedlam but it is good to have that fourth hour a lot of folks
[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:45.240]  want it but but what's really going on with people that run DC what's really
[02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:48.160]  happening what's their ultimate end game where are they really going I'm gonna
[02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:55.360]  ask Mark that question a moment and then go right to your calls briefly this is
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:59.000]  an information war and I want to thank you all for your support we couldn't do
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.640]  it without you it's amazing what we've done and thank you for your prayers as

[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:18.120]  reviews I set out with the top experts to bring the true game changers because
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:21.280]  I treat others as I want to be treated plus even though I was a sociopath I
[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:24.600]  want to show you the very best stuff out there at a great price so I dominate
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:29.080]  the market almost no one else does that they go even the big manufacturers that
[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:32.160]  produce quality stuff they go look most big companies come to us they want
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:35.440]  private labels these are the big factories and they want private labels
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:40.240]  but they want us to just be okay have $3 a product then they put $10 of
[02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:45.440]  marketing into each bottle instead you put $20 of product in and then do
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:50.640]  basically a dollar of marketing on your own show it's total game changer which
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:55.760]  I would just think this is what you do this is what made America great I mean
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:59.360]  I don't believe in planned obsolescence either I want to sell you something
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:03.320]  that's really high quality I mean if I made cars I'd want the engine to go as
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:08.760]  long as I could get it to but I guess I'm a weirdo I'm gonna go back to Mark
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:11.480]  Dyson we're going right to these calls and Mark's gonna co-host with us here
[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:15.720]  Mark what do you think the in-game the bottom of the rabbit hole where is this
[02:39:15.720 --> 02:39:21.760]  going ultimately they're they're paving the path for this planet to be ruled by
[02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:28.560]  an entity a demonic entity the counterfeit Christ so I believe it's
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:31.200]  quite obvious if you're just if you've been following this for any amount of
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:35.520]  time they're destroying the very fabric of the human race the fabric of the
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:40.480]  family the knowledge base the common sense trying to this is how aliens
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:47.640]  masquerading as humans would hit us that this is in an entity destroying the
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:52.560]  human race to create so much chaos so that people don't know the fact from
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:57.680]  fiction so that when this entity arrives or is manifested through his
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:02.560]  chief humanoid type of servant the Antichrist and announces that he's God
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:05.880]  he will announce really that he is Lucifer that he is Satan here this he
[02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:09.320]  is overthrown the kingdom of heaven you're seeing Bible prophecy being
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:13.800]  fulfilled and it's going to be this liberal supposed utopia and any
[02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:19.440]  conservatives any Christians anyone who is is trying to point out or stop or
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:23.640]  slow this kind of poisoning and destruction of the human race will be
[02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:27.800]  targeted for termination and they're gonna have super high-tech drugs they
[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:31.000]  already have them that are synthetic that quote don't have any side effects
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.880]  but takes your will wire heads plugging in I mean people are gonna sell out to
[02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:39.720]  this you're already seeing the viciousness and the hatred towards
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:44.040]  Christians towards people who believe in God towards conservatives we can get
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:48.560]  into the social media manipulation in a minute but the ultimate end game is to
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:53.600]  destroy the very foundation of knowledge and and reality amongst the human
[02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:58.920]  race yes in order to pave the path for this counterfeit Christ the global
[02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:03.040]  Messiah who will declare that he is Satan and has overthrown the evil
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:08.320]  tyrannical Yahweh God and he will announce that this is the new heaven and
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:10.760]  the new earth and that anyone who's trying to stop him needs to be
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:14.680]  exterminated he's a Yahweh God that has men and women together and children and
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:18.720]  and beauty and honor and all the great stuff it's all going down the tubes the
[02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:22.160]  trees are gonna die the oceans gonna die and just nothing but potbellied
[02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:26.920]  trendies flopping around worshipping the devil God I mean what kind of God wants
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:32.600]  to make everybody ugly and stupid a demonic entity and unfortunately this
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:36.600]  is what's happening in society and now social media has obviously been taken
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:39.800]  over by the big media we're gonna get to that mark you're awesome let's get to
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:42.600]  these callers what is your view on women the military briefly we're going to the
[02:41:42.600 --> 02:41:47.360]  callers well obviously this is part of the agenda to try to break down the
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:53.240]  the traditional gender roles which you know what God and nature design so you
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:57.880]  can't argue with the creation and what we were created to do and no kidding
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:01.680]  men do the fighting women have the babies yeah and this in the whole
[02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:05.400]  transgender bathroom issue and choose your own gender choose your choose your
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:10.040]  own species is a symptomatic of this liberal mental disorder the poisoning
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:13.880]  the destruction of the minds of people so if we're going to use liberal logic
[02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:17.840]  then I guess we're gonna have to have more women as roofers you know it's gonna
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:20.720]  be what we should start calling it sexist when somebody says that it's a
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:24.520]  garbage man because we need more women to collect the garbage no we have
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:30.440]  certain roles that have society has been abiding by because those are what
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:35.560]  nature would God design and so by trying to fight this design they're really
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:39.660]  fighting against what God created exactly women are being taken off their
[02:42:39.660 --> 02:42:43.480]  pedestal because the devil hates them because they're so magic and in God's
[02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:47.000]  greatest creation in my view it's absolutely evil let's go to phone calls
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.880]  right now thank you for holding Ray in Ohio is a Navy vet what a trooper they
[02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:55.440]  give us your view on overruling the Marine Corps and everybody just know
[02:42:55.440 --> 02:42:58.840]  we're gonna put women in front line and make the packs a third the size and
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:06.080]  that's just the end of it okay go ahead yes Alex I I'm a Navy veteran and I
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:11.680]  served on a destroyer back in the 1980s and in that in those days women's
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:17.320]  served in a supporting role like on on supply ships rather than combat vessels
[02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:22.760]  and and I and I and I believe that putting women in combat roles is
[02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:27.440]  definitely weakens our military one thing that the Navy drilled into you
[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:31.400]  when you were receiving your training in boot camp was and they emphasize this
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:35.320]  over and over and over pay attention to detail pay attention to detail and it
[02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:39.280]  wasn't about you know so much folding your clothes properly or making your
[02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:42.640]  bunk properly the idea was to get you to pay attention to these details so that
[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:46.520]  when you got to the fleet you didn't jeopardize the lives of your crew
[02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:50.720]  members because you were distracted by something and I can tell you this when
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:55.640]  you're out on a Navy ship for weeks at a time if there were women on board those
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:59.760]  combat ships you definitely would have been distracted and and it's I think
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:06.720]  it's detrimental to the to the lives and to the missions of the military why
[02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:10.480]  do you think they're doing this sabotage the military you know I wonder
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:15.200]  about that too you know and I and my question I guess from Mark would be when
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:18.840]  you what when you watch television dramas when you watch television sitcoms as
[02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:24.880]  you've talked about Alex the men are always made to look like fools like in
[02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:28.200]  the sitcoms and then in the television dramas the police dramas the hospital
[02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:32.520]  dramas you're constantly seeing men having to give an answer to women and I
[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:37.440]  wondered if Mark thought that you know maybe the the emphasis to put women in
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:43.640]  combat roles is just a an extension of this to see a great this magazine the
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:49.200]  sea it's all on record mark and again Hollywood controls the minds of the
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:53.800]  masses not Washington DC and so that's why you see these radical feminist
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:45:00.320]  agendas being portrayed the radical LGBT agenda portrayed now with gay and
[02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:05.200]  bisexual characters being introduced into almost every show children's shows on
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:10.880]  the Disney Channel etc all part of conditioning people to accept it because
[02:45:10.880 --> 02:45:14.760]  people will deny that the media affects society and said that it's just
[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:18.480]  entertainment but any serious media analyst or anyone with common sense
[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:23.240]  knows that the media shapes their culture it's called advertising it's just
[02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:27.520]  another mind game absolutely great point Ray great point mark dies let's talk to
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:37.000]  Bill in Indiana bill your take hey Alex you ready yes sir okay I want to talk to
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:44.720]  you about or ask mark about what he knows about the number 11 as in the 9-11
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:50.160]  yeah why are the elites obsessed with numbers he wants Fukushima this is the
[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:54.440]  30th anniversary of Chernobyl all this crazy stuff going on it's like they're
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:59.040]  trying to kill the planet you know I don't know too much about numerology but
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:04.280]  I do know that at certain levels within the hierarchy they are into planetary
[02:46:04.280 --> 02:46:09.680]  alignments and the sacred geometry so they believe that that numbers and
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:15.920]  mathematics have certain scientific power and so whether they actually do or
[02:46:15.920 --> 02:46:20.800]  not it really isn't the issue the issue is that they believe it does so it
[02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:24.240]  appears that they're following this pattern but I don't get too much into
[02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:29.080]  the numerology of it because there's clear evidence of you know not 11
[02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:32.760]  cover-ups and inside jobs but it's an interesting phenomena point is these
[02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:36.920]  people are into the occult they are spiritual people while denying on the
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:40.920]  surface that there is any sort of creator or any sort of spiritual
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:47.120]  connections to us but they are covertly occult it's just like communists for 30
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:50.160]  years are ordered by their bosses to say they're anarchist but then admit their
[02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:53.520]  communists when they're waving red flags it's just like they say oh they're
[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:58.040]  atheists but at the top they'll tell you no I worship Lucifer and so that's first
[02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:02.000]  how they do it I tell you there is no God so the state can become God that's
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:10.400]  how this works but Bill you got a point on Fukushima yeah Alex yeah we really
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:14.240]  need to talk to a guy named Kevin Blanche he's an outstanding he's the
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:24.240]  number one guy for nuclear activism and he talks about the cover-up of Fukushima
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:30.720]  that now WikiLeaks has emails from Hillary and John Holdren of Cal Berkeley
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:37.480]  where they sent in those 32 shifts from a Reagan battle group oh well of course
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:40.200]  it's known that they knew they were getting ready to cover that up yes yes
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:43.680]  we'll look into that a good point it just shows how they're killing us all
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:46.960]  poisoning us all with GMO but then telling us all day about our different
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:49.440]  rights I want to go to break come back with some more calls but Mark start
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:55.200]  getting into social media manipulation because social media is such a important
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:59.520]  aspect in most people's lives now that it has been taken over by these big
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:04.160]  corporations and their terms of service all at the Sun Valley conference which
[02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:07.720]  is the Bilderberg group meeting for media where they all meet together to
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:12.560]  coordinate their terms of service every July have the heads of the CIA and the
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:19.080]  NSA come there and and this is why these services Twitter Facebook etc all
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:25.040]  coordinate and have become the top social media services coordinating their
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:28.800]  terms of service coordinating manipulation so because most people now in
[02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:33.360]  America around the world get their news just from their friends Facebook feeds
[02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:38.000]  so Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg and the same with Twitter they easily and this
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:43.360]  is quite provable manipulate the data that is posted on people's feeds so for
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:46.600]  example if I post something on my Facebook page that's about a hundred and
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:51.000]  fifty thousand people subscribe to it if it has certain keywords in it if it
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:55.400]  slants to a particular way if it's trying to put out a certain piece of
[02:48:55.400 --> 02:49:00.400]  information that Facebook doesn't want spread they simply won't allow that post
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:04.440]  to show up that's right we now post videos of Facebook at first it'd be a
[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:08.560]  million two million three million viewers and then the algorithm kicked in and
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:12.680]  now it won't let it be shared someone has to physically do it and it'll still
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:16.920]  try to block it and people say well why don't they just kick you off no they
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:20.360]  want me to stay there and not go build my own thing so I guess Matt drudge is
[02:49:20.360 --> 02:49:24.720]  right just completely leave it but at the same time I can go there have a beach
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:28.800]  head show people how I'm being censored and bring them back to info wars.com so
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:32.880]  I'm not sure if I'm right or drudge is right what do you think well if they
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:36.160]  completely censor you and shut you down and ban you that's going to create a
[02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:39.520]  lot more problems and a lot more bring a lot more attention to it and so they'll
[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:43.040]  sort of let you be but they put you off into the corner and they censor you
[02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:48.200]  through their algorithms now for my videos I'll post my videos on Facebook if
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:52.000]  it's a YouTube link they don't want people leaving Facebook so it dumps it
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:55.600]  down the memory hole hardly anybody sees it so if I upload the video to my
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:50:00.840]  Facebook video feed still hardly anybody sees it there are other channels other
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:06.920]  Facebook pages that upload my videos and they get five seven million views that's
[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:09.960]  what I was about to say in fact I'm glad you said this because we we don't have an
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:13.760]  algorithm we have our brains which are even more advanced than that and I've
[02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:16.640]  noticed that we'll put up some sensational video it's a half million views
[02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:20.520]  but some little channel that was never political puts it up five million views
[02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:25.200]  eight million views yes and so everybody get our Facebook mentions copy them to
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:29.560]  your YouTube vice versa give them other headlines sometimes give them a weird
[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:33.680]  headline the computer won't see it and then it goes mega viral absolutely Mark
[02:50:33.680 --> 02:50:37.800]  it's amazing you know the petition videos that I've done on YouTube that get
[02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:41.680]  you know several hundred thousand views people upload those on their Facebook
[02:50:41.680 --> 02:50:46.200]  page and if it's not my page they'll get a million five million views if I
[02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:50.160]  upload on mine yeah maybe 10 so everybody see you're saying folks are
[02:50:50.160 --> 02:50:53.560]  authorized to get your videos the mind to put them on your Facebook put them on
[02:50:53.560 --> 02:50:57.800]  your YouTube make them go viral as long as they don't edit them correct mark you
[02:50:57.800 --> 02:51:00.920]  know I would prefer to post links or share them which stay there stay there
[02:51:00.920 --> 02:51:06.440]  stay there I'll people step on out about the new war on the power grid if so this

[02:54:00.800 --> 02:54:12.400]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network you know Mark just
[02:54:12.400 --> 02:54:15.320]  brought up something that's so important that I mean to spend more time on
[02:54:15.320 --> 02:54:20.360]  there we know there are algorithms and it's come out in the news that say when
[02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:25.560]  Navy SEALs were spreading a meme that they went and fought she stood down they
[02:54:25.560 --> 02:54:30.920]  died just real simple little memes little images that Facebook would block that
[02:54:30.920 --> 02:54:35.360]  and not let it be shared and that's just one known example they do it all the
[02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:39.400]  time now Zuckerberg meets with all the big you know communist Chinese
[02:54:39.400 --> 02:54:44.280]  executives to do this and it's getting worse and worse and worse but I've
[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:50.520]  noticed if I do satirical stuff that's actually pro-establishment the AI is
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:54.480]  smart enough to actually think but dumb enough to understand that I'm being
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:59.880]  pro-establishment and suddenly that'll go viral and again we can look with our
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:03.680]  systems whether it's being shared person-to-person or whether it's being
[02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:08.480]  allowed through they will push stuff these computers are so stupid at certain
[02:55:08.480 --> 02:55:13.520]  points that's because we're thinking the computers only work against unconscious
[02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:17.880]  people that aren't thinking we can outsmart these machines folks I don't
[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:21.640]  care how fancy they get by changing rhythms what we're doing and what Mark
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:24.600]  said is so key now Mark doesn't obviously bring in as much capital as we do to
[02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:27.240]  fund our operation so he's like well I don't know like let everybody just have
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:32.240]  my films I barely make anything on my Facebook or on my YouTube as it is and
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:35.840]  I get that but he was pointing out how his videos go more viral on other people's
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:40.960]  pages he's been censored he's had his stuff taken down before for simply
[02:55:40.960 --> 02:55:44.360]  saying you know that was that Michael Reagan shouldn't talk about shoving
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:48.400]  hand grenades up children's rear ends or whatever it was I'm not taking Michael
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:50.960]  Reagan either it was a horrible statement and then he got in trouble for
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:55.440]  saying please you know don't call for killing people so this is going on but
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:55:58.600]  we stay there to try to keep him honest because they advertise that they're
[02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:02.200]  trying to be free and open and it's this commons and as long as you follow their
[02:56:02.200 --> 02:56:05.940]  rules it's okay but now they selectively enforce because Facebook says not
[02:56:05.940 --> 02:56:10.680]  agreeing with someone as hate speech they might ban you and so oh I put out a
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:14.080]  meme against Hillary they let us know you're locked off your site for one day
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:18.640]  do it again it's 15 days then you get I mean I've shown this on air then do it
[02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:23.520]  again it's 30 days and then stuff from Facebook you know we're really being
[02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:27.680]  nice to you and you know why don't you leave us alone and then I go only buy
[02:56:27.680 --> 02:56:32.040]  advertisement on Facebook suddenly oh my gosh everything's getting seen so people
[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:36.440]  don't know there's this control Mark's just telling you hey it's going on be
[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:39.720]  aware of it so what do we do all of us have to build our own website our own
[02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:45.120]  platform and then basically use it to take over these other forums and point
[02:56:45.120 --> 02:56:48.320]  out what's going on within them I mean is that the answer or what do we do Mark
[02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:53.760]  dash you know you info wars operations an incredible example of this because
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:57.760]  nobody tells you guys what to do or what you can't do and you're able to use
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:02.280]  these mainstream platforms these social media platforms to reach people but you
[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:07.920]  don't need to rely on them for your message to get out so we need to jam the
[02:57:07.920 --> 02:57:12.840]  system we need to spread through the grassroots through old email lists from
[02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:16.920]  face-to-face conversations about what it is it's going on so that we can expose
[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:21.080]  this to everybody else you just said you just I've talked to all the top experts
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:25.040]  everybody's got to get on our email list folks because they're censoring more
[02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:28.760]  that's a way very hard for them to block us info wars dot com port slash
[02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:32.440]  newsletter everyone should go sign up there to get key reports videos but as
[02:57:32.440 --> 02:57:37.240]  stuff gets worse that is so key mark have you set up an email system yet it's on
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:41.120]  my list of things to do but I haven't done it yet and I mean I understand we're
[02:57:41.120 --> 02:57:43.720]  too busy fighting the globalists have ever tried to create you know just
[02:57:43.720 --> 02:57:47.400]  databases to market or whatever and that's secondary for us we're just
[02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:50.800]  trying to get the word out I want everybody to know you can take any video
[02:57:50.800 --> 02:57:55.680]  we've made anything we've done put on any video platform you want to do
[02:57:55.680 --> 02:58:00.360]  whatever I don't care just don't claim you have ownership of it and don't edit
[02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:05.000]  it out of context or I will enforce my copyright and my rights because I have
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:08.280]  had folks try to get my videos and then say they're theirs no you can't do that
[02:58:08.280 --> 02:58:11.200]  but but if you want to take my films and put them out on Facebook or any other
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:16.000]  platform please do it we're in a war mark sorry go ahead I don't authorize
[02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:20.360]  that for my work because people abuse it and try to use my content to create and
[02:58:20.360 --> 02:58:23.960]  expand their own channel their own Facebook page I do admire what what it
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:27.440]  is that you're doing I at this time don't do not authorize that I encourage
[02:58:27.440 --> 02:58:31.280]  people sharing the original links but don't download and re-upload the video
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:35.240]  because what that does is it removes people who would find my channel no I
[02:58:35.240 --> 02:58:38.760]  understand I totally understand that you're that's your way of doing it I'm
[02:58:38.760 --> 02:58:41.760]  just in full attack mode here I'm just firing all directions just throwing
[02:58:41.760 --> 02:58:44.840]  hang grenades the enemy and folks I need you the listeners to get every video
[02:58:44.840 --> 02:58:48.040]  we've got especially our Facebook mentions nobody's doing this put them on

[02:59:51.920 --> 02:59:57.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:59:57.240 --> 03:00:06.400]  From the front lines of the information war
[03:00:06.400 --> 03:00:18.440]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones. Yeah! It's time to fight! It's time to wake up!
[03:00:18.440 --> 03:00:25.680]  We're the real liberals. We're promoting the light of liberty. We want to go to the
[03:00:25.680 --> 03:00:29.720]  next level. We love God. We love prosperity. We love honor. We love

[03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:45.200]  I'll just expropriate the enemy systems. Take it!
[03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:49.680]  Like a club out of their hand. Club them right in the head with their own system.
[03:00:49.680 --> 03:00:54.560]  It's time to show them the real world. Time to take the veil off.
[03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:59.560]  Time for people to have the real enlightenment, not the false enlightenment of the Illuminati.
[03:00:59.560 --> 03:01:05.240]  All right, Mark Dice is our guest from markdice.com. I want to have him back up, like I said, for a full
[03:01:05.240 --> 03:01:08.760]  hour. Just talking about the book itself. But you heard and this guy is busting his butt.
[03:01:08.760 --> 03:01:12.080]  It's a great book. You may already think you know all this. I read the book and
[03:01:12.080 --> 03:01:15.600]  learned a lot in it. It's amazing but so much of it like gave me chills because I
[03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:18.880]  remember little things I picked up being in Hollywood and other places that
[03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:23.800]  absolutely confirmed this. It's so well researched. infowarslifes.com needs to
[03:01:23.800 --> 03:01:27.520]  carry it but it's at markdice.com right now in Amazon and places like that. We
[03:01:27.520 --> 03:01:30.320]  really should be carrying all of Mark's books. I know we have carried some of them
[03:01:30.320 --> 03:01:34.120]  but I want to go to your calls and I appreciate everybody that's been
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:37.600]  patiently holding like Robert in Tennessee and Eric in Mississippi and
[03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:40.480]  Craig in New Mexico and Mary and others. We're going to take a few of your calls
[03:01:40.480 --> 03:01:44.520]  now. Come back with Anthony Gucciardi for another 12 minutes with Dice and get
[03:01:44.520 --> 03:01:48.000]  into more of your calls and news and David Knight's coming in with Gucciardi
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:51.840]  to cover a bunch of other breaking news. Let's just go to the calls at the start
[03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:54.240]  of the next segment because I don't want to cut people short. Let me ask you this
[03:01:54.240 --> 03:01:59.040]  mark on other contemporary items just in 60 seconds each. What's your view on
[03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:04.080]  Trump? I think that he has the best interest in this for this country in
[03:02:04.080 --> 03:02:07.520]  mind. I don't think that he can be controlled. I think that he's the top
[03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:12.280]  threat to the establishment. I think that the Republican establishment are
[03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:16.360]  using or not the Republican establishment the the Illuminati establishment
[03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:22.480]  is using Ted Cruz to fraction the party in attempts to try to get Hillary in and
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:26.920]  if she wins the social justice warriors and the establishment
[03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:31.120]  will come down and any opposition with an iron fist your career will be in
[03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:34.720]  jeopardy your social media accounts will be in jeopardy your freedom will be in
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:38.680]  jeopardy. These are terrorists foaming at the mouth bullies. I've never seen such
[03:02:38.680 --> 03:02:46.080]  demonic weird stupid or slugs. They are vicious they are godless and if Hillary
[03:02:46.080 --> 03:02:51.480]  wins we are all in jeopardy. Have you seen the poor little these are poor
[03:02:51.480 --> 03:02:54.840]  dumb-down TV head creatures but I shouldn't even be mean to but they're
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:58.720]  so dangerous I have to stand against them. Have you seen the new face of social
[03:02:58.720 --> 03:03:04.080]  justice warriors? Paul watched it in a video of it. I forget its name. I think
[03:03:04.080 --> 03:03:10.960]  it's like Piggy Wiggy or something. Trigly Puff. What is it? Trigly Puff. That's
[03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:16.160]  right and I mean literally it's like a crazy angry feminist that is like a
[03:03:16.160 --> 03:03:21.360]  cartoon character of ridiculousness. This is the symptom of the broken families
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:26.840]  of the internet age of kids with the internet when they're 10 years old
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:32.280]  looking at content that not even really adults should be poisoning their
[03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:38.360]  minds. But it looks like a toddler throwing a fit. You know I think 30
[03:03:38.360 --> 03:03:42.800]  years old now is the new 18 year old unless you know obviously there's
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:45.840]  there's gonna be a small segment of society who are educated but these
[03:03:45.840 --> 03:03:49.920]  social justice warrior college kids have the mentality of 10 year olds. They
[03:03:49.920 --> 03:03:53.720]  think it's good to stay kids I mean I'm not bragging but I was 14 dating
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:58.040]  college chicks. I mean I just and that's a little more advanced than most people
[03:03:58.040 --> 03:04:02.200]  but I mean I really was. I don't I don't understand why these people are like
[03:04:02.200 --> 03:04:07.080]  30 and go I'm not I'm still a child I like not having responsibility. I mean
[03:04:07.080 --> 03:04:10.840]  they're they're happy. They've never done anything dangerous. I just can't
[03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:14.240]  believe it. Well that's why they want the government to be their daddy. They
[03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:17.040]  want the government to take care of them to give them things just like their
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:21.200]  parents did when they were children. The parents provide everything for the
[03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:24.360]  child and so they want the government to provide and they don't have the
[03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:28.200]  mental capacity to understand what it is to work hard and to be dedicated and
[03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:32.080]  to study and to have the mental capacity to see a college chick and say she looks
[03:04:32.080 --> 03:04:37.520]  a lot better than high school girls. The masses the Millennials are almost
[03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:41.840]  fully destroyed so thankfully there's a small fraction of them that are around
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:45.640]  but that's why it's good we reach these people through Twitter through Facebook
[03:04:45.640 --> 03:04:50.760]  through YouTube to try to expose the system before it's too late because it's
[03:04:50.760 --> 03:04:53.760]  getting right beyond what of no return. That's right Mark I stay there my friend
[03:04:53.760 --> 03:04:57.000]  we're gonna come back with phone calls straight ahead Mary Robert others stay
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:05:05.180]  with us. Donald Trump says a nation without borders is not a nation and we
[03:05:05.180 --> 03:05:09.680]  need to build a wall across the southern border liberals and much of the
[03:05:09.680 --> 03:05:14.960]  mainstream media believe that Trump's wall to stop illegal immigration stems
[03:05:14.960 --> 03:05:19.840]  from racism but wait a minute what about Hillary Clinton how come nobody's
[03:05:19.840 --> 03:05:25.520]  calling her a racist after all it was Hillary who voted for a 700 mile
[03:05:25.520 --> 03:05:31.840]  anti-immigration wall in 2006. I voted for border security and some of it was a
[03:05:31.840 --> 03:05:35.200]  fence I don't think we ever called it a wall maybe in some places it was a wall
[03:05:35.200 --> 03:05:39.200]  and don't forget it was only a couple of years ago when Hillary sounded just
[03:05:39.200 --> 03:05:48.840]  like Donald Trump but now in 2016 it is politically incorrect to secure our
[03:05:48.840 --> 03:05:53.720]  borders and that's why Hillary Clinton was for building a wall a few years ago
[03:05:53.720 --> 03:05:58.240]  but now she is against it and you can check out more reports right now at

[03:08:43.440 --> 03:08:47.120]  I want to be clear I'm only doing what I have to do I don't claim to have all
[03:08:47.120 --> 03:08:50.800]  the answers sometimes I know I'm unlistable and I'm obnoxious and I'm
[03:08:50.800 --> 03:08:56.320]  angry but don't ever take it for arrogance or hubris it's commitment and
[03:08:56.320 --> 03:09:03.920]  doing the best I can all I'm asking you to do out there is to take action

[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:29.600]  there undoing flooding Europe with five million jihadis flooding us just can't
[03:09:29.600 --> 03:09:34.160]  use the word mother or father it's meant to be outrageous they're not wackos
[03:09:34.160 --> 03:09:40.160]  they're not stupid at the top they are breaking our will when they come out and
[03:09:40.160 --> 03:09:43.800]  say there's no CIA involved the media Alex Jones is a liar when it's all over
[03:09:43.800 --> 03:09:48.440]  Congress it's all admitted it's part of the deception to where if you're even
[03:09:48.440 --> 03:09:52.360]  awake it's meant to make you feel like no one knows no one's gonna listen to you
[03:09:52.360 --> 03:09:58.640]  no one's coming to help you well you know what that's bull you have a six
[03:09:58.640 --> 03:10:03.360]  percent approval rating you have six percent trusting you you're done you're
[03:10:03.360 --> 03:10:08.360]  over you're dishonorable nobody wants to freely associate with you that's why
[03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:13.240]  you want to have a global dictatorship of ideas cuz you can't compete with free
[03:10:13.240 --> 03:10:18.800]  will the devil sells this idea that oh he's gonna give you free will it let you
[03:10:18.800 --> 03:10:23.440]  to do all the fun stuff God gives us everything good and a man and woman can
[03:10:23.440 --> 03:10:26.520]  make the whole future together and humans could build whatever we envision
[03:10:26.520 --> 03:10:32.200]  and we're made in the image of God God gives you everything and then gives you
[03:10:32.200 --> 03:10:35.840]  free will like the prodigal son and says go out and do whatever you want but
[03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:40.320]  here's some rules that if you violate them as consequences and it's not even
[03:10:40.320 --> 03:10:45.720]  from God it's the way nature and common sense works it's all everything God does
[03:10:45.720 --> 03:10:50.480]  is pure justice I don't mean these churches that are run by devil worshippers
[03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:54.240]  and globalist operatives almost every one of them on record little intelligence
[03:10:54.240 --> 03:10:57.800]  operations you know breaking up families ripping off stuff getting money
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:11:01.200]  getting old people to sign over their houses I mean they're they're evil I'm
[03:11:01.200 --> 03:11:03.840]  gonna do some reports of some of these big churches in Austin they know I'm
[03:11:03.840 --> 03:11:09.200]  coming for them and that's what all this is about is standing up to these slugs
[03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:13.600]  and realizing the real God of the universe is always there even if these
[03:11:13.600 --> 03:11:17.320]  guys masquerade we're going to calls and a good shiardi but other points you want
[03:11:17.320 --> 03:11:22.000]  to add to that mark dice one more point about social media manipulation for
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:25.160]  those who aren't familiar with Twitter a lot of people just aren't interested in
[03:11:25.160 --> 03:11:28.320]  don't use it but it's one of the most popular social media sites out there
[03:11:28.320 --> 03:11:32.760]  obviously people's tweets are quoted on the mainstream media every day on the
[03:11:32.760 --> 03:11:39.080]  news and so they have a top trend list the top 10 list of the topics that are
[03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:44.000]  being tweeted about or being you know chatted about online and so it used to
[03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:49.160]  be that those top trend results you would click on one of the top key words
[03:11:49.160 --> 03:11:53.920]  and it would take you to show you what the top tweets were what were favorited
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:12:00.680]  and retweeted regarding those topics and so we see Twitter manipulating the not
[03:12:00.680 --> 03:12:07.040]  only the top 10 hashtags the top 10 results trending results but the the
[03:12:07.040 --> 03:12:12.260]  topic itself but the tweets connected to it so for example recently when
[03:12:12.260 --> 03:12:16.400]  Chicago's Donald Trump rally was shut down by the Black Lives Matter thugs at
[03:12:16.400 --> 03:12:20.320]  first it was one of the top trends on Twitter you click on the keyword it takes
[03:12:20.320 --> 03:12:26.120]  you to the top tweets and news stories about that the photos then it showed at
[03:12:26.120 --> 03:12:29.240]  first it showed the police were being attacked it showed police being hit in
[03:12:29.240 --> 03:12:34.280]  the head of the bottles and the massive thug crowds that had shut the rally
[03:12:34.280 --> 03:12:39.800]  down then once Twitter insiders got word of what was going on and noticed that it
[03:12:39.800 --> 03:12:43.560]  was getting the word out about how vicious the liberals were they
[03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:48.520]  manipulated the top search results so my point is that since so many people
[03:12:48.520 --> 03:12:53.760]  rely on social media and on Twitter to get their news now it's not an accurate
[03:12:53.760 --> 03:12:58.160]  portrayal of what people are talking about because they easily and this is
[03:12:58.160 --> 03:13:02.960]  quite verifiable all day videos on my YouTube channel where they they quickly
[03:13:02.960 --> 03:13:06.920]  in this case with the Donald Trump Chicago rally they quickly remove the
[03:13:06.920 --> 03:13:11.320]  top results showing the vicious thugs who attacked police they were bleeding
[03:13:11.320 --> 03:13:15.040]  in the head after getting hit with bottles and bricks and they changed the
[03:13:15.040 --> 03:13:22.040]  top search results to showing links to MSNBC articles saying that Donald Trump
[03:13:22.040 --> 03:13:26.720]  is inciting violence they changed the top results remember I remember you'd go
[03:13:26.720 --> 03:13:31.200]  online and find the truth and then you turn on and ago Donald Trump supporters
[03:13:31.200 --> 03:13:36.160]  attacked innocent people again folks so people say well I won't use Twitter no
[03:13:36.160 --> 03:13:39.920]  you've got to then get the links yourself that are the truth hammer those
[03:13:39.920 --> 03:13:45.240]  out and I see over and over again humid human action overthrowing the machines
[03:13:45.240 --> 03:13:49.640]  because they may fake what's on the front page but behind that when you take
[03:13:49.640 --> 03:13:53.920]  mass action that'll only spin that aggregate in the real aggregate will
[03:13:53.920 --> 03:13:59.000]  end up reaching more people and then that makes their spin obsolete but only
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:03.160]  if you accept and don't know their spin is it successful as I said earlier
[03:14:03.160 --> 03:14:07.280]  about human intelligence against the robots and humans using good tech
[03:14:07.280 --> 03:14:12.640]  against the infected artificial systems we will prevail let's go to a phone
[03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:16.120]  call here Robert in Tennessee you're on the air with Mark Dice Alex Jones and
[03:14:16.120 --> 03:14:18.560]  Anthony you already come on in here anytime you want
[03:14:18.560 --> 03:14:26.840]  hello mr. Jones yes glad of course coincidental that you and mr. Dice at
[03:14:26.840 --> 03:14:32.840]  the top of your program mentioned the plight of the Appalachian children yes
[03:14:32.840 --> 03:14:41.120]  and I myself a refugee from Tennessee so I'm living proof that as well the
[03:14:41.120 --> 03:14:47.920]  ability for abstract folks but seriously there's a while I wasn't putting down
[03:14:47.920 --> 03:14:51.560]  people in Appalachians I'm saying like you would show poor starving children
[03:14:51.560 --> 03:14:54.360]  the Appalachians to get help to them you're not showing it to put the
[03:14:54.360 --> 03:14:58.360]  children down you're showing it to show how far we've fallen in some cases just
[03:14:58.360 --> 03:15:02.600]  like when we show these victims of the modern television sickness a global
[03:15:02.600 --> 03:15:07.120]  sickness a trendy sickness I don't know what you call it we show them they're
[03:15:07.120 --> 03:15:11.640]  just blithering demons that want to kill everyone
[03:15:11.640 --> 03:15:24.640]  there's a number of a family that has had a male serve fight bleed or die in every
[03:15:24.640 --> 03:15:31.160]  war this country has ever been in since 1640 that's that's the legacy before the
[03:15:31.160 --> 03:15:35.320]  country sure that'd be the colonies I mean the James down colony so so just to
[03:15:35.320 --> 03:15:39.720]  be clear what are you getting to here on the women the military well so I've
[03:15:39.720 --> 03:15:47.760]  had opportunity to listen to you and you're an eloquent animated and profoundly
[03:15:47.760 --> 03:15:53.640]  compelling spokesman for your causes you know there's no doubt about that so
[03:15:53.640 --> 03:15:58.600]  well I'm fighting Mark Dyson I know we're fighting a fallen entity on this
[03:15:58.600 --> 03:16:01.280]  planet that wants to kill everybody so the Bible's right it's basically a
[03:16:01.280 --> 03:16:05.600]  interdimensional alien force we're fighting I believe it's what it is and
[03:16:05.600 --> 03:16:08.880]  I'm just here trying to folks this is not a game so we can sit here all day and
[03:16:08.880 --> 03:16:12.120]  you know talk about it but that's what we're facing and I love the fact major
[03:16:12.120 --> 03:16:15.840]  media makes funny when I say that that's what it is okay the more you study
[03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:19.800]  this this is not humans running this I'll tell you right now but but Robert so
[03:16:19.800 --> 03:16:24.720]  what do you think about women in the military well that that's my point it
[03:16:24.720 --> 03:16:33.600]  female combatants from combatants should be allowed but only in all female
[03:16:33.600 --> 03:16:41.280]  companies but and green is for giving me opportunity to explain there's if you
[03:16:41.280 --> 03:16:45.440]  if you just just crunch the numbers there's no no but that's done that's
[03:16:45.440 --> 03:16:48.040]  been done historically the few times it's done it's more successful I got a
[03:16:48.040 --> 03:16:52.200]  jump but thank you for holding to say that look God bless you I want to try to
[03:16:52.200 --> 03:16:54.840]  go to the calls I want Mark to finish up I want to bring Anthony Gutiarty in
[03:16:54.840 --> 03:16:59.640]  here I've studied every cosmology out there I've studied every religion I've
[03:16:59.640 --> 03:17:04.040]  studied history I've voraciously studied and the elites believe they're
[03:17:04.040 --> 03:17:06.960]  communicating with other dimensional entities that give them advanced
[03:17:06.960 --> 03:17:10.600]  technology and knowledge to overthrow humanity that they've actually made a
[03:17:10.600 --> 03:17:14.920]  deal to become supermen as soon as they kill everybody the entities are gonna
[03:17:14.920 --> 03:17:18.760]  let them merge with machines and be gods like them sounds like a con game to me
[03:17:18.760 --> 03:17:23.120]  but okay whatever first they just got a poison and kill everybody and then they
[03:17:23.120 --> 03:17:26.420]  get world dominion okay sure sounds like a good deal with when you're
[03:17:26.420 --> 03:17:31.560]  seancing at the skull and bones I mean this is real folks so whether it's real
[03:17:31.560 --> 03:17:35.060]  or not they're manifesting and then I say the Bible everything else fallen one
[03:17:35.060 --> 03:17:39.760]  with an army here to overthrow God's creation take over and then that's all
[03:17:39.760 --> 03:17:44.320]  I see the elite doing with satanic rituals all over television even if
[03:17:44.320 --> 03:17:48.480]  these devils aren't real humans have taken this cosmology or at some race
[03:17:48.480 --> 03:17:53.080]  consciousness memory from another world another time whatever it is and we're
[03:17:53.080 --> 03:17:59.880]  recreating it all I know is any way you slice us it's going down mark dice yes
[03:17:59.880 --> 03:18:03.840]  and you know Jesus said that if you love your neighbor as yourself you know
[03:18:03.840 --> 03:18:06.360]  love God with all your heart and love your neighbor as yourself and so it's
[03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:10.840]  obvious that these people are willfully violating those rules and you write this
[03:18:10.840 --> 03:18:14.840]  is a spiritual war and with transhumanism it's going to merge into a
[03:18:14.840 --> 03:18:19.160]  scientific war as well and it goes back to the story of the Garden of Eden and a
[03:18:19.160 --> 03:18:23.400]  lot of people write it off and laugh and say it's just an old story but it
[03:18:23.400 --> 03:18:28.680]  conveys eternal truths about the serpent and the fall of man and offering man to
[03:18:28.680 --> 03:18:32.760]  become gods the knowledge of the Bible the knowledge of good and evil we already
[03:18:32.760 --> 03:18:37.000]  had the knowledge of good now we were about to be taught the evil go ahead and
[03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:40.760]  in the Bible there's a parable or a story about how the devil took Jesus up
[03:18:40.760 --> 03:18:43.840]  onto a mountain and offered him all the kingdoms of the world if you would bow
[03:18:43.840 --> 03:18:49.040]  down and worship him and then the story is Jesus said no obviously and so it's
[03:18:49.040 --> 03:18:53.200]  quite obvious that there are people who accept that offer and so now with
[03:18:53.200 --> 03:18:56.960]  transhumanism he said get behind me Satan but go ahead yeah it with
[03:18:56.960 --> 03:19:02.120]  transhumanism the transhumanists are saying that the serpent or the devil in
[03:19:02.120 --> 03:19:06.360]  the Garden of Eden that they believe was a real story is true and that they will
[03:19:06.360 --> 03:19:11.600]  become the gods that Satan proved offered mankind to be but they have to
[03:19:11.600 --> 03:19:16.920]  destroy God's creation and overthrow the kingdom of heaven and look all they do
[03:19:16.920 --> 03:19:20.280]  is destroy creation while claiming they're the guardians of it and they
[03:19:20.280 --> 03:19:24.240]  want a world government to protect it by reducing carbon one of the key life
[03:19:24.240 --> 03:19:29.880]  force elements that we must have to survive while they systematically
[03:19:29.880 --> 03:19:34.760]  destroy the planet as fast as they can it's it's quite obvious you shall know
[03:19:34.760 --> 03:19:39.200]  them by their fruits Jesus said and their fruit is as rotten as anything you
[03:19:39.200 --> 03:19:43.880]  can find and it's it's quite clear once you become aware of this and so you know
[03:19:43.880 --> 03:19:48.480]  through through social media now they are manipulating the search results and
[03:19:48.480 --> 03:19:52.280]  so for people who don't know how the system works the younger generations if
[03:19:52.280 --> 03:19:56.560]  they just simply click on a top trend on Twitter and they see the supposed top
[03:19:56.560 --> 03:20:00.080]  results that's a great point those of us that came up and saw the evolution of
[03:20:00.080 --> 03:20:03.520]  the internet we all know tricks like we try to go to the New York Times and it
[03:20:03.520 --> 03:20:06.120]  wants subscription because it's a drudge link you know they're trying to block
[03:20:06.120 --> 03:20:09.840]  drudge and his people and make you subscribe we just go put the thing in a
[03:20:09.840 --> 03:20:12.760]  search engine Google lets you have it or you go to the New York Times lets you
[03:20:12.760 --> 03:20:15.840]  have it that I'm not saying that's that big a trick but that's a trick they
[03:20:15.840 --> 03:20:20.480]  don't know the tricks we've got to teach everybody the tricks yeah and that's
[03:20:20.480 --> 03:20:24.280]  what you know wisdom of the elders and so I've been doing this for 10 years and
[03:20:24.280 --> 03:20:28.240]  so I'm you see patterns the older you get and so you can talk to 80 90 year
[03:20:28.240 --> 03:20:32.440]  olds talk to your grandparents your great-grandparents your parents and
[03:20:32.440 --> 03:20:36.320]  people the older they get they start to see patterns and so it's the same old
[03:20:36.320 --> 03:20:42.000]  story going on and it's approaching a time where the culture has gotten so
[03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:46.320]  rotten that they are now willfully calling for the extermination of
[03:20:46.320 --> 03:20:50.720]  Christians and conservatives and through Twitter and Facebook they have their
[03:20:50.720 --> 03:20:56.520]  selective in YouTube their selective terms of service where it lets them has
[03:20:56.520 --> 03:21:01.360]  thousands of say killed Donald Trump website killed Donald Trump Twitter and
[03:21:01.360 --> 03:21:05.400]  they won't take it down even Billy Corgan says take it down no and same with
[03:21:05.400 --> 03:21:10.520]  YouTube we have now rap videos calling and in video blogs calling for the
[03:21:10.520 --> 03:21:15.280]  assassination the murder of Donald Trump and so Twitter won't delete those
[03:21:15.280 --> 03:21:20.480]  accounts won't won't block them or suspend them but if you criticize
[03:21:20.480 --> 03:21:27.560]  feminists or LGBT people or other minorities and you use certain harsh
[03:21:27.560 --> 03:21:31.920]  language if you just a certain words that they don't want you to use then
[03:21:31.920 --> 03:21:35.200]  your accounts are often suspended and blocked and so it's obvious this
[03:21:35.200 --> 03:21:39.160]  selective enforcement we have a famous not famous but a well-known rapper in the
[03:21:39.160 --> 03:21:44.120]  rap community Azulia Banks a female rapper who has called for the gang rape of
[03:21:44.120 --> 03:21:48.520]  Sarah Palin on Twitter and her Twitter account doesn't get deleted doesn't get
[03:21:48.520 --> 03:21:51.960]  blocked she doesn't get suspended she doesn't have a little blue verification
[03:21:51.960 --> 03:21:56.200]  check mark removed like the here's a great example we showed the famous video
[03:21:56.200 --> 03:21:59.920]  of weeks after everybody else has showed it on purpose as we get censored on
[03:21:59.920 --> 03:22:03.520]  YouTube of collateral damage from the WikiLeaks the helicopter shooting up the
[03:22:03.520 --> 03:22:08.240]  van full kids okay and I pointed out this is part of war it's sad it happened
[03:22:08.240 --> 03:22:11.360]  that's why we shouldn't be there to begin with you don't blend the the pilots
[03:22:11.360 --> 03:22:14.800]  of the helicopter they didn't know the media was blaming them you blame the
[03:22:14.800 --> 03:22:17.880]  illegal war you don't blame the troops once they're there you know unless
[03:22:17.880 --> 03:22:21.680]  they're doing open war crimes they didn't know the video was actually
[03:22:21.680 --> 03:22:26.120]  defending the troops but against the war so because it was a sophisticated
[03:22:26.120 --> 03:22:30.480]  argument that brought everybody together it wasn't a Balkanizer they took our
[03:22:30.480 --> 03:22:34.080]  channel down now we threatened the lawsuit that was a big boycott they gave
[03:22:34.080 --> 03:22:39.840]  it back to us but hundreds of sites could have that ABC CBS NBC but not info
[03:22:39.840 --> 03:22:44.000]  wars that shows the selective enforcement it is and we have the
[03:22:44.000 --> 03:22:48.160]  conservative tech editor over at Breitbart who had his blue verification
[03:22:48.160 --> 03:22:53.040]  check mark removed and I didn't suspend his account but they just took his
[03:22:53.040 --> 03:22:56.600]  little verification check mark off which indicates for those who don't use
[03:22:56.600 --> 03:23:00.560]  social media that that is actually the person because there's a lot of fake
[03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:04.480]  that happens they can also get rid of you when someone else claims that
[03:23:04.480 --> 03:23:08.040]  they're you so that was the first step towards taking them down and when
[03:23:08.040 --> 03:23:12.400]  someone has a verification check on their accounts they it shows a little bit of
[03:23:12.400 --> 03:23:15.760]  credibility it says hey this person's an important individual now there are
[03:23:15.760 --> 03:23:21.680]  small no-name rap stars who have their talent agencies by their verification
[03:23:21.680 --> 03:23:26.080]  and so nobody knows who these people are outside of their own circle of friends
[03:23:26.080 --> 03:23:30.040]  they have no followers but they're verified on Twitter now I had a major
[03:23:30.040 --> 03:23:35.200]  talent agency submit a verification for me on Twitter and they still refuse to
[03:23:35.200 --> 03:23:39.520]  do so obviously because they don't want me to have that aura of credibility
[03:23:39.520 --> 03:23:44.120]  because once you get a verified account it gives you this or
[03:23:44.120 --> 03:23:47.360]  this have reached 500 million people are more
[03:23:47.360 --> 03:23:51.240]  conservatively your books tens of millions you've got multiple TV shows on
[03:23:51.240 --> 03:23:55.120]  cable that you're host of and and yes you don't get the time of day listen the
[03:23:55.120 --> 03:23:58.720]  Republicans are already trying to push us off because I know you can get it
[03:23:58.720 --> 03:24:01.920]  earlier like giving us even entrance into the deal now I'm gonna get it through
[03:24:01.920 --> 03:24:06.120]  backdoor channels but I mean this is the crap we deal with where oh I'm sorry
[03:24:06.120 --> 03:24:10.200]  you're not real media you can't come to the Bob Bullock Museum and show the
[03:24:10.200 --> 03:24:15.400]  Mecheloraza displays we have that say kill white people we're not we're not
[03:24:15.400 --> 03:24:19.920]  allowed to go see that Mark Dice meanwhile Buzzfeed is given a table at
[03:24:19.920 --> 03:24:24.600]  the White House Correspondence dinner it's absolutely incredible and so you
[03:24:24.600 --> 03:24:28.680]  know social media it emerges perhaps organically as a great way for people
[03:24:28.680 --> 03:24:32.600]  to communicate whether that gets co-opted largely at the Sun Valley
[03:24:32.600 --> 03:24:37.560]  Conference something called you know like the free zone or real social media
[03:24:37.560 --> 03:24:41.160]  where there's just basic rules on profanity or violence but other than that
[03:24:41.160 --> 03:24:45.640]  it's total free-for-all that I mean imagine how big and popular that would
[03:24:45.640 --> 03:24:50.640]  be you know if you search the top trends on Facebook or on Twitter it also gives
[03:24:50.640 --> 03:24:55.280]  an insight into the mind of the public which is just mush because the top
[03:24:55.280 --> 03:25:01.080]  trends are almost always celebrity news meaningless and mindless celebrity
[03:25:01.080 --> 03:25:05.120]  gossip and this is what people are paying attention to and part of them
[03:25:05.120 --> 03:25:09.520]  have just checked out of the system reality has gotten too complicated too
[03:25:09.520 --> 03:25:12.840]  depressing they're trying to figure out how the election works and the delegates
[03:25:12.840 --> 03:25:15.520]  and the fraud and the inflation they just throw their hands up and give up
[03:25:15.520 --> 03:25:18.440]  that's the enemy's ultimate goal that's the enemy's ultimate goal and then
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:24.640]  let me throw this at you I have noticed though that even the people
[03:25:24.640 --> 03:25:27.960]  inside these companies don't even like the direction it's going so we need
[03:25:27.960 --> 03:25:31.320]  to understand it's not just one monolithic evil at you if you work at
[03:25:31.320 --> 03:25:34.920]  Google or Facebook there's a lot of good people within the system that I've seen
[03:25:34.920 --> 03:25:40.680]  quietly trying to keep it somewhat free even Bill Maher a staunch liberal who
[03:25:40.680 --> 03:25:46.680]  hates Christians and conservative has admitted that the quote gay mafia will
[03:25:46.680 --> 03:25:51.160]  come to destroy careers and this is symptomatic of the social justice
[03:25:51.160 --> 03:25:55.400]  warriors now when we have more and more people having their careers destroyed
[03:25:55.400 --> 03:26:00.440]  not because they make hateful statements but because they just simply
[03:26:00.440 --> 03:26:04.560]  disagreed that two people of the same sex should be able to call them their
[03:26:04.560 --> 03:26:10.600]  relationship a marriage in the case of the Firefox browser Mozilla CEO and
[03:26:10.600 --> 03:26:15.920]  creator Brandon Ike and we see more and more of these instances of conservatives
[03:26:15.920 --> 03:26:21.480]  being targeted and having the mobs gather on social media that's how Mao started
[03:26:21.480 --> 03:26:24.800]  it's how the Bolshevik started is how the Nazis started its most dangerous form
[03:26:24.800 --> 03:26:28.840]  of authoritarianism the good news is folks they're losing it's overwhelming
[03:26:28.840 --> 03:26:33.000]  they're panicking and a lot of these low-level social justice warriors never
[03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:36.360]  really had a real family they're very sad they think the states their mommy
[03:26:36.360 --> 03:26:41.920]  they're so pathetic you know we make fun of what's what's the what's the the
[03:26:41.920 --> 03:26:45.080]  person's name what's what's the what's the new one that Paul has dubbed the new
[03:26:45.080 --> 03:26:51.400]  leader of the Trigley Puff Pigley Puff Trig Trigley Puff Trigley Puff okay I've
[03:26:51.400 --> 03:26:56.240]  trouble pronouncing that and actually Trigley Puff is a human and I want to
[03:26:56.240 --> 03:27:00.200]  invite Trigley Puff on the show and I want to be sweet to Trigley Puff I want
[03:27:00.200 --> 03:27:05.400]  to offer Trigley Puff a $5,000 scholarship cash to come to Info War
[03:27:05.400 --> 03:27:09.960]  Studios and to come here and we want to meet with you I want to take you to
[03:27:09.960 --> 03:27:14.560]  dinner I want to humanize you I really believe me I don't mean that patronizing
[03:27:14.560 --> 03:27:21.720]  you've been in the matrix I got a red pill believe me believe me I actually you
[03:27:21.720 --> 03:27:25.480]  know I understand it's fun to be cynical and mean back to him and I get why
[03:27:25.480 --> 03:27:28.440]  because they're hateful and act but that's a program and I think we should
[03:27:28.440 --> 03:27:34.440]  actually love Trigley Puff and I'm serious so I'm gonna get Paul on the
[03:27:34.440 --> 03:27:40.840]  Mara I want Paul to fly here from England for one week to spend it with this
[03:27:40.840 --> 03:27:43.800]  lady this young lady I know I'm not supposed to say lady but it's okay
[03:27:43.800 --> 03:27:47.240]  sweetheart you're a lady you're a woman I know they think they've destroyed you
[03:27:47.240 --> 03:27:50.400]  and you think you don't want to be a gender you're just you just want to fade
[03:27:50.400 --> 03:27:54.080]  away and join the state because they've hurt you so bad but I actually think we
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:27:58.440]  should help her and bring Paul here give her $5,000 scholarship first class
[03:27:58.440 --> 03:28:03.960]  flight to Austin Texas and to try to really really work with Pigley Trigley
[03:28:03.960 --> 03:28:08.680]  Puff you're right and that that's very very Christlike to do because these
[03:28:08.680 --> 03:28:13.040]  people many of them the younger folks they're raised in broken families their
[03:28:13.040 --> 03:28:18.200]  parents are too busy working jobs to really give these children the
[03:28:18.200 --> 03:28:22.720]  supervision and the guidance that they need and so we're seeing the families
[03:28:22.720 --> 03:28:27.360]  progressively get worse and worse at the children more and more detached from
[03:28:27.360 --> 03:28:33.160]  reality and so their celebrities are and the government is raising these kids and
[03:28:33.160 --> 03:28:38.240]  we're seeing this disastrous effect and so if if somebody like like Saul of
[03:28:38.240 --> 03:28:42.800]  Tarsus can see the light of Christ and then become one of the greatest
[03:28:42.800 --> 03:28:50.520]  ambassadors for him we can still reach these poor poisoned mind people and we
[03:28:50.520 --> 03:28:54.600]  can show them the truth and we can correct them and we can we can have
[03:28:54.600 --> 03:28:58.600]  them join the side of truth it's not too late but it's getting to that point
[03:28:58.600 --> 03:29:03.560]  well I agree and in her real handle of course is put it back on screen hipster
[03:29:03.560 --> 03:29:09.760]  something believe me sweetheart you're not hip buying into this I mean it's

[03:29:15.680 --> 03:29:19.560]  segments on TV they can't be reached but they they just revel in her name is

[03:30:11.000 --> 03:30:15.120]  from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin credit and circulation
[03:30:15.120 --> 03:30:19.080]  those are the words of John Adams the second president of the United States

[03:30:28.120 --> 03:30:32.640]  create boom and bust cycles and a profit from it what kind of leverage do

[03:31:00.760 --> 03:31:06.200]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would
[03:31:06.200 --> 03:31:10.160]  hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to
[03:31:10.160 --> 03:31:16.000]  organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were
[03:31:16.000 --> 03:31:21.600]  approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid sirens but

[03:38:23.720 --> 03:38:29.080]  in and we're seeing such results in our fight imagine if it grows exponentially
[03:38:29.080 --> 03:38:33.560]  we're only one piece of this resistance and we're devastating the enemy all
[03:38:33.560 --> 03:38:37.000]  glory goes to Jesus Christ you know I'll tell you what you said something
[03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:41.040]  poetic back there you said you talked about the species not just individuals
[03:38:41.040 --> 03:38:45.920]  how far we've come the cataclysms we've overcome the insanity can you imagine
[03:38:45.920 --> 03:38:50.640]  but just in modern history you know our ancestors didn't work in the coal mines
[03:38:50.640 --> 03:38:55.360]  and get coal long with the breaker boys sorting through the coal and break their
[03:38:55.360 --> 03:39:00.000]  backs they didn't fight in world wars and get trench foot which is one of the
[03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:04.200]  most horrible disgusting things you can get and the millions of other diseases
[03:39:04.200 --> 03:39:09.760]  that they contracted and the people that died they didn't do all of that so we
[03:39:09.760 --> 03:39:14.800]  could do nothing they didn't do all of that in a massive build-up for humanity
[03:39:14.800 --> 03:39:19.680]  let them jack our water and and do some social justice warrior deal where we
[03:39:19.680 --> 03:39:27.680]  talk about our wee-wees all day the new order can go to hell but the inverse the new order would just kill themselves you people are the disease
[03:39:27.680 --> 03:39:33.360]  you're the problem you want us to die you die you die I don't even want to kill you
[03:39:33.360 --> 03:39:37.080]  but you know what you want to kill us you know where this is going don't you well
[03:39:37.080 --> 03:39:42.680]  in the world is when someone can hate that essence of humanity that has pushed
[03:39:42.680 --> 03:39:46.200]  us further over and over and over again for who knows how many years for
[03:39:46.200 --> 03:39:50.400]  countless years okay and even just in modern times in the 20th century look
[03:39:50.400 --> 03:39:54.680]  at all the things we've been through from World War two the horrible horrible
[03:39:54.680 --> 03:39:59.360]  things that we've overcome our ancestors have overcome to get to this point a
[03:39:59.360 --> 03:40:06.200]  build-up a colossal massive cosmological build-up to the tipping point and is what
[03:40:06.200 --> 03:40:09.120]  we're going to care about political correctness or we're going to care about
[03:40:09.120 --> 03:40:14.200]  going to the next level you know are we going to care about taking humanity into
[03:40:14.200 --> 03:40:18.840]  total empowerment or are we going to inverse and go back on all of the years
[03:40:18.840 --> 03:40:22.280]  of build-up all of the years of transformation all of the years of
[03:40:22.280 --> 03:40:26.400]  progression and start fighting with each other and hating each other even more
[03:40:26.400 --> 03:40:30.280]  so than ever before in history yes it's happened I know it has I know the horrible
[03:40:30.280 --> 03:40:34.320]  things have happened as I've said but now we have the choice because we have the
[03:40:34.320 --> 03:40:39.040]  comfort we have the luxury I'm sitting here in a climate-controlled studio with
[03:40:39.040 --> 03:40:42.560]  nice computers and nice lights and a nice microphone and I'm talking to you
[03:40:42.560 --> 03:40:46.760]  wherever you are in the entire world you're getting instantaneous transmission
[03:40:46.760 --> 03:40:50.680]  of my voice into your eardrums that are vibrating and sending messages to your
[03:40:50.680 --> 03:40:55.720]  brain transcribing what I'm saying into your memories your discernment your
[03:40:55.720 --> 03:40:59.560]  understanding never before could this happen what are we gonna do with it
[03:40:59.560 --> 03:41:03.680]  though because if you're sitting there you're you're bored and you think life
[03:41:03.680 --> 03:41:07.680]  isn't interesting some of the stuff we're going to talk about today and I you
[03:41:07.680 --> 03:41:11.520]  know David Knight I wanted him to come in here because I talked to him and he had
[03:41:11.520 --> 03:41:15.080]  such insight on some of these things we're gonna talk about genome editing
[03:41:15.080 --> 03:41:19.840]  driverless cars we're gonna talk about new pharmaceutical developments medical
[03:41:19.840 --> 03:41:24.360]  developments they're going in and just splicing up certain genes and and by the
[03:41:24.360 --> 03:41:29.000]  way we're gonna talk about the number one thing the factor that people forget
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:34.480]  human exploitation because all of these things can be amazing driverless cars
[03:41:34.480 --> 03:41:39.160]  could be an amazing thing gene editing could be an amazing thing but the
[03:41:39.160 --> 03:41:42.840]  difference is no one considers the human exploitation when they fail to
[03:41:42.840 --> 03:41:49.520]  consider that very very bad things happen so what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna
[03:41:49.520 --> 03:41:54.600]  leave you with that note for a second I'm gonna play a video for you and I'm
[03:41:54.600 --> 03:41:59.120]  gonna play this video that Chikari did because when I looked at the video list
[03:41:59.120 --> 03:42:04.200]  it just jumped out at me I want you to consider how far we've come as a species
[03:42:04.200 --> 03:42:08.560]  and I want you to consider the aim of empowerment and going to the next level
[03:42:08.560 --> 03:42:16.800]  and taking back everything that is ours as a species such as the control of our
[03:42:16.800 --> 03:42:20.760]  system even if it's political or whatever you may have I want you to
[03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:26.720]  consider though on the flip side this Germany is now installing traffic
[03:42:26.720 --> 03:42:31.320]  devices on the ground so textures don't even have to look up from their phones
[03:42:31.320 --> 03:42:34.720]  when they're walking because people are getting hit by cars and killed because
[03:42:34.720 --> 03:42:37.760]  they can't stop texting when they're walking around no one's even looking in
[03:42:37.760 --> 03:42:42.160]  front of them if we can't even look in front of ourselves physically how are
[03:42:42.160 --> 03:42:47.480]  we going to intellectually being have our peripheral vision up to par it's
[03:42:47.480 --> 03:42:50.240]  just totally insane let's go to this report are Americans smart enough to
[03:42:50.240 --> 03:42:54.320]  cross the street apparently some of these Germans they think are not we've
[03:42:54.320 --> 03:42:58.000]  all heard of driving while distracted but what about walking while distracted
[03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:01.800]  well one town in Germany takes this so seriously that they're actually putting
[03:43:01.800 --> 03:43:05.560]  traffic control devices on the ground so we're here at the University of Texas to
[03:43:05.560 --> 03:43:10.720]  see if this is a worthy initiative hey how you doing today miss we're talking
[03:43:10.720 --> 03:43:15.160]  to people about texting and walking so you are a prime candidate okay so
[03:43:15.160 --> 03:43:17.760]  there's a town in Germany that's actually experimenting with putting
[03:43:17.760 --> 03:43:21.200]  traffic control devices on the ground so you wouldn't have to look up from your
[03:43:21.200 --> 03:43:24.720]  phone do you think something like that would be a good investment for the city
[03:43:24.720 --> 03:43:28.160]  of Austin like it would be green red and yellow on the floor like things to
[03:43:28.160 --> 03:43:31.360]  like help you go let's say if you're walking up to a stop sign or
[03:43:31.360 --> 03:43:36.160]  intersection and you get to the to the edge and it says a big red a big red
[03:43:36.160 --> 03:43:40.320]  dot to tell you to stop I don't know if the money how much that would take versus
[03:43:40.320 --> 03:43:43.840]  just like looking up from your phone is it gonna cost a lot to like put things
[03:43:43.840 --> 03:43:46.680]  like that on the floor and like make that happen everywhere and I think it's
[03:43:46.680 --> 03:43:50.920]  better to like really see the nature and like not text while I mean we should not
[03:43:50.920 --> 03:43:53.680]  text while walking or driving just because there's so much better to things
[03:43:53.680 --> 03:43:58.720]  to see so honestly I also walk while I text it can be ready by Alice when I'm
[03:43:58.720 --> 03:44:04.040]  walking I always look at the stoplight see is this a kind of walk it can be a
[03:44:04.040 --> 03:44:06.160]  good idea I don't know if it's worth the money they might be investing I don't
[03:44:06.160 --> 03:44:09.000]  know how much it costs for them that's a real question I think let's say you walk
[03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:12.200]  up to a stop sign instead of looking up from your phone to see there's a stop
[03:44:12.200 --> 03:44:15.440]  sign there's like a big red dot on the ground it basically like a stop sign on
[03:44:15.440 --> 03:44:20.080]  the ground so yeah that's that works that works really well I guess you think
[03:44:20.080 --> 03:44:23.600]  yeah it honestly might be maybe not just for the city but definitely for the
[03:44:23.600 --> 03:44:26.320]  campus because we're all college kids are all walking around staring at our phones
[03:44:26.320 --> 03:44:31.720]  but I yeah I really can't tell you how many times I'm walking and I trip over
[03:44:31.720 --> 03:44:34.240]  my own feet or I almost walk into someone because I'm guilty of it too
[03:44:34.240 --> 03:44:38.640]  mostly at times like at least on campus wise like you're running to things that
[03:44:38.640 --> 03:44:44.200]  you know like things that aren't and like a traffic intersection so like
[03:44:44.200 --> 03:44:49.040]  maybe it's like a pole or something or like a person so I don't know how
[03:44:49.040 --> 03:44:53.280]  effective that would be unless a very like talking about like you know actually
[03:44:53.280 --> 03:44:57.680]  out by the road so a lot of people are walking here with their phones on their
[03:44:57.680 --> 03:45:03.040]  hand and I don't know I think it just be safer for them especially in that part
[03:45:03.040 --> 03:45:09.200]  where there's a video for that even a student being run off by a boss I don't
[03:45:09.200 --> 03:45:11.920]  know if you saw that like a couple of years ago but he was on a sword fight
[03:45:11.920 --> 03:45:16.760]  not on his on his phone yeah there's they have like a tradition where people
[03:45:16.760 --> 03:45:21.400]  stand on both sides of the street so but still I see every day people walking
[03:45:21.400 --> 03:45:24.760]  around there with their phones on their hands so it might be a good idea what
[03:45:24.760 --> 03:45:28.600]  about like a app like if you're walking on your phone and you get to a stop sign
[03:45:28.600 --> 03:45:33.560]  you're something with Papa slip say stop here at the stop sign I know that
[03:45:33.560 --> 03:45:39.720]  would work as efficiently then like being aware of your surroundings it's not
[03:45:39.720 --> 03:45:43.640]  the same as like texting while driving but I think it'd be useful to start like
[03:45:43.640 --> 03:45:48.960]  a health promotion campaign to a more of a awareness campaign yes that's fair
[03:45:48.960 --> 03:45:52.200]  enough and what about something like an app the similar situation you're
[03:45:52.200 --> 03:45:55.520]  approaching a stop sign and you have you know like a stop sign that appears on
[03:45:55.520 --> 03:45:59.080]  your phone I think that'd be useful I think it's more useful to incentivize
[03:45:59.080 --> 03:46:05.160]  people rather than punish possibly yeah I feel like that could that could be
[03:46:05.160 --> 03:46:13.080]  effective if you know it was you know properly you know designed and implemented
[03:46:13.080 --> 03:46:16.680]  it could be effective if something popped up on your phone and it's like
[03:46:16.680 --> 03:46:20.920]  stop no that's too much that's too much I mean then you have to download the app
[03:46:20.920 --> 03:46:25.640]  and everyone doesn't have an app it just wouldn't work that that's like that
[03:46:25.640 --> 03:46:29.680]  doesn't make sense to me I think that's kind of a lot to put on everyone's phone
[03:46:29.680 --> 03:46:34.320]  and I don't know if that like can you require that of someone it's hypothetical
[03:46:34.320 --> 03:46:39.440]  okay I mean I guess it would work and prevent people from tripping over their
[03:46:39.440 --> 03:46:45.000]  own feet like I do a lot so all right thank you so much so I wanted to play
[03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:49.240]  that video for you and here's the fun thing I'm not even calling these people
[03:46:49.240 --> 03:46:52.800]  stupid I'm actually an idiot myself and I text and do some stupid things myself
[03:46:52.800 --> 03:46:58.920]  too it's the direction that we're all heading with the idea that our ancestors
[03:46:58.920 --> 03:47:02.720]  didn't die in World War two and die of coal black lung in the coal mines so
[03:47:02.720 --> 03:47:07.800]  that we could basically become androids and stare at our phones all day also you
[03:47:07.800 --> 03:47:10.800]  know David Knight's in here and he said something interesting how can we be
[03:47:10.800 --> 03:47:16.800]  trusted to drive if we can't be trusted to walk down the street anymore you know
[03:47:16.800 --> 03:47:20.400]  I want his take on a lot of this because we were talking earlier and I said you
[03:47:20.400 --> 03:47:22.800]  know what you should just come on the show because you have so much so many
[03:47:22.800 --> 03:47:27.840]  good responses on this what I want to talk about is exploitation and human
[03:47:27.840 --> 03:47:31.640]  corruption in regards to all of the old topics we're going to cover so we talk
[03:47:31.640 --> 03:47:36.080]  about how we're destroyed by the lack of understanding details okay so whether
[03:47:36.080 --> 03:47:42.480]  it's genome editing driverless cars you can even say social media it's not
[03:47:42.480 --> 03:47:45.560]  about the concept of these things which could be good which could help humanity
[03:47:45.560 --> 03:47:50.240]  which could enrich humanity everything is based on something that could be good
[03:47:50.240 --> 03:47:55.680]  instead there's an element of human exploitation yeah that no one seems to
[03:47:55.680 --> 03:48:00.160]  understand and that tends to overshadow the good but when people are walking
[03:48:00.160 --> 03:48:02.840]  around and they can't even be trusted to walk down the street they don't
[03:48:02.840 --> 03:48:05.640]  understand this element of human exploitation and that's when we get into
[03:48:05.640 --> 03:48:09.880]  things like this with Europe which is a good thing Europe banning two endocrine
[03:48:09.880 --> 03:48:14.920]  disrupting weed killers these are two super highly popular herbicides that are
[03:48:14.920 --> 03:48:19.680]  known to be causing cancer infertility birth birth defects but lobbyists and
[03:48:19.680 --> 03:48:24.320]  people the element of human exploitation they just push it along they don't care
[03:48:24.320 --> 03:48:28.560]  that's the same thing we saw with EPA and we don't want to get into all of this
[03:48:28.560 --> 03:48:33.560]  and you know stat news said something interesting in a piece I read today that
[03:48:33.560 --> 03:48:37.080]  I find is highly interesting so everyone's talking about CRISPR this
[03:48:37.080 --> 03:48:41.720]  gene editing gadget you know it's so amazing we can edit the genome and
[03:48:41.720 --> 03:48:46.280]  we're gonna make a master race it states for all the hoopla about CRISPR the
[03:48:46.280 --> 03:48:50.400]  revolutionary genome editing technology has a dirty little secret it's a very
[03:48:50.400 --> 03:48:54.600]  messy business scientists basically whack the famed double helix with a
[03:48:54.600 --> 03:48:58.800]  molecular machete often triggering the cells DNA repair machinery to make all
[03:48:58.800 --> 03:49:03.920]  sorts of unwanted changes to the genome beyond what they intended on Wednesday
[03:49:03.920 --> 03:49:07.140]  researchers and veiled in nature a significant improvement in proven a new
[03:49:07.140 --> 03:49:10.000]  CRISPR system that can switch single letters of the genome cleanly and
[03:49:10.000 --> 03:49:14.160]  efficiently in a way they said could reliably repair many disease causing
[03:49:14.160 --> 03:49:17.400]  mutations so here's the thing for me and then I want your take on all of this
[03:49:17.400 --> 03:49:22.920]  stuff gene editing by itself it's like if someone came out and said you know we
[03:49:22.920 --> 03:49:26.000]  don't really know what we're doing instead of we want to democratize your
[03:49:26.000 --> 03:49:29.360]  DNA and own it and patent it and change everything and modify this food supply
[03:49:29.360 --> 03:49:32.040]  and everything we don't know what we're doing but there's hope here let's get
[03:49:32.040 --> 03:49:34.760]  some more funding let's look into the safety of this let's do some actual
[03:49:34.760 --> 03:49:38.400]  controlled trials I would say great that's awesome and has it has potential
[03:49:38.400 --> 03:49:44.040]  okay we can't deny that but instead the human exploitation element they say
[03:49:44.040 --> 03:49:46.960]  wow there's billions of dollars to be made we need to push this through
[03:49:46.960 --> 03:49:50.320]  immediately just like the pharmaceutical drugs they just push through and push
[03:49:50.320 --> 03:49:53.600]  through and some of the fake the clinical trials that's found out 20 30
[03:49:53.600 --> 03:49:59.360]  years later what how do people not get this okay because it overshadows the
[03:49:59.360 --> 03:50:03.440]  good though it overshadows they say you're against drivers cars David Knight
[03:50:03.440 --> 03:50:07.960]  you're a technophobe or you're a anti scientific if you're against this no
[03:50:07.960 --> 03:50:11.680]  we're against the human exploitation that's right and when we look at the way
[03:50:11.680 --> 03:50:15.320]  they exploit people how do they do it they argue from authority and they use
[03:50:15.320 --> 03:50:18.760]  the government to push these things through and we're talking about things
[03:50:18.760 --> 03:50:23.920]  like gene editing and that sort of thing remember that the dark act which is the
[03:50:23.920 --> 03:50:28.720]  the nickname that those of us who were posed to it called it and and of course
[03:50:28.720 --> 03:50:32.040]  that acronym was denying Americans the right to know okay we had that
[03:50:32.040 --> 03:50:36.080]  introduced in Congress why did they put it in Anthony because they were putting
[03:50:36.080 --> 03:50:40.360]  in laws at the local and state level saying we want to know what's in our
[03:50:40.360 --> 03:50:43.400]  food and so they come out and say we're gonna pass an act that's gonna give you
[03:50:43.400 --> 03:50:47.080]  transparency we're gonna shut down the local safety concerns and do it at the
[03:50:47.080 --> 03:50:50.600]  federal level exactly you know what I got caught up because we got us a little
[03:50:50.600 --> 03:50:53.560]  time there's so much more to talk about we'll be right back after this break with
[03:50:53.560 --> 03:50:57.000]  a lot more I'm Anthony good shardy with David Knight this is the fourth hour of

[03:52:04.520 --> 03:52:08.400]  has been called the iodine conspiracy I've told you about how scientists have
[03:52:08.400 --> 03:52:12.400]  known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how
[03:52:12.400 --> 03:52:16.320]  the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding
[03:52:16.320 --> 03:52:20.560]  fluoride the bad member of the halogen family in the water they took the good
[03:52:20.560 --> 03:52:25.520]  halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as
[03:52:25.520 --> 03:52:29.560]  it still is worsening today I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and
[03:52:29.560 --> 03:52:35.000]  your family now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning
[03:52:35.000 --> 03:52:39.440]  the connection between iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying
[03:52:39.440 --> 03:52:43.840]  could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull these
[03:52:43.840 --> 03:52:47.800]  studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine
[03:52:47.800 --> 03:52:52.760]  is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen stock up on survival

[03:54:45.240 --> 03:54:49.440]  to break we're talking about the element of human exploitation yes in things like
[03:54:49.440 --> 03:54:53.040]  genome editing driverless cars food production and you were talking about
[03:54:53.040 --> 03:54:58.560]  the dark act which is the act the piece of legislation that is meant to ban the
[03:54:58.560 --> 03:55:02.000]  possibility of GMO labeling in the United States that's right and we have
[03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:04.800]  already we've talked about that in the past many people think well that was
[03:55:04.800 --> 03:55:09.280]  done and you know it actually failed at the beginning of March and then just
[03:55:09.280 --> 03:55:12.240]  three days later they introduced it again it's the same thing we've seen with
[03:55:12.240 --> 03:55:15.680]  syspa as you pointed out during the break we see this over and over again
[03:55:15.680 --> 03:55:19.440]  with a keystone pipeline they just keep coming with this regulation and now
[03:55:19.440 --> 03:55:22.720]  we're seeing the same type of thing happening with the self-driving cars
[03:55:22.720 --> 03:55:27.040]  because if people become aware of what's going on if they challenge the
[03:55:27.040 --> 03:55:30.320]  experts and say wait a minute what's really going on here are you really
[03:55:30.320 --> 03:55:33.520]  telling us the truth or you just doing something so you can make money and
[03:55:33.520 --> 03:55:37.040]  exploit people you have absolutely no concern about their safety that's what's
[03:55:37.040 --> 03:55:42.080]  behind these efforts to have labeling for GMO and it's also the concerns that
[03:55:42.080 --> 03:55:44.920]  people had in California they've seen these self-driving cars they've seen
[03:55:44.920 --> 03:55:48.000]  them involved in an unusually high percentage of accidents they saw one of
[03:55:48.000 --> 03:55:51.840]  them turn into a bus that's so the California Department of Motor Vehicles
[03:55:51.840 --> 03:55:54.440]  said hey we're going to have some regulations on this we're going to make
[03:55:54.440 --> 03:55:58.960]  sure that we've got humans in here for a backup situation so what do they do
[03:55:58.960 --> 03:56:04.080]  Google goes to Washington to shut it down the same thing Big Agra did with the
[03:56:04.080 --> 03:56:07.560]  GMO labels and I think it's important for people on the left to understand this
[03:56:07.560 --> 03:56:13.560]  because the opposition to the GMO push that we've got from Big Ag is coming
[03:56:13.560 --> 03:56:17.000]  from the left they're the ones who stopped the dark act but for the most
[03:56:17.000 --> 03:56:20.480]  part many people on the left don't really understand the consequences of the
[03:56:20.480 --> 03:56:25.800]  self-driving cars I'm all for better cars just like I'm all for better food
[03:56:25.800 --> 03:56:29.960]  we've had ways to modify food by selective breeding and that sort of thing
[03:56:29.960 --> 03:56:33.840]  but when we start going in and manipulating at the genetic level then
[03:56:33.840 --> 03:56:37.280]  we're doing something very different we're doing transgenetic modification
[03:56:37.280 --> 03:56:41.280]  taking the genes from different completely different plants and animals
[03:56:41.280 --> 03:56:45.760]  sometimes combining plants and animals together and so that creates a whole new
[03:56:45.760 --> 03:56:50.120]  issue there just like self-driving cars is very different from the safety
[03:56:50.120 --> 03:56:53.120]  devices that have been added so as people are starting to look at this we
[03:56:53.120 --> 03:56:58.160]  saw this article that came up this weekend look now no hands and they're
[03:56:58.160 --> 03:57:01.920]  talking about how China could leapfrog us because they're going to be able to
[03:57:01.920 --> 03:57:06.840]  impose regulatory mandates at the central area and it's very much like what
[03:57:06.840 --> 03:57:11.280]  George W. Bush is said boy I wish I was in China I could just dictate what I
[03:57:11.280 --> 03:57:15.320]  want people to do and have them follow my orders and that's what the big
[03:57:15.320 --> 03:57:20.280]  companies are doing so now on the automobile side we've got Google combining
[03:57:20.280 --> 03:57:25.520]  with car companies like Ford and Volvo combining with taxi companies Uber and
[03:57:25.520 --> 03:57:31.320]  Lyft okay coming together and saying we want to get rid of any impediments to
[03:57:31.320 --> 03:57:35.520]  what we're doing at the local and the state level because we're going to give
[03:57:35.520 --> 03:57:39.920]  you something that's safer same thing they do with the food stuff right so we
[03:57:39.920 --> 03:57:45.320]  hey if you're no regulation whatsoever absolutely what's funny is we're saying I
[03:57:45.320 --> 03:57:49.760]  think driverless cars could actually be an amazing thing yeah I think augmenting
[03:57:49.760 --> 03:57:53.000]  some things in the food supply I've advanced my position on that could be
[03:57:53.000 --> 03:57:56.520]  good if they were given the proper oversight and safety regulation but
[03:57:56.520 --> 03:58:00.280]  they're not at all and if we were given a choice okay like they're gonna do it in
[03:58:00.280 --> 03:58:04.600]  China they're gonna make sure that every car has these devices on it on every
[03:58:04.600 --> 03:58:06.920]  road and that's what we're gonna be looking at in America they're already
[03:58:06.920 --> 03:58:10.280]  talking about smart cities here in Austin they're gonna mandate self-driving
[03:58:10.280 --> 03:58:14.000]  buses so have buses that not only are empty of passengers they won't even have
[03:58:14.000 --> 03:58:17.560]  a human driver at them look at what happened in California with a Google
[03:58:17.560 --> 03:58:20.880]  cartoon and the bus it's gonna literally turn into a bus now well it's a win-win
[03:58:20.880 --> 03:58:24.200]  right there well it's interesting just goes to show it's all about the details
[03:58:24.200 --> 03:58:28.400]  and we failed to understand the details we fail overall and very very bad things
