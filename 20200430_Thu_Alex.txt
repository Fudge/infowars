[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  Everything is unfolding exactly as I said it would because I've been studying these
[00:12.600 --> 00:21.840]  people for a long time and I want to let you know folks that they are establishing Maoist
[00:21.840 --> 00:27.600]  style brigades across Europe and the United States that will be the general public in
[00:27.600 --> 00:35.200]  uniforms enforcing forced inoculation they're going to use peer pressure to do it and they're
[00:35.200 --> 00:41.400]  going to use a medical tyranny because they can claim that it's quote unideological this
[00:41.400 --> 00:46.520]  is the exactly what I would do if I was going to be taking over like this and we have all
[00:46.520 --> 00:50.360]  the documents we know that they're the ones that are behind it that's all coming out will
[00:50.360 --> 00:55.880]  explain why but first here's the premiere of this report on Democrat governors calling
[00:55.880 --> 01:05.680]  for brown shirt armies former president bill Clinton recently spoke with governors from
[01:05.680 --> 01:13.120]  new york and california about the need for a national contact tracing core we need tracing
[01:13.120 --> 01:18.760]  agents in the hundreds and hundreds of people right you take the test and then you trace
[01:18.760 --> 01:25.760]  back all the contacts it's never been done on this scale before this is an army of tracers
[01:25.760 --> 01:35.040]  that basically investigators what we will do that the best we can on with these with
[01:35.040 --> 01:40.560]  his seven state consortium but it could have been done from the federal government on a
[01:40.560 --> 01:46.360]  much tighter more efficient basis you know I agree with you on this is contact tracing
[01:46.360 --> 01:55.800]  is very important and it could enable our entire country for the first time to have a real
[01:55.800 --> 02:02.840]  public health system a real public health core and I've thought about it in a lot of
[02:02.840 --> 02:07.520]  different ways could we could we make this a part of americorps and encourage people
[02:07.520 --> 02:15.200]  to come and do this work and earn some credits to go to college for example these are some
[02:15.200 --> 02:24.320]  other way we could do it but I know that my friend you know well paul farmer is heading
[02:24.320 --> 02:30.720]  up a program for massachusetts now to try to get a state contact tracing core do you think
[02:30.720 --> 02:37.320]  maybe you could get the governors to ask the congress to fund that as a part of all this
[02:37.320 --> 02:41.480]  money they're giving you or maybe it's legal now to spend some of the money but we need
[02:41.480 --> 02:49.200]  a national core of healthy people who are properly trying to go out and do this contact
[02:49.200 --> 02:57.520]  tracing we need the bodies state health agencies are already hiring contact tracers nationwide
[02:57.520 --> 03:04.840]  they're hiring inexperienced lay people who lost their jobs during the ccp virus shutdown
[03:04.840 --> 03:10.720]  governor baker invited us to be part of a consortium and to offer some of the insights
[03:10.720 --> 03:18.120]  and experience we've had in other countries in hiring and training a group really a whole
[03:18.120 --> 03:23.320]  cadre of community health workers or contact tracers rather I can't help but say community
[03:23.320 --> 03:30.000]  health workers and they would be virtually trained they are being virtually trained and
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.800]  deployed right now what we would do with this is that we would this virtual group of contact
[03:35.800 --> 03:43.240]  tracers would contact anybody who has tested positive to learn about their recent activities
[03:43.240 --> 03:49.620]  who they may have been in contact with we had something like 7000 people 9000 people
[03:49.620 --> 03:53.800]  apply within the first couple of days to be contact tracers so that we can actually use
[03:53.800 --> 04:01.640]  people who are out of place out of work rather who can be trained even lay people to do this
[04:01.640 --> 04:06.520]  work it felt like a good good thing for the economy also but one of the things that you
[04:06.520 --> 04:15.120]  have to be able to do is to track people who are positive should we have a contract tracer
[04:15.120 --> 04:21.720]  core even if we call it something more elegant should we really build the first public health
[04:21.720 --> 04:27.400]  network we've ever really built in this country around this issue I think the answer is absolutely
[04:27.400 --> 04:33.000]  yes and that's just going to require an army of folks California and New York under the
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.240]  guidance of the Clinton Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are following
[04:38.240 --> 04:45.000]  the globalist script of the World Health Organization now we need to go and look in families to
[04:45.000 --> 04:51.280]  find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified
[04:51.280 --> 05:00.600]  manner for info wars.com this is Greg Rees I'm not going to sit here and waste your time
[05:00.600 --> 05:07.520]  or my time and rattle off the successes info wars is that if you're paying attention you
[05:07.520 --> 05:14.680]  know we've done together but I'll tell you this the technocrats are really up in their
[05:14.680 --> 05:20.640]  game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media they're trying to shudder and
[05:20.640 --> 05:26.040]  silence a human resistance so now is the time to understand that everything we've talked
[05:26.040 --> 05:29.320]  about has been proven accurate everything you warned your friends and family about us
[05:29.320 --> 05:35.800]  around to be true so it's now that your credibility is way up the power structure to silence those
[05:35.800 --> 05:42.760]  of us that they can't but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us we have
[05:42.760 --> 05:49.120]  the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech we have to make
[05:49.120 --> 05:54.400]  sure that we find our right now to make sure that long dark night doesn't come so be the
[05:54.400 --> 06:20.480]  power of yours you are if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[06:20.480 --> 06:31.360]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones we're now inside the new world
[06:31.360 --> 06:39.440]  order we're now inside the killed red cage if you comply if you go along with the slowly
[06:39.440 --> 06:46.560]  tightening boa constrictor that's wrapped around you you will be bankrupted you will
[06:46.560 --> 06:53.320]  be poor you will be sick you will be slowly killed this is not a science fiction nightmare
[06:53.320 --> 07:04.560]  dystopia this is reality when I read none dare call it conspiracy it was written the
[07:04.560 --> 07:14.760]  year I was born 1974 and I went and looked up at the library the articles that it quoted
[07:14.760 --> 07:19.560]  with David Rockefeller praising communism and Mao Zedong and saying that he was going
[07:19.560 --> 07:32.000]  to bring communism to america I was blown away the old days before the internet had
[07:32.000 --> 07:40.760]  any functionality 1991 92 93 I'd have high school friends like shane stoner come over
[07:40.760 --> 07:44.960]  to the house sometimes and he'd say why do you all these news clippings and books and
[07:44.960 --> 07:48.280]  stuff you know let's go have a barbecue and out of the lake get some girls out there which
[07:48.280 --> 07:56.720]  we did I was like listen these are the people that run the country and they they said they're
[07:56.720 --> 08:01.160]  going to overthrow things slowly and destroy the family and do this we've got to fight
[08:01.160 --> 08:10.640]  this so that's the only reason I'm on air today is that I was big into reading history
[08:10.640 --> 08:19.400]  books and I happened to read some the claims of big new brzezinski did all these horrible
[08:19.400 --> 08:27.040]  things the national security advisor under Jimmy Carter and I actually went and I actually
[08:27.040 --> 08:39.200]  looked it up and I found out it was all true because I went and read his books so I was
[08:39.200 --> 08:47.760]  thinking about this this morning I want to look about 4am to go back to sleep I sit there
[08:47.760 --> 08:54.520]  and I talked to generals on the phone and I talked to high powered lawyers on the phone
[08:54.520 --> 09:02.280]  and I talked to the president on the phone and all these people and I'm telling them
[09:02.280 --> 09:13.280]  this stuff and they're like you're kidding and I'm like no the nope bell prize winner
[09:13.280 --> 09:23.320]  for discovering HIV says it's a man made virus I mean did you hear what I just said
[09:23.320 --> 09:29.680]  that one fact can stop all this hysteria the total shutdown the end of our world as we
[09:29.680 --> 09:35.040]  know it you see what's behind me from the movie 1964 Dr. Strangelove Stanley Kubrick's
[09:35.040 --> 09:40.960]  masterpiece I believe more important than 2001 space Odyssey because it was put in the
[09:40.960 --> 09:50.160]  form of a dark comedy because people couldn't handle the super serious topic if it wasn't
[09:50.160 --> 10:00.360]  the greatest film ever made
[10:00.360 --> 10:04.320]  and you see those dots coming in over Russia those are the B-52 bombers that are going
[10:04.320 --> 10:09.040]  to drop hydrogen bombs on it and then the Russians are going to detonate their doomsday
[10:09.040 --> 10:14.480]  bomb which is a metaphor for nuclear war though those weapons do exist the Air Force admits
[10:14.480 --> 10:19.920]  they have any matter weapons destroy the entire solar system yeah that's where we're at
[10:19.920 --> 10:30.000]  and so those lines are coming in to bomb those cities you bomb them they bomb us we die
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.080]  now imagine if one of those Russian cities got nuked and a million people five million
[10:34.080 --> 10:39.680]  people died that that would be a huge war crime it'd be a terrible thing if general
[10:39.680 --> 10:46.120]  Jack T. Ripper had his way and got away with it but this isn't hydrogen bombs that are
[10:46.120 --> 10:51.600]  being dropped this is cutting off the infrastructure for us here in the first world bringing us
[10:51.600 --> 11:04.880]  to third world status and bringing the third world to starvation mass collapse death status
[11:04.880 --> 11:10.920]  so these planes coming in to drop hydrogen bombs are already over the targets and they're
[11:10.920 --> 11:16.080]  already killing hundreds of thousands of people a week are now starving to death according
[11:16.080 --> 11:21.400]  to the UN themselves and by the way those numbers are accurate but notice it's the UN
[11:21.400 --> 11:30.200]  launching this cutting off the economy directing it our new boss WHO the gold standard but with
[11:30.200 --> 11:35.520]  the other hand they've got David Beasley a well-spoken American who probably is a good
[11:35.520 --> 11:40.840]  person going please help us we need hundreds of millions of dollars donated right now everybody's
[11:40.840 --> 11:45.480]  dying so they create the problem and then they have the solution and I'm going to show
[11:45.480 --> 11:57.200]  you clips of him talking about that now I'm here with the biggest news there's more news
[11:57.200 --> 12:02.640]  today than every day before for 26 years I've covered we've now reached that quickening
[12:02.640 --> 12:09.200]  point where the news here is is is more news and more information than I covered in the
[12:09.200 --> 12:13.240]  last 26 years it's all and it's going to get double tomorrow it's just going to get
[12:13.240 --> 12:16.680]  crazier and crazier all of a sudden you'll be like what are all these combat robots
[12:16.680 --> 12:21.040]  here you know I'm doing well they're here to protect you but if you got a line they're
[12:21.040 --> 12:30.200]  going to kill you but first they have business with your parts the Central Committee does
[12:30.200 --> 12:35.440]  you see this is a scientific dictatorship communism is just the low-level term they give
[12:35.440 --> 12:42.120]  it but it's something a little different and I studied this cat this animal because I'm
[12:42.120 --> 12:47.280]  of a sigil throwback which is actually a jump forward just like you are to an idea of empowering
[12:47.280 --> 12:53.520]  humanity and raising it up and betting that it would produce more success and more beauty
[12:53.520 --> 13:00.440]  and more power for humanity and it does but it also produces decadence because people
[13:00.440 --> 13:09.080]  don't respect it and so we're now about to lose all of it now I wondered why there were
[13:09.080 --> 13:14.360]  New York Times articles and 60 minute specials that I was so busy I didn't even watch I just
[13:14.360 --> 13:23.280]  give me a transcript attacking yours truly and it was people like the high priestess lady
[13:23.280 --> 13:31.160]  and Fiona Hill saying hey you need to stop let's meet let's be friends because in political
[13:31.160 --> 13:39.120]  DC inside stuff that means you know stop well you're not stopping but see that was only
[13:39.120 --> 13:45.800]  the open door for a meeting with those individuals with the other folks and but see I'm so busy
[13:45.800 --> 13:50.760]  I just totally ignore the calls that the I've already been up to the DC law firms when you
[13:50.760 --> 13:55.560]  know the one of the top billionaires is trying to get me to join the club and they're just
[13:55.560 --> 14:01.160]  like hey you're not taking our calls we're gonna kill you or indict you and I'm like
[14:01.160 --> 14:06.080]  fire fire weapons I mean I'm not a lot of pissing contest I can't join Satan and killing
[14:06.080 --> 14:14.720]  my own species and so they've got the SWAT teams ready folks they've got the drones overhead
[14:14.720 --> 14:21.200]  they've got the FBI agents right outside they got it all ready because the bosses are saying
[14:21.200 --> 14:29.360]  Jones ain't taking our deals I'm saying pull the trigger man let's get it going because
[14:29.360 --> 14:34.560]  you and your families are all gonna be destroyed by the people you work for and I cannot join
[14:34.560 --> 14:40.200]  in with you it's not a pissing contest it's not that I'm this crazy guy with all this
[14:40.200 --> 14:48.240]  machismo and I've just got so much I don't have courage I'm scared of God man you think
[14:48.240 --> 14:52.400]  I could like live a few more years watching everybody die of vaccines that are tainted
[14:52.400 --> 14:56.920]  and watch this giant medical experiment because I'm part of the elite and I sit up at my big
[14:56.920 --> 15:01.720]  mountain house with my jet copter and I well we had to kill everybody to save the earth
[15:01.720 --> 15:07.680]  it was hard but I did it because I'm good and I I made the hard decisions I'm a social
[15:07.680 --> 15:11.920]  Darwinist and I just knew that it's sad to personalize these people but you know we
[15:11.920 --> 15:26.120]  had to kill them so just know that that what I'm telling you here on air I'm willing to
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.200]  die for and probably will because of it but that's okay because the only way out of this
[15:31.200 --> 15:37.880]  is fighting this is not an exercise in courage it's an exercise in survival for the species
[15:37.880 --> 15:43.480]  if I survive another 20 years groveling to these people that's a living death but if
[15:43.480 --> 15:49.040]  I die and the species makes it the next level then it's total success our entire species
[15:49.040 --> 15:58.120]  history is now bet on this moment now we cannot give up on what we were and who we will be
[15:58.120 --> 16:02.520]  this is a pandemic survival alert and the most time sensitive messages you will hear

[16:12.200 --> 16:17.720]  miss who should plan a crisis garden individuals families churches communities anyone or any
[16:17.720 --> 16:22.320]  group that sees hard times ahead let's face it even the main line media is talking about
[16:22.320 --> 16:26.160]  food supply disruptions and the growing number of grocery store workers who are becoming
[16:26.160 --> 16:31.240]  sick but there's more meat packing plans are closing mile long lines at food pantries and
[16:31.240 --> 16:36.480]  more farmers now in financial trouble the truth is growing nutrients dense vegetables this

[18:05.240 --> 18:10.480]  were sold out eight weeks ago and they told people they had food most folks who never
[18:10.480 --> 18:17.720]  were delivered their food well when our sponsors food began to run short they just didn't sales

[18:28.360 --> 18:34.360]  very soon again because the lockdown of the economy is killing food distribution farming
[18:34.360 --> 18:39.120]  you name it and now it's mainstream news the food shortages and delivery are already starting
[18:39.120 --> 18:44.960]  to happen if Trump can turn the economy back on and rest control of our system away from
[18:44.960 --> 18:49.360]  the globalist things may be okay but it looks like it's going to get very very rough so

[19:06.280 --> 19:09.800]  we've got a limited supply right now but it's selling out fast and I want those of you that
[19:09.800 --> 19:14.000]  haven't experienced living defense to get it for yourself here just part of one testimonial
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.880]  I look in January 2016 I went in a hospital I went in the VA hospital out here in Boyce
[19:18.880 --> 19:22.960]  and I was in there until June and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal
[19:22.960 --> 19:28.000]  was listening to info wars three hours a day and I kept hearing doctor group and all you
[19:28.000 --> 19:32.480]  guys talking about living defense let me tell you something man I had an internal digestive
[19:32.480 --> 19:36.720]  problem and I was stuffing with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried
[19:36.720 --> 19:40.520]  every time nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when I kept hearing
[19:40.520 --> 19:43.840]  you and doctor group and those commercials I said you know what I'm gonna get me some
[19:43.840 --> 19:47.080]  of that freaking living defense now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional because they

[20:22.000 --> 20:29.000]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[20:29.000 --> 20:50.560]  you know people say to me they say Alex we see you demonized on 60 minutes on CNN every
[20:50.560 --> 20:57.200]  day every week how you handling the reason I bring this point up is we have to change
[20:57.200 --> 21:03.720]  the way we think I'm handling things fine I'm built for this but I have such sorrow
[21:03.720 --> 21:13.040]  for humanity and our children it's not info wars that's dying it's not info wars that's
[21:13.040 --> 21:22.600]  possibly in its last days it's America this is the real world ladies and gentlemen this
[21:22.600 --> 21:37.560]  is what we've turned into this is what we have become and a bunch of weak followers summon
[21:37.560 --> 21:47.240]  and conjure wolves but a wolf is out eating sheep a wolf is out eating deer it's mean
[21:47.240 --> 21:57.360]  to call these people wolves as wolves don't deserve that so it really is just something
[21:57.360 --> 22:02.640]  people have to go through don't they it's why there's cycles until you value freedom
[22:02.640 --> 22:07.160]  again out of this audience values it because your background your history what you experienced
[22:07.160 --> 22:18.640]  your spiritual connections but here in the end game the very worst things in human history
[22:18.640 --> 22:25.440]  are about to all be magnified all at once and people who are in denial by the end of
[22:25.440 --> 22:29.440]  it are just going to be committing suicide and mash and they'll be robots pulling up
[22:29.440 --> 22:34.320]  to your door with a little you know government prescription to good you're ending it for the
[22:34.320 --> 22:41.080]  planet you have cut the load on the carbon because they're taking the infrastructure
[22:41.080 --> 22:48.120]  out and they're teaching everyone that only certain people are essential and that idea
[22:48.120 --> 23:00.560]  is beyond the Nazis everything being done is a cold blooded scientific dictatorship
[23:00.560 --> 23:10.360]  a bit of it planned in white papers and in battle drills by the big corporate global
[23:10.360 --> 23:16.040]  world when you watch Bill Gates getting all these awards for eugenics and depopulation
[23:16.040 --> 23:22.600]  of these events will play a few clips of it a moment they always say well government
[23:22.600 --> 23:29.960]  wouldn't do its job so Bill Gates stepped up but that means the the big money behind
[23:29.960 --> 23:36.960]  Bill Gates the robber barons stepped up and they use the free market monopoly capitalism
[23:36.960 --> 23:51.240]  to buy up all the infrastructure so now they're in control and they're going to hurt you really
[23:51.240 --> 24:01.600]  bad now the instinctive thing at a very primitive level is to get violent what against the cop
[24:01.600 --> 24:05.760]  down the street that's just as dumb as the average person that know what's going on this
[24:05.760 --> 24:12.840]  is ignorant no that's not the state this is even the state this is a cult a power cult
[24:12.840 --> 24:20.760]  that infests corporations private lives governments institutions they're mad scientists and they're
[24:20.760 --> 24:24.840]  the scientists and they've got their act together they're organized and they believe that it's
[24:24.840 --> 24:33.560]  survival of the fittest social Darwinism better learn these terms quick and it's their duty
[24:33.560 --> 24:39.440]  to be strong and to carry this out and they're very sad that they have to do it but that
[24:39.440 --> 24:46.040]  if they can force their will on you that that's their divine right and because you buckled
[24:46.040 --> 24:52.160]  you deserve it I've been around some of these people and again I've had them try to get
[24:52.160 --> 24:58.200]  me to join them and and there's a coldness and an emptiness and just a feeling of depression
[24:58.200 --> 25:03.960]  and failure around them that I don't feel anywhere else when I'm ready to die for humanity
[25:03.960 --> 25:10.960]  when I when I when I don't have fear and when I standing up and I feel so good and things
[25:10.960 --> 25:17.320]  are so beautiful and I can literally just see through things but even being near these
[25:17.320 --> 25:27.200]  people I feel spiritual death because God like oxygen is being sucked out of the room
[25:27.200 --> 25:32.640]  and like you want to join these people feel this it's the worst torture you could imagine
[25:32.640 --> 25:38.440]  because you start feeling the betrayal of all the innocence and all the children and
[25:38.440 --> 25:43.560]  all the destroyed cultures and civilizations and all the dreams it's not a dream catcher
[25:43.560 --> 25:52.720]  it's a dreams destroyer and you're like how would anyone serve this so this is the end
[25:52.720 --> 25:58.320]  of everything they're never going to open up again they're never going to things are
[25:58.320 --> 26:06.560]  never going back to normal until you just say no I mean I started the show and I said
[26:06.560 --> 26:09.720]  I've never had this much news to cover because the problem just gets worse and worse by the
[26:09.720 --> 26:14.480]  day because you can't just mention one of these articles and not go into it because
[26:14.480 --> 26:20.360]  it becomes a lie if you don't analyze it you're just putting out the emblematic statement
[26:20.360 --> 26:27.560]  instead of like drilling down to the core of it I could talk for 10 hours conservatively
[26:27.560 --> 26:33.760]  on the one statement of Trump to take action against China and WHO over COVID-19 that is
[26:33.760 --> 26:40.640]  a incredibly positive thing but it means so much and is so dangerous that's one story
[26:40.640 --> 26:47.080]  in the stack look at this is probably 300 articles and so if I am crazy it's that I probably
[26:47.080 --> 26:52.600]  scanned over half of these today and read a bunch of them I mean I just sit here studying
[26:52.600 --> 26:58.680]  it and then by the time I get on air I'm like over prepared because one of these stories
[26:58.680 --> 27:08.760]  is earth shaking a US president is saying China and the WHO will pay makes me so proud
[27:08.760 --> 27:23.800]  to support Trump that moment and then I spent 30 minutes today checking into this 30 minutes
[27:23.800 --> 27:35.720]  for me is a lot of time I probably spent this is a nightmare right here but then I understand
[27:35.720 --> 27:49.600]  what Trump's doing Trump's operation warps speed aims to rush coronavirus vaccine you
[27:49.600 --> 27:54.480]  know they've been wetting our appetite say oh two years three years oh maybe you're gonna
[27:54.480 --> 28:01.160]  have you know you can't get this this is too explosive and I mean obviously I'm like no
[28:01.160 --> 28:04.720]  they're gonna have the vaccine this year folks they're gonna have it by the fall the little
[28:04.720 --> 28:11.800]  more indicates have the coronavirus company were up patented and they've got it ready
[28:11.800 --> 28:20.280]  to put in the solution they've got the vaccine and here it is right here the little more
[28:20.280 --> 28:23.640]  indicates from the whole thing I mean you just you know the next piece of it because
[28:23.640 --> 28:30.160]  I already know the whole backstory so that's another big story then mainstream news comes
[28:30.160 --> 28:35.920]  out and says okay Fauci will help weaponize viruses at the Wuhan lab now of course you
[28:35.920 --> 28:41.920]  heard that 11 weeks ago with Dr. Boyle on the show but why is that coming out and being
[28:41.920 --> 28:48.920]  said now and that's just the tip of the iceberg please gentlemen here's the truth everybody

[30:53.040 --> 30:54.680]  Triple A, 253, 339.
[30:54.680 --> 30:56.440]  Triple A, 253, 339.
[30:56.440 --> 30:59.160]  That's InfoWorstore.com.
[30:59.160 --> 31:01.000]  How do you put a people under house arrest?
[31:01.000 --> 31:02.960]  How do you put them under siege?
[31:02.960 --> 31:05.880]  Well, you tell them you're protecting them from a virus
[31:05.880 --> 31:09.240]  that you yourself cooked up with the globalist deep state
[31:09.240 --> 31:12.320]  and then had China release to then take down
[31:12.320 --> 31:15.320]  the populist president and those pesky American people
[31:15.320 --> 31:17.440]  that have become too uppity.
[31:17.440 --> 31:18.760]  Bill Maher even admitted it.
[31:18.760 --> 31:20.680]  Man, I hope we have a depression.
[31:20.680 --> 31:22.920]  And now they've tailored the whole thing
[31:22.920 --> 31:24.880]  where the big corporations and the media
[31:24.880 --> 31:27.840]  are gonna keep the country closed
[31:27.840 --> 31:29.880]  along with the help of the blue states and blue states
[31:29.880 --> 31:33.000]  all the time blaming Trump and capitalism
[31:33.000 --> 31:35.960]  and Americanism for the depression it creates.
[31:35.960 --> 31:39.040]  If America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us,
[31:39.040 --> 31:42.360]  but as for me, I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it.
[31:42.360 --> 31:44.480]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure
[31:44.480 --> 31:47.240]  that they're the good people keeping everybody safe,
[31:47.240 --> 31:48.880]  but that's not what they're doing.
[31:48.880 --> 31:50.920]  They are pulling America up by its roots
[31:50.920 --> 31:54.720]  and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health,
[31:54.720 --> 31:56.640]  our whole world and committing millions
[31:56.640 --> 31:58.960]  of third world people to death.
[31:58.960 --> 32:01.280]  And I'm here to tell you, I don't need you to thank me
[32:01.280 --> 32:02.560]  and tell me I've done a good job.
[32:02.560 --> 32:05.200]  I've done nothing but my duty.
[32:05.200 --> 32:07.800]  I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum
[32:07.800 --> 32:09.680]  coming after innocent people
[32:09.680 --> 32:12.560]  and I've been psyched up for 13 years
[32:12.560 --> 32:16.000]  and I'll never stop while I'm drawing breath.
[32:16.000 --> 32:19.760]  For 26 years, Alex Jones and InfoWars
[32:19.760 --> 32:23.960]  have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide,
[32:23.960 --> 32:27.600]  waking people up to the new world order,
[32:27.600 --> 32:32.080]  Bohemian Grove, the American deep state,
[32:32.080 --> 32:34.640]  the rise of communist China,
[32:34.640 --> 32:37.960]  the plan for global depopulation
[32:37.960 --> 32:41.880]  and global elite pedophiles who prey off of our young.
[32:42.960 --> 32:45.600]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us,
[32:45.600 --> 32:49.360]  but because of your support, our fight continues.
[32:49.360 --> 32:52.240]  Join us, support the InfoWars
[32:52.240 --> 32:55.160]  and together we will slay the dragon.
[32:55.160 --> 32:57.120]  Keep fighting Alex, you're the gladiator.
[32:57.120 --> 33:01.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:27.120 --> 33:29.120]  Alex Jones.
[33:43.120 --> 33:48.640]  As a child, I saw amazing things happen
[33:48.640 --> 33:51.480]  because I didn't realize what was going on.
[33:51.480 --> 33:54.800]  The enemy knew what we were going to do
[33:54.800 --> 33:56.200]  and did a lot of horrible things to me
[33:56.200 --> 33:58.800]  to stop us from being at this point.
[33:58.800 --> 34:00.840]  And that's not something special.
[34:00.840 --> 34:02.920]  It's incredibly special.
[34:02.920 --> 34:05.400]  And I know a lot of you have experienced this as well.
[34:05.400 --> 34:07.960]  You imagine the spiritual war that goes on
[34:07.960 --> 34:11.000]  to get women to kill their sons and daughters.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.400]  The incredible people we've lost in God's plan.
[34:14.680 --> 34:18.440]  Now we've been taught to devalue human life.
[34:18.440 --> 34:22.600]  I've noticed how God works in mysterious ways.
[34:22.600 --> 34:25.000]  You know, billions of people have been aborted.
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.160]  And so billions of us are going to die and we deserve it.
[34:36.280 --> 34:38.440]  But Bill Gates and the New World Order
[34:38.440 --> 34:43.000]  are not the righteous executioners of God's wrath.
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.240]  They are the midwives of this satanic system
[34:47.240 --> 34:50.920]  that pro-generated everything we've already witnessed.
[34:52.280 --> 34:55.720]  So earlier you heard me list a few of the articles.
[34:57.080 --> 35:00.680]  There's like 10 more gigantic stories after that.
[35:00.680 --> 35:04.520]  Each one bone-shaking.
[35:04.520 --> 35:10.520]  National brigades coming to forcibly inoculate you
[35:10.520 --> 35:13.960]  and your family, reporting and tracking with dogs
[35:13.960 --> 35:16.200]  that quote, smell COVID.
[35:17.320 --> 35:19.400]  Oh, but it's not political.
[35:19.400 --> 35:22.120]  It's for everyone's safety, but it's the Democrats
[35:22.120 --> 35:24.280]  and the WHO with all their thoughts.
[35:24.280 --> 35:27.000]  And I'm not going to say it's not political.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.320]  It's for everyone's safety, but it's the Democrats
[35:29.320 --> 35:31.480]  and the WHO with all their thoughts.
[35:31.480 --> 35:34.680]  And Fauci running the lab.
[35:34.680 --> 35:37.800]  I mean, you just think Francis Boyle just came on here
[35:37.800 --> 35:41.400]  and said, oh, Fauci gave him this system.
[35:41.400 --> 35:43.160]  He didn't just get that out of the news.
[35:43.160 --> 35:44.600]  He got that from his sources.
[35:44.600 --> 35:46.600]  And he risked his life to tell you that.
[35:48.680 --> 35:50.360]  And I'm not just putting that out there like,
[35:50.360 --> 35:51.720]  oh, we're heroes or something.
[35:51.720 --> 35:54.360]  I'm trying to explain like, this isn't a game,
[35:54.360 --> 35:55.400]  ladies and gentlemen.
[35:55.400 --> 35:58.360]  We're not playing a game of violence.
[35:58.360 --> 36:01.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're not playing a game of volleyball
[36:01.800 --> 36:03.720]  here or or Tiddlywanks.
[36:03.720 --> 36:06.920]  This is life and death for the whole future of everything.
[36:08.600 --> 36:10.760]  So everybody out there that keeps wanting to kiss the ass
[36:10.760 --> 36:12.520]  of evil thinking you're going to get ahead,
[36:12.520 --> 36:13.880]  you're about to get hurt really bad.
[36:13.880 --> 36:15.080]  It's not from me.
[36:15.080 --> 36:18.120]  By the way, I'm a nonviolent guy, offensively.
[36:18.120 --> 36:20.040]  I don't want violence against Bill Gates or any of these people.
[36:20.040 --> 36:21.400]  They got God to deal with.
[36:21.400 --> 36:24.920]  I just want all of you that have Stockholm syndrome,
[36:24.920 --> 36:26.440]  not a regular audience, but the general public
[36:26.440 --> 36:29.480]  to tune in to the show because we're for boating
[36:29.480 --> 36:32.120]  and we're still on the air this morning.
[36:32.120 --> 36:34.440]  And I got up at like five AM, had coffee,
[36:34.440 --> 36:37.880]  went out to the local Greenbelt, hiked a few miles,
[36:37.880 --> 36:40.360]  hiking back, the sun's coming up.
[36:40.360 --> 36:44.120]  And I run into people where there'd be like 15 foot wide paths
[36:44.120 --> 36:47.880]  and they'd be running with mask on.
[36:48.520 --> 36:50.760]  And then they like, like, like get all scared
[36:50.760 --> 36:53.240]  like this little virtue signal dance.
[36:53.240 --> 36:57.160]  And I'm like, why are you out here?
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.520]  But that's the wicked flea with not pursuit
[37:04.520 --> 37:08.120]  because their whole lives groveling, going along,
[37:08.120 --> 37:08.920]  got them ahead.
[37:08.920 --> 37:10.280]  But that was all the training.
[37:10.280 --> 37:13.400]  It's like having a cow.
[37:14.840 --> 37:18.360]  And you know, my grandfather probably usually
[37:18.360 --> 37:19.880]  only had 100 cows or so.
[37:19.880 --> 37:21.480]  He didn't like to run too many on the ranch.
[37:21.480 --> 37:23.160]  He just got the tax exemption with that.
[37:23.160 --> 37:24.360]  But I mean, these things would come up
[37:24.360 --> 37:26.200]  and he'd feed them range cubes and pet them
[37:26.200 --> 37:27.160]  and everything else.
[37:27.160 --> 37:30.360]  And then I remember being like five years old
[37:30.360 --> 37:32.760]  and they said, well, we're going to butcher
[37:32.760 --> 37:35.080]  one of these yearling calves.
[37:35.080 --> 37:36.360]  You know, it's not a little calf.
[37:36.360 --> 37:39.560]  It's big, but it's not veal, but it tastes as good as veal.
[37:39.560 --> 37:42.600]  It's about a third the size of a regular cow gets up to.
[37:42.600 --> 37:44.760]  And we're not happy about this.
[37:44.760 --> 37:47.160]  And we like this cow, but we're going to shoot it in the head.
[37:47.160 --> 37:48.200]  Let's go to the barn.
[37:48.200 --> 37:49.400]  Get some range cubes.
[37:49.400 --> 37:52.920]  Yeah, we like them, but these are the animals we do here.
[37:52.920 --> 37:56.200]  Here's a 22 and he's not going to feel anything,
[37:56.200 --> 37:58.360]  but we're just going to shoot them in the head.
[37:58.360 --> 37:59.640]  Now we're going to tie them up with chains,
[38:00.440 --> 38:01.000]  cut them up.
[38:01.880 --> 38:05.000]  And that next day they said, here's Sam.
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.040]  And I was eating this tea bomb.
[38:06.840 --> 38:08.120]  And that was just normal farming.
[38:08.120 --> 38:09.240]  It wasn't a mean thing.
[38:09.240 --> 38:11.720]  I was being taught how to process something.
[38:15.240 --> 38:16.520]  And I remember that cow had a little,
[38:16.520 --> 38:21.240]  it's a herford and a little white curls, little bread face,
[38:21.240 --> 38:23.560]  little sweet little thing, little 22 rifle right there.
[38:28.440 --> 38:29.800]  And why do I tell that story?
[38:31.800 --> 38:34.680]  Because that's how the globalists treat you.
[38:34.680 --> 38:35.800]  And that's how they see you.
[38:36.440 --> 38:38.040]  They're just killing an animal.
[38:38.040 --> 38:39.480]  They're just rendering you down.
[38:39.480 --> 38:41.800]  And because you don't stand up and you don't say no,
[38:41.800 --> 38:43.240]  they think they're allowed to.
[38:43.240 --> 38:47.320]  And psychology is not God, but a lot of it's true
[38:47.320 --> 38:50.920]  because it just names activities and behaviors
[38:50.920 --> 38:53.240]  that are already known and already accepted.
[38:53.240 --> 38:56.840]  And so they just index it and then create a language around it.
[38:57.960 --> 39:00.520]  Like, could you say English language is reality?
[39:00.520 --> 39:02.520]  No, it's a way of describing things.
[39:02.520 --> 39:04.920]  Or is Arabic the only God's language?
[39:04.920 --> 39:06.200]  No, it's just a way of describing it.
[39:06.200 --> 39:08.760]  Or is it German or is Russian or is Japanese?
[39:08.760 --> 39:10.840]  It's just a system of seeing things.
[39:10.840 --> 39:14.600]  So when you hear about Stockholm syndrome developed in Sweden,
[39:14.600 --> 39:18.440]  where they found that kidnapped prisoners, particularly women,
[39:18.440 --> 39:21.320]  who are grabbed by people that hold them for a year in captivity,
[39:21.320 --> 39:25.080]  rape them, torture them, the women start defending the captors.
[39:25.080 --> 39:28.600]  Because if they were there every day hating this person that's raping them
[39:28.600 --> 39:31.880]  and hating this person that's beating them, they would go crazy
[39:31.880 --> 39:32.920]  because they don't have a way out.
[39:32.920 --> 39:34.200]  They can't fight their way out.
[39:34.200 --> 39:37.160]  So they, the mind has a switch it throws
[39:37.160 --> 39:38.280]  where it starts to fall.
[39:38.280 --> 39:42.120]  The mind has a switch it throws where it starts defending the abuse.
[39:45.160 --> 39:46.040]  And that's what this is.
[39:46.040 --> 39:47.320]  It's mass Stockholm syndrome.
[39:48.360 --> 39:51.400]  And those of us that submit to the Stockholm syndrome
[39:52.920 --> 39:54.920]  empower these people that are under it.
[39:54.920 --> 39:58.680]  Because the average person's deep down is scared by the lockdown
[39:58.680 --> 39:59.880]  and the dystopia nature.
[39:59.880 --> 40:02.920]  So they want to just believe that, hey, it'll all be over if we're just nice.
[40:02.920 --> 40:04.440]  But you notice Governor Newsom just said,
[40:04.440 --> 40:07.320]  he's the leader of this thing at this level under the Clinton Foundation.
[40:07.320 --> 40:09.720]  He just said, sorry, the beaches are all closed.
[40:09.720 --> 40:10.920]  This is going to go for years.
[40:11.720 --> 40:13.080]  We're going to have people come to your house
[40:14.760 --> 40:18.680]  to make sure you've got your vaccines and to make sure you're allowed to go out.
[40:18.680 --> 40:20.600]  And we're going to come after you.
[40:21.480 --> 40:24.120]  And every few months it'll be on the billboards.
[40:24.120 --> 40:26.600]  It'll be on your text alerts, wear your mask, wear your mask.
[40:26.600 --> 40:30.920]  And if you don't, they're going to have a group of people break your ribs.
[40:32.840 --> 40:35.880]  See, they decided the Maoist model that worked in China.
[40:35.880 --> 40:40.520]  You think it was easy back when there were 600 million Chinese
[40:41.720 --> 40:45.400]  to make them all leave their farms and go to collectivist farms and starve to death?
[40:45.400 --> 40:46.120]  No, they fought.
[40:47.080 --> 40:51.800]  But they learned to get the youth, you see, and go, oh, your parents don't know.
[40:51.800 --> 40:55.240]  And first it was first Maoist like, oh, send your youth will train them
[40:55.240 --> 41:00.120]  on how to have electricity and how to have water and how to how to how to shoot guns.
[41:00.120 --> 41:02.360]  And then the Chinese were like, oh, yes.
[41:02.360 --> 41:05.080]  And like, yeah, we're ever the Japanese hurt us really bad.
[41:05.080 --> 41:05.880]  We're rebuilding.
[41:07.880 --> 41:09.400]  And their kids came back all arrogant.
[41:12.280 --> 41:15.800]  And they would get rewards for ratting out their parents and grandparents.
[41:15.800 --> 41:19.080]  And that's because if you'll do that to your mother, your father, your grandparents,
[41:19.080 --> 41:22.120]  they would get promoted to the party because they were psychotics.
[41:23.160 --> 41:24.280]  It was just a few percent.
[41:24.280 --> 41:26.920]  But like, if you'll report your mom and dad, if you'll sell your people out,
[41:27.720 --> 41:29.000]  they were all being tested.
[41:29.000 --> 41:35.480]  The Nazis would the SS would have them raise a German shepherd or a puppy
[41:36.200 --> 41:39.000]  for a couple years when they were the Hitler youth.
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.160]  And then they had to strangle that dog to prove they follow orders.
[41:43.160 --> 41:44.120]  Well, forget that.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.800]  You have to kill your parents to join the Communist Party China.
[41:49.800 --> 41:52.520]  GZ Ping's father was destroyed by them.
[41:52.520 --> 41:55.560]  And he said, screw my father.
[41:55.560 --> 41:59.400]  I love the Communist Party China.
[41:59.400 --> 42:03.720]  He betrayed his father who fought them.
[42:06.120 --> 42:10.760]  And so now he is the leader because he betrayed his family.
[42:13.240 --> 42:16.920]  I'm not going to betray my family and my family's you, the people of the world,
[42:16.920 --> 42:18.920]  no matter what color you are, where you came from.
[42:18.920 --> 42:21.800]  If you want a future and you love other people, then I'm your brother
[42:21.800 --> 42:24.920]  and I'm your sister and I'm your son and I'm your daughter.
[42:24.920 --> 42:27.240]  And I'm your grandparents and you're my grandparents.
[42:27.240 --> 42:28.520]  And we're together.
[42:28.520 --> 42:34.520]  And I will be tortured to death and die no matter how bad it is before I betray any of you.
[42:34.520 --> 42:39.640]  And I swear eternal allegiance with Jesus Christ in you.
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.680]  These people think there isn't a God.
[42:44.680 --> 42:47.240]  They think they're God, but they will be destroyed.
[42:47.800 --> 42:49.800]  Their time of destruction is close.
[42:51.080 --> 42:53.960]  They believe that they've set up the plan to destroy us.
[42:53.960 --> 42:57.960]  It is the plan that will destroy them forever.
[42:57.960 --> 43:00.360]  I'm always excited about Info Wars Life Products.
[43:00.360 --> 43:00.920]  They're amazing.
[43:00.920 --> 43:01.640]  They're cutting edge.
[43:01.640 --> 43:02.040]  You love them.
[43:02.040 --> 43:02.600]  I love them.
[43:02.600 --> 43:05.560]  And they find the Info War in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[43:06.280 --> 43:13.080]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[43:13.080 --> 43:20.680]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[43:20.680 --> 43:25.080]  And there's another innovation. It's the spray cap.
[43:25.080 --> 43:30.520]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, you goo, but it's high quality.
[43:30.520 --> 43:32.680]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[43:32.680 --> 43:35.880]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[43:35.880 --> 43:38.680]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes.
[43:38.680 --> 43:43.080]  But I just love it personally as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[43:43.080 --> 43:44.920]  So this is a real innovation.
[43:44.920 --> 43:48.280]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer
[43:48.280 --> 43:50.120]  that actually has essential oil in it.
[43:50.120 --> 43:51.400]  So it doesn't dry you out.
[43:51.400 --> 43:52.120]  It smells great.
[43:52.680 --> 43:53.800]  It's so refreshing.
[43:53.800 --> 44:19.800]  This is a big winner.
[44:24.120 --> 44:33.240]  This is our best selling overall for me and I told listeners at the end of last year
[44:33.240 --> 44:38.440]  that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup
[44:38.440 --> 44:39.720]  in them to find our operations.
[44:40.600 --> 44:43.480]  But because of what's happening and going on in the world right now,
[44:44.680 --> 44:50.680]  I really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of DNA Force Plus
[44:50.680 --> 44:53.960]  to have DNA Force Plus for yourself and your family.
[44:53.960 --> 45:23.240]  DNA Force Plus now 50% off.
[45:23.960 --> 45:28.440]  Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society,
[45:28.440 --> 45:30.920]  create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[45:30.920 --> 45:31.880]  This is insane.
[45:31.880 --> 45:34.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[45:34.600 --> 45:36.040]  You need to get prepared now.
[45:36.040 --> 45:40.520]  You need to get high quality storeable food now back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[45:40.520 --> 45:44.680]  And you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[45:44.680 --> 45:48.360]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people and to send you.
[45:48.360 --> 45:51.000]  Can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.520]  This is beyond 1984, the tyranny of the dual orders here.
[45:54.520 --> 45:57.000]  Get prepared now and spread the word in the info war.
[45:57.000 --> 45:58.360]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[45:59.480 --> 46:03.240]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think,
[46:03.240 --> 46:07.080]  even if it ends up hurting me short term, I believe in God and I believe in the long run.
[46:07.640 --> 46:11.560]  It'll end up being better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[46:11.560 --> 46:15.160]  I understand what comes around, goes around, you read what you saw, and I live that.
[46:15.160 --> 46:17.320]  And I fundamentally, at a cellular level, understand it.
[46:17.320 --> 46:23.000]  Now, if I would have hyped up the virus, was going to kill 3, 4, 5 million people like the UN did,
[46:23.560 --> 46:25.240]  I would have sold 5 times more supplements.
[46:25.800 --> 46:27.000]  But you know what, I didn't do that.
[46:27.800 --> 46:32.520]  But I said on a routine basis, regardless, people are vitamin D deficient.
[46:32.520 --> 46:33.640]  People are deficient.
[46:33.640 --> 46:35.160]  I had died and so many other issues.
[46:35.160 --> 46:37.960]  You need those products regardless.
[46:37.960 --> 46:41.320]  So, when we started selling out of vital mineral fusion, all the other products,
[46:41.320 --> 46:45.800]  I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off.
[46:45.800 --> 46:49.000]  Because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis,
[46:49.000 --> 46:53.080]  to make sure people were incentivized to up their bodies defenses.
[46:53.080 --> 47:19.080]  But now I'm telling you, with the economic crisis going on, get your storable food now.
[47:23.640 --> 47:33.480]  All right, let's engage in some informational mathematics.
[47:35.560 --> 47:39.560]  Let's engage in reality.
[47:40.920 --> 47:42.520]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[47:42.520 --> 47:46.680]  It's a very simple, active addition.
[47:46.680 --> 47:55.240]  Bill Gates says 1 in 10,000 have a bad reaction to his fictional vaccine.
[47:56.200 --> 48:02.520]  If you go look up even the CDC's own reports, a new vaccine is getting reports of 1 in 100 or so.
[48:05.400 --> 48:07.480]  An experimental vaccine, even more dangerous.
[48:07.480 --> 48:20.040]  So, they've set the precedent to give people things that cause death and massive health problems,
[48:20.040 --> 48:22.600]  autoimmune disorders, lowering of the immune system.
[48:22.600 --> 48:23.720]  This is all confirmed.
[48:23.720 --> 48:28.440]  And why did Bill Gates come out in all these interviews and say,
[48:28.440 --> 48:37.800]  oh, actually, we need liability protection for this new vaccine.
[48:37.800 --> 48:39.960]  Because 700,000 people are going to get sick and die.
[48:39.960 --> 48:41.000]  I'll play the clip in a moment.
[48:41.640 --> 48:42.840]  Someone gets sick, someone will die.
[48:43.400 --> 48:44.440]  It's a side effect death.
[48:46.200 --> 48:50.840]  Now, you try to put on Facebook an insert of a flu vaccine saying it can kill you,
[48:50.840 --> 48:52.680]  that it's got fetal tissue in it.
[48:52.680 --> 48:53.640]  They'll ban your ass.
[48:53.640 --> 49:00.280]  Just like medical doctors coming out and saying almost no one's sick, this is a giant hoax,
[49:00.280 --> 49:01.160]  your ass is banned.
[49:04.040 --> 49:05.320]  Because that's how free speech works.
[49:05.320 --> 49:11.800]  When you don't support the dumbass KKK speech, your speech is gone the next year, which it is now.
[49:12.840 --> 49:14.360]  Oh, it's a private company.
[49:14.360 --> 49:17.000]  Now, they're saying they're listening to your phone calls and they're all digital.
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.120]  They're going to block those.
[49:18.120 --> 49:22.040]  This is a total takeover in live time spying on you.
[49:22.040 --> 49:24.840]  When they're watching what you say in live time, that's surveillance.
[49:31.320 --> 49:32.360]  So let me do my best here.
[49:34.040 --> 49:34.760]  Let's do this math.
[49:36.360 --> 49:41.480]  Bill Gates says that, oh yeah, 700,000 people when we give everybody this vaccine
[49:42.600 --> 49:43.960]  are going to get sick or have problems.
[49:46.120 --> 49:47.480]  That's the problems for some of them.
[49:48.280 --> 49:49.320]  We're never talking again.
[49:49.320 --> 49:52.920]  Or if you're 30 years old, your parents are changing your diapers, that's a problem.
[49:53.960 --> 49:54.920]  Ways down everything.
[49:55.560 --> 49:57.240]  Oh, but don't worry, they're going to pass laws.
[49:57.240 --> 49:58.840]  You can kill that autistic son.
[49:59.960 --> 50:01.080]  It is the son, isn't it?
[50:02.360 --> 50:04.760]  Just like Pharaoh said, you're going to give me your first moron.
[50:10.040 --> 50:13.160]  Some girls in the genetic studies get passed the information.
[50:13.160 --> 50:20.440]  I think those turn out to be queens, but men in the first generation are passed on the genetic memory.
[50:21.720 --> 50:23.880]  And that's what they're trying to stop is that genetic memory.
[50:29.480 --> 50:32.920]  Men are given genetic memory so they can expend themselves and defense the species.
[50:33.480 --> 50:34.600]  That's what men are supposed to do.
[50:34.600 --> 50:46.920]  Men are expendable, but now men think playing golf and acting tough is what a man is supposed to do.
[50:46.920 --> 50:48.520]  And so they don't stand up.
[50:48.520 --> 50:52.120]  And so they wonder why the women now worship at the feet of the beast.
[50:53.880 --> 50:59.000]  And the women, the news is like, they're the ones that accept it and they understand how good it is.
[50:59.000 --> 51:04.680]  They virtue signal and they feel good as 100 plus million people starve to death.
[51:04.680 --> 51:06.120]  It was 2 million, they said.
[51:06.120 --> 51:07.400]  And they went, oh, actually it's 33.
[51:07.400 --> 51:11.000]  But oh, it's 100 million because no one even put the logic together.
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.200]  Wait, you're the ones behind it, but now you're the ones telling us about it.
[51:17.240 --> 51:21.160]  Oh, their models of COVID were 20, 30, 40 times higher than they should have been.
[51:21.160 --> 51:22.440]  That was all fraud.
[51:22.440 --> 51:23.800]  And of course, they had the vaccine already ready.
[51:23.800 --> 51:27.080]  We already told you that people go, well, actually they patent the virus, Alex.
[51:27.080 --> 51:29.320]  The vaccine isn't ready.
[51:29.320 --> 51:33.320]  It's like saying, I have the bullets and I have the gun, but the bullets aren't in the gun yet.
[51:35.080 --> 51:36.680]  It's all childlike crap.
[51:37.480 --> 51:40.680]  The whole thing has been massively planned on record.
[51:42.360 --> 51:46.760]  And they are admitting it's to quote, lower the carbon footprint and save the earth.
[51:46.760 --> 52:00.840]  This whole thing is a convinced humans to starve to death and kill themselves and take sterilence.
[52:00.840 --> 52:04.280]  And I understand for people that have Stockholm syndrome who are scared,
[52:04.280 --> 52:05.720]  you just think this is too scary.
[52:05.720 --> 52:06.760]  This is too scary.
[52:06.760 --> 52:07.960]  I'll do whatever I'm told.
[52:07.960 --> 52:10.440]  You don't get out of this acting like that.
[52:10.440 --> 52:18.280]  I mean, I'm tough, but I don't like the stuff I know they've got in store for me.
[52:18.280 --> 52:18.840]  But you know what?
[52:18.840 --> 52:19.560]  I'm ready.
[52:19.560 --> 52:25.160]  I actually kind of look forward to it because that's what it takes to defeat these people
[52:25.160 --> 52:26.440]  is total commitment.
[52:27.480 --> 52:30.520]  And I want our species going on forever.
[52:30.520 --> 52:31.800]  I want those victories.
[52:32.440 --> 52:34.280]  I want to defeat these people.
[52:34.280 --> 52:37.800]  And I am so honored to be here, but you need to have that attitude.
[52:37.800 --> 52:41.800]  Not like sacrificing is something tough or something you gave up.
[52:41.800 --> 52:44.520]  Or, oh, Alex, thank you for what you do.
[52:44.520 --> 52:46.120]  Thank me for what I do.
[52:47.800 --> 52:50.600]  Fighting a bunch of satanic devil worshipers.
[52:50.600 --> 52:53.720]  How the hell am I supposed to give up or join them?
[52:55.000 --> 52:55.640]  Can't do it.
[52:56.520 --> 52:57.560]  Can't sell out.
[52:58.120 --> 52:59.640]  Can't betray.
[52:59.640 --> 53:02.040]  Can't back down default war.
[53:03.720 --> 53:05.080]  How do you think we got here?
[53:05.080 --> 53:07.080]  Who do you think you are?
[53:08.280 --> 53:09.080]  What the hell?
[53:09.960 --> 53:11.720]  This ain't some heroic action.
[53:13.080 --> 53:14.440]  Sucking air into my lungs.
[53:14.440 --> 53:15.640]  Is it some heroic action?
[53:15.640 --> 53:20.040]  It's because I'm alive till the day I die and my soul's eternal.
[53:21.880 --> 53:23.640]  And I will not be damned to hell.
[53:23.640 --> 53:25.560]  I will get away from these people.
[53:25.560 --> 53:29.560]  My one desire is to not be around devil worshipers and new world order people.
[53:31.400 --> 53:33.720]  We're a planet and they're in control of it.
[53:33.720 --> 53:35.080]  But here's the pretty part about it.
[53:35.080 --> 53:36.760]  God's in control of the universe.
[53:36.760 --> 53:39.800]  And that's what I get is to be away from them.
[53:40.840 --> 53:43.320]  And to be with all the other people that are good.
[53:43.320 --> 53:45.160]  You imagine how good that's going to be?
[53:52.680 --> 53:56.280]  I'm going to be with my grandparents and all those before them.
[53:56.280 --> 54:00.600]  I'm going to get to know them at a level way above human understanding
[54:00.600 --> 54:04.440]  and be able to interface with them.
[54:04.440 --> 54:07.960]  That is what this is all about ladies and gentlemen, is the next level.
[54:07.960 --> 54:11.800]  And that's why you cannot bow in fear to the Satanists.
[54:12.760 --> 54:14.120]  They are pathetic.
[54:16.120 --> 54:17.240]  All right, I'm going to stop right there.
[54:18.600 --> 54:19.960]  I've got to cover all this news.
[54:20.840 --> 54:22.840]  You know, I started this hour and I told you that
[54:22.840 --> 54:31.400]  I was going to sit there and talk about two plus two equals four.
[54:32.520 --> 54:34.040]  But what is two plus two equals four?
[54:38.760 --> 54:41.880]  You got Bill Gates saying, yeah, this is going to hurt and kill a bunch of people.
[54:41.880 --> 54:45.480]  And then you've got his surrogates through the Clinton Foundation saying,
[54:45.480 --> 54:49.880]  we've got organizations and armies that are going to come out and track you
[54:49.880 --> 54:52.120]  and with dogs that smell you.
[54:52.120 --> 54:53.720]  And you couldn't make this up.
[54:56.040 --> 54:58.280]  So I got something that's going to hurt you.
[54:59.160 --> 55:01.560]  And I got the general public
[55:03.880 --> 55:08.520]  given police power coming to make you do it.
[55:08.520 --> 55:10.200]  Full reports at news wars.com.
[55:10.200 --> 55:14.040]  Army of medical brown shirts being created on a national level.
[55:14.040 --> 55:19.080]  So here's the clip of Gates and we'll play the clip of Obama.
[55:19.080 --> 55:21.720]  It's a few years old, but now it all makes sense.
[55:21.720 --> 55:22.760]  Here's Gates.
[55:22.760 --> 55:27.480]  The efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge.
[55:27.480 --> 55:32.280]  You know, it turns out the flu vaccine isn't that effective in elderly people.
[55:32.280 --> 55:37.240]  We clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they're
[55:37.800 --> 55:39.640]  most at risk of that.
[55:39.640 --> 55:43.800]  And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people.
[55:43.800 --> 55:46.680]  And yet you don't have side effects.
[55:46.680 --> 55:52.280]  You know, if we have, you know, one in 10,000 side effects, that's, you know,
[55:52.920 --> 55:58.040]  way more 700,000, you know, people who will suffer from that.
[55:58.040 --> 56:03.160]  And that actual decision of, OK, let's go and give this vaccine to the entire world.
[56:04.040 --> 56:09.960]  Governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed.
[56:12.200 --> 56:15.960]  And then you read the president's report that Fauci put out saying,
[56:15.960 --> 56:19.560]  oh, there is, in Trump's plan, they're going to accelerate the vaccine.
[56:19.560 --> 56:21.400]  They say that's dangerous, but it's OK.
[56:21.400 --> 56:22.440]  It's even more dangerous.
[56:24.040 --> 56:25.880]  They're even telling you, this is going to hurt some people.
[56:25.880 --> 56:29.240]  So they're going to get us used to, you get to go outside,
[56:30.040 --> 56:32.120]  but some of you are going to die when you take it.
[56:32.120 --> 56:33.320]  Well, that's a good price to pay.
[56:33.320 --> 56:36.040]  See, they can't hide the death anymore.
[56:36.040 --> 56:39.560]  They can't hide it and just, oh, no, it's like human sacrifice.
[56:39.560 --> 56:43.480]  No, no, some of you must die so that all of us live,
[56:43.480 --> 56:46.120]  even though it causes tens of millions of starved to death.
[56:46.120 --> 56:47.640]  And you're like, well, that doesn't even make sense.
[56:48.360 --> 56:50.840]  Neither the million dead worldwide on your own fake numbers,
[56:50.840 --> 56:52.440]  but millions and millions are dying.
[56:52.440 --> 56:53.640]  Tens of millions are dying.
[56:53.640 --> 56:54.520]  It's like, shut up.
[56:55.720 --> 56:57.400]  That's inaccurate information.
[56:57.400 --> 56:59.000]  You're banned off the internet.
[56:59.720 --> 57:01.800]  What a dystopic orgy.
[57:02.600 --> 57:04.040]  So here's the two plus two equals four.
[57:05.080 --> 57:06.680]  He admits it's going to hurt some of you.
[57:07.320 --> 57:08.520]  And he's going to make you take it.
[57:10.280 --> 57:11.800]  And who's going to make you take it?
[57:11.800 --> 57:13.400]  Well, here's their army.
[57:18.120 --> 57:22.520]  Continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve
[57:22.520 --> 57:24.600]  the national security objectives that we've set.
[57:25.400 --> 57:28.360]  We've got to have a civilian national security force
[57:28.360 --> 57:32.600]  that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[57:32.600 --> 57:41.720]  And it's blue city, blue state run, recruited out of Democrats
[57:41.720 --> 57:44.200]  who now have medical power over your life.
[57:44.200 --> 57:45.720]  Oh, and COVID eat your testicles.
[57:45.720 --> 57:47.720]  And the vaccine is going to eat your testicles.
[57:47.720 --> 57:50.040]  Look, the globalist are Satanists.
[57:50.040 --> 57:50.440]  All right.
[57:51.320 --> 57:56.520]  Lord Rothschild recently posed at a gallery of art worshiping
[57:56.520 --> 57:58.280]  the devil and praising Lucifer.
[57:59.000 --> 58:00.680]  You cannot make this up.
[58:00.680 --> 58:02.200]  They flaunt it in our face.
[58:02.200 --> 58:03.560]  That's what environmentalism is.
[58:03.560 --> 58:06.200]  It's about having an anti-human future and having people
[58:06.200 --> 58:08.680]  live in a subsistence, feudal, serf state.
[58:09.240 --> 58:10.520]  That's what they want.
[58:10.520 --> 58:12.280]  These people that have stolen the planet
[58:12.280 --> 58:14.360]  are worth trillions of dollars.
[58:14.360 --> 58:16.200]  Do not want you having a good life.
[58:16.200 --> 58:17.800]  They know you're having fun.
[58:17.800 --> 58:19.880]  They know you have a great wife, a great husband,
[58:19.880 --> 58:20.680]  great children.
[58:20.680 --> 58:21.960]  They hate your guts.
[58:21.960 --> 58:25.320]  They are the most horrible, evil people on the planet.
[58:25.320 --> 58:29.880]  They openly fund racism, war, degeneracy, pedophilia,
[58:29.880 --> 58:31.000]  everything else.
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  Imagine the most horrible thing in the universe.
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.960]  And then imagine it doubled, tripled, quadrupled.
[58:35.960 --> 58:38.440]  And being gullible and being domesticated
[58:38.440 --> 58:40.920]  just makes them rise up and attack you harder.
[58:40.920 --> 58:42.920]  And they're the ones that launched this whole attack
[58:42.920 --> 58:43.720]  on the planet.
[58:43.720 --> 58:45.320]  And they are the enemy of humanity
[58:45.320 --> 58:46.760]  and need to be stood up against.
[58:48.920 --> 58:51.240]  It doesn't matter how hard I want to fight.
[58:51.960 --> 58:55.000]  If other human beings don't resonate with what I'm saying,
[58:55.000 --> 58:57.640]  if you don't spread the word, if you don't buy the products
[58:57.640 --> 58:59.880]  to fund our operation, the dog doesn't hunt.
[58:59.880 --> 59:00.840]  But you get that.
[59:00.840 --> 59:01.800]  You are patriots.
[59:01.800 --> 59:04.840]  You are people that live and work in the real world
[59:04.840 --> 59:07.080]  of a race, color, creed, and understand what's happening.
[59:07.080 --> 59:09.640]  And that's why when you call in and thank me for what I've done,
[59:09.640 --> 59:10.760]  it's really a sick joke.
[59:10.760 --> 59:12.600]  Thank you for what you've done.
[59:12.600 --> 59:13.640]  We're all of this together.
[59:13.640 --> 59:15.400]  We believe in the rights of the unborn.
[59:15.400 --> 59:16.440]  We believe in families.
[59:16.440 --> 59:18.200]  We believe in the right to self-defense.
[59:18.200 --> 59:21.000]  We believe in capitalism, America, and Jesus Christ,
[59:21.000 --> 59:21.720]  number one.
[59:21.720 --> 59:23.640]  And we believe in free speech.
[59:23.640 --> 59:26.440]  And so the fact that you shop with us
[59:26.440 --> 59:29.080]  and the fact that you spread the word about what we're doing
[59:29.080 --> 59:30.600]  does everything in the world.
[59:30.600 --> 59:32.200]  That's why I salute you.
[59:32.200 --> 59:35.160]  And I thank you continually, because the globalists thought
[59:35.160 --> 59:37.080]  they'd have this whole planet sewn up by now.
[59:37.080 --> 59:38.520]  They thought they'd be in charge.
[59:38.520 --> 59:39.560]  They thought they would have won.
[59:39.560 --> 59:43.480]  But they didn't count on you and I and others coming together.
[59:43.480 --> 1:00:00.760]  So God bless you all.
[1:00:00.760 --> 1:00:04.680]  Former President Bill Clinton recently spoke with governors
[1:00:04.680 --> 1:00:07.640]  from New York and California about the need
[1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:10.680]  for a national contact tracing corps.
[1:00:10.680 --> 1:00:15.240]  We need tracing agents in the hundreds and hundreds of people,
[1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:15.800]  right?
[1:00:15.800 --> 1:00:19.960]  You take the test and then you trace back all the contacts.
[1:00:19.960 --> 1:00:23.160]  It's never been done on this scale before.
[1:00:23.160 --> 1:00:28.360]  This is an army of tracers, they're basically investigators.
[1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:36.120]  We will do that the best we can with a seven state consortium.
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:39.560]  But it could have been done from the federal government
[1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:43.240]  on a much tighter, more efficient basis.
[1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:44.520]  You know, I agree with you on this.
[1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:47.960]  This contact tracing is very important.
[1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:52.360]  And it could enable our entire country
[1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:55.560]  for the first time to have a real public health
[1:00:55.560 --> 1:00:59.080]  system, a real public health corps.
[1:00:59.080 --> 1:01:02.600]  And I've thought about it in a lot of different ways.
[1:01:02.600 --> 1:01:06.040]  Could we make us a part of AmeriCorps
[1:01:06.040 --> 1:01:09.800]  and encourage people to come and do this work
[1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:14.040]  and earn some credits to go to college, for example?
[1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:16.360]  Is there some other way we could do it?
[1:01:16.360 --> 1:01:20.360]  But I know that my friend, you know well,
[1:01:20.360 --> 1:01:25.160]  Paul Farmer is heading up a program for Massachusetts
[1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:29.480]  now to try to get a state contact tracing corps.
[1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:33.240]  Do you think maybe you could get the governors to ask
[1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:36.840]  the Congress to fund that as a part of all this money
[1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:37.560]  they're giving you?
[1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:40.280]  Or maybe it's legal now to spend some of the money.
[1:01:40.280 --> 1:01:46.040]  But we need a national corps of healthy people
[1:01:46.040 --> 1:01:49.640]  who are properly trained to go out and do this contact tracing.
[1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:51.240]  We need the bodies.
[1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:54.680]  State health agencies are already hiring contact
[1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:56.760]  tracers nationwide.
[1:01:56.760 --> 1:02:01.240]  They're hiring inexperienced lay people who lost their jobs
[1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:04.040]  during the CCP virus shutdown.
[1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:08.360]  Governor Baker invited us to be part of a consortium
[1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:10.520]  and to offer some of the insights and experience
[1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:13.720]  we've had in other countries in hiring and training
[1:02:13.720 --> 1:02:19.960]  a group, really a whole cadre of community health workers
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:21.240]  or contact tracers rather.
[1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:23.480]  I can't help but say community health workers
[1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:27.000]  and they would be virtually trained.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:30.760]  They are being virtually trained and deployed right now.
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:34.440]  What we would do with this is that this virtual group
[1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:38.600]  of contact tracers would contact anybody
[1:02:38.600 --> 1:02:43.240]  who has tested positive to learn about the recent activities
[1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:45.080]  who they may have been in contact with.
[1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:47.960]  We had something like 7,000 people,
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:50.520]  9,000 people apply within the first couple of days
[1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:53.400]  to be contact tracers so that we can actually use people
[1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:57.560]  who are out of place, out of work rather,
[1:02:57.560 --> 1:03:01.240]  who can be trained, even lay people to do this work.
[1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:04.360]  It felt like a good thing for the economy also.
[1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:06.840]  But one of the things that you have to be able to do
[1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:11.240]  is to track people who are positive.
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:14.760]  Should we have a contract tracer core,
[1:03:14.760 --> 1:03:16.520]  even if we call it something more elegant?
[1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:21.400]  Should we really build the first public health network
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:24.040]  we've ever really built in this country around this issue?
[1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:27.000]  I think the answer is absolutely yes.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.880]  And that's just going to require an army of folks.
[1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:32.760]  California and New York, under the guidance
[1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:36.760]  of the Clinton Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
[1:03:36.760 --> 1:03:38.920]  are following the globalist script
[1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:40.680]  of the World Health Organization.
[1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:44.120]  Now we need to go and look in families
[1:03:44.120 --> 1:03:46.360]  to find those people who may be sick
[1:03:46.360 --> 1:03:51.080]  and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:57.080]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[1:03:59.640 --> 1:04:01.160]  There's a very simple equation.
[1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:02.840]  I'm talking about math today,
[1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:07.560]  but I'm talking about political, spiritual, economic math.
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:09.480]  You're going to get
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:14.280]  2 billion people starving to death
[1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:18.040]  and giant civil wars in the next 10 years
[1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:19.720]  if this depression continues.
[1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:21.240]  That's what the numbers show, about 2 billion.
[1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:23.960]  And that will always spill over
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:26.120]  and any in Pakistan will have a nuclear war.
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:27.000]  That's where it'll start.
[1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:31.320]  Now, if they just throttle this package forward,
[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:33.960]  they'll get about 30, 40 million dead this year.
[1:04:33.960 --> 1:04:36.600]  Now you add that, the COVID numbers doesn't even add up, does it?
[1:04:36.600 --> 1:04:38.600]  So next time somebody's got their mask on,
[1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:41.000]  doing their little virtue signaling dance in front of you,
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  at some store, when the Texas governor's
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.360]  saying you don't have to wear the damn mask,
[1:04:44.360 --> 1:04:46.440]  just say, you're a baby killer!
[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:49.080]  Millions are starving to death, you Nazi!
[1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:50.200]  That's what you tell them!
[1:04:56.760 --> 1:04:58.920]  The official numbers are now in.
[1:04:58.920 --> 1:05:02.440]  The United States is in the biggest financial collapse
[1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:03.720]  in our history.
[1:05:03.720 --> 1:05:06.280]  This is the worst employment collapse in U.S. history
[1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:08.200]  by a very wide margin,
[1:05:08.200 --> 1:05:10.760]  writes Michael Snyder at the Economic Collapse Block.
[1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:13.000]  At this point we should no longer speak
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:14.840]  of economic collapse as something
[1:05:14.840 --> 1:05:16.520]  that will happen in the future.
[1:05:16.520 --> 1:05:18.520]  It is now here.
[1:05:18.520 --> 1:05:22.120]  And he does an excellent job in the article on infowars.com
[1:05:22.120 --> 1:05:23.160]  of laying it out.
[1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:24.840]  This was done by design.
[1:05:25.560 --> 1:05:27.480]  Trump fought to open the economy,
[1:05:27.480 --> 1:05:31.720]  but the hijacked blue cities and states with the tricombs
[1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:35.560]  and with Hollywood and the media held America underwater
[1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:37.640]  until we sucked it into our lungs.
[1:05:37.640 --> 1:05:41.160]  And now we're lying there like a fish dying.
[1:05:41.160 --> 1:05:43.400]  There's not much time to get the water out of our lungs.
[1:05:43.400 --> 1:05:45.480]  So remember, for decades to come,
[1:05:45.480 --> 1:05:47.240]  when millions starve to death worldwide
[1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:49.640]  and you live in slums with no medicine,
[1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:51.400]  the globalist did this.
[1:05:51.400 --> 1:05:53.080]  The globalist did this.
[1:05:53.080 --> 1:05:54.600]  The globalist did this.
[1:05:54.600 --> 1:05:55.960]  The globalist did this.
[1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:10.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order,
[1:06:10.120 --> 1:06:11.560]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:11.560 --> 1:06:17.240]  Always the frontal assault.
[1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:18.760]  Everybody else creeps around.
[1:06:18.760 --> 1:06:19.560]  That's how we do.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.640]  Man, I'm not at liberty yet to tell everybody
[1:06:25.640 --> 1:06:26.760]  about the latest developments.
[1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:31.160]  Watch on today.
[1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:37.560]  But you judge a man by his enemies.
[1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:45.080]  And the way these criminals shot their mouths off
[1:06:45.080 --> 1:06:47.640]  and things they did are just incredible crimes.
[1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:52.120]  And if these supposed high and mighty people
[1:06:52.120 --> 1:06:54.440]  at the Clinton Foundation and at the Soros Group
[1:06:55.160 --> 1:06:57.560]  don't know people are leaking stuff and giving us documents,
[1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:02.280]  if they don't know that when they really make moves like this,
[1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:04.760]  after they did this to Flynn and Stone,
[1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:07.080]  everybody else, that the world isn't pissed
[1:07:07.080 --> 1:07:09.240]  and their own people have had enough of them,
[1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:11.960]  what do you think once you sprung the lockdown
[1:07:11.960 --> 1:07:14.920]  and the checkpoints and the forced inoculations,
[1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:16.760]  you're going to have everyone turn against you
[1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:18.840]  and you don't have your robots in force yet
[1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:20.840]  to cut the humans out of the equation.
[1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:23.560]  You don't have your protection units yet
[1:07:23.560 --> 1:07:25.240]  to be able to make humans obsolete.
[1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:32.600]  We've got the jump on you.
[1:07:32.600 --> 1:07:37.720]  And that's what's really amazing is God is in charge.
[1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:39.160]  God is in command.
[1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:40.760]  And I've just got to give it all to God.
[1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:41.880]  And I know you got to give it all to God.
[1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:43.240]  And I don't want to be cryptic here.
[1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:46.040]  Let me do this.
[1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:48.920]  Again, I'm sitting here last night
[1:07:48.920 --> 1:07:51.240]  and this morning getting ready for this broadcast.
[1:07:53.640 --> 1:07:55.480]  And I am looking at what's happening
[1:07:55.480 --> 1:07:58.280]  and it is just unbelievably insane.
[1:07:58.280 --> 1:08:04.440]  David Beasley is the head of the World Food Program
[1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:08.920]  and he says 130 plus million people are set to starve to death.
[1:08:10.040 --> 1:08:12.120]  And when he says that it gets almost no coverage
[1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:15.080]  because of the lockdown.
[1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:20.440]  It's not COVID virus causes 130 million
[1:08:20.440 --> 1:08:21.880]  to be at the edge of starvation,
[1:08:21.880 --> 1:08:23.560]  million starving to death a month.
[1:08:23.560 --> 1:08:24.440]  That means dying.
[1:08:24.440 --> 1:08:29.320]  You talk about famine, you talk about pestilence.
[1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:37.400]  He comes out and talks about that
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:40.440]  and it gets almost no coverage.
[1:08:40.440 --> 1:08:41.640]  Where is the president?
[1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:43.640]  The president should have this guy
[1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:45.640]  talk about checkmating the WHO.
[1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:49.240]  He should have, oh, the WHO is bad,
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:50.440]  but oh, you're good.
[1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:51.880]  Oh, you serve by starving to death.
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:56.520]  Oh, yeah, COVID, we have to overly to save a half million.
[1:08:56.520 --> 1:08:58.840]  We got to kill 20 million, 30 million, 40 million.
[1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:01.560]  She doesn't think about triaging stuff.
[1:09:04.120 --> 1:09:05.240]  Like you could say,
[1:09:05.240 --> 1:09:07.240]  I'm going to get that heart surgery I need,
[1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:11.320]  but I'm not going to feed my grandchildren.
[1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:12.760]  No, you wouldn't get the heart surgery.
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:14.680]  You'd feed your grandchildren.
[1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:17.080]  That's what this world's all about, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:19.400]  but the selfishness of wearing the mask
[1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:22.760]  and getting into it and being a drama queen.
[1:09:22.760 --> 1:09:23.640]  Oh, you're good.
[1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:24.680]  You wore your mask.
[1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:26.840]  It's all dog training.
[1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:29.240]  Oh, and then there's this one.
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:30.760]  Can we pull this up for TV viewers?
[1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:32.680]  I'll show a color version of this.
[1:09:32.680 --> 1:09:34.120]  You can't really see it in black and white.
[1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:36.840]  China implements social distancing hats
[1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:38.120]  for elementary students.
[1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:42.760]  And they wear like two foot dowels
[1:09:43.880 --> 1:09:47.800]  on the sides of their heads to bump into people
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:49.400]  and to keep them away from each other.
[1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:54.440]  And you can't really see it in the black and white.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:56.040]  You see it, but not as...
[1:09:56.040 --> 1:09:57.400]  You wait until you see the color and we'll pull it up.
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:09:59.240]  That's... Look at that.
[1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:02.040]  That's the Communist Party says,
[1:10:02.040 --> 1:10:03.080]  dress up like a clown
[1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:07.160]  and show you're submitting to this
[1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:09.240]  because what you're really going to submit to
[1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:15.240]  is a vaccine and a tracker chip.
[1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:17.000]  But right now it's wear a mask
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:17.560]  or a mask.
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:20.040]  Oh, I don't wear this mask anymore.
[1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:21.400]  All I get is the new chip.
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:23.800]  Oh, all of these take the vaccine
[1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:25.960]  and I'll have finally on my phone
[1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:27.560]  that I'm safe and I'm good
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:29.160]  and I'm not a suspect.
[1:10:29.160 --> 1:10:30.200]  And then the whole thing
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:34.440]  is a giant rollout
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:35.560]  and every mental patient
[1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:37.800]  and every weirdo is getting off
[1:10:37.800 --> 1:10:40.120]  on this thing that you're raping them.
[1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:42.120]  It's like universities say,
[1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:43.560]  don't get six feet from people
[1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:46.360]  and don't have speech and don't clap
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:47.800]  because it's sincerely hurt.
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:50.280]  It's all about just being basket cases
[1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:51.800]  so you're not productive
[1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:54.840]  so human industry and civilization breaks down
[1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:56.520]  and everybody starves to death.
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:10:58.360]  And people go, man, that's a nightmare
[1:10:58.360 --> 1:10:59.080]  and vision, Jones.
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:00.040]  You've got a sick brain.
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:02.040]  No, I never thought of any of this.
[1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:06.600]  I thought of other stuff.
[1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:10.840]  A lot of really beautiful things.
[1:11:12.040 --> 1:11:13.480]  I'm not thinking about this stuff.
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:15.240]  I didn't come up with any of this stuff.
[1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:17.240]  They write big articles
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:18.280]  having like one yesterday going,
[1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:19.880]  Jones is an incredibly dark poet.
[1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:21.080]  He could beat Stephen King
[1:11:21.080 --> 1:11:22.440]  and he wasn't such a con man
[1:11:22.440 --> 1:11:23.640]  to sell protein powder.
[1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:26.280]  You know, the stuff he comes up with
[1:11:26.280 --> 1:11:27.880]  is just so nightmarish
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:29.960]  and he's like the new HP Lovecraft.
[1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:32.120]  I didn't come up with any of it.
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:36.360]  Zero, zero, zero.
[1:11:37.160 --> 1:11:38.360]  You came up with it.
[1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:41.240]  You psychotics that built this thing.
[1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:43.000]  And that's the Stockholm syndrome of the left.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.120]  I mean, their poetry is about aborting babies
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:49.160]  and death and destruction and just insane.
[1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:50.760]  And then they look at me and say,
[1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:52.760]  this guy says, we're bad.
[1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:56.200]  We just want a social distance to save human lives.
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:11:58.760]  Even though the leader of your group, Bill Gates, says,
[1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:00.360]  he wants to depopulate the planet
[1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:01.800]  and kill all the old people.
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:04.920]  And publicly, his dad ran Planned Parenthood.
[1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:05.960]  He's a eugenicist.
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:08.120]  And it's like you're not listening.
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:11.240]  Well, let me just say it this way.
[1:12:11.240 --> 1:12:13.240]  And it's the prodigal son.
[1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:15.000]  He runs off of the family inheritance.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.040]  His dad gives it to him.
[1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:17.640]  He comes back a decade later.
[1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:18.520]  He's the second born.
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:19.640]  He only got partly inheritance.
[1:12:19.640 --> 1:12:21.640]  And the firstborn's running everything great.
[1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:27.080]  And he comes in, he says, why are you throwing a party
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:30.040]  and killing the best calf for my brother
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:31.720]  when he's a loser?
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:33.080]  And he's been gone 10 years
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:34.040]  and ran off with his inheritance.
[1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:35.000]  And I've been here a bit of a while.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:36.120]  The dad says, you know,
[1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:38.120]  he ran off with his inheritance and I've been here a bit of a while.
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:41.240]  The dad goes, I love you 5,000 times more.
[1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:42.920]  Can you imagine the party I threw?
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:46.280]  Did you run off and come back?
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:51.000]  We got to make him feel good for what he's done, dumbass.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.320]  This is all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:12:53.320 --> 1:12:57.080]  Can you imagine?
[1:12:57.080 --> 1:12:58.280]  I'm not here.
[1:12:58.280 --> 1:13:00.120]  This is not for the people that are already awake.
[1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:01.400]  This is for people that aren't.
[1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:04.600]  They are the ones that matter.
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:06.280]  The globalists are going to organize them
[1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:09.480]  into paramilitary armies against us
[1:13:09.480 --> 1:13:10.520]  and are admitting it.
[1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:14.360]  Bill Clinton's foundation is running a brown shirt group,
[1:13:14.360 --> 1:13:20.280]  community organizing, giving law enforcement medical power,
[1:13:20.280 --> 1:13:26.680]  emergency eugenics power to an army of tracers
[1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:32.040]  to have access via big tech to everything on your phone.
[1:13:32.040 --> 1:13:33.400]  They've done the masses down.
[1:13:33.400 --> 1:13:35.240]  Now they're going to turn loose an army of them.
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:39.880]  You could not come up with a bigger, more nightmarish scenario
[1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:43.240]  if you tried.
[1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:50.280]  Army of medical brown shirts being created on a national level.
[1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:53.000]  And that scary headline doesn't even do it justice.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:01.400]  So let me do this.
[1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:09.960]  It is a...
[1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:12.280]  Let me explain why they want to shut this show down.
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:13.480]  OK.
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:14.840]  Trump knows this.
[1:14:14.840 --> 1:14:17.000]  The Defense Intelligence Agency knows this.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:18.840]  Large sections of other agencies that aren't
[1:14:18.840 --> 1:14:23.240]  suicidal maniacs and want a pro-human future understand now,
[1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:24.600]  OK, globalism is really bad.
[1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:26.120]  It's as bad as we heard.
[1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:28.200]  My job is to decompartmentalize.
[1:14:28.200 --> 1:14:31.000]  At the top, Trump knows all this stuff now.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:34.040]  But he doesn't have a way to go into the generals in those under him
[1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:36.520]  and go, by the way, it's a planetary extermination plan.
[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:38.280]  And they're going to incrementally roll it out.
[1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:42.680]  And it's a post-human carbon tax algorithm AI system
[1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:44.520]  because they're not ready.
[1:14:44.520 --> 1:14:48.760]  Our job is to, quote, radicalize the military, the police,
[1:14:48.760 --> 1:14:52.360]  the general public with stuff that sounds completely outlandish
[1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:57.400]  and crazy because it's true so that Trump can then do this.
[1:14:57.400 --> 1:14:59.400]  Trump up front tried to say, this is a hoax.
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:00.760]  This virus isn't a big deal.
[1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:02.280]  It's not locked things down.
[1:15:02.280 --> 1:15:04.360]  The public got into it.
[1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:07.480]  The blue states, the blue cities had too much power.
[1:15:07.480 --> 1:15:10.600]  And so Trump was unable just to get us to take it and say, hey,
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:11.800]  we've always had pandemics.
[1:15:11.800 --> 1:15:14.280]  Yeah, it'll kill 100,000 people, a million, whatever.
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:15.560]  We can't shut down the economy.
[1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:16.440]  That'll kill even more.
[1:15:16.440 --> 1:15:17.880]  Trump knew all this.
[1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:20.280]  I didn't tell him that.
[1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:23.160]  They just asked, how am I inside their heads?
[1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:24.280]  Well, we're at some pot of co.
[1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:28.040]  And so that's where we are, is I can say the things Trump can't
[1:15:28.040 --> 1:15:29.000]  tell you.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.720]  And that's my job.
[1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:38.200]  And I do say that with extreme pleasure because there's
[1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:41.480]  a big debt to be paid, and I will pay it.
[1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:43.480]  When we come back, I'm going to hit the rest of the story
[1:15:43.480 --> 1:15:45.080]  on how to stop these people.
[1:15:45.080 --> 1:15:55.880]  Stay with us.

[1:17:57.080 --> 1:17:59.560]  10 weeks ago, I began to tell listeners
[1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:01.920]  that they needed to get high-quality, swirable food.
[1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:04.560]  Not because of the virus, but because of the crises
[1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:06.480]  and the economic shutdown.
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:08.160]  It would cause, because the globe was
[1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:11.400]  for planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade
[1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:13.880]  through the blue cities and blue states.
[1:18:13.880 --> 1:18:15.600]  Now, that prediction has come true,
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:18.280]  because the globalists are running an operation.
[1:18:18.280 --> 1:18:20.240]  It's not predictions.
[1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:22.480]  We have their battle plans.
[1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:25.000]  So going back more than eight weeks ago,
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:27.360]  all major swirable food companies were sold out,
[1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:29.040]  except my patriots supply, because they're
[1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:30.800]  the biggest of our preposition.
[1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:33.360]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming
[1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:35.440]  in that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them
[1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:37.680]  in a timely manner, they stopped taking orders
[1:18:37.680 --> 1:18:38.840]  until they got caught back up.
[1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:40.520]  Well, now they're caught back up.
[1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:42.760]  They've got high-quality swirable food in stock,

[1:18:56.760 --> 1:18:59.760]  When one studies history and human nature,
[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:03.640]  you learn very quickly that rugged individualism
[1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:07.800]  and people to think for themselves, build free societies,
[1:19:07.800 --> 1:19:09.280]  innovate to amazing things.
[1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:12.240]  But those that love to grovel,
[1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:14.200]  those that love to be subservient,
[1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:17.560]  those that love to comply and think that it's a virtue,
[1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:21.080]  they create stagnation, corruption, tyranny,
[1:19:21.080 --> 1:19:22.640]  and then finally collapse.
[1:19:23.960 --> 1:19:27.760]  And the world is now being tested.
[1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:29.880]  Remember, seeing lots of dutiful individuals
[1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:33.720]  who've complied and submitted their whole lives believing
[1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:36.560]  if they just submit down a bigger way,
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:38.720]  somehow they'll create a heavenly future.
[1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:43.360]  But the technocrats running the global system
[1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:47.720]  are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic
[1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:49.760]  and are building an anti-human future.
[1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:53.360]  Submission to them is like tying a big boulder
[1:19:53.360 --> 1:20:00.360]  on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:28.360]  Those riders in the sky
[1:20:28.360 --> 1:20:34.360]  An old cowhawk would ride out when dark and windy day
[1:20:34.360 --> 1:20:41.360]  A bonerage he rested as he went along his way
[1:20:41.360 --> 1:20:46.360]  When all it was, some mighty bunch of red-eyed cows he saw
[1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:53.360]  plowing through the ragged sky
[1:20:53.360 --> 1:20:58.360]  Yippee-ki-yay and up a cloudy draw
[1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:04.360]  Yippee-yay, yippee-yay-oh
[1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:10.360]  Those riders, those riders in the sky
[1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:13.360]  And all are in session here right now
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:17.360]  Those riders were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
[1:21:17.360 --> 1:21:20.360]  They had a few tricks up their sleeve, don't they?
[1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:26.360]  Their horns were black and shiny and their heart breath he could feel
[1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:30.360]  A fold of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
[1:21:30.360 --> 1:21:37.360]  He saw the riders coming home
[1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:41.360]  And he heard them mourn for cry
[1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:46.360]  Yippee-yay, yippee-yay-oh
[1:21:46.360 --> 1:21:49.360]  Those riders in the sky
[1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:53.360]  Those riders in the sky
[1:21:53.360 --> 1:21:56.360]  What was their message to the cowhawk?
[1:21:56.360 --> 1:22:00.360]  Their places gone thrice were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
[1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:03.360]  Yippee-yay
[1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:07.360]  They're riding hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:09.360]  Never will
[1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:12.360]  They'll ride forever on that range up in the sky
[1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:19.360]  On horses snorting fire
[1:22:19.360 --> 1:22:23.360]  As they ride on hear the cry
[1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:26.360]  You gotta go find the song, you wanna hear what they actually cried
[1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:29.360]  I didn't mean to play that song, I was listening to it
[1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:32.360]  I wanna go sit out on the back porch somewhere
[1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:35.360]  Drink some beer and just listen to the music like that
[1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:42.360]  This would be so easy to beat and I don't wanna let folks down here
[1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:48.360]  Cause I did a lot of preparation for this show
[1:22:48.360 --> 1:22:56.360]  I look at all this news and there's just an apocalyptic atmosphere to it
[1:22:56.360 --> 1:23:00.360]  There's no other way, like I've been on air an hour and 22 minutes
[1:23:00.360 --> 1:23:03.360]  And I haven't plugged even though if we don't plug we go bankrupt
[1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:06.360]  One time because it's just like the feeling like
[1:23:06.360 --> 1:23:09.360]  Is Colonel Travis the Alamo like sending letters out for help
[1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:11.360]  He's not sending letters out for money
[1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:14.360]  And I think we'll hold on a while longer folks
[1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:16.360]  I wonder if everybody understands something
[1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:20.360]  We're not in the regular season here
[1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:23.360]  This is sudden death over time
[1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:25.360]  Super Bowl
[1:23:25.360 --> 1:23:29.360]  This is everything right now
[1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:32.360]  And I said this just at the start of the show
[1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:36.360]  I'm not choking, I know you're not choking
[1:23:36.360 --> 1:23:41.360]  But the fact that it's all confirmed as bad as we thought and worse
[1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:47.360]  Is a shocking thing
[1:23:47.360 --> 1:23:50.360]  But I'll tell you the goodness
[1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:53.360]  And that's really what I've got for you here today
[1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:56.360]  And I sat here for like an hour before I went on air
[1:23:56.360 --> 1:23:58.360]  I said what do I lead with?
[1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:01.360]  Cause the lead is what people care about what they remember
[1:24:01.360 --> 1:24:05.360]  And is the lead that they're openly trying to
[1:24:05.360 --> 1:24:09.360]  Make me bow to them is the lead that the virus has manmade
[1:24:09.360 --> 1:24:12.360]  Comes out of Wuhan and they admit that now and Fauci's involved
[1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:15.360]  Is the lead that they're creating brown shirt groups
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:18.360]  They're going to go around and forcefully inoculate people
[1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:25.360]  Is the lead
[1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:29.360]  135 million people set to starve to death this year
[1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:31.360]  The UN says
[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:34.360]  Cause of COVID, no, because of the shutdown
[1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:36.360]  What is the number one story?
[1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:38.360]  And you know what, it is that
[1:24:38.360 --> 1:24:41.360]  All other stories are dwarfs, not Alex Jones
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:43.360]  Facing down the barrel of a gun
[1:24:43.360 --> 1:24:47.360]  Not Americans that have been living in a lap of luxury
[1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:49.360]  For decades all spoiled bitching
[1:24:49.360 --> 1:24:51.360]  That you know we might lose our house
[1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:53.360]  Even though it's bad enough
[1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:57.360]  How about your child is begging for food
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:24:59.360]  And the bones are sticking out of their side
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:01.360]  Cause you worked at a farm that delivered food to Europe
[1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:03.360]  Or flowers that were grown for Europe
[1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:05.360]  It's one of the biggest industries
[1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:08.360]  Or you worked at a mine and it's closed now
[1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:10.360]  And there is no food
[1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:12.360]  And when there's no food
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:13.360]  You're at the middle of the town
[1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:16.360]  There's men with machine guns at the food commissary
[1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:19.360]  But they never list your child as starving
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:21.360]  They always die of a cold or a flu
[1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:24.360]  Because they didn't get any food
[1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:26.360]  Those are real people dying
[1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:29.360]  And I just can't sit here with my big screen TV
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:32.360]  And my American muscle car
[1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:35.360]  And my hot wife and my kids and everything else
[1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:37.360]  And oh that's just some Africans
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:39.360]  They pissed me off bringing them into America
[1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:42.360]  And you know, you can get rid of them anyways
[1:25:42.360 --> 1:25:44.360]  That's how the seduction works
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:47.360]  Do I want a bunch of Africans brought in as weapons
[1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:49.360]  And brainwashed and put on the dole
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:51.360]  And talked to vote against me and take my guns?
[1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:52.360]  No, no
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:55.360]  But there are slaves
[1:25:55.360 --> 1:25:57.360]  They're being used against me
[1:25:57.360 --> 1:25:59.360]  I still value them as a person
[1:25:59.360 --> 1:26:03.360]  And I know that we're killing them
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:06.360]  But I'm a slave too, aren't I?
[1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:08.360]  A slave to fear
[1:26:08.360 --> 1:26:11.360]  Unless I say I will not submit to you
[1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:15.360]  And it's that idea, that spark that threatens the globalist
[1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:16.360]  So when we come back
[1:26:16.360 --> 1:26:20.360]  I'm going to load myself up like a guy getting in a can
[1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:24.360]  Or a man putting his head in the tiger's mouth
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:28.360]  And I'm going to do my best
[1:26:28.360 --> 1:26:37.360]  Because we should all be choking right now
[1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:40.360]  We've sat back and allowed evil
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:48.360]  To run completely rampant over everybody
[1:26:48.360 --> 1:26:53.360]  And we thought that somehow it wasn't going to affect us
[1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:56.360]  I knew it wasn't going to affect me
[1:26:56.360 --> 1:26:58.360]  At a subconscious level being a wimp
[1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:00.360]  But consciously, I mean, I knew it
[1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:01.360]  You knew it, we all knew it
[1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:04.360]  But now, man, we're staring into the headlights
[1:27:04.360 --> 1:27:06.360]  Of something that's going to run our ass over
[1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:09.360]  You know what I'm saying is, I know you're tough
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:11.360]  I know most of you aren't scared
[1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:14.360]  You just never had a clear target
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:17.360]  And so now we kind of reach that point of asking
[1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:19.360]  What do we do?
[1:27:19.360 --> 1:27:21.360]  You know, instead of getting up here
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:23.360]  And always telling you what's going on
[1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:25.360]  And what's happening, 99% of the time
[1:27:25.360 --> 1:27:27.360]  And I spent 1% of the time telling you
[1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:32.360]  What I think you ought to do
[1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:35.360]  I love taking your calls to see what you think we ought to do
[1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:39.360]  This is just such a big deal
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:42.360]  It's kind of like reading a manual on heart surgery
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:43.360]  But then you got to do it
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:46.360]  And you got to actually cut somebody open and do it
[1:27:46.360 --> 1:27:48.360]  I know none of us want to do this
[1:27:48.360 --> 1:27:54.360]  But the heart stopped and
[1:27:54.360 --> 1:28:01.360]  It's like the first caesarean they did
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:04.360]  We had the term caesarean from the son of Cleopatra
[1:28:04.360 --> 1:28:07.360]  With Mark Anthony
[1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:09.360]  And the baby wouldn't come out
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:10.360]  And they'd done the surgery before
[1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:11.360]  But it was known as a caesarean
[1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:16.360]  Because it was experimental and it was successful
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:21.360]  Nobody wanted to do a caesarean
[1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:23.360]  But you got to do it
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:26.360]  Or you fold
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:28.360]  Again, I can't take their money
[1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:30.360]  These people are scum
[1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:31.360]  They stink
[1:28:31.360 --> 1:28:33.360]  I can't even be around them
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:34.360]  But that's not enough
[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:38.360]  It's not enough to just not take the money
[1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:41.360]  You got to do the caesarean
[1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:43.360]  You got to do it
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:44.360]  It doesn't mean you got all the answers
[1:28:44.360 --> 1:28:46.360]  It doesn't mean you're even a doctor
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:50.360]  But metaphysically, you got to try
[1:28:50.360 --> 1:28:52.360]  And that's what we're going to do
[1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:56.360]  That's the name of the game
[1:28:56.360 --> 1:28:57.360]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla
[1:28:57.360 --> 1:28:59.360]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:01.360]  When they tried to seize my mother's house
[1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:02.360]  I sued the IRS in one
[1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:04.360]  I beat the IRS then
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:05.360]  And I've been beating them ever since
[1:29:05.360 --> 1:29:07.360]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[1:29:07.360 --> 1:29:09.360]  And I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:11.360]  They thought might never be solved
[1:29:11.360 --> 1:29:12.360]  I can help you too
[1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:13.360]  If you owe taxes you can't pay
[1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:14.360]  Don't wait another day
[1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:16.360]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case
[1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:18.360]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX
[1:29:18.360 --> 1:29:20.360]  Or go to my website

[1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:31.360]  To survive
[1:29:31.360 --> 1:29:32.360]  Forget bunkers
[1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:34.360]  You're not a live underground gopher
[1:29:34.360 --> 1:29:36.360]  You need survivalist camps
[1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:37.360]  The ultimate fully functional

[1:29:52.360 --> 1:29:54.360]  To survivalistcamps.com
[1:29:57.360 --> 1:29:59.360]  The America that we've known and loved
[1:29:59.360 --> 1:30:01.360]  The America that was the land of the free home of the brave
[1:30:01.360 --> 1:30:03.360]  Is dying right now
[1:30:03.360 --> 1:30:05.360]  And everything our enemies are doing
[1:30:05.360 --> 1:30:07.360]  Is about domesticating us
[1:30:07.360 --> 1:30:09.360]  Shutting us down and making us dependent on them
[1:30:09.360 --> 1:30:11.360]  The food shortages have begun
[1:30:11.360 --> 1:30:13.360]  The depression is going to be long
[1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:14.360]  And very, very serious
[1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:16.360]  In fact, it's probably too late now
[1:30:16.360 --> 1:30:17.360]  To even turn back
[1:30:17.360 --> 1:30:18.360]  Trump tried to stop it
[1:30:18.360 --> 1:30:20.360]  But the mainstream media working with the tricoms
[1:30:20.360 --> 1:30:21.360]  Blocked it
[1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:23.360]  That's why you and myself and everybody else
[1:30:23.360 --> 1:30:25.360]  Has to get prepared now
[1:30:25.360 --> 1:30:26.360]  Do not wait
[1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:27.360]  It's not about the virus
[1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:29.360]  It's about the economic chaos
[1:30:29.360 --> 1:30:30.360]  That's going to be unleashed
[1:30:30.360 --> 1:30:31.360]  In the next six months to a year

[1:30:36.360 --> 1:30:38.360]  The food supply is running out
[1:30:38.360 --> 1:30:40.360]  There are major shortages
[1:30:40.360 --> 1:30:42.360]  This is a globalist siege
[1:30:42.360 --> 1:30:43.360]  A globalist lockdown
[1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:45.360]  Globalist terrorism
[1:30:45.360 --> 1:30:47.360]  But we the people, the patriots
[1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:48.360]  Have to be prepared
[1:30:48.360 --> 1:30:49.360]  We've already been proven right
[1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:50.360]  About prepping so far
[1:30:50.360 --> 1:30:52.360]  We'll get ready to be really proven right

[1:30:53.360 --> 1:30:55.360]  At infullwarstore.com
[1:30:56.360 --> 1:30:58.360]  Globalism is all about
[1:30:58.360 --> 1:30:59.360]  Making the nation state
[1:30:59.360 --> 1:31:01.360]  And the population itself
[1:31:01.360 --> 1:31:04.360]  Obsolete, non-essential
[1:31:04.360 --> 1:31:06.360]  That's why they position it
[1:31:06.360 --> 1:31:08.360]  With economic tariffs, taxes
[1:31:08.360 --> 1:31:10.360]  And controls to our family farms
[1:31:10.360 --> 1:31:12.360]  And industry that's based
[1:31:12.360 --> 1:31:13.360]  In the United States
[1:31:13.360 --> 1:31:14.360]  Has to shut down
[1:31:14.360 --> 1:31:17.360]  Or be part of a large corporate conglomerate
[1:31:17.360 --> 1:31:19.360]  That's part of making us obsolete
[1:31:19.360 --> 1:31:22.360]  So that as the human world
[1:31:22.360 --> 1:31:23.360]  Is phased out
[1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:25.360]  They can simply look at us and say
[1:31:25.360 --> 1:31:27.360]  Because again, you are non-essential
[1:31:27.360 --> 1:31:29.360]  That's what the robots
[1:31:29.360 --> 1:31:31.360]  And all of this is about
[1:31:31.360 --> 1:31:32.360]  It's about setting it up
[1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:33.360]  Where we're no longer
[1:31:33.360 --> 1:31:35.360]  In charge of our lives
[1:31:35.360 --> 1:31:37.360]  We can be told to stay on our houses
[1:31:37.360 --> 1:31:39.360]  And after all, shut up
[1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:41.360]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways
[1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:43.360]  It belongs to the new AI gods
[1:31:43.360 --> 1:31:45.360]  The rich elitists that have merged with machines
[1:31:45.360 --> 1:31:48.360]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[1:31:48.360 --> 1:31:50.360]  That's actually the public plan
[1:31:50.360 --> 1:31:51.360]  They're pushing
[1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:54.360]  These people are completely psychotic
[1:31:54.360 --> 1:32:11.360]  And make Hitler look like a choir boy

[1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:26.360]  What does that make me crazy?
[1:33:26.360 --> 1:33:28.360]  What does that make me crazy?
[1:33:28.360 --> 1:33:30.360]  And when you out there without care
[1:33:30.360 --> 1:33:33.360]  Yeah, I was out of time
[1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:38.360]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
[1:33:38.360 --> 1:33:40.360]  I just knew too much
[1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:42.360]  God hates cowards
[1:33:42.360 --> 1:33:44.360]  Does that make me crazy?
[1:33:44.360 --> 1:33:46.360]  And what did von Bismarck say?
[1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:49.360]  God loves children
[1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:52.360]  Drunk in the United States of America
[1:33:52.360 --> 1:33:56.360]  Well, if I represent anything
[1:33:56.360 --> 1:33:59.360]  It's the United States of America and Texas
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:01.360]  I'm a throwback
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:03.360]  The last line of defense
[1:34:03.360 --> 1:34:07.360]  And so are you
[1:34:07.360 --> 1:34:10.360]  But think twice
[1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:14.360]  That's my only advice
[1:34:14.360 --> 1:34:18.360]  To Bill Gates, who do you think you are?
[1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:20.360]  Come on now, who do you
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:23.360]  Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
[1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:25.360]  Ha ha ha
[1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:28.360]  Bless your soul
[1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:31.360]  You really think you're in control?
[1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:33.360]  You're not in control of nothing
[1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:38.360]  Well, I think you're crazy
[1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:41.360]  I think you're crazy
[1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:43.360]  I think you're crazy
[1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:47.360]  I think you're crazy
[1:34:47.360 --> 1:34:49.360]  Just like you
[1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:50.360]  Ha ha ha
[1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:53.360]  And when I was young
[1:34:53.360 --> 1:35:00.360]  My angel had the heart to the light I only live
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:02.360]  And all I remember
[1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:04.360]  I wanna be like them
[1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:05.360]  I wanna be like them
[1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:07.360]  Alright, enough of Norris Barkley
[1:35:07.360 --> 1:35:09.360]  Enough pontificating
[1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:11.360]  Never since I was little
[1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:12.360]  Let me do this
[1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:15.360]  Let me, let me just try to quantify this
[1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:20.360]  Scientific way as best I can
[1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:27.360]  The decision was made
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:32.360]  2,300 years ago in Greece
[1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:39.360]  To establish a order of plutocracy
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:42.360]  That would keep the general public away from knowledge
[1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:44.360]  And empower the establishment
[1:35:44.360 --> 1:35:46.360]  And then everything else you've seen from that
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:47.360]  Has been an extension
[1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:49.360]  And you ask, why do the communists Chinese go along with that
[1:35:49.360 --> 1:35:53.360]  And others, because it's the same mindset of these elitists
[1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:54.360]  They wanna secure their power
[1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:55.360]  They wanna expand it
[1:35:55.360 --> 1:35:58.360]  They wanna block other upstart groups
[1:35:58.360 --> 1:36:00.360]  That would challenge that power
[1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:02.360]  Which then kills innovation
[1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:05.360]  And kills the human spirit
[1:36:05.360 --> 1:36:08.360]  Then, after the Black Plague
[1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:10.360]  500 years ago
[1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:13.360]  Europe loses about 40% of its population
[1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:17.360]  The old corrupt establishments get devastated
[1:36:17.360 --> 1:36:19.360]  Christians, real Christians
[1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:20.360]  Are able to get a hold
[1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:23.360]  And say, we believe in a human future
[1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:25.360]  And a future of the individual
[1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:28.360]  And the first private businesses are established
[1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:30.360]  And the printing press
[1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:34.360]  The Gutenberg Press is...
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:36.360]  Invented
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:39.360]  And from that point, 500 years ago
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:40.360]  Until now
[1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:43.360]  It was an empowering force
[1:36:47.360 --> 1:36:51.360]  But you're seeing the authoritarian attempt
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:53.360]  To take control of that now
[1:36:57.360 --> 1:37:00.360]  And so I wanna be very, very careful here with everybody
[1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:08.360]  If we do not stand up
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:10.360]  For the hundreds of millions of people
[1:37:10.360 --> 1:37:12.360]  That will starve to death
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:15.360]  In the next year to two years
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:17.360]  If we do not stop the lockdown
[1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:20.360]  And just gut up and face what's happened
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:24.360]  And if we allow the design collapse of civilization
[1:37:24.360 --> 1:37:25.360]  The post-industrial world
[1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:28.360]  That the United Nations and the Rockefellers
[1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:31.360]  And Billemotivates admit as their plan
[1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:39.360]  From a selfish perspective
[1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:42.360]  You will be reduced from your hoity-toity
[1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:45.360]  Rich western society to third world
[1:37:45.360 --> 1:37:47.360]  In a kind of purgatory
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:49.360]  While the third world is exterminated
[1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:53.360]  And then you will then move from that middle position
[1:37:53.360 --> 1:37:56.360]  To the starvation position very quickly
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:37:59.360]  This is all part of organizing and glamorizing
[1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:04.360]  Forced inoculations and COVID-19 lockdowns
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:06.360]  And austerity and all, we're all heroes
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:12.360]  But all the math says the opposite
[1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:14.360]  All the models were fake
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:19.360]  50 at the top times off
[1:38:19.360 --> 1:38:21.360]  The bottom 15 times off
[1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:24.360]  They said 5 million dead
[1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:27.360]  2 million dead, all this crap
[1:38:27.360 --> 1:38:29.360]  And again, within that is the paradox
[1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:31.360]  People go, well, wait a minute, Alex
[1:38:31.360 --> 1:38:33.360]  You're saying this is a man-made bio weapon
[1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:35.360]  You're saying it's a chimera
[1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:38.360]  It's a damn chimera because it has to be original
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:40.360]  And new and not organic
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:43.360]  It's a corporate patented alien
[1:38:43.360 --> 1:38:46.360]  Just like everything the first big pharma did
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:49.360]  With the Rockefellers 150 years ago
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:54.360]  Was to
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:57.360]  Take natural botanicals and make them a drug
[1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:00.360]  And then ban the cell of botanicals through apothecaries
[1:39:00.360 --> 1:39:02.360]  They used to call pharmacies, pharmacies
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:04.360]  They were called apothecaries
[1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:08.360]  Everybody knew that plants and stuff worked
[1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:11.360]  So they first synthetic that
[1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:14.360]  And then they ban the original
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:16.360]  That's what a body snatcher does
[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:18.360]  It doesn't just take over
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:20.360]  It gets rid of the original
[1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:22.360]  It gets rid of the bona fide
[1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:24.360]  Because it's the counterfeit
[1:39:27.360 --> 1:39:30.360]  So when we have
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:39.360]  The United Nations
[1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:43.360]  Executive Director of the World Food Program
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:45.360]  Coming out and saying
[1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:48.360]  135 million people are going to starve to death
[1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:51.360]  Because of COVID
[1:39:51.360 --> 1:39:53.360]  It's not COVID
[1:39:53.360 --> 1:39:56.360]  It's the lockdown that's killing real people
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:39:59.360]  So when you've got some virtue signaling hero
[1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:01.360]  Wearing their mask
[1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:03.360]  Even when the governor of Texas and others have said
[1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:05.360]  You don't have to
[1:40:05.360 --> 1:40:07.360]  Virtue signaling to you
[1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:10.360]  That's just getting you ready for the forced inoculation
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:13.360]  And the shutdown is killing
[1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:15.360]  Millions of people as we speak
[1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:17.360]  That's the reality
[1:40:17.360 --> 1:40:20.360]  And if Trump starts talking about that
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:22.360]  And if we start talking about that
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:24.360]  And get back in their face
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:26.360]  Where they're the moral high ground
[1:40:26.360 --> 1:40:28.360]  They're saving everyone and they're these great people
[1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:30.360]  And we go, no, you're the ones doing this
[1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:32.360]  It's game over
[1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:34.360]  Now I've looked at this UM guy and I've studied him
[1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:36.360]  I don't think overall he's a Satanist
[1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:40.360]  Because a really smart Satanist
[1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:43.360]  Would go out and get a well-spoken guy that means well
[1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:47.360]  To raise money
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:50.360]  So he's like, we got 130 million dying
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:51.360]  We need money
[1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:52.360]  Well, okay
[1:40:52.360 --> 1:40:55.360]  Because of the policies your agency put out
[1:40:55.360 --> 1:40:57.360]  That supposedly are boss now
[1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:01.360]  So you make it an issue about this
[1:41:01.360 --> 1:41:03.360]  Not about, oh, give money to the UN
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:05.360]  To then feed starving people
[1:41:05.360 --> 1:41:06.360]  Which they won't even do
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:07.360]  The plans to kill them
[1:41:07.360 --> 1:41:09.360]  You explain it's the UN doing this
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:11.360]  That then always ciphers the money off
[1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:13.360]  And doesn't help people
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:15.360]  That's game over
[1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:17.360]  And I feel a huge responsibility
[1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:18.360]  Ladies and gentlemen
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:20.360]  If there was one African child
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:21.360]  Or one Middle Eastern child
[1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:22.360]  Or one Asian child
[1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:23.360]  Or one Eastern European child
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:25.360]  Or one Latin American child
[1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:27.360]  That I've met and I talked to
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:31.360]  And I said to them, I'm going to try to help you
[1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:34.360]  And then if I didn't deliver to them
[1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:35.360]  My life would be ruined
[1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:39.360]  Well, we have, you have
[1:41:39.360 --> 1:41:40.360]  Millions of children right now
[1:41:40.360 --> 1:41:41.360]  That don't know what's going on
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:44.360]  They know mom and dad's lost the job
[1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:46.360]  They know they're eating bugs
[1:41:46.360 --> 1:41:48.360]  They know mom's down at the river
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:50.360]  Trying to get snails to eat
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:52.360]  They know their sister just died
[1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:53.360]  Their brother just died
[1:41:53.360 --> 1:41:55.360]  They just get skinny, they get sick
[1:41:57.360 --> 1:41:59.360]  And that's how when the global is threatening
[1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:00.360]  To kill me or put me in prison
[1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:05.360]  I'm like, really, you're like
[1:42:05.360 --> 1:42:06.360]  Starving all kids to death
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:07.360]  And I'm like, well, there's too many of them
[1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:09.360]  Then you die first
[1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:11.360]  You know, the day Bill Gates gets up on TV
[1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:13.360]  And he takes a ice pick and just shoves it
[1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:15.360]  Right in his eye and goes, there's too many people
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:18.360]  I'll say, well, I got respect for that guy
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:19.360]  But until then, I don't want
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:21.360]  Wish any harm against Bill Gates
[1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:23.360]  My point is, you want us to die
[1:42:23.360 --> 1:42:26.360]  But you don't ever decide it's you
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:27.360]  That needs to die
[1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:28.360]  Your little pink shirts
[1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:29.360]  You look non-flat threatening
[1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:31.360]  You know, if Hitler wore pink shirts
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:32.360]  He'd have won
[1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:35.360]  And now Zuckerberg wears pink sweaters
[1:42:35.360 --> 1:42:36.360]  It's all just because they know
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:38.360]  Genetically, you're not, you know
[1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:40.360]  Like a black uniform's coming to get you
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:41.360]  It says a little pink shirt
[1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:43.360]  Oh, oh, oh
[1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:45.360]  Oh, I got a shot for you
[1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:46.360]  Oh
[1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:48.360]  I've got a pink shirt
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:50.360]  You can shove that pink shirt up your ass
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:43:12.360]  For a buck
[1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:27.360]  And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people
[1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:29.360]  Will get sick and die from it
[1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:30.360]  So remember, folks
[1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:32.360]  They're coming to hurt you and your family
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:34.360]  And destroy your basic rights
[1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:37.360]  The same left that says to kill babies all day long
[1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:38.360]  Women own their bodies
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:40.360]  Now say you don't own your body
[1:43:40.360 --> 1:43:42.360]  And they're coming to forcibly inoculate you
[1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:43.360]  And if you don't submit
[1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:45.360]  You can't buy or sell or leave your home
[1:43:45.360 --> 1:43:46.360]  Mark the beast
[1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:47.360]  Oh, and guess what?
[1:43:47.360 --> 1:43:50.360]  Jeffrey Epstein and all these people
[1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:51.360]  Hang out together with Bill Gates
[1:43:51.360 --> 1:43:53.360]  Under a bunch of dirty devil worshipers
[1:43:53.360 --> 1:43:54.360]  In your face
[1:43:54.360 --> 1:44:22.360]  They hate you and your family
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:26.360]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo
[1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:29.360]  But it's high quality and aerosolizes it
[1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:30.360]  In a really great way
[1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:31.360]  I like to put it on my hands
[1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:33.360]  Rub a little bit on my face
[1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:35.360]  It's got organic alcohol in it
[1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:36.360]  So spray it right in your eyes
[1:44:36.360 --> 1:44:37.360]  But I just love it
[1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:40.360]  Personally, it has something that's a moisturizer as well
[1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:42.360]  So this is a real innovation
[1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:44.360]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:45.360]  With a hand sanitizer
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:47.360]  That actually has essential oil in it
[1:44:47.360 --> 1:44:48.360]  So it doesn't dry you out
[1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:49.360]  It smells great
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:52.360]  It's so refreshing
[1:44:52.360 --> 1:45:19.360]  This is a big winner
[1:45:19.360 --> 1:45:22.360]  It was I, 12 years ago with Obama
[1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:24.360]  Who serves as well as Fauci
[1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:28.360]  Who transferred the bio weapons to communist China
[1:45:28.360 --> 1:45:31.360]  So we could now release the weapon
[1:45:31.360 --> 1:45:34.360]  But without the loving liberal media
[1:45:34.360 --> 1:45:36.360]  Scaring you in the submission
[1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:38.360]  And the corporate press
[1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:42.360]  Worshiping corporations that shut down all access
[1:45:42.360 --> 1:45:45.360]  As well as blue city governors and peers
[1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:48.360]  We would never have been able to give you the depression
[1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:51.360]  That will destroy the future of the heaven
[1:45:51.360 --> 1:45:53.360]  And starve the third world
[1:45:53.360 --> 1:45:56.360]  Well done, American colleagues
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:46:00.360]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor
[1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:03.360]  But I still need my morning coffee
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:07.360]  And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters
[1:46:07.360 --> 1:46:10.360]  Is stock full of high quality Info Wars store
[1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:12.360]  Patriot blend coffee
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:15.360]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico
[1:46:15.360 --> 1:46:20.360]  The Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee
[1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:24.360]  At the ideal altitude for the perfect cup
[1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:29.360]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity
[1:46:29.360 --> 1:46:33.360]  There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars
[1:46:33.360 --> 1:46:35.360]  So if you love coffee
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:37.360]  And if you want to fight for freedom

[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:39.360]  Then the same incredible terror that's menacing me
[1:47:39.360 --> 1:47:40.360]  Will strike at you

[1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:13.360]  We're coming
[1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:14.360]  Sleep
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:15.360]  The seed is planted
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:17.360]  Sleep
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:18.360]  Terror
[1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:19.360]  Grows
[1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:21.360]  Atlas, it must wake up
[1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:23.360]  Get you when you sleep
[1:48:23.360 --> 1:48:24.360]  Sit up
[1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:27.360]  Invasion of the body snatchers
[1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:30.360]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites
[1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:31.360]  Is it contagious?
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:35.360]  It looks right at me
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:36.360]  You need to get out
[1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:37.360]  You're looking at as if it was human
[1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:38.360]  If I'm not human
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:41.360]  Now
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:43.360]  The classic fear begins to grow
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:45.360]  We're being cornered
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:46.360]  We're being cornered
[1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:49.360]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:51.360]  They're barricading the street
[1:48:52.360 --> 1:48:55.360]  Invasion of the body snatchers
[1:48:55.360 --> 1:48:58.360]  I'm glad I don't go walking dead
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:18.360]  If you are receiving this transmission
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:20.360]  You are the resistance
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:23.360]  It's Alice Jones
[1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:30.360]  You know, I've not been choking out on air
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:35.360]  It's just that 26 plus years on air
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:38.360]  And everything we've done is coming to this point right now
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:39.360]  It's so epic
[1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:42.360]  People overused the term epic
[1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:45.360]  But this is the epic time
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:51.360]  These are the times to try men and women's souls
[1:49:55.360 --> 1:49:56.360]  Wow
[1:50:00.360 --> 1:50:05.360]  Think about the UN World Food Program head
[1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:08.360]  Director of World Food Program
[1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:12.360]  Saying 135 million people are starving to death right now
[1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:15.360]  And we know those numbers are real
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:16.360]  It's like 10 million a year usually
[1:50:16.360 --> 1:50:17.360]  It wasn't going to be 30 million
[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:18.360]  Now it's this
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:22.360]  There's a total shutdown of the entire system
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:25.360]  I have a huge stack of just red line
[1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:28.360]  Insane, crazy
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:30.360]  Your pension funds are gone
[1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:32.360]  I mean, I'm not trying to scare people
[1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:38.360]  But at least you're not going to be dead
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:44.360]  Because they think you have bought into the fear of this virus
[1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:50.360]  So much that they can just carte blanche do whatever they want
[1:51:02.360 --> 1:51:04.360]  These evil people cooked us all up
[1:51:04.360 --> 1:51:06.360]  They even did tabletop exercises
[1:51:06.360 --> 1:51:08.360]  They admitted it all
[1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:11.360]  And if we buy into it and go along with it, we deserve it
[1:51:11.360 --> 1:51:14.360]  I'm not a Stockholm syndrome kind of guy though
[1:51:15.360 --> 1:51:20.360]  And I just want the people doing all this to know that
[1:51:20.360 --> 1:51:22.360]  The tens of millions are starving to death
[1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:25.360]  It's your fault, Bill Gates
[1:51:25.360 --> 1:51:29.360]  It's your fault, YouTube CEO
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:32.360]  It's your fault, Sundar Pachai of Google
[1:51:32.360 --> 1:51:34.360]  It's your fault, Democratic Party
[1:51:34.360 --> 1:51:36.360]  And it's President Trump's fault
[1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:38.360]  If he goes along with it
[1:51:38.360 --> 1:51:41.360]  You know, I was the guy 10 weeks ago that went, hey
[1:51:41.360 --> 1:51:42.360]  This is a big thing in China
[1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:44.360]  They're going to use this to shut things down
[1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:46.360]  They're going to have the Democrats shut things down
[1:51:46.360 --> 1:51:48.360]  They're going to make Trump look like he's behind the curve
[1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:50.360]  By not going along with some of it
[1:51:50.360 --> 1:51:53.360]  He's got to at least say he's worried to take control of it
[1:51:53.360 --> 1:51:56.360]  That didn't mean go the whole panic road
[1:51:56.360 --> 1:51:59.360]  And we were right about that from a Machiavellian view
[1:51:59.360 --> 1:52:00.360]  But maybe we were wrong
[1:52:00.360 --> 1:52:04.360]  Maybe Trump was right up front to just say it's all a hoax
[1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:09.360]  I was wrong, President Trump was right
[1:52:10.360 --> 1:52:13.360]  I had people whisper in my ear and like, oh, we'll play politics
[1:52:13.360 --> 1:52:15.360]  And you know, who knows how really bad it is
[1:52:15.360 --> 1:52:17.360]  And then when, isn't that bad?
[1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:19.360]  Trump will be a hero and I'm like, okay, yeah
[1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:20.360]  And they'll blame Trump for it
[1:52:20.360 --> 1:52:21.360]  Yeah, that's right, exactly
[1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:22.360]  So I don't want to blame anyone
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:24.360]  But you see the trap now
[1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:25.360]  It never ends
[1:52:25.360 --> 1:52:26.360]  It never stops
[1:52:26.360 --> 1:52:28.360]  Newsom says, you can't go to the beach now
[1:52:28.360 --> 1:52:30.360]  How dare you go get sun
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:32.360]  Stay in your house and die
[1:52:38.360 --> 1:52:41.360]  And you know, David Beasley
[1:52:41.360 --> 1:52:44.360]  The World Health Food Program
[1:52:44.360 --> 1:52:46.360]  The director of it
[1:52:46.360 --> 1:52:49.360]  He's up there collecting money for the UN
[1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:50.360]  They'll never deliver
[1:52:50.360 --> 1:52:55.360]  They'll do a few PR stunts with Angelina Jolie
[1:52:55.360 --> 1:52:58.360]  Oh, here, little African child, I'm so nice to you here
[1:52:58.360 --> 1:53:01.360]  Here's your bag of rice starting black baby
[1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:04.360]  When they engineered the whole thing
[1:53:04.360 --> 1:53:06.360]  And admit they want depopulation
[1:53:06.360 --> 1:53:09.360]  And admit that they say that person is subhuman
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:15.360]  And just because they brainwashed black people to hate me
[1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:17.360]  Because I'm trying to like stop this
[1:53:17.360 --> 1:53:19.360]  Doesn't mean I'd like go, okay, well, just go along
[1:53:19.360 --> 1:53:21.360]  Go ahead and kill the black people then
[1:53:21.360 --> 1:53:26.360]  The general public's brainwashed as well
[1:53:26.360 --> 1:53:29.360]  And I don't take any sick solace in this
[1:53:29.360 --> 1:53:34.360]  But I do in that
[1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:35.360]  I don't receive it
[1:53:35.360 --> 1:53:36.360]  I don't accept it
[1:53:36.360 --> 1:53:38.360]  And chortle in it
[1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:40.360]  But, I mean, still
[1:53:40.360 --> 1:53:42.360]  To know something is to do it
[1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:44.360]  You know what I mean?
[1:53:44.360 --> 1:53:46.360]  All you dumbasses that love kissing ass
[1:53:46.360 --> 1:53:48.360]  And love Stockholm syndrome
[1:53:48.360 --> 1:53:53.360]  And love complying your world's over
[1:53:55.360 --> 1:53:58.360]  And I don't take pleasure in all the dead dead
[1:53:58.360 --> 1:54:00.360]  To the starving people
[1:54:00.360 --> 1:54:02.360]  But you're getting what you asked for
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:05.360]  Like those of you that don't care
[1:54:05.360 --> 1:54:08.360]  But oh, you virtue signal all your whole life
[1:54:08.360 --> 1:54:10.360]  And oh, you love brown people so much
[1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:11.360]  And all this crap
[1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:13.360]  When your whole movement's about killing their asses
[1:54:13.360 --> 1:54:15.360]  I can just sit back and go
[1:54:15.360 --> 1:54:17.360]  You're about to get some big old servants
[1:54:17.360 --> 1:54:19.360]  Of what you've been doing
[1:54:19.360 --> 1:54:23.360]  So, you go ahead and kiss your ass goodbye
[1:54:23.360 --> 1:54:24.360]  It's not gonna be Alex Jones
[1:54:24.360 --> 1:54:27.360]  That's coming to kill your ass
[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:29.360]  I don't run around in the middle of people's neighborhoods
[1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:31.360]  Stepping on dog crap
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:34.360]  You're going down by your own decisions
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:37.360]  And you're as dead as they come
[1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:40.360]  So enjoy that
[1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:42.360]  The Christian hedge
[1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:43.360]  What the West built
[1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:45.360]  England, advanced slavery, all the world
[1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:47.360]  All that's been you just threw that aside
[1:54:47.360 --> 1:54:49.360]  For your virtue signaling
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:52.360]  And now you think you're safe in this world you've created
[1:54:52.360 --> 1:54:55.360]  All you've done is destroyed your own atmosphere
[1:54:59.360 --> 1:55:02.360]  So I hope you enjoy yourselves
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:05.360]  Because you're gonna get a big old heaping helping
[1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:09.360]  Your little left
[1:55:11.360 --> 1:55:13.360]  There's too many third world people
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:15.360]  Yeah, tell me you
[1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:17.360]  You're gonna die
[1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:19.360]  How about that
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:23.360]  You killed yourself
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:27.360]  So step up
[1:55:28.360 --> 1:55:30.360]  All you left is there's too many people
[1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:32.360]  Just let your rest today
[1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:34.360]  Take those pills today
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:36.360]  Get out of the way now
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:38.360]  I hope you don't commit suicide
[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:40.360]  But you just keep telling us how we're bad
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:41.360]  Well then
[1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:43.360]  Before all these little kids die
[1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:45.360]  How about you get up there first
[1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:47.360]  You know, the earth can only do so much
[1:55:47.360 --> 1:55:49.360]  Well, walk the plane
[1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:51.360]  Show us how it's done
[1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:53.360]  Show us how the big man dies
[1:55:55.360 --> 1:55:57.360]  Show us Bill Gates
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:55:59.360]  Show us how the big man does it
[1:56:01.360 --> 1:56:03.360]  I respect Bill Gates
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:05.360]  If he like got a 357 magnum on air and said
[1:56:05.360 --> 1:56:07.360]  There's too many people who just blew us that off
[1:56:07.360 --> 1:56:09.360]  But see, I wish no harm
[1:56:09.360 --> 1:56:11.360]  For Bill Gates
[1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:14.360]  For the Easter Bunny
[1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:16.360]  A little joke for the internet
[1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:20.360]  I just don't know what to do
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:22.360]  About something like this
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:24.360]  Where these people want eternal war
[1:56:24.360 --> 1:56:26.360]  And eternal death and eternal corruption
[1:56:28.360 --> 1:56:30.360]  And another Bill, Bill Clinton
[1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:32.360]  Is up there with his youth brigade
[1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:34.360]  He wants to turn loose on us
[1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:36.360]  Let's play a clip of the UN food health ad
[1:56:36.360 --> 1:56:38.360]  Here it is
[1:56:38.360 --> 1:56:41.360]  There are a further 135 million people
[1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:43.360]  Facing crisis levels of hunger
[1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:44.360]  Or worse
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:47.360]  That means 135 million people on earth
[1:56:47.360 --> 1:56:49.360]  Are marching toward the brink
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:51.360]  Of starvation
[1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:54.360]  An additional 130 million people
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:57.360]  Could be pushed to the brink of starvation
[1:56:57.360 --> 1:56:59.360]  By the end of 2020
[1:56:59.360 --> 1:57:03.360]  That's a total of 265 million people
[1:57:03.360 --> 1:57:05.360]  Our analysis shows
[1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:08.360]  That 300,000 people could starve to death
[1:57:08.360 --> 1:57:11.360]  Every single day over a three month period
[1:57:11.360 --> 1:57:13.360]  So that's the name of the whole show today
[1:57:13.360 --> 1:57:15.360]  We're live right now
[1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:17.360]  But 300,000, the UN says
[1:57:17.360 --> 1:57:21.360]  300,000 starving to death
[1:57:21.360 --> 1:57:25.360]  300,000 could starve to death a day
[1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:27.360]  Under COVID lockdown
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:29.360]  But the left's like, well, I mean
[1:57:29.360 --> 1:57:31.360]  There are too many brown people
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:33.360]  You're like, but you're the one
[1:57:33.360 --> 1:57:35.360]  Because they know the average Christian
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:37.360]  Cares about everybody
[1:57:37.360 --> 1:57:38.360]  No matter what color you are
[1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:40.360]  Pink, brown, whatever
[1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:41.360]  They go, oh, do what we say
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:42.360]  Or it'll hurt the brown people
[1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:44.360]  But they're the ones hurting the brown people
[1:57:46.360 --> 1:57:49.360]  As men age, they often experience
[1:57:49.360 --> 1:57:50.360]  A slowdown
[1:57:50.360 --> 1:57:55.360]  In vitality, energy, and overall wellness
[1:57:55.360 --> 1:57:58.360]  And that's why we made one of our most popular
[1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:03.360]  Formulas to date, super male vitality
[1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:06.360]  Specifically designed to assist the body
[1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:08.360]  In regulating proper balance
[1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:12.360]  To create superior vitality in males
[1:58:12.360 --> 1:58:14.360]  Now look, this unique formula
[1:58:14.360 --> 1:58:17.360]  Promotes your body's own natural responses
[1:58:17.360 --> 1:58:20.360]  And it contains no synthetic chemicals
[1:58:20.360 --> 1:58:23.360]  And no unwanted additives
[1:58:23.360 --> 1:58:26.360]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom
[1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:29.360]  Combined with modern technology
[1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:32.360]  Working together in perfect synchronicity
[1:58:32.360 --> 1:58:34.360]  To help you get the most out of this
[1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:36.360]  Urged packed formula
[1:58:36.360 --> 1:58:37.360]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:58:37.360 --> 1:58:39.360]  Go to the InfoWars store
[1:58:39.360 --> 1:58:41.360]  Never been a better time than right now
[1:58:41.360 --> 1:58:46.360]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[1:58:47.360 --> 1:58:49.360]  And all of a sudden
[1:58:49.360 --> 1:58:51.360]  The trap snaps
[1:58:51.360 --> 1:58:53.360]  And you're inside
[1:58:53.360 --> 1:58:55.360]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:58:55.360 --> 1:58:57.360]  Going back to Magna Carta in 1215
[1:58:57.360 --> 1:59:00.360]  Of hard fought, basic human dignity
[1:59:00.360 --> 1:59:01.360]  And liberty
[1:59:01.360 --> 1:59:03.360]  And believing that the individual was sovereign
[1:59:03.360 --> 1:59:06.360]  And had basic, unenable rights
[1:59:06.360 --> 1:59:10.360]  Has been absolutely erased just in March
[1:59:10.360 --> 1:59:13.360]  And the Communist Chinese
[1:59:13.360 --> 1:59:14.360]  Have been our teachers
[1:59:14.360 --> 1:59:17.360]  And big tech has been our controllers
[1:59:17.360 --> 1:59:19.360]  We're all being introduced now
[1:59:19.360 --> 1:59:21.360]  The digital straight jacket
[1:59:21.360 --> 1:59:23.360]  That depends on us complying with it
[1:59:23.360 --> 1:59:25.360]  And depends on us all
[1:59:25.360 --> 1:59:28.360]  Pecking each other into submission
[1:59:28.360 --> 1:59:30.360]  But for all of you out there
[1:59:30.360 --> 1:59:32.360]  That have decided to go along with this
[1:59:32.360 --> 1:59:34.360]  Mark your calendars down
[1:59:34.360 --> 1:59:35.360]  And then in a few months, a few years
[1:59:35.360 --> 1:59:36.360]  Look at the world, remember
[1:59:36.360 --> 1:59:38.360]  You did this
[1:59:38.360 --> 1:59:39.360]  You were the prisoners
[1:59:39.360 --> 1:59:40.360]  You were the slaves
[1:59:40.360 --> 1:59:41.360]  You were the people
[1:59:41.360 --> 1:59:43.360]  That crouched down and licked the hand that fed you
[1:59:43.360 --> 1:59:45.360]  Ask for me, give me liberty
[1:59:45.360 --> 1:59:56.360]  Or give me death
[2:00:06.360 --> 2:00:08.360]  Now, from the beginning of this
[2:00:08.360 --> 2:00:10.360]  11, 12 weeks ago
[2:00:10.360 --> 2:00:13.360]  We do that a lot of the videos out of China were fake
[2:00:13.360 --> 2:00:17.360]  We knew that they were trying to create as much fear as possible
[2:00:17.360 --> 2:00:20.360]  But we also knew that the virus was man-made
[2:00:20.360 --> 2:00:23.360]  And so we had to take it very, very seriously
[2:00:23.360 --> 2:00:25.360]  We now know why it's man-made
[2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:29.360]  That's how Bill Gates, who financed the whole thing
[2:00:29.360 --> 2:00:31.360]  Through sub-companies on record
[2:00:31.360 --> 2:00:34.360]  Can control the rollout of the vaccine
[2:00:34.360 --> 2:00:36.360]  Because you could never have a vaccine
[2:00:36.360 --> 2:00:38.360]  Or a cold virus
[2:00:38.360 --> 2:00:40.360]  Because there's thousands of them in the Corona family
[2:00:40.360 --> 2:00:43.360]  Every year, thousands of different mutations
[2:00:43.360 --> 2:00:46.360]  But if you make an entirely new alien
[2:00:46.360 --> 2:00:48.360]  And that's what it is
[2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:51.360]  It's an artificial chimera
[2:00:51.360 --> 2:00:54.360]  Those were just in fabled Greek legends before
[2:00:54.360 --> 2:00:58.360]  Creatures that were made up of three or more animals
[2:00:58.360 --> 2:01:00.360]  Chimeras
[2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:03.360]  And so it's out there
[2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:06.360]  And I said
[2:01:06.360 --> 2:01:12.360]  11 weeks ago with Dr. Steve Pacinic
[2:01:12.360 --> 2:01:15.360]  That this was already in the population
[2:01:15.360 --> 2:01:17.360]  And that they already knew it
[2:01:17.360 --> 2:01:23.360]  And that a lot of folks had already died from pneumonia-like symptoms
[2:01:23.360 --> 2:01:26.360]  And it's tough, tough virus
[2:01:26.360 --> 2:01:29.360]  But the response to all of it
[2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:32.360]  And the hysteria
[2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:35.360]  I think that this is mass hysteria
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:39.360]  We should calm down and just look at the facts
[2:01:39.360 --> 2:01:42.360]  And if we do, we'll see that
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:45.360]  People under 60 who are infected
[2:01:45.360 --> 2:01:48.360]  Have a death rate of zero
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:02.360]  When you have so-called intelligent people
[2:02:02.360 --> 2:02:05.360]  Treating the utterances of a 16-year-old girl
[2:02:05.360 --> 2:02:07.360]  With biblical truth
[2:02:07.360 --> 2:02:10.360]  As to what the climate's going to do in 60 years' time
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:12.360]  Let alone 100
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:14.360]  And now all this coronavirus stuff
[2:02:14.360 --> 2:02:17.360]  We surely must be in the age of hysteria
[2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:20.360]  And now it was in the New York Times yesterday
[2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:25.360]  That, oh, it turns out it was already in the United States in November
[2:02:25.360 --> 2:02:28.360]  But still, we've all got to stay locked down
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:30.360]  Ladies and gentlemen
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:33.360]  This is the end of civilization as we know it
[2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:38.360]  And a predatory AI globalist robot economy takeover
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:42.360]  This is the equivalent of Pearl Harbor when the Japanese struck
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:48.360]  This is the first official launch of the end of the rest of our lives
[2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:52.360]  Now, remember, I'm the one that laid this out
[2:02:52.360 --> 2:02:55.360]  Absolutely specifically
[2:02:55.360 --> 2:02:57.360]  In the last 26 years
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:00.360]  I'm telling you for 26 years
[2:03:00.360 --> 2:03:05.360]  That Bill Gates is the frontman for the large
[2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:09.360]  Robber Baron fortunes headed up by IBM
[2:03:09.360 --> 2:03:13.360]  That his mother captained
[2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:17.360]  His father ran the World Eugenics Society
[2:03:17.360 --> 2:03:22.360]  After it was made illegal in Europe
[2:03:22.360 --> 2:03:25.360]  And it went underground
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:29.360]  The whole thing
[2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:33.360]  And they believe they are exterminating you to save the earth
[2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:35.360]  And I'll just say something
[2:03:35.360 --> 2:03:38.360]  I'm not going to join Bill Gates
[2:03:38.360 --> 2:03:41.360]  Because it forfeits your soul
[2:03:41.360 --> 2:03:43.360]  But if you go along with this
[2:03:43.360 --> 2:03:45.360]  And if you don't spread the word
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:47.360]  And if you don't stand up for your children and others
[2:03:47.360 --> 2:03:51.360]  You are deserving of what happens to you
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:54.360]  Because if you're going to let these people kill you
[2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:55.360]  And your family
[2:03:55.360 --> 2:03:58.360]  Then you deserve what happens to you
[2:04:05.360 --> 2:04:07.360]  We are back live
[2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:12.360]  And there's a lot of craziness going on today
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:15.360]  We had this guest set up a few weeks ago
[2:04:15.360 --> 2:04:16.360]  And it's an important guest
[2:04:16.360 --> 2:04:18.360]  So I still got him coming up
[2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:20.360]  I'll tell you about who that guest is
[2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:22.360]  When we come back to the next segment
[2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:25.360]  He's busy reading a bunch of documents
[2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:26.360]  Over there in the corner
[2:04:26.360 --> 2:04:28.360]  Before we came back live here
[2:04:28.360 --> 2:04:33.360]  But this is the global takeover
[2:04:33.360 --> 2:04:38.360]  And it's an insane moment to be alive
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:40.360]  But everybody that thinks so far
[2:04:40.360 --> 2:04:42.360]  Your Stockholm syndrome has gotten ahead
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:45.360]  Everybody that thinks the complying has gotten ahead
[2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:47.360]  You're about to get a rude awakening

[2:07:01.720 --> 2:07:07.880]  It is just crazy this time we're all alive in right now.
[2:07:07.880 --> 2:07:13.480]  And you've got Project Veritas out there investigating, getting banned on YouTube in places for showing
[2:07:13.480 --> 2:07:14.640]  the hospitals are empty.
[2:07:14.640 --> 2:07:15.920]  That's now all admitted.
[2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:21.560]  Well now Project Veritas, New York City, funeral home, directors claim COVID-19 deaths inflated.
[2:07:21.560 --> 2:07:23.240]  It's all coming out.
[2:07:23.240 --> 2:07:25.040]  This is the big thrust.
[2:07:25.040 --> 2:07:26.040]  It's the big takeover.
[2:07:26.040 --> 2:07:27.600]  It's the invisible enemy.
[2:07:27.600 --> 2:07:32.440]  The Clintons and Governor Cuomo and Governor Newsom have announced that they're never going
[2:07:32.440 --> 2:07:36.000]  to end the lockdown and that they're going to have brigades of private citizens going
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:39.840]  around policing you and forcibly inoculating you.
[2:07:39.840 --> 2:07:41.680]  Folks, you cannot make this up.
[2:07:41.680 --> 2:07:43.520]  It's all on Band-Aw video.
[2:07:43.520 --> 2:07:48.960]  But going to Mark Pasio right now who's joining us.
[2:07:48.960 --> 2:07:50.440]  Mark, thanks for coming on.
[2:07:50.440 --> 2:07:55.000]  In the time we've got like nine minutes of this segment, what do you call this time we're
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  in?
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:07:57.600]  I see it as a globalist emergence.
[2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:02.400]  They're attempted operation to shove us back into fear and control.
[2:08:02.400 --> 2:08:05.920]  Well Alex, thank you so much for having me back on the show.
[2:08:05.920 --> 2:08:13.320]  I personally refer to the time that we are in as a species as cosmic judgment.
[2:08:13.320 --> 2:08:17.640]  This is what I have referred to it in my work in the past on numerous occasions.
[2:08:17.640 --> 2:08:22.840]  I think humanity is really being judged on a cosmic basis as a species.
[2:08:22.840 --> 2:08:28.360]  My show on what on earth is happening dot com always begins with the concept that we
[2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:30.200]  are at a choice as a people.
[2:08:30.200 --> 2:08:33.160]  This is our critical moment of choice.
[2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:34.160]  And this is it.
[2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:38.880]  This is what that saying at the beginning of what on earth is happening refers to.
[2:08:38.880 --> 2:08:41.160]  And I refer to that as a point of judgment.
[2:08:41.160 --> 2:08:42.160]  I totally agree with you.
[2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:45.520]  We are under total judgment right now.
[2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:48.520]  And you know what's really happening is people are being placed.
[2:08:48.520 --> 2:08:52.400]  It's not that anything is really changing in people, it's that what's happening is what's
[2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:55.320]  inside of people is being revealed.
[2:08:55.320 --> 2:09:01.200]  Their true spiritual nature of what they worked on themselves as a person, how they developed
[2:09:01.200 --> 2:09:05.520]  themselves, how they developed their soul as a human being is actually being revealed.
[2:09:05.520 --> 2:09:07.240]  Everything is being magnified right now.
[2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:10.880]  Like I've got to be honest with you, I've never been super reckless, but now I'm like
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:16.480]  10 times more aggressive and not backing down, I feel my very essence is magnified right
[2:09:16.480 --> 2:09:17.480]  now.
[2:09:17.480 --> 2:09:22.040]  Absolutely, because what is in a person is going to come forward even more.
[2:09:22.040 --> 2:09:26.560]  And if people haven't done that internal work, you're going to be able to see it very much
[2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:32.640]  displayed in the public eye, you know, because we're seeing who is in a deep state of fear
[2:09:32.640 --> 2:09:34.800]  and who is not controlled by fear.
[2:09:34.800 --> 2:09:38.600]  See fear is what they want to generate as the personal state of mind.
[2:09:38.600 --> 2:09:40.560]  That's what this whole Psyop is about.
[2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:43.520]  Not that the virus isn't real, it's an actual disease.
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:47.720]  But the whole point is, is the fear that is being hyped is not warranted because this
[2:09:47.720 --> 2:09:48.720]  isn't...
[2:09:48.720 --> 2:09:53.320]  Exactly, the hysterical heartbeat, the UN admits is going to kill 135 million people
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:55.280]  in the next 16 months.
[2:09:55.280 --> 2:09:57.200]  And it's like, nope, it will all screw them.
[2:09:57.200 --> 2:09:58.400]  I'm wearing my mask.
[2:09:58.400 --> 2:10:01.800]  I'm all, I mean, I went on the hiking bike trail this morning at like 6 a.m. and there'd
[2:10:01.800 --> 2:10:05.400]  be people 30 feet away like jumping to the bushes away from me because I wasn't wearing
[2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:06.400]  a mask.
[2:10:06.400 --> 2:10:10.520]  I mean, it's like, it's all virtue signaling, but you're right, they're worshiping a fear
[2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:11.520]  God.
[2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:13.720]  They're worshiping the fear God.
[2:10:13.720 --> 2:10:14.720]  Without a doubt.
[2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:18.600]  That's what they want to hold people in because people in fear don't make rational decisions
[2:10:18.600 --> 2:10:20.280]  and they're far easier to control.
[2:10:20.280 --> 2:10:24.440]  See, and I look at things from a much more causal relationship.
[2:10:24.440 --> 2:10:28.640]  I try to get down, I think what sets my work apart from others is that I get down, I don't
[2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:32.000]  so much focus on the 3D worldly events as I...
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:36.160]  Exactly, not the latest events, but the larger constructs of why they're doing this.
[2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:37.160]  That's right.
[2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:38.160]  I look at the why.
[2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:40.640]  Why are they doing this now?
[2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:45.400]  Well, what they want to generate is the state of fear to make people more easily controllable,
[2:10:45.400 --> 2:10:48.320]  but there's a causal factor of human fear.
[2:10:48.320 --> 2:10:49.480]  People never look at the why.
[2:10:49.480 --> 2:10:52.400]  They never go down to the causation, okay?
[2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:55.840]  That's what my work is all about, getting down to the why of things.
[2:10:55.840 --> 2:10:59.200]  Why does anyone generally fear anything?
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:03.320]  The root causal factor of any form of fear is ignorance.
[2:11:03.320 --> 2:11:08.400]  We fear as a species, we fear as individuals that which we don't understand.
[2:11:08.400 --> 2:11:11.560]  When you have knowledge, that dispels fear.
[2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:13.800]  It dispels the ignorance and therefore it dispels the fear.
[2:11:13.800 --> 2:11:16.640]  And that's why the occult tries to keep it hidden.
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:17.640]  That's right.
[2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:21.840]  That's what hiding knowledge is all about because if you can keep people ignorant, that
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:26.360]  is the driving causal factor of keeping them in a state of fear, a fearful state of mind
[2:11:26.360 --> 2:11:28.680]  and therefore they become easier to control.
[2:11:28.680 --> 2:11:29.680]  Then what's the result?
[2:11:29.680 --> 2:11:32.560]  What do you get manifested on the other side?
[2:11:32.560 --> 2:11:33.560]  Cowardice.
[2:11:33.560 --> 2:11:34.560]  Cowardice.
[2:11:34.560 --> 2:11:37.440]  And inaction is the result.
[2:11:37.440 --> 2:11:43.040]  And if there's anything that I can 100% agree on what you have said, Alex, it is that God
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:44.540]  hates cowards.
[2:11:44.540 --> 2:11:48.280]  The creator of the universe hates cowardice.
[2:11:48.280 --> 2:11:53.240]  We are here to be bold and brave and to move forward in the face of our fear and to dispel
[2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:57.360]  our fear with knowledge, to dispel our ignorance with knowledge, okay?
[2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:02.160]  And if we don't do that, we are not using the tools that the Creator has gifted us with.
[2:12:02.160 --> 2:12:06.680]  And if I could say that the creator of the universe, I would never usually say that it
[2:12:06.680 --> 2:12:07.680]  hates.
[2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:09.840]  I wouldn't even ascribe that human quality.
[2:12:09.840 --> 2:12:16.280]  But if I could say that it hates any aspect of humanity, it hates cowardice the most.
[2:12:16.280 --> 2:12:18.000]  Well, it's true.
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  God hates cowardice.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:25.360]  So the crazy thing is everyone getting into the cowardice is the ones that get destroyed.
[2:12:25.360 --> 2:12:26.360]  That's how it works.
[2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:36.800]  I mean, it's not so much that people are just inherently ignorant and fearful.
[2:12:36.800 --> 2:12:40.480]  It's that they're buying into this media manipulation.
[2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:45.400]  They actually believe that the mainstream media is telling them anything that resembles
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:47.000]  the truth.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:51.400]  They want to believe that because they don't want to accept the worldview that would have
[2:12:51.400 --> 2:12:55.440]  to be developed on the other side, that this is a deliberate agenda, that it is driven
[2:12:55.440 --> 2:12:56.440]  by lies.
[2:12:56.440 --> 2:13:01.880]  It is driven for, toward harming more people, not toward helping more people.
[2:13:01.880 --> 2:13:06.400]  And what this whole event has really showed me is that the mainstream media has far more
[2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:10.280]  power than we've given it credit for to manipulate people's minds.
[2:13:10.280 --> 2:13:11.280]  Oh, yeah.
[2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:12.280]  They unclogged here.
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:14.040]  They showed us the big dogs.
[2:13:14.040 --> 2:13:15.040]  Sure.
[2:13:15.040 --> 2:13:17.160]  And the freedom movement doesn't want to believe that.
[2:13:17.160 --> 2:13:23.440]  They want to believe that it's being relegated to the realm of dinosaur media and it doesn't
[2:13:23.440 --> 2:13:25.680]  hold the sway that it once did over people.
[2:13:25.680 --> 2:13:26.680]  I don't really agree.
[2:13:26.680 --> 2:13:32.280]  I think that it really has a lot of hold over the human mind and keeping people in this
[2:13:32.280 --> 2:13:33.280]  level of fear.
[2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:37.200]  Somebody that coined dinosaur media, I was simply saying it was the old system.
[2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:41.480]  It would try to take over this system, but I totally agree with you that no, it's more
[2:13:41.480 --> 2:13:46.600]  powerful than ever because the people have become so domesticated.
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:51.480]  And because of the censorship that's being done by the tech giants, that's contributing
[2:13:51.480 --> 2:13:53.520]  hugely into mainstream media.
[2:13:53.520 --> 2:13:54.520]  Let me ask you this.
[2:13:54.520 --> 2:13:58.240]  Instead of kissing Trump's ass, which I know you don't do, I want to believe in the president,
[2:13:58.240 --> 2:14:02.280]  but he's talking about forced inoculations next year.
[2:14:02.280 --> 2:14:05.040]  I mean, what's going on with Trump?
[2:14:05.040 --> 2:14:08.760]  Playing way too much of a political game, obviously, and I never really placed too much
[2:14:08.760 --> 2:14:09.760]  trust in him.
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:14.280]  I kind of sat back on the sidelines, waited to see if he would do anything regarding any
[2:14:14.280 --> 2:14:15.440]  of these losses of freedoms.
[2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:19.760]  I think the only good thing that he has done in his presidency is pointed out that the
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:23.480]  established mainstream media is a joke and fake news.
[2:14:23.480 --> 2:14:27.800]  And other than that, he's gotten really very poor grades in trying to reverse any of the
[2:14:27.800 --> 2:14:31.800]  course of totalitarianism that this country is going down and has been going down for
[2:14:31.800 --> 2:14:35.200]  a long time, as far as I'm concerned.
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:39.640]  And it's unfortunate because I think he was in a position to much more educate people
[2:14:39.640 --> 2:14:44.480]  and help people to understand true rights if he really believed in that.
[2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:49.600]  So I'm personally disappointed, but I never really put too many eggs in that basket personally
[2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:50.600]  to begin with.
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:54.680]  Well, sure, Trump was a manifestation of people wanting to get out of this.
[2:14:54.680 --> 2:14:58.840]  It doesn't mean that he can control everything or do miracles, but no, I hear you, and I'm
[2:14:58.840 --> 2:14:59.840]  watching very closely.
[2:14:59.840 --> 2:15:02.840]  You know, he says, oh, we're going to take on China over this.
[2:15:02.840 --> 2:15:07.200]  But then the other article is, oh, we got a Fauci, he's got an inoculation of 300 million
[2:15:07.200 --> 2:15:08.200]  Americans.
[2:15:08.200 --> 2:15:09.200]  Mark Paseo is our guest.
[2:15:09.200 --> 2:15:11.200]  He's with what on EarthIsHappening.com.
[2:15:11.200 --> 2:15:12.360]  I watch his shows.
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:13.360]  I like his shows.
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:14.360]  I think he's an informative guy.
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:15.360]  I think he's a good guy.
[2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:16.800]  And my wife watches this as well.
[2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:21.600]  We're going to come back with him then and get into the big picture today and where he
[2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:26.160]  thinks this is all going and how people can empower themselves not to be programmed and
[2:15:26.160 --> 2:15:27.160]  controlled.
[2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:30.360]  But this is one hell of a time to be alive right now, folks.
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:33.480]  Anybody that's on the sidelines, you need to know there's no such thing as a sideline
[2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:34.480]  right now.
[2:15:34.480 --> 2:15:36.440]  There are no sidelines in this fight.
[2:15:36.440 --> 2:15:37.600]  This is for all the marbles.
[2:15:37.600 --> 2:15:41.000]  And from my own view, we'll talk to Mark about this when we come back.
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:45.360]  I just see things hitting more intense from here on.
[2:15:45.360 --> 2:15:52.360]  We're right back still.

[2:17:49.000 --> 2:18:02.520]  Now that this U.N. global government shycom billable indicates medical tyranny has seen
[2:18:02.520 --> 2:18:09.000]  how far they can push it now, we just laughed it up like poison.
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:13.600]  You know now they're going to launch more bio attacks than even more hardcore.
[2:18:13.600 --> 2:18:19.040]  This early one does kill people but see it's a virus billable indicates own.
[2:18:19.040 --> 2:18:23.760]  It's a virus that's novel from others so they can give you a vaccine.
[2:18:23.760 --> 2:18:27.840]  See a regular cold or flu virus you really can't do a vaccine for because it's always
[2:18:27.840 --> 2:18:28.840]  mutated.
[2:18:28.840 --> 2:18:35.000]  But see because this is a chimera and lab made they can have a speciality.
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:36.600]  So it's a whole giant franchise.
[2:18:36.600 --> 2:18:38.360]  They get filthy rich off of it.
[2:18:38.360 --> 2:18:40.240]  They can surveil everybody.
[2:18:40.240 --> 2:18:43.560]  Everybody gets to become a suspect and now when you have low numbers of death it doesn't
[2:18:43.560 --> 2:18:47.440]  matter because they make a huge spectacle out of it.
[2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:50.880]  You watch next year with the flu it'll even be bigger as well.
[2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:55.320]  This is what they've done to us because we're a bunch of domesticated idiots.
[2:18:55.320 --> 2:19:00.480]  Hiding in plain view Politico the Associated Press you name it admit that a half a billion
[2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:07.280]  people extra 500 million are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions
[2:19:07.280 --> 2:19:10.040]  already starving because the global lockdown.
[2:19:10.040 --> 2:19:15.160]  That is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19 and
[2:19:15.160 --> 2:19:19.640]  the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the World Health Organization
[2:19:19.640 --> 2:19:24.360]  with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society
[2:19:24.360 --> 2:19:27.000]  created depression and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  This is insane.
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:30.720]  Ladies and gentlemen they succeed it's over.
[2:19:30.720 --> 2:19:34.560]  You need to get prepared now you need to get high quality storeable food now back in stock
[2:19:34.560 --> 2:19:40.840]  at infowarstore.com and you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[2:19:40.840 --> 2:19:44.640]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't
[2:19:44.640 --> 2:19:47.160]  even challenge verbally social distancing.
[2:19:47.160 --> 2:19:51.880]  This is beyond 1984 the tyranny of the dual orders here get prepared now and spread the
[2:19:51.880 --> 2:19:53.080]  word in the info war.
[2:19:53.080 --> 2:19:57.920]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[2:19:57.920 --> 2:20:23.400]  You are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:23.400 --> 2:20:45.800]  The info war success rate got turned up from like a one to about a hundred in the last
[2:20:45.800 --> 2:20:51.360]  few weeks and I don't say that with pleasure they got drones over the office they got the
[2:20:51.360 --> 2:20:56.440]  FBI parked out the parking lot when I'm able to tell you about all this it's incredible
[2:20:56.440 --> 2:21:06.680]  I've had lawyers call today saying don't talk about it yet Jones but it's not just me they're
[2:21:06.680 --> 2:21:17.280]  coming after everybody so people ask well thanks for your courage my courage it's not
[2:21:17.280 --> 2:21:23.040]  courage standing up against this it's survival it isn't some magic thing it's default you
[2:21:23.040 --> 2:21:27.960]  better do it but mark passio you've got a lot of points to make you're smart guy I enjoy
[2:21:27.960 --> 2:21:31.920]  watching your videos you put I wish you put more out sometimes you're sparing it took
[2:21:31.920 --> 2:21:38.320]  a few months off we were missing those but what on earth is happening the name of your
[2:21:38.320 --> 2:21:44.080]  show because Bill Gates is suddenly going okay my vaccines are gonna kill a lot of people
[2:21:44.080 --> 2:21:48.000]  you're gonna take them and they're hiring youth brigades now the democrats have announced
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:52.800]  it folks I'm not joking we just tuned in there's like video Bill Clinton going we're hiring
[2:21:52.800 --> 2:21:57.200]  all the youth to come to your house and make sure you take shots it's like suddenly they
[2:21:57.200 --> 2:22:03.080]  go from preparing it behind the scenes we warn people to the emergencies here and and
[2:22:03.080 --> 2:22:09.360]  and just for me it's like we knew this demon was about to be born it's now here what do
[2:22:09.360 --> 2:22:16.160]  we do well if I could sum up what on earth is happening in a very quick way I would say
[2:22:16.160 --> 2:22:21.080]  that what is happening on this planet is mind control and ultimately slavery and I think
[2:22:21.080 --> 2:22:25.480]  people need to stop euphemizing things and call them what they are you know that's what's
[2:22:25.480 --> 2:22:31.080]  happening on earth humanity is an enslaved species and we are under mind control as a
[2:22:31.080 --> 2:22:36.280]  species and that is you have to have spiritual weakness to go under mind control you know
[2:22:36.280 --> 2:22:42.400]  it's like spirituality true spirituality and truly being anchored in truth is like a shielding
[2:22:42.400 --> 2:22:47.400]  of sorts no I agree what you're saying is true so why does some people have it and some don't
[2:22:47.400 --> 2:22:53.480]  because yeah yeah people want to be delusional courage I mean courage is that shielding it's
[2:22:53.480 --> 2:22:59.600]  that armor you know and and then knowledge taking in knowledge about what is true what
[2:22:59.600 --> 2:23:05.200]  is right what is real dispelling the difference between illusion and reality you know this
[2:23:05.200 --> 2:23:08.640]  these are all themes of my work they are one of the underlying themes of my work is the
[2:23:08.640 --> 2:23:13.800]  difference between that which truly exists in nature in nature and the natural world
[2:23:13.800 --> 2:23:18.960]  versus structural ideas that only exist in the minds of men and women you know that don't
[2:23:18.960 --> 2:23:24.080]  actually exist in nature in point of fact reality and one of the schools so let me ask
[2:23:24.080 --> 2:23:28.000]  you this then yeah what are they doing right now I know it's about enslavement control
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:34.040]  but why are they launching it all now they think they have people's minds where they
[2:23:34.040 --> 2:23:39.720]  need them and I can't disagree with that point I think that they know that they really have
[2:23:39.720 --> 2:23:45.560]  through the forms of media that are embedded all around us and even through the types of
[2:23:45.560 --> 2:23:50.480]  waves that we are continuously bombarded with I think that they think that they have human
[2:23:50.480 --> 2:23:56.760]  thought patterns exactly where they need them to actually seize physical control and the
[2:23:56.760 --> 2:24:01.160]  reason is because of the ignorance that people don't know what true morality is people don't
[2:24:01.160 --> 2:24:05.160]  know what natural law is they don't know what rights are ultimately and if you don't really
[2:24:05.160 --> 2:24:10.160]  know what a right is you can never truly protect it if you can't define something properly
[2:24:10.160 --> 2:24:15.280]  you're not in a position to explain to folks what rights are a right is an action that
[2:24:15.280 --> 2:24:21.320]  does not cause harm to another sentient being and ninety nine point nine nine nine percent
[2:24:21.320 --> 2:24:26.760]  of humanity cannot give that simple definition and get it correct and if you just do a social
[2:24:26.760 --> 2:24:31.480]  experiment ask people if they know the actual definition of a human right they cannot give
[2:24:31.480 --> 2:24:36.080]  that definition accurately and that's the problem yeah rights are human actions that
[2:24:36.080 --> 2:24:41.920]  do not create what you call sin or a violation of somebody else's freedom that's correct
[2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:47.560]  and rights don't change or become suspended in a crisis because the size of rights only
[2:24:47.560 --> 2:24:53.080]  builds higher orders of civilization and higher levels of freedom and that's because the law
[2:24:53.080 --> 2:24:59.120]  of freedom under natural law under God's law the creator of the universe is that as people
[2:24:59.120 --> 2:25:04.220]  in the aggregate in the collective become more moral they in the collective become more
[2:25:04.220 --> 2:25:08.600]  free to talk about your personal path before minutes to break how you got involved the
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:12.800]  things you saw in the occult and what woke you up because that could be a path for others
[2:25:12.800 --> 2:25:16.960]  to get out of that oh yeah that's that's a sort of a long story but I'll try to make
[2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:21.740]  it brief and it's something that very very very few people in humanity have ever really
[2:25:21.740 --> 2:25:26.720]  undergone because the amount of people that ever get truly get involved in any schools
[2:25:26.720 --> 2:25:31.640]  of dark occultism are infinitesimally small these are very small numbers of people who
[2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:36.560]  are truly running things my background is that I became involved at some point because
[2:25:36.560 --> 2:25:42.160]  of disillusionment with religion and disillusionment with the institutions of humanity I became
[2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:47.040]  involved in dark occultism I saw that took you to dark places that's right my search
[2:25:47.040 --> 2:25:52.020]  took me directly into Satanism you know I'll just be honest with people and this is when
[2:25:52.020 --> 2:25:58.200]  I was in my late teen years into my early 20s and I became involved with an organization
[2:25:58.200 --> 2:26:04.080]  called the church of Satan but many other ancillary groups of Satanists not just that that organization
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:10.960]  on the west coast and I saw through direct involvement with dark occult orders and particularly
[2:26:10.960 --> 2:26:18.400]  satanic groups satanic grottoes in my tri-state area that people in high level positions of
[2:26:18.400 --> 2:26:25.040]  power in just about every institution in our society were satanists and were involved in
[2:26:25.040 --> 2:26:29.440]  these types of satanic grottoes by the way Mark I don't I tell these that happened to
[2:26:29.440 --> 2:26:33.280]  me as well I never got actually involved they were trying to constantly get me involved
[2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:39.080]  and I was like 12 13 14 15 and so I saw that as well but that's a blessing because that
[2:26:39.080 --> 2:26:44.480]  was actually a bird's eye view into it it opened my eyes so much that it drove me into
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:51.320]  very very deep study of what was really taking place in this world you know until I actually
[2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:57.480]  saw the types of people that were involved in satanism at the higher levels I probably
[2:26:57.480 --> 2:27:01.200]  would have been one of these sleeping zombies myself and not question things to the level
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:06.160]  that I did so it's it was a blessing in disguise God wants to mysterious ways but that that's
[2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:10.320]  the crazy thing is to see they claim they're empowering they claim it's about human advancement
[2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:15.360]  but really it's just about enslavement see the whole point of me getting involved in
[2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:20.800]  satanism is appeal to the ego it's about taking in hidden knowledge that other people don't
[2:27:20.800 --> 2:27:25.940]  have access to or is suppressed in the population so that you can gain a tactical advantage
[2:27:25.940 --> 2:27:29.680]  over your fellow man or woman in any endeavor you happen to be getting involved with in
[2:27:29.680 --> 2:27:36.120]  your life which is what you have the knowledge they don't right and in my egoic state I
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:41.760]  think in my earlier years that's what drew me into this circle of people and this type
[2:27:41.760 --> 2:27:45.720]  of knowledge and then when I saw that they were really trying to enslave people they
[2:27:45.720 --> 2:27:50.680]  weren't trying to just increase their personal power they were trying to enslave others and
[2:27:50.680 --> 2:27:54.920]  they want to lower their power that's right they want to be God that's what it really
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:28:00.280]  comes down to it comes down to they're trying to usurp the position of the creator as the
[2:28:00.280 --> 2:28:06.400]  law maker in the universe the only law maker in the universe is the creator moral law is
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:11.600]  the only law other than physical law and no one has laws and that's right that's why God
[2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:16.720]  is the sovereign of all creation you know and that's the law maker and what these people
[2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:20.240]  want to do and people in government want to do is they want to usurp the position of
[2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:24.960]  the creator of the universe and they want to become the maker of a law and dictate what
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:30.400]  law is. Wow this is powerful Mark Pagasio what on earth is happening dot com smart guy really

[2:31:54.760 --> 2:32:00.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars can now offer high quality, storable food again.
[2:32:00.400 --> 2:32:05.960]  Other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago, and they told people they had food.
[2:32:05.960 --> 2:32:08.160]  Most folks never would deliver their food.
[2:32:08.160 --> 2:32:14.040]  Well, when our sponsors' food began to run short, they just spent the sales until they
[2:32:14.040 --> 2:32:17.320]  opened more factories and secured more food.
[2:32:17.320 --> 2:32:22.040]  So if you get your orders in right now, they can take new orders and get it to you quickly.
[2:32:22.040 --> 2:32:27.080]  They'll probably have to suspend orders very, very soon again, because the lockdown of the
[2:32:27.080 --> 2:32:32.400]  economy is killing food distribution, farming, you name it, and now it's mainstream news.
[2:32:32.400 --> 2:32:35.840]  The food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen.
[2:32:35.840 --> 2:32:41.960]  If Trump can turn the economy back on and rest control of our system away from the globalist,
[2:32:41.960 --> 2:32:45.400]  things may be okay, but it looks like it's going to get very, very rough.
[2:32:45.400 --> 2:32:49.160]  Well, again, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to secure the number one thing you need.
[2:32:49.160 --> 2:32:52.160]  High quality, storable food ready to get to you and your family now.

[2:33:23.160 --> 2:33:33.200]  It's all over the news, your dogs are watching you, our little friends, our psychic comforters
[2:33:33.200 --> 2:33:40.280]  are now watching us when we train to smell the COVID.
[2:33:40.280 --> 2:33:45.920]  And now parents under CPS investigation for taking children to the bank.
[2:33:45.920 --> 2:33:46.920]  We're all guilty.
[2:33:46.920 --> 2:33:48.420]  We're all suspect.
[2:33:48.420 --> 2:33:56.680]  You can't go to the beach, you could never leave, and the control never ends.
[2:33:56.680 --> 2:34:00.360]  And Bill Gates, captains, the whole thing.
[2:34:00.360 --> 2:34:02.760]  Mark Pascio, I want to get you on more than every six months.
[2:34:02.760 --> 2:34:03.760]  You should come on routinely.
[2:34:03.760 --> 2:34:04.760]  You should host an hour.
[2:34:04.760 --> 2:34:05.760]  We could be one.
[2:34:05.760 --> 2:34:08.120]  But just, I've been asking questions here.
[2:34:08.120 --> 2:34:12.480]  What do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners when our audience is, let's
[2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:15.760]  just say, not just quite large, but very influential?
[2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:21.120]  Well, I'd like to take them through a little bit of a progression that I would consider
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:26.400]  a stepping stone toward spiritual enlightenment, because that's what I really get into in my
[2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:27.400]  work.
[2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:32.720]  You know, I'd like to look at it as a science of spirituality, you know, and it's not religious,
[2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:37.240]  but it is very spiritual, and it's an understanding of what spirituality is all about.
[2:34:37.240 --> 2:34:42.760]  And what spirituality's end goal is, is freedom, true freedom for every individual, not just
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:43.760]  some.
[2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:48.040]  And God's goal is freedom, but they put all these churches and priesthoods in front of
[2:34:48.040 --> 2:34:49.040]  it.
[2:34:49.040 --> 2:34:50.040]  What you talk about is absolutely true.
[2:34:50.040 --> 2:34:51.840]  That's what I've personally experienced.
[2:34:51.840 --> 2:34:52.840]  That's exactly right.
[2:34:52.840 --> 2:34:55.120]  That's what the creator of the universe wants.
[2:34:55.120 --> 2:34:57.360]  That's what the will of creation is freedom.
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:34:59.720]  No middleman, just us and God.
[2:34:59.720 --> 2:35:00.720]  That's right.
[2:35:00.720 --> 2:35:02.360]  Then there are no middleman needed.
[2:35:02.360 --> 2:35:07.240]  Every individual should have a one-to-one connection with that creative power, you know.
[2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:11.680]  And the whole thing we have to understand, if we're going to advance ourselves toward
[2:35:11.680 --> 2:35:15.280]  spiritual enlightenment, is that rights do not change.
[2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:17.760]  Rights don't become suspended in a crisis.
[2:35:17.760 --> 2:35:20.280]  And there is a reason for that.
[2:35:20.280 --> 2:35:24.440]  Rights don't change or become suspended in a crisis because rights don't come from human
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:25.440]  beings.
[2:35:25.440 --> 2:35:29.840]  This is what people, even in the freedom movement, have to stop believing and thinking.
[2:35:29.840 --> 2:35:34.400]  That rights are like somehow granted by human beings to other human beings, no.
[2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:36.440]  Rights don't come from human beings.
[2:35:36.440 --> 2:35:38.640]  Rights come from the creator of the universe.
[2:35:38.640 --> 2:35:41.720]  Our rights are endowed to us by creation itself.
[2:35:41.720 --> 2:35:46.400]  So to interrupt, whenever you're searching things out, different things, Satanism, all
[2:35:46.400 --> 2:35:49.360]  of it, when did you finally find God?
[2:35:49.360 --> 2:35:51.560]  When did you finally figure out it was a lie?
[2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:52.760]  It took years.
[2:35:52.760 --> 2:35:56.880]  It took years for me to come out of that mindset after I left the dark occult.
[2:35:56.880 --> 2:35:57.880]  Years.
[2:35:57.880 --> 2:35:58.880]  Years of deep and perspective.
[2:35:58.880 --> 2:35:59.880]  But it took years to get out of it.
[2:35:59.880 --> 2:36:01.440]  When did you make the turn to get out of it?
[2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:04.920]  Like a cruise ship next time to turn, but when did you make the turn?
[2:36:04.920 --> 2:36:05.920]  What was it?
[2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:12.360]  Late 1990s, when I went through what I would consider a very dark night of my soul and
[2:36:12.360 --> 2:36:18.800]  became extremely depressed, and realized that only through knowledge and the understanding
[2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:24.880]  of the laws of nature, of the laws that God put into place in creation, was I going to
[2:36:24.880 --> 2:36:26.840]  really come out of that dark and take that mindset?
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:27.840]  And exactly.
[2:36:27.840 --> 2:36:30.320]  People say, oh, the founders were occult, or the founders were Christian, or they were
[2:36:30.320 --> 2:36:31.320]  beyond that.
[2:36:31.320 --> 2:36:33.040]  They were the laws of nature.
[2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:34.720]  They really got it.
[2:36:34.720 --> 2:36:38.760]  And that's what's enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, and it was simple deism.
[2:36:38.760 --> 2:36:44.640]  It was the belief in a creator, a higher power, a creative power that basically created all
[2:36:44.640 --> 2:36:51.680]  the laws of the universe, and it also governs behavior because it created the laws of morality.
[2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:53.560]  We are not just bound by the physical laws.
[2:36:53.560 --> 2:36:57.480]  We are bound by spiritual laws, which are the moral laws of creation.
[2:36:57.480 --> 2:37:02.320]  It's what I call referred to in many other philosophers have referred to as natural law.
[2:37:02.320 --> 2:37:07.680]  And those are the consequential laws that are in effect that govern the results, the
[2:37:07.680 --> 2:37:10.480]  consequences of the behaviors that we choose through our free will.
[2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:13.880]  If you don't discipline your children, you're going to get demons.
[2:37:13.880 --> 2:37:19.120]  I mean, if you drink five gallons of whiskey, you're going to die of liver failure.
[2:37:19.120 --> 2:37:20.120]  There's like no laws.
[2:37:20.120 --> 2:37:22.600]  Put your hand over a hot fire.
[2:37:22.600 --> 2:37:27.280]  There's going to be an inevitable, inescapable result.
[2:37:27.280 --> 2:37:29.600]  And the same is true with how we behave.
[2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:33.400]  Through our free will, we are free to choose our behaviors, but we are never insulated
[2:37:33.400 --> 2:37:35.480]  from the consequences of those behaviors.
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:39.000]  They go out into the world, have a ripple effect, and then create the reality that we
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  most have.
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:43.560]  I always call myself a libertarian until I realize those actions create things in the
[2:37:43.560 --> 2:37:46.280]  universe that create a whole other effect.
[2:37:46.280 --> 2:37:47.680]  That's right.
[2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:54.160]  And I think I know that your audience has somewhat of a religious persuasion.
[2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:59.320]  They may be a Christian, and I consider myself not a church Christian, but what I call an
[2:37:59.320 --> 2:38:03.720]  esoteric Christian, and I'm fine with that label even.
[2:38:03.720 --> 2:38:05.480]  I don't even consider it religious.
[2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:08.600]  I think there is, again, a science that underlies spirituality.
[2:38:08.600 --> 2:38:09.880]  There's a science of morality.
[2:38:09.880 --> 2:38:14.720]  I'm actually making a documentary about it called The Science of Natural Law.
[2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:19.160]  If we look at just the biblical allegory of the Garden of Eden, I think it's something
[2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:22.560]  that your listeners would relate to a little bit.
[2:38:22.560 --> 2:38:29.440]  The creator forbids his creation from eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of
[2:38:29.440 --> 2:38:34.280]  good and evil, but many people don't understand what that biblical allegory means.
[2:38:34.280 --> 2:38:41.720]  It means that the knowledge of good and evil actually means the understanding of the difference
[2:38:41.720 --> 2:38:48.280]  between right and wrong, and that the creator of the universe put those laws, put the difference
[2:38:48.280 --> 2:38:51.480]  between right and wrong, into effect in nature.
[2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:56.960]  And what the eating of the fruit of that tree represents is taking that unto oneself.
[2:38:56.960 --> 2:38:59.520]  It doesn't mean physically consuming it.
[2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:05.080]  Allegorically, it means that you are taking that upon yourself and taking that into yourself
[2:39:05.080 --> 2:39:09.720]  in the sense that you are saying that you are the arbiter of it.
[2:39:09.720 --> 2:39:10.720]  That's what the legal...
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:11.720]  Exactly.
[2:39:11.720 --> 2:39:12.920]  No, you're saying, I can judge good and evil.
[2:39:12.920 --> 2:39:14.120]  Only God can do that.
[2:39:14.120 --> 2:39:18.040]  You are now entering into that mode instead of just following God's plan.
[2:39:18.040 --> 2:39:21.520]  You can't say that you are the creator of it.
[2:39:21.520 --> 2:39:25.560]  You can only discover what it is because it already exists in creation.
[2:39:25.560 --> 2:39:30.560]  So the eating of it means you're taking it unto yourself, unto your own power to say,
[2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:35.200]  I am now the arbiter of good and evil, and I can say what good is, and I can say what
[2:39:35.200 --> 2:39:36.200]  evil is.
[2:39:36.200 --> 2:39:37.200]  I can dictate those things.
[2:39:37.200 --> 2:39:38.720]  I can arbitrate those things.
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:41.520]  We are not the creators of the laws of the universe.
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:43.680]  We are not the creators of moral law.
[2:39:43.680 --> 2:39:45.600]  We are not the creators of right and wrong.
[2:39:45.600 --> 2:39:47.120]  We're saying we're God.
[2:39:47.120 --> 2:39:48.120]  That's right.
[2:39:48.120 --> 2:39:49.120]  That's right.
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:52.960]  Instead of being the discoverer of those laws, we are, again, claiming that we are going
[2:39:52.960 --> 2:39:57.560]  to usurp the position of the true lawmaker, the creator of the universe, and become God
[2:39:57.560 --> 2:39:58.560]  ourselves.
[2:39:58.560 --> 2:39:59.560]  And that's what all lawmakers do.
[2:39:59.560 --> 2:40:03.840]  When you actually go under God in the natural law, then you get all the power, everything
[2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:04.840]  opens up.
[2:40:04.840 --> 2:40:07.000]  They keep thinking, saying their God does it.
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  It all just malfunctions.
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:09.720]  I don't know why they don't know that.
[2:40:09.720 --> 2:40:11.400]  Well, they do, Alex.
[2:40:11.400 --> 2:40:12.400]  They understand...
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:17.040]  From my being around them, they do understand natural law, and they reject it so hatefully
[2:40:17.040 --> 2:40:22.120]  because they feel that that is imprisoning themselves because they want to be able to
[2:40:22.120 --> 2:40:23.120]  do anything.
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:24.120]  Exactly.
[2:40:24.120 --> 2:40:25.120]  Like Satan.
[2:40:25.120 --> 2:40:26.120]  They're saying, no, I'm above God.
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:27.120]  Right.
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:28.120]  Exactly.
[2:40:28.120 --> 2:40:29.120]  But it doesn't work.
[2:40:29.120 --> 2:40:30.120]  It isn't God running it.
[2:40:30.120 --> 2:40:36.520]  What they are trying to do is turn natural law upside down and escape the karmic debt consequences
[2:40:36.520 --> 2:40:39.800]  by getting other people to do their dirty work.
[2:40:39.800 --> 2:40:41.560]  Explain that because that's what Bohemian Grove is.
[2:40:41.560 --> 2:40:44.320]  It's a giant ritual to get out of karmic debt.
[2:40:44.320 --> 2:40:45.320]  Yes.
[2:40:45.320 --> 2:40:49.920]  It's a Babylonian absolution ritual and a Carthaginian absolution ritual that comes
[2:40:49.920 --> 2:40:52.360]  down out of ancient Babylon and into Carthage.
[2:40:52.360 --> 2:40:53.360]  Explain that.
[2:40:53.360 --> 2:40:54.360]  Yes.
[2:40:54.360 --> 2:40:58.880]  So this is an absolution ritual to absolve themselves of their wrongdoings before they
[2:40:58.880 --> 2:40:59.880]  even do them.
[2:40:59.880 --> 2:41:05.120]  They are saying, in advance of the wrongdoing we are going to do throughout the duration
[2:41:05.120 --> 2:41:09.240]  of the next year, we are going to perform this ritual called the killing of what we
[2:41:09.240 --> 2:41:12.560]  call dull care, which is our conscience.
[2:41:12.560 --> 2:41:17.880]  By doing this ritualistically, we are going to absolve ourselves of all the wrongdoing
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:21.760]  that we are going to perform over the next solar cycle or the next three hundred and
[2:41:21.760 --> 2:41:22.760]  six months.
[2:41:22.760 --> 2:41:23.760]  And why are they so blind?
[2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:25.920]  Obviously, that doesn't work.
[2:41:25.920 --> 2:41:27.160]  Because they think they're God.
[2:41:27.160 --> 2:41:29.480]  They think they can absolve themselves of their sins.
[2:41:29.480 --> 2:41:31.840]  They think that they can say what right and wrong are.
[2:41:31.840 --> 2:41:33.160]  So they're not just priests.
[2:41:33.160 --> 2:41:35.080]  They believe they're God.
[2:41:35.080 --> 2:41:40.680]  They consider themselves a priest class that itself constitutes being God on earth, ruling
[2:41:40.680 --> 2:41:44.280]  a prison, ruling hell instead of serving in heaven.
[2:41:44.280 --> 2:41:45.280]  Absolutely.
[2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:50.040]  And again, this is, you know, allegorical as far as like, you know, I was there with
[2:41:50.040 --> 2:41:51.040]  them.
[2:41:51.040 --> 2:41:52.040]  They took it deadly serious.
[2:41:52.040 --> 2:41:53.720]  Oh, they did the ritual.
[2:41:53.720 --> 2:41:55.560]  They were shaking.
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:41:59.280]  I'm just trying to say my belief structure is that this is like allegorical.
[2:41:59.280 --> 2:42:02.040]  I do believe in a creator, a higher power.
[2:42:02.040 --> 2:42:03.920]  No, no, I get you're saying it's allegorical.
[2:42:03.920 --> 2:42:04.920]  I get it.
[2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:09.120]  But I'm saying with them, they believe they were committing like this most powerful ritual.
[2:42:09.120 --> 2:42:10.120]  Yes.
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:13.560]  They absolutely believe in their rituals and they believe that those rituals and the carrying
[2:42:13.560 --> 2:42:17.600]  out of them do, does have power in the real world without a doubt.
[2:42:17.600 --> 2:42:21.000]  From all the Satanists that I was around, they firmly believe that in their minds.
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:26.440]  They believe in that power of what they consider magic or ceremonial ritual.
[2:42:26.440 --> 2:42:30.200]  So what we have to understand about their mindset, see, people have to research into
[2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:31.880]  Satan is a much deeper.
[2:42:31.880 --> 2:42:34.120]  They have a Hollywood understanding of it.
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:35.120]  This Hollywood.
[2:42:35.120 --> 2:42:36.120]  You got one more.
[2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:38.120]  Say, but you got to come back tomorrow and you're absolutely right.
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:42.640]  I'm going to pass you as our guest because I know Satanism is another enemy folks and
[2:42:42.640 --> 2:42:43.640]  I'm sorry.
[2:42:43.640 --> 2:42:44.640]  It's real.
[2:42:44.640 --> 2:42:45.640]  They're going to get killed by death.
[2:42:45.640 --> 2:42:54.880]  You know, the grim reaper said by God, killed by death.

[2:43:59.560 --> 2:44:00.560]  I love them.
[2:44:00.560 --> 2:44:02.600]  And they find the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[2:44:02.600 --> 2:44:07.760]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development.
[2:44:07.760 --> 2:44:09.200]  That is amazing.
[2:44:09.200 --> 2:44:16.960]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[2:44:16.960 --> 2:44:19.280]  And there's another innovation.
[2:44:19.280 --> 2:44:21.280]  It's the spray cap.
[2:44:21.280 --> 2:44:25.640]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick gross goo.
[2:44:25.640 --> 2:44:28.840]  But it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:33.360]  I like to put it on my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic alcohol in
[2:44:33.360 --> 2:44:34.360]  it.
[2:44:34.360 --> 2:44:35.360]  So spray it right in your eyes.
[2:44:35.360 --> 2:44:40.120]  But I just love it personally as something that's a moisturizer as well show.
[2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:41.120]  This is a real innovation.
[2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:45.080]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[2:44:45.080 --> 2:44:46.320]  essential oil in it.
[2:44:46.320 --> 2:44:48.920]  So it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[2:44:48.920 --> 2:44:50.840]  It's so refreshing.
[2:44:50.840 --> 2:44:55.640]  This is a big winner.
[2:44:55.640 --> 2:45:00.160]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think even if it ends up
[2:45:00.160 --> 2:45:04.400]  hurting me short term I believe in God and I believe in the long run it'll end up being
[2:45:04.400 --> 2:45:07.400]  better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[2:45:07.400 --> 2:45:11.480]  I understand what comes around goes around you very quickly so and I live that and I
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:14.160]  fundamentally the cellular level understand it.
[2:45:14.160 --> 2:45:18.200]  Now if I would have hyped up the virus was going to kill three four five million people
[2:45:18.200 --> 2:45:22.680]  like the UN did I would have sold five times more supplements but you know what I didn't
[2:45:22.680 --> 2:45:23.680]  do that.
[2:45:23.680 --> 2:45:29.720]  But I said on a routine basis regardless people are vitamin D deficient people are deficient
[2:45:29.720 --> 2:45:34.160]  and I had had so many other issues you need those products regardless.
[2:45:34.160 --> 2:45:38.600]  So we started selling out of vitamin refusion all the other products I cut the prices from
[2:45:38.600 --> 2:45:45.360]  30% off to 60% off because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis to make
[2:45:45.360 --> 2:45:50.560]  sure people were incentivized to up their body's defenses but now I'm telling you with
[2:45:50.560 --> 2:45:55.560]  an economic crisis going on get your storable food now.
[2:45:55.560 --> 2:46:03.400]  Globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete non-essential
[2:46:03.400 --> 2:46:08.920]  that's why they position it with economic tariffs taxes and controls to where family
[2:46:08.920 --> 2:46:14.320]  farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large
[2:46:14.320 --> 2:46:16.040]  corporate conglomerate.
[2:46:16.040 --> 2:46:22.960]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out they can simply
[2:46:22.960 --> 2:46:28.400]  look at us and say because again you are not essential that's what the robots and all of
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:29.880]  this is about.
[2:46:29.880 --> 2:46:34.680]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives we can be told to stay
[2:46:34.680 --> 2:46:39.800]  on our houses and after all shut up this world doesn't belong to people anyways it belongs
[2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:44.560]  to the new AI gods the rich elitists that have merged with machines yeah that sounds
[2:46:44.560 --> 2:46:50.840]  completely insane doesn't it that's actually the public plan they're pushing these people
[2:46:50.840 --> 2:46:58.000]  are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:26.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:26.720 --> 2:47:40.320]  So let me ask you this if satanist got their Valhalla if satan was in full control if he
[2:47:40.320 --> 2:47:47.240]  was god what would you do just like tear humans apart in pieces as a vandalism against god
[2:47:47.240 --> 2:47:51.240]  because we're made by god because I think that's things people need to get is it doesn't
[2:47:51.240 --> 2:47:56.400]  matter how much we serve satan satan hates us because who made us.
[2:47:56.400 --> 2:48:01.000]  So the satanists and dark occultists of our world want the powers of a god that have been
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  attributed to what the creator is and can do meaning know everything control everything
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:16.240]  be anywhere at any place you know and never be able to be dethroned from power and that
[2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:21.400]  is what they are setting up the earth to be a prison that they rule over that people cannot
[2:48:21.400 --> 2:48:28.120]  even see that they are that these dark occultists are in power and that the population is enslaved
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:34.560]  that is ultimately what dark occultism is about creating on the face of the earth and
[2:48:34.560 --> 2:48:40.080]  can't the servants of it see how weak they are like that they're pathetic they believe
[2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:45.080]  they're going to be in a special class of people that you know has more rights than
[2:48:45.080 --> 2:48:49.640]  everyone else and is essentially a ruling class where there's a you know then a slave
[2:48:49.640 --> 2:48:54.240]  class beneath them but they don't understand that they're completely owned and controlled
[2:48:54.240 --> 2:48:59.800]  by the dark force the entropic force within creation the chaotic force which has been
[2:48:59.800 --> 2:49:06.080]  you know traditionally called satan that's what about the state of the gods of satan
[2:49:06.080 --> 2:49:10.440]  god do you know god let this happen well if god has to give us free will all a god could
[2:49:10.440 --> 2:49:15.320]  do was create new potential gods and I'm saying we're all gods of saying the potential of
[2:49:15.320 --> 2:49:19.800]  the universe little g image of god yeah like if I'm gonna have children they might be bad
[2:49:19.800 --> 2:49:24.640]  they might be good but I mean I've got a having them is giving them free will is creating
[2:49:24.640 --> 2:49:30.720]  a new sentient being with free will right we are lowercase c creators and I will consider
[2:49:30.720 --> 2:49:36.080]  that we are co-creators collectively of the human experience and we are given free will
[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:40.880]  to be able to create through our behavior anything and what we have essentially allowed
[2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:45.480]  ourselves to be manipulated into creating is a prison for ourselves that is one of the
[2:49:45.480 --> 2:49:48.880]  saddest things but it's also very true and you've been saying that for years and now
[2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:54.200]  boy is it obvious we are building our own prison sure see what people have to understand
[2:49:54.200 --> 2:49:58.640]  is that the creator of the universe endowed everyone with exactly the same natural rights
[2:49:58.640 --> 2:50:03.800]  no one has been given any more or less rights this is what it means to be equal under natural
[2:50:03.800 --> 2:50:10.280]  law that we're created equal doesn't mean we're equal we're created equal correct doesn't
[2:50:10.280 --> 2:50:14.120]  mean we have the same characteristics or abilities or anything like that it doesn't
[2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:20.360]  mean sameness it means equality in our natural rights no one no individual has any more natural
[2:50:20.360 --> 2:50:25.040]  rights than any other individual we all have the the right to do the same behaviors which
[2:50:25.040 --> 2:50:30.480]  do not cause harm to other sentient beings when we break that we when we when we do behaviors
[2:50:30.480 --> 2:50:35.480]  that are harmful which are murder assault rape theft trespass coercion willfully lying
[2:50:35.480 --> 2:50:39.560]  we are harming others we are we are stealing something from them that isn't our right to
[2:50:39.560 --> 2:50:45.720]  take whether it be their freedom their property their wellness etc okay no one and here's
[2:50:45.720 --> 2:50:50.880]  the other thing people have to understand to truly become more spiritually aware awake
[2:50:50.880 --> 2:50:57.120]  and enlightened you have to understand that no one in the world who doesn't possess individually
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:51:03.760]  the right to perform a particular action inherently can grant or delegate that right to perform
[2:51:03.760 --> 2:51:07.800]  that action upon anyone else see this is what the dark occultists tell people that they
[2:51:07.800 --> 2:51:12.440]  can do you know they say okay an individual doesn't have this right but we can set up
[2:51:12.440 --> 2:51:15.880]  a group of people calling themselves government calling themselves police calling themselves
[2:51:15.880 --> 2:51:20.880]  military and they can perform these behaviors to people or stop them from performing and
[2:51:20.880 --> 2:51:26.600]  now we say that it turns out the clintons are behind a new brown shirt division that
[2:51:26.600 --> 2:51:31.480]  will do forced inoculations in america can you I mean this is their full assault and
[2:51:31.480 --> 2:51:36.200]  they always build the same paradigm over and over again well order followers are always
[2:51:36.200 --> 2:51:41.120]  manipulated into carrying out the wrongful actions that the satanic order givers above
[2:51:41.120 --> 2:51:45.880]  them that are truly their masters want them to do but won't do themselves because they
[2:51:45.880 --> 2:51:50.360]  don't want that part of the evil leader so weak like there was some super bad ass do
[2:51:50.360 --> 2:51:55.000]  with lightning bolts and stuff I could see following them the leaders of evil are like
[2:51:55.000 --> 2:52:00.920]  jokes because modern sorcery doesn't have to do with shooting lightning bolts out of
[2:52:00.920 --> 2:52:05.480]  your hands modern sorcery is all about the manipulation and control of the human mind
[2:52:05.480 --> 2:52:09.560]  this is what people have to understand that satanism really is it's the influence and
[2:52:09.560 --> 2:52:17.000]  control of the mind with with really dark you know mental manipulation they understand
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:21.000]  their ancient psychologists they understand more about how the human mind works than anyone
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:25.800]  else their ancient high level practitioners exactly like bill gates have been doing it
[2:52:25.800 --> 2:52:32.360]  for the last year but now zuckerberg who had been Lee works under him they were pink sweaters
[2:52:32.360 --> 2:52:35.640]  because like you know if hiller wore a pink outfit he would have won world war two it's
[2:52:35.640 --> 2:52:42.360]  like oh i'm wearing pink it's just so obvious and you know they always try to play into
[2:52:42.360 --> 2:52:47.680]  the uh emotional mind control of people they always try to make people think we're looking
[2:52:47.680 --> 2:52:51.640]  out for your best interest we care and nothing could be further from the truth and that's
[2:52:51.640 --> 2:52:56.840]  because they have to manipulate people who would generally want to do the right thing
[2:52:56.840 --> 2:53:01.920]  you know and get them to evil people are manipulating good people to decide on to their mission
[2:53:01.920 --> 2:53:07.040]  yeah and then they're taking on especially the order followers they're taking on their
[2:53:07.040 --> 2:53:12.520]  karmic debt that's how they're going to escape the karmic consequence in according to the
[2:53:12.520 --> 2:53:17.360]  laws of creation the spiritual laws of morality the the people who are really the high level
[2:53:17.360 --> 2:53:22.760]  manipulators they're not going to take on the bulk of the karmic consequence they're
[2:53:22.760 --> 2:53:27.200]  going to who's going to take exactly they want us to be the enforcers they they know
[2:53:27.200 --> 2:53:32.000]  what they're doing that's right that's why they understand how natural law this vaccine
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:37.080]  is going to kill a lot of people he has to tell you that right that's because they understand
[2:53:37.080 --> 2:53:42.000]  how natural law works they understand how free will works and they can't outright really
[2:53:42.000 --> 2:53:47.920]  truly break those laws but they can bend them they can manipulate people into breaking natural
[2:53:47.920 --> 2:53:52.320]  law themselves as individuals and this is what all order followers have always done
[2:53:52.320 --> 2:53:58.320]  since the dawn of human civilization they have actually what do you think he gets though
[2:53:58.320 --> 2:54:07.080]  like his mother ibm all like his dad a eugenicist he wants worldly power and he wants control
[2:54:07.080 --> 2:54:12.040]  physically over other people through whatever the technology they are going to unleash put
[2:54:12.040 --> 2:54:18.640]  in the vaccines control and track through technology and computing and wireless technologies
[2:54:18.640 --> 2:54:24.320]  he wants to be a controller he's a control freak that control freaks ultimately deep
[2:54:24.320 --> 2:54:29.800]  down inside themselves hate themselves because they have no personal power they're weak pathetic
[2:54:29.800 --> 2:54:36.480]  individuals who have no person's personal sense of power in their minds in their hearts
[2:54:36.480 --> 2:54:42.360]  they're not truly loved or can truly love okay they have a weakened sense of the soul
[2:54:42.360 --> 2:54:47.080]  they have a weakened sense of self and of emotions and they're like dead and soulless
[2:54:47.080 --> 2:54:53.760]  husks of of beings to begin with and so what they want is a sense of power and so because
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:54:59.760]  they've been treated wrong or been undergone trauma where they have just felt a sense of
[2:54:59.760 --> 2:55:05.760]  low self worth and just you know just have this sense of self loathing their whole lives
[2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:11.520]  they just want power over other people's people to make themselves feel some sense of power
[2:55:11.520 --> 2:55:15.720]  in their lives because they never had any sense of power all the money in the world never
[2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:22.120]  brought them any sense of self peace of peace of mind of self worth and that's what's going
[2:55:22.120 --> 2:55:26.840]  on deep inside these people psychologically is that they hate themselves so much they
[2:55:26.840 --> 2:55:32.240]  have to transfer all of that and dump it on to other people and try to control them like
[2:55:32.240 --> 2:55:37.040]  a little control freak and because they can't even do that physically because they're weaklings
[2:55:37.040 --> 2:55:40.160]  they want to do that technologically and they want to do that through the manipulation
[2:55:40.160 --> 2:55:44.320]  of the human mind in your research into this satanist you run to Michael Akinos are putting
[2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:49.680]  those articles on screen well of course I had some ancillary affiliations with people
[2:55:49.680 --> 2:55:53.920]  who belong to the temple of set although I never became an official member of that organization
[2:55:53.920 --> 2:55:59.280]  myself I didn't know many people who were involved with it and I tell you right now
[2:55:59.280 --> 2:56:05.000]  a keynote is a sick sick individual who got involved in experimenting how to really torture
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:10.920]  people with electricity the electronic torture was one of his fortes and this guy became a
[2:56:10.920 --> 2:56:16.960]  general in the army you know that's who gets promoted in the armed forces satanist who experiment
[2:56:16.960 --> 2:56:22.120]  with electronic torture and then of course he was implicated in all the traffic of children
[2:56:22.120 --> 2:56:26.320]  in pedophilia scandals through the price city or military base and you know funneling them
[2:56:26.320 --> 2:56:33.920]  into Washington DC he facilitated all of that you know yeah I ran into him once never did
[2:56:33.920 --> 2:56:41.480]  days jail time you know never I ran into him once in really yeah I haven't told that story
[2:56:41.480 --> 2:56:47.920]  yet it wasn't like it was a football game in Dallas in Rock Hall and I remember those
[2:56:47.920 --> 2:56:51.600]  he's really rich people that were there on the stuff that was going on like and they
[2:56:51.600 --> 2:56:55.840]  were all satanist but it was like crazy almost they're like oh here's here's the colonel
[2:56:55.840 --> 2:56:59.280]  you want to meet him I remember it was I put the pictures up at him he's sitting there
[2:56:59.280 --> 2:57:04.160]  with those stupid eyebrows I remember those are ridiculous eyebrows but I sure as hell
[2:57:04.160 --> 2:57:10.880]  yeah if people want to read into what this person's mindset is you know I would highly
[2:57:10.880 --> 2:57:17.240]  recommend downloading his book called the ruby tablet of set the ruby tablet of set if you
[2:57:17.240 --> 2:57:20.880]  could find that online check it out it'll tell you what his ideology is and what he thinks
[2:57:20.880 --> 2:57:25.080]  of human beings see people have to understand satanism isn't what Hollywood has portrayed
[2:57:25.080 --> 2:57:30.360]  it as going out and having rituals in the forest you know you know sacrificing animals
[2:57:30.360 --> 2:57:36.360]  and stuff like that there's some elements of that somewhere deep in it but it is ultimately
[2:57:36.360 --> 2:57:46.000]  a worldview it is a way of let's explain the satanic worldview look the globalist are satanist
[2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:53.680]  are I war's Rothschild recently posed at a gallery of art worshipping the devil and praising
[2:57:53.680 --> 2:57:59.360]  Lucifer you cannot make this up they form it in our face that's what environmentalism
[2:57:59.360 --> 2:58:03.760]  is it's about having an anti-human future and having people live in a subsistence feudal
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:09.200]  surf state that's what they want these people that have stolen the planet or worth trillions
[2:58:09.200 --> 2:58:14.400]  of dollars do not want you having a good life they know you're having fun they know you
[2:58:14.400 --> 2:58:19.680]  have a great wife a great husband great children they hate your guts they are the most horrible
[2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:26.280]  evil people on the planet they openly fund racism war degeneracy pedophilia everything
[2:58:26.280 --> 2:58:31.120]  else imagine the most horrible thing in the universe and then imagine it doubled tripled
[2:58:31.120 --> 2:58:36.960]  quadrupled and being gullible and being domesticated just makes them rise up and attack you harder
[2:58:36.960 --> 2:58:40.440]  and they're the ones that launched this whole attack on the planet and they are the enemy
[2:58:40.440 --> 2:58:50.600]  of humanity and need to be stood up against was only four months ago that I warned president
[2:58:50.600 --> 2:59:10.960]  I would never stand for you resisting archaic there is no limit to which we will not stop
[2:59:10.960 --> 2:59:19.960]  to make you bow via the fear that is in your hearts it was I the leader of Cobra that foresaw
[2:59:19.960 --> 2:59:26.600]  it was important like you were in a war with the real time of Cobra was always the billions
[2:59:26.600 --> 2:59:33.600]  of people at the edge of starvation who were about dying at the tune of over a million
[2:59:33.600 --> 2:59:41.080]  people every three weeks Cobra thanks you for watching time continue the lockdowns while
[2:59:41.080 --> 2:59:51.600]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:59:51.600 --> 3:00:21.160]  a concrete fascination by the way I told that Aquino story not to create some biggest area
[3:00:21.160 --> 3:00:34.280]  I remember it was him one time at a football game in Dallas and that's a whole other story
[3:00:34.280 --> 3:00:44.320]  to tell sometime she's not much the story not much the story but it was him all right
[3:00:44.320 --> 3:00:48.920]  we want to get you back next week Mark Passio you'll come on to get into your journey through
[3:00:48.920 --> 3:00:52.000]  the occult you're awakening what happened what you think is happening next I'm fascinated
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:57.120]  with your work and I should just say you should do more work because I go check your site and
[3:00:57.120 --> 3:01:01.080]  your YouTube's and stuff like that I need more like I'm walking down the bike trail
[3:01:01.080 --> 3:01:07.400]  like one thing every two weeks give me more air so and with my I knew what you were before
[3:01:07.400 --> 3:01:11.200]  Liam McIntyre is a big fan I've followed your stuff I've seen here and there but my wife's
[3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:18.600]  big fan we watch it all just in closing hope how do we turn this around what do you think
[3:01:18.600 --> 3:01:24.080]  we should do right now well I think people really have to study and understand what natural
[3:01:24.080 --> 3:01:29.080]  law is and they could do that first of all by looking at my natural law seminar which
[3:01:29.080 --> 3:01:33.960]  is on my YouTube channel you can get to that on the videos section of what on earth is
[3:01:33.960 --> 3:01:40.160]  happening dot com just go to the videos tab in the natural law seminar is the first three
[3:01:40.160 --> 3:01:45.120]  videos on the video section I would highly recommend that I highly recommend people check
[3:01:45.120 --> 3:01:51.080]  out my podcast which is the audio section and then I transformed it into a video podcast
[3:01:51.080 --> 3:01:57.000]  last year and that has the very deep study of my work it goes very in depth in the audio
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:02:01.760]  and video of the podcast so I would highly recommend people check that out which is also
[3:02:01.760 --> 3:02:07.800]  on the site in the podcast section and I recommend starting from number one don't listen in reverse
[3:02:07.800 --> 3:02:13.840]  order or out of order start my podcast what on earth is happening in order start at number
[3:02:13.840 --> 3:02:21.720]  one that's right it's a very detailed stepwise progression that you're not going to understand
[3:02:21.720 --> 3:02:27.600]  episode 100 unless you've listened to the 99 episodes that preceded so keep it do it
[3:02:27.600 --> 3:02:32.560]  in order at your own pace and I guarantee you a tremendous understanding of what's really
[3:02:32.560 --> 3:02:37.080]  taking place will unfold for you if you want to go deeper into this right they want our
[3:02:37.080 --> 3:02:42.880]  consciousness that's what they want they want our soul that's what it's all about they want
[3:02:42.880 --> 3:02:47.560]  our soul that they want the destruction of the human soul and the more that they get
[3:02:47.560 --> 3:02:53.240]  the more happier and well fed the psychopath what that where do they come from well who
[3:02:53.240 --> 3:03:00.040]  what is this group it's a it's a entropic satanic force that has been with humanity from the
[3:03:00.040 --> 3:03:04.360]  very beginning no I know I mean obviously it's not human I'm saying is where does it
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:11.960]  come from level at some level it's an imbalance it's a you know evolution are we manifesting
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:18.800]  it I would say it's part of the universe evolution needs a a a whetstone it to sharpen itself
[3:03:18.800 --> 3:03:22.720]  against it needs a force to struggle against and that's called the force of entropy and
[3:03:22.720 --> 3:03:29.000]  creation and a lot of people don't understand the opposite of that is centra P S Y N T R
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:35.080]  O P Y centra P that's the evolutionary force that's the force that creates the acceleration
[3:03:35.080 --> 3:03:40.880]  to Godhood that's right more intelligence more complexity higher levels of morality
[3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:45.080]  you don't just get that without a test you have to work for it and that's why it's called
[3:03:45.080 --> 3:03:49.040]  the great work that's why working upon your soul and then helping others to work upon
[3:03:49.040 --> 3:03:53.560]  theirs is referred to as the great work in the positive schools of a cause they'll spend
[3:03:53.560 --> 3:03:59.080]  that like oh that's the mason's no the satanists all steal God's systems and then say that's
[3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:04.280]  that's theirs they can only ever twist things they never really truly create and then Christians
[3:04:04.280 --> 3:04:09.560]  may want to get scared of knowledge because they think oh that's satan satan just said
[3:04:09.560 --> 3:04:15.400]  he owns all that he doesn't of course not the creator of the universe created this as
[3:04:15.400 --> 3:04:20.440]  this place as a learning experience we are here to learn and grow and evolve as as individuals
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:25.680]  and continue on to ever greater forms of evolutionary development that's what the the whole scheme
[3:04:25.680 --> 3:04:31.000]  of creation that the creator put into effect is all about naturally you're absolutely right
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:36.120]  well I've seen it I'm sure you've seen it too mark it's amazing and I want to not talk
[3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:40.080]  about it they have to see it mark passio thank you so much for your time God bless you we

[3:05:11.880 --> 3:05:18.160]  forms of media they're trying to shudder and silence human resistance so now is the time
[3:05:18.160 --> 3:05:21.880]  to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate everything
[3:05:21.880 --> 3:05:26.280]  you warned your friends and family about it's about to be true so it's now that your credibility
[3:05:26.280 --> 3:05:32.240]  is way up the power structure should have silenced those of us that they can't but it's
[3:05:32.240 --> 3:05:39.280]  up to all of us to not let them silence any of us we have the power but the sun is setting
[3:05:39.280 --> 3:05:44.560]  on humanity and setting on free speech we have to make sure that we find hard right

[3:09:36.520 --> 3:09:40.840]  ever gone to a bookstore barnes and noble they'll have the band book and cap and they'll
[3:09:40.840 --> 3:09:47.040]  have books that were dangerous 300 years ago to a king somewhere an emperor somewhere
[3:09:47.040 --> 3:09:52.360]  hated the book it was dangerous to his regime and people go to the band book section and
[3:09:52.360 --> 3:09:57.480]  they feel like they're rebels they're not rebels watching info wars watching the alex
[3:09:57.480 --> 3:10:02.760]  jones show this is the rebellious thing to do this is the program that threatens gods
[3:10:02.760 --> 3:10:09.440]  of the city and that's why my guests today all do that my first guest is a writer an
[3:10:09.440 --> 3:10:16.600]  activist evan floor zack seaman she's the founder of power and her first book is a time
[3:10:16.600 --> 3:10:25.080]  to speak and there is a god of our city there is an idol that the media refuses to topple
[3:10:25.080 --> 3:10:30.560]  and evan floor zack seaman is challenging that idol joe biden evan welcome to the alex
[3:10:30.560 --> 3:10:37.400]  jones show thank you so much for having me jason i'm very excited to be here and i'm
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:45.280]  very excited that alex jones has given us a platform to be heard as women and for some
[3:10:45.280 --> 3:10:53.040]  of us for the first time because women's voices are just not being heard the now organization
[3:10:53.040 --> 3:11:02.160]  does not speak for us anymore and tired of their agenda well the reason i wanted to have
[3:11:02.160 --> 3:11:08.960]  you on there is a woman terah read who has accused joe biden of sexual assault we all
[3:11:08.960 --> 3:11:15.160]  saw that brett cavanaugh was being doxxed and destroyed for allegations that were absurd
[3:11:15.160 --> 3:11:22.720]  on the face of it just a year ago and now we have allegations that seem much more credible
[3:11:22.720 --> 3:11:27.080]  and i'm not one of these people that says believe all women but i think we need to hear all
[3:11:27.080 --> 3:11:33.760]  women and i don't think the mainstream media is doing joe biden a service by burying what
[3:11:33.760 --> 3:11:38.840]  seems to be credible allegations if they're not let's get to the bottom of this why why
[3:11:38.840 --> 3:11:45.360]  is the mainstream media and the abortion industry working double time to undermine the credibility
[3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:51.400]  of terah read and why why why do they refuse to cover the story your organization is to
[3:11:51.400 --> 3:11:57.320]  fight women that's right and that's what we've been called to do to be a voice and be a and
[3:11:57.320 --> 3:12:06.080]  give these women a platform to be heard this woman's reputation has been destroyed by so
[3:12:06.080 --> 3:12:13.840]  many publications out there news media talking about her as if she didn't even have as if
[3:12:13.840 --> 3:12:18.800]  she doesn't have a case yet with the cavanaugh hearings they went back to his high school
[3:12:18.800 --> 3:12:26.400]  yearbook okay they had absolutely no evidence they destroyed this man's reputation this
[3:12:26.400 --> 3:12:33.000]  man was a man of integrity and what we're seeing today jason is the double standard in this
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:41.320]  country and women have had enough it is time for women to take back their power power stands
[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:48.600]  for protectors of women's equal rights and as a hispanic woman who once upon a time voted
[3:12:48.600 --> 3:12:55.360]  on the democratic ticket damn i voted for bill clinton i voted for ross perot i vote for
[3:12:55.360 --> 3:13:03.360]  what's best for this country and if the democratic party thinks that joe biden is the best thing
[3:13:03.360 --> 3:13:09.720]  for this country then god help us all because none of us will ever know the america that
[3:13:09.720 --> 3:13:17.040]  we grew up in this is a coup they are trying to take our country over and it is time for
[3:13:17.040 --> 3:13:24.880]  us to understand that we need to get in front of this war as women and make sure that our
[3:13:24.880 --> 3:13:33.960]  voices are being heard and tara reads boys whether or not she has the information necessary
[3:13:33.960 --> 3:13:40.320]  okay i mean this right here we still have to give her we still have to give her a voice
[3:13:40.320 --> 3:13:45.120]  nobody's even asking you a damn question even if these producers are amazing they're showing
[3:13:45.120 --> 3:13:50.320]  the lead the uh the larry king clip by the way i remember being a student uh just out
[3:13:50.320 --> 3:13:54.600]  of the army watching this larry king episode was taken aback it was such a shocking interview
[3:13:54.600 --> 3:14:01.120]  um this this woman that called in could you imagine if there was some uh call in of of
[3:14:01.120 --> 3:14:07.240]  the cavanaugh's accusers uh mother uh on a radio show in 1982 you literally have this
[3:14:07.240 --> 3:14:13.360]  call in and it's just swept right under the rug isn't it the abortion industry has been
[3:14:13.360 --> 3:14:19.680]  so effective and the mainstream media is making abortion a woman's right to destroy her child
[3:14:19.680 --> 3:14:26.760]  in her womb which no woman wants um really just for the just just so that we're all clear
[3:14:26.760 --> 3:14:32.200]  and what women what the power movement stands for we're here to empower women and the reality
[3:14:32.200 --> 3:14:38.880]  is is that up to this point we haven't had a movement to come forward and fight against
[3:14:38.880 --> 3:14:45.160]  the now organization okay and the time has come now for us as women to make it very clear
[3:14:45.160 --> 3:14:51.280]  to the power and the abortion industry that abortion has nothing to do with women's right
[3:14:51.280 --> 3:14:56.800]  abortion is a billion dollar industry that gives men a get out of jail free card who
[3:14:56.800 --> 3:15:02.160]  don't want to stand up as men of integrity and take responsibility for getting this young
[3:15:02.160 --> 3:15:08.520]  lady pregnant and for taking something that didn't belong to to be get away okay so this

[3:17:57.920 --> 3:18:03.440]  because of the virus but because of the crises in the economic shutdown it would cause because
[3:18:03.440 --> 3:18:07.840]  the globalist were planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade through the blue
[3:18:07.840 --> 3:18:13.200]  cities and blue states now that prediction has come true because the globalist are running
[3:18:13.200 --> 3:18:20.120]  an operation it's not predictions we have their battle plans so going back more than
[3:18:20.120 --> 3:18:24.760]  eight weeks ago all major storeable food companies were sold out except my patriot supply because
[3:18:24.760 --> 3:18:28.800]  they're the biggest more preposition when it got to the point they had so many orders
[3:18:28.800 --> 3:18:33.160]  coming in that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner they stopped taking
[3:18:33.160 --> 3:18:37.000]  orders till they got caught back up well now they're caught back up they got high quality

[3:18:56.680 --> 3:19:00.400]  because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic we've got a limited supply
[3:19:00.400 --> 3:19:03.920]  right now but it's selling out fast and I want those of you that haven't experienced
[3:19:03.920 --> 3:19:08.280]  living defense to get it for yourself here just part of one testimonial I looked in January
[3:19:08.280 --> 3:19:13.000]  2016 I went in a hospital I went to VA hospital out here in Boyce and I was in there until
[3:19:13.000 --> 3:19:18.120]  June and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars
[3:19:18.120 --> 3:19:22.200]  three hours a day and I kept hearing doctor group and all you guys talking about living
[3:19:22.200 --> 3:19:26.800]  defense let me tell you something man I had an internal digestive problem and I stuck
[3:19:26.800 --> 3:19:31.280]  in with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried every time nobody could
[3:19:31.280 --> 3:19:34.880]  figure out what it is and then every day when I kept hearing you and doctor group and those
[3:19:34.880 --> 3:19:38.280]  commercials I said you know what I'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense
[3:19:38.280 --> 3:19:41.360]  now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional because they don't want you to have that stuff
[3:19:41.360 --> 3:19:45.800]  but I ordered it had it shipped to me I got it I hid it from the nurses I started taking
[3:19:45.800 --> 3:19:56.480]  it man that stuff changed my life it saved my life Alex Jones an info war saved my life
[3:19:56.480 --> 3:20:11.680]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:20:11.680 --> 3:20:19.600]  welcome back to hour four I just want to I want to say something no one asked me to
[3:20:19.600 --> 3:20:24.360]  say this but last week when I was trying to book Brad Martin we had Brad Martin on the
[3:20:24.360 --> 3:20:29.600]  show he's the stuntman action director stunt coordinator behind the documentary out of
[3:20:29.600 --> 3:20:36.160]  shadows and there's no more extreme athlete in the world than a stuntman and he is one
[3:20:36.160 --> 3:20:42.280]  of the best stunt men in history and their body is their instrument and if they are
[3:20:42.280 --> 3:20:47.640]  not in top shape their life is on the line so I asked him and what supplements do you
[3:20:47.640 --> 3:20:55.800]  recommend and he sent me back a photo this is no joke of his cabinet and it was filled
[3:20:55.800 --> 3:21:00.000]  with Alex Jones the supplements it was filled with the supplements I've been seeing marketed
[3:21:00.000 --> 3:21:07.400]  on the show I'm not a big supplement guy so I wanted his advice and he sent me back what
[3:21:07.400 --> 3:21:11.480]  Alex was talking about at the beginning of this hour so I look forward to start using
[3:21:11.480 --> 3:21:16.640]  those supplements and the end of the last hour of Alex he had a guest on talking about
[3:21:16.640 --> 3:21:24.720]  natural law and with this Orwellian Brave New World lockdown just when I think they will
[3:21:24.720 --> 3:21:32.200]  never shock me just when I think they've gone as far as they can go Bill de Blasio ups the
[3:21:32.200 --> 3:21:36.560]  game he doubles down he says I can be the dumbest guy in the world I don't care what
[3:21:36.560 --> 3:21:42.720]  your governor does I don't care what your mayor does watch me one up him and this week he
[3:21:42.720 --> 3:21:49.000]  literally sent a tweet out to the Jewish community where he threatened them to send the police
[3:21:49.000 --> 3:21:54.480]  to disrupt their funerals and so I made a FaceTime Live rant about this and as I was
[3:21:54.480 --> 3:22:00.400]  ranting I just started saying you know we've known about the natural law before Christianity
[3:22:00.400 --> 3:22:06.880]  we can go back to Sophocles in his great play Antigone about about this this young girl
[3:22:06.880 --> 3:22:14.200]  whose brother rebelled against her uncle Creon and when he was killed the king Creon said
[3:22:14.200 --> 3:22:19.520]  you cannot bury your brother at her punishment of death all rebels if you bury them you will
[3:22:19.520 --> 3:22:25.400]  be punished with death and then his niece buries her brother and King Creon brings Antigone
[3:22:25.400 --> 3:22:30.920]  before him and says you know didn't you know my law and she said don't you know there's
[3:22:30.920 --> 3:22:37.720]  a law above you there's a law above all kings there's a law even above Zeus and then it
[3:22:37.720 --> 3:22:43.840]  just hit me as I was ranting in this FaceTime Live Bill de Blasio is literally playing the
[3:22:43.840 --> 3:22:51.560]  role of King Creon denying the natural law denying there are any laws above him and if
[3:22:51.560 --> 3:22:58.160]  he thinks this Jewish community is going to kneel to Creon de Blasio he's lost his mind
[3:22:58.160 --> 3:23:03.400]  and one of my favorite writers someone who writes often on natural law is Stephen Harriet
[3:23:03.400 --> 3:23:09.520]  Stephen Harriet welcome to the Alex Jones show thank you very much it's good to be here
[3:23:09.520 --> 3:23:14.840]  so you're a new father so you must be tired you have like a week old baby I've been I've
[3:23:14.840 --> 3:23:18.480]  been sleeping about as much as it's rumored Trump sleeps which is about four hours a night
[3:23:18.480 --> 3:23:23.520]  it's been good one hour tonight wow my my my so well welcome to the Alex Jones show now
[3:23:23.520 --> 3:23:29.360]  what did you think when you saw I mean I really didn't believe it I kind of when I saw someone
[3:23:29.360 --> 3:23:34.040]  post about it I said that is not accurate and then I and then I went and looked at Twitter
[3:23:34.040 --> 3:23:39.640]  and it's very accurate what is your take on de Blasio well it's a real it's it's it's
[3:23:39.640 --> 3:23:43.200]  true like I couldn't believe it at first I thought it was a parody account or something
[3:23:43.200 --> 3:23:47.160]  and immediately what I did is I sent it to my representative I sent it to my mayor and
[3:23:47.160 --> 3:23:50.880]  I sent it to my governor here in Wisconsin and said how are you different from this if
[3:23:50.880 --> 3:23:55.200]  you don't announce it promise not to go further in this direction we Wisconsinites can never
[3:23:55.200 --> 3:23:59.040]  trust you again so that's something that I would encourage all of our audience members
[3:23:59.040 --> 3:24:03.240]  to do just screenshot the tweet send it to him email it to him call them about it how
[3:24:03.240 --> 3:24:07.840]  are you different from this but you're right it's exactly like Creon it's the parallel
[3:24:07.840 --> 3:24:11.760]  is amazing and one of the thoughts that occurs to me is it's great that he's attacking in
[3:24:11.760 --> 3:24:16.800]  a way it's not good but it's kind of convenient that he's attacking the Jewish community right
[3:24:16.800 --> 3:24:24.160]  because yes it's awesome that the Jewish community and we are both inheritors of the same thing
[3:24:24.160 --> 3:24:30.040]  that and take it into it it by the light of reason the natural law as you mentioned and
[3:24:30.040 --> 3:24:34.760]  you know in one of our favorite movies I know you and I both love this movie Jojo Rabbit
[3:24:34.760 --> 3:24:40.120]  it made me so proud personally when this line was spoken by the Jewish character who's being
[3:24:40.120 --> 3:24:46.920]  pursued by the Nazi state against natural law right she says she says there are no weak
[3:24:46.920 --> 3:24:54.560]  Jews I am descended from those who wrestle angels and kill giants we were chosen by God
[3:24:54.560 --> 3:25:00.200]  you were chosen by a pathetic little man with half a mustache and that little man with half
[3:25:00.200 --> 3:25:06.160]  a mustache is de Blasio it is King Creon it's these pathetic rebels against the eternal
[3:25:06.160 --> 3:25:12.240]  law and it's just awesome to be on the side of something immortal just like the Jews like
[3:25:12.240 --> 3:25:19.000]  Antigone yeah but it is it is a mystery isn't it that when you are on the side of the transcendent
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:28.360]  truth all ages war all temporal powers are angered by because they are hemmed in by the
[3:25:28.360 --> 3:25:33.200]  transcendent moral order and I think maybe the reason why traditionally it's been Jewish
[3:25:33.200 --> 3:25:37.440]  and Catholic writers that have appealed to the natural I think especially from the Jewish
[3:25:37.440 --> 3:25:43.640]  community they were outside of political protection or they were a minority and they had to really
[3:25:43.640 --> 3:25:49.680]  understand where can they what could they what do they have to appeal to well yeah after
[3:25:49.680 --> 3:25:55.880]  every trauma trauma political trauma there is a resurgence in natural law theory and after
[3:25:55.880 --> 3:26:00.640]  World War two even though the world the decadent West that it spent two centuries denying the
[3:26:00.640 --> 3:26:06.680]  natural law at Nuremberg they couldn't bring themselves to say natural law so they call
[3:26:06.680 --> 3:26:13.120]  it supra positive law there's a law that is above the posited law by man man made law
[3:26:13.120 --> 3:26:18.120]  even that's right at the very edge of the Holocaust they could barely utter those words
[3:26:18.120 --> 3:26:22.960]  yeah and the great thing about the Jewish heritage is a I love the fact that it's ours
[3:26:22.960 --> 3:26:27.680]  now because we're Christians we inherited the Old Testament right the whole Torah is
[3:26:27.680 --> 3:26:33.560]  incorporated into Christianity so I love that but yes they learned from hard real historical
[3:26:33.560 --> 3:26:38.760]  experience you know in Exodus you right away you have an example of a premiere premiere
[3:26:38.760 --> 3:26:44.600]  example of a creon like the fire of natural law in the Pharaoh right one of the first
[3:26:44.600 --> 3:26:49.520]  things he does when he gets threatened he's feeling threatened by the fact that the Jews
[3:26:49.520 --> 3:26:55.160]  are growing numerous and that they're strong in Egypt is he tries to he orders the Jewish
[3:26:55.160 --> 3:27:01.400]  midwives to commit partial birth abortions on their own people all of the boys he says
[3:27:01.400 --> 3:27:06.440]  if you see the baby coming out you see it's a boy kill it and they defied him because
[3:27:06.440 --> 3:27:11.720]  they knew there was a law above him and the Bible tells us in Exodus God saw that and
[3:27:11.720 --> 3:27:16.800]  was pleased by that and blessed them and they grew all the more numerous and they were rewarded
[3:27:16.800 --> 3:27:20.880]  soon after that of course they were given the natural law in the Ten Commandments because
[3:27:20.880 --> 3:27:25.480]  of course in at least in the Catholic tradition St. Thomas Aquinas as you outline in your
[3:27:25.480 --> 3:27:31.640]  book the race to save our century Aquinas even says that even the Ten Commandments and
[3:27:31.640 --> 3:27:37.680]  all the revelation in the Old and New Testaments actually confirm the natural law and the Old
[3:27:37.680 --> 3:27:43.920]  Testament Ten Commandments is in fact a revolution a revelation based confirmation of what is
[3:27:43.920 --> 3:27:48.280]  actually discernible by our reason which is discerned we know that because in taking
[3:27:48.280 --> 3:27:53.840]  the discerned didn't she before there was revelation for her so yeah I think all people
[3:27:53.840 --> 3:27:59.520]  who have experienced injustice understand they know that it's unjust and so if they
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:04.400]  know that it's they experience it they know it they may not be able to articulate why
[3:28:04.400 --> 3:28:10.160]  but they know they're experiencing injustice my hope yeah and this present brave new world
[3:28:10.160 --> 3:28:16.120]  that we're experiencing it creates a renaissance of of people looking towards the natural law
[3:28:16.120 --> 3:28:23.240]  and demanding that our cons that our legislators our governors and our judges now acknowledge
[3:28:23.240 --> 3:28:28.080]  then the natural on the limits of government we got 30 seconds finish this topic up and
[3:28:28.080 --> 3:28:32.960]  tell people how to follow you yeah I'm just gonna say for all young people you know what
[3:28:32.960 --> 3:28:37.120]  plug into the natural law you gotta just Google it find out about natural law it will make

[3:30:07.400 --> 3:30:12.040]  that and the democrats have now shown their hands with the deep state saying we're going
[3:30:12.040 --> 3:30:16.640]  to listen to Fauci and the world health organization who've done nothing but put out all this
[3:30:16.640 --> 3:30:20.840]  fake disinformation so far we're not going to listen to the president we're not going
[3:30:20.840 --> 3:30:25.880]  to listen to congress but then all these other corporations are going to work in tandem with
[3:30:25.880 --> 3:30:31.800]  big tech to surveil and control and keep things shut down this is economic warfare and I know
[3:30:31.800 --> 3:30:36.960]  everybody understands that public with the president and others need to develop a plan
[3:30:36.960 --> 3:30:42.840]  to understand that this is a global corporate civil war and that we're being held hostage
[3:30:42.840 --> 3:30:49.400]  and this is a mutiny against our country by globalist forces only understanding the reality
[3:30:49.400 --> 3:30:54.160]  of the magnitude of that gives us any chance of defeating it how do you put a people under
[3:30:54.160 --> 3:30:58.600]  house arrest how do you put them under siege well you tell them you're protecting them
[3:30:58.600 --> 3:31:04.080]  from a virus that you yourself cooked up with the globalist deep state and then had china
[3:31:04.080 --> 3:31:09.800]  release to then take down the populace president and those pesky american people that have become
[3:31:09.800 --> 3:31:15.400]  too uppity bill mahr even admitted man i hope we have a depression now they've tailored
[3:31:15.400 --> 3:31:21.200]  the whole thing with the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country
[3:31:21.200 --> 3:31:26.040]  closed along with the help of the blue states and blue states all the time blaming trump
[3:31:26.040 --> 3:31:32.160]  and capitalism and americanism for the depression it creates if america is that stupid we deserve
[3:31:32.160 --> 3:31:37.280]  what happens to us but as for me i'm not sitting here and i'm not taking it it's all the nanny
[3:31:37.280 --> 3:31:41.520]  state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keep everybody safe but that's
[3:31:41.520 --> 3:31:47.600]  not what they're doing they are pulling america up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our
[3:31:47.600 --> 3:31:51.840]  savings our health our whole world and committing millions of third world people to death

[3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:32.480]  and it really is hard to believe in our age in our time we're we're battling bloodthirsty
[3:33:32.480 --> 3:33:38.320]  monsters in my home state we have an unemployment at a state of why higher than the great depression
[3:33:38.320 --> 3:33:45.000]  our media refuses to cover it our politicians refuse to talk about it they are months behind
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:49.800]  on unemployment payments they're young single mothers with children multiple children the
[3:33:49.800 --> 3:33:54.320]  schools are closed they don't have money the food banks are strained and while this is
[3:33:54.320 --> 3:34:00.320]  all happening as entrepreneurs are scraping and clawing to keep their businesses afloat
[3:34:00.320 --> 3:34:06.640]  as the rest of the world the horn of africa and india are approaching biblical a biblical
[3:34:06.640 --> 3:34:12.960]  crisis a biblical famine as the new york times reported the abortion industry in the united
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:20.480]  states continues to push to make they don't want legal abortion they want legal back
[3:34:20.480 --> 3:34:26.360]  alley abortions they want to make as much money as possible with no government interference
[3:34:26.360 --> 3:34:30.280]  and nobody is standing in the well not a lot of people are standing in their way but my
[3:34:30.280 --> 3:34:37.600]  next guest to reset the cognac is a force to be reckoned with she's a pro life activist
[3:34:37.600 --> 3:34:44.440]  vegan feminist from san francisco and welcome to the alice john show thank you it's a pleasure
[3:34:44.440 --> 3:34:51.560]  to be here so what you have to report to me and to the audience it's a bit unbelievable
[3:34:51.560 --> 3:34:56.240]  in this country already you can get the quote unquote morning after pill which is a chemical
[3:34:56.240 --> 3:35:04.920]  abortion in the very early stages of pregnancy george bush's director of the fda van andrew
[3:35:04.920 --> 3:35:10.680]  van boschen van boschenbach andrew van boschenbach it made that available over the counter
[3:35:10.680 --> 3:35:15.640]  we have men slipping the morning after pill into their girlfriends smoothies it's happening
[3:35:15.640 --> 3:35:20.320]  all over the country they're being convicted but that is not enough there are chemical
[3:35:20.320 --> 3:35:29.600]  abortions with the dangerous drug made in china by the way r u 486 and there are reports
[3:35:29.600 --> 3:35:34.840]  now that the abortion industry is using this crisis as cover to make the dangerous later
[3:35:34.840 --> 3:35:46.280]  term chemical abortions are you 46 available without a doctor that is correct as we know
[3:35:46.280 --> 3:35:51.840]  the abortion industry has historically had two primary goals one is population control
[3:35:51.840 --> 3:36:00.760]  and one is to make money and the expansion of r u 486 the abortion pill not to be confused
[3:36:00.760 --> 3:36:07.720]  with the plan b which is a contraception r u 486 the development of that drug helps accomplish
[3:36:07.720 --> 3:36:15.040]  both of those goals it allows the abortion industry to make more money and to expand
[3:36:15.040 --> 3:36:23.800]  abortion access so that they can commit more and more abortions and as you mentioned the
[3:36:23.800 --> 3:36:30.480]  abortion industry has been working for years to try to make r u 486 more accessible than
[3:36:30.480 --> 3:36:37.080]  it is today now it is accessible through any abortion facility but the fda does require
[3:36:37.080 --> 3:36:44.600]  that you must go to an abortion facility in order to confirm a pregnancy to have an ultrasound
[3:36:44.600 --> 3:36:52.640]  and then the drug is administered there now the abortion industry filed a lawsuit in in
[3:36:52.640 --> 3:37:01.880]  hawaii in 2017 trying to get the fda to remove these these guidelines so that they can simply
[3:37:01.880 --> 3:37:09.360]  allow the r u 46 to be prescribed for example at a pharmacy but now with the new age of
[3:37:09.360 --> 3:37:16.960]  telemedicine and with the threat of co vid the abortion industry and in particular genuity
[3:37:16.960 --> 3:37:22.040]  some clinical trials that are occurring throughout the country right now their goal is to make
[3:37:22.040 --> 3:37:30.960]  abortion available by mail through simply a tele conversation with a supposed pregnant
[3:37:30.960 --> 3:37:39.280]  person and to expand abortion into basically every home in the world and turn every u p
[3:37:39.280 --> 3:37:45.400]  s driver into an abortion provider and literally every doctor's office in america an abortion
[3:37:45.400 --> 3:37:50.400]  provider you know it's really heartbreaking about that and that hawaii again is at the
[3:37:50.400 --> 3:37:54.880]  tip of the spear of of waging war against the inviolable dignity of the child in the
[3:37:54.880 --> 3:38:00.200]  womb is early on with the release of the abortion pill we had a young girl in hawaii
[3:38:00.200 --> 3:38:05.440]  her her parents walked in she had hemorrhaged and bled to death they found their daughter
[3:38:05.440 --> 3:38:11.000]  a young teenager in a puddle of her own blood dead they never even knew she had taken r u
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:16.680]  486 this is a very brutal drug and that powerful film that i know you saw unplanned the story
[3:38:16.680 --> 3:38:22.560]  of abby johnson going from planned parented employee of the year to pro-life leader they
[3:38:22.560 --> 3:38:27.640]  they depict in that film a chemical abortion and it really is an r u 46 abortion and it's
[3:38:27.640 --> 3:38:33.720]  really brutal i have friends who've had surgical abortions and they've had r u 46 abortions
[3:38:33.720 --> 3:38:40.480]  and they say the r u 486 abortion was exponentially more traumatic and and we have these suicides
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:47.880]  and a newscaster in australia it is said she committed suicide following her r u 486 abortion
[3:38:47.880 --> 3:38:52.440]  oftentimes you'll see the contents of their pregnancy in their toilet so this is a brutal
[3:38:52.440 --> 3:38:58.080]  experience and they're pushing to have these women have this experience with no real can
[3:38:58.080 --> 3:39:04.880]  human connection with no one communicating what they need to be prepared for yeah that's
[3:39:04.880 --> 3:39:14.360]  correct i think that we have to be very careful about about what we're going to remove guidelines
[3:39:14.360 --> 3:39:22.320]  for in terms of from the FDA's perspective we know that the importance of being able
[3:39:22.320 --> 3:39:28.400]  to confirm a pregnancy exists in the first place is absolutely crucial before you ingest
[3:39:28.400 --> 3:39:36.720]  r u 46 being able to properly date the pregnancy ensuring that there is no ectopic pregnancy
[3:39:36.720 --> 3:39:44.400]  and to prevent abusers like you mentioned from being able to access on these truly life-ending
[3:39:44.400 --> 3:39:50.840]  drugs for the unborn members of our community so when we're talking about when the abortion
[3:39:50.840 --> 3:39:57.240]  industry tells us that they're here to support women and yet they're asking the FDA to remove
[3:39:57.240 --> 3:40:04.640]  safeguards that would ensure that women are not dying from r u 46 or at least minimizing
[3:40:04.640 --> 3:40:10.720]  that possibility then we know for sure that their interests do not lie with the welfare
[3:40:10.720 --> 3:40:16.680]  of the community or or the health of women this is about this is about making money and
[3:40:16.680 --> 3:40:26.320]  even deeper than that we know that these ties to the development of r u 46 to the the clinic
[3:40:26.320 --> 3:40:34.000]  clinical trials that attempt to expand tele abortion that all of that is working in concert
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:39.160]  to expand abortion for population control and for financial gain
[3:40:39.160 --> 3:40:44.840]  Theresa you are an activist you're very progressive I think you and I would be on opposite sides
[3:40:44.840 --> 3:40:50.720]  of most most issues but this issue seems to be something that all people of goodwill
[3:40:50.720 --> 3:40:58.200]  would agree on that women should not take dangerous later later pregnancy chemical abortions
[3:40:58.200 --> 3:41:04.160]  without very intense medical supervision that I'm pro-life your pro-life but even people
[3:41:04.160 --> 3:41:10.120]  who are not do you see as you're in San Francisco with San Francisco pro-life do you do you
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:15.800]  see people waking up to the brutality and of the abortion industry and that they're
[3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:23.440]  just driven by profit yes we we they knew activists all the time there are people that
[3:41:23.440 --> 3:41:27.800]  come to us from all walks of life that are just you know maybe just having some concerns
[3:41:27.800 --> 3:41:35.520]  about elective late term abortion or having concerns about early term abortion and this
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:42.680]  just even breaking into that mentality a little bit just being able to access you know people
[3:41:42.680 --> 3:41:47.120]  from throughout the community that have various views on abortion once they start discussing
[3:41:47.120 --> 3:41:54.040]  these issues and especially because San Francisco is such an anti-capitalist community there's
[3:41:54.040 --> 3:42:04.160]  so much animosity towards you know the wealthy elites that you know control the governments
[3:42:04.160 --> 3:42:11.480]  and that you know are oppressing people so when when they do when they are confronted
[3:42:11.480 --> 3:42:17.520]  with the reality that Planned Parenthood is that type of entity it is an organization
[3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:26.280]  that is structured to profit off of the vulnerable. Teresa we have only 30 seconds and Alex Jones
[3:42:26.280 --> 3:42:31.360]  has a very broad diverse audience and I think a lot of them like this is my kind of woman
[3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:37.680]  this is who I've been looking for how do people find you. You can find me at at Teresa Lynn
[3:42:37.680 --> 3:42:45.200]  T-E-R-R-I-S-A-L-I-N on Twitter and on Instagram and you can find us at pro-life San Francisco
[3:42:45.200 --> 3:42:50.640]  that's prolifesf.com we're on Facebook we're on Twitter we're on Instagram and we are
[3:42:50.640 --> 3:42:55.120]  boom. I'm always excited about info wars life products they're amazing they're cutting
[3:42:55.120 --> 3:42:58.800]  edge you love them I love them and they find the info war in the face of the globalist
[3:42:58.800 --> 3:43:06.880]  onslaught but we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing
[3:43:06.880 --> 3:43:14.720]  the only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it and
[3:43:14.720 --> 3:43:21.280]  there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick
[3:43:21.280 --> 3:43:26.960]  gross goo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great way I like to put it
[3:43:26.960 --> 3:43:31.840]  on my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it around
[3:43:31.840 --> 3:43:37.680]  your eyes but I just love it personally it's something that's a moisturizer as well so
[3:43:37.680 --> 3:43:40.800]  this is a real innovation I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand
[3:43:40.800 --> 3:43:45.760]  sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great
[3:43:46.400 --> 3:43:55.680]  it's so refreshing this is a big winner globalism is all about making the nation state and the
[3:43:55.680 --> 3:44:03.360]  population itself obsolete non-essential that's why they position it with economic tariffs
[3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:08.800]  taxes and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States
[3:44:08.800 --> 3:44:15.280]  has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate that's part of making us obsolete
[3:44:15.280 --> 3:44:22.000]  so that as the human world is phased out they can simply look at us and say because again you
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:28.080]  are non-essential that's what the robots and all of this is about it's about setting it up where
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:34.320]  we're no longer in charge of our lives we can be told to stay on our houses and after all shut up
[3:44:34.320 --> 3:44:39.200]  this world doesn't belong to people anyways it belongs to the new ai gods the rich elitists that
[3:44:39.200 --> 3:44:45.200]  emerge with machines yeah that sounds completely insane doesn't it that's actually the public plan
[3:44:45.200 --> 3:44:50.800]  they're pushing these people are completely psychotic and make hitler look like a choir boy

[3:47:38.400 --> 3:47:46.720]  from fashionable half truths a silk shroud to mask our everyday evils even the stories of heroes
[3:47:46.720 --> 3:47:53.840]  who risked all they had in the fight for human dignity can seem impossibly out of reach we can
[3:47:53.840 --> 3:47:59.840]  tell ourselves that we are not made of the same kind of stuff the fiber that lets the man defy
[3:47:59.840 --> 3:48:06.560]  his nation's government its ruling elites its secret police we are just regular joes and
[3:48:06.560 --> 3:48:13.360]  chains and life will not ask us to make this sort of sacrifice it had better not because we will fail
[3:48:14.800 --> 3:48:20.880]  but that is a lie the same kind of lie that subhumanism tells us about each other about our
[3:48:20.880 --> 3:48:27.680]  neighbors and spouses and children and especially about strangers who look or think or pray just
[3:48:27.680 --> 3:48:35.440]  a little bit different the heroes among us prove that this simply isn't true the texture of their
[3:48:35.440 --> 3:48:44.400]  lives and the sacrifices they made prove that each and every one of us can do more we can be better
[3:48:45.280 --> 3:48:51.040]  neither Jerome Lejeune or Marianne yet nor jersey popey sq was born with special powers
[3:48:51.600 --> 3:48:58.400]  wearing a halo or in a manger ordinary human beings like me and you they were confused and
[3:48:58.400 --> 3:49:03.920]  frightened and tempted each one of them could have made very different choices could have
[3:49:03.920 --> 3:49:11.440]  troubled along and averted his eyes from the truths that were being trampled subhumanism
[3:49:11.440 --> 3:49:18.480]  for all the intellectual or political masks it wears says just one central thing that man
[3:49:18.480 --> 3:49:23.840]  doesn't really matter all that much that there is nothing in us that exceeds or transcends the
[3:49:23.840 --> 3:49:32.080]  ugliness of Darwinian competition the limits of biology the inevitability of death that is a lie
[3:49:32.080 --> 3:49:39.200]  and we can treat people as if they were robots ghosts or beasts we can starve enslave imprison
[3:49:39.200 --> 3:49:47.440]  them or kill them but that doesn't change the reality if we look up and also within we find
[3:49:47.440 --> 3:49:53.680]  the mysterious image and likeness of god we will discover the truth that we and our neighbors have
[3:49:53.680 --> 3:50:00.480]  an incomparable beauty and worth a dignity that no one can take away our thousand year rikes
[3:50:00.480 --> 3:50:07.440]  our workers' paradises or this brave new world our ghastly fantasies that human beings create
[3:50:08.160 --> 3:50:15.040]  and that history duly comes along and exposes and what is left behind bruised and battered but
[3:50:15.040 --> 3:50:22.560]  still unbowed is the face of man as noble and as beautiful as adam reaching out his hand to the
[3:50:22.560 --> 3:50:29.920]  god who made him we will remember that and we will do what is needed we will feel from the
[3:50:29.920 --> 3:50:36.560]  depths of our hearts to the highest flights of our imagination a love of the good a hatred of
[3:50:36.560 --> 3:50:43.040]  cruelty and smallness of soul and the loyalty to each and every member of our family the human
[3:50:43.040 --> 3:50:50.080]  family we will fight to enshrine the basic principles of decency in our political economic
[3:50:50.080 --> 3:51:03.520]  and personal lives we will have courage we will prevail all right guys i made this for you just
[3:51:03.520 --> 3:51:09.040]  yesterday with a friend and the reason i did that is i want to give you my book at our cost
[3:51:09.040 --> 3:51:14.560]  for a donation of twenty dollars if you go to the great campaign dot org you get the book that
[3:51:14.560 --> 3:51:20.880]  includes the book the packaging and the shipping the great campaign dot org when i wrote this book
[3:51:20.880 --> 3:51:32.080]  i had you in mind imagine if there were a way to undermine the globalists soros the who bill gates
[3:51:32.080 --> 3:51:36.880]  without really knowing what they were up to without having to unravel every scheme every
[3:51:36.880 --> 3:51:44.160]  strategy and every tactic i set out with that goal as a young undergraduate and i gave myself to the
[3:51:44.160 --> 3:51:50.560]  hundredth anniversary of world war one 2014 to publish the book and together with political
[3:51:50.560 --> 3:51:56.880]  economists and philosopher john smirak we worked on this book for almost 20 years to come up with
[3:51:56.880 --> 3:52:04.400]  five core principles that if we advance in society won't unravel every totalitarian scheme to rob us
[3:52:04.400 --> 3:52:12.000]  and what makes the alex jones info wars audience so special as you know i have friends who are
[3:52:12.000 --> 3:52:18.160]  religious about info wars who are bernie bros i have friends who are libertarian i have friends
[3:52:18.160 --> 3:52:24.160]  who love trump and don't and and despise trump but they they have one thing in common that they go
[3:52:24.160 --> 3:52:30.080]  to info wars that they watch alex jones that they know the mainstream media isn't giving them the
[3:52:30.080 --> 3:52:37.840]  truth that they are even if they disagree on many important things what they share is a very real
[3:52:37.840 --> 3:52:47.440]  concern for justice a very real desire for peace a real desire and that is most people most people
[3:52:47.440 --> 3:52:54.400]  we know i you know everyone most people we know aren't their children that live in a country that's
[3:52:54.400 --> 3:52:59.920]  peaceful and prosperous and they want to go with their grandchildren to go to good schools and they
[3:52:59.920 --> 3:53:07.120]  want the guy across town who has a different religion different complexion they want his
[3:53:07.120 --> 3:53:13.680]  kids to go to a good school they want his children to live in peace they want his children to live
[3:53:13.680 --> 3:53:18.240]  in a safe neighborhood when i started writing that book well we were in the midst of writing that
[3:53:18.240 --> 3:53:23.520]  book well actually i didn't bring john on yet i was in the in the very early stages of developing
[3:53:23.520 --> 3:53:29.360]  the book prior right prior to the invasion of iraq and i remember the time thinking my son was
[3:53:29.360 --> 3:53:38.320]  still very young he was 11 and i thought if we topple this regime two horrible things are going
[3:53:38.320 --> 3:53:44.000]  to happen number one the american people will leave and the christian minorities the jewish
[3:53:44.000 --> 3:53:49.680]  minorities the other minorities the curds the alawites the azidi they'll they'll be left alone
[3:53:49.680 --> 3:53:56.480]  and they'll suffer in genocide my other great fear was that my own son would have to fight in that
[3:53:56.480 --> 3:54:00.640]  war because we're a military family i was in the infantry my dad was in the infantry my grandfather
[3:54:00.640 --> 3:54:08.320]  is my uncle my brother fought in iraq and you know what's sad my son fought in syria and in iraq
[3:54:09.200 --> 3:54:14.320]  at a time i was actually in iraq my son wasn't too far away with his unit working its way towards
[3:54:14.320 --> 3:54:19.760]  isis while i was with the peshmerga the Kurdish fighters documenting their battle against isis
[3:54:19.760 --> 3:54:25.680]  and it was heartbreaking for me at the time to know that my son was there and looking at the damage
[3:54:25.680 --> 3:54:32.000]  that was done to the azidi and the Uyghurs now we look around we see the economy shut down
[3:54:32.880 --> 3:54:39.760]  all over the world they didn't tell the average joe eight weeks ago the shutdown would lead to
[3:54:39.760 --> 3:54:46.560]  famine in the horn of africa they sold them the shutdown they scared them to death they obliterated
[3:54:46.560 --> 3:54:52.320]  subsidiarity they obliterated the influence and power of those institutions closest to you and me
[3:54:52.320 --> 3:55:00.080]  and the who dictated policies that influenced every little community around the world and they
[3:55:00.080 --> 3:55:05.920]  sold us a lie they scared the american people the people of the world to death they shut down
[3:55:05.920 --> 3:55:12.880]  the global economy and now the new york times tells us now the new york times tells us oh
[3:55:13.520 --> 3:55:21.840]  we're approaching a famine of biblical proportions because of the shutdown really unbelievable i wrote
[3:55:21.840 --> 3:55:27.760]  about that three weeks ago i've been talking about it since the italy shut down because genocide
[3:55:27.760 --> 3:55:32.320]  and democide famine and war something i've been obsessed with all those books behind me that's
[3:55:32.320 --> 3:55:38.080]  what they're about but i want to give you the the information on the principles that you can
[3:55:38.080 --> 3:55:45.120]  advocate if we promote a culture where everyone understands that every human being has an enviable
[3:55:45.120 --> 3:55:52.160]  dignity and beauty and worth from the child in the womb to the elderly and an old folks home in
[3:55:52.720 --> 3:55:57.200]  new jersey who are being neglected in the midst of this covid crisis if we acknowledge there's
[3:55:57.200 --> 3:56:05.600]  a law above the laws of man the blasio king creon there's a law above you subsidiarity if we kick
[3:56:06.560 --> 3:56:14.080]  unelected unaccountable distant bureaucracies are out of our communities and say you don't tell us
[3:56:14.080 --> 3:56:19.920]  anything go away bring power close to the family close to the community close to the people that
[3:56:19.920 --> 3:56:27.760]  subsidiarity if we recommit ourselves to protecting private property rights you are the king and the
[3:56:27.760 --> 3:56:35.840]  queen of your castle that is your castle and private property rights that is the foundation
[3:56:35.840 --> 3:56:42.560]  of a just social order that is the foundation of prosperity the number two causes of death in the
[3:56:42.560 --> 3:56:50.640]  past 100 years famine and totalitarianism and really most of those famines were caused by
[3:56:50.640 --> 3:56:57.760]  totalitarian governments Stalin and the ukraine miles starving tens of millions of his own people
[3:56:57.760 --> 3:57:03.760]  the kamir rouge the communists in Ethiopia destroying the grain surplus so really the biggest
[3:57:03.760 --> 3:57:09.920]  killer has just been distant unelected bureaucracies making rules of what they know not and finally
[3:57:09.920 --> 3:57:15.280]  which is everyone that watches this show has if you're an alex jones info warrior you have a
[3:57:15.280 --> 3:57:21.840]  commitment to solidarity it's not every man for itself it's not i'm gonna just hide away and be a
[3:57:21.840 --> 3:57:28.320]  survivalist and do my own thing and take care of my own family it's we're in this together we the only
[3:57:28.320 --> 3:57:34.240]  way we save our families from drowning is not getting the best place in the lifeboat making sure
[3:57:34.240 --> 3:57:39.280]  we don't hit the iceberg so next week what a privilege to host the alex jones show they might
[3:57:39.280 --> 3:57:45.520]  try to burn the book but it will rise
