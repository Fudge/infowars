[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.160 --> 00:19.680]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.680 --> 00:34.240]  Alex Jones it is Tuesday the 31st day of August 2010 I hadn't had him on in
[00:34.240 --> 00:38.200]  years but I found it to be very informative and thought-provoking so we
[00:38.200 --> 00:43.680]  had him on last week Joel Scalson World Affairs brief he'll be joining us in the
[00:43.680 --> 00:48.120]  second and third hour today and we're going to have open phones with Joel
[00:48.120 --> 00:53.400]  Scalson joining us in the meantime we'll be covering all this important news like
[00:53.400 --> 00:55.640]  this headline of the London Telegraph today
[00:55.640 --> 01:06.000]  Afghanistan bomb attacks killed 21 US soldiers in 48 hours 21 American troops
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.960]  have been killed in Afghanistan since Friday and one of the bloodiest periods
[01:09.960 --> 01:15.720]  of the summer so that situation over there is deteriorating very very quickly
[01:15.720 --> 01:21.120]  and of course there's more violence now popping up in Iraq why are we in these
[01:21.120 --> 01:26.520]  countries well not for the reasons you're told on the news for WMDs or
[01:26.520 --> 01:31.720]  then to spread democracy or to free the women women were the majority of
[01:31.720 --> 01:37.080]  college graduates and new doctors in Iraq and now most women have to wear the
[01:37.080 --> 01:42.800]  burkas and that's because the globalist like to put radical Islamist in power
[01:42.800 --> 01:47.720]  they don't want first-world Arab and Muslim countries and that's the big
[01:47.720 --> 01:51.760]  dirty secret who do the Rockefellers the Ford Foundation fund they fund the
[01:51.760 --> 01:57.280]  low reconquista you know pick up your machete Robert Rodriguez they fund the
[01:57.280 --> 02:01.840]  radical Muslims they have been caught funding the white supremacist they've
[02:01.840 --> 02:07.800]  been caught funding every sectarian group pushing division and war and
[02:07.800 --> 02:12.680]  conflict so then the government in the media can play the part of the arbiter
[02:12.680 --> 02:18.240]  the referee the good guy oh look at all the violence look at all the sectarian
[02:18.240 --> 02:23.280]  violence look at the radical Muslims look at the low reconquista look at all
[02:23.280 --> 02:27.680]  the border problems we've got to come in with the North American Union to fix
[02:27.680 --> 02:35.200]  all of these problems we'll be covering some of that today also I wondered this
[02:35.200 --> 02:42.400]  morning while woke up got on the computer at about 7 a.m. and saw that the
[02:42.400 --> 02:47.000]  drudge report had linked to to just a YouTube video that we'd posted that
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.800]  we'd linked to with this headline satellite spy satellite used on
[02:52.800 --> 02:57.680]  American citizens all Americans should have great pride and of course we love
[02:57.680 --> 03:00.400]  the drudge report I love the drudge report many years ago before they
[03:00.400 --> 03:05.560]  started linking to us every week because I noticed that he was breaking the mold in
[03:05.560 --> 03:10.360]  what you could call crossover alternative mainstream media millions of
[03:10.360 --> 03:14.760]  visitors a day probably the permanent news site period in the world if you had
[03:14.760 --> 03:20.880]  to pick one it's drudge report and he would link to BBC and foreign
[03:20.880 --> 03:27.200]  publications admitting world government and so that through Limbaugh and Beck
[03:27.200 --> 03:30.840]  and Hannity for a loop to where they've had to come out and admit okay there is a
[03:30.840 --> 03:36.400]  world government but you're still a cook if you criticize it you know it's a
[03:36.400 --> 03:39.880]  commie new world order it's not run by the big banks that own the Republicans
[03:39.880 --> 03:43.520]  and the Democrats so I was pleased to see that new link today and I wondered
[03:43.520 --> 03:48.360]  why he pulled it down and I found out why the video was about three and a half
[03:48.360 --> 03:54.920]  years old and again a listener just sent it to us it's been freshly posted up on
[03:54.920 --> 04:02.920]  YouTube but but that spurred me to think about something even more important we
[04:02.920 --> 04:06.920]  see this three and a half year old clip from Homeland Security back in 2007 when
[04:06.920 --> 04:10.840]  they were announcing oh we're gonna watch you with spy satellites to stop
[04:10.840 --> 04:16.480]  Al Qaeda and then now the reason this is back in the news and Steve Watson
[04:16.480 --> 04:20.200]  Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson have written about it in the last few weeks is
[04:20.200 --> 04:24.640]  they're saying oh we're using the spy satellites and we're gonna use it to
[04:24.640 --> 04:29.080]  watch your farms your ranches we're gonna use it to make sure you don't build a
[04:29.080 --> 04:34.480]  shed or work shed or barn on your property under zoning they're getting
[04:34.480 --> 04:40.080]  rid of all the pretense that it's for shadowy neanderthals and caves that
[04:40.080 --> 04:45.920]  want to drink our blood and so I'm glad we posted this but we're writing a new
[04:45.920 --> 04:51.160]  article to explain here they are three years ago saying it's for terrorism and
[04:51.160 --> 04:55.320]  then three and a half years later they're saying oh no it's for you the

[08:15.280 --> 08:21.960]  it is Tuesday the 31st day of August 2010 as I said in the last segment Joel
[08:21.960 --> 08:26.280]  Scalzen is going to be joining us coming up the next hour had him on for an hour
[08:26.280 --> 08:30.320]  last week and it just wasn't enough time to go over all of my questions that I
[08:30.320 --> 08:35.320]  had for him and also want to be able to open the phones up for listeners the
[08:35.320 --> 08:43.640]  toll-free number to join us will be taken calls during this hour is 1-800-259-9231
[08:43.640 --> 08:51.880]  1-800-259-9231 will get you up and on the air
[08:54.520 --> 08:58.960]  okay first thing I want to do is play this clip from three and a half years
[08:58.960 --> 09:02.520]  ago because I saw this when I was surfing around the web last week that had
[09:02.520 --> 09:07.280]  been reposted and I meant to get to it but I want to cover this issue now before
[09:07.280 --> 09:13.480]  I get into 21 US soldiers killed in the last 48 hours before I get into the
[09:13.480 --> 09:20.440]  latest economic information Bloomberg has the headline gold rallying to 1,500 as
[09:20.440 --> 09:27.240]  Soros bubble inflates that is all coming up in this hour and your phone calls but
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.040]  I wanted to play this clip with one of the deputy directors of Homeland
[09:31.040 --> 09:37.360]  Security three and a half years ago saying Americans should be proud of the
[09:37.360 --> 09:44.600]  fact that NSA and Pentagon satellites are being used to surveil the American
[09:44.600 --> 09:51.560]  people now when they announced this back in 2007 there was a big uproar and a
[09:51.560 --> 09:55.680]  lot of federal judges said that's completely illegal that was the same
[09:55.680 --> 09:59.400]  time that the warrantless wiretapping was coming out that was illegal and the
[09:59.400 --> 10:04.000]  torture was coming out that was illegal and so they backed off and said okay
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.560]  we're not going to have local police basically federalized in the fusion
[10:08.560 --> 10:12.920]  centers surveilling everyone but they went ahead with the training and did it
[10:12.920 --> 10:19.080]  this is in Greece Australia the UK Canada the US it's all the same thing so
[10:19.080 --> 10:22.840]  the issue here is here they are three years ago three and a half years ago
[10:22.840 --> 10:28.840]  saying this is for terrorist and then now we learn today that's all over the
[10:28.840 --> 10:35.320]  news in the last few weeks that oh you didn't pay the city fee to have a
[10:35.320 --> 10:40.160]  swimming pool you didn't get environmental approval or zoning
[10:40.160 --> 10:47.200]  approval to build that shed on your farm or to re-roof that house so they're
[10:47.200 --> 10:51.080]  using it and of course you've seen the famous Pennsylvania ad that came out
[10:51.080 --> 10:56.040]  this year where it shows them surveilling somebody with a satellite
[10:56.040 --> 11:00.520]  named Tom saying we know where you live Tom you owe us four thousand dollars Tom
[11:00.520 --> 11:06.840]  we're coming to get you Tom so they go from trying to unveil this name of
[11:06.840 --> 11:12.160]  fighting al-CIA to al-Qaeda to now admitting it's for we the people here
[11:12.160 --> 11:14.440]  it is
[11:15.800 --> 11:20.800]  first there were eyes on the street and now there are eyes in the skies the
[11:20.800 --> 11:24.160]  director of national intelligence has given the go-ahead for the nation's
[11:24.160 --> 11:29.680]  spy satellites to be used regularly by US civilian agencies and law enforcement
[11:29.680 --> 11:33.400]  this is a development all Americans should have great pride in because it
[11:33.400 --> 11:38.160]  expands and uses a national technical systems which we've built for tens of
[11:38.160 --> 11:42.160]  billions of dollars over many decades spy satellites have primarily been used
[11:42.160 --> 11:46.440]  overseas to monitor things like war zones and terror training camps they've
[11:46.440 --> 11:51.080]  also been used domestically but sparingly during events including Super Bowl
[11:51.080 --> 11:55.280]  games presidential inaugurals and hurricanes homeland security officials
[11:55.280 --> 11:58.680]  say the satellites will now be used to protect borders and critical
[11:58.680 --> 12:03.960]  infrastructure which includes sports and looking at potential vulnerabilities
[12:03.960 --> 12:08.520]  and the and threats as well as consequences of attacks next in line
[12:08.520 --> 12:12.240]  law enforcement agencies which are expected to start using them next year
[12:12.240 --> 12:16.400]  well they can provide crucial high-resolution images there are limits
[12:16.400 --> 12:20.640]  to what these satellites can do they can't see faces and they can't listen
[12:20.640 --> 12:25.000]  at least that's what the government claims but privacy groups worry that
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.800]  because there's so much we don't know about their capabilities they could be
[12:28.800 --> 12:34.560]  misused and we wouldn't even know it the question always comes down to what are
[12:34.560 --> 12:39.200]  the standards are their checks and balances and is this a power that we
[12:39.200 --> 12:45.480]  would trust the executive branch to use without any outside scrutiny or oversight
[12:45.480 --> 12:49.440]  or control it Homeland Security officials insist that they are subject to a
[12:49.440 --> 12:54.040]  great amount of oversight and review but in many ways this is just one more case
[12:54.040 --> 12:58.440]  of the government figuring it out as it goes in the war on terror Kelly arena
[12:58.440 --> 13:04.280]  CNN Washington they're not figuring anything out as they go they
[13:04.280 --> 13:08.800]  premeditatedly lied to you about taking your baby's blood at birth of your
[13:08.800 --> 13:13.520]  38 years old or younger you had your blood secretly taken whether you live in
[13:13.520 --> 13:17.520]  England the United States Australia New Zealand Canada it's a global program
[13:17.520 --> 13:22.040]  most European nations Western European nations they lied to you and said they
[13:22.040 --> 13:26.120]  weren't saving your naked body scan images we could read the Homeland
[13:26.120 --> 13:30.360]  Security purchase orders and it stated they're designed to save all your
[13:30.360 --> 13:35.480]  images and attach it to your name and social security number and driver's
[13:35.480 --> 13:41.800]  license and passport their database in your biometric body scan and training
[13:41.800 --> 13:46.720]  you to accept this form of tyranny the government isn't figuring this out as
[13:46.720 --> 13:51.440]  they go member Bush getting up four years ago and saying we do not spy on
[13:51.440 --> 13:56.200]  Americans without warrants I promise you turns out he signed all the orders for
[13:56.200 --> 14:02.720]  unlimited spying without warrants they lie to you as a matter of course remember
[14:02.720 --> 14:06.760]  they promised that the trillions of dollars in the bailout would only be
[14:06.760 --> 14:12.560]  800 billion then it turned out to be tens of trillions they promised it would
[14:12.560 --> 14:17.960]  be immediately to unlock the mortgage situation none of the money went to that
[14:17.960 --> 14:22.080]  the next day October 4th they said we're spending none of it on that and
[14:22.080 --> 14:26.760]  we're not going to tell Congress where the money's going and for more than 60
[14:26.760 --> 14:31.800]  years Congress has requested to know where the US gold supply is no one's
[14:31.800 --> 14:35.360]  allowed to inspect it no one's allowed to look at it because under the Federal
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.680]  Reserve Act it's under the private banks control now Ron Paul is no doubt
[14:39.680 --> 14:45.360]  risking his life saying he wants an audit of Fort Knox and other gold
[14:45.360 --> 14:54.000]  deposits depositories you don't hear Glenn Beck calling for a audit of the
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.680]  gold do you you don't care hear him calling for an audit of the Fed if he
[14:58.680 --> 15:02.360]  started doing stuff like that he wouldn't be on Fox News very long and I'd
[15:02.360 --> 15:05.760]  be supporting him and I'm not here trying to attack Glenn back I'm just
[15:05.760 --> 15:11.320]  pointing out that he doesn't go one-tenth as far as he should with the
[15:11.320 --> 15:18.400]  amazing power that he has because they know that the American people have
[15:18.400 --> 15:24.400]  awakened they know that Ron Paul and many others had become focal points for a
[15:24.400 --> 15:29.000]  huge movement to seriously challenge the left-right paradigm and the Republican
[15:29.000 --> 15:35.400]  and Democratic parties and the system brought in Glenn Beck and others to
[15:35.400 --> 15:39.720]  co-op that at that key moment they've been very successful by the way the
[15:39.720 --> 15:43.760]  reason I raised that it's it's it's in my stack I'm going to cover it after the
[15:43.760 --> 15:49.760]  bottom of the hour break Ron Paul has put out an editorial that was published
[15:49.760 --> 15:52.800]  in major newspapers across the country including the New York Times of all
[15:52.800 --> 15:59.000]  places they went with it because they think it'll drive a wedge between
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.320]  Republicans and Democrats and further left-right paradigm it'll actually do
[16:04.320 --> 16:08.120]  the opposite and they're they're scared of going back right now bringing the
[16:08.120 --> 16:12.880]  Republicans into the power structure there they're back into control the
[16:12.880 --> 16:18.120]  power structure but the point is you read Ron Paul's editorial he explains
[16:18.120 --> 16:22.520]  that he's against Obama and he's against the Republican leadership because if
[16:22.520 --> 16:27.840]  you look at their voting records not their rhetoric look at what they do not
[16:27.840 --> 16:33.240]  what they say government grows when Republicans are in almost as fast as it
[16:33.240 --> 16:37.160]  does when Obama's gotten into office in fact previously government would grow
[16:37.160 --> 16:41.520]  even faster under Republicans than it would under Democrats if you look at
[16:41.520 --> 16:50.240]  the statistics but now under Obama all those rules have been broken I mean you
[16:50.240 --> 16:54.040]  would imagine that it would be Democrats with their tax and spend system that
[16:54.040 --> 16:57.880]  would actually create the biggest deficits and things but if you look at
[16:57.880 --> 17:01.880]  the average is normally Republicans tend to get even more big government
[17:01.880 --> 17:05.720]  through because conservatives go to sleep but now under Obama with the
[17:05.720 --> 17:12.320]  government takeover of health care with expanding these wars with expanding the
[17:12.320 --> 17:17.800]  size of the federal government he has tripled the size of government in only
[17:17.800 --> 17:23.920]  a year and a half an office when George W. Bush only doubled it a little more
[17:23.920 --> 17:27.640]  than doubled you can go pull up the statistics on that but Obama has spent
[17:27.640 --> 17:33.200]  more money than all presidents before him combined that's George W. Bush back
[17:33.200 --> 17:41.200]  to George Washington it's really such big numbers it's hard to even get your
[17:41.200 --> 17:48.640]  mind around this but going back to the satellite issue spy satellites used to
[17:48.640 --> 17:55.680]  control American citizens Kurt Nemo did a boil down story on this today showing
[17:55.680 --> 18:04.480]  how all these mainstream publications are promoting how great it is that the
[18:04.480 --> 18:12.640]  environmental agencies and law enforcement agencies are now basically
[18:12.640 --> 18:18.160]  you know skipping all of the mid moves and going right to the endgame where
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.480]  they're just coming right out and saying we're going to use this for
[18:22.480 --> 18:27.400]  everything we're going to use this and we're going to issue pupils government
[18:27.400 --> 18:32.400]  jerseys they've got to wear basically prisoner shirts that have RFID tracking
[18:32.400 --> 18:35.960]  them in real time and yes we're putting up microphones to track you on the
[18:35.960 --> 18:41.200]  street corners and yes we've got mobile x-ray vans that drive around x-raying
[18:41.200 --> 18:46.040]  your house from a distance I mean I knew 14 years ago I'd seen Pentagon
[18:46.040 --> 18:54.640]  purchase orders for domestic helicopters with x-ray high-powered x-ray systems
[18:54.640 --> 19:00.480]  mounted to them not just infrared but x-ray but but now it's in Forbes telling
[19:00.480 --> 19:04.800]  you how great it is and there's the health issues from this there's the
[19:04.800 --> 19:12.760]  privacy issues yesterday I was pretty nasty in the three hours very negative
[19:12.760 --> 19:20.680]  because it just disgusts me how bonafide and naked this tyranny is by any
[19:20.680 --> 19:28.280]  measurement by any yardstick by any historical perspective and it's racing
[19:28.280 --> 19:35.800]  in its growth and it's our tax money doing it as we go bankrupt and Mexico is
[19:35.800 --> 19:42.160]  descending into absolute hell every day it gets more insane and our government
[19:42.160 --> 19:46.600]  won't use the spy satellites to take care of that in fact our government's
[19:46.600 --> 19:51.440]  funding many of the massacres that are going on down there it's all coming up
[19:51.440 --> 19:56.240]  I'll get into the economy next and a bunch of global warming news what they've

[24:08.960 --> 24:21.600]  radio network let's look at the economic news here's a Bloomberg headline out
[24:21.600 --> 24:31.200]  this morning gold rallying the 1500 as show roses bubble inflates and every
[24:31.200 --> 24:35.040]  time I've seen Bloomberg make a prediction like this it's come true and
[24:35.040 --> 24:41.600]  isn't that gold is really going up it's that paper currencies worldwide are
[24:41.600 --> 24:48.600]  being devalued basically in concert investors are accumulating enough
[24:48.600 --> 24:54.960]  bullion to fill Switzerland's vaults twice over as gold's most accurate
[24:54.960 --> 25:00.920]  forecasters say the longest rally in at least nine decades has further to go no
[25:00.920 --> 25:08.440]  matter what the economy holds analysts raised their 2011 forecast more than for
[25:08.440 --> 25:15.040]  any other precious metal in the past two months predicting a tenth annual
[25:15.040 --> 25:21.760]  advance data compiled by Bloomberg shows the most widely held option of gold
[25:21.760 --> 25:32.040]  futures traded in New York for 1500 an ounce by December did you hear that the
[25:32.040 --> 25:38.600]  most widely held option this is what the market's betting on on gold futures
[25:38.600 --> 25:49.080]  traded in New York is for 1500 an ounce by December or an 18% more than the
[25:49.080 --> 26:00.320]  record 1266 50 cents gold is up more than 13 dollars today and it's a market
[26:00.320 --> 26:07.320]  fundamental that as the Federal Reserve announces quantitative easing and a move
[26:07.320 --> 26:14.160]  towards global SDR is another layer of digital cashless currency amongst the
[26:14.160 --> 26:22.320]  banks based on carbon taxes based on carbon credits backed up by faltering
[26:22.320 --> 26:30.000]  currencies and as governments start monetizing their debt when the treasury
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.680]  issues bonds and governments and institutions and individuals don't buy
[26:34.680 --> 26:41.120]  all of them or in some cases even half of them the Federal Reserve comes in and
[26:41.120 --> 26:49.320]  creates more currency to buy its own debt and so to put this in layman's terms
[26:49.320 --> 26:52.680]  because I'm a layman myself I just I've been studying it for a long time but all
[26:52.680 --> 26:57.960]  the technical terms you know even a sometimes even escaped me though I try
[26:57.960 --> 27:03.800]  to understand it it's very simple it's kind of like saying Vegas is two to one
[27:03.800 --> 27:11.120]  for this football team at the Super Bowl or Vegas has got odds for this team to
[27:11.120 --> 27:20.160]  win and generally almost always the house wins that's why if you bet for the
[27:20.160 --> 27:26.080]  underdog and when you end up making a lot more money there's not a very big
[27:26.080 --> 27:32.000]  spread of profit if you bet for who Vegas is saying is going to win the
[27:32.000 --> 27:39.960]  Super Bowl so the majority of the money now on Wall Street in the futures market
[27:39.960 --> 27:56.000]  for December coming up in three months is on gold going up 18 percent and they
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.200]  talk about it only increasing in value after that in fact give me a document
[28:00.200 --> 28:05.800]  I'll show people this article here today we can put it on screen I know you
[28:05.800 --> 28:11.880]  were earlier gold rallying to 1,500 as Soros bubble inflates and every time I
[28:11.880 --> 28:16.240]  talk about gold I get emails every time I talk about the stock market saying well
[28:16.240 --> 28:21.080]  I'm not in gold so I don't care or I'm not in the stock market so I don't care
[28:21.080 --> 28:27.280]  well almost every major corporation and company in this country that produces
[28:27.280 --> 28:33.920]  jobs and pays taxes and pays for the infrastructure is in the stock market
[28:33.920 --> 28:39.160]  and that's how they're funding themselves and the big canary in the coal
[28:39.160 --> 28:46.480]  mine there's many unemployment numbers housing starts inflation numbers those
[28:46.480 --> 28:57.480]  are always important but the real canary in the coal mine is always gold gold and
[28:57.480 --> 29:04.680]  the fact that the majority or in their words the most widely held the most
[29:04.680 --> 29:15.600]  popular option on gold futures traded in New York is $1,500 an ounce by
[29:15.600 --> 29:24.240]  December so we're talking about three months from now it's the end of August
[29:24.240 --> 29:28.600]  September October November three months from now three months in one day
[29:28.600 --> 29:34.920]  technically will be into the month of December and Wall Street who it's all an
[29:34.920 --> 29:41.520]  insider game is saying it's gonna be 1,500 an ounce so we'll continue to
[29:41.520 --> 29:48.720]  discuss the economy on the other side then I'm gonna get into the carbon
[29:48.720 --> 29:56.080]  taxing crowd we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[33:10.920 --> 33:16.440]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:16.440 --> 33:27.920]  it happens more and more I did hours of research Sunday night hours of research
[33:27.920 --> 33:33.120]  Monday morning about 30 minutes of scanning back over the news before I
[33:33.120 --> 33:40.800]  went live yesterday and then I got so upset and so overwhelmed by everything
[33:40.800 --> 33:47.840]  that yesterday overall I was pretty negative and defeatist and angry you
[33:47.840 --> 33:55.760]  know that feeling of almost like being dirty is like I don't mean dirty
[33:55.760 --> 34:05.320]  sexually or dirty like mud on your hands or mud on your feet I mean cloudy like
[34:05.320 --> 34:10.080]  you have ashes in your mouth just I guess you call it depression I don't
[34:10.080 --> 34:15.480]  really get depressed I get angry and disgusted and it's like a dark cloud is
[34:15.480 --> 34:20.280]  hanging over my head and I'm like why are public schools nationwide all over
[34:20.280 --> 34:29.920]  the country making children wear RFID tracker chips why is the government
[34:29.920 --> 34:34.200]  taking babies blood secretly at birth and lying about it why are they just
[34:34.200 --> 34:39.840]  scanning our naked bodies at airports and saving it why does the CIA admit that
[34:39.840 --> 34:43.960]  they've put out fake bin Laden videos and there's no congressional
[34:43.960 --> 34:50.720]  investigation why are they putting naked body scanners in mobile trucks and
[34:50.720 --> 34:55.640]  federal and state courthouses why have foreign offshore banks stolen over 28
[34:55.640 --> 35:01.440]  trillion dollars according to Bloomberg in the first year since the banker bail
[35:01.440 --> 35:07.680]  out oh yeah we haven't gotten new numbers in about eight months it was 28
[35:07.680 --> 35:15.960]  trillion in January they don't even release the raw numbers anymore when I
[35:15.960 --> 35:22.440]  realize and and really consciously focus and I know I say this all the time
[35:22.440 --> 35:29.640]  because I'm dumbfounded I'm dumbfounded I can't believe that we're in this much
[35:29.640 --> 35:36.080]  tyranny and that it's accelerating this fast I see where it's going and every
[35:36.080 --> 35:40.000]  day I say on the broadcast because this is all I think about I look at my
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.480]  innocent children little bitty sweet children and how good they are and how
[35:44.480 --> 35:55.240]  full of creativity and love and curiosity they are and I think about how
[35:55.240 --> 36:04.080]  corrupt this world is and it just makes me so angry and so disgusted that I
[36:04.080 --> 36:12.600]  can't even describe it and then I become speechless you know that's what it that's
[36:12.600 --> 36:18.680]  what happens then I have trouble even doing the radio broadcast because it's
[36:18.680 --> 36:24.680]  a painful process for me this isn't entertainment it's not fun sometimes I
[36:24.680 --> 36:30.360]  screw around and joke around and it's kind of good to get into that mindset
[36:30.360 --> 36:36.280]  sometimes so I'm not so stressed out and all work and no play you'll make
[36:36.280 --> 36:42.360]  anybody dull but at the same time when I do screw around or getting a good mood
[36:42.360 --> 36:48.200]  I feel guilty later because I realize how much trouble as a society we're
[36:48.200 --> 36:53.960]  really in I mean the globalist in their own records that we've linked to and
[36:53.960 --> 37:02.800]  reported on say they want to destroy our economy by design and they're doing it
[37:02.800 --> 37:11.080]  and they're shipping the narcotics in and murdering their competition that's
[37:11.080 --> 37:19.320]  what the Mexico war is about and they're cold-blooded the globalist enjoy
[37:19.320 --> 37:24.520]  killing and if we don't wake up to that and realize that we have a global
[37:24.520 --> 37:28.840]  corporate tyranny dominating our nation and almost every other nation on earth
[37:28.840 --> 37:33.240]  and if we don't become more sophisticated and realize their systems of
[37:33.240 --> 37:40.080]  controlled 99% of us are going to be adversely affected by the changes
[37:40.080 --> 37:45.680]  happening in the world so many of you who are compartmentalized need to wake up
[37:45.680 --> 37:50.560]  and realize that you are under attack I mean here's an example and then I'm
[37:50.560 --> 38:03.440]  getting back into the economy but but but here's an example just yesterday we
[38:03.440 --> 38:16.600]  had had articles written at info wars.com repeatedly and when I talk
[38:16.600 --> 38:21.560]  about this I don't want to just come on air and talk about it and then have it
[38:21.560 --> 38:25.560]  just be some background chatter I mean I listen to rebroadcast of my show
[38:25.560 --> 38:32.640]  sometimes and sometimes it's very fluent it's very clear it's very eloquent it's
[38:32.640 --> 38:38.360]  filled with truth and charisma and other times I'm sitting there barking out
[38:38.360 --> 38:45.800]  kind of just chirping out statistics and numbers and incredible facts and truth
[38:45.800 --> 38:53.480]  but still I don't pause to illustrate just how massive the news and information
[38:53.480 --> 39:01.080]  is and I don't feel worthy to even be bringing you this information it's so
[39:01.080 --> 39:09.080]  incredible and I don't think the average bureaucrat or media minion who goes along
[39:09.080 --> 39:15.080]  with all of this fully understands just how murderous the globalist are and how
[39:15.080 --> 39:19.000]  dangerous this situation is.
[39:19.000 --> 39:30.680]  tyranny is not fun and it ends in mass murder and death. World War two
[39:30.680 --> 39:37.520]  conservatively killed about 64 million people on all sides and our government
[39:37.520 --> 39:43.480]  brags that they put pole pod into power who killed 30% of Cambodia's population
[39:43.480 --> 39:50.320]  conservatively. Mao Zedong who the Chinese say killed 84 million 85 million
[39:50.320 --> 39:58.660]  the US government says about 64 million so you better get this straight the
[39:58.660 --> 40:03.360]  globalist like to wipe out large groups of people to reorganize society to
[40:03.360 --> 40:07.520]  secure their ill-gotten gains and they're getting ready to pull similar
[40:07.520 --> 40:12.160]  things here in the United States this depression is only the beginning and
[40:12.160 --> 40:19.260]  that isn't what I think that's what I know that's not my opinion that's the
[40:19.260 --> 40:27.760]  historical fact do you get that do you understand that but I thought about those
[40:27.760 --> 40:32.400]  articles last week out of the hundreds of books I've read and Aaron Dykes has
[40:32.400 --> 40:36.000]  read out of the hundreds and hundreds of white papers we've read out of the
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.240]  hundreds of articles that Kurt Nemo Paul Watson Steve Watson Aaron Dykes and
[40:40.240 --> 40:45.720]  myself and and and other writers for info wars have written over the years I
[40:45.720 --> 40:53.080]  didn't even know that for more than 20 years the Rockefeller Foundation had
[40:53.080 --> 40:57.840]  released hundreds and hundreds of different documents bragging how they
[40:57.840 --> 41:02.880]  developed the tetanus vaccine with the female hormone added to sterilize women
[41:02.880 --> 41:08.000]  I knew about the UN program when they got caught doing it in the 90s but I
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.680]  didn't know that and then Rob do found a bunch of others on the Rockefeller
[41:11.680 --> 41:16.480]  Foundation site they're the ones putting this out they're proud of it with even
[41:16.480 --> 41:21.120]  more stuff they're putting in the vaccines I mean we have them red-handed
[41:21.120 --> 41:24.920]  and then I get disgusted with myself laying in bed last night at midnight
[41:24.920 --> 41:31.600]  thinking you've had those documents for a week you've posted a couple articles
[41:31.600 --> 41:39.040]  about it last night I was late to my grandmother's 85th birthday party we had
[41:39.040 --> 41:44.760]  one Sunday and Monday different family coming into town because I couldn't
[41:44.760 --> 41:50.320]  leave my office I was there reading these documents I mean what is the normal
[41:50.320 --> 41:56.080]  response what am I supposed to do I don't want to sell advertising I don't
[41:56.080 --> 42:02.080]  care about changing the oil in my car I don't care about dressing nice I don't
[42:02.080 --> 42:06.520]  care about being well-known in the media I don't have all these petty rivalries
[42:06.520 --> 42:11.320]  and things I mean I we all do to a certain extent but those those areas in
[42:11.320 --> 42:17.360]  me my ego is dissipating I actually kind of need my ego we all do to propel
[42:17.360 --> 42:30.040]  ourselves forward and I'm losing it because the reality of my food my water
[42:30.040 --> 42:36.000]  the vaccines being poisoned and having all the proof the proof they're
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.360]  drugging the water and food the proof they're adding bio weapons to the
[42:40.360 --> 42:44.000]  vaccines the proof they're designing pharmacological crops and
[42:44.000 --> 42:51.440]  pharmacological chimera fish and pigs and other meat products designed to
[42:51.440 --> 42:55.840]  brain damage us give us cancer and sterilizes I mean it doesn't get any
[42:55.840 --> 43:02.040]  more heavy than that have you seen the end of the famous 1950s body snatchers
[43:02.040 --> 43:08.480]  guys pull up the end the end of a body snatchers the end of the original body
[43:08.480 --> 43:14.720]  snatchers I guarantee it's on YouTube it's not the one of the 70s you know
[43:14.720 --> 43:18.360]  where she's in the park in DC and says is that you and then her friends been
[43:18.360 --> 43:23.720]  turned into one and he he hisses at her not that one it's it's the one where
[43:23.720 --> 43:27.360]  the doctor sees the town get taken over so he's running through the hills his
[43:27.360 --> 43:31.720]  wife gets turned into one she falls asleep now she's after him he's running
[43:31.720 --> 43:36.200]  through the hills he runs out on the highway from Bakersfield and he this
[43:36.200 --> 43:39.440]  truck almost runs over him and he climbs up in the back of the truck and it's
[43:39.440 --> 43:44.680]  the it's the pod people it's the pods and they're going into LA and he's
[43:44.680 --> 43:50.840]  screaming you're in danger they're everywhere runs for your lives but this
[43:50.840 --> 43:56.280]  hidden pod people carried on the solar winds by meteorites landing and taking
[43:56.280 --> 44:01.440]  over this is a group of scientific elites who've cold bloodedly decided to
[44:01.440 --> 44:05.640]  scientifically conquer society they say oh dictators didn't have it right
[44:05.640 --> 44:09.560]  we'll do it by stealth and with science we'll drug the food and water dumb them
[44:09.560 --> 44:14.160]  down put stuff in the vaccines this is in the 20s now I've got all their
[44:14.160 --> 44:19.320]  documents from the 50s 60s and 70s where they were planning it now they're doing
[44:19.320 --> 44:26.040]  it and it literally I should be running around in traffic I'm not saying do that
[44:26.040 --> 44:31.480]  I'm saying that's what that's the normal response screaming we're in danger
[44:31.480 --> 44:38.680]  they're taking over warn everyone I mean people should be on hunger strikes
[44:38.680 --> 44:44.560]  banner hangs state houses should have millions of people around them in
[44:44.560 --> 44:49.120]  throngs everyone should be freaking out but we've only discovered they're putting
[44:49.120 --> 44:54.400]  poisons in the water and food after they hit us the public's already been hit by
[44:54.400 --> 45:01.240]  this stuff they're already being inculcated into the brain damage they're
[45:01.240 --> 45:06.720]  already being inculcated into the mind control they're already brain damage
[45:06.720 --> 45:12.520]  that's why they can't get upset it's why they're listening to me now they can go
[45:12.520 --> 45:16.280]  find the documents they've even heard about it on mainstream news like oh we
[45:16.280 --> 45:22.280]  want to put lithium in your water and maybe we should sterilize people because
[45:22.280 --> 45:31.480]  we're already drugged now let me get back into the economy here it's the same
[45:31.480 --> 45:36.960]  thing on the economy we know they're starting to monetize the debt that is
[45:36.960 --> 45:43.600]  print money we know they've made this decision they're openly announcing the
[45:43.600 --> 45:46.840]  global government the new global digital currency the bandcore that
[45:46.840 --> 45:52.360]  everything else is going to be based on this is official IMF and I've got to sit
[45:52.360 --> 45:55.400]  here and watch Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh make fun of me look it's not
[45:55.400 --> 46:02.640]  funny when it's in the mainstream news and the drugs reports even linking to it
[46:02.640 --> 46:06.320]  and you guys are still running around denying it because you spent years saying
[46:06.320 --> 46:13.320]  it didn't exist we don't have time to screw around anymore I want Glenn back
[46:13.320 --> 46:17.760]  to talk about what's in the vaccines I want him to talk about the naked body
[46:17.760 --> 46:22.760]  scanners I want him to tell his audience to do more than just vote for
[46:22.760 --> 46:28.960]  Republicans look I just want my country and humanity back I mean look at this
[46:28.960 --> 46:34.600]  Bloomberg headline gold rallying to 1,500 is Soros bubble and flights and it
[46:34.600 --> 46:41.040]  goes on to say that the the most widely held options on gold futures traded in
[46:41.040 --> 46:49.640]  New York are $1,500 an ounce or 18% higher by December three months from
[46:49.640 --> 46:54.480]  now golds up over $13 today and they go on to say either a swift economic
[46:54.480 --> 46:58.760]  recovery or a further dismal economic performance should bring new buyers into
[46:58.760 --> 47:05.120]  the market said Eugene Weinberg an analyst with Commons Bank AG Frankfurt who
[47:05.120 --> 47:08.400]  was the most accurate forecaster in the first quarter and expects the metal to
[47:08.400 --> 47:17.520]  rise as high as 1,400 next year he's a stronger economy would create more of a
[47:17.520 --> 47:20.880]  jewelry demand if the economy stays weaker gets worse and investors will be
[47:20.880 --> 47:25.480]  looking for a safe haven and they go through either way you slice it but I'm
[47:25.480 --> 47:28.480]  gonna shut up and bring Ted Anderson up then I'm gonna get into Ron Paul
[47:28.480 --> 47:33.600]  questions whether there's gold at Fort Knox and the New York Fed this is a big
[47:33.600 --> 47:37.240]  deal been covering it since last week it's now getting mainstream news
[47:37.240 --> 47:41.040]  attention since Kitco interviewing we're gonna get him back on soon to give us
[47:41.040 --> 47:45.120]  the inside scoop but we know all the gold was stolen and sold into Europe we've
[47:45.120 --> 47:50.480]  got the pieces of intel on that but imagine Congress isn't allowed to find
[47:50.480 --> 47:54.800]  out where the gold's at we just trust the bankers so Ron Paul needs to stay out
[47:54.800 --> 47:59.560]  of airplanes I mean he is really has a lot of courage he came out three months
[47:59.560 --> 48:05.560]  ago and said the CIA has had a coup d'etat in America and deals the drugs I
[48:05.560 --> 48:12.400]  mean you want courage it's Ron Paul but I digress Ted I haven't even asked you
[48:12.400 --> 48:16.640]  today when I called you to come on you bought a bunch of gold when it was 60
[48:16.640 --> 48:22.000]  $70 lower did you run out of that gold when you bought it when gold was lower
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.880]  and what's today special I know I still have some of those items Alex we have
[48:26.880 --> 48:32.400]  the Frank at 270 they're trading closer to 275 right now we have the British
[48:32.400 --> 48:38.400]  sovereign at 340 they're closer to 345 walking Liberty haves at 975 those ones
[48:38.400 --> 48:43.400]  are trading well into the $10 a piece we do have bags of junk silver we have you
[48:43.400 --> 48:47.640]  know the US seagull we even have some buffaloes but you're talking about yeah
[48:47.640 --> 48:52.840]  the jewelry the jewelry for India alone is going to go up from 400 tons last
[48:52.840 --> 48:58.080]  year 480 this year they're expecting to see it at about 625 I mean the demand
[48:58.080 --> 49:03.120]  for gold is going up like you said Soros you know just last January Soros
[49:03.120 --> 49:08.960]  Soros was a seller in gold calling gold one of the the asset bubbles of all
[49:08.960 --> 49:14.640]  time and now he's a buyer he's talking about 1500 dollar gold there's so much
[49:14.640 --> 49:19.360]  going on in the marketplace right now you're talking about the government
[49:19.360 --> 49:23.480]  knowing that we're running into a crisis not only do they know that we're
[49:23.480 --> 49:28.240]  running into a crisis they published a document on July 27th that says that
[49:28.240 --> 49:36.080]  they're expecting a crisis to the magnitude of what occurred in in Argentina
[49:36.080 --> 49:42.040]  in Brazil just recently in Greece that they're pinning us to that too and I
[49:42.040 --> 49:48.320]  had Ted your microphones cutting out there is it was probably my voice it's
[49:48.320 --> 49:54.200]  actually my voice was the microphone okay but recap what you were saying well
[49:54.200 --> 49:59.080]  I'm just saying that the government knows that we have problems they just they're
[49:59.080 --> 50:03.960]  they're aware of it they've published a document on July 27th that point set out

[54:13.080 --> 54:19.360]  okay ladies and gentlemen so you see all this media hype demonizing gold I've
[54:19.360 --> 54:23.040]  been watching it for eight nine years as it went from two hundred and sixty bucks
[54:23.040 --> 54:29.920]  an ounce to one thousand two hundred and sixty something and now the most widely
[54:29.920 --> 54:35.240]  held future option for the month of December is fifteen hundred dollars an
[54:35.240 --> 54:43.200]  ounce so that's how the insiders are betting on gold going to fifteen hundred
[54:43.200 --> 54:49.280]  dollars an ounce but meanwhile I hear Kramer telling people invest in stock
[54:49.280 --> 54:53.600]  that might give you two three four percent increase a year if you're lucky
[54:53.600 --> 54:58.720]  forget investing in gold where you can quadruple your money Ted yeah you know
[54:58.720 --> 55:02.080]  but there's a lot of motivation there because he handles stocks he's sitting
[55:02.080 --> 55:06.880]  there by Wall Street he's he's so much caught into that insider side of things
[55:06.880 --> 55:11.520]  that you know he you know he's he benefits from selling stocks but I can
[55:11.520 --> 55:16.120]  tell you gold hit twelve hundred and fifty dollars an ounce Alex that puts us
[55:16.120 --> 55:20.400]  ten dollars away from the market peak from the last one I expect that gold
[55:20.400 --> 55:25.120]  will be trading much higher than the last market peak before we even hit
[55:25.120 --> 55:30.080]  October and we're only in August right now August 31st and being ten dollars
[55:30.080 --> 55:35.360]  behind the market peak that's pretty darn strong I again I I would I would bet
[55:35.360 --> 55:39.960]  that George Soros is actually going to be right this time you know I mean he's a
[55:39.960 --> 55:44.720]  billionaire for a reason he's got the inside information I don't know why he
[55:44.720 --> 55:48.520]  was so influenced in the beginning of this year to tell people to get out of
[55:48.520 --> 55:53.000]  gold and that it was overinflated but he's reversed his his position you know
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.480]  180 degrees and and he's saying buy and he's buying it himself and he's
[55:57.480 --> 56:01.760]  expecting gold to hit fifteen hundred dollars an ounce I'm suspecting that he'll
[56:01.760 --> 56:06.000]  be right I mean the lowest prediction in that article that drudge is pointing
[56:06.000 --> 56:09.560]  toward over at Bloomberg is thirteen hundred and fifty dollars an ounce and
[56:09.560 --> 56:12.200]  that's a hundred dollars higher from where we are at right now I mean why
[56:12.200 --> 56:17.280]  wouldn't people buy gold coins that you have massively discounted that you bought
[56:17.280 --> 56:22.920]  back when gold was sixty seventy dollars lower a month ago why wouldn't they then
[56:22.920 --> 56:28.320]  get all those savings pass forward and then have all of this upside if they
[56:28.320 --> 56:32.400]  were getting it for an investment I get gold and silver as an emergency backup
[56:32.400 --> 56:38.440]  because I know the history of Germany and Zimbabwe and Europe and this country
[56:38.440 --> 56:43.600]  with devaluations of currency and I know that it's a great hedge against
[56:43.600 --> 56:47.360]  economic uncertainty and that's why Bloomberg says most people are getting
[56:47.360 --> 56:53.240]  into it and then I've got all this other news Ron Paul questions whether
[56:53.240 --> 56:57.160]  there's gold at Fort Knox New York and the Fed that's out of the Hill newspaper
[56:57.160 --> 57:02.640]  he first talked to Kitco last Wednesday we covered it then but here's Ron Paul
[57:02.640 --> 57:07.480]  coming right out and talking about the emperor's new clothes and saying where is
[57:07.480 --> 57:11.720]  all the gold because the Federal Reserve fights kicking and screaming to
[57:11.720 --> 57:16.320]  never allow anybody to see that gold dead well you know it just only makes
[57:16.320 --> 57:19.840]  sense that we audited it it's just one of those other things that the Federal
[57:19.840 --> 57:23.800]  Reserve wants to have secrecy they want to be able to move and move in a
[57:23.800 --> 57:28.040]  direction whichever they choose and they never want to be exposed and of course
[57:28.040 --> 57:31.400]  we the citizens of the United States should know how much gold is there they
[57:31.400 --> 57:36.280]  confiscated it from us in 1933 that's why it's there that's right for any
[57:36.280 --> 57:41.840]  Americans that think that government isn't tyrannical Rosa Velt said giving
[57:41.840 --> 57:46.360]  all your gold I'm gonna give you paperback and a year later basically
[57:46.360 --> 57:50.200]  double the price of an ounce and it turned out that the Firestone family
[57:50.200 --> 57:54.680]  and others had set up secret purchasing arms in Europe just trying to buy their
[57:54.680 --> 58:00.040]  own gold back and they got prosecuted that's how these bankers scam people so
[58:00.040 --> 58:05.280]  they hoarded our gold what was left they've already sold to themselves at
[58:05.280 --> 58:09.840]  discounted prices we need to be able to look at our gold and then arrest the
[58:09.840 --> 58:14.520]  Federal Reserve bank people I mean it's it's so simple Ted yeah it's so upside
[58:14.520 --> 58:18.560]  down though it's crazy call for the offer man I tell you now's the time to be

[58:58.960 --> 59:03.280]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[59:03.280 --> 59:07.240]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[59:07.240 --> 59:11.560]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[59:11.560 --> 59:15.920]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[59:15.920 --> 59:19.640]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.640 --> 59:23.800]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.800 --> 59:27.760]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:19.960]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:23.440]  Alex Jones
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.920]  coming up we're gonna discuss a host of issues with Joel Scalce and he was on
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.240]  with us for an hour last week I want to do most of two hours with him so we can
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:43.720]  have time to take your calls I know folks are holding we're gonna cover a lot of
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.800]  topics with Joel and take calls interspersed throughout the extended
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:51.520]  interview with him coming up also we're gonna be talking about control of food
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.400]  supply to be handed over to Department of Homeland Security and this is
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:02.560]  directly out of S510 deceptively titled the Food Safety and Modernization Act
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:07.440]  I'm gonna be talking more about that but getting back into financial news this
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:12.640]  is Bloomberg talking to top analysts they say the most accurate analyst predicts
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.780]  that it's gonna be $1,400 an ounce by the end of this year but the most
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:23.480]  widely held future option on gold is 1,500 by December or an 18 percent
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:28.600]  increase and they go on to admit this is because the federal government has
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:32.160]  announced that they're gonna allow the private Federal Reserve to start
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.640]  monetizing the debt that's what happened in Weimar Republic Germany it's what
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:43.080]  happened in Zimbabwe it's what's happening all over the planet in fact in
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:51.400]  my wallet I've actually got a Zimbabwe and note that a British media guy was
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:57.360]  here doing an interview for a magazine with me it's in here somewhere here it
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:03.920]  is and he was here and he gave me this in fact I'll show folks a document cam
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:17.200]  shot of this this is the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and that is a 50 million or
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:24.280]  no no 50 trillion excuse me 50 trillion dollar note and currently this is what
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:31.440]  you need to go out and basically buy a small meal so if you want to go into one
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:37.040]  of their restaurants and have a bowl of rice and maybe some beef stew and a glass
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:47.520]  of Pepsi you need is that 50 trillion or 500 trillion 50 trillion you need a 50
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:52.360]  trillion dollar note these British reporters were actually over there doing
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:56.680]  a report on it and they said you could you could buy a small meal with this now
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:00.920]  this is how inflation works and they've done in Argentina this is what these
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:05.480]  bankers do they inflate the money to buy real assets while they're in control then
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:09.840]  they leave you holding the bag and tell you with tax money you've got to pay all
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.920]  this off just like Obama has spent more than all presidents before him combined
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:18.800]  as bad as George W. Bush was as you go towards the end of this it accelerates
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.960]  and I've got other financial news again Ron Paul saying where's the missing gold
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:28.960]  India's growth rate is 8.8 as our growth rate stalls at 1.6 homeless up 50% in

[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:11.160]  banks of junk silver obviously are great by the the walking Liberty halves at
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:23.760]  900 or $9.75 cents each the 800 number here is 1-800-686-2237 again 1-800-686-2237
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:28.840]  if nothing else read that cbo document man that is like just that tells the
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:34.040]  story right there what we need 4,000 more regulators to cover this s5 10 that
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.440]  you just mentioned a little bit earlier that's gonna cost us billions of
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:42.560]  dollars that the United States don't have what do you think gold's gonna do
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:47.120]  well look I only promote what I believe in private property second amendment

[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:57.360]  1950s and no we're not saying aliens are real or pod people are coming to get us
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:03.440]  but that's the feeling I have a lot when I'm reading a Rockefeller Foundation
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:09.760]  document about how they did develop vaccines where it's a tetanus
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:17.600]  pathogen with a female hormone added to it to sterilize the woman from 1968 and
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:22.640]  we link to those at info wars dot com on the Rockefeller Foundation website
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.440]  they're proud of this and then I've got mainstream news articles from the 90s
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:33.120]  where the UN was caught sterilizing women with these vaccines and then I get
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.240]  John P. Holdren's book the White House science are about drugging the water
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:42.360]  supply and then we discover they're already testing it and you tell people
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:47.160]  this and it sounds crazy just like 15 years ago when I got secret documents
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.600]  from a nurse that all children at birth had their blood taken for a secret
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:58.080]  eugenics database that's now declassified last two years there is a
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:04.880]  giant secret overarching program run by what the establishment calls the
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:11.800]  scientific dictatorship the final revolution to end the family to remake
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:19.520]  man in a image of their choosing now I got a lot of subjects I want to discuss
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:24.520]  in the next hour and 50 minutes with Joel Scalcin we also have loaded phone
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:28.360]  lines you can talk on any issue it's been many years since I had him on I had
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:32.560]  him on last week it had been in many years since he'd been on when I had him
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:38.160]  on last week and I wanted to have him on for an extended interview to cover a
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.600]  bunch of issues quickly to get his take his view because it's thought
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:46.600]  provoking and insightful on a host of issues and also take your comments or
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:53.360]  questions at 1-800-259-9231 and so he was on with us a few
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:59.120]  weeks ago he is back with us today and of course he is the editor of world
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:05.600]  affairs brief he of course is the nephew of Cleon Scalcin who wrote two best
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:09.040]  selling books exposing the whole globalist system the whole new older
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.360]  system that was really a seminal work that led to none dare call a conspiracy
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.200]  and many others he's worked of course serve as a fighter pilot for the US
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:22.600]  Marine Corps during Vietnam and of course has also been a writer and
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.800]  researcher speaking widely around the United States in the world very accurately
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:32.080]  exposing the globalist agenda and world affairs brief calm is his website and he
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:37.360]  joins us now Joel good to have you here with us thank you Alex it's good to be
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:42.320]  with you I must say I was surprised at the overwhelming response that I was
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:47.400]  getting a world affairs brief after our interview it just seems like people are
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.000]  hungry to make sense of some of these contradictions they're out there there's
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.600]  just an awful lot of disinformation of a lot of problem in our nation now
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:00.120]  floating on the web and people listen I think to your show to get some
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:05.760]  understanding about that well we have a wide spectrum of guests and ideas here
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.280]  but at the end of the day we've been pretty accurate about forecasting where
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.560]  society is going and I concur with much of your analysis and breakdown of
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:18.360]  society I want to move through a lot of news with you today but last time you
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.720]  were on we ran out of time getting into one section of the world affairs brief
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.440]  you did a month or two ago dealing with the dark side of law enforcement in the
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.760]  military and how Iraq and Afghanistan were being used as laboratories to find
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:38.320]  people that will do bad things the majority of our military and police are
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:43.520]  great people I meet them all the time I run into them literally every time a
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:48.200]  police car drives by when I'm walking my dog or I'm in a coffee shop or walk out
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:52.840]  of a restaurant and police come over and their oath keepers their patriots they
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:57.520]  would laugh at us ten years ago but they heard us talk about this stuff and now
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:01.680]  ten years later they've seen it all come true so they're really paying
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.600]  attention now so I know they're good men and women but for every ten good
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:12.960]  officers they find that sociopath that psychopath that control freak who's
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.320]  attracted to power and they recruit them and I've been aware of this for my own
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.880]  research and also studying other authoritarian systems like the Nazis
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.520]  and others and the communist but but you say you've got a lot of sources and
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:28.680]  have done some of your own research on it so I'd like you to spend the balance
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.640]  of this segment on that then we'll spend a segment on whatever issue you think is
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.720]  most important and then I've got a bunch of questions I want to throw at you on
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:43.120]  a laundry list of issues and then phone calls Joel great you're referring to my
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.680]  article commenting on top secret America the hidden world growing beyond
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:52.400]  control the Washington Post put out and as I point out you know whenever a
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:57.520]  shield for the government put that a supposed expose a about government it's
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.960]  a cover it's a diversion because what they will reveal will be enticing will
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.080]  be interesting and they do drop a few secrets here and there nothing harmful
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.840]  to the system but what was totally missing from this whole eight-part series
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.320]  on top secret America with anything of substance about what is being done in
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:20.240]  secret the difference between what I call the white side of government and the
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:25.440]  black side and increasingly what's been happening in the United States is the
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:31.480]  black side has been growing by leaps and bounds in just to recap for your
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:36.240]  listeners in every law enforcement agency of the United States federal
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:43.120]  government whether it is the DEA the CIA the FBI the INF ICE the immigration is
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.800]  custom enforcement there are good guys white side people the type of people
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:52.080]  that you were mentioning and talking about the type of people we expect to be
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:56.240]  in there and they still recruit for that side specifically they like to recruit
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:01.080]  a lot of Mormons for example have been returned missionaries clean cut they
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.280]  make good naive government supporters they come into the CIA and FBI and they
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.040]  make good believers because they're taught religiously to support their
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.440]  government and to support law and order but you know that could be a fault when
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:19.160]  you refuse to see what you see and what happens in government and so there's an
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:25.560]  increasingly active dark side of every organization I'm convinced now Alex that
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:30.120]  the dark side of government because of the increase in the use of private
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:37.040]  military contractors to breed and co-out and to recruit unprincipled people has
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:41.400]  grown to be larger than the white side on every one of these organizations now
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:46.280]  and that's a scary thought they're bigger than the white side now and it's
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:51.400]  becoming increasingly difficult to hide the activities of dark side now that's
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.480]  one of the reasons why I think top secret America was written was to hide
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:17:01.480]  behind the excuse of overgrowth over complexity over 2,000 private military
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:07.360]  contractors dealing with hundreds of federal agencies some of them with no
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:12.560]  names that we don't understand that are hidden behind multiple layers in the
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:16.680]  government but I'm convinced this whole thing is a charade to make sure that
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.880]  people have an excuse to be able to write this off as well we can't understand
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:25.800]  it it's just too complex now and that was the purpose of the of the Washington
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:34.480]  Post article well they say 854,000 spies but if you look at InfraGuard the
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:40.240]  clergy response teams the Protestants the Catholics the Mormons the rabbis
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:46.280]  they have all as part of a nine-year-old program now been infiltrated and
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:50.760]  taught when the martial law comes tell them go to the FEMA camps I mean this
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:55.320]  is in the documents that we got three years before it was mainstream news then
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:58.760]  they had mainstream newscasts with preachers going yes during martial law
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:02.480]  the enemy of the government is the people not the people are the government
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.320]  and the government serves them in the Bill of Rights and Constitution and so
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:11.120]  there is this giant complex of control and and even though a lot of it's been
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:16.040]  secret we've gotten a lot of the different pieces of it from good people
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.720]  inside government and then later the establishment comes out and kind of
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:24.560]  hides it in plain view and puts their own spin on it but this isn't the
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:29.080]  American way this is more like the East Germans to have you know secretly
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:36.680]  controlling the churches and recruiting executives to serve as as spies and then
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:41.760]  you look at the architecture Joel the whole thing is pointed at gun owners
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:46.840]  conservatives libertarians returning veterans as the Mayak and Homeland
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:51.280]  Security reports show none of it is pointed except for PR purposes on the
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:58.560]  surface at Muslims at Alciatus absolutely correct one of the things we have to
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:04.240]  understand however is that this this program of integrating naive church
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:10.440]  people into the system is informal at best it is not knit together in a closed
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:15.760]  completely numbered call one two three and and this is guaranteed to happen
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:20.360]  they're heading that way in the future but we're actually quite a long way off
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.360]  from that they're still in the building process of seeing who can be snookered
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:28.680]  into supporting these without having any warning signals go up and it isn't
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.120]  uniform you can't make the case for example that you know all the
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:36.760]  fundamentalist Christian leaders or Protestant leaders are into this it's
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:41.920]  only a small percent no exactly it's a beta test to then see who will take the
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:46.240]  bait who will go along with it and to find out who sees it and who resisted
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.840]  exactly Joel stay there let's keep talking about that and finish your

[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:31.080]  okay Joel it's key what you said here though because that's what they're
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:35.000]  doing that's how I got this from preachers is they they told the preachers
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.720]  hey would you like to get some federal funding to just be on the lookout for
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:43.600]  al-qaeda they have the same program for truck drivers and people in critical
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:48.200]  infrastructure or infra-guard and you come down the FBI pays for it puts you
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.880]  in a hotel for the weekend the first 10 minutes they show al-qaeda training
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:56.860]  videos then they cut to is your neighbor spanking their kid do you smell
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:01.640]  marijuana you know is this person a patriot I mean I mean we've gotten
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.560]  footage that people shot at these meetings and the founding fathers were
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:11.120]  terrorists I mean I actually have video of this and so so they find out who buys
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:17.640]  into it so 90% leave disgusted but they find the 10% that either like the
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:23.440]  tyranny or are gullible but as you said just like it took them decades to make
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:29.280]  the dark side as big or bigger than the light side now they're trying to to
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:35.040]  take over any area of influence and convert it to the dark side how long
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:41.280]  till they convert well this is awfully hard to to document because as I say
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:46.200]  there is a great deal of signing documents saying that you won't reveal
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:49.000]  anything about what you're showing at these presentations that's very
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.840]  difficult to get people to talk I can tell you that psychologically they're
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:58.600]  really playing up in Christianity by making it a beleaguered profession or
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:03.200]  beleaguered religion so that they induce people who want to get the
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:08.160]  protection of government that's how they've duped in an awful lot of what
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:13.320]  used to be very very conservative religious people whether it was you know
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:18.200]  Paul well or Dobson or many of those other people got to buy into supporting
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:21.560]  the Republican establishment even though they were being betrayed by the
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.440]  Republican establishment during the Bush year was that that that the
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:30.120]  licitation of the concept that you can't be mainstream you can be protected we
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:34.620]  won't criticize you I will give you good press we'll make sure that good
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:38.600]  articles are written on you in time in Newsweek and that's what they got good
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:45.000]  press and believe me a lot of those people because the our true side as you
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:53.360]  know Alex has very very limited funding and everybody's looking out for and
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.320]  they find out when you take a hard line stand that your funding kind of drives
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:00.320]  up and that's one of the reasons why I'm really skeptical of what happens in the
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:04.680]  tea party when you have big dollar people come in and start to finance things
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:08.920]  within the parties we find out they're not on our side it's foreign money coming
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:12.240]  in it's money from the establishment trying to take over things and that's
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:17.080]  what's happened in our religious you don't use as well but I can't tell you
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:21.360]  in answer to your question how far they've got along I do know that they're
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:28.120]  making steady progress and they're converting one person at a time and it's
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:31.200]  just like that in the private military contractor routine they're going through a
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.000]  sifting process that's why this is not about to end the story about cars I
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.080]  threatening to throw up to private military contractors within four months
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.680]  in Afghanistan I can guarantee you will not happen absolutely will not happen
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:49.120]  whether or not he's even being sincere in saying this I'm not sure because he
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.800]  may be doing it to protect his own survival within Afghanistan which is
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:28:00.160]  growing in hatred against the sabotage of private military contractors he even
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.520]  mentioned on one of the news shows that they've been involved in terrorism and
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:07.720]  that's a they're basically acting as a cover for the dark side of us da
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:12.400]  activities who do control their own set of terrorists for conflict creation and
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:17.080]  the private military contractors are increasing taking those roles because
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:20.320]  when they use military to people do they have too many whistleblowers yeah let's
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:25.240]  not move exactly gives another membrane of deniability but but you you just
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:29.640]  mentioned something key contractors staging their own terror attacks they've
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:35.160]  caught British SAS operating as contractors and others dressed up as
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:40.400]  Muslims attacking our installations and that's the reports that come out again
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:44.880]  and again and again if you've got a trillion dollar a year global war machine
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:50.520]  of course it's going to create the enemy and if it has to stage its own attacks
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:57.200]  as a pretext to continue that war of global domination well as we've talked
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:00.800]  about in our last interview I think the the motive is not simply the
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.960]  industrial military complex in gaining more riches and making people that's
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:10.240]  always an inducement to be sure but it's not the main goal I think the main goal
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:16.040]  is to create constant warfare for the purpose of rearranging the chess pieces
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:20.680]  on the world chess board of government and working towards a new world order
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:24.800]  government I know you agree with that we mustn't keep but we must have moved
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:30.000]  side of the fact that these more ethereal goals about creating conflict for
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.880]  the purpose of even larger wars and rearranging governments on the space of
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:37.840]  the world is what they're really after all right Joel stay there long segment

[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:31.400]  okay I got a lot of questions I want to throw at Joel Scalzen just to get his
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:37.120]  view on the mosque situation at ground zero the Bloomberg saying that most
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:42.680]  analysts agree that gold's gonna be $1,500 an ounce by December what's
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:47.480]  happening with our economy but also bigger issues like what are they getting
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:51.160]  the chessboard ready for if the globalist could have everything they
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:56.280]  wanted now what type of world would they build from his research what is their
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:00.160]  endgame I mean I know what their endgame is but I want to get his
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:04.480]  perspective on that I mean I've got it right here from the UN it's global
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:11.440]  population reduction and the end of humanity as we know it a total control
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:18.040]  freak wonderland where you've got basically a genetically engineered
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:22.640]  suboid servant class serving the global controllers but we'll get Joel
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:26.520]  Scalzen's take on that and yeah it sounds like science fiction it's the
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.080]  21st century ladies and gentlemen this has been their plan for at least a
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:34.800]  hundred years before we go back to Joel Scalzen of world affairs brief.com I
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:40.840]  wanted to let folks know this is the most popular special we've ever done we
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:49.040]  are offering five films for $9.95 five of my documentary films well one of the
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:52.880]  films is one I consulted on but the point is it exposes the phony drug war
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:58.360]  how we'd won the West but Terror Storm a history of government sponsored
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:04.840]  terrorism American dictators shattering the left-right paradigm Aaron Russo's
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:09.600]  reflections and warnings minor view with Aaron Russo to documentary fabled

[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:31.320]  offered five films 9.95 that's basically at cost I think we've done the math we
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:36.280]  make about no no that's not true because I had to pay six dollars a piece for that
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:41.120]  weed one the West actually lose money on this I'm sorry I was counting it as one
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:45.360]  of my films like a dollar 50 a piece or so so the point is I'm losing money on
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:52.360]  this I just want to get them out to people 9.95 info wars.com okay going
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:57.960]  back to Joel Scalson great analyst and researcher finish up with the point you
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:03.200]  were making before the break and then and then whatever you think is most
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:08.520]  important today then I want to take some phone calls and when we start the next
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:13.320]  hour I'll continue with calls but I've got a laundry list of questions that I
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:18.200]  want to go over with you today Joel Scalson but but what is what is most
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:22.320]  concerning you right now what do you think is most important right now it's
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:27.600]  sounds like going to break you were hinting the co-opting of the Tea Party
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:32.120]  which we know was founded by the Ron Paul movement he wrote an editorial that
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:39.440]  was published yesterday it's up on info wars.com saying that the Republicans
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.120]  are controlled by the very same globalist where they have better rhetoric
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:48.240]  they are the same people and basically warning that Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:57.200]  are bad news and that they're not really giving people the truth but Joel Scalson
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:01.280]  what do you think is most important before I go to the some of those big
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:06.240]  picture items and it's very true that the co-opting of the of the resistance
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:10.880]  movement is the most important criteria for them right now and I'll explain I
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:13.680]  think how they're going to they're doing that but before we leave the secret
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:18.080]  America thing I really want to take a few minutes to give some very good
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.880]  specifics to your audience about how they recruit people how they operate
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:25.720]  within the dark side how they get people to cross over from the white side to the
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:29.720]  to the dark side because I think this is fascinating to people and they need to
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:33.920]  understand this when their children go into the military or when they naively
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:40.720]  going to work for the FBI or the CIA or the DEA how this process happens
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:44.560]  oftentimes we stay too general and I want to give some specifics before we go
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:49.240]  on I once had a friend of mine who happened to be a Mormon a lot of
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:52.680]  Mormons are recruited into the CIA and the FBI because they've got that clean
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:58.160]  cut image and they are very pro-american they are very patriotic well he got
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:01.480]  assigned overseas because a lot of Mormon return missionaries have these
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:05.680]  language skills they speak all the languages of the world and that's why
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:11.200]  they're very anxious to get them into the CIA so he got assigned overseas and
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:15.480]  he was at a hotel one night and it got a knock on the door and there was a very
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:21.560]  good-looking woman and she there to offer her services and he said no no you
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:25.280]  know I don't do that kind of thing I'm not introducing you she said no no it's
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:29.520]  okay it's already paid for and when he said well paid for by who and he said
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:35.280]  you know I eat the company your agency and he was kind of shocked it just
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.440]  ah come on you know it says no no it's all paid for it you know can I come in
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.480]  and he said no they shut the door on it well the next morning he talked to some
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:49.880]  of his other cohorts and they'd all had similar knocks on the door and most of
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:56.560]  them had accepted and he said from that time on his career went nowhere yeah he
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:02.760]  could still say the CIA but he was not getting promoted he was not in fact he
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:06.200]  was hinted at in his annual review and said well you know you're just gonna
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:10.240]  kind of stay at the same level and that was only the first test and then we see
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:16.200]  scone bones that founded CIA homosexual type activity and at Bohemian Grove
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:20.360]  Nixon wouldn't protect but he told Harper's magazine that basically to get
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:26.120]  involved in California politics you got to go in there and and have gay sex and
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:30.920]  so if he would have had sex with that you know number 10 hooker and I've
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:34.320]  never been in an intelligence agency but I've had him send beautiful hookers
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:41.840]  at me same deal repeatedly but side issue the point is if any of you accept
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:48.000]  that it gets worse and worse serpico of course the New York City narcotics
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.920]  detective it was hey take this free diamond necklace give it to your girlfriend
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:55.920]  no I'm not gonna take it and the and his and his partner slam the brakes on it
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:00.240]  said well you're not gonna be part of this team but but Joel please continue
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:04.960]  yeah what I'm trying to get at is that there are ways which and there's a
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:08.480]  corruption is always the issue that got to make sure that you're morally
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:13.560]  corruptible because they do not want that they like to have people who have a
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:17.400]  clean cut appearance who can fool other people but they want to make sure that
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:21.480]  they're corruptible and that's why in the military a lot of the CIA now
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:27.640]  recruiters are our our military officers they basically taken aside by the CIA
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:31.640]  they've done really well we want you to recruit for us they don't even have to
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:36.320]  be corrupt themselves but they but they usually are but generally speaking they're
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:40.760]  meant to look out and taught how to psychologically profile people that they
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:45.320]  want to bring in undercover under the CIA that's how Timothy put they got
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:49.280]  recruited it's very interesting that Timothy Vannell tell the specific
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:54.240]  incident that he was in the military he was doing a lot of really doing well he
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:57.280]  had a lot of good reports he was very people's oriented he had a good
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:02.560]  leadership report he got recruited into the CIA by one of his officers and what
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:07.200]  they do it's just like CIA sheep dipping people or calling them out of the
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:12.280]  service they go to work for someone in the private sector and in this case but
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:16.640]  they're always missing for about a year or two Timothy from the Bay was missing
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:21.000]  and no contact with his family for over a year and when he finally surfaced to
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:26.200]  show up and to take a job at various private security companies and the CIA
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:31.360]  has a lot of operators that deal with private security companies like Wacken
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.600]  Hut and others that are essentially CIA fronts that's how they get their agents
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:39.840]  and work their deals in the prison that's how they put the screws on people in
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:44.520]  prisons because they can essentially you know get things done through these
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:50.560]  private agencies but he went through and all of a sudden his modus operandi
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:56.680]  changed his report said that he couldn't be trusted to deal with other people he
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:00.640]  fly off at the handle he was very argumentative if you gave him a
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:04.440]  specific assignment yes and guard at this particular door he'd do that just
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:08.520]  fine but he was incapable of thinking for himself anymore he had be told
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:13.920]  everything now that's a at complete variance to what his record was in the
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.400]  military before he was recruited out now some people suspect that during this
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:23.960]  two-year period be people that are being trained to do a suicide attack or
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:29.560]  something like he did at Oklahoma City bombing go on to some form of drug
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:34.200]  therapy mind control and other things now as I've studied the mind control issue
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:39.920]  Alex I don't believe they could take normal people and and change them
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:43.360]  against their will but they can take corruptible people under the influence
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:48.440]  of drugs and severe hostile type training and destabilize them to the point
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:54.120]  where they make them extremely subjective to hypnosis and to demand the
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:58.240]  leadership well sure but we know that Jolly and West the number two mind
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:03.160]  control doctor under Ewing Cameron who was even in the MK ultra congressional
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:07.440]  hearings was with him from the time he was arrested till the time he was
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:12.760]  executed and nobody put in the mainstream media said why is a top mind
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:18.240]  control doctor McVeigh psychiatrist and you would watch him on the news he was
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:22.560]  bombed out of his mind I mean I'm not a cop who's an expert on somebody on
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:26.120]  drugs but you can look at somebody when their eyes are glassy and they're
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:30.320]  clearly on drugs I mean McVeigh in those 60-minute interviews look like a drug
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:36.360]  head versus people that were near him in the jails and I've interviewed some of
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:40.360]  them and McVeigh was like look I was recruited into the CIA we know he was
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:45.040]  videotaped at a demolitions base a year and a half after he was supposedly out
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.280]  we know that's confirmed of course Terry Nichols is now signed to sworn
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:54.160]  affidavit that McVeigh said he was being set up so instead of just mind control
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:58.760]  clearly mind control and drugged so he's incoherent once they've caught him but
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:03.360]  he thought he was part of a larger operation to set up the white
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:07.480]  supremacist Southern Poverty Law Center run it came out in federal documents and
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:12.960]  that he was being set up and clearly he was then finally set up so it's kind of
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:18.480]  like Lee Harvey Oswald who we now know was admitted CIA right then set up but
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:22.720]  look at the pattern here John Hinckley the assassin of Ronald Reagan disappeared
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:27.480]  for two years his parents didn't know where he was he surfaced only once and
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:32.320]  that was to fulfill an appointment with the psychiatrist to to set up his
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:37.080]  bona fide there's someone who had mental problems which provided his defense
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:43.560]  and he was world vision and so was the guy that shot of course the famous
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:49.240]  beetle so a John Lennon John Lennon right and they love to use missionary
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:54.440]  fronts as mind control camps because it's overseas that's right I mean even
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:59.040]  going back to Jack Anderson the follow-on journalist yellow journalist after
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:04.880]  Drew Pearson Jack Anderson came home as a Mormon missionary disappeared for two
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:10.840]  years surfaced in China of all places didn't speak China Chinese but surfaced
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:14.520]  in China had undergone language training and then suddenly came out and
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:18.000]  went into the journalistic world working for Drew Pearson but the guy was never
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.720]  active as a Mormon again he had lost his principles he was immoral he had all
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:29.000]  these you know bad habits but you know how do you just disappear come out of
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.320]  China and then go work for Drew Pearson in a major Washington Marigold around
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:38.640]  the scenario it's very interesting that later on in his life he kind of had a
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:44.040]  bout of repentance and he told Howard rough started to you know get to him
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.800]  about you know I've got a change I've been at the black side for so many years
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:52.360]  I've got to get out of this I'm going to get killed and kind of had a mea culpa
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:57.680]  moment and unfortunately he never got out even though he tried to turn around and
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:05.280]  tried to leave the dark side he was he never told tales about how he got to
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:09.520]  where he was and who was controlling him during the day who was feeding him
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:13.560]  information from the left when he was sabotaging honest out is the most of
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:18.960]  Nicaragua and doing the hatchet job that the people like you know these special
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:23.160]  reporters that work for the CIA I do as Drew Pearson used to do he did a hatchet
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:28.120]  job on General Patton he was the one who revealed the slapping incident come to
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:32.880]  find out of course Paul S. Allen his his partner in Washington Marigold used to
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:37.560]  be on the staff of General Patton and he is suspected of having leaked the
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:41.400]  information to Pearson and that's how John Paul S. Allen got a
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:46.920]  delig with Pearson later on after he Patton was killed they did a hatchet
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:52.560]  job on Forest Hall the Admiral you know who was like MacArthur trying to have a
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:58.600]  strong defense against Truman's sabotage Forest Hall then ended up being thrown
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:02.760]  out of a window at Bethesda Naval Hospital that ruled a suicide I mean
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:08.160]  dark stuff in this government is just incredible what we know it's just the
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:13.320]  tip of the iceberg and now we know it's a giant submerged iceberg and I agree
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:17.760]  with you that they've converted more than half of the people in these private
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:23.480]  and public bureaucracies into the dark side where they're compromised and that's
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:28.560]  why I speak to them so often on air and I point out look you're going to be
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:33.120]  destroyed at the end of this and and in every case in history when these
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:38.280]  tyrannies fully come to power which the systems attempting to do right now the
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:43.360]  first group they wipe out are the people that brought them to power because you
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:48.360]  know where the bodies are buried and you understand how to overthrow them and so
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:52.880]  you are in more danger than somebody who's on the light side who's actually
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:57.680]  fighting the dark side but once you've ever taken anything from the dark side
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:03.440]  they then see it that they own you it's almost like a spiritual principle and
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:08.680]  I've seen more and more historians talk about this I've experienced it I have
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:13.600]  never done anything on the dark side I have never compromised in any way and
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:20.960]  it's almost like the globalists will demonize you and try to stop you but but
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:24.400]  they a lot of times don't physically come after you I've seen them though
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:29.600]  really go after their minions if they ever try to wake up it's really true
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:34.120]  they are disposable and I really if any of those people are listening I mean
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:37.160]  there's hundreds of people out there who are demolition experts that put
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:40.680]  charges in the World Trade Center there are hundreds and thousands of people
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:44.480]  who worked on underground military bases and other special prison camps that
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:48.280]  built these facilities and believe me it's amazing how well they keep the
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:52.080]  secret of what they're doing think of the Greenbrier and the underground
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:55.480]  bunker system was built there and literally they had hundreds and hundreds
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:50:00.280]  of workers building this very interesting underground bunker system and the
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:04.800]  word simply did not leak out it was just incredible how did it but we need
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:08.680]  whistleblowers to come forward that's the reason Alex that they've gone to
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:13.320]  private military contractors rather than people in the military they did it all
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:18.040]  through the 80s trying to swear military people to secrecy people who flew
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:21.680]  drugs in their helicopters down to South America during the Iran contra thing
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:26.520]  who flew it back to main Arkansas one of them having an open mic when Bill
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:31.280]  Clinton was on board and talking about how much money it was getting from you
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:36.560]  know the Arkansas bond fund and his relationship with the PIA and he had an
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:40.440]  open mic didn't realize the pilots were we're hearing it and of course the
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:44.360]  pilots had to be threatened to death to keep the secret they eventually leak
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:47.960]  things out we need more leakers if anybody's listening stay there let's
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:51.440]  come back and take calls and we'll get back into leakers and how we can bring
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:56.040]  this system down Joel Scals is our guest I'm Alex Jones World Affairs brief
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:02.120]  dot com our website's a prison planet dot TV and info wars dot com hi this is

[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:13.600]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:17.040]  true seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:20.960]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science

[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:13.360]  phone calls here I've got a bunch of other questions that I want to get Joel's
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:19.760]  expert take on but I do before he leaves this so remind me if I forget Joel and
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:26.880]  sometime the next hour let's get back into your ideas of how to get contractors
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:33.080]  or government people to safely be able to blow the whistle because they can have
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:37.760]  them sign agreements or whatever there's no Nuremberg defense of just
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:43.360]  following orders as you know but they're fully aware of the fact that they're
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:48.360]  under surveillance and they've got watchers watching the watchers and that's
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:56.120]  why they spend what 500 600 700 billion on budget for black ops a year a trillion
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:02.480]  plus on defense a lot of it is economic saboteurs spying on other
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:07.520]  corporations than giving it to the Chinese this is the globalist model
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:11.720]  bring the American people under control so we'll talk more about that but Jason
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:15.440]  Michael Paul Christopher Kenneth you've been holding patiently we're gonna start
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:20.440]  getting to your calls right now Jason Indiana you're on the air welcome hey
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:27.200]  Alex hey buddy I think whatever religion or belief we all need to pray
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:32.760]  every day for you and our country in the world and even pray for our enemies
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:37.800]  because by praying for enemies we don't dump it says in the Bible like hot coals
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:43.800]  on our head and I believe they believe in a spirit world and I believe there's
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:50.920]  power and prayer and I believe for every demon there's two angels and I also
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:57.240]  believe that we shouldn't fear them because it keeps us coming in a lower
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:03.760]  state I believe we're all energy and I also believe that people should go to
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:08.760]  town meetings and fight for clean water and rights to be able to have a yard
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:15.040]  sale or build a shed or whatever and I believe that we should like contact
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:20.320]  store manufacturers and stuff and tell them to you know get good food on the
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:24.480]  shells and well Jason I appreciate your call I want to get Joel's take on that
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:29.320]  but you just raised a bunch of issues they're trying to pass state laws they
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:33.280]  have passed federal laws with multi-million dollar fines for garage
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:39.680]  sales that's AP they are a SWAT teaming people selling vegetables on the side of
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:45.280]  the road they are doing everything they can to train us to be slaves and to
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:51.640]  train the police that it's normal for them to treat us like slaves and I I do
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:56.000]  agree with you that just getting out and being heard and saying no to what's
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:02.560]  happening is is is a large part of defeating the system Joel
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:08.720]  it's about prayer I think we do need the Lord's help I am not one of those
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:14.200]  believers however that you can simply pray that the Lord will make evil
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:19.960]  control people good he will not interfere with their free agency to to
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:25.760]  choose they have chosen the evil side I pray most precipitously to try to get
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:30.240]  good people to wake up and to be able to see wolves and sheets clothing but I
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:33.120]  don't think we can simply pray for everything we have to pray in an
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:36.320]  inspired manner we have to listen to the will of the Lord about what's
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:41.880]  appropriate to pray for and be guided by that Joel how do you deal with it
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:47.320]  psychologically or spiritually because one philosopher said when you stare into
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:51.440]  the abyss be careful you don't become the abyss or someone else said I forget
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:54.880]  who that when you dance with the devil the devil doesn't change he changes you
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:59.040]  just studying this every day and learning about the enemy and learning
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:03.720]  about their mind I've gotten to the point I've always been disgusted by it
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:09.480]  but but now it just gets worse and worse as I learn how they operate and what
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:12.720]  they think and get inside their heads and can see what they're seeing think
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:19.200]  what they're thinking it really really gets to me how do you deal with that
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:23.200]  well first of all I think you have to realize that you can't let it get to you
[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:28.120]  can't let it bother you it's we have to do what we can do and I don't try for
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:31.760]  example to change people who I feel resistance from I work with people who
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:34.880]  I spent they feel that something's wrong stay there let's come back in one
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:38.040]  minute stay there we got to come back in 70 seconds finish up that point and we're
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:41.800]  going to continue with your phone calls stay with us

[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:27.520]  okay got another hour with jones calcine in your phone calls have you just joined
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:32.040]  us i had to ask jones calcine world affairs brief we start you're an analyst
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:41.400]  studying the globalist prime syndicate how he deals with knowing all this
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:49.800]  information because i try to not let it get to me but it doesn't weave in what
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:54.840]  weigh me down or wear me out it more just disgust me it's kind of like i
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:59.840]  describe it as working you know around a bunch of rotten dead animals or
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:04.360]  something it's just disgusting i'm sick of it and i'm sick of how outrageous it's
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:09.320]  got and i know the globalist are trying to break our spirit break our will sell
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:16.680]  us on accepting anything and everything evil making us capitulate breaking our
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:22.160]  spirit i guess is the word but joel finish up your comment on that well you
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:26.240]  know i fought this thing battle for many many years and i finally got a handle on
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:32.280]  and i used to be very very depressed because not only was i discovering more
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:37.920]  and more evil and more and more collusion between government and judges
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:42.640]  everybody there's a great deal of involvement but it's interesting that as
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:46.880]  i i realized at some point you know i still have a life to live i've still
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:51.720]  got a family to attend to their important things to do you can't get
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:55.800]  borscht out of everything so i've learned to compartmentalize it just like
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:59.400]  my father who was the divorce attorney he decided to leave it at the office he
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:05.880]  did not bring it home and you have to do that but still i i don't walk around as
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:11.960]  a polyanna i don't try to use positive thinking garbage to explain this stuff
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:16.440]  away it's very real it's very serious but people need to realize because there's
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:20.640]  a lot of people on the fringe i mean my wife for example knows what i know that
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:25.920]  she doesn't feel as passionate as i do about it and i have to respect that most
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:29.640]  of your listeners are dealing with a spouse or friends or other people who
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:34.160]  just don't make me feel as passionate as you and i may feel about this and we
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:39.880]  have to give them space we have to not be too pushy on people and give them time
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:44.000]  to absorb they can give them credible information wait till they sense that
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.920]  something's wrong that alex takes the frustration away i've seen people
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:52.960]  literally destroy their marriages by going at this thing with the bludgeon
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:56.960]  trying to hit people over the head and say can't you see that this world is
[02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:02.040]  crumbling i think we have to look at it take this is a test we're all being
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:05.520]  tested this world to see who's going to see who's going to sense something's
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:10.440]  wrong and i try not to get in the way of people's blindness if they're willfully
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:14.840]  blind i'm going after the people who sense that something's wrong that i can
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:20.680]  influence well i agree with you on that issue and and plus this is important
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:25.640]  powerful info if you try to push it on people they automatically refuse but if
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:30.480]  you just state here's the facts this is the way it is and you know deep down
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:38.280]  that we're all in danger and society is unraveling by design so these globalists
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:44.800]  can build this nightmare system on its ashes and and and ten years ago i would
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:52.200]  get 50 50 positive you know 50% negative now it's got to be 90% positive i mean
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:57.200]  people are really starting to wake up that's why the system is injecting
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:04.000]  co-opted people green horns and and and that's all i see glenn beck is that one
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:09.360]  show all watching it's all truth the next show i watch it's neocon lies and he
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:12.880]  sells it like he really believes it a lot of the time but i see you know people
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:16.920]  like glenn beck is basically a green horn that they're handling and using
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:23.320]  well my view and i and i know quite a bit about glenn and in fact his mentor in
[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:28.680]  his conservative philosophy is my uncle w klaren scowler who's a great mentor but
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:33.120]  clearly been saw things to rose glally colored glasses it took me two solid
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:37.320]  until two years before he died alex before i could convince him that in
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:40.760]  fact bush was part of the problem that was not redeemable and the republicans
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:42.960]  were part of the problem this is incredible stay there you know i'd
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:48.160]  forgotten that glenn beck says what woke him up was your uncle's book our
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:52.160]  books and seminal writing so let's talk about that we come back and then to the
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:56.040]  phone calls i tell you should have been having jules calcine on years ago
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:05:03.400]  before all this just time flies stay with us you've heard alex explain how

[02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:26.760]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting world-wide it's Alex Jones
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:31.040]  let's go back to Joel Scalson I hate to get back into Glenn back here on the
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:38.200]  show but clearly you can see the media building him up for a fall making Glenn
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:44.480]  and Sarah Palin the leaders of the Tea Party and we know News Corps and Fox
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:51.040]  News is totally pro-New World Order they've denied world government made fun
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:55.320]  of it for decades now everything we talked about has come true everything
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:59.720]  Cleon Scalson talked about has unfolded everything Joel Scalson for 30 something
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:02.440]  years has talked about has happened everything I've been talking about for
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:09.480]  15 years is now out in the open and Glenn Beck says Cleon Scalson you know is
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:15.840]  his main political mentor and I guess spiritual mentor and you know we've got
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:22.160]  his nephew author and researcher on Joel Scalson right now and meanwhile he's
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:25.920]  saying if you're a 9-11 truth or your scum of the earth the army needs to be
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:32.320]  used against you Ron Paul's money bomb might want to blow things up and so I've
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:37.560]  really seen him you know go to the White House get orders from Bush come out and
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:42.960]  say there are no FEMA camps no plans for camps you know I see him going well the
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:47.200]  Mayak reports out there but it's not that bad and then I hear him on another
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:51.840]  show tell the truth here's an example here's this new book the Overton window
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:55.920]  there's a talk show host who gets the Mayak report from Homeland Security
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:10:00.680]  whistleblowers that was Alex Jones on record he knows that I and I you know
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:04.960]  this character Mr. Bailey about Alex Jones you know the same person stops a
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:09.800]  nuke being detonated in LA and the government is staging terror attacks
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:14.960]  then at the end of the book Beck says I don't believe government ever stages
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:21.280]  terror this is fiction but at the start of the book he says it's faction that is
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:29.640]  fiction that talks about facts so what double game is Glenn Beck pulling here
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:32.880]  and you're saying you know quite a bit about him and a lot of inside baseball
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:36.640]  and I know he has said that Cleon Scowles and your uncle the author is the
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:40.760]  person that woke him up and I know your uncle's books were excellent and and
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:45.280]  were seminal you know when did those books come out how many decades ago 30
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:50.320]  40 50 years ago that's right the person they could communist than they could
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:54.320]  capitalist and then of course he wrote the great beautiful volume the making of
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:59.480]  America a real seminal work his 5,000 year leap has gone to best-seller status
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:05.600]  because of Glenn Beck recommending it it's not quite as good frankly from my
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:10.960]  point of view as the making of America but at least it's done its job in terms
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:14.320]  of getting people to be interested in the Constitution and I think Glenn's
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:19.240]  done a great job about that he certainly boosted the movement but I think Alex
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:23.680]  what we're dealing with with both Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck's we're dealing
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:31.280]  with people who are controllable these are not evil people per se in fact Glenn
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:36.280]  Beck is not he's a very good person but he's unstable and he's controllable
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:41.400]  Sarah Palin is to a certain extent what I would call corruptible she's been
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:45.760]  corrupted by the money that has been offered her not only for the book deals
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:51.160]  but for the air for the private jet for the handlers all of this stuff is being
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:56.520]  paid for you know she was just on her flat on her back financially as
[02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:02.760]  governor of Alaska until they offered her this deal that she couldn't refuse now
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:07.080]  they've learned how to play Sarah Palin very very smart they have not told her
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:11.640]  alright you know we're in control you're gonna take orders from us but they
[02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:16.120]  know how to play her so to speak so that they can convince her to do stupid
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:21.080]  things like endorse John McCain percentage that other bad endorsements
[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:24.960]  that she's made Glenn Beck is a more complex character it comes from an
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:30.720]  unstable background alcoholism drug abuse you know some other things that I
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:35.240]  won't mention he's come from a rock music background background makes him a
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:40.320]  little bit unstable he shoots from the hip this is a person who can be
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:44.000]  manipulated to a certain extent now I don't believe you ever got any direct
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.960]  orders from Bush to deny FEMA camps this was a very interesting case whereby he
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:55.600]  was actually convinced that in fact there were camps and he even said so on
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:13:00.000]  the air on television he said tomorrow and then he got turned around it wasn't
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:03.600]  the direct turnaround you see where somebody came and said to him alright
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:07.720]  you're gonna do this and this and this it was through the use of me in the
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:12.040]  popular mechanics these were his independent experts there anything but
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:16.400]  independent they were recommended to me it from his Fox sources who is the
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:21.280]  controlled news organization as you said and it was through them explaining
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:24.200]  them that you know you don't want to get on the air explain this this is going
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:28.960]  to embarrass you and here's the real facts and he did not have and Glenn
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:32.840]  Beck continues to refuse to get alternative opinions I mean people have
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:36.920]  recommended and you need to talk to Joel Scow and he's Clems nephew and he
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:40.960]  won't do it because I've criticized it you know before and he's got a very thin
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:45.640]  skin and that's a problem you know when your ego gets too big and you won't take
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:50.560]  criticism but I could help him out a lot if he would be willing to take that but
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:55.720]  unfortunately I think he's gone so far down the bridge there down the river
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:01.480]  down in condemning conspiracy I happen to know from private sources that he
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:06.400]  actually is beginning to believe the conspiracy really occurs but he can't
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:11.280]  say so now he knows that he loses position on Fox news is and so he's
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:14.920]  been denial and he talks himself out of you know sincere people have this
[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:19.720]  problem Alex if they can't admit they were wrong many times they actually have
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:24.880]  to screw up their mind and convince themselves that what they feel is not
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:28.240]  right and that's what Glenn Beck says well yeah George Arwell called that
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:33.400]  crime stop if you're having a thought you know big brother is saying that he's
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:37.600]  always been at war with East Asia but just yesterday the news said that big
[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:42.000]  brother had never been at war with East Asia it's crime stop that when you
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:48.040]  realize that this is propaganda you convince yourself that no that's just a
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:53.160]  conspiracy theory but I mean the reports are you know that his mother died
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:59.600]  mysteriously probably suicide all these other weird family problems you know then
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:06.680]  he allows himself to be videotaped saying he fake cries on TV and I mean I
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:13.160]  see him and nobody's perfect as somebody who they're really building up to be
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:16.280]  the leader of the patriot movement because it was already there because of
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:20.520]  myself Ron Paul you know your uncle yourself and thousands of other
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:25.800]  prominent you know real people and that the system was losing credibility just
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:32.400]  denying that any of this exists so here comes Glenn Beck and he'll cover some of
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:38.680]  it but then discredit was real I mean FEMA camps under top-off 1 and 2 under
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:44.320]  the emergency centers act under all the military urban warfare drills under the
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:48.360]  civilian inmate labor camp program and by the way I sent this to him in the
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:53.880]  month that he was hyping that he thought it was real and that he was gonna be
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:58.280]  covering and I mailed it to Fox we had our listeners email him you know the
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:02.240]  army's own admissions that they can turn sports stadiums into camps in two
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:06.480]  hours that they do drills for shutting down cities I sent him their own
[02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:13.200]  admissions I sent him the 12 civilian inmate labor camp program areas I sent
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:20.360]  him Rex 84 documents Miami Herald congressional hearings and I then
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:27.000]  predicted that it was a sucker punch the week before I said I believe he's
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  gonna come out and point at two fake camps that I exposed more than a decade
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:37.160]  ago right and he did it and I thought that I was like psychic and could just
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:41.000]  get in his brain later I found out from high-level Fox News people who are
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:44.760]  actually patriots I'll just leave it at that one's a household name and others
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:51.160]  an executive that Glenn Beck Glenn Beck for years has at least one producer at
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:57.320]  sometimes five people listening to all my shows all my films and that Glenn
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:01.680]  Beck literally is obsessed with Alex Jones and this is from high-level
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:07.680]  people and it's just it's creepy Joel and I now I realize his job is
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:13.560]  basically to take my message make it palatable and neocon and sell it to
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:18.880]  people and yes he has two FBI retired agents that protect him I've got that
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:22.840]  from another high-level source he's totally scared of the public and he is
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:28.720]  starting to actually know this is all real but you're right he now he's gone
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:34.280]  too far I mean I guess he it's a very complex issue it's just it's creepy to
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:39.080]  have him writing a book where I'm basically the hero under a pseudonym but
[02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:42.440]  then at the end of the book he says it isn't real I mean is that a cry for help
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:47.920]  him saying look you know I know this is real I'm not bad or what is it well you
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:52.160]  know I think we have to understand that Glenn's a weak person he himself admits
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:56.400]  is a weak person and the establishment really loves to use that Sarah Palin's
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:00.480]  a weak person she's dynamic and she's beautiful and she has all of those things
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:06.080]  that make it a good manipulated ploy for people but I'm convinced that they're
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:10.240]  maintaining Palin they gave her her position on partners to increase her
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:14.160]  exposure they hit they could dump Clint Beck anytime they wanted to if they
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:18.520]  really but I think they like having a fallible foil out there in front of the
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:23.160]  people because at once in terms of credible independence Glenn Beck doesn't
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:27.000]  get a lot of traction because it is goofy nature and is sticking his tongue
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  out and making pictures you know they don't put anybody well spoken on Fox
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:35.560]  when they want to talk about the the birther issue and and it's birth
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:39.880]  certificate of the CIA background of Obama they don't put someone credible
[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:44.080]  the facts it put someone like the former military doctor and they didn't know
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:47.760]  what he's talking about didn't even know the difference between a birth
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:51.840]  certificate and a certification of live birth from a lie that's what they're
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:56.640]  dealing with they're putting up false heroes in front of us to divert public
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:00.520]  from those that would really do a good job and I think that's what the tea party
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:04.120]  people have to realize it's happening to them why do you think they're so
[02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:08.200]  concerned and again this isn't an ego trip folks I mean the websites are bigger
[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:12.760]  than Limbaugh and bigger than Sean Hannity and Limbex combined just one of
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:17.080]  my sites we do reach millions of people every day now but I tell you that's
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:21.560]  creepy and it makes me see how weak I am and how fallible I am and the
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:25.920]  responsibility I've got Joel because I never intended to be having this big of
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:30.280]  an effect and it it it few things shake me up but it's a little creepy to know
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:34.640]  that Glenn Beck's got people listening to this show right now well you know at
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:40.520]  least well there's a difference between people like Rush Limbaugh and O'Reilly
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:44.560]  and Hannity these people are actually on the other side if they're just
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:48.360]  playing the conservative Glenn Beck is sincerely on our side but he's
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:53.120]  manipulated that's my basic reason I tend to agree with you more and more I've
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:56.600]  really been studying back let's come back into those calls we promise we would

[02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:24.040]  informative and enlightening conversation with Joel Scalston let's at least
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:29.560]  get to these five callers Michael in Texas you're on the air go ahead hey
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:33.040]  folks thanks for taking the call Alex first of all I just want to let you know
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:37.800]  I feel your pain sometimes when I'm listening to the program and I hear I
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:45.080]  almost had tears in my eyes because just you this is a natural human emotion to
[02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:51.120]  be angry and to to to want to warn your fellow man you have outlook you know
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:56.240]  outgoing love and concern for people so don't you ever feel bad that you're
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:25:02.720]  getting angry or animated about this it's the dumbed-down drugged-up
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:09.840]  fluoridated society that is just turned into zombies that that is the the
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:15.360]  antithesis of what we should be well Michael it's just that it's just that when
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:18.840]  I talk about being upset about this stuff it's just getting worse because
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:24.360]  everything we talked about is true and worse yeah and because I've studied
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:27.920]  history I've studied these you know scientific dictators I know their
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:33.920]  program but to really see it now moving so quickly and I guess it's that I have
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:40.360]  children you know eight years old six and two and every time I look at them I
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:45.600]  think about how dangerous this world is and it just I just wish other people
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:50.600]  would would realize how dangerous this is Joel Scalcin can you comment to that
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:55.560]  for new listeners out there who who tune in and may be wondering if this
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:26:02.480]  world government's real or if it is real maybe it's a good thing well you know
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:06.880]  intrinsically there's nothing wrong with government at any level that defends
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:10.600]  fundamental rights in a proper way and is limited by constitutional government
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:15.080]  you could do that at a federal level at a state level or even other at a world
[02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:18.520]  level but that isn't where they're headed there is a conspiracy for world
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:24.640]  government to ensure people I've got the evidence to back that up and there is a
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:30.800]  major movement to project that and frankly they're they're making progress
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:36.600]  so they but you know we are winning right now the information war and in good
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:42.720]  portion because of your work Alex I mean over 35% of Americans doubt whether
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:47.080]  the president of the United States is an actual is eligible to run for office
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:52.560]  30 some percent but we know he's not I mean forget them exactly don't believe
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:58.640]  the government you know story on 9-11 and yet so the establishment is very
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:01.920]  worried about where we're going now that's why I believe Alex that they're
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:05.720]  gonna pull a war on us to bring people into line to make people forget about
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:11.480]  their doubts war someday is gonna be the big stick that's gonna knock people
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:14.360]  over the head and bring them into line I agree with you but I want to get a
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:20.920]  final comment from Michael but but but finishing up on that topic there's no
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:25.440]  doubt he gave up his citizenship to become an indian citizen and took the
[02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:31.520]  name Barry Sataro when now Wayne Madsen you were on with him or right after him
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:37.160]  last week Wayne Madsen got the other school certificate with another name I
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:44.320]  mean this guy's got this guy's got you know more names than than a South
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:48.960]  American drug lord I mean he's he's bottom line who is Barack Obama from
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:54.240]  your research well Barack Obama in my opinion was someone who was born and
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:59.440]  raised in a leftist environment and at some point he got brought into the New
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:05.600]  World Order and I think it was through a CIA offer when he was at Occidental
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:09.360]  College and then he went on that Columbia was a ruse I think he was
[02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:14.760]  working under cover for the CIA and occasionally attending from there on but
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:18.800]  at some point you know you take a leftist and he still acted the part of a
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:22.160]  leftist but he's been bought and sold and the proof that of course when they
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.720]  make him wealthy I mean how does the fourth-rate attorney who by the way
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:31.560]  lost his license in 2008 gave up his license because the to avoid charges
[02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:35.520]  that he had lied on his bar association application I mean this guy's a
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:38.840]  fraud from the very beginning but the real signs when they make him wealthy
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:42.560]  you know the fourth-rate lawyer working for community services isn't going to
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:47.760]  make enough to buy a nine million dollar property you know in Hawaii or 1.5
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:54.120]  dollar house in Chicago this guy's been you know co-opted and I think he's a
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:57.560]  controlled entity now there's no doubt about that anything else Michael in
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:03.400]  Texas oh yeah and my son is 10 years old now I was woken up because I saw him
[02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:07.880]  damaged by these MMR vaccines and one of these autistic I think he's a
[02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:11.520]  wonderful little guy but I have the same feelings you have Alex you look at your
[02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:15.520]  children every day and just say what if what if but the question I would have
[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:19.800]  and I'll hang up if you can comment on it is how do we get through to people
[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:25.600]  that appear to be waking up waking up in other words people in America are very
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:29.360]  superficial they don't think in and there's a lot of truth mixed with their
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:33.760]  let's say a blend back for example talks about the Constitution right there
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:37.680]  people who believe in the Constitution automatically think we'll see outside
[02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:41.800]  with him because he talks about the Constitution how do we get through to
[02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:46.680]  people and show them that there's really no difference between who's behind the
[02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:50.760]  scenes in the Democratic and Republican stay there let's get Joel Scalzo's

[02:33:19.520 --> 02:33:24.520]  I really do agree with his analysis and his breakdown on so many so many
[02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:30.640]  subjects especially on the glenbeck thing the way glenbeck is so erratic and
[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:36.960]  it's it is always changing his views but I do see him drifting towards more and
[02:33:36.960 --> 02:33:41.280]  more truth I want to answer that caller's question about how do you reach
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:45.760]  out to people to know the difference between a Sarah Palin kind of
[02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:51.820]  republicanoid awakening you know just like Keith Oberman was exposing
[02:33:51.820 --> 02:33:56.560]  tyranny when bush was in but as soon as Obama's in you know he's now supporting
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:34:05.320]  it how do we stop this two-party tag teaming but but but first going into a
[02:34:05.320 --> 02:34:10.000]  break you said you think limbaugh and Hannity that they're actually dark side
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:15.480]  give us your view on that well the way that I I make that decision I look at
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:20.880]  how to handle the conspiracy issue it's one thing to doubt conspiracy I mean
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:24.960]  everyone's we don't know none of us know everything that's going on behind the
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:30.320]  scene in the dark side of government so there's a big black hole of information
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:34.000]  because the government is keeping it secret so it's one thing to say you know
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:37.840]  I really have doubts about this and this and I have doubts about that but that's
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:42.160]  not what Hannity and O'Reilly or Limbaugh do not know Limbaugh used to before he
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:46.640]  made his first big three million dollar contract in his radio career he used to
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:50.080]  be pro-conspiracy used to talk about it openly he made that contract and the
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:55.080]  next day he wasn't just saying you know I'm not sure about conspiracy more he
[02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:59.200]  you could tell he hated it and he was going to denigrate and excoriate any
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:03.240]  person who brought that subject up and he proceeded to do so the same thing
[02:35:03.240 --> 02:35:07.600]  happens with Hannity and O'Reilly yeah they got that constant smirk on their
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:12.560]  face that to me is an indication that there's not a legitimate sincerity but
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:18.320]  that smirk really turns to total disgust total denigration when they start to
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:22.120]  talk to anybody who's got conspiracy and they're not satisfied to merely say hey
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:25.560]  you brought up some good points they won't even let them finish a sentence and
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:30.320]  that means that they bought into the concept which I believe is part of the
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:35.440]  media conspiracy that we must denigrate this issue of conspiracy so that no one
[02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:41.760]  dared bring that up so that so that none dare call a conspiracy so that once
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:46.680]  the global system emerges after they've built it you know just like a giant ship
[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:50.040]  built in a hangar it opens up and outslides the ship into the harbor
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:54.440]  they've now launched the world government they're now in the BBC times of
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:59.480]  London AP time magazine saying world government's the answer to all your
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:04.400]  problems and it's exactly what Cleon Skalsen said 50 years ago it's what you
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:08.560]  said 30 years ago it's what I said 15 years ago it's what Ron Paul said 30
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:13.040]  years ago it's a private global banking cartel through fractional reserve
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:18.360]  banking dominating the globe and we said that carbon tax was a fraud to fund
[02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:23.520]  the world government they now admit it's to fund the world government so what
[02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:28.080]  are limbaugh and Hannity gonna do whenever Hannity has Dick Morris on and
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:33.000]  Dick Morris says they were conspiracy theories about the one-world currency and
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:37.600]  the new world order and the plan to destroy America but now they're not and
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:43.720]  Hannity in that video clip look completely freaked out and and every
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:50.080]  time he has guests on now they're now agreeing with us Beck is talking about
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:56.040]  world government and things at least partially so it looks like a catch 22
[02:36:56.040 --> 02:37:00.760]  if the establishment continues to just brazenly deny all this after it's out in
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:05.240]  the open it's going to completely politically discredit them so I think
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:09.160]  they're putting their toe in the water with Glenn Beck and I think with
[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:14.400]  somebody who's real like Andrew Napolitano from my research they're
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:17.880]  starting to put their whole foot in and it's almost like they're starting to
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:24.360]  hedge their bets thinking they may lose go ahead well I think they have the war
[02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:29.120]  card they're gonna play in order so they may give a little bit on the conspiracy
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:34.400]  admit a little bit but they will never go all the way and admit that this is
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:38.320]  really real and really a threat I'll tell you why conspiracy is so important
[02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:43.640]  for the media to denigrate this is going to be the primal issue that they're
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:48.680]  going to use to institute wholesale roundup of dissidents someday when this
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:52.280]  war occurs when there's a preemptive nuclear strike on America by Russia and
[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:55.400]  China our leaders are going to come out of their bunkers and believe me they
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:38:00.680]  built brand new very deep underground bunkers in the Washington DC area so
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:03.840]  that they hit the green fire the other places they still have their bunkers
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:06.760]  but they'll come out of their bunkers which are not being built for terrorist
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:10.480]  attack and say the Russians deceived us we didn't realize this was going to
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:15.720]  happen we're innocent just like 9-11 we were ignorant don't fire us we're the
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:20.080]  only ones capable of running this new government but they will convince
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:25.120]  America in the panic of having major destruction in this country that they
[02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:31.120]  must give rebuilding power to a militarized world government and when
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:35.680]  that war is prosecuted all with the patriotism and knee-jerk reaction
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:39.240]  getting behind government just like in World War two even our own government
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:44.520]  was instigated starting a lot of this they're going to have to deal with
[02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:47.360]  dissidents they're going to have to deal with the Joel Scousons and the Alex
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:52.480]  Joneses who say our government knew in advance this was a conspiracy to bring
[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:56.560]  war upon us to force us into a new world order they will say mark my words
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:39:01.240]  those people who believe that our government conspired to do this our
[02:39:01.240 --> 02:39:05.560]  traitors they're being unfaithful to our troops they're not supporting our
[02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:10.720]  troops we need to lock them up and so the issue of conspiracy must always be
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:16.800]  made and evil in this society to justify locking people up and but if it's a
[02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:21.720]  Muslim conspiracy that can exist because they control those decoys it's that
[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:26.360]  government and big corporations can't stage events and that's why they hate
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:31.880]  9-11 truth so much in all its variants because it introduces the idea that
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:36.440]  Gulf of Tonkin was staged which is admitted and operation Ajax was staged
[02:39:36.440 --> 02:39:42.760]  and once people start you know seeing things for what they really are and who
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:47.480]  stands to gain that could potentially of 9-11 truth became completely mainstream
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:53.920]  take away this globalist nuclear sneak attack and the reason I agree with you
[02:39:53.920 --> 02:40:00.480]  Joel studying the entire geopolitical constellation is when you read the
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:04.480]  State Department memorandums when you read the Pentagon training when you read
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:10.360]  NLEO 9 when I've talked to colonels and generals who are now retired and in
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:15.640]  JAG officers here on the air they on record this is public and they have
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:23.600]  video games countless games out with the same script the same plot that America
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:28.160]  is going to be nuked by domestic terrorist working with the Russians or
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:32.000]  Chinese so they'll they'll nuke us blame it on the Russians or let the Russians
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:37.400]  do it and then blame it on Joel Scalson I mean or Alex Jones and in these video
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:41.800]  games they torture the Patriots it's wonderful it's so much fun but to make
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:48.760]  a long story short they are getting the military ready for the United States to
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:56.600]  be devastated and for I for NATO UN troops to occupy us and you see Henry
[02:40:56.600 --> 02:41:01.720]  Kissinger and others saying all we need is the right major crisis and the people
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:05.440]  of the United States will accept the New World Order they will accept United
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:11.360]  Nations troops on the streets of America and so because I realize they need a
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:16.360]  bold devastating stroke to really re-engineer the United States into the
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:20.760]  ultimate army and to roll out their secret weapons and take over the planet
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:23.960]  with the Anglo-American establishment duking it out with the Chinese and
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:28.920]  Russians that that is exactly the type of thing they will do is nuke major
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:35.120]  cities and use it to totally take over and absolutely that's when they're going
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:39.400]  to send teams to arrest tens of thousands of Americans who they know
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:43.480]  are patriots and that's when we're gonna have to defend ourselves if it comes to
[02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:49.240]  that well and unfortunately they're not going to allow people to prepare for
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:52.760]  that that's why I have not believed that there'll ever be any domestic cares and
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:56.760]  using nuclear weapons in fact it's a lot of disinformation about loose nukes
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:01.240]  going around in fact the suitcase nukes are the most guarded pride possessions
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:06.120]  the jewels of weaponry within the Soviet Union the continuing Soviets and the
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:09.480]  United States government they have not been led this that was simply an excuse
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:14.240]  to be able to allow the government to romp around and you know and and
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:18.320]  lament the terrorist threat image but if they were to allow a loose nuke to go
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:21.840]  off a small one for example what would the American people want to do they want
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:25.400]  to prepare against nuclear radiation and our government does not want people
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:30.400]  prepared for this they want us held hostage to this great preemptive nuclear
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:34.560]  strike that they're planning on unleashing upon us so that there's a
[02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:39.440]  maximum panic that's why when I explained the last show you know when I
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:45.680]  was hired my architectural firm high security firm to design nuclear prefab
[02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:49.640]  fallout shelters for Pakistan the government in Pakistan nixed it they
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:55.400]  said we do not want anybody marketing private fallout shelters in Pakistan the
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:43:00.000]  same policy to the US government we do not want anybody prepared for nuclear
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:06.560]  war why because they know it's coming they're prepared you know why not the
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:12.520]  American people well we know that there were cases in the 60s 70s and 80s where
[02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:16.240]  the establishment wanted to have a nuclear war and they talked about how
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:19.800]  they could get even greater control over society I mean that's the only way
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:23.320]  they're really going to end our free society and really try to get our guns
[02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:30.240]  is by a catastrophic psychological wound so that we will accept this new
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:37.240]  tyranny and Joel do you believe that 9-11 was a beta test for a for a massive
[02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:41.880]  controlled nuclear strike well I don't think it was a beta test I think it was
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:46.120]  a prelude to preparing the nation for or to see how much they could be
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:50.240]  manipulated with the terror strike I mean if they could pull off 9-11 and get
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:55.160]  in and subvert all of the truth that came out about government involvement
[02:43:55.160 --> 02:43:59.600]  explosives involved in the war if they could subvert that they knew that they
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:03.240]  could pull off a major preemptive nuclear strike and subvert the information
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:07.040]  that I haven't put out on my website on how they have been covering for the
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:11.000]  Russian how they have been continuing to allow Russia to build up and transfer
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:15.520]  technology to Russia and China knowing that they're going to someday attack I
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:18.880]  mean they have to be able to cover up this information they did in World War
[02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:22.680]  2 they built up Hitler's forces and cropped in Tyson and in the other
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:28.360]  German military firms yeah that's the MO and they successfully covered that up so
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:32.320]  they're practicing shall we say on how good will can we cover things up how
[02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:36.160]  public could we use the controlled media to do that and they've got a real
[02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:40.000]  problem with the internet with the alternative media we're getting stronger
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.600]  we're getting a lot more adherent the haven't you written a paper I've like
[02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:49.840]  I remember reading it years ago about safe places in the United States that's
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:54.320]  right in fact I have a new third edition coming out in a couple of months of what
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:59.040]  is called strategic relocation North American guys at safe places and where
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:02.600]  do you think the safest place in North America is I mean I know being in
[02:45:02.600 --> 02:45:08.440]  central Texas we're a major target of nukes but if the globalists are
[02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:12.400]  launching the attack will they want to destroy our own military or will it just
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:15.760]  be the major cities to reduce population no they'll actually go after the
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:19.760]  military almost exclusively yes why I predict there's only about 15 major
[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:24.400]  cities that will be destroyed they don't want to destroy all the popular they
[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:30.800]  want to harness that abject panic in favor of the new reloader and rebuilding
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:35.160]  and going after this it prosecuted his patriotic war afterwards and so they
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:38.800]  want to kill the old military bring in the foreign troops hype up the new
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:43.000]  conscripts to go under UN globalist control so obviously you're saying
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:48.120]  Fort Hood's a prime target for the globalist controlled strike yeah it
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:52.200]  certainly is every major military base is going to be a target as well as many
[02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:57.400]  of the underground bases that they know about and it's going to be there's going
[02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:01.080]  to be some devastation but people can survive it is very very survival the
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:05.000]  Russians intend to survive this and continue to work and so people ought not
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:10.280]  to believe the propaganda about absolute I mean it's going to be a tremendous
[02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:13.640]  devastation if nothing else from the EMP strike when do you believe the
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:19.520]  globalist are going to pull the strings on their Chinese and Russian minions
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:22.560]  well as you said they don't control them they've built them up I mean when do you
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:28.440]  see this conflict being planned I say that my my best prediction is that it's
[02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:34.640]  only a 50% chance by the midway in this decade 2015 about a 90% chance by the
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:38.920]  end of this decade I frankly think it's going to take longer to pull off just
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:45.400]  because the Russian you know or China especially isn't ready yet so 2020 you
[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:51.600]  see norad standing down and hundreds of nukes raining down on the military I see
[02:46:51.600 --> 02:46:55.520]  that there's a 90% probability in that time frame that that's what that strike
[02:46:55.520 --> 02:47:00.440]  is going to come so we do have time to prepare it isn't a panic situation but
[02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:05.200]  people you know as we fight for liberty we've got to realize that we've got to
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:09.080]  be prepared for a takedown in other words it isn't enough just go blindly
[02:47:09.080 --> 02:47:13.280]  optimistic right look at the globalist look at naft and get and look at the
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:17.760]  family everything they do is to destroy this Christian nation that's their
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:21.000]  number one mission and I tend to agree with you I think they're going to blow
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:24.960]  the living daylights out of this country and I mean all the evidence shows
[02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:29.640]  they're building towards that you know it's amazing Alex how many in my former
[02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:33.960]  career as a high-security architect how many when I was doing jobs in Colorado
[02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:37.560]  and the Denver and Aspen Colorado area how many times contractor say oh did you
[02:47:37.560 --> 02:47:40.560]  know about did you help design that bunker system for that house over there
[02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:47.440]  he's ex-PIA and he's ex-FBI and you know these people who've been deep into
[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:50.600]  government in the dark side they know this attack is coming they're building
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:54.960]  bunker things and they're retreats out in Colorado and other ski resorts in
[02:47:54.960 --> 02:48:01.240]  Utah and things and the contractors know about it but the American people don't
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:06.080]  yeah I mean people keep saying the new world will never win they'll never get
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:11.040]  our guns oh yeah once they blast the military bases in the infrastructure into
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:16.120]  dust and you'll be begging for food when the UN troops roll in and let me just
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:20.960]  point out Alex here I'm not really on board that I really think they're gonna
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:24.800]  bring in UN troops I think it's counterproductive to their whipping up
[02:48:24.800 --> 02:48:29.400]  major enthusiasm to get us into the new world order I think we could have
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:33.320]  outright rebellion if they try to occupy it first of all I think they're
[02:48:33.320 --> 02:48:37.280]  gonna have enough private military contractor thugs to be able to do
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:41.840]  whatever people control they don't know I mean I agree with you but reading the
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:45.360]  army documents I'm sure you've seen these but if you want them I'll send them
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:49.560]  to you they are training to bring in UN troops have you seen the deals they've
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:53.760]  signed to bring in Mexican and Canadian troops during terror attacks in the US
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:58.280]  I mean they're openly at West Point teaching them that foreign troops are
[02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:01.400]  gonna operate here but we have to remember there's a difference between
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:06.040]  all the foreign troop training a lot of that is to get information and military
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:11.400]  technology spread around to our future enemies things but I happen to know from
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:16.480]  my source of the Russians do not intend to occupy here the Chinese do not they
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:21.120]  don't want to get tangled up with the millions of civilians with weapons here
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:27.040]  on that but I frankly don't think it's necessary to bring in foreign troops in
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:30.480]  fact it would be counterproductive to convincing Americans to go along with
[02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:35.040]  the benevolence of the new world order if they saw the new world order I mean I
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:38.840]  agree they're converting I mean they have more troops in Afghanistan and Iraq
[02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:43.160]  that are mercenaries than they do regular military right Joe Joe I agree with
[02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:47.280]  that but I'm just saying in all the training I mean it's public that they're
[02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:53.120]  saying they want to use NATO slash UN to help us during emergencies so they're
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:49:57.160]  certain to send me some of those because I'd like to analyze that just to see let's

[02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:32.240]  you said that I've been in a few of the Council for National Policy meetings and
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:35.760]  they're dull there's never anything sinister going on there there's no
[02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:39.720]  influential government policy being made there that they're rather dull and that
[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:44.240]  there's no conspiratorial there's no conspiratorial activity and that they're
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:47.800]  not secretive even though they refuse to release me of their meetings we got to
[02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:52.360]  go to break but we'll come back there's a left-wing CFR funded conspiracy
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:57.840]  theory that says some group called the CMP runs everything and it's a total
[02:50:57.840 --> 02:51:07.920]  diversion but we'll talk about on the other side tyranny is here the grim

[02:54:26.600 --> 02:54:31.360]  old skelson but I don't know if you could stay with us I get these emails the
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:35.600]  last few years you know you're part of the CMP you're part of a secret right
[02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:40.080]  wing group more powerful than the CFR so in research didn't found the Hunt
[02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:45.400]  brothers were involved in stuff and it looked like a right wing attempt to get
[02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:48.840]  the government back from the globalist and then it got taken over by the
[02:54:48.840 --> 02:54:57.080]  globalist but then I noticed it was big foundation money and like mother Jones and
[02:54:57.080 --> 02:55:04.120]  Rolling Stone were promoting it that and then that's what the White House
[02:55:04.120 --> 02:55:08.520]  regulations are cast Sunstein says we've now got the London independent
[02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:14.760]  meeting the government is infiltrating conspiracy culture and posing to then
[02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:20.000]  attack real people and you know I hear Joel laughing during the break when I
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:24.840]  asked him about this but here's Joel for two hours exposing the Republican
[02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:28.680]  takeover of the Patriot movement and then a caller calls in and says what
[02:55:28.680 --> 02:55:32.600]  because I've heard it all you know will you tell me about the CMP and then are
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:40.200]  you part of it Joel tell us about this well I was part of the original CMP
[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:43.320]  starting I was there as chairman chairman of the conservative National Committee
[02:55:43.320 --> 02:55:48.720]  so I have first any information about how it began there I was working as
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:53.320]  executive editor of conservative digest under Richard Bigary working with
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:59.920]  Howard Phillips of who's a real Patriot and frankly we were making really head
[02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:06.520]  way in stopping the compromises the Reagan administration was involved in
[02:56:06.520 --> 02:56:11.120]  under the influence of vice president George Bush and so the CMP was started
[02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:15.280]  in fact just like to blunt our movement just like the Tea Party movement is
[02:56:15.280 --> 02:56:20.240]  being blunted today you had your big name Republicans move in and start to like
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:25.160]  Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich and others came in and tried to basically water
[02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:30.280]  down our movement which was to have a no compromise strategy in there and so the
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:39.680]  CMP became frankly a kind of a mimic of what the left was doing but they had no
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:43.000]  conspiracy or tendencies except and that's why they kept these things
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:46.720]  secret because they wanted some heavy hitters in there and they they charged
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:51.960]  a whale of them money one or two thousand dollars a year to be a member of the CMP
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:56.800]  they did have some secrecy but it wasn't anything that you know was
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:57:02.320]  conspiratorial in nature their basic movement was to co-opt them our attempts
[02:57:02.320 --> 02:57:06.280]  to put some spine into the Republican Party in their resistance to the
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:11.760]  compromise yeah but Joel then there's the spin that the CMP runs the whole
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:19.280]  world now we're sorry your call did not go through will you please Joel you're
[02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:26.800]  still there that was weird here let's try to get Joel back on ought to have him
[02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:33.560]  on it's a total distraction it's like we have other guests on who've talked
[02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:36.400]  about it because it's interesting to see how they control the right wing and
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:40.000]  the left wing but it's it's like saying the CFR runs everything when it really
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.680]  does have a lot of power and actually writes a lot of the laws but they
[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:46.560]  themselves are just Aaron boys that do it you know this interview has been
[02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:49.800]  really good with Joel Scalson maybe we should go into overdrive guys we haven't
[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:53.640]  done that in a while you guys want to go into overdrive we ready to do that
[02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:59.320]  let's get Joel back on and see if he can go into overdrive Joel your phone got
[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:04.000]  cut out there or something disconnected you yeah something happened hey listen
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:07.360]  will you do 20 more minutes with us so we can talk about a few other issues or
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:11.840]  if you're okay listen we're gonna go into overdrive listeners and that means
[02:58:11.840 --> 02:58:15.320]  it'll be internet only that's actually not true because the network sends out
[02:58:15.320 --> 02:58:18.520]  this fourth hour on satellite because I do it occasionally live still so if
[02:58:18.520 --> 02:58:21.080]  you're a station you'll be able to continue to listen to us actually I
[02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:23.960]  forgot that when we do overdrive now it's actually on the birds on the radio
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:28.320]  stations I quit doing four hours a day a few months ago just because I've got
[02:58:28.320 --> 02:58:31.160]  working on the TV show we're developing and everything else it was just
[02:58:31.160 --> 02:58:35.760]  exhausting me but occasionally I will do the fourth hour we'll do part of it
