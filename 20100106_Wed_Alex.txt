[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:12.160 --> 00:19.720]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.720 --> 00:30.240]  Texas Alex Jones what do you think of this the parents of four Montgomery
[00:30.240 --> 00:33.600]  County children under arrest for failing to register their home school to
[00:33.600 --> 00:37.880]  children with the school district seven years ago how is this allowed to happen
[00:37.880 --> 00:41.280]  who should be held accountable fact-finder Marsha Natal went and got some
[00:41.280 --> 00:46.640]  answers is it fair to say that these four children fell through the cracks well
[00:46.640 --> 00:50.120]  from what I can gather it sounds like there was education going on so I
[00:50.120 --> 00:52.760]  don't know if they really slipped through the cracks they didn't fulfill
[00:52.760 --> 00:56.600]  their legal responsibilities to file with the school district to be homeschooled
[00:56.600 --> 01:00.880]  Dr. Richard Hoffman superintendent of Fonda Fultonville schools didn't
[01:00.880 --> 01:05.800]  become aware until mid-December that four children ages 8 to 14 who lived in
[01:05.800 --> 01:10.080]  the town of Glen for seven years were never registered with the district but
[01:10.080 --> 01:15.040]  were being homeschooled by their parents Richard and Margie Cressy how did you
[01:15.040 --> 01:21.480]  not know that these four kids were not being educated or schooled well school
[01:21.480 --> 01:26.480]  districts as a rule do not have detectives out to see who is and who isn't
[01:26.480 --> 01:30.720]  we count on parents to follow the law which is that okay evens between the
[01:30.720 --> 01:34.880]  ages of 6 and 16 need to be educated that's enough of this we're going to
[01:34.880 --> 01:39.200]  play more of the newscast and break it down later you know in Germany they
[01:39.200 --> 01:43.880]  arrest you for homeschooling two years ago the state of California declared in
[01:43.880 --> 01:47.600]  court it later out overturned that the state owns your children actually set
[01:47.600 --> 01:54.000]  it in the ruling and that homeschooling was not allowed the state believes it
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.080]  owns your children the state believes it owns your children in the land of the
[02:00.080 --> 02:08.760]  free in the home of the brave I want that to sink in to everyone that from
[02:08.760 --> 02:15.280]  Illinois to California from Connecticut to Florida they are persecuting
[02:15.280 --> 02:20.200]  homeschoolers I have seen countless news reports where CPS gets called on
[02:20.200 --> 02:26.480]  families even well-to-do families they persecute the poor even more because
[02:26.480 --> 02:31.160]  neighbors will see their children out playing in the backyard or front yard
[02:31.160 --> 02:35.080]  during their recess time as homeschoolers and the dumbed-down public
[02:35.080 --> 02:42.640]  believes it's illegal and calls the police and the CPS comes it's all
[02:42.640 --> 02:48.240]  color of law it's all fraud I've pulled up the code in New York it's one of the
[02:48.240 --> 02:55.520]  more strict unconstitutional states on homeschooling but still it is a civil
[02:55.520 --> 03:00.680]  matter and they never attempted to contact the parents they made a example
[03:00.680 --> 03:03.920]  out of them and came and arrested them and they have the police on there
[03:03.920 --> 03:08.720]  talking about what evil criminals they are you move into a town you don't
[03:08.720 --> 03:16.920]  register your children for homeschooling and the police come how do they arrest
[03:16.920 --> 03:19.920]  you for not giving your children inoculations when there's no law to
[03:19.920 --> 03:25.840]  take inoculations in any state New Jersey's trying to pass a law they use
[03:25.840 --> 03:31.040]  contract fraud they use color of law they use racketeering the school kicks
[03:31.040 --> 03:34.640]  you out for not taking the shots under policy never telling you there's a
[03:34.640 --> 03:40.440]  waiver by law and then triggers truancy laws and that's how they arrest you then
[03:40.440 --> 03:44.440]  the media nationwide engages in a hoax so does Canada and England they have the
[03:44.440 --> 03:48.880]  same system of fraud it's all globally standardized and they tell you it's the
[03:48.880 --> 03:53.720]  law that you've got to have the shots but then arrest you for the truancy and
[03:53.720 --> 03:59.720]  the average parent is so unknowledgeable so jellyfish like that they end up going
[03:59.720 --> 04:08.000]  to jail ladies and gentlemen when I saw this news report last night I became
[04:08.000 --> 04:17.640]  beside myself in anger and rage I am sick with disgust and my mind raced last
[04:17.640 --> 04:21.320]  night and this morning with all the different facets and angles of this and
[04:21.320 --> 04:26.240]  how it ties into the naked body scanners and how the body scanners going in
[04:26.240 --> 04:32.960]  nation-wide that the UK government admits violates child porn laws are a total
[04:32.960 --> 04:39.160]  act of submission an act of domination in the religion of tyranny the government
[04:39.160 --> 04:45.120]  is a cult it wants to force you to be part of its cult and I'm going to break

[09:26.880 --> 09:31.160]  converted to a complete police state grid for the only jobs you'll be able
[09:31.160 --> 09:36.080]  to get out of college or high school are running the grid more than half the
[09:36.080 --> 09:39.800]  public is now working for the government or on welfare the criminal
[09:39.800 --> 09:44.800]  government is now sharpening this mass of people into a weapon to rob those of
[09:44.800 --> 09:51.160]  us that are not dependent parasites this is social engineering this is the
[09:51.160 --> 09:59.000]  scientific dictatorship now there's many different facets to the war on
[09:59.000 --> 10:14.200]  individuality the war on the family war on self-sufficiency and independence and
[10:14.200 --> 10:18.840]  there is a massive war being waged against homeschooling in this country
[10:18.840 --> 10:26.480]  countless dramas and TV shows and cop shows and newspaper reports in fiction
[10:26.480 --> 10:35.520]  and nonfiction cast homeschoolers as abusing racist dumbed-down scum when
[10:35.520 --> 10:39.200]  all the statistics all the numbers the government's own numbers they like to
[10:39.200 --> 10:47.360]  hide show that the smartest most intelligent highest test scoring people
[10:47.360 --> 10:55.360]  in America are homeschoolers they win more than 90 percent of national and
[10:55.360 --> 11:01.800]  international spelling bees they win the vast majority of geography bees they
[11:01.800 --> 11:07.480]  win the vast majority of science open public science fair county fair city
[11:07.480 --> 11:21.080]  fair science fair competitions they are coveted by corporations I have
[11:21.080 --> 11:27.800]  homeschoolers in my family cousins and people who out of college are snatched
[11:27.800 --> 11:37.360]  up and put in executive grooming positions with fortune 10 companies my
[11:37.360 --> 11:43.360]  father was sent by a corporation he was consulting for to a to the four seasons
[11:43.360 --> 11:49.160]  in Austin to hear a top consultant to consultants and he openly three years
[11:49.160 --> 11:55.000]  ago my dad called me from the four year of the meeting and he said I can't
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.520]  believe it this guy's talking about the new world order world government the
[11:58.520 --> 12:02.720]  social engineering how the elite by design wanted to dumb everybody down to
[12:02.720 --> 12:08.200]  make a more manageable but now the elites job is to actually find homeschoolers
[12:08.200 --> 12:11.960]  and other intelligent people to hire for corporate structures because they know
[12:11.960 --> 12:16.240]  how to critically think because the elite have done too good a job ruining
[12:16.240 --> 12:20.920]  the population so now the elite are headhunting up and getting all the
[12:20.920 --> 12:33.760]  homeschoolers on their team once they're out of college and the evidence goes on
[12:33.760 --> 12:37.120]  and on and on in fact let's get Charlotte is there beyond next week about
[12:37.120 --> 12:42.840]  this Charlotte is there be number two department of education head of policy

[13:04.040 --> 13:07.680]  was in meetings and she published these secret documents where they openly said
[13:07.680 --> 13:12.640]  we're gonna destroy the language where children can't even talk we're gonna
[13:12.640 --> 13:18.600]  break down the family entirely we are going to program everyone we're gonna
[13:18.600 --> 13:22.640]  have all curriculum done in the next two decades on computers so the government

[13:27.400 --> 13:30.920]  order and she published the book deliberate dumbing down the size of a
[13:30.920 --> 13:38.440]  phone book we sell it at info wars dot com and more than half of the giant
[13:38.440 --> 13:46.240]  textbook she wrote is government documents scans of them I challenge you
[13:46.240 --> 13:53.320]  to read it and to not throw up I physically got nauseous last night I
[13:53.320 --> 13:58.960]  physically had to control myself to not pound holes in the walls at the office
[13:58.960 --> 14:06.520]  this morning because at an instinctive primitive natural healthy level I know
[14:06.520 --> 14:15.360]  what slavery is and that's what we're going into real hardcore slavery social
[14:15.360 --> 14:19.960]  engineering run by Madison Avenue run by the think tanks run by the
[14:19.960 --> 14:26.800]  psychiatrist and psychologist they know what they're doing the outlandishness
[14:26.800 --> 14:31.640]  of the news now every time I watch it it's puts your hat in mittens on it's
[14:31.640 --> 14:35.160]  going to be cold in Austin like we're children the state and media is our
[14:35.160 --> 14:44.520]  mommy and daddy our big daddy they talk to us like children government study
[14:44.520 --> 14:51.440]  shows mercury is actually good for your brain oh lead in poison in toys is good
[14:51.440 --> 14:59.280]  for our economy MSNBC I've played these clips newscast how could this be allowed
[14:59.280 --> 15:04.720]  to happen let's find out how this happened how these children for seven
[15:04.720 --> 15:11.680]  years were homeschooled and no one knew um it's like being in kindergarten again
[15:11.680 --> 15:20.880]  when the person tattles um I thought for a minute they were going to say how on
[15:20.880 --> 15:24.800]  earth did this family get SWAT team get arrested at their house their children
[15:24.800 --> 15:29.520]  grabbed CPS involved
[15:29.520 --> 15:35.440]  is the start of the newscast he says how did this happen we're going to find
[15:35.440 --> 15:42.280]  out and then they are all freaked out it's scary I I don't know how for seven
[15:42.280 --> 15:46.480]  years in a rural area hard work and family and then they go on to admit well
[15:46.480 --> 15:51.680]  they were actually educated but see the state is there the cult is there you've
[15:51.680 --> 15:57.640]  got to be part of the cult you've got to register with the government you've got
[15:57.640 --> 16:05.520]  to file forms in New York now it's a civil matter and then if you don't
[16:05.520 --> 16:08.960]  comply it can become a truancy matter but they didn't send them a letter they
[16:08.960 --> 16:15.800]  didn't send them a notice they made an example of them I have seen more than a
[16:15.800 --> 16:19.440]  hundred reports guaranteed I see them every couple weeks for the last six
[16:19.440 --> 16:23.560]  seven years the federal government passes not a law but a regulation if
[16:23.560 --> 16:34.280]  states want their Farm Bureau money their agriculture money and the
[16:34.280 --> 16:37.400]  government's come in and taken over all the local activist groups and turn them
[16:37.400 --> 16:43.400]  into government bodies and non-governmental organizations if the
[16:43.400 --> 16:47.080]  states want their money they've got to put in animal ID premises ID and I've
[16:47.080 --> 16:52.600]  read it for our ranch and farm we got one we refused to sign it and it said you
[16:52.600 --> 16:57.120]  waive your rights you are now a steward of the land the government controls it
[16:57.120 --> 17:02.920]  that's what the legalese says and there's thousand dollar a day or higher
[17:02.920 --> 17:07.800]  fines if a cow or a chicken dies and you don't tell us or if it doesn't have an
[17:07.800 --> 17:14.560]  RFID bracelet on it costing more than the chicken or what you can sell it for and
[17:14.560 --> 17:20.120]  they'll be federal and local state inspections premises ID animal ID now
[17:20.120 --> 17:25.440]  there's no law but then they use color of law regulations and they did this as a
[17:25.440 --> 17:31.720]  spot test all over the country they will check and see if the person went part of
[17:31.720 --> 17:39.120]  the 4-H club or the AG club at the county fair or city fair they will check
[17:39.120 --> 17:44.760]  and they will see who didn't sign the animal ID premises ID because you have
[17:44.760 --> 17:48.600]  to have that to then be part of the 4-H club now there's nothing to do with your
[17:48.600 --> 17:52.480]  home or your farm or your ranch they just say oh it's a policy just like it's a
[17:52.480 --> 17:59.760]  policy you got to take inoculations and then they fraudulently rig it with the
[17:59.760 --> 18:04.760]  judges this is on record to where they give the award to someone that hasn't
[18:04.760 --> 18:12.160]  they give the first place blue ribbon to stunt for the hog or for the cow or for
[18:12.160 --> 18:21.160]  the sheep or for the goat or for the goose or for the chicken they give it in
[18:21.160 --> 18:25.880]  one of the categories to someone and then they put them in handcuffs on the
[18:25.880 --> 18:28.360]  stage they bring them to the stage this has been in the news hundreds of times
[18:28.360 --> 18:32.720]  and they say oh we're sorry you can't win now and they either put them in
[18:32.720 --> 18:36.560]  handcuffs and say you violated a law but then let them go there's no law or they
[18:36.560 --> 18:41.160]  make them cry and escort them out with police security off the grounds crying
[18:41.160 --> 18:45.000]  and everyone says what happened what happened they didn't do the animal ID
[18:45.000 --> 18:53.320]  premise society this is the psych warfare operations in America so that you

[24:43.200 --> 24:47.360]  company now in Austin who ran into a warrantless army checkpoint in Kyle
[24:47.360 --> 24:51.680]  south of Austin got mad about it and showed me photos documents all of it
[24:51.680 --> 24:57.320]  now it's declassified since then of how in the late 1980s regular Marines were
[24:57.320 --> 25:03.280]  secretly raiding gun owners homes in Virginia this has been a long-term
[25:03.280 --> 25:08.840]  secret criminal program totally illegal and now they're just doing it out on the
[25:08.840 --> 25:14.040]  open we are being hit from every side this government is so stinking and so
[25:14.040 --> 25:20.960]  wicked it's robbed 28 plus trill since the banker takeover of October 2008 and
[25:20.960 --> 25:26.360]  last year in a month year and three months and how time flies we're being
[25:26.360 --> 25:31.640]  raped by government on every side read the Declaration of Independence look at
[25:31.640 --> 25:37.160]  what the king did creating swarms of new agencies and sending forth swarms of
[25:37.160 --> 25:42.440]  agents to eat out our substance like locusts coming down on a wheat field and
[25:42.440 --> 25:49.240]  clearing it in minutes I saw some statistics last night about text dot here
[25:49.240 --> 25:51.880]  in Texas and how they're still going ahead with the North American Union
[25:51.880 --> 25:57.400]  trans-Texas corridors they told the idiot public 10 years ago they were
[25:57.400 --> 26:01.920]  gonna build this i-30 loop around Austin to make the trucks go around it then
[26:01.920 --> 26:05.520]  they made it a toll road you drive on it it's a ghost town nobody can pay the
[26:05.520 --> 26:10.040]  $7 to $8 depending on how far you ride on it I've written it a few times it's
[26:10.040 --> 26:14.560]  literally empty at rush hour you might see a car every 10 minutes or something
[26:14.560 --> 26:20.600]  I mean it's just off the charts and same capital Metro the bus system that 1%
[26:20.600 --> 26:28.320]  of Austin's citizens ride cost an average of $37 that's in the statesman
[26:28.320 --> 26:38.320]  today $37 for a person to ride it they pay $2 on average they get $150 million
[26:38.320 --> 26:44.360]  dollars a year to run it in Austin guess what the roads in Austin get 70
[26:44.360 --> 26:53.000]  million they get double and 10 million extra
[26:53.000 --> 27:02.800]  two times 70 million is 140 mil they get 150 million dollars and they're
[27:02.800 --> 27:07.760]  getting ready to raise the sales tax even more in Austin for the stupid
[27:07.760 --> 27:11.880]  buses that nobody rides the city isn't designed for buses 1% of the city rides
[27:11.880 --> 27:19.000]  them and they get 150 million and I was listening to news stations this morning

[27:36.480 --> 27:42.200]  that nobody can ride or get to because the city isn't set up for that and how

[36:35.640 --> 36:42.320]  programs to tattle and their training to be the spies I told you six years ago
[36:42.320 --> 36:45.600]  the feds had taken over the Boy Scouts with the Explorer Scouts for training
[36:45.600 --> 36:51.120]  them for gun confiscation and part of americorps secure core holds you that
[36:51.120 --> 36:57.400]  eight years ago actually was first in the Philadelphia Daily News how great it
[36:57.400 --> 37:01.920]  was then the New York Times shows Explorer Scouts training with guns and
[37:01.920 --> 37:07.720]  it showed photos scores of color photos of the dead u.s. veterans who refused to

[37:16.480 --> 37:22.560]  moving in right now and then the L.A. Times reports two weeks ago oh the L.A.
[37:22.560 --> 37:25.720]  police department other departments around the country they're running with
[37:25.720 --> 37:31.200]  the Pentagon public schools will now be Pentagon centers run by the army and
[37:31.200 --> 37:37.880]  police and we want the troubled youth yes the thugs that's what the Nazis did
[37:37.880 --> 37:42.240]  and the Soviets and the malice did and it says oh the police departments are
[37:42.240 --> 37:45.720]  taking over the Boy Scouts they no longer will even run it the police
[37:45.720 --> 37:50.320]  departments will openly run these divisions with children training as
[37:50.320 --> 38:00.480]  literal Hitler you again and so you don't want to put your children in school
[38:00.480 --> 38:03.960]  folks if I knew what I knew now and of course I wouldn't have been in public
[38:03.960 --> 38:12.560]  school I went to public school I went to public school in kindergarten in the
[38:12.560 --> 38:18.280]  first grade you know bad part of Dallas then I remember them bringing in the
[38:18.280 --> 38:21.200]  fluoride pills we all had to eat I remember getting a huge headache and
[38:21.200 --> 38:26.200]  throwing up every time they did it every month it wasn't placebo wasn't
[38:26.200 --> 38:29.440]  psychosomatic I thought it was candy I wanted I remember getting sick with those
[38:29.440 --> 38:35.080]  red pills a dose that they admit is incredibly toxic thousands of times
[38:35.080 --> 38:40.760]  what's in a pitcher of water and then I remember my parents putting me in a
[38:40.760 --> 38:46.280]  Christian school until the sixth grade and they put me back in public school and
[38:46.280 --> 38:51.720]  I got off that school bus and I walked into that public school and kids with
[38:51.720 --> 38:57.400]  mustaches in the sixth grade kids who were 13 14 years old who'd flunked four
[38:57.400 --> 39:02.240]  or five times began beating me up and the teachers wouldn't do anything and
[39:02.240 --> 39:10.760]  sure it made me tough and I remember the vicious social behavior and the
[39:10.760 --> 39:15.680]  comp and the kids competing for the shoes and clothes they wore and then the
[39:15.680 --> 39:19.960]  vicious social engineering and it was it's a lot worse now you know that
[39:19.960 --> 39:28.880]  hundreds of times worse conservatively and I remember I didn't use drugs and I
[39:28.880 --> 39:37.280]  remember in the eighth grade in the football field house over and over and
[39:37.280 --> 39:49.280]  over and over and over and over again it turned out this football players brother
[39:49.280 --> 39:53.960]  in high school have been caught with drugs and so they told him go get us a
[39:53.960 --> 39:57.240]  bunch of people right out a bunch of people and we'll let you off and they
[39:57.240 --> 40:00.920]  even got his little brother in a separate school to go around and beg
[40:00.920 --> 40:08.360]  everyone to bring him marijuana to sell him marijuana and then months later they
[40:08.360 --> 40:13.240]  had a big bust and it turned out several kids had gone to their big brothers
[40:13.240 --> 40:16.800]  and said please my buddy the cool kid on the football team it was the cool kid
[40:16.800 --> 40:19.600]  see how they know how to pray on everybody they got the cool one of the
[40:19.600 --> 40:22.760]  cool kids on the football team to go around to all the kids that wanted to
[40:22.760 --> 40:26.680]  be cool and he took him months to get them to bring him small amounts of
[40:26.680 --> 40:32.200]  marijuana that's your stinking degenerate government while the Pentagon
[40:32.200 --> 40:38.840]  openly runs the opium out of Afghanistan openly ships the cocaine in in the
[40:38.840 --> 40:46.160]  1980s when I was in school it's a predator criminal government most of them
[40:46.160 --> 40:55.880]  know full well what they are doing now if someone gets caught with an aspirin
[40:55.880 --> 41:00.680]  they get charged with felonies in schools if someone doesn't put their
[41:00.680 --> 41:04.040]  riddle in a proper container they get charged with felonies they push the
[41:04.040 --> 41:07.920]  drugs illegal and legal on you and then when they catch you with them I see
[41:07.920 --> 41:11.480]  reports every couple days of old ladies pulled over then the cops in these

[45:46.360 --> 45:51.360]  abuse to take you into body scanners and scan you and save your naked image of

[54:21.800 --> 54:25.480]  from what I can gather it sounds like there was education going on so I don't
[54:25.480 --> 54:28.440]  know if they really slipped through the cracks they didn't fulfill their legal
[54:28.440 --> 54:32.480]  responsibilities to file with the school district to the filthy state hit boss

[55:28.080 --> 55:33.280]  it superintendent of Fonda Fultonville schools didn't become aware until mid
[55:33.280 --> 55:38.040]  December that four children ages eight to 14 who live in the town of Glen for
[55:38.040 --> 55:42.480]  seven years were never registered with the district but were being homeschooled
[55:42.480 --> 55:47.280]  by their parents Richard and Margie Cressy how did you not know that these
[55:47.280 --> 55:53.680]  four kids were not being educated or schooled well school districts as a rule
[55:53.680 --> 55:59.240]  do not have detectives out to see who is and who isn't we count on parents to
[55:59.240 --> 56:04.400]  follow the law which is all students oh see we know there's the message we need
[56:04.400 --> 56:08.280]  to go out and do home inspections which is now starting they fool all these
[56:08.280 --> 56:12.160]  women and men oh put your kids in head start it's free education then you get

[56:36.440 --> 56:40.960]  educated the Cressy's were arrested on charges of child endangerment police
[56:40.960 --> 56:46.520]  began investigating after an anonymous child endangerment see they don't have
[56:46.520 --> 56:54.680]  anything they can charge him with for not filing the policy so child endangerment
[56:54.680 --> 56:59.040]  I've got the law there's nothing about child endangerment in here see when they
[56:59.040 --> 57:02.360]  arrest you for not inoculating they don't arrest you for that because there's no
[57:02.360 --> 57:08.800]  law it's the same thing it's just it's unbelievable they're hunting us they're
[57:08.800 --> 57:12.360]  hunting like planet of the apes wild humans that aren't living in their
[57:12.360 --> 57:18.800]  slave pit continue tip under state law a superintendent must approve a home
[57:18.800 --> 57:22.720]  schooling curriculum but according to investigators the Cressy's never
[57:22.720 --> 57:27.040]  submitted one in the seven years they live in the district they didn't submit
[57:27.040 --> 57:31.280]  it held accountable here all the parents it's not the school's fault the schools
[57:31.280 --> 57:34.680]  are doing the right thing pause trying to get so see this whole article this
[57:34.680 --> 57:38.200]  whole piece is about how oh the government's not doing enough they've
[57:38.200 --> 57:42.320]  got to track down more of these people that want to live free and the cops are
[57:42.320 --> 57:46.560]  up there oh this is very serious these parents are very bad we keep counting on
[57:46.560 --> 57:49.560]  the parents do the right thing let me let me tell them something though since
[57:49.560 --> 57:53.400]  last night when I saw this article in the comments on the CBS news page even
[57:53.400 --> 57:57.720]  before we linked to it and all our listeners went on there it said this is
[57:57.720 --> 58:02.960]  martial law this is Nazi Germany this story is baloney these parents should
[58:02.960 --> 58:06.840]  not have been arrested for this there's no abuse here I'm sick and tired of our
[58:06.840 --> 58:16.400]  freedoms being stripped and it goes on and on and on every single commenter I

[1:00:56.560 --> 1:01:05.040]  homeschooling on the animal ID premises ID and on the naked body scanners that's
[1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:15.840]  the subjects 1-800-259-9231 I know some stations just joined us CBF news out of
[1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:25.080]  a rural area of New York State and Glen Town as it's called this family
[1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:28.760]  upstanding members of the community homeschooling their children they came
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:34.560]  in a resident for homeschooling not registering their children with them and
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:39.520]  states start this slow oh just with the health department that's the eugenics
[1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:45.040]  department that's what CPS is under just send us a form so we know they're in
[1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:48.720]  school and then it's oh comply with our curriculum and oh we're banning that
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:53.920]  California's already tried that and got beaten in court they the city of Austin
[1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:57.360]  policy is to get rid of roads and make you take trains and buses that's the
[1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:01.360]  official policy same thing nationwide they want you out of your cars they
[1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:06.040]  want you bankrupt they want your children in their schools they are a slave cult
[1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:13.480]  we are becoming slaves finish up with the cop we held accountable here the
[1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:17.480]  parents it's not the school's fault the schools are doing the right thing trying
[1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:21.840]  to get the parents to file the proper paperwork which they have now
[1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:27.360]  policies have now submitted rewind it file the proper paperwork they didn't
[1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:31.000]  call them and say hey this is a little civil matter no they went and charged
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:35.960]  them with child endangerment because the CPS swore out an order the CPS are now
[1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:42.520]  judge jury and executioner they're little petty commissar Stalin dictators and
[1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:46.680]  then there's the media pushing the police pushing pushing the school pushing
[1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:50.840]  the superintendent you better arrest more people see that's how they create the
[1:02:50.840 --> 1:02:54.880]  false dichotomy now every person commenting on the CBS site says this is
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:58.120]  outrageous this is Nazi Germany this is police state you people need to be
[1:02:58.120 --> 1:03:05.520]  sued your criminals and they did miss apply child endangerment to this they
[1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:09.760]  made an example but every person reading it and seeing it sees through it
[1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:15.400]  every person I read the comments last night hundreds of more today every one
[1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:21.840]  of them sees through you people I think they've gone too far too fast but see
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:24.840]  the media creates the false dichotomy as if the police and school haven't done
[1:03:24.840 --> 1:03:30.040]  enough because people psychologically like to have a choice and so the false
[1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:34.000]  choices put out do you know do we arrest them or do we take their children
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:37.480]  you know we arrested them but is that enough and what can we do more to hunt
[1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:43.320]  down these slaves instead of was this right to do how was America turned into
[1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:48.440]  this finish up the clip is this which this this woman will be hurt by the

[1:08:00.880 --> 1:08:06.360]  of the revolution today the Genesis communications radio network probably
[1:08:06.360 --> 1:08:13.440]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[1:08:13.440 --> 1:08:17.600]  have you read the Declaration of Independence with King George III was
[1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:24.160]  doing in our country it wasn't one-tenth of the abuse and corruption that we're
[1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:29.520]  now under by any yardstick by any measurement by any gauge we are living
[1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:32.840]  in a science-fiction-esque
[1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:43.120]  satirical over-the-top ridiculous level of tyranny I mean it's it's a joke it's
[1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:49.680]  so ridiculous it's worse than any Kurt Vonnegut novel about a futuristic police
[1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:57.160]  state on Titan I mean it is a joke we are being inducted by a bunch of
[1:08:57.160 --> 1:09:02.640]  psychiatrists and psych warfare experts into a hellhole you know when I get up
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:05.400]  here on air and I mentioned the Associated Press from what was it three
[1:09:05.400 --> 1:09:08.880]  four years ago and I've seen it all over the country from Michigan what was the
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:12.480]  headline I know we're all in that daily that a story we did a story at info wars
[1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:17.480]  calm that guy search this right now for people
[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:26.960]  Michigan school drill demonizes homeschoolers are something like that
[1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:32.280]  and I think the AP headline was parents angry about police safety drill at
[1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:40.360]  school Michigan AP and then it says and I've been to these drills but I've been
[1:09:40.360 --> 1:09:45.040]  to announced ones once they get you trained to the announced ones I went to
[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:50.480]  one in Belton where they have regular army checkpoint drills we have that in
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:53.960]  police state do the takeover the police come over with the military and say

[1:14:07.400 --> 1:14:12.760]  horrible it's so evil it's the worst ladies and gentlemen you know in the
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:18.640]  last eight years tourism is down close to 40% in the US no one wants to come
[1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:23.520]  here people from other countries know when they see police in black mask man
[1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:27.600]  this is North Korea Mexico I better get out of here when people see cameras
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:30.480]  everywhere tourism's down in England they say this isn't freedom I'm out of
[1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:35.640]  here when people I mean I've got mainstream news articles today where
[1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:46.440]  pro-war neocons assigned to the Pentagon as in bed reporters come back and have
[1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:50.800]  their laptops taken have their email passcodes taken the TSA sits there and
[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:54.760]  read your email in front of you they ask how much money do you make and the guy
[1:14:54.760 --> 1:15:01.080]  wouldn't tell them after 20 questions or more and so they arrested him that's on
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:13.400]  prisonplanet.com and that's how it is now in Europe and Canada I have been in
[1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:18.520]  rooms with Canadian police while they are laughing and smiling and saying we're
[1:15:18.520 --> 1:15:24.200]  gonna put you in prison and literally getting off on trying to scare me I have
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:30.320]  seen them feeding in pure Soviet Nazi evil screaming at me off and on for 15
[1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:37.280]  hours laughing at me telling me I was gonna go to a Canadian prison for no
[1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:45.920]  reason in Rockwall Texas I had the school police officer before we moved
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:56.320]  here when I was a sophomore I had him call me in and say we know you're
[1:15:56.320 --> 1:16:02.480]  stealing stereo systems from happy country homes a trailer part 10 miles
[1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:07.800]  from where I lived and I said what are you talking about happy country homes I
[1:16:07.800 --> 1:16:13.800]  think I've been there one time to fly a remote control airplane with a friend
[1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:18.760]  years before I told him that he said don't lie to me I know you stealing
[1:16:18.760 --> 1:16:23.600]  stereos and ladies and gentlemen I never stole anything but beer out of ice
[1:16:23.600 --> 1:16:27.720]  chest on the back of golf carts I lived in the you know middle-class golf cart
[1:16:27.720 --> 1:16:31.040]  neighborhood a time I was 14 a few times would be at the lake house of the
[1:16:31.040 --> 1:16:34.200]  country club and we'd laugh and reach in and get I told him that I said I've
[1:16:34.200 --> 1:16:39.760]  taken beer and he said well I know you really didn't steal that but I'm gonna
[1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:43.480]  charge you with it unless you start reporting to me on crime and I said
[1:16:43.480 --> 1:16:54.240]  crime I mean I was a jock ladies and gentlemen I was chasing cheerleaders my
[1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:58.960]  only crime was when somebody would punch me in the face I'd punch him back a
[1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:02.520]  little too hard and this was being done to everybody in the school it was a
[1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:06.080]  giant brainwashing reeducation center what do you think goes on in a Soviet
[1:17:06.080 --> 1:17:10.120]  reeducation center everything we're talking about her today the
[1:17:10.120 --> 1:17:13.920]  traumatization the threats that telling people to report on folks breaking
[1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:18.000]  everybody down and I knew that cop was involved in narcotics trafficking
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:25.520]  everybody knew the sheriff had gone to jail for flying in cocaine that guy on
[1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:33.880]  businesses in town that guy drove a brand-new Corvette I mean this
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:42.600]  government is pure evil I'm good I'm straight I'm strong I'm not bad you are
[1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:47.880]  and you're not gonna tell the American people they're bad anymore and so in
[1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:50.720]  Belton the mayor got up and announced they've been hit by terrorists and I
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:55.080]  instantly knew that at the end of his 10-minute press conference he would then
[1:17:55.080 --> 1:17:58.720]  say this is just a drill they announced we've been hit they announced terrorists
[1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:02.280]  have hit and I instantly knew would be in the newspaper the next day that they
[1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:05.520]  would write a whole article about how terrorists hit and then only at the end
[1:18:05.520 --> 1:18:08.800]  say it was just a drill to create and elicit the fear and to create the
[1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:14.720]  perception that terrorism was real so that local communities could be fully
[1:18:14.720 --> 1:18:18.920]  federalized and accept covert Pentagon operations from narcotics trafficking to
[1:18:18.920 --> 1:18:24.840]  you name it and I went outside and more troops came over and threatened us and
[1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:32.240]  then they blew up a car fire shooting out and then they had the local middle
[1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:36.040]  school drama team put fake blood all over them and roll around on the ground
[1:18:36.040 --> 1:18:44.440]  for news cameras and that's all in road to tyranny now now what do they do
[1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:49.160]  nationwide now they go into public schools children as young as five years
[1:18:49.160 --> 1:18:54.360]  of age come in with men screaming I'm going to kill you I'm a home schooler
[1:18:54.360 --> 1:19:00.240]  I'm a gun owner I'm a home schooler against public education that was in the
[1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:06.280]  federal script in Michigan done all over the state and they take the kids out
[1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:11.160]  and blow up a bus and then throw buckets of fake blood on them and the
[1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:14.640]  children scream and cry we have video of it and road to tyranny from other
[1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:19.120]  schools as little girls cry little five six seven-year-olds with police dogs
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:25.800]  this is the pure evil the pure brainwashing the pure scientific death
[1:19:25.800 --> 1:19:31.440]  oozing and creeping through every facet of our lives and I can see it you can
[1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:37.520]  see it you know what's going on you take over your local towns you can do it
[1:19:37.520 --> 1:19:42.520]  peaceably if you get aggressive and serious and knock on every door if our

[1:19:47.480 --> 1:19:52.360]  of blood the least you can do is bang on doors and warn people and go

[1:21:37.960 --> 1:21:41.720]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists they're asking for more
[1:21:41.720 --> 1:21:45.640]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to. Today seems
[1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:51.280]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[1:24:04.200 --> 1:24:22.840]  the government knows what it's doing is the people arm themselves in mass and
[1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:29.680]  prepare for war they want conflict they want to baptize their paramilitary
[1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:38.840]  police in the fire of war they want to plunge this country into civil war they
[1:24:38.840 --> 1:24:42.280]  back the people into a corner
[1:24:43.720 --> 1:24:50.920]  each new outrage worse than the previous try to break our will and wet us
[1:24:50.920 --> 1:25:02.400]  the blackest form of tyranny this planet has ever seen we all need to
[1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:09.160]  prepare ourselves and to work as hard as we can to alert the people to the true
[1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:15.640]  enemy of humanity the social engineers of the new world order Ron in Texas you're
[1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:21.880]  on the air welcome I think that the spirit of crazy horses got you charged
[1:25:21.880 --> 1:25:27.600]  up again great um first off I want to make a quick comment in reference to a
[1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:34.080]  last bit of yesterday's transmission okay you are not a bad person you are
[1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:38.120]  doing everything you possibly can I was being sarcastic when the guy called in
[1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:43.800]  griping saying we didn't have mp3 files when we do I know I know but what
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:48.480]  has to be off is people like that and like I still I called you once before
[1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:53.720]  in reference to you know Ted Nugent and the apathy thing he mentioned that is
[1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:58.440]  the example of what he was saying it is up to us to take what you give us and
[1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:02.760]  spread that out you know there was a challenge that was given to me by a
[1:26:02.760 --> 1:26:07.000]  certain young lady to start up a website and I did right on snakespit.com it's
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:13.520]  just that now as far as this scanning thing I was using the same technology in
[1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:19.720]  Iraq at ECP3 our directive was not to scan females our directive was only to
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:26.880]  scan males I was confronted by a CIA operative as to why we weren't doing the
[1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:32.400]  females I said it is immorally wrong for one and it was not my directive he got
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:36.600]  mad now let's be clear when you lock down the city or a town and are issuing
[1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:40.040]  people ID cards correct me if I'm wrong but I've seen it in person in military
[1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:43.880]  drills here in the U.S. and U.S. cities they biometrically scan you and then
[1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:47.800]  give you an ID card people don't know that this is really being used as a
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:53.120]  biometric scan you may not have even been told but let's point that out that
[1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:58.040]  even in Iraq and I'd also read that that they weren't scanning females so you
[1:26:58.040 --> 1:27:02.520]  were in Iraq and didn't want to scan females what happened okay we I was
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:06.840]  confronted since I was the NCO I see of that operation at that time the unit we
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:11.200]  took over for was having a memorial service for one of their fallen and the
[1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:15.640]  unit we took over even specifically told us they do not do this the sex scanning
[1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:21.400]  of the females so we for falling the same standard of operation policy now
[1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:25.920]  this particular person he out of he was nude at that point or he was just
[1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:28.840]  getting fed up a nugget and that information or what to in front of me
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:34.920]  about it and I told him no I am not going to do it that is immorally wrong on my
[1:27:34.920 --> 1:27:41.960]  behalf you know how I love you but stop Ron let's make this point remember two
[1:27:41.960 --> 1:27:45.880]  years ago the head of the Air Force the civilian head of the Air Force I forget
[1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:48.800]  his title the director of the Air Force I believe it was in the Associated Press
[1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:55.240]  the headline was director of Air Force says use sound and microwave weapons on
[1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:58.920]  citizens first because under Geneva Convention they couldn't use them on
[1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:04.040]  Iraqis but then by deploying them in the U.S. they could then list it as not a
[1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:07.240]  weapon of war and so now they've done that it's the same thing with the
[1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:13.400]  scanners we are the most enslaved go ahead yeah exactly so an alternative if
[1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:16.920]  they were doing was using the wands all the females and only the female
[1:28:16.920 --> 1:28:20.720]  interpreters we had where the only ones that were doing it anyway the
[1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:23.400]  confrontation he said well I'm gonna go to your commander who's your commander
[1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:29.480]  I'm not gonna tell you you find that out for yourself and you know where you
[1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:32.720]  went how long were you in Iraq I mean when I talk about the military being
[1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:36.520]  turned against us I know the military is really waking up the police are waking
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:39.920]  up but are you still in are you out do you talk to your bodies are they way
[1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:46.040]  recently was medically retired just just past October were people waking up to
[1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:50.480]  this insanity that's going on there are quite a few believe it or not that are
[1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:54.720]  and there are quite a few believe it or not that know that there are these
[1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:59.320]  things that going on that don't sit well in their gut well here's an example I
[1:28:59.320 --> 1:29:04.160]  have a lot of family in the military a lot of them officers and they've they've
[1:29:04.160 --> 1:29:07.600]  told me at barbecues and family events they say I don't even want anyone to
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:11.400]  know you're my family I wouldn't get promoted if it was known and they said
[1:29:11.400 --> 1:29:15.920]  Alex you're absolutely right we are doing takeover drills one of them is in
[1:29:15.920 --> 1:29:20.800]  logistics not even in combat he wasn't combat brigades before but now he's
[1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:25.400]  over logistics he said all of us are being trained for riot control and the
[1:29:25.400 --> 1:29:30.160]  officers were told it's for America they're training all units to take on
[1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:33.720]  the American people because the banks have robbed us blind stay there Ron I
[1:29:33.720 --> 1:29:37.240]  want you to finish up with your take on how we boycott these scanners how we
[1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:42.200]  expose it I got some of my own ideas coming up in Virgil Jason John John and

[1:32:05.720 --> 1:32:10.080]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[1:32:10.080 --> 1:32:14.440]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[1:32:14.440 --> 1:32:18.720]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[1:32:18.720 --> 1:32:23.080]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[1:32:23.080 --> 1:32:27.160]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:31.720]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:32:31.720 --> 1:32:35.840]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:39.800]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[1:32:39.800 --> 1:32:43.640]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[1:32:43.640 --> 1:32:46.360]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from
[1:32:46.360 --> 1:32:51.600]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolar
[1:32:51.600 --> 1:32:56.080]  backup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the
[1:32:56.080 --> 1:33:17.920]  sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:27.520]  Ron anything else you wanted to add about body scanners in Iraq not scanning
[1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:33.160]  women I've seen blurbs can't place when years ago about the controversy of
[1:33:33.160 --> 1:33:38.040]  scanning Iraqi women but again American women and children naked body
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:43.600]  scan them we're the home of the cowards home of the slaves or are we I have some
[1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:49.120]  ideas of ways to protest this ways to boycott this ways to educate people and
[1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:55.000]  we're going to do that but going back to Ron and then Virgil Jason John John and
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:34:00.400]  others finish up Ron here's the thing like I said you know I protested that
[1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:04.120]  and of course I was only there just for that one time just to fill in and
[1:34:04.120 --> 1:34:08.200]  unfortunately I couldn't say all I know is that when we were there we didn't do
[1:34:08.200 --> 1:34:13.120]  it you know I told my guys we're not going to do it and I didn't care if I
[1:34:13.120 --> 1:34:18.880]  lost my rank or what because morally I did not like the idea you know now as
[1:34:18.880 --> 1:34:23.840]  far as here before I went into the army I had the fortunate ability to study law
[1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:29.080]  a little bit before I went into active duty and I do know and I kind of got the
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:35.040]  idea from Dr. Horowitz in relation to the H1N1 vaccine where people were
[1:34:35.040 --> 1:34:43.080]  filing injunctions in regards to preventing being forced to take the
[1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:47.880]  vaccine it is possible I'm trying to look it up now for sure we're going
[1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:51.160]  through the code of federal regulations and other cases I haven't seen
[1:34:51.160 --> 1:34:55.880]  anything where it hasn't been done yet but it is possible that we can all as a
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:35:03.960]  people file federal injunctions to keep us from being scanned because it is not
[1:35:03.960 --> 1:35:09.900]  a federally mandated law yes exactly it's a regulation it's a policy of TSA and
[1:35:09.900 --> 1:35:15.920]  Homeland Security and ICE what they do is they come into a governmental system a
[1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:22.400]  airport public private they make deals with the airlines the commercial
[1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:25.240]  aviation does it nobody has to do it there to fly their Cessna or their
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:29.320]  private jet or to charter a jet and then everyone is herded through and
[1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:34.440]  indoctrinated and now TSA says they're going nationwide with body scanners random
[1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:39.040]  vans checkpoints it's already happening this is so incredible yes we need people
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:44.320]  to file injunctions I was just talking to my IT guy a month ago going through
[1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:47.960]  Houston which I will not fly through and I appreciate your call Ron I will not
[1:35:47.960 --> 1:35:52.680]  fly through George Herbert Walker Bush Airport because I've flown
[1:35:52.680 --> 1:36:00.040]  internationally through there twice and literally literally they scream and
[1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:04.640]  yell at you and say hustle hustle hustle and they freak out and panic and
[1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:12.960]  they wave their arms I mean it's like animals or something at the TSA and my
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:19.280]  parents went to a wedding for one of my cousins in Mexico she got married down
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:22.720]  there one of those resort weddings and my poor grandmother who had polio in the
[1:36:22.720 --> 1:36:29.360]  50s and is on crutches 85 86 years old today I said what was it like when you
[1:36:29.360 --> 1:36:34.960]  went through Houston and they said it was hell screaming at her to hurry up I
[1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:39.040]  mean it's shit folks we just they might as well just put us in loincloths and
[1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:43.720]  slave pits oh but it's to keep us safe because the government cares so much
[1:36:43.720 --> 1:36:51.080]  about us oh yes everyone knows that's a fraud the Pentagon conquered the world
[1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:55.800]  they're now conquering us and they mean to hurt us bad and the average person
[1:36:55.800 --> 1:36:58.520]  the military means well they're compartmentalized I've known I've seen
[1:36:58.520 --> 1:37:04.040]  these new National Guard TV ads where they play all this crazy creepy music and
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:10.840]  it says mission comes first even above the Constitution is the message let's
[1:37:10.840 --> 1:37:15.040]  talk to Virgil in Oklahoma Virgil you're on the air hey Alex how you doing man
[1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:20.680]  I'm just sick with anger and disgust I mean how obvious how much is the
[1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:26.560]  government arresting homeschooler parents naked body scanners spiking the
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:29.880]  water with poison the media openly saying they want to put lithium in the
[1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:34.880]  water to make us feel better just wall-to-wall government tyranny oh man
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:39.600]  keep up the fight I wanted to let you know sometimes you have a habit of like
[1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:43.840]  answering my questions while I'm on hold I've hung up on you a couple times but
[1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:48.160]  I heard you mentioned earlier that your bloodline goes all the way back to the
[1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:52.320]  early American pre-revolution and I want to let you know mind does as well and
[1:37:52.320 --> 1:37:57.880]  also here's an idea for stopping the whole subverting of a human culture
[1:37:57.880 --> 1:38:02.560]  some hacker out there needs to turn off all the TVs just upload a virus to a
[1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:08.120]  satellite boom thanks all have a nice day well Virgil the issue is the
[1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:12.720]  government's already attacked their own satellites as a pretext to then bring in
[1:38:12.720 --> 1:38:18.680]  more controls and that's not how the system set up okay you need to reach
[1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:22.880]  out and show people how they've been indoctrinated incrementally into total
[1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:28.560]  enslavement and how the curtains falling the doors are shutting on freedom
[1:38:28.560 --> 1:38:34.520]  okay and how it's their destiny and their responsibility to stand up against
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:42.400]  tyranny John in Florida you're on the air go ahead yeah thanks for having me
[1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:47.440]  I just got a a quick thing about the body scanning in the airport and stuff
[1:38:47.440 --> 1:38:52.720]  like that over over the Christmas break here I had a really good friend of mine
[1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:56.760]  travel in through I he went to New Jersey and then came back he had no
[1:38:56.760 --> 1:39:01.860]  problems getting getting there to New Jersey and then they had the whole scare
[1:39:01.860 --> 1:39:07.400]  of the of the supposed bomber on Christmas Day and he returned three days
[1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:14.360]  ago he's on oxygen he's got a COPD he has to have oxygen to breathe he has
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:20.280]  himself one of the portable portable concentrators that is FAA approved ways
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:24.800]  about 17 pounds flashing lights and the tubes and wires and stuff coming out of
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:28.720]  it and they they gave him a hard time trying to get it through security so
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:33.600]  that they had him taken apart and they look I've had TSA ask me what a video
[1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:40.680]  camera is I mean they take your laptops now and just keep them and take
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:44.680]  everything off of them no warrant it's just it's total criminality it's the
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:49.320]  feds taking over through the airports now openly expanding all over the nation
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:53.800]  to warrantless checkpoints everywhere with the army and Marines well so they
[1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:58.680]  he gets on the plane and they tell him ma they tell him he can't he can't have it
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:03.080]  running and when this thing's not running it's not pumping off oxygen i.e. he
[1:40:03.080 --> 1:40:07.720]  can't breathe so they let him they were on the time back for about 15 minutes
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:11.320]  before they finally took off and about a half hour later when they got to cruising
[1:40:11.320 --> 1:40:15.160]  altitude okay you can turn it on the whole time the guys having trouble
[1:40:15.160 --> 1:40:19.080]  trying to breathe and everything could have possibly died but see it's an act of
[1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:23.720]  submission you will keep your face forward you will not get up in the last
[1:40:23.720 --> 1:40:27.880]  hour you will not cover your lap you will wear a taser bracelet we will scan
[1:40:27.880 --> 1:40:31.840]  your naked body you will take your shoes off you will take your belt off we will
[1:40:31.840 --> 1:40:35.120]  take your laptop without a warrant and keep it and download everything and keep
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:40.040]  it for six months in many cases we are the masters you are the slave we will
[1:40:40.040 --> 1:40:43.880]  arrest you if you don't public school your kids we will put trips on the
[1:40:43.880 --> 1:40:47.440]  streets we will let offshore banks still 28 trillion and not tell you where the
[1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:52.560]  money went I mean they're just openly rubbing our faces in it
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:56.360]  absolutely absolutely so when I was talking with him about this yesterday
[1:40:56.360 --> 1:41:01.200]  a lady overheard our conversation and she was all for the body scanners and
[1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:06.040]  this and that and I was trying to explain to her why the body scanners were
[1:41:06.040 --> 1:41:10.400]  not cool and my whole point I was trying to notice they say underwear bomber
[1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:14.240]  we're all in danger by the way we just so happened to just you know we're gonna
[1:41:14.240 --> 1:41:18.140]  put these scanners in next week and now it's all over the news that they
[1:41:18.140 --> 1:41:21.320]  ordered the scanners a year before just like I told you it was all a staged
[1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:26.680]  event ladies and gentlemen all scripted to a T my whole point I was trying to
[1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:30.280]  make to her that she she couldn't understand as the fact that standing in
[1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:35.480]  the scanner is like standing inside of a microwave so I took the I asked her if
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:39.640]  she would stand out in public naked with no clothes on no bra no underwear
[1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:44.240]  well absolutely not no I wouldn't do that and then I explained to her what the
[1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:48.120]  body scanners do they you sit there and they look at your naked body without
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:53.120]  your basically with your consent and they record it and she still didn't want
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:57.000]  to understand it and she was trying to tell me it's prejudiced to try to pick
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:00.800]  and choose who you can scan and I mean oh yeah that's part of the fake liberal
[1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:04.760]  religion you know even if you believe these Muslim extremists are trying to
[1:42:04.760 --> 1:42:09.120]  get us in every case they're funded and it's all staged they go well we're
[1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:13.720]  liberal everyone gets body scanned including the women and that's all part
[1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:19.120]  of breaking up the family many colleges now have co-ed bathrooms I mean I don't
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:22.120]  like going in a bathroom and sitting on the commode next to a guy in the next
[1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:26.320]  stall I'll kind of wait till people are out of there all over the country and in
[1:42:26.320 --> 1:42:31.160]  the military you've got to sit there on a commode right next to a woman imagine
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:35.920]  what she thinks again it's destroying all the existing order normal human
[1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:39.760]  activity because normal human instincts will make you stand up against being a
[1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:44.240]  slave family will make you stick up for your family they're get we they are on
[1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:48.840]  record wanting to turn us into a bunch of drug zombie serving them I appreciate
[1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:56.400]  your call I've come up with some of my own ideas to stand up against this we're
[1:42:56.400 --> 1:43:00.920]  gonna go back to John and England Joe in Texas and Ryan in Alaska and then
[1:43:00.920 --> 1:43:06.280]  Alan Watts coming up we're gonna continue to have open phones with him but I want
[1:43:06.280 --> 1:43:09.640]  to give you some of my ideas right now I'm formulating these completing them by
[1:43:09.640 --> 1:43:15.560]  next week and we'll launch the official operation you're welcome to start your
[1:43:15.560 --> 1:43:19.720]  own operation you're welcome to use our ideas and don't give us credit I don't
[1:43:19.720 --> 1:43:28.720]  care I want to win this mission the cost are too high ladies and gentlemen if we
[1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:34.680]  let them win the penalties are too high there is no choice this scum must be
[1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:38.640]  identified the public must be given the basic information once they're given it
[1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:42.480]  they'll start seeing it all for themselves see the enemy has to reapply
[1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:47.840]  lies every day it's like a coat of paint that peels off every five minutes the
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:53.240]  truth is a coat of paint that never peels off we apply the truth show
[1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:56.480]  somebody how to think how they've been manipulated one time you get them to
[1:43:56.480 --> 1:44:05.760]  finally unlock open their mind and we're not filling people's minds with stuff
[1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:10.040]  we're just saying you folks we've studied history this is hardcore tyranny
[1:44:10.040 --> 1:44:14.160]  red alert please look around you it's like having you're out in the wilderness
[1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:21.680]  with a couple people and a bunch of wolves come to the rest of the hill and
[1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:30.040]  they're like blind I mean the best analogy is like having there's 10
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:33.840]  people and nine of them are blind and you hear the wolves howling and they're
[1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:36.400]  in denial all that's not wolves and you don't have any weapons and the wolves
[1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:41.400]  around you there's 20 30 wolves and finally when one of the people gets
[1:44:41.400 --> 1:44:46.440]  grabbed and dragged off and you hear them screaming and yelling and pain the
[1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:50.320]  the and I'm not attacking blind people here this is just an analogy and the
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:53.640]  blind folks have been so conditioned that they look at you and say are you
[1:44:53.640 --> 1:45:00.360]  hurting Bob to prove to us there are wolves are you doing that that's how the
[1:45:00.360 --> 1:45:08.800]  basic psychology works but the people are finally seeing the wolves are what
[1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:13.120]  they are but the wolves have their own propaganda system of how they're not
[1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:18.880]  wolves and how those of us trying to warn you are the wolves use your common
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:22.000]  sense people have respect for yourselves now I'll go ahead and throw these ideas
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.720]  out yes we said yesterday I'm getting a lot of emails about it thinking it's a
[1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:33.280]  good idea I'm not made out of money here but we're gonna have a $5,000 contest
[1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:39.120]  for the best naked body scanner poster and follow your local laws what's
[1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:43.640]  applicable but I think if they're gonna naked body scan everybody I personally
[1:45:43.640 --> 1:45:46.280]  I'm gonna put up some posters that show the image of the naked woman that we
[1:45:46.280 --> 1:45:53.360]  posted on info wars.com people have a right to know what is really being
[1:45:53.360 --> 1:45:55.560]  seen
[1:45:58.040 --> 1:46:03.120]  we're gonna have a boycott of the airlines and a boycott of the scanners
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:11.300]  poster contest my wife had the idea of what we've seen PETA do a couple good
[1:46:11.300 --> 1:46:17.400]  looking PETA girls go to Tokyo take their tops off walk down Main Street it's in
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:23.560]  the cover of USA Today and hundreds of newspapers and magazines now most cities
[1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:27.840]  and then you can get them on discrimination of their rescue they've
[1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:31.040]  had the artist things with everybody by the thousands naked out in the town
[1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:34.800]  square they've had the the demonstrations where people are you know
[1:46:34.800 --> 1:46:42.320]  better go naked than fur for stupid issues it's up to you to do this and
[1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:47.600]  it's you know your your issue you know there's tyrants out there but don't get
[1:46:47.600 --> 1:46:51.720]  on the airport property do it on the edge of the highway on the sidewalk where
[1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:57.320]  panties I don't think you should go completely naked but you get a bunch of
[1:46:57.320 --> 1:47:01.320]  women this is where women can save the Republic and you're gonna be recorded
[1:47:01.320 --> 1:47:07.440]  anyways put a government database you get a bunch of women naked to go to
[1:47:07.440 --> 1:47:13.880]  federal courthouses and TSA facilities and the outside of airports and you
[1:47:13.880 --> 1:47:18.000]  stand out there with your placards and you call the media beforehand and you
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:22.120]  come out there ladies and gentlemen it will devastate them and and you point
[1:47:22.120 --> 1:47:28.720]  out that that I don't want to be recorded naked in your database this is
[1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:35.040]  what it so the idiot public can get it if we can beat these naked body scanners
[1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:37.960]  where they want to set the precedent and make people do this to where you
[1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:44.880]  submit to them it's all about breaking your will breaking your soul I don't
[1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:48.360]  want to horrify people I actually don't look that bad naked I've been told I
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:56.440]  look better naked but for the country I'll I'll go out there and in speedos I
[1:47:56.440 --> 1:48:05.000]  just cannot do the whole deal but the stunt can save the Republic and so we
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:16.640]  need to pick a date in the next month or simultaneously nationwide people to
[1:48:16.640 --> 1:48:23.080]  strip bear and go out and educate the moron population and you might get
[1:48:23.080 --> 1:48:26.360]  arrested but then in court I'll have to drop it because it's all been held in
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:31.000]  the court cases if it's free speech or it's done for art they can't stop you
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:42.800]  but ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen we have to do this desperate

[2:00:47.200 --> 2:00:52.840]  me yes sir right um you know one of the biggest tricks of the new world order
[2:00:52.840 --> 2:00:58.080]  the scientific dictatorship prey on us is emasculating people making them feel
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:04.040]  we can power yeah not feel powerful in order to beat these people what we have
[2:01:04.040 --> 2:01:08.080]  to do is we have to take take our power back and take inspiration from Martin
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:13.960]  Luther King Gandhi Henry Thoreau and become civil rights leaders because sit
[2:01:13.960 --> 2:01:17.520]  there on our asses getting fat waiting for someone else to go out and change the
[2:01:17.520 --> 2:01:21.800]  world but I agree with you but but the system it tells us who the new civil
[2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:25.440]  rights activists are you know the new civil rights is the government being
[2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:29.600]  able to teach seven-year-olds how to fist and the new civil right is having
[2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:33.120]  your children body scanned by the pervert government that sexually tortures
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:37.160]  everybody worldwide that's their favorite we need to define that it's
[2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:42.000]  liberty and freedom in the Constitution go ahead exactly what they've done is
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:47.120]  they've co-opted all these wonderful causes such as freedom and liberty and
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:52.160]  libertarianism and they've provided them it's like um I agree by the Federal
[2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:56.240]  Reserve claiming to be a libertarian it's just complete rubbish they've taken
[2:01:56.240 --> 2:01:58.920]  all these labor causes and they've provided them we have to take them back
[2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:02.440]  we have to take them back ourselves as civil rights leaders and we have to
[2:02:02.440 --> 2:02:09.720]  identify the system is criminal and lying scum absolutely absolutely look
[2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:13.440]  look 50 years ago everybody knew not to trust the government and to keep it
[2:02:13.440 --> 2:02:17.880]  small okay it's common sense we're gonna get hurt real bad by it and learn the
[2:02:17.880 --> 2:02:22.120]  lesson but the globalists have studied revolutions and resistance and peaceful
[2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:28.000]  renaissance and they are scientifically trying to block it exactly and they
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:31.480]  take it from the left and they take it from the right not the folks left my
[2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:35.440]  paradigm they they they they cut they cut everything and they pervert
[2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:38.840]  everything and they twist everything but we have to take we have to take back
[2:02:38.840 --> 2:02:44.040]  these wonderful ideas from Thomas Jefferson George Washington and be
[2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:46.840]  civil rights leaders ourselves and get out there and that's what groups that we

[2:09:29.600 --> 2:09:35.680]  launch that to boycott and protest that to educate the public because if they
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:38.880]  can break our will with naked body scanners and let you be publicly
[2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:42.080]  humiliated and break your spirit they can get away with anything first it's
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:44.880]  thumbprinting and face scanning to get driver's license then it's take your
[2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:48.800]  shoes off your belt off asked answer questions not being able to have a
[2:09:48.800 --> 2:09:52.480]  blanket in your lap on a plane if you're in the toilet more than 10 minutes they
[2:09:52.480 --> 2:09:57.680]  land the planets national news all these acts of submission all these acts of

[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:36.680]  the intimidation they posted them everywhere and it took this image of
[2:10:36.680 --> 2:10:41.720]  this God Obama and showed him for what he really is a criminal thug we defiled
[2:10:41.720 --> 2:10:47.080]  their God their big daddy figure and it was also an exercise in showing the
[2:10:47.080 --> 2:10:53.160]  people the power of just pampering just posting posters in your local area where
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:56.480]  other people post them where it's legal and lawful or common law lawful they
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:11:00.240]  can't selectively enforce and say oh we've got some old some old county rule

[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:20.480]  even more high-powered scanners that see into the body for hidden bombs under
[2:12:20.480 --> 2:12:25.120]  the skin because they could sew up a bomb under their skin and unsew it in the
[2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:29.360]  bathroom we just just in oh we need to wear taser bracelets they're now saying

[2:13:11.800 --> 2:13:15.920]  learn and you ought to incorporate the images of what the body scan show and
[2:13:15.920 --> 2:13:18.680]  then point out we're doing this because this is what's really happening to you
[2:13:18.680 --> 2:13:22.160]  and if we're gonna have to bear it in here we're gonna bear it out there to
[2:13:22.160 --> 2:13:26.480]  show the public to shock them this is the kind of thing will make them the
[2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:29.440]  government come back to folks this is really effective peaceful stuff this is
[2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:31.840]  what I'm really all about we're taking a big risk doing this I think you
[2:13:31.840 --> 2:13:35.400]  obviously know that is where the tip of the spear we come up with these ideas we
[2:13:35.400 --> 2:13:39.600]  give it with the idea to have the states and the cities swear to the Bill of
[2:13:39.600 --> 2:13:44.200]  Rights 800 plus cities five states passed laws against the Patriot Act saying
[2:13:44.200 --> 2:13:48.200]  their police wouldn't comply with unconstitutional orders that got picked
[2:13:48.200 --> 2:13:52.000]  up by everybody that was very successful I mean how many things have we
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:55.960]  launched they go into press conferences confronting politicians we launched
[2:13:55.960 --> 2:14:00.200]  that code pink everybody else we are change have implemented it we are
[2:14:00.200 --> 2:14:08.360]  change for good coping more than not not for good my wife had this idea why my
[2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:14.600]  wife only for a year work for Peter very pretty and she went to Tokyo and a
[2:14:14.600 --> 2:14:17.760]  few other places and just took her top off and it was the cover of hundreds of
[2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:25.960]  newspapers and magazines against killing whales okay she painted herself up like
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:30.960]  a cheetah and everything and went out there flew to she got arrested too in
[2:14:30.960 --> 2:14:36.800]  Japan but they dropped the charges again everywhere in the country it's legal
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:41.680]  and lawful in Austin they've had a bunch of court cases where women at protest
[2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:45.400]  have been naked and then and then and what was it 15 years ago more they they
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:48.600]  lost the court case so now women you'll be on the hiking bike trail they walk by
[2:14:48.600 --> 2:14:53.600]  naked you know as part of their feminism or whatever the point is this is and we
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:58.240]  were on the green belt the other day I took Aaron and Rob for a five mile hike
[2:14:58.240 --> 2:15:02.400]  little hike this one comes walking by with her top off but you know the I mean
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:06.600]  the point is she wasn't very attractive I'll tell you but that's fine I mean the
[2:15:06.600 --> 2:15:12.240]  issue was is that but this can't wait so we're gonna have a big protest date
[2:15:12.240 --> 2:15:16.760]  where everybody does it I said we can't wait long let's look we'll set that out
[2:15:16.760 --> 2:15:20.760]  in about two weeks from now where everybody who wants to do it the same
[2:15:20.760 --> 2:15:24.200]  date federal courthouses where they're implementing this tyranny off the
[2:15:24.200 --> 2:15:31.480]  property of airports you know the side of the highway at the entrances $10,000
[2:15:31.480 --> 2:15:35.880]  for the best video that'll be judged in a month but I wouldn't wait and again
[2:15:35.880 --> 2:15:43.520]  obviously the number of hits will be important the how effective it is what
[2:15:43.520 --> 2:15:47.920]  you have to say needs to be 10 minutes long or shorter I'm gonna go to Alan
[2:15:47.920 --> 2:15:51.720]  Watt it we're gonna do that I'm talking to lawyers and their experts looking
[2:15:51.720 --> 2:15:55.160]  at the US Code these are federal reservations the airports have been
[2:15:55.160 --> 2:15:58.160]  illegally taken over by the feds their author jurisdiction they're now
[2:15:58.160 --> 2:16:02.280]  metastasizing out with the TSA teams its checkpoints all over the country as we
[2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:05.400]  told you seven years ago they would do searching everyone from Dallas to New
[2:16:05.400 --> 2:16:09.640]  York from Los Angeles to Miami this it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[2:16:09.640 --> 2:16:15.000]  everyone troops on the streets I've got more articles today here we've got
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:17.960]  Color scans of this up on info wars.com.
[2:16:17.960 --> 2:16:19.880]  Here's the black and white color copy.
[2:16:19.880 --> 2:16:23.040]  Clear US Army troops involved in house to house searches
[2:16:23.040 --> 2:16:25.160]  in Massachusetts.
[2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:26.160]  That's all going on.
[2:16:26.160 --> 2:16:27.640]  I mean, we're just being hit from every side,
[2:16:27.640 --> 2:16:30.240]  but these body scanners are the key.
[2:16:30.240 --> 2:16:33.320]  We're like, you know, these different psychological
[2:16:33.320 --> 2:16:35.640]  syndromes where people serve the abuser.
[2:16:38.840 --> 2:16:40.540]  The Stockholm syndrome and others.
[2:16:40.540 --> 2:16:42.360]  We gotta stand up and say, you know what?
[2:16:42.360 --> 2:16:45.240]  We're going to use you trying to humiliate us naked
[2:16:45.240 --> 2:16:47.840]  to make us submit to you with these strip searches
[2:16:47.840 --> 2:16:49.960]  with these men looking at the women and children
[2:16:49.960 --> 2:16:52.020]  and men being scanned and laughing.
[2:16:52.020 --> 2:16:53.400]  All these photos of them smiling
[2:16:53.400 --> 2:16:55.400]  as the naked woman is in the scanner.
[2:16:55.400 --> 2:16:56.320]  This is a strip search.
[2:16:56.320 --> 2:16:57.880]  We've got to show the public that.
[2:16:57.880 --> 2:17:00.280]  Alan Watt, what do you think of my idea?
[2:17:01.160 --> 2:17:02.160]  My wife's idea.
[2:17:02.160 --> 2:17:06.760]  It could go either way, actually.
[2:17:08.040 --> 2:17:10.160]  I was thinking of someone who did that over the last
[2:17:10.160 --> 2:17:14.200]  few years as a big art publicity stunt.
[2:17:14.200 --> 2:17:15.440]  Yeah, they do it in major cities
[2:17:15.440 --> 2:17:17.520]  from New York to Madrid.
[2:17:17.520 --> 2:17:21.560]  Yeah, and so in a sense, it becomes almost acceptable.
[2:17:21.560 --> 2:17:23.840]  And we're also living in a culture
[2:17:23.840 --> 2:17:25.640]  that's been promoting this again
[2:17:25.640 --> 2:17:28.560]  from certain quarters for certain purposes.
[2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:30.320]  Well, Alan, I understand that the globalists
[2:17:30.320 --> 2:17:31.960]  at certain levels have been desensitizing,
[2:17:31.960 --> 2:17:35.120]  but this is using their own system against them.
[2:17:35.120 --> 2:17:37.800]  I think people should all turn up fully clothed
[2:17:37.800 --> 2:17:40.520]  and just put their protest out there.
[2:17:40.520 --> 2:17:41.960]  That's how we want it to stay.
[2:17:41.960 --> 2:17:44.120]  You know, personally, I don't want,
[2:17:44.120 --> 2:17:45.800]  it's plus going to get pushed here
[2:17:45.800 --> 2:17:47.280]  is the fact that they're going to have.
[2:17:47.280 --> 2:17:48.120]  No, no, no, no, Alan,
[2:17:48.120 --> 2:17:50.040]  this is why I disagree with you and I rarely do.
[2:17:50.040 --> 2:17:53.520]  They're making you take your clothes off in the scanner.
[2:17:53.520 --> 2:17:56.840]  We are saying, look at what you want us to do.
[2:17:56.840 --> 2:18:00.560]  I think it's going to be devastating to them, but.
[2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:01.960]  I'll tell you what I would do.
[2:18:01.960 --> 2:18:03.600]  I'll tell you what I would do personally.
[2:18:03.600 --> 2:18:08.400]  I would just take photographs of all the mass graves
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:11.400]  of World War II and the Soviet Union,
[2:18:11.400 --> 2:18:14.840]  of all the naked bodies and having placards of that.
[2:18:14.840 --> 2:18:15.680]  Genius.
[2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:17.640]  And saying, we're not going to end up like this.
[2:18:17.640 --> 2:18:18.640]  No, thank you.
[2:18:18.640 --> 2:18:19.480]  Exactly.
[2:18:19.480 --> 2:18:21.240]  Being unclothed, taking your shoes off,
[2:18:21.240 --> 2:18:24.800]  then all your clothes, it's a supplication.
[2:18:24.800 --> 2:18:27.880]  It's like hurting people in to be shot in pits,
[2:18:27.880 --> 2:18:29.400]  stripping them down naked.
[2:18:29.400 --> 2:18:30.240]  The humility.
[2:18:30.240 --> 2:18:32.080]  Oh man, that's another great thought right there.
[2:18:32.080 --> 2:18:33.120]  That'd be a good poster.
[2:18:33.120 --> 2:18:36.040]  Dead bodies with the image of the naked woman from the scanner
[2:18:36.040 --> 2:18:37.640]  saying, we've seen this before.
[2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:38.680]  Don't airport scan.
[2:18:38.680 --> 2:18:39.560]  Go ahead.
[2:18:39.560 --> 2:18:41.520]  Yeah, because that's where you have to get in.
[2:18:41.520 --> 2:18:43.520]  To where this is going is not fun.
[2:18:43.520 --> 2:18:44.720]  It's not fun.
[2:18:44.720 --> 2:18:45.800]  It's degradation.
[2:18:45.800 --> 2:18:48.960]  It's the dehumanization of the individual
[2:18:48.960 --> 2:18:52.760]  and the people in general, human beings in general.
[2:18:52.760 --> 2:18:54.480]  And it's not going to.
[2:18:54.480 --> 2:18:57.440]  Training as we have no dignity, no privacy.
[2:18:57.440 --> 2:18:59.840]  All the big government making us do it.
[2:18:59.840 --> 2:19:02.400]  Yes, and they've already said that they're going to keep
[2:19:02.400 --> 2:19:04.320]  these fouls forever.
[2:19:04.320 --> 2:19:07.040]  And they can also project how you're going to look
[2:19:07.040 --> 2:19:10.120]  in 10, 20, 30 years time, according to all your profile
[2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:12.360]  in your genetic history in Yadiyah.
[2:19:12.360 --> 2:19:15.040]  And they'll be able to spot you wherever you are in the world.
[2:19:15.040 --> 2:19:16.560]  It's a biometric body scan.
[2:19:16.560 --> 2:19:18.120]  Absolutely, Alan.
[2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:20.320]  So really, what they're telling you is,
[2:19:20.320 --> 2:19:23.000]  not only do you not own your body, you own nothing.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:25.520]  You don't even own the patterns to your own genes.
[2:19:25.520 --> 2:19:27.960]  They're telling you you're a piece of property.
[2:19:27.960 --> 2:19:29.720]  And they're telling us that they take all our babies
[2:19:29.720 --> 2:19:30.400]  blood at birth.
[2:19:30.400 --> 2:19:31.520]  That's now admitted.
[2:19:31.520 --> 2:19:33.560]  Oh, yes, and Australia came out through the fact
[2:19:33.560 --> 2:19:35.560]  they've been doing it for 30 years.
[2:19:35.560 --> 2:19:37.880]  One of the listeners went to get it back from them.
[2:19:37.880 --> 2:19:40.360]  They have them stored up in certain quarters.
[2:19:40.360 --> 2:19:43.280]  He wasn't allowed to get it a hold of it 30 years ago.
[2:19:43.280 --> 2:19:47.920]  Globally implemented 37 years ago.
[2:19:47.920 --> 2:19:48.760]  Absolutely, Alan.
[2:19:48.760 --> 2:19:49.160]  Stay there.
[2:19:49.160 --> 2:19:51.040]  Let's go over the body scanners, the amelioration,
[2:19:51.040 --> 2:19:51.960]  a lot more.
[2:19:51.960 --> 2:19:53.560]  And we want more ideas.
[2:19:53.560 --> 2:19:54.680]  Everybody take action.
[2:19:54.680 --> 2:19:57.840]  We're going to expose the naked body scanners,
[2:19:57.840 --> 2:20:00.800]  shocking the public into seeing how much we're
[2:20:00.800 --> 2:20:03.880]  being made to reveal.
[2:20:03.880 --> 2:20:05.720]  How would you feel with normal blood pressure?
[2:20:05.720 --> 2:20:07.880]  How would you feel with a normal cholesterol reading
[2:20:07.880 --> 2:20:08.960]  without the drugs?

[2:21:03.880 --> 2:21:06.120]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur,
[2:21:06.120 --> 2:21:08.120]  businessman, your congressional candidate,

[2:21:36.640 --> 2:21:38.680]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[2:21:38.680 --> 2:21:40.480]  You need to look out for yourself.
[2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:43.000]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:45.800]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially

[2:22:03.600 --> 2:22:05.840]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[2:22:05.840 --> 2:22:07.600]  January 6th, 2010.
[2:22:07.600 --> 2:22:10.160]  Gold opened this morning at 1126.70.
[2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:13.840]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for 1157.39,
[2:22:13.840 --> 2:22:18.400]  578.70 for a half ounce or 289.35 for the quarter ounce.
[2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:23.600]  That's 1157.39, 578.70, and 289.35.
[2:22:23.600 --> 2:22:25.920]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton,
[2:22:25.920 --> 2:22:27.880]  weave it into fabric, engrave the ink,
[2:22:27.880 --> 2:22:30.880]  embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit,
[2:22:30.880 --> 2:22:33.120]  then cart the money off to a privately owned bank
[2:22:33.120 --> 2:22:34.920]  to have it lent back to us at interest,
[2:22:34.920 --> 2:22:37.200]  forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt.
[2:22:37.200 --> 2:22:40.360]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said,
[2:22:40.360 --> 2:22:43.000]  a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:46.040]  menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[2:22:46.040 --> 2:22:48.760]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar inside
[2:22:48.760 --> 2:22:51.520]  of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[2:22:51.520 --> 2:22:55.440]  Call for your copy, 1-800-686-2237.
[2:22:55.440 --> 2:22:57.400]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[2:22:57.400 --> 2:23:00.240]  Call 800-686-2237.
[2:23:00.240 --> 2:23:03.640]  That's 800-686-2237.
[2:23:03.640 --> 2:23:07.160]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters,
[2:23:07.160 --> 2:23:09.360]  thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[2:23:09.360 --> 2:23:10.280]  Don't.
[2:23:10.280 --> 2:23:13.720]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[2:23:13.720 --> 2:23:17.920]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free?
[2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:20.240]  With New York Times bestselling author,
[2:23:20.240 --> 2:23:22.840]  Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[2:23:22.840 --> 2:23:25.040]  The how to on stopping the calls
[2:23:25.040 --> 2:23:26.880]  without paying the debt companies.
[2:23:26.880 --> 2:23:30.040]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[2:23:30.040 --> 2:23:31.240]  Here's Herb Kay.
[2:23:31.240 --> 2:23:33.360]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies
[2:23:33.360 --> 2:23:35.440]  when I can give you the information you need
[2:23:35.440 --> 2:23:37.480]  to do it yourself for free.
[2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:38.600]  Herb Kay was right.
[2:23:38.600 --> 2:23:40.840]  His free information helped me stop the calls
[2:23:40.840 --> 2:23:41.840]  and settle my debt.
[2:23:41.840 --> 2:23:43.120]  What have you got to lose?
[2:23:43.120 --> 2:23:44.400]  Stop the calls now.
[2:23:44.400 --> 2:23:46.880]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[2:23:46.880 --> 2:23:50.160]  Get Herb Kay's number one debt secret absolutely free.
[2:23:50.160 --> 2:23:55.280]  Now call 888-352-7726.
[2:23:55.280 --> 2:23:59.480]  That's 888-352-7726.
[2:23:59.480 --> 2:24:03.840]  888-352-7726.
[2:24:03.840 --> 2:24:14.520]  There's an article up on prisonplanet.com by Steve Watson
[2:24:14.520 --> 2:24:18.680]  with a headline breaking the will of the people.
[2:24:18.680 --> 2:24:20.280]  The real purpose of body scanners.
[2:24:20.280 --> 2:24:23.120]  And you scroll down, it shows the Nazis and others strip
[2:24:23.120 --> 2:24:26.960]  searching women in World War II.
[2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:29.000]  And that's what this is really all about.
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.960]  Going back to Alan Watt, great idea pointing out
[2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:33.880]  that they always strip you down before they kill you.
[2:24:33.880 --> 2:24:35.800]  And it's a real act of submission.
[2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:38.800]  Do you agree with me that this telling everyone
[2:24:38.800 --> 2:24:41.760]  you will be naked body scanned is a key point
[2:24:41.760 --> 2:24:43.960]  in our conditioning and we must resist it?
[2:24:43.960 --> 2:24:44.720]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:24:44.720 --> 2:24:45.520]  Absolutely.
[2:24:45.520 --> 2:24:47.800]  It's a definite one because Blair
[2:24:47.800 --> 2:24:50.720]  was talking about this long before this happened.
[2:24:50.720 --> 2:24:52.920]  This latest barcical incident.
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:57.640]  And it's an ongoing process of depersonalization,
[2:24:57.640 --> 2:25:01.240]  dehumanization, and getting the public to accept the fact
[2:25:01.240 --> 2:25:02.360]  you're nothing but cattle.
[2:25:02.360 --> 2:25:04.080]  Literally, you're nothing but cattle.
[2:25:04.080 --> 2:25:08.360]  And if you feel small, you start to obey and submit.
[2:25:08.360 --> 2:25:10.440]  Submission is what they're after for what's
[2:25:10.440 --> 2:25:12.480]  coming after this.
[2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:14.080]  But if I was going to have a demonstration,
[2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:16.160]  I'd also have them wear those fake tattoos
[2:25:16.160 --> 2:25:18.240]  on their forearms as well.
[2:25:18.240 --> 2:25:20.840]  Or barcodes and all the rest of it as well.
[2:25:20.840 --> 2:25:23.080]  Just to prove a point, this is all done before.
[2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:25.880]  And this is where it ends up in these pits with bulldozers
[2:25:25.880 --> 2:25:27.480]  pushing bodies into pits.
[2:25:27.480 --> 2:25:30.720]  That's what I'd say.
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:32.520]  That's a great idea.
[2:25:32.520 --> 2:25:34.880]  Hand out images of the women and the naked body
[2:25:34.880 --> 2:25:37.040]  scanners with barcodes on their heads.
[2:25:37.040 --> 2:25:37.960]  Add that.
[2:25:37.960 --> 2:25:40.720]  Or women and men could put barcodes on their heads
[2:25:40.720 --> 2:25:41.560]  on their bodies.
[2:25:41.560 --> 2:25:45.120]  Paint themselves with barcodes as some type of covering.
[2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:47.560]  That's another excellent idea, Alan.
[2:25:47.560 --> 2:25:51.440]  Of course, what comes next here is medicalizing all this.
[2:25:51.440 --> 2:25:53.840]  Taking blood and urine at the checkpoints.
[2:25:53.840 --> 2:25:55.680]  That's already happening under federal grants.
[2:25:55.680 --> 2:25:57.800]  Warrantless taking of blood.
[2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:02.560]  They're also implementing, now announcing the DNA databases.
[2:26:02.560 --> 2:26:06.320]  They've had globally, globally implemented for 37 years.
[2:26:06.320 --> 2:26:09.120]  All of this implantable microchips comes next.
[2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:10.040]  They're pushing that.
[2:26:10.040 --> 2:26:12.560]  They want in our bodies.
[2:26:12.560 --> 2:26:15.200]  Well, they decided a long time ago
[2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:18.360]  that a stage would come where they'd have to eradicate,
[2:26:18.360 --> 2:26:21.080]  gradually eradicate, most of humanity
[2:26:21.080 --> 2:26:24.040]  so that a million people could live in high luxury.
[2:26:24.040 --> 2:26:27.400]  That's a statement stopped out by the United Nations today.
[2:26:27.400 --> 2:26:29.080]  They say that we can either live
[2:26:29.080 --> 2:26:34.360]  at seven or eight billion peasants at a low state of living,
[2:26:34.360 --> 2:26:37.720]  or one million people can live in a high state.
[2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:40.640]  So they're bringing us down through sterilization,
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:42.320]  through the total destruction of the family.
[2:26:42.320 --> 2:26:43.720]  They don't have children.
[2:26:43.720 --> 2:26:46.360]  And it's an ongoing, long-term project.
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:49.360]  But in the meantime, they must further dehumidize.
[2:26:49.360 --> 2:26:54.240]  I mean, it humiliated, submissive to the authorities.
[2:26:54.240 --> 2:26:58.040]  And when you're trained, those techniques of training
[2:26:58.040 --> 2:27:01.680]  is to first break the first priori,
[2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:05.240]  which is self-preservation and rights.
[2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:06.520]  You break that.
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:08.040]  And modesty.
[2:27:08.040 --> 2:27:08.880]  And modesty.
[2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:11.680]  Everybody knows the most evil government strip you.
[2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:15.040]  And what it presents is no privacy.
[2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:17.000]  What do they do when you first come into a prison?
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:20.360]  They strip you into a medical exam to humiliate you.
[2:27:20.360 --> 2:27:23.400]  And they hose you down, yeah.
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:25.160]  They hose you down in front of other prisoners.
[2:27:25.160 --> 2:27:27.640]  And they'll laugh at you, make jokes about you.
[2:27:27.640 --> 2:27:29.120]  And that's all part of it.
[2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:33.240]  To dehumidize, do humiliate the people.
[2:27:33.240 --> 2:27:36.320]  And when they arrested the protesters in my camera guy,
[2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:38.080]  they tortured Luke Radowski and others,
[2:27:38.080 --> 2:27:41.080]  made fun of them when they went to the bathroom,
[2:27:41.080 --> 2:27:44.320]  strung them up naked, and had troops there running it.
[2:27:44.320 --> 2:27:45.000]  Yes.
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:46.120]  Oh, yeah.
[2:27:46.120 --> 2:27:47.840]  And they did joke away and laugh away,
[2:27:47.840 --> 2:27:49.520]  whether you're male or female.
[2:27:49.520 --> 2:27:51.840]  And of course, that's really dehumanizing the soldiers
[2:27:51.840 --> 2:27:52.840]  as well.
[2:27:52.840 --> 2:27:53.400]  It does.
[2:27:53.400 --> 2:27:54.920]  It actually brutalizes them.
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:27:56.640]  It teaches them to be more brutal.
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:27:58.800]  Because it does not think it happens.
[2:27:58.800 --> 2:28:02.840]  It's been tested many times with different experiments
[2:28:02.840 --> 2:28:06.240]  that they get into their roles.
[2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:10.680]  They begin to despise the meek and humble, groveling prisoners.
[2:28:10.680 --> 2:28:11.880]  And they become brutal.
[2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:15.560]  It's a standard fear, standard fear.
[2:28:15.560 --> 2:28:17.800]  And then they have their project hostile intent
[2:28:17.800 --> 2:28:20.120]  with their face scanning or facial expression saying,
[2:28:20.120 --> 2:28:21.400]  oh, you were frowning.
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:23.600]  That's my probable cause that you're a terrorist.
[2:28:23.600 --> 2:28:24.200]  Exactly.
[2:28:24.200 --> 2:28:26.520]  And in fact, they don't like any possible comeback.
[2:28:26.520 --> 2:28:29.040]  They take personally, when you look them in the eye,
[2:28:29.040 --> 2:28:31.200]  and they actually teach special forces what
[2:28:31.200 --> 2:28:34.320]  to do when you're in prison, be humble,
[2:28:34.320 --> 2:28:36.640]  always look at the floor, never look it in the eye.
[2:28:36.640 --> 2:28:39.920]  And remember 1984 when Winston said you had to watch
[2:28:39.920 --> 2:28:41.640]  the look on your face?
[2:28:41.640 --> 2:28:42.440]  We're now here.
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:44.360]  Yeah, this is an old technique you see.
[2:28:44.360 --> 2:28:46.520]  Even with the movie, a very good movie
[2:28:46.520 --> 2:28:48.680]  is called The Madness of King George.
[2:28:48.680 --> 2:28:49.800]  King George was mad.
[2:28:49.800 --> 2:28:52.040]  He had manic depressive doubts.
[2:28:52.040 --> 2:28:53.400]  And they looked at Bilderberg.
[2:28:53.400 --> 2:28:55.080]  They're not allowed to look at him in the face there.
[2:28:55.080 --> 2:28:55.440]  I'm sorry.
[2:28:55.440 --> 2:28:56.680]  Go ahead, King George.
[2:28:56.680 --> 2:28:59.040]  Back then, people don't realize that it was a crime.
[2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:01.880]  It was a crime to look the king in the eye.
[2:29:01.880 --> 2:29:02.880]  An absolute crime.
[2:29:02.880 --> 2:29:04.800]  You were locked up in prison for it.
[2:29:04.800 --> 2:29:06.680]  And that was in 1800s.
[2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:09.200]  And right up into the 1900s, you were not allowed
[2:29:09.200 --> 2:29:10.240]  to look them in the eye.
[2:29:10.240 --> 2:29:11.800]  Hillary Clinton did the same thing
[2:29:11.800 --> 2:29:13.960]  when she was in the White House.
[2:29:13.960 --> 2:29:15.560]  None of the staff could look her in the eye.
[2:29:15.560 --> 2:29:17.480]  It was a major offense.
[2:29:17.480 --> 2:29:20.640]  And this is the standard technique of the psychopath
[2:29:20.640 --> 2:29:23.640]  at the top, who's utterly brutal,
[2:29:23.640 --> 2:29:25.960]  and wants total subservience from all the meat
[2:29:25.960 --> 2:29:27.080]  and humble beneath them.
[2:29:27.080 --> 2:29:29.800]  And the more you comply and be meat and humble,
[2:29:29.800 --> 2:29:32.880]  the more they despise you for being so weak.
[2:29:32.880 --> 2:29:36.960]  And then that legitimizes their abuse of you in their sadomasochistic
[2:29:36.960 --> 2:29:37.280]  minds.
[2:29:37.280 --> 2:29:39.800]  And notice all the torture in Iraq and the secret bases
[2:29:39.800 --> 2:29:40.480]  in Europe.
[2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:41.520]  It's all sexual.
[2:29:41.520 --> 2:29:42.720]  That's been declassified.
[2:29:42.720 --> 2:29:45.200]  Raping children using battery acid.
[2:29:45.200 --> 2:29:48.560]  Jeffrey Dahmer, hell-raiser stuff, is now good.
[2:29:48.560 --> 2:29:50.880]  The psychopaths are turning the whole world's
[2:29:50.880 --> 2:29:54.520]  psychological atmosphere into hell.
[2:29:54.520 --> 2:29:55.920]  We're on the march.
[2:29:55.920 --> 2:29:58.400]  The empire's on the run.
[2:29:58.400 --> 2:30:03.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:03.600 --> 2:30:04.560]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:30:04.560 --> 2:30:06.880]  And I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric
[2:30:06.880 --> 2:30:09.360]  Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right
[2:30:09.360 --> 2:30:10.560]  from the humidity in the air.
[2:30:10.560 --> 2:30:11.880]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[2:30:11.880 --> 2:30:12.640]  It's very real.
[2:30:12.640 --> 2:30:14.920]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[2:30:14.920 --> 2:30:16.560]  And it's available right now to you.

[2:30:43.640 --> 2:30:46.080]  including reverse osmosis, carbon filters,
[2:30:46.080 --> 2:30:47.400]  and ultraviolet lights.

[2:31:03.400 --> 2:31:05.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[2:31:05.400 --> 2:31:07.840]  you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:31:07.840 --> 2:31:10.040]  Number one, new climate legislation
[2:31:10.040 --> 2:31:12.200]  could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:31:12.200 --> 2:31:14.280]  Number two, our new energy czar
[2:31:14.280 --> 2:31:16.840]  wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:31:16.840 --> 2:31:17.920]  allows you to have.
[2:31:17.920 --> 2:31:20.800]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[2:31:20.800 --> 2:31:23.560]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:31:23.560 --> 2:31:25.800]  Number three, in some areas of the country,
[2:31:25.800 --> 2:31:27.960]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:31:27.960 --> 2:31:30.240]  And now, new socialist legislation
[2:31:30.240 --> 2:31:31.880]  is only compounding the problem.
[2:31:31.880 --> 2:31:34.040]  Number four, dangerous weather is always
[2:31:34.040 --> 2:31:35.440]  a threat to local grids.
[2:31:35.440 --> 2:31:37.760]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[2:31:37.760 --> 2:31:39.160]  from weather-related onages.
[2:31:39.160 --> 2:31:41.200]  Number five, a solar power generator
[2:31:41.200 --> 2:31:44.120]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:31:44.120 --> 2:31:46.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[2:31:46.200 --> 2:31:47.720]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:31:47.720 --> 2:31:49.120]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[2:31:49.120 --> 2:31:53.320]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:31:53.320 --> 2:31:55.080]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:31:55.080 --> 2:31:57.320]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
[2:31:57.320 --> 2:32:02.320]  so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[2:32:03.880 --> 2:32:06.840]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:32:06.840 --> 2:32:08.400]  If you're going into a battle
[2:32:08.400 --> 2:32:10.440]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[2:32:10.440 --> 2:32:12.160]  how much ammunition do you want?
[2:32:12.160 --> 2:32:14.240]  My answer would be all I can get.
[2:32:14.240 --> 2:32:17.400]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[2:32:17.400 --> 2:32:19.240]  food is your only ammunition.
[2:32:19.240 --> 2:32:20.440]  How much do you want?
[2:32:20.440 --> 2:32:21.480]  When do you want it?
[2:32:21.480 --> 2:32:23.440]  Now or after the battle starts.
[2:32:23.440 --> 2:32:24.520]  When will you need it?
[2:32:24.520 --> 2:32:26.720]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:28.080]  Will there be any food?
[2:32:28.080 --> 2:32:29.560]  Will it make your children sick?
[2:32:29.560 --> 2:32:32.160]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[2:32:32.160 --> 2:32:34.840]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:32:34.840 --> 2:32:36.640]  You wipe out all these problems
[2:32:36.640 --> 2:32:38.360]  if you have a good food supply.
[2:32:38.360 --> 2:32:41.280]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom
[2:32:41.280 --> 2:32:42.200]  and your life.
[2:32:42.200 --> 2:32:43.440]  How much will you need?
[2:32:43.440 --> 2:32:44.360]  We don't know.
[2:32:44.360 --> 2:32:45.400]  How much do you want?
[2:32:45.400 --> 2:32:46.360]  All you can get.
[2:32:46.360 --> 2:32:47.480]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:32:47.480 --> 2:32:50.520]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:32:50.520 --> 2:32:55.520]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web
[2:32:56.200 --> 2:32:58.040]  at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:32:58.040 --> 2:33:02.160]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[2:33:02.160 --> 2:33:07.160]  The Gift of Wisdom
[2:33:07.160 --> 2:33:10.080]  7 Got S into City
[2:33:11.680 --> 2:33:13.440]  Get up, stand up
[2:33:14.720 --> 2:33:16.680]  Stand up for your right
[2:33:17.780 --> 2:33:19.600]  Get up, stand up
[2:33:21.040 --> 2:33:23.000]  Stand up for your right
[2:33:24.200 --> 2:33:26.040]  Get up, stand up
[2:33:27.180 --> 2:33:29.120]  Stand up for your right
[2:33:30.440 --> 2:33:31.920]  Get up, stand up
[2:33:31.920 --> 2:33:40.800]  In the next few days, we'll post all of the details at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[2:33:40.800 --> 2:33:49.800]  Three new contests, $10,000 for the best protest video, and it can be whatever you want.
[2:33:49.800 --> 2:33:55.120]  I think that the topless thing, bare minimum, because the public doesn't fully understand
[2:33:55.120 --> 2:33:56.840]  you are naked being recorded.
[2:33:56.840 --> 2:33:59.960]  I think it's going to devastate them, use their own tools against them because that's
[2:33:59.960 --> 2:34:02.680]  an act that you willfully do instead of them forcing you.
[2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:05.800]  You are taking that like judo and using it against them.
[2:34:05.800 --> 2:34:11.200]  $5,000 for the best poster against airport scanning and whoever puts up the most and
[2:34:11.200 --> 2:34:13.960]  does the best job, okay?
[2:34:13.960 --> 2:34:18.840]  You will win $5,000 and then what was the other one I came up with?
[2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:20.400]  It was another $5,000 for something.
[2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:21.680]  I'll have to go back and listen.
[2:34:21.680 --> 2:34:24.160]  I was spontaneously thinking of that on air.
[2:34:24.160 --> 2:34:29.000]  I said $5,000 for something else.
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:34.600]  That was another form of protest that I said was another $5,000, I'm going to have to go
[2:34:34.600 --> 2:34:35.600]  listen to that.
[2:34:35.600 --> 2:34:36.880]  Did we write notes on that?
[2:34:36.880 --> 2:34:38.520]  My third?
[2:34:38.520 --> 2:34:41.200]  No, no.
[2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:51.720]  There's three contests, $10,000 for the protest, best video, preferably topless, oh, $5,000
[2:34:51.720 --> 2:34:53.200]  for the best political stunt.
[2:34:53.200 --> 2:34:54.200]  That's right.
[2:34:54.200 --> 2:34:55.200]  Good job, dude.
[2:34:55.200 --> 2:35:01.920]  $5,000 for the best political stunt, you know, legal banner hangs, of course, he'll selectively
[2:35:01.920 --> 2:35:10.280]  enforce that, events, stuff on TV, whatever you can do, best stunt that you videotape and
[2:35:10.280 --> 2:35:15.440]  post to YouTube, best legal stunt.
[2:35:15.440 --> 2:35:19.880]  I mean, that could be in your county where it's legal putting on a $5,000 free fireworks
[2:35:19.880 --> 2:35:25.160]  contest and getting people there and handing out to 5,000 people body scanners and telling
[2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:27.720]  them, let's go protest next week.
[2:35:27.720 --> 2:35:31.320]  I don't know what the stunts are.
[2:35:31.320 --> 2:35:36.360]  I mean, let's see what you come up with, that's $20,000 in prize money.
[2:35:36.360 --> 2:35:38.360]  How do I pay for that?
[2:35:38.360 --> 2:35:41.800]  You the listeners, purchase the books and videos from infowars.com and we've slashed
[2:35:41.800 --> 2:35:43.320]  all the prices because of the economy.
[2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:46.480]  My mission is to get the materials out.
[2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:50.400]  When you get Fall of the Republic for 1995, my latest and most powerful film, it's got
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:58.600]  Alan Watt in it, Max Kaiser, it's got Webster Tarbley, it's got Economist in there, of course,
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:04.120]  George Humphrey, it's got Gerald Salente, the list just goes on and on.
[2:36:04.120 --> 2:36:07.800]  Myself in the film, it just, it documents their whole agenda and we're having victories
[2:36:07.800 --> 2:36:08.800]  against them.
[2:36:08.800 --> 2:36:11.640]  They're not invincible because we know their game plan.
[2:36:11.640 --> 2:36:15.200]  Get a free t-shirt of your choice or get a free video.
[2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:20.200]  We have a bunch of special combo deals right now at infowars.com and when you purchase
[2:36:20.200 --> 2:36:23.000]  books and videos, you support what we're doing.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:26.680]  We're not funded by George Soros, we're not funded by the government like all these globalist
[2:36:26.680 --> 2:36:28.120]  right-wing, left-wing groups.
[2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:33.480]  We are patriots standing up and the globalists hate the example we've made of leadership
[2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:34.920]  and strength and honor.
[2:36:34.920 --> 2:36:36.840]  They don't want you to know that you have power.
[2:36:36.840 --> 2:36:38.640]  They don't want you to know you can stand up.
[2:36:38.640 --> 2:36:43.320]  They want to make you hopeless, but we're standing up to show people the power of the
[2:36:43.320 --> 2:36:44.320]  people.
[2:36:44.320 --> 2:36:45.320]  Look what happened in Copenhagen.
[2:36:45.320 --> 2:36:46.320]  That was annihilatable.
[2:36:46.320 --> 2:36:48.120]  Get Alan Watt's take on that.
[2:36:48.120 --> 2:36:51.320]  Go to www.prisonplanet.com to take advantage of the deals, the free videos and t-shirts
[2:36:51.320 --> 2:36:52.320]  or 888-253-3139.
[2:36:52.320 --> 2:37:03.560]  You can also write to me at P.O. Box 1-9-549, Austin, Texas, 787-60, that's P.O. Box 1-9-549,
[2:37:03.560 --> 2:37:09.800]  Austin, Texas, 787-60 and five plus months free right now at prisonplanet.tv until next
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:13.400]  Friday and then that deal is gone until next year, the New Year special, prisonplanet.tv.
[2:37:13.400 --> 2:37:16.440]  Okay, Alan, I'm going to try to shut up now.
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:21.000]  I'm just so wound up about what's happening because I have never let my family, my children
[2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:24.120]  have never flown because I won't have them strip searched or beat up or they're always
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:29.080]  killing people in the TSA and I can't watch them humiliated, taking their shoes off and
[2:37:29.080 --> 2:37:33.720]  being indoctrinated to be slaves for the next phase of being naked body scanned and they
[2:37:33.720 --> 2:37:37.040]  use the instrumentality of a machine like that makes it okay.
[2:37:37.040 --> 2:37:39.800]  Be like instead of a cop shooting you in the head, he had a robot shooting you in the head
[2:37:39.800 --> 2:37:41.520]  so it's okay.
[2:37:41.520 --> 2:37:43.960]  It's men looking at a screen of your naked body and saving it.
[2:37:43.960 --> 2:37:45.120]  It's even worse than a strip search.
[2:37:45.120 --> 2:37:49.440]  It'd be like if they led you in and stripped you and videotaped it and laughed at you.
[2:37:49.440 --> 2:37:50.560]  How do we beat this?
[2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:51.560]  How do we resist it?
[2:37:51.560 --> 2:37:57.520]  How do we not just contribute to the Stockholm syndrome of covering all of this and then
[2:37:57.520 --> 2:37:58.880]  people just get hopeless?
[2:37:58.880 --> 2:38:00.200]  How do we fight back?
[2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:01.200]  How do we defeat these people?
[2:38:01.200 --> 2:38:05.760]  Then I want to get into how worldwide from Germany to New York state, there are resting
[2:38:05.760 --> 2:38:11.040]  homeschooling parents for no reason in big public raids, trumping up fake charges.
[2:38:11.040 --> 2:38:15.040]  I'm going to give the number out to that county coming up folks, people to call later.
[2:38:15.040 --> 2:38:18.960]  I mean, they are moving on us on every front.
[2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:23.480]  Copenhagen was mainly a defeat, but Gordon Brown said, I don't care if you didn't sign
[2:38:23.480 --> 2:38:25.400]  on, we're still going to implement it.
[2:38:25.400 --> 2:38:26.400]  Alan, what?
[2:38:26.400 --> 2:38:27.400]  Yes.
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:32.360]  Again, people have to realize that they're not a nobody.
[2:38:32.360 --> 2:38:36.640]  No one is a nobody and that's been the technique that's been used for so long is to make us
[2:38:36.640 --> 2:38:42.760]  all think we're nobodies and that special people that come out of special rooms are
[2:38:42.760 --> 2:38:46.800]  up there to guide you and to manage your life for you.
[2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:51.240]  We have been taught since the 60s onwards to be children, perpetual children, don't
[2:38:51.240 --> 2:38:55.920]  get involved in politics, ignore it, just have a good time and play.
[2:38:55.920 --> 2:39:00.280]  And now it's all called coming home because you have people now who are at that stage
[2:39:00.280 --> 2:39:02.640]  of mencerity but have never matured.
[2:39:02.640 --> 2:39:05.080]  A lot of people out there have never matured.
[2:39:05.080 --> 2:39:09.880]  They're living now as they did when they were 18 years of age, even if they're 40.
[2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:15.840]  So we're aiming at the people who could still think, who still have a sense of self-respect
[2:39:15.840 --> 2:39:22.200]  and know how to give it back to people who have lost it along the way, their own self-respect.
[2:39:22.200 --> 2:39:25.760]  Government exists by the will of the people.
[2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:29.680]  Government is only an idea, that's all it is.
[2:39:29.680 --> 2:39:33.560]  And it only gets away with it's like money, if you have faith that that money works and
[2:39:33.560 --> 2:39:36.600]  someone will accept it then things will work.
[2:39:36.600 --> 2:39:39.960]  If you have faith in the government it will work.
[2:39:39.960 --> 2:39:44.520]  But if you give complete faith to the government it will work in its own way and not for your
[2:39:44.520 --> 2:39:45.520]  benefit.
[2:39:45.520 --> 2:39:50.040]  However, it still only exists because you allow it to exist.
[2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:52.520]  And that's got to get pushed home to these boys at the top.
[2:39:52.520 --> 2:39:53.520]  They know this too.
[2:39:53.520 --> 2:39:58.920]  They're preparing for all kinds of possible scenarios, they've thought through the whole
[2:39:58.920 --> 2:40:05.320]  next 50 years agenda and they're preparing for all possible outcomes but what they don't
[2:40:05.320 --> 2:40:13.560]  want is a passive yet such aggressive push and mass demonstrations for people to take
[2:40:13.560 --> 2:40:17.800]  back their rights and to put the government back in its place.
[2:40:17.800 --> 2:40:22.600]  And every government in the world has got to start putting down on its books the recall
[2:40:22.600 --> 2:40:26.680]  of people who do not fulfill their promises in elections.
[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:30.680]  When they go off in some strange tangent as soon as they're in office they should be
[2:40:30.680 --> 2:40:32.280]  out the door immediately.
[2:40:32.280 --> 2:40:37.240]  Instead of in England the left and right and the US the left and right most people are
[2:40:37.240 --> 2:40:41.320]  still caught up, they hate the party that's in power, they vote for the party out of power
[2:40:41.320 --> 2:40:44.920]  then they hate that party, they vote for the next party, it's all staged.
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:48.760]  We have to have a paradigm shift and stop looking at the low level puppets and see the
[2:40:48.760 --> 2:40:50.400]  real architecture of enslavement.
[2:40:50.400 --> 2:40:58.680]  Yes, and we've got to get the big foundations and the CFR and the role of the international
[2:40:58.680 --> 2:41:05.040]  affairs out, totally out of politics, in fact they should be outlawed and honest with you
[2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:09.520]  because they've been behind the last hundred years of guiding this whole world and every
[2:41:09.520 --> 2:41:18.480]  country in it into this mandated global society of a socialist type formula with its eugenics
[2:41:18.480 --> 2:41:23.920]  agenda with its takedown of populations to a manageable level as they call it.
[2:41:23.920 --> 2:41:28.640]  These guys have no place in politics, we don't vote them in and yet here they are with all
[2:41:28.640 --> 2:41:36.480]  their members inside the political bureau's establishment, they've got to be outlawed completely.
[2:41:36.480 --> 2:41:40.240]  And they are parasites and they love the fact that they're in the process of disarming us
[2:41:40.240 --> 2:41:42.160]  as is happening in Canada right now.
[2:41:42.160 --> 2:41:46.920]  Alan, you talk a lot about how they, and this is in their own documents, again Charlotte
[2:41:46.920 --> 2:41:52.480]  Isaby's books full of the documents, about how they're turning man against woman, woman
[2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:57.520]  against man, black against white, Muslim against Jew, Catholic against Protestant, northerner
[2:41:57.520 --> 2:41:59.240]  against southerner.
[2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:03.560]  Always balkanizing everyone, here's an article, and give me a document Cam Schafer, prison
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:08.560]  planet dot tv viewers, France to criminalize shouting at your wife, married couples could
[2:42:08.560 --> 2:42:13.760]  be arrested and charged for insulting each other under a new law in France banning psychological
[2:42:13.760 --> 2:42:14.960]  violence.
[2:42:14.960 --> 2:42:18.120]  And in the US they're starting to take people's kids if they're seen yelling at them even
[2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:20.560]  if it isn't against the law.
[2:42:20.560 --> 2:42:25.560]  And then it says right here that it's going to be implemented with a ticket the first
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:31.200]  time and then jail time and then huge fines and it says that they're encouraging men and
[2:42:31.200 --> 2:42:35.320]  women to tattle on each other and women are being taught your husband's arguing with you
[2:42:35.320 --> 2:42:41.800]  call the police and so again they are literally moving forward with this agenda.
[2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:46.200]  I wanted to read one part police are being urged to issue a caution in the first instance
[2:42:46.200 --> 2:42:51.960]  of a reported crime of raising their voice but repeated offenses could face a fine or
[2:42:51.960 --> 2:42:53.920]  electronic tagging or jail.
[2:42:53.920 --> 2:42:58.920]  All these petty things that aren't even crimes, everybody's got to be tagged.
[2:42:58.920 --> 2:43:06.400]  Yeah, well I tell you people have to stop being politically correct, this is all training
[2:43:06.400 --> 2:43:09.920]  people to be politically correct and to keep updating it off because they know where they're
[2:43:09.920 --> 2:43:16.680]  going with it all into a robotic society but it's also to make sure that you cannot live
[2:43:16.680 --> 2:43:22.640]  outside the government control, in other words if you're going to have an argument you must
[2:43:22.640 --> 2:43:25.720]  have a professional counsellor there to have it, otherwise-
[2:43:25.720 --> 2:43:30.200]  Well now they're saying out of 60 million or 50 million French, whatever it is, pull
[2:43:30.200 --> 2:43:35.280]  up the population number of France, they're saying 157 French women and men and women
[2:43:35.280 --> 2:43:41.520]  killed each other in 2008 and we can't allow that, like one underwear bomber, all our rights
[2:43:41.520 --> 2:43:46.360]  leave they naked scan us and now we may have to ban marriage and make everybody live in
[2:43:46.360 --> 2:43:51.120]  dormitories because every once in a while people kill each other and oh my gosh sometimes
[2:43:51.120 --> 2:43:57.120]  parents abuse babies, so 20,000 homes in England, now at birth cameras go in your home until
[2:43:57.120 --> 2:44:02.680]  the kids leave when they're 18 and the government watches you, see oh well my god sometimes
[2:44:02.680 --> 2:44:07.000]  people fight so we've just got to ban this institution, they're actually talking about
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  it.
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:14.200]  It was back in the 1960s at the American Psychological Association's own magazine, they said that
[2:44:14.200 --> 2:44:20.280]  in the 60s eventually they'll put cameras in every citizen's homes and it will pick
[2:44:20.280 --> 2:44:27.520]  up any signs of aggression such as your mouth going down, eyes narrowing and they will have
[2:44:27.520 --> 2:44:31.600]  intervention teams that will come in straight away before anything happens.
[2:44:31.600 --> 2:44:36.960]  Now we're going to understand, we're simply following through a script here, it's an intergenerational
[2:44:36.960 --> 2:44:43.040]  script, it's updated for each generation and it's not happening by the moment, it happens
[2:44:43.040 --> 2:44:48.640]  to some strange new idea that came out of parliament or congress, it was implemented
[2:44:48.640 --> 2:44:54.120]  and written in the UN various constitutions 40, 50, 60 years ago.
[2:44:54.120 --> 2:44:59.000]  And now they're announcing their world government, by the way France has 61.5 million people
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:04.480]  and now Ellen, why are they now coming right out and saying Von Rumpi the head of the EU,
[2:45:04.480 --> 2:45:09.960]  Gore, Gordon Brown, they're all saying global governance is here, they announced at the conference,
[2:45:09.960 --> 2:45:15.720]  yes we want it to be a global one-child policy, yes we want to shut down the money so you
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:24.080]  can't afford to have children and then we'll CPS them if you're poor and yes, this is really
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:29.520]  all about population reduction and now Austin has announced the city, yes we don't want
[2:45:29.520 --> 2:45:34.480]  to build new roads, we're going to force you to take buses, we are your social engineers,
[2:45:34.480 --> 2:45:36.000]  we own your butt.
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:43.800]  Yeah, again a very old agenda, written about years ago of how they would do this and how
[2:45:43.800 --> 2:45:50.640]  they would implement it by stages as they gradually altered the perceptions of each generation.
[2:45:50.640 --> 2:45:54.960]  So why are they now announcing it, why are they getting so bold, why is everything moving
[2:45:54.960 --> 2:45:55.960]  ten times faster?
[2:45:55.960 --> 2:46:00.960]  They really believe now, it's time, they believe now it's time, a long time ago they
[2:46:00.960 --> 2:46:06.760]  said that 2012 was when the UN would come up to its full power and be accepted by the
[2:46:06.760 --> 2:46:12.920]  world, they think it's now ready to be accepted by the various populaces of the world and
[2:46:12.920 --> 2:46:18.760]  they're almost right, most countries will go along because it's so beaten down by everything,
[2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:22.440]  they probably will just go along with it, in fact they'll think what can we do, we haven't
[2:46:22.440 --> 2:46:29.840]  protested anything for years, most countries have not protested anything for years so they've
[2:46:29.840 --> 2:46:35.560]  been trained to comply and comply and comply so at the top they do believe they're ready
[2:46:35.560 --> 2:46:37.640]  to accept global governance.
[2:46:37.640 --> 2:46:42.880]  You're right and Alan now suddenly as you know on CNN Fox they're going, the Japanese
[2:46:42.880 --> 2:46:46.520]  are looking at putting lithium in the water and antipsychotic and the lady on the show
[2:46:46.520 --> 2:46:51.760]  says, I think it's a good idea and suddenly they're going, yeah we are going to put statins
[2:46:51.760 --> 2:46:56.480]  in the water in Prozac and yeah Prozac is in water supplies that don't have runoff that
[2:46:56.480 --> 2:47:01.440]  it shouldn't be, yes it's going to make you feel better, they're just, they're just titrating
[2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:04.880]  the does for those that don't know to get used to say cobra bites, they give people
[2:47:04.880 --> 2:47:09.000]  small amounts of the venom and build it up and I believe that's why they let Ventura
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:12.840]  have the TV show, he means well, I mean well but they believe it's now time to throw it
[2:47:12.840 --> 2:47:15.920]  in your face, that's why they're not too worried about me because they believe it's
[2:47:15.920 --> 2:47:19.760]  now time to throw it in your face, I just want to ask the controllers and the bureaucrats
[2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:23.680]  that get petty power out of this who are compartmentalized, do you like giving your
[2:47:23.680 --> 2:47:29.840]  kids tap water in some cases over 300 deadly chemicals but on average 150 plus, do you
[2:47:29.840 --> 2:47:33.680]  like the fact that your boys are effeminate and a lot of them don't even have a sperm
[2:47:33.680 --> 2:47:37.200]  count by the time they're 20, do you like the fact that everybody's dying of cancer,
[2:47:37.200 --> 2:47:41.280]  I mean do you really like this but see it's a psychological trick, they get off on the
[2:47:41.280 --> 2:47:44.600]  fact that they feel like they're part of it.
[2:47:44.600 --> 2:47:50.320]  And also most people are going to denial, they cannot believe that the masters above
[2:47:50.320 --> 2:47:56.840]  them would be so bad as to actually do this deliberately, in fact the masters count on
[2:47:56.840 --> 2:48:02.000]  the public saying well they're always screwing up, it's got to be a mistake, they wouldn't
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  have meant to do that and of course it did mean to do that because Julian Huxley said
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  in the 1950s and he was the first CEO of UNESCO, he said we should use all kinds of
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:20.600]  pharma in drinking water, food and inoculations to create a compliant, pliable population.
[2:48:20.600 --> 2:48:28.120]  And in Endgame 1.5 we have Dr. Michael Kaufman reading from official Pentagon sanctioned studies
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:32.880]  of what they would do by the year 2000 from the 60s and these are major universities saying
[2:48:32.880 --> 2:48:37.440]  we will hype the sports up for everybody, we will start drugging everyone with a soma
[2:48:37.440 --> 2:48:43.240]  type drugs we're developing, they said we will then start breaking up the families and
[2:48:43.240 --> 2:48:47.920]  everyone will be literally like child like people who and then we can start reducing
[2:48:47.920 --> 2:48:51.880]  their numbers, so they're just getting everyone ready to where oh yeah everybody on the block
[2:48:51.880 --> 2:48:56.280]  is dying of cancer, well I guess I'm dying, I love the government and the newscasters
[2:48:56.280 --> 2:49:01.600]  are cold is coming tomorrow, be sure and wear your mittens and your hat and you may
[2:49:01.600 --> 2:49:06.360]  and they talk to you, I heard it on the news this morning like you're a baby and the average
[2:49:06.360 --> 2:49:11.840]  person kind of, oh I like the government and everybody kind of ninnies and is real soft
[2:49:11.840 --> 2:49:16.760]  and loves taddling and loves, oh I got cancer, oh good I love the government, I mean it's
[2:49:16.760 --> 2:49:24.120]  just so sick, it's so sick and it's all planned this way and implemented by a scientific
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:25.120]  means.
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:30.120]  Oh Ellen, what do we do man, I mean I am never going to be able to take my kids on a flight
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:33.120]  which is what they want, they want us to stop traveling but I can't let them naked body
[2:49:33.120 --> 2:49:34.120]  scan my children.
[2:49:34.120 --> 2:49:35.720]  Well they even want to do it coming in.
[2:49:35.720 --> 2:49:38.320]  Now they say they're going to have checkpoints on the highways, you won't be able to run
[2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:40.320]  from it, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:46.840]  Yeah that's right, they're talking and the major crossovers of the Canadian borders so
[2:49:46.840 --> 2:49:50.280]  you can't even drive across now without going through the humiliating experience.
[2:49:50.280 --> 2:49:55.480]  They interrogate my people, they make them have proof of the cameras they have with purchases,
[2:49:55.480 --> 2:50:00.480]  proof, they harass everyone, they take your laptops, I mean it's just, it's unbelievable.
[2:50:00.480 --> 2:50:07.000]  Yeah, this is what totalitarian society happens to be, we're in it, see people could realize
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:12.200]  we're in a totalitarian society, didn't happen by chance, it was planned a long time ago,
[2:50:12.200 --> 2:50:13.200]  implemented.
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:16.320]  Well the total proof of that is their own documents but look how it's the same system
[2:50:16.320 --> 2:50:21.360]  worldwide run by the same companies and what they did though is they were smart here, they
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:24.000]  built the grid and now they're launching it.
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:27.680]  They lined up all their cannons and weapons aimed at us, got us ready and then just started
[2:50:27.680 --> 2:50:32.400]  blasting, what about a year ago?
[2:50:32.400 --> 2:50:36.360]  And it's just coming down so quickly now and we've got to get to the youngsters, they're
[2:50:36.360 --> 2:50:41.120]  getting in the bulk of the scientific indoctrination, they're going to grow up accepting it, they
[2:50:41.120 --> 2:50:45.360]  already trained them first going through their school standards to make sure they're getting
[2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:49.200]  used to the idea and I said years ago this is ongoing for life, they're getting trained
[2:50:49.200 --> 2:50:52.200]  for their livelihoods.
[2:50:52.200 --> 2:50:56.240]  And that brings me to the next thing, by the time I left high school they would bring you
[2:50:56.240 --> 2:51:00.240]  in under a federal program and have you answer all these psychological questions so the feds
[2:51:00.240 --> 2:51:04.560]  could decide what type of worker be you should be, stay there.
[2:51:04.560 --> 2:51:10.160]  Airandaqua.com is your one stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification
[2:51:10.160 --> 2:51:12.400]  systems available on the market today.

[2:52:06.160 --> 2:52:09.880]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:52:09.880 --> 2:52:13.040]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:52:13.040 --> 2:52:17.400]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[2:52:17.400 --> 2:52:18.400]  at home.
[2:52:18.400 --> 2:52:23.560]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[2:52:23.560 --> 2:52:24.560]  shots.
[2:52:24.560 --> 2:52:29.440]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:29.440 --> 2:52:35.120]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[2:52:35.120 --> 2:52:39.520]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:52:39.520 --> 2:52:51.920]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[2:52:51.920 --> 2:52:53.240]  of the Republic.
[2:52:53.240 --> 2:52:59.320]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, or watch it online right

[2:53:04.280 --> 2:53:08.840]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare
[2:53:08.840 --> 2:53:13.040]  with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[2:53:13.040 --> 2:53:18.480]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S. and
[2:53:18.480 --> 2:53:19.480]  Canada.
[2:53:19.480 --> 2:53:24.480]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified
[2:53:24.480 --> 2:53:26.120]  THC-free.
[2:53:26.120 --> 2:53:29.680]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[2:53:29.680 --> 2:53:32.040]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[2:54:02.920 --> 2:54:07.520]  What do you think of this, the parents of four Montgomery County children under arrest
[2:54:07.520 --> 2:54:11.680]  for failing to register their home school to children with the school district seven
[2:54:11.680 --> 2:54:12.800]  years ago?
[2:54:12.800 --> 2:54:13.800]  How is this allowed to happen?
[2:54:13.800 --> 2:54:14.800]  Who should be held accountable?
[2:54:14.800 --> 2:54:19.080]  Fact funder, Marsha Natal, went and got some answers.
[2:54:19.080 --> 2:54:22.040]  Is it fair to say that these four children fell through the cracks?
[2:54:22.040 --> 2:54:26.280]  Well, from what I can gather, it sounds like there was education going on, so I don't know
[2:54:26.280 --> 2:54:28.120]  if they really slipped through the cracks.
[2:54:28.120 --> 2:54:32.240]  They didn't fulfill their legal responsibilities to file with the school district to be home
[2:54:32.240 --> 2:54:33.240]  schooled.
[2:54:33.240 --> 2:54:36.440]  And then they go to the police and talk about how horrible the parents are and how, why
[2:54:36.440 --> 2:54:40.840]  don't we have home inspections of all homes, and it's not even illegal to not register
[2:54:40.840 --> 2:54:41.840]  your kids.
[2:54:41.840 --> 2:54:42.840]  It's illegalese.
[2:54:42.840 --> 2:54:47.240]  They use the CPS to swear out that they believed it was child endangerment, meaning you have
[2:54:47.240 --> 2:54:50.160]  a kid playing with dynamite or something, which they didn't.
[2:54:50.160 --> 2:54:54.400]  So they come and arrest them for a big event, and the media is like, more needs to be done.
[2:54:54.400 --> 2:54:59.600]  You have this Soviet outrage of grabbing the kids and arresting the parents and showing
[2:54:59.600 --> 2:55:04.560]  their mug shots on TV, and then the message from the media is that's not enough.
[2:55:04.560 --> 2:55:10.840]  Remember, the media is so evil now that nationwide, they tell you mercury is good for your brain.
[2:55:10.840 --> 2:55:16.800]  I've played that clip probably 150 times, but go to YouTube type news says mercury is
[2:55:16.800 --> 2:55:17.800]  good for brain.
[2:55:17.800 --> 2:55:18.800]  We'll play it again.
[2:55:18.800 --> 2:55:19.800]  It's only 10 seconds.
[2:55:19.800 --> 2:55:24.120]  I mean, Alan, they are practicing insanity and craziness, and we're going to naked body
[2:55:24.120 --> 2:55:27.600]  scan you, and we're going to do this and that to just break our will.
[2:55:27.600 --> 2:55:32.080]  Or is it that people have been raised now with really no will or no mooring?
[2:55:32.080 --> 2:55:34.400]  And so whatever they're told is good.
[2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:36.200]  You're right, there's no mooring.
[2:55:36.200 --> 2:55:39.480]  You see, there's no cultural mooring anymore.
[2:55:39.480 --> 2:55:44.600]  That's why the first big attacks were to destroy all religions that give you self-respect.
[2:55:44.600 --> 2:55:46.600]  They've destroyed that.
[2:55:46.600 --> 2:55:50.880]  They've been very successful, but then told to play during the 70s, the 60s, and 70s.
[2:55:50.880 --> 2:55:52.880]  Just play the eternal children forever.
[2:55:52.880 --> 2:55:56.320]  Don't worry about the big problems, just go out and have fun.
[2:55:56.320 --> 2:55:58.920]  And of course, now we've been trained that we were prepared.
[2:55:58.920 --> 2:56:05.160]  We believe we're prepared for children who are adults today think of themselves in a
[2:56:05.160 --> 2:56:06.160]  childish mentality.
[2:56:06.160 --> 2:56:07.800]  Well, it's an illusion, Alan.
[2:56:07.800 --> 2:56:08.960]  People drive around in their cars.
[2:56:08.960 --> 2:56:09.960]  They pay their taxes.
[2:56:09.960 --> 2:56:10.960]  They question nothing.
[2:56:10.960 --> 2:56:15.440]  They think the world is a wonderland, and they're just passively going, and every time
[2:56:15.440 --> 2:56:19.360]  the cops arrest somebody for no reason or take their kids or kill somebody, the victims
[2:56:19.360 --> 2:56:21.160]  make excuses for them.
[2:56:21.160 --> 2:56:22.160]  That's right.
[2:56:22.160 --> 2:56:27.880]  And I do know that through all their studies over the last 100 years, 87% of the public
[2:56:27.880 --> 2:56:31.200]  will always believe what they're told by the major media.
[2:56:31.200 --> 2:56:35.920]  They can't hold more than two major crises in their head at the same time.
[2:56:35.920 --> 2:56:40.400]  And that way, when they get them a new crisis, they delete the last one.
[2:56:40.400 --> 2:56:44.880]  They forget even had the last one a month ago, or first is the bank crash, next is
[2:56:44.880 --> 2:56:45.880]  the bailout.
[2:56:45.880 --> 2:56:47.720]  Now the economy is down the tube.
[2:56:47.720 --> 2:56:48.720]  Now it's the flu.
[2:56:48.720 --> 2:56:53.360]  And then now they're about to pass government-controlled health care, but we're all talking about
[2:56:53.360 --> 2:56:55.360]  body scanners.
[2:56:55.360 --> 2:56:56.360]  Yes.
[2:56:56.360 --> 2:56:57.360]  And so that's how it works.
[2:56:57.360 --> 2:57:01.880]  87% of the public can only hold two major things in their head at once, and when the
[2:57:01.880 --> 2:57:06.040]  third one comes along, they delete the last one and forget it even happened.
[2:57:06.040 --> 2:57:07.640]  So this way, you can keep them going from crisis to crisis.
[2:57:07.640 --> 2:57:10.560]  And I want police and military from crisis to crisis.
[2:57:10.560 --> 2:57:14.200]  When you're being brainwashed, now that you've learned these techniques, notice your commanders
[2:57:14.200 --> 2:57:15.200]  are doing it.
[2:57:15.200 --> 2:57:19.560]  They're taught this stuff, and they think it's neat to be able to shutter minds and
[2:57:19.560 --> 2:57:20.560]  control people.
[2:57:20.560 --> 2:57:21.560]  Yes.
[2:57:21.560 --> 2:57:22.560]  Absolutely.
[2:57:22.560 --> 2:57:23.560]  Absolutely.
[2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:29.760]  So people really have lost the sense of dignity and self-respect and definitely a common culture.
[2:57:29.760 --> 2:57:35.120]  That was part of the big, massive communist move for multiculturalism.
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:40.760]  It wasn't be nice to other cultures, it was to help you destroy your own cohesive majority.
[2:57:40.760 --> 2:57:45.680]  Get rid of all other cultures and replace it with the corporate Borg, Prozac culture.
[2:57:45.680 --> 2:57:46.680]  That's correct.
[2:57:46.680 --> 2:57:50.760]  And so when you have nothing, the men tend to stand up for their culture, they stand
[2:57:50.760 --> 2:57:52.440]  up for their family.
[2:57:52.440 --> 2:57:56.360]  When you destroy the culture, the traditions, and their family, there's nothing left to
[2:57:56.360 --> 2:57:57.360]  stand up for.
[2:57:57.360 --> 2:57:58.840]  They won't fight for anything.
[2:57:58.840 --> 2:58:03.200]  The culture now is men making jokes about sex and acting tough.
[2:58:03.200 --> 2:58:06.880]  And watching sports and guzzling beer.
[2:58:06.880 --> 2:58:13.960]  Well, Alan, I am so alive, I burn with passion and life and love of liberty and decency and
[2:58:13.960 --> 2:58:14.960]  honor.
[2:58:14.960 --> 2:58:19.920]  And Madison Avenue first teaches you, as you said, to feel inadequate, to feel pathetic,
[2:58:19.920 --> 2:58:23.800]  so then the system can say, this is what makes you adequate, and that's all the slavery
[2:58:23.800 --> 2:58:24.800]  and weakness.
[2:58:24.800 --> 2:58:28.640]  But then the men feel even weaker, so they dive into weakness even more and are never
[2:58:28.640 --> 2:58:30.200]  quenched.
[2:58:30.200 --> 2:58:35.640]  And I just wish people knew the burning, animating fire of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked
[2:58:35.640 --> 2:58:36.640]  about.
[2:58:36.640 --> 2:58:40.480]  They could feel it, blowing in them and through them.
[2:58:40.480 --> 2:58:43.320]  I just want that spirit to rise.
[2:58:43.320 --> 2:58:50.040]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[2:58:50.040 --> 2:58:53.800]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[2:58:53.800 --> 2:58:57.720]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[2:58:57.720 --> 2:59:00.640]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[2:59:00.640 --> 2:59:02.720]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[2:59:02.720 --> 2:59:06.920]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.

[2:59:56.920 --> 3:00:18.440]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[3:00:18.440 --> 3:00:21.200]  Alan, I've analyzed Copenhagen in depth.
[3:00:21.200 --> 3:00:27.560]  It was a 95% failure that we forced Gordon Brown, the real ringleader of this, out of
[3:00:27.560 --> 3:00:32.520]  the current head of the circus, to then just come out when it failed.
[3:00:32.520 --> 3:00:35.320]  They couldn't get countries to sign on to the global taxes and controls.
[3:00:35.320 --> 3:00:39.600]  He just said, well, we'll just have the Western world go ahead and start levying the taxes
[3:00:39.600 --> 3:00:42.960]  and giving it to the IMF and World Bank, and we'll go ahead and start monitoring the third
[3:00:42.960 --> 3:00:45.680]  world and cutting off their funds if they don't do it.
[3:00:45.680 --> 3:00:48.880]  So openly showing he's a tyrant.
[3:00:48.880 --> 3:00:50.380]  But I am optimistic.
[3:00:50.380 --> 3:00:52.600]  They are drugging people in the water and food.
[3:00:52.600 --> 3:00:53.720]  They are dumbing people down.
[3:00:53.720 --> 3:00:56.960]  They are playing us off against each other, those of us that are awake.
[3:00:56.960 --> 3:01:01.280]  But I do see them, things are not going as well as they wanted.
[3:01:01.280 --> 3:01:07.280]  Now they readjust, they never give up, but I think humanity has a chance of beating this.
[3:01:07.280 --> 3:01:12.040]  Everything they've done is study us to know how to stop us from ever defeating them.
[3:01:12.040 --> 3:01:14.320]  But I really have some hope, Alan.
[3:01:14.320 --> 3:01:19.320]  There's always hope, and it's a matter of, again, never giving up either.
[3:01:19.320 --> 3:01:22.560]  They never give up, so we must never give up.
[3:01:22.560 --> 3:01:29.320]  And for every day, new folk tune in to the radio shows and listen every day.
[3:01:29.320 --> 3:01:30.920]  And young ones do, too.
[3:01:30.920 --> 3:01:35.800]  And they're the ones who are going to have to take up the brunt and take the cudgel off
[3:01:35.800 --> 3:01:39.680]  eventually down the road to make sure they have the rights back.
[3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:44.600]  We were always starting off the process and keeping the information alive at the moment.
[3:01:44.600 --> 3:01:47.480]  They'd love to kill the information altogether, but they can't.
[3:01:47.480 --> 3:01:48.480]  Not yet.
[3:01:48.480 --> 3:01:52.440]  For those that don't know, isn't a cudgel a Scottish name for a war club?
[3:01:52.440 --> 3:01:53.440]  Yeah.
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:01:54.440]  Okay, I want to make sure.
[3:01:54.440 --> 3:01:55.440]  Pick up the club.
[3:01:55.440 --> 3:02:01.800]  Yeah, that's what I've got to do, because we're dealing with, as you say yourself, the most
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:08.600]  ruthless people at the top that's ever existed who are so cocky with themselves now.
[3:02:08.600 --> 3:02:14.000]  They believe they can do whatever they wish to the general population of an entire planet.
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:17.120]  To the point of, hey, we're drugging your water, and we're going to start testing your
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:18.680]  blood to make sure you're drinking it.
[3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:23.760]  Yes, and we're already drugging most of the young boys out there that can think and have
[3:02:23.760 --> 3:02:24.760]  leadership qualities.
[3:02:24.760 --> 3:02:30.960]  I mean, this is full-scale war, thought out a long time ago, as St. Julian Huxley said,
[3:02:30.960 --> 3:02:36.640]  we'll use pharma to, and so did Bertrand Russell, he said, we shall look for those with leadership
[3:02:36.640 --> 3:02:37.640]  qualities.
[3:02:37.640 --> 3:02:42.960]  And if we can't bring them in through scholarships and through our system, we'll have to eliminate
[3:02:42.960 --> 3:02:43.960]  them.
[3:02:43.960 --> 3:02:49.360]  Because they could allow people who could convey what's happening to the rest of the
[3:02:49.360 --> 3:02:55.680]  people and become leaders to have to drug them or annihilate them.
[3:02:55.680 --> 3:03:00.640]  You know, I look at old photographs and old film footage of just like my grandfathers
[3:03:00.640 --> 3:03:06.200]  and people before them, and their eyes, especially their parents, back in the 40s and 50s, they
[3:03:06.200 --> 3:03:09.720]  were coming out with smaller little real tapes, and we found some and watched them.
[3:03:09.720 --> 3:03:15.080]  And just normal people in photos, I mean, their eyes were just burning with luminance
[3:03:15.080 --> 3:03:20.640]  and intelligence, and people looked so good, even if they were poor or dressed, I mean,
[3:03:20.640 --> 3:03:23.720]  they were, I mean, people just radiated power.
[3:03:23.720 --> 3:03:28.040]  There is no doubt, I mean, they admit the fluoride alone is a deadly toxic chemical that
[3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:32.960]  brain damages, makes you obese, attacks all the glands, but they are drugging us en masse.
[3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:35.360]  Yes, and that was always a big part of it.
[3:03:35.360 --> 3:03:40.520]  The combination of pharma working with the government was written about 60, 70 years
[3:03:40.520 --> 3:03:41.520]  ago.
[3:03:41.520 --> 3:03:43.040]  That was always their goal.
[3:03:43.040 --> 3:03:45.560]  A compliant, obedient population, absolutely.
[3:03:45.560 --> 3:03:49.960]  I remember that movie, THX 700, they called it.
[3:03:49.960 --> 3:03:56.120]  THX 1138, which is a, which is a fantastic, that's what they're actually planning.
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:04:01.880]  That's by George Lucas, his thesis film, where Robert Duvall based, for those that don't
[3:04:01.880 --> 3:04:08.000]  know, based on Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, which is actually the plan.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:09.640]  It is the plan.
[3:04:09.640 --> 3:04:14.600]  It absolutely is the plan, because Aldous Huxley was in on the big think tank meetings with
[3:04:14.600 --> 3:04:19.320]  his brother, Julian Huxley, both descended from the Darwin clan, by the way.
[3:04:19.320 --> 3:04:23.240]  Oh, he gave his last speech before they probably killed him in 62.
[3:04:23.240 --> 3:04:26.160]  He just laid it all out at Berkeley, so this is all the plan.
[3:04:26.160 --> 3:04:27.160]  This is real.
[3:04:27.160 --> 3:04:30.880]  And he said, because we're so smart, you listening in the audience won't even be able
[3:04:30.880 --> 3:04:31.880]  to stop him.
[3:04:31.880 --> 3:04:32.880]  That's right.
[3:04:32.880 --> 3:04:38.440]  And it's just a small group of men, very powerful, rich, powerful men, with the use of pharmacology
[3:04:38.440 --> 3:04:43.760]  and a good plan could literally take over and rule the entire planet to the satisfaction.
[3:04:43.760 --> 3:04:48.440]  Why do you think over 30% of police officers admit that they're on steroids?
[3:04:48.440 --> 3:04:51.760]  They actually need it because they've been gilded.
[3:04:51.760 --> 3:04:56.640]  I want the police who serve this to know you were being chemically attacked, chemically
[3:04:56.640 --> 3:04:57.760]  lobotomized.
[3:04:57.760 --> 3:05:01.960]  Why do you serve the New World Order because you're drugged right now and under a trance
[3:05:01.960 --> 3:05:03.760]  from television?
[3:05:03.760 --> 3:05:08.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:05:08.400 --> 3:05:12.720]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:05:12.720 --> 3:05:17.040]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:05:17.040 --> 3:05:18.360]  allows you to have.
[3:05:18.360 --> 3:05:19.360]  It's true.
[3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:24.080]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:05:24.080 --> 3:05:28.440]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[3:05:28.440 --> 3:05:32.440]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:05:32.440 --> 3:05:35.920]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[3:05:35.920 --> 3:05:39.640]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[3:05:39.640 --> 3:05:44.440]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:05:44.440 --> 3:05:48.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:05:48.200 --> 3:05:49.560]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[3:05:49.560 --> 3:05:53.800]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[3:05:53.800 --> 3:06:03.800]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[3:06:03.800 --> 3:06:10.080]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:06:10.080 --> 3:06:13.200]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:06:13.200 --> 3:06:17.560]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:06:17.560 --> 3:06:18.560]  at home.
[3:06:18.560 --> 3:06:22.600]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress.
[3:06:22.600 --> 3:06:24.320]  And they really are calling the shots.
[3:06:24.320 --> 3:06:29.480]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:06:29.480 --> 3:06:32.880]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[3:06:32.880 --> 3:06:38.720]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes, constructing
[3:06:38.720 --> 3:06:39.720]  world government.
[3:06:39.720 --> 3:06:44.080]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and the arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[3:06:44.080 --> 3:06:46.080]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:06:46.080 --> 3:06:48.040]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[3:06:48.040 --> 3:06:53.480]  And right now, in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[3:06:53.480 --> 3:06:57.920]  Yet your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[3:06:57.920 --> 3:07:03.120]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:07:03.120 --> 3:07:06.240]  Hi everyone, Andy Anderson here.
[3:07:06.240 --> 3:07:10.680]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[3:07:10.680 --> 3:07:14.680]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts,
[3:07:14.680 --> 3:07:16.480]  and handrails we touch every day.
[3:07:16.480 --> 3:07:20.760]  But you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness.
[3:07:20.760 --> 3:07:22.720]  No more protection till you use it again.
[3:07:22.720 --> 3:07:23.920]  Pure works to the rescue.
[3:07:23.920 --> 3:07:28.440]  Our FDA compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[3:07:28.440 --> 3:07:30.680]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[3:07:30.680 --> 3:07:36.960]  Pure works disinfecting spray is EPA certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis
[3:07:36.960 --> 3:07:41.680]  B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kill C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses
[3:07:41.680 --> 3:07:45.320]  and bacteria, moles and fungus too, so even safe around pets and children.
[3:07:45.320 --> 3:07:48.480]  You'll love how your skin fills with pure works, soft and supple.
[3:07:48.480 --> 3:07:49.480]  No more dry skin.
[3:07:49.480 --> 3:07:54.360]  Here's to a little piece of mind knowing that your hands are still germ free hours later.
[3:07:54.360 --> 3:08:00.520]  Call now toll free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on pure works and get pure works on
[3:08:00.520 --> 3:08:01.520]  your hands.
[3:08:01.520 --> 3:08:09.160]  That's 888-245-030.
[3:08:09.160 --> 3:08:35.640]  Alright, I said I'd take calls today when Alan Watt was on with us and we're gonna open
[3:08:35.640 --> 3:08:41.080]  the phones up here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:46.320]  Dustin and P.A., Justin and Montana, Mark and Maui, I wish I was there, but I can't
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:47.320]  ever fly there.
[3:08:47.320 --> 3:08:48.320]  I'm not gonna be naked body scanned.
[3:08:48.320 --> 3:08:51.720]  No, I'm gonna still fly, but I'm not gonna let them scan me.
[3:08:51.720 --> 3:08:54.840]  Ken and Mass and others, what do you think you're doing?
[3:08:54.840 --> 3:08:57.960]  Because you're giving authority in a 10 badge, you're gonna put me in a naked body scanner.
[3:08:57.960 --> 3:09:01.760]  They wouldn't even scan Iraqis with.
[3:09:01.760 --> 3:09:04.120]  And I was talking to Man Cal Muller on this indicated show.
[3:09:04.120 --> 3:09:08.720]  They tried to do a bunch of stuff to him.
[3:09:08.720 --> 3:09:13.760]  The TSA guy marched up and started going, with his wife and children and he said, talk
[3:09:13.760 --> 3:09:14.760]  to me.
[3:09:14.760 --> 3:09:17.280]  The guy said, and he said, talk to me.
[3:09:17.280 --> 3:09:19.120]  And the guy said, that's it, you're missing your flight.
[3:09:19.120 --> 3:09:24.080]  I want you to put that book, he had Atlas shrugged in his hand on the scanner through
[3:09:24.080 --> 3:09:25.080]  the thing.
[3:09:25.080 --> 3:09:27.360]  And he said, put him in the box, put him in there and they were like, you're missing
[3:09:27.360 --> 3:09:28.360]  your flight.
[3:09:28.360 --> 3:09:31.400]  So he started yelling, this is a police state, this is wrong, this is a fraud.
[3:09:31.400 --> 3:09:32.800]  And they said, get out of here, get out of here.
[3:09:32.800 --> 3:09:36.760]  They didn't want to scare the other slaves, they want to see you dominated, but not see
[3:09:36.760 --> 3:09:37.760]  you stand up.
[3:09:37.760 --> 3:09:38.760]  Alan, what?
[3:09:38.760 --> 3:09:41.000]  Oh, that's absolutely true.
[3:09:41.000 --> 3:09:47.400]  The last thing you want is to make a coherent, accurate statement and shouting out to the
[3:09:47.400 --> 3:09:50.200]  rest of the public was actually happening.
[3:09:50.200 --> 3:09:55.320]  You've got to shout out sometimes and break the spell and tell them what is actually happening
[3:09:55.320 --> 3:09:59.960]  here and make them indignant and afraid.
[3:09:59.960 --> 3:10:06.760]  I've also noticed, I want your comment on this at Disneyland or at all the other major
[3:10:06.760 --> 3:10:13.280]  theme parks, things like SeaWorld, you pay for your ticket and then you walk up and they
[3:10:13.280 --> 3:10:17.360]  go, oh, you have to hand print with that ticket you bought and then I refuse and they let
[3:10:17.360 --> 3:10:20.080]  me through as soon as I start yelling.
[3:10:20.080 --> 3:10:22.320]  And everyone else, it's the same thing at the airport.
[3:10:22.320 --> 3:10:26.920]  You buy your ticket, you go through and they go body scanner, put your kids in there.
[3:10:26.920 --> 3:10:30.600]  And all these photos on the news, we were showing them yesterday, when they put these
[3:10:30.600 --> 3:10:34.440]  women in the scanners, it shows the guys smiling, looking at their naked bodies.
[3:10:34.440 --> 3:10:36.560]  Of course, yeah.
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:39.000]  Because that humiliation is important.
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  Yes.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:41.000]  Absolutely.
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:46.000]  And there's no doubt about it, they already see themselves, they can't keep anything secret
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:47.000]  that's on the net.
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:51.680]  If you've had so many scandals in Britain with social security numbers being sold by
[3:10:51.680 --> 3:10:56.800]  the millions from the government to private companies, you can believe me, they're going
[3:10:56.800 --> 3:11:01.360]  to have the next big thing that's going to be porno, new porno across the internet worldwide
[3:11:01.360 --> 3:11:06.480]  of everybody's body scanner till the end and all the rest of it.
[3:11:06.480 --> 3:11:10.200]  And then they'll have an investigation and reward whoever allowed it to happen.
[3:11:10.200 --> 3:11:14.680]  In fact, they're already saying the Hollywood bodies are going to go for big cash.
[3:11:14.680 --> 3:11:15.680]  Yeah.
[3:11:15.680 --> 3:11:23.160]  And people are obsessed today with sex as well because if you promote it over any rationale
[3:11:23.160 --> 3:11:29.480]  meaning of sex itself or even the fact that the sexual bonding between two people used
[3:11:29.480 --> 3:11:35.280]  to mean a good healthy family would come out of it, now not the promiscuity you have today
[3:11:35.280 --> 3:11:40.880]  and sold tickets so likely on television with the reality shows, which is all about that,
[3:11:40.880 --> 3:11:43.280]  no bonding at all, just have sex.
[3:11:43.280 --> 3:11:47.120]  So that's why they're hitting the public now with this, they've degraded the public
[3:11:47.120 --> 3:11:52.800]  from the last generation to the present generation and really they've been degrading the public
[3:11:52.800 --> 3:11:56.040]  since the olden 50s onwards quite steadily.
[3:11:56.040 --> 3:11:59.680]  And that way the man and woman don't stay together and the state ends up getting the
[3:11:59.680 --> 3:12:00.680]  children effectively.
[3:12:00.680 --> 3:12:01.680]  Absolutely.
[3:12:01.680 --> 3:12:06.480]  And that's again what they said it has to do a long time ago, if we can get the children
[3:12:06.480 --> 3:12:11.840]  separated from the parents with scientific indoctrination from kindergarten onwards,
[3:12:11.840 --> 3:12:13.520]  their minds are ours.
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:17.720]  But then if you try to homeschool your kids, they come and arrest you now with trumped
[3:12:17.720 --> 3:12:19.280]  up made up stuff.
[3:12:19.280 --> 3:12:25.760]  Well, in the Italian newspapers, a few months ago, the prime minister of Italy said there's
[3:12:25.760 --> 3:12:31.120]  an outright ban now on all homeschooling, he said the reason is it says every child
[3:12:31.120 --> 3:12:34.240]  must have the exact same indoctrination.
[3:12:34.240 --> 3:12:36.240]  Those were the words.
[3:12:36.240 --> 3:12:45.680]  Here they call it socialization indoctrination into the new PC terminology to alter your
[3:12:45.680 --> 3:12:49.240]  way of thinking about things for that generation to grow often.
[3:12:49.240 --> 3:12:53.160]  And anyone that doubts that that standardized programming they're being given so they can
[3:12:53.160 --> 3:12:58.440]  have their social control, California two years ago had their court rule, they got overturned
[3:12:58.440 --> 3:13:01.240]  in a federal court and we read it here on air.
[3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:03.440]  It said the state actually owns your children.
[3:13:03.440 --> 3:13:04.920]  You're not allowed to homeschool.
[3:13:04.920 --> 3:13:05.920]  Yes.
[3:13:05.920 --> 3:13:06.920]  That's right.
[3:13:06.920 --> 3:13:12.080]  And Hillary Clinton, who ran on that ticket as well, that she would abolish all homeschooling
[3:13:12.080 --> 3:13:18.040]  as a must be for all the big top communists, I loosely call them communists for the world
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:20.240]  to bring in the system of standardized.
[3:13:20.240 --> 3:13:25.840]  It would be better that your children get no education at all than to be put in public
[3:13:25.840 --> 3:13:26.840]  schools.
[3:13:26.840 --> 3:13:27.840]  Go ahead.
[3:13:27.840 --> 3:13:28.840]  Absolutely.
[3:13:28.840 --> 3:13:34.960]  Because again, for the wonderful utopia of socialism and a passive society, the children
[3:13:34.960 --> 3:13:40.480]  all must part of the same things, all believe the same things, all having sex with an animal
[3:13:40.480 --> 3:13:42.200]  is good.
[3:13:42.200 --> 3:13:47.800]  And all this all was coming up and then take three years ago, the new freedom initiative
[3:13:47.800 --> 3:13:53.000]  got leaked, Bush signed it four years ago that the internal documents from the federal
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  board came out.
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:57.080]  This was in the Associated Press, but like it was a good thing.
[3:13:57.080 --> 3:14:05.040]  They said we've got 20% of kids on government issue drugs now by 2015 we want 50%.
[3:14:05.040 --> 3:14:12.880]  And then in the decade after that, 100% on drugs, 100% with forced inoculations, 100%
[3:14:12.880 --> 3:14:13.880]  on the drugs.
[3:14:13.880 --> 3:14:19.040]  And those drugs will be for a life, so you have a whole generation on drugs for a life
[3:14:19.040 --> 3:14:24.440]  just like the movie we mentioned there, the THX movie, just like that.
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:28.480]  And you'll get put into a workplace, you'll be tested for your urine all day long, so
[3:14:28.480 --> 3:14:31.760]  you'll get blood tests to make sure you've taken all your proper drugs and medications
[3:14:31.760 --> 3:14:37.200]  to be punished if you haven't, and that will become normal.
[3:14:37.200 --> 3:14:40.560]  And what's sick about it is you read UN and government documents that we've covered in
[3:14:40.560 --> 3:14:45.200]  detail here, there's literally thousands of them, and then everybody kept saying I should
[3:14:45.200 --> 3:14:52.200]  see the movie Equilibrium and I saw it and that's actually what they're setting up.
[3:14:52.200 --> 3:14:55.600]  They just throw in our faces what they're doing.
[3:14:55.600 --> 3:15:02.400]  Yeah, it's also predictive programming because predictive programming is a strange thing
[3:15:02.400 --> 3:15:06.680]  because when you're being entertained, you don't realize you're also being indoctrinated
[3:15:06.680 --> 3:15:12.160]  with an idea and you're not passing judgment while you're watching entertainment because
[3:15:12.160 --> 3:15:15.560]  the sensor part of your brain is not involved.
[3:15:15.560 --> 3:15:19.040]  So if it stays in your subconscious and then when you hear it's coming out into reality
[3:15:19.040 --> 3:15:24.760]  they're actually going to do this, it's familiar to you and therefore it's not such a big deal
[3:15:24.760 --> 3:15:28.400]  that you go along with it, that's the predictive programming it's all about.
[3:15:28.400 --> 3:15:32.520]  We know 40 years ago they had these passive MRI body scanners and now they're saying
[3:15:32.520 --> 3:15:36.360]  oh we've got to scan into your body, it took them two days to do that after I said they
[3:15:36.360 --> 3:15:38.280]  would because that's their program.
[3:15:38.280 --> 3:15:43.240]  Remember total recall with Schwarzenegger and all these other science fiction movies
[3:15:43.240 --> 3:15:47.200]  where when you go through the airport men in black scheme ask, run you through a system
[3:15:47.200 --> 3:15:49.880]  that scans your naked body.
[3:15:49.880 --> 3:15:58.000]  Oh yeah and the book that it came from was written in 1966.
[3:15:58.000 --> 3:16:03.560]  I just can't believe, I mean I knew it was going to happen, I knew it would start accelerating
[3:16:03.560 --> 3:16:09.640]  but Alan do you ever just pinch yourself to witness it and to know this is just the beginning?
[3:16:09.640 --> 3:16:14.440]  I'm never shocked to be honest with you, I know what's to come up and I know in the
[3:16:14.440 --> 3:16:21.800]  next 50 stages that they come up in the next 20 years so I'm never shocked, I always, I
[3:16:21.800 --> 3:16:26.120]  read their books, I know how they work, I know the pulse on the public, they know when
[3:16:26.120 --> 3:16:29.800]  the public are now ready for the next move and it's how they-
[3:16:29.800 --> 3:16:33.800]  I just can't believe how pathetic the public are.
[3:16:33.800 --> 3:16:43.440]  You've got to realize too that 87% as I say from World War I on the same tests, 87% never
[3:16:43.440 --> 3:16:48.680]  really disbelieve the major media, they never question the why's, they believe governments
[3:16:48.680 --> 3:16:53.440]  telling them the truth, they can't believe that big lies are told to get us into wars
[3:16:53.440 --> 3:16:59.680]  and stuff, that's just too big a lie, so it must be true and those are the ones they concentrate
[3:16:59.680 --> 3:17:04.880]  on, that's why they picked by the way democracy, democracy is not ruled by the mob, is that
[3:17:04.880 --> 3:17:10.640]  the mob will always be easily conditioned by the minority who rule them.
[3:17:10.640 --> 3:17:15.160]  Alan, go over the next several phases.
[3:17:15.160 --> 3:17:20.720]  Well, the Copenhagen agreement, what they agreed to was the most important thing of
[3:17:20.720 --> 3:17:26.560]  all and I knew that they would and I mentioned it, I said they'll agree to agree to the next
[3:17:26.560 --> 3:17:29.960]  phases of the upgraded Copenhagen agreement.
[3:17:29.960 --> 3:17:32.160]  And then leave it nebulous so they could do whatever they wanted.
[3:17:32.160 --> 3:17:36.920]  It's a blank board, they can go in there and now and they've all agreed to sign on to whatever
[3:17:36.920 --> 3:17:42.720]  is put on that and they will, that's what it's about.
[3:17:42.720 --> 3:17:47.440]  But we are forcing them to not have everybody sign on to it so it's illustrated that it's
[3:17:47.440 --> 3:17:48.440]  pure tyranny.
[3:17:48.440 --> 3:17:54.600]  Yes, as long as it's noted somewhere in the history books there are protesters with another
[3:17:54.600 --> 3:18:02.040]  view on all of this and they can cohesively put their view over in a good format and that
[3:18:02.040 --> 3:18:03.840]  goes down in the history books.
[3:18:03.840 --> 3:18:07.440]  This is how with the green tyranny they always try to make it unified.
[3:18:07.440 --> 3:18:13.280]  Everyone agrees, no one disagreed, not one scientist disagreed and it's just an all
[3:18:13.280 --> 3:18:14.280]  a lie.
[3:18:14.280 --> 3:18:19.840]  Yes, the science has settled at Al Gore, which is the most unscientific statement you could
[3:18:19.840 --> 3:18:25.920]  meet because science must always go over previous findings and constantly dissect it, we try
[3:18:25.920 --> 3:18:26.920]  it.
[3:18:26.920 --> 3:18:32.200]  So it's all, it's a political communist ploy using an excuse to get communism through.
[3:18:32.200 --> 3:18:36.200]  That's what it is.
[3:18:36.200 --> 3:18:40.360]  Remember at the Reece Commission they said their job was for the foundations with all
[3:18:40.360 --> 3:18:46.920]  their thousands of NGOs was to alter the culture so drastically in the western world.
[3:18:46.920 --> 3:18:50.600]  They blend it seamlessly with that, the Soviet Union.
[3:18:50.600 --> 3:18:54.200]  Well that's what it's all about but they can't see where we're going along with communism
[3:18:54.200 --> 3:18:55.200]  now.
[3:18:55.200 --> 3:19:00.000]  So they use different names for different parts of it but it's the same agenda, a socialist
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:05.400]  system worldwide with experts running the world and all the lesser ones doing what they're
[3:19:05.400 --> 3:19:09.520]  told with obedience, that's what they're bringing in.
[3:19:09.520 --> 3:19:15.680]  So any excuse we'll do, a comment from outer space will hit us in the year 2060 or anything
[3:19:15.680 --> 3:19:20.760]  we'll do, any farce we'll do and this is the one that ticked on.
[3:19:20.760 --> 3:19:24.800]  Oh, it's unbelievable Alan.
[3:19:24.800 --> 3:19:27.680]  I'm going to come back and take calls for the balance of the 40 minutes we have left
[3:19:27.680 --> 3:19:33.040]  with you, it just hurts me at a primitive level because I have this defense mechanism
[3:19:33.040 --> 3:19:38.480]  for innocence to watch them arresting homeschooling parents now for no reason in America, it's
[3:19:38.480 --> 3:19:46.120]  just, we have fallen so far.
[3:19:46.120 --> 3:19:52.640]  The US was the last country in the world that has strong family units and they're demolishing
[3:19:52.640 --> 3:19:54.400]  it right now.
[3:19:54.400 --> 3:20:01.400]  They're outlawing it and they take the rebellion of the children and turn it against the parents.
[3:20:01.400 --> 3:20:04.840]  Unbelievable.
[3:20:04.840 --> 3:20:06.720]  This is an emergency alert.
[3:20:06.720 --> 3:20:11.520]  People don't die of H1N1 infection, they die from system-wide intoxication and toxic
[3:20:11.520 --> 3:20:12.520]  shock.
[3:20:12.520 --> 3:20:17.760]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyper stimulation.
[3:20:17.760 --> 3:20:21.800]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body adding to your
[3:20:21.800 --> 3:20:23.320]  death risk.
[3:20:23.320 --> 3:20:27.640]  Death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations and drug toxicity.
[3:20:27.640 --> 3:20:32.560]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives,
[3:20:32.560 --> 3:20:33.800]  maybe even your own.
[3:20:33.800 --> 3:20:35.720]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[3:20:35.720 --> 3:20:41.320]  Order zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard and vaccine
[3:20:41.320 --> 3:20:42.320]  cleanse.
[3:20:42.320 --> 3:20:44.160]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[3:20:44.160 --> 3:20:49.680]  Use zeolife and oxy-silver hydrosol instead to detox and de-germ your body.
[3:20:49.680 --> 3:20:52.520]  Stop the shock of toxicity and preventable deaths.
[3:20:52.520 --> 3:21:00.720]  Call 1-888-K-O-Germs, that's 1-888-K-O-Germs, or visit zeolife.net and oxysilver.net and
[3:21:00.720 --> 3:21:05.560]  order your free report and package special.
[3:21:05.560 --> 3:21:09.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:21:09.280 --> 3:21:12.440]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:21:12.440 --> 3:21:16.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[3:21:16.800 --> 3:21:17.800]  at home.
[3:21:17.800 --> 3:21:22.920]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[3:21:22.920 --> 3:21:23.920]  shots.
[3:21:23.920 --> 3:21:28.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:21:28.680 --> 3:21:34.200]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[3:21:34.200 --> 3:21:38.880]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:21:38.880 --> 3:21:41.320]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:21:41.320 --> 3:21:45.440]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:21:45.440 --> 3:21:51.280]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[3:21:51.280 --> 3:21:52.280]  of the Republic.
[3:21:52.280 --> 3:21:57.120]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[3:21:57.120 --> 3:22:03.640]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:22:03.640 --> 3:22:07.680]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, January 6, 2010.
[3:22:07.680 --> 3:22:15.120]  Gold opened this morning at 1126.70, a one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for 1157.39, 578.70
[3:22:15.120 --> 3:22:23.640]  or a half-ounce, or 289.35 for the quarter-ounce, that's 1157.39, 578.70, and 289.35.
[3:22:23.640 --> 3:22:28.200]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed
[3:22:28.200 --> 3:22:31.960]  the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a
[3:22:31.960 --> 3:22:36.120]  privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes
[3:22:36.120 --> 3:22:37.240]  to service the debt?
[3:22:37.240 --> 3:22:41.920]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, the central bank issuing a public
[3:22:41.920 --> 3:22:46.000]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[3:22:46.000 --> 3:22:50.440]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary
[3:22:50.440 --> 3:22:51.600]  system works.
[3:22:51.600 --> 3:22:55.600]  Call for your copy, 1-800-686-2237.
[3:22:55.600 --> 3:22:57.560]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[3:22:57.560 --> 3:23:03.800]  Call 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237.
[3:23:03.800 --> 3:23:07.760]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Akola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[3:23:07.760 --> 3:23:10.640]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[3:23:10.640 --> 3:23:12.720]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[3:23:12.720 --> 3:23:16.920]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[3:23:16.920 --> 3:23:20.440]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Akola Blue, you'll know what's
[3:23:20.440 --> 3:23:21.440]  in your cup.

[3:23:28.400 --> 3:23:29.840]  for your home or business.

[3:23:34.560 --> 3:23:37.720]  The Akola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.

[3:23:40.160 --> 3:23:44.120]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including
[3:23:44.120 --> 3:23:47.720]  reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:13.560]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:24:13.560 --> 3:24:17.760]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:22.160]  We're going to Dustin, Justin, Mark, Ken, and others in just one moment for the balance
[3:24:22.160 --> 3:24:25.360]  of the hour, taking your phone calls, hitting some other news.
[3:24:25.360 --> 3:24:28.400]  But I want to lay it out there.
[3:24:28.400 --> 3:24:35.400]  Joseph McCarthy, the Russians have now declassified it a decade ago, was absolutely right about
[3:24:35.400 --> 3:24:38.000]  everything, to a certain point.
[3:24:38.000 --> 3:24:43.360]  As soon as he found out the Pentagon was running the Communist, which has now been declassified,
[3:24:43.360 --> 3:24:46.040]  funding him, he was destroyed.
[3:24:46.040 --> 3:24:50.040]  As soon as he found out big financiers were running it to consolidate power, to socialize
[3:24:50.040 --> 3:24:56.240]  our wealth, we need to realize we are up against a conspiracy of parasites and control freaks
[3:24:56.240 --> 3:25:01.260]  and compartmentalized crooks that the social engineers hire and roll out their programs
[3:25:01.260 --> 3:25:03.160]  through federal reserve money worldwide.
[3:25:03.160 --> 3:25:05.280]  They have unlimited money.
[3:25:05.280 --> 3:25:08.320]  And really start recognizing when somebody wants to interrogate your kids, they're a
[3:25:08.320 --> 3:25:11.400]  hardcore, anti-American piece of trash.
[3:25:11.400 --> 3:25:15.400]  When somebody wants to force drug you, they're your enemy, not just over governments out
[3:25:15.400 --> 3:25:16.880]  of control.
[3:25:16.880 --> 3:25:20.400]  We need to gut up and start letting these people know we know your criminals and let
[3:25:20.400 --> 3:25:23.240]  their minions know their criminals.
[3:25:23.240 --> 3:25:25.600]  And they're all engaged in crime.
[3:25:25.600 --> 3:25:27.600]  They've all are immoral.
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:31.240]  You track a corrupt mayor, a corrupt judge, you're going to find them doing crimes.
[3:25:31.240 --> 3:25:32.240]  Put it on YouTube.
[3:25:32.240 --> 3:25:33.240]  Burn them.
[3:25:33.240 --> 3:25:38.240]  I mean, folks, if you activate as secret operatives against the New World Order, there's no orders.
[3:25:38.240 --> 3:25:39.240]  You know evil.
[3:25:39.240 --> 3:25:40.240]  You know corruption.
[3:25:40.240 --> 3:25:41.880]  Engage them.
[3:25:41.880 --> 3:25:43.840]  Turn yourselves loose.
[3:25:43.840 --> 3:25:46.240]  Look what I've done in 14 years.
[3:25:46.240 --> 3:25:47.880]  Devastating the enemy.
[3:25:47.880 --> 3:25:48.880]  Devastating the enemy.
[3:25:48.880 --> 3:25:51.080]  And I'm only one person with one operation.
[3:25:51.080 --> 3:25:54.200]  You can all activate and do things untold.
[3:25:54.200 --> 3:25:57.720]  The enemy operates covertly.
[3:25:57.720 --> 3:25:59.840]  You can operate overtly, covertly.
[3:25:59.840 --> 3:26:01.360]  There's so many ways to beat them.
[3:26:01.360 --> 3:26:04.920]  But when you realize you're in a scientific dictatorship, you're fighting for your very
[3:26:04.920 --> 3:26:05.920]  future.
[3:26:05.920 --> 3:26:07.560]  They're already poisoning people en masse.
[3:26:07.560 --> 3:26:12.000]  We are in the middle of just absolute war, as Alan Watt was saying.
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:13.000]  Alan?
[3:26:13.000 --> 3:26:14.000]  Yes.
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:19.120]  And hopefully one day down the road, the biggest Nuremberg trial ever ever put on in
[3:26:19.120 --> 3:26:26.040]  history, where all these characters will pay for their crimes against humanity.
[3:26:26.040 --> 3:26:30.080]  And public service announcements will be educating people in sophisticated propaganda so they
[3:26:30.080 --> 3:26:33.520]  know how to recognize scumbag lying and manipulation.
[3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:40.080]  I really think the signs and symptoms of the psychopath should be taught in school.
[3:26:40.080 --> 3:26:45.080]  Because you need the type to go up into these positions, they get into the pentagon, they
[3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:48.480]  get the ranks of business, they get the ranks of politics.
[3:26:48.480 --> 3:26:54.280]  They have an insatiable craving for utter complete power.
[3:26:54.280 --> 3:26:56.720]  And they are definite signs and symptoms with them.
[3:26:56.720 --> 3:27:00.400]  They're totally corruptible because they have no right or wrongs within them.
[3:27:00.400 --> 3:27:04.280]  Whatever is right, it simply benefits them.
[3:27:04.280 --> 3:27:06.440]  But we've got to expose them for who they are.
[3:27:06.440 --> 3:27:11.480]  And they're obsessed with the science of control that they spend trillions studying.
[3:27:11.480 --> 3:27:12.480]  Yes.
[3:27:12.480 --> 3:27:16.400]  And you're quite correct though when you say that when they want to drug your children
[3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:17.400]  and so on.
[3:27:17.400 --> 3:27:22.080]  It's the same as coming to kill your children, they're coming to destroy the brain of your
[3:27:22.080 --> 3:27:23.080]  child.
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:27.920]  They're so, they're destiny, they're will.
[3:27:27.920 --> 3:27:32.640]  Then you're dealing with murderers here and they must be treated as murderers.
[3:27:32.640 --> 3:27:36.400]  Don't lose what they're really doing through scientific counting.
[3:27:36.400 --> 3:27:37.400]  Exactly.
[3:27:37.400 --> 3:27:41.360]  I think the biggest awakening, Alan, is realizing, I mean, I'm a normal person.
[3:27:41.360 --> 3:27:45.400]  I'm a normal red-blooded aggressive person who isn't stupid but I'm not that smart.
[3:27:45.400 --> 3:27:49.400]  And when I read scientific manuals on how they're attacking everyone, I start warning
[3:27:49.400 --> 3:27:52.200]  people, what are you supposed to do?
[3:27:52.200 --> 3:27:57.680]  And it's got to be a mass movement, it's going to be a mass movement, grassroots.
[3:27:57.680 --> 3:28:02.280]  And they're going to put up fake movements and fake left, right and fake tea parties
[3:28:02.280 --> 3:28:06.680]  and fake, no, you got to go into all those groups, use those groups against themselves
[3:28:06.680 --> 3:28:11.760]  and use those organizations to educate the core people to then seek as most of the leaders
[3:28:11.760 --> 3:28:12.760]  don't even know.
[3:28:12.760 --> 3:28:14.720]  Well, yeah, lots of them are out of the loop.
[3:28:14.720 --> 3:28:17.800]  They don't have to be in the loop and a lot of them prefer to be out of the loop because
[3:28:17.800 --> 3:28:24.160]  they've got plausible deniability, their own pockets are getting well feathered and nested.
[3:28:24.160 --> 3:28:28.680]  So they don't care how things are done as long as their name is kept out of it.
[3:28:28.680 --> 3:28:32.840]  But technically one day she'll come and they will all answer for their crimes, their massive
[3:28:32.840 --> 3:28:33.840]  crimes, absolutely.
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:35.600]  But that's the sick part about the Neural Order.
[3:28:35.600 --> 3:28:40.680]  They have this sick logic, dark logic is what I call it, of where they have to warn us about
[3:28:40.680 --> 3:28:46.600]  what they're doing and then they love, statistically, they attack their own mid-level and low-level
[3:28:46.600 --> 3:28:49.160]  minions.
[3:28:49.160 --> 3:28:50.160]  It's like a religion.
[3:28:50.160 --> 3:28:53.440]  They'll say, we did this to you, now watch us take this minion.
[3:28:53.440 --> 3:28:57.800]  I just ripped him about it, I mean, and then they almost, those of us that are awake, they
[3:28:57.800 --> 3:29:04.960]  almost respect us and if we get persecuted and go through it, then it's almost like we're
[3:29:04.960 --> 3:29:05.960]  a sacred cow.
[3:29:05.960 --> 3:29:06.960]  I don't know how to describe it.
[3:29:06.960 --> 3:29:12.560]  Well, you can understand the psychopath lives on pure ego, their own ego.
[3:29:12.560 --> 3:29:17.000]  And outside of that, ego, nothing really exists, so they love to boast.
[3:29:17.000 --> 3:29:22.320]  It's like a serial rapist is no different, they're very clever, when they get caught
[3:29:22.320 --> 3:29:27.280]  they will tell you everything, how clever they were with every one of their crimes, quite
[3:29:27.280 --> 3:29:31.720]  openly, lately, no remorse, no emotion, but they want you to respect them for being so
[3:29:31.720 --> 3:29:32.720]  dark and clever.
[3:29:32.720 --> 3:29:33.720]  That's the psychopath.
[3:29:33.720 --> 3:29:39.280]  So that's why the attack, that they're lessers, they infight at times for more power amongst
[3:29:39.280 --> 3:29:40.280]  themselves.
[3:29:40.280 --> 3:29:46.720]  I've also been told by top globalists that they enjoy hearing about how evil they are.
[3:29:46.720 --> 3:29:47.720]  They love it.
[3:29:47.720 --> 3:29:53.080]  This show is one of their favorite entertainments, and the public says, ah, kill me, I love it.
[3:29:53.080 --> 3:29:54.600]  They ride back with your calls.
[3:29:54.600 --> 3:29:58.400]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[3:29:58.400 --> 3:30:02.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:02.040 --> 3:30:09.760]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:30:09.760 --> 3:30:14.600]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[3:30:14.600 --> 3:30:18.600]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[3:30:18.600 --> 3:30:23.240]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[3:30:23.240 --> 3:30:28.480]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[3:30:28.480 --> 3:30:34.760]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[3:30:34.760 --> 3:30:39.080]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[3:30:39.080 --> 3:30:44.400]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:30:44.400 --> 3:30:49.680]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[3:30:49.680 --> 3:30:55.680]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the
[3:30:55.680 --> 3:30:57.240]  Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:30:57.240 --> 3:31:05.800]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[3:31:05.800 --> 3:31:09.920]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:31:09.920 --> 3:31:13.080]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:31:13.080 --> 3:31:17.440]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:31:17.440 --> 3:31:18.440]  at home.
[3:31:18.440 --> 3:31:23.440]  I've turned an endless influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling
[3:31:23.440 --> 3:31:24.440]  the shots.
[3:31:24.440 --> 3:31:29.400]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:31:29.400 --> 3:31:35.440]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel hell-bent
[3:31:35.440 --> 3:31:39.560]  on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:31:39.560 --> 3:31:43.920]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[3:31:43.920 --> 3:31:45.920]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:31:45.920 --> 3:31:51.920]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[3:31:51.920 --> 3:31:52.920]  of the Republic.
[3:31:52.920 --> 3:31:59.360]  Yet, your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, or watch it online right
[3:31:59.360 --> 3:32:05.000]  now in super-high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:32:05.000 --> 3:32:08.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:32:08.000 --> 3:32:12.360]  If you're going into a battle, and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[3:32:12.360 --> 3:32:13.360]  do you want?
[3:32:13.360 --> 3:32:15.360]  My answer would be, all I can get.
[3:32:15.360 --> 3:32:20.360]  In the battle for freedom, and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[3:32:20.360 --> 3:32:21.600]  How much do you want?
[3:32:21.600 --> 3:32:22.600]  When do you want it?
[3:32:22.600 --> 3:32:24.640]  Now, or after the battle starts?
[3:32:24.640 --> 3:32:25.760]  When will you need it?
[3:32:25.760 --> 3:32:27.880]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:32:27.880 --> 3:32:29.200]  Will there be any food?
[3:32:29.200 --> 3:32:30.680]  Will it make your children sick?
[3:32:30.680 --> 3:32:34.800]  If there's a quarantine, and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:32:34.800 --> 3:32:36.000]  and be immunized?
[3:32:36.000 --> 3:32:39.800]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:32:39.800 --> 3:32:43.400]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:32:43.400 --> 3:32:44.640]  How much will you need?
[3:32:44.640 --> 3:32:45.640]  We don't know.
[3:32:45.640 --> 3:32:46.640]  How much do you want?
[3:32:46.640 --> 3:32:47.640]  All you can get.
[3:32:47.640 --> 3:32:48.640]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:32:48.640 --> 3:32:51.880]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[3:32:51.880 --> 3:32:59.800]  Call 1-800-409-5633, or check it out on the web, at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number
[3:32:59.800 --> 3:33:06.800]  1-800-409.
[3:33:29.800 --> 3:33:57.480]  That was Air Nationwide, that was the local loss inversion, saying, Mercury's good for
[3:33:57.480 --> 3:33:59.240]  your children.
[3:33:59.240 --> 3:34:03.280]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[3:34:03.280 --> 3:34:07.240]  They are making insanity mainline.
[3:34:07.240 --> 3:34:08.240]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[3:34:08.240 --> 3:34:11.440]  Alan Wadd, come to TheMatrix.com, is our guest.
[3:34:11.440 --> 3:34:12.440]  Very nice of him to join us.
[3:34:12.440 --> 3:34:14.760]  He's also in my film, Follow the Republic.
[3:34:14.760 --> 3:34:15.760]  Let's talk to Dustin.
[3:34:15.760 --> 3:34:18.360]  Dustin and PA, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[3:34:18.360 --> 3:34:20.560]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[3:34:20.560 --> 3:34:22.560]  Long time, first time.
[3:34:22.560 --> 3:34:29.760]  I live in a small town in Lancaster, PA, of 55,000.
[3:34:29.760 --> 3:34:36.160]  We recently had over 160 surveillance cameras put into our city.
[3:34:36.160 --> 3:34:42.360]  The LA Times on the June 21st of 09 issue did an article on us, little old Lancaster
[3:34:42.360 --> 3:34:49.560]  in LA, and how we have public, private companies watching us with our surveillance system.
[3:34:49.560 --> 3:34:54.720]  I do work for the city of Lancaster, and I expected that we would be in charge and ask
[3:34:54.720 --> 3:34:59.840]  some questions, and nobody knows nothing, but yet the government is federally funding
[3:34:59.840 --> 3:35:04.480]  over 170 surveillance cameras in our little old city.
[3:35:04.480 --> 3:35:09.200]  And that's to track everybody, every town's getting them, private groups get it, the government
[3:35:09.200 --> 3:35:14.720]  then in revolving doors, the private people in government make money as consultants and
[3:35:14.720 --> 3:35:17.560]  working for those companies, and so of course it's all privatized.
[3:35:17.560 --> 3:35:20.760]  They take your tax money, and then turn your town into a prison.
[3:35:20.760 --> 3:35:21.760]  Alan Watt.
[3:35:21.760 --> 3:35:26.360]  Oh, there's no doubt about it, a lot of big bucks are passed to the fed as well, they
[3:35:26.360 --> 3:35:27.360]  passed it.
[3:35:27.360 --> 3:35:32.760]  It's generally a company, or companies from Israel that get the contract, so they are
[3:35:32.760 --> 3:35:38.120]  heavy lobbyists for the variant company, they're the ones that put them all throughout
[3:35:38.120 --> 3:35:39.320]  Britain as well.
[3:35:39.320 --> 3:35:45.440]  And you're quite right, the whole idea is to, again, it's not just to track you, it's
[3:35:45.440 --> 3:35:51.440]  to get you used to being watched, to alter your behavior, you're not spontaneous anymore
[3:35:51.440 --> 3:35:55.680]  walking down on the street, even in company, you don't laugh the same, you don't joke the
[3:35:55.680 --> 3:35:58.680]  same, you're always aware you're being watched, so it's...
[3:35:58.680 --> 3:35:59.680]  Alan Watt.
[3:35:59.680 --> 3:36:02.680]  They're above you, they're the government, they're the all-seeing God.
[3:36:02.680 --> 3:36:03.680]  Alan Watt.
[3:36:03.680 --> 3:36:08.520]  Yes, but it literally, it actually encourages you to alter your own behavior until you become
[3:36:08.520 --> 3:36:12.960]  Sovietized, and the Soviet Union, you didn't look left or right, if you walked down the
[3:36:12.960 --> 3:36:18.520]  road, you stared at the sidewalk, and didn't make out wide contact with anyone, it could
[3:36:18.520 --> 3:36:19.520]  be dangerous.
[3:36:19.520 --> 3:36:20.520]  Alan Watt.
[3:36:20.520 --> 3:36:23.960]  By the way, that's been in the news, a lot of cops now, if you look at them, they pull
[3:36:23.960 --> 3:36:24.960]  over.
[3:36:24.960 --> 3:36:28.240]  You don't look at me, boy, you think this is America?
[3:36:28.240 --> 3:36:29.240]  Alan Watt.
[3:36:29.240 --> 3:36:33.240]  Yeah, that's right, and all the cops as you know have been completely militarized, same
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:39.640]  military training, they're one big brotherhood now on the winning side, you're now called
[3:36:39.640 --> 3:36:45.720]  civilians, you're not to the general public anymore, you're civilians, and you're threatening
[3:36:45.720 --> 3:36:49.720]  them when you look at them or steer at them, or even ask them a question, you're very threatening
[3:36:49.720 --> 3:36:50.720]  them.
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:51.720]  Alan Watt.
[3:36:51.720 --> 3:36:53.640]  Yeah, a lot of police around the country, oh excuse me officer, and he's like, do I look
[3:36:53.640 --> 3:37:02.520]  like a travel agency, get moving, pay the taxes, I mean it's just like, oh God, we're
[3:37:02.520 --> 3:37:03.520]  so humiliating.
[3:37:03.520 --> 3:37:04.520]  Alan Watt.
[3:37:04.520 --> 3:37:09.800]  It is, you see, we're living through turning, living through turning.
[3:37:09.800 --> 3:37:10.800]  Alan Watt.
[3:37:10.800 --> 3:37:13.120]  And then the cops that aren't like that get made fun of?
[3:37:13.120 --> 3:37:14.120]  Alan Watt.
[3:37:14.120 --> 3:37:17.320]  Yes, and they'll be out, if they can fit in, they'll be out.
[3:37:17.320 --> 3:37:18.320]  Alan Watt.
[3:37:18.320 --> 3:37:21.440]  Anything else Dustin, I mean why didn't the townspeople vote out the government and remove
[3:37:21.440 --> 3:37:22.440]  the stinking cameras?
[3:37:22.440 --> 3:37:23.440]  Dustin Watt.
[3:37:23.440 --> 3:37:28.160]  Yeah, well that's the thing, a lot of these people here, now we're in a very diverse city,
[3:37:28.160 --> 3:37:32.520]  they said we were a study for the government, federal government.
[3:37:32.520 --> 3:37:34.640]  They always say it's a study.
[3:37:34.640 --> 3:37:35.640]  Alan Watt.
[3:37:35.640 --> 3:37:40.680]  Well they said we're a study to see how effective these cameras are, now there's a, these cameras
[3:37:40.680 --> 3:37:45.560]  are out there, the cameras were at an intersection where a female was beaten to death by her
[3:37:45.560 --> 3:37:49.360]  boyfriend, but yet they happen to not catch that part on the camera.
[3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:50.360]  Dustin Watt.
[3:37:50.360 --> 3:37:54.280]  Oh no, no, no, they never prosecute any crime with it, because they like the crime, it's
[3:37:54.280 --> 3:37:59.000]  all to suck off the sheep and they're going to start nationwide taxing you by the miles
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:04.160]  there, it scans your license plate point to point and will ticket you, give you speed
[3:38:04.160 --> 3:38:05.160]  from point to point.
[3:38:05.160 --> 3:38:06.160]  Alan Watt.
[3:38:06.160 --> 3:38:11.080]  The guy that they have, I met the guy that's monitoring us in a back room somewhere that's
[3:38:11.080 --> 3:38:17.400]  not even on government property and he looks like one of the slumiest men that you would
[3:38:17.400 --> 3:38:18.400]  ever see.
[3:38:18.400 --> 3:38:19.400]  Dustin Watt.
[3:38:19.400 --> 3:38:21.400]  Well who do you think they heard?
[3:38:21.400 --> 3:38:22.400]  Alan Watt.
[3:38:22.400 --> 3:38:28.440]  It's very scary and people around here feel like they're being safe, but they don't realize
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:32.320]  that their whole civil liberties are being ripped out from underneath of them with a
[3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:33.320]  blink of an eye.
[3:38:33.320 --> 3:38:34.320]  Dustin Watt.
[3:38:34.320 --> 3:38:35.320]  Guys, go ahead.
[3:38:35.320 --> 3:38:36.320]  Alan Watt.
[3:38:36.320 --> 3:38:37.320]  Go ahead.
[3:38:37.320 --> 3:38:38.320]  Dustin Watt.
[3:38:38.320 --> 3:38:39.320]  Actually the eye doesn't blink, does it, Alex?
[3:38:39.320 --> 3:38:40.320]  It's always on us.
[3:38:40.320 --> 3:38:41.320]  Alan Watt.
[3:38:41.320 --> 3:38:45.400]  Now the all-sing-eye doesn't blink, I appreciate your call, but then every time there's a hijacker
[3:38:45.400 --> 3:38:49.520]  or a bomb or the cameras don't work, that's right Alan, isn't it?
[3:38:49.520 --> 3:38:50.520]  Alan Watt.
[3:38:50.520 --> 3:38:54.440]  Yeah, the main purpose of this day is to make us alter our behavior.
[3:38:54.440 --> 3:38:59.560]  We start to, we have a term at the United Nations for how we start to alter, it's called
[3:38:59.560 --> 3:39:00.560]  self-policing.
[3:39:00.560 --> 3:39:06.880]  We police ourselves because we're always being watched and it's almost a subconscious thing
[3:39:06.880 --> 3:39:13.160]  that creeps into you and takes over the way that you behave personally as a behavior modification
[3:39:13.160 --> 3:39:14.160]  project.
[3:39:14.160 --> 3:39:15.160]  Dustin Watt.
[3:39:15.160 --> 3:39:16.160]  Unbelievable.
[3:39:16.160 --> 3:39:19.800]  All right, I appreciate your call, sir.
[3:39:19.800 --> 3:39:24.840]  You should guerrilla shoot video of that and then of course in your free society we'll
[3:39:24.840 --> 3:39:29.800]  see if you're allowed to in America, but shoot video of the cameras, interview people, start
[3:39:29.800 --> 3:39:35.160]  a YouTube channel, you don't even have to use your name if you don't want and I would
[3:39:35.160 --> 3:39:38.720]  just come out in the open and you're right and start protesting these and try to get
[3:39:38.720 --> 3:39:40.880]  the town educated about what's happening.
[3:39:40.880 --> 3:39:44.840]  We sent to Curt Nimmo today, it's in color, this is just a scan of it.
[3:39:44.840 --> 3:39:50.880]  The Army out searching houses, Lexington homes searched in Hunt for bank robber and they
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:56.920]  use any excuse to lock down cities, randomly search all the homes, someone can be seen
[3:39:56.920 --> 3:40:00.920]  with a gun or they hear a backfire and they lock down parts of the towns.
[3:40:00.920 --> 3:40:04.120]  They're training us that they're the boss to protect us, of course, Ellen.
[3:40:04.120 --> 3:40:05.120]  Absolutely.
[3:40:05.120 --> 3:40:06.120]  I know.
[3:40:06.120 --> 3:40:07.120]  I know.
[3:40:07.120 --> 3:40:13.000]  I've seen it happen in Canada, in fact, where a hunter who fired off three Romans every year
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:19.680]  just sighting in for the hunting season, fired off on his own land in the country.
[3:40:19.680 --> 3:40:23.800]  He was opposite me at the time and a whole squad of carriages flew in there.
[3:40:23.800 --> 3:40:29.760]  A woman over the hill would move down a yuppie from the city, had heard the shots and in
[3:40:29.760 --> 3:40:34.360]  comes the SWAT team because they heard shots and he was firing against a hill which was
[3:40:34.360 --> 3:40:39.920]  his own hill he owned it for a backstop, there was no danger to anyone, miles from anywhere
[3:40:39.920 --> 3:40:47.720]  and even to hell trying to clear himself, he almost got shot by the SWAT team.
[3:40:47.720 --> 3:40:50.520]  Oh, that happens out in Travis County.
[3:40:50.520 --> 3:40:54.600]  People have their own 30, 40 acres, they shoot a shotgun and all these people move in from
[3:40:54.600 --> 3:40:59.880]  big cities and they start panicking guns, guns, but when they hear police with guns, they
[3:40:59.880 --> 3:41:04.680]  feel safe, but you know, they move out to the country in Texas and hear a gun and they're
[3:41:04.680 --> 3:41:10.120]  like, the slaves got a gun, let that neighbor's homeschooling call the police.
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:14.640]  They're being watched by television and that's the purpose of all the cop shows and television,
[3:41:14.640 --> 3:41:18.960]  they're not shows, they're not to entertain, it's propaganda to make you think they're
[3:41:18.960 --> 3:41:23.920]  all powerful, always correct, always above board and they have your interest at heart,
[3:41:23.920 --> 3:41:29.680]  they're in charge of all, over all the bad things and that's what all television dramas
[3:41:29.680 --> 3:41:33.320]  are, they're actually propaganda shows.
[3:41:33.320 --> 3:41:37.200]  That's unbelievable, let's go back to the calls here, I'm trying to hurry through them
[3:41:37.200 --> 3:41:41.320]  now, let's talk to Justin in Montana, then Mark and Maui, go ahead Justin.
[3:41:41.320 --> 3:41:46.720]  Alex, Alan, thanks for everything you guys do, I called about two reasons.
[3:41:46.720 --> 3:41:54.840]  One about the gunpowder and anybody who hunts or owns guns that they should start thinking
[3:41:54.840 --> 3:42:00.000]  about reloading and buying powder before they start making it expired, there's some talk
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:01.640]  about some powder that-
[3:42:01.640 --> 3:42:06.120]  No, the federal government does want to do that and they're openly buying up or shutting
[3:42:06.120 --> 3:42:13.600]  down the big gun manufacturers and ammo manufacturers and at the same time, they're now teaching
[3:42:13.600 --> 3:42:18.400]  realtors that reloading equipment is terrorism and people get the police called on them.
[3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:23.240]  Yeah, absolutely and the second thing was, I was following the story a couple days ago
[3:42:23.240 --> 3:42:28.400]  about this unmanned drones that the Houston police department's going to be using and
[3:42:28.400 --> 3:42:34.000]  that they just tested here, I don't know if it was yesterday or before yesterday, unmanned
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:38.240]  drones for spying on citizens with high-powered cameras on them.
[3:42:38.240 --> 3:42:44.560]  I think the headline is, unmanned UAV, Houston using unmanned UAV.
[3:42:44.560 --> 3:42:50.600]  Oh yeah, two years ago they got an FAA approval, that's nationwide and they're using CIA spy
[3:42:50.600 --> 3:42:54.960]  satellites for the environmentalists now, if you build a tiny shed on your property,
[3:42:54.960 --> 3:42:58.760]  I mean it's just hells being released.
[3:42:58.760 --> 3:43:02.040]  Well it sounds like it Alex, I just wanted to update you guys about that, thanks again
[3:43:02.040 --> 3:43:04.240]  for everything you guys do.
[3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:07.880]  Thank you and again, they want to bankrupt the economy, the economic numbers have come
[3:43:07.880 --> 3:43:12.240]  in, everything is accelerating in its implosion and they're just hiring more police, more
[3:43:12.240 --> 3:43:15.720]  bureaucrats, more controllers, more harassment, more in your face.
[3:43:15.720 --> 3:43:17.440]  I mean it's incredible Alan.
[3:43:17.440 --> 3:43:24.440]  Yeah and I know you have all the eco fees to come on top of every purchase that you
[3:43:24.440 --> 3:43:29.000]  buy basically and that's what it floated at the United Nations over 12 years ago, they
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:36.200]  said, they bring in a general world taxation for ecology, ecological reasons and they're
[3:43:36.200 --> 3:43:40.600]  getting what they want, they're adding eco fees to your tires, when you buy tires, when
[3:43:40.600 --> 3:43:45.800]  you take them back, batteries for cars, now it's batteries now for your flashlights, you're
[3:43:45.800 --> 3:43:51.640]  going to have paid disposal eco fees, so you're going to have all this stuff tacked on top
[3:43:51.640 --> 3:43:56.240]  and then after that, you're going to have energy eco fees for every can of beans that
[3:43:56.240 --> 3:44:00.760]  you buy, do you know how much energy it took to make this, you have to pay for that and
[3:44:00.760 --> 3:44:04.320]  this is all to go through the UN after going through the roster.
[3:44:04.320 --> 3:44:08.680]  While shutting down new power plants in the US and moving into China and India.
[3:44:08.680 --> 3:44:13.040]  Yes, and what gets me too, it's when Maurice Strong, one of the big players of the United
[3:44:13.040 --> 3:44:19.160]  Nations in the 1980s, he came in to privatize the electrical system for all of Ontario that
[3:44:19.160 --> 3:44:23.920]  was owned supposedly by the public, he did privatize it, he said at the time, we're not
[3:44:23.920 --> 3:44:29.120]  going to update the can do reactors that are built in Canada, he said, we're going to
[3:44:29.120 --> 3:44:34.760]  let them fall apart and only major corporations will have all these super devices to give
[3:44:34.760 --> 3:44:38.920]  them energy for the future for the rest of the public, it's just too bad we're taking
[3:44:38.920 --> 3:44:39.920]  it down.
[3:44:39.920 --> 3:44:44.920]  It's high tech reservations, government and corporate grids and all of us literally living
[3:44:44.920 --> 3:44:51.280]  in total, total, absolute complete poverty with new social services laws where if you're
[3:44:51.280 --> 3:44:54.360]  poor they're going to take your kids and it's all being announced.
[3:44:54.360 --> 3:45:00.080]  And also the can do reactor, Canada still builds them, we bought a whole bunch, we're
[3:45:00.080 --> 3:45:05.040]  building them for China, we're building them for India and elsewhere but we can't build
[3:45:05.040 --> 3:45:08.160]  any for Canada, you see.
[3:45:08.160 --> 3:45:12.720]  Unbelievable, let's take another call here, thank you caller, let's talk to the caller
[3:45:12.720 --> 3:45:16.960]  from Maui, Mark and Maui, welcome.
[3:45:16.960 --> 3:45:24.760]  In times of change, a patriot to the scarce man, brave, hated and scorned, but in time
[3:45:24.760 --> 3:45:31.480]  when his cause achieved, however, the timid joined him, for then it cost nothing to be
[3:45:31.480 --> 3:45:32.480]  a patriot.
[3:45:32.480 --> 3:45:33.480]  Put your flag down, come!
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:34.480]  How you doing Alex?
[3:45:34.480 --> 3:45:35.480]  Hey buddy, how you doing?
[3:45:35.480 --> 3:45:40.320]  I'm good, keep my shirt, thank you for Christmas.
[3:45:40.320 --> 3:45:44.040]  I got a lot of great gifts, what were the shirts?
[3:45:44.040 --> 3:45:48.560]  My upside down May Day, May Day, World Citizen Distress Order, put your flag for freedom,
[3:45:48.560 --> 3:45:51.760]  patriot to the stress, May Day shirt.
[3:45:51.760 --> 3:45:55.480]  I believe we did get some shirts like that, we got a lot of stuff but the guys in there
[3:45:55.480 --> 3:45:59.320]  are shaking their heads but I do think I saw those, what color are they?
[3:45:59.320 --> 3:46:04.720]  It's a white shirt with blue and red print and I think it's 12 of them, two for gifts
[3:46:04.720 --> 3:46:07.440]  and can you carry on your store online if you'd like.
[3:46:07.440 --> 3:46:08.960]  Yes, I got it, thank you.
[3:46:08.960 --> 3:46:11.560]  Thank you, what else is on your mind, sir?
[3:46:11.560 --> 3:46:16.320]  President Obama was over here in Hawaii and they stopped Kim Trellen and then he left
[3:46:16.320 --> 3:46:18.000]  and they started Kim Trellen again.
[3:46:18.000 --> 3:46:23.640]  I can't take it, we live in a wetter spot in the world and they're drying up.
[3:46:23.640 --> 3:46:32.240]  Well Obama loves you, he's a good man, he's really our president and everything's fine.
[3:46:32.240 --> 3:46:38.720]  I appreciate your call man, I tell you he's fired up, I tell you.
[3:46:38.720 --> 3:46:43.520]  Let me go ahead and go to the next caller here, calling up my call list.
[3:46:43.520 --> 3:46:47.320]  Let's talk to Ken and Mass, Ken you're on the year with Alan Watt, go ahead.
[3:46:47.320 --> 3:46:56.200]  Hi Alex, I'm a first time caller, I started listening to the show about a month ago and
[3:46:56.200 --> 3:46:58.600]  I'm calling about the body shears.
[3:46:58.600 --> 3:47:03.680]  I have a compromised immune system because I worked for years in hospitals and universities
[3:47:03.680 --> 3:47:09.320]  in Boston and I still have some radiation but I don't know yet, it came down with multiple
[3:47:09.320 --> 3:47:11.400]  form about 10 years ago.
[3:47:11.400 --> 3:47:16.800]  But that's what I meant by the New World Order, we have CBS News, mainstream tells you that
[3:47:16.800 --> 3:47:23.800]  these scanners and similar systems do hurt people and do radiate you and the TSA guys,
[3:47:23.800 --> 3:47:28.600]  they're all going to love getting testicular cancer, they're going to love getting cataracts
[3:47:28.600 --> 3:47:29.600]  from the radiation.
[3:47:29.600 --> 3:47:34.360]  I mean that's the sick part is the system always hurts its minions worse, go ahead.
[3:47:34.360 --> 3:47:39.040]  Well what I did is 10 years ago when I got the lymphoma, I went to Dana Farber's, one
[3:47:39.040 --> 3:47:43.200]  of the best hospitals in the world, and they told me that if I took the chemo every three
[3:47:43.200 --> 3:47:45.840]  months they'd try to keep me alive for five years.
[3:47:45.840 --> 3:47:49.440]  So I said I don't want to be sick for five years and die, I'll skip the chemo, well
[3:47:49.440 --> 3:47:51.800]  now this is 10 years, I'm still doing pretty good.
[3:47:51.800 --> 3:47:54.960]  Oh yeah, they would have sucked all the money out of you and killed you, oh yeah they would
[3:47:54.960 --> 3:48:00.960]  have drained me, yep, and so now I'm concerned about these scanners at the airports because
[3:48:00.960 --> 3:48:05.120]  I really can't afford any more radiation, so what I did this morning is I called Logan
[3:48:05.120 --> 3:48:11.040]  Airport and security and I told them that because I have a compromised immune system
[3:48:11.040 --> 3:48:16.160]  I really don't think I can go through these scanners and all that they suggest is maybe
[3:48:16.160 --> 3:48:20.160]  this is a bad idea, they said if I get a note from my doctor saying I can't go through
[3:48:20.160 --> 3:48:25.280]  it, that they would just pat me down instead, so I said you know if the listeners will go
[3:48:25.280 --> 3:48:28.880]  to the doctor and get a note from the doctors, and they'll be there.
[3:48:28.880 --> 3:48:33.920]  Let me expand on that, let me expand on that, then it's not saying it's bad to begin with
[3:48:33.920 --> 3:48:38.000]  and violates our privacy and doesn't protect us and that the Amsterdam airport had the
[3:48:38.000 --> 3:48:43.360]  stupid scanners, that gives into it though, but it's an interesting idea, Alan Watt comments
[3:48:43.360 --> 3:48:44.360]  on that.
[3:48:44.360 --> 3:48:50.360]  It's a weird around it, they did say that anyone who doesn't take it will get pat it
[3:48:50.360 --> 3:48:54.840]  down, however this also has the added function when you're scanned off going along with another
[3:48:54.840 --> 3:49:01.960]  part of the agenda which is complete sterilization of whatever fertility you still have left.
[3:49:01.960 --> 3:49:06.760]  We've got 85% or more down, they've got to get that last 15, and of course that's not
[3:49:06.760 --> 3:49:10.720]  a big crisis, in fact I have a magazine in here, where did it go?
[3:49:10.720 --> 3:49:16.040]  I see this everywhere, falling fertility, give me a close shot guys, falling fertility,
[3:49:16.040 --> 3:49:22.680]  how the population problem is solving itself from the Economist magazine and then you open
[3:49:22.680 --> 3:49:30.480]  it up and it says oh, isn't it wonderful, fertility is falling astonishingly fast and
[3:49:30.480 --> 3:49:36.600]  that's bringing big benefits, so they never say why suddenly people can't have kids or
[3:49:36.600 --> 3:49:42.200]  how the West is dying and they say this is wonderful, a dead dying culture in the West
[3:49:42.200 --> 3:49:49.360]  is good, just like shooting yourself in the head is good, but the elites are all obsessed
[3:49:49.360 --> 3:49:56.880]  with having 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 children, but it's just everywhere, I mean I listen to talk
[3:49:56.880 --> 3:50:01.040]  radio and it's always like there's too many kids, look at this family that tattooed their
[3:50:01.040 --> 3:50:06.000]  kids, look at how bad parents are, that's a PR thing, but never what the government
[3:50:06.000 --> 3:50:10.120]  does, how they're five to seven times depending on which country, more often to abuse than
[3:50:10.120 --> 3:50:14.280]  the other group, no they're the good ones, they're the government, they're gonna suck
[3:50:14.280 --> 3:50:19.960]  you dry, unbelievable, let's talk to Stephen in Canada up where Ellen wants it, Stephen
[3:50:19.960 --> 3:50:20.960]  go ahead.
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:21.960]  Hey how's it going?
[3:50:21.960 --> 3:50:22.960]  Go ahead.
[3:50:22.960 --> 3:50:30.320]  Good, glad to hear you're on the air, airwaves doing your thing, I've been listening for
[3:50:30.320 --> 3:50:36.120]  about six months now, yesterday there was a major development in the Canadian news up
[3:50:36.120 --> 3:50:42.680]  here that they're putting in 44 of these body scanners across the country, effective as
[3:50:42.680 --> 3:50:45.200]  of I believe the first of March.
[3:50:45.200 --> 3:50:48.760]  And they'd already pre-ordered them last year, I have the CTV on that, stay there we'll
[3:50:48.760 --> 3:50:53.080]  come back to you briefly Steve, Jamie and John and Douglas, our guest website is coming
[3:50:53.080 --> 3:50:58.920]  to TheMatrix.com, he's also a big part of Fall of the Republic, my film, you can order
[3:50:58.920 --> 3:51:07.080]  it at infowars.com and get a free t-shirt but that deal is ending soon.
[3:51:07.080 --> 3:51:12.680]  This is not a drill, repeat this is not a drill, gun cells are on a staggering pace,
[3:51:12.680 --> 3:51:16.920]  gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate vicious criminals now want
[3:51:16.920 --> 3:51:22.040]  your guns and will do anything to get them, now a new book reveals powerful secrets for

[3:52:18.600 --> 3:52:23.240]  We're turning memories of influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[3:52:23.240 --> 3:52:24.240]  calling the shots.
[3:52:24.240 --> 3:52:29.600]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.

[3:52:39.760 --> 3:52:44.080]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[3:52:44.080 --> 3:52:46.280]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[3:52:46.280 --> 3:52:52.120]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall

[3:54:09.680 --> 3:54:11.640]  Waging war on corruption.
[3:54:11.640 --> 3:54:16.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:54:16.640 --> 3:54:25.680]  Final segment with Alan Watt coming to TheMatrix.com, my websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[3:54:25.680 --> 3:54:26.680]  Stephen Canada.
[3:54:26.680 --> 3:54:33.480]  I have the article here in my stack, in fact I forgot to dig around for it during the break.
[3:54:33.480 --> 3:54:37.520]  Here it is, give me a close shot of this guys, the prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[3:54:37.520 --> 3:54:42.240]  The headline from CTV, that's the big TV station in Canada for those that don't know, Ottawa
[3:54:42.240 --> 3:54:50.440]  ordered airline scanners months ago, so the transportation minister Barrett said, see we
[3:54:50.440 --> 3:54:57.840]  were trying to protect you, notice how this all coincided Alan with the underwear bomber.
[3:54:57.840 --> 3:54:58.840]  Anything else Steve?
[3:54:58.840 --> 3:55:04.320]  Yeah, I just had a quick question, oh also they said that if you didn't want to do it
[3:55:04.320 --> 3:55:08.760]  you could opt out for the Pat down, which I think is a little bit of a rub.
[3:55:08.760 --> 3:55:12.880]  Yeah, so then they're going to phase that out, Gordon Brown even admitted what we already
[3:55:12.880 --> 3:55:13.880]  knew.
[3:55:13.880 --> 3:55:17.080]  First it's a few airports, then all airports, then well you can opt out, then you can't
[3:55:17.080 --> 3:55:19.040]  opt out.
[3:55:19.040 --> 3:55:22.440]  And then you get all these sheep by the millions in the database.
[3:55:22.440 --> 3:55:28.560]  Yeah, everything starts almost semi voluntarily and then it becomes mandatory because everyone
[3:55:28.560 --> 3:55:31.520]  else was along with it.
[3:55:31.520 --> 3:55:34.840]  Everyone must biometrically scan to get their driver's license now.
[3:55:34.840 --> 3:55:35.840]  Thank you Steve.
[3:55:35.840 --> 3:55:38.280]  John and Floor to go ahead, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[3:55:38.280 --> 3:55:41.920]  Alan, it's a pleasure speaking with you, can you hear me?
[3:55:41.920 --> 3:55:42.920]  Yes sir.
[3:55:42.920 --> 3:55:48.480]  I've been following the news vigorously for about two years now and just, you know, some
[3:55:48.480 --> 3:55:53.680]  things want to get up my head real fast, I know you don't have much time but I've witnessed
[3:55:53.680 --> 3:56:00.560]  Bill O'Reilly here do what seems to be a complete 180 recently, even Glenn Beck seems
[3:56:00.560 --> 3:56:02.800]  to be softening up.
[3:56:02.800 --> 3:56:09.080]  Yeah, they get the audience like I warned you and then they call for taxes.
[3:56:09.080 --> 3:56:13.800]  You're not a true conservative if you don't want to give the money to the banks.
[3:56:13.800 --> 3:56:16.480]  This was something that might enlighten people here.
[3:56:16.480 --> 3:56:22.520]  Honestly, I never heard of Alex Jones up until I did something.
[3:56:22.520 --> 3:56:30.240]  I connected my computer and my flat screen television and I started getting into other
[3:56:30.240 --> 3:56:33.560]  media that was out there and that's where I discovered you.
[3:56:33.560 --> 3:56:40.840]  Since then I've been trying to spread the word and have people connect their computers
[3:56:40.840 --> 3:56:46.520]  to their flat screen TVs and, you know, by going on YouTube and things like that.
[3:56:46.520 --> 3:56:50.520]  I got to jump in, you can call me back tomorrow if you want but this is a big revolution.
[3:56:50.520 --> 3:56:53.480]  What's going to kill Mainline TV, which is why they're moving to censor the web right
[3:56:53.480 --> 3:56:59.160]  now, is people plugging it into their television sets and stop tuning into Mainline TV.
[3:56:59.160 --> 3:57:03.840]  That's why they're putting stuff like myself, Jesse Ventura, the big show I was in last
[3:57:03.840 --> 3:57:08.280]  week, I mean multiple shows, but it's re-airing tonight, 8 o'clock Central.
[3:57:08.280 --> 3:57:12.920]  The new one premieres at 9 o'clock but that World Extermination Deathblot episode airs
[3:57:12.920 --> 3:57:17.440]  tonight at 8 again on True TV Central, 9 o'clock Eastern.
[3:57:17.440 --> 3:57:23.840]  But yes, they're moving to censor the web while also mainlining some of this info to
[3:57:23.840 --> 3:57:25.360]  kind of titrate the dose.
[3:57:25.360 --> 3:57:27.360]  Alan Watt, comments on that.
[3:57:27.360 --> 3:57:32.480]  There's no doubt about it, that's all coming down but last part I'd like to say on this
[3:57:32.480 --> 3:57:37.080]  body scanner is they've also floated quite a few years ago and it first floated the idea
[3:57:37.080 --> 3:57:44.920]  body scanner is total sedation of every passenger from takeoff to landing by farm out means
[3:57:44.920 --> 3:57:45.920]  as well.
[3:57:45.920 --> 3:57:51.160]  And the next thing they're going to float after this, how to drug you through the entire
[3:57:51.160 --> 3:57:55.480]  flight along with the bracelet where they can shock you if they don't get out your seat
[3:57:55.480 --> 3:57:56.480]  or whatever.
[3:57:56.480 --> 3:57:59.640]  Notice they're already turning the lights off even during daytime flights already telling
[3:57:59.640 --> 3:58:04.920]  you to sit down, of course the sturdices don't know, it's incremental, now keep your hands
[3:58:04.920 --> 3:58:06.560]  in your lap, you're a prisoner.
[3:58:06.560 --> 3:58:09.320]  That's right, that's right.
[3:58:09.320 --> 3:58:11.520]  I mean this is dog training is it not?
[3:58:11.520 --> 3:58:15.000]  It is, power flow of you, yep.
[3:58:15.000 --> 3:58:18.880]  Alan, incredible job, incredible contribution to follow the Republic, you're also going
[3:58:18.880 --> 3:58:21.840]  to be in follow the Republic part two we're working on.

[3:58:26.000 --> 3:58:27.600]  find more of your great work there.
[3:58:27.600 --> 3:58:29.160]  We'll talk to you again soon my friend.
[3:58:29.160 --> 3:58:30.920]  It has been a pleasure Alan.
[3:58:30.920 --> 3:58:31.920]  Take care Alan, what?
[3:58:31.920 --> 3:58:36.000]  Now I really broke down and they're breaking up the family and all the details, I meant
[3:58:36.000 --> 3:58:40.520]  to give the phone number out, we'll do it tomorrow for this family in trouble in New
[3:58:40.520 --> 3:58:41.520]  York.
[3:58:41.520 --> 3:58:46.120]  Ron Paul's on tomorrow, Ron Paul tomorrow, great job crew.
