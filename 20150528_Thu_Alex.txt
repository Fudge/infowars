[00:00.000 --> 00:05.240]  Now to a Texas sized conspiracy theory. Conspiracy theories are running
[00:05.240 --> 00:08.680]  wild tonight about the Army's plan for a multi-state training exercise this
[00:08.680 --> 00:13.360]  summer called Jade Helm 15. There are all kinds of conspiracy theories floating
[00:13.360 --> 00:16.960]  around about an upcoming Pentagon training exercise called Operation
[00:16.960 --> 00:21.960]  Jade Helm 15. The U.S. military is secretly plotting an invasion of the
[00:21.960 --> 00:26.040]  Lone Star State. Talk show host Alex Jones among the many stirring up
[00:26.040 --> 00:30.480]  concerns on conservative websites and social media that Jade Helm is a
[00:30.480 --> 00:37.760]  trojan horse for a federal invasion. A dress rehearsal for martial law.
[00:42.720 --> 00:48.680]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones who as David said has been one of the leading
[00:48.680 --> 00:53.600]  proponents of this theory had agreed to join us this morning but he did not show
[00:53.600 --> 00:57.400]  up at our studio. This is the dirty tricks they gotta pull. No none of my
[00:57.400 --> 01:02.440]  listeners buy it. Okay I'm ready. I'm ready to come on right now. The Jade Helm
[01:02.440 --> 01:08.360]  15 conspiracy theories are inspired by Alex Jones the nut job radio guy. The site
[01:08.360 --> 01:13.480]  Infowars has led the internet buzz insisting it's all a plan for the Army
[01:13.480 --> 01:19.640]  to wage war on Americans. Publishing a military PowerPoint slide showing Texas
[01:19.640 --> 01:24.280]  as red enemy territory. Texas the prospect of armed federal troops has
[01:24.280 --> 01:27.840]  sparked an avalanche of speculation including fears of a government
[01:27.840 --> 01:31.320]  conspiracy to launch a hostile takeover of the state. You know who's calling it a
[01:31.320 --> 01:36.960]  Texas takeover? Lone Star lunatics. They're there for corporate executives to
[01:36.960 --> 01:42.240]  load their teleprompter like a pes dispenser and then they just sit there
[01:42.240 --> 01:48.240]  and spout BS at people. My mom's tell all your babies don't mess with Texas. From
[01:48.240 --> 01:53.400]  Willie Nelson on down it's practically the slogan of the state. Don't mess with
[01:53.400 --> 01:59.440]  Texas. That may explain the reaction to Jade Helm 15. Some folks in that state
[01:59.440 --> 02:02.880]  have seemingly been shaking in their rawhide boots ever since word got out
[02:02.880 --> 02:08.560]  about an upcoming military training exercise in Texas called Jade Helm 15.
[02:08.560 --> 02:11.440]  Look come on crazy people at town local town hall meeting isn't a Texas
[02:11.440 --> 02:14.200]  specific story. I think the Constitution says you can't hold a town hall
[02:14.200 --> 02:25.160]  meeting without crazy people. I think it's in there. There's even a Texas
[02:25.160 --> 02:30.160]  Ranger on the case Walker Texas Ranger that is also known as Chuck Norris in a
[02:30.160 --> 02:34.000]  new column for the conservative website World Net Daily Norris writes quote if
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.960]  you haven't heard about Operation Jade Helm 15 you need to. For an invasion
[02:39.960 --> 02:46.080]  martial law. Mayor of Big Spring Larry McClellan has heard it all. He's gotten
[02:46.080 --> 02:49.880]  thousands of emails about Jade Helm conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories
[02:49.880 --> 02:55.880]  have now been floating around for weeks about a military operation in West Texas.
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.160]  So I'm thinking that it's totally appropriate in Iraq but we're kind of a
[03:07.160 --> 03:10.280]  situation in the US would you see that happening? I mean we've got a lot of
[03:10.280 --> 03:14.160]  Constitution lists and a lot of people that it's not caught with.
[03:24.160 --> 03:28.240]  Training with the police training with locals in plain clothes quote doing
[03:28.240 --> 03:32.200]  suspicious activities is to train the police to work with the military and
[03:32.200 --> 03:35.760]  covert operations and to condition the military to accept it and to condition
[03:35.760 --> 03:39.720]  the public to accept it and then when we cover it and talk about it they practice
[03:39.720 --> 03:44.480]  the Psyop in real time putting out this information. Conspiracy theories. Conspiracy
[03:44.480 --> 03:48.920]  theories. Texas sized conspiracy theory. Conspiracy theories. The government
[03:48.920 --> 03:53.280]  conspiracy Jade Helm conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories.
[03:53.280 --> 03:57.040]  The thing that kills me about conspiracy theories is they believe that they
[03:57.040 --> 04:00.720]  reflect like at a higher intelligence or a higher skepticism or a sense of
[04:00.720 --> 04:04.880]  awareness when in fact every conspiracy theories you know is gullible. Keep
[04:04.880 --> 04:10.600]  shoving lies at your audience jackasses. Please folks call Fox News, tweet them,
[04:10.600 --> 04:13.560]  tell them I'm ready. Right now.
[04:21.560 --> 04:25.440]  I think that's a healthy thing to question your government. I don't think it's
[04:25.440 --> 04:30.280]  particularly healthy to question the military. Alex Jones a man who trades in
[04:30.280 --> 04:34.000]  such sinister conspiracy theories you have to wonder if he really believes
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.360]  half of what he says. And they're always talking about false flag operations
[04:37.360 --> 04:41.000]  and they're so insulting and cruel like Alex Jones. Pretty speech is a great
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.680]  thing but then there's this shouting, firing and crowded theater idea which is
[04:44.680 --> 04:51.520]  not allowed to do. Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[04:51.520 --> 04:57.640]  on the GCN radio network. It's Thursday the 28th stay with us we're live
[04:57.640 --> 05:01.920]  broadcasting worldwide. The Pentagon admits it accidentally sent a shipment
[05:01.920 --> 05:06.960]  of live anthrax to as many as nine laboratories in the US as well as a
[05:06.960 --> 05:12.360]  lab overseas. A CDC investigation of this mistake is underway and at the time
[05:12.360 --> 05:16.360]  there is no known risk to the general public. The anthrax samples were shipped
[05:16.360 --> 05:20.680]  from an army facility in Utah to government and commercial labs in Texas,
[05:20.680 --> 05:25.200]  Maryland, Wisconsin, Delaware, New Jersey, Tennessee, New York, California and
[05:25.200 --> 05:29.560]  Virginia. The labs were working as part of a Pentagon effort to develop a new
[05:29.560 --> 05:35.040]  diagnostic test to identify biological threats in the environment. Dead or
[05:35.040 --> 05:39.880]  inactivated agents were expected but one lab reports being able to grow live
[05:39.880 --> 05:44.200]  axillus anthraxes. The safety failure comes on the heels of increased
[05:44.200 --> 05:49.280]  scrutiny of bioterror agents and their oversight around the country. Last June
[05:49.280 --> 05:54.160]  more than 80 people may have been exposed to live anthrax when a CDC lab
[05:54.160 --> 05:59.680]  sent it by a mistake. Leigh Ann McAdoo reporting for infowars.com. Introducing

[08:00.000 --> 08:13.760]  we are on the march the empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:15.760 --> 08:24.120]  in democratic party run cities like Chicago and Baltimore Maryland and DC
[08:24.120 --> 08:30.800]  there is a state of what the mainstream media is calling anarchy
[08:30.800 --> 08:36.600]  residents are fearful amid rash of homicides eight-year-old boy fatally
[08:36.600 --> 08:41.920]  shot in the head police say mobs gathered around officers when responding
[08:41.920 --> 08:50.280]  to calls Maryland sheriff says cops have been eviscerated disemboweled and what
[08:50.280 --> 08:55.320]  they're doing is intimidating the police ahead of summer for what is
[08:55.320 --> 09:06.200]  undoubtedly now a basically leftist slash communist style movement to then
[09:06.200 --> 09:11.240]  basically destabilize the country and then demand executive action for
[09:11.240 --> 09:15.520]  increased taxes on the quote rich that will actually be increased taxes on
[09:15.520 --> 09:20.520]  middle class and working class to further stall the economy which is the
[09:20.520 --> 09:26.680]  clowered and piven plan to bring down the nation there is now no doubt that
[09:26.680 --> 09:33.360]  socialist and race baiting and paramilitary style communist groups are
[09:33.360 --> 09:41.480]  being activated that have been bred and funded and coddled and basically brewed
[09:41.480 --> 09:48.760]  at these universities are now just being turned loose young black activists are
[09:48.760 --> 09:55.280]  being bused in from all over the country who are angry and many cases you
[09:55.280 --> 09:59.320]  don't have legitimate issues with problems with the police but they
[09:59.320 --> 10:06.440]  themselves are being used I don't know if the system is going to be
[10:06.440 --> 10:13.920]  successful I don't know if the system is going to get away with this I don't know
[10:13.920 --> 10:20.040]  if this is their main plan this summer so that Obama could smoke screen a whole
[10:20.040 --> 10:24.960]  bunch of other executive actions you've got bizarre economic developments
[10:24.960 --> 10:29.520]  taking place very very troubling you've got massive over-the-top military
[10:29.520 --> 10:35.320]  developments taking place extremely serious redlining when it comes to the
[10:35.320 --> 10:42.120]  danger zone we've got just huge cultural revolution pushes to openly declare
[10:42.120 --> 10:47.840]  Christians criminals to openly declare gun owners criminals to openly declare
[10:47.840 --> 10:53.000]  free speech criminal a complete coming out of the closet of the totalitarian
[10:53.000 --> 11:00.640]  left the fascist left as Ted Cruz calls them you've got America being conquered
[11:00.640 --> 11:07.000]  by the TPP that ties in contractually with the NAU and the EU the North
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.520]  American Union and European Union power grabbing over free speech on the
[11:12.520 --> 11:16.920]  internet power grabbing over the power structure and the infrastructure power
[11:16.920 --> 11:22.160]  grabbing over all water rights power grabbing power grabbing shutting down
[11:22.160 --> 11:28.720]  the border power grabbing federalizing police just this is the major assault
[11:28.720 --> 11:37.840]  this is the new world order takeover there is no doubt it is intense and you
[11:37.840 --> 11:41.440]  know I gotta say I'm getting chills I am I've got huge show bumps right now
[11:41.440 --> 11:47.080]  because it is just epic I've got a big vocabulary but the word is epic it is
[11:47.080 --> 11:57.000]  epic epic epic to be watching this happen right now and this is just the
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.640]  power grab the horrible poverty the horrible police state the horrible
[12:02.640 --> 12:08.840]  degradation the the elite above the law the diplomatic community the the death
[12:08.840 --> 12:14.840]  squads the kidnappings the the criminal mobs the fall America's gonna be just
[12:14.840 --> 12:20.880]  like Mexico just like chili chili again just 60 years ago was richer than any
[12:20.880 --> 12:26.240]  other country except for Switzerland it was a saying a hundred years ago as
[12:26.240 --> 12:30.760]  riches in Argentine because they had their own country their own economy
[12:30.760 --> 12:36.640]  their own infrastructure their own giant middle class as riches in Argentine
[12:36.640 --> 12:40.200]  I remember reading in 2000 the Washington Post when they've been in a
[12:40.200 --> 12:44.280]  depression for a year when they manipulated their currency and foreign
[12:44.280 --> 12:47.400]  banks have come in and taken over and plunge the economy on purpose to
[12:47.400 --> 12:52.840]  consolidate power that came out 9 of documents World Bank documents jointly
[12:52.840 --> 12:57.320]  two years later Joseph Stiklitz went public Nobel Prize winner for
[12:57.320 --> 13:04.840]  economics and it described a trailer full of cows pumping over outside their
[13:04.840 --> 13:11.320]  capital city and middle-class families with their torn clothing like something
[13:11.320 --> 13:16.160]  out of Armageddon fighting and cutting globulates of meat off with knives and
[13:16.160 --> 13:19.880]  when men women and children just gobbling meat on the side of the road
[13:19.880 --> 13:25.040]  like vultures Ted Anderson went there a few years ago and he said you'd see good
[13:25.040 --> 13:29.120]  look in middle-class families living in doorways you'd see doctors you know
[13:29.120 --> 13:33.560]  living on the street and that's what bondage is and the globalists live off
[13:33.560 --> 13:36.640]  shore they own their water they own their infrastructure they own their
[13:36.640 --> 13:41.400]  government they own their minds they own their their their their fields they
[13:41.400 --> 13:45.320]  own their agriculture they went from being the freest people in this
[13:45.320 --> 13:52.160]  hemisphere to being slaves and that is the journey we're now on
[13:56.840 --> 14:04.200]  that is the journey we're now on so I hope you enjoyed everybody you know
[14:04.200 --> 14:09.440]  that said I've got literally every day gets more intense the news is over the
[14:09.440 --> 14:12.520]  top I'm gonna read just some of the stack headlines here in a moment so you
[14:12.520 --> 14:17.320]  know what's coming up but let me first say this there's a video up on info wars
[14:17.320 --> 14:25.480]  calm that's also on the left-hand side of drudge report calm video some
[14:25.480 --> 14:31.120]  Americans think TPP is a brand of toilet paper no one has a clue about the
[14:31.120 --> 14:39.040]  trans-pacific partnership I'm going to send my son out today Rex Jones he's
[14:39.040 --> 14:42.800]  going to basically duplicate this report to see if people are as dumb down in
[14:42.800 --> 14:51.440]  Austin Texas I guarantee you if I send Rex summer now so he'll be here a lot
[14:51.440 --> 14:59.920]  during the week working with us at 12 I'm going to send him today to the
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.440]  University of Texas in the downtown trendy area by the pedestrian bridge and
[15:04.440 --> 15:13.160]  then next week I'm going to send him to a working-class industrial district and I
[15:13.160 --> 15:19.120]  guarantee you now that for every 10 people we talk to in the trendy area
[15:19.120 --> 15:23.360]  maybe one will know what the TPP is and I bet money when we talk to a working
[15:23.360 --> 15:28.160]  class people that actually pay bills and live in the real world I bet a third of
[15:28.160 --> 15:35.240]  them know what the TPP is it's the educated idiots that don't know how to
[15:35.240 --> 15:42.720]  find their butt with both hands getting their second or third degree to go get
[15:42.720 --> 15:48.560]  jobs that don't even exist now and then you got the trendies you know wearing
[15:48.560 --> 15:54.920]  their their hipster outfits and you look at them and all they've got is this
[15:54.920 --> 15:59.640]  dumb stare and they think it's funny they don't know what anything is but is it
[15:59.640 --> 16:10.360]  really their fault because the mainstream media will not cover it some
[16:10.360 --> 16:15.320]  newspapers are covering it and to their credit it's so draconian that even
[16:15.320 --> 16:18.680]  mainline leftist and mainline conservatives and then libertarians are
[16:18.680 --> 16:27.320]  the ones leading the charge constitutionalist are out saying it's
[16:27.320 --> 16:31.840]  draconian is totalitarian it's secret it power grabs everything but it's not a
[16:31.840 --> 16:38.320]  foreign army in uniforms conquering us so we don't get upset folks get upset of
[16:38.320 --> 16:41.600]  some commie burns an American flag I'm sure I don't like it but they're
[16:41.600 --> 16:46.280]  burning the actual liberty that the flag symbolizes we're being conquered and
[16:46.280 --> 16:52.520]  then everything that comes with it and it's because freedom produced so much
[16:52.520 --> 16:57.440]  incredible prosperity that it turned us into dumb down spoiled brats spoiled
[16:57.440 --> 17:05.320]  rats and a Freudian slip there on average myself included listen I get it I
[17:05.320 --> 17:08.600]  get wanting to watch movies wanting to go see rock concerts wanting to go to a
[17:08.600 --> 17:12.360]  football game wanting to drink a bunch of beer wanting to eat a big steak wanting
[17:12.360 --> 17:15.400]  to not care about this stuff wanting to go play golf wanting to go shooting
[17:15.400 --> 17:20.440]  wanting to go play laser tag or whatever with my kids I get it but here's the
[17:20.440 --> 17:26.480]  deal we're going to lose everything now if we don't turn this around and when
[17:26.480 --> 17:30.640]  things melt down finally it is going to be like a hydrogen bomb going off
[17:30.640 --> 17:39.800]  politically 101 million people of 325 million on food assistance and the great
[17:39.800 --> 17:43.360]  depression they had like five million people in soup lines at one time we got
[17:43.360 --> 17:48.920]  101 million people in digital soup lines and it's all been designed and not just
[17:48.920 --> 17:53.240]  our opinion that dependency has been designed the globalist are on record
[17:53.240 --> 17:59.800]  admitting they're trying to domesticate us and get us into this position so what
[17:59.800 --> 18:06.840]  we need to get down to here at the final equation is we're in deep you know
[18:06.840 --> 18:12.000]  what and I for one have tried to make preparations individually for it but I've
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.720]  also tried to alert and warn others so we can try to do something about this
[18:15.720 --> 18:22.200]  because it's it's it's off the charts and it's worldwide it's a worldwide

[24:29.240 --> 24:39.160]  stunts because once you understand their paradigm their system their logic then
[24:39.160 --> 24:45.160]  it all makes sense and it was senator Rodney Ellis I come into town go to a
[24:45.160 --> 24:51.920]  gym close to the office the legislature is in session I routinely see state
[24:51.920 --> 24:58.160]  reps in there but senator Rodney Ellis was in there and he comes in and taps on
[24:58.160 --> 25:05.440]  my shoulder and says hi and I've run into him a couple times before downtown and
[25:05.440 --> 25:15.640]  he had representative Martinez with him and for some reason when it shows
[25:15.640 --> 25:20.880]  representative Martinez bio on the house representatives it doesn't show his first
[25:20.880 --> 25:28.920]  name what is it I need that info please the point is is that I can't get away
[25:28.920 --> 25:33.240]  from this stuff and they weren't saying all this stuff to mess with me they were
[25:33.240 --> 25:37.960]  having a real discussion because the only ellipticals open were right beside me
[25:37.960 --> 25:41.240]  and then the others were full and the treadmills were full so the only two
[25:41.240 --> 25:47.080]  full ones are right here I'm sitting there listening to music it's Trey and
[25:47.080 --> 25:51.680]  representative Trey Martinez and powerful state senator he's on a bunch of
[25:51.680 --> 25:56.240]  committees and cares the UT main law school and the rest of it senator Rodney
[25:56.240 --> 26:04.040]  Ellis comes over and so I take my headphones off and I start listening to
[26:04.040 --> 26:08.800]  them and they don't care and they're not showing off for me these are busy guys
[26:08.800 --> 26:13.880]  while the session's in and they start talking about stratford which is this
[26:13.880 --> 26:19.680]  private CIA front based here in Austin Texas that has this doctor Friedman that
[26:19.680 --> 26:22.520]  heads it up it's been around for like 20 years and they just basically take
[26:22.520 --> 26:26.320]  Pentagon and CIA propaganda and regurgitate it back out some of its accurate
[26:26.320 --> 26:29.560]  some of it's not WikiLeaks got their stuff and it was like we got a discredit
[26:29.560 --> 26:32.800]  Alex Jones and all this stuff and the way they did that was have their operatives
[26:32.800 --> 26:36.320]  come out and say that I work for stratford that's a classic cognitive
[26:36.320 --> 26:41.440]  infiltration trick but I'm not starting a fight with these people I just want to
[26:41.440 --> 26:47.680]  try to fix the country but that said the stuff that came out in the emails is
[26:47.680 --> 26:54.240]  just a bunch of gossip and I'm sitting there it's kind of like the DPS put out
[26:54.240 --> 26:58.280]  a report in Fox News that the black widow gang is planning to kill law
[26:58.280 --> 27:02.640]  enforcement there's no motorcycle gang ever I did a Lexus Nexus search called
[27:02.640 --> 27:07.680]  the black widows except in a 1977 film and then three subsequent the last in
[27:07.680 --> 27:13.120]  1980 every which way but loose with Clint Eastwood it doesn't exist it's a
[27:13.120 --> 27:20.840]  joke and that came out of the DPS intelligence and yes who feeds DPS
[27:20.840 --> 27:27.680]  intelligence most they're baloney stratford and so I'm sitting there
[27:27.680 --> 27:32.500]  listening to these two I'm gonna come back and cover all the other news in a
[27:32.500 --> 27:35.560]  moment I'll just cover this now this is how I can't get away from this stuff so
[27:35.560 --> 27:39.920]  I'm sitting there listening to Van Halen or whatever trying to work out tap tap
[27:39.920 --> 27:47.240]  tap hey Alex hey what are you doing hey working out good job hey senator Ellis
[27:47.240 --> 27:55.400]  hey buddy how you doing so I stopped listening to music I started listening
[27:55.400 --> 28:01.840]  to the two for about 15 minutes till I got off and worked out anybody can walk
[28:01.840 --> 28:05.560]  up to them and ask them they both sitting there talking about it well yes
[28:05.560 --> 28:09.160]  stratford is advising the DPS on those issues and blah blah blah and I wasn't
[28:09.160 --> 28:12.040]  listening to all of it yeah we got a lot of big problem with people that are you
[28:12.040 --> 28:15.400]  know dead beats just suck off the system we gotta deal with that legislation
[28:15.400 --> 28:18.800]  it was like being inside a house of cards show or something you know an HBO
[28:18.800 --> 28:24.520]  or guess that's Netflix I wasn't listening to all of it and then I hear
[28:24.520 --> 28:28.480]  him going yes yes that's what the the new stratford report says that we'll be
[28:28.480 --> 28:32.360]  able to run for office in Mexico and they can run for office here and I can
[28:32.360 --> 28:36.720]  run for office in Canada and we'll be on these boards and it's those boards that
[28:36.720 --> 28:39.680]  will actually have the power so they're talking about how they're going to
[28:39.680 --> 28:43.480]  graduate not out of state-level government into federal but how they're
[28:43.480 --> 28:49.560]  going to graduate into American Union government and see that's what we've
[28:49.560 --> 28:57.120]  talked about with Lord Moncton and Nigel Farage and others from UKIP the
[28:57.120 --> 29:00.720]  founders over there in Europe you don't want to graduate out of the German
[29:00.720 --> 29:05.200]  Bundesstag the Reichstag you don't want to graduate out of the British
[29:05.200 --> 29:11.040]  Parliament the UK Parliament you want to graduate into the EU you don't leave
[29:11.040 --> 29:15.120]  local government to go to the federal government you go from local government
[29:15.120 --> 29:19.880]  or national government to global government and I'm sitting there and I
[29:19.880 --> 29:26.560]  look over at him and I go you know stratford just puts out a bunch of
[29:26.560 --> 29:30.280]  propaganda to feed the whole police state and they've gone to Bilderberg
[29:30.280 --> 29:34.840]  group meetings and all the rest of it and it all it is is the CIA engaged in
[29:34.840 --> 29:41.920]  domestic operations illegally putting out disinformation and I'll finish the
[29:41.920 --> 29:45.160]  story when we come back what they had to say to me but it's just to watch these
[29:45.160 --> 29:50.720]  state reps dancing on these strings we're on the March the Empire's on the

[30:26.440 --> 30:32.680]  the cheaper vehicular manslaughter option then Volvo changed their story and
[30:32.680 --> 30:37.840]  said it was the fault of the owner who failed to activate safety mode as we

[35:12.480 --> 35:16.680]  just Google WikiLeaks Alex Jones info or Stratford where they said they had to
[35:16.680 --> 35:23.600]  discredit us on the whole bin Laden being a staged event situation and I said
[35:23.600 --> 35:27.880]  basically you know I know that they're advising most the legislatures most of
[35:27.880 --> 35:31.120]  the state reps now they've been invited to Bilderberg because folks that they're
[35:31.120 --> 35:34.800]  getting something really special and Martinez that's on one of the committees
[35:34.800 --> 35:43.640]  with the DPS the state rep goes yeah how do you know that Stratford advises DPS
[35:43.640 --> 35:49.720]  Department of Public Safety that's very strong in Texas and I went I know I
[35:49.720 --> 35:55.320]  just told you that I know that and I go I'm not trying to brag here guys I'm
[35:55.320 --> 35:59.680]  explaining to you that this is basically an in-run federal takeover because see
[35:59.680 --> 36:05.160]  everybody gets off on getting intel or getting special information and here are
[36:05.160 --> 36:11.040]  these guys getting 50 year old information about an NAU but see now
[36:11.040 --> 36:14.200]  they're getting ready to actually do it so they're being told how great it's
[36:14.200 --> 36:18.200]  gonna be and how they're gonna have positions it's like being down in that
[36:18.200 --> 36:22.840]  meeting and they live where welcome to the human power elite the gains have
[36:22.840 --> 36:26.840]  been substantial now for the final takeover we're just I'm just sitting there
[36:26.840 --> 36:32.600]  in the meeting listening to this so that's how widespread this is Joe Kennedy
[36:32.600 --> 36:35.840]  who got out of the stock market one week before it collapsed famously said
[36:35.840 --> 36:40.240]  that he got out when a shoe shine boy was telling him what stocks to buy one
[36:40.240 --> 36:44.960]  morning and he knew that they'd hit saturation and the advice was so bad
[36:44.960 --> 36:51.120]  that he knew it was time to get out and when I can't go to the gym without just
[36:51.120 --> 36:58.920]  listening to state reps and a state senator talk about treason and the
[36:58.920 --> 37:04.760]  reason it's so effective is I don't think either one of those guys are bad and
[37:04.760 --> 37:11.880]  they don't mean bad they're just told by the establishment and by the leadership
[37:11.880 --> 37:15.600]  that this is happening and this is the way it is and they just go along with it
[37:15.600 --> 37:19.840]  and that's how America was conquered right there now let's admit we've been
[37:19.840 --> 37:23.760]  conquered so we can then set about kicking the conquering corporate force
[37:23.760 --> 37:29.040]  out because I'll be honest with you if this conquering corporate force was
[37:29.040 --> 37:33.600]  free market and was allowing people to vote and was educating them to want to
[37:33.600 --> 37:40.720]  opt into some global government as long as you had subunits firewalls to block a
[37:40.720 --> 37:44.400]  centralized dictator taking over then if the people voted for it that would be
[37:44.400 --> 37:48.760]  their issue but see it's never freedom-based is it it's always
[37:48.760 --> 37:57.120]  centralized it's always tyrannical and you've got these state senators and
[37:57.120 --> 38:02.680]  people and people on you know the state law enforcement committees and the rest
[38:02.680 --> 38:09.360]  of it and they just don't have a clue and they think they know it all and they
[38:09.360 --> 38:12.240]  weren't there saying all this to freak me out they were having serious
[38:12.240 --> 38:15.840]  conversations they were leaning over to each other and you know not talking
[38:15.840 --> 38:18.720]  under their breath and stuff about different things they were doing and
[38:18.720 --> 38:21.720]  what was going on and their body language wasn't they were doing anything
[38:21.720 --> 38:29.360]  wrong they didn't know any better and then you've got the public separately I'm
[38:29.360 --> 38:33.480]  gonna play a clip here dealing with the TPP that thinks the Trans-Pacific
[38:33.480 --> 38:40.480]  Partnership that basically let's say 20% of Congress's legislative power is
[38:40.480 --> 38:45.640]  still exercised properly and there's still some vestigial remnant of the old
[38:45.640 --> 38:51.280]  republic this erodes another 15% of what's left we're down to 5% this all
[38:51.280 --> 38:55.760]  goes through now the Congress could always use its bully pulpit and its
[38:55.760 --> 39:02.160]  legitimate constitutional role to stand up and say no but these are all
[39:02.160 --> 39:07.200]  predominantly agents of the globalist takeover so they're part of the crew
[39:07.200 --> 39:11.600]  they're gonna graduate to corporate boards and the global boards they get to
[39:11.600 --> 39:15.760]  go to Davos they get to go to Bilderberg they get to get led into the
[39:15.760 --> 39:21.520]  inside business deals so why should they care especially when the public wants
[39:21.520 --> 39:25.200]  to talk about Kim Kardashian all day
[39:27.600 --> 39:32.040]  well know this at the end of the rat hole is the end of human free will and
[39:32.040 --> 39:37.880]  liberty as we know it let's play this video some Americans think TPP is a
[39:37.880 --> 39:42.760]  brand of toilet paper the videos up on info wars dot com hats off to the
[39:42.760 --> 39:50.200]  journalist that went and did this report and then we're going to be again
[39:50.200 --> 39:54.260]  duplicating it going and seeing what the results are here in Austin Texas I
[39:54.260 --> 39:57.200]  shouldn't say duplicating we're gonna go out and test these results ourselves
[39:57.200 --> 40:01.560]  something tells me in the trendy area the population will be just as
[40:01.560 --> 40:06.080]  helpless remember the history of the world is weaklings and ignorant people
[40:06.080 --> 40:12.680]  being usurped and dominated the world has been wolves and sheep the Republic and
[40:12.680 --> 40:18.080]  the Renaissance is about sheep dogs the problem is when the sheep dogs defeat
[40:18.080 --> 40:23.160]  the wolves the sheep take over and begin hating the sheep dogs because the sheep
[40:23.160 --> 40:27.640]  dogs are warning them about basics they then join with the wolves to hunt down
[40:27.640 --> 40:34.160]  the sheep dogs so that they can be ripped to pieces with pleasure because it's
[40:34.160 --> 40:38.360]  kind of trendy and sexy to sell out to the wolves the wolves have such big eyes
[40:38.360 --> 40:43.160]  and such big teeth all the better to see you with my dear all better to eat you
[40:43.160 --> 40:48.840]  with my dear they have a servile death wish that only those who've never been
[40:48.840 --> 40:53.760]  through hard times have because once they answer in the jaws of the wolf they
[40:53.760 --> 40:59.920]  will beg for mercy let's go to this clip of the victims the the the on their
[40:59.920 --> 41:07.080]  knees servile mindless idiots that inhabit New York City do you know what
[41:07.080 --> 41:11.520]  the TPP is no how about you I did not you've never heard of it no never heard
[41:11.520 --> 41:17.040]  of them what is TPP I don't even know what's that I don't know what TPP what's
[41:17.040 --> 41:25.960]  TPP toilet paper why not you down with it no you down with TPP what is that it's
[41:25.960 --> 41:29.600]  like OPP except the corporations are screwing everyone are you down with
[41:29.600 --> 41:36.080]  it no really you guys trying to get me a trolley why I work for Fox News if you
[41:36.080 --> 41:39.720]  work for Fox News you should know what the TPP is well you know I work there
[41:39.720 --> 41:43.280]  but that doesn't necessarily mean I keep up with it it's the Trans Pacific
[41:43.280 --> 41:49.640]  partnership bring any bells now no no still nothing sorry have you heard of
[41:49.640 --> 41:56.360]  it no go to your meeting I don't know what TPP is
[41:56.360 --> 42:04.600]  does anyone in Times Square know what the TPP is anyone does anyone know what
[42:04.600 --> 42:10.640]  the TPP is I want Rex to do that too that's trying to figure out if anyone
[42:10.640 --> 42:18.320]  knows what it is no one knows what it is we don't read the full report is on
[42:18.320 --> 42:24.120]  info wars dot com and I want my son to do the exact same thing and of course
[42:24.120 --> 42:27.960]  imitation is the greatest form of flattery that's exactly what I did in my
[42:27.960 --> 42:34.640]  film 18 years ago America destroyed by design I went to the Grand Canyon with
[42:34.640 --> 42:39.600]  the treaty handing it over to the UN and surrounding areas as collateral and
[42:39.600 --> 42:44.480]  said does anyone know what these executive orders are or the UN signs 200
[42:44.480 --> 42:49.000]  yards from here do you know about UNESCO and World Heritage sites do you know
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.680]  what it means and they all do the same thing so I want to just duplicate that
[42:53.680 --> 43:01.960]  report it's common sense we need to see if Austinites know anything and we'll
[43:01.960 --> 43:06.920]  have that report for you either by Sunday or by Monday but that is in the
[43:06.920 --> 43:14.920]  know that's RT so good job there coming up we're gonna go ahead and get Joe
[43:14.920 --> 43:19.600]  Biggs on the line right now he's planning a demonstration against the
[43:19.600 --> 43:24.880]  globalist rat Al the rat Sharpton coming up tomorrow I hope you join him for that
[43:24.880 --> 43:30.040]  as he goes in there trying to stir up more discordia there in Cleveland and
[43:30.040 --> 43:35.600]  the dozens and dozens that have been killed the last week as a law and order
[43:35.600 --> 43:40.800]  melts down in Baltimore the Democrat black city of course it's my fault because
[43:40.800 --> 43:45.360]  I'm white of course but the issue here is this is about divide and conquer and
[43:45.360 --> 43:50.040]  globalists are making their move for a summer of destabilization big time and
[43:50.040 --> 43:54.760]  then coming up Obama administration asserts domination over Creek streams
[43:54.760 --> 43:59.240]  wetlands ditches and even big puddles and that dovetails the very important
[43:59.240 --> 44:02.560]  report emergency powers give Barack Obama authority over just about
[44:02.560 --> 44:05.640]  everything during a major national crisis we're gonna let you know about
[44:05.640 --> 44:10.640]  those PDDs and executive orders Obama phoned fight pivots to internet as they
[44:10.640 --> 44:14.400]  prepare to re-up that but don't worry Hillary Clinton says that she's
[44:14.400 --> 44:19.360]  pledging to bring back faith in government and and and no more corruption
[44:19.360 --> 44:28.280]  and Bathomet promises to defeat Satan and Beelzebub and the horned God and the
[44:28.280 --> 44:33.880]  old serpent Rand Paul in Chicago says crime not a racial thing it's a
[44:33.880 --> 44:38.960]  spiritual problem I agree with him continuing robotics ethics of
[44:38.960 --> 44:42.200]  artificial intelligence we're gonna go over that Pentagon inadvertently ships
[44:42.200 --> 44:46.320]  live anthrax the labs in nine states well at least it wasn't like when they
[44:46.320 --> 44:51.560]  mailed it out to people after 9-11 that was Pentagon anthrax EU asked member
[44:51.560 --> 44:58.280]  states to admit 40,000 asylum seekers that's just the beginning a call to
[44:58.280 --> 45:02.240]  action protest the race baiter Al Sharpton this Friday that videos on
[45:02.240 --> 45:08.440]  info wars.com senator Marco Rubio says gay agendas next step is to define
[45:08.440 --> 45:15.880]  mainstream Christianity as hate speech I love how they tell us something after
[45:15.880 --> 45:20.280]  it's already happening and that ties into court bans choose life license plate
[45:20.280 --> 45:26.080]  as patently offensive and you see it's a smiley face saying choose life that is
[45:26.080 --> 45:30.000]  so offensive this is the totalitarian so you can have whatever else you want
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.600]  it's nothing Christian and that ties in of course with the Marine the Christian
[45:34.600 --> 45:39.120]  who on her own computer had no weapon formed against me will prosper one of
[45:39.120 --> 45:45.080]  our favorite quotes here that'd be a great quote for the US military but no
[45:45.080 --> 45:49.560]  she was ordered to take it down and basically we're down to her faith and
[45:49.560 --> 45:53.840]  of course you've heard that they've told them the court marshal you at Fort
[45:53.840 --> 45:58.000]  Bragg if you're even part of the evangelical church or at Fort Hood as
[45:58.000 --> 46:03.040]  well so this is the total Soviet level tyranny and she was court marshal
[46:03.040 --> 46:10.560]  successfully so that's what's going on now if you want to wear Wiccan necklaces
[46:10.560 --> 46:13.640]  or satanic necklaces and that's your free speech you're allowed to at Fort Hood
[46:13.640 --> 46:19.040]  or Fort Bragg but you do not wear a cross now either it's offensive and see
[46:19.040 --> 46:23.600]  that's free speech if someone's offended you can't have it if it's classical if
[46:23.600 --> 46:30.360]  it's Americana if it's stable it isn't be tolerant of our lifestyle be tolerant
[46:30.360 --> 46:36.120]  of our love of Beelzebub now it's Beelzebub says you can't have a Christian
[46:36.120 --> 46:44.200]  religion a bunch of economic news we're gonna be going over massive levels of
[46:44.200 --> 46:51.760]  illegals pouring across it's all coming up today we have Fritz Springmeyer who
[46:51.760 --> 46:56.600]  wrote bloodlines of the Illuminati that was out of print so we helped him
[46:56.600 --> 47:03.840]  reprint it I was kind of insulted that at the body double by the military base
[47:03.840 --> 47:12.760]  they killed that staged event zero made up dark 30 zero fairy tale 30 that the
[47:12.760 --> 47:16.720]  no info wars dot com publications were in there but Fritz Springmeyer was
[47:16.720 --> 47:20.560]  listed that bin Laden was supposedly reading this along with a bunch of other
[47:20.560 --> 47:27.120]  anti-new order publications and including books about 9-11 being staged so
[47:27.120 --> 47:29.480]  we're going to talk about bloodlines of the Illuminati that you can get it in
[47:29.480 --> 47:34.760]  four store dot com it's an amazing book I used to think it was pure bull I read
[47:34.760 --> 47:39.080]  it 15 16 years ago until so much of it later came out but Fritz Springmeyer will
[47:39.080 --> 47:43.200]  be joining us we have Joel Scousen joining us a World Affairs brief on all
[47:43.200 --> 47:46.960]  the World War three talk by mainstream analyst all that is coming up and more
[47:46.960 --> 47:51.960]  but first Joe Biggs joins us from Cleveland where he's been covering the
[47:51.960 --> 47:55.400]  aftermath of one verdict now another verdict is about to come out now every
[47:55.400 --> 48:00.040]  verdict on the police shooting is a referendum for for rioting I guess and
[48:00.040 --> 48:04.160]  he wants to go out and protest loving Al Sharpton and an event tomorrow so we
[48:04.160 --> 48:07.480]  can certainly draw some attention to this rat she's a joint Joe Biggs in
[48:07.480 --> 48:12.080]  Cleveland tomorrow Joe tell us about that event and then tell us what else you've
[48:12.080 --> 48:17.840]  been monitoring and noticing there yes tomorrow night at 7 30 p.m. at the
[48:17.840 --> 48:22.040]  Olivet Institutional Baptist Church Al Sharpton will be delivering the keynote
[48:22.040 --> 48:27.400]  address it'll be at 7 30 p.m. so I want to encourage everyone out in the
[48:27.400 --> 48:31.240]  Cleveland area the surrounding areas to get off their butt come out and protest
[48:31.240 --> 48:37.440]  this guy because right now Cleveland has handled this Breelo verdict so well
[48:37.440 --> 48:43.400]  thus far and now we have the Samir Rice verdict possibly coming out any day now
[48:43.400 --> 48:47.160]  now we know that they released the Breelo verdict last Saturday it could
[48:47.160 --> 48:50.960]  happen again this Saturday who knows but Cleveland has done everything the
[48:50.960 --> 48:56.200]  right way they should be a you know a guide for other cities to handle these
[48:56.200 --> 48:59.680]  things the right way and now you've got Al Sharpton want to come out here and
[48:59.680 --> 49:05.000]  start race bathing and stirring up racial division in a town that's been doing so
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.840]  well they haven't been like Baltimore they haven't been like Ferguson and
[49:07.840 --> 49:11.680]  that's what pisses me off to know that this guy's gonna come out here and try
[49:11.680 --> 49:14.600]  to I guess I guess that's how he's gonna pay back his money to the
[49:14.600 --> 49:18.480]  government all those millions he owes him back taxes to go and deliver these
[49:18.480 --> 49:23.640]  speeches and help stir up more crap and of course call for federalizing police
[49:23.640 --> 49:29.360]  what do you make of Baltimore descending into what has been called anarchy now as
[49:29.360 --> 49:35.720]  the police get surrounded responding to calls I mean it's sad to say that it's
[49:35.720 --> 49:39.520]  getting to that point I mean when I was there the certain parts that I was in
[49:39.520 --> 49:44.600]  Iraq was kept up more I mean the roads in Baltimore horrible I mean the buildings
[49:44.600 --> 49:48.400]  are run down I mean it looks kind of like Detroit in some areas it's a very
[49:48.400 --> 49:54.560]  bad area and it's prime pickings for these these type of events but right
[49:54.560 --> 49:59.840]  next door in DC they're living in total opulence with America's daughters and
[49:59.840 --> 50:05.560]  sons servicing them Joe again tell folks what time tomorrow the rat the literal
[50:05.560 --> 50:10.480]  rat Al Sharpton's gonna be showing up yeah the rate of the rat race baiter will

[50:22.520 --> 50:27.040]  are the guys who are inviting him to come in and deliver a speech that they're
[50:27.040 --> 50:31.240]  gonna call a rally and you know hopefully they he doesn't try to stir up
[50:31.240 --> 50:34.400]  anything but we're gonna be out there to call him out I'm gonna ask him some
[50:34.400 --> 50:37.920]  questions I'm gonna ask him you know if the apple does fall far from the tree or
[50:37.920 --> 50:41.640]  doesn't fall far from the tree because you know his daughter is now involved in

[54:06.320 --> 54:10.160]  there's a war on for your mind
[54:12.600 --> 54:19.840]  before I get into Obama's latest giant dictatorial outside of the law power grab
[54:19.840 --> 54:27.240]  and the latest on the Clinton scandal but their criminal foundation I want to
[54:27.240 --> 54:31.640]  just briefly mention that we've had to expand the order for the shirts that
[54:31.640 --> 54:38.040]  will be getting here next week printed right here in the USA the save America
[54:38.040 --> 54:45.920]  flyer flag upside-down shirt very very popular it's a limited edition I had the
[54:45.920 --> 54:55.000]  idea when PacSun clothing company did an upside-down flag for leftist that I do
[54:55.000 --> 55:01.560]  think was basically seen as kind of a down with America design I can't say
[55:01.560 --> 55:06.320]  that for sure but that's how it was received ours says save America on top
[55:06.320 --> 55:11.200]  with an upside-down flag with the US code that by law you're supposed to fly
[55:11.200 --> 55:15.080]  it upside down when the country is in peril and boy that it in peril now I
[55:15.080 --> 55:19.360]  mean it's it's been basically dismantled already we're just trying to keep the
[55:19.360 --> 55:23.680]  pieces together to hopefully put it back together I mean to use a cheesy analogy
[55:23.680 --> 55:28.920]  it's like Optimus Prime or something cut up in a hundred pieces you want to keep
[55:28.920 --> 55:33.280]  the pieces to put it back together or C-3PO or something blown into pieces
[55:33.280 --> 55:40.000]  riding around on Chewbacca's back I mean the country is just blown to pieces so
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.720]  probably the flag upside down with bullet holes in it or something maybe
[55:43.720 --> 55:48.920]  that'll be the next design but or what's on the front page of info wars.com a
[55:48.920 --> 55:55.760]  communist eraser erasing the flag I mean that's what's happening by every yard
[55:55.760 --> 56:02.280]  stick so if you want the shirt it's going to be in the last half of this year
[56:02.280 --> 56:06.760]  and I'll never produce it again it is a limited edition we do that sometimes with
[56:06.760 --> 56:09.880]  shirts that I know are gonna be bestsellers it helps find our operation

[57:26.880 --> 57:33.600]  Joel Scousen and I'm gonna get first into Obama's power grab and what's being
[57:33.600 --> 57:40.120]  submitted right now on the TPP and yet the world affairs brief editors really
[57:40.120 --> 57:46.800]  expert take on that and then we're going to expand out into the over the top war
[57:46.800 --> 57:53.840]  rhetoric in the Ukraine with the situation the South China Sea and more
[57:53.840 --> 58:00.960]  it is really getting serious right now so that is all coming up we're also gonna
[58:00.960 --> 58:05.880]  look at dollarization as the dollars devalued that forces other currencies
[58:05.880 --> 58:09.960]  to rush back into the dollar not because it's strong but because it's weak
[58:09.960 --> 58:13.560]  because they're basically based in dollars even if they have their own
[58:13.560 --> 58:17.920]  currency so it's it's part of holding the world hostage is what the private
[58:17.920 --> 58:22.560]  Federal Reserve is doing worldwide how long can this go on Joel Scousen thinks
[58:22.560 --> 58:27.080]  five to ten years a lot of folks think only a couple more but government is
[58:27.080 --> 58:32.160]  certainly making preparations right now this is all coming up in the second
[58:32.160 --> 58:36.560]  hour you found at the tip of the spear in the battle for the Republic
[58:36.560 --> 58:47.360]  worldwide 1776 you are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today
[58:48.360 --> 58:52.480]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and
[58:52.480 --> 58:56.120]  sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website
[58:56.120 --> 59:01.280]  info wars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest
[59:01.280 --> 59:06.160]  quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably 30
[59:06.160 --> 59:10.920]  40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we get
[59:10.920 --> 59:16.400]  contacted by head down firearms HD firearms.com own and run by a bunch of
[59:16.400 --> 59:20.240]  former Navy SEALs special ops people their veterans their patriots their
[59:20.240 --> 59:24.040]  listeners of the radio show and they want to support the broadcast it's always
[59:24.040 --> 59:27.920]  about security whether it's for yourself your wife your loved ones go to their
[59:27.920 --> 59:32.040]  website HDfirearms.com buy right off their website and they'll just send it

[59:40.280 --> 59:50.240]  firearm today the spirit of 1776 lives at head down firearms HDfirearms.com
[59:50.240 --> 59:56.200]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:11.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:19.200]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.000]  Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.880]  we are at the water's edge of the argument that mainstream Christian
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.440]  teaching is hate speech because today we've reached the point in our society
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.680]  where if you if you do not support same-sex marriage you are labeled a
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.200]  homophobe and a hater so what's the next step after that after they've done
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.040]  going after individuals the next step is to argue that the teachings of mainstream
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.600]  Christianity the catechism of the Catholic Church is hate speech and that's
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:53.960]  a real and present danger and we've got a pope who is about as Marxist as it
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:01:01.640]  gets it's just a fact everybody knows I'm on a Catholic basher some of the
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.200]  most conservative libertarian people I know are Catholics fighting the New
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.000]  World Order I judge a tree by their fruits but this new pope you're not
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:16.720]  supposed to have a Jesuit as a pope I'm not Catholic but I know that and you know
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.840]  he hugs people that have diseases oh isn't he sweet the mainstream media is
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.640]  worshipping him when they've been attacking other Catholic leaders
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:29.040]  suddenly the same media that's attacking liberty is worshipping this new
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:41.240]  pope this Jesuit who sounds like he's basically Nancy Pelosi or something it's
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:47.480]  amazing the globalist are making their move right now and senator Rubio once
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.960]  open borders he says the NSA is inspiring on anybody he says all this
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:57.240]  outrageous bull but he can come out and point out what's next with the radical
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.440]  totalitarian agenda that that is basically hooked up to the gay agenda
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:07.760]  and I don't dislike any of these people and I don't need to preface that like
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.080]  they're moral authorities and I'm saying I'm not bad and begging them for
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.200]  approval I don't hate people because of their sexual preference but I don't like
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.320]  it being pushed on kids regardless of its heterosexual or homosexual that's
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:30.640]  common sense I'm against pedophilia and pedophilia cultures and there is a drive
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.280]  pushing this is the new culture in America namely because it breaks up the
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:42.080]  family and makes the state the father but rubio is only coming out with this
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:53.440]  because he doesn't have any real issues and this is a football issue he can get
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.200]  support from the Christian right but then betray them down the road this
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:02.280]  doesn't legislatively do anything it's a political football fighting over gay
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:08.920]  marriage hey listen the lesbians and gay and homosexuals everybody you want to
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:12.400]  do it heterosexuals have done so use the word homosexual on purpose because I'm
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.040]  not supposed to that's a scientific name but people are taught it's it's it's
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.600]  you know racist or whatever hateful know the word
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.840]  cockazoid is not hateful towards white people the word Negro is not hateful
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:29.960]  towards black people it's like dark Mexican beer Negro modello I've seen
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:34.120]  someone order that and not blacks but white trendies get upset by hearing
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:41.840]  Negro it's a romance language it just means dark you get dark so my favorite
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:49.600]  wine is Nero your Negro style black grapes from from Italy delicious wine
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.720]  you get the right type it's not racist that it says Negro on it I'll assure you
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:58.080]  but that's the mindlessness of this whole situation where you're not supposed
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:03.000]  to use the word homosexual but look if the homosexuals are dumb enough to want
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.080]  to let the lawyers be involved in their lives and and and and to have whoever
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:12.800]  you supposedly live with get half of your stuff or more you know whoever
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:18.000]  doesn't work get 60% you want to be involved in that screw job knock
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.960]  yourselves out there's but listen I've talked to Democratic Party lawyers they
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:28.120]  are licking their lips they can't wait to watch you give all your campaign money
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:35.040]  so that you can be under government with your marriage boy talk about wanting
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:42.120]  to get thrown in the fiery furnace that is ridiculous so there you go and it
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:46.240]  look this whole gay thing from both sides is a political football but these
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.680]  reps and congressmen that are always bashing gays are the ones they always
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:54.720]  catching you know in a bathroom with two guys you know at a gas station it just
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.520]  the whole things a joke we'll be back
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:03.000]  a hearing schedule for today will focus on whether two chimpanzees held by
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.120]  stony brook University are property of the university or must be set free
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.880]  champions of the concept of speciism like Peter Singer argue that the chimps
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.840]  should have human rights because they are quote comparable to three-year-old
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.040]  humans and their capacity for self-awareness unquote the problem is
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:24.840]  singer has argued that downs syndrome children should be euthanized because
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:29.160]  quote they will never be able to play the guitar or develop an appreciation of
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:32.880]  science fiction learn a foreign language or chat with us about the latest
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:38.160]  Woody Allen movie unquote singers speciism is not about elevating animal
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.840]  treatment it's about creating a justification for devaluing human life
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:47.760]  in all conditions at all ages we will not allow scientific elitists and
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:54.400]  eugenicists like Peter Singer to deny human liberty and dignity this is David

[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:09.080]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:30.920]  I don't hate people that are drug addicts I don't hate people that are
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:39.320]  quote gay I don't hate people that have a gambling problem but you can definitely
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:46.560]  look at the statistics of all the things I just mentioned and know that those
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:52.560]  are destructive lifestyles so the larger question is why is this agenda being
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:58.000]  pushed and it's what Joel Scowles in the editor of World Affairs brief always
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.440]  talks about the global social engineers do not want you to be able to
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:08.080]  discriminate and by discriminate when you're driving down the road there is a
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:16.600]  dotted line stripes and reflectors down the middle so you can discriminate which
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:21.880]  lane you're in so you don't go into oncoming traffic vision helps you
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:28.400]  discriminate taste tells you what is good food or good water smell and they've
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.920]  moved from political correctness saying don't say racist things and group guilt
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:39.720]  to now brown paper bags are banned in the city of Seattle state government city
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:46.000]  government because brown might hurt someone's feelings no one ever said a
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  brown bag was connected to race no one ever said that it was racist it
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.760]  doesn't matter it's about banning whatever they want whenever they want and
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:10:00.560]  restricting speech and now senator Rubio has come out and said gay agendas next
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:05.200]  step is to define mainstream Christianity as hate speech well Europe's
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:10.880]  already done that but see Rubio needs some red meat he can talk about while not
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:16.560]  actually defending marriage and now we have the headlines court bans choose
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:21.920]  life license plate as patently offensive in shocking ruling if you go to the
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.560]  story it's just a little normal license plate saying I choose life just saying
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:37.000]  I'll choose life is offensive the appeals court in New York agreed and said
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.160]  it's banned the second circuit court of appeals in Manhattan ruled choose life
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:46.720]  license plates are patently offensive you can put on there that you're a slut
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:51.120]  you can put the word cocaine on there this has been in court but you will not
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:58.560]  say adopt babies you will not say your pro life this is the tyranny like the
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.200]  woman that got attention a few days ago court marshaled in the Marines because
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:07.200]  on her computer screensaver it said no weapon formed against me shall prosper
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:14.200]  be a great slogan for the US military but no it's banned I have another report
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:18.720]  here the new Jurassic Park movie is being criticized because it has a male
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:24.120]  hero I'm not kidding every other movie Hollywood admits they have a directive
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:29.160]  has women as the heroes and men is bad the new Mad Max fury road is really
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:34.600]  feminist road where all the men are killed at the end to create a utopia this
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:39.320]  isn't to empower women it's to make women be all alone families destroyed this
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.640]  is a scientific takedown plan just like Cloward and Piven wants to bankrupt our
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:49.880]  economy to make us domesticated Joel Scowze will be with us till five minutes
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:54.160]  into the next hour world affairs brief calm one of the smartest people when it
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.640]  comes to global analysis because I do a lot of research so I can tell what somebody
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.640]  knows what they're talking about he's taught me a lot we all teach each other
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.000]  I want to get his take on this first on some other waterfront issues that he
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.360]  didn't even know I was going to bring up then at the bottom of the hour we will
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:12.880]  detail geopolitically the headlines NATO general says we may have World War
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.000]  3 the NSA analyst we may have World War 3 George Sorrelson we may have World War
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.040]  3 what's really behind the sandcastles in the South China Sea the bases are
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:29.080]  building what's behind all this we're going to be breaking it down today but
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:35.000]  first about a month ago I said you know I don't want to just air ads on the
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.960]  radio here especially on the internet side that's the podcast and the millions
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.680]  the tune in via the streams and other systems I want to start having our great
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:50.920]  reporters do one minute info wars bulletins vignettes and boy they've
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:55.600]  taken to it like a fish to water new reports every day I'm going to create an
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:00.520]  archive on info wars.com so stations can just grab these and air these whenever
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:04.240]  they'd like as well and put their own tags on them if they wish we're going
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:08.920]  to also start providing it to folks that want to put video to it on YouTube by
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.680]  next week we're gonna have a page where when they upload these they're there for
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:16.560]  you or you just record the stream and do it yourself don't wait for us just take
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:21.440]  action you may wait for the rest of your life we're trying as hard as we can but
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:27.120]  we need the funding to get the crew to build up and expand our reach everything
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:31.840]  we do is a success by the grace of God all the glory goes to God Lord knows my
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:39.120]  best works are dirty rags as the Bible says but everything we're doing is
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:43.520]  having a huge effect and that shows us as we lens up as we magnify up as we
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:50.800]  amplify we can have devastating effects on the globalist and so can you but I
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.280]  want to just air one of these reports because what I love about David Knight
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:57.760]  mother reporters is they get it they do multi-faceted reports that don't just
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:02.000]  say Peter Singer you know wants to free chimpanzees well I want to treat
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.240]  chimpanzees well as well the problem is Peter Singer is the grand poobah of
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:11.680]  PETA Peter Singer says kill kids up to age three or five this is now being pushed
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.640]  openly they only want to give animals rights just so government can say they
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:20.000]  have the votes of the animals and that they represent them as guardians to
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.640]  Trump all of our rights so that's what this animal rights movement it's about
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:29.600]  it's very very dangerous and they're going to use the extremes of factory
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:36.400]  farming and things that are abominations and bad for humans to then have a whole
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:40.480]  new revolution that's anti-human and you hear this one minute report the
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.680]  reports jacari jackson's doing and rob do and leon macadoo and just the whole
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:49.240]  crew are simply amazing and I want to encourage my writers to do these I want
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:53.480]  to encourage listeners to do one minute pieces that you email show tips at info
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:58.960]  wars.com and if they're good we'll play them here on the radio I'm here to get
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:05.200]  everybody in the fight everybody that's how we're gonna win and out of that whole
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.760]  field of people taking action we're gonna find the naturals that are gonna be
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.760]  the next wave leaders against the globalist let's go to that one minute
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:19.200]  clip and then we're going to go to Joel Scowles and here it is. A hearing schedule
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.160]  for today will focus on whether two chimpanzees held by stony brook university
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:27.960]  are property of the university or must be set free. Champions of the concept of
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:32.160]  speciism like Peter Singer argue that the chimps should have human rights
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.920]  because they are quote comparable to three-year-old humans and their
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.880]  capacity for self-awareness unquote the problem is singer has argued that
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:44.800]  Downes syndrome children should be euthanized because quote they will
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:48.560]  never be able to play the guitar or develop an appreciation of science
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.800]  fiction learn a foreign language or chat with us about the latest Woody Allen
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:58.200]  movie unquote. Singer's speciism is not about elevating animal treatment it's
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:02.040]  about creating a justification for devaluing human life in all conditions
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:07.880]  at all ages. We will not allow scientific elitists and eugenicists like
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:14.160]  Peter Singer to deny human liberty and dignity. This is David Knight reporting
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:23.080]  for Infowars.com. That 62nd piece is an education decoding the propaganda they
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.280]  set the precedent that they're the moral authority they send out you know
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:31.280]  some 20-year-old college student to scream and say I kill my babies I love
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:36.160]  Satan we're gonna ban your free speech because we're so moral as you saw last
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.920]  week or heard last week here live on the radio shutting down a pro-life
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:44.320]  demonstration we had and they were so arrogant because they're the moral
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:48.880]  authority and they talked on their website about the red tear and how they
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:55.960]  want to take us out as if they could. I don't know how you're evil but then
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:59.160]  think you're good but there is that there is that weird mindset you know the
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:02.920]  top globalists are pure evil and know it and love it but their minions believe
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:06.480]  they're good but have every manifestation from cloaking themselves in
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:11.120]  black to praising and hailing Satan to praising the death of children to the
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:15.680]  gleam in their eye and they also have the cloak of weakness on them at the
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.120]  same time it's very biblical I'm gonna skip this network break last one of the
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:23.520]  day to give Joel Scowles and more time world affairs brief.com Joel I've been
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:26.760]  ranting for 10 minutes while you've been holding but I wanted to open up with
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:31.960]  this breakdown of the assault on life the assault on judgment the assault on
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:38.560]  decency they're not truly pushing where we're tolerant it means we must give up
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:42.960]  who we are like I guess in Sodom and Gomorrah where the crowd comes to the
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.280]  door and says you know give us your kids and then you know give us those men
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.640]  that are with you that are really angels or we're gonna kill you I mean it's
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:54.680]  really about us submitting and being conquered by them isn't it Joel? It is
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:59.720]  indeed Alex I stated many years ago when I was interviewed one of the few token
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:03.760]  conservatives interviewed by a television of Washington DC on the
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.480]  Martin Luther King passage of the Civil Rights Bill and I said you know this is
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:13.080]  a very dangerous bill because it represents an intrusion into people's
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:17.860]  personal choices on their own property and of course the Supreme Court had
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:22.560]  ruled that once you offer service to the public it no longer becomes private
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:27.320]  property but public property which is a very terrible ruling. The problem that I
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.720]  see in all of these things is there's a legal principle here that's violated and
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:38.960]  that is you'd never allow in law an unlimited system of lawmaking and
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:44.360]  that's what intrusions into discrimination do it has to be defended
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.760]  like free speech in other words you have to defend free speech no matter if you
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:53.640]  love if you hate it if it's offensive on their own property people are free to
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:58.920]  speak their entire will and people need to be free to choose who with whom they
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:04.080]  will associate with on their own property and of course the Supreme Court
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:09.520]  has cut into what is your own property so that if anything is audible by the
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:13.200]  public it seems to become private I don't know where this is going Alex but
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:17.920]  I'll tell you it is going to attack people who they are they're not satisfied
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:24.400]  as you said with tolerance they want to destroy and silence those of us who
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:28.080]  believe that there are certain things that hold negative judgments about
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:36.120]  certain people's behavior they do fear judgment yeah judgments always been
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:40.600]  hated by socialists you know the free market runs on judgment and there's a
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:45.280]  natural propensity of human beings to dislike other people's judgment because
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:51.400]  they judge them as they are you know the free market says it really gives
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:58.440]  everyone over time rewards according to their true worth and that's to be judged
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:02.320]  by each individual and so you say well I'm being misjudged well fine go to in
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:06.360]  the next person try to get a better judgment from them you know it's a
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.920]  it's a process of negotiation in the free markets to get people to accept who
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:16.200]  you really are but if everybody's you know got a negative judgment you ought
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:21.360]  to look to yourself and say what is that judgment and is it crucial socialism
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:27.120]  offers people a higher level of reward than the free market would per true
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.800]  worth a uniform level which is a you know a denial of people's ability to
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:37.960]  judge to have to give people uniform value for differing worth I know that's
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:42.440]  a little philosophical but that's really the basis I mean I agree with you but
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:47.200]  look at how the so-called left the totalitarian left will say never judge
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:51.320]  us in fact they call it censorship if you disagree with them that's now
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:55.600]  censorship no censorship is shutting them down blocking them but then all they
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:00.520]  do is judge all day and take the moral high ground on a high horse telling us
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:06.160]  how to think I mean it's just so bankrupt indeed it is Alex it's
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:12.160]  hypocritical it's a terrible violation of our particular rights you know we
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.800]  really it's just like education and unfortunately you know conservatives
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:20.120]  have bought into this for years they've caused their own problems in public
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:25.360]  education all education should be competing because all education has
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:30.840]  values it is completely inappropriate for even the majority to impose a
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:35.960]  Christian education or an evolutionary education or any type of specific
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:41.360]  education on other people all educate people in education ought to pay for the
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:45.480]  education they have you can have public schools but only the users of those
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:49.640]  schools ought to pay for it and people ought not to be penalized for taking
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:54.480]  their dollars elsewhere so they can choose a non evolutionary education or
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.480]  they can choose to have Christian values they can choose to pray in school if
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:02.520]  they want but the the left of course wants to in the name of democracy the
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:08.040]  name of majority to actually buying people to a view and in Christians
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:12.600]  unfortunately have said you know we want Christianity in our schools and I say
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:16.640]  they're not our schools they are government schools and once you give
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:20.280]  government the power to determine values by majority rule what happens when the
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:25.160]  government becomes Marxist then the majority is Marxist or if the majority
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:29.400]  becomes Marxist then they have just as much right as you have claimed as a
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:33.560]  Christian to impose their ideology exactly that's why we do have the
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:36.800]  separation of church and state but not in the way they distort it to say a
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:41.640]  Christian can't be in school and have a Bible and say they're Christian or have
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:46.840]  it on their book bag no it means the government can't select what the state
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:52.720]  run religion is whether it be atheism Marxism fake environmentalism and
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:56.240]  notice they're now saying we have socialist health care so now we're
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.040]  gonna decide what you eat and what you do because we're all paying for each
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:05.560]  other it's a total trap it is slavery it's the same thing with the safety laws
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:10.120]  you know because the government decides to pay for indigent people who get hurt
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:14.400]  by motorcycles for example we can mandate that everybody has a motorcycle
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:18.640]  helmet because the public is being imposed upon by having to pay for
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:24.560]  uninsured people and it's a false paradigm it's an unlimited extension of
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:27.960]  law-making power once you allow government to dictate what is good for
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:33.440]  you there's virtually no limit to the ability to intrude in our lives it must
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:39.120]  be forever prohibited in law but of course you know the Constitution is
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.920]  utterly disregarded nowadays by the courts I want to get into some of the
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:47.400]  current issues with Joel Scowles in a world affairs brief one of the top
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:53.240]  privacy and security home builders best-selling author former Marine Corps
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:57.680]  fighter bomber pilot in the Vietnam era of course his uncle was Cleon Scowles and
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.160]  he just joined us the naked communist and he's headed up some of the largest
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:04.520]  true conservative constitutional organizations in the country and watch
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:09.520]  this entire de-evolution if I go back to the days of Barry Goldwater that talk
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:13.280]  just like you or the days of Ronald Reagan when he was you know a governor
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:16.160]  or running he you know he talked about the New World Order trilateral
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:21.200]  Commission this plan they then demonized it in Hollywood and movies and then
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:25.320]  made people think it didn't exist and then now we see a reemergence somewhat
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:30.640]  of an awakening because they're now actually accelerating all this and we
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.760]  see an outright demonization of the freedom movement an attempt to cause
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:40.280]  civil unrest as the pretext of federalized police we see power grabbing
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:44.120]  at an unprecedented level I agree with you that it always takes longer than
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:51.800]  what people say but at the same time this massive turning up of the heat
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:56.760]  ratcheting up a do you agree they're accelerating things and then be why do
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:00.760]  you think they're accelerating things so fast is it from a position of weakness
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:08.480]  or a position of strength well clearly they are accelerating things it's not
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:15.120]  relative to us as much as it is to as people become acclimated to accepting
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:19.400]  the new agendas put forth by the media such as non-discrimination it opens a
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.600]  floodgate and all of a sudden as I predicted clear back in the 80s on that
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:27.680]  television for I said you you banned discrimination based on race and it's
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.480]  going to be next you know based upon femininity it's going to be a weight
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:36.000]  control it's going to be based upon sexual orientation there's no limit to
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.640]  what they can start to do so the acceleration really more is the fact
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:47.800]  that there is less resistance anymore because of the dumbing down of people
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:52.400]  and boy I'll tell you it's an avalanche but they still have a long way to go and
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:26:01.480]  they fear they still fear the revolt of the people if it becomes obvious to
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:05.960]  many more people than it is right now that there really is an actual conspiracy
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:10.040]  that's why they must denigrate conspiracy because that is the key factor to
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:14.840]  waking up millions of people is to realize there's a conspiracy in the
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:20.200]  media in education in all things and that's why the media must silence all
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:25.720]  conspiracy believers and and denigrate them openly it's the key it's not
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:31.800]  elected republicans the key is explain to people exactly that it is because if
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:35.880]  you don't realize it's premeditated it's a long-term plan none of it will
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:39.000]  make sense but once you admit that you could spend the rest of your life
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.440]  reading globalist documents globalist books globalist statements the scary
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:49.880]  part is it's not even hidden but so much the public refuses to admit they're
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:54.040]  being conquered and then you add to it that we're being conquered by very
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:58.080]  wicked people I've said this hundreds of times Joel if we were being conquered
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:03.440]  by a superior culture and that and and we had a tyrannical culture I would
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:08.920]  join with it but I see the power elite locally and regionally joining with it
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:16.880]  as if they're winning when you study this it really is at its bottom destructive
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:23.240]  hateful death filled cancerous I mean how do you describe this system because
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:28.440]  as we get further into it and as I research it more you you really do come
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:33.800]  away with the fact that you're fighting pure evil I mean it really is the devil
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:38.280]  it is and I've long talked about the satanic basis for the globalist movement
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:42.440]  I mean just if you look at what I call the generational effect how does any
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.920]  single evil person start creating a system where you're going to develop
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:51.800]  over a century and a half two evil enemies like Russia and China and set
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.280]  them against the world and have an intermediate enemy like Hitler take them
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:59.080]  down one at a time and create a global new world order through war and
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:03.680]  conflict I mean there's no human being who can see that far advanced let alone
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:09.320]  project that kind of thing against his own best wishes I mean it has to be
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:14.360]  revelatory it has to be satanic at his basis just because of the long-term
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:19.680]  prognosis the long-term plan and agenda that we see just going down like clockwork
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:24.480]  fascinating they do have setbacks occasionally just like this serious
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:28.640]  situation where you know Kerry made that mistake at the London press consulate
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:33.120]  giving Syria the out to take down his chemical weapons and it set back the
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:37.840]  globalist agenda for a year and a half they had to create ISIS in response in
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:41.480]  order to have an excuse to get back in there in the process of taking down a
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:46.680]  Syria with ISIS I'm covering in the world affairs brief tomorrow for example
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.560]  how fellow fighter pilots like myself modern ones are complaining they're not
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:55.600]  allowed to attack actual people on the ground empty buildings yes in other
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:59.560]  words this whole air attack against ISIS is false the smoke screen stay there I
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:02.560]  want to come back give you the floor on that that'll lead us into geopolitical
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:06.680]  all of it how how big a deal is that the defense intelligence document came out
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:10.720]  to a judicial watch admitting three years ago that they were creating the
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:15.960]  Al Qaeda ISIS forces but when we come back first I want to get back with Joel
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:21.720]  scows and Joel scows and calm world affairs brief calm into when was it in
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:26.840]  your life when you came face-to-face in research studying it or did you have
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:31.360]  this moment like I had when you realize oh my gosh it really is true I believed
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:35.720]  it but now I know it there is a devil you study it so much you look at it you
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:40.200]  know you're now looking at Satan and it's chilling to really know it's all
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:46.200]  true it is a spiritual battle this planet is a test it's so epic stay with

[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:13.120]  CDC investigation of this mistake is underway and at the time there is no
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.960]  known risk to the general public the anthrax samples were shipped from an
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:21.480]  army facility in Utah to government and commercial labs in Texas Maryland
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:26.440]  Wisconsin Delaware New Jersey Tennessee New York California and Virginia the
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:31.120]  labs were working as part of a Pentagon effort to develop a new diagnostic test

[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:42.160]  were expected but one lab reports being able to grow live axillus anthraxus the

[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:51.240]  and their oversight around the country last June more than 80 people may have

[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:53.640]  guest we're gonna get into the al-qaeda situation the ISIS situation you can
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:58.560]  pull up mainstream news articles that finally came out thank God where defense
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.400]  intelligence admitted they funded al-qaeda groups out of Saudi Arabia and
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:09.000]  ISIS to topple Assad that's all admitted I mean we've had the Tosh plumly
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.600]  whistleblowers and people on talking about the shipments and believe me the
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:17.600]  Justice Department starts calling us and showing up when we do these interviews
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:21.400]  I mean this is real like Scowson always says you got real whistleblowers the fed
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:25.400]  show up well guess what they do the only reason we're still on air is by the grace
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.280]  of God I'm here to tell you I know we have protection and again ladies and
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:33.560]  gentlemen I grew up a Christian but you know when you're a teenager and stuff you
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:38.080]  have your doubts but always had a spiritual connection to God and had a
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:41.320]  lot of interesting experiences my life so I knew there was a spiritual realm but
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:45.600]  studying this getting deeply into it looking at it seeing how through
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:48.640]  different people and different institutions there's the mystery of
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:55.320]  evil the Bible talks about this manifestation and the globalist hurt
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:35:02.560]  their own interest so they can hurt the planet the genetic code of humans the
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:08.240]  devil is against free will if you read the Bible the devil is against free will
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:13.120]  but sells you that he's going to give you free will well no the devil just gives
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:18.960]  you knowledge I mean they had knowledge in the Garden of Eden they had knowledge
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:23.440]  they weren't idiots they had free will to eat the apple it's just they didn't
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:27.720]  have knowledge of evil thought processes for me to be able to understand evil and
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:31.440]  study it you get into the mind of it as Nietzsche said look out when you're
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:34.600]  looking to the abyss unless you become the abyss or don't dance with the devil
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:38.600]  because you can become the devil let me tell you studying this 25 years getting
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:43.680]  close to it having to get into the mindset of the system it's make sure you
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:50.000]  got a strong will that's why I get angry and upset over the years because I'm
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.600]  spiritually awake and aware doesn't mean I'm perfect I'm a worldly fleshly
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:56.720]  person like anybody else it's very upsetting though to be awake and
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:01.480]  conscious and to know the enemies they're hurting people and I'm like an
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:04.800]  animal struggling in a cage trying to get out and I want everybody else to
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:08.560]  want to struggle with me to get out because God gives us free will and all
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:11.640]  these blessings you follow God's promises I'm not trying to be a preacher
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:14.480]  because they won't preach this now they've been taken over most major
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:20.280]  churches you get blessed the problem is you get so blessed you become spoiled so
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:24.880]  it's a paradox of free will but at least my heart points towards God and
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:29.640]  justice people that revel in evil though and I see the spirit spreading good is
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:33.480]  spreading but evil is also spreading and I'm afraid to say evil is spreading
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:38.720]  faster as Joel Scousen said not even so much evil it's like the grand delusion
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.360]  is here the great delusion where the people aren't there they're in a
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:46.120]  trance Joel Scousen I'm gonna shut up now let you finish up with free will the
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.480]  whole spiritual nature because I think it's important to go to the bottom of the
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:54.520]  rabbit hole then get into ISIS al Qaeda geopolitics sorrow sing World War 3 the
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:58.320]  South China Sea I want you to move around the world in the next 25 minutes or
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:05.440]  so before we end the hour Joel Scousen well speaking of on the spiritual
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:12.600]  process I perhaps got more most of my inclination about understanding things
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:17.160]  through the promptings of conscience you know people don't give enough attention
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:20.800]  to the workings of conscience in their mind because it's actually very
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:25.720]  judgmental one of the signs of false religion is this unconditional loving
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:31.720]  God this non-judgmental it's really Satan's voice infiltrating the church
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:37.040]  when they preach those doctrines God yes he can love and it's it's actually
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:41.160]  fairly conditional even though he has an outstretched arm to people but it's
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:44.400]  very judgmental if you listen to conscience there are warning signals
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.680]  nervous feelings that you'll get when you're reading a news story telling you
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:52.160]  something's not quite right here and that's how I work through the World
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:55.200]  Affairs Brief you know I'm a small two-man shop I don't have a big staff
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:00.160]  but I can detect because of my attention to the workings of conscience when I'm
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:05.160]  reading disinformation or when there's falsehoods there and I'm not saying it's
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:09.080]  perfect you always have to struggle it's not like you're getting direct
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:12.120]  revelation but you know you get that little tap on the shoulder and says
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:16.760]  ah so you're using your world knowledge your understanding your lens and then
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:20.880]  you're putting your gut or your spirit that your discernment as the final
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:26.360]  meter that's right and what I'm saying is I think we've we're losing the battle
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:30.560]  in large part because even our conservatives are trying to work by
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:36.200]  rules rather than tap into the spiritual source that can direct us more
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:41.400]  specifically than a rulemaking approach or a generalist approach you know things
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:46.000]  are so much more complex than just restore the Constitution heck the lawyers
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.720]  don't mind if we restore the Constitution they know how to interpret it
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:52.760]  because there's hundreds of thousands of case law and so we really have to get
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:58.520]  beyond these banner type slogans and get down to real understanding of the way
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:02.760]  that human beings operate why we're being undermined and how we save our
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:07.800]  children you know Dr. Creekmore of survivalblog.com did a survey of
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:13.040]  survivalist and preppers so where do you get your news source and he was shocked
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:16.600]  because Alex Jones was down in number four position he expected these people
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:25.160]  to be very very you know up on this and guess what was first Fox News and I look
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:28.920]  back and I think how many of my clients you know that I've worked for over the
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.960]  years designing high-security residents through retreats I walk into the home and
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:35.800]  they're watching Fox News in fact they have it on all day long or Glenn Beck was
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:43.960]  number two and these are glitzy social networks with attractive talking head
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:50.640]  women and you know presenters but they'll never talk about conspiracy and
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:56.200]  not one mention in fact Fox News has Hannity and and an O'Reilly which will
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:01.120]  literally excoriate a person who even hints that he believes in conspiracy and
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:04.520]  that's supposedly from a conservative news but when it always comes out
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:09.000]  everything's a conspiracy I mean look right here Rand Paul in Chicago crime not
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:15.200]  a racial thing it's a spiritual problem but again the more and more people that
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.720]  are getting into reality understand it is a spiritual problem is that what
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:23.560]  you're saying yes it really is and it's a personal spiritual problem I mean the
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:29.160]  fact that we you know conservatives who are listening and I judge a person's
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:34.320]  astuteness not if they just come to conservative political thing but they
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.920]  should be drifting away from public education they should be drifting away
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.840]  from drugs and the standard medical protocols into more natural health
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:46.560]  things they have to be more self-disciplined they have to be eating
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:50.340]  better listening to promptings about nutrition that to me is the sign that a
[01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:54.600]  person's listening to conscience is that he starts getting all of the things
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:58.080]  that God is interested in purifying people and helping them become better
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:03.560]  and when they're a John note person only conservative but they're fat dumb and
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:07.600]  overweight and undisciplined and watching television all day some things
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:11.880]  wrong with this judgment process and if we're going to win this battle we've
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:16.160]  got to school our people to be much more attentive to the little signals of
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:21.080]  conscience the temporal signals that they disregard all the all day long well
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:25.240]  the enemy has their signals to from their side and they're certainly following
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:30.280]  their signals yes they are and they know how you know Satan is an expert at
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:35.320]  playing to people's natural proclivities the natural man and you know
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:39.520]  conscience works against the natural man and it's always after you to get you
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:43.040]  to improve to change and if you've been the same for ten years are getting worse
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:47.840]  I can tell you you're not listening to the promptings they're there and you're
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:51.960]  you're waving them off and saying I don't want to hear that and there's
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:57.160]  penalties I think in the last days when these real terrible tribulations come
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:00.520]  upon us in the world and this war descends that I've been talking about for so
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:05.480]  many years I think if people haven't learned to listen to the still small
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:09.760]  voice of conscience in the temple it wears they're going to God has been
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:13.720]  offended and they're going to be cut off from a lot of good not it in an
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:18.200]  absolute sense they just don't get the full range of signals that a person
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:22.840]  gets who's attentive and the Lord recognizes hey this person really wants
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:27.080]  truth he wants to hear my voice and therefore that's where the real
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:32.960]  blessings come from undoubtedly when we get in the quiet still place of the
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:36.480]  most high which I can't hardly stand to do because then the discernment so
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:40.000]  intense and I see what the enemy's doing that it totally freaks me out I
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.440]  understand why people run to the flesh and and and we're running to all this
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:49.960]  because reality is so much more intense than the world's fake reality that I
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:56.720]  know why people can't handle it it's but scary to realize that that true
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:03.120]  discernment is a blessing and a curse it really is yeah yeah I often said in my
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.200]  youth when I was learning to struggle with conscience because I was a pretty
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:09.800]  good violator of conscience relative to homework when I was growing up you know
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:13.320]  always being prompted to do my homework before I went out and played I was
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:17.600]  always violating it got some bad grades because of it until I learned hey this
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:21.320]  signal is here to help and when I finally really buckled down and started
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:26.520]  really listening I realized boy this God is trying to really make you better he's
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:31.080]  after you all the time and but the more you listen and the more you use
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.760]  self-control to obey the greater the blessings come the better things work
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:42.360]  out in life and I can hear to tell you at pushing almost 70 years it's a you
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:47.520]  know nobody is a success in life nobody makes good decisions about children
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:51.880]  about getting married any of those things unless they tie into that voice of
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:56.520]  the Lord that's still small voice inside your mind I want to get into geopolitics
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:01.120]  but one last question from your deep study looking at the enemy looking at
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:05.400]  the devil looking at this spiritual force that if you study our enemies they
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:08.600]  all worship it I mean they're not atheists they want us to be atheists so
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:13.160]  we're totally blind the fact this war is going on but what would the devil do if
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:17.240]  he had total power and gets his way we know that's not gonna happen I guess it
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:21.880]  happens for a day and in terms of the Bible I guess a few years or whatever
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:28.280]  but if the devil had full true power of God what makes the devil take what would
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:36.680]  Satan do you know I really actually think the second coming happens at the
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:41.880]  time when the devil does in fact have almost all power except for small
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:47.520]  enclaves of people who are true to the Lord and are being protected and I
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:52.360]  think there's going to be massive death and wars he's really not interested in
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:57.240]  elevating or even saving his own minions he's interested in destroying people
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:03.360]  he's anti-truth he hates all truth he hates God and he promises you know
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:08.040]  immunity to people I think he promises immunity to his minions against God's
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:12.280]  judgment but he can't deliver that's what Isaiah 14 is all about now he descends
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:16.640]  in chains and hell and they all all the great and powerful who he's promised
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:22.800]  immunity say art thou become low like unto us meaning his promises all these
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:28.040]  decades and centuries of coming and saving them from hell if they follow
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:33.800]  his lead come to not he doesn't have that power but I think he wants to reap as
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:37.680]  much death and destruction as he can and that's why the typical thing of the
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:42.400]  globalist is creating conflict that's a real sign that they believe in the
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:47.400]  satanic agenda well the most seductive thing about the the energy of this
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:53.920]  world is is it can give you power and energy at a certain level it's very
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:57.720]  seductive and that's how the devil's got so many good men and women basically
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:02.640]  pulling his his system but my god I just can't imagine how they can sell their
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:07.040]  children out to it or the culture to something dedicated to death all right
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.320]  shifting years you tried to get into al-qaeda these the slightest defense
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:13.920]  intelligence report they got leaked to judicial watch that really shows we've
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:18.760]  got good people inside the government we're seeing a real positive rebellion
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:22.760]  against globalist control when our military continues to say no to
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:26.760]  expanding ISIS backing so give us a breakdown on that and then the Russia
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:33.400]  situation the george sorrell situation the china situation well ISIS is still
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:37.920]  the top priority of the government because they are intent to take down
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:42.680]  Assad now this is a Western trained medical doctor who is actually quite a
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:48.520]  mild man of person he's not like the strong man that his father was and you
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:54.560]  know this Syria is going to be a basket case of civil war if they ever take down
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:58.960]  Assad which I think is inevitable probably going to happen this year the
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:05.160]  Iraqi parliament has presented evidence of video evidence of US helicopters
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:08.640]  landing in ISIS controlled areas and distributing arms and ammunition
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:14.120]  resupplying ISIS I mean that means that you've got to lie or command your
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:18.760]  helicopter pilots who are normal very patriotic people into being absolutely
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:21.680]  silence about this mission I'm sure they're telling this is a black
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:28.000]  operation this is national security top secret you're not allowed to talk about
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.640]  it ever and otherwise you're going to get a lot of whistleblowers complaining
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.800]  that they have I mean other fighter pilots as I mentioned before are starting
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:41.000]  to complain now that they're not being allowed to attack ISIS targets they're
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:46.320]  being made to wait up to an hour before the White House authorizes them above
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:58.640]  these people have scurried to another place and so when I've seen the videos of
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.400]  the various fighter bomber attacks of ISIS buildings they're only attacking
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:06.080]  empty buildings you don't see people and when they do find troops on the ground
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:11.120]  they go to permission they say stand by stand by and then they run out of fuel
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:18.680]  they've got to come back almost 50% of the Navy air attack bomber fighter
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:22.800]  bombers f-18s have to return to ship with their ordinance intact because they
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:27.680]  did not get authorization to attack ISIS targets I think at the top level
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:33.200]  they're trying to protect ISIS because they they know it's a US creation they
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:38.680]  want ISIS stronger not weaker in order to take down Assad and that's what's
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:44.560]  happened in Palmyra in Syria now Assad really has his military around the
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:48.080]  Damascus area about a third of the country is fully under his control and
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:54.480]  ISIS is slowly getting so the US is not fighting ISIS this is a lie it's a major
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:49:01.160]  big lie and you know the second reason for creating ISIS of course was to
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:07.400]  internationalize the war on terror 9-11 gave the world this reason you know yes
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:11.840]  the US can go rampaging through the world because they were attacked in 9-11
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:17.760]  and but they felt relatively immune to the process now that ISIS is coming and
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.200]  systematically beheading Christians and then taking down French journalists
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:26.400]  British journalists German journalists etc everybody's get hit by ISIS and so
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:31.560]  it's becoming an international war that's in turn creating the excuse to
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:36.800]  create a pan-Arab army that is those associated with the West Saudi Arabian
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:42.680]  Jordan Saudi Arabia launches the attack with the West then creates an army to
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:47.120]  counter its own proxy troops that just infiltrate back in and join that army
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:51.680]  and it's all done transparently but the public is came to play checkers to
[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:57.600]  understand chess and it's it's then a way to take liberties in the West in the
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:02.440]  name of countering the new ISIS threat well in Israel is very much involved in
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:07.240]  this the Mossad is a seamless relationship with the CIA they have the
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:13.920]  top Arab Israelis who have gone in and are directing I think most of the ISIS
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:19.240]  fighters I think you will find that most of the major factions you look at their
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:24.080]  leaders and they're actually an Israeli Arab agent who getting direct I mean the

[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:16.680]  population the interest is up and the US takes more immigrants from Nigeria that
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:23.720]  does from England they're creating the Tower of Babel Obama won't take the
[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:26.720]  emissive battle directly to the Supreme Court reading from Drudge they'll just
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:31.560]  simply do it by executive action Joe Scals is with us five minutes into the
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:35.400]  next hour we'll give you some of the latest headlines at info wars.com
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:42.200]  after he leaves us at eight after we were getting into Al Qaeda changing its
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:46.560]  name to ISIS to confuse the public that does show real hubris by the
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:50.880]  establishment when they got caught running the anti-sod operation funding
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:55.520]  Al Qaeda so they just changed the name but they don't even change the flags and
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:58.600]  then now they can take our liberties claiming they've got to keep us safe
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:02.480]  fighting them while turning them loose and build a pan-air of army to counter
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:09.880]  them they can have them invade African countries and send in african to respond
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:14.600]  to them the problem is the general public's ignorant but the military is
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:20.160]  not and I guess that's why we've seen this this this purge but it does seem
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:25.360]  like an over-the-top bold move Joel Scals and to to do this but they've
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:29.000]  really done it in front of everyone what do you expect to come next then let's
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.720]  get into the South China Sea situation well you know you could never do this
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:39.160]  without controlled media Alex the I mean I don't have a lot of inside access to
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:43.720]  secret things going on in government and I can see of course with my trained eye
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:49.200]  when this false flag type when they're making things up I mean as a military
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:55.760]  person for a unit the size of ISIS you know 50 60,000 people with huge weapons
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:56:00.440]  to come to pass to come to being in less than a year and our satellite
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:05.400]  technology was completely surprised that's impossible that's impossible
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:08.600]  giant columns coming in and massing I mean they would have been obliterated
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:13.040]  instantly by war dogs no they do they let them build up and that's right and
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:17.720]  after the attack on Ramadi they went and had a column of rejoicing ISIS troops
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:22.400]  who screamed out for three miles away from the city and I asked where are our
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:28.080]  US drones where are FF 50 F 18s and these are sitting ducks out there all
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:33.400]  ISIS and nobody attacked them I mean that's proof in my estimation that ISIS
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:38.640]  is a controlled terror organization just like Al Qaeda was and notice they're
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:42.360]  now retiring Al Qaeda killing all its leadership who we know we're double
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:47.480]  agents I mean who buys that the head or number two guy in Al Qaeda Adam Gadan is
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:51.680]  the grandson of the former head of the ADL I mean does anyone really buy that
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:58.040]  let me tell you where this is heading remember the Iran nuclear deal is only
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:03.560]  a stalling tactic because Israel can't attack Iran while until Syria is out of
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:09.400]  the way so the US in order to justify standing down in their attack against
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:15.760]  Iran proposed making a deal that deal is made to trap Iran they know that Iran is
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:18.680]  cheating on the agreement so that's basically they're going to sign any kind
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:23.480]  of deal and then use it to say Iran violated after Syria is taken out of
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:27.800]  the way I think sometime later this year then you're going to see Iran being
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:33.880]  ruled in violation and shortly thereafter Israel will in fact attack Iran and it
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:38.560]  will completely rearrange the Middle East it will not however rise to World
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:44.840]  War three because Russian China will not come to the aid of Iran or Syria any
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:49.200]  more than they did Iraq they have too much to gain by eavesdropping on US
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:53.600]  military operations in terms of you know they've really got to get a handle
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:58.240]  before they attack in World War three on the US jamming capabilities so that
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:03.520]  their Soviet type forces are not jammed and that's what the new SS-400 is
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:07.920]  about we're going to break it a moment I want to spend the last five minutes with
[01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:13.600]  you specifically on Soros saying be nice to China or World War three the spy
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:19.000]  planes getting threatened all of this is this just more of that build up while
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:24.240]  our government gives the reactors to China to help their nuclear submarines
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:28.640]  operate quieter you can really see them building up these enemies while getting
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:35.320]  the autonomous robot aircraft ready to go and other secret weapons we'll be back

[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:23.240]  network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:30.800]  while feminists criticize the new Jurassic Park movie because the male is a
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:33.360]  hero in it
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:39.600]  globally more derivatives are being created more wars being prepared more
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:43.920]  sellouts are accelerating Joel Scowles and finishing up the time we have for
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:49.520]  world affairs brief.com on George Soros saying be nice to China and then the
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:56.360]  latest on the Ukraine well this is a complex subject because the US is raising
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:01.760]  the the tone of their apparent opposition to China but they're doing
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:06.160]  nothing nothing is more telling than the US saying we are going to respect the
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:10.280]  12-mile limit around fiery reef cave where they're developing this runway and
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:16.640]  this you know out of a small island of sand there in in the Spratlys I mean
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:20.840]  telling China you're going to respect the 12-mile limit is a tacit admission of
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:26.040]  sovereignty there the the Spratly Island is a very complex situation so over 300
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:33.560]  miles it's got nearly 40 or 50 significant outcroppings in the ocean and
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:38.280]  what's interesting though is the Vietnam has occupied about eight or ten of them
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:43.080]  China's occupied about 12 of them the Philippines three or four Brunei and
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:47.080]  Malaysia have also occupied some of these I mean trying to sort out who owns the
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:51.480]  whole caboodle is is going to be a long-term process and I think the only
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:55.360]  way it's going to be sorted out is the big 800 pound girl in the room China
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:59.360]  will build up enough military bases there that basically throw the others out
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:05.680]  but I believe that China is establishing a string of Pearl strategy and that is
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:10.720]  you could have a huge mainland base like China but you've got to have a blue
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:16.000]  water Navy to conquer the world and maintain it and that means you've got
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.280]  to have a series of bases not only air bases but naval refueling and repair
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:25.560]  bases surrounding you and the natural place to do that is in the island
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:29.280]  chains sure so they're doing what the US did in the Spanish-American War
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:35.760]  establishing our empire with the civic polling stations yeah or the Britain did
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:39.280]  with putting naval bases all around the world to handle and that was one of its
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:43.280]  problems in World War two the Navy was so spread out that they couldn't respond
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:50.280]  to the German attack in time but the point that I want to make though is that
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:56.440]  China is a long way ready for a ways from attacking the West it's a blue water
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:03:02.280]  Navy is only about 50% built it's heading for 450 ships versus our sub 300
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:07.840]  warship numbers we're going down they're going up but still the earliest that
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:11.760]  China really would be confident at attacking the West is the next decade
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:18.560]  2020-21-22 or 23 and the same with Russia now Russia could attack now
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:23.920]  because it has the nuclear missiles that are ready China's just beginning now to
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:28.080]  merv their missiles are multiple independent re reentry vehicles that's
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:33.160]  what Mervs stand for in other words multiple warheads on a missile and so I
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:37.480]  don't think there's any chance despite what Soros to say despite what China's
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:42.480]  saying remember we could go to war if you do something stupid here China's
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:47.000]  always taken a hard line in terms of its reaction almost as bad as North Korea in
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.240]  terms of overreacting to any US surveillance flight and they'll continue
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:56.560]  to do so but I think it's posturing on both sides the US is posturing about
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:00.680]  standing up to China has no intention sure sure couldn't a collapse of China
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:05.400]  economically that a lot of people see happening put this back even more this
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:14.160]  big war it could I don't see a collapse of the Chinese economy any more likely
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:18.840]  than the collapse of the dollar that has been prophesied in and hyped for ever
[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:26.760]  since 2010 these are big nations big economies it's true both Arians in in
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:33.520]  slow decline because of the the worsening trade situation but nothing that I
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:39.360]  foresee indicates any kind of collapse sure it could slow slow this and I
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:43.920]  agree there's a long-term plan to harden facilities to get ready for a big war but
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:48.040]  I don't see them being there yet but the best laid plans of mice and men often go
[02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:52.680]  awry but as we said the last hour this is not just men we're fighting with here
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:57.160]  it's a very old entity that we read about in the Bible Joe Scalzen great job

[02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:34.840]  seriously wounded by the shooting it is a big idea a new order
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:44.240]  it was almost as if we were planned in force it's just pancakes either you were

[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:04.800]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in hands of
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:16.160]  soldiers not the hands of criminals for many of the police and guard troops it
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:20.440]  is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city global governance at last

[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:43.040]  dying from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones whether you believe in a
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:49.200]  physical or interdimensional entity the devil Satan the old serpent whether you
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:54.240]  don't the elite believe in it and are manifesting it on this planet I'm your
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:58.000]  host Alex Jones and a lot of people ask me Alex I've listened to your show 20
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.280]  years more and more you talk about God more and more you talk about the devil
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:09.720]  and it's because I know a lot more than I knew 20 years ago and I know that the
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:15.920]  fake establishment churches are there to discredit Christ and I'm here to tell
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:21.240]  you that Christ is my refuge I'm not one of these Pharisees up on the hill
[02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:26.640]  praying publicly telling you how great I am I don't claim to be the best person
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:29.400]  in the world I mean quite frankly compared to most people people say
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:33.080]  you're so moral you're so nice you're so friendly you're so hard-working you
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:38.800]  know still though I I can see into my own heart I know that I have issues with
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:44.840]  my conscience I'm not up here criticizing anybody I'm not judging you if
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:50.000]  you've had an abortion I'm simply saying the globalist are lying to you it is a
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:56.480]  human life it is about dehumanization it does increase your cancer risk and for
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:01.480]  God's sakes don't have a second or third term when whatever you do they're
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:05.520]  killing tens of thousands of viable babies every year there's it's not
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:13.560]  debatable and then if you go out and you protest for pro-life every time I've
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:16.400]  done it and I'm we should do it more often I hadn't done it in years we went
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:22.880]  on to the last week serpent survive kissing and saying we love Satan and
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:28.320]  then you go man this is real because it's it's not just crazies I mean there
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:31.880]  it's the same all over the country all over the world the same they could be
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:37.880]  black they could be white they could be Hispanic they could be whatever actually
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:41.200]  gotta be honest I don't think I've ever so strange anomaly I have to think about
[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:47.760]  one before I talk about it you don't see a lot of Satanist Hispanics show up
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:51.560]  talking about how they want to kill babies I'm sure they exist but that's
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:54.320]  interesting anomaly they're usually white or black I don't know what that
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:58.920]  means just in my experience that's what I've seen I guess it's a cultural thing
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:02.640]  it's too strong not to kill kids which is a good thing in that culture but it's
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:05.760]  interesting to study anthropology sociology to try to get your mind around
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:14.760]  all this but our opposition are evil totalitarians by any name you put on them
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:20.360]  as I've said union psychology you know it isn't a mass consciousness or archetype
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:27.040]  that they resonate towards I don't want to call the dark side because it's
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:33.080]  beyond the dark side it's it's just the death side all those that hate me love
[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:37.200]  death Christ said and just the more I learned the more I get deep into this
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:41.320]  and now I read the Bible didn't understand it 25 years ago it all makes
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:45.960]  sense now that's what Christ talks about he says the general population didn't
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:48.800]  hear this and they're not gonna understand what I have to say because
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:52.240]  they're not ready to hear it or they don't have a sermon or they've turned
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:56.720]  down the truth so many times when it was obvious that your brain when you do
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:01.760]  that just turns you over to lies your brain's a computer you sit there and
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:05.800]  feed lides into it enough I've had folks debate with me that Common Core is good
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:11.400]  and it teaches two plus two equals five Fritz Springmeyer joins us till five
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:14.280]  minutes the next hour I tend to always do that overdrive now just to finish up
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:18.080]  any other news at the bottom of the hour I'll get into Obama administration
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:24.080]  to search domination over creek streams wetlands ditches even big puddles and
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:27.200]  that ties into these executive orders and PDD's I want to go over with you
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:31.600]  that's presidential decision directive his book was out of print I thought it
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:36.200]  was so interesting as I read this probably I say 15 years ago I wrote this
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:42.280]  book like 18 years ago when it first came out and I just quite frankly read it
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:48.360]  and showed friends and thought it was humorous then I met Fritz Springmeyer
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:52.120]  interviewing me seem to know a lot about Bohemian Grove that I had seen that
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:56.600]  nobody else knew and then a lot of what was in his book stuff that I thought was
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:02.720]  just crazy like the royal family's the line of Count Dracula and you know and
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:05.840]  they and they've got dead babies buried all of their property and then Prince
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:09.120]  Charles comes out and says I'm the line of Dracula and I'm moving to Dracula
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:13.560]  Castle and he started our whole British royal family and we're not even
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:17.480]  British and I live in Transylvania half the year now and the media goes we
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:20.240]  tested their genetics they're Count Dracula and we dug up a bunch of dead
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:28.160]  babies on the property it's kind of like David Ike's like Jimmy Savelle is a
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:32.280]  pedophile and has dungeons where he tortures kids to death and I'm like delay
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:36.560]  that delay that this is like 14 years ago and then it all comes out 12 years
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:42.280]  later so I mean I'm just gonna be honest with you when people say wild over the
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:46.520]  top stuff and then it starts happening I really start paying attention so I said
[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:50.240]  hey I'll help you reprint this book don't say I'm the publisher of it Fritz
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:54.840]  Springmeyer is but at least info wars did show up somewhere on the fake bin
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.280]  Laden body doubles reading list that we put that New York Times reported on we
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:04.000]  put the list up there none dare call a conspiracy and stuff like that classics
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.280]  I guess to demonize the Liberty Movement but bin Laden suppose he was reading

[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:29.440]  out he's had a newer edition I read it rolled my eyes even though some of it I
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:38.320]  knew was accurate it just it's over the top it is over the top infowarstore.com

[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:40.560]  to Fritz since this came out I've talked about in six months on air about time
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:44.480]  to get Fritz bring my back on he's been a political prisoner no criminal record
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:48.280]  until they set him up for bank robberies of all things I mean they could do that
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:51.240]  to me tomorrow folks I'm gonna go over the whole case but it wasn't true
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:57.520]  obviously successful author more than 20 books in print and they just kept
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:16:59.880]  rating him and rating him and then said he was a bank robber and had a
[02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:04.200]  confidential informant say it so he's a true political prisoner as well he's got
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:10.960]  a website where you can find out more of his information pin tracks calm Fritz
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:14.600]  great to have you on with us my friend what is your take on the bin Laden
[02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:23.920]  situation what do you think about this well as you know back in May 2011 we
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:30.240]  were told that seal team six raided and shot him in the in the head at night and
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:36.080]  then dumped his body into the ocean and that there was this special extraction
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:41.560]  team that grabbed up a lot of stuff shoved it into duffel bags and they
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:46.960]  got out of there and then as you were predicting you said there this this
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:52.160]  whole thing is fishy and they're gonna kill seal team six and then in August
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:57.920]  6th as we know later that year that they're killed and just like you had been
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:05.920]  saying and so my question is in light of all this happening clear back in 2011
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:13.520]  now why in May 2014 and have they come out with this list
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:19.920]  ostensibly it was because they they had this
[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:26.000]  authorization bill by Congress saying that the director of national
[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:31.240]  intelligence had to look at all of the documents and come up with with some
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:37.680]  time kind of ruling but it's really strange why now and so in CBS contacted
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:43.640]  me about this I said why is why are they now saying this we've got Jade Helm
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:51.200]  going on we've got all of these things happening it's interesting the timing
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:57.920]  that that right at this point in time they decide to come out with my book
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:00.920]  being on the reading list we're gonna come back and find out why you think it
[02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:03.960]  is but one reason I mean obviously they want to demonize but I want to get your
[02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:08.160]  take separately it had come out with Cy Hirsch that the raid was basically fake
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:11.960]  and then more and more documents were coming out so they put all this out to
[02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:19.880]  make it look like there was something legitimate oh okay yeah there's a lot of
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:26.480]  questions about how legitimate this is and not only about the raid but what they
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:32.480]  found you know we have heard Lieutenant General Flynn supposedly was
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:38.120]  opposing the Obama administration's take on the documents that were
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:43.640]  supposedly found the Obama administration is saying it's showing that Al
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:51.880]  Cate has been defeated and we should you know be excited that we have this great
[02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:55.280]  victory sure stay there we're gonna get Fritz Springmeyer's take on this he's

[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:50.960]  author then he was a political prisoner bloodlines the Illuminati and we were
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:55.040]  getting to why does he think because look there've been a lot of rates fake it's
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:58.480]  his body double we know that from the Navy Seals I said they'll probably kill
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:02.240]  them all to cover it up they blew their helicopter up this is not fun to be this
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:07.040]  guy and have strat for the CIA saying they've got a basically discredit me and
[02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:11.160]  deal with me if the fact is like Jim Garrison said from the Kennedy deal you
[02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:15.880]  got to be so big and in the sunlight my only hope plus I'm just promoting
[02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:18.920]  freedom and liberty so there's a lot of good people in government as well but
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:21.360]  this is a dangerous situation on people to understand that
[02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:25.240]  Fritz what is what did you put in this book that made him so mad and why do you
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:30.960]  think they've now had the fake bin Laden say that he was reading your book well
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:36.480]  it's a good book and it describes who the decision makers are the important
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:41.880]  decision makers in the United States so anybody who's wanting to understand how
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:48.800]  things are operating is going to want to read the book whether that list that was
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:56.680]  published on May 21st is legitimate or not a good question because you know you
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:26:02.840]  and I we have to operate on what seems to be the most likely a story sometimes
[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:06.400]  we're given information that's fishy you know this whole thing about
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:11.960]  assassinating bin Laden was really fishy over in the Middle East people it was
[02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:16.720]  commonly known that he had died and then there was this whole thing with Tim
[02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:22.720]  Osmond as you know and Gundersen saying he took Tim Osmond around and on and on
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:29.320]  so we're just what is the truth and and if it's true that they did not
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:35.040]  assassinate Osama bin Laden then that means that all this all these book lists
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:40.800]  and everything is hype and if it's hype what's the agenda here is it to make is
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:50.000]  it to link supposed conspiracy theorists with terrorism you know John Coleman's
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:56.280]  committee of 300s in the same genre as my bloodlines of the Illuminati showing
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:27:03.400]  who decision makers are and now the committee of 300 currently from my my
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:10.200]  information that I have is has been superseded by something else but the
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:17.800]  fact remains that this this is a book showing who the decision makers have
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:26.120]  been and that would be important for anybody who was trying to have an
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:38.160]  impact on world affairs again if if what we believe is is accurate that this
[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:45.840]  raid is all a hoax then it it really begs the question why are they coming up
[02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:52.080]  with this and we're now facing this jade helm as you know which is this joint
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:57.880]  assistance for deployment and extraction where as you you know what what I'm
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:02.560]  gonna interrupt myself by saying one thing I really appreciated was you've
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:07.560]  been telling the American people that we have lost the Constitution we we are in
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:12.000]  a police state and this is what they need to recognize whether jade helm is
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:17.120]  simply an exercise in bringing in martial law or whether something will
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:23.400]  happen and it will kick into an actual operation who knows nobody has a crystal
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:29.480]  ball at this point but it's definitely an exercise to train the troops in
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:33.480]  bringing martial law into United States and it's definitely the biggest I've
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:39.080]  ever seen yeah and when you have something like this happening then you
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:45.120]  have to wonder if this book list that's trying to link some of the leading
[02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:51.120]  conspiracy historians I'm a historian by the way not a theorist you when you
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:55.400]  read that bloodlines of the Illuminati book you'll see it's just chuck full of
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:59.880]  all kinds of history genealogy charts for instance there's a genealogy chart
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:06.000]  showing how 25 American presidents are closely related this is not theory this
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.480]  is history by the way everything in your book on those areas later came out I
[02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:15.760]  mean your book did trailblaze when did you first publish bloodlines in 1995 it
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:22.080]  was interesting I believe it was like 1998 that there was a young teenage girl
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:28.920]  that put some of this genealogy together and she became a nationally acclaimed I
[02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:33.360]  remember you I first read your book like in 97 thought it and then later a girl
[02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:37.360]  figured it out and became famous absolutely it's basically your book
[02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:40.760]  yeah stay there Fritz bring my long segment coming up we're gonna get his
[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:45.320]  take on all things Illuminati stay with us

[02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:26.040]  hadn't purchased the pedestrian avoidance option that's an option did
[02:30:26.040 --> 02:30:32.040]  they go for the cheaper vehicular manslaughter option then Volvo changed
[02:30:32.040 --> 02:30:36.200]  their story and said it was the fault of the owner who failed to activate safety

[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:11.200]  reading list if you really believe that I don't know what to make of this I was
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:17.280]  told by Navy SEAL and then separately a Navy SEAL family right after this all
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:24.960]  happened that it was fake I of course had broken 14 years ago with Dr. Pachinic
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:29.960]  high-level operative one of the founders of Delta Force that he'd already been
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:34.160]  dead he'd be rolled out on ice later the whole raid was fake it was a body
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:39.200]  double the SEALs thought that they blew up their helicopter a few months later
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:43.240]  then the families really went public some have come on the show after we of
[02:36:43.240 --> 02:36:46.880]  course had talked to him privately some of them will not come on the show but I
[02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:53.160]  mean this is not safe this is not fun I have responsibility to do this I just
[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:59.400]  hope everybody realizes this is not a game we have such credibility on this
[02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:02.760]  subject they have the central intelligence agency trying to discredit
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:07.320]  us you guys are crazy you're funding al-Qaeda to take down Assad and murder
[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:11.800]  Christians you've gone too far you're out of your minds you're shipping drugs
[02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:20.120]  into the country stop it you're nuts you're gonna stop yourselves the
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:24.520]  corruption is gonna stop it can't go on forever somebody's got to say no to you
[02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:32.120]  and where the winds and I'm nobody but you got to deal with God and you're not
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:36.200]  God even if your masters try to play like their God and there's a lot of good
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:39.760]  people in the government in every agency that know what's happening probably
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:44.160]  more awaits in the public that's one reason I'm still alive as well going back
[02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:47.440]  to Fritz Springmeyer you can also support him if you'd like let's get
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:53.920]  amazing books he's written a whole phalanx of them and you can find some of
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:58.800]  those books that are now back in print at pin tracks dot com pen tracks dot com
[02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:03.960]  Fritz Springmeyer okay Fritz I'm ranting here I want to put bookends on this
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:07.400]  bin Laden thing and to move into other areas anything else you'd like to add
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:11.560]  on that front before I throw you the curveball I always do so it's not much
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:14.760]  of a curveball what are you really focused on what do you think's
[02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:19.360]  interesting right now but one of the things that you've been hammering a law
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:25.360]  on which is important is globalism you know you repeatedly bring up about the
[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:32.600]  globalist and Americans are still off in La La Land thinking that United States
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:38.360]  has this sovereignty you know the International Organization of Securities
[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:44.160]  Commission regulates our market and there's a Basel Commission on banking
[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:51.880]  and the BIS which Bank of International Settlements these the Federal Reserve is
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:58.880]  part of BIS it regulates banking you know the International Criminal Court of
[02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:04.160]  Europe is has jurisdiction over here in the United States so the American
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:10.600]  people need to wake up that the the sovereignty of the United States is gone
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:18.760]  global government's not coming it's here exactly and this is the fact and and so
[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:23.320]  somebody asked me the other day somebody close to me they said you know is it
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:27.840]  possible for the United Nations the United States to get out of the United
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:34.080]  Nations they don't understand how so totally implying everything about United
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:39.760]  States is and when it comes to China United States is deep in debt to China
[02:39:39.760 --> 02:39:46.600]  and they named this operation this summer they called it Jade Helm some
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:52.960]  people may have been watching the news and seeing that the lunar module that
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:59.040]  that this rover that went over the surf lunar surface was called Jade Rabbit
[02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:06.480]  that gives you an indication of how how Jade represents China and I really
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:13.320]  think that the that the I think it's a strong possibility that the reason why
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:20.880]  Jade Helm is called the first word of its Jade is it's referring suddenly to
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:29.720]  China and the for instance one time there was this large exhibit a museum
[02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:36.200]  exhibit from China that was allowed to be displayed here in Portland and the
[02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:42.240]  emperors of China considered that Jade would give them immortality it was Jade
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:47.480]  gives power sure I mean it's the it's the national rock of China it's what
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:53.600]  their dynasties were obsessed with they believe it's magical exactly so when we
[02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:58.600]  when we have the the title of this exercise Jade Helm Helm being controlled
[02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:11.960]  so in some way Jade Jade Command Center Jade takeover yeah and so we we need to
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:17.720]  be aware that that United States has lost its sovereignty we have countries
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:23.440]  like China that if our economy starts collapsing they're going to be trying to
[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:30.680]  figure out how can we get our money out of extract our our debt out of America
[02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:37.000]  if we look in that China is the biggest debt holder of the US yes so if we look
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:41.800]  at the past as any kind of indication of what's gonna happen in the future after
[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:46.720]  World War one the British and French just came into Germany dismantled their
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:50.920]  factories and shipped them off to France and Britain that was the Versailles
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:59.560]  Treaty tell folks about that yeah well due to Germany having surrendered why
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:06.280]  the Allies made a very unfair treaty the Versailles Treaty where Germany had
[02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:13.320]  was was taxed to pay the entire cost of World War one and of course it put
[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:20.680]  Germany into a tailspin where children and babies in Germany were starving to
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:27.560]  death the Germany German economy was couldn't pull itself out of the the
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:34.600]  problem and that's what led to Hitler being democratically brought in is is
[02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:41.360]  Hitler saved the German people from the the tyranny of the Treaty of Versailles
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:47.840]  and so these are the kind of things that are done to manipulate world events and
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:56.200]  we likewise will see similar things in our lifetime and so the United States is
[02:42:56.200 --> 02:43:00.560]  in a precarious position just like Germany was that's a smart parallel though
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:04.800]  I mean example of the globalism how they took over Germany by the Austrian
[02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:08.320]  Hungarian Empire and broke it up in three pieces and took parts of Germany away
[02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:13.480]  like Danzig and others and get all that creating the beast and winding up Hitler
[02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:17.720]  and turning him loose what do you make about George Soros and others openly
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:23.920]  trying to get race riots going and I'm seeing him openly activate communist
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:29.320]  cells that are pouring out like roaches out of the walls for this summer do you
[02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:35.800]  think something makes plan this summer and George Soros is not just a common
[02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:41.520]  everyday person as you know he's very influential and being a student of who's
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:45.800]  studied the Illuminati he's a member of the Illuminati too so when you watch
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:52.680]  what he's doing you can see but you can see the Illuminati's agenda and you're
[02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:59.160]  you're very correct at bringing out what he's doing because this is a it shows
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:06.520]  that we've got the manipulation of events you know riots and so forth that
[02:44:06.520 --> 02:44:12.120]  we've been seeing so that the United States is slowly or maybe not so slow
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:19.400]  depending on your perspective is descending into chaos and the the things
[02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:27.880]  that protect us from totally collapsing into anarchy are being those pillars of
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:34.680]  support so to speak are being dismantled and so yeah the the American
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:40.840]  people are entering into a very precarious time and how much longer people
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:46.320]  like you and I are going to be out here with the freedom to give an alternative
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:50.560]  message is that's a good question that was my next question I just love how
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:54.280]  you're right on target with my next question we're seeing massive censorship
[02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:58.520]  hey a Marine can't you know have a Bible verse on their computer about no
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:02.720]  weapon formed against people prosper you can't have you know I'm pro-life on
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:09.200]  your on your license plate the court says it's hateful we see the left going
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:13.920]  from be tolerant of what we want to now you'll do what we say I don't even call
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:18.120]  them the left I see the internet kill switch being openly announced we told
[02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:22.880]  people about 10 years ago accelerated by Obama I see the borders being
[02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:27.920]  liquidated I see all these calls for censorship calls for us to be shut down
[02:45:27.920 --> 02:45:33.440]  on you know that I shouldn't have free speech on this week on ABC I mean let me
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:38.880]  tell you it's creepy when every major TV news show says I'm a horrible person but
[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:44.080]  won't say what I said or misrepresents and then I know used to they try to set
[02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:48.840]  me up for it and say let's attack the State Department let's blow this up and
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:52.640]  I'd say come on you're a cop you're a Fed get a camera and then you know they
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:56.160]  would get mad and run off they've kind of backed off they had me physically
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:46:00.440]  attacked and they tried to frame me quite a few times they've kind of not done
[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:03.320]  that in a wall because I never fell for any of it I know from your story I
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:06.600]  followed it in the newspapers they just kept rating you claiming you were
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:09.840]  dealing drugs you had no criminal record no drugs big Christian finally they
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:13.280]  just grabbed you have an informant with a long record of lying say you robbed a
[02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:16.880]  bank with no evidence I know they basically tortured you with what they
[02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:21.840]  fed you and stuff in prison for a decade I I really asked you know did did they
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:25.200]  warn you beforehand back off and we're gonna do this because they used to call
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:28.720]  me up you know phone would ring there'd be no number on the Colorado and they'd
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:31.800]  say we're gonna kill you or put you in jail if you don't shut up I'd say well
[02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:35.760]  do whatever you have to I can't you know I'll be part of these lies but I've been
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:40.920]  left alone so far except for dirty tricks and stuff is it because I got big
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:45.920]  enough they don't know what to do or because I like talking to you because
[02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:48.680]  you've been through the ringer I mean you're a trip political prisoner like
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:52.960]  out of the New Testament or something or what do you think about my situation
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:56.360]  because obviously I think about it a lot because I mean I'm getting let's not
[02:46:56.360 --> 02:47:02.400]  exaggerate 10 times the demonization 15 times that I ever got before and when
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:07.960]  you've got the host of ABC Nightly News the host of CBS News saying my name as
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:12.160]  if he's speaking the name of some a tell of the hun or something you know
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:15.000]  they're back all straight like they're talking I mean they're like alerting
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:20.880]  their own minions that I'm so evil that's that's really creeping me out
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:26.400]  because first they try to assassinate your name before they assassinate you
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:31.760]  right well they realize that we're at least from their perspective that we're
[02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:35.960]  all going to get our comeuppance going back to something what you said earlier
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:40.720]  the general principle is as evil always contains the seed of its own
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:47.120]  destruction so these people are on a collision course with what they're doing
[02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:53.960]  and you know they're they're looking at us as we're the ones that are going to
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:58.720]  get to come up and swear we're gonna be taken down but the truth is is they
[02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:04.640]  also are are going to be taken down because their own deeds like you were
[02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:09.200]  saying about these intelligence operatives that it's gonna collapse on
[02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:14.440]  them in fact the revolution always eats its own children so yeah as far as as
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:23.160]  what I foresee happening to you I think that that for you and I we will we're
[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:29.320]  going to be out left out here until there's a general can I say a roundup
[02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:36.680]  where where we're just included with the general arrest of people that's right
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:40.360]  we won't be targeted to elevate us in the martyrs we'll be scooped up in the
[02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:46.880]  major purge right we'll just disappear quietly some night so so we're the
[02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:54.120]  canary in the coal mine yeah growing up did you ever imagine you'd be in this
[02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:57.480]  bizarre position I mean for folks that don't know or other people that are
[02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:00.840]  jealous of you or I get a lot of attention I don't think they get this
[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:05.920]  is not fun at one level for me it's a duty I've got to do it I mean I can't
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:11.120]  just lay down to being taken over it's an instinct what is it for you well it
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:17.360]  was a calling I felt a calling from God and the original calling I received was
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:24.360]  back in 1978 and after about a year of of doing what I thought I was called to do
[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:30.920]  I actually tried to avoid it for about ten years so I had I was a little bit
[02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:37.200]  like Jonah where I saw that I needed to warn people but I backed off for ten
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:43.600]  years and then realized you know this is what I'm called to do and I just need
[02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:51.240]  to buckle down and do it and again after feel better once you just submitted
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:57.360]  to God's will and edit yes but you know after you've been in prison for eight
[02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:02.480]  years it's it's uncomfortable to come out of prison and having experienced all
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:07.840]  of that and jump right back and get back into things you did seem self-shocked
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:14.520]  at first but you're back friends yeah I say you're back about 80% I mean you
[02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:17.600]  I mean you still you have a powerful presence now but used to have a really

[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:35.040]  that's why they've ignored us up until now they're doing it ahead of something

[02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:53.360]  for info wars the evil is moving into an accelerated I use that word every hour
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:57.840]  it's super acceleration and I'll ask Fritz spring Meyer of bloodlines and
[02:54:57.840 --> 02:55:02.480]  luminati fame this question are they accelerating because they're desperate
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:05.960]  are they accelerating because they're arrogant are they accelerating because
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:09.400]  they believe enough of the public is in a trance or is it a combination of all
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:15.240]  three what is the state of the new world order right now all three they're
[02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:21.280]  arrogant they don't think that they can be knocked out of their position of
[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:25.960]  power that their power so embedded in the warp and roof of society that no
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:31.320]  matter what happens there they're going to stay in power and they also are
[02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:37.280]  jittery the fact that you look at how large scale jade helm is the flip side
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:42.440]  of that is is that actually is encouraging it shows how terrified they
[02:55:42.440 --> 02:55:49.800]  are of the real Americans the American Patriots and back when you were at West
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:54.960]  Point did you ever hear of any drills like this no no and then you have this
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:56:01.560]  West Point combatting terrorism center which what got involved for the Obama
[02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:05.240]  administration they didn't even have anything like that when I was at West
[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:12.240]  Point and and the Obama administration has taken out all references to the
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:18.200]  in the Quran of fighting jihad they've eliminated all of the references in
[02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:25.080]  their training manuals about air Islamic terrorism supposedly we have won and so
[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:29.760]  oh now they say it's the Christian in the in the veterans the enemy I mean this
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:38.000]  stuff is so over the top how do they get away with it because people are just so
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:45.040]  focused on trying to to live paycheck to paycheck that they're they're not
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:51.080]  really monitoring a sensibly what's going on but they're their lives are at
[02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:56.840]  stake we're in a situation you know prior to work just similar to prior to
[02:56:56.840 --> 02:57:04.880]  World War two when when the war broke out and you have Germany under in a
[02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:10.200]  sense martial law situation people now have lost all civil rights that's where
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:15.800]  we're at right now and people really need to start waking up pulling their
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:25.680]  head out of the sand we're we're at a very critical time point in time what
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:33.640]  do you think the next big shoe or shoes to drop are gonna be well the the the

[02:57:55.320 --> 02:58:03.240]  currency status so that is projected to happen in October if if that does
[02:58:03.240 --> 02:58:11.160]  happen in October we're going to see some major problems for for the American
[02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:18.360]  dollar and yeah China is just really pushing hard to become reserve currency
[02:58:18.360 --> 02:58:22.080]  status that's right everything's coming into place it's kind of like when you've

[03:01:30.400 --> 03:01:37.800]  movies TV the pre-programming for a war against Patriots are you concerned
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:43.960]  about false flags just like you were set up on a micro scale on the macro
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:48.400]  scale are you worried about false flags because I see that as a good move for the
[03:01:48.400 --> 03:01:52.960]  globalist they haven't done it yet domestically I think as they know there's
[03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:56.040]  so many people watching and they're worried it won't fly what do you think
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:02:03.040]  Fritz? I think that the chance of some more false flags is probably a hundred
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:11.400]  percent and I would expect that what's what I have found interesting is not
[03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:15.280]  that they have done these because I realized that they were going to do
[03:02:15.280 --> 03:02:20.560]  these clear back in the early 90s but what's been amazing is is that people
[03:02:20.560 --> 03:02:25.760]  like yourself have been calling them on it have been exposing them you know
[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:32.320]  exposing how the Boston Marathon thing was done with actors and so forth and so
[03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:40.080]  they're they're not getting by with all of this and so that's the positive side
[03:02:40.080 --> 03:02:45.080]  of it. Certainly as we got two minutes left final comments anything else you
[03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:48.560]  like to add again Fritz Springmeyer author of Bloodlines by the Illuminati
[03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:57.800]  available exclusively at infowarstore.com. People need to not fear what's
[03:02:57.800 --> 03:03:02.440]  happening in the future but be concerned enough that they do the things that's
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:07.920]  going to mitigate you know to throw your hands up and say well there's no hope
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:14.840]  or nothing that you can do is is not the correct attitude and I know on your show
[03:03:14.840 --> 03:03:20.000]  you're you're constantly telling people you know what they can do to help you
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:24.400]  know colloidal sober and some of these other things these things will go a long
[03:03:24.400 --> 03:03:29.760]  ways towards mitigating the problems that are coming and people should pay
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:37.240]  attention and continue to stay informed and not allow themselves to be paralyzed
[03:03:37.240 --> 03:03:43.960]  with fear but realize that it's just like in the Civil War one of the great
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:49.280]  lessons Ulysses Grant learned at early on in the war that the enemy was just
[03:03:49.280 --> 03:03:57.200]  afraid as much afraid of him as he was of them so keep the courage be courageous
[03:03:57.200 --> 03:03:59.280]  be of good courage people.
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:05.480]  Pintracks.com to find your other books absolutely you know I talked about
[03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:08.360]  things from my perspective and people say man why are you fair mongering why
[03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:12.360]  are you trying to scare folks see if I hear about something scary happening if
[03:04:12.360 --> 03:04:15.880]  my neighbor calls and says I just saw some guy break it in your back door I'm
[03:04:15.880 --> 03:04:18.440]  not gonna tell the neighbor how dare you try to scare me I'm gonna say thank you

[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:27.880]  and so for me I just want to know this is happening I think other people want
[03:04:27.880 --> 03:04:31.560]  to know what's happening we can't magically think here and just think if we
[03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:35.040]  out of sight out of mind ostrich with their head in the ground that it's all
[03:04:35.040 --> 03:04:39.560]  gonna go away it's not it's gonna get worse and so we're here as modern day
[03:04:39.560 --> 03:04:42.560]  Paul Revere's you the listeners are just as important as we are or more so
