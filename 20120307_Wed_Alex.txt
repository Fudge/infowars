[08:35.120 --> 08:39.760]  it gets to you because those of us that know history those of us that are
[08:39.760 --> 08:44.200]  concerned about our society and our current present position and our future
[08:44.200 --> 08:50.280]  just sit back in amazement watching government announced yeah we're spying

[09:10.960 --> 09:15.600]  confirmed reports of other military checkpoints in Austin where I live I
[09:15.600 --> 09:21.280]  don't have to cover news and other parts of the country now I can see children

[09:28.200 --> 09:32.880]  groped by the military right here where I live this this country is in so much
[09:32.880 --> 09:36.840]  trouble the globalists know we're in a depression they know they're about to
[09:36.840 --> 09:40.640]  bring us into a very deep depression and they're undoubtedly going to stage
[09:40.640 --> 09:46.600]  fake terror attacks in this country and go after political opposition and start
[09:46.600 --> 09:51.480]  shutting down talk radio free speech on the internet everything I mean these
[09:51.480 --> 09:54.160]  are criminals that will ship guns into Mexico and blame on their political
[09:54.160 --> 09:57.960]  opposition these are criminals that will give tens of billions of dollars to big
[09:57.960 --> 10:02.200]  city crime machines these are criminals that give tens of billions of dollars to
[10:02.200 --> 10:07.320]  energy companies that never even open a office some of them are just PO boxes
[10:07.320 --> 10:14.640]  for Obama to give them billions Congress admits they insider trade they get
[10:14.640 --> 10:17.640]  caught giving money to their own companies in some cases and they say
[10:17.640 --> 10:22.040]  we're allowed to do this people ask why isn't Congress going after Obama
[10:22.040 --> 10:25.640]  launching all these new wars without approval because Congress by and large
[10:25.640 --> 10:31.520]  is a bunch of knuckle dragging criminals stealing as fast as they can and as
[10:31.520 --> 10:35.320]  America is brought into the post-industrial age by design that's what
[10:35.320 --> 10:38.680]  the establishment intends is all the people inside the system getting
[10:38.680 --> 10:42.960]  getting scared as they see their own handiwork robbing and stealing and
[10:42.960 --> 10:48.120]  thieving as fast as they can grabbing everything not nailed down and then
[10:48.120 --> 10:52.800]  using crowbars to pull up what is nailed down meanwhile the citizens are
[10:52.800 --> 10:57.480]  buying millions of firearms a month firearms training is going on everywhere
[10:57.480 --> 11:02.400]  millions of people are taking tactical training every year almost everyone I
[11:02.400 --> 11:11.320]  know is building armored redoubts moving out to the country and we're in for the
[11:11.320 --> 11:15.240]  right of our lives you see because I was there and so many others were there
[11:15.240 --> 11:20.280]  for decades warning what was coming it's not going to be like the globalist
[11:20.280 --> 11:25.800]  thought it was they're going ahead with their plan with the public a large
[11:25.800 --> 11:31.720]  portion of it 30% or more who really know the full score and waking up faster
[11:31.720 --> 11:36.320]  every day more people waking up now you've got a large portion around half or
[11:36.320 --> 11:41.560]  more that are totally in La La Land and you won't be able to reach them but those
[11:41.560 --> 11:45.280]  people have never counted in history just because your neighbors suck in their
[11:45.280 --> 11:51.920]  thumb and thinks you're weird because you know things politically or or or I
[11:51.920 --> 11:55.960]  see cases of people being arrested because they'll you know they'll be
[11:55.960 --> 12:00.360]  outside town and shoot a deer with a license bring it into their suburb it's
[12:00.360 --> 12:04.000]  on the edge of the country you know pull the deer up in their backyard start
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  gutting it and animal welfare comes and arrest them because the neighbors are so
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.160]  domesticated they think somebody butchering their own food is like
[12:11.160 --> 12:15.360]  evil I've seen people at the boat dock before when I've you know gone to the
[12:15.360 --> 12:19.320]  lake to go fishing I've seen people getting off their boats going what's
[12:19.320 --> 12:22.640]  he doing what's that when they walk by and some guys got an electric knife
[12:22.640 --> 12:27.840]  cutting up catfish and stuff they've caught I mean it's you've got this cult
[12:27.840 --> 12:31.160]  of people that don't know where electricity comes from they just think
[12:31.160 --> 12:34.640]  it comes out of a plug in the wall you know the electric car people that will
[12:34.640 --> 12:38.120]  literally lecture you here in Austin it's been confirmed the so-called
[12:38.120 --> 12:42.920]  environmentalist knock out the windows and slash the tires of vehicles at
[12:42.920 --> 12:46.160]  Zilker Park if you go down to Zilker Park where they have the army guarding
[12:46.160 --> 12:50.120]  everybody but nobody stops the sandal wearing hippies and they're not really
[12:50.120 --> 12:55.680]  hippies and we're like proto trendy Nazis running around and there's just
[12:55.680 --> 12:58.800]  glass all over the ground every parking lot just everywhere glass everywhere
[12:58.800 --> 13:04.400]  keep cars being keyed tires being slashed if you're driving an SUV if you're
[13:04.400 --> 13:10.720]  driving a Hummer I mean they'll stab every tire and they will lecture you
[13:10.720 --> 13:13.800]  about you shouldn't be driving that you need to you need to get a hybrid or
[13:13.800 --> 13:18.800]  electric car and I'm like moron do you understand it takes as much energy or
[13:18.800 --> 13:24.200]  more from fossil fuel from gasoline from oil that it does from coal powered
[13:24.200 --> 13:30.720]  plants or other systems do you understand that moron but they don't care
[13:30.720 --> 13:35.840]  they don't care they don't know it's all electric cars are all a boondoggle for
[13:35.840 --> 13:41.760]  certain key industries are rip people off I'm now digressing I always do this
[13:41.760 --> 13:45.280]  because I don't know which direction to go in if it's just completely
[13:45.280 --> 13:55.040]  overwhelming that you've got a giant army of domesticated idiots that think
[13:55.040 --> 13:58.240]  when you try to warn them politically about history and what's currently
[13:58.240 --> 14:02.880]  happening and what is now admitted that the entire bill of rights and
[14:02.880 --> 14:07.240]  constitutions being overthrown giant tax increases on everybody except the
[14:07.240 --> 14:14.680]  ultra-rich being deployed just abject poverty as a political tool to bring us
[14:14.680 --> 14:19.920]  to our knees political arrest of political assassinations emergency
[14:19.920 --> 14:26.520]  FEMA camps all of it now admit it all of this now admitted and you try to talk
[14:26.520 --> 14:30.480]  to a trendy know-it-all yuppie or a liberal or a mainline Republican and
[14:30.480 --> 14:35.080]  they giggle and they smirk and they think that as long as they giggle and
[14:35.080 --> 14:38.320]  smirk they've wanted to bait or something they don't get the fact you're
[14:38.320 --> 14:41.200]  warning them it's like if you were if there's a giant wildfire coming into
[14:41.200 --> 14:45.720]  town about to burn up neighborhoods on the edge of town and there's smoke in
[14:45.720 --> 14:48.120]  the air and everything and you run up and bang on your neighbor's door and
[14:48.120 --> 14:52.520]  say listen a fire is coming and they go oh trying to be a conspiracy theorist
[14:52.520 --> 14:59.920]  all I'm trying to do is warn people and I'm staying here in this country the
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.200]  epicenter of the good and the evil where the battle is happening to my own
[15:04.200 --> 15:08.640]  great risk because I understand my forebears did this for the greater good
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.040]  of humanity and I will go down with the ship I've committed to do that but
[15:13.040 --> 15:19.320]  ladies and gentlemen it's all happening it's all unfolding it's it's fact it's
[15:19.320 --> 15:23.680]  more sickening and worse than I'd even thought it would be in its stages right
[15:23.680 --> 15:32.760]  now the globalists are dispensing with any pretense now now I want to start
[15:32.760 --> 15:36.920]  getting into the news here obviously John McCain two weeks ago said arm the
[15:36.920 --> 15:43.160]  rebels well that's now been declassified that for a year NATO the U.S. Israel and
[15:43.160 --> 15:46.960]  others have been arming the rebels and who are they they're they're Al Qaeda
[15:46.960 --> 15:53.480]  they're Wahhabis they're out of Saudi Arabia the big dogs on the block and they
[15:53.480 --> 15:57.680]  have sworn to kill the Christians and kill the minority Muslim groups the
[15:57.680 --> 16:02.840]  Shiite and then there's some kind of groups of Muslims that are really just
[16:02.840 --> 16:09.680]  Zolastres and some mystic groups they're dead they're dead they'll be lined up in
[16:09.680 --> 16:16.560]  shot they'll be raped and nothing that's what these groups do and McCain this
[16:16.560 --> 16:21.320]  monster who helped write the NDAA who says censor the internet this this
[16:21.320 --> 16:29.480]  anti-second amendment piece of unmitigated trash a ringer for Obama gets
[16:29.480 --> 16:32.800]  up and says on the rebels and remember Hillary six months ago said oh we're
[16:32.800 --> 16:35.800]  not involved we don't want to arm the rebels no they're busy telling you
[16:35.800 --> 16:40.240]  they're they're they're peaceful and they're being shot by Assad's forces I'm
[16:40.240 --> 16:44.560]  not any fan of the son of the last dictator but the fact is he brought
[16:44.560 --> 16:48.160]  stability he's been working with the West that just shows when you try to work
[16:48.160 --> 16:53.680]  with the West like Gaddafi did it's over and now Al Qaeda runs Libya Muslim
[16:53.680 --> 16:57.800]  Brotherhood Al Qaeda light runs Egypt it's many times works for the whole
[16:57.800 --> 17:01.880]  population that was the plan and they're gonna wreck Syria and they're gonna try
[17:01.880 --> 17:06.240]  to start a civil war and Iran and that's all the plan meanwhile I've got to be
[17:06.240 --> 17:09.680]  lectured all day that I've got to give up all my rights and have the National
[17:09.680 --> 17:16.440]  Guard and the State Guard on the highways of Texas now oh yes the reports are
[17:16.440 --> 17:19.800]  pouring in I mean I don't have to go to Tennessee or California now to have
[17:19.800 --> 17:23.920]  regular Marine Corps out on highways 20 miles from base with machine guns
[17:23.920 --> 17:28.720]  searching people on top their Humvees this is in the news people pull up
[17:28.720 --> 17:33.480]  there's Marines with the police searching cars looking for drunk drivers I
[17:33.480 --> 17:37.040]  mean it's illegal for the cops to be doing it and I think of our day
[17:37.040 --> 17:40.680]  so Vada laughing at me three months ago four months ago studio going Alex
[17:40.680 --> 17:44.720]  they'll never be troops on the streets of Austin it have to be the end of the
[17:44.720 --> 17:52.200]  world really it is the end of the world it's the end of the Free Republic okay
[17:52.200 --> 17:56.680]  okay I've been to the urban drills I've talked to the military I've talked to the
[17:56.680 --> 18:00.920]  police chiefs like San Antonio police chief years ago who blew the whistle on
[18:00.920 --> 18:04.680]  this first Delta Force came to him and said here's a couple hundred thousand
[18:04.680 --> 18:08.400]  dollars chief because you've told the other departments and other groups we
[18:08.400 --> 18:11.440]  can't be here running covert operations we want to work with you how about a
[18:11.440 --> 18:16.360]  couple hundred grand in cash and he he said as a Vietnam Army intelligence
[18:16.360 --> 18:21.040]  veteran he said this is completely illegal get out of my office they'll see
[18:21.040 --> 18:26.200]  other chiefs out there took the money I don't think our chief police did that
[18:26.200 --> 18:29.520]  but he obviously doesn't know where he's living because he looked at me like
[18:29.520 --> 18:35.760]  I'm funny it's funny Alex it have to be the end of the world it at the sky no
[18:35.760 --> 18:40.120]  it was quote the sky would have to be falling for there to be military on the
[18:40.120 --> 18:45.800]  streets really really is that why I've been in New York by Madison Square
[18:45.800 --> 18:51.240]  Garden and across the street you see a bunch of troops with sidearms on and I
[18:51.240 --> 18:55.280]  go get some footage of that and they say turn that bleeping camera off and run
[18:55.280 --> 19:00.080]  over and start cussing and and and and threatening to physically attack me with
[19:00.080 --> 19:03.800]  their feel their fist up and I go go ahead and do what you're gonna do what
[19:03.800 --> 19:07.960]  you're doing is illegal I've learned I've seen all this footage in New York now
[19:07.960 --> 19:10.440]  with the police the military together there's somebody act scared when they
[19:10.440 --> 19:14.320]  come over they beat them down and break their arms it's all like it's like dog
[19:14.320 --> 19:19.360]  psychology you've got to not just fake bow up to these people you've got to be
[19:19.360 --> 19:24.160]  ready you've got to be ready to be attacked by them by the way you you
[19:24.160 --> 19:30.480]  docked my teeth out break my arms that's only gonna empower people okay it to
[19:30.480 --> 19:34.440]  use a movie analogy because folks only seem to get that Darth Vader walks into
[19:34.440 --> 19:38.200]  the headquarters of the Death Star talks to the governor and he says he is here
[19:38.200 --> 19:43.520]  and he goes Obi-Wan Kenobi's not here and all of a sudden the radio beliefs and
[19:43.520 --> 19:48.960]  says we've got a break in on cell block 1138 and he says Obi-Wan is here and he
[19:48.960 --> 19:54.000]  says this is true he must not be allowed to escape Darth Vader says escape is not
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.840]  his plan I must face him alone you are gonna have to be Obi-Wan Kenobi folks
[19:58.840 --> 20:02.520]  and stand up to these people I'd seen the Ungevity products work for many
[20:02.520 --> 20:05.840]  others and so I bought a bunch of them started using them had a little bit of
[20:05.840 --> 20:10.360]  results but I wasn't following the regimen every day but Aaron Dykes in my
[20:10.360 --> 20:15.400]  office did and lost more than 60 pounds when I saw those results I said I'd
[20:15.400 --> 20:19.160]  better follow my own advice I started taking the Ungevity products and it's
[20:19.160 --> 20:25.520]  been incredible 37 pounds in two months our bodies are amazing and God gave us
[20:25.520 --> 20:29.680]  an incredible gift but if our body doesn't have the tools it needs all of

[24:57.640 --> 25:03.280]  tool on record your new lister don't laugh about TV being mind control go
[25:03.280 --> 25:09.000]  look it up it's Edward Bernays mainline science taught for 60 plus years in
[25:09.000 --> 25:15.520]  mainline college I took community college RTF and it was taught in the
[25:15.520 --> 25:21.360]  first textbook but for those that don't know information everything's a theory
[25:21.360 --> 25:24.920]  kind of like it was a theory 15 years ago when I talk about Gulf of Tonkin
[25:24.920 --> 25:30.480]  being staged no I would actually source the San Diego newspaper where the ship
[25:30.480 --> 25:34.560]  came back a few months later they said we weren't attacked it was stage it's
[25:34.560 --> 25:39.840]  now declassified that it was stage to get us into Vietnam that's just an
[25:39.840 --> 25:42.720]  example of it it's kind of like chemtrails we call them chemtrails but
[25:42.720 --> 25:49.320]  it's it's an aerosol geoengineering weather modification program Nobel Prize
[25:49.320 --> 25:55.000]  in what 1992 it was adopted by the mid 90s is testing then under patents added
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.440]  to most of the jet fuel with just a handful of companies producing most
[25:58.440 --> 26:02.720]  the kerosene jet fuel to the aerosol eyes as nuclei and the jet engines the
[26:02.720 --> 26:06.280]  White House science are first press conference admits they're doing it but
[26:06.280 --> 26:10.400]  said details are classified and I get to go on radio shows and be laughed at for
[26:10.400 --> 26:13.840]  talking about imaginary chemtrails when the White House is having press
[26:13.840 --> 26:18.560]  conferences thousands of documents about the cancer viruses and the sodium
[26:18.560 --> 26:23.800]  fluoride and the GMO to sterilize us all there but it doesn't exist because the
[26:23.800 --> 26:27.560]  average person listening just says I don't believe it or I did a search and
[26:27.560 --> 26:30.880]  didn't find it well you don't know how to use a search engine you don't know how
[26:30.880 --> 26:34.280]  to watch my films that are free online you don't know how to I mean every
[26:34.280 --> 26:39.400]  couple days our writers have got some new Rockefeller or Carnegie or UN
[26:39.400 --> 26:45.000]  Foundation about cancer viruses and population reduction and sterilence in
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.120]  the water and lithium in the water to make us passive and I mean I don't know
[26:50.120 --> 26:54.280]  what I could play at all these clips of Bill Gates saying reduced population with
[26:54.280 --> 27:00.040]  vaccines and if we do a really good job we can reduce population to zero growth
[27:00.040 --> 27:05.440]  or even lower with vaccines how's that sound everybody starts I mean I could
[27:05.440 --> 27:09.920]  play the clip again for you or I tell you what if we don't give grandma end of
[27:09.920 --> 27:13.840]  care life we are 10 teachers I know it's a death panel but all teachers are
[27:13.840 --> 27:18.960]  like the people that want to kill us are always these chicken-necked ninnies
[27:18.960 --> 27:27.240]  running around simpering armies of simpering scum you know I'm angry I
[27:27.240 --> 27:30.520]  haven't even gotten to the John McCain stuff yet I mean the war is full on just
[27:30.520 --> 27:35.720]  like Libya but they tell us it's not a war we're gonna bring peace to everybody
[27:35.720 --> 27:40.280]  we'll do that after the break I mean no here's my problem I got up at about 6
[27:40.280 --> 27:45.040]  a.m. know about 545 this morning and I went in and Paul Watson had already
[27:45.040 --> 27:51.080]  written an article at info wars.com see six hours ahead he's over in the UK
[27:51.080 --> 27:58.560]  New York prostitution ring provided minors for wealthy elitist and I just
[27:58.560 --> 28:01.680]  said please don't let it be true but Paul wrote it I know it is so and it was
[28:01.680 --> 28:05.640]  New York Post Associated Press you know all these links he had that just buried
[28:05.640 --> 28:09.840]  as a footnote was her in the recording saying well I supply children to the
[28:09.840 --> 28:14.880]  judges and top police chiefs and the politicians so you know I don't have to
[28:14.880 --> 28:18.280]  worry telling her girls don't you know the actual women that she had out front
[28:18.280 --> 28:24.680]  worrying but obviously they blackmailed the wrong person or somebody wants to
[28:24.680 --> 28:27.640]  scare everybody else it's always happens right before wars and key events as
[28:27.640 --> 28:32.880]  they'll bust a few madams so everybody knows how you could be next and she'll
[28:32.880 --> 28:38.320]  probably go the way a Palfrey though Palfrey didn't have underage people and
[28:38.320 --> 28:41.560]  then of course Paul links to all the cases of dungeons they find with little
[28:41.560 --> 28:45.040]  kids and then it turns out the you know the governors and police chiefs are
[28:45.040 --> 28:51.600]  running them and then dungeons full of women men CPS delivering them little
[28:51.600 --> 28:55.160]  kids loaded on aircraft here in the US I mean I can't even read this stuff
[28:55.160 --> 29:00.120]  anymore see I've been there I I was there when a young family we were helping as a
[29:00.120 --> 29:06.840]  CPS had visited him blonde hair blue-eyed baby he was an auto mechanic they were
[29:06.840 --> 29:10.560]  saving up money for a month living in a hotel to finally get a apartment and
[29:10.560 --> 29:14.040]  when they went to have the baby they called me the CPS was there when I
[29:14.040 --> 29:17.360]  opened the door and there's footage of a bunch of this because my handsome was
[29:17.360 --> 29:22.440]  behind me but when I opened the door they were choking and putting a piece of
[29:22.440 --> 29:25.320]  paper in front of her to sign it and of course there was that thing to defend a
[29:25.320 --> 29:29.000]  woman but it was cops they turned I saw their eyes it was like whoa these are
[29:29.000 --> 29:33.520]  actual you know pervs and I was like whoa whoa and it was hitting me hard and
[29:33.520 --> 29:38.720]  I didn't I didn't attack them and so I went outside for crying and crawling
[29:38.720 --> 29:42.800]  around on the ground and I was watching the potbelly CPS people as they took the
[29:42.800 --> 29:46.680]  baby like having a demonic vampire feast and it's just it turns my guts out I
[29:46.680 --> 29:48.840]  can't handle it I hate them I mean they're just everywhere
[29:48.840 --> 29:55.840]  ah we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:55.840 --> 30:05.000]  network a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.560]  if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research led
[30:08.560 --> 30:13.080]  me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in
[30:13.080 --> 30:16.120]  the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[30:16.120 --> 30:21.200]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that
[30:21.200 --> 30:25.840]  our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[30:25.840 --> 30:30.640]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[32:40.120 --> 32:44.080]  the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the
[32:44.080 --> 32:50.500]  silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver
[32:50.500 --> 32:55.160]  lung system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you may
[32:55.160 --> 33:11.680]  have that's www.silverlungs.com
[33:25.160 --> 33:29.600]  it's time to start kicking the globalist politically when they're up and
[33:29.600 --> 33:35.040]  kick them while they're down when they kick us with lies we slam them like a
[33:35.040 --> 33:39.760]  ton of bricks with truth crush them
[33:47.440 --> 33:52.800]  yeah they try to train us to fight with each other and to sell us at the general
[33:52.800 --> 33:58.480]  public is who's bad no it's the criminals that have gotten into government
[34:00.120 --> 34:10.400]  you know it blows me away that I had Colonel Schaefer on who ran the unit
[34:10.400 --> 34:13.920]  trying to kill bin Laden who could have killed him twice declassified on record
[34:13.920 --> 34:21.440]  CIA tried to stop publication of his book Operation Darkheart and he's on my
[34:21.440 --> 34:25.760]  show without prompting and he says the number two to number three guys some say
[34:25.760 --> 34:33.280]  number one in al-Qaeda Amaral al-Aki is a government mole working for the FBI now
[34:33.280 --> 34:37.160]  we already know that but but this is a guy who has the classified info and then
[34:37.160 --> 34:41.240]  he starts you know giving you the back story but but of course not telling you
[34:41.240 --> 34:51.480]  what he's saying is classified let me explain this again al-Qaeda is the creation
[34:51.480 --> 34:56.480]  not of America we always think well are you saying America created America is a
[34:56.480 --> 35:03.600]  corn farmer in Kansas America is a machinist in Michigan America is a school

[35:43.720 --> 35:47.840]  derivatives that we signed on to that are their dad openly announcing world

[35:52.160 --> 35:57.040]  times of London oh world government run by mega banks you pay carbon taxes to and
[35:57.040 --> 36:01.720]  and and and VAT taxes to that'll fix it we just got this idea for global
[36:01.720 --> 36:06.440]  government separately ADL Southern Provincial Law Center MSNBC Media Matters
[36:06.440 --> 36:11.240]  George Soros police manuals anybody that says banks are gonna set up a world
[36:11.240 --> 36:16.040]  government is a cop killer waiting to kill you their terrorist police watch
[36:16.040 --> 36:20.600]  out see cuz we're the ones that actually know what's going on so the bad guys
[36:20.600 --> 36:23.760]  run in the country that have hijacked it they're telling you we're the bad guys
[36:23.760 --> 36:28.880]  I mean that's two plus two equals four that's one plus one equals two I mean can
[36:28.880 --> 36:34.600]  you not see we were right can we not get an apology well I am starting to get
[36:34.600 --> 36:38.400]  apologies but it's not enough people don't laugh anymore though they say
[36:38.400 --> 36:41.720]  what are you gonna do about it well you know what I'm sure not gonna just sit
[36:41.720 --> 36:50.120]  here you know I used to wonder why don't they use monkeys to test radiation on
[36:50.120 --> 36:54.160]  it almost exact same physiology as a human you know why don't they use pigs
[36:54.160 --> 37:00.720]  for whatever reason almost exact same response to chemicals and drugs not all
[37:00.720 --> 37:04.760]  mammals are the same a dog eats chocolate it dies eats onions it dies
[37:04.760 --> 37:11.120]  humans great good for you pig can eat chocolate pig can eat onions chimpanzee
[37:11.120 --> 37:18.440]  can all day long see rats poor scenes that's pigs and apes and most monkeys
[37:18.440 --> 37:26.120]  same deal why don't why don't they test on them they test on foster children
[37:26.120 --> 37:29.360]  this is declassified tens of thousands of times this is on record what you're
[37:29.360 --> 37:34.320]  hearing just go look it up it's a hall of horrors unending for a trillion miles
[37:34.320 --> 37:41.240]  of real people real little kids one that I couldn't believe I talk about all the
[37:41.240 --> 37:45.760]  time is just one I know you can pull up and find quickly was about five years
[37:45.760 --> 37:50.080]  ago now New York Daily News and others reported it because CPS workers had souls
[37:50.080 --> 37:54.800]  they're not all pedophiles or mercenaries and said yeah we're ordered to take
[37:54.800 --> 37:58.320]  poor children mainly black because the system doesn't think well now they're
[37:58.320 --> 38:01.720]  just black people I mean it must not be true you'll let it happen it's like the
[38:01.720 --> 38:04.880]  godfather's based on true story and they're in the big mafia meeting and he
[38:04.880 --> 38:11.200]  says I don't want drugs sold your playgrounds and schools keep it in the
[38:11.200 --> 38:15.760]  colored areas their animals let them lose their souls and you got to love
[38:15.760 --> 38:21.520]  that that oxymoron their animals let them lose their souls obviously they're
[38:21.520 --> 38:27.240]  not animals they have souls and the whole movie by Mario Puzo is based on real
[38:27.240 --> 38:31.680]  people you know Frank Sinatra's names change the particular mob boss's name
[38:31.680 --> 38:36.600]  has changed it's a story about corruption in the old mob boss is like the
[38:36.600 --> 38:41.840]  women this the gambling I have my friends they will allow that but this drugs
[38:41.840 --> 38:47.880]  will destroy us they're like well let us have a compromise if Don Corleone gives
[38:47.880 --> 38:51.800]  us all the judges and police that he has in his pocket you know we will pay him
[38:51.800 --> 38:57.160]  and we will agree to keep it in the colored areas and then that's where you
[38:57.160 --> 39:01.800]  turn the police loose and then it's like all those minorities hookers drugs
[39:01.800 --> 39:05.920]  because that's where it was allowed to operate
[39:07.920 --> 39:12.600]  and then that's the culture that's sold and then you help destroy a culture and
[39:12.600 --> 39:17.400]  then you sit there and after you've cut their legs off societally economically
[39:17.400 --> 39:20.760]  spiritually and you make fun of them oh that's that's that's that's real good
[39:20.760 --> 39:26.120]  that's that that's real nice and then there's a culture of anti-white racism
[39:26.120 --> 39:31.280]  against the general bleeding heart liberals see it's a synthesis and then
[39:31.280 --> 39:33.920]  other people get mad at all the racism coming out of minority communities and
[39:33.920 --> 39:38.200]  say why are you mad at me I'm not against you and the system plays us off
[39:38.200 --> 39:42.760]  against each other it's the same thing it's always divide and conquer we're all
[39:42.760 --> 39:49.120]  under attack from this system now I'll get into the big wars I mean World War
[39:49.120 --> 39:52.960]  three has already begun the only question is will nuclear or biological or
[39:52.960 --> 39:56.880]  chemical weapons get involved and I'm gonna explain that in a moment but again
[39:56.880 --> 40:02.000]  I come across an article like this and I don't even want to read it because I
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.240]  already know almost everything in there but I start thinking about they're not
[40:07.240 --> 40:12.840]  just killing them by rape or torture I think about that New York Daily News
[40:12.840 --> 40:16.800]  article and others in a group of articles about them taking foster kids and
[40:16.800 --> 40:22.560]  testing dangerous toxic age drugs on them when they even have HIV but buried
[40:22.560 --> 40:27.440]  in there was chemical makers ordered a kid like you order some rats to your lab
[40:27.440 --> 40:32.720]  and it was describing the CPS people that went public how they would go and
[40:32.720 --> 40:36.000]  tell the black mother we'll take that two-year-old if you don't sign over the
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.920]  eight-year-old and they know how instincts are they know you okay I'll
[40:39.920 --> 40:43.320]  sign over the eight-year-old and then how they took the little black boy eight
[40:43.320 --> 40:47.120]  years old who was playing soccer and going to school having a life and how
[40:47.120 --> 40:50.800]  they started giving him the pesticides in his locked room he started trying to
[40:50.800 --> 40:54.360]  break out this with a they tied him down the last few weeks and and they they
[40:54.360 --> 41:01.040]  slowly gave him in a feeding tube down his throat the pesticide until they
[41:01.040 --> 41:07.800]  killed him now that's your government okay I mean we're talking we're talking
[41:07.800 --> 41:16.320]  it's run by absolute Jeffrey Dahmers okay that's Jeffrey Dahmer stuff and you
[41:16.320 --> 41:20.080]  know I come up to Austin cops multiple ties but I've told you the PF Chang
[41:20.080 --> 41:23.680]  story about four years ago when it was in the news again about Dinecore running
[41:23.680 --> 41:28.640]  giant child kidnapping rings and I was getting death threats about talking
[41:28.640 --> 41:32.240]  about it at the time and my family threatened but I went ahead and went
[41:32.240 --> 41:38.160]  through that fear because it isn't fair anymore it causes rage and commitment and
[41:38.160 --> 41:41.080]  I walked over to a bunch it was a commander and some other cops and I and
[41:41.080 --> 41:44.200]  I and I was and they were all arrogant and haughty just like everybody else in
[41:44.200 --> 41:48.440]  this in this God forsaken country going to hell I mean but we're about to be
[41:48.440 --> 41:53.480]  judged man this country is gonna gonna get Germany over 20 million Germans
[41:53.480 --> 41:59.920]  died in World War two non-military but like two and a half million German
[41:59.920 --> 42:03.560]  soldiers died you think we're gonna get out of this you think the Soviets got
[42:03.560 --> 42:13.080]  out of it I mean this country is is is going to be destroyed by its own evil
[42:13.080 --> 42:16.920]  guaranteed unless we turn away from wickedness and I said you know that
[42:16.920 --> 42:20.440]  Dinecore building right there that's one of the nationwide centers and they
[42:20.440 --> 42:24.240]  run child kidnapping rings it's in the news please look it up and the big cop
[42:24.240 --> 42:28.880]  laughed at me and he said I know who they are I'll work for him you got this
[42:28.880 --> 42:32.920]  feeling of power and the other cops laughed and I looked in their eyes I
[42:32.920 --> 42:38.640]  could tell they weren't involved in any of the child stuff they just enjoyed the
[42:38.640 --> 42:42.800]  power of being under those black wings it was almost like I could see a giant
[42:42.800 --> 42:47.920]  thousand-foot devil angels standing over them and they were under its wings and
[42:47.920 --> 42:52.000]  they liked it they liked being under those black wings that's where they
[42:52.000 --> 43:01.600]  want to be oh man and it was just like being punched in the stomach not that
[43:01.600 --> 43:05.080]  they laughed at me but that they had that you could make a joke about
[43:05.080 --> 43:10.720]  something that evil that you could just out of hand like I'm supposed to walk
[43:10.720 --> 43:15.400]  over let's see if hey that the Dinecore you know about them imagine if it wasn't
[43:15.400 --> 43:18.600]  some big corporation and they were a group doing that to kids you think the
[43:18.600 --> 43:21.800]  cops want to hear but instead now I guess they worked there for security
[43:21.800 --> 43:32.640]  advantage it's like I know who they are I'll work for them all the cops are
[43:32.640 --> 43:42.320]  shining on to that evil and I could see all of their eternal souls one big step
[43:42.320 --> 43:49.480]  closer to eternal hellfire and I'm not trying to be a preacher here it's just
[43:49.480 --> 43:58.440]  what comes out of me and there's this new big article about this big madam
[43:58.440 --> 44:02.960]  supplying into the police judges and top politicians and the recordings and they
[44:02.960 --> 44:05.320]  couldn't bust them for five years because the police were blocking the
[44:05.320 --> 44:10.520]  investigation the New York Post and others report and it was the internal
[44:10.520 --> 44:15.040]  corruption bureau that was able to go after her wonder how long she's gonna
[44:15.040 --> 44:19.120]  live and man this this this article gets into the little kids locked up in
[44:19.120 --> 44:23.840]  dungeons and everything I can't read it if you want to go read it go read it
[44:25.720 --> 44:31.520]  somebody's got to stand up for these children I mean I look at how innocent
[44:31.520 --> 44:34.320]  and good children are and I think about people that want to hurt them and let me
[44:34.320 --> 44:38.600]  tell you something you know what I think about doing don't you because you want to
[44:38.600 --> 44:43.840]  do the same thing and that's a natural response but we've got to use the
[44:43.840 --> 44:47.560]  info war against these people and we've got to identify them and we got us go up
[44:47.560 --> 44:52.000]  against them and if you know what if cops and people want to laugh about it I
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.120]  know there are a lot of police out there that know and we'll go look this up and
[44:55.120 --> 44:57.960]  they know we're not making it up and I don't know what you're gonna do about it
[44:57.960 --> 45:01.200]  obviously they're not all bad of this this this wouldn't they wouldn't even be
[45:01.200 --> 45:08.680]  busting this group right now the problem is we have denied evil for so long I
[45:08.680 --> 45:11.800]  mean if you're a new loose and you're like they're not tying kids down and
[45:11.800 --> 45:15.880]  testing pesticides on until they die you know what you better go look it up
[45:15.880 --> 45:20.160]  because CPS workers blew the whistle it was confirmed it was going on and then
[45:20.160 --> 45:23.320]  the news was like well they're gonna stop doing it now and no one got in
[45:23.320 --> 45:29.520]  trouble and the CPS workers got fired or reassigned that blew the whistle I mean
[45:29.520 --> 45:34.120]  they're using national security trading with the enemy espionage acts against
[45:34.120 --> 45:43.080]  hundreds of reporters in America now that report on corruption I mean we're
[45:43.080 --> 45:49.880]  getting down to the wire here of course the people serving evil are a bunch of
[45:49.880 --> 45:54.440]  pedophiles and child rapists I mean who else would want to destroy America who
[45:54.440 --> 45:57.960]  else would want to sell us out who else would want to fund al-qaeda who else
[45:57.960 --> 46:01.480]  would want to put poisons and vaccines the food and water I mean I'm gonna give
[46:01.480 --> 46:07.040]  all the enforcers a little message and memo here and you ignore this at your
[46:07.040 --> 46:13.460]  grave peril I'm gonna give you a message here did you get a memo about the
[46:13.460 --> 46:17.960]  vaccines being tainted with cancer viruses and sterilants did you get a
[46:17.960 --> 46:20.680]  memo about what they call fluoride in the water with hundreds of deadly
[46:20.680 --> 46:25.160]  chemicals in it did you get a memo about GMO and every study sterilizing the
[46:25.160 --> 46:30.920]  rodents within three generations that they give it to did you see all the
[46:30.920 --> 46:34.480]  public Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundation documents in the 60s
[46:34.480 --> 46:40.320]  planning all this do you notice all the health problems in you and your family
[46:40.320 --> 46:45.040]  do you know about all the statistics do you understand you even if you think
[46:45.040 --> 46:48.160]  you're serving the system because I've seen a lot of weak cowards out there who
[46:48.160 --> 46:52.480]  get into like make-believe I see this in business and life a lot you'll see
[46:52.480 --> 46:58.320]  delusional people they'll say oh Alex Jones is even a radio host and they'll
[46:58.320 --> 47:01.360]  go where Alex Jones has been discredited and defeated and it's like a fake
[47:01.360 --> 47:04.840]  victory it's like announcing you're the king of England you're not it's like a
[47:04.840 --> 47:09.440]  culture of delusion see I don't live in delusion I live in reality I try to live
[47:09.440 --> 47:12.280]  as close to reality as I can get doesn't mean I don't look through rose colored
[47:12.280 --> 47:17.080]  glasses doesn't mean I don't have all the answers the point is I'm trying to
[47:17.080 --> 47:22.960]  live in reality I can pull back and look at myself you know in the third person
[47:22.960 --> 47:26.600]  the creepy third person and say say what Alex Jones stands for because I know
[47:26.600 --> 47:31.640]  myself and I try to know my enemies and I'm someone committed to a cause of
[47:31.640 --> 47:35.960]  liberty and basic decency and honor and the system that taps my phones and
[47:35.960 --> 47:40.480]  everything knows that and that's why all their assaults are about how I'm not
[47:40.480 --> 47:47.400]  real I'm not good because by looking at myself and Ron Paul and others who are
[47:47.400 --> 47:51.240]  examples of people standing up and having an effect who are good not perfect
[47:51.240 --> 47:56.520]  but our hearts are good we want to be good that is a testament to others to
[47:56.520 --> 48:01.200]  be an example so that you can model yourself off of what we've done and be
[48:01.200 --> 48:07.720]  even greater that's how humans work so they want to pull down everything good
[48:07.720 --> 48:11.720]  so that you can't recognize good from evil there is evil in the world they
[48:11.720 --> 48:14.840]  also want you to deny that's going on when it's the current system we're
[48:14.840 --> 48:29.400]  under but only point at others and say that's the evil I mean look at some of
[48:29.400 --> 48:33.400]  these other headlines USA Today Sony patents technique of beaming info
[48:33.400 --> 48:38.480]  directly in the brain video games that plug into your brain wirelessly they've
[48:38.480 --> 48:42.320]  had that stuff for 30 40 years the different patents now it's all going to
[48:42.320 --> 48:44.840]  be rolled out and you're not you you think you're already mesmerized by the
[48:44.840 --> 48:53.160]  computer your iPhone I remember DARPA ten or ten years ago or so was in the
[48:53.160 --> 48:58.680]  Baltimore Sun and they said yeah conspiracy theorists will go wild with
[48:58.680 --> 49:03.480]  this but we are testing through cell towers different wavelengths to calm the
[49:03.480 --> 49:06.880]  public during emergencies kind of like the Japanese and US government are on
[49:06.880 --> 49:10.640]  the news you can pull it up saying maybe we need to put lithium in the water to
[49:10.640 --> 49:15.960]  make everybody happy and statins maybe prozac well you go look at the water
[49:15.960 --> 49:19.840]  test in major cities like Dallas it's hundreds of times what could be there
[49:19.840 --> 49:23.480]  from runoff they're already adding prozac to the water when they do the
[49:23.480 --> 49:27.960]  studies the major cities it's not one of the particular designer serotonin

[49:55.160 --> 50:00.680]  public can't wake up in many cases if they weren't awake before because we've
[50:00.680 --> 50:03.720]  been hit with chemical weapons people are like why are you risking your life

[50:58.960 --> 51:05.520]  everything a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[51:05.520 --> 51:09.240]  pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[51:09.240 --> 51:13.280]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[51:13.280 --> 51:16.800]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[51:16.800 --> 51:21.400]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our

[54:19.160 --> 54:22.320]  it we're gonna have open phones in the next hour that I guess for 30 minutes
[54:22.320 --> 54:37.680]  then more calls okay look as you know they're following the exact same script
[54:37.680 --> 54:42.760]  that they use with Libia that oh we're not backing the rebels and then oh we're
[54:42.760 --> 54:46.880]  only adding them a little bit oh we're only gonna bomb and send in some special
[54:46.880 --> 54:51.600]  forces to advise this is not a war and then they put al-qaeda in charge wreck
[54:51.600 --> 54:55.320]  the entire infrastructure blow up the water treatment plants the bridges
[54:55.320 --> 54:59.760]  everything blow up the major you know hotels shoot everybody up start
[54:59.760 --> 55:04.280]  ethnic cleansing it'll be in the news when they bring down Syria which there's
[55:04.280 --> 55:07.720]  a good chance they will that they're killing the minority Muslim groups and
[55:07.720 --> 55:11.400]  the Christians and it'll just be a footnote like oh too bad things didn't
[55:11.400 --> 55:16.680]  go well there no things are gonna go very well and then they're gonna say give
[55:16.680 --> 55:20.160]  your rights up or the Muslims are gonna get you the very ones publicly run by
[55:20.160 --> 55:25.840]  the globalist that run our country see America's run by the terrorist now
[55:25.840 --> 55:30.560]  Hillary said six months ago we will never bombard or never fund rebels well
[55:30.560 --> 55:34.920]  they've been funding the rebels in fact just a big article came out yesterday
[55:34.920 --> 55:40.680]  that got leaked out of the Pentagon where this is months ago they were saying
[55:40.680 --> 55:44.440]  we'll blow up buildings will get will engage in terror attacks will blame it
[55:44.440 --> 55:49.680]  on the Syrian government and part of the cases which is exactly what Tarpoli
[55:49.680 --> 55:54.760]  said when he went over there was that the consensus was the snipers were
[55:54.760 --> 55:59.480]  shooting peaceful people as a full spectrum dominance to then say that it
[55:59.480 --> 56:02.960]  was Assad's forces and I'm not saying that their government isn't doing stuff
[56:02.960 --> 56:08.560]  as well but you better believe this invasion is not on to bring peace love
[56:08.560 --> 56:16.400]  happiness and patty cake to Syria now here's McCain yesterday saying air
[56:16.400 --> 56:22.520]  strikes air strikes but again these are just to aid the the the protesters who
[56:22.520 --> 56:27.200]  he wants to arm further you know protesters with machine guns and
[56:27.200 --> 56:36.880]  rocket launchers in the case of Libya tanks and aircraft oh yeah so let's go
[56:36.880 --> 56:39.960]  ahead and go to that club here it is the United States should lead an
[56:39.960 --> 56:45.880]  international effort to protect key population centers in Syria especially in
[56:45.880 --> 56:52.600]  the north air strikes on Assad's forces to be clear this will require the
[56:52.600 --> 56:57.800]  United States to suppress enemy air defenses and at least part of the
[56:57.800 --> 57:02.720]  country oh the ultimate goal of air strikes should be to establish and
[57:02.720 --> 57:08.480]  defend safe havens and havens in Syria especially in the north let's stop
[57:08.480 --> 57:14.080]  position forces can or and oh I'm sorry we're they can organize resistance I'm
[57:14.080 --> 57:18.560]  sorry continue finish the club and eyes and plan their political and military
[57:18.560 --> 57:29.200]  activities against Assad oh that's enough oh oh oh oh just like we saw eight nine
[57:29.200 --> 57:33.000]  months ago in Libya where they now admit it's upwards of 40,000 people killed and
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.000]  they're lining the blacks up who are black Libyans the Saudi Arabians people
[57:37.000 --> 57:41.000]  that have come in and they're killing them by the way I get threatening emails
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.640]  I see videos that are made by Saudi Arabians you know saying you bet we're
[57:44.640 --> 57:50.840]  taking over and we'll get you to Jones I mean I don't have a dog in this fight I
[57:50.840 --> 57:53.840]  don't want my country over there engaged in this you guys want to kill each
[57:53.840 --> 57:58.040]  other go crazy but don't send my military I don't want to be involved I
[57:58.040 --> 58:03.560]  don't care of your Iranian Saudi Arabian Syrian I'm an American who just wants my
[58:03.560 --> 58:08.640]  freedom don't you get it you know it's like the whole Serbia thing I've gotten
[58:08.640 --> 58:12.280]  death threats before from Albanians and people going how dare you side with the
[58:12.280 --> 58:18.440]  Serbs you dirty scum I'm not siding with the Serbs Albanians anybody I know
[58:18.440 --> 58:22.400]  NATO went in there and blew that country up and ethically cleansed Serbs as well
[58:22.400 --> 58:27.640]  to destabilize that entire region and it's wrong and on my military shouldn't
[58:27.640 --> 58:33.040]  be there don't you get it I mean it's that simple and then we've got more
[58:33.040 --> 58:39.600]  clubs of him saying arm the rebels I mean it is this is the beginning of World War 3

[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.200]  okay I'm going to continue going through news and breaking down the World War 3
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:34.720]  scenario that we're already in after the break also this is one of the top
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:39.160]  stories on drudge it's an info wars comm article by Steve Watson YouTube
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:45.680]  restricts video of engineer proving how useless TSA scanners are man walk through
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.880]  radiation firing machines with metal objects knowing he would not be stopped
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.560]  because it's all a hoax it's about billions and billions from churn off
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:57.160]  and others former homeland security head it's about radiating you and it's about
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:00.680]  saving naked images of your body and total domination now everywhere I've
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.960]  flown when people go through the scanners most the time you get a
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:12.560]  grope down as well so that's coming up and they block the video now hopefully
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.960]  when we get the name of it we'll be able to find copies of it because folks are
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:21.440]  usually good at putting copies up this gentleman John Corbett is also joining us
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:28.600]  coming up later in the next hour to break down exactly what he has witnessed
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:34.720]  and we're gonna we're gonna air the censored video here now again when
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:42.520]  we posted the great video of TSA help wanted that I think it's one of the
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:48.320]  funniest things ever this is so real by the health ranger Mike Adams it went
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:55.160]  completely viral in a matter of one hour it had been blocked via TSA demand
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.800]  which Google admits they get government demands quote for things critical of
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.360]  government and all it did was make fun of them and show them enjoying groping
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.920]  people and photos of them groping and then everywhere else it got copied to
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:13.960]  they kept blocking it I know YouTube videos I mean I've had one video before
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:18.960]  you know get over 10 million views just one version of it and so I could look
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:24.120]  at the likes and dislikes in one hour it had over a thousand likes you usually
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.240]  get that in a video that gets 50,000 views in maybe a day so it was gonna get
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:35.480]  10 million views and every time that happens they just blocked the video the
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:39.720]  video is called how to get anything through a TSA nude body scanner get it
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:44.080]  put it on every bit torrent the known galaxy posted everywhere under different
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:50.200]  names posted under different names so the TSA can't find it call it Anna Nicole
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.840]  Smith in the nude or something like that you know just call it random stuff full
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.320]  spectrum attack and by the way that won't work soon because they've got
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:04.440]  voice print systems like Shazam that are already blocking my voice they can just
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:08.560]  on the whole systems hit a button and erase my voice everywhere see the whole
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:12.880]  web as Dr. Stallman said here a few months ago one of the inventors of much
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.120]  of the internet technology we have today everything's being built with back
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:20.880]  doors to censor track trace and control you it's here it's on we've got to fight
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:26.200]  over the architecture of the web now Google's now announcing they'll censor
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.520]  anybody they want they'll track everything you're doing every Google
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.280]  platform they will not let you opt out now when you use Google phone they're
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:40.040]  gonna listen to you the we wrote an article six years ago now when Google
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.360]  put a press release out that they were using cameras on your laptops and
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.000]  computers to watch you but they said don't worry an AI software is recording
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.840]  your surroundings if it hears a dog bark it'll then put it in the algorithm to
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.720]  show you dog food ads was an example people couldn't believe our article
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:04.160]  when it was a link to Google.com's own press release now since then public
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:09.920]  schools announced in New Mexico California Pennsylvania oh we're watching
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:15.160]  kids on the school laptops at home in the bed in the shower they announced it
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:21.160]  themselves and still I was a liar when it was in the associated press that
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.280]  they're watching you at home. You understand because people know that's a big
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:30.880]  brother so oh that's not happening in America but it's admitted but Alex is
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:34.440]  still bad you know there's an admitted world government but he's still bad
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:38.800]  because he said for 17 years that it was being developed and it's exactly the
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:43.560]  world government he said a global corporate private banking system well
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:48.160]  here it is New Jersey man and spy case spoke of viewing party that they're
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.040]  trying to put a guy in what in jail for 20 years for putting a webcam in his own
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:56.960]  dorm room where people are having gay sex saying it violated somebody's
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:03.400]  privacy which it did but but I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:07.720]  food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:11.640]  body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:16.440]  vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:20.960]  was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great products

[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:28.440]  is one of the top stories on drudge right now and they've killed the video but
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.760]  we found alternate versions are having them added up there YouTube restricts
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:38.400]  video of engineer proving how useless TSA scanners are man walk through
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:43.800]  radiation firing machines with metal objects knowing he would not be stopped
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:50.600]  now the TSA has fought the DEA and others on releasing studies that ten out of ten
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:55.120]  times different federal agencies have snuck weapons bombs and drugs on the
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:01.640]  aircraft the TSA are too busy picking out a beautiful woman or if it's their
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:07.440]  fancy a child or a man that's their fancy as well to grope they come up in
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.960]  the US and England with print offs of the naked bodies they were caught lying
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:15.680]  saying they couldn't store them turns out they do of course they lie about
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:21.680]  groping people under 12 said they stopped never stopped it's all about oh you
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:26.480]  have a two ounces of shampoo you're a terrorist a woman was arrested for
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:31.920]  painting her nails on the aircraft that's an act of terrorism that just came
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:38.720]  out and I told you it was always about a giant federal power grab but but but
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:45.640]  when he joins us during the next hour we will talk to engineer John Corbett
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:51.200]  here in the next hour of the popular blog TSA out of our pants and the video
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:56.760]  went viral it got picked up by a whole bunch of newspapers and then you know
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:03.040]  what happened the video was blocked and this happens anytime we criticize the
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.320]  TSA in a particularly devastating way one of the videos when it went up on
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.920]  drudge but they were so slow as a day later two years ago of Michelle here in
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:16.600]  my office her seven eight-year-old daughter at the time and one-year-old
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.040]  daughter at the time flying back from Denver they wanted to go skiing never
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:27.440]  been to Colorado great state and the man came over and was going to search the
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.280]  seven-year-old and the baby and she said no you're not gonna do that they said oh
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:35.000]  you want a woman to do it because they're girls and she's like well I'll
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.680]  see how that's even better but okay and then the woman came over and groped them
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:46.880]  so is it okay for a man to go grow up men in a park then it's the same sex I so
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:54.000]  oh well it's not sexual I guess if it's the same sex really so this is what this
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.520]  is the the Twilight Zone area we live in and a few days later they jerked the
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:08.880]  video of her sitting in this studio not talking about anything graphic just
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:12.720]  saying she didn't want her children touch but because it was a mother and it
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:20.080]  was powerful they blocked that video Mike Adams makes one making fun of them TSA
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.560]  help wanted goes mega viral would have been watched 10 million times guarantee
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:29.440]  I mean I watched the view counts take time to add up it caches but I watched
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:34.360]  the likes in real time it was like 35 40 minutes it had a thousand likes zero
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:40.960]  dislikes I know those numbers that means it had been 10 million in a week it
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.800]  would have brought them down it was so funny and you know what they did block
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:49.520]  parental block not a complete block parental block nothing got like a
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:56.280]  hundred thousand years or something that's how they roll that's how they
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.600]  operate that's what they do and boy they were on it usually if it's a video
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.320]  they're censoring but it gets posted a hundred other places they can't get it
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:07.280]  down it was taken down everywhere some accounts were suspended and all it did
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:12.440]  was like have you people dressed up like TSA just going oh yeah it's even more
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:18.200]  awesomeer I'm a secret agent I'm gonna grope you and of course it started
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:22.040]  becoming a meme like I knew when Charlie Sheen said winning I got an airplane
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.400]  two days later everybody was on the airplane going winning winning winning
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:28.360]  winning suddenly I do hear it all over the streets now it did actually get
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:37.680]  picked up even more awesomeer you see we delivered devastating truth and they
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:44.040]  just go in and take it down and they're more and more admitting they're going to
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:48.080]  do this Google last year said they get requests and comply when something is
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:54.120]  quote critical of government and it turns out all these websites are spied
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:13:00.320]  on like a drudge report by big sis and why does she spy because the reports
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:06.080]  affect badly on the image of the agency the Department of Homeland Security the
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:11.320]  homeland I mean again they even choose iconography and words right out of
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:17.480]  fascist nightmares like a Kurt Vonnegut satire on a police state they go with
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:25.360]  it because the psych warfare chiefs know don't hide tyranny flaunt it flaunt it and
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:31.200]  so now it's happening everywhere they've delisted us from Google news I mean I
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.360]  don't even know how Google makes itself the search on all these apps I want
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:40.160]  Google off the toolbars in the office police I understand other searches aren't
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.680]  as good we've got to stop using these people you're like we'll stop using
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:45.760]  YouTube they own that well I'm gonna just stay in there they want us out of
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:49.640]  there because we're absolutely having a big effect
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:55.080]  that's the battlefield but but all of us should stop using it as a search engine
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:01.440]  because they use that to track us they put a bunch of strikes on us when I
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.760]  showed you live footage uploaded that got millions of views it's like three
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:10.960]  and a half million views just on our live channel in two days when I sent two
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:16.160]  reporters of Switzerland Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:27.560]  and we catch Google execs coming down the mountain from a chateau back to the
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:32.280]  armored hotel and what did the Google chief do he just had a bunch of strikes
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:37.160]  put on our account the video blocked I mean we're getting their attention we're
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:41.840]  up front we got power you got power we got a chance to beat these people they
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:45.800]  wouldn't be doing all this right now and showing everybody their sensors if
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:48.880]  there wasn't an effect and people ask me do you really think they killed Andrew
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:15:00.800]  Breitbart gee he's gonna release footage that he says that he says that he says
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:05.000]  will bring down Obama by the way I was on man cow this morning and I forgot to
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.520]  tell you guys he was supposed to go 1130 I know he was friends on record with
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.200]  Andrew Breitbart they hung around a lot without eating stuff he talked to
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:17.400]  Breitbart two days before and he said what is the video and he said yeah it's
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.320]  basically him with communist and it's gonna bring him down well that's what
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.960]  he pretty much said in the speech too but guys will you call man cow cell phone
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:29.720]  see the answers just call it five times he's got like two cell phone numbers
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:33.360]  just call him over and over again obnoxiously and just try to get him to
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:38.280]  pop in for five minutes but but he's just one more witness who talked to his
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.520]  before he died he said what is it please come on my show please tell me he's like
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:45.120]  I can't but it's you know it's him with communists it's it's it is gonna quote
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:50.480]  bring him down and then six hours before he set to release it he leaves a bar
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.480]  where he had two drinks with a bunch of people around him at a table some he
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.600]  didn't know and drops dead and they tell you instantly oh he died of natural
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.480]  causes but the coroner says no we're looking at foul play we're covering all
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.360]  the bases we're looking at everything six to eight weeks we've got a test for
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:10.360]  everything I mean folks if I die if I die of a hard attack they say and two
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.800]  hours after I get to the hospital and they say I'm dead they tell me you know
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:18.240]  they tell you it's natural causes nothing to see her move along boom boom
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.720]  that's the earmark and then he's gonna release something that's gonna destroy
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:34.760]  Obama that day that day you'd have to be a naive moron but I was called a
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:39.720]  Kool-Aid drinker by at least four newspapers by the way most talk show
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:44.880]  hosts talk about themselves all day when they're in the press I don't find that
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.080]  exciting except when it's an example of how we're winning and a testament to how
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:55.680]  we're winning but you type Alex Jones into Google News even though they're
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:02.280]  censoring my websites hundreds of articles from the Toronto newspaper to
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:08.560]  the BBC to just everything saying look at the kook Alex Jones he's been
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:14.280]  discredited those strat for emails which by the way our listeners told us
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:18.560]  about last week they've been out for weeks the strat for emails they call
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:24.760]  him a kook crazy because Alex Jones thinks bin Laden wasn't really thrown in
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:29.840]  the ocean but then stratford private intelligence group I guess found in
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:37.720]  Louisiana and based here in Austin is there saying he wasn't really thrown in
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:41.960]  the ocean but that itself is a scam right there folks bin Laden according to
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:48.080]  our high-level sources like dr. Pachanik and others on record was dead in 2002
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:53.280]  and of course the doctor that led them to his competitor that was a CIA agent and
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:57.080]  now Pakistan has released bin Laden's family as I predicted last year they
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:01.480]  would because they were never there that was all a cutout and so the Delta Force
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:04.840]  unit that went in the building and got on the aircraft it blew up and then
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:10.000]  those that spoke out they packed 23 of them on aircraft and blew it up and it
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.240]  turned out that the the rescue mission they were going on wasn't a rescue
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:19.480]  mission it was all made up they're killing the people that could cover up
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:26.160]  they're killing the people that are exposing the cover up just like with
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:30.320]  private Lynch the people exposing the cover up five of them got killed that
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.440]  survived in her unit and then she finally went public and said it's all fake
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.760]  none of it's true they told me to lie so they could get women in the military
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:40.960]  Pat Tillman he wasn't going along with all the drug dealing and everything he
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:44.480]  wasn't go along with the cover up they killed him turned out it was murder I
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:52.840]  mean it's just it's totally dishonorable and evil system and now the
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:56.080]  hoax it's not that they don't want you to know how to get stuff through TSA it's
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.680]  the fact that it's all a fraud they've tried to block other federal agencies
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:02.960]  that have shown they can sneak stuff through it who do actually care about
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:07.280]  security because it isn't about that it's about dog training you to be a slave
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:11.840]  so now they're blocking the video of an engineer up there showing people that
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:16.960]  he's able to do this and proving it in America Obama is arresting whistleblowers
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:21.320]  and journalists more than any other president combined and it's not even a
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:27.560]  news item and Breitbart's dead and I'm getting threats and Michael Savage love
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:34.120]  him or hating he's hiding out with bodyguards I mean this is real I mean
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:37.400]  they don't want you to understand the magnitude of what I'm doing and what

[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:51.000]  this group to blackmail people even more that's just our country it's run by
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.740]  every form of scum you can imagine with a bunch of naive people sucking their
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:59.900]  thumbs and those of us that are awake to it we're the bad people. Chad in New
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:04.860]  York you're on the air welcome hello mr. Jones how you doing today sir I'm
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:08.940]  great good to have you here with us okay sir I've been trying to get a hold of
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:14.300]  you for a couple weeks now I tried putting out a video on YouTube and I got
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:20.460]  blocked and my description got canceled the reason why I was trying to get a
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:26.220]  hold of you is because I think I came up with a good idea how we could possibly
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:32.620]  strike a blow for humanity and what I'm trying to do is organize a work stoppage
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:37.100]  in this country I personally believe the only way we're ever gonna be able to
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:42.780]  strike a blow for the little guy is I don't care how you do it I don't care
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:46.900]  who takes credit for I really don't care but a lot of people talked about work
[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:51.700]  stoppages and and strikes and things like that sir in the IMF World Bank
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:56.260]  plans leaked in 2002 they actually like those they're happy for a country totally
[01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:59.660]  collapsed for a year they're globalists they have unlimited trillions they made
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:04.380]  up out of nothing and the old days real factories real businesses cared now
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:09.300]  they love it because then everything collapses even more and then they go in
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:12.780]  and buy everything up for pennies on the dollar with unlimited money the
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:17.180]  megabanks that are setting up world government issue you've got to get rid
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.620]  of the Federal Reserve you've got to get rid of private banks controlling the
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:23.500]  currency that they use to then shut down real private banks that are you know
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:28.620]  loaning in your area now government strikes would work the military the
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:33.580]  police refusing to do illegal and lawful things that type of thing will
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:40.900]  work but a lot of strikes have been tried a lot of people talk about that but
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:45.020]  the unions are all basically globalist controlled so they always called you know
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:49.820]  band guns communism that's their demands you know it's never like unions you know
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:53.980]  demanding hey we want tariffs because China's got hidden tariffs on us we want
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:58.740]  tariffs so we're gonna strike no they always make deals to then train the
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:05.220]  group to ship their jobs to India so that's my issue on that front okay and
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:09.060]  the other thing I wanted to tell you Mr. Jones I'm using my cab that I drive
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:14.580]  every day to spread the word to everybody that I meet that I feel like is
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:20.220]  worth saving the people that like you said a couple weeks ago that are in the
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:24.460]  water that you think can swim I'm actually trying to put the word out there
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:29.700]  for you Mr. Jones I'm doing everything I can but I feel like sometimes I feel
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:32.900]  like it's a losing battle but okay well quit then I appreciate your call I
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:37.140]  was you I've quit then I advise you I wouldn't tell anybody and by the way
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:40.900]  you're not telling people in your cab about the new order for me I mean let's
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:45.140]  people that are fighting the new order are doing it for humanity and the
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:50.940]  current generation and future generations you know you say you're
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:54.380]  calling from New York City I see a lot of people that are awake when I'm in
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:57.820]  New York the problem is they all feel like you they are a lot of them oh I
[01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:04.340]  don't have any power what can I do so you move to another area because I see
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:07.460]  people doing a lot all over this country I see the state's rights
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:12.020]  nullification movement taking place I see people rediscovering the Bill of
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.980]  Rights of Constitution they just had a federal ruling that you can have guns
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:19.220]  on campus how do you restrict my right because somebody else might come shoot
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:24.980]  somebody I need my gun to protect myself these gun-free zones are
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:29.620]  unconstitutional now we're having a lot of big successes record gun sales that's
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:34.540]  a success right there record numbers of people calling themselves preppers now
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:40.740]  if this was 1970 you should be prepping you just need to be prepared you need to
[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:45.180]  have a backup that's just common sense people are waking up and I understand it
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:53.340]  gets frustrating info from Maryland you're on the air go ahead I'm doing

[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:13.580]  October Matt Kaiser said something about a banker that died died in the World
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:19.660]  Trade Center and he basically got like you know five got my five million dollars
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:24.300]  I was wondering would there be any way to basically get claimed that money or
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:28.340]  something like that yeah yeah I appreciate your call he was telling the
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:31.220]  story it was in the news at the time it was like 10 million or something of a
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:35.100]  suicide banker he thought he knew he could die but he wanted to stay there
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:38.860]  to do some trades knowing people were panicking to make a bunch of money ended
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:43.900]  up giving up his life and that's an analogy a parable to bankers destroying

[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:05.940]  year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:10.140]  sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:14.260]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:18.260]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:23.100]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild

[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:07.180]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:11.460]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to
[01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:15.220]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:18.900]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:23.460]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:28.100]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:31.540]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:35.300]  grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:39.260]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:42.420]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:46.100]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:35.340]  you know it's good talking to these callers but you know what we don't screen
[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:40.260]  your calls I want people to sound like they're awake it's funny when I did a
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:45.420]  daytime show for years people when we don't screen calls
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:49.140]  summer great calls some sound like they're asleep but at night people are
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:55.100]  on fire and they're awake because you know it's it's after work or whatever I
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:34:02.380]  whenever I say calling on one topic great calls because it's a specific issue
[01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:05.500]  but when I just say phones are open I shouldn't do that anymore I guess it's
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:09.580]  always things are changing around here things always need to be I guess a
[01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:13.860]  topic like everybody else doesn't talk radio and I guess you know we won't
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:17.740]  scream what your opinion is but we need to start making sure people have got a
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:23.100]  pulse so John Harmon you hear what I'm saying if somebody if you can't even
[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:27.620]  hear them over the telephone and they sound like they're injecting heroin then
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:31.260]  I don't want them on my show do you understand that John all right all right
[01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:35.780]  just because I just can't handle it I mean I'm and I'm not mad at people it's
[01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:41.620]  just that it's all coming down okay and everybody is in a coma haze in this
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:48.580]  country and I can't be around it anymore I think that's really what it is
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:53.740]  everybody's in a coma people are in a daze the stuff they're putting in the
[01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:58.940]  water and everything is not working on me man it's not working on me let's go
[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:09.340]  ahead and talk to CJ in Michigan you're on the air go ahead that's good that's
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:13.900]  kind of like kind of a half asleep yell though come on let me hear some let me
[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:23.220]  hear some real growl there come on right now that's a little better okay
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:28.980]  Alex I want to talk to you about article you have on infowars.com by Paul
[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:38.020]  Joseph Watson it was the is Ron Paul warming up to VP fly or whatever with
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:44.860]  the top with the question mark look at that interview he is not even closely
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:48.900]  considering it in fact what yeah you know what I don't sit there with my
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:53.700]  writers like Curtin and Moe Aaron Dykes Paul Watson Steve Watson I don't
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:58.060]  pre-approved their articles and occasionally I see something that I
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:01.980]  don't really agree with the interpretation of and and and Paul was
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:06.900]  just being friendly you know in his statements and I've already told you
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:11.940]  what everybody inside the campaign is telling me no way is he is he doing that
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:16.900]  that was a Steve Watson article by the way that was written to be specific and
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:23.340]  I don't really agree with Steve's interpretation of it that I just wanted
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:27.060]  to put that out because I see a lot of comments you know they're always try you
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:30.460]  know who knows they're socked up to whatever trolls trying to say oh
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:35.740]  disinformation I know it's not that it was I Steve was also reporting I remember
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:38.860]  reading a couple days ago he was also reporting on what other people were
[01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:44.620]  reporting on so he mainly pretty much covers the Ron Paul beat and you know
[01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:48.100]  writes incredibly positive articles multiple times a day on every facet at
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:53.140]  info wars.com prison planet.com and info wars.net forget about that great
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:59.380]  sign so I hear you and I appreciate your call okay let's go ahead and go to
[01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:06.940]  Daniel in New York City go ahead. Yeah man I'm alive but I'm at the job so I
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:11.860]  can't be screaming but listen you don't need to scream but I can actually hear
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:16.100]  what you're saying go ahead. Yeah man I just want to say I'm not crazy because
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:20.340]  I believe in the Bill of Rights and Constitution now I'm sick and tired of
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:25.460]  the family court calling me crazy because I believe that I have
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:30.780]  constitutional rights and the Bill of Rights. No that's what they do I've been
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:34.140]  in the family courts watching it as a reporter and they say the Bill of Rights
[01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:37.780]  the Constitution isn't here we're family court and of course the family court
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:41.200]  probably doesn't even know they were set up in 1915 on average as a race
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:46.580]  hygiene eugenics court that's outside of the Constitution and does not follow the
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:51.940]  due process and is completely illegitimate. So I told the judge I said
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:57.660]  look whatever you do to me I'm gonna sue you for it I'm gonna have to sue you in
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:02.940]  your individual capacity whatever you do they told me I should be glad that I
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:06.900]  have enough time for my daughter you know saying I give you a day here day
[01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:11.020]  there and I want equality but they say they said that doesn't that doesn't
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:16.020]  exist here. No it's all about keeping men out of the house because the state can
[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:19.660]  then be the daddy they did that nation Rome they do it in every culture you
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:24.420]  keep the men away from the children and I'll go back to slavery right now this
[01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:27.820]  was in Rome with white slaves is where they developed it you keep the women in
[01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:32.260]  the main castle you keep the men out there in the fields and you take the
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:36.940]  kids in to be trained in the system that you choose and that's all this is is
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:42.060]  ending men in the house ending the family to turn us into this nightmare
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:48.140]  society. I'm tired of it and I believe that everybody should fight you know
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:51.980]  everybody should definitely get up and do something don't be discouraged when
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:55.700]  they put us down because my Bible says that it's not the race has not given to
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:59.620]  the swift or the strong but he who endure to the end so you gotta keep
[01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:04.060]  fighting you can't you can't just stop and lay down and I'm not gonna lay down
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:08.140]  I told him I was gonna do whatever I have to do file whatever papers I have to
[01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:12.900]  file and you know they calling me crazy they said oh he's crazy he needs he
[01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:18.380]  needs a psychiatric I mean I mean look look you know you're calling from New
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:22.460]  York I mean that's up there's where the government officials are in there with
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:26.780]  little kids having sex that's in the newspapers there so see no you're they're
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:31.540]  the ones that are crazy sick and crazy evil and of course they always play that
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:35.180]  mind game you're crazy you don't like the TSA sticking their hands down your
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:38.820]  pants you're crazy you don't like the army at the kite festival in Austin
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:43.180]  you're crazy you don't like cameras in bathrooms watching you now you're crazy
[01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:46.580]  that you don't like us to pull you over without a warrant and take your cell
[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:51.260]  phone and download the contents no they're crazy out of control tyrants
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:55.860]  you're crazy to not want a private New World Order well I thought well wait I
[01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:59.980]  thought I was crazy for predicting the private New World Order I mean again
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:03.700]  that's a simple mind game and you know what I love that Bible verse I forget the
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:07.860]  verse but that should be our motto because because it is about resistance it
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:12.460]  is about perseverance it is about never backing down never stopping and having
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:16.940]  the moral authority and having courage quote that Bible verse again and tell
[01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:21.140]  us the verse if you can remember it I don't remember it off the top of my head
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:26.660]  but I know that it says it in the Bible it says it's not it's not the race is
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:31.260]  not given to the swift no the strong but he who endure to the end he will get
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:36.380]  the game the kingdom of heaven but you know that's what I'm saying thanks Alex
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:40.380]  for what you do and and I just want to you know encourage everybody else to
[01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:46.100]  just persist and keep being persistent don't take no for an answer yeah you you
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:49.700]  do this to me well I'll sue you there maybe I'll sue you again individual
[01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:54.900]  capacity maybe I'll do this maybe I'll do that maybe I'll start legally following
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:58.140]  you around the video camera and see what you're doing and when you get out drunk
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:01.700]  get in your car I'm gonna call the cops on you maybe I'm gonna start digging into
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:06.340]  exactly it's time to do whatever you can to the scum oh I'm crazy you're gonna
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:11.740]  find out how crazy I am that's right I'm very tired I'm tired I've been fighting
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:16.380]  this fight only for three years and it's very it don't let it gets you tired
[01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:20.660]  rejoice in what you're doing form an organization of men for men's rights in
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:25.260]  your area and help others when you really have started having victories is when
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:30.140]  you just understand you're standing up for what's right understand that that
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:35.980]  that you're gonna win in the end say one more thing they said that I was
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:42.100]  bizarre because I told the court that you're biased against men and I gave
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:46.700]  them the census data from the census here goes here says the evidence right
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:53.500]  here that 95% of women are given full custody of children but no no no the
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:57.700]  family court is not biased against men and they don't have a conflict of
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:02.380]  interest by the way statistics show that men take just as good a care of
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:06.820]  children as women do after age three women should be with the children when
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:09.740]  they're little you know I mean unless they're out of control and there are
[01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:14.020]  some women that don't have the normal instincts but look men and women if they
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:18.620]  can need to understand that that they need to stop breaking up and they need
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:22.260]  to understand it at least until the children are 10 years old or so but the
[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:27.620]  best thing they can do is stay together but every woman show every TV show the
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:31.380]  men are taught to act silly and stupid and not be serious the women are taught
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:34.500]  divorce is like a fun thing and it's something you get like a new pair of
[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:39.500]  shoes and it's all meant to destroy us God bless you my friend you know just be
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.700]  glad your your your child hadn't been grabbed there in New York and they're
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:46.740]  murdering them right now or selling them to Saudi Arabia or something I mean you
[01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:53.980]  know just just as bad as you got it it is nothing compared to children in say
[01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:57.660]  Eastern or Southern Europe where I mean the police hunt them out of their
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:04.860]  backyards on record I saw a number what Mike 2003 that from 2000 to 2003 BBC
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:10.380]  number 1.2 million kidnapped sex trafficked out of Europe alone you just
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:16.940]  type that in if that guys you do it BBC over a million sex trafficked out of
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:19.900]  Europe just in a they probably give you modern numbers I haven't seen modern
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:23.140]  numbers in a while and it turned out big governments were involved of course
[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:30.580]  governments involved in numbers like that I mean I just saw like a week ago
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:34.100]  they caught some you in person with sex slaves and they're always catching
[01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:37.780]  billionaires with slaves in their houses
[01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:48.220]  it blows me away the level of evil we're up against let's go back to your
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:54.660]  phone call Steven in Florida you're on the air go ahead first of all I want to
[01:43:54.660 --> 01:44:03.700]  say I'm awake I'm aware I'm alive and therefore I'm active and I am not going
[01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:12.300]  to just take what's going on lying down to be passive I cannot be burning with
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:19.980]  the desire to see this evil stopped and to see it exposed and so here's what I
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:23.540]  wanted to share with you real quick and then if you've got time I have a friend
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:29.100]  here with me who's actually been what I would term a concentration camp here in
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:34.260]  Florida through the system but recently I was talking to a neighbor of mine
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:38.860]  across the street he went to a shooting range with his sister and he
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:42.620]  confirmed what you have talked about so many times on your show about what's
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:46.140]  happening to people in the military and how they're being conditioned and groomed
[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:52.020]  to view us as the enemy he said that a guy that was working at the shooting range
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:59.140]  who's about his age 26 said to him man he was a four or five term Iraq war
[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:03.460]  veteran and he said man I want to go back over there man it was so great we
[01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:07.100]  had so much fun and this friend looked at him and said man what are you talking
[01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:10.500]  about and he showed up and he said yeah let me tell you what we were doing in
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:15.620]  our spare time when we weren't fighting these people we would find a dog and we
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:19.860]  would shoot it in the back end to wound it and cripple it and then we would grab
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:24.620]  a big cinder block and go over to drop it on it and kill it or put it on an IUD
[01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:28.940]  and just blow it up for kids and man that was so great I want to go back over
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:33.020]  there again and his sister looked at this guy and she said are you sick or
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:36.940]  something do you are you nuts and this guy said come on you know your love of

[01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:24.900]  undoubtedly it is look at him making a big deal out of limbaugh trying to get
[01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:30.220]  him off the air right now other talk show hosts are hiding out all of this is
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:34.740]  going on but but you talked to Andrew Breitbart just two days before he died
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:40.420]  tell us what he told you Alex look I am working on a TV show I can't go into
[01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:46.020]  details yet I do hope you'll announce it and as you know I wanted you and I and
[01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:50.220]  Breitbart to be part of this show that was the plan yeah yeah and and I've been
[01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:54.820]  working on this thing for a year Breitbart it signed off Breitbart and I were
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:59.260]  speaking not every day but every other day Breitbart was on my silly little
[01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:02.740]  radio show once a week and he was going to do a segment like the old Jack
[01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:05.580]  Anderson segment of Good Morning America that you and I grew up with Breitbart
[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:09.820]  predicts and you know like he broke the Weiner story or the you know the Anthony
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:15.300]  Weiner story or the Acorn story he would predict what the next big story was this
[01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:21.180]  Joe Arpaio this sheriff finding out for example that that Obama's paperwork not
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:25.020]  just the birth certificate but much of it is fraudulent yeah he had like 20 CISI
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:28.180]  people confirm and they were blown away they weren't they're like this is
[01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:32.540]  ridiculously fake and so is the selective service the social security
[01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:36.700]  everything and he was about to get behind that and and the commie stuff and
[01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:42.980]  bye-bye yeah and look I I knew Barack Obama and he was you know Barry the
[01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:46.900]  community organizer and and for six years people told me they knew Barack
[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:51.580]  Obama they knew him back in the day and he was introduced to them as foreign
[01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:57.660]  exchange student Barack Obama but look Breitbart told me he had films March
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:02.460]  first he had films March first March first he has films March first I said

[02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:33.620]  it's about purges a video went up today showing how you can get to the TSA
[02:08:33.620 --> 02:08:37.780]  body scanners with weapons and they flipped out and had YouTube take it down
[02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:42.420]  when it was in a bunch of newspapers our stories at drudgereport.com this is
[02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:47.980]  the type of stuff we're talking about okay now it's incredible how much intel
[02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:51.820]  and how much info I get and how much I don't tell you because I don't like
[02:08:51.820 --> 02:08:57.260]  talking about myself in the third person but we are newsmakers here and those of
[02:08:57.260 --> 02:09:01.020]  us that are newsmakers I've had the White House respond to me a year ago when
[02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:03.700]  we first reported how they're going to shut down most of the power plants not
[02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:09.100]  owned by GE to boost their profits the White House responded Jay Carney saying
[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:12.620]  I was a crazy liar and then months later they admitted they were doing it the
[02:09:12.620 --> 02:09:16.660]  point is I'm on the White House enemies list that came out two years ago it's
[02:09:16.660 --> 02:09:21.940]  creepy I've had establishment types call me and say why don't you just join the
[02:09:21.940 --> 02:09:27.020]  establishment the point is this is real Andrew Breitbart the day if you just
[02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:31.900]  joined us here in the third hour the day he was set to release something that was
[02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:37.100]  going to vet Obama he told others that would bring him down he he dies we're
[02:09:37.100 --> 02:09:39.900]  gonna play a clip here in a moment of him at CPAC talk about vetting him and
[02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:45.940]  you know this is gonna be powerful but hiding in plain view and I meant to call
[02:09:45.940 --> 02:09:47.980]  him last week to get him on because I knew he had him on all the time was
[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:53.180]  friends with him is Eric Mueller man Cal Eric man Cal Mueller a man cal.com who
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:57.900]  you know has done nationals talk shows on TV Fox for more than a decade
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:01.580]  syndicated radio number one Chicago you know the story William Shatner's buddy
[02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:04.740]  everybody else is buddy the point that we're gonna get to I want to hold on
[02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:09.460]  I'm building up because it's true three or four months ago or longer he's calling
[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:12.980]  me going are you ready to do a show with me and Andrew Breitbart will you do it
[02:10:12.980 --> 02:10:16.980]  I'm saying there's no way they're gonna let me do a show on that big TV network
[02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:20.940]  but I'm sure you're gonna do your show and that's wonderful and now he's gotten
[02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:24.620]  the show we can't say the name and stuff yet it'll be out soon and then and then
[02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:28.620]  all this is going on and I'm not even remembering this was happening and then
[02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:32.820]  he's like hold on I got to go Andrew Breitbart's calling me so he's lining us
[02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:37.260]  up to be like the two sidekicks on the show and I'm like yeah I'll see man Cal
[02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:40.900]  and Breitbart on TV they're never gonna put me on so I'm kind of halfway
[02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:44.860]  understood I'm like man Cal that's nice to you but they're not gonna do that so
[02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:49.380]  you know they're gonna give you a show maybe Breitbart but not me so I mean
[02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:52.180]  knowing the big network it is number one in news I'll sleep with that it's hard
[02:10:52.180 --> 02:10:54.700]  to figure out who that is but we're gonna have a big article out on this
[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:56.660]  because you know it's a big article that he was supposed to do a show with
[02:10:56.660 --> 02:11:00.180]  Weiner on CNN according to man Cal and well that's not even true this is a real
[02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:04.900]  show on where you'd expect him to have a show so I'm setting the table here so
[02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:08.100]  that's how credible man Cal is on his relationship with Andrew Breitbart because
[02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:13.220]  he was set to the show and green-lighted already somebody on that network now he
[02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:16.740]  tells him two days before he dies man Cal tells him I want you to repeat all
[02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:19.420]  this man because we're doing an article and the press is tuned in right now
[02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:24.740]  there's gonna be hundreds of newspapers he tells you what repeated all and then
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:28.580]  get into where's the video the footage of him at the commie meetings that was
[02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:31.500]  gonna be released March 1st that would quote bring down the house of cards man
[02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:35.820]  Cal you've got the floor tell us everything look he may have been working
[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:41.660]  on a TV show with CNN I find it a little bit far-fetched because of you
[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:45.340]  look at it the way MSNBC treated somebody like a bad view cannon the left
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:50.940]  isn't interested in the other side but I don't know is it possible I suppose it
[02:11:50.940 --> 02:11:54.460]  is he never talked with me about it okay we were working on our own little TV
[02:11:54.460 --> 02:12:01.580]  thing okay I I just remembered something else or something else that I
[02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:05.740]  haven't said yet Alex but basically he said he had video yet information that
[02:12:05.740 --> 02:12:09.780]  would bring down the house of cards that is the house of Obama he says it's all
[02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:13.540]  over I brought up Mitt Romney I brought up right so what about you know who's
[02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:19.620]  gonna win he goes it doesn't matter now it's over Obama's over I know the truth
[02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:27.980]  and I said is is it Saudi is he the Arabian candidate is he you know forget
[02:12:27.980 --> 02:12:33.700]  the entering candidate is he funded by Saudi Arabia is he a plant he goes it's
[02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:39.180]  much bigger than you can even imagine it's much bigger than that it's much
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:45.460]  bigger and and and it's over I've got the smoking gun I said well of course I
[02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:52.020]  want the breaking story come on buddy no I said well tell me he goes no I said
[02:12:52.020 --> 02:12:56.700]  are you afraid he goes you know he was a he was a fearless guy but I sense a
[02:12:56.700 --> 02:13:02.180]  little bit of fear I said buddy this is you should tell somebody you should tell
[02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:06.140]  somebody and I often told him to make sure that he had you know duplicate
[02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:09.940]  copies of everything and then a case can take anything ever happen these are
[02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:15.320]  conversations we had had a place called heaven on seven a cage in joint where we
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:21.020]  hung out in Chicago I remember having this conversation and but March 1st he
[02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:25.580]  was to let the world know March 1st March 1st and then boom he goes out for a
[02:13:25.580 --> 02:13:29.420]  walk in the middle of the night 10 of natural causes immediately before there
[02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:33.180]  was any investigation they announced natural causes now I've been doing this
[02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:37.860]  since the late 80s just the way the media the mainstream media and you got a
[02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:43.100]  read between the headlines just the way natural causes natural causes now it
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:48.660]  looks like they're gonna investigate it I hope they do investigate it a lot of
[02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:53.180]  people from what I understand last night at his funeral is memorial service a lot
[02:13:53.180 --> 02:13:58.420]  of people feel the same way I do any of us that knew him that I anybody you know
[02:13:58.420 --> 02:14:03.700]  and I know hundreds of people that know him in our gut our first song was all
[02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:08.060]  they killed him look March 1st he's gonna bring down Obama and then he goes
[02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:11.180]  out of the middle of the night and he's got a natural causes move on nothing to
[02:14:11.180 --> 02:14:15.380]  see here and the fact that they killed him on March 1st is a message to
[02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:20.980]  everybody Alex Alex I want to make this very clear to everybody I don't know
[02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:25.780]  that they killed him I'm just saying you know my gut is is right more times and
[02:14:25.780 --> 02:14:29.460]  we don't know that bears go to the bathroom in the woods well I've never
[02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:32.740]  seen a bear actually go to the bathroom in the woods it wasn't animated so I
[02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:37.500]  I don't know I don't know but it just seems fishy to me as a young man with a
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:44.380]  healthy guy I thought and I want to say something else you talked about this I
[02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:51.420]  don't believe whatever he had we're ever gonna see the real deal they'll release
[02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:54.740]  something but I don't believe we'll ever see the real deal I'll tell you why
[02:14:54.740 --> 02:15:01.260]  look if it meant releasing this tape and and being killed I wouldn't release it
[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:07.340]  I've got children I'm sorry I mean if I'm if I'm limpy forgive me I you know I
[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:11.300]  care about America I care about God I'll make you know maybe I'd give it to 20
[02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:15.980]  people and then release it but I really question whether or not whatever he had
[02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:20.460]  I think is gonna go with him to the grave well there were some leaks and
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:23.700]  comments that it was palling around with communist and then from other sources
[02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:28.660]  it was him at communist meetings discussing the overthrow of America well
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:33.340]  I mean how about this tape that we know forget Andrew Breitbart for a second we
[02:15:33.340 --> 02:15:38.580]  know that there's a tape of Obama getting up at a theater in Chicago and
[02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:45.660]  praising a terrorist and the tape exists and and the woman that has this is I
[02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:48.860]  I'm not gonna come I'm not gonna let anybody see it because she's an Obama
[02:15:48.860 --> 02:15:53.940]  supporter you know I I mean there there are things out there how about the
[02:15:53.940 --> 02:15:57.100]  people that have told me they knew Obama when he was a young man and he was
[02:15:57.100 --> 02:16:01.820]  introduced to them as a foreign exchange well that's on record it was Barry
[02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:05.820]  Cetero and for years they said you were a conspiracy theorist now he calls in the
[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:09.780]  shows as Barry and they put it in approved books about him yeah I was
[02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:17.220]  named Barry Cetero again who is this guy but but it looks like you know now
[02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:21.780]  we're gonna arm the Syrians I mean these are people that want us that want us
[02:16:21.780 --> 02:16:26.340]  dad we're gonna arm Al Qaeda to invade Syria look look man Cal here's what I'm
[02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:31.980]  getting at who is this guy you've made the point well speaking of that in
[02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:37.060]  San Antonio it's in the news and I've got the video the kids start saying USA
[02:16:37.060 --> 02:16:40.820]  USA which everybody even people at my speeches are saying that now it means
[02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:46.700]  yeah USA and people love that what it means well well well they're now saying
[02:16:46.700 --> 02:16:53.660]  they're now saying it's racist Alex Alex you forget I you know my shows on in
[02:16:53.660 --> 02:16:57.220]  San Antonio you're on in San Antonio and I went to the Alamo it's not very
[02:16:57.220 --> 02:17:02.620]  impressive but I went I went to the Alamo then I went to the 3d movie on IMAX
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:08.420]  and I want to say it was I don't know it was like over $100 for my family and it
[02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:12.620]  was an expensive ticket and they have edited the movie so that there's nothing
[02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:17.700]  offensive to Mexico now this is a massacre that happened at the Alamo
[02:17:17.700 --> 02:17:21.660]  you're talking about this San Antonio school in this school that's named Alamo
[02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:27.300]  High School and because people chanted USA when their coach who they love got a
[02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:34.780]  trophy because they chanted USA that's racist against Latinos in America it
[02:17:34.780 --> 02:17:40.860]  makes no sense well no take take Hispanic kids in San Francisco cannot
[02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:45.500]  wear American flag shirts because the illegals take it as anti-Mexico I mean
[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:49.660]  it's more like a soccer team thing you know kids were an old Navy shirts and
[02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:53.020]  the news when they were Hispanic they're like you don't wear American flags I
[02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:56.940]  mean in Arizona the American flag can't fly at government buildings they get
[02:17:56.940 --> 02:18:03.300]  pulled down by the illegals yeah this is this is the madness this is the crazy
[02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:07.940]  age wrong is right right is wrong what what has happened to you're not
[02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:11.820]  patriotic if you don't support al-Qaeda attacking Libya and Syria with our
[02:18:11.820 --> 02:18:15.100]  criminal government running it listen expanding on this though where does this
[02:18:15.100 --> 02:18:18.060]  go with Breitbart because I've talked to some people close to him as well and
[02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:22.020]  they say yeah he was really shaken up the establishment it looks bad that's
[02:18:22.020 --> 02:18:25.620]  basically a paraphrased quote but that's what I was told somebody right you know
[02:18:25.620 --> 02:18:29.860]  as close as you can pretty much get that yeah it doesn't look good and then you
[02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:35.260]  know national talk show hosting people that are hiding out brother I mean
[02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:40.260]  where does it go it doesn't go anywhere he's dead his vision is dead he was a
[02:18:40.260 --> 02:18:45.540]  singular force he was a unique force he was good this was a unique guy you can't
[02:18:45.540 --> 02:18:49.140]  replace people like this he wasn't one of the lemmings he wasn't one of the
[02:18:49.140 --> 02:18:52.980]  followers okay look our high schools are producing followers we've got plenty of
[02:18:52.980 --> 02:18:58.260]  followers this this was a this was a leader and he's gone and the movement
[02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:01.060]  will suffer and then when I say the movement I don't know that he was left
[02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:06.100]  to right I think he he wanted to he wanted some objective he was anti he
[02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:09.340]  was anti-corruption he was that he wasn't just playing games with the
[02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:13.660]  communist new owner left he was viciously really taking billions of
[02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:18.380]  dollars from the big city fraud machines and look I said the morning it
[02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:23.020]  happened when I was doing interviews then my own show at 11 a.m. Central I said if
[02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:27.260]  they don't release the footage that he said was coming out very soon and then
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:31.300]  media looks like oh we're gonna wait a while I mean boy that gives them time to
[02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:35.580]  decide what's gonna happen I mean man cow this looks really bad I mean my gut
[02:19:35.580 --> 02:19:40.140]  is they killed him brother brother I look I don't know if they might my first
[02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:44.460]  reaction and everybody's first reaction was cuz he said the first the first and
[02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:49.260]  then he died on the first before this video could be released hold on they
[02:19:49.260 --> 02:19:57.620]  just released the Breitbart video heavily edited stay there stay there we
[02:19:57.620 --> 02:20:00.340]  gotta do one more segment

[02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:18.020]  holding at least some of them man Cal you've got to go I know you've got to get
[02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:21.060]  back to the work you're doing this is big news that you were into a show with
[02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:24.900]  a Breitbart and that you and that he said it will bring down Obama it's over
[02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:29.260]  House of Cards will be brought down but yeah it's the top story on Drudge now
[02:24:29.260 --> 02:24:34.140]  it's not out yet we're saying Ben Smith releases selectively edited race video
[02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:38.060]  earlier today BuzzFeeds Ben Smith announced on Twitter that video
[02:24:38.060 --> 02:24:43.660]  researcher Andrew Kaczynski had released the mysterious Harvard Obama race
[02:24:43.660 --> 02:24:47.580]  video that the Breitbart folks have been talking about the video which he says is
[02:24:47.580 --> 02:24:51.340]  licensed from a Boston television station oh so they went they see this is who
[02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:54.500]  knows that's even true shows young Barack Obama leading a protest at Harvard
[02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:59.260]  Law School on behalf of professor Derek Bell a radical academic tied to Jeremiah
[02:24:59.260 --> 02:25:02.860]  right about whom he will be releasing significant information in coming hours
[02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:05.860]  however the video has been selectively edited either by the Boston
[02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:11.700]  television station by BuzzFeed itself yeah yeah well wait wait before you said
[02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:17.380]  that how many minutes ago 20 minutes ago on your program I said to you we're
[02:25:17.380 --> 02:25:21.260]  not ever going to see the video whatever Breitbart had goes to the grave with
[02:25:21.260 --> 02:25:25.820]  him I really believe that and certainly if if he was murdered as many believe I
[02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:29.220]  don't know that he was murdered many people it's their opinion that he was
[02:25:29.220 --> 02:25:34.860]  murdered certainly the people that are powerful enough to to do this are also
[02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:39.340]  smart enough to make sure they get the video or they intimidate the others
[02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:44.220]  around Breitbart enough so that that video is never seen I just I just don't
[02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:46.940]  whatever Breitbart told me about I just don't believe that's going to come out
[02:25:46.940 --> 02:25:53.300]  now well and you'll never know if it's the full thing they could release
[02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:56.740]  something else and say that's it well yeah that's that's because what he
[02:25:56.740 --> 02:26:01.340]  alluded to is palling around with communists in meetings and racial stuff
[02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:06.140]  and for most of my sources it's it's it's it's hardcore commie meetings and
[02:26:06.140 --> 02:26:08.660]  that's what he says he goes I'm in a vetting show you who he was hanging out
[02:26:08.660 --> 02:26:14.940]  with talking about overthrowing America yeah I I feel like that what we spoke
[02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:19.940]  about was even stronger than what he headed at its feedback I think he had
[02:26:19.940 --> 02:26:25.820]  huge stuff you know look he he was a businessman he would release this stuff
[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:29.260]  out he had things and he would you know he would he would flesh out the
[02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:33.300]  argument he would try to get evidence that backed it up he would get these
[02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:38.180]  things I had stuff that I wanted to jump on with and he would he would report
[02:26:38.180 --> 02:26:42.420]  different things that I had alerted him to but it would take it would take some
[02:26:42.420 --> 02:26:49.420]  time 10 days so I think I think there was more stuff you know everybody was
[02:26:49.420 --> 02:26:52.860]  feeding them stuff too I think there was more stuff that came out
[02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:58.460]  dirt feedback and he told me March 1st March 1st I don't know that we'll ever
[02:26:58.460 --> 02:27:04.420]  know I don't know God rest his soul and I hope he approves of what we're doing
[02:27:04.420 --> 02:27:08.500]  here today and I I don't want to die little kids I don't want to bring any
[02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:12.620]  more pain to his family they're going through hell right now oh man this is
[02:27:12.620 --> 02:27:17.780]  this is incredible that all this is happening and again I don't want to
[02:27:17.780 --> 02:27:23.100]  cast dispersions on the people running right bar.com but this better not be
[02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:26.420]  edited that's what they're gonna air on Hannity tonight they say the full tape
[02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:30.980]  will be released tonight on Hannity but who knows if they're even giving him
[02:27:30.980 --> 02:27:35.500]  the tape I mean who knows what it is yeah and I don't know that I mean you
[02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:38.820]  know Andrew alive I don't know that he would do it like that I think he would
[02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:43.300]  release on his site first look I've met some of the other people that work with
[02:27:43.300 --> 02:27:48.100]  Breitbart and they're pretty good guys pretty good people so I hope they're
[02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:51.620]  able to stay tough I don't know if I can do it guys I don't know if I can do it
[02:27:51.620 --> 02:27:55.900]  I don't know if I would be that strong you know I've got a little kids he had
[02:27:55.900 --> 02:28:00.660]  four little kids I I don't know I hope they keep up for America you know I
[02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:04.980]  hope they keep up the good fight there I think the bottom line here man Cal is
[02:28:04.980 --> 02:28:10.980]  that I mean I'm not saying what news corps did well not convicted yet but you
[02:28:10.980 --> 02:28:14.260]  know paying police for news and stuff why aren't the police in trouble and now
[02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:17.820]  it's those very police going after news corps and Obama who's shipping guns to
[02:28:17.820 --> 02:28:23.100]  Mexico energy deals all this corruption they're saying the FBI is investigating
[02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:27.580]  news corps here and now the Sun has left England and they're selling their stuff
[02:28:27.580 --> 02:28:31.580]  there I mean it's pretty clear they're being blackmailed and so who knows I
[02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:34.580]  mean I'm gonna be honest I don't want to see but I know you work with Fox and
[02:28:34.580 --> 02:28:40.060]  news corps but I'm seeing a lot of pro Obama crud on there now I'm seeing well

[02:28:44.060 --> 02:28:51.260]  just I just thought of something else months ago I read liberal bloggers and

[02:31:04.780 --> 02:31:08.300]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:12.660]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[02:31:12.660 --> 02:31:16.100]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:20.700]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[02:31:20.700 --> 02:31:25.340]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[02:31:25.340 --> 02:31:30.100]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[02:33:35.700 --> 02:33:41.620]  gonna play right here and then we're gonna go to the man himself but this
[02:33:41.620 --> 02:33:48.900]  video is censored how to get anything through a TSA nude body scanners they
[02:33:48.900 --> 02:33:54.980]  are taking this video down all over the internet they are taking this video down
[02:33:54.980 --> 02:33:58.660]  now there's a trick with YouTube when they block it for parental or can
[02:33:58.660 --> 02:34:02.060]  security concerns and make you log in because they know that kills it going
[02:34:02.060 --> 02:34:07.460]  viral the copy we linked to is just perennially blocked because you can't
[02:34:07.460 --> 02:34:10.540]  show people how to go through a TSA scanner because they're all frauds it's
[02:34:10.540 --> 02:34:18.620]  just about money making and radiating you and a power trip it's still posted
[02:34:18.620 --> 02:34:23.140]  info wars.com that's why drudge has a link to us where you can find the video
[02:34:23.140 --> 02:34:28.700]  they are now censoring it they are now blocking it YouTube restricts video of
[02:34:28.700 --> 02:34:32.860]  engineer proving how useless TSA scanners are we have that video right
[02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:36.820]  because I was busy running around like a chicken with my head cut off with this
[02:34:36.820 --> 02:34:42.100]  man cow news folks this is how close I get to the problem now I had Dave
[02:34:42.100 --> 02:34:47.940]  Mustaine coming to town for over a month well three months ago he was coming
[02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:50.780]  but then his neck was so bad he had to have surgery he wanted to come to town
[02:34:50.780 --> 02:34:54.980]  visit his wife and I and my wife great people talk about the new order and
[02:34:54.980 --> 02:34:59.740]  stuff we shot a big in-depth interview but it's it's a good hour and a half of
[02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:04.420]  never before never before heard info that will air sometime next week here
[02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:11.460]  on the radio and TV because I want to you know really add a lot of features and
[02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:14.540]  thanks to it because it's a it's a powerful interview but that's a side
[02:35:14.540 --> 02:35:20.700]  issue I'm so scrambled time-wise that I thought he was coming this next weekend
[02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:25.900]  and the crew Friday's like you know the concerts tomorrow we're supposed to go
[02:35:25.900 --> 02:35:28.660]  film that and you're supposed to pick Dave up take him to your house with you
[02:35:28.660 --> 02:35:32.380]  and I'm like no it's not it's next week quit bugging me about this and then
[02:35:32.380 --> 02:35:36.740]  Saturday comes and then I happen to be online and see an ad for Megadeth and
[02:35:36.740 --> 02:35:41.940]  Motorhead being in town that's the problem I'm getting into now is that I
[02:35:41.940 --> 02:35:47.820]  just read news I wake up at 3 a.m. and start reading my iPad I I have all this
[02:35:47.820 --> 02:35:52.460]  information and then I've got to take a break or do something because it's
[02:35:52.460 --> 02:35:56.460]  getting to the point now where I can't even keep track of things anymore like
[02:35:56.460 --> 02:36:02.140]  I forgot that I was being offered a national TV show that's now been
[02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:05.740]  approved is going forward who knows if I'll be in it I'm frankly I don't care
[02:36:05.740 --> 02:36:09.380]  in a way I don't want to I like man Cal but it's on the biggest news network out
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:13.580]  there it doesn't mean say the names if it's not clear who I just said I told
[02:36:13.580 --> 02:36:16.700]  you I've been offered shows a few months ago I said I've been offered shows on
[02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:21.100]  Fox and I don't want it because I was telling them then no no no but now
[02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:24.660]  they're like well maybe I don't care I don't want it go ahead and offer it to
[02:36:24.660 --> 02:36:29.020]  me see what happens but that's a side issue I knew Breitbart had signed on it
[02:36:29.020 --> 02:36:33.580]  was green-lighted the show is going ahead so he from when man Cal knows he
[02:36:33.580 --> 02:36:37.100]  wasn't gonna have a show on there the point is I told you I have sources the
[02:36:37.100 --> 02:36:39.420]  new Breitbart and they think he was killed and he was gonna bring down
[02:36:39.420 --> 02:36:44.940]  Obama and then I even forget I had another source that was man Cal saying
[02:36:44.940 --> 02:36:48.820]  this before I mean I remember walking around in my backyard like three months
[02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:52.380]  ago he's going brother I hope he got security cuz let me tell you Breitbart
[02:36:52.380 --> 02:36:55.660]  I'm telling him he's you know they may come after him and he's got stuff gonna
[02:36:55.660 --> 02:36:59.860]  bring out on Obama I'm really worried about it I mean what man Cal's like
[02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:04.420]  calling me every you know hour you know for a few days there about this and like
[02:37:04.420 --> 02:37:07.940]  are you ready are you ready to come to New York and do the show are you ready
[02:37:07.940 --> 02:37:11.580]  this is gonna be big it's gonna get it and I've got this other big TV show
[02:37:11.580 --> 02:37:17.500]  you know that's man Cal and so all of this is happening
[02:37:19.060 --> 02:37:25.060]  we do have our guests now right okay good I'm ranting I'm gonna play this
[02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:31.260]  video I'm gonna play this video and then go to him because my point is is that
[02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:34.820]  everything's just breaking so fast now I didn't even remember that man Cal was
[02:37:34.820 --> 02:37:38.100]  saying they're gonna kill Breitbart three months ago and that he was telling him
[02:37:38.100 --> 02:37:42.300]  watch out and that he had stuff that would destroy Obama and then I was
[02:37:42.300 --> 02:37:47.100]  supposed to have a TV show with Breitbart I mean it's my life has just gotten to
[02:37:47.100 --> 02:37:50.540]  the point of just being too wild and I don't know what I'm gonna do because for
[02:37:50.540 --> 02:37:56.460]  my entire life I've been able to keep track of everything and now without the
[02:37:56.460 --> 02:37:59.980]  use of drugs I might be coming Ozzy Osbourne or something I don't you know
[02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:07.940]  it's just what day is it what's going on here okay continuing my friends I just
[02:38:07.940 --> 02:38:11.940]  got too many missiles coming at me here that's the globalist plan is just
[02:38:11.940 --> 02:38:15.660]  overwhelming us youtuber strict video of engineer proving how useless TSA
[02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:20.020]  scanners are man walk through radiation firing machines with metal objects
[02:38:20.020 --> 02:38:24.820]  knowing he would be stopped and he's John Corbett of the popular blog TSA out
[02:38:24.820 --> 02:38:29.100]  of my pants which is well said and of course it was just in hundreds of
[02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:33.860]  publications I mean it was in the Daily Mail it was in just everywhere that
[02:38:33.860 --> 02:38:39.500]  he did this he was gonna go mega viral boom they perennially blocked it
[02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:43.100]  meaning for porn or violence or whatever just like they do our videos on the
[02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:47.360]  TSA and Google admitted last year they've been asked to restrict stuff if it
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:50.580]  makes them if it's quote critical the government so this is a big censorship
[02:38:50.580 --> 02:38:55.660]  issue but now this is why we have prison planet dot TV this is why we have in
[02:38:55.660 --> 02:39:00.300]  fours nightly news this is why we have the syndicated radio show XM1 166 and
[02:39:00.300 --> 02:39:05.140]  I see somebody holding from XM1 166 it's why we have our own system we use
[02:39:05.140 --> 02:39:10.140]  their systems but as they begin to censor we can run the blockade so here's
[02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:13.300]  his four-minute video them we're going to the gentleman who's been censored
[02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:19.260]  right now engineer Jonathan Corbett shows how to beat the TSA body scanners he
[02:39:19.260 --> 02:39:22.980]  didn't show how to beat him he's showing that you can get anything through them
[02:39:22.980 --> 02:39:27.140]  and they're a total fraud so they're spinning it like it's a security breach
[02:39:27.140 --> 02:39:31.700]  yeah that the emperor is butt-naked and wearing no clothes that it's all a hoax
[02:39:31.700 --> 02:39:36.660]  so Chertoff can make millions of dollars who ordered the stinking things let's go
[02:39:36.660 --> 02:39:40.580]  to the video and audio here it is video because I want the world to know how much
[02:39:40.580 --> 02:39:43.900]  danger the American Transportation Security Administration is putting us
[02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:47.260]  all in with their haste to deploy the expensive invasive nude body scanner
[02:39:47.260 --> 02:39:50.220]  program when the machines came out we were told that the invasion of our
[02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:53.940]  privacy doses of radiation and trashing of a Constitution were necessary
[02:39:53.940 --> 02:39:57.140]  because the old metal detectors weren't good enough that non-metallic
[02:39:57.140 --> 02:40:00.500]  explosives were a threat even though no one has boarded a plane in the US with
[02:40:00.500 --> 02:40:04.860]  any type of explosive in nearly 40 years but while America was testing these
[02:40:04.860 --> 02:40:09.020]  devices Rafi Sella who ran security for Ben-Gurion Airport in Israel which is
[02:40:09.020 --> 02:40:12.300]  known for being one of the most secure airports in the world was quoted as
[02:40:12.300 --> 02:40:15.540]  saying he could overcome the body scanners with enough explosives to take
[02:40:15.540 --> 02:40:19.500]  down a Boeing 747 and Ben-Gurion therefore refused to buy the
[02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:24.060]  scanners the US ignored this warning and mr. Sella has never publicly explained
[02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:27.900]  a statement but it stuck with me as a scientist engineer and frequent traveler
[02:40:27.900 --> 02:40:30.860]  as well as the first person to sue the TSA when they rolled out the scanners as
[02:40:30.860 --> 02:40:34.860]  primary in November of 2010 I studied and learned about both kinds of scanners
[02:40:34.860 --> 02:40:39.740]  used by the TSA here are several images produced by TSA nude body scanners you'll
[02:40:39.740 --> 02:40:42.540]  see that the search victim is drawn with light colors and placed on a black
[02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:46.100]  background in both images in these samples the individuals are concealing
[02:40:46.100 --> 02:40:50.500]  metallic objects that you can see as a black shape on their light figure again
[02:40:50.500 --> 02:40:56.900]  that's light figure black background and black threat items yes that's right if
[02:40:56.900 --> 02:41:01.020]  you have a metallic object on your side it will be the same color as the
[02:41:01.020 --> 02:41:05.740]  background and therefore completely invisible to both visual and automated
[02:41:05.740 --> 02:41:10.260]  inspection it can't possibly be that easy to beat the TSA's billion dollar
[02:41:10.260 --> 02:41:14.660]  fleet of nude body scanners right TSA can't be that stupid can they
[02:41:14.660 --> 02:41:18.940]  unfortunately they can and they are to put it to the test I bought a sewing kit
[02:41:18.940 --> 02:41:22.220]  from the dollar store broke out my eighth grade home x skills and sewed a
[02:41:22.220 --> 02:41:26.140]  pocket directly on the side of a shirt then it took a random metallic object in
[02:41:26.140 --> 02:41:31.020]  this case a heavy metal carrying case that would easily alarm any of the old
[02:41:31.020 --> 02:41:34.180]  metal detectors and I walk through a backscatter x-ray at Fort Lauderdale
[02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:38.020]  Hollywood International Airport on video of course while I'm not about to win
[02:41:38.020 --> 02:41:41.100]  any videography awards for my hidden camera footage you can watch as I walk
[02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:44.780]  through the security line with the metal object in my new side pocket my camera
[02:41:44.780 --> 02:41:47.820]  gets placed on the conveyor belt and goes through its own x-ray and when it
[02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:51.900]  comes out I'm through and the object never left my pocket maybe just a fluke
[02:41:51.900 --> 02:41:55.460]  okay let's try again a Cleveland Hopkins International Airport through one of
[02:41:55.460 --> 02:41:58.620]  the TSA's newest machines a millimeter wave scanner with automated threat
[02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:02.540]  detection built in with a metallic object in my side pocket I enter the
[02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:08.180]  security line my device goes through its own x-ray I pass through and I exit with
[02:42:08.180 --> 02:42:12.420]  the object without any complaints from the TSA and while I carried the metal
[02:42:12.420 --> 02:42:15.380]  case empty by one of malintent it could have easily been filled with razor
[02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:18.540]  blades explosives or one of Charlie Sheen's infamous seven-gram rocks of
[02:42:18.540 --> 02:42:23.180]  cocaine with a bigger pocket perhaps on the inside of a shirt even a firearm
[02:42:23.180 --> 02:42:27.540]  could get through it's important to note that any metal object of any size can
[02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:30.940]  use this technique and I don't urge you to try to bring contraband through
[02:42:30.940 --> 02:42:34.820]  security as the new body scanners often have false positives so while the metal
[02:42:34.820 --> 02:42:38.580]  on your side by get through a button on your shirt or sweaty armpit might look
[02:42:38.580 --> 02:42:42.860]  suspicious and earn you a pat down anyway now I'm sure the TSA will accuse me
[02:42:42.860 --> 02:42:45.980]  of aiding the terrorists by releasing this video but it's beyond belief that
[02:42:45.980 --> 02:42:49.140]  the terrorists haven't already figured this out and are already plotting to use
[02:42:49.140 --> 02:42:52.540]  this against us it's also beyond the belief that the TSA did not note
[02:42:52.540 --> 02:42:56.300]  everything that I just told you and arrogantly decided to disregard our
[02:42:56.300 --> 02:43:00.100]  safety anything to force Americans to give up our liberty to the federal
[02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:03.420]  government and our tax dollars to companies that are in bed with that
[02:43:03.420 --> 02:43:08.540]  government the new body scanner program is nothing but a giant fraud which you
[02:43:08.540 --> 02:43:12.420]  come as no surprise after the fast and furious scandal that sent thousands of
[02:43:12.420 --> 02:43:16.860]  guns to Mexican drug cartels and cost a customs and border patrol agent his
[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:22.180]  life this is a disgrace so let's fix this problem now before the terrorists
[02:43:22.180 --> 02:43:25.340]  take this opportunity to hurt us the TSA must immediately end the new body
[02:43:25.340 --> 02:43:28.420]  scanner program and return to the tried-and-true metal detectors that
[02:43:28.420 --> 02:43:31.900]  actually work and work without invading our privacy as well as implement better
[02:43:31.900 --> 02:43:35.420]  solutions for non-metallic explosives such as bomb sniffing dogs and trace
[02:43:35.420 --> 02:43:39.660]  detection machines the TSA is worse than ineffective they are an epic fail
[02:43:39.660 --> 02:43:43.100]  placing us all in danger beyond the scanners demand of your legislators and
[02:43:43.100 --> 02:43:46.380]  presidential candidates that they get rid of this eight billion dollar a year
[02:43:46.380 --> 02:43:50.580]  waste known as the TSA and privatize airport security ask for their
[02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:54.260]  commitment to our rights in exchange for your vote and no matter which parties in
[02:43:54.260 --> 02:43:58.060]  the White House are holds on to Capitol Hill the issue of ending TSA abuse is
[02:43:58.060 --> 02:44:01.940]  of interest to all Americans it's not a partisan issue we must stand together
[02:44:01.940 --> 02:44:05.420]  and demand an end to the organization that molests our families while placing
[02:44:05.420 --> 02:44:11.180]  us in danger by directly ignoring blatant security flaws thank you oh they
[02:44:11.180 --> 02:44:17.060]  don't just molest our families now in microwave us so turn off mixed money
[02:44:17.060 --> 02:44:23.980]  they now block the video we've been able to find other copies people've uploaded
[02:44:23.980 --> 02:44:28.940]  we've got one that they haven't erased yet at info wars calm and prison planet
[02:44:28.940 --> 02:44:33.580]  calm but probably not for long that's why drugs is linked to our article but
[02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:37.380]  Jonathan Corbett is a technology entrepreneur frequent traveler and
[02:44:37.380 --> 02:44:44.980]  first person to sue the total slave agency TSA after the nude body scanner
[02:44:44.980 --> 02:44:51.220]  invasive Pat down program began November of 2010 TSA out of our pants dot
[02:44:51.220 --> 02:44:55.980]  wordpress.com is his website and he joins us via video Skype we just aired it
[02:44:55.980 --> 02:45:01.540]  here to 3 million people conservatively but again this is scary the big news
[02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:07.900]  here is that they're now censoring YouTube we put a parody video out and
[02:45:07.900 --> 02:45:11.860]  they censored it as well what's your take on this Jonathan you must have hit a
[02:45:11.860 --> 02:45:16.660]  nerve with the perverts hey Alex yeah good to be on your show I think we must
[02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:20.820]  hit a nerve I haven't received any official response and as best I know
[02:45:20.820 --> 02:45:25.460]  there's been no public response but clearly they're not happy well you'll
[02:45:25.460 --> 02:45:28.100]  get the response next time it was the airport they'll probably get out some
[02:45:28.100 --> 02:45:32.380]  walnut crackers or something and come after you so tell us why you made the
[02:45:32.380 --> 02:45:37.060]  video how you discovered this and it's quite it's I think their censorship is
[02:45:37.060 --> 02:45:42.540]  going to backfire on them now right well as you mentioned I'd be more confused
[02:45:43.260 --> 02:45:47.700]  okay when I'm sorry your sky's been breaking up start over start over you
[02:45:47.700 --> 02:45:50.940]  got it the body scanners and these molestation pat downs and the court
[02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:55.540]  system is unfortunately a very slow process so I've been working through the
[02:45:55.540 --> 02:46:00.140]  court system for about last year and a half to try and see what we can do there
[02:46:00.140 --> 02:46:02.900]  and it's a slow process so about a couple months ago I said you know what
[02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:06.580]  let's let's find another way so you know if we can find a way to make these
[02:46:06.580 --> 02:46:09.740]  scanners you know publicly known to be ineffective then they'll be forced to
[02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:14.300]  remove them all right I want you to say that statement again because it wasn't
[02:46:14.300 --> 02:46:17.740]  the TSA it was Skype problems repeat what you were saying it was breaking up
[02:46:17.740 --> 02:46:23.180]  a bit sure if the TSA is scanners are proven to be ineffective that seems to
[02:46:23.180 --> 02:46:27.100]  me to be the quickest way to force them to remove them the TSA doesn't care
[02:46:27.100 --> 02:46:30.900]  about our safety they don't care about our privacy but if it's blatantly
[02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:34.460]  apparent that anyone can get anything through they're gonna have to remove
[02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:38.020]  well wait a minute I don't agree with your statement they don't they don't care
[02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:42.380]  about our privacy they're obsessed with creating the precedent of trampling it
[02:46:42.380 --> 02:46:46.820]  and grabbing the genitals of small girls and boys and colostomy bags of 95 year
[02:46:46.820 --> 02:46:51.820]  old women they relish trampling the Bill of Rights and Constitution in every
[02:46:51.820 --> 02:46:59.180]  basic human right it seems that some do yes well again a whole bunch of
[02:46:59.180 --> 02:47:02.660]  newspapers hundreds of blogs pick up your story and now they're erasing the
[02:47:02.660 --> 02:47:08.420]  video what do you plan on doing next well the ball is in the TSA's court it's up
[02:47:08.420 --> 02:47:13.220]  to them to see what they want to do next and and we'll take it from there all
[02:47:13.220 --> 02:47:15.820]  right sir you're talking to three million people right now I want to give you
[02:47:15.820 --> 02:47:19.780]  the floor what are other points you think should be made here
[02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:25.340]  you know that you basically covered and I'm sure all of your listeners have
[02:47:25.340 --> 02:47:27.940]  been hearing about these bodies can is for the last you know probably year and
[02:47:27.940 --> 02:47:30.980]  a half as long as I've been hearing about them so I'm sure there's nothing
[02:47:30.980 --> 02:47:33.620]  more that really needs to be said in that regard other than they got to go and
[02:47:33.620 --> 02:47:37.620]  this is this is one way to do it so you know anything that we can do to make
[02:47:37.620 --> 02:47:42.180]  this happen faster is something that we all should do you have a popular blog
[02:47:42.180 --> 02:47:45.260]  and YouTube channel sure you've heard YouTube admits they're starting to
[02:47:45.260 --> 02:47:50.260]  censor more last year they took down videos at government request if it was
[02:47:50.260 --> 02:47:54.100]  quote critical of video we're being told we have to fund Al Qaeda to attack
[02:47:54.100 --> 02:47:59.180]  Libby in Syria because they're not giving people all their rights to riot but
[02:47:59.180 --> 02:48:04.100]  then here in America they're taking more and more of our liberties I mean are you
[02:48:04.100 --> 02:48:09.060]  concerned about them blocking your video sir I'm concerned I actually don't
[02:48:09.060 --> 02:48:13.580]  know exactly what's going on with the block now I know that they're
[02:48:14.500 --> 02:48:20.100]  they age filtered it I don't know if this is blocking past that right now but
[02:48:20.100 --> 02:48:25.020]  you know this is this is a viewpoint that they're they're certainly gonna office
[02:48:25.020 --> 02:48:31.020]  in any way they can whether it's I think it's good well let me just explain
[02:48:31.020 --> 02:48:35.620]  because we've been through this a lot I could have a video of paint drying if
[02:48:35.620 --> 02:48:38.660]  they didn't like it they'd age restricted they do this to us all the time sir
[02:48:38.660 --> 02:48:44.660]  you were there talking in front of a camera and you show a couple news
[02:48:44.660 --> 02:48:48.580]  articles where Israeli security head says that scanners are worthless and the
[02:48:48.580 --> 02:48:52.940]  Canadian government says it and there's no images there's no nothing there's
[02:48:52.940 --> 02:48:56.700]  nothing age restrictive they just use it and let me explain what happens when
[02:48:56.700 --> 02:49:04.180]  they put the login deal which you lose 98% of your views okay we'll have a
[02:49:04.180 --> 02:49:08.580]  video with half a million views in two days it's gonna be 20 million in a month
[02:49:08.580 --> 02:49:12.860]  I mean if it starts and they always it could be me talking about GMO with no
[02:49:12.860 --> 02:49:18.140]  images of anything and they will put that on there and it kills it so it's the
[02:49:18.140 --> 02:49:23.420]  equivalent of killing your video yeah well I mean luckily we have been picked
[02:49:23.420 --> 02:49:26.900]  up by by every major news source we're talking you know I'm beyond yourself
[02:49:26.900 --> 02:49:31.700]  drudge report slash dot picked it up white combinators and great technical
[02:49:31.700 --> 02:49:39.140]  logs CNET news Google news has it everywhere the New York Daily News just
[02:49:39.140 --> 02:49:46.020]  picked it up so exactly but that's their mumbling coverage of what you pointed
[02:49:46.020 --> 02:49:50.220]  out your video is devastatingly clear and concise the opposite of your skype
[02:49:50.220 --> 02:49:55.620]  feed and it just we need to get this video out viral to everyone in fact I
[02:49:55.620 --> 02:49:59.100]  want to post the other video they censor don't have the Watson do this the
[02:49:59.100 --> 02:50:04.340]  bottom of our deal TSA what's it called TSA help wanted we can find a version
[02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:14.380]  they haven't blocked have you seen TSA help wanted to video I don't think I
[02:50:14.380 --> 02:50:20.420]  have yet no well it's even more awesome her great I look forward to it and that's
[02:50:20.420 --> 02:50:25.180]  something Mike Adams of the video says is in fact do we have that saved we
[02:50:25.180 --> 02:50:30.340]  should air that yeah yeah yeah we never saved that little jewel I don't know it
[02:50:30.340 --> 02:50:34.900]  might not might not be good for family audiences it makes fun of them TSA you
[02:50:34.900 --> 02:50:39.660]  know what Jonathan Corbett you're another test them into what people can do
[02:50:39.660 --> 02:50:44.340]  taking action against tyranny anything else you'd like to add thank you no
[02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:47.740]  I appreciate the time and you know this is something that you know anyone can do
[02:50:47.740 --> 02:50:51.820]  anyone could take a stand against the TSA you know everyone just needs to make
[02:50:51.820 --> 02:50:55.340]  this happen and just stand up and say no and you're on the nightly news tomorrow
[02:50:55.340 --> 02:50:58.740]  we'll probably get a better connection dude over the phone so I'll end up

[02:51:13.420 --> 02:51:16.540]  true seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and
[02:51:16.540 --> 02:51:20.340]  it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from

[02:54:22.980 --> 02:54:28.460]  first but I tell you it just threw me for a complete loop to get Eric Muller
[02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:33.740]  syndicated host Fox News host he's got his new Fox News show coming out and I
[02:54:33.740 --> 02:54:37.780]  totally forgot that he said will you do the show with me and Andrew Breitbart and
[02:54:37.780 --> 02:54:40.700]  I said well you'll get your show but they're not gonna have me on Fox and
[02:54:40.700 --> 02:54:43.620]  that's still because I don't want the job and all things gonna happen and that's
[02:54:43.620 --> 02:54:51.340]  still up in here but the point is is that he's talking to Breitbart two days
[02:54:51.340 --> 02:54:54.420]  before saying they're gonna kill you they're gonna kill you and Breitbart says
[02:54:54.420 --> 02:54:57.540]  I got stuff's gonna bring down Obama and then it leaked from another source it was

[02:55:46.340 --> 02:55:51.260]  again this story that we broke is now in hundreds of newspapers at our reports

[02:56:10.980 --> 02:56:16.420]  the a little funny TSA video help wanted well since they censored this off
[02:56:16.420 --> 02:56:20.020]  YouTube as well which is a real problem I mean they can't have people in there
[02:56:20.020 --> 02:56:24.060]  getting hundreds of millions of views since they did this maybe we should end

[02:56:27.980 --> 02:56:30.900]  still copies out there they haven't censored yet but this is what they're
[02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:35.020]  erasing off the web and this does have a few little mild you know jokes on it
[02:56:35.020 --> 02:56:39.140]  stuff you'd see at five o'clock in the afternoon on TV but the newest video
[02:56:39.140 --> 02:56:43.740]  they've censored has nothing in it it's totally g-rated talking about how the
