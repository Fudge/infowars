[00:00.000 --> 00:18.080]  So, Alex Jones has been number one on Twitter for most of the day.
[00:18.080 --> 00:22.480]  And what they do is they take a one-minute clip out of a five-minute video we're about
[00:22.480 --> 00:28.520]  to show you, and they edit it down to a minute so it doesn't make sense, and they say, Jones
[00:28.520 --> 00:35.120]  just randomly showed up at a park entrance and started yelling at teenagers who'd done
[00:35.120 --> 00:37.080]  nothing wrong.
[00:37.080 --> 00:39.200]  No.
[00:39.200 --> 00:44.440]  Just like Governor Newsome shut down all the major beaches of California for six months
[00:44.440 --> 00:48.600]  and people got angry and cities got angry, because the healthiest place to be is out
[00:48.600 --> 00:55.040]  in the sun, my wife came in Sunday morning hiking with a friend and said, these teenagers
[00:55.040 --> 01:00.840]  yelled at us and cussed at us and said, you don't have a reservation, get off this park
[01:00.840 --> 01:07.480]  when it's a 98,000-plus-acre park as big as a national park.
[01:07.480 --> 01:11.880]  Austin has the biggest city parks ever, because they had a thing called SOS back in 92 to
[01:11.880 --> 01:17.360]  spend hundreds of millions to forcibly make ranches and farms sell their property.
[01:17.360 --> 01:21.600]  So a third of Austin towards the west is green, because the environmentalists said we're
[01:21.600 --> 01:26.120]  taking it, it'll always be a free park for the public.
[01:26.120 --> 01:27.120]  And so I go, really?
[01:27.120 --> 01:31.000]  I mean, I know they've closed all the golf courses that are public, I know they've closed
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.800]  all the pools, I know they've closed parks that have like, you know, gym equipment and
[01:35.800 --> 01:39.720]  stuff for kids, but I meant the green belt, she goes, yeah, go down there.
[01:39.720 --> 01:44.880]  So I called a camera guy, call a security guy, in an hour we met down there, and I walk
[01:44.880 --> 01:46.880]  up and I walk through, you're about to see the video.
[01:46.880 --> 01:52.440]  Can I have a pass, I've been coming here since I was in high school and college.
[01:52.440 --> 01:57.720]  The park is 98,000-plus acres, just one piece of it.
[01:57.720 --> 02:01.320]  And I went, I've been coming here since high school and college.
[02:01.320 --> 02:07.120]  Now that's the top of Twitter, edited down, so it looks like I'm just yelling at innocent
[02:07.120 --> 02:08.120]  people on phones.
[02:08.120 --> 02:10.600]  No, they told me, hey, what are you doing?
[02:10.600 --> 02:11.600]  Get out of here.
[02:11.600 --> 02:15.240]  They yelled at my wife hours before.
[02:15.240 --> 02:18.240]  So again, that's the deception of mainstream media.
[02:18.240 --> 02:21.560]  The police go, yeah, there's no law, there's no law.
[02:21.560 --> 02:28.400]  They just said, send lifeguards and bureaucrats and trash collectors to go to dozens of entrances
[02:28.400 --> 02:33.560]  and say no one is allowed to go on these giant green belts.
[02:33.560 --> 02:37.840]  These people are preying on you, they're lying to you, they hope you're stupid, and of course
[02:37.840 --> 02:41.080]  they won't let my response trend, they'll probably block it.
[02:41.080 --> 02:42.400]  That's what criminals do.
[02:42.400 --> 02:46.720]  So it lives, it banned our video, and then FullWords.com and NewsWords.com.
[02:46.720 --> 02:51.640]  Here is what they claimed happened, then you'll see the full video of what actually happened.
[02:51.640 --> 02:56.800]  Please realize the globalist count on you not sharing this via your email, via your
[02:56.800 --> 03:00.480]  text message, can't do it really on Twitter or Facebook, you know what happens there.
[03:00.480 --> 03:05.200]  But the enemy counts on ignorance, don't let them win, share this video.
[03:05.200 --> 03:12.360]  So I've passed up and come in here since I was in high school and college, and now you
[03:12.360 --> 03:15.680]  guys use your COVID hosts to like set a check point up so you can take over the parks to
[03:15.680 --> 03:16.680]  start charging.
[03:16.680 --> 03:21.760]  It's unconstitutional, this is not even a city ordinance, this is a illegal power grab
[03:21.760 --> 03:25.600]  of the people's green belt, and it's time to free Austin.
[03:25.600 --> 03:28.440]  So are you guys volunteers for the city of Austin, who are you, Mass Man?
[03:28.440 --> 03:30.040]  I'm a lifeguard for Barton Springs.
[03:30.040 --> 03:34.160]  You're a lifeguard for Barton Springs, now part of the criminal power grab.
[03:34.160 --> 03:36.920]  This is outrageous criminal activity.
[03:36.920 --> 03:40.040]  This is the seizure of the infrastructure of Austin.
[03:40.040 --> 03:43.360]  It is all color of love garbage.
[03:43.360 --> 03:48.840]  My wife came here this morning when you cult member Coops showed up here, and you asked
[03:48.840 --> 03:52.440]  her, where's her reservation?
[03:52.440 --> 03:55.600]  Her reservation is that we live in a free country.
[03:55.600 --> 03:57.100]  We live in America.
[03:57.100 --> 03:59.280]  I call for everybody out there watching.
[03:59.280 --> 04:02.560]  The time for civil disobedience is here.
[04:02.560 --> 04:04.880]  I want this removed tonight.
[04:04.880 --> 04:09.400]  COVID-19 is a power grab, hoax.
[04:09.400 --> 04:11.400]  COVID-19 is a scam.
[04:11.400 --> 04:12.960]  Is that your IQ?
[04:12.960 --> 04:13.960]  One finger?
[04:13.960 --> 04:15.960]  APD just did its job.
[04:15.960 --> 04:21.760]  When a man comes and I go in here, and the APD told me, no, it's not enforceable.
[04:21.760 --> 04:24.480]  You can go on in.
[04:24.480 --> 04:30.480]  With over 100,000 acres, the parks in Austin, Texas are known as some of the most beautiful
[04:30.480 --> 04:33.440]  and widespread in the country.
[04:33.440 --> 04:39.720]  And in 1992, the Save Our Springs Ordinance was adopted as law, which opened up these
[04:39.720 --> 04:42.800]  beautiful lands to the public.
[04:42.800 --> 04:46.560]  Austinites practically live in a national park.
[04:46.560 --> 04:47.800]  Taxpayers paid for it.
[04:47.800 --> 04:49.720]  It is ours to enjoy.
[04:49.720 --> 04:51.560]  It is the law.
[04:51.560 --> 04:59.760]  But now Austin City Mayor Stephen Adler is attempting to seize control.
[04:59.760 --> 05:03.160]  I'm cutting this ad on Wednesday, August 12, 2025.
[05:03.160 --> 05:07.560]  This coming Sunday, this huge sale we've been running for last week will have to end.
[05:07.560 --> 05:15.040]  The Reopen America Back to School Special 50% off to 60% off all of our top best sellers
[05:15.040 --> 05:17.440]  and double pay three at points.
[05:17.440 --> 05:22.440]  I have to end the sale because we're selling out of bodies at 50% off, living defense at
[05:22.440 --> 05:27.480]  50% off, bad zombie 50% off, turbo-forcing 50% off, bottom-end real-teasing 50% off.
[05:27.480 --> 05:31.840]  Those are all very close to selling out, a bunch of other best sellers we still have,
[05:31.840 --> 05:34.360]  but I will end this special on Sunday.
[05:34.360 --> 05:40.280]  We'll have a new great special coming up next week, but it's not as extensive or expansive
[05:40.280 --> 05:41.280]  as the original.
[05:41.280 --> 05:43.280]  We'll be back at stock.
[05:43.280 --> 05:45.520]  It will be discounted, but it's not available yet.
[05:45.520 --> 05:46.960]  So this is a great sale.
[05:46.960 --> 05:47.960]  It funds the operation.
[05:47.960 --> 05:48.960]  They're great items.
[05:48.960 --> 05:52.920]  In crazy times like this, it's good to stock up, but whatever you do, keep spreading the
[05:52.920 --> 05:55.480]  word about Info Wars, because you are the modern voice.
[05:55.480 --> 06:16.280]  You are Paul Revere, and I salute you, and thank you.
[06:16.280 --> 06:24.960]  The year was 1996, and I was producing my first documentary film because it was in the
[06:24.960 --> 06:30.640]  UN Biological Diversity Treaty, and George Herbert Walker Bush had a few years before
[06:30.640 --> 06:41.320]  signed us on to Agenda 21 and a UNESCO treaty, though never ratified by Congress, that said
[06:41.320 --> 06:46.200]  by the year 2020, they would lock up most of the public lands, and that the general
[06:46.200 --> 06:51.440]  public would not be allowed to go on national and state parks without reservations, and
[06:51.440 --> 06:58.280]  that it would be about 1% of the numbers previously allowed.
[06:58.280 --> 07:02.880]  And then we discovered under COVID-19, it is the United Nations creating the six-foot
[07:02.880 --> 07:11.000]  social distancing fraud, the massive death toll prediction frauds, the fraud of saying
[07:11.000 --> 07:18.200]  no one has to die to call it a pandemic, and now they've closed the beaches in California
[07:18.200 --> 07:21.480]  and New Jersey and New York for six months.
[07:21.480 --> 07:27.480]  They're still trying to close them in California, all under UN Directives, and if doctors and
[07:27.480 --> 07:37.400]  scientists come out, if doctors and scientists come out and point out that it's all a fraud,
[07:37.400 --> 07:43.640]  they get banned off of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, you name it.
[07:43.640 --> 07:48.560]  And they're told the United Nations is in charge, you disagree with the WHO, that's
[07:48.560 --> 07:49.560]  not allowed.
[07:49.560 --> 07:54.800]  If you guys put the map back on screen for TV viewers, that is a map from 1996 put out
[07:54.800 --> 08:05.240]  by Dr. Michael Kaufman, an environmental engineer and expert, and that map, according
[08:05.240 --> 08:07.000]  to UN maps, blow it up.
[08:07.000 --> 08:13.280]  If you see Austin, Texas, exactly where we are, exactly where the red is of the Austin
[08:13.280 --> 08:19.320]  Greenbelt, is where they are now shutting it to the public.
[08:19.320 --> 08:26.640]  That is the Barton Creek Greenbelt, if you scroll up, Texas is right there on the bottom,
[08:26.640 --> 08:33.880]  and you zoom right in where Austin is, you can see where they're shutting the whole
[08:33.880 --> 08:41.200]  thing down, and those are the corridors where no one will be allowed to go.
[08:41.200 --> 08:48.480]  They're already shutting down state and national park areas, they're already trying to keep
[08:48.480 --> 08:54.320]  the public out for many years, we're upwards of 80% of the land's federal out west.
[08:54.320 --> 08:57.640]  This is their operation.
[08:57.640 --> 09:08.400]  So I put a film out in 1997 called America Destroyed by Design, and boy are we not seeing
[09:08.400 --> 09:17.640]  that plan to de-industrialize and shut us down and make us a service economy and then
[09:17.640 --> 09:21.840]  declare the service economy obsolete.
[09:21.840 --> 09:28.960]  It's agenda 21 signed on at the Rio de Janeiro conference right before he left office in 1992,
[09:28.960 --> 09:36.600]  Mr. New World Order, George Herbert Walker, Scullin' Bones, Bush.
[09:36.600 --> 09:41.840]  His friends with the Clintons to this day, till he died, and now the Global Clinton Initiative
[09:41.840 --> 09:46.640]  has Bush Jr. involved in it, and they've graduated from president up to world government
[09:46.640 --> 09:53.960]  board level, and this is directly from the Rockefeller Foundation lockstep 2010 quote
[09:53.960 --> 10:04.480]  under the guise of a pandemic, we will create a prison state on a planetary scale.
[10:04.480 --> 10:08.240]  The last kind of I know all this, well we have the website that just kind of redirects
[10:08.240 --> 10:17.320]  to M4s, prisonplanet.com, I plan a revamp of it very soon, prisonplanet.com, but you
[10:17.320 --> 10:22.640]  might want to go to the operation lockstep document itself, let's go there for TV viewers,
[10:22.640 --> 10:26.080]  radio listeners just type in operation lockstep, Rockefeller Foundation, you'll be on the
[10:26.080 --> 10:33.520]  Rockefeller Foundation website, and they say we'll bring in a planetary prison state,
[10:33.520 --> 10:42.640]  which is a prisonplanet under the guise of a pandemic, under the guise, and in my film
[10:42.640 --> 10:53.200]  in-game, E-N-D-G-A-M-E, in-game blueprints for global enslavement, we tell you that,
[10:53.200 --> 10:57.400]  because even before they had the Rockefeller Foundation say that, they had the Club of
[10:57.400 --> 11:05.640]  Rome and the UN say it, and in leak North American Union minutes from George Herbert
[11:05.640 --> 11:13.280]  Walker Bush, and then later Obama, at the secret confabs, they discuss planetary rule,
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.840]  and they say we will have tighter top-down government control and more authoritarian
[11:18.840 --> 11:26.080]  leadership, these are their words, and they also describe reeducation centers, you will
[11:26.080 --> 11:35.280]  be sent to, especially if you're white males, and now folks working on US nuclear weapons,
[11:35.280 --> 11:39.400]  federal government's premier nuclear research lab hosted a three-day reeducation camp, that's
[11:39.400 --> 11:45.680]  their words, for white males with the goal of exposing their whiteness, and how that's
[11:45.680 --> 11:52.320]  bad, so this is a Hitlerian race-based model, where you take the minority of the minority,
[11:52.320 --> 11:57.680]  whites of the minority, about 8% worldwide, so half of those male, 4%, and you teach they're
[11:57.680 --> 12:06.240]  bad, and corporate trillionaire, they control trillion, white men direct the operation and
[12:06.240 --> 12:11.160]  train the brown people to be racist, and then organize the whole planet around that, destroying
[12:11.160 --> 12:15.720]  what middle class is left on the planet.
[12:15.720 --> 12:20.520]  Full report from InformationLiberation.com is up on Infowars.com, US Nuclear Research
[12:20.520 --> 12:24.600]  Lab hosted reeducation camp for white males, go read it for yourself, where they have to
[12:24.600 --> 12:32.240]  declare themselves bad and evil, and the things that are not good, President Trump being white,
[12:32.240 --> 12:36.280]  you have to associate yourself with the KKK and mass killings, and agree that you are
[12:36.280 --> 12:45.000]  a bad person, mom, golf, baseball, apple pie, are all bad as well, now I'm not joking, this
[12:45.000 --> 12:51.240]  is not a joke, just like the official city of Austin budget says proposal, blow up the
[12:51.240 --> 12:54.240]  police station.
[12:54.240 --> 12:59.320]  This is a communist takeover with billionaires running the whole thing, and because there's
[12:59.320 --> 13:04.400]  nothing we won't put up with, there's no limit to what they'll do, remember Hillary
[13:04.400 --> 13:12.040]  said we need reeducation camps for men, and for adults, people said what does that mean,
[13:12.040 --> 13:16.640]  Obama it came out in 2010, the document was from then, but it came out a few years later,
[13:16.640 --> 13:20.200]  we got it, people didn't believe it, it was real, the army said no that's a real document,
[13:20.200 --> 13:28.120]  they leaked it to us by the way, they didn't like it, it said we're going to have reeducation
[13:28.120 --> 13:33.400]  camps in America, and they were hiring reeducation camp specialists for during a civil war, they
[13:33.400 --> 13:38.680]  described processing Americans in with their social security numbers, just type in Obama
[13:38.680 --> 13:47.920]  DOD document, describes reeducation camps for right wingers, you can read the document,
[13:47.920 --> 13:54.560]  it's public, about a year after we broke it, the army itself put it on its website, so
[13:54.560 --> 13:58.920]  it's not the armies even our enemy, the globalists want control of the military and the police
[13:58.920 --> 14:03.600]  to then make them carry out the pure evil, and that's what putting in the district attorneys
[14:03.600 --> 14:09.760]  and the county attorneys and the state attorney generals and stacking the FBI with their people
[14:09.760 --> 14:18.720]  is about, is living in a real police state, now we have a bunch of big guests today, Jay
[14:18.720 --> 14:25.640]  Dyer is going to be interviewing very well known, top of the food chain comedian Sam
[14:25.640 --> 14:34.320]  Hyde, Ali Alexander, journalist and analysis expert will be joining us to talk about Kamala
[14:34.320 --> 14:42.280]  Harris and just how evil she is and what's up with her, and so much more today.
[14:42.280 --> 14:45.880]  But you have to understand we have fought thanks to your support to just stay in position
[14:45.880 --> 14:50.800]  to be on radio and TV stations, to have info wars.com and news wars.com and to have band
[14:50.800 --> 14:54.480]  on video, and yeah we have a lot of videos that get over a million views, our top video
[14:54.480 --> 14:58.160]  has about four and a half million views, we really do videos with ten million views and
[14:58.160 --> 15:01.520]  I don't make money off the advertising that's on them, we take the money we make from the
[15:01.520 --> 15:05.880]  radio show and people buy the products, we put it back into the bandwidth and the infrastructure
[15:05.880 --> 15:12.000]  that's millions of dollars a quarter, so it takes a lot of money to do this and we appreciate
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.960]  you but we want to pay a lot of money for bandwidth because we want to reach people,
[15:16.960 --> 15:21.800]  so go to band.video, click the left hand link, it will pull out a menu of all the different
[15:21.800 --> 15:27.120]  channels and there's the band videos of band.video, that's all the medical doctors, scientists
[15:27.120 --> 15:31.360]  and nurses, those are the most viral videos that have been banned off Facebook, Twitter
[15:31.360 --> 15:35.320]  and YouTube and they are so pissed those even exist, they are fighting around the clock
[15:35.320 --> 15:41.080]  to bring down that band section, in fact I want that band section on the left hand side
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.920]  of band.video put to the top, I don't want Alex Jones to be at the top or Owen Shroyer,
[15:44.920 --> 15:51.680]  David Nider, Paul Watson or John Bown or even David Ike, I want those band doctors and whistleblowers
[15:51.680 --> 15:56.440]  at the top of the navigation bar, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[15:56.440 --> 16:02.320]  This is a maximum alert, a maximum alert, as of taping this alert we are 82 days out
[16:02.320 --> 16:07.080]  from the election, as many of you know in the last year I pointed out statements out
[16:07.080 --> 16:10.960]  of the council on foreign relations and other globalist organs that they know Trump is
[16:10.960 --> 16:17.280]  going to win in a landslide, so their strategy will be to contest the election, if they fail
[16:17.280 --> 16:22.840]  to successfully steal it, then they are openly now wargaining, this is in the New York Times,
[16:22.840 --> 16:27.440]  having democratic states and cities secede from the union just like they've ignored
[16:27.440 --> 16:31.880]  Trump's policies on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down, that is nothing but
[16:31.880 --> 16:36.360]  a dress rehearsal, they are saying they are going to have their own separate inauguration
[16:36.360 --> 16:43.160]  not in DC, they said in another city, Colossia said this, when they crown Biden and Kamala
[16:43.160 --> 16:44.160]  Harris.
[16:44.160 --> 16:50.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the organized civil war, this is their public criminal plan,
[16:50.120 --> 16:53.640]  we should be praying, we should be spreading the word, we should be demanding Trump won
[16:53.640 --> 16:56.320]  the offense to expose this criminal activity.
[16:56.320 --> 17:01.520]  Well over six months into the COVID-19 lockdown and now, democrat leaders are calling for
[17:01.520 --> 17:05.120]  people to be charged for the attempted murder if they don't wear the mask of the symbols
[17:05.120 --> 17:09.560]  of slavery and they've triggered their race riots around the country led by white, angry
[17:09.560 --> 17:14.640]  liberal academics and others and now on top of the democrats are officially saying, hey
[17:14.640 --> 17:18.240]  Trump's going to try to steal the election and contest it, but then their internal war
[17:18.240 --> 17:22.720]  gaming documents come out with John Podesta at the very top with Kamala Harris and of
[17:22.720 --> 17:27.160]  course Joe Biden and they're saying, oh we think we're going to lose, but we're going
[17:27.160 --> 17:31.600]  to have the democrat state secede claiming that Joe Biden's won the popular vote and
[17:31.600 --> 17:36.120]  we are then going to set up our own country and ask the military to remove Trump.
[17:36.120 --> 17:39.800]  This is officially in the New York Times and I don't just believe the New York Times,
[17:39.800 --> 17:43.320]  I've been telling you for over a year, this is their plan for other statements they've
[17:43.320 --> 17:47.880]  made and then Atlantic Monthly, the Washington Post, the Financial Times of London, the
[17:47.880 --> 17:52.040]  Council on Farm Relations, this is their plan, we've got 80 days left to stop it.
[17:52.040 --> 17:53.040]  What are you going to do?
[17:53.040 --> 18:21.280]  I'm serious folks, this is the time to save the country.
[18:23.680 --> 18:27.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[18:29.280 --> 18:34.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[18:34.880 --> 18:37.520]  So here's the Rockefeller Foundation 2010.
[18:38.480 --> 18:41.760]  Under the guise of a pandemic, we will create a prison state.
[18:42.400 --> 18:43.040]  Close quote.
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.920]  Here's another quote, a world of tighter top-down government control
[18:47.920 --> 18:53.680]  and more authoritarian leadership with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback.
[18:54.640 --> 19:01.520]  You know, just the main synopsis document is five pages long, but it's linked to several
[19:01.520 --> 19:04.720]  hundred pages that I read more than a decade ago.
[19:05.280 --> 19:10.640]  This got picked up and put into reports with the headline flash mobs and brain ships,
[19:10.640 --> 19:13.040]  a grim vision of the future of the London Guardian.
[19:13.840 --> 19:16.320]  And the British Ministry of Defense put out a similar report.
[19:16.320 --> 19:21.200]  This is the plan.
[19:22.800 --> 19:24.960]  And so people ask, hey, what's it like?
[19:26.400 --> 19:34.240]  What's it like to be made fun of by all the major nighttime comic shows?
[19:34.240 --> 19:38.480]  What's it like to have them edit videos of you and make it the number one thing on Twitter?
[19:38.480 --> 19:42.880]  And the number one thing on Twitter yesterday was Alex Jones is a child molester.
[19:42.880 --> 19:48.320]  Alex Jones sent child porn to Sandy Hook families.
[19:48.320 --> 19:49.520]  That's totally not true.
[19:51.440 --> 19:54.560]  But that's my punishment for exposing these people.
[19:54.560 --> 19:56.720]  But that's okay, because did you hear?
[19:57.760 --> 20:02.560]  They predict you're going to end up waking up finally, but they're going to have combat robots.
[20:03.360 --> 20:06.720]  And you're not going to have any jobs or any land to farm on.
[20:06.720 --> 20:08.800]  So you won't know how to take care of yourself.
[20:08.800 --> 20:15.440]  And they're going to make you acquiesce to sterilization to even be able to get your food credit card.
[20:16.480 --> 20:18.480]  And you're going to have to take implantable chips.
[20:18.480 --> 20:22.720]  And then finally, they'll say, hey, if you want to live like a king for a year and travel the world,
[20:23.840 --> 20:27.760]  sign on to this agreement that you're going to euthanize yourself in one year.
[20:28.800 --> 20:30.000]  That's the official plan.
[20:30.000 --> 20:37.840]  And I sit here watching our free rich society destroyed and people think, hey, what's it like
[20:38.720 --> 20:41.440]  to be number one on Reddit and then lying about you and making fun of you?
[20:41.440 --> 20:44.960]  What's it like to be number one on Twitter with them lying about you and saying you're
[20:44.960 --> 20:45.920]  a child molester?
[20:45.920 --> 20:48.160]  Well, I'm exposing child molesters.
[20:48.160 --> 20:49.440]  What do you think they're going to do?
[20:51.680 --> 20:55.200]  It's like in the movies where they catch the bad guy finally and he goes, no, it's him.
[20:56.080 --> 20:57.280]  To whoever's busting them.
[20:57.280 --> 21:03.600]  I have integrity and I am proud to be number one on Twitter that I'm saying I'm a child molester.
[21:03.600 --> 21:08.480]  I am proud for them to say I'm a joke and a liar and Walter's soap check.
[21:08.480 --> 21:09.520]  I like Walter's soap check.
[21:10.080 --> 21:11.520]  At least he stands there for what he believes in.
[21:12.160 --> 21:17.280]  And so you're all going to see, it's all going to have, you're all going to get cancer.
[21:17.280 --> 21:19.280]  Your kids are all going to be mentally retarded.
[21:19.280 --> 21:22.640]  It's going to get so hellish that you'll finally won't be able to deny it.
[21:22.640 --> 21:27.920]  And by then you're going to be spiritually, culturally tied up in the back of the truck,
[21:27.920 --> 21:28.720]  going to the dungeon.
[21:30.960 --> 21:32.560]  And I'm not talking to our general audience.
[21:32.560 --> 21:36.480]  I'm talking to everybody that thinks all of this is so incredibly funny.
[21:39.120 --> 21:44.880]  So I can sit here and read to you the Belomel Indigates lockstep document or show you two
[21:44.880 --> 21:50.960]  days of the public war game they did with all the top globalists admitting the takeover
[21:50.960 --> 21:52.800]  and the social distancing and the lockdown.
[21:52.800 --> 21:58.720]  This is in October to November, two months, but they televised two days of it.
[21:58.720 --> 22:01.520]  I mean, I've sat there and watched most of the two days.
[22:01.520 --> 22:02.640]  You know what else I watched?
[22:02.640 --> 22:07.840]  Two days of the December 2nd, December 3rd, UN meeting in Switzerland,
[22:11.680 --> 22:14.080]  where they admitted the vaccines don't work.
[22:14.080 --> 22:15.840]  We're giving them by Belomel Indigates.
[22:15.840 --> 22:17.680]  The doctors believe they're hurting people.
[22:17.680 --> 22:19.120]  The front line is wobbly.
[22:19.120 --> 22:21.360]  We can't cover this up anymore.
[22:22.880 --> 22:24.800]  The truth is it's all right there.
[22:25.600 --> 22:31.040]  And the truth is the Arnold Schwarzenegger's and people of the world, the governors,
[22:31.040 --> 22:33.760]  the minions, they know all this is real.
[22:33.760 --> 22:34.800]  They know what's happening.
[22:36.160 --> 22:38.160]  So they're out telling you, good job.
[22:38.160 --> 22:39.920]  You are not out on street.
[22:39.920 --> 22:41.120]  I am allowed to be out.
[22:41.120 --> 22:42.400]  You are not allowed to be.
[22:42.400 --> 22:43.760]  I live in big mansion.
[22:43.760 --> 22:44.800]  Stay in your house.
[22:44.800 --> 22:45.760]  Do as you at all.
[22:45.760 --> 22:50.000]  Because he was trained by Kurt Waldheim, the head of the United Nations,
[22:50.560 --> 22:52.480]  who was an SS officer.
[22:52.480 --> 22:53.360]  So was his father.
[22:55.760 --> 22:57.840]  And it's not that Nazis run the New World Order.
[22:59.760 --> 23:06.320]  It's that they are a good component of it and a spinoff of it.
[23:07.520 --> 23:09.840]  And so if you won't stand up for yourself,
[23:09.840 --> 23:15.680]  wolves are going to come in and take everything you've got ever had or ever will have.
[23:18.160 --> 23:19.920]  And so I know I'm right.
[23:19.920 --> 23:21.280]  I know what's coming next.
[23:21.920 --> 23:25.520]  I tell you what's coming next because it's all right here.
[23:26.880 --> 23:30.880]  And whether you're in Thailand or whether you're in Germany or whether you're in Canada
[23:30.880 --> 23:33.600]  or whether you're in the United States or Australia or New Zealand,
[23:33.600 --> 23:39.440]  this exact same systems are rolling out, but in New Zealand, in Australia and in Spain,
[23:39.440 --> 23:41.600]  they're a little ahead of us in New Zealand.
[23:41.600 --> 23:44.640]  Kids being taught they could never touch anyone again,
[23:44.640 --> 23:49.440]  being locked in plastic bubbles directly out of Alfred Tenze and Skinner and the rest of it.
[23:50.640 --> 23:52.640]  Restaurants doing it now, officially.
[23:52.640 --> 23:53.840]  It was a joke a few months ago.
[23:53.840 --> 23:54.640]  No, it wasn't.
[23:54.640 --> 23:58.320]  Now rock concerts, music concerts, where you're in cages.
[24:00.800 --> 24:02.160]  Nothing to do with viruses.
[24:02.160 --> 24:03.360]  Nothing to do with viruses.
[24:03.360 --> 24:05.840]  It's about trained to be led into cages.
[24:07.040 --> 24:10.000]  This isn't some little side thing.
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.760]  This is the carbon tax.
[24:11.760 --> 24:13.120]  This is the world government.
[24:14.000 --> 24:19.600]  This is teaching you that you can't ever use the national park or state park again,
[24:20.880 --> 24:25.760]  except by reservation because the globalists don't want you doing it.
[24:25.760 --> 24:28.880]  They're going to get rid of the international air travel like it was.
[24:28.880 --> 24:31.120]  They're going to get rid of the cruise ships.
[24:31.120 --> 24:33.680]  They're getting rid of all of it.
[24:35.600 --> 24:38.640]  This was just the process of getting you dumbed down and decadent
[24:39.680 --> 24:45.040]  and distracted, making it all a big wonderland, all a big party, just like the allegory of Pinocchio,
[24:45.840 --> 24:47.600]  where they need Pinocchio to become corrupt first.
[24:47.600 --> 24:48.720]  So they liquor him up.
[24:48.720 --> 24:51.360]  They have him rob, break some things, be a hooligan,
[24:51.360 --> 24:56.080]  and that turns them into a jackass so they can be loaded on a slave ship
[24:56.080 --> 25:02.000]  and taken to a mine on an island to be prisoners.
[25:02.000 --> 25:08.320]  And now we're turning into the jackass, led by jackasses,
[25:10.400 --> 25:13.760]  and we're being taken to that prison island right now.
[25:16.240 --> 25:23.360]  So I hope everyone enjoys it because they need you to
[25:23.360 --> 25:26.320]  metaphysically comply, and so it goes like this.
[25:29.040 --> 25:32.400]  Only a 15-day lockdown to keep the hospitals clear.
[25:32.400 --> 25:33.360]  That was a lie.
[25:33.360 --> 25:38.400]  Only a month long of mask, only a six-month, only a two-year.
[25:38.400 --> 25:42.160]  Oh, sorry, now they've got to wear them forever, Fauci in the U.N. says.
[25:42.160 --> 25:44.720]  Oh, you've got to have contact tracers at your house to come visit you.
[25:44.720 --> 25:48.320]  And yeah, we've got to break families up, already being beta tested in Spain
[25:48.320 --> 25:51.520]  and in Australia and in England and in New Zealand.
[25:51.520 --> 25:53.040]  Total lockdowns.
[25:53.040 --> 25:54.880]  Oh, sorry, you have to stay in your house for months.
[25:54.880 --> 25:55.760]  We'll bring you food.
[25:56.400 --> 26:01.040]  You're being taught how obsolete you are, how non-essential.
[26:01.040 --> 26:02.960]  Non-essential means obsolete.
[26:03.920 --> 26:04.960]  You are obsolete.
[26:11.760 --> 26:16.000]  You've positioned yourself with no bargaining chips and then the inoculations,
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.280]  which they say aren't forced, but if you want a job or to fly on a plane
[26:19.280 --> 26:20.880]  or get on a bus, you got to have it.
[26:20.880 --> 26:25.040]  So next before that is the bracelets and the tracking option.
[26:25.040 --> 26:26.400]  Oh, getting your temperature checked.
[26:26.400 --> 26:28.960]  Oh, you've got a bracelet you've been tested for COVID.
[26:28.960 --> 26:30.240]  Oh, you've had your temperature checked.
[26:30.240 --> 26:33.440]  You're all suspect and it sets up these internal checkpoints
[26:33.440 --> 26:37.760]  while the borders stay wide open and we're taught that white people are the devil
[26:37.760 --> 26:40.480]  and they've got to be sent to, quote, reeducation camps.
[26:40.480 --> 26:43.280]  They call it that name when it's a three-day brainwashing,
[26:43.280 --> 26:45.600]  getting you ready for the real reeducation camps.
[26:46.160 --> 26:48.320]  So they talk about overthrowing Trump at the military.
[26:48.320 --> 26:49.440]  They're very serious.
[26:49.440 --> 26:53.280]  They just say it and say it to condition you because you'll put up with anything.
[26:59.440 --> 27:00.080]  You hear that?
[27:01.360 --> 27:06.160]  That's the march of the United Nations and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[27:07.200 --> 27:11.520]  coming with their battle plan, psychological warfare operation
[27:11.520 --> 27:14.880]  with the forced inoculations and the permanent lockdown
[27:15.600 --> 27:17.520]  of civilization and society.
[27:17.520 --> 27:20.320]  They're outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu.
[27:21.120 --> 27:24.560]  They're creating artificial phobias for normal death that takes place.
[27:24.560 --> 27:26.880]  They're not even promising to have a cure to it all.
[27:26.880 --> 27:31.920]  They're just inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary regime
[27:31.920 --> 27:37.840]  directed by the WHO with vaccines that actually change your DNA
[27:37.840 --> 27:40.160]  and make you owned by Microsoft.
[27:40.800 --> 27:42.080]  It's a final frontier.
[27:43.120 --> 27:44.480]  It's the year 2020.
[27:44.480 --> 27:46.960]  Yeah, it's not coming.
[27:47.920 --> 27:50.880]  It's here and submission is blood in the water.
[27:54.320 --> 27:58.160]  Attention, attention, attention to anyone that still wants to live
[27:58.160 --> 27:59.440]  in a free country.
[27:59.440 --> 28:02.480]  The New World Order, CHICOM Globalist Syndicate
[28:02.480 --> 28:04.880]  is making its move to implode the dollar
[28:04.880 --> 28:09.280]  and thrust the United States into a civil war by contesting the election.
[28:09.280 --> 28:13.040]  They are openly war-gaming this at the highest levels of democratic party.
[28:13.040 --> 28:15.840]  Nancy Pelosi and others have gone on television and said
[28:15.840 --> 28:17.520]  they will contest the election.
[28:17.520 --> 28:18.400]  Trump is going.
[28:18.400 --> 28:22.800]  They will hold a separate inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris.
[28:22.800 --> 28:25.440]  And that anyone challenging that will be called a racist.
[28:25.440 --> 28:27.920]  They will then trigger race riots and violence.
[28:27.920 --> 28:30.400]  They've already beta tested around the country.
[28:31.040 --> 28:33.040]  We are not living in normal times.
[28:33.680 --> 28:35.520]  When these type of things happen in history,
[28:35.520 --> 28:38.560]  people are usually caught flat-footed because they can't believe
[28:38.560 --> 28:41.200]  they're living in such a criminal era.
[28:41.200 --> 28:42.080]  We are.
[28:42.080 --> 28:44.960]  We are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate
[28:44.960 --> 28:48.320]  that's been feeding on America is being exposed and removed.
[28:48.320 --> 28:51.920]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country.
[28:51.920 --> 28:53.520]  Spread the word now, Paul Reverez.
[28:59.120 --> 28:59.760]  You hear that?
[29:00.960 --> 29:02.880]  That's the march of the United Nations
[29:04.160 --> 29:05.840]  and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[29:06.880 --> 29:11.200]  Coming with their battle plan, psychological warfare operation
[29:11.200 --> 29:14.560]  with the forced inoculations and the permanent lockdown
[29:15.280 --> 29:17.200]  of civilization and society.
[29:17.200 --> 29:20.000]  They're outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu.
[29:20.720 --> 29:24.240]  They're creating artificial phobias for normal death that takes place.
[29:24.240 --> 29:26.560]  They're not even promising to have a cure to it all.
[29:26.560 --> 29:31.600]  They're just inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary regime
[29:31.600 --> 29:37.520]  directed by the WHO with vaccines that actually change your DNA
[29:37.520 --> 29:39.760]  and make you owned by Microsoft.
[29:39.760 --> 29:41.680]  It's a final frontier.
[29:42.720 --> 29:44.080]  It's the year 2020.
[29:45.440 --> 29:46.560]  It's not coming.
[29:46.560 --> 30:13.920]  It's here and submission is blood in the water.
[30:13.920 --> 30:17.440]  From Operation Lockstep, Bronco Thunder Foundation, 2010.
[30:19.520 --> 30:23.280]  Quote, under the guise of a pandemic, we will create a present state.
[30:24.800 --> 30:27.280]  A world of tighter top-down government control
[30:27.840 --> 30:30.480]  and more authoritarian leadership with limited innovation
[30:30.480 --> 30:32.400]  and growing citizen pushback.
[30:35.760 --> 30:37.440]  It's only a five-page synopsis.
[30:37.440 --> 30:38.240]  You might want to go read it.
[30:38.240 --> 30:39.680]  Just type in Operation Lockstep.
[30:39.680 --> 30:46.000]  And Operation Lockstep is the directive to the Rockefeller-Ford Carnegie
[30:46.000 --> 30:49.040]  endowments that Bill and Melinda Gates takes directives from.
[30:49.040 --> 30:50.000]  By the way, that's on record.
[30:50.000 --> 30:54.560]  I can play with the galas where they have the Rockefeller and Ford Foundation events.
[30:55.440 --> 30:57.840]  And they think Bill and Melinda Gates and they say,
[30:57.840 --> 31:00.880]  thank you for your World Depopulation Fund.
[31:00.880 --> 31:04.240]  And they all clap because their funds actually technically named
[31:04.240 --> 31:09.680]  World Population Control Fund.
[31:09.680 --> 31:14.560]  And again, I can play you all these movies and TV shows, fiction, nonfiction,
[31:14.560 --> 31:15.600]  how humans are bad.
[31:15.600 --> 31:16.640]  Let's get rid of everybody.
[31:17.280 --> 31:20.960]  But as soon as you talk to a Bill Maher who says he wants to get rid of the population,
[31:20.960 --> 31:23.040]  more death, more suicide, get the highway moving.
[31:24.320 --> 31:25.360]  Well, do you want to die?
[31:25.920 --> 31:27.520]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[31:27.520 --> 31:28.720]  He means you need to die.
[31:28.720 --> 31:32.560]  There's a popular comedian.
[31:32.560 --> 31:35.840]  I sent Daria a clip of this few days and we never played it.
[31:36.800 --> 31:40.320]  He was on Joe Rogan's show, but he was talking about depopulation.
[31:41.760 --> 31:44.880]  I want to find that maybe play that next segment because it's all so cute.
[31:44.880 --> 31:46.800]  It's all so funny until it's you.
[31:46.800 --> 31:48.640]  Let me explain something about population.
[31:50.640 --> 31:52.640]  And Prager University does great analysis of this.
[31:52.640 --> 31:53.680]  It's 100% accurate.
[31:53.680 --> 32:02.080]  But if you're in the ocean, you could swim or with a submarine.
[32:06.640 --> 32:10.800]  And you could go sometimes 100 miles along a coastline
[32:12.000 --> 32:16.000]  before you run into some coral reef or a wreck ship or something.
[32:16.000 --> 32:17.600]  And as soon as you go up that wreck ship,
[32:17.600 --> 32:25.920]  you will see thousands of fish everywhere and stingrays and sharks.
[32:28.160 --> 32:33.440]  I've got a little lake house and the neighbor goes and he just doesn't put Christmas trees
[32:33.440 --> 32:33.920]  in the water.
[32:33.920 --> 32:36.320]  He just goes and puts post in the water.
[32:37.200 --> 32:41.040]  And then we cast out to those posts 20 yards out and catch bass
[32:41.040 --> 32:43.440]  because the bass just liked to be around the post.
[32:43.440 --> 32:46.400]  And see, that's the thing about population.
[32:48.080 --> 32:53.120]  You can get in your car and you can drive in parts of America for five hours
[32:53.120 --> 32:55.040]  and not see another person when you take a side road.
[32:55.760 --> 32:56.640]  You take the main road.
[32:56.640 --> 32:57.760]  Yeah, you'll see cars here and there.
[32:57.760 --> 33:00.960]  But as far as I could see, you won't see a house maybe for an hour.
[33:03.120 --> 33:08.320]  Now, is India overpopulated or areas of Africa overpopulated or areas of Latin America overpopulated?
[33:08.320 --> 33:12.160]  Is there an issue of people having 10 kids and then not having jobs in the future?
[33:12.160 --> 33:14.160]  Absolutely.
[33:17.840 --> 33:20.880]  But if you industrialize, people have less than two children on average
[33:22.240 --> 33:23.520]  and things clean up very quickly.
[33:24.000 --> 33:27.120]  But the globalists have denied the industrialization of the third world
[33:27.120 --> 33:28.800]  in their own admissions to control them.
[33:28.800 --> 33:31.440]  So I've studied the arguments of Bill Gates.
[33:31.440 --> 33:39.760]  I've studied the arguments of Thomas Watson and the Cold Spring and Tarber.
[33:39.760 --> 33:41.760]  And I've read their writings.
[33:41.760 --> 33:46.960]  And to them, it's an excuse for power and control over life and death.
[33:46.960 --> 33:51.040]  It's not about building people up and empowering them and giving them money
[33:51.040 --> 33:53.360]  and convincing them not to have more than two kids.
[33:53.360 --> 33:58.080]  It's about dumbing people down, the fluoride in the water, the GMOs,
[33:58.080 --> 34:00.320]  the vaccines that are designed to lower IQ.
[34:00.320 --> 34:02.560]  And then I can show you where they admit.
[34:02.560 --> 34:06.400]  Bertrand Russell and others saying, we're going to put fluoride in the water
[34:06.400 --> 34:09.040]  and we're going to put chemicals and vaccines to lower IQ.
[34:09.040 --> 34:16.800]  He said this in the 40s, he won international prizes for it, putting Nobel of memory serves.
[34:17.760 --> 34:22.800]  He proposed setting up a world government and nuking cities to depopulate
[34:23.440 --> 34:28.400]  and then to never have war after the world government carries out a nuking process
[34:28.400 --> 34:30.640]  to get rid of 90% of the population.
[34:30.640 --> 34:36.240]  And the left, one time, Rick Linkletter was at my office and he's a nice guy,
[34:36.240 --> 34:39.280]  an intellectual liberal, you know, at a certain level.
[34:39.280 --> 34:41.200]  And Rick's defended me when I've been attacked by everybody else.
[34:41.200 --> 34:44.400]  I don't want to, but he goes, you read Bertrand Russell and he got the book.
[34:44.400 --> 34:46.800]  He's like, he's the greatest liberal ever.
[34:46.800 --> 34:51.360]  I'm like, did you read where he said set up world government
[34:51.360 --> 34:52.960]  and kill almost everybody to end war?
[34:52.960 --> 34:56.560]  And he goes, Rick's like, well, I have seen some of those writings.
[34:56.560 --> 34:57.440]  Very interesting.
[34:57.440 --> 34:59.200]  You know, I've got to get going.
[34:59.200 --> 35:06.240]  I said, my office or his office?
[35:06.240 --> 35:07.280]  I don't, I just remember that.
[35:08.160 --> 35:09.520]  Maybe I pulled it off his shelf.
[35:10.080 --> 35:16.160]  The point is, is that this is so mainstream folks and you just don't read it.
[35:17.840 --> 35:20.880]  But J. Dyer is coming up in the fourth hour.
[35:20.880 --> 35:21.760]  He's a smart guy.
[35:21.760 --> 35:23.200]  He goes and reads this stuff.
[35:23.200 --> 35:23.920]  I've gotten more.
[35:23.920 --> 35:25.760]  I can't even read it anymore than new stuff.
[35:25.760 --> 35:26.640]  I should be.
[35:26.640 --> 35:29.120]  He was reading the head of the debuts group book from two years ago.
[35:29.120 --> 35:32.960]  Admitting all of this even worse, how humans will be obsolete,
[35:33.520 --> 35:36.160]  how the robots are going to take over, how they're doing it on purpose.
[35:38.720 --> 35:42.880]  And I'm sitting here asking everyone, do you really want to go through this?
[35:45.520 --> 35:50.080]  And then I watched them take state and federal parks and they're doing it all over Europe.
[35:50.960 --> 35:54.880]  And in Paul watching an article about how they're really shutting down freedom and how
[35:54.880 --> 35:56.480]  they're shutting down parks around the world.
[35:56.480 --> 35:57.680]  Now it's very, very serious.
[35:57.680 --> 36:00.160]  And the commenters are all like, yeah, I'm in Spain.
[36:00.160 --> 36:01.280]  Yeah, I'm in Japan.
[36:01.280 --> 36:02.160]  Yeah, I'm in Canada.
[36:02.160 --> 36:03.520]  Hey, I'm out in Colorado.
[36:03.520 --> 36:06.240]  Yeah, they just shut down the whole national park here and said,
[36:06.240 --> 36:08.240]  you can't come in or you got to get a reservation.
[36:08.240 --> 36:10.320]  And then they're turning back 90% of people.
[36:12.320 --> 36:15.200]  I mean, they're having open world government summits.
[36:18.160 --> 36:21.520]  And saying COVID-19 is the way for world government.
[36:21.520 --> 36:23.600]  It's being openly announced.
[36:23.600 --> 36:28.880]  And so I show up at the park, huge park, Greenbelt, hundreds of square miles,
[36:28.880 --> 36:32.320]  where my wife was told she had to be out, couldn't come in there.
[36:32.320 --> 36:35.680]  And I watched them turn away families that didn't work, told it was closed,
[36:35.680 --> 36:38.720]  with little snot-nosed teenagers going, yeah, yeah, he's closed.
[36:38.720 --> 36:40.400]  You have to get a reservation and it's full.
[36:41.120 --> 36:42.880]  I go there, get in their face, explain it.
[36:42.880 --> 36:44.080]  The police go, he's right.
[36:44.080 --> 36:45.280]  You can't stop people.
[36:45.280 --> 36:47.840]  There's actually not a law because somebody pointed out it was calling a law.
[36:47.840 --> 36:48.960]  That's a huge victory.
[36:48.960 --> 36:51.920]  Twitter edged it down to one minute and said,
[36:51.920 --> 36:54.080]  I just came and screamed at innocent people.
[36:54.080 --> 36:56.320]  No, they went and hid after they yelled at me.
[36:56.320 --> 36:57.840]  I walked through, they yelled at me.
[36:57.840 --> 37:01.040]  They say you're not allowed to know the park's full.
[37:01.040 --> 37:03.840]  And then I went and showed families being turned away by them.
[37:03.840 --> 37:05.520]  Seven cop cars show up.
[37:05.520 --> 37:07.280]  They go, Alex is right.
[37:07.280 --> 37:08.960]  This is unenforceable.
[37:08.960 --> 37:10.320]  You guys can't be doing this.
[37:10.320 --> 37:13.440]  And the police on video order them out.
[37:14.320 --> 37:15.840]  And that's in my full report.
[37:15.840 --> 37:17.600]  They say, hey, you guys out of here.
[37:17.600 --> 37:21.040]  But what do you do when you're Austin American Statement?
[37:21.040 --> 37:22.000]  You murdered truth.
[37:22.560 --> 37:26.800]  So they put out the lie yesterday morning with the edited video promoted.
[37:26.800 --> 37:28.000]  It was pushed.
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.520]  It's on national TV as well.
[37:29.520 --> 37:31.680]  Eight plus million views on Twitter.
[37:31.680 --> 37:32.720]  Number one on Twitter.
[37:33.920 --> 37:38.720]  Jones is Walter's show pick from the big Lebowski.
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.480]  He just randomly shows up for no reason.
[37:44.480 --> 37:49.760]  For no reason and yells at people who flip him off.
[37:49.760 --> 37:52.080]  No, when you hear on the audio, I walk by.
[37:53.680 --> 37:54.480]  I was going to ignore him.
[37:54.480 --> 37:56.240]  But as you go, hey, what are you doing?
[37:57.280 --> 37:58.160]  You got to pass.
[38:01.440 --> 38:03.840]  And the city's proposed charging for the green belt.
[38:03.840 --> 38:06.160]  That's what this is all the beginning of them taking control.
[38:09.520 --> 38:12.960]  And they put snot nose teenagers who were laughing at me.
[38:12.960 --> 38:15.120]  And I hear him go F you.
[38:15.120 --> 38:16.960]  Then I'd walk over and say, you got a problem.
[38:16.960 --> 38:17.600]  Nothing.
[38:17.600 --> 38:18.240]  Leave me alone.
[38:18.880 --> 38:21.680]  And I'm like, oh, it's so pathetic.
[38:21.680 --> 38:24.960]  But that's the United Nations telling me,
[38:24.960 --> 38:27.040]  you care to have a medical doctor on your show.
[38:27.040 --> 38:30.080]  Saying hydroxychloroquine treated 1,000 patients perfectly.
[38:30.080 --> 38:30.720]  You're banned.
[38:31.280 --> 38:32.240]  Doctors can't speak.
[38:32.240 --> 38:35.120]  UN says, we're taking over this land.
[38:35.120 --> 38:38.080]  UN says, we're in control of your medical system.
[38:38.080 --> 38:39.840]  UN says, we're in control of your carbon.
[38:39.840 --> 38:43.680]  UN says, UN says, UN says, UN says, UN says.
[38:43.680 --> 38:45.760]  See the UN takeovers here.
[38:45.760 --> 38:47.360]  And it was never going to be blue helmets.
[38:49.280 --> 38:50.400]  It's bureaucracy.
[38:50.400 --> 38:52.960]  And they take control of your police and your government
[38:52.960 --> 38:54.400]  with a strong cities initiative.
[38:55.120 --> 38:57.360]  And they render your federal government obsolete
[38:57.360 --> 39:00.160]  because the states and counties and cities
[39:00.160 --> 39:01.040]  are under their control.
[39:01.040 --> 39:02.160]  What do the globalists always say?
[39:02.160 --> 39:03.120]  What do liberals say?
[39:03.120 --> 39:05.680]  Let's say they say all politics is local.
[39:05.680 --> 39:09.120]  Seek globally, act locally.
[39:09.920 --> 39:11.600]  They run all the cities.
[39:12.160 --> 39:13.360]  They run the schools.
[39:13.360 --> 39:14.560]  They run your children.
[39:14.560 --> 39:15.920]  They run the drug companies.
[39:15.920 --> 39:17.040]  They run the media.
[39:17.040 --> 39:18.960]  And now they're mopping up everything
[39:19.520 --> 39:22.240]  and taking all the resources and all the freedom away.
[39:22.240 --> 39:24.640]  And they got all the useful idiot followers
[39:24.640 --> 39:26.160]  loving the end of their freedom
[39:26.160 --> 39:28.400]  because they believe they're part of some great thing
[39:28.400 --> 39:30.720]  for the environment when the globalist end game
[39:30.720 --> 39:32.720]  is not just to overwrite humans,
[39:32.720 --> 39:34.560]  but all carbon-based life forms
[39:34.560 --> 39:39.120]  and build a new planet of new life where they will be gods.
[39:39.680 --> 39:42.400]  Their plan is to kill every whale, every monkey,
[39:42.400 --> 39:46.640]  every bird, every bacteria and be omnipresent God.
[39:46.640 --> 39:49.680]  Their plan is total alien extermination
[39:49.680 --> 39:50.800]  of all life on earth.
[39:51.360 --> 39:53.200]  Their leader is known as Satan.
[39:53.200 --> 39:56.640]  When the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden
[39:56.640 --> 40:00.480]  two years ago, they knew he had serious cognitive problems.
[40:00.480 --> 40:04.080]  He has always been an empty suit that does what he's told
[40:04.080 --> 40:07.200]  by the globalist and their allied crime syndicates.
[40:07.200 --> 40:10.400]  Kamala Harris is even worse than does whatever she's told.
[40:10.400 --> 40:13.120]  She's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley,
[40:13.120 --> 40:14.880]  the Chycoms and others.
[40:14.880 --> 40:19.280]  So she has been chosen because she's part African.
[40:19.280 --> 40:21.600]  And now anyone that criticizes her
[40:21.600 --> 40:23.760]  will be called a racist and evil
[40:23.760 --> 40:25.920]  and she is now above reproach.
[40:25.920 --> 40:29.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose this monster
[40:29.520 --> 40:30.800]  for who she is.
[40:30.800 --> 40:33.840]  We must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences
[40:33.840 --> 40:36.800]  for black people three times longer than white people
[40:36.800 --> 40:39.280]  and that the woman is a monster.
[40:39.280 --> 40:42.240]  Kamala Harris will end up being our president
[40:42.240 --> 40:44.160]  if they're able to steal the election.
[40:44.160 --> 40:48.160]  And she is a 110% new world order puppet.
[40:48.160 --> 40:50.880]  Now more than ever, we must expose this monster.
[40:50.880 --> 41:18.880]  We must expose the globalist.
[41:20.880 --> 41:23.680]  And the global social credit score now being rolled out
[41:23.680 --> 41:26.080]  by Virginia, California and others.
[41:26.080 --> 41:26.720]  It's not coming.
[41:26.720 --> 41:27.600]  It's here.
[41:27.600 --> 41:29.360]  And then the inoculations.
[41:29.360 --> 41:30.800]  If you ever want to leave your house,
[41:30.800 --> 41:33.280]  which amounts to forced inoculations.
[41:33.280 --> 41:35.840]  This is the medical tyranny takeover.
[41:35.840 --> 41:38.640]  These are not classic vaccines that have their own problems.
[41:38.640 --> 41:41.680]  These are DNA vaccines that change your DNA
[41:41.680 --> 41:44.880]  and are having massive serious side effects.
[41:44.880 --> 41:47.440]  Guaranteed this is about depopulation.
[41:47.440 --> 41:50.160]  Bill Gates admits that this is an emergency.
[41:50.160 --> 41:51.520]  Resist or die.
[41:51.520 --> 41:54.560]  The new world order is here.
[41:54.560 --> 41:57.520]  The United Nations and the National Institutes of Health
[41:57.520 --> 42:03.120]  with the CDC are publicly conducting a 4,000 person study
[42:03.120 --> 42:06.000]  spending tens of millions of dollars at Yale
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.480]  on 15 ways to brainwash the public into taking inoculations.
[42:10.480 --> 42:13.040]  Basically squeezing you and forcing you to take them
[42:13.040 --> 42:15.120]  through guilt, through fines,
[42:15.120 --> 42:16.880]  through not being able to go into stores,
[42:16.880 --> 42:19.120]  not being able to get on airplanes or have jobs.
[42:19.120 --> 42:21.600]  This is forced inoculations.
[42:21.600 --> 42:22.640]  It's public.
[42:22.640 --> 42:24.640]  Gateway pundit wrote about it last week.
[42:24.640 --> 42:26.560]  David Knight wrote about it this week.
[42:26.560 --> 42:28.720]  Stories up on infowars.com.
[42:28.720 --> 42:30.400]  So people say, oh, I'll just wear a mask.
[42:31.200 --> 42:32.160]  It's never going to end.
[42:32.800 --> 42:34.800]  That's just the sign of submission.
[42:35.520 --> 42:37.840]  Fauci admits that next is the contact tracing
[42:37.840 --> 42:41.200]  of the apps on your phones and the inoculations
[42:41.200 --> 42:44.560]  that is a DNA vaccine that changes your DNA.
[42:44.560 --> 42:46.480]  This isn't a science fiction movie.
[42:46.480 --> 42:48.480]  It's happening right now.
[42:48.480 --> 42:50.000]  Compliance is death.
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.840]  Compliance is annihilation.
[42:51.840 --> 42:53.360]  Wake up. Wake up.
[42:55.200 --> 42:58.400]  How do you contest an election in the year 2020?
[42:58.400 --> 43:00.880]  Well, you trigger race riots
[43:01.520 --> 43:04.080]  and you tell the blue states and blue cities
[43:04.080 --> 43:05.600]  when you're the speaker of the house
[43:05.600 --> 43:07.840]  that you are legitimately now the president.
[43:07.840 --> 43:09.920]  That's what she's said on CBS News.
[43:10.480 --> 43:13.600]  And then you're going to have those blue states secede.
[43:13.600 --> 43:17.440]  Yes, that's officially called a civil war, ladies and gentlemen.
[43:17.440 --> 43:19.600]  And the Democrats are backed by the EU, Hollywood,
[43:19.600 --> 43:21.920]  the chai comms, and the whole globalist system.
[43:21.920 --> 43:24.320]  This is treason with a capital T.
[43:24.320 --> 43:27.200]  And our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards
[43:27.200 --> 43:29.920]  they won't even stand up against it and do anything
[43:29.920 --> 43:32.000]  even though our president has been exposing it.
[43:32.000 --> 43:33.440]  But here's the bottom line.
[43:33.440 --> 43:34.480]  You need storeable food.
[43:34.480 --> 43:37.120]  We've got the best quality ready to ship to you right now.
[43:37.120 --> 43:39.920]  Two to four week delivery with 80 days out from the election.
[43:39.920 --> 43:42.160]  You need to get high quality storeable food right now.
[43:42.160 --> 43:44.160]  In case they are able to pull this off,
[43:44.160 --> 43:46.320]  we're going to have a great depression war on the streets
[43:46.320 --> 43:48.320]  that will make a road warrior look like a cake walk.
[43:48.320 --> 43:49.920]  Get your high quality storeable foods now
[43:49.920 --> 43:53.040]  and get ready and get prepared at infowarstore.com.
[43:53.040 --> 43:53.680]  Get prepared.
[43:57.840 --> 44:05.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:12.560 --> 44:13.600]  We are on the march.
[44:13.600 --> 44:16.480]  But the globalists are counter striking right now.
[44:17.280 --> 44:19.200]  The empire has struck back.
[44:19.200 --> 44:20.320]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[44:21.920 --> 44:24.720]  And I didn't quite explain what I was getting into last segment.
[44:24.720 --> 44:25.920]  So some of you might not have got it.
[44:27.520 --> 44:29.600]  Cities are like coral reefs in the ocean.
[44:30.240 --> 44:31.120]  The humans are there.
[44:31.120 --> 44:32.640]  You go there because there's the business.
[44:32.640 --> 44:33.360]  There's the jobs.
[44:33.360 --> 44:34.880]  There's the concentration of people.
[44:35.600 --> 44:37.520]  So there's more opportunity on average.
[44:38.240 --> 44:40.480]  But then you always have parasites that move in,
[44:40.480 --> 44:42.000]  corrupt governments that move in,
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.640]  start taxing the wealth,
[44:44.640 --> 44:46.480]  and then drive people out of the city,
[44:46.480 --> 44:47.840]  and it falls apart.
[44:47.840 --> 44:50.240]  The same thing happens in nations or cultures or systems.
[44:51.600 --> 44:53.120]  Many times civilizations didn't fall
[44:53.120 --> 44:54.640]  because of environmental issues.
[44:54.640 --> 44:56.960]  They fell because of the ruling establishment
[44:58.320 --> 45:00.400]  was so decadent, so inbred, and so insane.
[45:01.360 --> 45:03.280]  And so it's just like coral reefs in the ocean.
[45:03.280 --> 45:06.000]  You can go hundreds of miles and not see coral reefs
[45:06.000 --> 45:07.600]  and not see hardly any fish.
[45:07.600 --> 45:09.040]  But suddenly you get near a coral reef,
[45:09.040 --> 45:10.080]  it's got fish everywhere.
[45:10.080 --> 45:12.640]  That's how population works.
[45:13.920 --> 45:16.800]  Now, it's true that modern civilization
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.520]  is like humans going to Mars in a year-long mission.
[45:22.400 --> 45:23.280]  And when you get there,
[45:23.280 --> 45:24.960]  even somebody that could run marathons
[45:26.400 --> 45:27.760]  is going to have trouble walking
[45:27.760 --> 45:29.600]  and is going to have serious trouble breathing
[45:29.600 --> 45:31.440]  even in the reduced gravity of Mars.
[45:33.440 --> 45:36.240]  Well, that's what modern civilization's like.
[45:36.240 --> 45:38.560]  Yeah, we got antibiotics to stop a lot of bugs,
[45:38.560 --> 45:40.400]  but we're really weak now,
[45:40.400 --> 45:41.920]  and it kills our normal flora,
[45:41.920 --> 45:43.760]  and so we get cancer more often,
[45:43.760 --> 45:45.680]  and now the antibiotics aren't working.
[45:46.960 --> 45:49.360]  But that was all the parallel of regular science,
[45:49.360 --> 45:52.080]  hit or miss, a pro-human future being built.
[45:53.520 --> 45:54.800]  But the robber barons,
[45:54.800 --> 45:56.800]  going back about 150 years ago,
[45:56.800 --> 45:59.920]  openly began to research the science of population control,
[45:59.920 --> 46:01.680]  and so they've had the parallel of that
[46:02.720 --> 46:04.000]  building next to us,
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.840]  and now with computers they're able,
[46:05.840 --> 46:10.320]  and automation, to supplant humans and really control us
[46:10.320 --> 46:11.440]  and track us,
[46:11.440 --> 46:13.920]  and so now the old track of the Renaissance,
[46:13.920 --> 46:18.400]  the pro-human future, is being degraded and shut down,
[46:18.400 --> 46:20.240]  and we're being forced over onto the new track.
[46:20.880 --> 46:23.040]  Now, it's true, the Renaissance
[46:23.040 --> 46:24.960]  that's set up by incredibly altruistic,
[46:24.960 --> 46:27.760]  hardcore, god-fearing visionaries,
[46:28.720 --> 46:29.920]  like our forefathers,
[46:31.520 --> 46:33.920]  and other visionaries that didn't believe in the same God,
[46:33.920 --> 46:38.800]  but were visionaries, they can speak five, six, seven languages,
[46:39.760 --> 46:41.520]  they believed in human empowerment,
[46:42.080 --> 46:43.920]  but they knew that it would create a large yes,
[46:43.920 --> 46:44.960]  it would create a lot of money,
[46:44.960 --> 46:48.320]  and a lot of diversions, and a lot of corrupt culture,
[46:48.320 --> 46:50.640]  and that we would go into a decadent cycle,
[46:50.640 --> 46:52.080]  and corruption would set back in,
[46:52.080 --> 46:54.240]  so they created separation of powers
[46:54.240 --> 46:58.800]  to try to stop dictatorship and or mob rule.
[46:58.800 --> 47:00.400]  We're also a republic to stop that,
[47:00.400 --> 47:04.480]  but the nation's almost 250 years old,
[47:05.280 --> 47:06.400]  we're facing the same disease
[47:06.400 --> 47:08.480]  as every other successful wealthy nation,
[47:09.680 --> 47:12.080]  and the so-called guardians of humanity,
[47:12.080 --> 47:13.760]  the guardians of the galaxy,
[47:13.760 --> 47:15.840]  are transhumanists that believe they're fallen,
[47:15.840 --> 47:18.240]  we're fallen, we're broken, they hate themselves,
[47:18.240 --> 47:20.000]  they hate us even more,
[47:20.000 --> 47:21.840]  and they're projecting their hate onto us,
[47:21.840 --> 47:23.920]  and so they want to overwrite the whole planet
[47:23.920 --> 47:27.360]  in a mad dash of wanting godhood and life extension,
[47:27.360 --> 47:29.600]  and by not caring and hating the earth,
[47:29.600 --> 47:30.480]  and hating themselves,
[47:30.480 --> 47:32.320]  and believing they're going to only become powerful
[47:32.320 --> 47:35.280]  by giving up their humanity, they have no guilt,
[47:36.960 --> 47:38.480]  and no care about what happens to others,
[47:38.480 --> 47:40.400]  because it's survival of the fittest,
[47:40.400 --> 47:42.720]  you deserve what's happening to you,
[47:43.680 --> 47:45.440]  because you bought into their lie,
[47:46.080 --> 47:47.840]  but that's why they've always got to tell you
[47:47.840 --> 47:48.800]  they're lying to you,
[47:48.800 --> 47:51.040]  and they've got to trick you into giving up your free will,
[47:51.040 --> 47:53.680]  because metaphysically, there is a law of the universe,
[47:53.680 --> 47:55.680]  that if someone doesn't do something of their free will,
[47:55.680 --> 47:56.880]  even if you trick them,
[47:56.880 --> 48:01.040]  then you, karmically, or re-put you so, it comes back on you,
[48:02.320 --> 48:05.440]  but if you can trick someone, they believe it doesn't,
[48:05.440 --> 48:08.320]  and of course it really does, just not as a media,
[48:08.320 --> 48:10.160]  so they understand the laws of the universe,
[48:10.160 --> 48:12.160]  but only so far.
[48:16.320 --> 48:20.000]  So the mainline religion is now a post-humanist extermination,
[48:20.000 --> 48:21.760]  and it's all the headlines everywhere,
[48:21.760 --> 48:23.440]  and that's the big issue,
[48:23.440 --> 48:25.040]  looking forward to the end of humanity,
[48:25.040 --> 48:27.360]  looking forward to the end of humanity, Wall Street Journal,
[48:27.360 --> 48:29.120]  the world without humans, New York Times,
[48:29.120 --> 48:30.960]  how beautiful it will be, how great it will be,
[48:30.960 --> 48:32.640]  but really it's a bunch of evil people
[48:32.640 --> 48:34.560]  wanting to control the destiny of humanity,
[48:34.560 --> 48:36.080]  so they control our trajectory.
[48:36.960 --> 48:40.080]  They've decided the trajectory is nowhere,
[48:41.040 --> 48:43.120]  the most selfish, demonic thing you could ever imagine,
[48:43.120 --> 48:46.480]  but we, in the decadent cycle, they're making their move,
[48:46.480 --> 48:48.960]  are mesmerized and not aware of our potential,
[48:48.960 --> 48:50.960]  and think there's either no hope or we don't care.
[48:50.960 --> 48:56.080]  Now here's a little short report on Operation Lockstep,
[48:56.080 --> 48:59.360]  and the United Nations Rockefeller Operation
[48:59.360 --> 49:21.360]  being captained by Bill Gates, here it is.
[49:29.600 --> 49:33.360]  Under the guise of protecting us from this threat,
[49:33.360 --> 49:36.400]  they would be free to implement their final solution,
[49:36.400 --> 49:37.600]  a prison state.
[49:37.600 --> 49:40.800]  It's called Lockstep, a world of tighter,
[49:40.800 --> 49:45.600]  top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership
[49:45.600 --> 49:50.080]  with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback.
[49:50.080 --> 49:55.280]  In 2012, the pandemic that the world had been anticipating for years finally hit.
[49:55.280 --> 50:02.080]  Unlike 2009's H1N1, this new influenza strain
[50:02.080 --> 50:03.600]  originating from wild geese,
[50:03.600 --> 50:06.800]  even the most pandemic-prepared nations were quickly overwhelmed
[50:06.800 --> 50:09.040]  when the virus streaked around the world,
[50:09.040 --> 50:12.480]  infecting nearly 20% of the global population
[50:12.480 --> 50:16.240]  and killing 8 million in just seven months.
[50:16.240 --> 50:18.800]  The majority of them healthy young adults.
[50:18.800 --> 50:22.320]  The pandemic also had a deadly effect on economies.
[50:22.320 --> 50:31.120]  You can see the agenda, just naked, law-naked control agenda written down,
[50:31.120 --> 50:35.680]  and it's anybody's guess how this becomes effectuated in real life.
[50:35.680 --> 50:40.160]  So whether this is written specifically as marching orders
[50:40.160 --> 50:42.560]  or whether people have taken upon themselves
[50:42.560 --> 50:44.480]  in their intelligence networks to say,
[50:44.480 --> 50:47.280]  okay, well, this has been produced, so this is the plan here.
[50:47.280 --> 50:49.760]  But these narratives have to be written in advance.
[50:49.760 --> 50:52.880]  Okay, the pandemic also had a deadly effect on economics.
[50:52.880 --> 50:57.520]  International mobility of both people and goods screeched to a halt,
[50:57.520 --> 50:58.960]  which is what they want.
[50:58.960 --> 51:01.920]  They want a completely isolated world, right?
[51:01.920 --> 51:04.480]  Debilitating industries like tourism
[51:04.480 --> 51:06.720]  and breaking global supply chains.
[51:06.720 --> 51:10.080]  And they want you at home, in your house, in front of the TV.
[51:10.080 --> 51:13.920]  Then they got you, because once you watch the TV, they own your soul.
[51:13.920 --> 51:18.480]  Even locally, normally bustling shops and offices sat empty for months.
[51:18.480 --> 51:22.720]  Okay, so I love how they talk about it in the past tense in 2010.
[51:22.720 --> 51:27.520]  That originally aired from the New Manhattan Project in 2014.
[51:27.520 --> 51:30.880]  They set up globalism to globally enslave us
[51:30.880 --> 51:34.720]  and kill the real international globalism that existed.
[51:34.720 --> 51:37.760]  Remember, they run the environmental movement to destroy the earth.
[51:37.760 --> 51:41.600]  They run globalism to destroy real internationalism.
[51:41.600 --> 51:43.600]  Understand?
[51:43.600 --> 51:46.160]  It's a big plan, and we ain't in it.
[51:46.160 --> 51:48.800]  Here's a few minutes, though, of Bill Burr, the comedian,
[51:48.800 --> 51:51.840]  up there saying, let's depopulate people on his Netflix special.
[51:51.840 --> 51:53.840]  Here it is.
[51:53.840 --> 51:57.040]  The hell have I been doing with my life, trying to get in shape, man?
[51:57.040 --> 52:00.880]  I hate going to the gym, so I decided I'd go veggie twice a week.
[52:00.880 --> 52:05.200]  It's brutal. I can only make it till about five o'clock.
[52:05.200 --> 52:07.600]  Five o'clock. That's what I realized about myself.
[52:07.600 --> 52:12.640]  You know that? Something has to die every day.
[52:12.640 --> 52:14.640]  In order for me to live.
[52:14.640 --> 52:18.640]  Something's got to get its beak chopped off,
[52:18.640 --> 52:20.640]  its feathers yanked,
[52:20.640 --> 52:22.640]  an uppercut to its jaw.
[52:22.640 --> 52:24.640]  Just in order for me to survive.
[52:24.640 --> 52:26.640]  I'm trying.
[52:26.640 --> 52:28.640]  Coos, coos, and all that sh**.
[52:32.640 --> 52:34.640]  It's awful.
[52:34.640 --> 52:38.640]  I saw this thing, though, that they said if everybody went vegan,
[52:38.640 --> 52:40.640]  if everybody went vegan, though,
[52:40.640 --> 52:42.640]  it would be vegetarian, whatever the hell they said.
[52:42.640 --> 52:44.640]  One of those V1s, right?
[52:44.640 --> 52:48.640]  And they said it would be great for the environment.
[52:48.640 --> 52:50.640]  Because I guess there's all this cattle standing around,
[52:50.640 --> 52:54.640]  and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something.
[52:54.640 --> 52:56.640]  Right?
[52:56.640 --> 52:58.640]  They're always doing that sh**.
[52:58.640 --> 53:02.640]  You know, if everybody went vegan,
[53:02.640 --> 53:04.640]  the air would be...
[53:04.640 --> 53:06.640]  If everybody drove an electric car,
[53:06.640 --> 53:08.640]  if everybody's had some snowshoes on.
[53:08.640 --> 53:10.640]  Right?
[53:10.640 --> 53:12.640]  And they just won't come out and say it.
[53:12.640 --> 53:14.640]  Nobody has the balls to come out and say it,
[53:14.640 --> 53:18.640]  and just say, look, 85% of you have to go.
[53:18.640 --> 53:20.640]  That's it.
[53:20.640 --> 53:22.640]  That is it.
[53:22.640 --> 53:26.640]  I have been bitching about the population problem
[53:26.640 --> 53:30.640]  for three specials in a row.
[53:30.640 --> 53:32.640]  Alright, we're gonna go to break.
[53:32.640 --> 53:34.640]  I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna play more of this,
[53:34.640 --> 53:36.640]  and I'm gonna get into the latest on the COVID hoax takeover
[53:36.640 --> 53:38.640]  and exactly where it's leading and what they're gonna do to you and your family.
[53:38.640 --> 53:40.640]  And they're coming, they're gonna shoot you up
[53:40.640 --> 53:42.640]  and you're never gonna have kids again and you're gonna get cancer and die.
[53:42.640 --> 53:44.640]  And they're gonna have liability protection
[53:44.640 --> 53:46.640]  and Bill Gates is gonna laugh about it.
[53:46.640 --> 53:48.640]  And by the way, Bill Gates is all over the news.
[53:48.640 --> 53:50.640]  He's come back out of hiding like a moray eel
[53:50.640 --> 53:52.640]  saying he's not involved with the vaccines.
[53:52.640 --> 53:54.640]  He's not involved with implantable chips.
[53:54.640 --> 53:58.640]  He's not involved, of course, but then he's rolling it all out.
[53:58.640 --> 54:02.640]  And he's funding the implantable chips.
[54:02.640 --> 54:04.640]  So it's more of the gas lighting they engage in.
[54:04.640 --> 54:06.640]  Please don't forget
[54:06.640 --> 54:08.640]  that the big special back to
[54:08.640 --> 54:11.640]  work, back to school, Reopen America special,
[54:11.640 --> 54:14.640]  double Patriot points, and 50 to 60% off
[54:14.640 --> 54:16.640]  all the high quality supplements and
[54:16.640 --> 54:18.640]  the Alexa Pure Breeze 4-stage ion filter
[54:18.640 --> 54:20.640]  at cost at $137.
[54:20.640 --> 54:22.640]  That's all gonna end this Sunday.
[54:22.640 --> 54:24.640]  All gonna end this Sunday.
[54:24.640 --> 54:26.640]  Also, the pocket pockets we've sold out,
[54:26.640 --> 54:28.640]  the little privacy pockets we've sold out
[54:28.640 --> 54:30.640]  of all the black ones and it's back order,
[54:30.640 --> 54:32.640]  but we've got them in other three colors.
[54:32.640 --> 54:34.640]  So you can protect your phone and not be tracked.
[54:34.640 --> 54:36.640]  By the globalist, those are available
[54:36.640 --> 54:40.640]  at infostore.com as well, but they're selling out quick.
[54:42.640 --> 54:44.640]  The social engineers bet on you not having a memory,
[54:44.640 --> 54:46.640]  more than anything.
[54:46.640 --> 54:48.640]  They also bet, as they constantly talk about it
[54:48.640 --> 54:50.640]  in their own words, that you will adapt
[54:50.640 --> 54:52.640]  to being a slave, that you will learn
[54:52.640 --> 54:54.640]  incrementally to submit.
[54:54.640 --> 54:56.640]  So think about and remember the phases
[54:56.640 --> 54:58.640]  of the Fauci fraud.
[54:58.640 --> 55:00.640]  Remember that everything he said has been
[55:00.640 --> 55:02.640]  a premeditated lie.
[55:02.640 --> 55:04.640]  They lied about where it came from.
[55:04.640 --> 55:06.640]  They lied about person to person, the UN
[55:06.640 --> 55:08.640]  covered it all up, then exaggerated
[55:08.640 --> 55:10.640]  the death rate at 4%
[55:10.640 --> 55:14.640]  when it's actually 0.032 now
[55:14.640 --> 55:16.640]  and dropping.
[55:16.640 --> 55:18.640]  Then they set the test up to count
[55:18.640 --> 55:20.640]  almost all false positives.
[55:20.640 --> 55:22.640]  They put the names of people that died
[55:22.640 --> 55:24.640]  of other diseases in the COVID column.
[55:24.640 --> 55:26.640]  They only said there'd be a 15-day lockdown.
[55:26.640 --> 55:28.640]  Now we're six months later.
[55:28.640 --> 55:30.640]  Now they say it's permanent.
[55:30.640 --> 55:32.640]  They're going to track everywhere you go
[55:32.640 --> 55:34.640]  and what you do, the global social credit score
[55:34.640 --> 55:36.640]  and the UN is the boss and anybody questioning it
[55:36.640 --> 55:38.640]  is censored off the internet, loses their job.
[55:38.640 --> 55:40.640]  That's called 21st century
[55:40.640 --> 55:42.640]  tyranny. That's called world government takeover.
[55:44.640 --> 55:46.640]  Nancy Pelosi, Eric Holder,
[55:46.640 --> 55:48.640]  Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton
[55:48.640 --> 55:50.640]  and the list goes on from there
[55:50.640 --> 55:52.640]  have all gone on national TV
[55:52.640 --> 55:54.640]  and have all gone on the internet
[55:54.640 --> 55:56.640]  and have been on the pages of the New York Times
[55:56.640 --> 55:58.640]  that their war came in contesting
[55:58.640 --> 56:00.640]  the election when they lose.
[56:00.640 --> 56:02.640]  They know there's a landslide.
[56:02.640 --> 56:04.640]  If they're unable to steal it,
[56:04.640 --> 56:06.640]  they're planning to contest it
[56:06.640 --> 56:08.640]  and have democratic blue states
[56:08.640 --> 56:10.640]  secede and hold their own treasonous
[56:10.640 --> 56:12.640]  inauguration for Joe Biden
[56:12.640 --> 56:14.640]  and the other public, Kamala Harris.
[56:14.640 --> 56:16.640]  This has now been announced
[56:16.640 --> 56:18.640]  and they're going to use race war and rioting
[56:18.640 --> 56:20.640]  as the cover to try to drive Trump from office.
[56:20.640 --> 56:22.640]  The Democratic Party, the Chi-Coms
[56:22.640 --> 56:24.640]  the Deep State are using
[56:24.640 --> 56:26.640]  Black Lives Matter funded by Soros
[56:26.640 --> 56:28.640]  as their cover to claim
[56:28.640 --> 56:30.640]  that if you resist their attempts
[56:30.640 --> 56:32.640]  at creating artificial riots
[56:32.640 --> 56:34.640]  and martial law that you're racist
[56:34.640 --> 56:36.640]  when in truth an old Nazi collaborator
[56:36.640 --> 56:38.640]  George Soros created Black Lives Matter
[56:38.640 --> 56:40.640]  along with Antifa.
[56:40.640 --> 57:04.640]  America's fighting for its life, but we will win.
[57:04.640 --> 57:06.640]  We're now into hour number two
[57:06.640 --> 57:10.640]  on this live Thursday transmission.
[57:10.640 --> 57:12.640]  I was put in a lot of time on
[57:12.640 --> 57:14.640]  Event 201 in Lockstep
[57:14.640 --> 57:16.640]  where the Rockefeller Foundation
[57:16.640 --> 57:18.640]  and Bill Belinda Gates Foundation
[57:18.640 --> 57:20.640]  had met their bringing in world government
[57:20.640 --> 57:22.640]  authoritarianism, the end of an open free society.
[57:22.640 --> 57:24.640]  Now I think Bill Burr is a good comedian
[57:24.640 --> 57:26.640]  and he's against cancel culture
[57:26.640 --> 57:28.640]  and he's got courage to come out and criticize it
[57:28.640 --> 57:30.640]  in this landscape of cowards.
[57:30.640 --> 57:32.640]  I mean in a world of cowards
[57:32.640 --> 57:34.640]  a person with any courage is a hero
[57:34.640 --> 57:36.640]  and that's the scary thing
[57:36.640 --> 57:38.640]  and when the people fear the government there is tyranny
[57:38.640 --> 57:40.640]  when the government fears the people there is liberty
[57:40.640 --> 57:42.640]  as Thomas Heverson said
[57:42.640 --> 57:44.640]  but he did this whole special
[57:44.640 --> 57:46.640]  on Netflix and he got into depopulation
[57:46.640 --> 57:48.640]  and he said let's just say what we want
[57:48.640 --> 57:50.640]  we need to depopulate the earth.
[57:50.640 --> 57:52.640]  Some areas are overpopulated
[57:52.640 --> 57:54.640]  some places have taken up the resources
[57:54.640 --> 57:56.640]  but most areas are not
[57:56.640 --> 57:58.640]  and you could sustain this population
[57:58.640 --> 58:00.640]  if you remove having
[58:00.640 --> 58:02.640]  2.1% replacement rate
[58:02.640 --> 58:04.640]  for every two adults
[58:04.640 --> 58:06.640]  2.1 kids on average
[58:06.640 --> 58:08.640]  society collapses unless you get rid
[58:08.640 --> 58:10.640]  of a human future
[58:10.640 --> 58:12.640]  and that's what's happening right now
[58:12.640 --> 58:14.640]  is a globalist reclamation project
[58:14.640 --> 58:16.640]  to sabotage civilization
[58:16.640 --> 58:18.640]  and destroy the real carrying capacity of the earth
[58:18.640 --> 58:20.640]  have those that implement the crisis
[58:20.640 --> 58:22.640]  rioted as the planetary rulers and the saviors
[58:22.640 --> 58:24.640]  here's what the comedian had to say
[58:24.640 --> 58:26.640]  I'm out and say it and just say look
[58:26.640 --> 58:28.640]  85% of you have to go
[58:28.640 --> 58:30.640]  that's it
[58:30.640 --> 58:32.640]  is it
[58:32.640 --> 58:34.640]  I have been bitching
[58:34.640 --> 58:36.640]  about the population problem
[58:36.640 --> 58:38.640]  for three specials in a row
[58:38.640 --> 58:40.640]  waiting
[58:40.640 --> 58:42.640]  for some politician
[58:42.640 --> 58:44.640]  to bring it up
[58:44.640 --> 58:46.640]  but they won't do it
[58:46.640 --> 58:48.640]  they won't do it
[58:48.640 --> 58:50.640]  so they see themselves as the elites
[58:50.640 --> 58:52.640]  kill me
[58:52.640 --> 58:54.640]  start billions
[58:54.640 --> 58:56.640]  you can't run with that as your platform
[58:56.640 --> 58:58.640]  oh but let's take vaccines
[58:58.640 --> 59:00.640]  I've collected
[59:00.640 --> 59:02.640]  I would implement a program
[59:02.640 --> 59:04.640]  to immediately eliminate
[59:04.640 --> 59:06.640]  at least 85% of you
[59:06.640 --> 59:08.640]  let's cover 19
[59:08.640 --> 59:10.640]  this planet cannot sustain
[59:10.640 --> 59:12.640]  the shared numbers let me finish
[59:16.640 --> 59:18.640]  this will not be arbitrary
[59:18.640 --> 59:20.640]  under your seats
[59:20.640 --> 59:22.640]  as a multiple choice questionnaire
[59:22.640 --> 59:24.640]  if you did not bring a pencil
[59:24.640 --> 59:26.640]  you're already out
[59:26.640 --> 59:28.640]  oh but Bill isn't
[59:28.640 --> 59:30.640]  can't do that
[59:30.640 --> 59:32.640]  you gotta be nice
[59:32.640 --> 59:34.640]  you gotta be f***ing nice especially this day
[59:34.640 --> 59:36.640]  everybody getting in trouble
[59:36.640 --> 59:38.640]  all these f***ing groups out there
[59:38.640 --> 59:40.640]  bitch moaning and complaining anytime
[59:40.640 --> 59:42.640]  anybody says anything
[59:42.640 --> 59:44.640]  you gotta apologize
[59:44.640 --> 59:46.640]  I'm sorry
[59:46.640 --> 59:48.640]  to people who won't sharpass
[59:48.640 --> 59:50.640]  I didn't mean to say
[59:50.640 --> 59:52.640]  that it's an ugly ass dog
[59:52.640 --> 59:54.640]  and notice they're all willing to kill everybody
[59:54.640 --> 59:56.640]  but not themselves
[59:56.640 --> 59:58.640]  what about what about that
[59:58.640 --> 1:00:00.640]  but they're mad about what you said
[1:00:00.640 --> 1:00:02.640]  they want to silence you so you can be taken out
[1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:04.640]  in this country
[1:00:04.640 --> 1:00:06.640]  and the very people that want to force
[1:00:06.640 --> 1:00:08.640]  inoculate you are the ones that want to kill you
[1:00:08.640 --> 1:00:10.640]  who f***ing joins a group
[1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:12.640]  how many join a group
[1:00:12.640 --> 1:00:14.640]  that's what I'm gonna do today
[1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:16.640]  go to meetings
[1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:18.640]  kind of a f***ing loser
[1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:22.640]  it's the same way I look at people laugh
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:24.640]  who got upset about
[1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:26.640]  you know Michael Sam
[1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:28.640]  the gay football player kissing his boyfriend
[1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:30.640]  when he got drafted
[1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:32.640]  everybody bitch moaning and complaining
[1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:34.640]  that's what you get for watching the draft
[1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:36.640]  the robot's getting props
[1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:38.640]  oh but you're not needed anymore
[1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:40.640]  once again
[1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:42.640]  what kind of a f***ing loser
[1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:44.640]  just sits there
[1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:46.640]  watching round after round
[1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:48.640]  the jets are up next
[1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:50.640]  I think they need a quarter
[1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:52.640]  so they're all sitting there
[1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:54.640]  that was just out six months ago
[1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:56.640]  and now they're not allowed to go
[1:00:56.640 --> 1:00:58.640]  to hear another human talk because the clamp down's here
[1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:00.640]  oh you're like yay kill everybody
[1:01:00.640 --> 1:01:02.640]  oh well we're starting it
[1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:04.640]  we're making the obsolete right now
[1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:06.640]  getting rid of the infrastructure for you
[1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:08.640]  worldwide depression hundreds of millions are gonna starve to death
[1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:10.640]  woo
[1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:12.640]  but don't worry you're getting free checks
[1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:14.640]  that first six months that first year
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:16.640]  some of you are
[1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:18.640]  the middle class is not the poor people
[1:01:18.640 --> 1:01:20.640]  oh no they're all
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:22.640]  having to move in with mama but mama don't have money no more
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:24.640]  so oh there's gonna be more homeless
[1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:26.640]  oh the collapse
[1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:28.640]  is here
[1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:30.640]  and so the sick part of me is
[1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:32.640]  all these sixty something millions
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:34.640]  of babies we've killed
[1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:36.640]  nobody came to their help so
[1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:38.640]  all these yuppies and trendies want to live in a dystopic
[1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:40.640]  new world order and get exterminated
[1:01:40.640 --> 1:01:42.640]  well line on up
[1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:44.640]  but you know the leftists are in on it
[1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:46.640]  they're not gonna take the inoculations
[1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:48.640]  oh yes they do
[1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:20.640]  so
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:22.640]  those are all very close to selling out
[1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:24.640]  a bunch of other best sellers
[1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:26.640]  we still have but I will
[1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:28.640]  in this special on Sunday
[1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:30.640]  we'll have a new great special coming up next week
[1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:32.640]  but it's not as extensive
[1:02:32.640 --> 1:02:34.640]  or expansive
[1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:36.640]  x2 the original will be back at stock
[1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:38.640]  it will be discounted but it's not available yet
[1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:40.640]  so this is a great sale
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:42.640]  it funds the operation there are great items
[1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:44.640]  in crazy times like this it's good to stock up
[1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:46.640]  but whatever you do
[1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:48.640]  keep spreading the word about info wars
[1:02:48.640 --> 1:02:50.640]  because you are the modern voice
[1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:52.640]  you are Paul Revere and I salute you and thank you
[1:02:56.640 --> 1:02:58.640]  you walk into this room at your own risk
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:00.640]  because it leads to the future
[1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:02.640]  not a future that will be
[1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:04.640]  but one that might be
[1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:06.640]  this is not a new world
[1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:08.640]  it is simply an extension
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:10.640]  of what began in the old one
[1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:12.640]  it is patterned itself after
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:14.640]  every dictator who has ever planted
[1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:16.640]  the ripping imprint of a boot
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:18.640]  on the pages of history
[1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:20.640]  since the beginning of time
[1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:22.640]  it has refinements
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:24.640]  technological advances and a more sophisticated
[1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:26.640]  approach to the destruction
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:28.640]  of human freedom
[1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:30.640]  but like every one of the super states
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:32.640]  that preceded it
[1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:34.640]  it has one iron rule
[1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:36.640]  logic is an enemy and truth is a menace
[1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:38.640]  this is Mr. Romney Wordsworth
[1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:40.640]  in his last 48 hours on earth
[1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:42.640]  he is a citizen of the state
[1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:44.640]  but will soon have to be eliminated
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:46.640]  because he is built out of flesh
[1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:48.640]  and because he has a mind
[1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:50.640]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth
[1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:52.640]  who will draw his last breaths
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:04:06.640]  in the Twilight Zone
[1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:24.640]  the world government
[1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:26.640]  run by the corporate fascist UN
[1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:28.640]  with its big train
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:30.640]  satanic guerrilla china
[1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:32.640]  making its move against humanity
[1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:34.640]  and the average westerners
[1:04:34.640 --> 1:04:36.640]  drunk on the fumes
[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:38.640]  of liberty and wealth
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:40.640]  left in the gas tank
[1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:42.640]  but soon
[1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:44.640]  the engine will stall
[1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:46.640]  soon the cities will burn
[1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:50.640]  but soon the prosperity
[1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:52.640]  will be gone
[1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:56.640]  and the rise
[1:04:56.640 --> 1:04:58.640]  of the robots will be here
[1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:00.640]  and the end of the age
[1:05:00.640 --> 1:05:02.640]  of man
[1:05:02.640 --> 1:05:04.640]  will die
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:08.640]  and because you will not
[1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:10.640]  fight
[1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:12.640]  you will die
[1:05:16.640 --> 1:05:18.640]  all the big sporting events
[1:05:18.640 --> 1:05:20.640]  they have the robots dancing
[1:05:20.640 --> 1:05:22.640]  no humans
[1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:24.640]  but we are here
[1:05:24.640 --> 1:05:26.640]  we will control them
[1:05:26.640 --> 1:05:28.640]  we will boss them
[1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:30.640]  we will corral them
[1:05:30.640 --> 1:05:32.640]  into the dustbin of history
[1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:34.640]  it was a tanks
[1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:36.640]  and foreign armies that could conquer humans
[1:05:36.640 --> 1:05:38.640]  not the frontal assault
[1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:42.640]  it was the opiates
[1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:44.640]  of entertainment
[1:05:44.640 --> 1:05:46.640]  and decadence
[1:05:46.640 --> 1:05:48.640]  they couldn't defeat men
[1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:50.640]  so by their dark alchemy
[1:05:50.640 --> 1:05:52.640]  they turned us into
[1:05:52.640 --> 1:05:54.640]  narcissistic sociopathic
[1:05:54.640 --> 1:05:56.640]  arrogant selfish animals
[1:05:56.640 --> 1:05:58.640]  too arrogant
[1:05:58.640 --> 1:06:00.640]  to even save ourselves
[1:06:00.640 --> 1:06:02.640]  too selfish
[1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:04.640]  to even admit the peril
[1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:06.640]  that we were all under
[1:06:06.640 --> 1:06:08.640]  too committed
[1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:10.640]  to the church of satan
[1:06:10.640 --> 1:06:12.640]  to stand up
[1:06:12.640 --> 1:06:14.640]  and take God's hand
[1:06:14.640 --> 1:06:16.640]  and be lifted into the stars
[1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:20.640]  because you didn't want to be angels
[1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:24.640]  you wanted to fall
[1:06:24.640 --> 1:06:26.640]  and fall you have
[1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:28.640]  and fall I have
[1:06:28.640 --> 1:06:30.640]  but out of this nightmare
[1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:32.640]  it will become so painful
[1:06:32.640 --> 1:06:34.640]  and all the convenience will be gone
[1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:36.640]  that you will later
[1:06:36.640 --> 1:06:38.640]  beg on your knees to God
[1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:40.640]  that you would have done something when you could
[1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:42.640]  I don't raise this
[1:06:42.640 --> 1:06:44.640]  because it was the top story on Twitter
[1:06:44.640 --> 1:06:46.640]  and still in the top 10 trends this morning
[1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:48.640]  when I checked it
[1:06:48.640 --> 1:06:50.640]  I cover it because it's an illustration
[1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:52.640]  of incredible deception
[1:06:52.640 --> 1:06:54.640]  and a great teaching tool for myself and others
[1:06:56.640 --> 1:06:58.640]  from Australia to Germany
[1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:00.640]  from Mexico
[1:07:00.640 --> 1:07:02.640]  to the United States
[1:07:02.640 --> 1:07:04.640]  from South Africa
[1:07:08.640 --> 1:07:10.640]  to Japan
[1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:12.640]  from the United Kingdom
[1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:14.640]  to Libya
[1:07:16.640 --> 1:07:18.640]  six foot is being enforced
[1:07:18.640 --> 1:07:20.640]  a massacre being enforced
[1:07:20.640 --> 1:07:22.640]  and now we're told children must live in bubbles
[1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:24.640]  and you must be tracked
[1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:26.640]  you must be traced, you must take inoculations
[1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:28.640]  the United Nations
[1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:30.640]  is the only boss
[1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:32.640]  they tell us what we can do
[1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:34.640]  and Bill Gates admits the COVID-19 is a giant
[1:07:34.640 --> 1:07:36.640]  a vent 201 drill
[1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:38.640]  for a real bio weapon
[1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:40.640]  we've behaved so well
[1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:42.640]  we've done what we're told
[1:07:42.640 --> 1:07:44.640]  we've proven we'll submit
[1:07:44.640 --> 1:07:46.640]  and now the medical system
[1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:48.640]  has put fraudulent numbers of millions that died
[1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:50.640]  of other things in the COVID column
[1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:52.640]  and we've followed orders to kill old people
[1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:54.640]  in the nursing homes
[1:07:54.640 --> 1:07:56.640]  the censorship works so well to shut down
[1:07:56.640 --> 1:07:58.640]  now thousands of doctors and scientists
[1:07:58.640 --> 1:08:00.640]  and medical workers that try to speak out
[1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:04.640]  that now
[1:08:04.640 --> 1:08:06.640]  they're going to totally destroy the economy
[1:08:06.640 --> 1:08:08.640]  these bio weapons that are really deadly
[1:08:08.640 --> 1:08:10.640]  and they're going to kill you
[1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:12.640]  because Bill Gates said there's too many of you
[1:08:12.640 --> 1:08:14.640]  and the U.N. said there's too many of you
[1:08:14.640 --> 1:08:16.640]  and Bill Burr went at his specials
[1:08:16.640 --> 1:08:18.640]  and said we need to kill 85%
[1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:20.640]  and the big audience will kill us
[1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:22.640]  just like at TED Talk
[1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:24.640]  Bill Gates said eight, nine years ago
[1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:26.640]  he said we're going to reduce world population
[1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:28.640]  by 80% we're going to lower the number of
[1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:30.640]  humans that we're having to zero
[1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:36.640]  and everybody standing ovation
[1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:38.640]  oh but he doesn't want you to die
[1:08:38.640 --> 1:08:40.640]  so he's got a vaccine for you
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:42.640]  and he's spending billions to do it
[1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:44.640]  of tax free money he's given
[1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:46.640]  by the Ford, Carnegie and Rockefeller
[1:08:46.640 --> 1:08:48.640]  Foundations
[1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:54.640]  that's two plus two equals four
[1:08:54.640 --> 1:08:56.640]  he wants to depopulate you his father
[1:08:56.640 --> 1:08:58.640]  ran Planned Parenthood
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:00.640]  he wants to depopulate Africa
[1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:02.640]  but he wants you to have a shot
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:04.640]  so you don't get sick
[1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:06.640]  but he admits it doesn't really help you
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:08.640]  it's going to hurt a lot of people
[1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:10.640]  and it does tend to reduce fertility but
[1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:12.640]  and the average
[1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:14.640]  black person
[1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:16.640]  white person you name it that thinks they're middle class
[1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:18.640]  will say well there are too many people
[1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:20.640]  well then blow your head off
[1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:22.640]  slit your wrist jump off a cliff
[1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:24.640]  just don't take anybody with you when you do it
[1:09:24.640 --> 1:09:26.640]  seriously
[1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:28.640]  if you want to kill everybody else
[1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:30.640]  be a good teacher
[1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:32.640]  and you know the best way to teach people
[1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:34.640]  is by example
[1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:36.640]  oh no no no no
[1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:38.640]  Bill Gates is far too precious
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:40.640]  to ever harm a little
[1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:42.640]  hair on his chinny chin chin
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:46.640]  he wants you to die
[1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:48.640]  but he wants to do it where you die
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:50.640]  in five or six or ten years
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:52.640]  with the little goodies he's got
[1:09:52.640 --> 1:09:54.640]  in four of the vaccines he's funding
[1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:56.640]  that aren't even vaccines
[1:09:56.640 --> 1:09:58.640]  you know I mean if I had a 3.7 magnum
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:00.640]  and I put the shells in it
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:02.640]  and I put it to your head and I said it's a vaccine
[1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:04.640]  and I pulled the trigger and blew your head off
[1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:08.640]  oh it'd be okay because it's a vaccine
[1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:10.640]  you know if I took a hatchet
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:12.640]  and put it in your face
[1:10:12.640 --> 1:10:14.640]  just a random person I said it's a vaccine
[1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:16.640]  you know a vaccine
[1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:18.640]  learn immunity goes back you know thousands of years
[1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:20.640]  where people figured out you could take the pus
[1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:22.640]  from a cow that had
[1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:24.640]  a different disease like smallpox
[1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:26.640]  and you could jam it in somebody's arm
[1:10:26.640 --> 1:10:28.640]  and give it to them and once they'd had it
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:30.640]  they wouldn't get it again
[1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:32.640]  but sometimes the cure is worse than the disease
[1:10:32.640 --> 1:10:34.640]  but the thought was if you give it to somebody
[1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:36.640]  when they're not run down
[1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:38.640]  if they used to die in the winter from smallpox
[1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:40.640]  because they weren't getting vitamin D3 from the sun
[1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:42.640]  they didn't know why they just knew they thought
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:44.640]  vapors were in the cold and that's why they said
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:46.640]  you know wear lots of clothing because the cold gives it to you
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:48.640]  no it's the lack of sunlight
[1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:50.640]  but the new cold and damp gave it to you
[1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:52.640]  so they take a little toothpick
[1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:54.640]  first examples of this about 500 years ago
[1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:56.640]  got written down 500 years ago
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:10:58.640]  because they didn't have printing presses until then
[1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:00.640]  and they just stick it in your arm
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:02.640]  you get a little scar and if you do it in the summer
[1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:04.640]  they just knew the doctors were like the apothecaries
[1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:06.640]  the witch doctors you know the local surgeons
[1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:08.640]  the barbers, barbers would do it
[1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:10.640]  that's why you have the barber pull is
[1:11:10.640 --> 1:11:12.640]  the blue, the white, the red
[1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:14.640]  usually they're just red and white
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:16.640]  red's the blood, white's the bandages
[1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:18.640]  barbers pull teeth, barbers did inoculations
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:20.640]  barbers did surgeries
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:22.640]  depending on how good a barber you were
[1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:24.640]  they're usually close to a drugstore called an apothecary
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:26.640]  you'd go there and that's where that
[1:11:26.640 --> 1:11:28.640]  symbol of a drugstore is a grinder
[1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:30.640]  a bowl and a grinder
[1:11:30.640 --> 1:11:32.640]  and they had you know vitamins and minerals
[1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:34.640]  and things in there that really worked
[1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:36.640]  big pharmacist came in and took all that over
[1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:38.640]  and then you know now she says get rid of the old thing
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:40.640]  but some was good and the old some was bad
[1:11:40.640 --> 1:11:42.640]  just like Chinese medicines very
[1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:44.640]  ancient Chinese medicines very similar to ancient
[1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:46.640]  Western medicine but the old days the Catholic church
[1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:48.640]  would burn you at the stake if you were
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:50.640]  gathering herbs and things that was
[1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:52.640]  seen as witchcraft but
[1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:54.640]  because knowledge is evil right we see today
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:56.640]  knowledge as witchcraft I mean they
[1:11:56.640 --> 1:11:58.640]  they say we tell people vitamin D3 is essential
[1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:00.640]  not to get COVID-19 they'll arrest you
[1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:02.640]  medical doctors prescribe it they'll send a SWAT team
[1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:04.640]  medical doctors you'll be vitamin C in Michigan
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:06.640]  they SWAT team you because
[1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:08.640]  the UN says none of that helps
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:10.640]  doesn't matter the NIH website says it does
[1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:12.640]  the UN is boss
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:16.640]  but I digress
[1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:18.640]  we're now under the United Nations
[1:12:18.640 --> 1:12:20.640]  control
[1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:22.640]  and complying
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:24.640]  with all this he's only going to intensify
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:26.640]  how bad the civilization
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:28.640]  gets
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:30.640]  when we come back I'm going to run through
[1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:34.640]  this exercise they
[1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:36.640]  engaged in to take what I did
[1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:38.640]  and totally twist it and make it the number one
[1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:42.640]  thing on the internet
[1:12:42.640 --> 1:12:44.640]  and so understanding this you'll understand it all
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:46.640]  look at the latest COVID takeover
[1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:48.640]  it's a permanent post-human takeover
[1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:50.640]  when they're done you'll all be dead
[1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:52.640]  you can really break civilizations
[1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:54.640]  down to two types
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:12:56.640]  predatory and non predatory
[1:12:56.640 --> 1:12:58.640]  or oppressive conquest
[1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:00.640]  based or renaissance based
[1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:02.640]  and of course different types of civilizations
[1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:04.640]  and countries
[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:06.640]  and political systems of history
[1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:08.640]  and of the present are mixes of the two
[1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:10.640]  but with globalism
[1:13:10.640 --> 1:13:12.640]  it is a post-human
[1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:14.640]  ideology
[1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:16.640]  so it's scientifically
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:18.640]  geared to be oppressive
[1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:20.640]  and the rationale is
[1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:22.640]  social Darwinism
[1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:24.640]  that the ruling class are elites and because
[1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:26.640]  they're in power they have a right to rule over you
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:28.640]  poison you
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:30.640]  dumb you down sterilize you
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:32.640]  and kill you so all the people
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:34.640]  wearing masks like outside at the parking
[1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:36.640]  stuff are living in a total
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:38.640]  hoax and think their act of submission
[1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:40.640]  is an act of working for the common
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:42.640]  good in a collective
[1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:44.640]  no it's a sign that you're a slave
[1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:46.640]  who will take the force inoculations
[1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:48.640]  federal government Yale are studying
[1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:50.640]  the force inoculations right now
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:52.640]  well we're six months into the COVID-19
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:54.640]  lockdown and now
[1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:56.640]  democrat leaders are calling for people to be charged
[1:13:56.640 --> 1:13:58.640]  for the attempted murder if they don't wear
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:00.640]  the mask of the symbols of slavery
[1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:02.640]  and they trigger their race riots around the country
[1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:04.640]  led by white angry liberal
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:06.640]  academics and others and now on top
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:08.640]  of the democrats are officially saying
[1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:10.640]  hey Trump's gonna try to steal the election
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:12.640]  and contest it but then their internal
[1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:14.640]  wargaming documents come out with
[1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:16.640]  John Podesta at the very top with Kamala Harris
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:18.640]  and of course Joe Biden
[1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:20.640]  and they're saying oh we think we're gonna lose
[1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:22.640]  but we're gonna have the democrat
[1:14:22.640 --> 1:14:24.640]  state secede claiming that Joe Biden's
[1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:26.640]  won the popular vote and we are
[1:14:26.640 --> 1:14:28.640]  then going to set up our own country
[1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:30.640]  and ask the military to remove Trump
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:32.640]  this is officially in the New York Times
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:34.640]  and I'll just believe the New York Times
[1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:36.640]  I've been telling you for over a year
[1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:38.640]  this is their plan from other statements they've made
[1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:40.640]  and then Atlantic Monthly, the Washington Post
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:42.640]  the Financial Times of London
[1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:44.640]  and the Council on Farm Relations
[1:14:44.640 --> 1:14:46.640]  this is their plan we've got 80 days left to stop it
[1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:48.640]  what are you gonna do I'm serious folks
[1:14:48.640 --> 1:15:00.640]  this is the time to save the country
[1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:20.640]  but thanks to you spreading the word
[1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:22.640]  it's more important than it's ever been
[1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:24.640]  I'm gonna cover the waterfront on news
[1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:26.640]  next segment all the big campaign news
[1:15:26.640 --> 1:15:28.640]  economy news, plans to try to
[1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:30.640]  have democrat states secede
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:32.640]  and challenge the election
[1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:34.640]  I mean that's the waters we're in
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:36.640]  with 81 days out
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:38.640]  and I'm your host Alex Jones
[1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:40.640]  but first let's just get into the anatomy of a hoax
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:42.640]  middle of the show
[1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:44.640]  the boom operator
[1:15:44.640 --> 1:15:46.640]  John
[1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:48.640]  over there
[1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:50.640]  says hey you're
[1:15:50.640 --> 1:15:52.640]  number one on Twitter
[1:15:52.640 --> 1:15:54.640]  and
[1:15:54.640 --> 1:15:56.640]  they're in the break I go look at it
[1:15:56.640 --> 1:15:58.640]  and it's a one minute clip
[1:15:58.640 --> 1:16:00.640]  edit out a context and they say look
[1:16:00.640 --> 1:16:02.640]  he's randomly just screaming at teenagers
[1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:04.640]  for no reason he's insane
[1:16:04.640 --> 1:16:06.640]  and they gave no context
[1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:08.640]  oh there's these
[1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:10.640]  giant city parks
[1:16:10.640 --> 1:16:12.640]  where you don't even see anyone because they're so huge
[1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:14.640]  called green belts that are as big as state parks
[1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:16.640]  and there's just
[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:18.640]  entrances in the woods
[1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:20.640]  off of neighborhoods where people been going
[1:16:20.640 --> 1:16:22.640]  where I've been going since high school
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:24.640]  and they're there blocking it
[1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:26.640]  so the one my wife goes to the one I go to
[1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:28.640]  she went with a friend she comes in
[1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:30.640]  I've already cooked breakfast with the kids I'm sitting there
[1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:32.640]  and she's like man they like saw me and said get out of here
[1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:34.640]  and were really rude
[1:16:34.640 --> 1:16:36.640]  and said you gotta register and they've got like a
[1:16:36.640 --> 1:16:38.640]  stupid plastic front up there
[1:16:38.640 --> 1:16:40.640]  and it's just ridiculous in the woods
[1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:42.640]  so I go over there
[1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:44.640]  and they say hey you can't go on there
[1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:46.640]  you gotta be registered and I already saw him
[1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:48.640]  turning people away saying it was full
[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:50.640]  total lie
[1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:52.640]  would even let him quote register with the covid tracing
[1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:56.640]  so
[1:16:56.640 --> 1:16:58.640]  they edit that down the statesman puts out a
[1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:00.640]  fake article kind of people came to my table
[1:17:00.640 --> 1:17:02.640]  at a restaurant said we're gonna kill you
[1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:04.640]  we're gonna get you
[1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:06.640]  they're waiting for me outside I yell back at them
[1:17:06.640 --> 1:17:08.640]  they shoot video of it put it on reddit and say
[1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:10.640]  Jones just attack us for a reason
[1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:12.640]  I said they came to my table
[1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:14.640]  threatened me I called the manager multiple times
[1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:16.640]  they did it three times
[1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:18.640]  statesman to their credit
[1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:20.640]  Jonathan Joe love I've never seen mainstream media tell the truth
[1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:22.640]  ever in like five years he did it
[1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:24.640]  he hates me but he said no I went to the restaurant
[1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:26.640]  they said that he'd complain they were coming to his table
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:28.640]  threatening it so that's what they do
[1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:30.640]  F you and your family you're gonna F thing die
[1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:32.640]  I hope you die hope you eat you know what
[1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:36.640]  I'm leaving they're waiting for me okay
[1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:38.640]  I don't yeah I yell at them
[1:17:38.640 --> 1:17:40.640]  that turns into
[1:17:42.640 --> 1:17:44.640]  Alex Jones is bad
[1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:46.640]  so that's how these
[1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:48.640]  Decepticons operate
[1:17:48.640 --> 1:17:50.640]  and so they trend it number one
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:52.640]  on Twitter
[1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:56.640]  that I
[1:17:56.640 --> 1:17:58.640]  just yelled at random people
[1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:00.640]  no you hear them on the tape
[1:18:00.640 --> 1:18:02.640]  so they knew when they edited this they go hey you don't have a passion get me in here
[1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:04.640]  and they just cut to me like
[1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:06.640]  five minutes later yelling at them I was there for an hour
[1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:08.640]  the police came and said he's right
[1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:10.640]  they ordered the
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:12.640]  lifeguards to stop blocking the entrance
[1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:14.640]  they said there is no law
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:16.640]  we've checked you can't do it that's huge
[1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:18.640]  nowhere is that there
[1:18:18.640 --> 1:18:20.640]  that the families then could go in
[1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:24.640]  where they've been coming for decades
[1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:26.640]  so that's the level
[1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:28.640]  they're in high fine the family after the police say now you can go in
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:30.640]  and look the police have
[1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:32.640]  the teenagers
[1:18:32.640 --> 1:18:34.640]  across the street where they ordered them
[1:18:34.640 --> 1:18:36.640]  they said get out of there stop doing it
[1:18:36.640 --> 1:18:38.640]  then more lifeguards showed up
[1:18:38.640 --> 1:18:40.640]  and the police said stop doing it
[1:18:40.640 --> 1:18:42.640]  you can't do it there's no ordinance
[1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:44.640]  no laws been passed this is wrong
[1:18:46.640 --> 1:18:48.640]  it turns into Jones is a bully
[1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:50.640]  bullying
[1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:54.640]  college students
[1:18:54.640 --> 1:18:56.640]  who were flipping us off
[1:18:56.640 --> 1:18:58.640]  but that's how they
[1:18:58.640 --> 1:19:00.640]  operate ladies and gentlemen
[1:19:00.640 --> 1:19:02.640]  they laughed at me they told me
[1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:04.640]  f off when I've been there a few minutes
[1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:06.640]  that's when I started yelling at them
[1:19:06.640 --> 1:19:08.640]  but the left are deceivers
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:10.640]  and as a group
[1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:12.640]  they deceive it's who they are
[1:19:12.640 --> 1:19:14.640]  fraud is their mo
[1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:16.640]  but it got worse
[1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:18.640]  by afternoon I guess they decided
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:20.640]  well this isn't good
[1:19:20.640 --> 1:19:22.640]  just one version of the video has 8 million views
[1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:24.640]  it's like 15 million views right now
[1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:26.640]  people found the real version
[1:19:26.640 --> 1:19:28.640]  and so
[1:19:28.640 --> 1:19:30.640]  what did they do
[1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:32.640]  look at these headlines
[1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:34.640]  when hashtag Alex Jones
[1:19:34.640 --> 1:19:36.640]  does a stick
[1:19:36.640 --> 1:19:38.640]  at the local park
[1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:40.640]  and it trends
[1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:42.640]  more than hashtag
[1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:44.640]  Biden Harris 2020 landslide
[1:19:44.640 --> 1:19:46.640]  so how did they respond
[1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:48.640]  boom child porn found on documents
[1:19:48.640 --> 1:19:50.640]  Alex Jones sent to lawyers
[1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:52.640]  of standard families court filing says
[1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:54.640]  they boosted this to the top of twitter
[1:19:54.640 --> 1:19:56.640]  above the video
[1:19:56.640 --> 1:19:58.640]  so we get hundreds of thousands of views
[1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:00.640]  but
[1:20:00.640 --> 1:20:02.640]  people began to actually read the article
[1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:04.640]  where the FBI said it was unopened emails
[1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:06.640]  we've been sent years ago
[1:20:06.640 --> 1:20:08.640]  that they requested
[1:20:08.640 --> 1:20:10.640]  in a deposition
[1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:12.640]  in discovery
[1:20:12.640 --> 1:20:14.640]  and that we were the victim
[1:20:14.640 --> 1:20:16.640]  but the headline still makes me look bad
[1:20:16.640 --> 1:20:18.640]  but in the article admits we were the victims
[1:20:18.640 --> 1:20:20.640]  so that's the left again
[1:20:20.640 --> 1:20:22.640]  covering up real pedophilia
[1:20:22.640 --> 1:20:24.640]  sexualization of children
[1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:26.640]  drag queen pervert story time
[1:20:26.640 --> 1:20:28.640]  he is a child porn person
[1:20:28.640 --> 1:20:30.640]  who would send it to the families
[1:20:30.640 --> 1:20:32.640]  of the Sandy Hook people
[1:20:32.640 --> 1:20:34.640]  all eyes
[1:20:34.640 --> 1:20:36.640]  so
[1:20:36.640 --> 1:20:38.640]  look
[1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:40.640]  here it is headline
[1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:42.640]  Jones just being mean to random women
[1:20:44.640 --> 1:20:46.640]  no she was laughing at me
[1:20:46.640 --> 1:20:48.640]  saying you're a joke you can't come in
[1:20:48.640 --> 1:20:50.640]  she got there after the other lifeguards were thrown out
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:52.640]  by the police
[1:20:52.640 --> 1:20:54.640]  it's just the Barton Springs
[1:20:54.640 --> 1:20:56.640]  is a small
[1:20:56.640 --> 1:20:58.640]  creek
[1:20:58.640 --> 1:21:00.640]  that's spring fed up by the main creek
[1:21:00.640 --> 1:21:02.640]  that's been there forever
[1:21:02.640 --> 1:21:04.640]  and that they charge you a couple dollars to go into
[1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:06.640]  now that's basically closed to the public
[1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:08.640]  so what they do is
[1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:10.640]  they just seize the entire Barton Creek
[1:21:10.640 --> 1:21:12.640]  and the huge
[1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:14.640]  green boat
[1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:16.640]  saying it's theirs
[1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:18.640]  and instead of
[1:21:18.640 --> 1:21:20.640]  thousands going down there
[1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:22.640]  hundreds of square miles
[1:21:22.640 --> 1:21:24.640]  no one can
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:26.640]  and so Alex Jones going to stand up for families' rights
[1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:28.640]  do I sat there and watch families walk up
[1:21:28.640 --> 1:21:30.640]  hey I've always come here
[1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:32.640]  well sorry registration
[1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:34.640]  can I register? no sorry it's full
[1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:36.640]  little smart ass
[1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:38.640]  snot nose
[1:21:38.640 --> 1:21:40.640]  scummy
[1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:42.640]  I sat there for 30 minutes
[1:21:42.640 --> 1:21:44.640]  in my truck watching them
[1:21:44.640 --> 1:21:46.640]  cause you can't normally park right up at it but there was nobody being let in
[1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:48.640]  so I can pull right up
[1:21:48.640 --> 1:21:50.640]  20 yards away
[1:21:50.640 --> 1:21:52.640]  window down on my truck
[1:21:52.640 --> 1:21:54.640]  watching them stand behind the green makeshift
[1:21:54.640 --> 1:21:56.640]  counter they put up with plexiglass
[1:21:56.640 --> 1:21:58.640]  going stay back COVID
[1:21:58.640 --> 1:22:00.640]  they even told me stay back COVID
[1:22:00.640 --> 1:22:02.640]  and I watched the families
[1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:04.640]  and so I got out
[1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:06.640]  by like the 10th family I saw turned back
[1:22:06.640 --> 1:22:08.640]  and I said uh sir
[1:22:08.640 --> 1:22:10.640]  there's no ordinance I've checked and I'm about to go up here
[1:22:10.640 --> 1:22:12.640]  and confront them I said watch what happens
[1:22:12.640 --> 1:22:14.640]  so the guy sat there and watched me he waited
[1:22:14.640 --> 1:22:16.640]  cops came an hour later they said yes sir
[1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:18.640]  you can go in there's no law it's unenforceable
[1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:20.640]  and he high-fived me and went in
[1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:22.640]  but see how do you take something like that
[1:22:22.640 --> 1:22:24.640]  that if everybody started doing it
[1:22:24.640 --> 1:22:26.640]  we would be out of this problem overnight
[1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:28.640]  civil disobedience nonviolent
[1:22:28.640 --> 1:22:30.640]  I could have been nicer
[1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:32.640]  but they were flipping me off
[1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:34.640]  and smart mouths
[1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:36.640]  and man I'm tired of this man
[1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:38.640]  I have been taking girls down to that green belt
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:40.640]  since I was 7
[1:22:40.640 --> 1:22:42.640]  to that very entrance
[1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:44.640]  I've been going to the green belt since I was 2 years old
[1:22:44.640 --> 1:22:46.640]  we visited grandma down here I'm from Dallas
[1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:48.640]  but I've been here since high school
[1:22:48.640 --> 1:22:50.640]  I've been going to that green belt since high school
[1:22:50.640 --> 1:22:52.640]  I've been going in that entrance
[1:22:52.640 --> 1:22:54.640]  since college
[1:22:54.640 --> 1:22:56.640]  I've probably taken
[1:22:56.640 --> 1:22:58.640]  20 dates down there
[1:22:58.640 --> 1:23:00.640]  I've had great picnics, great fishing, great hiking
[1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:02.640]  most days I go down there
[1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:04.640]  no one's even there
[1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:06.640]  and now permanently
[1:23:06.640 --> 1:23:08.640]  are snot nose scum
[1:23:08.640 --> 1:23:10.640]  waiting at the entrance for COVID tracing
[1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:12.640]  and the governor
[1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:14.640]  gave hundreds of millions to Google
[1:23:14.640 --> 1:23:16.640]  to run it
[1:23:16.640 --> 1:23:18.640]  and then the evil twitter takes that
[1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:20.640]  and lies about me
[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:22.640]  and then says I'm sending people child porn
[1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:24.640]  that's the scum and the filth of the technocracy
[1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:26.640]  and the type of abuse they'll carry out
[1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:28.640]  in their corporate evil
[1:23:28.640 --> 1:23:30.640]  while they support China with giant death camps
[1:23:30.640 --> 1:23:32.640]  so that's who we're up against
[1:23:32.640 --> 1:23:34.640]  these aren't liberal trendies
[1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:36.640]  that run twitter, facebook and google
[1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:38.640]  these are monstrous hardened war criminals
[1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:40.640]  engaged in the takedown of the west
[1:23:40.640 --> 1:23:42.640]  and coming with forced inoculations
[1:23:42.640 --> 1:23:44.640]  for you and your family
[1:23:44.640 --> 1:23:46.640]  and banning doctors from their own free speech
[1:23:46.640 --> 1:23:48.640]  in America
[1:23:52.640 --> 1:23:54.640]  you hear that
[1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:56.640]  that's the march of the united nations
[1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:00.640]  and the bill of malindegage foundation
[1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:02.640]  coming with their battle plan
[1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:04.640]  psychological warfare operation
[1:24:04.640 --> 1:24:06.640]  with the forced inoculations
[1:24:06.640 --> 1:24:08.640]  and the permanent lockdown
[1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:10.640]  of civilization and society
[1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:12.640]  they're outlawing people being able to get colds
[1:24:12.640 --> 1:24:14.640]  or the flu
[1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:16.640]  they're creating artificial phobias
[1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:18.640]  for normal death that takes place
[1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:20.640]  they're not even promising to have a cure to it all
[1:24:20.640 --> 1:24:22.640]  they're just inflicting
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:24.640]  new phobias on everyone
[1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:26.640]  to bring in their planetary regime
[1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:28.640]  directed by the WHO
[1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:30.640]  with vaccines that actually change
[1:24:30.640 --> 1:24:32.640]  your DNA
[1:24:32.640 --> 1:24:34.640]  and make you owned by Microsoft
[1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:36.640]  it's a final frontier
[1:24:36.640 --> 1:24:38.640]  it's the year 2020
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:40.640]  it's not coming
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:42.640]  it's here
[1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:44.640]  and submission is blood in the water
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:50.640]  this is a maximum alert
[1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:52.640]  a maximum alert
[1:24:52.640 --> 1:24:54.640]  as of taking this alert we're 82 days out from the election
[1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:56.640]  as many of you know in the last year
[1:24:56.640 --> 1:24:58.640]  I pointed out statements out of the council
[1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:00.640]  on foreign relations and other globalist organs
[1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:02.640]  that they know Trump is going to win
[1:25:02.640 --> 1:25:04.640]  in a landslide
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:06.640]  so their strategy will be
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:08.640]  to contest the election
[1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:10.640]  if they fail to successfully steal it
[1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:12.640]  then they are openly now war-gaining
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:14.640]  this is in the New York Times
[1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:16.640]  having democrat states and cities
[1:25:16.640 --> 1:25:18.640]  secede from the union
[1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:20.640]  just like they've ignored Trump's policies
[1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:22.640]  on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down
[1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:24.640]  that is nothing but a
[1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:26.640]  dress rehearsal
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:28.640]  they're going to have their own separate inauguration
[1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:30.640]  not in DC they said in another city
[1:25:30.640 --> 1:25:32.640]  Pelosi has said this
[1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:34.640]  when they crown
[1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:36.640]  Biden and Kamala Harris
[1:25:36.640 --> 1:25:38.640]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:40.640]  this is the organized civil war
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:42.640]  this is their public criminal plan
[1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:44.640]  we should be praying
[1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:46.640]  we should be spreading the word
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:48.640]  we should be demanding Trump won the office
[1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:50.640]  to expose his criminal activity
[1:25:54.640 --> 1:25:56.640]  you hear that
[1:25:56.640 --> 1:25:58.640]  that's the march of the united nations
[1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:00.640]  in the bill of millenia gage foundation
[1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:02.640]  coming with their battle plan
[1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:04.640]  psychological warfare operation
[1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:06.640]  with the forced inoculations
[1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:08.640]  and the permanent lockdown
[1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:10.640]  of civilization and society
[1:26:10.640 --> 1:26:12.640]  they're outlawing people being able to get colds
[1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:14.640]  or the flu
[1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:16.640]  they're creating artificial phobias
[1:26:16.640 --> 1:26:18.640]  for normal death that takes place
[1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:20.640]  they're not even promising to have a cure to it all
[1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:22.640]  they're just inflicting
[1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:24.640]  new phobias on everyone
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:26.640]  to bring in their planetary regime
[1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:28.640]  phobia
[1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:30.640]  with vaccines that actually change
[1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:32.640]  your DNA
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:34.640]  and make you owned by microsoft
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:36.640]  it's a final frontier
[1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:38.640]  it's the year 2020
[1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:40.640]  it's not coming
[1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:42.640]  it's here
[1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:58.640]  and submission is blood in the water
[1:27:12.640 --> 1:27:14.640]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:16.640]  I'm going to shift gears into other news here
[1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:18.640]  in a moment
[1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:20.640]  but first off
[1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:22.640]  let me announce some activism
[1:27:22.640 --> 1:27:24.640]  we're going to be engaged in
[1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:26.640]  I told a listener yesterday
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:28.640]  that I'm going to go out
[1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:30.640]  tomorrow
[1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:32.640]  from six to eight
[1:27:32.640 --> 1:27:34.640]  we haven't picked a location yet
[1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:36.640]  I'm thinking it'll be the capital
[1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:38.640]  I'm thinking it'll be the capital
[1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:40.640]  I'm thinking it'll be the capital
[1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:42.640]  we'll just pick that
[1:27:42.640 --> 1:27:44.640]  six to eight friday
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:46.640]  at the capital
[1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:48.640]  downtown
[1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:50.640]  calling it American flag drop
[1:27:50.640 --> 1:27:52.640]  where we go out, we support president trump
[1:27:52.640 --> 1:27:54.640]  we support reopening the country
[1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:56.640]  and the nation so please come out to that
[1:27:56.640 --> 1:27:58.640]  that is
[1:27:58.640 --> 1:28:00.640]  downtown austin
[1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:02.640]  that's congress and 11th street
[1:28:02.640 --> 1:28:04.640]  they've got the capital closed
[1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:06.640]  because of the covid hoax
[1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:08.640]  but right in front of it
[1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:10.640]  big steps to the beginning of the capital grounds
[1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:12.640]  that's the perfect place to have
[1:28:12.640 --> 1:28:14.640]  that flag drop that I think should become a nationwide event
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:16.640]  you heard the caller from chicago talk about
[1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:18.640]  how successful it is
[1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:20.640]  we're going to be out there with our American flags
[1:28:20.640 --> 1:28:22.640]  old glory, texas flag you name it
[1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:24.640]  and that will be tomorrow
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:28.640]  when I went down there this sunday
[1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:30.640]  to what's known as the hill of life
[1:28:30.640 --> 1:28:32.640]  it's like a three quarters
[1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:34.640]  when I went down there this saturday
[1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:36.640]  it's a quarter mile hill
[1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:38.640]  when I went down to the hill of life
[1:28:38.640 --> 1:28:40.640]  this
[1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:42.640]  again I'm cutting a promo here
[1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:44.640]  live on air and
[1:28:44.640 --> 1:28:46.640]  I have tendencies to
[1:28:46.640 --> 1:28:48.640]  when they're doing stuff I have a tendency to watch the screen
[1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:50.640]  and look for the address
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:52.640]  so I can give it out and I just don't have the address
[1:28:52.640 --> 1:28:54.640]  I'm not going to do this now we'll do it later just shut it down
[1:28:54.640 --> 1:28:56.640]  shut it down
[1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:00.640]  not a big deal
[1:29:00.640 --> 1:29:02.640]  for the next segment
[1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:04.640]  please print me the address
[1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:06.640]  because I don't see it on the screen
[1:29:06.640 --> 1:29:08.640]  and I can't tell them the address
[1:29:08.640 --> 1:29:10.640]  um
[1:29:10.640 --> 1:29:12.640]  so I'll do that next segment
[1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:14.640]  I'm going to be broadcast for a minute though
[1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:16.640]  I need to take a break here
[1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:18.640]  stuff sometimes it's not the crew's fault
[1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:20.640]  there's just I'm like the director of my own show
[1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:22.640]  and so it's just very frustrating
[1:29:22.640 --> 1:29:24.640]  the crew does a great job and then I
[1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:26.640]  I need something and I can't tell you the address
[1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:28.640]  if I don't have it and so
[1:29:28.640 --> 1:29:30.640]  or maybe I was missing it on the screen so
[1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:32.640]  I'm just going to get that
[1:29:32.640 --> 1:29:34.640]  just stop
[1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:36.640]  and then we're just going to
[1:29:36.640 --> 1:29:38.640]  do this for a minute I'm going to take a break
[1:29:38.640 --> 1:29:40.640]  the problem is I'm also shooting promos during
[1:29:40.640 --> 1:29:42.640]  the segments I may stop doing that
[1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:44.640]  during the segment breaks because I just
[1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:46.640]  I need to get refocused I need to get
[1:29:46.640 --> 1:29:48.640]  reset and I had a lot I was
[1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:50.640]  going to say and a lot I was going to do
[1:29:50.640 --> 1:29:52.640]  sometimes I go a little astray on that and then we have a problem
[1:29:52.640 --> 1:29:54.640]  so I'm going to go to a very
[1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:56.640]  special
[1:29:56.640 --> 1:29:58.640]  special report here
[1:29:58.640 --> 1:30:00.640]  and then we're going to come back
[1:30:00.640 --> 1:30:02.640]  to maybe later at the end of the show to the promo
[1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:04.640]  for the event
[1:30:04.640 --> 1:30:06.640]  we need to really take action
[1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:08.640]  against this
[1:30:08.640 --> 1:30:10.640]  we need to
[1:30:10.640 --> 1:30:12.640]  be able to
[1:30:12.640 --> 1:30:14.640]  exercise our will because we're being locked
[1:30:14.640 --> 1:30:16.640]  up like treasures in our houses with an
[1:30:16.640 --> 1:30:18.640]  AI grid that's going to control us we're being
[1:30:18.640 --> 1:30:20.640]  taught we're too toxic to be out the public
[1:30:20.640 --> 1:30:22.640]  and that we're evil carbon based life forms
[1:30:22.640 --> 1:30:24.640]  I've always told you the plan is we're dirty we're
[1:30:24.640 --> 1:30:26.640]  bad we're evil we have to be gotten rid of
[1:30:26.640 --> 1:30:28.640]  we're bad for the earth we're bad for other
[1:30:28.640 --> 1:30:30.640]  humans and that's all this is
[1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:32.640]  and this is admitted as into 21 as into
[1:30:32.640 --> 1:30:34.640]  2030 and it's a dystopia
[1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:36.640]  because good people will put up with it
[1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:38.640]  and because you're just
[1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:40.640]  you're not dystopic yourself
[1:30:40.640 --> 1:30:42.640]  so you keep projecting on to it
[1:30:42.640 --> 1:30:44.640]  that it's not bad it is bad and I know
[1:30:44.640 --> 1:30:46.640]  the audience gets that but I'm not
[1:30:46.640 --> 1:30:48.640]  saying all this to try to make it sound
[1:30:48.640 --> 1:30:50.640]  scarier than it is there's not
[1:30:50.640 --> 1:30:52.640]  words describe how diabolical
[1:30:52.640 --> 1:30:54.640]  and organized it is anything
[1:30:54.640 --> 1:30:56.640]  and everything the globalist promote must be
[1:30:56.640 --> 1:30:58.640]  rejected out of hand
[1:30:58.640 --> 1:31:00.640]  let's go to this
[1:31:00.640 --> 1:31:02.640]  special report CNN says Joe Biden
[1:31:02.640 --> 1:31:04.640]  to step down for Kamala Harris
[1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:06.640]  clip 9 CNN says
[1:31:06.640 --> 1:31:08.640]  Joe Biden to step down for Kamala Harris
[1:31:08.640 --> 1:31:10.640]  after election it's on band on video
[1:31:10.640 --> 1:31:12.640]  here it is
[1:31:12.640 --> 1:31:14.640]  this is yet again dead on
[1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:16.640]  over a year ago we predicted
[1:31:16.640 --> 1:31:18.640]  that Joe Biden would simply be a
[1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:20.640]  placeholder for whoever he chose
[1:31:20.640 --> 1:31:22.640]  as his VP running mate
[1:31:22.640 --> 1:31:24.640]  and that he would then step
[1:31:24.640 --> 1:31:26.640]  aside
[1:31:26.640 --> 1:31:28.640]  CNN is now reporting officially
[1:31:28.640 --> 1:31:30.640]  that that is the plan
[1:31:30.640 --> 1:31:32.640]  with Kamala Harris and that he plans
[1:31:32.640 --> 1:31:34.640]  to step aside as soon
[1:31:34.640 --> 1:31:36.640]  as he gets into office
[1:31:36.640 --> 1:31:38.640]  she's bought and paid for
[1:31:38.640 --> 1:31:40.640]  by big tech
[1:31:40.640 --> 1:31:42.640]  she's completely empty like Joe Biden
[1:31:42.640 --> 1:31:44.640]  and will follow the globalist orders
[1:31:44.640 --> 1:31:46.640]  it's Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
[1:31:46.640 --> 1:31:48.640]  on record that have openly
[1:31:48.640 --> 1:31:50.640]  said we should take orders from
[1:31:50.640 --> 1:31:52.640]  China and the communist China
[1:31:52.640 --> 1:31:54.640]  should dictate every facet of our lives
[1:31:54.640 --> 1:31:56.640]  America was only
[1:31:56.640 --> 1:31:58.640]  a few months away from being
[1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:00.640]  completely economically defeated
[1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:02.640]  communist China owned our debt
[1:32:02.640 --> 1:32:04.640]  Hollywood produced almost all of our
[1:32:04.640 --> 1:32:06.640]  prescription drugs manufacturing
[1:32:06.640 --> 1:32:08.640]  and rare earth minerals
[1:32:08.640 --> 1:32:10.640]  the president trump got in office
[1:32:10.640 --> 1:32:12.640]  and now for the last three and a half years
[1:32:12.640 --> 1:32:14.640]  the deep state ally with communist
[1:32:14.640 --> 1:32:16.640]  China has been battling
[1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:18.640]  as hard as they can to shut down
[1:32:18.640 --> 1:32:20.640]  the US economy and ensure that
[1:32:20.640 --> 1:32:22.640]  we lose the trade war with China
[1:32:22.640 --> 1:32:24.640]  months ago and then again weeks ago
[1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:26.640]  M4 Wars was on record
[1:32:26.640 --> 1:32:28.640]  predicting Kamala Harris and not Susan Rice
[1:32:28.640 --> 1:32:30.640]  Susan Rice is a globalist
[1:32:30.640 --> 1:32:32.640]  Susan Rice hates America
[1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:34.640]  but she's intelligent and she
[1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:36.640]  tends to sometimes act on her own
[1:32:36.640 --> 1:32:38.640]  the establishment does
[1:32:38.640 --> 1:32:40.640]  not want that they want someone
[1:32:40.640 --> 1:32:42.640]  totally bought and paid for
[1:32:42.640 --> 1:32:44.640]  completely fake totally sociopathic
[1:32:44.640 --> 1:32:46.640]  like Kamala Harris and now
[1:32:46.640 --> 1:32:48.640]  they found their woman it doesn't matter
[1:32:48.640 --> 1:32:50.640]  if she supported Joe Biden
[1:32:50.640 --> 1:32:52.640]  when she was in the California government
[1:32:52.640 --> 1:32:54.640]  by throwing the book at black Americans
[1:32:54.640 --> 1:32:56.640]  and giving them three times the prison
[1:32:56.640 --> 1:32:58.640]  sentences of white people with minimum
[1:32:58.640 --> 1:33:00.640]  sentencing it doesn't matter if she then
[1:33:00.640 --> 1:33:02.640]  flip-flopped and called Joe Biden
[1:33:02.640 --> 1:33:04.640]  a racist for his busing practices
[1:33:04.640 --> 1:33:06.640]  and also for his
[1:33:06.640 --> 1:33:08.640]  prison practices it doesn't matter
[1:33:08.640 --> 1:33:10.640]  that she came out and said I believe
[1:33:10.640 --> 1:33:12.640]  the women that say he
[1:33:12.640 --> 1:33:14.640]  assaulted them and they should be hurt
[1:33:14.640 --> 1:33:16.640]  she's totally flip-flopping on all of that
[1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:18.640]  now but that's okay because
[1:33:18.640 --> 1:33:20.640]  she's a woman and because
[1:33:20.640 --> 1:33:22.640]  she has a little bit of African blood in her
[1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:24.640]  even though her family was one of the biggest plantation
[1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:26.640]  owners and slave owners in Jamaica
[1:33:26.640 --> 1:33:28.640]  you just can't
[1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:30.640]  make this up so
[1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:32.640]  Trump's here trying to empower the country
[1:33:32.640 --> 1:33:34.640]  trying to turn our industry back on trying to make
[1:33:34.640 --> 1:33:36.640]  fair trade deals trying to rebuild our military
[1:33:36.640 --> 1:33:38.640]  trying to secure our borders
[1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:40.640]  and here comes the slave
[1:33:40.640 --> 1:33:42.640]  master Minyan Kamala
[1:33:42.640 --> 1:33:44.640]  Harris to use the color
[1:33:44.640 --> 1:33:46.640]  of her skin as a pretext
[1:33:46.640 --> 1:33:48.640]  to further destabilize this country and try to
[1:33:48.640 --> 1:33:50.640]  silence any criticism of her and the globalist
[1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:52.640]  agenda the new world order control
[1:33:52.640 --> 1:33:54.640]  freaks don't just like Kamala Harris
[1:33:54.640 --> 1:33:56.640]  they love her because she's a rubber stamp
[1:33:56.640 --> 1:33:58.640]  for her agenda she wants the entire
[1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:00.640]  green deal that was shut down our economy
[1:34:00.640 --> 1:34:02.640]  she wants to restrict red meat and ban
[1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:04.640]  plastic straws she wants to get rid of our oil
[1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:06.640]  industry this woman is
[1:34:06.640 --> 1:34:08.640]  a globalist weapon system
[1:34:08.640 --> 1:34:10.640]  but most importantly in the final equation
[1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:12.640]  remember that she's been very honest
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:14.640]  about her views on the Second Amendment
[1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:16.640]  and wants all semi-autos banned
[1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:18.640]  and would sign an executive order
[1:34:18.640 --> 1:34:20.640]  and have them confiscated
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:22.640]  she believes as Beto O'Rourke does
[1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:24.640]  that it's time to take all Americans
[1:34:24.640 --> 1:34:26.640]  semi-automatic firearms completing
[1:34:26.640 --> 1:34:28.640]  our journey into total slavery
[1:34:28.640 --> 1:34:30.640]  while at the same time she wants to defund
[1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:32.640]  the police and let criminals run wild
[1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:34.640]  but again tell us
[1:34:34.640 --> 1:34:36.640]  we don't have a right to protect ourselves
[1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:38.640]  while she is a senator with armed bodyguards
[1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:40.640]  and will now have secret service protection
[1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:42.640]  as the VP pick of Joe Biden
[1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:44.640]  hypocrisy, fraud
[1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:46.640]  deceit, corruption
[1:34:46.640 --> 1:34:48.640]  two-facedness
[1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:50.640]  hatred of America
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:52.640]  a tax on the family
[1:34:52.640 --> 1:34:54.640]  a tax on males
[1:34:54.640 --> 1:34:56.640]  a tax on everything that makes our country strong
[1:34:56.640 --> 1:34:58.640]  Kamala Harris was rejected
[1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:00.640]  and was only polling at
[1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:02.640]  1% during the Democrat primaries
[1:35:02.640 --> 1:35:04.640]  particularly amongst black Americans
[1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:06.640]  they saw the fake fraud
[1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:08.640]  she was. Willy Brown dated every
[1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:10.640]  three years the mayor of San Francisco
[1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:12.640]  and says she's bad news
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:14.640]  he begged Biden if you're going to pick a black woman
[1:35:14.640 --> 1:35:16.640]  pick a real black woman this lady is not trustworthy
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:18.640]  her own boyfriend
[1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:20.640]  is warning the world
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:22.640]  but again establishment believes
[1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:24.640]  they can override the people's will
[1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:26.640]  the Democratic Party's will
[1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:28.640]  the populace will and force
[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:30.640]  these two minions into the White House
[1:35:30.640 --> 1:35:32.640]  so the globalists can complete
[1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:34.640]  our journey into total collapse
[1:35:34.640 --> 1:35:36.640]  they are openly saying
[1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:38.640]  they're going to challenge the election when Trump wins
[1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:40.640]  if he challenges their challenge
[1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:42.640]  they're saying he's a dictator
[1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:44.640]  and have called the military to overthrow him
[1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:46.640]  this is all being announced as the official
[1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:48.640]  plan
[1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:50.640]  in the next 80 days America is fighting
[1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:52.640]  for its life
[1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:54.640]  that's why you out there watching
[1:35:54.640 --> 1:35:56.640]  need to raise the alarm as the modern polar of years
[1:35:56.640 --> 1:35:58.640]  and by word of mouth share this report
[1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:00.640]  and other reports from band.video
[1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:02.640]  infowars.com.
[1:36:02.640 --> 1:36:04.640]  to override the AI sensors
[1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:06.640]  we've been doing it and that's why Trump's winning
[1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:08.640]  and why a landslide is coming
[1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:10.640]  but just because a huge red wave
[1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:12.640]  is coming in they're building a huge
[1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:14.640]  seawall of election fraud
[1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:16.640]  grace war and tyranny so even though a landslide
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:18.640]  is coming their fraud they'd be able to
[1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:20.640]  block it and there's going to be a huge confrontation
[1:36:20.640 --> 1:36:22.640]  I'm getting chills right now
[1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:24.640]  I know you are
[1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:26.640]  we are living to see America
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:28.640]  fight for its life and win
[1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:30.640]  if we all take action god bless
[1:36:30.640 --> 1:36:32.640]  and good luck
[1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:34.640]  and by the way if you're watching on TV
[1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:36.640]  the green belt I'm on is what they're banning the public from
[1:36:36.640 --> 1:36:38.640]  you notice I just do whatever I want
[1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:40.640]  and by the way I'll announce when we come back
[1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:42.640]  I'm going down there saturday with American flags
[1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:44.640]  and I'm marching to that
[1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:46.640]  green belt nothing's going to stop me
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:48.640]  attention attention attention
[1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:50.640]  attention to anyone that still
[1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:52.640]  wants to live in a free country
[1:36:52.640 --> 1:36:54.640]  the new world order
[1:36:54.640 --> 1:36:56.640]  chicom globalist syndicate
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:36:58.640]  is making its move to implode the dollar
[1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:00.640]  and thrust the united states into a civil war
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:02.640]  by contesting the election
[1:37:02.640 --> 1:37:04.640]  they are openly work aiming this
[1:37:04.640 --> 1:37:06.640]  at the highest levels of democratic party
[1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:08.640]  Nancy Pelosi and others have gone on television
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:10.640]  and said they will contest the election
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:12.640]  Trump is going they will hold
[1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:14.640]  a separate inauguration
[1:37:14.640 --> 1:37:16.640]  for Biden and Kamala Harris
[1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:18.640]  and that anyone challenging that will be called a racist
[1:37:18.640 --> 1:37:20.640]  they will then trigger
[1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:22.640]  race riots and violence they've already beta tested
[1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:24.640]  around the country
[1:37:24.640 --> 1:37:26.640]  we are not living in normal times
[1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:28.640]  when these type of things happen in history
[1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:30.640]  people are usually caught flat footed
[1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:32.640]  because they can't believe that they're living
[1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:34.640]  in such a criminal era
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:36.640]  we are we are living in the period
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:38.640]  where this criminal globalist syndicate
[1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:40.640]  that's been feeding on America is being exposed
[1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:42.640]  and removed now is the time
[1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:44.640]  for all good men and women to come to their aid
[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:46.640]  of the country spread the word now
[1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:48.640]  Paul Revere's incrementalism
[1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:50.640]  the inchworm effect
[1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:52.640]  successive approximation
[1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:54.640]  first they tell you only stay
[1:37:54.640 --> 1:37:56.640]  in your house for 15 days
[1:37:56.640 --> 1:37:58.640]  the hospitals can stay empty
[1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:00.640]  that was all a fraud then wear a mask for a month
[1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:02.640]  here we are six months later
[1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:04.640]  then they start making people at colleges
[1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:06.640]  and at big corporations
[1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:08.640]  where wristbands
[1:38:08.640 --> 1:38:10.640]  showing that they've been quote
[1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:12.640]  contact traced and tested for COVID
[1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:14.640]  then comes the apps
[1:38:14.640 --> 1:38:16.640]  on your phones and the global social credit score
[1:38:16.640 --> 1:38:18.640]  now being rolled out by Virginia
[1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:20.640]  California and others
[1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:22.640]  it's not coming it's here
[1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:24.640]  and then the inoculations
[1:38:24.640 --> 1:38:26.640]  which amounts to forced inoculations
[1:38:26.640 --> 1:38:28.640]  this is the medical tyranny takeover
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:30.640]  these are not classic vaccines
[1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:32.640]  that have their own problems
[1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:34.640]  these are DNA vaccines that change
[1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:36.640]  your DNA and are having
[1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:38.640]  massive serious side effects
[1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:40.640]  guaranteed this is about
[1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:42.640]  depopulation Bill Gates admits that
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:44.640]  this is an emergency resist
[1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:46.640]  or die the new world order is here
[1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:48.640]  when the corrupt establishment
[1:38:48.640 --> 1:38:50.640]  began pushing Joe Biden
[1:38:50.640 --> 1:38:52.640]  two years ago they knew
[1:38:52.640 --> 1:38:54.640]  he had serious cognitive problems
[1:38:54.640 --> 1:38:56.640]  he has always been an empty suit
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:38:58.640]  that does what he's told
[1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:00.640]  by the globalist and their allied crime syndicates
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:02.640]  Kamala Harris is even worse
[1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:04.640]  than does whatever she's told
[1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:06.640]  she's bought and paid for by
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:08.640]  Silicon Valley the chai comms
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:10.640]  and others so
[1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:12.640]  she has been chosen because
[1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:14.640]  she's part African and now
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:16.640]  anyone that criticizes her
[1:39:16.640 --> 1:39:18.640]  will be called a racist and evil
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:20.640]  and she is now above reproach
[1:39:20.640 --> 1:39:22.640]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:24.640]  we must expose this monster
[1:39:24.640 --> 1:39:26.640]  for who she is we must
[1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:28.640]  expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences
[1:39:28.640 --> 1:39:30.640]  for black people three times longer
[1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:32.640]  than white people and that the woman
[1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:34.640]  is a monster
[1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:36.640]  Kamala Harris will end up
[1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:38.640]  being our president if they're able to steal
[1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:40.640]  the election and she is a 110%
[1:39:40.640 --> 1:39:42.640]  new world order
[1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:44.640]  puppet now more than ever
[1:39:44.640 --> 1:39:46.640]  we must expose this monster
[1:39:46.640 --> 1:39:48.640]  we must expose the globalist
[1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:50.640]  how do you contest an election
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:52.640]  in the year 2020
[1:39:52.640 --> 1:39:54.640]  well you trigger race riots
[1:39:54.640 --> 1:39:56.640]  and you tell
[1:39:56.640 --> 1:39:58.640]  the blue states and blue cities when you're the speaker
[1:39:58.640 --> 1:40:00.640]  of the house that you are legitimately
[1:40:00.640 --> 1:40:02.640]  now the president that's what she's
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:04.640]  said on CBS news
[1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:06.640]  and that you're going to have those blue states
[1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:08.640]  succeed yes that's officially
[1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:10.640]  called a civil war
[1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:12.640]  ladies and gentlemen the democrats are back
[1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:14.640]  by the EU Hollywood the chai comms
[1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:16.640]  and the whole globalist system this is
[1:40:16.640 --> 1:40:18.640]  treason with a capital T
[1:40:18.640 --> 1:40:20.640]  and our federal government is so paralyzed
[1:40:20.640 --> 1:40:22.640]  with cowards they won't even stand up
[1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:24.640]  against it and do anything even though
[1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:26.640]  our president has been exposing it

[1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:40.640]  we're going to have a great depression war on the streets
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:42.640]  that will make a road warrior look like a take a walk

[1:40:52.640 --> 1:41:21.640]  Alex Jones show
[1:41:21.640 --> 1:41:23.640]  all over the world
[1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:25.640]  the united nations directed
[1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:27.640]  lockdown is going into stage four
[1:41:27.640 --> 1:41:29.640]  in places like
[1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:31.640]  Melbourne Australia
[1:41:31.640 --> 1:41:33.640]  they are completely
[1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:35.640]  locking down entire cities
[1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:37.640]  entire tower blocks
[1:41:37.640 --> 1:41:39.640]  for weeks and weeks and months
[1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:41.640]  and you can't even leave your house
[1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:43.640]  even with a mask on
[1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:45.640]  and now the UN says they want to come
[1:41:45.640 --> 1:41:47.640]  into your house and take
[1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:49.640]  your children
[1:41:49.640 --> 1:41:51.640]  now New Zealand is announcing this
[1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:53.640]  this is all a united nations
[1:41:53.640 --> 1:41:55.640]  power grab
[1:41:55.640 --> 1:41:57.640]  and so
[1:41:57.640 --> 1:41:59.640]  this Saturday
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:01.640]  at high noon
[1:42:01.640 --> 1:42:03.640]  I'm going to one of the main
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:05.640]  greenbelt park entrances
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:07.640]  in Austin Texas
[1:42:07.640 --> 1:42:09.640]  if you're coming in from outside town all you do is put in
[1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:11.640]  the hill of life
[1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:13.640]  1710
[1:42:13.640 --> 1:42:15.640]  Camp craft road
[1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:17.640]  Austin Texas 787
[1:42:17.640 --> 1:42:19.640]  4
[1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:21.640]  6
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:23.640]  open now
[1:42:23.640 --> 1:42:25.640]  5am to 10pm
[1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:27.640]  but when you get there
[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:29.640]  they now have contact tracers there
[1:42:29.640 --> 1:42:31.640]  wanting your driver's license
[1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:33.640]  your name your number
[1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:35.640]  for contact tracing
[1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:37.640]  and they're only letting in
[1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:39.640]  people
[1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:41.640]  when they first set up their checkpoint
[1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:43.640]  after that everyone else is turned back
[1:42:43.640 --> 1:42:45.640]  I went past the checkpoint
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:47.640]  down checked it
[1:42:47.640 --> 1:42:49.640]  no one was there
[1:42:49.640 --> 1:42:51.640]  normally at this one entrance parking on the local streets
[1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:53.640]  you'll have by noon on a Saturday
[1:42:53.640 --> 1:42:55.640]  when there's lots of rain and the creek's full
[1:42:55.640 --> 1:42:57.640]  100-200 vehicles
[1:42:57.640 --> 1:42:59.640]  there were six or seven vehicles
[1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:01.640]  when I got there
[1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:03.640]  most of those were quote
[1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:05.640]  park police which didn't exist until recently
[1:43:05.640 --> 1:43:07.640]  they are SJWs
[1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:09.640]  we've got footage
[1:43:09.640 --> 1:43:11.640]  of the old park entrance
[1:43:11.640 --> 1:43:13.640]  now they've got a green divider set up
[1:43:13.640 --> 1:43:15.640]  with plexiglass
[1:43:15.640 --> 1:43:17.640]  for the kabuki theater
[1:43:17.640 --> 1:43:19.640]  that you stand behind
[1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:21.640]  when they refuse to let you in
[1:43:21.640 --> 1:43:23.640]  to this particular entrance
[1:43:23.640 --> 1:43:25.640]  it is a quarter of a mile
[1:43:25.640 --> 1:43:27.640]  steep grade down and back up
[1:43:27.640 --> 1:43:29.640]  people like Lance Armstrong
[1:43:29.640 --> 1:43:31.640]  who lives nearby are routinely on it
[1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:33.640]  I've seen him there probably 20 times
[1:43:33.640 --> 1:43:35.640]  running up and down in the morning
[1:43:35.640 --> 1:43:37.640]  that's the type of stuff that's going on there
[1:43:37.640 --> 1:43:39.640]  at the bottom you come to
[1:43:39.640 --> 1:43:41.640]  Barton Creek and this footage
[1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:43.640]  looks like it was shot
[1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:47.640]  a few years ago
[1:43:47.640 --> 1:43:49.640]  because now it's even up higher
[1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:51.640]  and I recognize that area
[1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:53.640]  and know the lay of the land and the brush
[1:43:53.640 --> 1:43:55.640]  so it's very very pretty
[1:43:55.640 --> 1:43:57.640]  but you can see in this footage that
[1:43:57.640 --> 1:43:59.640]  the woman goes down there with her dog
[1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:01.640]  there is no one there
[1:44:01.640 --> 1:44:03.640]  because
[1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:05.640]  it's several hundred square miles
[1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:07.640]  and all it is is entrances by people's houses
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:09.640]  down to it
[1:44:09.640 --> 1:44:11.640]  it's a canyon and they can't build on it
[1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:13.640]  so the city bought it
[1:44:13.640 --> 1:44:15.640]  now
[1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:17.640]  Lake Austin which is just a damn Colorado
[1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:19.640]  dumps
[1:44:19.640 --> 1:44:21.640]  into it
[1:44:21.640 --> 1:44:23.640]  and it dumps into it
[1:44:23.640 --> 1:44:25.640]  and on the side where people are on houses
[1:44:25.640 --> 1:44:27.640]  there's boating and swimming
[1:44:27.640 --> 1:44:29.640]  but on the side that hits downtown
[1:44:29.640 --> 1:44:31.640]  they tell you
[1:44:31.640 --> 1:44:33.640]  no swimming allowed just
[1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:35.640]  in the last decade because they don't want
[1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:37.640]  the common slave being able
[1:44:37.640 --> 1:44:39.640]  to swim in that beautiful body
[1:44:39.640 --> 1:44:41.640]  of water imagine being
[1:44:41.640 --> 1:44:43.640]  able to park your car
[1:44:43.640 --> 1:44:45.640]  in some areas walk down a hundred yards
[1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:47.640]  and you're on water like that
[1:44:47.640 --> 1:44:49.640]  radio listeners are missing
[1:44:49.640 --> 1:44:51.640]  and because the city
[1:44:51.640 --> 1:44:53.640]  bought for hundreds of millions of
[1:44:53.640 --> 1:44:55.640]  dollars
[1:44:55.640 --> 1:44:57.640]  over 20 miles of it
[1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:01.640]  in some cases going out over a thousand
[1:45:01.640 --> 1:45:03.640]  acres on each side
[1:45:03.640 --> 1:45:05.640]  it's incredible you can get lost
[1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:07.640]  out there
[1:45:07.640 --> 1:45:09.640]  they don't want you on it and again
[1:45:09.640 --> 1:45:11.640]  Paul Watson wrote about this for Summit.News
[1:45:11.640 --> 1:45:13.640]  and on his Twitter article his Twitter link
[1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:15.640]  people are like yeah I'm in Spain
[1:45:15.640 --> 1:45:17.640]  yeah I'm in Australia yeah I'm in the US
[1:45:17.640 --> 1:45:19.640]  the state parks close the national parks
[1:45:19.640 --> 1:45:21.640]  close I mean they they say oh it's
[1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:23.640]  open but they're not giving anyone reservations
[1:45:23.640 --> 1:45:25.640]  they're empty
[1:45:27.640 --> 1:45:29.640]  because it's agenda 21 they don't want
[1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:31.640]  anyone there so God gave us this planet
[1:45:31.640 --> 1:45:33.640]  and gave us this this dominion
[1:45:33.640 --> 1:45:35.640]  and I used to read to people
[1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:37.640]  out of agenda 21
[1:45:37.640 --> 1:45:39.640]  out of agenda 20 30
[1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:41.640]  I made a film about it called America's Road by Design
[1:45:41.640 --> 1:45:43.640]  in 1997 and people said okay there's UN
[1:45:43.640 --> 1:45:45.640]  signs the regulations
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:47.640]  and the treaties say the UN run it
[1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:49.640]  but they'll never
[1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:51.640]  make you come by reservation
[1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:53.640]  and not let people in
[1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:55.640]  guess what
[1:45:55.640 --> 1:45:57.640]  they do now
[1:45:57.640 --> 1:45:59.640]  and that's
[1:45:59.640 --> 1:46:01.640]  what all of this is about
[1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:03.640]  they were making people get reservations
[1:46:03.640 --> 1:46:05.640]  but it didn't hit home
[1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:07.640]  so my wife comes back
[1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:09.640]  and she wasn't even mad she just said
[1:46:09.640 --> 1:46:11.640]  man these punk kids are like really
[1:46:11.640 --> 1:46:13.640]  rude to me and my friend
[1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:15.640]  or friends of the successful realtor
[1:46:15.640 --> 1:46:17.640]  and
[1:46:17.640 --> 1:46:19.640]  and again they're both nice numbers
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:21.640]  you know what I mean imagine good looking professional
[1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:23.640]  women can't even
[1:46:23.640 --> 1:46:25.640]  go down to the creek
[1:46:25.640 --> 1:46:27.640]  on public property
[1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:29.640]  without snot nose girls
[1:46:29.640 --> 1:46:31.640]  what are you doing here you don't have a reservation
[1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:33.640]  I said to my wife did you get in her face
[1:46:33.640 --> 1:46:35.640]  no no the country is just gone
[1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:37.640]  we just got to move out of here
[1:46:37.640 --> 1:46:39.640]  and I'm like move out they'll get us to the next place
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:41.640]  I'm going down there
[1:46:41.640 --> 1:46:43.640]  and again this is a microcosm of everything
[1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:45.640]  when are we
[1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:47.640]  going to start pushing back
[1:46:49.640 --> 1:46:51.640]  because of COVID-19
[1:46:51.640 --> 1:46:53.640]  the biggest city park
[1:46:53.640 --> 1:46:55.640]  in the country
[1:46:55.640 --> 1:46:57.640]  pull up a satellite shot of Austin
[1:46:57.640 --> 1:46:59.640]  the entire
[1:46:59.640 --> 1:47:01.640]  central
[1:47:01.640 --> 1:47:03.640]  and western area you'll notice there's a green
[1:47:03.640 --> 1:47:05.640]  sliver like a triangle
[1:47:05.640 --> 1:47:07.640]  that starts downtown and goes
[1:47:07.640 --> 1:47:09.640]  all the way out into the hill country
[1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:11.640]  and they bought even more land out in the hill country
[1:47:11.640 --> 1:47:13.640]  300,000
[1:47:13.640 --> 1:47:15.640]  plus acres
[1:47:15.640 --> 1:47:17.640]  in the hill country owned by Austin
[1:47:17.640 --> 1:47:19.640]  and Kirk Watson who became a state senator
[1:47:19.640 --> 1:47:21.640]  and set up a bank that administers
[1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:23.640]  all the land
[1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:25.640]  oh my god you got zoom in on
[1:47:25.640 --> 1:47:27.640]  Austin and show people see where it's all green out there zoom in
[1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:29.640]  no houses on that
[1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:31.640]  zoom in
[1:47:31.640 --> 1:47:33.640]  see the whole life right there and then all the way out west
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:35.640]  they have seized all of it
[1:47:35.640 --> 1:47:37.640]  and I warned people at the time I said listen
[1:47:37.640 --> 1:47:39.640]  the green belt's already there
[1:47:39.640 --> 1:47:41.640]  you can already go down on that
[1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:43.640]  you don't need to borrow the land around it they're going to steal it
[1:47:43.640 --> 1:47:45.640]  they're going to turn
[1:47:45.640 --> 1:47:47.640]  around and develop it and guess what they've done
[1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:49.640]  out west of town and the 300,000 acres
[1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:51.640]  they got they built ranch hatch on it
[1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:53.640]  and they all became fabulously rich
[1:47:53.640 --> 1:47:55.640]  and now they're seizing control
[1:47:55.640 --> 1:47:57.640]  and it's the same in every country every area
[1:47:57.640 --> 1:47:59.640]  in the 80s and 90s they grab
[1:47:59.640 --> 1:48:01.640]  the green belts and now
[1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:03.640]  worldwide they're selling them
[1:48:03.640 --> 1:48:05.640]  off but before they can do
[1:48:05.640 --> 1:48:07.640]  that they got to minimize it they got to
[1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:09.640]  cut it back and they got to teach you not
[1:48:09.640 --> 1:48:11.640]  to use it
[1:48:11.640 --> 1:48:13.640]  and there's nothing a dirty liberal likes
[1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:15.640]  more than being abused by liberals
[1:48:15.640 --> 1:48:17.640]  above them
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:19.640]  and so I'm down there going we paid for this
[1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:21.640]  it's in the law it's ours the police
[1:48:21.640 --> 1:48:23.640]  say it's not enforceable there's not even
[1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:25.640]  a law to keep me off this the police are
[1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:27.640]  he's right you kids get off
[1:48:27.640 --> 1:48:29.640]  this you can't do this the cops
[1:48:29.640 --> 1:48:31.640]  put their jobs on the line they were
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:33.640]  all saluting me when I left
[1:48:33.640 --> 1:48:35.640]  because they know the law
[1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:37.640]  but it doesn't matter
[1:48:37.640 --> 1:48:39.640]  the alchemy of the austin america
[1:48:39.640 --> 1:48:41.640]  statesman
[1:48:41.640 --> 1:48:43.640]  says I just screamed at innocent
[1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:45.640]  people guarding a swimming pool
[1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:47.640]  look at this crazy guy
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:49.640]  he just screamed at lifeguards for no reason
[1:48:49.640 --> 1:48:51.640]  I show up
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:53.640]  they say hey you got a reservation
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:55.640]  you got a pass no I don't
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:57.640]  and all of a sudden I hear like you're a jerk
[1:48:57.640 --> 1:48:59.640]  I hate you FU I turn around girls like flipping me off
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:03.640]  these are hateful nobodies
[1:49:03.640 --> 1:49:05.640]  but that's how tyranny works in Nazi Germany
[1:49:05.640 --> 1:49:07.640]  the Hitler youth are in malice
[1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:09.640]  malice youth brigades who do you think
[1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:11.640]  antifa is
[1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:13.640]  so again this is a microcosm
[1:49:13.640 --> 1:49:15.640]  of everything on
[1:49:15.640 --> 1:49:17.640]  this planet right now you're being
[1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:19.640]  hurted
[1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:21.640]  you're being taught to submit
[1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:23.640]  and the footage
[1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:25.640]  people shot at the greenbelt is just atrocious
[1:49:25.640 --> 1:49:27.640]  we ought to go down there and shoot some b-roll for it
[1:49:27.640 --> 1:49:29.640]  it's totally bad
[1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:31.640]  they'll just say it doesn't exist next
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:33.640]  it'll be a conspiracy theory
[1:49:33.640 --> 1:49:35.640]  if you say it exists then they'll just bulldoze it all
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:37.640]  put more golf courses on it
[1:49:37.640 --> 1:49:39.640]  and say it never existed
[1:49:39.640 --> 1:49:41.640]  I'm telling you they're now saying
[1:49:41.640 --> 1:49:43.640]  that they might outlaw vaginal
[1:49:43.640 --> 1:49:45.640]  birth
[1:49:45.640 --> 1:49:47.640]  I told you 20 years ago they'll someday
[1:49:47.640 --> 1:49:49.640]  say vaginal birth doesn't exist
[1:49:49.640 --> 1:49:51.640]  and that breastfeeding doesn't exist
[1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:53.640]  and they already try to keep the baby away the first day
[1:49:53.640 --> 1:49:55.640]  so the mother's milk doesn't come in
[1:49:55.640 --> 1:49:57.640]  so they can put them on the formula and the brain
[1:49:57.640 --> 1:49:59.640]  is 20% smaller on average
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:01.640]  with a massive IQ reduction
[1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:03.640]  this is all
[1:50:03.640 --> 1:50:05.640]  scientific turning us
[1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:07.640]  into these mindless jellyfish
[1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:09.640]  but I'm going down there
[1:50:09.640 --> 1:50:11.640]  this Saturday noon
[1:50:11.640 --> 1:50:13.640]  we're gonna have our American flags
[1:50:13.640 --> 1:50:15.640]  and we're gonna march right past the contact tracers
[1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:17.640]  and we're gonna go down to that water
[1:50:17.640 --> 1:50:19.640]  and we're gonna swim so go swimming
[1:50:19.640 --> 1:50:21.640]  with Alex Jones in Barton Creek
[1:50:21.640 --> 1:50:23.640]  this Saturday
[1:50:23.640 --> 1:50:25.640]  high noon
[1:50:25.640 --> 1:50:27.640]  and they'll probably stand down
[1:50:27.640 --> 1:50:29.640]  because that's what they do
[1:50:29.640 --> 1:50:31.640]  they don't want to show us like Rosa Parks
[1:50:31.640 --> 1:50:33.640]  sit at the front of the bus I predict they stand down
[1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:35.640]  but if they don't even better
[1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:37.640]  and then next week
[1:50:37.640 --> 1:50:39.640]  we're gonna go somewhere else we're gonna go to Barton Springs itself
[1:50:39.640 --> 1:50:41.640]  1710 Campcraft Road
[1:50:41.640 --> 1:50:43.640]  Austin, Texas 78746
[1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:45.640]  The Hill of Life
[1:50:47.640 --> 1:50:49.640]  and Owen loves to demonstrate
[1:50:49.640 --> 1:50:51.640]  Owen will go out to the first Austin Friday flag drop
[1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:53.640]  6pm after a show
[1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:55.640]  downtown in front of the Capitol
[1:50:55.640 --> 1:50:57.640]  he'll do that I'll do this
[1:50:57.640 --> 1:50:59.640]  Owen's invited over the crew wants to go bring your dogs
[1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:01.640]  bring everything
[1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:03.640]  and we're gonna go down there we're gonna enjoy
[1:51:03.640 --> 1:51:05.640]  the land that Austin citizens
[1:51:05.640 --> 1:51:07.640]  paid for that has been stolen
[1:51:07.640 --> 1:51:09.640]  and wherever you are in the country
[1:51:09.640 --> 1:51:11.640]  organize your own and do it
[1:51:11.640 --> 1:51:13.640]  like the Chicago guy with the flag drop
[1:51:13.640 --> 1:51:15.640]  that's spreading everywhere great idea let's adopt it
[1:51:15.640 --> 1:51:17.640]  this idea take back our parks
[1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:19.640]  take back our beaches take back our land
[1:51:19.640 --> 1:51:21.640]  just like they've done in California this is the same thing
[1:51:21.640 --> 1:51:23.640]  and the police are saying yeah
[1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:25.640]  there's not even an ordinance they can't stop you
[1:51:25.640 --> 1:51:27.640]  but that turns into Jones bullies
[1:51:27.640 --> 1:51:29.640]  women yeah oh like Jeffrey Epstein
[1:51:29.640 --> 1:51:31.640]  tortures kids you mean like that
[1:51:31.640 --> 1:51:33.640]  you child molesting devil worshipers
[1:51:33.640 --> 1:51:37.640]  we'll be right back
[1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:39.640]  the social engineers bet on
[1:51:39.640 --> 1:51:41.640]  you not having a memory more than anything
[1:51:41.640 --> 1:51:43.640]  they also bet is they constantly
[1:51:43.640 --> 1:51:45.640]  talk about it in their own words
[1:51:45.640 --> 1:51:47.640]  that you will adapt to being a slave
[1:51:47.640 --> 1:51:49.640]  that you will learn incrementally
[1:51:49.640 --> 1:51:51.640]  to submit so think about and remember
[1:51:51.640 --> 1:51:53.640]  the phases of the Fauci fraud
[1:51:53.640 --> 1:51:55.640]  remember that everything he said
[1:51:55.640 --> 1:51:57.640]  has been a premeditated lie
[1:51:57.640 --> 1:51:59.640]  they lied about where it came from
[1:51:59.640 --> 1:52:01.640]  they lied about person to person the UN
[1:52:01.640 --> 1:52:03.640]  covered it all up then exaggerated
[1:52:03.640 --> 1:52:05.640]  the death rate at 4%
[1:52:05.640 --> 1:52:07.640]  but it's actually 0.032 now
[1:52:07.640 --> 1:52:09.640]  and dropping
[1:52:09.640 --> 1:52:11.640]  then they set the test
[1:52:11.640 --> 1:52:13.640]  up to count almost all false positives
[1:52:13.640 --> 1:52:15.640]  they put the names of people that died of other diseases
[1:52:15.640 --> 1:52:17.640]  in the COVID column
[1:52:17.640 --> 1:52:19.640]  they only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown
[1:52:19.640 --> 1:52:21.640]  now we're six months later now they say
[1:52:21.640 --> 1:52:23.640]  it's permanent you got to wear masks forever
[1:52:23.640 --> 1:52:25.640]  and forced inoculations are coming
[1:52:25.640 --> 1:52:27.640]  and they're going to track everywhere you go
[1:52:27.640 --> 1:52:29.640]  what you do the global social credit score
[1:52:29.640 --> 1:52:31.640]  is the boss anybody questioning it
[1:52:31.640 --> 1:52:33.640]  is censored off the internet loses their job
[1:52:33.640 --> 1:52:35.640]  that's called 21st century tyranny
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:37.640]  that's called world government takeover
[1:52:37.640 --> 1:52:39.640]  the new world order
[1:52:39.640 --> 1:52:41.640]  is a planetary corporate plan
[1:52:41.640 --> 1:52:43.640]  for world government
[1:52:43.640 --> 1:52:45.640]  but world government is only
[1:52:45.640 --> 1:52:47.640]  the control grid now
[1:52:47.640 --> 1:52:49.640]  intermembers of the cult
[1:52:49.640 --> 1:52:51.640]  are told that they are going to
[1:52:51.640 --> 1:52:53.640]  transcend and become gods
[1:52:53.640 --> 1:52:55.640]  and attain immortality but the price for that
[1:52:55.640 --> 1:52:57.640]  is to carry out the orderly
[1:52:57.640 --> 1:52:59.640]  extermination of all
[1:52:59.640 --> 1:53:01.640]  carbon based line forms
[1:53:01.640 --> 1:53:03.640]  that's why they say carbon is bad
[1:53:03.640 --> 1:53:05.640]  they are rewriting the entire genetic code
[1:53:05.640 --> 1:53:07.640]  of the planet
[1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:09.640]  they are playing god
[1:53:09.640 --> 1:53:11.640]  they believe they have been inspired
[1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:13.640]  by interdimensional entities
[1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:15.640]  that are giving them advanced technology
[1:53:15.640 --> 1:53:17.640]  to carry out
[1:53:17.640 --> 1:53:19.640]  this transformation
[1:53:19.640 --> 1:53:21.640]  I know this sounds insane but if you read the writings
[1:53:21.640 --> 1:53:23.640]  of the globalist it's all on record
[1:53:23.640 --> 1:53:25.640]  you have been warned
[1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:27.640]  you have been
[1:53:27.640 --> 1:53:29.640]  given the information
[1:53:29.640 --> 1:53:31.640]  to say no to this plan
[1:53:31.640 --> 1:53:33.640]  this is the end of all life
[1:53:33.640 --> 1:53:35.640]  on earth as we know it
[1:53:35.640 --> 1:53:57.640]  is the alien takeover of earth
[1:54:05.640 --> 1:54:07.640]  keep rolling rolling rolling
[1:54:07.640 --> 1:54:09.640]  though the strange is swollen

[1:54:13.640 --> 1:54:15.640]  rain and wind and weather
[1:54:15.640 --> 1:54:17.640]  hell and feather
[1:54:17.640 --> 1:54:19.640]  wishing my girl was by my side
[1:54:19.640 --> 1:54:21.640]  all the things I'm missing
[1:54:21.640 --> 1:54:23.640]  good little love and kissing
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:25.640]  are waiting at the end of my ride

[1:54:53.640 --> 1:54:55.640]  though they're disapproven
[1:54:57.640 --> 1:54:59.640]  they think you're cattle
[1:54:59.640 --> 1:55:03.640]  they're hurting you
[1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:07.640]  they want to brand you with their
[1:55:07.640 --> 1:55:09.640]  inoculation
[1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:11.640]  my ride's calculating

[1:55:13.640 --> 1:55:15.640]  be waited at the end of my ride
[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:17.640]  so teach some americans to submit

[1:55:27.640 --> 1:55:29.640]  roll hard
[1:55:47.640 --> 1:55:49.640]  and that is the anthem of the democrats
[1:55:49.640 --> 1:55:51.640]  and the globalists
[1:55:51.640 --> 1:55:53.640]  I didn't even get to any of the news
[1:55:53.640 --> 1:55:55.640]  I went off on a jag about
[1:55:55.640 --> 1:55:57.640]  the world government and that must be the number one on twitter
[1:55:57.640 --> 1:55:59.640]  and the deception around it and then
[1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:01.640]  put up the fake story that I said child porn
[1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:03.640]  the sandy hook families I mean these people
[1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:05.640]  are the scum of the earth
[1:56:05.640 --> 1:56:07.640]  the absolute scum of the earth
[1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:09.640]  and no one buys their BS
[1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:11.640]  so they're just going to lock everything down
[1:56:11.640 --> 1:56:13.640]  and try to get the cops
[1:56:13.640 --> 1:56:15.640]  who they also want to abolish once they've done their bidding
[1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:17.640]  to enforce a bunch of crap
[1:56:17.640 --> 1:56:19.640]  on you and your family
[1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:21.640]  now we got some big guests coming up today
[1:56:21.640 --> 1:56:23.640]  Sam Hyde
[1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:25.640]  Sam Hyde his big
[1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:27.640]  and funny medium is going to be co-hosting
[1:56:27.640 --> 1:56:29.640]  with Jay Dyer
[1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:31.640]  Ali Alexander who writes for a lot of big
[1:56:31.640 --> 1:56:33.640]  publications like culture.com
[1:56:33.640 --> 1:56:35.640]  and I know human events his back is doing work over there
[1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:37.640]  he's coming up with us
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:39.640]  next segment
[1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:41.640]  and I've also got to go over this
[1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:43.640]  I mean they're telling you don't have sex
[1:56:43.640 --> 1:56:45.640]  without wearing a mask
[1:56:45.640 --> 1:56:47.640]  and now democratic party is ordering people
[1:56:47.640 --> 1:56:49.640]  in their zoom meetings to wear masks
[1:56:49.640 --> 1:56:51.640]  by themselves I mean
[1:56:51.640 --> 1:56:53.640]  and you're like well that's ridiculous it's all
[1:56:53.640 --> 1:56:55.640]  ridiculous
[1:56:55.640 --> 1:56:57.640]  that's the point of a cult
[1:56:57.640 --> 1:56:59.640]  imagine if I said well if you're our listeners
[1:56:59.640 --> 1:57:01.640]  send in videos of you standing on your head
[1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:03.640]  with your thumb up your ass
[1:57:03.640 --> 1:57:05.640]  oh it's the family show sorry
[1:57:05.640 --> 1:57:07.640]  I mean
[1:57:09.640 --> 1:57:11.640]  or you know join the Japanese
[1:57:11.640 --> 1:57:13.640]  mafia cut off
[1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:15.640]  the first digit of your pinky finger
[1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:17.640]  at least you get benefits I guess
[1:57:17.640 --> 1:57:19.640]  the Japanese mafia you know what it's part of
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:21.640]  I guess you got to be tough or whatever
[1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:23.640]  just have you join them
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:25.640]  this is a cult where you just are an idiot
[1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:29.640]  and the globalists have all their white papers
[1:57:29.640 --> 1:57:31.640]  and their documents and their admissions
[1:57:31.640 --> 1:57:33.640]  that I went over in the first hour
[1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:35.640]  and I just sit here going do people like
[1:57:35.640 --> 1:57:37.640]  to be dumbasses but yeah they do
[1:57:37.640 --> 1:57:39.640]  here's how it works
[1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:41.640]  I don't know what the term is
[1:57:41.640 --> 1:57:43.640]  and I always overuse the analogy of
[1:57:43.640 --> 1:57:45.640]  the
[1:57:45.640 --> 1:57:47.640]  Hollywood casino
[1:57:47.640 --> 1:57:49.640]  or you could use the analogy of the
[1:57:49.640 --> 1:57:51.640]  Nigerian email but everybody
[1:57:51.640 --> 1:57:53.640]  everybody knows why this has been scammed
[1:57:53.640 --> 1:57:55.640]  and once you get
[1:57:55.640 --> 1:57:57.640]  scammed once a lot of these scams go oh
[1:57:57.640 --> 1:57:59.640]  actually give us more money and
[1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:01.640]  you'll make out good
[1:58:01.640 --> 1:58:03.640]  and the people will never admit they've been
[1:58:03.640 --> 1:58:05.640]  gone and they keep giving more
[1:58:05.640 --> 1:58:07.640]  money to the scammer
[1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:11.640]  and that's how this works more
[1:58:11.640 --> 1:58:13.640]  liberty more freedom more because
[1:58:13.640 --> 1:58:15.640]  they don't want to admit they've been lied to
[1:58:15.640 --> 1:58:17.640]  I mean when I get scammed or screwed over
[1:58:17.640 --> 1:58:19.640]  I want to admit to it I want to see how it
[1:58:19.640 --> 1:58:21.640]  happened I don't want to do it again
[1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:23.640]  and I thought people were like me
[1:58:23.640 --> 1:58:25.640]  but a lot of folks
[1:58:25.640 --> 1:58:27.640]  are not like yours truly
[1:58:27.640 --> 1:58:29.640]  or Ali Alexander coming up they want to be
[1:58:29.640 --> 1:58:31.640]  scammed so with 81 days out from
[1:58:31.640 --> 1:58:33.640]  the election we're going to look at the election
[1:58:33.640 --> 1:58:35.640]  Ali Alexander he's a smart cookie
[1:58:35.640 --> 1:58:37.640]  works with a public party as a strategist
[1:58:37.640 --> 1:58:39.640]  we'll talk about all the things that are unfolding
[1:58:39.640 --> 1:58:41.640]  and so much more straight ahead
[1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:43.640]  and then
[1:58:43.640 --> 1:58:45.640]  that's coming up in the fourth hour
[1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:47.640]  and after that war room
[1:58:47.640 --> 1:58:49.640]  I'm cutting this ad on Wednesday
[1:58:49.640 --> 1:58:51.640]  August 12th, 2025
[1:58:51.640 --> 1:58:53.640]  this coming Sunday this huge sale
[1:58:53.640 --> 1:58:55.640]  we've been running for last week we'll have to
[1:58:55.640 --> 1:58:57.640]  end the reopened America back

[1:58:59.640 --> 1:59:01.640]  off to 60% off all
[1:59:01.640 --> 1:59:03.640]  of our top best sellers
[1:59:03.640 --> 1:59:05.640]  and double pay three
[1:59:05.640 --> 1:59:07.640]  at points I have to end the sale
[1:59:07.640 --> 1:59:09.640]  because we're selling out of bodies
[1:59:09.640 --> 1:59:11.640]  at 50% off living defense
[1:59:11.640 --> 1:59:13.640]  50% off turboforcing
[1:59:13.640 --> 1:59:15.640]  50% off environmental defense
[1:59:15.640 --> 1:59:17.640]  those are all very close to selling out
[1:59:17.640 --> 1:59:19.640]  a bunch of other best sellers we still have
[1:59:19.640 --> 1:59:21.640]  but I will end this special
[1:59:21.640 --> 1:59:23.640]  on Sunday we'll have a new
[1:59:23.640 --> 1:59:25.640]  great special coming up next week
[1:59:25.640 --> 1:59:27.640]  but it's not as extensive or
[1:59:27.640 --> 1:59:29.640]  expansive as X2
[1:59:29.640 --> 1:59:31.640]  the original we'll come back and stop
[1:59:31.640 --> 1:59:33.640]  it will be discounted but it's not available yet
[1:59:33.640 --> 1:59:35.640]  so this is a great sale it funds the operation
[1:59:35.640 --> 1:59:37.640]  they're great items in crazy times
[1:59:37.640 --> 1:59:39.640]  like this it's good to stock up
[1:59:39.640 --> 1:59:41.640]  what do you do keep spreading the word about

[2:00:15.640 --> 2:00:17.640]  here in defiance
[2:00:17.640 --> 2:00:19.640]  of the globalist tyranny
[2:00:19.640 --> 2:00:21.640]  here at your deference I'm very
[2:00:21.640 --> 2:00:23.640]  honored that you put us in
[2:00:23.640 --> 2:00:25.640]  attack formation
[2:00:25.640 --> 2:00:27.640]  I'm very glad you kept me at the
[2:00:27.640 --> 2:00:29.640]  front of the fight
[2:00:29.640 --> 2:00:31.640]  all I wish
[2:00:31.640 --> 2:00:33.640]  if you could keep me in this position
[2:00:33.640 --> 2:00:35.640]  I'm very honored that you put us
[2:00:35.640 --> 2:00:37.640]  in attack formation
[2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:39.640]  I'm very glad you kept me at the front
[2:00:39.640 --> 2:01:05.640]  of the fight
[2:01:05.640 --> 2:01:08.880]  He's been on many times with us, but it's been about a year or so when I welcome him
[2:01:08.880 --> 2:01:13.480]  back to the transmission with us, he's done the deep dive on Kamala Harris and why they
[2:01:13.480 --> 2:01:17.700]  really picked her and what he sees unfolding in the next 81 days.
[2:01:17.700 --> 2:01:19.320]  And so he joins us now, Ali.
[2:01:19.320 --> 2:01:20.320]  Thanks for coming on.
[2:01:20.320 --> 2:01:22.000]  Hey, it's been a while.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.360]  Thanks for having me back, Alex.
[2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:25.360]  Let's get into it.
[2:01:25.360 --> 2:01:28.960]  I mean, you got a lot of inside baseball with your connections in DC.
[2:01:28.960 --> 2:01:32.280]  What's the, what's the, what's the scoop people aren't aware of yet?
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:37.640]  Well, I think what they're not aware of is that Joe Biden didn't actually want Kamala
[2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:40.800]  Harris as Joe Biden pronounced it.
[2:01:40.800 --> 2:01:46.280]  It was actually Obama and some big donors like Soros who wanted to put Kamala on the
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:47.280]  ticket.
[2:01:47.280 --> 2:01:52.520]  And so, you know, he had to delay his decision and, and now she's on the ticket as president
[2:01:52.520 --> 2:01:53.960]  and waiting.
[2:01:53.960 --> 2:01:59.080]  And I think that she's going to do a lot of the bidding of kind of the global elite,
[2:01:59.080 --> 2:02:04.240]  the corporatist wing of the Democrat party, but I think that this presents the Trump team
[2:02:04.240 --> 2:02:09.520]  with a unique opportunity to actually address the progressive concerns and some of the concerns
[2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:13.600]  of occupy, you know, people that we don't traditionally agree with, but have some honest
[2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:18.080]  concerns about centralized power that, hey, this ticket isn't here to represent you.
[2:02:18.080 --> 2:02:19.560]  It's here to enslave you.
[2:02:19.560 --> 2:02:24.440]  Well, that was one of my points I scribbled down last night when you read the show is
[2:02:24.440 --> 2:02:29.960]  Tim Poole really liked him super entertaining, super smart, a progressive, actually respect
[2:02:29.960 --> 2:02:31.040]  who has integrity.
[2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:34.240]  He attacks me and says, I'm a wild man, but he supports my free speech.
[2:02:34.240 --> 2:02:36.520]  He kind of focuses in on what they pick out of context.
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:37.520]  That's fine.
[2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:38.520]  I want him to come on.
[2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:39.520]  I want to go on this show.
[2:02:39.520 --> 2:02:40.520]  He's super successful.
[2:02:40.520 --> 2:02:41.520]  I tuned in the other night.
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:42.520]  He just randomly, I saw it.
[2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:46.280]  He had like a hundred thousand live viewers at once, two million came onto the stream
[2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:47.280]  total.
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:48.280]  That's Joe Rogan type stuff.
[2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:49.280]  They're very exciting.
[2:02:49.280 --> 2:02:50.640]  And he was endorsing Trump.
[2:02:50.640 --> 2:02:53.080]  He said because he's real, he says what he really means.
[2:02:53.080 --> 2:02:54.240]  He tries to do it.
[2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:55.240]  They lie about him.
[2:02:55.240 --> 2:02:59.680]  I don't agree with a lot of the policies, but Kamala Harris is the last straw.
[2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:01.200]  Bernie Sanders took the dive.
[2:03:01.200 --> 2:03:02.520]  He's a fraud.
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:07.360]  And his co-host was in ecstasy and they basically put on red manga hats instead of the little
[2:03:07.360 --> 2:03:08.360]  customary black beanies.
[2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:12.960]  And so there's a real populist liberal movement that at some point has got to wake up out
[2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:18.000]  of their trance that the left are chai-com loving fascists from hell.
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.680]  I think that that's exactly what's going to happen.
[2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:23.600]  Kamala's a cop and she's a dirty cop.
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:24.840]  She's a bad cop.
[2:03:24.840 --> 2:03:28.840]  She kept black men in prison longer than their sentences.
[2:03:28.840 --> 2:03:34.680]  She threatened to jail black moms for having a truant students.
[2:03:34.680 --> 2:03:40.120]  She came down on the side of the banks during the last financial crisis.
[2:03:40.120 --> 2:03:45.080]  This is a woman who is literally controlled by the global elite and Joe Biden is there
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:46.640]  to provide her cover.
[2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:50.600]  But what a terrific opportunity to actually go into the black community.
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:54.200]  This is the community that abandoned her during the Democrat primary.
[2:03:54.200 --> 2:04:00.040]  Remember she had to get out prior to Iowa because Andrew Yang some random Asian dude
[2:04:00.040 --> 2:04:04.640]  in California was polling higher than her in a state where she's a statewide elected
[2:04:04.640 --> 2:04:06.480]  official, you know, federally.
[2:04:06.480 --> 2:04:11.320]  And so I think this is a terrific opportunity to say, hey, Wall Street doesn't have your
[2:04:11.320 --> 2:04:12.320]  back.
[2:04:12.320 --> 2:04:14.240]  Hollywood doesn't have your back.
[2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:18.280]  She's best friends with Jeff Zuckler, the president of CNN.
[2:04:18.280 --> 2:04:22.880]  So this is a woman who is literally controlled by the global elite, the people who do not
[2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:27.320]  want borders, the people who want to vaccinate everyone, the people who don't believe that
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:33.200]  African Americans, descendant of slavery under Jim Crow are unique people that all black
[2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:34.200]  people are the same.
[2:04:34.200 --> 2:04:36.240]  All Hispanics are the same.
[2:04:36.240 --> 2:04:38.000]  And they just want to control everybody.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:41.080]  And so I think that this is, I'm glad that he put her on the ticket.
[2:04:41.080 --> 2:04:43.720]  What a weak pick from slow Joe.
[2:04:43.720 --> 2:04:48.160]  Well, I agree with you that she's the most establishment soulless candidate.
[2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:49.160]  You've probably ever seen.
[2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:51.160]  I mean, Joe's probably number two.
[2:04:51.160 --> 2:04:54.760]  So why does Soros and Jeff Bezos and others want her?
[2:04:54.760 --> 2:04:58.320]  I guess she'll do whatever they say or exactly right.
[2:04:58.320 --> 2:05:02.560]  You know, I, you know, you and I are both religious people, spiritual people, we believe
[2:05:02.560 --> 2:05:03.560]  in Jesus.
[2:05:03.560 --> 2:05:08.360]  When I read the Bible and I read about these mysteries, one thing that I observe is there
[2:05:08.360 --> 2:05:15.480]  seem to be anchored points in time in which God has chosen to reveal some great secret,
[2:05:15.480 --> 2:05:16.480]  right?
[2:05:16.480 --> 2:05:20.880]  I always say that, hey, when you're ahead of the curve, like you and I are, you can
[2:05:20.880 --> 2:05:25.360]  look at a mystery and your eyes are kind of averted from it.
[2:05:25.360 --> 2:05:31.120]  And when you look at Kamala, your instincts are to try to reconcile it in kind of a Hegelian
[2:05:31.120 --> 2:05:32.120]  sense.
[2:05:32.120 --> 2:05:36.320]  You want to say, well, the left hater and the right hater, what am I wrong about?
[2:05:36.320 --> 2:05:42.000]  But the truth is the left hater and the right hater, she is an authoritarian.
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:43.560]  She is a sellout.
[2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:49.600]  I think that the team, Trump is making a tremendous mistake as painting her as radical left.
[2:05:49.600 --> 2:05:51.520]  She is soulless.
[2:05:51.520 --> 2:05:59.200]  She will do whatever the DNC donors want, whatever Wall Street wants, whatever Hollywood
[2:05:59.200 --> 2:06:02.640]  executives want, whatever the EU wants.
[2:06:02.640 --> 2:06:04.480]  She is a soulless candidate.
[2:06:04.480 --> 2:06:08.160]  She is an anti-black candidate and she's ridiculously fake.
[2:06:08.160 --> 2:06:12.080]  I mean, she was polling what during most of the primaries at one percent, but the system
[2:06:12.080 --> 2:06:14.560]  wanted her and now they're going to try to force feed her.
[2:06:14.560 --> 2:06:18.800]  So you're saying this can be like the Bible says God turns the elites over to delusion.
[2:06:18.800 --> 2:06:20.760]  Are you saying this is their delusion?
[2:06:20.760 --> 2:06:22.160]  Absolutely.
[2:06:22.160 --> 2:06:27.200]  This is going to be fantastic because the media has already painted, you know, Politico,
[2:06:27.200 --> 2:06:31.760]  New York Times, even the Wall Street Journalist said, hey, progressives are excited about
[2:06:31.760 --> 2:06:33.160]  Kamala Harris.
[2:06:33.160 --> 2:06:36.640]  You go on YouTube, you go on Instagram, you go on TikTok.
[2:06:36.640 --> 2:06:39.040]  That is not the story of progressives.
[2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:42.080]  Look at it, make Tim Poole put on a Trump hat.
[2:06:42.080 --> 2:06:45.000]  I mean, that's a canary in the coal mine.
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  It really is.
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:50.800]  And there's these other people, you know, Jimmy Doar or whatever, I don't watch him.
[2:06:50.800 --> 2:06:52.320]  There's Tim Black.
[2:06:52.320 --> 2:06:53.880]  There's all these TikTokers.
[2:06:53.880 --> 2:06:55.760]  There's the Black Instagram community.
[2:06:55.760 --> 2:07:00.480]  You go to the original sources, the primary sources, and this is a ticket that might actually
[2:07:00.480 --> 2:07:01.480]  collapse.
[2:07:01.480 --> 2:07:08.000]  You might actually see Donald Trump capable of getting 370 electoral votes or 400 electoral
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:09.720]  votes if he runs right.
[2:07:09.720 --> 2:07:13.920]  If he leans into America first, if he talks about deep platforming, if he comes in the
[2:07:13.920 --> 2:07:18.960]  Black community and says, let's start negotiating with your community and what do you guys need?
[2:07:18.960 --> 2:07:19.960]  Then I think that the Biden-
[2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:24.160]  Well, if Trump cuts out all the leftist managers of the Blacks, because everybody's managed
[2:07:24.160 --> 2:07:27.440]  by the local capos, the Democratic Party runs awesome.
[2:07:27.440 --> 2:07:29.560]  I live out of their crap, even though I hate their guts.
[2:07:29.560 --> 2:07:34.040]  But if Trump opens a negotiation directly up with the inner city and poor people, period,
[2:07:34.040 --> 2:07:35.040]  they want that.
[2:07:35.040 --> 2:07:38.280]  It would absolutely cut out the poverty-pimp metalman.
[2:07:38.280 --> 2:07:39.280]  Absolutely.
[2:07:39.280 --> 2:07:43.840]  And here's another little antidote that we all need to watch.
[2:07:43.840 --> 2:07:46.000]  You have Kanye West running.
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:49.360]  You have Ice Cube saying that he doesn't want to vote for the Democrats.
[2:07:49.360 --> 2:07:52.800]  You have P. Diddy saying that he doesn't want to vote unless he can negotiate something
[2:07:52.800 --> 2:07:54.040]  for the Black community.
[2:07:54.040 --> 2:07:57.400]  The Black community is begging to be independent for the first time.
[2:07:57.400 --> 2:08:00.500]  And I get that Republicans and conservatives are skeptical.
[2:08:00.500 --> 2:08:05.280]  They think, oh, we can't do any outreach with the Black community, but never before has
[2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:08.960]  anyone done any honest, honest, and earnest outreach.
[2:08:08.960 --> 2:08:09.960]  So forget outreach.
[2:08:09.960 --> 2:08:10.960]  Let's talk about it.
[2:08:10.960 --> 2:08:13.800]  When I put out on my show, Black folks love me without me ever even courting them.
[2:08:13.800 --> 2:08:14.800]  They just love the show.
[2:08:14.800 --> 2:08:18.880]  They love you because Alex, you're authentic, and that's all they want to know is that you're
[2:08:18.880 --> 2:08:20.600]  not hiding anything from them.
[2:08:20.600 --> 2:08:24.960]  So let's forget BLM and let's talk about, instead of Black Lives Matter, which isn't
[2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:29.840]  about lives at all, let's talk about Black equity, Black assets, Black land.
[2:08:29.840 --> 2:08:31.280]  Let's talk about Black participation.
[2:08:31.280 --> 2:08:32.280]  Exactly.
[2:08:32.280 --> 2:08:33.280]  You don't want a one-time paycheck.
[2:08:33.280 --> 2:08:34.280]  You want equity.
[2:08:34.280 --> 2:08:35.280]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:08:35.280 --> 2:08:36.780]  That's what I want.
[2:08:36.780 --> 2:08:38.720]  And that binds us all together, right?
[2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:42.040]  You know, we're not worshiping the free market, but we're all engaged in the marketplace
[2:08:42.040 --> 2:08:44.880]  of ideas and the marketplace of commerce.
[2:08:44.880 --> 2:08:47.440]  And that's what the Democrats don't want.
[2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:49.080]  Everybody needs chips in the game.
[2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:50.440]  Everybody needs chips to play.
[2:08:50.440 --> 2:08:53.800]  And as you point out, you know, the Black community is so used to, okay, there's all
[2:08:53.800 --> 2:08:54.800]  this funding.
[2:08:54.800 --> 2:08:55.800]  Where is it going?
[2:08:55.800 --> 2:08:57.240]  And you point out, it's the middle managers.
[2:08:57.240 --> 2:08:58.360]  It's the alderman.
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:08:59.360]  It's the NAACP.
[2:08:59.360 --> 2:09:03.640]  It's the, it's the Black preacher who doesn't even, you know, may not believe in Christ.
[2:09:03.640 --> 2:09:06.120]  And all of these grifters are just grifting.
[2:09:06.120 --> 2:09:09.360]  The Black community is like, is there any party that will take us seriously?
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:12.520]  And so I think that the team Trump needs to be aggressively talking.
[2:09:12.520 --> 2:09:13.520]  I agree.
[2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:15.680]  What did it do in the Black community when Trump basically doubled funding the Black
[2:09:15.680 --> 2:09:16.680]  colleges?
[2:09:16.680 --> 2:09:18.480]  Does that even faze anybody?
[2:09:18.480 --> 2:09:21.480]  I think, I think that it created less opposition.
[2:09:21.480 --> 2:09:25.360]  So it may not have created more voters, but it created less opposition.
[2:09:25.360 --> 2:09:29.240]  And the way that I look at elections, don't look at it as a minus one and a plus one.
[2:09:29.240 --> 2:09:30.960]  There's a zero in between.
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:36.200]  So Black voters that decide to vote for Kanye or Black voters that say, hey, I don't like
[2:09:36.200 --> 2:09:37.760]  Trump and I don't like Biden.
[2:09:37.760 --> 2:09:39.760]  I'm going to choose not to vote in that election.
[2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:40.760]  I'll vote down ballot.
[2:09:40.760 --> 2:09:41.760]  That's the win as well.
[2:09:41.760 --> 2:09:42.760]  Stay there.
[2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:43.760]  Ali Alexander, political analyst.
[2:09:43.760 --> 2:09:44.760]  Stay with us.
[2:09:44.760 --> 2:09:51.360]  Nancy Pelosi, Eric Holder, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and the list goes on from there have
[2:09:51.360 --> 2:09:55.560]  all gone on national TV and have all gone on the internet and have been in the pages
[2:09:55.560 --> 2:10:01.120]  of the New York Times that they're wargaming, contesting the election when they lose.
[2:10:01.120 --> 2:10:04.760]  They know there's a landslide, that they're unable to steal it.
[2:10:04.760 --> 2:10:10.520]  They're planning to contest it and have Democrat blue states secede and hold their own treasonous
[2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:14.200]  inauguration for Joe Biden and the other public, Kamala Harris.
[2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:19.640]  This has now been announced and they're going to use race war and rioting as the cover to
[2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:21.800]  try to drive Trump from office.
[2:10:21.800 --> 2:10:26.360]  The Democratic Party, the chai comms, the deep state are using Black Lives Matter funded
[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:32.440]  by Soros as their cover to claim that if you resist their attempts at creating artificial
[2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:37.960]  riots and martial law, that you're racist when in truth, an old Nazi collaborator, George
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:41.320]  Soros, created Black Lives Matter along with Antifa.
[2:10:41.320 --> 2:10:44.320]  America's fighting for its life, but we will win.
[2:10:44.320 --> 2:10:49.840]  Well, we're six months into the COVID-19 lockdown and now Democrat leaders are calling for people
[2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:54.200]  to be charged with attempted murder if they don't wear the mask of the symbols of slavery.
[2:10:54.200 --> 2:10:59.000]  And they've triggered their race riots around the country led by white, angry liberal academics
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  and others.
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:03.800]  And now on top of the Democrats are officially saying, hey, Trump's going to try to steal
[2:11:03.800 --> 2:11:08.040]  the election and contest it, but then their internal wargaming documents come out with
[2:11:08.040 --> 2:11:12.400]  John Podesta at the very top with Kamala Harris and of course, Joe Biden.
[2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:16.240]  And they're saying, oh, we think we're going to lose, but we're going to have the Democrat
[2:11:16.240 --> 2:11:21.080]  state secede claiming that Joe Biden's won the popular vote and we are then going to
[2:11:21.080 --> 2:11:24.160]  set up our own country and ask the military to remove Trump.
[2:11:24.160 --> 2:11:26.160]  This is officially in the New York Times.
[2:11:26.160 --> 2:11:27.880]  I don't just believe the New York Times.
[2:11:27.880 --> 2:11:31.360]  I've been telling you for over a year, this is their plan from other statements they've
[2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:36.280]  made and then Atlantic Monthly, the Washington Post, the Financial Times of London, the Council
[2:11:36.280 --> 2:11:37.280]  on Farm Relations.
[2:11:37.280 --> 2:11:38.280]  This is their plan.
[2:11:38.280 --> 2:11:40.080]  We've got 80 days left to stop it.
[2:11:40.080 --> 2:11:41.080]  What are you going to do?
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:42.080]  I'm serious, folks.
[2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:49.080]  This is the time to save the country.
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:23.080]  So globalism has been in trouble for a long time.
[2:12:23.080 --> 2:12:27.040]  It's an authoritarian corporate fascist model working with communists and others around
[2:12:27.040 --> 2:12:32.080]  the planet, doesn't like nation states, doesn't like independent cultures, wants homogenized
[2:12:32.080 --> 2:12:34.200]  corporate control systems.
[2:12:34.200 --> 2:12:38.880]  And they said in the Rockefeller Foundation event 201 lockstep, you name it, that they
[2:12:38.880 --> 2:12:42.760]  would use the panic over a virus to bring in authoritarian control.
[2:12:42.760 --> 2:12:45.000]  We covered that in the first hour.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:49.880]  So Ali Alexander is a very smart political analyst and he does a great job working with
[2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:50.880]  the White House of their people.
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:56.520]  And I agree with him on the surface, Kamala Harris looks absolutely terrible and she's
[2:12:56.520 --> 2:13:00.200]  hated by the left, but she's loved by the establishment because they want a yes person
[2:13:00.200 --> 2:13:01.200]  in there.
[2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:04.920]  And CNN's already reported that Biden's the placeholder for her.
[2:13:04.920 --> 2:13:12.960]  So it is President Kamala Harris and we'll go over some of the terrible background with
[2:13:12.960 --> 2:13:13.960]  her.
[2:13:13.960 --> 2:13:16.880]  But what about the issue of Pelosi and all of them wargaming?
[2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:21.080]  We're going to have blue state secede, we're going to say popular vote.
[2:13:21.080 --> 2:13:23.400]  We're going to have our own inauguration.
[2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:26.160]  They've said all this and John Podesta's had wargames.
[2:13:26.160 --> 2:13:30.640]  They're really pushing this as the talking point of their next hoax.
[2:13:30.640 --> 2:13:32.280]  Probably a long shot should fail.
[2:13:32.280 --> 2:13:37.760]  But this one is such a bigger crisis, it'll hurt the economy, they'll try to activate their
[2:13:37.760 --> 2:13:39.280]  fake race riots.
[2:13:39.280 --> 2:13:42.920]  From you talking to your DC connections and your own research, what do you think of that
[2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:43.920]  move?
[2:13:43.920 --> 2:13:47.080]  And they picked her because she's a little bit African.
[2:13:47.080 --> 2:13:49.960]  And so they can, so she can play into the whole race narrative.
[2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:54.800]  The Democrats want to smoke screen their attempted overthrow of the election and Trump as a race
[2:13:54.800 --> 2:13:55.800]  riot.
[2:13:55.800 --> 2:14:00.400]  Yeah, they need this to be close enough to cheat.
[2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:07.440]  And I've described this as truly, truly an event that you couldn't picture it really
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:09.160]  before this year.
[2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:13.600]  We all watched in 2000 with Bush v. Gore.
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:21.240]  But imagine, if you will, 10 states having their own Bush v. Gore crisis in different
[2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:27.240]  federal courts around the country and the Supreme Court can't take it all up and consolidate
[2:14:27.240 --> 2:14:32.000]  the cases because each state has its own election laws.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:38.800]  So this is an event that if one side doesn't win by a lot, you're not looking at electors
[2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:44.160]  who are able to cast votes in December when they are constitutionally obligated to.
[2:14:44.160 --> 2:14:49.720]  We could be looking at a, I hate to say this, Alex, but we could be looking at a temporary
[2:14:49.720 --> 2:14:54.640]  president Pelosi in January because we won't have a president.
[2:14:54.640 --> 2:15:01.720]  And so if we go through the Podesta war game, which is to find two or three states of the
[2:15:01.720 --> 2:15:07.440]  10 that are being contested in which the governors can disrupt the electoral process and not send
[2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:13.600]  electors or send unfaithful electors to the electoral college or not have it at all, then
[2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:19.600]  we don't have an election that is decided by the people or by the electoral college.
[2:15:19.600 --> 2:15:26.520]  And that is a constitutional crisis that has not been predicted or forecasted until John
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:30.520]  Podesta and his scheming ways thought of it.
[2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:35.720]  So we ought to be really nervous and that's why I'm so passionate that team Trump needs
[2:15:35.720 --> 2:15:41.840]  to collapse the ticket on the other side, tell the progressives and tell the left the
[2:15:41.840 --> 2:15:47.880]  truth about these authoritarian mass incarceration war on drug bigots.
[2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:53.240]  These corporatists on the left, and we need the right and the left to come together behind
[2:15:53.240 --> 2:16:01.520]  either a president Kanye West or a president Donald Trump, Alexander I won infinity trillion
[2:16:01.520 --> 2:16:04.040]  infinity agree with you.
[2:16:04.040 --> 2:16:07.560]  That's the answer because Trump can't be confident and go, Oh, Kamala's hated.
[2:16:07.560 --> 2:16:08.560]  They're a joke.
[2:16:08.560 --> 2:16:09.560]  I'm going to win.
[2:16:09.560 --> 2:16:13.040]  No, they admit the strategy is contesting it tying up the states and then having the
[2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:17.680]  military decide what to do, which is a criminal act of these should head on expose that and
[2:16:17.680 --> 2:16:23.440]  head on destroy Kamala and destroy Biden and just annihilate them.
[2:16:23.440 --> 2:16:25.680]  Don't take it as their weak candidates.
[2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:27.200]  That's the sucker puncher.
[2:16:27.200 --> 2:16:28.440]  Absolutely right.
[2:16:28.440 --> 2:16:30.000]  So this is what I think about.
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:36.680]  I think about and then, you know, maybe it needs to be an info wars special or reward
[2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:39.720]  game freedom, but think about what that would present.
[2:16:39.720 --> 2:16:41.320]  The dollar would crash.
[2:16:41.320 --> 2:16:43.120]  The dollar would crash.
[2:16:43.120 --> 2:16:44.800]  China is ready for the dollar to crash.
[2:16:44.800 --> 2:16:49.160]  They've already been buying for the past year and a half oil in their native currency,
[2:16:49.160 --> 2:16:52.080]  and they're willing to buy it because you're on fire.
[2:16:52.080 --> 2:16:54.880]  Soros is betting against the dollar against the market.
[2:16:54.880 --> 2:16:55.880]  We're in a bubble war.
[2:16:55.880 --> 2:16:57.160]  China has a much bigger bubble.
[2:16:57.160 --> 2:16:58.280]  So does the EU.
[2:16:58.280 --> 2:17:04.840]  But all our media is saying America's done when Americans see mainline in SNBC CNBC, New
[2:17:04.840 --> 2:17:07.120]  York Times saying America's done.
[2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:09.960]  They're trying to destroy your 401ks.
[2:17:09.960 --> 2:17:11.120]  Trump's winning.
[2:17:11.120 --> 2:17:12.520]  Come in support Trump.
[2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:15.800]  The republic will survive, will stabilize the global currency.
[2:17:15.800 --> 2:17:19.240]  But if we fail, it's total war on the streets collapse.
[2:17:19.240 --> 2:17:20.840]  This is insane.
[2:17:20.840 --> 2:17:22.080]  Total collapse.
[2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:26.800]  Ask yourself why did China move to a digital currency during the panic?
[2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:30.520]  Why is China brokering its own deal with Venezuela?
[2:17:30.520 --> 2:17:34.560]  Why is China buying Middle East oil in its native currency?
[2:17:34.560 --> 2:17:37.080]  We are already at war with China.
[2:17:37.080 --> 2:17:41.160]  China wants the collapse of the United States and people are going to think, oh, I'm on
[2:17:41.160 --> 2:17:42.160]  Robin Hood.
[2:17:42.160 --> 2:17:43.600]  Oh, I'm buying cheap shares.
[2:17:43.600 --> 2:17:46.080]  Oh, my God, stocks go up, stocks go up.
[2:17:46.080 --> 2:17:52.360]  When you wake up one day and the dollar is devalued by 75%, you're going to go into
[2:17:52.360 --> 2:17:53.360]  a panic.
[2:17:53.360 --> 2:17:58.600]  And so I tell people, like, you really don't know how bad this is about to be if Soros
[2:17:58.600 --> 2:18:00.440]  and Podesta get their way.
[2:18:00.440 --> 2:18:04.320]  They just need the election to be close enough to create chaos.
[2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:06.880]  They don't even have to win, Alex.
[2:18:06.880 --> 2:18:10.080]  Ali, what you're saying is not your opinion.
[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:11.320]  It's what's happening.
[2:18:11.320 --> 2:18:12.840]  It's the real battle space.
[2:18:12.840 --> 2:18:16.760]  And then I looked at anti-fun leftists and they're praising the fall of the country and
[2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:17.760]  they don't get it.
[2:18:17.760 --> 2:18:18.760]  That happens.
[2:18:18.760 --> 2:18:19.960]  Their lives are over as they know it.
[2:18:19.960 --> 2:18:22.080]  These are idiots.
[2:18:22.080 --> 2:18:23.360]  These are complete idiots.
[2:18:23.360 --> 2:18:24.680]  They need to understand this.
[2:18:24.680 --> 2:18:28.400]  And I don't want to dive too deep because people's heads will explode.
[2:18:28.400 --> 2:18:33.120]  But what people need to understand about the French Revolution is that Karl Marx then went
[2:18:33.120 --> 2:18:36.800]  to France and studied in the Paris commune.
[2:18:36.800 --> 2:18:42.120]  So when we were looking at Chas and Chopp in Seattle, I predicted everything that was
[2:18:42.120 --> 2:18:47.000]  going to happen weeks ahead of time because I had studied what was called the Paris commune.
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:52.920]  And when you understand that they move gold before they start these little socialist Marxist
[2:18:52.920 --> 2:18:58.920]  experiment, and when you understand that Karl Marx was in France beta testing what needed
[2:18:58.920 --> 2:19:03.360]  to happen in Russia, you will understand that this is a cyclical problem that we have and
[2:19:03.360 --> 2:19:06.600]  it's as spiritual as it is political.
[2:19:06.600 --> 2:19:11.320]  And when you understand that the Marxists, you have to read Marx to understand, look,
[2:19:11.320 --> 2:19:16.000]  it's a Republican conservative talking point that socialism leads to communism.
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:17.640]  But you need to read Marx.
[2:19:17.640 --> 2:19:22.400]  Marx promises that communism can lead to a more perfect socialism.
[2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:25.880]  And so you have to understand Marxism is inherently a lie to everyone.
[2:19:25.880 --> 2:19:31.080]  It says no God, we can be better socialists, no individual, and what they're doing is they're
[2:19:31.080 --> 2:19:37.800]  suckering everybody into a permanent method of chaos, destruction, hell, violence, a
[2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:42.680]  giant black hole to consolidate power, and they always build a Napoleonic or Hitlerian
[2:19:42.680 --> 2:19:48.160]  tyranny on top of the collapse, always, always, always.
[2:19:48.160 --> 2:19:53.640]  So what our fight in November is literally to stave off the collapse of the United States
[2:19:53.640 --> 2:19:55.880]  and and that's not a conspiracy.
[2:19:55.880 --> 2:19:56.880]  That is what is happening.
[2:19:56.880 --> 2:20:01.760]  Oh, they admit that's the game plan, and I just I understand Trump doesn't want to
[2:20:01.760 --> 2:20:02.760]  look authoritarian.
[2:20:02.760 --> 2:20:05.320]  I mean, they're acting like if he sends anybody to protect federal courthouses, he's bad.
[2:20:05.320 --> 2:20:10.760]  But at a certain point, you can't stand down if they try this during the general election.
[2:20:10.760 --> 2:20:14.080]  Yeah, Lauren, law and order tweets don't work.
[2:20:14.080 --> 2:20:20.120]  What work is putting down the riots that are attracting other violent opportunists to them.
[2:20:20.120 --> 2:20:21.400]  And that's what I told the White House.
[2:20:21.400 --> 2:20:25.920]  I said, look, normally I'm all for optics and and Alex, you know that about me is like
[2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:26.920]  even appearing with you.
[2:20:26.920 --> 2:20:27.920]  I make it cancel.
[2:20:27.920 --> 2:20:28.920]  I'm the last.
[2:20:28.920 --> 2:20:29.920]  No, you're right.
[2:20:29.920 --> 2:20:30.920]  Ali stay there.
[2:20:30.920 --> 2:20:31.920]  You got a lot of courage.
[2:20:31.920 --> 2:20:33.520]  Ali Alexander's Twitter at ALI will be right back.
[2:20:33.520 --> 2:20:37.280]  He's going to lay out the big stuff right now, but America's facing its greatest threat
[2:20:37.280 --> 2:20:38.280]  since its inception.
[2:20:38.280 --> 2:20:43.280]  Stay with us.
[2:20:43.280 --> 2:20:49.720]  You hear that?
[2:20:49.720 --> 2:20:55.680]  That's the March of the United Nations and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation coming
[2:20:55.680 --> 2:21:01.960]  with their battle plan, psychological warfare operation with the forced inoculations and
[2:21:01.960 --> 2:21:05.840]  the permanent lockdown of civilization and society.
[2:21:05.840 --> 2:21:09.400]  They're outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu.
[2:21:09.400 --> 2:21:12.520]  They're creating artificial phobias for normal death that takes place.
[2:21:12.520 --> 2:21:15.200]  They're not even promising to have a cure to it all.
[2:21:15.200 --> 2:21:20.440]  They're just inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary regime directed
[2:21:20.440 --> 2:21:29.120]  by the WHO with vaccines that actually change your DNA and make you owned by Microsoft.
[2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:31.480]  It's a final frontier.
[2:21:31.480 --> 2:21:34.160]  It's the year 2020.
[2:21:34.160 --> 2:21:36.280]  It's not coming.
[2:21:36.280 --> 2:21:42.880]  It's here and submission is blood in the water.
[2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:48.560]  The United Nations and the National Institutes of Health with the CDC are publicly conducting
[2:21:48.560 --> 2:21:55.960]  a 4,000-person study spending tens of millions of dollars at Yale on 15 ways to brainwash
[2:21:55.960 --> 2:22:01.200]  the public into taking inoculations, basically squeezing you and forcing you to take them
[2:22:01.200 --> 2:22:05.600]  through guilt, through fines, through not being able to go into stores, not being able to
[2:22:05.600 --> 2:22:07.480]  get on airplanes or have jobs.
[2:22:07.480 --> 2:22:10.000]  This is forced inoculations.
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  It's public.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:12.920]  Gateway Pundit wrote about it last week.
[2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:15.120]  David Knight wrote about it this week.
[2:22:15.120 --> 2:22:16.120]  Stories up on infowars.com.
[2:22:16.120 --> 2:22:19.560]  So people say, oh, I'll just wear a mask.
[2:22:19.560 --> 2:22:21.200]  It's never going to end.
[2:22:21.200 --> 2:22:23.200]  That's just the sign of submission.
[2:22:23.200 --> 2:22:29.440]  Fauci admits that next is the contact tracing of the apps on your phones and the inoculations
[2:22:29.440 --> 2:22:32.960]  that is a DNA vaccine that changes your DNA.
[2:22:32.960 --> 2:22:34.840]  This isn't a science fiction movie.
[2:22:34.840 --> 2:22:37.320]  It's happening right now.
[2:22:37.320 --> 2:22:38.840]  Compliance is death.
[2:22:38.840 --> 2:22:39.840]  Compliance is annihilation.
[2:22:39.840 --> 2:22:40.840]  Wake up.
[2:22:40.840 --> 2:22:41.840]  Wake up.
[2:22:41.840 --> 2:22:49.560]  Can you hear that?
[2:22:49.560 --> 2:22:55.520]  That's the march of the United Nations and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation coming
[2:22:55.520 --> 2:23:01.760]  with their battle plan, psychological warfare operation with the forced inoculations and
[2:23:01.760 --> 2:23:05.680]  the permanent lockdown of civilization and society.
[2:23:05.680 --> 2:23:09.200]  They're outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu.
[2:23:09.200 --> 2:23:12.320]  They're creating artificial phobias for normal death that takes place.
[2:23:12.320 --> 2:23:15.000]  They're not even promising to have a cure to it all.
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:20.240]  They're just inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary regime directed
[2:23:20.240 --> 2:23:28.920]  by the WHO with vaccines that actually change your DNA and make you owned by Microsoft.
[2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:31.280]  It's a final frontier.
[2:23:31.280 --> 2:23:33.960]  It's the year 2020.
[2:23:33.960 --> 2:23:36.080]  It's not coming.
[2:23:36.080 --> 2:23:37.080]  It's here.
[2:23:37.080 --> 2:23:45.760]  And submission is blood in the water.
[2:23:45.760 --> 2:24:02.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:02.800 --> 2:24:06.120]  The police are a reflection of us.
[2:24:06.120 --> 2:24:11.240]  We're under state law, under municipal law.
[2:24:11.240 --> 2:24:12.240]  Most are good.
[2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:13.240]  Some are bad.
[2:24:13.240 --> 2:24:17.240]  And we hold their feet for the fire.
[2:24:17.240 --> 2:24:24.240]  But in the official city of Austin budget, they call for demolishing the police department
[2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:28.720]  and breaking it up under other departments of the city and making other departments the
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:31.320]  police.
[2:24:31.320 --> 2:24:35.800]  And you have George Soros getting the new county attorney elected city attorney who
[2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:38.200]  says he wants to abolish the police.
[2:24:38.200 --> 2:24:45.160]  Well, here's the Hill reporting right now 150 million Austin city council approves cuts
[2:24:45.160 --> 2:24:46.920]  to police department.
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:47.920]  And guess what?
[2:24:47.920 --> 2:24:51.240]  It's going to go to their code enforcement and their SJWs to make sure you're locked
[2:24:51.240 --> 2:24:52.440]  in your houses.
[2:24:52.440 --> 2:24:58.160]  They're creating a large new bureaucratic force that will call the police but on you for political
[2:24:58.160 --> 2:25:02.280]  actions, not for muggings or killings.
[2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:07.920]  The answer to this is what's on m4wars.com, Atlanta DA who charged cop with murder loses
[2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:08.920]  reelection.
[2:25:08.920 --> 2:25:12.000]  Hey, I think the cop shouldn't have done what he did.
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:13.520]  He was getting beat up.
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:16.280]  The guy was shooting his don'ta's at him.
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:18.000]  The cop got scared and shot the guy.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:20.080]  But maybe he loses his job.
[2:25:20.080 --> 2:25:23.920]  The point is he didn't want to go kill the guy that night.
[2:25:23.920 --> 2:25:27.040]  And look, when a cop kills somebody, it's the biggest thing in the world.
[2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:30.200]  But when citizens kill each other, it's not even an issue.
[2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:31.720]  Very, very serious situation.
[2:25:31.720 --> 2:25:36.440]  This is the system coming in not to abolish the police but to cut their funding to make
[2:25:36.440 --> 2:25:40.200]  them politically come under globalist control.
[2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:45.000]  And so they couldn't have the Justice Department get control of police under Obama and under
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:46.100]  the Clintons.
[2:25:46.100 --> 2:25:50.440]  So now they're just having the UN and the bureaucracies do it through the city councils.
[2:25:50.440 --> 2:25:53.080]  It's called Munialization.
[2:25:53.080 --> 2:25:58.160]  And if I know about Munialization and the Strong Cities Initiative, then Trump and the
[2:25:58.160 --> 2:26:03.000]  Justice Department should, or are they amateurs, Ali Alexander talks to the White House all
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  the time.
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.320]  He's a high-level political analyst, really smart guy.
[2:26:06.320 --> 2:26:09.320]  He's on Twitter at ALI, at Ali.
[2:26:09.320 --> 2:26:13.040]  Ali, we were getting into their plan to scuttle the election.
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:14.040]  They know they're losing.
[2:26:14.040 --> 2:26:15.560]  There's not a giant landslide.
[2:26:15.560 --> 2:26:16.920]  They're going to try it.
[2:26:16.920 --> 2:26:19.160]  They're going to say if they have the popular vote, they've already said they're going to
[2:26:19.160 --> 2:26:20.400]  break away.
[2:26:20.400 --> 2:26:24.840]  Once we saw Podesta admit that in the New York Times, we understood why they were saying
[2:26:24.840 --> 2:26:28.280]  Trump's going to try to stay if he contests that he's a dictator.
[2:26:28.280 --> 2:26:31.160]  They're going to contest unless they win.
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:32.480]  That's clear.
[2:26:32.480 --> 2:26:38.720]  And so looking at this and the blueprint for overthrowing government, if the feds protect
[2:26:38.720 --> 2:26:40.360]  federal property, they're bad.
[2:26:40.360 --> 2:26:43.640]  I mean, this is a real communist takeover witnessing.
[2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:48.640]  Your analysis of that, and what do you think the White House and we the people should do?
[2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:52.160]  I think that we have to have a physical presence out there.
[2:26:52.160 --> 2:27:00.240]  I think that men should be in eight hour shifts outside of their churches in three rotations.
[2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:09.200]  I think that our physical, peaceful presence is chilling enough to the central planners
[2:27:09.200 --> 2:27:13.280]  that they will delay their plans by 50 or 100 years.
[2:27:13.280 --> 2:27:19.160]  The Bible writes that we will lose many battles and that God wins in the end.
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:22.160]  And so I think that we can ask for God's intercession.
[2:27:22.160 --> 2:27:27.840]  I think that if we faithfully show up and show that physical presence that we are the
[2:27:27.840 --> 2:27:33.040]  actual majority of peaceful people, Democrats and Republicans, mind you, that don't want
[2:27:33.040 --> 2:27:39.200]  a bigger government, that don't want to, quote, defund the police only to create five new
[2:27:39.200 --> 2:27:45.600]  police, five new badges and five new people who can detain you.
[2:27:45.600 --> 2:27:47.240]  That's their secret plan, as you point out.
[2:27:47.240 --> 2:27:51.920]  And we've watched this again and again in other countries, again and again over centuries.
[2:27:51.920 --> 2:27:56.920]  So what we need to do is I think that we need to have a physical presence in the physical
[2:27:56.920 --> 2:27:59.480]  space and stop making this digital.
[2:27:59.480 --> 2:28:01.520]  We all need to show up at our churches.
[2:28:01.520 --> 2:28:06.240]  We need to defend our homes and we need to demand that Republican governors stop governing
[2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:08.240]  by executive fiat without the state.
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:13.880]  And you just said it when 25 to 40,000 people shut up in Virginia, peacefully, black, white,
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:16.720]  Hispanic, old, young, no accidents, no arrests.
[2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:18.000]  Scared them.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:19.800]  They launched this whole thing then.
[2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:21.560]  And that's what scares them so much.
[2:28:21.560 --> 2:28:28.120]  And as you said, under 7277 and other memorandums, the left is wanted at the State Department.
[2:28:28.120 --> 2:28:33.360]  We get disarmed, but then the new peacekeeper force that's just a paramilitary comes in.
[2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:39.280]  And so as you said, Austin, you nailed it, is creating five new Albuquerque, four new
[2:28:39.280 --> 2:28:45.640]  LA, four new San Francisco, four new New York, three new paramilitary quasi-armed summer
[2:28:45.640 --> 2:28:49.080]  armed bureaucratic forces that they call social workers.
[2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:53.000]  No, they're SJWs with guns that have the police's back.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:58.040]  So they're taking the police money with at least some history of America, Bill of Rights,
[2:28:58.040 --> 2:29:02.000]  due process and transferring it to basically Antifa.
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:04.440]  Talk about a nightmare scenario.
[2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:05.440]  Nightmare scenario.
[2:29:05.440 --> 2:29:08.400]  And we need to somehow communicate this.
[2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:10.040]  The Republican Party can't.
[2:29:10.040 --> 2:29:12.080]  The conservative movement can't.
[2:29:12.080 --> 2:29:17.800]  The patriots and well-read thinkers can explain this to people.
[2:29:17.800 --> 2:29:24.160]  Look, let's say that your police department, like Broward County, a hundred or not a hundred,
[2:29:24.160 --> 2:29:29.960]  one billion dollars, if they defund that and turn that into a $500 million institution,
[2:29:29.960 --> 2:29:34.320]  what will happen is, yeah, they'll create three or four or five more departments.
[2:29:34.320 --> 2:29:36.120]  They'll all get fancy badges.
[2:29:36.120 --> 2:29:41.160]  They'll all have the ability to do extra judicial actions against you where they temporarily
[2:29:41.160 --> 2:29:42.160]  suspend your rights.
[2:29:42.160 --> 2:29:43.160]  Right?
[2:29:43.160 --> 2:29:44.160]  That's how we got the FISA court.
[2:29:44.160 --> 2:29:45.480]  Turn your power off.
[2:29:45.480 --> 2:29:47.680]  Turn your water off.
[2:29:47.680 --> 2:29:48.680]  Contact tracers.
[2:29:48.680 --> 2:29:49.680]  Take your kids.
[2:29:49.680 --> 2:29:53.600]  LA and Albuquerque, you already set it up?
[2:29:53.600 --> 2:29:57.000]  All without warrants, all without due process.
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:30:00.800]  And these people will be given a physical badge and they may not be given a gun, but
[2:30:00.800 --> 2:30:02.480]  they're given something worse.
[2:30:02.480 --> 2:30:06.560]  They're giving authoritarian control over your ability to engage in commerce, your ability
[2:30:06.560 --> 2:30:09.120]  to live, your ability to raise your child.
[2:30:09.120 --> 2:30:12.440]  And what will happen is, then you'll look at the total budget, Alex, and it'll be three
[2:30:12.440 --> 2:30:14.760]  billion dollars between all these institutions.
[2:30:14.760 --> 2:30:15.960]  So what did they do?
[2:30:15.960 --> 2:30:19.380]  They actually funded the police.
[2:30:19.380 --> 2:30:24.000]  And so we need to explain this to those leftists, these feral people, because they're being
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:25.440]  controlled by central planners.
[2:30:25.440 --> 2:30:30.040]  And that's why when we show up peacefully, the funding stops.
[2:30:30.040 --> 2:30:31.040]  No, I agree.
[2:30:31.040 --> 2:30:33.800]  So everybody, don't listen to what we're saying.
[2:30:33.800 --> 2:30:35.440]  Make a sign, randomly go out.
[2:30:35.440 --> 2:30:40.800]  And see citizens everywhere, not listening to the COVID lockdown, because they told nationalist,
[2:30:40.800 --> 2:30:44.600]  patriots, Christians, conservatives, you don't go out, leftists, you go out.
[2:30:44.600 --> 2:30:46.080]  No, we all go out.
[2:30:46.080 --> 2:30:49.800]  We all have our own independent message that will scare the living hell out of the left
[2:30:49.800 --> 2:30:51.840]  to seeing citizens on the streets.
[2:30:51.840 --> 2:30:57.360]  Yeah, because the camera, the camera is a propaganda tool and it's a medium that they
[2:30:57.360 --> 2:31:00.040]  know lends itself to automatic belief.
[2:31:00.040 --> 2:31:04.600]  And so when you see citizens engaging with other citizens, they know, well, it's time
[2:31:04.600 --> 2:31:06.400]  for this to stop.
[2:31:06.400 --> 2:31:08.560]  And you know, we saw that with Parkland.
[2:31:08.560 --> 2:31:11.680]  We've seen that with the BLM riots back in.
[2:31:11.680 --> 2:31:12.680]  That's right.
[2:31:12.680 --> 2:31:15.240]  We bring the cameras, they stop their propaganda.
[2:31:15.240 --> 2:31:19.200]  We just have to hit the streets and it'll go away like sunlight disinfects.
[2:31:19.200 --> 2:31:20.200]  Right.
[2:31:20.200 --> 2:31:21.720]  And we've seen that in St. Louis.
[2:31:21.720 --> 2:31:26.160]  What happens when Catholics pray in front of the statue of St. Louis?
[2:31:26.160 --> 2:31:27.920]  It's like people stop.
[2:31:27.920 --> 2:31:31.440]  And so there is, you know, our fight really is against principalities.
[2:31:31.440 --> 2:31:32.920]  It really is against principalities.
[2:31:32.920 --> 2:31:36.520]  You're right, we're not, because God's there, but we have to take the field.
[2:31:36.520 --> 2:31:40.280]  Then God gives us the power, but we have to make a step.
[2:31:40.280 --> 2:31:41.380]  It's an act of faith.
[2:31:41.380 --> 2:31:46.640]  It's an act to say they're violent and I will walk out there with the message of peace.
[2:31:46.640 --> 2:31:48.240]  And I will, I will leave it to God.
[2:31:48.240 --> 2:31:52.240]  It's like to use the Star Wars cheesy analogy Obi-Wan Kenobi tells Luke Skywalker when he
[2:31:52.240 --> 2:31:56.280]  first meets up a lifesaver, you've taken your first step into a bigger world.
[2:31:56.280 --> 2:31:58.640]  And that's what people need to take that first step.
[2:31:58.640 --> 2:32:01.000]  The first step is the biggest step.
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:02.160]  Right.
[2:32:02.160 --> 2:32:04.280]  And that's why they closed our churches, Alex.
[2:32:04.280 --> 2:32:08.160]  And that's why even Republican governors, I mean, I, you know, I don't want to shit
[2:32:08.160 --> 2:32:12.680]  on too much part of my French, but, but like Governor Abbott has gone from one of the most
[2:32:12.680 --> 2:32:17.120]  conservative governors in the country to a complete failure.
[2:32:17.120 --> 2:32:18.120]  I mean, just complete failure.
[2:32:18.120 --> 2:32:23.040]  Do you have any insight baseball and why he totally rolled over and became Gavin Newsom's
[2:32:23.040 --> 2:32:24.040]  boy?
[2:32:24.040 --> 2:32:30.200]  Oh, what I'll say is I put some tweets out there and, and I'm really close with, he's
[2:32:30.200 --> 2:32:34.240]  actually a form, I'm a former vendor of his when he was the attorney general and I love
[2:32:34.240 --> 2:32:37.960]  him and he follows me on Twitter and he runs his own Twitter account and I'm friends with,
[2:32:37.960 --> 2:32:41.800]  with some of his consultants and I expressed my dismay and they were like, well, read the
[2:32:41.800 --> 2:32:42.800]  executive order.
[2:32:42.800 --> 2:32:43.800]  Read the executive order.
[2:32:43.800 --> 2:32:49.840]  I said, look, if a church voluntarily shuts down because it can't cooperate with regulations,
[2:32:49.840 --> 2:32:53.600]  that's just as bad as you shutting it down or Newsom shutting down or Cuomo shutting
[2:32:53.600 --> 2:32:54.600]  it down.
[2:32:54.600 --> 2:32:58.920]  So we have a fundamental disagreement, but yeah, it's almost like something in, in Greg's
[2:32:58.920 --> 2:33:00.360]  personality changes.
[2:33:00.360 --> 2:33:01.360]  It's very bizarre.
[2:33:01.360 --> 2:33:02.600]  It's very concerning.
[2:33:02.600 --> 2:33:06.360]  And I don't think I know people inside there and they say he locks himself in a room now.
[2:33:06.360 --> 2:33:10.080]  We'll talk to no one for a month, two months.
[2:33:10.080 --> 2:33:11.400]  Nothing would surprise me at this point.
[2:33:11.400 --> 2:33:15.680]  I think that we've seen, it's just shocking to me.
[2:33:15.680 --> 2:33:18.200]  I've seen, I've very rarely ever seen anything like this.
[2:33:18.200 --> 2:33:19.800]  They say with the chips are down.
[2:33:19.800 --> 2:33:21.200]  You found out who's who.
[2:33:21.200 --> 2:33:24.880]  Allie Alexander, you know, he's a great guy, not a coward, a smart cookie.
[2:33:24.880 --> 2:33:30.520]  Here's our guest, one more segment with him and then Jay Dreyer has Sam Hyde, the big
[2:33:30.520 --> 2:33:35.120]  famous well spoken and informative and funny comedian coming on.
[2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:41.760]  Stay with us in full wars.com, news wars.com and Allie on Twitter.
[2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:47.840]  Incrementalism, the inchworm effect, successive approximation.
[2:33:47.840 --> 2:33:52.600]  First they tell you only stay in your house for 15 days to the hospitals can stay empty.
[2:33:52.600 --> 2:33:53.600]  That was all a fraud.
[2:33:53.600 --> 2:33:55.520]  Then wear a mask for a month.
[2:33:55.520 --> 2:33:57.520]  Here we are six months later.
[2:33:57.520 --> 2:34:03.200]  Then they start making people in colleges and at big corporations where wristbands showing
[2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:07.440]  that they've been quote, contact traced and tested for COVID.
[2:34:07.440 --> 2:34:12.080]  Then comes the apps on your phones and the global social credit score now being rolled
[2:34:12.080 --> 2:34:14.840]  out by Virginia, California and others.
[2:34:14.840 --> 2:34:15.840]  It's not coming.
[2:34:15.840 --> 2:34:16.840]  It's here.
[2:34:16.840 --> 2:34:17.840]  And then the inoculations.
[2:34:17.840 --> 2:34:22.160]  If you ever want to leave your house, which amounts to forced inoculations.
[2:34:22.160 --> 2:34:24.720]  This is the medical tyranny takeover.
[2:34:24.720 --> 2:34:27.440]  These are not classic vaccines that have their own problems.
[2:34:27.440 --> 2:34:33.560]  These are DNA vaccines that change your DNA and are having massive, serious side effects.
[2:34:33.560 --> 2:34:39.360]  Guaranteed this is about depopulation, Bill Gates admits that this is an emergency, resist
[2:34:39.360 --> 2:34:40.360]  or die.
[2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:42.480]  The new world order is here.
[2:34:42.480 --> 2:34:49.240]  You can really break civilizations down to two types, predatory and non predatory or
[2:34:49.240 --> 2:34:54.800]  oppressive conquest based or Renaissance based and of course different types of civilizations
[2:34:54.800 --> 2:35:01.400]  and countries and political systems of history and at the present are mixes of the two.
[2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:06.800]  But with globalism, it is a post human ideology.
[2:35:06.800 --> 2:35:11.120]  So it's scientifically geared to be oppressive.
[2:35:11.120 --> 2:35:15.920]  And the rationale is social Darwinism that the ruling class are elites and because they're
[2:35:15.920 --> 2:35:22.080]  in power, they have a right to rule over you, poison you, dumb you down, sterilize you and
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:23.080]  kill you.
[2:35:23.080 --> 2:35:28.080]  So all the people wearing masks like outside at the park and stuff are living in a total
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:33.320]  hoax and think their act of submission is an act of working for the common good in a
[2:35:33.320 --> 2:35:34.320]  collective.
[2:35:34.320 --> 2:35:38.440]  No, it's a sign that you're a slave who will take the force inoculations.
[2:35:38.440 --> 2:35:43.920]  Federal government and Yale are studying the force inoculations right now.
[2:35:43.920 --> 2:35:47.200]  How do you contest an election in the year 2020?
[2:35:47.200 --> 2:35:52.920]  Well, you trigger race riots and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:56.640]  the speaker of the house that you are legitimately now the president.
[2:35:56.640 --> 2:36:01.120]  That's what she's been said on CBS News and that you're going to have those blue states
[2:36:01.120 --> 2:36:02.120]  succeed.
[2:36:02.120 --> 2:36:06.800]  Yes, that's officially called a civil war, ladies and gentlemen, and the Democrats are
[2:36:06.800 --> 2:36:10.640]  backed by the EU, Hollywood, the chai comms and the whole globalist system.
[2:36:10.640 --> 2:36:15.840]  This is treason with a capital T and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards they
[2:36:15.840 --> 2:36:20.240]  won't even stand up against it and do anything even though our president has been exposing
[2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:21.240]  it.
[2:36:21.240 --> 2:36:22.240]  Here's the bottom line.
[2:36:22.240 --> 2:36:23.240]  You need storeable food.
[2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:26.760]  We've got the best quality ready to ship to you right now, two to four week delivery
[2:36:26.760 --> 2:36:28.360]  with 80 days out from the election.
[2:36:28.360 --> 2:36:32.240]  You need to get high quality storeable food right now in case they are able to pull this
[2:36:32.240 --> 2:36:33.240]  off.
[2:36:33.240 --> 2:36:35.760]  We're going to have a great depression war on the streets that will make a road warrior
[2:36:35.760 --> 2:36:36.760]  look like a cakewalk.
[2:36:36.760 --> 2:36:41.680]  Get your high quality storeable foods now and get ready and get prepared at infowarstore.com.
[2:36:41.680 --> 2:36:42.880]  Get prepared.
[2:36:42.880 --> 2:36:46.160]  This is a maximum alert, a maximum alert.
[2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:50.080]  As of taping this alert, you're 82 days out from the election.
[2:36:50.080 --> 2:36:54.440]  As many of you know in the last year, I pointed out statements out of the council on foreign
[2:36:54.440 --> 2:36:59.680]  relations and other globalist organs that they know Trump is going to win in a landslide.
[2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:05.400]  So their strategy will be to contest the election if they fail to successfully steal it.
[2:37:05.400 --> 2:37:09.920]  Then they are openly now wargaming, this is in the New York Times, having democratic
[2:37:09.920 --> 2:37:14.920]  states and cities secede from the union, just like they've ignored Trump's policies
[2:37:14.920 --> 2:37:17.720]  on coronavirus and kept their areas locked down.
[2:37:17.720 --> 2:37:20.080]  That is nothing but a dress rehearsal.
[2:37:20.080 --> 2:37:23.840]  They are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration, not in D.C.
[2:37:23.840 --> 2:37:30.680]  They said in another city, Pelosi has said this, when they crown Biden and Kamala Harris.
[2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:34.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the organized civil war.
[2:37:34.320 --> 2:37:36.520]  This is their public criminal plan.
[2:37:36.520 --> 2:37:40.000]  We should be praying, we should be spreading the word, we should be demanding Trump won
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:45.720]  the office to expose this criminal activity.
[2:37:45.720 --> 2:37:50.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:50.160 --> 2:38:05.600]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going
[2:38:05.600 --> 2:38:11.720]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[2:38:11.720 --> 2:38:20.520]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:38:20.520 --> 2:38:24.640]  I've been thinking about this for four or five days and I decided to do it.
[2:38:24.640 --> 2:38:28.480]  I don't know what to call the night's broadcast, but I know that we're going to start doing
[2:38:28.480 --> 2:38:32.560]  a couple of nights a week, special commercial free broadcasts that are on the radio and
[2:38:32.560 --> 2:38:36.360]  TV satellites for stations that want them and at bandodvideoandm4wars.com.
[2:38:36.360 --> 2:38:39.840]  We usually get a couple hundred thousand people to tune into these.
[2:38:39.840 --> 2:38:43.680]  Because we've had up to three million that end up clicking these, especially that was
[2:38:43.680 --> 2:38:45.600]  back during the last election.
[2:38:45.600 --> 2:38:50.320]  We had some of these that three million special broadcasts, three million IP addresses hitting
[2:38:50.320 --> 2:38:51.480]  us.
[2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:54.320]  So that's when you get excited and you spread the word and you do it.
[2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:56.200]  That's outside of YouTube, outside of Facebook.
[2:38:56.200 --> 2:38:57.440]  That's bandodvideo.
[2:38:57.440 --> 2:39:01.600]  So tonight I was sitting back thinking about my next question to Ali Alexander.
[2:39:01.600 --> 2:39:06.160]  I hadn't really plugged except yesterday that we're going to go live tonight commercial
[2:39:06.160 --> 2:39:10.440]  free seven to 10 p.m.
[2:39:10.440 --> 2:39:14.080]  We're going to have Roger Stone, we're going to have Laura Loomer, who's set to win her
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:15.080]  primary in Florida.
[2:39:15.080 --> 2:39:18.560]  We're going to have constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes and others tonight and your
[2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:19.560]  calls.
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:20.560]  I said, what do we call this?
[2:39:20.560 --> 2:39:23.760]  I was thinking of that like an hour ago, but then I was thinking, what's my next question
[2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:24.760]  for Ali Alexander?
[2:39:24.760 --> 2:39:27.200]  And I said, well, how do we stop Civil War two?
[2:39:27.200 --> 2:39:30.640]  Because that's what the deep state chai comms globalists, they don't care the Democrats
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:31.640]  lose.
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:34.440]  They just want to scuttle the economy, kill the dollar.
[2:39:34.440 --> 2:39:38.000]  That's why they're going with this play is because you look at Kamala Harris or Biden,
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  you think that's the general.
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:40.880]  No, that's not even the captain.
[2:39:40.880 --> 2:39:48.400]  That's more like a ringwraith, a zombie, a robot, an automaton that's following orders.
[2:39:48.400 --> 2:39:58.240]  And so tonight we're going to call it stop Civil War two emergency broadcast or stop
[2:39:58.240 --> 2:40:02.480]  succession Civil War two because it's official.
[2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:04.360]  We saw every major Democrat on TV.
[2:40:04.360 --> 2:40:07.440]  We saw all their surrogates saying Trump's going to steal it.
[2:40:07.440 --> 2:40:08.440]  We're going to secede.
[2:40:08.440 --> 2:40:10.320]  We'll have our own inauguration somewhere else.
[2:40:10.320 --> 2:40:11.720]  The military will decide.
[2:40:11.720 --> 2:40:13.640]  You're like, well, that's crazy.
[2:40:13.640 --> 2:40:14.640]  You have a normalcy bias.
[2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:16.240]  They're not going to do that.
[2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:19.960]  All they do is violate the normalcy bias.
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:23.480]  And so I've got a lot of questions in the last 10 minutes with Ali Alexander, great
[2:40:23.480 --> 2:40:27.040]  political analyst, smart guy, and he talks to the White House a lot, a lot of other
[2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:28.040]  people.
[2:40:28.040 --> 2:40:30.520]  He has his ear to the ground, but to me, that's number one.
[2:40:30.520 --> 2:40:36.000]  I agree Kamala Harris, terrible pick, rejected by progressives, the liberals, it'll add to
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:39.160]  Trump column massively, but they're not stupid.
[2:40:39.160 --> 2:40:43.040]  The ones behind it aren't stupid and they legitimately don't like Trump want to get rid
[2:40:43.040 --> 2:40:45.000]  of him, mail in ballots, all of it.
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:50.760]  So she's the perfect person to cover their attempted overthrow of the election and succession
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:54.000]  and Civil War again, making it about black and white.
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:56.960]  But this time a total shill, she's part African.
[2:40:56.960 --> 2:40:57.960]  That's their cover.
[2:40:57.960 --> 2:40:58.960]  That's why they chose her.
[2:40:58.960 --> 2:40:59.960]  She's bought and paid for.
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:01.520]  She'll do what she says.
[2:41:01.520 --> 2:41:04.040]  And that tells me they're going to make this move.
[2:41:04.040 --> 2:41:05.040]  What do we do?
[2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:06.040]  What does Trump do?
[2:41:06.040 --> 2:41:07.040]  What do you do?
[2:41:07.040 --> 2:41:08.040]  What do you think is going to happen?
[2:41:08.040 --> 2:41:10.800]  Because to me, you're one of the few guys talking about this other than I am.
[2:41:10.800 --> 2:41:12.120]  And for me, this is front and center.
[2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:15.280]  This is their grand strategy right now, or am I wrong?
[2:41:15.280 --> 2:41:17.680]  Is there some other strategy?
[2:41:17.680 --> 2:41:20.280]  Your whole life has been leading up to this moment.
[2:41:20.280 --> 2:41:25.960]  My career, which is definitely shorter than yours, has been leading up to this moment.
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:32.960]  I mean, everything from Bill Clinton trying to use Marxist language, you know, what is
[2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:33.960]  the definition?
[2:41:33.960 --> 2:41:37.880]  It depends on what is, is, you know, I think that that's when this nation failed.
[2:41:37.880 --> 2:41:41.080]  You know, a lot of people want to put the blame at Barack Obama.
[2:41:41.080 --> 2:41:42.400]  I think that was just gasoline.
[2:41:42.400 --> 2:41:44.520]  I've been thinking about this this past week.
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:46.520]  When did America fall?
[2:41:46.520 --> 2:41:48.520]  And can we resurrect her?
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:50.000]  And I've come to the conclusion.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  I agree.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:52.000]  It's the Clinton.
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:54.360]  It's the Clinton's flaunting lies on our face.
[2:41:54.360 --> 2:41:57.680]  It's the Clinton's and this goes back to a lot of things that you've been, you know,
[2:41:57.680 --> 2:42:00.840]  Alex, I'm just going to say it, you know, because I, you know, I think people know it
[2:42:00.840 --> 2:42:06.120]  in my audience, but let me just say it, I, my, most of my career, I had been skeptical
[2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:07.200]  of things you had said.
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:09.560]  I was like, you're not allowed to go near that guy.
[2:42:09.560 --> 2:42:10.920]  You're not allowed to talk about that guy.
[2:42:10.920 --> 2:42:12.800]  You're not about to link that guy.
[2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:17.400]  And then I remember our mutual friend, Mike Cernovich, one day asked me in 2018, would
[2:42:17.400 --> 2:42:18.920]  you ever go on Alex's show?
[2:42:18.920 --> 2:42:21.520]  And I said, you know, for the first time in my career, I would say yes.
[2:42:21.520 --> 2:42:25.080]  And then I think you had me on in 2018 or 2019.
[2:42:25.080 --> 2:42:30.760]  And I got to tell you, you just can't help but reconcile political theory with the Bible
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:35.880]  and come to these conclusions that, oh my gosh, you know, there really is a deep state.
[2:42:35.880 --> 2:42:42.680]  Oh my gosh, the Clinton's and the Bush's have a relationship that dates back to Arkansas.
[2:42:42.680 --> 2:42:46.640]  Oh my gosh, when this money goes missing, what is it funding?
[2:42:46.640 --> 2:42:52.920]  Oh my gosh, when Biden looked like he was going to pick Whitmer or Klobuchar, the BLM
[2:42:52.920 --> 2:42:57.360]  riots started, the Soros family boxed Biden into Kamala Harris.
[2:42:57.360 --> 2:43:04.840]  I got to tell you, it's not, it's not lunacy to point out what looks inevitable unless
[2:43:04.840 --> 2:43:06.920]  we wake up the population.
[2:43:06.920 --> 2:43:10.640]  And what I tell people now is do not be a reactionary.
[2:43:10.640 --> 2:43:13.920]  Do not just say the opposite of the left.
[2:43:13.920 --> 2:43:15.080]  Believe in something.
[2:43:15.080 --> 2:43:16.080]  Believe in order.
[2:43:16.080 --> 2:43:19.480]  Find yourself with God and then fight for that.
[2:43:19.480 --> 2:43:23.360]  Because what people need to understand, this is the most important thing I'll ever say
[2:43:23.360 --> 2:43:26.040]  is that the Marxists aren't like the left.
[2:43:26.040 --> 2:43:27.840]  It's a spiritual thing for them.
[2:43:27.840 --> 2:43:30.280]  They need to incite division.
[2:43:30.280 --> 2:43:36.320]  There's not enough division on society versus BLM, but there will be enough when, oh, this
[2:43:36.320 --> 2:43:41.440]  person dies, this kid dies, this grandma dies, and then we're all pulled into what you call
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:42.440]  a black hole.
[2:43:42.440 --> 2:43:49.160]  What your viewers need to research is the event horizon, and Alex, we are meters, meters
[2:43:49.160 --> 2:43:54.240]  away from an event horizon that will pull us all into a legitimate civil strife.
[2:43:54.240 --> 2:43:55.440]  Right now it's illegitimate.
[2:43:55.440 --> 2:43:56.440]  It's optics.
[2:43:56.440 --> 2:43:57.440]  No, I agree.
[2:43:57.440 --> 2:43:59.840]  People on Twitter are like, Jones looks like crap.
[2:43:59.840 --> 2:44:01.160]  Yeah, I can't sleep.
[2:44:01.160 --> 2:44:02.160]  I'm stressed out.
[2:44:02.160 --> 2:44:03.160]  And they're all laughing.
[2:44:03.160 --> 2:44:04.160]  They think it's funny.
[2:44:04.160 --> 2:44:05.160]  I agree.
[2:44:05.160 --> 2:44:10.160]  My whole life's built towards this year's, I'm just like, how do we stop this?
[2:44:10.160 --> 2:44:14.360]  We're watching everything like the Titanic going towards an iceberg, and the people that
[2:44:14.360 --> 2:44:18.240]  are going to drown first are laughing about it.
[2:44:18.240 --> 2:44:20.960]  It's, it's, I got three hours of sleep last night.
[2:44:20.960 --> 2:44:23.360]  I share your, I didn't even shave this morning.
[2:44:23.360 --> 2:44:25.920]  It just, I share your, your pain.
[2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:30.040]  And what I want to tell people is, look, I was, I, I've been a Southern Baptist Christian
[2:44:30.040 --> 2:44:31.760]  for 20 years.
[2:44:31.760 --> 2:44:35.680]  I'm probably going to become Catholic or Orthodox, but I will tell you, this is what
[2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:37.440]  I want to tell people.
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:39.720]  Study the color revolutions.
[2:44:39.720 --> 2:44:46.600]  Study the pre-civil war of America Catholics study our Lady of Fatima and then evangelicals
[2:44:46.600 --> 2:44:49.120]  study revelation very closely.
[2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:55.120]  And what I say is this, when all comes together, the same message, all together and, and, and
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:45:00.320]  I got to tell you, we must ask for God's intervention and we must walk blindly in faith.
[2:45:00.320 --> 2:45:03.640]  Well, you said it, the, the globalists are Satanist.
[2:45:03.640 --> 2:45:04.640]  They're out in the open.
[2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:05.640]  They're calling on Satan.
[2:45:05.640 --> 2:45:08.840]  And the one thing that it wants to do is to call on Christ.
[2:45:08.840 --> 2:45:09.840]  They are.
[2:45:09.840 --> 2:45:10.840]  Think about this, Alex.
[2:45:10.840 --> 2:45:12.120]  You've been in this for more than 25 years.
[2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:13.820]  I've been in this for 13 years.
[2:45:13.820 --> 2:45:19.920]  Have we ever seen this many, which covens, pray and curse and hex together?
[2:45:19.920 --> 2:45:20.920]  No.
[2:45:20.920 --> 2:45:25.120]  Have, have we ever seen this many random blood sacrifices in, in forest?
[2:45:25.120 --> 2:45:30.280]  Well, General Flynn came out and said, it is Satan manifesting through communist.
[2:45:30.280 --> 2:45:31.920]  We must call on Christ.
[2:45:31.920 --> 2:45:32.920]  It's, it's, it's there.
[2:45:32.920 --> 2:45:33.920]  It's, it's there.
[2:45:33.920 --> 2:45:36.160]  And I have the, the encouraging thing is this.
[2:45:36.160 --> 2:45:42.160]  I have hundreds of atheists, hundreds of atheists DMing me on Twitter and Instagram and my
[2:45:42.160 --> 2:45:45.320]  personal website, olliealexander.org.
[2:45:45.320 --> 2:45:50.040]  And they're like, I don't know that I believe in God, but what you're saying is lining up
[2:45:50.040 --> 2:45:51.280]  with reality.
[2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:52.360]  What do I need to read?
[2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:53.360]  What do I need to study?
[2:45:53.360 --> 2:45:54.360]  Yeah.
[2:45:54.360 --> 2:45:56.480]  World government force chips to buy and sell.
[2:45:56.480 --> 2:45:57.880]  I mean, it's all happening.
[2:45:57.880 --> 2:46:03.160]  It's, it's, it's all happening and, and, and, and on all we got to do is call out their
[2:46:03.160 --> 2:46:08.680]  clown world and, and then the, the general public, they love to do these things in plain
[2:46:08.680 --> 2:46:10.560]  sight and secret.
[2:46:10.560 --> 2:46:14.920]  And when you make, when you make their plain sight secret and when you make their secret
[2:46:14.920 --> 2:46:21.000]  out in the open, when you invert their inversion, then they go away for, because they're inversion,
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  you flip it.
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  It's the truth.
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  Right.
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:25.000]  And, and, and this knows the truth.
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  You said a big secret.
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:27.360]  This is very esoteric.
[2:46:27.360 --> 2:46:31.160]  We aren't as ancient evil being Satan as we're a little bit younger and more powerful, but
[2:46:31.160 --> 2:46:33.360]  younger Satan knows the truth.
[2:46:33.360 --> 2:46:38.400]  So he always flips it because that has power of the truth, but, but so we flip what they've
[2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:40.200]  done into the exact truth.
[2:46:40.200 --> 2:46:42.680]  There's power in just flipping what they've done.
[2:46:42.680 --> 2:46:44.520]  They have power in flipping what we've done.
[2:46:44.520 --> 2:46:48.400]  Our power is just flipping what they did and that is what's going on.
[2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:49.400]  Right.
[2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:53.160]  And that's why God calls us to obedience and look, you know, you and I, you know, we
[2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:57.760]  may engage in, in some sinning and that's why you repent and that's why you work to
[2:46:57.760 --> 2:47:03.440]  become more obedient, because all it does is it aligns your, your soul and your body
[2:47:03.440 --> 2:47:05.640]  with the heaven, with the kingdom of heaven.
[2:47:05.640 --> 2:47:07.480]  And so that's what repentance is about.
[2:47:07.480 --> 2:47:08.920]  That's what obedience is about.
[2:47:08.920 --> 2:47:11.840]  It's having that clarity where I want to realign.
[2:47:11.840 --> 2:47:16.200]  I'm sorry for what I did, but people killed to get their wives.
[2:47:16.200 --> 2:47:17.200]  He was sorry later.
[2:47:17.200 --> 2:47:18.200]  It was real.
[2:47:18.200 --> 2:47:19.200]  God knew that alignment was real.
[2:47:19.200 --> 2:47:20.960]  It wasn't some form of magic.
[2:47:20.960 --> 2:47:24.400]  It wasn't, he was getting atonement or, or, or get out of jail, free card.
[2:47:24.400 --> 2:47:26.760]  He was really sad and God took him back.
[2:47:26.760 --> 2:47:27.760]  Yeah.
[2:47:27.760 --> 2:47:30.160]  It's wanting to see the vision of the future.
[2:47:30.160 --> 2:47:33.720]  And that's why we're able to predict some of these things and we're able to say, hey,
[2:47:33.720 --> 2:47:36.560]  the timeline's moving this way, the timeline's moving this way.
[2:47:36.560 --> 2:47:41.280]  The thing that I'll end with is that, you know, go back to the Archbishop, Vigano's
[2:47:41.280 --> 2:47:45.880]  letter to Donald Trump, where he talks about the deep state and the deep church and research
[2:47:45.880 --> 2:47:51.440]  Kamala Harris, who was shilling for what's called the velvet mafia in the Catholic church.
[2:47:51.440 --> 2:47:56.240]  And what you need to understand is that the very end, the Latin phrase of Vigano's letter
[2:47:56.240 --> 2:47:58.240]  is what is absolutely happening.
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:47:59.720]  I, I don't speak Latin.
[2:47:59.720 --> 2:48:00.720]  Hold on.
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:02.720]  We've got our next guest host, Jay Dyer, coming up.
[2:48:02.720 --> 2:48:03.720]  Two minute break.
[2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:04.720]  Finish up on this.
[2:48:04.720 --> 2:48:05.720]  This is really important.
[2:48:05.720 --> 2:48:09.600]  Five more minutes with L.A. Alexandria and I'll tell listeners this tonight, seven o'clock
[2:48:09.600 --> 2:48:10.600]  central, warrahmins at six.
[2:48:10.600 --> 2:48:11.600]  We have an hour to break.
[2:48:11.600 --> 2:48:15.560]  I'll be back with Roger Stone with huge breaking news at seven p.m. central.
[2:48:15.560 --> 2:48:19.200]  Share those live links from band.videonewswords.com.
[2:48:19.200 --> 2:48:23.960]  Only way they get out is you, commercial free tonight.
[2:48:23.960 --> 2:48:24.960]  Three hours.
[2:48:24.960 --> 2:48:25.960]  One more.
[2:48:25.960 --> 2:48:26.960]  Thanks for building info wars.
[2:48:26.960 --> 2:48:31.600]  We'll be back with hour number four, five more minutes with L.A. Alexandria.
[2:48:31.600 --> 2:48:35.440]  The social engineers bet on you not having a memory more than anything.
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:39.560]  And they also bet, as they constantly talk about it in their own words, that you will
[2:48:39.560 --> 2:48:44.300]  adapt to being a slave, that you will learn incrementally to submit.
[2:48:44.300 --> 2:48:48.240]  So think about and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud.
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:51.440]  Remember that everything he said has been a premeditated lie.
[2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:53.280]  They lied about where it came from.
[2:48:53.280 --> 2:48:57.920]  They lied about person to person, the UN covered it all up, then exaggerated the death rate
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:04.680]  at 4%, but it's actually 0.032 now and dropping.
[2:49:04.680 --> 2:49:07.720]  Then they set the test up to count almost all false positives.
[2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:11.680]  They put the names of people that died of other diseases in the COVID column.
[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:13.600]  They only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown.
[2:49:13.600 --> 2:49:15.080]  Now we're six months later.
[2:49:15.080 --> 2:49:16.680]  Now they say it's permanent.
[2:49:16.680 --> 2:49:20.360]  You got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations are coming and they're going to track everywhere
[2:49:20.360 --> 2:49:24.400]  you go and what you do, the global social credit score and the UN is the boss and anybody
[2:49:24.400 --> 2:49:27.800]  questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job.
[2:49:27.800 --> 2:49:29.440]  That's called 21st century tyranny.
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:32.160]  That's called world government takeover.
[2:49:32.160 --> 2:49:37.480]  When the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden two years ago, they knew he had
[2:49:37.480 --> 2:49:39.440]  serious cognitive problems.
[2:49:39.440 --> 2:49:44.160]  He has always been an empty suit that does what he's told by the globalist and their
[2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:46.120]  allied crime syndicates.
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:49.360]  Kamala Harris is even worse than does whatever she's told.
[2:49:49.360 --> 2:49:53.800]  She's bought and paid for it by Silicon Valley, the Chai comms and others.
[2:49:53.800 --> 2:50:00.320]  So she has been chosen because she's part African and now anyone that criticizes her
[2:50:00.320 --> 2:50:05.000]  will be called a racist and evil and she is now above reproach.
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:09.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose this monster for who she is.
[2:50:09.760 --> 2:50:14.640]  We must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people three times longer
[2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:15.640]  than white people.
[2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:21.480]  The woman is a monster, Kamala Harris will end up being our president if they're able
[2:50:21.480 --> 2:50:27.080]  to steal the election and she is a 110% new world order puppet.
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:29.800]  Now more than ever, we must expose this monster.
[2:50:29.800 --> 2:50:35.240]  We must expose the globalist.
[2:50:35.240 --> 2:51:01.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:01.920 --> 2:51:05.320]  All right, L.E. Alexander just intrigued me because I remember when the big arts bishop
[2:51:05.320 --> 2:51:11.040]  came out and says the fight between good and evil, political analyst L.E. Alexander, who
[2:51:11.040 --> 2:51:13.720]  by the way, it was great when he came on a few times a few years ago, but he was still
[2:51:13.720 --> 2:51:15.680]  a little, little holding back today.
[2:51:15.680 --> 2:51:17.640]  He's been one of the best guests we've ever had.
[2:51:17.640 --> 2:51:18.640]  He is on fire.
[2:51:18.640 --> 2:51:19.880]  I think he said it.
[2:51:19.880 --> 2:51:21.640]  He's passed any fear.
[2:51:21.640 --> 2:51:24.960]  He didn't have the fear before to come on, but now he's just all guns are blazing.
[2:51:24.960 --> 2:51:26.080]  He's all in.
[2:51:26.080 --> 2:51:27.080]  People can tell it.
[2:51:27.080 --> 2:51:28.080]  It's amazing.
[2:51:28.080 --> 2:51:30.760]  So the four minutes we have left, get into what you were covering.
[2:51:30.760 --> 2:51:36.680]  So what people, you know, you know, Sun Tzu writes that the art of war is deception, you
[2:51:36.680 --> 2:51:41.560]  know, and I don't mean to correct his work, but when I read his work for me, the art,
[2:51:41.560 --> 2:51:45.320]  the essence of the art of war that is, is, is timing.
[2:51:45.320 --> 2:51:51.680]  And you know, I'll say Alex, you, in 13 years of doing hundreds of panels and interviews,
[2:51:51.680 --> 2:51:55.640]  you introduced me the best when you're like, here's an insider who wants the outside the
[2:51:55.640 --> 2:51:58.400]  barbarians to know what's going on inside the castle.
[2:51:58.400 --> 2:52:03.360]  And what I'll say is, is I've been waiting for this moment, hoping it would never come.
[2:52:03.360 --> 2:52:08.180]  So there is urgency in the now and what people need to know, and I don't want to like explode
[2:52:08.180 --> 2:52:14.600]  brains too much is Arch Bishop, Vigano's letter to Donald Trump, which Donald Trump
[2:52:14.600 --> 2:52:22.000]  then retweeted out needs to be read, understanding that there is a public meaning and a private
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  secret.
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:26.360]  And at the very end of that letter, there is a Latin phrase and I don't speak Latin,
[2:52:26.360 --> 2:52:30.280]  so I'm going to butcher it a little, but it's solve et coagula.
[2:52:30.280 --> 2:52:34.120]  And what it means is to dissolve and recongeal.
[2:52:34.120 --> 2:52:41.800]  And what you need to understand is that the sum of Alex's work in studying, you know,
[2:52:41.800 --> 2:52:47.360]  this secret society or this Marxist group or that group or that group is to this end.
[2:52:47.360 --> 2:52:49.480]  It is in service of Satan.
[2:52:49.480 --> 2:52:51.560]  And as you pointed out, Satan is older than us.
[2:52:51.560 --> 2:52:59.800]  He has always sought to have humanly servants that will dissolve things, invert things, change
[2:52:59.800 --> 2:53:00.960]  meanings of words.
[2:53:00.960 --> 2:53:06.800]  That's why they must change words first and then reform it and put it back together.
[2:53:06.800 --> 2:53:11.960]  That's why you never see the leftist completely abolish anything that they say.
[2:53:11.960 --> 2:53:14.400]  They never abolish inequality.
[2:53:14.400 --> 2:53:16.160]  They never abolish money.
[2:53:16.160 --> 2:53:17.920]  They never abolish class.
[2:53:17.920 --> 2:53:20.280]  They never abolish the military.
[2:53:20.280 --> 2:53:21.760]  They recongeal it.
[2:53:21.760 --> 2:53:27.120]  And what Vigano was pointing out is that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, remember Joe Biden
[2:53:27.120 --> 2:53:34.200]  professes to be a Catholic, Kamala Harris gave Catholic priests who were fondling children
[2:53:34.200 --> 2:53:36.880]  a pass while she was attorney general.
[2:53:36.880 --> 2:53:37.880]  It's the velvet mafia.
[2:53:37.880 --> 2:53:41.960]  And what people need to understand is that our institutions, the American government
[2:53:41.960 --> 2:53:45.160]  and the Catholic church are being infiltrated.
[2:53:45.160 --> 2:53:49.640]  And that's why people need to, you know, research Dr. Taylor Marshall on YouTube.
[2:53:49.640 --> 2:53:54.600]  He's done an extensive video on this infiltration of the Catholic church, but Vigano says, no,
[2:53:54.600 --> 2:53:59.200]  there's a deep church and a deep state and they work together and it's all coming to
[2:53:59.200 --> 2:54:02.960]  the precipice in November.
[2:54:02.960 --> 2:54:07.840]  We are at that moment where I gladly use, lose my Twitter account right now to tell
[2:54:07.840 --> 2:54:13.560]  people, wake up, we're at a, we're at a top three moment in human history.
[2:54:13.560 --> 2:54:17.240]  And there have been times they've taken your Twitter account down and they're doing it
[2:54:17.240 --> 2:54:18.920]  to so many other people right now.
[2:54:18.920 --> 2:54:19.920]  Yeah.
[2:54:19.920 --> 2:54:20.920]  Yeah.
[2:54:20.920 --> 2:54:23.320]  I've been permanently suspended before and, you know, I've, I've used my relationships
[2:54:23.320 --> 2:54:24.820]  to get it back.
[2:54:24.820 --> 2:54:29.040]  But you know, I know the time is coming where, you know, I will join you and Gavin and Lauren
[2:54:29.040 --> 2:54:32.260]  Roger in, uh, in the dark alleys.
[2:54:32.260 --> 2:54:36.880]  But I think the time is also coming where these centralized platforms, they either win
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:40.040]  and we lose or we win and we do centralize the area.
[2:54:40.040 --> 2:54:42.240]  We're coming down to the battle of the gods right now.
[2:54:42.240 --> 2:54:43.240]  The good or the wrong.
[2:54:43.240 --> 2:54:46.600]  I mean, this, this is one of those times that was every few hundred years, every thousand
[2:54:46.600 --> 2:54:47.600]  years.
[2:54:47.600 --> 2:54:51.440]  It was the super event and then this election just leads to the cascade because even if
[2:54:51.440 --> 2:54:53.680]  Trump wins, they're going to go crazy.
[2:54:53.680 --> 2:54:55.280]  I mean, the battle just begun.
[2:54:55.280 --> 2:55:00.400]  It's like when Roger was still having election night four years ago and I said, Roger, the
[2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:04.440]  war just begun and he knows now and I said, man, I said, are you ready to put you in
[2:55:04.440 --> 2:55:05.440]  prison?
[2:55:05.440 --> 2:55:06.440]  He goes, Oh, we got the president.
[2:55:06.440 --> 2:55:07.960]  I said, get ready.
[2:55:07.960 --> 2:55:08.960]  Get ready.
[2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:12.200]  I mean, it's, they've, they've infiltrated even the good.
[2:55:12.200 --> 2:55:14.440]  Remember they can't create a contrast with us.
[2:55:14.440 --> 2:55:18.400]  They must infiltrate us in either in order to deceive our believers.
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:19.400]  That's right.
[2:55:19.400 --> 2:55:20.400]  Come back soon.
[2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:21.400]  Don't wait a year.
[2:55:21.400 --> 2:55:24.320]  Come back and get into the, the election and all the stuff coming down and more on Kamala
[2:55:24.320 --> 2:55:25.320]  Harris.
[2:55:25.320 --> 2:55:26.320]  Are you ready to expose her?
[2:55:26.320 --> 2:55:27.320]  We didn't get the day.
[2:55:27.320 --> 2:55:28.320]  Come back next week.
[2:55:28.320 --> 2:55:29.320]  Allie Alexander.
[2:55:29.320 --> 2:55:30.320]  Thank you so much.
[2:55:30.320 --> 2:55:32.240]  Very impressed at ALI on Twitter.
[2:55:32.240 --> 2:55:40.920]  We'll be back with Jay Dyer and Sam Hyde, the comedian they take over in T minus 60 seconds.
[2:55:40.920 --> 2:55:46.560]  The United Nations and the National Institutes of Health with the CDC are publicly conducting
[2:55:46.560 --> 2:55:53.960]  a 4,000 person study, spending tens of millions of dollars at Yale on 15 ways to brainwash
[2:55:53.960 --> 2:55:59.200]  the public into taking inoculations, basically squeezing you and forcing you to take them
[2:55:59.200 --> 2:56:03.640]  through guilt, through fines, through not being able to go into stores, not being able to
[2:56:03.640 --> 2:56:05.480]  get on airplanes or have jobs.
[2:56:05.480 --> 2:56:08.000]  This is forced inoculations.
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:12.080]  This public gateway pun that wrote about it last week, David Knight wrote about it this
[2:56:12.080 --> 2:56:17.840]  week, stories up on infowars.com, so people say, oh, I'll just wear a mask, but it's never
[2:56:17.840 --> 2:56:19.240]  going to end.
[2:56:19.240 --> 2:56:21.120]  That's just the sign of submission.
[2:56:21.120 --> 2:56:23.000]  Fouchy admits that.
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:28.080]  Next is the contact tracing of the apps on your phones and the inoculations that is a
[2:56:28.080 --> 2:56:31.000]  DNA vaccine that changes your DNA.
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:32.880]  This isn't a science fiction movie.
[2:56:32.880 --> 2:56:35.320]  It's happening right now.
[2:56:35.320 --> 2:56:36.840]  Compliance is death.
[2:56:36.840 --> 2:56:38.280]  This is annihilation.
[2:56:38.280 --> 2:56:39.280]  Wake up.
[2:56:39.280 --> 2:56:40.280]  Wake up.
[2:56:40.280 --> 2:57:02.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[2:57:02.280 --> 2:57:05.320]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, you know.
[2:57:05.320 --> 2:57:10.480]  I was on here a couple of months ago for the first time, and I said some strange, enigmatic,
[2:57:10.480 --> 2:57:12.440]  mysterious phrases.
[2:57:12.440 --> 2:57:13.440]  I prophesized.
[2:57:13.440 --> 2:57:19.840]  I said, test tube, gub, gub, snail man, micro-machines, and some people were mystified by this, but
[2:57:19.840 --> 2:57:25.880]  I was predicting the future, I was predicting the one, the only, the legend of trolling,
[2:57:25.880 --> 2:57:32.440]  Mr. Samuel Hyde is joining us today, and before I mention that, before I get into that, I
[2:57:32.440 --> 2:57:37.440]  wanted to say that, you know, I thought that I was a legend of trolling at one time.
[2:57:37.440 --> 2:57:42.600]  When I was in high school, we actually arranged a kind of a black operation, you could say,
[2:57:42.600 --> 2:57:48.080]  in high school, high school black ops, where we wanted to upseat the existing order by
[2:57:48.080 --> 2:57:52.600]  electing a beautiful slow boy to a class president.
[2:57:52.600 --> 2:57:53.600]  And that's a true story.
[2:57:53.600 --> 2:57:58.200]  The cheerleaders, Mean Girls Brigade were furious, and I thought that I had mastered
[2:57:58.200 --> 2:58:03.680]  something of trolling, but I realized that in the big leagues, I was nothing.
[2:58:03.680 --> 2:58:10.040]  I was, I was, I myself was a test tube, gub, gub, snail man, micro-machine of trolling.
[2:58:10.040 --> 2:58:16.120]  And today I have the master, the, probably the, as Alex said, top of the totem pole of
[2:58:16.120 --> 2:58:23.120]  comedy for everyone, perhaps 40 and under, Mr. Sam Hyde, Sam, are you there?
[2:58:23.120 --> 2:58:24.120]  Can you see me?
[2:58:24.120 --> 2:58:25.120]  Hey.
[2:58:25.120 --> 2:58:28.960]  Can you hear me?
[2:58:28.960 --> 2:58:29.960]  I can hear you.
[2:58:29.960 --> 2:58:30.960]  Yes.
[2:58:30.960 --> 2:58:32.720]  That beautiful, smoky voice is coming through.
[2:58:32.720 --> 2:58:33.920]  I got to finish reading.
[2:58:33.920 --> 2:58:34.920]  I got to fit.
[2:58:34.920 --> 2:58:36.960]  I'm on the last page of my favorite book right now.
[2:58:36.960 --> 2:58:37.960]  Hold on.
[2:58:37.960 --> 2:58:39.320]  Is it, God damn, man.
[2:58:39.320 --> 2:58:40.320]  One second.
[2:58:40.320 --> 2:58:45.720]  Let me just change the background, choose background effect.
[2:58:45.720 --> 2:58:46.720]  There we go.
[2:58:46.720 --> 2:58:47.720]  Okay.
[2:58:47.720 --> 2:58:51.160]  I just had to, I got to finish reading the last page of my favorite book.
[2:58:51.160 --> 2:58:55.160]  Just kidding.
[2:58:55.160 --> 2:58:57.160]  Oh, just kidding.
[2:58:57.160 --> 2:59:00.160]  Oh my God.
[2:59:00.160 --> 2:59:01.560]  Thank you for saying these, by the way.
[2:59:01.560 --> 2:59:02.560]  They're very entertaining.
[2:59:02.560 --> 2:59:04.960]  The master troll trolled me on the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:04.960 --> 2:59:05.960]  Is this, this is epic.
[2:59:05.960 --> 2:59:11.440]  Well, they'd be, they'd be more entertaining if they weren't so packed with disturbing
[2:59:11.440 --> 2:59:12.440]  realities.
[2:59:12.440 --> 2:59:13.440]  One second.
[2:59:13.440 --> 2:59:18.360]  Let me just get back in the Elon Musk's private AI chamber.
[2:59:18.360 --> 2:59:19.360]  Okay.
[2:59:19.360 --> 2:59:20.360]  Hey, I'm back.
[2:59:20.360 --> 2:59:21.360]  I'm using teleportation now.
[2:59:21.360 --> 2:59:25.160]  I don't know if you know that's real, but teleportations with the Coombots.
[2:59:25.160 --> 2:59:26.160]  Yeah.
[2:59:26.160 --> 2:59:27.160]  Yes.
[2:59:27.160 --> 2:59:32.120]  We're, we're researching new ways to Coom, new unnatural freakish ways to genetically
[2:59:32.120 --> 2:59:36.960]  modify your testicles to make them, make your orgasm 10 times more powerful.
[2:59:36.960 --> 2:59:38.960]  This is, sorry.
[2:59:38.960 --> 2:59:39.960]  Yeah.
[2:59:39.960 --> 2:59:40.960]  Okay.
[2:59:40.960 --> 2:59:41.960]  Damn.
[2:59:41.960 --> 2:59:42.960]  Slow down.
[2:59:42.960 --> 2:59:43.960]  Slow down.
[2:59:43.960 --> 2:59:44.960]  You're going to blow our minds.
[2:59:44.960 --> 2:59:46.480]  Tell us, let's get back to the origins.
[2:59:46.480 --> 2:59:48.320]  What are the origins of Sam Hyde?
[2:59:48.320 --> 2:59:54.320]  Sam Hyde's influences, his comedic prowess, where, where do you come from?
[2:59:54.320 --> 2:59:57.320]  Who inspired you?
[2:59:57.320 --> 3:00:00.520]  Um, I, I, this is not a joke.
[3:00:00.520 --> 3:00:04.320]  I seriously, seriously just swallowed this wrong.
[3:00:04.320 --> 3:00:07.320]  One second.
[3:00:07.320 --> 3:00:09.320]  Give me like one second.
[3:00:09.320 --> 3:00:10.320]  Okay.
[3:00:10.320 --> 3:00:11.320]  All better.
[3:00:11.320 --> 3:00:16.720]  So I'm really sorry about that.
[3:00:16.720 --> 3:00:18.920]  It's unprofessional.
[3:00:18.920 --> 3:00:23.120]  Well, let me ask you something cause I need to know before we, before we do battle and
[3:00:23.120 --> 3:00:28.720]  debate because I'm an atheist technological, and I'm just kidding, but I want to, I want
[3:00:28.720 --> 3:00:35.640]  to size you up and know I seriously took that in the lungs.
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:36.640]  What kind of man you are?
[3:00:36.640 --> 3:00:43.960]  So I want to know, are you a birds be strawberry man or are you a vanilla bean man?
[3:00:43.960 --> 3:00:45.200]  Are you more of a classic man?
[3:00:45.200 --> 3:00:52.200]  This is important by the way, or are you a honey man or wait, are you a peppermint man?
[3:00:52.200 --> 3:00:53.520]  Are you a strawberry man?
[3:00:53.520 --> 3:00:54.520]  That's a dupe.
[3:00:54.520 --> 3:00:56.680]  Are you pumpkin spice?
[3:00:56.680 --> 3:01:00.560]  Are you more of a cucumber mint style or would you call yourself wild cherry?
[3:01:00.560 --> 3:01:04.840]  Now the thing people don't know about wild cherry stains your lips red.
[3:01:04.840 --> 3:01:08.920]  That's a price you might have to be willing to pay because it is technically the best
[3:01:08.920 --> 3:01:09.920]  flavor.
[3:01:09.920 --> 3:01:10.920]  Now I'll tell you my answer.
[3:01:10.920 --> 3:01:11.920]  What's your answer?
[3:01:11.920 --> 3:01:14.000]  Go with your gut.
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:22.800]  My immediate reaction is that, that soy mean face, but probably my fiance does lip gloss.
[3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:25.360]  So I just use whatever lip gloss she's got laying around.
[3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:27.600]  So no birds bees for me.
[3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:28.600]  Solid answer.
[3:01:28.600 --> 3:01:29.600]  Solid answer.
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:30.600]  Lip gloss.
[3:01:30.600 --> 3:01:31.600]  Sometimes superior case.
[3:01:31.600 --> 3:01:32.600]  I'm cucumber mint myself.
[3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:33.600]  Hold on a second.
[3:01:33.600 --> 3:01:34.600]  I knew it.
[3:01:34.600 --> 3:01:35.600]  Yeah.
[3:01:35.600 --> 3:01:36.600]  Cucumbers.
[3:01:36.600 --> 3:01:37.600]  I'm sorry.
[3:01:37.600 --> 3:01:38.600]  I'm not.
[3:01:38.600 --> 3:01:39.600]  I'm not sure.
[3:01:39.600 --> 3:01:40.600]  I shouldn't.
[3:01:40.600 --> 3:01:41.600]  I'm a little nervous right now.
[3:01:41.600 --> 3:01:47.920]  This many eyeballs Sam, tell us your origins and your influence.
[3:01:47.920 --> 3:01:50.120]  Where do you come from?
[3:01:50.120 --> 3:01:51.120]  I don't know, man.
[3:01:51.120 --> 3:01:57.000]  I've been, uh, my, I guess for influences, you know, the show wonder shows and you hear
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:02:01.600]  a wonder shows and I think if there was one comedic influence that did did the most for
[3:02:01.600 --> 3:02:06.960]  me, it would be wonder shows and, um, and there was also a collection of, uh, cartoons
[3:02:06.960 --> 3:02:10.720]  back in the day called liquid television and both of those, I think it's, I think those
[3:02:10.720 --> 3:02:12.160]  are important.
[3:02:12.160 --> 3:02:15.760]  I think those are important because the, um, the aesthetics to me has always been more
[3:02:15.760 --> 3:02:22.160]  interesting than, um, the content, which is weird to say, but like the, uh, the kind
[3:02:22.160 --> 3:02:28.400]  of, you know, the kind of vaporwave stuff you do that like I've, I put, I put a, I think
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:33.960]  the dressing, the sort of, the, the stylization of things is, um, there's an importance there
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:39.600]  and it's easy to get like wrapped up in, in going, uh, going with aesthetics in a way
[3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:43.640]  that's like vain or, or, uh, uh, doesn't have substance behind it.
[3:02:43.640 --> 3:02:48.760]  And I think, I think taking, um, combining substance with like finally honed aesthetics
[3:02:48.760 --> 3:02:51.640]  has been what's, uh, always kind of interested me.
[3:02:51.640 --> 3:02:56.800]  So most, most of my influences are aesthetic influences at 80s, anime, 90s, anime, um, that
[3:02:56.800 --> 3:02:57.800]  kind of stuff.
[3:02:57.800 --> 3:02:58.800]  Yeah.
[3:02:58.800 --> 3:03:03.480]  I remember you some liquid television and I was, I was always entranced by Aeon Flux
[3:03:03.480 --> 3:03:06.720]  and she was always like, you know, doing things with nipples.
[3:03:06.720 --> 3:03:09.840]  It was an obsession with nipples in that show and I, they're always weirding me out.
[3:03:09.840 --> 3:03:13.720]  Even though I love the art, but, but, uh, what, what was great about liquid television
[3:03:13.720 --> 3:03:18.720]  was that it was like a variety show and they would, they would offer actually creative,
[3:03:18.720 --> 3:03:23.120]  you know, stuff going on in alternative art at the time.
[3:03:23.120 --> 3:03:24.920]  There's not, there's not, there's nothing like that.
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:25.920]  Like it was there for a while.
[3:03:25.920 --> 3:03:33.200]  It went away and I see you, yes, as definitely a successor to that is that you went to art
[3:03:33.200 --> 3:03:34.920]  school, you know, you did this kind of stuff.
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:37.240]  You had to deal with the art hose at art school.
[3:03:37.240 --> 3:03:41.240]  You did some great comedy about them art hose, how did you get through art school without
[3:03:41.240 --> 3:03:42.240]  going crazy?
[3:03:42.240 --> 3:03:47.320]  I'm, I think that's when I started to think seriously about the distribution of resources
[3:03:47.320 --> 3:03:55.400]  and, uh, about, um, the, the, like the sort of the, the, um, where I'll notion that every,
[3:03:55.400 --> 3:03:58.880]  most people have when they're like 12 years old, think when they start to think about
[3:03:58.880 --> 3:04:05.200]  government and how things should be distributed and seeing the, like, um, inefficiency and
[3:04:05.200 --> 3:04:11.760]  the, um, uh, just the, the, the bureaucracy and what a, what a scam, what a scam college
[3:04:11.760 --> 3:04:12.760]  is.
[3:04:12.760 --> 3:04:16.440]  That's, um, that was a big formative thing for me was like living, living through the
[3:04:16.440 --> 3:04:24.880]  scam and watching my dad blow, uh, $250,000 on stuff you could learn on YouTube, basically.
[3:04:24.880 --> 3:04:25.880]  Yeah.
[3:04:25.880 --> 3:04:27.640]  I hadn't had a similar experience.
[3:04:27.640 --> 3:04:29.160]  I didn't blow that much.
[3:04:29.160 --> 3:04:30.160]  Wow.
[3:04:30.160 --> 3:04:34.960]  Uh, I did blow quite a bit though, uh, uh, on grad school and in the middle of grad
[3:04:34.960 --> 3:04:41.640]  school, I realized that I'm paying this D bag liberal guy to tell me that I can get a
[3:04:41.640 --> 3:04:46.760]  piece of paper and that he, who hates me will allow me to go and talk about the things that
[3:04:46.760 --> 3:04:48.560]  I actually knew better than that guy.
[3:04:48.560 --> 3:04:49.560]  You know what I mean?
[3:04:49.560 --> 3:04:53.360]  It's like, this is totally a scam and brainwashing, by the way.
[3:04:53.360 --> 3:04:57.160]  It's such, it's such an insane waste of money because that's that amount of money, you know,
[3:04:57.160 --> 3:04:59.560]  you can use that to start, not, not just one business.
[3:04:59.560 --> 3:05:02.440]  I mean, it depends on what kind of business you're trying to start, but that's like, that's
[3:05:02.440 --> 3:05:09.000]  startup capital for fucking, sorry, I'm sorry, that's startup capital for F and 10 businesses,
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:13.440]  you know, and that's across the, uh, across the entire country, all those people.
[3:05:13.440 --> 3:05:17.960]  I mean, if you want to help, if you're one of these people that wants to, uh, if you
[3:05:17.960 --> 3:05:23.560]  want to do good, if you want to be charitable, look at the, look at the, uh, the waste of,
[3:05:23.560 --> 3:05:27.160]  uh, the waste of money that's happening in, in colleges and think about what that, what
[3:05:27.160 --> 3:05:28.160]  that money could do.
[3:05:28.160 --> 3:05:34.840]  I mean, you know, Dwight Eisenhower has that, uh, his, his, uh, quote about, uh, man, I'm
[3:05:34.840 --> 3:05:36.360]  too scatterbrained for this podcasting.
[3:05:36.360 --> 3:05:39.640]  So this is one reason why I don't do it, but when he was, when he was running against
[3:05:39.640 --> 3:05:44.760]  the military industrial complex and talking about how, uh, you know, one B 52 bomber is
[3:05:44.760 --> 3:05:46.840]  like the cost of a hospital, that kind of thing.
[3:05:46.840 --> 3:05:52.920]  It's just like, um, there's so many people who, uh, are concerned with, with helping
[3:05:52.920 --> 3:05:59.520]  society, but they're unwilling to like, um, look at, uh, look for inefficiency in these
[3:05:59.520 --> 3:06:02.800]  hallowed institutions.
[3:06:02.800 --> 3:06:06.600]  Before we get to a paradigm shift, which was, was kind of an epic troll.
[3:06:06.600 --> 3:06:10.960]  Um, I want to, I want to take us out to the break and mention that if you want to follow
[3:06:10.960 --> 3:06:18.200]  Sam's work, you can go to mde.tv, mde.tv to, uh, get access to his content.
[3:06:18.200 --> 3:06:21.040]  My work is at jaysanalysis.com.
[3:06:21.040 --> 3:06:24.480]  You can find my books, uh, my subscription and all that there.
[3:06:24.480 --> 3:06:28.280]  Uh, and when we come back, we're going to get into some of the most epic trolling probably
[3:06:28.280 --> 3:06:29.280]  ever.
[3:06:29.280 --> 3:06:34.240]  Uh, if you've seen the yes men, you can think of those kinds of trolling events, but I think
[3:06:34.240 --> 3:06:38.160]  this one even topped that one by making fun of the whole Ted talk phenomena.
[3:06:38.160 --> 3:06:43.160]  So when we come back to get into that, which is like, the new world order is a planetary
[3:06:43.160 --> 3:06:49.440]  corporate plan for world government, but world government is only the control grid
[3:06:49.440 --> 3:06:56.160]  now intermembers of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods
[3:06:56.160 --> 3:06:57.160]  and attain immortality.
[3:06:57.160 --> 3:07:03.360]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based
[3:07:03.360 --> 3:07:04.860]  line forms.
[3:07:04.860 --> 3:07:06.960]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[3:07:06.960 --> 3:07:10.680]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[3:07:10.680 --> 3:07:12.560]  They are playing God.
[3:07:12.560 --> 3:07:19.320]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[3:07:19.320 --> 3:07:22.320]  to carry out this transformation.
[3:07:22.320 --> 3:07:26.760]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on
[3:07:26.760 --> 3:07:27.760]  record.
[3:07:27.760 --> 3:07:30.200]  You have been warned.
[3:07:30.200 --> 3:07:34.680]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[3:07:34.680 --> 3:07:38.320]  This is the end of all life on earth as we know it.
[3:07:38.320 --> 3:07:42.360]  This is the alien takeover of earth.
[3:07:42.360 --> 3:07:47.200]  I'm cutting this ad on Wednesday, August 12th, 2025 is coming Sunday.
[3:07:47.200 --> 3:07:51.760]  This huge sale we've been running for last week will have to end the re-open America
[3:07:51.760 --> 3:07:59.200]  back to school special 50% off to 60% off all of our top best sellers and double pay
[3:07:59.200 --> 3:08:00.200]  three at points.
[3:08:00.200 --> 3:08:05.200]  I have to end the sale because we're selling out of bodies at 50% off living defense, 50%
[3:08:05.200 --> 3:08:11.880]  off bad zombie, 50% off turbo, 40% off vitamin, 50% off those are all very close to selling
[3:08:11.880 --> 3:08:17.440]  out, a bunch of other best sellers we still have, but I will end this special on Sunday.
[3:08:17.440 --> 3:08:23.080]  We have a new great special coming up next week, but it's not as extensive or expansive
[3:08:23.080 --> 3:08:27.200]  as the X2, the original will come back and stop, it will be discounted, but it's not
[3:08:27.200 --> 3:08:28.200]  available yet.
[3:08:28.200 --> 3:08:32.640]  So this is a great sale, it funds the operation, there are great items, in crazy times like
[3:08:32.640 --> 3:08:36.560]  this it's good to stock up, but whatever you do, keep spreading the word about InfoWars
[3:08:36.560 --> 3:08:45.000]  because you are the modern voice, you are Paul Revere and I salute you and thank you.
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:09:08.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:09.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:09.760 --> 3:09:16.560]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, I don't know, with our good friend Sam Hyde.
[3:09:16.560 --> 3:09:22.840]  Sam, when I first saw Ted Talks, back in the early 2000s, I remember seeing the first
[3:09:22.840 --> 3:09:27.960]  one actually was not bad, it was something about symbols and geometry and nature and
[3:09:27.960 --> 3:09:32.200]  I was like, oh, this is pretty cool and then I click on the next Ted Talk and it's like
[3:09:32.200 --> 3:09:39.720]  some witchy woman saying, we have more men, we have more men, we have more men, we have
[3:09:39.720 --> 3:09:45.920]  more women graduating from college than men now and women are more men than men and then
[3:09:45.920 --> 3:09:49.000]  I click on the next one and it's Bill Gates and he's talking about, we got to get the
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:53.080]  numbers down, we got to get the numbers down, we got to get the numbers down, so eat your
[3:09:53.080 --> 3:09:58.520]  own, eat your own do, drink your own do, we'll have this epic troll, a paradigm shift where
[3:09:58.520 --> 3:10:01.280]  you troll Ted Talk, can you tell us about that?
[3:10:01.280 --> 3:10:06.640]  I'm sure you've talked about this before, Bill Gates' fixation on getting people to
[3:10:06.640 --> 3:10:14.080]  drink pee and eat their, drink their do to water, that's so insane, I'll get to your
[3:10:14.080 --> 3:10:15.080]  question in a second.
[3:10:15.080 --> 3:10:17.960]  Trent, how we're going to make, yeah, we're going to make feces into meat, this kind of
[3:10:17.960 --> 3:10:18.960]  stuff and then-
[3:10:18.960 --> 3:10:27.920]  Look, if you, dude, this is the thing, all right, I'm not actually all that racist, I'm
[3:10:27.920 --> 3:10:32.720]  probably as racist as most people are, I'm probably as racist as most black people are
[3:10:32.720 --> 3:10:40.920]  and there are things that happen to black people that are mind blowing, the human guinea
[3:10:40.920 --> 3:10:51.320]  pig stuff in Africa is so insane and the Bill Gates test, it's almost like the stuff they're
[3:10:51.320 --> 3:10:54.840]  doing is so evil, it's almost like if you had a video game and the point of the video
[3:10:54.840 --> 3:11:02.080]  game was to be as evil as possible to as many black people in Africa as possible and then
[3:11:02.080 --> 3:11:09.760]  making it so that they're like trying to get it so they're drinking urine and feces, that's
[3:11:09.760 --> 3:11:20.200]  the most insane evil thing, man, like never mind the tenfold increase in population from
[3:11:20.200 --> 3:11:25.880]  human aid, et cetera, never mind the vaccination experiments and the AIDS and all this other
[3:11:25.880 --> 3:11:29.720]  stuff, like the icing on the cake, like that's how you know someone's really evil is when
[3:11:29.720 --> 3:11:34.840]  they're, it's not just the pragmatic thing, it's not just like trying to bring about some,
[3:11:34.840 --> 3:11:38.560]  you know, in future world scenario, it's not like, oh, we need to do this to get to the
[3:11:38.560 --> 3:11:42.920]  mean, the means justify the end, we have to get here, we have to get to the future and
[3:11:42.920 --> 3:11:47.720]  injecting these blacks is very important to do, like, you know, it's absolutely evil
[3:11:47.720 --> 3:11:54.640]  when he's like, okay, now we're gonna make poopoo cakes.
[3:11:54.640 --> 3:12:01.400]  It's intentionally purile, it's an intentional like, like the dog rub the dog in the face,
[3:12:01.400 --> 3:12:05.400]  you know, his face and in the, in the mess.
[3:12:05.400 --> 3:12:11.080]  So I don't mean to appear callous, like laughing so much, it's just that it's so insane and
[3:12:11.080 --> 3:12:13.000]  twisted, like it doesn't sound real.
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:14.000]  It sounds crazy.
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:17.080]  It's not even out of like science fiction, like it's beyond, it's beyond that, like if
[3:12:17.080 --> 3:12:20.640]  you if a science fiction, fiction writer wrote something like that, you'd be like, oh, this
[3:12:20.640 --> 3:12:24.600]  is disturbing, I don't want to read this anymore, like there's no great, there's not that
[3:12:24.600 --> 3:12:28.200]  many ideas like this in great science fiction.
[3:12:28.200 --> 3:12:29.840]  It's just so insane.
[3:12:29.840 --> 3:12:37.880]  Anyway, so, sorry, Gil, Gil Bates had already done his TED talks, and then you did your
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:39.040]  troll of the TED talk.
[3:12:39.040 --> 3:12:41.760]  Can you tell us how that came about?
[3:12:41.760 --> 3:12:44.520]  It's just like, you know, watching TED talks, because there's some good TED talks.
[3:12:44.520 --> 3:12:50.560]  It's like, there's usually something interesting you can glean from most of them.
[3:12:50.560 --> 3:12:53.200]  There's always something, someone will say something that's interesting, and it'll be
[3:12:53.200 --> 3:12:57.280]  worth skimming through for 20 minutes on double speed or whatever.
[3:12:57.280 --> 3:13:07.000]  But just the it's the sort of Reddit, Reddit atheist science, scientism, like taking, taking
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:14.000]  all of all of human knowledge and all of the scientific method, balling it up into this
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:25.360]  like cool little robot guy and say, for science of Eureka and like fetishizing and like people
[3:13:25.360 --> 3:13:31.920]  who have people who don't have the ability to go through a scientific paper, not saying
[3:13:31.920 --> 3:13:37.600]  I have that ability either, but people who just have no understanding and they look at
[3:13:37.600 --> 3:13:44.120]  these like gleaming, the promise of gleaming rockets and the promise of tasty vaccines
[3:13:44.120 --> 3:13:49.000]  and thinking that like, this is this is the new God or something like that.
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:52.800]  And that's sort of the the the vibe that I got from TED talks, I think the guy that
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:57.840]  organizes TED talks, I forget what his name is, it's some slightly fruity, fruity sounding
[3:13:57.840 --> 3:14:00.040]  name Christophorus, something like that.
[3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:05.680]  But he comes on stage with like an Asian style, no, no collar shirt.
[3:14:05.680 --> 3:14:09.440]  And when he whenever he does make a villain shirt, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[3:14:09.440 --> 3:14:12.440]  And when he makes an appearance on stage, when the when the TED talk is interesting
[3:14:12.440 --> 3:14:16.840]  enough and important enough and high level enough for him to come on stage and like thank
[3:14:16.840 --> 3:14:22.360]  the person, he's always like very, he's got this like, weird kind of air of humility,
[3:14:22.360 --> 3:14:26.360]  like he's talking to the Pope or something like he'll come up and like, take, take, shake
[3:14:26.360 --> 3:14:30.760]  the hand like it's a precious, this is the most precious handshow you are.
[3:14:30.760 --> 3:14:35.240]  You are a prophet, you are leading us in the new, the new way, that kind of thing.
[3:14:35.240 --> 3:14:41.520]  So I just, I just thought it was a sphere that was ripe for some kind of prank like
[3:14:41.520 --> 3:14:42.520]  that.
[3:14:42.520 --> 3:14:45.920]  I know to be fair, what I did was a TEDx talk, it wasn't a TED talk, so it was less
[3:14:45.920 --> 3:14:49.520]  thoroughly vetted, but I think I got the point across.
[3:14:49.520 --> 3:14:50.520]  It still worked.
[3:14:50.520 --> 3:14:51.520]  Yeah.
[3:14:51.520 --> 3:14:57.240]  I mean, and this was, this was not that long ago, you're the sort of the beefy, somebody
[3:14:57.240 --> 3:15:00.360]  said you look like I built Leon Trotsky.
[3:15:00.360 --> 3:15:05.520]  So you were already the both Leon Trotsky, Sam Hyde there at that point, but thank you
[3:15:05.520 --> 3:15:06.520]  for saying that.
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:10.240]  You had million dollar, you had million dollar extreme, do you want to get into the drama
[3:15:10.240 --> 3:15:15.240]  of the cancellation because you were like the pioneer of the de-platforming cancel culture
[3:15:15.240 --> 3:15:16.960]  stuff for comedy.
[3:15:16.960 --> 3:15:20.720]  You were before the media stuff, the alt media and all that.
[3:15:20.720 --> 3:15:21.720]  They went for comedy.
[3:15:21.720 --> 3:15:22.720]  They went for you.
[3:15:22.720 --> 3:15:23.720]  Yeah.
[3:15:23.720 --> 3:15:29.640]  Well, I think the thing, the key thing that sort of set us, set us up for targeting is
[3:15:29.640 --> 3:15:36.000]  we were kind of like the last remaining, not like white power, but like white, group of
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:47.240]  white guys not acting like fruity little apologizing, the way that other white guys in entertainment
[3:15:47.240 --> 3:15:50.400]  sort of have to act, you know what I mean?
[3:15:50.400 --> 3:15:57.920]  And it was just very strong and unapologetic and high octane, and I think it was, I understand
[3:15:57.920 --> 3:16:02.160]  why it was threatening, especially with the Jews rock sketch.
[3:16:02.160 --> 3:16:05.640]  I can see why they took issue with that.
[3:16:05.640 --> 3:16:07.640]  Yeah.
[3:16:07.640 --> 3:16:14.920]  And you guys had high ratings, I think you had like a million or two in the regular.
[3:16:14.920 --> 3:16:15.920]  Yeah.
[3:16:15.920 --> 3:16:20.840]  We broke a million views on the, I think the first and last episodes, we were like number
[3:16:20.840 --> 3:16:25.360]  two for not just adult swim, but for, which wouldn't be that impressive, but for like
[3:16:25.360 --> 3:16:30.120]  late night cable, I forget what the rankings were, but we killed it.
[3:16:30.120 --> 3:16:35.720]  And the creative head of the network, Mike Lazo, he said, he said, we're going to shoot
[3:16:35.720 --> 3:16:37.400]  a hundred more episodes.
[3:16:37.400 --> 3:16:40.760]  You guys are the next Tim and Eric, we're going to do a hundred more episodes.
[3:16:40.760 --> 3:16:43.760]  He was, everyone was stoked on it.
[3:16:43.760 --> 3:16:50.960]  And you had basically just a couple blue check marks with what, five, 10 followers and retweets
[3:16:50.960 --> 3:16:55.680]  simply send out a few emails and everyone just collapsed and capitulated.
[3:16:55.680 --> 3:16:56.680]  Yeah.
[3:16:56.680 --> 3:17:03.480]  It was, it was, I think probably what did it was Bernstein directly getting in contact
[3:17:03.480 --> 3:17:09.680]  with what's the guy, Jeff Zucker, the guy that runs, whatever, what's Turner?
[3:17:09.680 --> 3:17:10.680]  What's above Turner?
[3:17:10.680 --> 3:17:11.680]  Yeah.
[3:17:11.680 --> 3:17:12.680]  I don't know.
[3:17:12.680 --> 3:17:13.680]  Yeah.
[3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:20.480]  It was the Buzzfeed dude directly emailing the top Yarmulke at the network.
[3:17:20.480 --> 3:17:25.560]  Getting us yanked, did offense.
[3:17:25.560 --> 3:17:32.040]  Did you, there was a, there's a phone call where you had a conversation with that guy.
[3:17:32.040 --> 3:17:33.520]  That was pretty, pretty funny.
[3:17:33.520 --> 3:17:36.760]  But, and you never did characterize yourself as all right.
[3:17:36.760 --> 3:17:40.680]  It was just sort of this label that then they paced on whoever they want to.
[3:17:40.680 --> 3:17:44.560]  The social engineers bet on you not having a memory more than anything.
[3:17:44.560 --> 3:17:48.640]  And they also bet as they constantly talk about it in their own words, that you will
[3:17:48.640 --> 3:17:53.380]  adapt to being a slave that you will learn incrementally to submit.
[3:17:53.380 --> 3:17:57.320]  So think about and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud.
[3:17:57.320 --> 3:18:00.520]  Remember that everything he said has been a premeditated lie.
[3:18:00.520 --> 3:18:02.360]  They lied about where it came from.
[3:18:02.360 --> 3:18:07.040]  They lied about person to person, the UN covered it all up, then exaggerated the death rate
[3:18:07.040 --> 3:18:08.040]  at 4%.
[3:18:08.040 --> 3:18:15.320]  When it's actually 0.032 now and dropping, then they set the test up to count almost
[3:18:15.320 --> 3:18:16.800]  all false positives.
[3:18:16.800 --> 3:18:20.760]  They put the names of people that died of other diseases in the COVID column.
[3:18:20.760 --> 3:18:22.680]  They only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown.
[3:18:22.680 --> 3:18:24.160]  Now we're six months later.
[3:18:24.160 --> 3:18:25.760]  Now they say it's permanent.
[3:18:25.760 --> 3:18:29.440]  You got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations are coming and they're going to track everywhere
[3:18:29.440 --> 3:18:33.520]  you go and what you do, the global social credit score and the UN is the boss and anybody
[3:18:33.520 --> 3:18:36.920]  questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job.
[3:18:36.920 --> 3:18:38.560]  That's called 21st century tyranny.
[3:18:38.560 --> 3:18:45.080]  That's called world government takeover Nancy Pelosi, Eric Holder, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton
[3:18:45.080 --> 3:18:49.720]  and the list goes on from there, have all gone on national TV, have all gone on the
[3:18:49.720 --> 3:18:54.760]  internet and have been in the pages of the New York Times, that they're wargaming contesting
[3:18:54.760 --> 3:18:57.960]  the election when they lose, they know there's a landslide.
[3:18:57.960 --> 3:19:03.480]  If they're unable to steal it, they're planning to contest it and have Democrat blue states
[3:19:03.480 --> 3:19:08.960]  secede and hold their own treasonous inauguration for Joe Biden and the other public Kamala
[3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:09.960]  Harris.
[3:19:09.960 --> 3:19:14.800]  This has now been announced and they're going to use race war and rioting as the cover
[3:19:14.800 --> 3:19:17.360]  to try to drive Trump from office.
[3:19:17.360 --> 3:19:21.920]  The Democratic Party, the chai comms, the deep state are using Black Lives Matter funded
[3:19:21.920 --> 3:19:28.040]  by Soros as their cover to claim that if you resist their attempts at creating artificial
[3:19:28.040 --> 3:19:33.520]  riots and martial law, that you're racist when in truth an old Nazi collaborator George
[3:19:33.520 --> 3:19:38.360]  Soros created Black Lives Matter along with Antifa, America's fighting for its life but
[3:19:38.360 --> 3:19:39.360]  we will win.
[3:19:39.360 --> 3:19:45.400]  Well, we're six months into the COVID-19 lockdown and now Democrat leaders are calling for people
[3:19:45.400 --> 3:19:49.560]  to be charged with attempted murder if they don't wear the mask of the symbols of slavery
[3:19:49.560 --> 3:19:54.560]  and they've triggered their race riots around the country led by white, angry, liberal academics
[3:19:54.560 --> 3:19:58.840]  and others and now on top of the Democrats are officially saying, hey, Trump's going
[3:19:58.840 --> 3:20:02.680]  to try to steal the election and contest it but then their internal wargaming documents
[3:20:02.680 --> 3:20:07.760]  come out with John Podesta at the very top with Kamala Harris and of course Joe Biden
[3:20:07.760 --> 3:20:11.760]  and they're saying, oh, we think we're going to lose but we're going to have the Democrat
[3:20:11.760 --> 3:20:16.640]  state secede claiming that Joe Biden's won the popular vote and we are then going to
[3:20:16.640 --> 3:20:19.720]  set up our own country and ask the military to remove Trump.
[3:20:19.720 --> 3:20:23.440]  This is officially in the New York Times and I don't just believe the New York Times.
[3:20:23.440 --> 3:20:26.920]  I've been telling you for over a year this is their plan from other statements they've
[3:20:26.920 --> 3:20:31.840]  made and then Atlantic Monthly, the Washington Post, the Financial Times of London, the Council
[3:20:31.840 --> 3:20:32.840]  on Farm Relations.
[3:20:32.840 --> 3:20:33.840]  This is their plan.
[3:20:33.840 --> 3:20:35.640]  We've got 80 days left to stop it.
[3:20:35.640 --> 3:20:36.640]  What are you going to do?
[3:20:36.640 --> 3:20:37.640]  I'm serious, folks.
[3:20:37.640 --> 3:20:43.800]  This is the time to save the country.
[3:20:43.800 --> 3:20:55.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:55.200 --> 3:21:03.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:03.920 --> 3:21:06.880]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of jasonalsons.com.
[3:21:06.880 --> 3:21:14.280]  I have this beautiful fashion bag that I often shop with and wear as I walk across campuses
[3:21:14.280 --> 3:21:17.240]  and it's this beautiful face.
[3:21:17.240 --> 3:21:19.240]  Is this mama hide?
[3:21:19.240 --> 3:21:20.240]  Is that mama hide or who?
[3:21:20.240 --> 3:21:21.240]  Is that you?
[3:21:21.240 --> 3:21:22.240]  Is that you?
[3:21:22.240 --> 3:21:28.520]  Well, that's me at a moment of high bloat and probably high estrogen as well.
[3:21:28.520 --> 3:21:33.880]  So if you want to call that mama hide, you're welcome to and I do resemble my mom in that.
[3:21:33.880 --> 3:21:34.880]  Yeah.
[3:21:34.880 --> 3:21:35.880]  Thank you.
[3:21:35.880 --> 3:21:37.080]  I was asking about the alt right thing.
[3:21:37.080 --> 3:21:43.000]  I think alt right is one of these terms that's so it's such a linguistic weapon.
[3:21:43.000 --> 3:21:47.440]  It's like the word Nazi where it kind of it kind of takes on the meaning of whatever
[3:21:47.440 --> 3:21:49.920]  the person throwing it out means.
[3:21:49.920 --> 3:21:53.640]  I don't think it's I don't think it's unfair to say that I'm alt right.
[3:21:53.640 --> 3:21:58.800]  I definitely think that white people should have some sense of identity and should stop
[3:21:58.800 --> 3:22:04.720]  being such pussies and that we should stop pretending like like race isn't real.
[3:22:04.720 --> 3:22:09.760]  I don't have any sort of hatred.
[3:22:09.760 --> 3:22:14.160]  So I think I think the one thing that was the place they took it with was they said
[3:22:14.160 --> 3:22:17.040]  that picture is crazy.
[3:22:17.040 --> 3:22:21.280]  The place they went with it was they said that there was that we had swastikas in the
[3:22:21.280 --> 3:22:23.560]  graphics for the show.
[3:22:23.560 --> 3:22:25.560]  The graphics for the show.
[3:22:25.560 --> 3:22:26.560]  I worked on those.
[3:22:26.560 --> 3:22:30.040]  I put blood, sweat and tears into those graphics.
[3:22:30.040 --> 3:22:37.480]  They were some of the best work I've ever done and we were forced to censor them completely
[3:22:37.480 --> 3:22:41.160]  including the logo for the show.
[3:22:41.160 --> 3:22:45.920]  So you can only really see the final versions by looking at my upload of them on YouTube
[3:22:45.920 --> 3:22:52.200]  and there are no swastikas in any of the graphics for the show.
[3:22:52.200 --> 3:22:56.320]  So that's the one kind of funny, funny claim they made.
[3:22:56.320 --> 3:23:03.560]  I deconstruct films and symbolism and I will point out squares and compasses and esoteric
[3:23:03.560 --> 3:23:07.280]  masonic symbols and film and then these people will say you're crazy or a lunatic, it doesn't
[3:23:07.280 --> 3:23:08.280]  exist.
[3:23:08.280 --> 3:23:14.360]  However, for you, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[3:23:14.360 --> 3:23:19.600]  Symbolism suddenly becomes very real when it's directed at them.
[3:23:19.600 --> 3:23:25.280]  But the one thing we did was we used the James Holmes shooter logo in the main in the main
[3:23:25.280 --> 3:23:26.440]  world peace logo.
[3:23:26.440 --> 3:23:27.440]  That is true.
[3:23:27.440 --> 3:23:29.640]  As you can see, what is the meaning of life?
[3:23:29.640 --> 3:23:31.840]  What is the meaning of death?
[3:23:31.840 --> 3:23:36.480]  And the reason for that is this is like high level serious satire.
[3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:38.920]  And of course, you know, Sarah Silverman, she can get away with it.
[3:23:38.920 --> 3:23:41.600]  She can make jokes about whatever she wants to.
[3:23:41.600 --> 3:23:43.800]  But you know, just subtle things, right?
[3:23:43.800 --> 3:23:49.200]  I mean, you have undergone a very bizarre situation where a meme of you and I think you were probably
[3:23:49.200 --> 3:23:54.760]  like the first comedian to really become a meme and then the meme takes on a life of
[3:23:54.760 --> 3:23:55.760]  its own.
[3:23:55.760 --> 3:23:59.040]  What was that experience like?
[3:23:59.040 --> 3:24:04.960]  It's not as not as shocking as some people think it really doesn't affect affect my life
[3:24:04.960 --> 3:24:05.960]  all that much.
[3:24:05.960 --> 3:24:09.800]  These shooter memes, I have gotten a few visits from the FBI, but there have always been.
[3:24:09.800 --> 3:24:14.880]  I explained to them how how computers work and I explained to them that it's possible
[3:24:14.880 --> 3:24:18.200]  to make a to make a Facebook account with someone else's name.
[3:24:18.200 --> 3:24:22.120]  And then they usually they usually stand down not to mention the fact that I tower over them
[3:24:22.120 --> 3:24:25.440]  and physically dominate them and intimidate them in our interactions.
[3:24:25.440 --> 3:24:31.640]  So yeah, we got this buff guy here looks like Leon Trotsky is again, like you got like
[3:24:31.640 --> 3:24:38.320]  the first time they sent this guy that was looked like Colombo, like he was he actually
[3:24:38.320 --> 3:24:45.160]  struck me as a sharp, sharp guy, but he was like a little guy in the second, the second
[3:24:45.160 --> 3:24:50.440]  time they sent two big dudes that I was still bigger than and I still was standing there
[3:24:50.440 --> 3:24:52.680]  flexing as I answered their questions.
[3:24:52.680 --> 3:24:56.800]  Let me can I can I give some shout outs, Jay, before I forget here?
[3:24:56.800 --> 3:24:59.120]  Yeah, nice shots people.
[3:24:59.120 --> 3:25:00.680]  Shout out to Frank Hassel.
[3:25:00.680 --> 3:25:01.680]  Check him out on YouTube.

[3:25:10.560 --> 3:25:11.560]  short list.

[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:20.960]  wrecking ball, camp bot and wrecking ball.

[3:25:21.960 --> 3:25:22.960]  Let's keep going here.
[3:25:22.960 --> 3:25:23.960]  What else?
[3:25:23.960 --> 3:25:24.960]  What else we got to talk about?
[3:25:24.960 --> 3:25:28.000]  So about the great reset because this whole side you have, have you heard of this happy
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:29.000]  to listen thing?
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:34.680]  This this like gay version of hap of capitalism, even more gay or where it's like now we're
[3:25:34.680 --> 3:25:39.480]  going to focus on on an economics of making people happy.
[3:25:39.480 --> 3:25:45.200]  The UN is going to replace individual entrepreneurs and you're going to be awesome.
[3:25:45.200 --> 3:25:49.760]  Yeah, doesn't that sound good and this fits into this great reset where they're going
[3:25:49.760 --> 3:25:56.880]  to replace like owning stuff with, with a circular sharing economy.
[3:25:56.880 --> 3:25:57.880]  That's what they want to bring.
[3:25:57.880 --> 3:26:02.640]  Has anyone, Jay, has anyone coined the term circle jerk economy yet?
[3:26:02.640 --> 3:26:05.080]  Can we start using that?
[3:26:05.080 --> 3:26:06.600]  Where it goes apparently.
[3:26:06.600 --> 3:26:07.600]  Okay.
[3:26:07.600 --> 3:26:09.880]  No, that sounds fun.
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:13.760]  So you rent your stuff and you kind of like share the land and stuff like that.
[3:26:13.760 --> 3:26:15.320]  That's how it works.
[3:26:15.320 --> 3:26:16.320]  Yeah.
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:17.320]  You want to have a car?
[3:26:17.320 --> 3:26:18.320]  I didn't need it anyway.
[3:26:18.320 --> 3:26:19.320]  I didn't want it anyway.
[3:26:19.320 --> 3:26:23.240]  I want, I want to, as long as the, as long as the car that I'm renting can somehow benefit
[3:26:23.240 --> 3:26:28.040]  the impoverished people that throw glass outside my building and make it so that I have to
[3:26:28.040 --> 3:26:30.600]  get new tires and new windows every couple of months.
[3:26:30.600 --> 3:26:32.000]  As long as it can benefit them somehow.
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:33.000]  I'm happy for that.
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:34.000]  I love it.
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:35.000]  Yeah.
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:41.600]  I bring this up because, you know, we, we know you, you're a fan of step on course
[3:26:41.600 --> 3:26:44.000]  stuff on just got the platform.
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:47.120]  And one thing that you talk about in some of your videos, it's actually pretty practical
[3:26:47.120 --> 3:26:53.080]  I wanted to get to because you do have some good videos that are advice to young guys.
[3:26:53.080 --> 3:26:55.720]  And if you want to mention some of that, cause those are pretty popular as well.
[3:26:55.720 --> 3:26:59.640]  If you want to, what's some, what's the advice you give to young dudes?
[3:26:59.640 --> 3:27:06.480]  Well step one is, um, get you some of these, some of these right here estrogen blockers.
[3:27:06.480 --> 3:27:07.480]  Okay.
[3:27:07.480 --> 3:27:08.480]  You might need some of those.
[3:27:08.480 --> 3:27:13.840]  Dude, I was so, I was so lost because I had a, uh, my father wasn't like negligent or
[3:27:13.840 --> 3:27:20.160]  anything, but he just wasn't like, he wasn't a man in the sense of like, um, of, you know,
[3:27:20.160 --> 3:27:21.720]  the sense that we would, we would use it.
[3:27:21.720 --> 3:27:26.480]  And there's such a, there's such a, uh, lack of masculinity nowadays and an absence of male
[3:27:26.480 --> 3:27:32.720]  role models and, um, it's, uh, it's a crazy, crazy looking landscape.
[3:27:32.720 --> 3:27:38.560]  And that's why I think, um, people like, uh, Stefan, Stefan gets a lot of, um, uh, a lot
[3:27:38.560 --> 3:27:42.760]  of people beefing with him for being a cultie and dogmatic and, and whatnot.
[3:27:42.760 --> 3:27:47.840]  And, um, there's people that, uh, want to pick bones with, uh, Jordan Peterson over
[3:27:47.840 --> 3:27:53.200]  being kind of basic, can I say the B word, basic bitch, is that allowed people?
[3:27:53.200 --> 3:27:56.560]  People think, you know, Jordan Peterson is kind of a basic bitch guy and he's also,
[3:27:56.560 --> 3:27:59.400]  you know, whatever, whatever weakness with the painkillers and whatnot.
[3:27:59.400 --> 3:28:05.960]  But I think it's, it's so important for, um, to find male role models and try to emulate
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:11.280]  them or figure out, you know, get the, get the old wisdom, the wisdom of old and, uh,
[3:28:11.280 --> 3:28:12.280]  bring that into your own life.
[3:28:12.280 --> 3:28:13.360]  Cause it still applies.
[3:28:13.360 --> 3:28:15.960]  We're still in, we're still in a battle.
[3:28:15.960 --> 3:28:18.520]  It's a, in info war, it's a battle for the mind.
[3:28:18.520 --> 3:28:24.480]  It's not a, uh, a bloody trench warfare battle, but we're in, we're in a battle for the soul
[3:28:24.480 --> 3:28:25.680]  of humanity right now.
[3:28:25.680 --> 3:28:30.840]  So you better start acting like it and get some of that, uh, some of that old Sun Sue
[3:28:30.840 --> 3:28:31.840]  wisdom.
[3:28:31.840 --> 3:28:32.840]  Yeah.
[3:28:32.840 --> 3:28:37.680]  I remember when I was, uh, mired in student debt, uh, back in my twenties and I was listening
[3:28:37.680 --> 3:28:41.520]  to Alex, I listened to stuff on at the time and they were always talking about being an
[3:28:41.520 --> 3:28:45.720]  entrepreneur and I kind of had in my mind that you can't start your own business.
[3:28:45.720 --> 3:28:49.080]  That's for some other weird CEO dude in Silicon Valley or something.
[3:28:49.080 --> 3:28:52.400]  And then finally I just sort of broke and was like, I'm just going to try out of mine
[3:28:52.400 --> 3:28:53.400]  as well.
[3:28:53.400 --> 3:28:56.200]  Or try that than be a wage slave.
[3:28:56.200 --> 3:28:57.800]  And I ended up having some success.
[3:28:57.800 --> 3:29:01.520]  And so I think there's a lot of wisdom in trying to, to get young guys to think about
[3:29:01.520 --> 3:29:04.000]  being an entrepreneur and you promote that a lot.
[3:29:04.000 --> 3:29:06.960]  I really appreciate that, appreciate that about what you talk about.
[3:29:06.960 --> 3:29:12.080]  Um, it's getting harder with the tech stuff, but, but you've been successful still.
[3:29:12.080 --> 3:29:13.680]  I got, I got something important here, Jay.
[3:29:13.680 --> 3:29:19.120]  The, um, the only real resource young, young men nowadays are so destroyed.
[3:29:19.120 --> 3:29:21.280]  They have their hormones are f'd up.
[3:29:21.280 --> 3:29:23.280]  They have, uh, you know, no money.
[3:29:23.280 --> 3:29:26.880]  Everybody, anybody I talk to that hits me up on Instagram or whatever.
[3:29:26.880 --> 3:29:29.120]  I'm like, first thing I ask is how much money do you have saved up?
[3:29:29.120 --> 3:29:34.440]  They have $200 like nobody has, nobody has nothing, nobody has any skills, et cetera.
[3:29:34.440 --> 3:29:37.600]  The only thing young people have now is time.
[3:29:37.600 --> 3:29:47.080]  Time is this, um, it's, it's cliched to say what a golden important vital resource, precious
[3:29:47.080 --> 3:29:48.960]  resource it is, but it's also true.
[3:29:48.960 --> 3:29:51.260]  You can't overstate the importance of time.
[3:29:51.260 --> 3:29:56.520]  So going into, um, going into, into business, being an entrepreneur or whatever, or find
[3:29:56.520 --> 3:30:01.600]  getting some sort of skill, like, uh, taking, taking your time and trading it, trading it
[3:30:01.600 --> 3:30:05.400]  to somebody else for, uh, barely over minimum wage.
[3:30:05.400 --> 3:30:09.640]  And if it's, if it's not getting you skills, if it's not advancing what you want to do
[3:30:09.640 --> 3:30:14.560]  for yourself in the world, it's, it's, uh, it's such a colossal waste.
[3:30:14.560 --> 3:30:18.200]  When you think about that, if you, if you're working at Target, if you work at Petco, if
[3:30:18.200 --> 3:30:24.680]  you work some, uh, ass job like that, you should imagine yourself on a, on a wooden
[3:30:24.680 --> 3:30:29.120]  stakes, like an old witch burning and imagines, just know that that's what you're doing with
[3:30:29.120 --> 3:30:32.520]  your, your, your vital essence with what you've been given.
[3:30:32.520 --> 3:30:37.640]  If you work it, if you work a day job, you are burning everything is that, are you like
[3:30:37.640 --> 3:30:39.640]  that?
[3:30:39.640 --> 3:30:45.520]  This is a maximum alert, a maximum alert as of taping this alert, you're 82 days out
[3:30:45.520 --> 3:30:46.520]  from the election.
[3:30:46.520 --> 3:30:51.200]  As many of you know in the last year, I pointed out statements out of the council on foreign
[3:30:51.200 --> 3:30:56.440]  relations and other globalist organs that they know Trump is going to win in a landslide.
[3:30:56.440 --> 3:30:59.440]  So their strategy will be to contest the election.
[3:30:59.440 --> 3:31:04.720]  If they fail to successfully steal it, then they are openly now wargaming, this is in
[3:31:04.720 --> 3:31:10.040]  the New York times, having democratic states and cities secede from the union, just like
[3:31:10.040 --> 3:31:14.480]  they've ignored Trump's policies and coronavirus and kept their areas locked down.
[3:31:14.480 --> 3:31:16.840]  There's nothing but a dress rehearsal.
[3:31:16.840 --> 3:31:20.600]  They are saying they're going to have their own separate inauguration, not in DC.
[3:31:20.600 --> 3:31:27.480]  They said in another city, Pelosi has said this, when they crown Biden and Kamala Harris.
[3:31:27.480 --> 3:31:31.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the organized civil war.
[3:31:31.080 --> 3:31:33.280]  This is their public criminal plan.
[3:31:33.280 --> 3:31:36.760]  We should be praying, we should be spreading the word, we should be demanding Trump won
[3:31:36.760 --> 3:31:44.520]  the offense to expose this criminal activity.
[3:31:44.520 --> 3:31:46.520]  You hear that?
[3:31:46.520 --> 3:31:52.480]  That's the march of the United Nations and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation coming
[3:31:52.480 --> 3:31:58.720]  with their battle plan, psychological warfare operation with the forced inoculations and
[3:31:58.720 --> 3:32:02.640]  the permanent lockdown of civilization and society.
[3:32:02.640 --> 3:32:06.160]  They're outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu.
[3:32:06.160 --> 3:32:09.280]  They're creating artificial phobias for normal death that takes place.
[3:32:09.280 --> 3:32:11.960]  They're not even promising to have a cure to it all.
[3:32:11.960 --> 3:32:17.200]  They're just inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary regime directed
[3:32:17.200 --> 3:32:25.880]  by the WHO with vaccines that actually change your DNA and make you owned by Microsoft.
[3:32:25.880 --> 3:32:28.240]  It's a final frontier.
[3:32:28.240 --> 3:32:30.920]  It's the year 2020.
[3:32:30.920 --> 3:32:33.040]  It's not coming.
[3:32:33.040 --> 3:32:34.040]  It's here.
[3:32:34.040 --> 3:32:41.360]  And submission is blood in the water.
[3:32:41.360 --> 3:32:44.600]  I'm cutting this ad on Wednesday, August 12, 2025.
[3:32:44.600 --> 3:32:49.160]  By this coming Sunday, this huge sale we've been running for last week will have to end.
[3:32:49.160 --> 3:32:56.640]  The reopened America back to school special 50% off to 60% off all of our top bestsellers
[3:32:56.640 --> 3:32:59.040]  and double pay three at points.
[3:32:59.040 --> 3:33:04.480]  I have to end the sale because we're selling out of bodies at 50% off, living defense at
[3:33:04.480 --> 3:33:09.080]  50% off, bad zombie at 50% off, turbo portion at 50% off, bottom end, low teeth at 50% off.
[3:33:09.080 --> 3:33:11.080]  Those are all very close to selling out.
[3:33:11.080 --> 3:33:16.080]  A bunch of other bestsellers we still have, but I will end this special on Sunday.
[3:33:16.080 --> 3:33:22.360]  We'll have a new great special coming up next week, but it's not as extensive or expansive
[3:33:22.360 --> 3:33:23.360]  as the original.
[3:33:23.360 --> 3:33:24.360]  We'll be back at stock.
[3:33:24.360 --> 3:33:27.120]  It will be discounted, but it's not available yet.
[3:33:27.120 --> 3:33:31.760]  So this is a great sale, it funds the operation, they're great items, in crazy times like this
[3:33:31.760 --> 3:33:35.800]  it's good to stock up, but whatever you do, keep spread the word about InfoWars because
[3:33:35.800 --> 3:33:40.200]  you are the modern voice, you are Paul Revere and I salute you and thank you.
[3:33:40.200 --> 3:33:45.400]  Attention, attention, attention to anyone that still wants to live in a free country.
[3:33:45.400 --> 3:33:50.920]  The New World Order, CHICOM Globalist Syndicate is making its move to implode the dollar and
[3:33:50.920 --> 3:33:55.200]  thrust the United States into a civil war by contesting the election.
[3:33:55.200 --> 3:33:59.640]  They are openly work ending this at the highest levels of the Democratic Party, Nancy Pelosi
[3:33:59.640 --> 3:34:04.360]  and others have gone on television and said they will contest the election, Trump is going,
[3:34:04.360 --> 3:34:09.880]  they will hold a separate inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris, and that anyone challenging
[3:34:09.880 --> 3:34:11.400]  that will be called a racist.
[3:34:11.400 --> 3:34:13.920]  They will then trigger race riots and violence.
[3:34:13.920 --> 3:34:19.720]  They've already beta tested around the country, but you're not living in normal times.
[3:34:19.720 --> 3:34:23.120]  When these type of things happen in history, people are usually caught flat footed because
[3:34:23.120 --> 3:34:27.160]  they can't believe that they're living in such a criminal era.
[3:34:27.160 --> 3:34:28.160]  We are.
[3:34:28.160 --> 3:34:32.200]  We are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate has been feeding on America
[3:34:32.200 --> 3:34:34.280]  is being exposed and removed.
[3:34:34.280 --> 3:34:38.080]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country.
[3:34:38.080 --> 3:34:43.880]  Spread the word now, Paul Revere's.
[3:34:43.880 --> 3:35:01.760]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:35:01.760 --> 3:35:06.480]  I hear that beautiful piano music and I feel like I'm Matthew McConaughey flying my link
[3:35:06.480 --> 3:35:10.680]  and I've been to space because I think that's the I think that's that I think that's that
[3:35:10.680 --> 3:35:15.680]  beautiful music from that weird creepy movie interstellar that's also she's a bunch of
[3:35:15.680 --> 3:35:16.680]  it's a bunch of mass.
[3:35:16.680 --> 3:35:17.680]  Excuse me.
[3:35:17.680 --> 3:35:18.680]  I'm sorry.
[3:35:18.680 --> 3:35:21.160]  I went into I went into Matthew mode and I messed up there.
[3:35:21.160 --> 3:35:22.160]  Sam Hyde.
[3:35:22.160 --> 3:35:24.400]  He's with me here on the on show.
[3:35:24.400 --> 3:35:25.400]  Welcome back.
[3:35:25.400 --> 3:35:26.400]  Sam.
[3:35:26.400 --> 3:35:28.760]  We were talking about men.
[3:35:28.760 --> 3:35:30.320]  What it is to be a man.
[3:35:30.320 --> 3:35:33.080]  You say things like simple stuff.
[3:35:33.080 --> 3:35:39.800]  Lift weights, get a skill, get a trade, get it going, go crazy, become insane, become
[3:35:39.800 --> 3:35:42.160]  desperate, go out in the streets.
[3:35:42.160 --> 3:35:43.160]  I can't say that.
[3:35:43.160 --> 3:35:44.160]  Okay.
[3:35:44.160 --> 3:35:45.160]  Right.
[3:35:45.160 --> 3:35:46.160]  Are you crazy?
[3:35:46.160 --> 3:35:47.160]  I can't say that.
[3:35:47.160 --> 3:35:51.840]  Um, no, I think, uh, when you first when you first start getting woke, when you first
[3:35:51.840 --> 3:35:58.000]  start learning that the, um, the world is this sick hall of mirrors, uh, it's, it's tempting
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:05.520]  to get, um, fee feverishly caught up in the various little plots and schemes and, uh,
[3:36:05.520 --> 3:36:09.280]  attempt to unravel the unravel them, which is, which is important work, but I think a
[3:36:09.280 --> 3:36:13.920]  lot of people get overwhelmed by that and they get sort of, uh, sort of fatalistic and
[3:36:13.920 --> 3:36:16.280]  blackpilled as they say.
[3:36:16.280 --> 3:36:21.400]  And I think, um, for anyone who ever, ever gets blackpilled or overwhelmed or, or, uh,
[3:36:21.400 --> 3:36:23.280]  whatever, yeah, pay, pay silver, right?
[3:36:23.280 --> 3:36:24.520]  Sylvia right there.
[3:36:24.520 --> 3:36:29.360]  Um, I think it's, it's one of the most radical things you can do is take ownership over your
[3:36:29.360 --> 3:36:35.840]  own little circle, your own, uh, you know, yourself, your family, your friends becoming,
[3:36:35.840 --> 3:36:39.240]  uh, treating, treating that like it's this world problem.
[3:36:39.240 --> 3:36:45.880]  That you want to solve and, uh, step, step one to that is, um, learning about masculinity
[3:36:45.880 --> 3:36:52.120]  and getting, um, that's, that's why people like Stefan Molyneux and, uh, Jordan Peterson
[3:36:52.120 --> 3:36:57.080]  are so attacked, even though none of what they say is really, you know, insane or, or
[3:36:57.080 --> 3:36:58.680]  racist or, or what have you.
[3:36:58.680 --> 3:37:04.120]  It's just, uh, what, what they're saying is, uh, radical because it's, it's effective
[3:37:04.120 --> 3:37:06.680]  potentially in, uh, fixing the world.
[3:37:06.680 --> 3:37:13.920]  I think people need to, uh, just get that, you know, get that masculinity homie.
[3:37:13.920 --> 3:37:18.040]  Do you feel like comedy is like, is it dead now?
[3:37:18.040 --> 3:37:25.720]  I mean, I remember 10 years ago, I would, I would watch Mitch Hedberg and comedians.
[3:37:25.720 --> 3:37:26.960]  I thought, oh yeah, stand up.
[3:37:26.960 --> 3:37:27.960]  It's, it's kind of funny.
[3:37:27.960 --> 3:37:33.920]  And then it's like in the last 10 years standup is almost itself another vehicle for social
[3:37:33.920 --> 3:37:34.920]  justice.
[3:37:34.920 --> 3:37:40.600]  You know, these Hannah, Hannah, what's her name, trans, comedian, and she's just propped
[3:37:40.600 --> 3:37:50.200]  up because of like some weird, you know, fixation that even, even big ones, even great ones.
[3:37:50.200 --> 3:37:52.840]  Um, is that a man right there that we're looking at?
[3:37:52.840 --> 3:37:54.640]  I thought that was a lesbian.
[3:37:54.640 --> 3:37:59.240]  Well, if you became Samantha Hyde, then you would probably be welcomed back.
[3:37:59.240 --> 3:38:00.240]  Right.
[3:38:00.240 --> 3:38:03.760]  If you do that person is so disturbing to look at, I probably would.
[3:38:03.760 --> 3:38:04.920]  That's a good tactic right there.
[3:38:04.920 --> 3:38:10.480]  I tried, I tried to be black, but nobody's, nobody, I didn't take enough mellotone in
[3:38:10.480 --> 3:38:15.000]  or mellotan to convince people, um, you know, comedy, comedy is dead.
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:20.560]  I mean, for comedy to be, for comedy to be an art form that's like worthwhile, it has
[3:38:20.560 --> 3:38:21.920]  to, it has to be subversive.
[3:38:21.920 --> 3:38:23.760]  It has to be the underdog.
[3:38:23.760 --> 3:38:31.040]  It has to be, um, the voice, the voice of truth, of truth that's like uncomfortable
[3:38:31.040 --> 3:38:32.040]  to speak.
[3:38:32.040 --> 3:38:37.880]  You know, the, the version of truth that's uncomfortable to speak is, uh, uh, F Trump.
[3:38:37.880 --> 3:38:39.640]  You know what I mean?
[3:38:39.640 --> 3:38:44.320]  In one way or another, it's whether it's, it availed in a sophisticated way or whether
[3:38:44.320 --> 3:38:49.600]  it's just straight up, uh, look at Donald Trump, he's so fat, he's got no penis.
[3:38:49.600 --> 3:38:53.800]  He must have a short penis or whether it's something more sophisticated, like, like,
[3:38:53.800 --> 3:38:59.800]  uh, some of the stuff that Dave Chappelle has done recently, uh, it's, it's all F Trump
[3:38:59.800 --> 3:39:01.920]  in some way or another.
[3:39:01.920 --> 3:39:04.280]  So no, it's, it's, it's a wasteland.
[3:39:04.280 --> 3:39:05.280]  Yeah.
[3:39:05.280 --> 3:39:08.800]  It's, and there's a, there's a similar, similar parallel in journalism.
[3:39:08.800 --> 3:39:13.520]  Journalism used to be supposedly this thing that was there to keep eyes on the establishment
[3:39:13.520 --> 3:39:18.280]  and to critique and, you know, chase after stories, you know, supposedly the, we have
[3:39:18.280 --> 3:39:23.120]  this idea of journalists going after mobsters back in the fifties and they would pursue
[3:39:23.120 --> 3:39:26.280]  the truth to their own, you know, altruistic heroes.
[3:39:26.280 --> 3:39:27.280]  Yeah.
[3:39:27.280 --> 3:39:29.960]  And now, now it is the establishment.
[3:39:29.960 --> 3:39:35.400]  Now journalism, now the, the political establishment bends the knee to the, to the media, uh, a
[3:39:35.400 --> 3:39:36.400]  lot, a lot of the time.
[3:39:36.400 --> 3:39:37.760]  And now it's just a hand in hand.
[3:39:37.760 --> 3:39:44.080]  It's, it's part of the same, uh, same, uh, coctopus, same octopus right there.
[3:39:44.080 --> 3:39:49.600]  You know, do you think there's stages of the cooking of comedy, like does a big comedian
[3:39:49.600 --> 3:39:55.000]  kind of get to a certain point and then he's maybe expected to do this, this, this, to,
[3:39:55.000 --> 3:39:59.120]  to go to the next level or to keep getting the, the, the work is, is that where it's
[3:39:59.120 --> 3:40:02.520]  at, where they're all basically expected to do this?
[3:40:02.520 --> 3:40:06.600]  They made it, they made it pretty clear to me that we would have, um, one reason why
[3:40:06.600 --> 3:40:11.000]  our group kind of fractured afterwards was they made it clear to me that, uh, we would
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:16.880]  have been able to keep the show if I issued a, uh, public apology and took our, uh, subreddit
[3:40:16.880 --> 3:40:17.880]  down.
[3:40:17.880 --> 3:40:22.240]  Um, there's definitely time, there's, yeah, of course, anytime you get, it's probably
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:25.880]  this, I mean, I'm sure it's the same in any, in any field, any industry as you get, uh,
[3:40:25.880 --> 3:40:29.760]  as you get bigger, people come out of the shadowy figure, comes out of the woodwork
[3:40:29.760 --> 3:40:33.960]  and tells you, Hey, you would have to say this, just alter your message slightly.
[3:40:33.960 --> 3:40:39.040]  Um, you know, if you're, if your podcast gets bought by, uh, some company that has a lot
[3:40:39.040 --> 3:40:42.920]  of Chinese money, you're, there's probably a topic that you're going to start avoiding,
[3:40:42.920 --> 3:40:47.760]  um, because of it, you know, what's your favorite MDE sketch?
[3:40:47.760 --> 3:40:51.400]  Joe Rogan, sorry, I'm just kidding.
[3:40:51.400 --> 3:40:57.680]  We'll get to your challenge here in a minute for, for Joe Rogan, I want him, I can taste
[3:40:57.680 --> 3:40:58.680]  blood.
[3:40:58.680 --> 3:41:04.320]  Um, probably the, my favorite stuff is the, um, the stuff I did on my cell phone in my,
[3:41:04.320 --> 3:41:09.320]  uh, my mom's apartment way back in the day, because that was the most insane tormenting
[3:41:09.320 --> 3:41:11.280]  your mom is just golden.
[3:41:11.280 --> 3:41:12.280]  Yeah.
[3:41:12.280 --> 3:41:13.280]  That's awesome.
[3:41:13.280 --> 3:41:18.320]  It was, it was the most insane and desperate, desperate time of my life and, um, those
[3:41:18.320 --> 3:41:24.520]  videos, it was like the one, uh, not ray of hope, but it was like the one, the most
[3:41:24.520 --> 3:41:29.080]  joyous moments were in front of that mirror, just saying the most cracked, cracked out
[3:41:29.080 --> 3:41:31.480]  stuff that I could, uh, come up with.
[3:41:31.480 --> 3:41:35.360]  Oh, your mom's, your mom's echoing constantly.
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:36.360]  Sam.
[3:41:36.360 --> 3:41:37.360]  Yeah.
[3:41:37.360 --> 3:41:38.360]  Yeah.
[3:41:38.360 --> 3:41:39.360]  Oh my goodness.
[3:41:39.360 --> 3:41:42.480]  You just keep pushing and pushing and pushing.
[3:41:42.480 --> 3:41:43.480]  I know.
[3:41:43.480 --> 3:41:46.880]  Well, part of, part of her, it's not, it's not so much that I want to abuse my mom or
[3:41:46.880 --> 3:41:52.760]  anything. I love my mom so much. I talk to her often, but, um, her style of parenting
[3:41:52.760 --> 3:42:00.080]  was just such, uh, constant like brow beating and, um, nannying and like telling, telling
[3:42:00.080 --> 3:42:04.200]  me that my teeth were going to fall out if I, uh, you know, used them to like unscrew
[3:42:04.200 --> 3:42:09.160]  a bottle cap or something, or that I was going to burn the roof of my mouth, like hypochondriac,
[3:42:09.160 --> 3:42:12.640]  hypochondriac stuff, like to an extreme, like constant warnings.
[3:42:12.640 --> 3:42:16.960]  You're going to, you're never going to, you're going to lose your fingertips if you touch
[3:42:16.960 --> 3:42:21.240]  the, the, that thing. You're going to get electrocuted if you go down the stairs, you
[3:42:21.240 --> 3:42:23.640]  have to watch out for on the streets.
[3:42:23.640 --> 3:42:30.640]  So, so the, uh, the kind of like light, light abuse that I gave her in those videos, it
[3:42:30.640 --> 3:42:33.640]  trust me is fully warranted and, um,
[3:42:33.640 --> 3:42:36.720]  You're your mom, I'm guessing probably she's Boomer, right? There's something about the
[3:42:36.720 --> 3:42:41.360]  boomer there where they're afraid of everything, you know, like they're really afraid of everything.
[3:42:41.360 --> 3:42:46.200]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Big time. Um, she's deaf boomer, boomer to the core, boomer to the
[3:42:46.200 --> 3:42:47.200]  core.
[3:42:47.200 --> 3:42:53.840]  Now, um, you have a campaign going, let's talk about that. You have issued, you want
[3:42:53.840 --> 3:42:57.280]  to get, you want to get Rogan into the octragon.
[3:42:57.280 --> 3:43:01.440]  I've issued several threats. Uh, I've had some of my, uh, my friends from the martial
[3:43:01.440 --> 3:43:07.960]  arts world, Chuck Norris, Nick Diaz, uh, Lennox Lewis, uh, et cetera, back me up, uh,
[3:43:07.960 --> 3:43:13.120]  in real videos that they made for me, not cameos that I paid for. That's a rumor that
[3:43:13.120 --> 3:43:18.680]  I want to squash right now. There's a rumor going around that I paid a $2,500 for a Caitlyn
[3:43:18.680 --> 3:43:24.360]  Jenner cameo that, uh, was canceled, but my bank account still got charged. I'm waiting
[3:43:24.360 --> 3:43:30.640]  for the charge back on that. Um, that is, uh, that's a rumor and Lennox Lewis and, uh,
[3:43:30.640 --> 3:43:35.400]  Randy Couture did indeed come out with messages just for me because I'm in that world. I'm
[3:43:35.400 --> 3:43:40.360]  in Joe Rogan's world. I'm kind of a master of that world. I'm more, I'm more respected
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:43.920]  than Joe Rogan is. You think Lennox Lewis would make a video for Joe Rogan? I don't
[3:43:43.920 --> 3:43:48.160]  think so. Okay. The guy's a multi-multi-millionaire, best, uh, legendary heavyweight. I don't
[3:43:48.160 --> 3:43:50.720]  think he's making a video for Joe Rogan. He made one for me because I'm in that. I'm
[3:43:50.720 --> 3:43:57.000]  in the game. I'm in the game, Joe, and you're ready to, you're ready to step into that octragon.
[3:43:57.000 --> 3:44:01.920]  I'll step into the octagon with Joe. I don't care. I'll, I'll let him, uh, I'll let him
[3:44:01.920 --> 3:44:06.280]  put his pajamas on and try to, uh, try to cuddle me and roll around a punch from dead
[3:44:06.280 --> 3:44:12.280]  in his face. I don't care. I know what his strategy strategy would be to hug me and try
[3:44:12.280 --> 3:44:17.320]  to cuddle with me in pajamas for 10 minutes, try to wear me out like that. No, you're getting
[3:44:17.320 --> 3:44:20.760]  punched dead in the face, Joe. I don't care if you've got a turning sidekick. I got a
[3:44:20.760 --> 3:44:26.840]  flipping sidekick. I got a backwards around town sidekick. You haven't even seen my sidekick.
[3:44:26.840 --> 3:44:32.800]  Joe come in with a, with a team of lawyers, right? Probably 11 lawyers in the octagon.
[3:44:32.800 --> 3:44:40.440]  I'll come in with a team of Hispanic gangbangers. How about that, Joe? I got Cholos, my, my
[3:44:40.440 --> 3:44:46.440]  home, my, uh, ms 13 homies, Cezanne, Chino, compache, uh, Chico, Chachi, Chich, they'll
[3:44:46.440 --> 3:44:51.600]  all be there. And by the way, I issued a challenge to you, which you ignored, which was that
[3:44:51.600 --> 3:44:56.480]  after that, I will step into the octragon with you and you can bring butter beans or
[3:44:56.480 --> 3:45:01.800]  any of, you can bring butter bean or any of the, uh, uh, you know, washed up. I know
[3:45:01.800 --> 3:45:07.160]  you're, you're a man of, you're a man of God. I don't want to, I don't want to test my standing
[3:45:07.160 --> 3:45:11.960]  with the big man upstairs by taking on one of his, uh, great champions. I'll pass on
[3:45:11.960 --> 3:45:12.960]  that one. All right.
[3:45:12.960 --> 3:45:19.600]  All right. Well, thank you, Sam. It was great. Thanks. Thanks a lot, man, for having me on.
[3:45:19.600 --> 3:45:24.280]  Absolutely. And thank you for sending this, uh, esoteric Hollywood. Thank you for sending
[3:45:24.280 --> 3:45:28.240]  that out as well, my man. Hope you enjoy it. All right, bro.
