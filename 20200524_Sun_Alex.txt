[00:00.000 --> 00:12.840]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:12.840 --> 00:18.280]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:18.280 --> 00:21.960]  It is Sunday, May 24th, the year is 2020.
[00:21.960 --> 00:34.480]  We are 162 days out from this historic election, 162 days out from this historic election.
[00:34.480 --> 00:38.920]  If you are a TV viewer, a radio listener, you have to understand that when I say that
[00:38.920 --> 00:44.480]  you are the Paul Revere's in this fight, that is not to patronize you or pat you on the head
[00:44.480 --> 00:46.360]  and make you feel important.
[00:46.360 --> 00:57.720]  It is because obviously you are extremely important with 162 days left till this ultimately
[00:57.720 --> 01:00.120]  important election.
[01:00.120 --> 01:07.680]  Now I'm going to cover news coming up at the start of the next segment that is very important
[01:07.680 --> 01:13.480]  information that if it gets out to other people, we will be able to really turn a lot of things
[01:13.480 --> 01:17.840]  around.
[01:17.840 --> 01:21.520]  And of course I'm talking about all the real numbers and real actuaries coming out of big
[01:21.520 --> 01:30.040]  banks and insurance companies in the United States, South Africa, Japan, Europe, showing
[01:30.040 --> 01:36.720]  that the lockdowns are a hoax and that COVID-19 is a hoax and that everyone dying of other
[01:36.720 --> 01:44.280]  diseases has counted as COVID-19 and is the biggest fraud the planet has ever seen.
[01:44.280 --> 01:46.560]  Daily Mail.
[01:46.560 --> 01:48.680]  Lockdowns fail to alter the course of pandemic.
[01:48.680 --> 01:49.680]  J.P.
[01:49.680 --> 01:50.680]  Morgan's study claims.
[01:50.680 --> 01:58.960]  Well, they don't claim that and then it ties in to all the real numbers but the neuroses
[01:58.960 --> 02:03.560]  and the mental illness that it has manifested is going to take generations to go away unless
[02:03.560 --> 02:07.560]  we all start speaking out against the hoax.
[02:07.560 --> 02:13.080]  Now there is a real virus that came out of a weapons lab and it has great gain of function
[02:13.080 --> 02:14.840]  so a lot of people get it.
[02:14.840 --> 02:22.240]  So you can all be suspect and so that in tests it will match regular coronaviruses, one of
[02:22.240 --> 02:27.080]  the most common forms of death so they can create fear.
[02:27.080 --> 02:40.480]  It is a fear weapon, period, 97,000 deaths in the United States and almost all of those
[02:40.480 --> 02:44.760]  were individuals that were over 85 years of age and had up to three pre-existing conditions
[02:44.760 --> 02:49.000]  and most of the tests were fake and that's all in the details.
[02:49.000 --> 03:00.600]  And when medical doctors and scientists, epidemiologists and virologists all go public, they get silenced.
[03:00.600 --> 03:06.760]  We have a guest joining us who's gone viral coming up in the second hour who's a medical
[03:06.760 --> 03:12.440]  worker and of course their videos have been getting sidelined and blacklisted as well
[03:12.440 --> 03:15.960]  because the system is desperate to keep this hoax going.
[03:15.960 --> 03:23.960]  So we're going to expose it all here today but I cannot relate to you enough how important
[03:23.960 --> 03:32.560]  it is that you understand how powerful you are when you are silent.
[03:32.560 --> 03:36.480]  You give total acquiescence to the enemy and let them take over our lives.
[03:36.480 --> 03:42.600]  When you speak up and say no, you are powerful for all of us and for a pro-human future.
[03:42.600 --> 03:47.360]  So that's coming up as well, we have a lot of really good news.
[03:47.360 --> 03:55.840]  Judge Blast, governor's stay at home order, overrides it says Americans don't get ruled.
[03:55.840 --> 03:56.840]  That's coming up.
[03:56.840 --> 04:04.440]  Also, the Supreme Court of Brazil has ordered a Bolsonaro video to be released from a private
[04:04.440 --> 04:10.240]  cabinet meeting he was having and it shows that he's just as real as we all knew he was
[04:10.240 --> 04:14.480]  talking about how the communist cities within the country are locking things down to create
[04:14.480 --> 04:20.440]  a depression and martial law and how there are a bunch of pieces of garbage and a bunch
[04:20.440 --> 04:24.520]  of MF'ers and a bunch of criminals that must be stopped.
[04:24.520 --> 04:25.520]  So that's all coming up.
[04:25.520 --> 04:30.880]  Speaking of that in communist China, they're using the fear of COVID-19 to openly talk
[04:30.880 --> 04:36.040]  about a military invasion of Hong Kong.
[04:36.040 --> 04:45.320]  So it is all coming up on this live May 24th, 2020 Sunday transmission with only 162 days
[04:45.320 --> 04:46.320]  left.
[04:46.320 --> 04:49.280]  Please tell everyone you know about the local MNF stations you're listening to, the local
[04:49.280 --> 04:53.560]  TV stations you're watching and Bandod video and the live feeds as well as the easy place
[04:53.560 --> 04:59.840]  to find the feeds in FullWars.com for its launch show.
[04:59.840 --> 05:00.840]  Memorial Day is here.
[05:00.840 --> 05:05.200]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year and we were already running a huge sale but
[05:05.200 --> 05:08.040]  we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[05:08.040 --> 05:12.680]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale and then five items that
[05:12.680 --> 05:16.840]  weren't on sale that we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well
[05:16.840 --> 05:18.520]  for the Memorial Day special.
[05:18.520 --> 05:24.320]  So here it is, super male vitality, 40% off, knockout, the great sleeping, 50% off, Brain
[05:24.320 --> 05:26.640]  Force Plus hadn't been on sale for almost six months.
[05:26.640 --> 05:34.440]  It is 50% off, bio Jerusalem, 60% off, Shell Forge, it's incredible, 60% off and you've
[05:34.440 --> 05:37.960]  got all these other items on sale as well until they sell out.
[05:37.960 --> 05:45.520]  So MFullWarsStore.com or AAA-253-3139 to get these items to take advantage of this Megasale
[05:45.520 --> 05:46.520]  Memorial Day.
[05:46.520 --> 05:51.120]  Again, thank you all for watching, we appreciate your support, your financial support but it's
[05:51.120 --> 05:54.520]  also supported you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your
[05:54.520 --> 05:55.520]  body.
[05:55.520 --> 06:25.400]  Thank you all for your support, we are all in this together.
[06:25.400 --> 06:32.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this May 24th, 2020 Sunday transmission, only 162
[06:32.280 --> 06:36.000]  days left until this incredibly important election.
[06:36.000 --> 06:42.240]  I am here on this Sunday, the day before Memorial Day because I really value the fact that there
[06:42.240 --> 06:46.200]  are people even on the day when a lot of people are out barbecuing and having fun that are
[06:46.200 --> 06:50.080]  so concerned about the country and the world that you're tuning in to try to get the latest
[06:50.080 --> 06:55.040]  information and analysis and I will do my best to not let you down.
[06:55.040 --> 07:02.280]  Well here's the good news, we have judges in Illinois moving to override the unconstitutional
[07:02.280 --> 07:06.720]  continued lockdown order of the bureaucrats.
[07:06.720 --> 07:11.120]  We have Trump coming out on Friday and saying that he is saying the states are open and that
[07:11.120 --> 07:16.200]  religious services are essential or he will override the governors and that is a federal
[07:16.200 --> 07:20.880]  issue because it is the first amendment, that's how the first amendment begins for those that
[07:20.880 --> 07:21.880]  don't know.
[07:21.880 --> 07:25.280]  The Congress will make no law respecting and establishing religion or having the free
[07:25.280 --> 07:29.600]  exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the
[07:29.600 --> 07:34.760]  people, basically to assemble the petition to government for redress of grievances.
[07:34.760 --> 07:41.560]  And so Trump said that on Friday the Brazilian counterpart to Trump who is even more hardcore
[07:41.560 --> 07:49.640]  than Trump has come out and said this is communist martial law and he is going against the very
[07:49.640 --> 07:55.880]  same blue cities that we have here, the same types that are using it as a permanent lockdown
[07:55.880 --> 07:57.960]  to bankrupt the economy and make people dependent.
[07:57.960 --> 08:03.680]  We're going to play that clip in a moment from Bolsonaro but first this is what President
[08:03.680 --> 08:10.560]  Trump had to say on Friday that has the left freaking out so bad.
[08:10.560 --> 08:11.560]  Let's watch.
[08:11.560 --> 08:12.560]  Thank you very much.
[08:12.560 --> 08:19.920]  My direction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is issuing guidance for communities
[08:19.920 --> 08:20.920]  of faith.
[08:20.920 --> 08:27.840]  I want to thank Dr. Redfield and the CDC for their work on this matter and all the other
[08:27.840 --> 08:34.120]  work they've been doing over the past what now seems like a long period of time.
[08:34.120 --> 08:45.400]  Today I'm identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogue and mosques as essential places
[08:45.400 --> 08:49.440]  that provide essential services.
[08:49.440 --> 08:54.560]  Some governors have deemed the liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential but have
[08:54.560 --> 08:57.360]  left out churches and other houses of worship.
[08:57.360 --> 08:59.600]  It's not right.
[08:59.600 --> 09:06.400]  So I'm correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential.
[09:06.400 --> 09:13.800]  I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now.
[09:13.800 --> 09:18.240]  If there's any questions, they're going to have to call me but they're not going to be
[09:18.240 --> 09:21.120]  successful in that call.
[09:21.120 --> 09:26.480]  These are places that hold our society together and keep our people united.
[09:26.480 --> 09:32.440]  The people are demanding to go to church and synagogue, go to their mosque.
[09:32.440 --> 09:38.880]  Many millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life.
[09:38.880 --> 09:46.600]  The ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations
[09:46.600 --> 09:51.160]  are safe as they gather and pray.
[09:51.160 --> 09:52.840]  I know them well.
[09:52.840 --> 09:55.880]  They love their congregations.
[09:55.880 --> 09:57.320]  They love their people.
[09:57.320 --> 10:01.560]  They don't want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else.
[10:01.560 --> 10:07.000]  The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.880]  of faith to open right now for this weekend.
[10:12.880 --> 10:16.880]  If they don't do it, I will override the governors.
[10:16.880 --> 10:21.280]  In America we need more prayer, not less.
[10:21.280 --> 10:27.800]  Now if President Trump said, if a state banned abortion and if Trump said, I'm going to override
[10:27.800 --> 10:32.720]  that state, he couldn't do that constitutionally or vice versa.
[10:32.720 --> 10:36.800]  But if a state said we're going to confiscate the guns, he could override that because that's
[10:36.800 --> 10:37.800]  in the Bill of Rights.
[10:37.800 --> 10:40.240]  And it's the same thing when it comes to churches.
[10:40.240 --> 10:45.080]  It's the First Amendment and it's federally protected 100%.
[10:45.080 --> 10:48.080]  We don't get the rights from the feds.
[10:48.080 --> 10:51.240]  The Bill of Rights was set up to enshrine the rights that were already there and to say
[10:51.240 --> 10:56.600]  the government's job is to be a guarantor and a defender of those rights.
[10:56.600 --> 11:02.360]  And if it becomes destructive of those rights or aims, it is not just the people's right,
[11:02.360 --> 11:07.400]  but their duty to change or abolish.
[11:07.400 --> 11:10.800]  How do you mean it's necessary?
[11:10.800 --> 11:14.240]  Those forms of government to which they become accustomed.
[11:14.240 --> 11:16.920]  We've all heard of it.
[11:16.920 --> 11:22.960]  That's why we have July 4th and the fireworks going off in the sky symbolizing explosive
[11:22.960 --> 11:28.200]  cannonballs raining down shrapnel on British ships.
[11:28.200 --> 11:33.120]  It's called the Declaration of Independence.
[11:33.120 --> 11:35.800]  And Bolsonaro understands it.
[11:35.800 --> 11:39.200]  Big article on infowars.com and you know, I'm proud of our audience.
[11:39.200 --> 11:41.120]  I'm proud of your activism.
[11:41.120 --> 11:46.600]  I have met with Bolsonaro's son who's a major member of their Congress and we got an invite
[11:46.600 --> 11:47.600]  to go down there.
[11:47.600 --> 11:48.600]  We haven't been able to do it yet.
[11:48.600 --> 11:56.600]  I'm trying to get them on the show via Skype, ran into him at CPAC and they said, you know,
[11:56.600 --> 12:00.120]  you helped inspire us and we're one of the main movements to this happening.
[12:00.120 --> 12:01.120]  I'm like, okay.
[12:01.120 --> 12:03.200]  He goes, no, I'm serious.
[12:03.200 --> 12:04.920]  And you know, why did you get back with me earlier?
[12:04.920 --> 12:07.560]  I handed it off to a previous crew member that didn't get it done.
[12:07.560 --> 12:11.880]  So I'm handling it myself, but we're very proud of the fact that this whole operation,
[12:11.880 --> 12:15.640]  our crew, you the listeners and viewers that spread the articles, videos, you're responsible
[12:15.640 --> 12:19.080]  for the rebellions against the new order all over the world.
[12:19.080 --> 12:25.040]  UKIP's head has come on the broadcast or founder and said that they were getting almost no
[12:25.040 --> 12:30.840]  traction until about 15, 16 years ago, suddenly Nigel Farage would knock on doors and UKIP
[12:30.840 --> 12:36.360]  exploded because info wars was in the top 50 websites back then in the UK, according
[12:36.360 --> 12:37.360]  to Alexa.
[12:37.360 --> 12:44.720]  And again, it's not me bragging about info wars about bragging about you that this broadcast
[12:44.720 --> 12:50.360]  and the feet and legs you gave it, we're in this together has put Bolsonaro thanks to
[12:50.360 --> 12:53.680]  his incredible courage and that's brutally stabbed and survived.
[12:53.680 --> 12:55.600]  The guy is amazing.
[12:55.600 --> 12:59.920]  And quite frankly, I think more hardcore than Trump, he's more direct.
[12:59.920 --> 13:06.680]  He's just, uh, he's Trump 2.0 and I'm not kissing his ass is because we helped energize
[13:06.680 --> 13:07.680]  their operation.
[13:07.680 --> 13:08.680]  It's the truth.
[13:08.680 --> 13:16.920]  And to this guy, the Supreme Court ordered him to release his private meeting of cabinet
[13:16.920 --> 13:21.040]  officials because somebody snitched and said he was screaming at them.
[13:21.040 --> 13:22.800]  And so they did release it.
[13:22.800 --> 13:25.120]  And here is what he's saying in Portuguese.
[13:25.120 --> 13:26.760]  I'll do my best to read the subtitles.
[13:26.760 --> 13:28.760]  Here it is.
[13:28.760 --> 13:32.120]  Sir, ministers of justice, please.
[13:32.120 --> 13:35.560]  I was decided a long ago that you could handcuff almost no one.
[13:35.560 --> 13:41.400]  Why are they putting handcuffs on a citizen that's working on a woman in a public square?
[13:41.400 --> 13:43.320]  They keep on humiliating our people.
[13:43.320 --> 13:44.320]  And that's back.
[13:44.320 --> 13:45.320]  I'm going to start over again.
[13:45.320 --> 13:49.000]  Not a big deal, not a problem, but we kind of minimize what I was talking.
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.920]  So let's just go all the way back to the start.
[13:52.920 --> 13:54.720]  And then I'm going to read it as we go here.
[13:54.720 --> 13:55.720]  Thanks guys.
[13:55.720 --> 13:59.840]  Okay, sir, minister of justice, please.
[13:59.840 --> 14:03.520]  It was decided not long ago that you couldn't handcuff almost no one.
[14:03.520 --> 14:11.440]  Why are they putting handcuffs on citizens that's working or a woman in a public square?
[14:11.440 --> 14:13.240]  And the justice doesn't do anything.
[14:13.240 --> 14:15.840]  You have no effing.
[14:15.840 --> 14:17.760]  Back up again, please.
[14:17.760 --> 14:22.000]  You have no.
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  You have to effing speak.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.680]  Keep going.
[14:27.680 --> 14:35.920]  People are going to be quiet until when or do I have to keep on exposing this myself?
[14:35.920 --> 14:36.920]  You have to speak.
[14:36.920 --> 14:37.920]  Put it out there.
[14:37.920 --> 14:40.600]  Dish it out.
[14:40.600 --> 14:47.840]  You can't put handcuffs a decision on the Supreme Court itself.
[14:47.840 --> 14:54.280]  And we're going to be quiet until when they keep on humiliating our people and that's growing.
[14:54.280 --> 14:55.480]  People keep on pointing at me.
[14:55.480 --> 15:00.320]  I voted on you for you to do something.
[15:00.320 --> 15:06.440]  Voted on you so you make decisions and it's true.
[15:06.440 --> 15:13.160]  I couldn't care less with the reelection and we have to think about that all of us.
[15:13.160 --> 15:17.320]  What these sons of bitches want is our freedom.
[15:17.320 --> 15:25.280]  Look, look how easy it is to impose a dictatorship in Brazil, how easy it is.
[15:25.280 --> 15:28.800]  The people are locked down in their homes.
[15:28.800 --> 15:37.040]  This is why I want the Minister of Justice and Minister of Defense that the people arm
[15:37.040 --> 15:39.040]  themselves with a second amendment.
[15:39.040 --> 15:45.480]  That's going to ensure that the MFRs is going to show up and impose a dictatorship here
[15:45.480 --> 15:48.120]  because it's easy to impose a dictatorship here too easy.
[15:48.120 --> 15:55.080]  An effing mayor make a effing decree, handcuff people, keep everybody at home, he goes on
[15:55.080 --> 15:56.080]  to break it all down.
[15:56.080 --> 15:57.080]  It's powerful.
[15:57.080 --> 15:58.080]  Stay with us.
[15:58.080 --> 15:59.080]  Now it's official.
[15:59.080 --> 16:05.440]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years.
[16:05.440 --> 16:10.640]  And the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested
[16:10.640 --> 16:14.760]  because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of
[16:14.760 --> 16:17.160]  10 people that you visit.
[16:17.160 --> 16:21.280]  And if you go outside that list of 10, you'll be permanently detained.
[16:21.280 --> 16:26.000]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order where they let the criminals out
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.280]  of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential
[16:32.280 --> 16:33.480]  and a prisoner.
[16:33.480 --> 16:37.720]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalist are an authoritarian anti-human
[16:37.720 --> 16:38.720]  group.
[16:38.720 --> 16:43.880]  They have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game,
[16:43.880 --> 16:46.120]  which is global depopulation.
[16:46.120 --> 16:52.600]  So you see, submitting to them is death, the only way to stop them is to expose them,
[16:52.600 --> 16:57.040]  to hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy.
[16:57.040 --> 16:59.880]  Wake up or die.
[16:59.880 --> 17:02.480]  The United States is not communist China.
[17:02.480 --> 17:05.400]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[17:05.400 --> 17:07.280]  We don't blow up churches.
[17:07.280 --> 17:10.480]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[17:10.480 --> 17:16.720]  But all over the news, we see the U.N., billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media
[17:16.720 --> 17:19.800]  praising communist China for their response.
[17:19.800 --> 17:24.040]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has
[17:24.040 --> 17:27.200]  robots controlling people, well, then gee, we've got to do that.
[17:27.200 --> 17:31.320]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying, well, arrest you if you
[17:31.320 --> 17:32.640]  say Chinese virus.
[17:32.640 --> 17:36.360]  Well, now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[17:36.360 --> 17:41.560]  These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time because
[17:41.560 --> 17:45.520]  we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their
[17:45.520 --> 17:46.640]  power grab.
[17:46.640 --> 17:50.960]  The Resistance lives at band.video and infowars.com.
[17:50.960 --> 17:55.000]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats, and then we'll be able to defeat
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.120]  their operation that much quicker.
[18:00.120 --> 18:06.680]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[18:06.680 --> 18:12.080]  We will not have this sale that's coming on right now in May until our Christmas sale
[18:12.080 --> 18:13.080]  comes up.

[20:01.560 --> 20:19.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:19.840 --> 20:36.120]  All right, I want to get into massively important news.
[20:36.120 --> 20:37.120]  J.P.
[20:37.120 --> 20:41.600]  Morgan has a big actuary that's come out that basically shows the same type of things that
[20:41.600 --> 20:44.520]  South African insurance companies show.
[20:44.520 --> 20:52.480]  29 times the death caused by the COVID lockdown that actually caused by supposed COVID in
[20:52.480 --> 20:53.480]  South Africa.
[20:53.480 --> 20:55.520]  That came out two weeks ago.
[20:55.520 --> 20:58.800]  Well, lockdowns failed to alter the course of pandemic.
[20:58.800 --> 20:59.800]  J.P.
[20:59.800 --> 21:01.760]  Morgan's study finds daily mail.
[21:01.760 --> 21:04.600]  That's coming up next segment.
[21:04.600 --> 21:09.000]  I want to get back to Trump saying time to open the economy.
[21:09.000 --> 21:13.560]  I want to get back to all these federal and state judges saying time to open it up and
[21:13.560 --> 21:20.080]  making very clear statements that governors and governments don't have the power to do
[21:20.080 --> 21:25.560]  things like this, but they are doing it and then the numbers and the graphs and everything
[21:25.560 --> 21:30.080]  they based this on was a fraud.
[21:30.080 --> 21:36.320]  What these sons of bitches want is our freedom, Bolsonaro vows, to arm Brazilians to prevent
[21:36.320 --> 21:45.360]  dictatorship, videos of a private speech delivered by Brazilian President Bolsonaro
[21:45.360 --> 21:50.880]  to his cabinet about freedom and guns went viral on Saturday after a court order the
[21:50.880 --> 21:57.760]  release of one of his private meetings, Bolsonaro's son Eduardo released a video about the Brazilian
[21:57.760 --> 22:01.520]  Supreme Court issued an order on Friday to release one of President Bolsonaro's private
[22:01.520 --> 22:02.520]  staff meetings.
[22:02.520 --> 22:03.520]  This one particularly.
[22:03.520 --> 22:08.960]  The video shows President Bolsonaro going on the expert of lace rant against the communist
[22:08.960 --> 22:14.280]  and radical mayors in Brazil who've stripped away the people's rights, culminating in the
[22:14.280 --> 22:23.240]  endorsement of gun ownership, which he ran saying he would do 7076 worldwide, God, family,
[22:23.240 --> 22:24.880]  country.
[22:24.880 --> 22:28.960]  Why are they putting handcuffs on citizens that's working or a woman in the public square?
[22:28.960 --> 22:30.480]  How about the lockdown?
[22:30.480 --> 22:35.160]  Bolsonaro said translated English and the Justice Department doesn't say anything.
[22:35.160 --> 22:37.720]  You have to effing speak.
[22:37.720 --> 22:41.000]  They keep on humiliating our people and that's growing.
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.280]  What these sons of bitches want is our freedom.
[22:43.280 --> 22:45.720]  Look how easy it is to impose the dictatorship in Brazil.
[22:45.720 --> 22:46.920]  How easy it is to continue.
[22:46.920 --> 22:49.440]  The people are locked in their homes.
[22:49.440 --> 22:53.360]  This is what I want that the people arm themselves.
[22:53.360 --> 22:58.480]  That's going to ensure that the mother effort is not going to show up and impose a dictatorship
[22:58.480 --> 23:01.800]  here because it's easy to impose a dictatorship here.
[23:01.800 --> 23:02.800]  Too easy.
[23:02.800 --> 23:07.880]  A effing mayor makes a effing decree, handcuff people and keep everyone at home.
[23:07.880 --> 23:15.080]  If they were armed, they go to the streets and if I was a dictator, I'd want to disarm
[23:15.080 --> 23:22.960]  people just like all the other disarmed people before they imposed their respective dictatorship
[23:22.960 --> 23:29.080]  because I don't want a dictatorship to be said and it can't be postponed anymore.
[23:29.080 --> 23:33.200]  I want people armed because an armed people will never be enslaved, he added.
[23:33.200 --> 23:36.560]  Man, this is George Washington 2.0 right here, baby.
[23:36.560 --> 23:38.320]  This is better than Trump.
[23:38.320 --> 23:42.840]  And again, they've stabbed him viciously in the liver and kidneys.
[23:42.840 --> 23:43.840]  Everybody's seen the footage.
[23:43.840 --> 23:44.840]  We should pull that up.
[23:44.840 --> 23:45.840]  Bolsonaro stabbed.
[23:45.840 --> 23:47.600]  He's a total patriot.
[23:47.600 --> 23:52.200]  He said everything he said he would do, but the cities that are leftist controlled, they
[23:52.200 --> 23:57.760]  use a free society against it, are lockdown, martial law, bankrupting the normal businesses
[23:57.760 --> 24:02.080]  and normal people for control and Bolsonaro understands that.
[24:02.080 --> 24:06.360]  They've only had 20,000 people die of COVID-19 there.
[24:06.360 --> 24:09.600]  They had three times that die of the flu.
[24:09.600 --> 24:14.240]  And so the media is saying he's rocked by it.
[24:14.240 --> 24:17.800]  This is going to totally blow up in their faces.
[24:17.800 --> 24:20.200]  People want realness.
[24:20.200 --> 24:23.680]  People understand what's happening, the Supreme Court there is, but after him, I predict he
[24:23.680 --> 24:25.560]  doesn't back down and apologize.
[24:25.560 --> 24:26.760]  This will just make him stronger.
[24:26.760 --> 24:31.400]  By the way, talk about rocket fuel to him and his family, and they're all like, let's
[24:31.400 --> 24:33.000]  just say alpha males.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.600]  So they know what they're doing.
[24:35.600 --> 24:37.080]  They're risking their lives.
[24:37.080 --> 24:38.080]  It's beautiful.
[24:38.080 --> 24:42.560]  And I'm very proud of the fact that InfoWars has inspired them and others, and they inspire
[24:42.560 --> 24:45.120]  us as well greatly.
[24:45.120 --> 24:48.240]  But this whole lockdown is being used to destroy open free societies.
[24:48.240 --> 24:51.400]  And Democrats now, Bernie Sanders has admitted it.
[24:51.400 --> 24:53.720]  Other Democrats have admitted it.
[24:53.720 --> 24:55.640]  Just this last week, Hillary came out and admitted it.
[24:55.640 --> 24:57.520]  There were all these news headlines.
[24:57.520 --> 25:02.880]  The US say today, you name it, oh, it's so good for the earth and the environment that
[25:02.880 --> 25:08.160]  we've had this lockdown, and it's teaching us to change American society, and it's teaching
[25:08.160 --> 25:09.400]  us how to live differently.
[25:09.400 --> 25:16.560]  And it's all a bunch of billionaires that live on giant estates that are telling us
[25:16.560 --> 25:22.000]  if we don't live the way they want us to live, all the ice caps would be melted by 2013
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.560]  and 2017 and the same ones that constantly give us all these fake numbers and all these
[25:26.560 --> 25:31.480]  fake diagrams about how we're all dead unless we all stay locked up in our houses.
[25:31.480 --> 25:33.440]  But now that is not the case.
[25:33.440 --> 25:37.680]  But if you look at it, whether it's communist China going after Hong Kong or their own people
[25:37.680 --> 25:42.640]  in mainland, or whether it's the corrupt EU, or whether it is socialist and communist cities
[25:42.640 --> 25:49.600]  and states that are within free nations in the US or in Brazil, every communist mayor,
[25:49.600 --> 25:58.680]  every socialist mayor, every leftist mayor has used this to lock their people down and
[25:58.680 --> 26:05.560]  then call their globalist businesses essential, which is the ultimate form of discrimination.
[26:05.560 --> 26:08.280]  But the race-based system is coming to an end.
[26:08.280 --> 26:13.280]  People get that it's about individual rights and freedom and all of us being essential.
[26:13.280 --> 26:19.680]  That's why when Joe Biden came out with Charlemagne the God radio show and said, you're not black
[26:19.680 --> 26:25.160]  if you vote for Trump, that that created a giant exodus of people who didn't want to
[26:25.160 --> 26:28.120]  be talked to like they were a plantation slave.
[26:28.120 --> 26:32.960]  You see, we're all on the New World Order plantation, ladies and gentlemen, and it's
[26:32.960 --> 26:33.960]  time to get off of it.
[26:33.960 --> 26:38.200]  But when I come back, I'm actually going to burrow into the numbers here that I was mentioning
[26:38.200 --> 26:44.080]  that are so huge that we already know, but now it's JP Morgan saying it, that, OK, yeah,
[26:44.080 --> 26:46.720]  the lockdown's been a fraud, it didn't protect people.
[26:46.720 --> 26:50.440]  The cities that have the ongoing lockdown at the highest levels of COVID-19 lies death
[26:50.440 --> 26:51.440]  rate.
[26:51.440 --> 26:53.520]  Now, they don't extrapolate out why that is.
[26:53.520 --> 26:59.360]  I will, with the anecdotal prima facie evidence, that's all coming up separately.
[26:59.360 --> 27:04.800]  We have a Memorial Day special going right now that is going to have to end in just a
[27:04.800 --> 27:05.800]  few days.
[27:05.800 --> 27:10.960]  Our big mega giant sale we've been running for over a week and a half has had to come
[27:10.960 --> 27:15.800]  to an end because about a third of the products that we had have been sold out.
[27:15.800 --> 27:22.400]  In fact, I had my print off for the new promo here on Friday, and it's not here.
[27:22.400 --> 27:29.240]  So if you guys will go into the producers folder for me over there, it'll have the new
[27:29.240 --> 27:34.520]  ad that I personally wrote Friday and emailed over, thanks.
[27:34.520 --> 27:43.760]  But separately, ladies and gentlemen, Memorial Day Super Sale is now live at infowarstore.com,

[28:51.160 --> 28:58.480]  makes the broadcast possible, we'll be right back, stay with us.
[28:58.480 --> 29:02.640]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world
[29:02.640 --> 29:09.120]  economy to where it is, every economist is on record saying that as this economy has
[29:09.120 --> 29:13.400]  been shut down for two months, it is going to be a death sentence to the third world,
[29:13.400 --> 29:18.120]  and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world, and that the general public is
[29:18.120 --> 29:22.200]  going to go into deep, deep debt to the mega banks, they're not going to have medical ID
[29:22.200 --> 29:28.280]  cards, force inoculations, we are now in a giant dystopia.
[29:28.280 --> 29:33.920]  A lot of people are waking up, and there is a major backlash taking place against this
[29:33.920 --> 29:38.920]  tyranny, and we must all rediscover our bill of rights, rediscover our constitution and
[29:38.920 --> 29:44.400]  our backbone, and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say, shut
[29:44.400 --> 29:49.040]  your business down, shut your life down, it will save lives, no, it's caused millions
[29:49.040 --> 29:53.120]  to already starve to death, tens of millions more, so the cowards who went along with us
[29:53.120 --> 29:58.840]  with your virtues signaling you have destroyed your life and our lives, congratulations.
[29:58.840 --> 30:03.560]  I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying our economy slowing down and shutting
[30:03.560 --> 30:08.320]  down is like shooting a deer and it runs a hundred yards before it knows it's been shot
[30:08.320 --> 30:13.480]  and then it finally dies, she said, well yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time
[30:13.480 --> 30:17.960]  there was an argument in the street, and another man shot another man in the head, and the
[30:17.960 --> 30:22.800]  man that got shot in the head had blood pouring out, a huge hole, he was holding it, he walked
[30:22.800 --> 30:28.480]  around gibbering, talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead, well
[30:28.480 --> 30:33.320]  that's what's going to happen with our economy, it is in cardiac arrest, this has been done
[30:33.320 --> 30:39.160]  by design, and the UN, the Chi Coms, the mainstream media orchestrated it, hyped it and tried
[30:39.160 --> 30:43.920]  to keep the economy closed, so remember, the depression that's coming and the third world
[30:43.920 --> 30:50.680]  collapse is all on the UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on
[30:50.680 --> 30:55.400]  the Democrats, we tried to stop it, we tried to fight it, you guys said you wanted to wreck
[30:55.400 --> 30:58.920]  America and the world and now you've done it, congratulations.
[30:58.920 --> 31:06.120]  We are 170 days out from the 2020 election, it is a referendum of national sovereignty
[31:06.120 --> 31:11.960]  against localism, and Obama, Hillary and the deep state have been caught attempting to overthrow
[31:11.960 --> 31:16.760]  President Trump's election and they've been caught in two separate coup attempts against
[31:16.760 --> 31:22.240]  the president, now they've been pushing COVID-19 to shut down the economy and create a depression,
[31:22.240 --> 31:26.600]  well China's already been open for business for more than a month, this is an ongoing
[31:26.600 --> 31:32.160]  globalist attempt to punish the American people, wreck our economy and hope that we won't recognize
[31:32.160 --> 31:37.400]  that it is they, the new world order, that have orchestrated this and not President Trump,
[31:37.400 --> 31:41.600]  they know their crimes are coming out, they know the chickens are coming home to roost,
[31:41.600 --> 31:47.120]  so now they're panicking and trying to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based
[31:47.120 --> 31:53.560]  on keeping the public safe from COVID-19, the entire COVID-19 system is a giant hopes
[31:53.560 --> 31:59.600]  and must be exposed if America has any hope, so get out there and expose this fraud.
[31:59.600 --> 32:03.800]  Memorial Day is here, it's one of the biggest sales of the year, and we were already running
[32:03.800 --> 32:07.800]  a huge sale but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out,

[32:54.880 --> 33:02.480]  thank you all for your support, we are all in this together.
[33:02.480 --> 33:09.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:32.480 --> 33:47.560]  So, Trump did a powerful Sheryl Ackison interview that's posted in full at infowars.com where
[33:47.560 --> 33:51.800]  he led a lot of really important issues, there's a 24 minute interview, we won't air the whole
[33:51.800 --> 33:57.960]  thing here, but here he is talking about having a chance, if he gets reelected, to break the
[33:57.960 --> 34:03.320]  deep state, which is an organized group of globalist criminals in the bureaucracy, here
[34:03.320 --> 34:04.320]  it is.
[34:04.320 --> 34:09.760]  In the deep state, I'm fighting the swamp and I said I was doing it and I'm exposing
[34:09.760 --> 34:15.680]  the swamp, I think if it keeps going the way I'm going and Ratliff is fantastic, if it
[34:15.680 --> 34:22.200]  keeps going the way it's going, I have a chance to break the deep state, it's a vicious group
[34:22.200 --> 34:27.320]  of people, it's very bad for our country and that's never happened before, you happen to
[34:27.320 --> 34:30.880]  be a victim of the deep state, I hate to tell you whether you know it or not, but they've
[34:30.880 --> 34:36.160]  treated you horribly over the years and so have they treated many other people, they
[34:36.160 --> 34:40.760]  never thought I was going to win and then I won and then they tried to get me out, that
[34:40.760 --> 34:44.840]  was the insurance policy, she's going to win but just in case she doesn't win we have an
[34:44.840 --> 34:50.840]  insurance policy and now I beat them on the insurance policy and now they're being exposed,
[34:50.840 --> 34:58.480]  homie is a dirty cop, McCabe, bad guy, these are all bad guys, Lisa Page and Stroke, these
[34:58.480 --> 35:04.520]  are the two lovers, right, and they use public servers, they put it out public because they
[35:04.520 --> 35:10.280]  didn't want anybody to see, like spouses etc. to see that they were having an affair and
[35:10.280 --> 35:15.620]  because they did that they got caught, tremendous things have happened, they forged documents,
[35:15.620 --> 35:19.400]  we caught them, they have people that have forged documents.
[35:19.400 --> 35:26.320]  Yeah, we forget that they used forged documents to get the FISA court to allow the illegal
[35:26.320 --> 35:31.640]  spying on Trump because even then it was illegal and I forget that it was William Benning two
[35:31.640 --> 35:37.320]  and a half years ago that called me and he said, you know, the federal court, the FISA
[35:37.320 --> 35:42.880]  oversight court has come out and said that this was fraud, no one's covered it, you should
[35:42.880 --> 35:48.440]  cover it and we exposed what the Nunez memo was, Nunez was saying, oh I'm going to expose
[35:48.440 --> 35:56.520]  this incredible federal court oversight dealing with the unmasking and dealing with the crossfire
[35:56.520 --> 36:02.400]  hurricane, but there it was and I had to have the former technical head of the NSA call
[36:02.400 --> 36:09.560]  me up and tell me, Alex, go look at this, there it is, February 1st, 2018, over two
[36:09.560 --> 36:16.880]  years ago, and again, it's not that I'm even that smart, we have a little platform here
[36:16.880 --> 36:20.560]  that people that are good in the government and good in corporations use to get stuff
[36:20.560 --> 36:25.360]  out, it's not that I'm that special, they want to get us off there, it's that I will
[36:25.360 --> 36:31.440]  tell the truth and I will have whistleblowers on and that scares the living daylights out
[36:31.440 --> 36:37.080]  of the establishment who have hijacked this country, but there's the ongoing head of the
[36:37.080 --> 36:42.200]  FBI, not sure why we threw him up there, but there he is, there's the director of the
[36:42.200 --> 36:51.880]  FBI currently, now let me go ahead and get into this next piece of news and information,
[36:51.880 --> 36:56.040]  and I'm not mad that they put the current director of the FBI up, they're in there pulling
[36:56.040 --> 36:59.120]  up whatever I talk about, we don't prescript the show, I get ready and they hear me talk
[36:59.120 --> 37:02.800]  about stuff, they just type stuff in and pull it up and I want to create some new Q thing
[37:02.800 --> 37:09.480]  or some cryptic deal because we randomly put that up there.
[37:09.480 --> 37:15.400]  Let me hit the, since we did that, let me just hit more about what we were just covering
[37:15.400 --> 37:21.080]  and in the next segment I'll get into the KP Morgan admitting that basically COVID lockdowns
[37:21.080 --> 37:25.080]  are hoax, it's a big deal, I mean we already know this, we can look at the same numbers
[37:25.080 --> 37:28.520]  they're looking at and it's just absolutely on its face, open and shut, two plus two
[37:28.520 --> 37:34.440]  equals four, it's ridiculous, but let's get back into what they were just talking about,
[37:34.440 --> 37:42.640]  Trump has now removed five so-called inspector generals because you've got these agencies
[37:42.640 --> 37:52.320]  and you go, oh well they're not rogue agencies because, because they've got inspector generals
[37:52.320 --> 37:56.600]  over them, but when the inspector generals are globalists and when the inspector generals
[37:56.600 --> 38:03.720]  go along with three attempted coup attempts on the president, you have to remove them,
[38:03.720 --> 38:07.360]  if presidents come in they remove all the inspector generals, they remove the attorney
[38:07.360 --> 38:11.520]  general, they remove whoever was there because it's a part of having who you got elected
[38:11.520 --> 38:18.040]  put in, so the people you know, you trust, the American people elected Trump, we respect
[38:18.040 --> 38:26.200]  him, we trust him, so Bill Clinton, I didn't like Bill Clinton, I didn't trust Bill Clinton,
[38:26.200 --> 38:30.720]  but you know what he did, he fired every US attorney the first day he got in office, Trump
[38:30.720 --> 38:39.240]  didn't fire anybody because he didn't know what he was really up against and that these
[38:39.240 --> 38:45.920]  people had all been put in place by the Clintons and by Obama and by the Bushes and were globalist
[38:45.920 --> 38:49.800]  and so everything he did they were going to leak, everything he stood up for they were
[38:49.800 --> 38:55.280]  going to undermine and so we've said, purge them, don't purge them like the communists
[38:55.280 --> 39:00.200]  do marching on the field and shooting in the back of the head, the communists are elected,
[39:00.200 --> 39:05.960]  we elected Bolsonaro to defend the Brazilian people, they did, we elected President Trump,
[39:05.960 --> 39:11.600]  we the people of this planet, elected Trump to go back to a pro-human future and so for
[39:11.600 --> 39:17.640]  him to remove people because he's found out their allegiance isn't to America, their allegiance
[39:17.640 --> 39:22.720]  isn't to the people that voted Trump in, their allegiance is to the global new world order
[39:22.720 --> 39:28.040]  and because Trump's never been a sellout to globalists he just can't believe it, they
[39:28.040 --> 39:30.680]  lie to his face.
[39:30.680 --> 39:35.880]  So now Joe McGuire has been removed as the acting director of national intelligence and
[39:35.880 --> 39:41.240]  Trump has put his guy in that will get the job done of ferreting out the fifth column
[39:41.240 --> 39:43.880]  out of the United States.
[39:43.880 --> 39:49.080]  So we've had Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, bye bye, Department
[39:49.080 --> 39:53.360]  of Defense Acting Inspector General Glenn Fine, bye bye, Health and Human Services
[39:53.360 --> 39:57.760]  Acting Inspector General Christine Grimm, goodbye, State Department Inspector General
[39:57.760 --> 40:07.800]  Stephen Lenick, goodbye, Department of Transportation Acting Inspector General Mitch, B-E-H-M gone
[40:07.800 --> 40:14.400]  and now we've got this latest Joe McGuire, gone, gone, gone, gone and don't let the door
[40:14.400 --> 40:20.200]  slap you on your new world order arse.
[40:20.200 --> 40:26.840]  The globalist coup is being removed and all these globalists like William McRaven that
[40:26.840 --> 40:31.280]  ran the whole fake Navy seal, been lied and crap and all the rest of this politicizing
[40:31.280 --> 40:34.120]  the Navy, special warfare and ruining it.
[40:34.120 --> 40:42.200]  This joke talks about patriotism and talks about traitors within and Edmund Burke quotes
[40:42.200 --> 40:45.880]  the only thing necessary for trying to be able to good men do nothing.
[40:45.880 --> 40:50.740]  They have presided over the destruction of the Republic, the sellout to the Communist
[40:50.740 --> 40:57.520]  Chinese, the new world order, a drag clean story time federally funded, Hollywood hating
[40:57.520 --> 41:04.240]  America, Hollywood funding race war, all the demoralization, all the one sided trade deals
[41:04.240 --> 41:11.280]  to shut our economy down, letting the radical Islamists stand, the list goes on and on and
[41:11.280 --> 41:17.600]  on and on, allowing criminal elements of the CIA to ship narcotics in.
[41:17.600 --> 41:23.640]  You know why everybody's really pissed at Trump on the dark side, on the new war side?
[41:23.640 --> 41:26.560]  Because Trump's cutting all that off.
[41:26.560 --> 41:30.120]  He's removing the governmental narcotics traffickers.
[41:30.120 --> 41:35.200]  Trump is a big anti-drug guy and he's like, this is a joke and so it's all being ended
[41:35.200 --> 41:40.360]  right now and it's absolutely pissing them off to no end and I love it.
[41:40.360 --> 41:43.840]  I mean, Trump's totally for real in that he really wants to be president.
[41:43.840 --> 41:46.160]  He believes he's doing the right thing.
[41:46.160 --> 41:50.000]  He made a lot of mistakes, not getting rid of all these globalists when he got in, but
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.680]  he didn't know who they all were.
[41:51.680 --> 41:56.560]  He counted on others under him to go out and get him good staff.
[41:56.560 --> 42:00.280]  Well, the first thing they did was blackmail and threaten everybody around Trump.
[42:00.280 --> 42:04.640]  I mean, I'm down the line from the top of the pyramid with Trump, at least two levels
[42:04.640 --> 42:09.720]  and they have been on me, my whole family, dirty tricks, lies, New York Times, Washington
[42:09.720 --> 42:18.640]  Post, assigned dirty trick reporters, private investigators, foreign intelligence agencies,
[42:18.640 --> 42:24.720]  attempted blackmail operations, sex operatives, I mean, and I'm down the hill, man.
[42:24.720 --> 42:29.240]  I mean, I'm in Texas not trying to be in the swamp, not trying to parlay power, not trying
[42:29.240 --> 42:30.240]  to get favors done.
[42:30.240 --> 42:35.720]  I'm just trying to promote freedom and they have had an army on my ass.
[42:35.720 --> 42:40.760]  So let me tell you, anyone in that winehouse has been under total surveillance and assault
[42:40.760 --> 42:41.760]  of the state.
[42:41.760 --> 42:44.360]  But finally, it's being turned back against them.
[42:44.360 --> 42:47.480]  And finally, they're getting in trouble for it.
[42:47.480 --> 42:50.760]  And finally, they're being shown to be the anti-American traders they are.
[42:50.760 --> 42:55.480]  So when they sit up there and say, I'm a trader, Trump's a trader, BS, you're the traders and
[42:55.480 --> 43:01.680]  everybody knows it, scum.
[43:01.680 --> 43:04.320]  Please remember that we have a lot of great products that have been out of stock, back
[43:04.320 --> 43:05.840]  in stock by krill oil.
[43:05.840 --> 43:06.840]  We have the ultimate krill oil.
[43:06.840 --> 43:09.040]  We don't know the benefits of krill oil.

[43:31.720 --> 43:34.160]  Both formulas were really close to selling out real red pill plus.
[43:34.160 --> 43:36.240]  It's got some stimulant in it, natural caffeine.

[43:38.480 --> 43:42.280]  Infowarsstore.com and we're already talking to our suppliers and some of them are saying
[43:42.280 --> 43:46.640]  we may not take orders in a few months, so I may not ever be able to get products again.
[43:46.640 --> 43:48.680]  Things are collapsing so bad, folks.
[43:48.680 --> 43:50.240]  This is total depression.
[43:50.240 --> 43:51.960]  The infrastructure is going down.
[43:51.960 --> 43:54.720]  Get the products while you still can.
[43:54.720 --> 44:03.960]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles.
[44:03.960 --> 44:08.680]  When you shoot an elk at, say, 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll
[44:08.680 --> 44:13.400]  still run 50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards.
[44:13.400 --> 44:17.960]  They've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins, but
[44:17.960 --> 44:23.400]  all of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over and they die.
[44:23.400 --> 44:26.440]  Then you go back and haul them back in.
[44:26.440 --> 44:29.880]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now.
[44:29.880 --> 44:36.200]  And that's what the economic numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart
[44:36.200 --> 44:40.720]  and for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[44:40.720 --> 44:44.240]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead according
[44:44.240 --> 44:49.160]  to the UN and I believe their numbers, because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this
[44:49.160 --> 44:51.000]  to depopulate the third world.
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.120]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're
[44:54.120 --> 45:00.040]  a bunch of suckers and you bought into something better than what Hitler did.
[45:00.040 --> 45:06.960]  This is the end, my friends, my only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of
[45:06.960 --> 45:12.800]  everything that stands the end, the safety, the delusion.
[45:12.800 --> 45:18.920]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because there was only the mirage of safety in movies
[45:18.920 --> 45:24.600]  and partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other people.
[45:24.600 --> 45:29.560]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny, just like the history books show us, just
[45:29.560 --> 45:31.200]  like the Bible states.
[45:31.200 --> 45:35.440]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought
[45:35.440 --> 45:41.200]  into captivity because their people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated
[45:41.200 --> 45:44.200]  by spies and then they were enslaved.
[45:44.200 --> 45:49.880]  We are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[45:49.880 --> 45:52.360]  absolute bondage.
[45:52.360 --> 45:55.040]  Info wars has decided to fight for freedom.
[45:55.040 --> 46:00.800]  Info wars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[46:00.800 --> 46:05.680]  We're living in insanely dangerous times and I told folks going back three months ago,
[46:05.680 --> 46:09.080]  I'm not buying horrible food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[46:09.080 --> 46:13.080]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted
[46:13.080 --> 46:17.080]  that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of
[46:17.080 --> 46:20.880]  farms and ranches across the United States and it's even worse in the third world.
[46:20.880 --> 46:24.680]  So I hope Trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it, but with the election
[46:24.680 --> 46:29.240]  fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else
[46:29.240 --> 46:34.560]  is going on, now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years.
[46:34.560 --> 46:38.760]  They're in easily totable bags, it's high quality food and it's good to have that box
[46:38.760 --> 46:41.080]  checked off to be ready and it funds the info war.
[46:41.080 --> 46:45.040]  So we have storeable food available again, infowarstore.com or call toll free, triple
[46:45.040 --> 46:48.720]  A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, whatever you do, get prepared and get ready
[46:48.720 --> 46:53.160]  because the globalists want you dependent on them, they do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[46:53.160 --> 47:22.680]  Your storeable food at infowarstore.com right now while you still can.
[47:22.680 --> 47:25.480]  We have a very special guest joining us next hour, who I'll tell you about in a few minutes,
[47:25.480 --> 47:29.960]  but let me just throw this out.
[47:29.960 --> 47:34.120]  If you've got some baseball player signing a five year, a hundred million dollar contract
[47:34.120 --> 47:38.880]  with some NFL player, basketball player, I don't care.
[47:38.880 --> 47:43.960]  But when my old friend Joe Rogan, I've done 22 years, moved to Spotify, it wasn't about
[47:43.960 --> 47:47.640]  the money because I know the contract details.
[47:47.640 --> 47:52.520]  He's making the same amount he was, he did it because he wanted freedom and didn't like
[47:52.520 --> 47:55.680]  the fact that YouTube had been censoring.
[47:55.680 --> 48:00.520]  And Joe told me that and Joe said, you can talk about that Thursday.
[48:00.520 --> 48:03.880]  He just didn't know how big it would be and how that would kind of overshadow that the
[48:03.880 --> 48:06.040]  stock was up $5 billion.
[48:06.040 --> 48:09.240]  And so it wasn't that he didn't want that out there, it was that they didn't want that
[48:09.240 --> 48:15.000]  to be the story and said how great Spotify is going to be and how it's going to be free
[48:15.000 --> 48:16.000]  speech going forward.
[48:16.000 --> 48:23.320]  So I'm going to leave it at that, but everything I said on Thursday was what Joe told me, but
[48:23.320 --> 48:27.760]  with my own view on it.
[48:27.760 --> 48:30.480]  Like Joe didn't say, I'm the real Alex Jones.
[48:30.480 --> 48:35.520]  No, I said, wow, Joe, you really are coming out against the globalist, you're coming out
[48:35.520 --> 48:39.280]  against Obama, you're coming out against all these people and what you're telling me, this
[48:39.280 --> 48:43.240]  is beautiful.
[48:43.240 --> 48:47.680]  And now look at Fox News today, Joe Rogan would vote for President Trump over Joe Biden.
[48:47.680 --> 48:54.240]  I don't think he can handle anything going to say it's an insult to put somebody up this
[48:54.240 --> 48:55.240]  brain damaged.
[48:55.240 --> 49:01.440]  Well, I mean, that's what I came and told you Thursday Joe was saying, but I get it.
[49:01.440 --> 49:06.480]  I'm so attacked or whatever, but Joe said himself, there's another one Joe Rogan, Obamagate
[49:06.480 --> 49:12.000]  is real illegal and basically Obama's a criminal.
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.400]  That's been put up.
[49:13.400 --> 49:16.920]  By the way, Thursday when I talked to Joe at Lincoln, and I've talked to him obviously
[49:16.920 --> 49:24.720]  every day since then, but he just taped those shows and look, I'm going to leave it at that.
[49:24.720 --> 49:28.360]  It was obviously hyperbole in there for me and my view on what Joe was doing and the
[49:28.360 --> 49:32.480]  fact that we need to see other platforms, not just like Google, Facebook and Twitter
[49:32.480 --> 49:33.480]  since everybody.
[49:33.480 --> 49:37.720]  And so Spotify does that with Joe, that'll open the web for so many others.
[49:37.720 --> 49:42.280]  And Joe said, you can say, I'm really upset by all these medical doctors, they're censoring
[49:42.280 --> 49:47.000]  off the air, but they don't want people to hear from who are talking about the models
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.120]  being all fraudulent, COVID-19 not being very deadly and all the other deaths being attributed
[49:52.120 --> 49:55.800]  to COVID-19, which is confirmed.
[49:55.800 --> 49:58.640]  People have the right to say whatever they want, but they certainly have the right to
[49:58.640 --> 50:02.360]  say what's true.
[50:02.360 --> 50:06.440]  And so Joe said, oh, sure, you know, go, go, go, great comment and like, man, you're really
[50:06.440 --> 50:10.560]  amped up and excited and yeah, stocks up 2 billion and I just want to have free speech.
[50:10.560 --> 50:11.560]  And I'm like, great.
[50:11.560 --> 50:12.560]  I can say all this.
[50:12.560 --> 50:13.560]  Yeah.
[50:13.560 --> 50:14.560]  Just don't say these few things.
[50:14.560 --> 50:15.560]  I didn't say the few things he told me.
[50:15.560 --> 50:21.000]  Like Joe's like, yeah, I'm looking at moving to Texas and blah, blah, blah, and some other
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  things.
[50:22.000 --> 50:23.400]  And can I say that?
[50:23.400 --> 50:24.400]  Yeah.
[50:24.400 --> 50:25.400]  Just don't say these particulars.
[50:25.400 --> 50:30.160]  And then I said that and I was talking to him and he goes, hey, told people I'm coming
[50:30.160 --> 50:31.160]  to Texas.
[50:31.160 --> 50:33.360]  I said, dude, you forget you'd already said that on your podcast.
[50:33.360 --> 50:35.360]  He goes, oh, yeah.
[50:35.360 --> 50:37.240]  So, you know, Joe's a really great guy.
[50:37.240 --> 50:42.000]  He's a smart guy and I know he's a patriot, but it doesn't matter because it's not Alex
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.000]  Jones saying it now.
[50:43.000 --> 50:52.400]  They released this podcast yesterday where he says that Joe Biden is an embarrassment
[50:52.400 --> 50:56.160]  and a joke and an insult and a slap in the face to everybody.
[50:56.160 --> 50:59.920]  And so that's all over the news now and that's great.
[50:59.920 --> 51:08.080]  That's exactly what I told you on Thursday that Joe is pulling away from this because
[51:08.080 --> 51:09.920]  he knows it's so destructive.
[51:09.920 --> 51:12.440]  Here's the clip Fox News is playing.
[51:12.440 --> 51:16.000]  We need, I mean, I can't vote for that guy.
[51:16.000 --> 51:17.080]  I can't vote for him.
[51:17.080 --> 51:18.080]  I can't vote for him.
[51:18.080 --> 51:20.080]  I can't vote for Trump.
[51:20.080 --> 51:22.080]  I'd rather vote for Trump than him.
[51:22.080 --> 51:23.640]  I don't think he could handle anything.
[51:23.640 --> 51:25.640]  I mean, you're relying entirely on his cabinet.
[51:25.640 --> 51:29.880]  Like, if you want to talk about an individual leader that can communicate, he can't do that.
[51:29.880 --> 51:33.080]  So there you go.
[51:33.080 --> 51:41.920]  So what I said on air was 80% of what Joe said and then my view on what it meant.
[51:41.920 --> 51:46.600]  And then I get having Alex Jones become the spokesperson for this big move away from YouTube
[51:46.600 --> 51:50.000]  to Spotify is probably not what they were looking for.
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.880]  I just don't think Joe realized how we get seized on to put out the news, but it's all
[51:53.880 --> 51:54.880]  on its face.
[51:54.880 --> 51:59.200]  I mean, look, let's just move Joe Rogan out of the equation.
[51:59.200 --> 52:04.280]  Everybody is in an exodus away from control.
[52:04.280 --> 52:08.480]  I don't care if you're liberal, conservative, old, young, black, white, people want freedom.
[52:08.480 --> 52:13.440]  And speaking of that, here's a little five minute segment of the individual that's going
[52:13.440 --> 52:21.840]  to be joining us in the next hour, Josiah Dan, who is a registered nurse who went out
[52:21.840 --> 52:28.080]  and gave a viral interview with millions of views, 20 years in healthcare on COVID-19.
[52:28.080 --> 52:30.120]  Here's what he had to say.
[52:30.120 --> 52:34.280]  Here's a boil down that he'll join us live coming up in the next hour.
[52:34.280 --> 52:39.040]  We'll look at all the numbers, JPMorgan admitting that the lockdown made it worse and so much
[52:39.040 --> 52:40.040]  more.
[52:40.040 --> 52:41.040]  But here's what they don't want you to see.
[52:41.040 --> 52:45.040]  I stand before you as a practicing medical professional that questions the validity of
[52:45.040 --> 52:49.560]  the claims leveled about this pandemic.
[52:49.560 --> 52:54.960]  I stand with many of the doctors, PAs, nurse practitioners, and a host of other medical
[52:54.960 --> 53:00.240]  professionals who dare to question the narrative as it has been presented to us by the media.
[53:00.240 --> 53:05.000]  I have taken care of many patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 and have assisted
[53:05.000 --> 53:09.720]  to intubate them, manage their medications, and get them to whatever level of care they
[53:09.720 --> 53:12.080]  need to get to.
[53:12.080 --> 53:16.640]  As I have cared for these patients and attempted to keep up with the latest information as best
[53:16.640 --> 53:21.080]  I can, I have discovered that much of what is stated by the media outlets and state leaders
[53:21.080 --> 53:27.320]  does not match up with reality in the workplace and according to the scientific peer-reviewed
[53:27.320 --> 53:29.560]  literature.
[53:29.560 --> 53:31.440]  So what do the experts say?
[53:31.440 --> 53:35.840]  Is the view of the sciences and the healthcare community a consensus as seems to be portrayed
[53:35.840 --> 53:38.320]  by the media and state governments?
[53:38.320 --> 53:42.160]  The answer to this question is a resounding no.
[53:42.160 --> 53:46.600]  I stand here as proof that the healthcare community is not of one mind.
[53:46.600 --> 53:51.640]  I have had many conversations with my colleagues who have expressed dissenting opinions from
[53:51.640 --> 53:54.000]  the apparent mainstream view.
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.520]  Should we mask?
[53:55.520 --> 53:57.320]  Should we open businesses?
[53:57.320 --> 53:59.680]  Should we be in fear of our lives?
[53:59.680 --> 54:04.080]  If we listen to the media and the governor, like our own, the answer to this question
[54:04.080 --> 54:07.440]  actually stands in defiance of the data and history.
[54:07.440 --> 54:12.520]  Our country has largely shut down its workforce and hidden in fear from an invisible enemy
[54:12.520 --> 54:16.880]  that has claimed in the ballpark of as many lives as a bad, severe flu season.
[54:16.880 --> 54:21.800]  Today we collectively suffer from broad business closures, violating both the Constitution
[54:21.800 --> 54:24.400]  and our individual rights.
[54:24.400 --> 54:29.120]  Mandatory masking policies are in large part a spurious attempt at best to gain PR for
[54:29.120 --> 54:33.640]  the state officials seeming to act as if they are doing something to protect us as individuals,
[54:33.640 --> 54:38.720]  while in fact may very well be putting us at higher risk for illness.
[54:38.720 --> 54:46.080]  Clearing masks outside of enclosed spaces, i.e. in nature, is ridiculous and asinine.
[54:46.080 --> 54:53.440]  Quarantine to healthy has never been mandated on a mass scale such as this, and we are seeing
[54:53.440 --> 54:57.200]  the profound economic effects with record unemployment levels.
[54:57.200 --> 55:03.000]  We are being told that we need to start contact tracing to limit exposure and track those who
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.920]  have been infected or affected by COVID-19.
[55:05.920 --> 55:13.720]  Now listen to me very clearly, listen clearly, just, let's just cut the PC speech out and
[55:13.720 --> 55:15.720]  call it what it is.
[55:15.720 --> 55:23.720]  This is Big Brother, I don't know about you, but I don't want the federal or state government
[55:23.720 --> 55:27.480]  meddling in my affairs any more than they already are.
[55:27.480 --> 55:35.240]  My home is my own and the government tracers are not welcome to come into it, they're not
[55:35.240 --> 55:40.240]  welcome to come to my home nor to come into it.
[55:40.240 --> 55:46.160]  Say no to contact tracing laws and don't comply when they push you to do so.
[55:46.160 --> 55:51.120]  These programs ultimately are driving to control you at your most foundational level, your
[55:51.120 --> 55:52.120]  body.
[55:52.120 --> 55:59.120]  The contact tracing bill, HR6666, seems to destroy, seeks to destroy these protections,
[55:59.120 --> 56:04.840]  ultimately opening the door to mandated tracking which violates our right to privacy and forced
[56:04.840 --> 56:11.920]  vaccination which ultimately is forced medical experimentation.
[56:11.920 --> 56:15.960]  These oversteps in tyranny do not go unnoticed.
[56:15.960 --> 56:19.080]  We are a freedom loving people and we are poor tyranny.
[56:19.080 --> 56:31.240]  We will not back down when threatened, cease and desist of your current course of action.
[56:31.240 --> 56:38.480]  And this is for all of us, we stand at a precipice and have before us a choice, from behind comes
[56:38.480 --> 56:43.200]  a torrent of destruction, a new normal that threatens the very freedoms guaranteed by
[56:43.200 --> 56:46.360]  the Constitution and by the Bill of Rights.
[56:46.360 --> 56:47.360]  This torrent.
[56:47.360 --> 56:49.280]  All right folks, we're going to stop right there, we're going to come back with the rest
[56:49.280 --> 56:52.440]  of the speech next hour and then Josiah Dan will be joining us.
[56:52.440 --> 56:57.520]  Look at this MSN article, undercover agents enforcing state health rules at restaurant
[56:57.520 --> 56:58.720]  bars.
[56:58.720 --> 57:02.240]  This is how they get used to secret police being tracked by your cell phones.
[57:02.240 --> 57:06.200]  This is the UN globalist takeover.
[57:06.200 --> 57:09.440]  Bill and Linda Gates admit themselves.
[57:09.440 --> 57:14.640]  He joins us live next hour.
[57:14.640 --> 57:22.280]  Now I know that over a million people on the Sunday show are tuned in right now.
[57:22.280 --> 57:25.320]  What happens if you get excited and get angry and take action and call friends and family
[57:25.320 --> 57:28.840]  and tell them to an end of band on video and in full wars dot com ports last show to this
[57:28.840 --> 57:30.000]  live Sunday show.
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.280]  What happens if you send them text message?
[57:31.280 --> 57:32.280]  What do you say?
[57:32.280 --> 57:36.960]  Hey, a major health care worker is about to expose the fraud of COVID-19 and JPMorgan
[57:36.960 --> 57:39.160]  admits COVID-19 lockdown is a fraud.
[57:39.160 --> 57:41.400]  Would you take action to be free?
[57:41.400 --> 57:42.520]  You are the answer.
[57:42.520 --> 57:43.720]  This isn't some side issue.
[57:43.720 --> 57:48.240]  You are Optimus Prime.
[57:48.240 --> 57:52.920]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[57:52.920 --> 57:56.280]  The globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and they're
[57:56.280 --> 57:59.040]  like, yeah, you're taking implantable chips.
[57:59.040 --> 58:00.800]  Yeah, we're into pedophilia.
[58:00.800 --> 58:02.640]  Yeah, we're into world government.
[58:02.640 --> 58:04.600]  Yeah, you're obsolete.
[58:04.600 --> 58:06.600]  You are non-essential.
[58:06.600 --> 58:08.320]  We are shutting your ass down.
[58:08.320 --> 58:13.320]  Yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[58:13.320 --> 58:14.920]  You're going to be the service economy.
[58:14.920 --> 58:19.320]  And now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and you're
[58:19.320 --> 58:24.360]  obsolete so you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income so they
[58:24.360 --> 58:26.000]  can dictate your life.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.640]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[58:28.640 --> 58:33.040]  We have to resist and say no to the new world order and that takes you understanding you
[58:33.040 --> 58:37.360]  were right and understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and raising the
[58:37.360 --> 58:40.240]  alarm now while you still can.
[58:40.240 --> 58:42.040]  Now is the time for action.
[58:42.040 --> 58:49.080]  Now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[58:49.080 --> 58:52.200]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship.
[58:52.200 --> 58:58.880]  The lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights being suspended and
[58:58.880 --> 59:05.480]  a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Bill and the Gates Foundation in full
[59:05.480 --> 59:07.080]  control.
[59:07.080 --> 59:12.800]  Many will submit through fear others will be bought off but in the end the globalists
[59:12.800 --> 59:18.560]  admit they're building a post human world and now that we're inside the cage it's going
[59:18.560 --> 59:22.880]  to move very very quickly into its end game.
[59:22.880 --> 59:28.880]  Submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our
[59:28.880 --> 59:35.360]  own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing
[59:35.360 --> 59:36.360]  this.
[59:36.360 --> 59:41.120]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being poured inside out.
[59:41.120 --> 59:46.480]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfish
[59:46.480 --> 59:52.000]  disgusting power trip.
[59:52.000 --> 1:00:06.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:11.320]  There have been hundreds of doctors, medical workers, nurses come out and tell them what
[1:00:11.320 --> 1:00:13.320]  they're seeing.
[1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:17.640]  Many of them have come out, I've seen probably 20 doctors at least you've seen them too and
[1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:20.360]  they always get taken off of you too, they always get taken off Facebook, they get taken
[1:00:20.360 --> 1:00:27.320]  down everywhere saying yeah this whole lady came in dying of heart failure at 90 years
[1:00:27.320 --> 1:00:31.840]  old they put COVID-19 on the deal and doctors saying we get pressured by the hospital first
[1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:38.640]  time ever to say COVID-19 it's a car wreck.
[1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:45.000]  But let's go to this little piece ahead of Josiah Dan joining us of myself at the shooting
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:48.880]  range day with the crew had a little bit of fun and I channeled, I was possessed by Bill
[1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:55.760]  Gates at the end, here is that report we'll go to break and then we'll come back with
[1:00:55.760 --> 1:01:00.600]  Josiah Dan unfiltered live broadcasting worldwide.
[1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:04.560]  Alex Jones here in Austin, Texas is my buddy Tim and he's a little bit better shot than
[1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:05.560]  I am with handguns.
[1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:09.960]  I'm a pretty good shot with most handguns in Revolver but with this 5th and Weston 500
[1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:15.760]  I bought about four years ago I just can't seem to hit the side of a barn door and yes
[1:01:15.760 --> 1:01:19.880]  a lot of people claim that handguns and rifles have big kicks I've not experienced that even
[1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:23.720]  hand holding, bare with the cows and shooting them repeatedly but this baby does hurt my
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:27.040]  wrist so hopefully he can show me how to shoot more accurately and how to not hurt my wrist
[1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:34.760]  so first I'm going to shoot it how I normally would and then Tim do they give me some tips.
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:38.280]  I'm going to clap my teeth I'm going to be a wimp today, you've seen me shoot once now
[1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:39.280]  Tim can't.
[1:01:39.280 --> 1:01:48.960]  We're going to test out this made in China double barrel shotgun if anything ever is
[1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:52.880]  going to blow up in your face this is it's we pray to the good lord it doesn't happen.
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:54.040]  Pretty fun.
[1:01:54.040 --> 1:02:01.240]  It was so close the wanting went through except for a few pellets up.
[1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:04.080]  That's a good group.
[1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:10.440]  Greg Reese from Infowars.com just got kind of my dream gun right here it is a Galil
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:19.320]  Ace pistol in 556 Israel IWI Middletown PA very excited this will be my first time shooting
[1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:24.520]  it I just rough sighted in with a laser barrel or sight and now we're going to see how the
[1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:25.520]  sights are here.
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:52.320]  So the idea Tim is to hit the head not the body it's like the body is a hostage I'm
[1:02:52.320 --> 1:03:10.840]  going to try to shoot the bad skeleton man and not the hostage.
[1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:15.320]  First I was dead on only hitting the hostage taker until I realized there were too many
[1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:19.680]  people that Bill Gates and the Clintons and others are right Jeffrey Epstein is right
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:24.040]  everybody has to die including the children that's why I decided to go ahead and kill
[1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:28.400]  this archetypal child to save the earth from humans both the adults and the children must
[1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:34.720]  die hail Bill Gates hail the post human error death to all we need more child death things
[1:03:34.720 --> 1:03:50.840]  like producing child to death things like producing child to death things like producing
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:55.040]  it's one of the biggest sales of the year and we were already running a huge sale or

[1:04:58.040 --> 1:05:03.040]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporates media and the chai comms
[1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:09.640]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression fact we're already into the worldwide depression
[1:05:09.640 --> 1:05:14.440]  in the death sentence for the third world but it's critical to understand that the longer
[1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:21.160]  the shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will destroy decades
[1:05:21.160 --> 1:05:25.120]  of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we've always said it's
[1:05:25.120 --> 1:05:29.520]  important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want
[1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:35.320]  to make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this
[1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:41.560]  so remember how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[1:05:41.560 --> 1:05:47.120]  things before they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan
[1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:51.920]  and yes it's dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out
[1:05:51.920 --> 1:05:56.440]  is a thousand times more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really
[1:05:56.440 --> 1:06:06.560]  happening.
[1:06:06.560 --> 1:06:16.240]  We are 69 days out from the homeland security cdc announcement that's over two months of
[1:06:16.240 --> 1:06:22.720]  complete lockdown and already the global depression has begun Josiah Dan is a registered nurse
[1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:27.760]  for over 20 years experience working in healthcare industry and he gave a very powerful speech
[1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:31.440]  that's posted to bandodvideo and info wars dot com it's being banned off youtube other
[1:06:31.440 --> 1:06:36.480]  platforms anything viral medical doctors and others exposing the fraud they get banned
[1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:40.320]  but here's the conclusion of what he had to say and we'll go to him live on this sunday
[1:06:40.320 --> 1:07:06.440]  transmission so here is Josiah Dan this is for all of us we stand at a precipice and
[1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:12.320]  this torrent is actively washing over all that we hold sacred our families our heritage
[1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:20.040]  our faith and our freedom by god our very way of life we allow ourselves to be washed
[1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:25.480]  over the edge into the fathomless desolate pit of tyranny oppression degradation and
[1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:30.880]  moral decay or do we fight the flowing current and grasp others along the way to get back
[1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:40.520]  to the shores of liberty justice and the american way with a great almighty lord in heaven as
[1:07:40.520 --> 1:07:46.840]  my witness i will not go plunging over the edge without fighting for every last breath
[1:07:46.840 --> 1:07:52.000]  striving with every ounce of my being to arrive on the other side for the sake of my child
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:08:08.480]  my wife my family my people my nation and my god all right Josiah Dan joins us now
[1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:12.520]  to talk about the situation and you know where he lives and what he's witnessing and what
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:17.760]  he sees unfolding but but just remember when i was talking to Joe Rogan last thursday that's
[1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:22.880]  big international news now what was the final straw for him to leave youtube it was that
[1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:27.840]  they were banning doctors and nurses and others that came out and said look at the cdc's own
[1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:32.120]  numbers this thing kills less than the flu so what is this all really well they now
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:37.960]  admit from brazil to europe it's about shutting down capitalist countries and it's the blue
[1:08:37.960 --> 1:08:43.240]  cities and blue states the communist states so they reverse the colors that do this but
[1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:48.200]  you see his full speech at connecticut rn speaks out about tyranny and the covet hoax that's
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:55.120]  that news wars dot com but joining us now is mr dan joseph thanks for coming on with
[1:08:55.120 --> 1:09:01.680]  us one of the few platforms that is free thank you one of the few platforms that is free
[1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:05.800]  so that people like you actually have a platform what are you before you get into why you went
[1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:09.080]  public and why you're speaking out what's happened since you went public was a viral
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:14.000]  what do you make of the attempt to silence medical professionals in america and europe
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  from your speech i think that there's a lot of things going on with media outlets to suppress
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:28.600]  truth because once people figure out what's true you can't just stand around and do nothing
[1:09:28.600 --> 1:09:35.280]  anymore and so they're really preventing the flow of truth come from basically anywhere
[1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:39.600]  i can ask a lot of questions but where do we start what was your process of waking up
[1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:44.600]  or going to a rally or speaking out of what is your overall view on where we currently
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:55.040]  are my view on how i got to where i am is that i support lots of different organizations
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:10:00.320]  like open states and convention of states and that's actually how i found out about
[1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:05.240]  the rally that i attended was i got an email from open states about a connecticut liberty
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:08.560]  rally and i was like oh i'm really interested in checking this out so i talked to my wife
[1:10:08.560 --> 1:10:13.960]  and she was comparable to going with me because we have a six month old child now and so we
[1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:19.040]  attended the event and i heard some speakers say things that i knew were true and it was
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:24.800]  about everything going on and i was really appreciative of the event and the people that
[1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:31.040]  spoke there and so i went and talked to the gentleman that had sponsored and started the
[1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:38.520]  event and the organization itself connecticut liberty dot com and she had a conversation
[1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:43.880]  with him about being able to speak because my wife inspired me to get up there and actually
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:53.040]  do something rather than just be a passive you know watcher could you imagine five years
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:59.360]  ago even a year ago hearing oh if doctors or nurses get up and say what they've seen
[1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:03.920]  they'll be banned on youtube they'll be banned on facebook because it's on record if the president
[1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:08.240]  tweets what a doctor says they'll they'll ban it saying well that's not what the un
[1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:16.360]  says i mean this is getting crazy yeah um so about three years ago may three four years
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:23.160]  ago um my uh i had an event happened in my family where my mother was diagnosed with cancer
[1:11:23.160 --> 1:11:31.120]  and uh i it drove me to search out alternate methods of uh of treatment and uh it was at
[1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:35.000]  that time that i really realized that there's a lot of censorship when it comes to actual
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:39.720]  like health freedom and understanding the truth about how your body works and that there
[1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:44.440]  are people out there medical professionals out there doctors uh that treat things a different
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:49.960]  way and that they actually don't have a platform to do so in states in this country uh like
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:55.320]  texas and california have actually made it very difficult for medical practitioners to
[1:11:55.320 --> 1:12:01.080]  to do things that appear to be unorthodox even though they have uh statistical validity in
[1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:06.280]  in what they're actually doing um so five years ago yeah i probably would have thought
[1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:13.080]  no it's crazy three four years ago i had a very different opinion and that's kind of
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:17.400]  some of the things that started to open my eyes about what to look into and i'm a digger
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:23.480]  i uh spent a lot of time in nursing school uh digging through resources online in books
[1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:27.880]  um i used to piss my wife off a lot because i would stay up to three four in the morning
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:33.800]  finding detailed information about things that i thought were kind of crazy at the time um so
[1:12:34.840 --> 1:12:40.360]  yeah that search for knowledge it's like when you find the un's own website with thousands of pages
[1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:45.960]  about sterilization vaccines they're testing on people all over the world yeah and then you
[1:12:45.960 --> 1:12:50.280]  turn to the news they go oh that's a conspiracy and you're on the un's website and they admit they're
[1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:57.000]  doing it yeah yeah it's it's craziness uh and there there are things that over the past 10 years
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:03.640]  since i went to nursing school and uh uh graduated i uh that that was kind of the event that made
[1:13:03.640 --> 1:13:08.280]  me really start looking at health care issues because i was learning about it in school and
[1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:12.840]  learning about how to care for patients well um and i had questions about why i was expected to
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:19.720]  do particular things for myself uh like like flu shots like i i don't receive a flu shot um i choose
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:24.920]  not to uh for my own medical reasons because i understand spend a few minutes on that without
[1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:34.920]  me just blurting out why i i mean that's better um so uh when you receive a flu shot uh the the
[1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:40.360]  purpose of it at least what we're told is to try and protect the community at large from uh from
[1:13:40.360 --> 1:13:46.120]  receiving the flu uh as a virus and having any detrimental impacts from it um and as a medical
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:50.920]  professional they tell us like this is your duty to receive this vaccine so that you're protecting
[1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:57.400]  your patients um and in and so doing you're benefiting the community at large not just in the
[1:13:57.400 --> 1:14:04.280]  hospital but outside of the hospital and society um but when you look into research on the flu
[1:14:04.280 --> 1:14:11.800]  vaccine itself um you come to an understanding that things aren't as clear as what they tell you
[1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:19.000]  they are um so if you receive multiple seasons of flu shots you actually so say you get a flu
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:24.120]  shot two years in a row you're more likely to actually get the flu on year three than you would
[1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:27.560]  have been if you had never gotten a flu shot in the first place and you're actually more likely to
[1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:33.080]  have a more detrimental impact on your system um than you would if you'd never received the flu
[1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:39.160]  shot and it's because you're actually not receiving uh the conferrence of immunity from natural exposure
[1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:47.240]  um so when you're exposed to a flu virus you're exposed to it and your body recognizes it
[1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:52.760]  it defends itself it defeats it and then you get conferred immunity to yourself which is
[1:14:52.760 --> 1:14:57.800]  what we're talking about is like natural herd immunity um when you receive a vaccine you receive
[1:14:57.800 --> 1:15:05.880]  a small snippet of that um virus and it doesn't have the whole stranding out there to allow your
[1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:11.880]  body to recognize that there are you know more bits of DNA or RNA depending on what kind of
[1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:18.680]  infection you're talking about um and so you don't get um the conferred immunity to all the different
[1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:22.600]  or multiple different variants. Exactly it never works the studies show that lowers your overall
[1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:27.400]  immunity and then they can add trojan horses or have mistakes and they have liability protection
[1:15:27.400 --> 1:15:32.520]  it just works from there so let me ask you this when we come back where do you see all this going
[1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:37.320]  because you have the UN coming out last December admitting okay vaccines are hurting people there's
[1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:41.800]  been a cover-up what are we going to do and now you see this big explosion this big takeover now
[1:15:41.800 --> 1:15:48.280]  they have the mRNA vaccines actually go into the cell and change the body's makeup so there seems to
[1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:53.960]  be a failing forward a panic because they're being exposed to just power grab all of reality
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:16:01.400]  now it's official the United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will
[1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:07.560]  last five years and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll
[1:16:07.560 --> 1:16:12.360]  be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a
[1:16:12.360 --> 1:16:18.280]  list of 10 people that you visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently
[1:16:18.280 --> 1:16:24.040]  detained yes ladies and gentlemen this is the new world order where they let the criminals out of
[1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:31.160]  jail the rapists the child molesters the murderers and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner
[1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:36.360]  from the beginning of my research it was clear the globalist are an authoritarian anti-human group
[1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:41.880]  they have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game which
[1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:49.480]  is global depopulation so you see submitting to them is death the only way to stop them is to
[1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:55.720]  expose them to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy wake up or die
[1:16:58.280 --> 1:17:03.800]  we're living in insanely dangerous times and i've told folks going back three months ago i'm not
[1:17:03.800 --> 1:17:07.560]  buying storeable food because i'm worried about the COVID-19 virus i'm worried about the food
[1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:12.600]  shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:17.000]  already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the united states and
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:21.320]  that's even worse in the third world so i hope trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix
[1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:26.520]  it but with the election fraud and the COVID-19 all the wars and the third world collapsing
[1:17:26.520 --> 1:17:31.800]  and everything else is going on now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25
[1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:36.840]  years they're in easily totable bags it's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked

[1:19:09.640 --> 1:19:16.120]  the future of humanity and now open world government is being established with an end game
[1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:23.400]  to depopulate the planet now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized
[1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:29.720]  you must decide which side you're on living in denial having mass Stockholm syndrome
[1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:35.000]  learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery destruction and finally death
[1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:41.000]  and this is a spiritual death we're talking about not just a physical death the delusions
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:47.560]  must end now info wars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy
[1:19:48.120 --> 1:19:51.240]  most people that are aware of the new world will decide to join it out of fear
[1:19:51.240 --> 1:20:02.440]  they are truly fools we must fight this or lose our souls you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:02.440 --> 1:20:15.800]  is our guest we are live
[1:20:18.600 --> 1:20:27.080]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones so if you had a sheet of say 20
[1:20:27.080 --> 1:20:34.360]  checkboxes for tyranny COVID-19 clicks them all a world currency a tracking system a way to get
[1:20:34.360 --> 1:20:40.440]  rid of cash a way to control people's movements a way to go after their free speech the list just
[1:20:40.440 --> 1:20:48.520]  goes on and on and on and on and now we're told oh if it's not the WHO who's fun about the bill
[1:20:48.520 --> 1:20:53.720]  mill and the gates foundation that are a front for vaccine companies that have been given liability
[1:20:53.720 --> 1:20:59.160]  protection well you don't have that speech so now hundreds of medical doctors and nurses that
[1:20:59.160 --> 1:21:03.080]  have come out talk about their practices and their patients and what they've seen they've
[1:21:03.080 --> 1:21:08.680]  been silenced what was it like for you joseph dana again a nurse that gave a speech a few days ago
[1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:16.680]  that's gone viral what was it like for you to watch all these many of them well known cedar
[1:21:16.680 --> 1:21:21.800]  cyanide probably the top hospital in the u.s. arguably came out and said trump's right we
[1:21:21.800 --> 1:21:27.240]  have light therapy for viruses in the lungs that they just banned their youtube channel i mean
[1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:33.960]  what's behind that what was it like watching that for you um like i said it's a suppression of truth
[1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:39.400]  it's a suppression of peer reviewed data um when you realize that there are treatments out there
[1:21:39.400 --> 1:21:44.120]  that are effective for things and you tell people that they don't exist or that it's craziness or
[1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:48.520]  quackery even though you know that the data actually demonstrates that there's truth and
[1:21:48.520 --> 1:21:55.240]  reality to how they how they function uh we as citizens of this country particularly but
[1:21:55.240 --> 1:22:00.760]  citizens of the world that see these things we should severely start to question our governing
[1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:06.440]  authorities the governing authorities of organizations like the cdc and the fda and the
[1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:13.960]  who because there are there are problems with their uh authority figures many of their authority
[1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:20.760]  figures go back and forth between industry and then as regulators so if you're ahead of the cdc
[1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:26.120]  and you work for a pharmaceutical company and then you become the head of the cdc well you have a
[1:22:26.120 --> 1:22:30.040]  bent that is different than someone that never worked for a pharmaceutical company and then
[1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:34.360]  if you go back to the pharmaceutical industry after you've worked for the cdc for a couple of years
[1:22:34.360 --> 1:22:40.280]  you know your likelihood to um advocate at the cdc for a particular vaccine it's a total
[1:22:40.280 --> 1:22:45.960]  revolving door look at Fauci he's not just involved with the vaccine company making all this money
[1:22:45.960 --> 1:22:50.440]  he got a hundred million dollars for bill monegates just last year he helped run drills for the
[1:22:50.440 --> 1:22:59.080]  takeover and then he's heavily involved controlling nih funding under obama to the very woohan lab on
[1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:09.480]  covid 19 chimera viruses i mean wow yeah that's crazy it's it's insanity so as a registered nurse
[1:23:09.480 --> 1:23:13.080]  working i mean what are the other nurses and doctors i mean what percentage of them are saying
[1:23:13.080 --> 1:23:17.880]  yeah this is bs because most of the ones i talked to are just like yeah this is way overblown
[1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:26.520]  um so i think i think very differently than most of my peers um there are some people that
[1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:31.160]  question things they're questioning about this particular event uh some people are and i wouldn't
[1:23:31.160 --> 1:23:37.720]  say the majority of them are i've had conversations with some of my peers that are uh more advanced
[1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:44.200]  in their education than myself uh being pa's or uh in other levels of health care uh that are
[1:23:44.200 --> 1:23:51.560]  questioning like why are we doing all this stuff uh to to limit people's um ability to move around
[1:23:51.560 --> 1:23:57.160]  and to get in contact with other people uh they they ask those types of questions because the
[1:23:57.160 --> 1:24:01.640]  data doesn't seem to make much sense with what's happening with exactly here it is right here
[1:24:01.640 --> 1:24:06.360]  lockdowns failed the ultra course of pandemic jp morgan study claims why do you think it's
[1:24:06.360 --> 1:24:10.280]  areas with the lockdowns that have the highest death rates because jp morgan's done the numbers
[1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:17.560]  with their big supercomputers and they say it's a fraud yeah um so yeah like i said that the people
[1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:25.400]  that question uh but are probably fewer uh in the health care community um than the majority you
[1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:29.320]  know i mean like there's the majority of people don't question exactly what's going on they kind of
[1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:34.920]  get caught up in the hysteria and the uh they look to the cdc and they take what the cdc's
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:39.640]  recommendations are and don't actually look at the fact that well the cdc as a governing
[1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:43.880]  organization is supposed to dispense good information so you're taught in medical school
[1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:49.480]  or in nursing school to trust what the cdc says and unless you're doing what i'm doing um and
[1:24:49.480 --> 1:24:54.760]  digging around uh you don't actually have a reason necessarily to question until you see
[1:24:54.760 --> 1:24:59.880]  something blatant like what's happening with with this like we know that the cdc sent out test kits
[1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:06.680]  that were had problems that were either contaminated with the virus um or uh were not giving us
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:11.240]  accurate data and that started to make medical professionals question well what's going on at
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:17.320]  the cdc that this is actually happening um and you know you got the president of tans and me are
[1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:22.680]  receiving testing kits and then you're getting goats testing positive for covid 19 which okay
[1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:26.360]  that might happen because it's potentially an animal disease but why the heck is a piece of fruit
[1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:33.000]  pop off fruit positive for covid 19 that guy's a famous biologist he figured the un funding was
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:37.560]  fraudulent so he said the papaya and goat to get tested and the kits found they were positive showing
[1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:43.640]  they want the highest number possible in these tests i agree i i i agree in general with that yes
[1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:49.800]  have since your video went viral at the speech you gave about reopening the economy have you
[1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:56.840]  gotten any negative feedback uh from who well no i mean if you got any trouble at work or
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:26:01.960]  anything happened since your video got millions of years i've been trying to not be very vocal
[1:26:01.960 --> 1:26:07.400]  about it at work i've had some people come to me and congratulate me on what i said um personally
[1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:15.000]  i at this point in time my wife has been furloughed uh from uh her position and i'm the only breadwinner
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:20.200]  uh right now in the home so i don't want to make a bad spot for myself and get fired hey listen
[1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:24.680]  you're an american you have a right to come out as a citizen not about your job you have a right to
[1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:31.320]  say as a citizen what you think of covid 19 that is true uh but i also don't want when i when i
[1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:37.080]  announced in my speech who i was i made sure that i said i'm not speaking for any corporation
[1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:41.240]  or organization and i don't know that makes sense well they come back as a citizen but also as
[1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:45.400]  somebody that's informed that i want to give you a chance to give a short speech again about
[1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:50.360]  just the viewers about your points instead of me asking questions then i've got some other
[1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:53.880]  important points i want to hit as well but i gotta tell you folks that's why we're live here on this

[1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:08.440]  common sense and now as we learn the democrats never want to reopen cities and socialists and
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:13.000]  communists don't want to open cities anywhere in the world it's really an incredible time

[1:30:07.880 --> 1:30:14.840]  were kept at a subsistence starving level for control in fact in most cultures they call the
[1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:20.360]  peasants the little people because they were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and
[1:30:20.360 --> 1:30:26.840]  ladies because they kept them again at a starving level they were so busy trying to survive they
[1:30:26.840 --> 1:30:31.880]  would never try to challenge the entrenched elite well now all the big google owners and the rockel

[1:32:40.520 --> 1:32:43.720]  he's here with us talking about why he did it on this live sunday show
[1:32:45.640 --> 1:32:48.360]  but pulling back and just believing it's the most deadly thing since
[1:32:48.360 --> 1:32:56.760]  death it's the grim reaper on wheels it's blue cities and blue states and communists and socialist
[1:32:56.760 --> 1:33:01.800]  countries that are using this for a permanent martial law lockdown that the the projections
[1:33:01.800 --> 1:33:05.080]  were millions dead not a hundred thousand dead they're putting the names of other people that
[1:33:05.080 --> 1:33:10.280]  die of other things on it we know it's a fraud and they said oh 15 days to bend the curve and
[1:33:10.840 --> 1:33:14.840]  flatten the curve and make sure the hospitals could have beds it turns out the hospitals are
[1:33:14.840 --> 1:33:19.640]  empty pretty much and now they tell us it's about getting rid of president trump and
[1:33:19.640 --> 1:33:23.800]  getting rid of capitalism and the new green deal and saving the earth speak to that
[1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:29.720]  mr dan and any other points you want to make you've got the floor here the next nine minutes
[1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:36.840]  all right um so first off what i would like to say is uh regarding my comments before the
[1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:42.840]  vaccines i uh i am for vaccine freedom of choice uh i'm not going to tell you what to do with your
[1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:49.000]  body um but i i would gladly give you information as to how to make a good choice when it comes to
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:54.600]  choosing if you're going to vaccinate yourself for anything my my first word of advice would be
[1:33:54.600 --> 1:34:01.080]  to read vaccine pamphlets uh read what's in the vaccines and read what they say about what can
[1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:05.160]  happen in your body because they're required to give you that information uh when you receive a
[1:34:05.160 --> 1:34:10.200]  vaccine most most facilities they don't necessarily give you the vaccine pamphlet that comes with
[1:34:10.200 --> 1:34:16.040]  the vaccine vial out of the box they'll give you a small informational leaflet but ask for the actual
[1:34:16.040 --> 1:34:21.560]  pamphlet read the information and make your own self determining choice because we're all
[1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:27.640]  rational adults and when it comes to our kids we're making our best decision as to what we think
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:32.120]  should be done with our child's lives and our trials are our children are the next generation
[1:34:32.120 --> 1:34:36.840]  that are going to uh take over when when we're not alive anymore we want them to be able to
[1:34:36.840 --> 1:34:43.400]  function effectively in society that includes being uh not mentally handicapped and potentially
[1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:48.840]  autistic or having uh mood disorders or a number of other things that may actually be a byproduct
[1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:55.800]  of uh over vaccination in general um the direction that you had asked about before where i see things
[1:34:55.800 --> 1:35:02.040]  are going uh i mean i'm a religious guy i'm a christian uh i look at what what the bible says
[1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:08.600]  and i kind of evaluate things that i see in society based on my uh my my beliefs uh what i see is
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:14.120]  true is happening around me and then i look at where's the bible say about it and uh i see
[1:35:14.120 --> 1:35:19.240]  some very interesting comparisons about what is prophesied in the old testament and book of
[1:35:19.240 --> 1:35:24.680]  revelation and uh i said i was gonna let you roll in a rub but you're so on target if the q people
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:28.440]  nothing against them a lot of great people they do some great work but whoever the supposed q
[1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:34.280]  people are i don't trust that the q followers a lot of a lot of like you know nice folks if q
[1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:40.600]  was one tenth as on target as jesus christ and john the revelator i would be following it i mean
[1:35:40.600 --> 1:35:45.320]  what jesus said and what john revelator said is like it's not like we're having to twist it it matches
[1:35:45.320 --> 1:35:51.560]  exactly every time yeah i did that's that's the craziness and that's what i was getting at is
[1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:56.600]  like you know when you see somebody advocating publicly to the entire nation and to actually
[1:35:56.600 --> 1:36:02.520]  the entire world um stating that you know we want to tattoo you with a nanoparticle tattoo
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:07.000]  so we can track you and make sure that you're healthy but also is going to you know contain all
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:11.960]  of your personal information potentially your banking information uh we might tie it to an
[1:36:11.960 --> 1:36:16.360]  electronic currency because you know what you can get sick from passing around paper currency so
[1:36:16.360 --> 1:36:21.400]  we're gonna eliminate that and use everything electronically and and they cut the MIT scientists
[1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:27.560]  going bill gates hired us to have this chip that you know gets in the skin and i mean exactly it's
[1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:33.240]  all happening yep yep and you know in the book of revelation it says this is going to be a mark
[1:36:33.240 --> 1:36:39.400]  placed on people's wrists and or hands and forehead and so there's direct linkages between what you see
[1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:44.280]  in the the bible and what you see is happening currently in society and it's pretty wild to
[1:36:44.280 --> 1:36:48.760]  see it happening in my lifetime and those that are lazy will take it right on the head those
[1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:54.440]  that aren't will be on the wrist yeah yeah uh who knows what that headpiece is gonna look like but
[1:36:54.440 --> 1:36:58.120]  i think it has a lot to do with what we think you know what i mean like this mark on the head
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:04.680]  is potentially like what do you actually well yeah maybe it's a chip but no i'm not understand the
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:10.120]  mark is your social credit score you exactly your brain your action must agree to them that
[1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:16.120]  means your head is in action with them and your your motion and your and your dynamic is in is in
[1:37:16.120 --> 1:37:22.920]  league you're following in step with what the world system wants you to do which is what the
[1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:28.440]  bill gates patent says is will be tracked by 5g or every movement and will be paid money according
[1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:35.000]  to following orders exactly yeah uh yep so yeah i mean that's definitely the direction i see things
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:41.560]  going and i hope that um my willingness to stand up and say things about what is true um what i see
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:49.320]  happening in society around me and looking at the history of my country um and what what happened with
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:53.880]  the writing of the declaration of independence and the writing of the constitution and subsequently
[1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:59.240]  the bill of rights that gives us a lot of uh abilities to protect ourselves from federal
[1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:03.720]  and state government overreach uh looking at what's happening with that and seeing that we're
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:08.600]  having those things destroyed and advocated particularly by the left that we get rid of them
[1:38:08.600 --> 1:38:13.560]  and some on the right doing the same thing uh i think we need to really evaluate who we're voting
[1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:19.000]  for number one uh number two we need to educate ourselves and remember our history and that's
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:23.160]  what my next speech which i'm going to plug right now uh is going to be about so if anybody wants to
[1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:27.880]  come out and videotape me again uh i'm going to be presenting another speech at the connecticut
[1:38:27.880 --> 1:38:36.680]  liberty rally uh on uh saturday is coming saturday 5 30 um so that being the date um and i think this
[1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:42.120]  speech is going to be even more poignant than the first one that i gave um and there's a lot of good
[1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:47.000]  information in this speech there's a lot of things to hopefully make people think about and analyze
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:53.160]  what's happening in our society and we need to think about what's best not just for you know the
[1:38:53.160 --> 1:38:59.000]  community of people that we live in what is actually good for us as individuals for human beings
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:03.720]  for us as family units because that's where society starts the foundation of the family well
[1:39:03.720 --> 1:39:09.160]  exactly they're building a post-human world saying humans are bad and people going along with this thing
[1:39:09.160 --> 1:39:13.560]  is for a greater good they're heroes no they're not you're going along with a deindustrialization
[1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:19.320]  plan that makes humans obsolete the globalists admit their own words and they they're now admitting
[1:39:19.320 --> 1:39:24.440]  oh this is about the new green deal this is about the post-human world this is about cutting
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:30.040]  carbon footprint this is about you can't travel if you're non-essential and the establishment decides
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:34.600]  who is non-essential that's beyond racism it's the ultimate form of tyranny
[1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:40.440]  yep and we we still have a constitution and we still got a bill of rights and uh you know that
[1:39:40.440 --> 1:39:44.200]  declaration of independence told us a lot of information about what happened in britain
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:49.080]  and look at what's happening now so but if we don't enforce it it's a dead letter and that's
[1:39:49.080 --> 1:39:54.520]  what you're saying is we've got to enforce this we as we as citizens in this country need to get
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:59.400]  off of our butts and stop sleeping we need to realize that they're trying to destroy the very
[1:39:59.400 --> 1:40:05.080]  foundations of who we are as a country and subvert our sovereign authority to a global
[1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:10.920]  governance board that makes zero sense what do you make a bold scenario coming out and saying
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:15.080]  he has his own communist cities they're just locking everything down arresting mothers
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:19.240]  trying to sell fruit for their kids to eat and he's ordering the police stop arresting them
[1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:25.800]  or i'm gonna arrest you i mean this is crazy uh you know what i think you guys should listen
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:31.800]  to my next speech i'm gonna give you a little excerpt of uh a little teaser uh so what it
[1:40:31.800 --> 1:40:35.880]  is going to partly contain um and then you can kind of ask me another question if you want all
[1:40:35.880 --> 1:40:41.960]  right uh so these are the abuses and the usurpations of which we speak the will of the people has been
[1:40:41.960 --> 1:40:47.560]  usurped and the voice of our representatives in the state my state of connecticut uh our stores
[1:40:47.560 --> 1:40:52.200]  have been closed our livelihoods declared no i had to do this as a cliffhanger we have a couple
[1:40:52.200 --> 1:40:56.280]  breaks an hour they fired a certain time come back start over with the speech you're going to give

[1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:52.680]  show i love each and every one of you all this great crew from savannah to zack to scott everybody
[1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:58.920]  else you're awesome the panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and
[1:41:58.920 --> 1:42:06.280]  the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're already into the worldwide
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:11.240]  depression and the death sentence for the third world but it's critical to understand that the
[1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:18.600]  longer the shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will destroy decades of
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:22.760]  wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we've always said it's important to
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:28.520]  be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent
[1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:34.040]  so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this so remember how does
[1:42:34.040 --> 1:42:39.400]  infall wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they
[1:42:39.400 --> 1:42:44.920]  happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes it's
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:50.280]  dystopian and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more
[1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:56.440]  scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening now it's official the united
[1:42:56.440 --> 1:43:02.600]  nations came out yesterday and said the covet emergency will last five years and the uk government
[1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:08.200]  said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:13.720]  social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit and if you go
[1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:20.280]  outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently detained yes ladies and gentlemen this is the new
[1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:25.400]  world order where they let the criminals out of jail the rapists the child molesters the murderers
[1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:31.560]  and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner from the beginning of my research it was clear
[1:43:31.560 --> 1:43:37.000]  the globalist are an authoritarian anti-human group they have to put this electronic straight
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:42.760]  jacket on us before they carry out their in game which is global depopulation so you see
[1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:49.960]  submitting to them is death the only way to stop them is to expose them to hate their guts and
[1:43:49.960 --> 1:43:59.480]  realize they are humanity's mortal enemy wake up or die we are 170 days out from the 2020 election
[1:43:59.480 --> 1:44:05.960]  it is a referendum of national sovereignty against globalism and obama hillary and the deep state
[1:44:05.960 --> 1:44:11.480]  have been caught attempting to overthrow president trump's election and they've been caught in two
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:16.520]  separate coup attempts against the president now they've been pushing covet 19 to shut down the
[1:44:16.520 --> 1:44:20.520]  economy and create a depression while china has already been open for business for more than a
[1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:27.000]  month this is an ongoing globalist attempt to punish the american people wreck our economy
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:31.560]  and hope that we won't recognize that it is they the new world order that have orchestrated this
[1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:36.600]  and not president trump they know their crimes are coming out they know the chickens are coming
[1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:43.080]  home to roost so now they're panicking and trying to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots
[1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:49.800]  based on keeping the public safe from covet 19 the entire covet 19 system is a giant hopes
[1:44:49.800 --> 1:44:56.280]  and must be exposed if america has any hope so get out there and expose this fraud it took hundreds
[1:44:56.280 --> 1:45:02.280]  and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy to where it is every
[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:08.360]  economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months it is going to
[1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:14.200]  be a death sentence the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world and that
[1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:19.000]  the general public is going to go into deep deep debt to the mega banks but i'm going to have medical
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:27.400]  ID cards for synoculations we are now in a giant dystopia but a lot of people are waking up and
[1:45:27.400 --> 1:45:33.320]  there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny and we must all rediscover our
[1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:39.320]  bill of rights rediscover our constitution in our backbone and start saying no to people who take
[1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:44.840]  this moral high ground and say shut your business down shut your life down it'll save lives no it's
[1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:49.880]  caused millions to already starve to death tens of millions more so the cowards who went along
[1:45:49.880 --> 1:45:54.520]  with this with your virtues signaling you have destroyed your lives and our lives congratulations
[1:45:54.520 --> 1:46:11.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:20.920]  every time i sit down in front of this microphone and i realize that there are literally
[1:46:20.920 --> 1:46:29.640]  literally millions of people tuning in including our enemies i just think how do i explain to people
[1:46:29.640 --> 1:46:36.360]  i'm not up here trying to say this to scare you i'm just telling you what the globalists are really
[1:46:36.360 --> 1:46:44.280]  doing and for those of us like i'll be honest i mean like if i've got a buddy who's got a super
[1:46:44.280 --> 1:46:49.240]  hot wife i feel guilty that i'm sitting there at dinner with him just thinking my god this woman's
[1:46:49.240 --> 1:46:54.360]  hotter than hell and i feel guilty my wife's incredibly sexy but i mean god made me this way
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.960]  you know king david was less than people's wives i mean i i can't help but that's the
[1:46:57.960 --> 1:47:02.360]  kind of thing i have guilt about it's like women like just you know i'm even jealous that guys
[1:47:02.360 --> 1:47:07.320]  that have super hot wives or whatever i'm just kind of like i want your wife and i'm being honest
[1:47:07.320 --> 1:47:13.400]  about that i would never want to have power over people or make them poor so i felt big about it
[1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:21.080]  or put poison in their vaccines or enslave people but when you study globalists they want control
[1:47:21.080 --> 1:47:30.600]  over everybody i want prosperity i want freedom i want justice and other parts of me that are
[1:47:30.600 --> 1:47:36.120]  sinful and i admit are there i've got under control and i'm older now i'm not like i used to be but
[1:47:36.120 --> 1:47:42.040]  uh you know the point is is that i'm definitely a center and i'll admit it but when you study the
[1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:47.800]  globalists they're so evil that those of us that aren't like that we have a blind spot well you better
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:51.560]  get acquainted with the devil because he's acquainted with you and you better get acquainted
[1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:57.160]  with jesus because this is real folks and i got a big story out of him and get to nasa founds
[1:47:58.040 --> 1:48:04.840]  discovers parallel universe where time flows backwards we already told you all of this that's
[1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:12.440]  informed today this is a simulation it's a real simulation but it's controlled by god so i can
[1:48:12.440 --> 1:48:16.120]  rant and rave all day and there i just told everybody with any red-blooded man knows that we
[1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:24.280]  you know we love women it's just the final equation the church tells you all day that sin
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:28.440]  because they know every man sitting in the peuge has lost it after somebody's wife
[1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:35.480]  but they don't make it about banking cheating with christ beating the money changers they don't
[1:48:35.480 --> 1:48:41.640]  make it about enslaving people keeping them dumb to control them christ said several little
[1:48:41.640 --> 1:48:47.320]  children treat them as if they're me because i will destroy you that means not just children
[1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:53.240]  but people that aren't as smart as you we have to build people up when we are given more gifts
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:59.240]  than they are those gifts have been given to us to help others not to be used against them so that's
[1:48:59.240 --> 1:49:05.160]  my statement but but you my friend here with us the registered nurse up in connecticut who's
[1:49:05.160 --> 1:49:10.280]  gone super viral exposing this tyranny another big speech coming up this saturday uh mr dan

[1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:18.280]  speech ready i said give us the speech give us the speech now give us the prelude
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:23.880]  yeah i've been working on this one for uh since i gave the first speech i guess
[1:49:25.400 --> 1:49:31.080]  so here's an excerpt for you and i would uh i would love to uh have you listened to the
[1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:38.440]  full speech um when it gets posted okay well don't worry so these are the abuses and usurpations of
[1:49:38.440 --> 1:49:43.160]  which we speak the will and the voice of the people have been usurped as has the voice of our
[1:49:43.160 --> 1:49:48.440]  representatives in the great state of Connecticut our stores have been closed our livelihoods declared
[1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:55.240]  non-essential our personal finances put in shambles in our many cases uh completely decimated
[1:49:55.240 --> 1:50:00.280]  our our children have been forced out of our schools funded by our tax dollars and their
[1:50:00.280 --> 1:50:04.840]  access to the promise and guarantee of public education amidst their peers suspended for who
[1:50:04.840 --> 1:50:10.120]  knows how long we have been denied access to private businesses to which we would otherwise
[1:50:10.120 --> 1:50:14.600]  have regularly frequented many of which may never reopen having gone out of business is
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:19.960]  a byproduct of these usurpations the life's work of many of our small business owners and
[1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:25.640]  entrepreneurs have been destroyed or at least severely frustrated and drastically decreased
[1:50:25.640 --> 1:50:30.040]  the guaranteed rights of the people to peaceably assemble have been frustrated the freedom of
[1:50:30.040 --> 1:50:35.320]  religion to peaceably assemble has been unequally applied labeling churches and religious institutions
[1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:40.680]  non-essential while allowing corporate interests like Home Depot Walmart Burger King McDonald's etc
[1:50:40.680 --> 1:50:46.040]  to remain open for business the faithful have been denied access to sacraments while fast food
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:52.360]  vendors freely distribute food to purchase let me be very clear I am merely setting a precedent
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:57.560]  as to what has happened in our history by and yeah I didn't read this to you but it's about the
[1:50:57.560 --> 1:51:02.840]  the declaration of independence and we demand redress for our grievances and that logic and
[1:51:02.840 --> 1:51:07.480]  rational discourse take precedence over irrational media and government induced hysteria and
[1:51:07.480 --> 1:51:11.960]  fear mongering if churches be allowed to open the apparitioners forced to have temperature
[1:51:11.960 --> 1:51:16.920]  screenings and decreased capacity of meeting spaces then the equal application of the law
[1:51:16.920 --> 1:51:21.720]  would dictate that corporations be subjected to the same otherwise churches and religious
[1:51:21.720 --> 1:51:26.600]  centers would be unequally discriminated against and the law exactly sets the precedent to
[1:51:26.600 --> 1:51:34.200]  violate the first amendment there is no jurisdiction is a direct assault on the first amendment yep
[1:51:34.200 --> 1:51:39.160]  uh to the religious leaders of our communities the pastors priests preachers teachers rabbis
[1:51:39.160 --> 1:51:44.680]  clerics imams I have something to say in the movie the patriot there is a scene where a pastor
[1:51:44.680 --> 1:51:50.120]  removes his wig and declares a shepherd must tend his flock and at times fight off the wolves
[1:51:50.120 --> 1:51:54.440]  your flocks are being scattered and no longer graze in the fields that were common to them
[1:51:54.440 --> 1:51:59.160]  they are scattered in the orange spaces depicted on their television screens
[1:51:59.160 --> 1:52:04.840]  and the wolves are waiting at the gate please stand your choice stand with your flocks follow
[1:52:04.840 --> 1:52:09.800]  the president who not yesterday but the day before now play houses of worship essential
[1:52:09.800 --> 1:52:15.000]  and should open right now worship together as soon as possible follow the guidelines put open
[1:52:15.640 --> 1:52:20.280]  there is indeed an unseen and invisible enemy at work amongst this nation but it is not the
[1:52:20.280 --> 1:52:25.560]  coronavirus I would submit to you that it is fear spread through media outlets by often
[1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:31.480]  well-intended men and women in the division that seeks to prevail over us we all desire to attain
[1:52:31.480 --> 1:52:37.000]  safety and mutual respect to care for our loved ones and to make rational decisions as self-determining
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:44.520]  adults despite what you have been inspired to believe we are one human race one american people
[1:52:44.520 --> 1:52:51.800]  and one nation under god indivisible seeking liberty and justice for all that includes
[1:52:52.600 --> 1:52:57.400]  their salon owners and barbers and hairstylists mom and pop shops and home-based business
[1:52:57.400 --> 1:53:04.200]  everyone is essential yes businessmen in all sectors of the economically disenfranchised
[1:53:04.200 --> 1:53:09.800]  we are in your communities and we will frequent your businesses be your patrons and stand with
[1:53:09.800 --> 1:53:14.920]  you against the unconstitutional overreach of executive orders that keep you mentally barred
[1:53:14.920 --> 1:53:20.040]  from opening your business doors all right beautifully said well I like to build up the
[1:53:20.040 --> 1:53:24.040]  people that are in the grassroots having a big effect you've done a great job this is important
[1:53:24.040 --> 1:53:29.400]  as president trump or anybody else out there and I really appreciate you joining us mr dan we've
[1:53:29.400 --> 1:53:33.160]  only got about a minute or two left anything else you'd like to add the viewers and listeners out
[1:53:33.160 --> 1:53:37.960]  there on this live sunday show ahead of memorial day because a lot of people sacrificed their arms
[1:53:37.960 --> 1:53:41.640]  and legs and their bodies so we'd have some basic freedom and it's all being just thrown to the
[1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:50.680]  wayside like it's garbage that's right so first thing I'd like to say is anybody that's out there
[1:53:50.680 --> 1:53:55.800]  that is a christian I believe her in the lord Jesus christ and god I would ask for you to
[1:53:55.800 --> 1:54:00.440]  pray for me because I'm probably gonna get under some severe attacks after all this goes down I
[1:54:00.440 --> 1:54:05.160]  hope to not lose my job I hope to not have problems because I say things that my employer may not like
[1:54:05.160 --> 1:54:12.280]  even though I'm not mentioning who they are I I want to take care of my family I want to be a good
[1:54:12.280 --> 1:54:17.000]  dad and I want to be a good husband to my wife but you know you're gonna lose it all if you don't
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  speak out now and so other people left you're gonna lose it all we're gonna lose it all because
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:28.120]  playing it safe you've not played it safe but playing it safe was the old system now playing
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:36.200]  it safe is death so I would ask for your support that you would pray for me that would be a very
[1:54:36.200 --> 1:54:42.520]  big and I think that people that are listening here that are willing to spread this message
[1:54:43.080 --> 1:54:47.640]  need to do so share it in whatever way you can send it out via your email
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:53.720]  list that you have all your friends because you know what it's gonna get blocked on social media
[1:54:53.720 --> 1:54:58.680]  so send it out to you exactly don't just say that it's it's like the only way this dog hunts
[1:54:58.680 --> 1:55:03.320]  or the bird flies in the wind as you take action all right Josiah Dan thank you so much we'll talk
[1:55:03.320 --> 1:55:06.920]  to you again next week as this unfolds god bless you and we thank you for your time you're gonna be
[1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:12.840]  great thank you Alex thank you all right folks I'm out of time and I didn't hit the NASA news and
[1:55:12.840 --> 1:55:18.040]  I didn't hit the Joe Rogan news I didn't hit all the rest of we but but we hit most of it
[1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:23.400]  but great broadcast today want to thank the crew for the great job they've done
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:26.840]  want to thank the listeners and viewers and radio stations and TV stations that pick us up
[1:55:27.640 --> 1:55:30.440]  despite all the threats and all the demonization and all the lies
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:38.680]  that no we're just telling the truth we're standing up for what's right COVID-19 is a patented cold
[1:55:38.680 --> 1:55:43.960]  virus so that when they released it everybody would get it and they could make us all suspects
[1:55:43.960 --> 1:55:51.160]  so it is a real virus but why is it weaponized it's only man-made by the U.N. and Bellarmine
[1:55:51.160 --> 1:55:56.040]  will indicate to the chai comms so they can control the response to it and that's why now
[1:55:56.040 --> 1:56:03.240]  everybody gets infected and then anybody that dies of car wreck or being old they say is COVID-19
[1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:08.520]  that's the conspiracy we've cracked the code we know what they're doing and now Fauci's admitting
[1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:14.600]  open the economy because they know we're probably already in an irrevocable depression and so now
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:18.440]  they don't want to get to blame for keeping us shut that's when you know the goose is cooked
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:26.680]  when the U.N. goes open up now too late bitches that's not too late for us it's too late for you
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:33.400]  New World Order too late for Soros and Gigi Ping and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama you're the
[1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:39.560]  ones going to prison you're the one that get the blame you did it nobody listens to your horror
[1:56:39.560 --> 1:57:04.600]  media burn in hell goblers you
