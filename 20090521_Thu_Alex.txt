[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:32.520]  all right got a big show lined up for you today you know I didn't bug it just
[00:32.520 --> 00:37.040]  even turret last six months or so today was busy shooting three different TV
[00:37.040 --> 00:46.880]  pilots one of which I'm involved with at a certain level and also his wife had a
[00:46.880 --> 00:51.400]  family member dying of cancer and so he's a really busy guy so I want to give
[00:51.400 --> 00:54.200]  him some space to go down to Mexico do some surfing but he ended up never been
[00:54.200 --> 00:57.640]  able to go down there so I went ahead and called him up this morning and he
[00:57.640 --> 01:02.080]  said yeah I'll come on today but his schedule is such he's only gonna be on
[01:02.080 --> 01:06.760]  for 30 minutes and then coming up the Monday after next he'll be with us for a
[01:06.760 --> 01:12.000]  full hour to talk about a host of issues so former Minnesota governor Jesse
[01:12.000 --> 01:18.320]  Ventura who you've seen making the rounds on CNN Fox MSNBC the view talking
[01:18.320 --> 01:22.160]  about waterboarding you know actually we need to go pull up I know Aaron Dyches
[01:22.160 --> 01:26.840]  here he talked about he first told that waterboarding story driving around with
[01:26.840 --> 01:30.760]  us in the car we videotaped it and why don't think we ever even aired that we're
[01:30.760 --> 01:38.160]  Ventura Paul where Ventura tells the waterboarding story we asked Aaron to go
[01:38.160 --> 01:43.640]  grab that out of these computer files it's Jesse Ventura Aaron will have it
[01:43.640 --> 01:50.080]  it's Jesse Ventura when he was in Austin last October driving around with us in
[01:50.080 --> 01:55.920]  the car talking about how they were waterboarded in underwater demolition
[01:55.920 --> 02:01.960]  training because what they're escape and evasion or capture escape and evasion
[02:01.960 --> 02:09.680]  training I forget the exact name of it it's Sears training and just how you
[02:09.680 --> 02:12.560]  know completely worthless it would be to actually get real answers out of people
[02:12.560 --> 02:16.920]  all it's good for is getting false confession so I just hung up the phone
[02:16.920 --> 02:20.800]  with Ventura had a nice 15-minute discussion with him about a lot of
[02:20.800 --> 02:26.080]  stuff a lot of stuff behind the scenes we have not heard the last of for Minnesota
[02:26.080 --> 02:32.200]  governor Jesse Ventura movie star turned 9-11 truth or turned anti-New World
[02:32.200 --> 02:36.360]  Order activist and Ventura has now gone down the rabbit hole since I talked to
[02:36.360 --> 02:41.160]  him six months ago well I guess I talked to him in November too but five and a
[02:41.160 --> 02:49.720]  half six months ago and so he has definitely learned a lot more about the
[02:49.720 --> 02:56.560]  New World Order since I first gave him a copy of Terror Storm what was it two and
[02:56.560 --> 03:00.520]  a half three years ago Terror Storm had just come out and he was down here in
[03:00.520 --> 03:04.400]  Central Texas and had a chance to meet him and he'd already seen some of my
[03:04.400 --> 03:12.120]  work from his son and his son had also just given him loose change and I gave
[03:12.120 --> 03:18.760]  him a copy of Terror Storm and he certainly went on the rabbit hole from
[03:18.760 --> 03:23.560]  that point on and that's another example of how we can go out to influential
[03:23.560 --> 03:26.440]  people who are not evil who are not servants of the New World Order and
[03:26.440 --> 03:31.760]  wake them up to what's happening in the wider world you know we woke up Bruce
[03:31.760 --> 03:38.440]  Willis Rick Linklater broke out here on air people can say how who cares about
[03:38.440 --> 03:42.000]  Bruce Willis or Jesse Ventura well the establishment the media does I mean you
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.400]  know they'll pay these guys tens of millions of dollars to pitch products
[03:45.400 --> 03:52.600]  because the public pays attention and so it's great to have influential former
[03:52.600 --> 03:56.040]  governors and movie stars and people waking up it's great to have Keanu
[03:56.040 --> 04:00.160]  Reeves giving you know talks down to the media about the New World Order it's
[04:00.160 --> 04:04.400]  great to have George Lucas coming out against the New World Order it's great
[04:04.400 --> 04:09.600]  to have Charlie Sheen come out against the New World Order it's wonderful I
[04:09.600 --> 04:12.640]  mean if I tried to list all the prominent people coming out and speaking
[04:12.640 --> 04:17.360]  out against the New World Order it would take an hour to go over a mall there's
[04:17.360 --> 04:23.200]  so many I can't even think of them all at one time and so that's another example
[04:23.200 --> 04:29.640]  of what this radio show and my films are doing thanks to you you spreading the
[04:29.640 --> 04:35.040]  word and taking action it's having a huge effect Rand Paul son of Ron Paul
[04:35.040 --> 04:39.160]  getting set to run for Congress run for the Senate he's coming up and team on
[04:39.160 --> 04:43.480]  his 25 minutes then I'll give you an update on one of my employees daughters
[04:43.480 --> 04:48.560]  that CPS tried to kidnap strip searcher Hays County's whining their entire
[04:48.560 --> 04:52.440]  government phone systems were shut down they probably weren't able to kidnap
[04:52.440 --> 04:57.520]  kids for a few hours and or raid marijuana smokers with SWAT teams and
[04:57.520 --> 05:01.960]  shoot him or anything we'll talk about it all many human illnesses can be
[05:01.960 --> 05:05.520]  attributed to the fact that soil in the United States no longer provides
[05:05.520 --> 05:09.440]  plants with the mineral elements which are essential to human nourishment many
[05:09.440 --> 05:13.640]  studies have shown that the majority of Americans are deficient in minerals
[05:13.640 --> 05:18.840]  deficiency in any one of the more important minerals actually results in

[07:07.400 --> 07:11.040]  was devastated but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when
[07:11.040 --> 07:14.600]  you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates
[07:14.600 --> 07:18.760]  you every day there is no job security you are always in danger of losing your
[07:18.760 --> 07:22.640]  job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business
[07:22.640 --> 07:28.080]  since you are the boss nobody can fire you so MZ has been his own boss for over
[07:28.080 --> 07:32.480]  37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys
[07:32.480 --> 07:37.240]  and benefits of working for themselves and not for others MZ wants to tell you

[08:25.960 --> 08:29.600]  big headlines everywhere those comments about waterboarding and a lot more and
[08:29.600 --> 08:34.840]  about indicting prosecuting the Bush administration so he'll be on the show
[08:34.840 --> 08:39.080]  today as well Rand Paul getting ready to run for political office son of the
[08:39.080 --> 08:44.600]  illustrious doctor Ron Paul congressman Ron Paul will be joining us coming up
[08:44.600 --> 08:50.480]  later in this hour as well and in the next hour we will have open phones look
[08:50.480 --> 08:57.520]  I want to thank the listeners for tens of thousands of phone calls to YouTube
[08:57.520 --> 09:03.960]  and the parent company Google because that made them contact us and point out
[09:03.960 --> 09:09.200]  that we should just file in federal court that these were false copyright
[09:09.200 --> 09:15.400]  claims that had been filed to bring down bring down the Alex Jones YouTube
[09:15.400 --> 09:20.640]  channel and we did that I wrote a briefing wrote a federal filing and most
[09:20.640 --> 09:23.040]  of these are not successful you can read the history of these we were
[09:23.040 --> 09:27.280]  successful because I cited precedent some other things but it was your phone
[09:27.280 --> 09:33.840]  calls that definitely got Google's attention and there's some complexities
[09:33.840 --> 09:38.080]  to that I'm not going to get into but the issue is we had a success there and
[09:38.080 --> 09:41.960]  millions more people will now every week see the Alex Jones channel on YouTube
[09:41.960 --> 09:46.440]  just one outpost on the front lines of the info war make no mistake YouTube is
[09:46.440 --> 09:49.800]  the very front line that's where we're reaching many of the new people we
[09:49.800 --> 09:55.360]  reach we are not speaking to the choir here they take the audio this show the
[09:55.360 --> 10:00.200]  video and we simulcast at prisonplanet.tv they slap it up there all over the
[10:00.200 --> 10:02.800]  internet and it's just having an unbelievable effect not just on YouTube
[10:02.800 --> 10:06.800]  but YouTube is the big kahuna bigger than all video sites combined and we are
[10:06.800 --> 10:11.320]  waging war on corruption and the new world order on YouTube and reaching tens
[10:11.320 --> 10:19.480]  of thousands conservatively of new people every day so I salute you now I
[10:19.480 --> 10:24.800]  have an employee in here Monday I get off the air she's crying CPS says she
[10:24.800 --> 10:27.640]  can't have her daughter they're gonna come take her she had a little bruise
[10:27.640 --> 10:32.200]  halfway down her thigh then it turns out they strip searched her had police
[10:32.200 --> 10:36.880]  there telling her you're gonna get in trouble if you don't it shut down the
[10:36.880 --> 10:40.120]  Hays County phone system according to them they're such liars who knows what
[10:40.120 --> 10:45.320]  the truth is and so later in the next hour I'll spend about five minutes
[10:45.320 --> 10:48.200]  thanking everybody for now because he knows what's gonna come up the future
[10:48.200 --> 10:53.200]  but I want to thank everybody for now it looks like we're backing them off I'll
[10:53.200 --> 10:56.120]  tell you what's happening with that but you know there's all these cops in the
[10:56.120 --> 11:00.200]  Austin American statesman in the comment page under the article that we're linked
[11:00.200 --> 11:05.760]  to up on info wars.com going oh Alex Jones wants children to be abused you
[11:05.760 --> 11:08.920]  know I remember we were going through the academy I was going through the
[11:08.920 --> 11:13.280]  academy you can tell these are you know cops in Austin and Hays County and they
[11:13.280 --> 11:17.600]  admit they are yeah Alex said all those cops got chips in our heads that we got
[11:17.600 --> 11:24.000]  the academy I never said that that's a strong man I read mainstream news
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.680]  articles how they want to chip the military out of BBC and Associated Press
[11:27.680 --> 11:31.800]  and I read army documents but see that's what you do instead of talking about
[11:31.800 --> 11:36.600]  why are schools strip searching little girls without their parents being
[11:36.600 --> 11:39.480]  notified with police threatening them they'll get in trouble if they don't
[11:39.480 --> 11:43.720]  instead of you facing up to the type of stuff you're doing all over this country
[11:43.720 --> 11:47.960]  and that's all over the news that goes on I'm just in this case you sit there
[11:47.960 --> 11:52.800]  and you make jokes and you lie about me and say I said see you're lying to
[11:52.800 --> 11:56.600]  yourselves right there do you believe the crap you're shoveling do you believe
[11:56.600 --> 12:01.080]  the baloney you're putting out they had the Hays County Sheriff's spokesman on
[12:01.080 --> 12:05.840]  local radio saying I'm a liar now they're trying to claim that they didn't
[12:05.840 --> 12:09.200]  even strip searcher but we have the CPS and others in previous statements
[12:09.200 --> 12:12.840]  admitting that they did they're calling it a medical examination taking her
[12:12.840 --> 12:16.600]  pants off and the statesman caught she and those lies I was talking to the
[12:16.600 --> 12:19.080]  station reporter yesterday goes yeah they did say that earlier now they're
[12:19.080 --> 12:22.600]  saying this pretty soon you'll say you didn't even talk to the little girl
[12:22.600 --> 12:27.760]  pretty soon you'll say little Haley doesn't exist pretty soon you'll say
[12:27.760 --> 12:32.320]  buta elementary doesn't exist Hays County doesn't exist Texas doesn't exist the
[12:32.320 --> 12:37.640]  United States doesn't exist the planet doesn't exist your double feet double
[12:37.640 --> 12:42.320]  think mind tricks don't work on us anymore you're breaking our
[12:42.320 --> 12:46.880]  conditioning we're not listening to your double talk anymore
[12:46.880 --> 12:57.080]  ah and I had TV crews here yesterday and they were saying was this
[12:57.080 --> 13:01.680]  unreasonable and dangerous for you to do giving out government phone numbers and
[13:01.680 --> 13:06.360]  the Hays County says you gave out their 911 and I said I didn't give out 911
[13:06.360 --> 13:09.960]  you don't you don't get on national radio would say call 911 that would
[13:09.960 --> 13:13.040]  even go to Hays County I gave the administrative offices of the county
[13:13.040 --> 13:20.440]  commissioners the city of beauty the city of beauty I suddenly can't talk
[13:20.440 --> 13:27.360]  today cuz I'm so hyped up the city of buta the city council and the police
[13:27.360 --> 13:30.600]  department administrative numbers and that's all on record I said go listen
[13:30.600 --> 13:36.200]  to the MP3 of the show so see that's what the police always do they always try
[13:36.200 --> 13:40.080]  to put it off on somebody else oh we didn't we weren't there we didn't strip
[13:40.080 --> 13:43.120]  searcher we don't know about any strip search first it was we weren't part of
[13:43.120 --> 13:47.680]  the strip search then I know nothing to the best of our knowledge there was no
[13:47.680 --> 13:51.320]  strip search you next they would have told us that their squad car videos
[13:51.320 --> 13:56.720]  weren't working either come like in the latest Austin shooting I mean I've seen
[13:56.720 --> 14:00.720]  two cases now in the last week of police running up to a suspect with his
[14:00.720 --> 14:04.960]  laying on the ground with his hands out in supplication in prostration
[14:04.960 --> 14:12.400]  prostrate before them you know submission and the police with all their
[14:12.400 --> 14:17.600]  power boot kick the head head flies back blood starts coming out and the police
[14:17.600 --> 14:22.640]  DA's and people come out on the news and say oh this was just adjusting the
[14:22.640 --> 14:27.160]  positioning of his head so I guess now they stomp your head in and kill you
[14:27.160 --> 14:31.560]  it's just positioning maybe maybe they cut your arm off it's merely a flesh
[14:31.560 --> 14:37.160]  wound all right I'm already digressing into Babel
[14:40.920 --> 14:47.480]  gold's up at $943 so what gold is up
[14:47.480 --> 14:54.400]  $63 in the last three weeks making a move and they'll probably try to
[14:54.400 --> 14:57.560]  suppress the price again but they're not gonna be able to do it forever China
[14:57.560 --> 15:08.360]  Russia Venezuela Brazil they're all dumping the dollar right now all I can
[15:08.360 --> 15:12.920]  say is get ready for rough financial times ahead and that's putting it
[15:12.920 --> 15:22.000]  lightly anyways I digress we got Jesse Ventura coming up as I said that
[15:22.000 --> 15:30.480]  should be interesting okay let me give you some of the headlines I've got here
[15:30.480 --> 15:37.640]  in front of me obviously we're gonna talk about the big press conference that
[15:37.640 --> 15:44.720]  I watched as I was jogging on the treadmill this morning with President
[15:44.720 --> 15:50.440]  Barack H. Obama up there engaged in levels of double think double speak
[15:50.440 --> 15:58.400]  double talk duplicity lies disinformation that will bamboozle a
[15:58.400 --> 16:02.360]  bunch of other people and then when people point out in a year from now that
[16:02.360 --> 16:07.480]  they're holding secret detainees including US citizens in the United States
[16:07.480 --> 16:13.720]  and other countries and then he's continuing indefinite secret detention
[16:13.720 --> 16:17.400]  he's announced all that in his executive order second day in office I mean
[16:17.400 --> 16:20.920]  that's why it's all in the Obama deception he just keeps repeating the
[16:20.920 --> 16:25.000]  same trick over and over again you see the Obama deception you have their
[16:25.000 --> 16:31.600]  entire game plan and but for an average person that hasn't studied the enemy and
[16:31.600 --> 16:35.920]  how they operate he is the latest generation of lying though I mean I've
[16:35.920 --> 16:40.640]  never seen double talk this slick it's only slick though if you're uninformed
[16:40.640 --> 16:46.600]  if you're informed it's a big joke so before I break that down right now I
[16:46.600 --> 16:50.840]  want to just give you a another example that is now public knowledge that he
[16:50.840 --> 16:54.840]  got caught on one of the few things he got caught on I mean he's been caught on
[16:54.840 --> 16:59.360]  every front line if you look at what he's done but still the public widely
[16:59.360 --> 17:04.200]  knows he lied about this he's been caught even by the sheep public on this
[17:04.200 --> 17:06.200]  issue
[17:06.360 --> 17:10.560]  then he's being caught on the secret arrest no right for detainees and
[17:10.560 --> 17:15.000]  definite detention torture he's being caught on that so that's what this is
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.600]  is damage control and him and Cheney engaged in some political theater all
[17:20.600 --> 17:25.640]  choreographed all scripted on the teleprompters both sides Obama works for
[17:25.640 --> 17:29.000]  the people that run Bush they confer together they hug they they may have
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.480]  phone calls weekly it's all come he's protecting Bush it's completely staged
[17:33.480 --> 17:39.320]  he's got his defense secretary the entire crew there's more bush people in
[17:39.320 --> 17:44.080]  the administration and there are that's bush 41 and Clinton people and there
[17:44.080 --> 17:50.400]  are that Obama brought in so here's an example of a scam you know about even
[17:50.400 --> 17:54.880]  if you're a mainline new listener to the show who thanks rush Limbaugh's
[17:54.880 --> 17:58.400]  conservative and Bill Clinton's liberal and they all love you and want to take
[17:58.400 --> 18:03.840]  care of you instead of they all are for the new world order so we break this down
[18:03.840 --> 18:10.000]  for him remember Obama coming out saying he was angry about the banker bailout
[18:10.000 --> 18:15.680]  and he was gonna get to the bottom of CEO bonuses and compensation to
[18:15.680 --> 18:22.220]  executives in the tens of billions of dollars and then it was he'd already
[18:22.220 --> 18:25.160]  signed the executive order so this is in the Obama deception out two months ago
[18:25.160 --> 18:28.480]  and this only broke a month ago because I don't know how to read the executive
[18:28.480 --> 18:32.080]  order I don't need mainstream media to tell me something so we break down
[18:32.080 --> 18:37.360]  exactly what later came out in the news in the film I know how to read an
[18:37.360 --> 18:43.840]  executive order that executive order said that anyone who previously signed a
[18:43.840 --> 18:51.440]  deal with with the October 3rd banker takeover in perpetuity forward couldn't
[18:51.440 --> 18:54.560]  be investigated couldn't be audited and they could have any bonuses or any money
[18:54.560 --> 19:03.800]  they wanted to spend it however they want but that wasn't enough for him he
[19:03.800 --> 19:08.200]  signed an executive order saying that then he pressured senator Dodd and Dodd's
[19:08.200 --> 19:12.720]  on record saying this the White House has had to admit it to pass a rider on
[19:12.720 --> 19:20.080]  the 887 million dollar stimulus package stating that all the major banks and
[19:20.080 --> 19:24.440]  brokerage firms were exempt from even getting money out of the stimulus
[19:24.440 --> 19:33.200]  package for CEO and executive bonuses and pay and then Obama came out and gave
[19:33.200 --> 19:37.080]  speeches against it and people went wait a minute they sort of blaming
[19:37.080 --> 19:41.800]  senator Dodd for it throwing him to the wolves his minion his former colleague
[19:41.800 --> 19:46.680]  and Dodd came out and said you told me to do this you signed the orders and the
[19:46.680 --> 19:51.000]  executive I just got passed the accompanying legislative see that's
[19:51.000 --> 19:56.880]  what's going on with this torture business he is behind it all while paying

[24:36.360 --> 24:44.720]  U.S. citizens in the night now Obama puts it in high gear but pays some slick
[24:44.720 --> 24:52.840]  talk lip service to it and so the left in this country embraces pure wickedness
[24:52.840 --> 24:57.800]  hook line and sinker and I hear disgusting fake conservatives all over
[24:57.800 --> 25:02.480]  radio and TV defending Obama on one level and they have another group of them
[25:02.480 --> 25:07.440]  criticizing him putting out this info Obama is gonna put al-Qaeda murderers
[25:07.440 --> 25:12.200]  on the streets of America and see that then gives him left cover oh look the
[25:12.200 --> 25:16.320]  right wing is attacking him Dick Cheney who has a 9% approval rating is
[25:16.320 --> 25:22.400]  attacking him that will then give Obama incredible support you have a horrible
[25:22.400 --> 25:29.720]  unpopular person who the media says is the leader of the Republican Party Dick
[25:29.720 --> 25:36.400]  Cheney and we have White House memos saying run on Dick Cheney run on
[25:36.400 --> 25:39.800]  Rush Limbaugh both very unpopular with the average American even most
[25:39.800 --> 25:48.960]  conservatives they're discredited they're known as hypocrites liars Cheney's got
[25:48.960 --> 25:52.160]  a 9% approval rating so we've got the White House memos you know this is not
[25:52.160 --> 25:55.160]  just my opinion during the election later it came out what a month ago that
[25:55.160 --> 26:01.800]  it's White House memos New York Times Washington Post they want to run on
[26:01.800 --> 26:06.600]  Cheney and run on Limbaugh instead of a new idea of liberty and freedom they
[26:06.600 --> 26:10.680]  want to hang around the neck of conservatism tripling the size of
[26:10.680 --> 26:15.640]  government torture secret arrest but see Cheney Obama they're all just puppets
[26:15.640 --> 26:19.600]  their job is to act like they're really the power structure and to have these
[26:19.600 --> 26:23.040]  stage fights with each other where Obama says you did things wrong Bush and
[26:23.040 --> 26:27.240]  Cheney I'm going to continue the indefinite secret detention all the
[26:27.240 --> 26:31.240]  rest of this and we're going to do a process and hear from Congress and a
[26:31.240 --> 26:35.280]  wide spectrum of the political landscape not wide spectrum the control left
[26:35.280 --> 26:42.920]  right paradigm and then we're going to see what to do to keep America safe and
[26:42.920 --> 26:46.600]  then meanwhile Cheney comes out and attacks that so the left then goes hey
[26:46.600 --> 26:51.560]  do you know what Obama's doing is good don't you see the mind trick you've now
[26:51.560 --> 26:56.920]  accepted secret arrest secret torture indefinite detention and Obama's got
[26:56.920 --> 27:02.360]  chief high-level Democrats all over Congress introducing hate crimes bills
[27:02.360 --> 27:05.680]  that restrict free speech but that's nothing compared to the cyber bullying
[27:05.680 --> 27:11.000]  act with Hannah Montana pushing it in character in Reuters on national TV and
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.040]  I turned the television on for 30 minutes last night and saw Hannah
[27:14.040 --> 27:17.920]  Montana all over pushing we've got to pass the cyber bullying act that says
[27:17.920 --> 27:22.640]  felony arrest if someone says you hurt their feelings I mean the end of the
[27:22.640 --> 27:28.320]  first amendment the end of free speech they're attacking the second amendment
[27:28.320 --> 27:35.120]  they're hitting us at every level and Obama is in deep political trouble and
[27:35.120 --> 27:38.760]  his approval rating is dropping even with his base because they're finding
[27:38.760 --> 27:42.080]  out he's involved in the banker bailout in the banker takeover and now they
[27:42.080 --> 27:49.560]  want a new one it's reported today even more powers and more trillions and so
[27:49.560 --> 27:54.120]  Obama tried to say hey I'm closing Guantanamo and people read the executive
[27:54.120 --> 27:56.840]  order and they said wait a minute says you're gonna look at closing it in a
[27:56.840 --> 28:02.880]  year but moving people to offshore European and Central Asian bases and in
[28:02.880 --> 28:07.760]  Montana and Wyoming in places and that citizens will be held at these and the
[28:07.760 --> 28:10.920]  facilities they've listed are already facilities quote holding there's a new
[28:10.920 --> 28:15.200]  division of supermax the feds have that holds like people that break in and
[28:15.200 --> 28:19.400]  free monkeys or people that whether you agree with that or not or people that
[28:19.400 --> 28:23.520]  burned down a ski resort or you know pretty bad folks burning down the ski
[28:23.520 --> 28:27.640]  resort but they hold them in supermax special anti-terror prisons where they
[28:27.640 --> 28:31.680]  can't talk to lawyers or family that's in the news but in the back of the paper
[28:31.680 --> 28:37.000]  that they're gonna stick us citizens with these people out of Central Asia and
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.160]  then the news keeps saying all these people are guilty these are terrorists
[28:41.160 --> 28:44.840]  they're gonna let go and then they get admit that more than two-thirds of the
[28:44.840 --> 28:50.200]  evidence obtained in fake terror alerts was obtained through torture I mean they
[28:50.200 --> 28:56.320]  water boarded shake Khalid Muhammad for five and a half years and then he
[28:56.320 --> 28:59.320]  confessed to bombing buildings that weren't even built when he was arrested
[28:59.320 --> 29:04.560]  I'm surprised he didn't confess to sinking the Titanic to crucifying Jesus
[29:04.560 --> 29:11.000]  Christ I'm surprised he didn't confess to killing Lincoln
[29:16.200 --> 29:22.360]  it is absolutely amazing ladies and gentlemen and so this is the type of
[29:22.360 --> 29:25.440]  political diversion he comes out and says he's getting rid of it but if you
[29:25.440 --> 29:27.960]  listen to the fine print of what he's saying and the fine print of what he's
[29:27.960 --> 29:31.920]  written and what that what it's the exact same thing but with a velvet glove
[29:31.920 --> 29:37.360]  on it so they're there he's shoring up all the horrible things the new water got
[29:37.360 --> 29:42.560]  done on bushes watch now he's getting left cover is chaining attacks him to
[29:42.560 --> 29:47.040]  make it look like he's doing something good this is some slick stuff in the
[29:47.040 --> 29:52.640]  public we'll buy it for a while but they'll wake up we're on the March the

[36:26.840 --> 36:31.200]  fundraisers gonna be having Rand Paul great to have you here sir good to be
[36:31.200 --> 36:35.400]  with you Alex a very exciting times before we get into your campaign are
[36:35.400 --> 36:39.600]  you gonna be running for the Senate and it looks like you are so but before we
[36:39.600 --> 36:44.720]  do that your dad tell us about how he's doing about the what is it 120 something
[36:44.720 --> 36:49.480]  sponsors now to audit the Fed I mean liberty is on the March I think the
[36:49.480 --> 36:53.800]  audit the Fed bill is really really exciting and it's a real example of how
[36:53.800 --> 36:57.280]  our movement is not just a protest movement anymore that we're actually
[36:57.280 --> 37:02.840]  gonna get something done in Congress hopefully actually over 160 co-sponsors
[37:02.840 --> 37:07.960]  now it's virtually guaranteed that it will get a vote in committee they haven't
[37:07.960 --> 37:11.280]  scheduled the committee meeting yet but Barney Frank is the chairman of the
[37:11.280 --> 37:16.240]  committee and he's agreed to hold hearings and what I've heard is it if it
[37:16.240 --> 37:20.240]  passes in committee there's a very good chance it can pass on the floor and this
[37:20.240 --> 37:24.080]  is a good first step towards opening the transparency of what goes on at the
[37:24.080 --> 37:28.560]  Federal Reserve what's amazing is they've increased their balance sheet or
[37:28.560 --> 37:32.560]  their asset sheet by two trillion dollars you know we talk and complain
[37:32.560 --> 37:36.360]  about the trillion dollar stimulus and the trillion dollar bank out bank bail
[37:36.360 --> 37:40.360]  out the Federal Reserve increased their asset sheet by two trillion and nobody
[37:40.360 --> 37:44.200]  got to vote on it and nobody even gets to know where the money spent so it's
[37:44.200 --> 37:50.800]  about time we opened up the books of the Fed it certainly is you know a lot of
[37:50.800 --> 37:54.880]  people said oh look Ron Paul lost what a waste and I said wait a minute you know
[37:54.880 --> 37:59.760]  revolutions always take time the number one you know new movement on campuses
[37:59.760 --> 38:03.640]  starting to overshadow the phone phony liberals and phony conservatives is the
[38:03.640 --> 38:08.600]  libertarian Ron Paul patriot movement he was just a focal point of that all this
[38:08.600 --> 38:13.320]  investment in time and energy is is just going to continue to grow and now
[38:13.320 --> 38:16.880]  everybody has seen that and are more heartened than ever and have learned the
[38:16.880 --> 38:20.280]  lesson that this isn't going to be instant gratification this is like
[38:20.280 --> 38:24.200]  planting crops a lot of work comes into it but before you know you're bringing in
[38:24.200 --> 38:27.360]  that harvest and this is going to be the same with your Senate campaign I pray
[38:27.360 --> 38:33.240]  just like we pushed your dad to run for president I pray that you will after
[38:33.240 --> 38:37.400]  you're done exploring this do it because it's so important to just launch more
[38:37.400 --> 38:41.800]  torpedoes at the enemy and I see you as a very important torpedo not just because
[38:41.800 --> 38:45.400]  your father's name but your great education your patriotic stance your
[38:45.400 --> 38:50.320]  activities in Kentucky your history of liberty I think you're the man for the
[38:50.320 --> 38:53.840]  job and you're a weapon we need to use against the New World Order well the
[38:53.840 --> 38:58.200]  amazing thing about my father's loss and I was very involved with the campaign and
[38:58.200 --> 39:02.680]  I heard some of the dissatisfaction from people but I try to convince people that
[39:02.680 --> 39:07.640]  the amazing thing about the loss is that he is routinely on the mainstream media
[39:07.640 --> 39:13.200]  now our viewpoint finally for the first time in probably 30 years we have a
[39:13.200 --> 39:18.200]  spokesman yes may not be listening to him all the time in Washington but we
[39:18.200 --> 39:22.600]  have someone who presents our point of view to a large audience on a national
[39:22.600 --> 39:26.800]  basis and he became a national leader and there's something quirky about the
[39:26.800 --> 39:30.840]  media in the sense that you can be a regional person a congressional
[39:30.840 --> 39:34.440]  candidate or congressman but then when you take that next step up to the
[39:34.440 --> 39:38.200]  national level all the sudden everybody wants to know your opinion the other
[39:38.200 --> 39:44.120]  thing that's made him very prescient is the fact that he predicted the housing
[39:44.120 --> 39:50.800]  bubble just exactly in 2003 in committee saying there will be this housing
[39:50.800 --> 39:55.480]  bubble not only will mortgages fail but banks will fail because of this and now
[39:55.480 --> 39:59.800]  that's being repeated verbatim Tom Woods put it in his book Joe Scarborough's
[39:59.800 --> 40:04.040]  putting it verbatim in a book that he's publishing so people are taking notice
[40:04.040 --> 40:07.520]  of the fact that he predicted what was going to happen with his housing bubble
[40:07.520 --> 40:11.720]  exactly we have a bandwagon effect you have the Republican Party that sold
[40:11.720 --> 40:15.880]  out to the new world order totally in shambles and they're recognizing the
[40:15.880 --> 40:21.720]  only thing left and growing is true conservatism true libertarian viewpoint
[40:21.720 --> 40:25.400]  and I've got to say that your father's very scholarly he had a lot more fire
[40:25.400 --> 40:29.920]  and was more passionate when he was you know 30 years ago giving speeches that
[40:29.920 --> 40:34.640]  have been since put up on YouTube and he's very humble so he didn't you know
[40:34.640 --> 40:38.560]  like to get aggressive and you know really show a lot of fire in the belly
[40:38.560 --> 40:42.600]  until he got attacked and we saw more of that and now he's gotten very
[40:42.600 --> 40:49.120]  comfortable on TV now he's on national TV almost every day and he is you know as
[40:49.120 --> 40:52.880]  you said we're forcing the American people's popular viewpoint now to the
[40:52.880 --> 40:56.880]  mainstream they're having to capitulate and admit that we are a massive
[40:56.880 --> 41:04.600]  minority becoming a majority and this is an incredible incredible victory and
[41:04.600 --> 41:08.720]  that goes to you your father to everybody that supported Ron Paul to
[41:08.720 --> 41:12.760]  people who have fought for liberty for decades in this nation we're having huge
[41:12.760 --> 41:16.640]  success and I want listeners to understand that that the establishment
[41:16.640 --> 41:20.080]  has tried to send people into our midst to be naysayers and to nitpick and
[41:20.080 --> 41:25.800]  any those people are you know a lot of them are you know are just close minded
[41:25.800 --> 41:30.040]  but a lot of them are operatives right and you mentioned going beyond sort of
[41:30.040 --> 41:33.520]  the right left paradigm this is what I tell people about if I can win a
[41:33.520 --> 41:38.960]  primary and get into a general election is that I don't think you have to sell
[41:38.960 --> 41:42.080]  your message out and just become a Democrat when you win the primary to
[41:42.080 --> 41:46.520]  attract Democrats I think there's a whole host of independence and and people
[41:46.520 --> 41:50.760]  who might even call themselves moderate who think the deficit is drowning us and
[41:50.760 --> 41:53.600]  we have to do something about it but you know the reason they're not voting
[41:53.600 --> 41:57.360]  Republican is because they don't trust the Republicans anymore to do anything
[41:57.360 --> 42:02.120]  about it so we have to bring back some believability you know as I'm going to
[42:02.120 --> 42:05.560]  be running as a Republican we need to bring back believability to the
[42:05.560 --> 42:10.160]  Republicans and say we do believe in the debt and reducing the deficit and
[42:10.160 --> 42:13.200]  cutting spending and doing the things that we talked about for many years but
[42:13.200 --> 42:17.960]  never did once we got in power and it's not just you running we need a lot more
[42:17.960 --> 42:21.480]  people to run they are running people for County Commissioner dog catcher
[42:21.480 --> 42:28.880]  mayor sheriff state representatives on the Liberty bandwagon and that's why
[42:28.880 --> 42:32.960]  we see 30 plus states moving to declare 10th and 9th Amendment sovereignty
[42:32.960 --> 42:37.000]  that's why we see revolutions defending the Second Amendment and declaring
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.080]  state sovereignty on the Second Amendment being declared I mean we're
[42:40.080 --> 42:44.280]  actually counter-striking the globalists that are trying to take over our
[42:44.280 --> 42:49.320]  nation on every front aren't we dr. Paul well I think 2010 could be a big year
[42:49.320 --> 42:52.640]  because just historically there's a backlash a lot of times against
[42:52.640 --> 42:56.440]  presidents the other thing is this president is going so far in the
[42:56.440 --> 43:00.040]  direction of government direct government ownership of banks direct
[43:00.040 --> 43:03.760]  government ownership of the auto companies that there I think there will
[43:03.760 --> 43:08.400]  be a backlash and it could be a good year and people ask me if I did run win the
[43:08.400 --> 43:12.440]  nomination what would I say about the Democrat opponent is I really think
[43:12.440 --> 43:16.080]  they're going to have to defend Obama and it can be a campaign about president
[43:16.080 --> 43:22.640]  Obama in 2010 and while he does have high popularity role in Kentucky he lost
[43:22.640 --> 43:27.240]  overwhelmingly to John McCain and John McCain ran sort of a lackluster campaign
[43:27.240 --> 43:32.040]  but he still wiped out president Obama and Kentucky so Kentucky is right I
[43:32.040 --> 43:37.280]  think for talking about the fact that we can't go along this road we cannot
[43:37.280 --> 43:43.840]  continue to sustain this massive deficit 90% chance you're gonna run I mean what
[43:43.840 --> 43:48.560]  do you need to see in your exploratory committee to ensure that you do run
[43:48.560 --> 43:52.640]  there's a couple of things going on it's a it's kind of a tricky situation we
[43:52.640 --> 43:56.840]  have an incumbent senator Jim Bunning who actually did vote against the bank
[43:56.840 --> 44:01.800]  bailout and has been fairly conservative he unfortunately did vote someone for
[44:01.800 --> 44:05.360]  some other things that we have a great disagreement with such as the Patriot Act
[44:05.360 --> 44:10.560]  but he in general was kind of conservative he says he's running but at the
[44:10.560 --> 44:14.440]  same time he says if he doesn't raise enough money he won't run he also has
[44:14.440 --> 44:18.080]  encouraged another candidate other than myself to form an exploratory committee
[44:18.080 --> 44:22.320]  which doesn't seem to make sense because if he's really running why would he
[44:22.320 --> 44:25.400]  encourage other people to compete with him for fundraising if that's the key
[44:25.400 --> 44:29.160]  criteria for him to keep running well I don't care if he's got a half good
[44:29.160 --> 44:33.000]  but I mean Dr. Paul and to interrupt here I don't care if he's got a few good
[44:33.000 --> 44:37.120]  things on this record a bunch of it's bad your dad isn't gonna live forever we
[44:37.120 --> 44:41.760]  need to use the Paul name for liberty and we need you to go ahead and get into
[44:41.760 --> 44:45.560]  politics and and go ahead and start winning to follow in your father's
[44:45.560 --> 44:49.800]  footsteps and I think that's sort of the question and some of it will be shown
[44:49.800 --> 44:53.160]  by what we can raise through the exploratory committee I was telling you
[44:53.160 --> 44:56.720]  earlier we plan on going to several different states I'm working on coming
[44:56.720 --> 45:00.040]  to Texas in August and we're hoping to actually get down to your neck of woods
[45:00.040 --> 45:03.840]  to Austin and we know we have a lot of friends in the Austin area the Austin
[45:03.840 --> 45:07.360]  area was one of the biggest meetup groups in the country and we hope that the
[45:07.360 --> 45:14.000]  people of Texas will try to get us a new US senator in Kentucky the power of
[45:14.000 --> 45:19.800]  having a Paul in the house and a Paul in the Senate and for folks that want to
[45:19.800 --> 45:23.400]  know your your policies your ideas I've read your writings I know your history
[45:23.400 --> 45:27.760]  with the Kentucky Taxpayers Association what you've done you're basically what
[45:27.760 --> 45:32.480]  I would call a chip off the old block your policies are basically identical to
[45:32.480 --> 45:36.160]  your father correct I'd say we'd be very very similar we might present the
[45:36.160 --> 45:39.640]  message sometimes differently you know we have a website if people want to
[45:39.640 --> 45:45.400]  learn more about what I think Rand Paul 2010.com and on that website we already
[45:45.400 --> 45:49.560]  have a lot of policy issues and a lot of them are very very similar to my father
[45:49.560 --> 45:56.400]  I will be my own person and I think the message in some ways has to be broadened
[45:56.400 --> 45:59.720]  and made more appealing to the entire Republican electorate because you have
[45:59.720 --> 46:04.840]  to win a primary not only that it's as I I do believe in a slightly different
[46:04.840 --> 46:09.320]  presentation for example on national defense my father and I agree completely
[46:09.320 --> 46:14.480]  that you should declare war you know you should not fight war without declaring
[46:14.480 --> 46:18.520]  it constitutionally but at the same time I think it's important that we
[46:18.520 --> 46:22.920]  emphasize that the Constitution one of the primary enumerated powers the
[46:22.920 --> 46:27.320]  Constitution was national defense and so we do believe in a strong national
[46:27.320 --> 46:32.440]  defense we just have to define what is in our best national defense once we do
[46:32.440 --> 46:39.080]  so we need to appear and acknowledge that we do believe in a military response
[46:39.080 --> 46:45.000]  to those who attack us. Sure I mean that's just a popular thing but obviously
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.800]  you would try to repeal the Patriot Act you try to repeal unconstitutional gun
[46:48.800 --> 46:53.000]  laws you try to defend the borders. Yeah and in fact one of the things that I
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.160]  spoke recently at the Knob Creek machine gun shootout in Kentucky a pretty
[46:57.160 --> 47:01.840]  amazing thing over 3,000 people show up at this machine gun shootout and I gave
[47:01.840 --> 47:05.480]  a speech there and I said look I'm a great defender of the Second Amendment
[47:05.480 --> 47:08.360]  but you know what if you want the Second Amendment you got to defend the
[47:08.360 --> 47:12.960]  First Amendment also McCain Fine Gold limits what Second Amendment groups
[47:12.960 --> 47:16.640]  can do limits my taxpayer group from buying advertising it's actually
[47:16.640 --> 47:20.640]  illegal for me to buy advertising within 60 days of the election under
[47:20.640 --> 47:24.120]  McCain Fine Gold so I tell them if you want the Second Amendment you want to
[47:24.120 --> 47:27.680]  defend the Second you got to defend the First and I said if you want the Second
[47:27.680 --> 47:31.320]  Amendment you want to be free from government intrusion and looking and
[47:31.320 --> 47:34.240]  snooping about what guns you have in your house you've got to believe in the
[47:34.240 --> 47:37.280]  Fourth Amendment so you can't have the Patriot Act which
[47:37.280 --> 47:41.800]  eviscerated the Fourth Amendment if you really want to be free in your home to
[47:41.800 --> 47:45.600]  be allowed to own guns for personal protection. Now give that website out
[47:45.600 --> 47:51.560]  again for folks. It's RandPaul2010.com. And can folks go ahead and go to
[47:51.560 --> 47:56.440]  RandPaul2010.com and donate? They can we have a donation we have a ticker on the
[47:56.440 --> 48:01.560]  site actually and I was joking I tell people we've got two really old
[48:01.560 --> 48:06.880]  political hacks out in California to age 24 and 25 evidence of the youth
[48:06.880 --> 48:10.440]  movement who have done this website for me and have done a great job. Yeah it's
[48:10.440 --> 48:16.960]  gorgeous so RandPaul2010.com. I got a lot of questions for you in the 10 minutes
[48:16.960 --> 48:23.640]  or so we have left with you Dr. Rand Paul son of Congressman Rand Paul. We have
[48:23.640 --> 48:27.280]  bills introduced in Congress that are just really off the chart. We have the
[48:27.280 --> 48:30.720]  bill to put everybody on a no-fly list 1,100,000 Americans in this
[48:30.720 --> 48:35.280]  cough-gask system no judge no jury no facial accuser no more Second Amendment
[48:35.280 --> 48:39.480]  that's racing through the house. We have the cyberbullying act being pushed by
[48:39.480 --> 48:44.520]  the character Hannah Montana that if you give the feds will if someone signs an
[48:44.520 --> 48:48.160]  affidavit saying something hurt their feelings federal felony charges and
[48:48.160 --> 48:52.120]  that's only the tip of the iceberg I mean there's no doubt Obama is making a
[48:52.120 --> 48:55.360]  tyrannical move that I have to say dwarfs bush I didn't think that was
[48:55.360 --> 49:00.080]  possible. What are what should we do about that from your view? I think we
[49:00.080 --> 49:04.080]  have to you know work at sunsetting the Patriot Act or repealing the entire
[49:04.080 --> 49:08.560]  thing outright. I think one of the great ironies actually kind of laugh to see
[49:08.560 --> 49:12.840]  what Jane Harmon got caught up in here's a woman who went along with Bush on
[49:12.840 --> 49:16.760]  supporting all these wireless tapping and then she gets caught up with her
[49:16.760 --> 49:20.840]  phone tapped but it's not a laughing matter for the rest of us because my
[49:20.840 --> 49:23.600]  wife and I were sitting this morning and we get we're getting these random
[49:23.600 --> 49:26.440]  emails and we don't know if it's just spam or not but some of them are in
[49:26.440 --> 49:30.400]  either Arabic or Hebrew we're not sure what language but we were kind of
[49:30.400 --> 49:33.800]  laughing and saying well you know what someone's by sending us email now we'll
[49:33.800 --> 49:37.520]  get on a list and now they can look at our email we laugh but that could
[49:37.520 --> 49:41.480]  actually be true that someone sends you a random email that's from another
[49:41.480 --> 49:45.400]  country with another language we don't even understand but now they say well
[49:45.400 --> 49:48.560]  look you're getting it from this person who's on a watch list we're allowed to
[49:48.560 --> 49:52.520]  watch look at look at all around falls email and I don't know if that happens
[49:52.520 --> 49:56.440]  but I know under the Patriot Act they can do that no that's exactly what they
[49:56.440 --> 50:00.960]  do but they don't even do that anymore I mean they'll get whole terrorist of
[50:00.960 --> 50:03.840]  investigations by just going up to somebody at a restaurant or bar and
[50:03.840 --> 50:07.800]  saying think we might have to have a shooting war someday yeah Bob you do boom
[50:07.800 --> 50:11.720]  they'll open a whole Spence account for you know 10 or 15 feds to follow you
[50:11.720 --> 50:14.960]  around for two or three years that's how they operate so your instincts are
[50:14.960 --> 50:18.960]  right doctor well it's an amazing and it's not brand new either if you look
[50:18.960 --> 50:22.320]  back at the history during World War one of what they did through the sedition
[50:22.320 --> 50:26.760]  and espionage acts there's a famous court case and I think Napolitano writes
[50:26.760 --> 50:31.160]  about this in his book it was a farmer out in Montana and he goes down to the
[50:31.160 --> 50:34.880]  feed store with two or three of his buddies and he says well I think this
[50:34.880 --> 50:38.840]  war is about a bunch of bankers getting rich in New York and I just died that's
[50:38.840 --> 50:42.520]  don't I don't care much about those Germans says it's a World War two they
[50:42.520 --> 50:46.920]  put him in jail the first judge that here's the case under the espionage
[50:46.920 --> 50:50.360]  acts as well maybe we ought to use a little common sense here and if it looks
[50:50.360 --> 50:53.600]  like he's gonna be able to affect the outcome of the war by going down to the
[50:53.600 --> 50:57.480]  feed store and being against World War one maybe that's a different story and
[50:57.480 --> 51:01.800]  stay there doctor final segment with Rand Paul stay with us Americans do you
[51:01.800 --> 51:05.680]  know where your food comes from is it safe secure and healthy did you know

[53:57.440 --> 54:11.400]  chews.com yeah the statistics are out there we got it posted up on info
[54:11.400 --> 54:16.920]  works dot com prison planet dot com the government admits that 90% or more the
[54:16.920 --> 54:21.280]  people picked up at Guantanamo Bay and other camps in Europe were picked up by
[54:21.280 --> 54:25.440]  rival clans and I had this former CIA section chief over Afghanistan on wrote
[54:25.440 --> 54:31.400]  the book Jawbreaker and he admitted that they'd pay him 24 to $25,000 as high as
[54:31.400 --> 54:37.000]  $30,000 per head and they'd mainly just grab 14 15 16 year old goat herds who
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.240]  had no history because you know they didn't want to grabs money from a real
[54:40.240 --> 54:43.440]  you know terror group as they'd come after them and they would just sell them
[54:43.440 --> 54:47.720]  to the US and they admit that most of the intelligence was gained through
[54:47.720 --> 54:51.480]  torture so when they say they're gonna release al Qaeda on the streets of
[54:51.480 --> 54:55.520]  America no Obama's talking about taking them to new camps in the US with
[54:55.520 --> 54:59.640]  indefinite torture and having a new kangaroo court do it so and they're
[54:59.640 --> 55:04.160]  calling that liberal but this is a scary precedent Obama saying he's gonna
[55:04.160 --> 55:09.680]  continue indefinite detention Rand Paul there's at least one prisoner down
[55:09.680 --> 55:12.960]  there that I've read about who is a former governor of a province in
[55:12.960 --> 55:17.400]  Afghanistan he was a supporter of Karzai and a supporter of the US government by
[55:17.400 --> 55:21.920]  all appearances but then a rival clan who wanted to take over the governorship
[55:21.920 --> 55:26.040]  turned him in and said he was corroborate collaborating with the Taliban but
[55:26.040 --> 55:29.880]  it's kind of unclear whether these people guilty not guilty whether a rival
[55:29.880 --> 55:35.360]  clan wants to take their turf and like we talked about 90% of these people in
[55:35.360 --> 55:39.480]  Guantanamo were not picked up directly by the US troops are picked up by other
[55:39.480 --> 55:44.880]  local troops who then profess that these people are related but the hard part of
[55:44.880 --> 55:49.400]  this is is that inevitably some of these people are fighters some of them do go
[55:49.400 --> 55:54.000]  back to the battlefield and fight us so really can we release them in our country
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.920]  we've been you know I'm not sure if they all can be tried properly either so
[55:57.920 --> 56:01.920]  really I think deportation or sending them back to their country of origin
[56:01.920 --> 56:06.840]  might be the best way to go and none of us fair because some have been held for
[56:06.840 --> 56:12.240]  years and years without trial if they truly are people who were involved with
[56:12.240 --> 56:16.360]  attacking the US I think maybe then they should get live sentences and some
[56:16.360 --> 56:20.600]  should stay in prison but they deserve a trial exactly because because if they
[56:20.600 --> 56:23.920]  don't get a trial we're not going to get a trial we know doctor Paul they're
[56:23.920 --> 56:28.440]  using the Patriot Act against non-terror related cases they've set the
[56:28.440 --> 56:33.600]  precedent all of this is going to come back on us right oh I agree with you and
[56:33.600 --> 56:37.080]  then ultimately though if you cannot figure out how to have a trial and cannot
[56:37.080 --> 56:41.680]  have enough evidence to do this I think deportation is the except the only
[56:41.680 --> 56:45.520]  acceptable way and if they I think you deport them to where they were captured
[56:45.520 --> 56:49.160]  now they say oh these countries won't take them back well I think we have enough
[56:49.160 --> 56:53.440]  military force in Afghanistan that they can be taken back to Afghanistan at the
[56:53.440 --> 56:56.680]  very least and I think that would be acceptable for the vast majority of
[56:56.680 --> 57:01.280]  people gets rid of the idea of having to try them and then you know a lot of us
[57:01.280 --> 57:05.080]  aren't gonna be too happy if you know you take people who are potentially
[57:05.080 --> 57:08.320]  violent and we don't know this but our potential just put them on the streets of
[57:08.320 --> 57:11.760]  Austin that you know I think sending them back to where we captured well
[57:11.760 --> 57:15.480]  probably the best thing the media just does that to demonize releasing any of
[57:15.480 --> 57:21.960]  them of the final question dr. Rand Paul we have the DHS report that we broke in
[57:21.960 --> 57:24.840]  the my act report that we broke when we for Ron Paul first God I didn't believe
[57:24.840 --> 57:29.240]  it we don't make stuff up I don't blame him I mean I mean it's pretty crazy but
[57:29.240 --> 57:33.560]  the point is saying that veterans gun owners conservatives Ron Paul supporters
[57:33.560 --> 57:37.720]  are basically terrorist another example of how this war on terror is being used
[57:37.720 --> 57:42.840]  against the American people I think the great irony of this and it would be funny
[57:42.840 --> 57:47.000]  if it weren't so sad is that one of the criteria for being on the list could be
[57:47.000 --> 57:51.760]  if you're an adamant defender of the Constitution so defenders of the
[57:51.760 --> 57:55.840]  Constitution those who talk about the first amendment the second amendment
[57:55.840 --> 58:00.600]  the fourth amendment those people or even people who are ex-military veterans
[58:00.600 --> 58:04.000]  who serve their country and come home these are the people we have to worry
[58:04.000 --> 58:08.920]  about and put on a special list I think it's really really horrifying and there
[58:08.920 --> 58:13.120]  should be just universal outrage and you know tell you the truth once it became
[58:13.120 --> 58:16.640]  public I was unsure what would happen but the amazing thing is the more y'all
[58:16.640 --> 58:20.560]  talked about it the more they did get worried that they were targeting regular
[58:20.560 --> 58:25.080]  US citizens and at least officially pulled that off their websites because of
[58:25.080 --> 58:29.480]  things that y'all talked about dr. Rand Paul let me say bye to you during this
[58:29.480 --> 58:32.200]  break it may even hold you over a minute or two because I want to give out that
[58:32.200 --> 58:38.320]  website again and I want to give out a number for folks that may not have

[1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:05.840]  right now sir talking about this DHS report I know people had trouble
[1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:10.040]  believing and I did too and then I called the FBI numbers on it and they
[1:01:10.040 --> 1:01:14.600]  said yeah that's ours where'd you get it and the my act report we got from two
[1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:17.760]  separate state police officers then I called the number and they said yeah
[1:01:17.760 --> 1:01:22.240]  where'd you get it but but the you know the moral is we fought back and now
[1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:26.040]  they're having congressional hearings the guy in the state police that issued
[1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:30.880]  it with the feds in Missouri had to step down they're having to apologize because
[1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:34.160]  they have to tell these lies about Ron Paul supporters basically being terrorists
[1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:38.240]  in the dark I think it was a wake-up call to America that this whole Homeland
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:42.040]  Security thing is about the government suppressing the will of the people and
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:45.680]  bringing in tyranny that they've been using this threat of terrorism as a
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:50.000]  pretext yeah the other interesting thing and I'm not sure if anybody's found
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:53.280]  this in any other states have we found any other states that are doing this did
[1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:56.640]  Missouri think of this all by themselves or did this come from DHS in
[1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:00.800]  Washington no this was written by DHS and this is in North Carolina Virginia
[1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:07.200]  Texas we basically have these from every state and they all had sort of the
[1:02:07.200 --> 1:02:10.640]  same thing that they were doing in Missouri well see I've been breaking
[1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:15.080]  these and others have for 13 14 years this one just got attention for some
[1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:20.200]  reason yes it it's all basically the same yeah it's kind of scary when we're
[1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:24.400]  profiling our own citizens well here's what I wanted to tell you while we had
[1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:29.240]  you what Wayne Paul your your uncle was up at the end the fed thing with us in
[1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:32.360]  Dallas while your father was down in Houston and we got the secret army
[1:02:32.360 --> 1:02:35.640]  report and then called and they confirmed it did you know army intelligence was
[1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:41.160]  spying on your dad and your uncle and me in Texas and and that document just
[1:02:41.160 --> 1:02:46.320]  Google in the Fed protesters watched by army and that you can call that sir and
[1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:50.360]  they'll the army will admit and it said don't let them know your military they
[1:02:50.360 --> 1:02:55.320]  could they could terror attack you and it says watch out we're vicious and does
[1:02:55.320 --> 1:02:59.160]  that sound like freedom to have the army watching your dad no and it really
[1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:04.080]  is kind of a sad state of affairs that you can't gather publicly and in peace
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:07.920]  and protest against policy the policies of your government without fear of
[1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:12.480]  people spying on him well it shows me the private
[1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:15.720]  fellow reserves in the wrong and they're scared of us they're scared of our
[1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:19.880]  liberty movement well I think one of the things you could see in the eyes of
[1:03:19.880 --> 1:03:24.360]  Bernanke the last time my father grilled him in committee was that there's a
[1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:28.800]  difference in tone he's always been polite and differential to my father but
[1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:32.800]  you know with that last grilling he's starting to think something might happen
[1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:36.320]  that we might actually take some power away from the Federal Reserve so I think
[1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:40.360]  they're being even more differential yes in their in their treatment of him
[1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:44.680]  because they really think he now might have the votes to cut off their
[1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:50.000]  unlimited power and your father last time he was on two weeks ago said that he
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:55.080]  believes that he may be in danger as he continues people don't play games your
[1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:59.280]  father has a lot of courage and he needs our support and prayers and we commend

[1:09:47.760 --> 1:09:54.880]  giant stacks of news here in front of me and I want to tell you what happened
[1:09:54.880 --> 1:09:57.880]  with the little girl whose mother works in this office today and all your great
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:04.600]  phone calls and I want to commend you for that I've got just a ton of news here
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:09.400]  about what's happening in the economy massive layoffs massive job losses massive
[1:10:09.400 --> 1:10:16.960]  consumer spending down massive plunging in real estate China Venezuela Brazil
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:23.400]  Russia Arab nations are all completely starting to dump the dollar you know two
[1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:28.120]  years ago sort of moving away now they're rushing for the exits you know as
[1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:32.280]  much as I hate the globalists and they use the dollar for their power I hope
[1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:35.520]  the dollar doesn't plunge because folks that's all we got left our industry's
[1:10:35.520 --> 1:10:39.760]  gone the government's taxing us at every level all we've got this fiat currency
[1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:45.840]  for the economy and I just don't know what to say about this meanwhile with
[1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:48.840]  all this horrible financial news the government keeps trying to pump the stock
[1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:54.520]  market up now remember in 2006 we got had Bilderberg group sources in my film in
[1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:59.320]  game blueprint for global enslavement released 2007 years before all this
[1:10:59.320 --> 1:11:11.280]  started and we break down what's going on in
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:19.040]  Bilderberg okay gas prices 60 bucks a barrel they're gonna run it up to a
[1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:22.800]  hundred and fifty dollars a barrel and then they're gonna run the stock market
[1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:26.800]  up the sucker in the stock the suckers to pre-911 levels which they did then
[1:11:26.800 --> 1:11:30.640]  they're gonna plunge it and they're gonna pop the subprime mortgage as the
[1:11:30.640 --> 1:11:34.400]  way to begin this because they want a post-industrial feudal world they want
[1:11:34.400 --> 1:11:37.000]  a feudalist society they want to bankrupt everybody to be able to get their new
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.760]  world order well here we are three years later that's exactly what the globalist
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:44.920]  announce it Davos it's what they admit they're doing it's what they admit
[1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:48.520]  they're doing running the fuel up and then plunging it down running the
[1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:52.120]  market up and plunging it down then we got a Bilderberg last year and then
[1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:56.040]  again this year they're gonna pump it up one more time all the real economy dies
[1:11:56.040 --> 1:11:59.520]  they're gonna pump up the stock market to sucker in the soccer moms and the
[1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:04.360]  yuppies and then they are gonna drop the hammer even lower than the 6,000 level
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:09.680]  the stock market went to a few months ago now that's what Bilderberg saying you
[1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:14.680]  know they may not have total power and control that may not happen but Jim
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:17.720]  Tucker for 30 plus years has been infiltrating Bilderberg and has sources
[1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:20.920]  inside Esteline for 17 years and everything they've ever said has come
[1:12:20.920 --> 1:12:28.960]  true I mean I forgot our prediction from Bilderberg 2008 when fuel was at $149
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:33.600]  a barrel we wrote at prisonplanet.com it's just got pointed out to us a few
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:38.000]  weeks ago we wrote because Tucker said his sources said they were gonna drop it
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:44.720]  by half to bankrupt China Russia Venezuela and the Arabs and bankrupt our
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:52.040]  economy it was at $149 a barrel then months later it was at $55 $60 a
[1:12:52.040 --> 1:13:00.760]  barrel it's at 60 right now from 150 it's been lowest 32 I mean you know
[1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:04.560]  you Tucker called a year before that Bilderberg was gonna bring down the
[1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:09.200]  Berlin Wall since then they don't a decade after he broke that decade plus
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:13.240]  it was in the BBC last week that oh Bilderberg brags they set up the
[1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:16.880]  falling of the Berlin Wall as a controlled mechanism to socialize West
[1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:24.920]  Germany I mean everything's been proven accurate these people really run
[1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:32.320]  things Tucker comes on in 2007 from Istanbul and says okay here's the deal
[1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:35.800]  Bush is gonna capitulate and say global warming's man-made and real we need a
[1:13:35.800 --> 1:13:39.200]  carbon tax and then two weeks later Bush announces it people laughed at us
[1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:42.960]  when Tucker said that two weeks later he announces it the NFL gets behind it
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:47.400]  all the men you know NASCAR says it's real the airline say it's real the oil
[1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:54.160]  company suddenly say it's real because Bilderberg said you're gonna do this so
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:57.880]  prediction after prediction I mean ladies and gentlemen they're telling you
[1:13:57.880 --> 1:14:02.240]  that the economy is gonna get fixed when all the real data shows it is
[1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:19.040]  devastated that it is in red level crisis that it is falling apart and the
[1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:22.200]  bankers want to tell you everything's okay until they're busy running up a
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:25.600]  debt so big we could never pay it off in a trillion years I mean they've
[1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:29.600]  stolen 14.8 trillion according to Bloomberg two weeks ago in the first
[1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:38.200]  seven months of this takeover at this rate in one year from the banker
[1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:41.760]  takeover point the one-year anniversary next October 3rd they would have
[1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:49.960]  stolen 26 trillion 26 trillion would pay off all the mortgages all the
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:55.480]  mortgages not the subprime all mortgages thousand dollar you know pieces of
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:15:00.640]  property up to ten million dollar pieces property everything it would do it
[1:15:00.640 --> 1:15:16.080]  all everything all of it okay and then they're
[1:15:16.080 --> 1:15:21.120]  telling you today in the Wall Street Journal Fed open to buying more
[1:15:21.120 --> 1:15:24.680]  securities they're gonna buy up all the small banks and hand their assets over
[1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:29.000]  to JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs and the Bank of England and the private
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:34.280]  Federal Reserve the New York Fed I mean that's what they announced here let's
[1:15:34.280 --> 1:15:40.640]  go to Jim Newcomer he is the chief financial analyst strategist helps Ted
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:44.920]  make a lot of his decisions at Midas Resources a premier precious metals
[1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:49.880]  company and their Patriots Ted is in Europe right now trying to secure
[1:15:49.880 --> 1:15:53.480]  gold and silver because that's where the major gold and silver supplies are
[1:15:53.480 --> 1:15:56.440]  because you're up in stupid they've been hoarding it they made it illegal here to
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:15:59.400]  own gold and so it was all shipped to Europe during the 30s under the War
[1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:03.000]  Powers Act so Ted's over in Europe trying to get better deals on it that's
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:07.160]  how bad things have dried up most people are sold out or they've got giant
[1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:10.960]  premiums on limited amounts of coins well guess what Ted has he has something
[1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:16.960]  no one has Ted has gold he bought at the 880 level that's what he's selling it
[1:16:16.960 --> 1:16:22.480]  into the market at when gold is at let me hit refresh here on the mercantile
[1:16:22.480 --> 1:16:31.120]  943 and that was an hour ago I just hit refresh 948 and 80 cents so gold is
[1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:37.880]  $68 plus up from three weeks ago and Ted is selling you this gold priced in the
[1:16:37.880 --> 1:16:42.920]  market at the price $68 an ounce cheaper he's got silver about a dollar and a
[1:16:42.920 --> 1:16:48.560]  half factored into the market for what he got it for he bought it at a 13
[1:16:48.560 --> 1:16:52.040]  something level let's bring Jim newcomer up Jim we're gonna do this quick offer

[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:20.060]  this through the weekend if it's at all possible but we do have that Lakota
[1:17:20.060 --> 1:17:26.680]  national silver rounds there at 1966 or 393 20 a roll that's the way most people
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:30.720]  have been buying them and the Franklin half dollars they were there at 173 80
[1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:34.520]  per roll of 20 interesting about silver since the first of the year silver is
[1:17:34.520 --> 1:17:40.400]  actually up 29% since January 2nd so it's it's really shown great growth this
[1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:45.160]  year and there's an opportunity for it to really explode gold on the other hand
[1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:48.560]  is up 9% since the first year but since the first of the month it's going up
[1:17:48.560 --> 1:17:52.840]  steadily while the other economic indicators have gone down crude oil for
[1:17:52.840 --> 1:17:57.680]  example today is down today and we got the gold up what 13 $14 somewhere in
[1:17:57.680 --> 1:18:01.520]  that neighborhood so it is the time to get out and get the precious metals
[1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:05.000]  people aren't spending because of the recession they're concerned about
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:08.480]  everything but in precious metals they are spending they may not be buying
[1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:12.320]  automobiles are buying clothing or homes or things like that but they are
[1:18:12.320 --> 1:18:17.160]  moving from the paper assets into the hard assets of the precious metals and
[1:18:17.160 --> 1:18:21.360]  by the way the Chinese government the Saudi government other governments are
[1:18:21.360 --> 1:18:24.640]  demanding their European gold out of central banks in Europe in the United
[1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:28.400]  States that's now mainstream headlines and these announcements Jim that they're
[1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:35.440]  going after the dollar now and countries are dumping it we're seeing this rush
[1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:41.080]  towards the exits go from a trickle to now a rush and it appears that's leading
[1:18:41.080 --> 1:18:44.920]  towards a panic somewhere down the line so I would advise people to move quickly
[1:18:44.920 --> 1:18:48.560]  in the precious metals I mean is it is it a perfect bulletproof investment
[1:18:48.560 --> 1:18:51.640]  absolutely you know is it a silver bullet nothing is but it's the safest
[1:18:51.640 --> 1:18:55.280]  thing in my book Jim it's what I believe in it's what I do it's financial
[1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:58.120]  security and that's the reason these countries are running away from the
[1:18:58.120 --> 1:19:02.840]  dollar and into the precious metals it's going to put a heavy demand on it the
[1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:06.760]  price of the products can only go up if it's even available and that's another
[1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:10.040]  concern we have the availability as you had mentioned Ted's over in Europe right
[1:19:10.040 --> 1:19:14.040]  now trying to secure some more but we ask people call us in if you have

[1:34:16.040 --> 1:34:23.240]  later I may play some of the audio from one of the newscast it is in the Austin
[1:34:23.240 --> 1:34:29.000]  American Statesman News 8 Austin and a bunch of other publications and here in
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:35.400]  Austin Texas the Hays County Sheriff's Department just south of us where the
[1:34:35.400 --> 1:34:42.440]  city of Buda is located the suburb of Austin really a giant shopping mall
[1:34:42.440 --> 1:34:46.360]  down there with Cabela's everything else and it always happens these boss hog
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:52.480]  towns get a big gross spurt and then you know the boss hogs really get arrogant
[1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:57.880]  and they they call in all the school children at the Buda Elementary and
[1:34:57.880 --> 1:35:00.720]  interrogate them like the old Soviet Union to your parents spank you which
[1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:03.880]  isn't illegal by the way and they say yes they try to take your kids and they
[1:35:03.880 --> 1:35:07.280]  get federal bounties for it and the little girl whose mother works in this
[1:35:07.280 --> 1:35:10.960]  office said that there were two men in there she believed both were officers and
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:16.600]  three women but the women weren't always in there and that they ordered her to
[1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:20.240]  take her clothes off she said no they said do it and I and I interrogated her
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:24.040]  Tuesday night for two hours about this and we then talked to the CPS and they
[1:35:24.040 --> 1:35:27.560]  said yeah well we told her to take her pants off but we didn't make her well
[1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:30.600]  now they're in the news trying to deny that they even took her pants off how
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:36.120]  they know there was a bruise when she was wearing jeans Tuesday and the
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:39.360]  newspaper took note I talked to the reporter last night yeah they told me
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:43.120]  that they took her pants off but now that our pants were never even taken off
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:47.400]  and then the Hays County's whining and crying and saying I messed up their 911
[1:35:47.400 --> 1:35:50.960]  system and said I gave up the 911 number there's no way for me to get on
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:56.960]  national radio and say 911 dial it call Hays County 911 is localized in your
[1:35:56.960 --> 1:36:01.200]  area so I had the TV reporters here from news 8 and I gave them the print off
[1:36:01.200 --> 1:36:06.040]  that I read on air I gave a 512 administrative office for the sheriff's
[1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:11.040]  department and I gave the city council mayor's direct line and I imbued a
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:15.840]  totally separate from their 911 and I gave the school administration out that's
[1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:19.440]  what we did so see they always try to make themselves the victim oh he called
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:24.880]  911 your liars and and the news didn't believe me they kept saying yeah you
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:31.200]  gave 911 out I go how did I give 911 out you can't give the 911 number out for
[1:36:31.200 --> 1:36:34.920]  Hays County I live in Travis County this is a radio show all over the country
[1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:39.440]  and all over the world internet satellite shortwave AM and FM but it
[1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:43.080]  mattered the news was reporting I gave their 911 number out they just it's
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:48.880]  always about making the victimizer is the victim and first I had the news
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:52.760]  calling me saying you said a two-year-old was strip searched on your radio
[1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:55.600]  show and two-year-olds aren't in school and I had to argue with them and say
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:37:01.920]  here's the mp3 media get your get your act straight see they always do straw
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:04.360]  men and then if you read the Austin American Statesman article that Curt
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:10.280]  Nemo's got linked up on info wars calm it's a pretty fair article under it the
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:15.400]  first comments are cops they say we are cops and they say I remember when I was
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:18.680]  in the Academy and Alex said they were putting chips in all our brains I never
[1:37:18.680 --> 1:37:23.080]  said that you liar you know why don't you admit up to what government does
[1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:28.640]  instead of always lying and believing your lies are true now I'm not trying to
[1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:32.360]  blame all the police here the child kidnapping police and the police they
[1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:36.120]  use are always these little kept special units we had a bunch of CPS experts on
[1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:42.240]  yesterday the tailing all of that so I just want to challenge everybody out

[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.920]  think everybody that did call to let them know cuz Haley could go back to the

[1:37:55.500 --> 1:37:58.000]  can't put her in private school private schools do this anyways homeschooling is
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:03.120]  the only answer and you know they're not gonna snatch your kid for now and the
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:06.760]  lawyer I hired comes highly recommended the same law firm that my lawyer comes

[1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:21.240]  and when she pulled through there was a cop car there so they were planning to
[1:38:21.240 --> 1:38:25.120]  twist her arm demand things force their way in her house find a dishes or
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:30.000]  something in the sink and your kids are gone back here's the local Austin news
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:34.200]  and we're going to your calls the Hays County 9-1-1 system got tied up Wednesday
[1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:37.880]  afternoon because of a radio talk show host on his nationally syndicated show
[1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:41.680]  Austin based Alex Jones blasted the Hays County Sheriff's Office and Child
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:48.360]  Protective Services news hates Bob Robock explains the drama big brother
[1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:55.720]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he on his
[1:38:55.720 --> 1:38:59.960]  Wednesday afternoon broadcast now streaming online Alex Jones claimed a
[1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:04.720]  Hays County Sheriff's Deputy along with Child Protective Services strip search
[1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:09.000]  the second grader at buta elementary during a child abuse investigation I
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:12.280]  want the people to know that did this we're not just going to defend this
[1:39:12.280 --> 1:39:16.000]  little girl we're gonna come after you for what you did and wait till we cover
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:19.600]  what you did coming up I get the number of the sheriff I get the number of the
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:24.840]  mayor and muta I gave the number of the county commissioners court judge they're
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:28.520]  at the offices and I said people call these numbers just confirming that you
[1:39:28.520 --> 1:39:32.600]  clear on Hays County the broadcast prompted a flood of calls into the
[1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:37.320]  Hays County Sheriff's Office tying up the 9-1-1 system we got calls from
[1:39:37.320 --> 1:39:44.200]  California New York all over people that listened to show that were just just
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:50.000]  totally upset Lieutenant Lee Roy Opiella says the deputy stood outside the room
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:55.040]  while CPS interviewed the little girl and he never coerced her to submit to a
[1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:59.200]  search nevertheless thousands of people call the sheriff's administrative line
[1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:04.000]  which then crippled the 9-1-1 system for at least ten minutes the sheriff's
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:08.080]  office says part of the problem may have been that some of the operators who
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:13.000]  answer the 9-1-1 system also answer the administrative lines and they could have
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:16.720]  been so tied up with the influx of calls that they weren't available to answer
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:22.240]  the emergency calls as far as 9-1-1 operators know Hays County didn't miss
[1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:27.680]  legitimate emergency calls but the ordeal still leaves accusations hanging out
[1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:31.200]  there all little girl knows is they were it was men in there telling her she
[1:40:31.200 --> 1:40:36.120]  getting trouble I wasn't there mr. Jones wasn't there I don't believe that

[1:44:56.480 --> 1:45:00.560]  ship somebody did this to you and you go to the doctor now and they ask you they
[1:45:00.560 --> 1:45:04.320]  ask you about do you have guns in your house all right let's go to the phone
[1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:08.320]  calls I just want to thank everybody I want to commend everybody for the great
[1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:13.200]  job that they did and for helping my office out you know I can't help the
[1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:16.840]  literally hundreds of emails I get with people having their kids snatched I turn
[1:45:16.840 --> 1:45:21.960]  them you know over to the referral of groups that help parents and we list
[1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:26.800]  those groups we try to give folks those numbers but and it's always painful to
[1:45:26.800 --> 1:45:29.640]  hear the woman crying or the man crying and say they want their baby back or
[1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:33.040]  their kid back this is what makes me so angry you know I yell and scream and get
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:36.760]  angry because instead of ignoring all the evil in the world I focus on it I fight
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:41.800]  it it's not because I'm some perfect good hero either I care about kids I care
[1:45:41.800 --> 1:45:46.160]  about people I care about liberty I care about freedom John and Ohio disagrees it
[1:45:46.160 --> 1:45:50.600]  goes ahead of the line then Phil Fred Mark Dan go ahead John yes I always have
[1:45:50.600 --> 1:45:55.880]  say I promoted and plug some of your work on radio talk shows but I do have to
[1:45:55.880 --> 1:45:59.880]  hurt you John I've heard you plug me on coast to coast AM and other national
[1:45:59.880 --> 1:46:04.520]  shows but but that said you got to take me to the woodshed well yeah I even though
[1:46:04.520 --> 1:46:09.600]  I'm I consider myself an unaffiliated socialist and largely agree with groups
[1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:16.080]  like WSWS.org I well first of all I heard you doing a good job on a very
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:20.880]  good rant you did yesterday or was it they before on Derry Brownfield so so
[1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:24.240]  well let's do that rant again about the banker takeover I thought that was great
[1:46:24.240 --> 1:46:30.800]  well at this point I would like to do a rant against the program on Derry
[1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:36.800]  Brownfield today and this arsonist and this and this oh wait a little when
[1:46:36.800 --> 1:46:40.440]  they were using the Bible saying Libya it's in the Bible Libya is gonna attack
[1:46:40.440 --> 1:46:44.680]  Israel's we have never World War three well a load of baloney yeah this this
[1:46:44.680 --> 1:46:49.720]  course a character this forked-tongued chameleon hypocrite and arsonist who's
[1:46:49.720 --> 1:46:53.680]  been making a career for it seems like decades I've heard him on coast to coast
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:58.360]  setting up the most lurid and outrageous talk let me fill in on this I
[1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:02.760]  happen to get ready at my house for the radio show and I drive in and around 10
[1:47:02.760 --> 1:47:08.000]  a.m. to the office so always in the car listen to Brownfield is on local FM as
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:11.800]  we are here in town and so I'm driving and listening so I happen to almost
[1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:16.000]  every day hear that here on Genesis right before me and yeah I was kind of
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:20.280]  embarrassed and almost wanted to say something today because and I don't want
[1:47:20.280 --> 1:47:23.000]  to get to fight with Corsi but next time I have him on I'm gonna say now you're
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:29.560]  a theologian now little pathetic disarmed backward Libya is is is Gog and
[1:47:29.560 --> 1:47:35.720]  Magog I mean this is unbelievable well he was talking about the poor disarmed
[1:47:35.720 --> 1:47:39.880]  little Israel which has 500 nuclear weapons pointing and threatening Iran
[1:47:39.880 --> 1:47:44.320]  and the United States of course with 10,000 that he's going there to his
[1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:48.280]  having some kind of a comfortable welcoming and a nest there to write a
[1:47:48.280 --> 1:47:54.120]  book called Israel can't wait an obvious reference to the idea that these
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:47:59.240]  ultra-right fascist war mongers in Israel want to attack Iran with the
[1:47:59.240 --> 1:48:04.240]  United States and Obama pretending that somehow they're the soft cop and they
[1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:09.720]  will then allow or encourage their breakaway mad dog Israel to attack and
[1:48:09.720 --> 1:48:15.640]  then we can say we we haven't we've got to support them now or as Tarpley has
[1:48:15.640 --> 1:48:22.000]  said they're going to go through the motions of talk in other ways and
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:25.960]  ultimately them to surrender their sovereignty and their autonomy and their
[1:48:25.960 --> 1:48:29.960]  economy and when they can when they can't do that will say we tried you see
[1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:34.320]  and even now Rahm Emanuel this is total to dual citizen of Israel who's his
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:39.320]  chief chief of staff has said yes if we go through some kind of emotions this
[1:48:39.320 --> 1:48:42.920]  will give us a better opportunity to convince the public that we can attack
[1:48:42.920 --> 1:48:48.360]  Iran and course he was peddling this idea that somehow I'll say this I'll say
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:50.800]  this I'll say this you know we have course you know from time to time agree
[1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:54.520]  with some of what he says and don't the others we have open channels and you know
[1:48:54.520 --> 1:48:57.080]  he has a right to say what he says but it was pretty ridiculous sounding he's
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:49:01.440]  not theologian I guess you know trying to scare Christians that you know may
[1:49:01.440 --> 1:49:05.560]  God was about to attack I mean you know Libya give me a break folks you know
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:09.960]  next we're going to say Mexico's may God or something but the issue here God and
[1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:14.720]  may God you know the issue here is clearly NATO and the globalists are
[1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:20.640]  trying to encircle and start fights with Russia clearly that's wrong and the
[1:49:20.640 --> 1:49:23.320]  globalists told us how great naphthen Gatt would be they told us how great
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:27.040]  attacking Iran's going to be it isn't going to be great none of this is going
[1:49:27.040 --> 1:49:32.560]  to be great and Iran is bending over backwards groveling right now even
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:38.040]  assisting you know the US going after Shiites on their border and putting up
[1:49:38.040 --> 1:49:42.800]  with a lot and we don't want World War three and course he had had this thing
[1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:48.000]  about don't attack Iran the last year he'd shifted gears and now he shifted
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:52.080]  back into yeah we better go into Iran and I have noticed that and suddenly the
[1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:56.000]  talking point has changed as they believe they have left cover through Barack
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:59.600]  Obama and yeah they may stage terror attacks to get it done anything and it's
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:04.360]  going to hurt 99% of the people of the world and it's going to help the
[1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:08.080]  bankers this is the political diversion as the ran corporation said three months
[1:50:08.080 --> 1:50:13.640]  ago they need a global war on the scale of World War two to smoke screen their
[1:50:13.640 --> 1:50:19.080]  financial takeover and so folks Israel is not some shrinking violent it probably
[1:50:19.080 --> 1:50:22.880]  got more like 800 nukes dolphin submarines cruise missiles supersonic
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:28.240]  fighter bombers I mean Israel is what the fourth nuclear power on the planet
[1:50:28.240 --> 1:50:32.840]  and is just absolutely bristling with weapons and high-tech systems and
[1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:37.400]  nobody is going to mess with them and they've got any missile defense systems
[1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:41.560]  you name it Iran is seven years from a nuke and let's just say Iran is
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:44.680]  completely evil and bad fine let's wait a few years before we have World War
[1:50:44.680 --> 1:50:51.200]  three so John I hear you and it's just goes from bad to worse doesn't it okay

[2:00:20.040 --> 2:00:27.480]  Alex Jones it is Thursday the 21st day of May 2009
[2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:31.200]  Jesse Pater is scheduled for the last 30 minutes of the show today Darrell Rodgers
[2:00:31.200 --> 2:00:36.200]  coming up to T-minus 30 minutes in studio talking about viral marketing you
[2:00:36.200 --> 2:00:41.600]  do news bunch of other sites and operations he's starting successful
[2:00:41.600 --> 2:00:46.840]  marketer and businessman who's created a company generating over a billion bucks
[2:00:46.840 --> 2:00:54.200]  so we'll be talking to him coming up in studio Mario live at prison planet TV in
[2:00:54.200 --> 2:01:00.160]  the next segment right now let's go back to your phone calls let's talk to Fred
[2:01:00.160 --> 2:01:06.760]  and Philly you're on the air Fred Alex I want to say I think you did the right
[2:01:06.760 --> 2:01:13.480]  thing in supporting Janet I think that the news report that you aired is is
[2:01:13.480 --> 2:01:21.480]  contradictory on their part they they're implying that you know you did
[2:01:21.480 --> 2:01:29.640]  something wrong the fact is that if there's an eight-year-old in a in a
[2:01:29.640 --> 2:01:34.720]  situation where she's alone she's going to do what is what is demanded of her so
[2:01:34.720 --> 2:01:41.920]  it really is coercion and I think that if you didn't do the support of Janet and
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:46.240]  her daughter then they really would have gone farther because that's their
[2:01:46.240 --> 2:01:50.280]  pattern no they were coming to a raster they were coming to trump stuff up they
[2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:54.680]  had the cops with her we know what they do and I just can't stand here you know
[2:01:54.680 --> 2:01:58.880]  I have a really good lawyer here in town he's a family friend that's really the
[2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:02.400]  only kind of lawyer you can trust these days and he recommended in their law
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:05.560]  firm that one of the and then later I learned he's one of the top family
[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:09.960]  lawyers in Austin and he hates the CPS so he's taking the case with no
[2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:15.160]  retainer and half price for me but I'm still it's still gonna cost thousands
[2:02:15.160 --> 2:02:17.520]  because he's got to do a lot of stuff that you know they're still trying to
[2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:20.560]  take her daughter just now we've at least let them know she's not one of
[2:02:20.560 --> 2:02:24.520]  these poor folks they can corner and just waylay in the dark of night as they
[2:02:24.520 --> 2:02:28.560]  do the ignorant public that doesn't have money and that doesn't have the
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:33.680]  knowledge to defend themselves but it's a very bittersweet victory because I
[2:02:33.680 --> 2:02:38.080]  know there are millions of children every year whose lives they ruin who I
[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:42.840]  can't help and it really you know burns me I mean you know people can call it
[2:02:42.840 --> 2:02:46.520]  old-fashioned or call me weak because I care about all children even children I
[2:02:46.520 --> 2:02:50.440]  don't know but I have that instinct that I want to take on people that go after
[2:02:50.440 --> 2:02:54.040]  kids and that tear up families and they and again oh they're doing it for the
[2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:57.120]  good of the children no no one abuses children more than government that's
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:01.840]  their own facts and it's filled with pedophiles and scum and I declare war on
[2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:05.560]  the scum and we just have to start hating these people I have a deep abiding
[2:03:05.560 --> 2:03:08.760]  it's so deep I can't even describe it the only thing deeper is my love of good
[2:03:08.760 --> 2:03:13.320]  people but I have a hatred so deep that it just gives me incredible power I mean
[2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:16.240]  I'll tell you that right now and I want everybody else to get that hatred of
[2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:21.120]  evil I mean people need to get sure it's more than hatred I am completely set
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:25.920]  against them my entire being is bent against them and I will bring them to
[2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:30.520]  justice because we will resurrect the spirit of liberty we will crush the
[2:03:30.520 --> 2:03:36.000]  new world order with God's help Alex we're all in it together because you're
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:43.400]  talking about a citizen her daughter is a citizen and and we have all the same
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:47.680]  rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution so I mean you did the right
[2:03:47.680 --> 2:03:52.000]  thing now I want to talk about something else with the first with the
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:56.320]  Second Amendment and that is there's a there's a serviceman in Fort Campbell
[2:03:56.320 --> 2:04:02.680]  Kentucky did you cover the the issue of his base requiring him to turn over his
[2:04:02.680 --> 2:04:07.840]  gun information yes we got sent by him I guess he was concerned that we hadn't
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:11.760]  talked about it yet and we we learned it was a month old news and actually been
[2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:16.280]  in the news and that that's we've confirmed it's going on at some other
[2:04:16.280 --> 2:04:19.640]  bases the media is trying to say it's just that base and the commander was
[2:04:19.640 --> 2:04:24.680]  wrong but no the our whole breaking news here is this is not just that base
[2:04:24.680 --> 2:04:28.600]  that's the breaking issue is that they're making him register their guns
[2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:34.240]  off base at many bases and the Marines are doing it too we've confirmed so it's
[2:04:34.240 --> 2:04:38.360]  just outrageous you just the first time in history that they've gone in that
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:43.560]  direction and I I had called up Terry Brownfield when I heard about it and I
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:47.800]  suggested that anyone who's affected by this to try to get a federal court
[2:04:47.800 --> 2:04:53.040]  injunction against it and you know it also would apply to somebody living off
[2:04:53.040 --> 2:04:57.720]  the base maybe even living no no it's outrageous they're coming after the guns
[2:04:57.720 --> 2:05:02.760]  they got bills introduced to ban them hello friends this is Alex Jones I've
[2:05:02.760 --> 2:05:06.240]  told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's

[2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:09.880]  Oregon mark you're on the air welcome hey thank you Alex
[2:09:09.880 --> 2:09:16.520]  good afternoon to you good afternoon to you thank you Alex Alex this past
[2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:23.520]  Monday I was listening to a live broadcast of Rick Wiles show and he
[2:09:23.520 --> 2:09:30.280]  interviewed congressman Steve King of the fifth district of Iowa the
[2:09:30.280 --> 2:09:35.960]  congressman King sits on the judiciary committee and he's been in Congress for
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:41.680]  about seven years he said that I believe this meeting was on that same Monday of
[2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:47.680]  the show about three days ago he said that in committee congressman Al C
[2:09:47.680 --> 2:09:54.640]  Hastings relative to the ongoing hate crimes legislation which is moving
[2:09:54.640 --> 2:10:00.480]  through Congress that congressman Hastings named off 30 different
[2:10:00.480 --> 2:10:06.680]  felios as he termed them such as pedophilia and various necrophilia
[2:10:06.680 --> 2:10:14.120]  perhaps I don't know but 30 felios all together which he proposed and directed
[2:10:14.120 --> 2:10:20.960]  would be covered in the and protected in this upcoming hate crimes bill which is
[2:10:20.960 --> 2:10:25.400]  moving very quickly here oh no that's big news that's confirmed a Reverend
[2:10:25.400 --> 2:10:29.040]  Ted Pike and others of point out the subsections Nambla is involved it
[2:10:29.040 --> 2:10:33.440]  actually protects pedophiles yeah and so they want to come after you with hate
[2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:37.680]  crimes laws for pedophilia because that's who runs things is the pedophile
[2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:42.960]  guilds that's the dominant subgroup out there it goes across racial and
[2:10:42.960 --> 2:10:47.280]  religious lines but that's what we're talking about and then also more
[2:10:47.280 --> 2:10:50.600]  important than even that is see everybody's focused on the hate crimes bill
[2:10:50.600 --> 2:10:56.480]  which is fine but that's nothing because that says if you commit a crime then
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:11:00.080]  we're gonna charge you and prosecute you and give you two or three times more
[2:11:00.080 --> 2:11:03.720]  time in prison if you do it to the protected pedophiles or this or that
[2:11:03.720 --> 2:11:09.200]  group the cyber hold on the cyber bullying act is a million times worse
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:13.440]  and nobody's talking about this in the liberty movement and I don't understand
[2:11:13.440 --> 2:11:17.240]  it it's even in Reuters and Hannah Montana's on TV pushing it you know as
[2:11:17.240 --> 2:11:22.000]  her character to the kids that if you quote bully someone criticize someone
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  online say something that hurt someone's feelings if and that's what they do in
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:28.920]  Europe they say well this could incite violence this could hurt someone's
[2:11:28.920 --> 2:11:34.040]  feelings you get arrested a federal felony in fact guys Google it for folks
[2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:41.240]  on screen Hannah Montana you know or use her real name her stage name also
[2:11:41.240 --> 2:11:45.280]  pulls it up pushes for cyber bullying act and then read the cyber bullying act
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:51.000]  this is the big enchilada this just says no free speech period
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:53.960]  if you wanted to i'm sure the representative king would come on the
[2:11:53.960 --> 2:11:54.800]  show
[2:11:54.800 --> 2:11:56.560]  because he offered an amendment
[2:11:56.560 --> 2:11:59.920]  and committee that same day this past monday i believe
[2:11:59.920 --> 2:12:04.120]  which would have excluded pedophiles in particular from having protections
[2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:06.320]  under this coming legislation
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:07.240]  what happens
[2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:11.840]  alex to the bills uh... excuse me to the state laws which prohibit this i don't
[2:12:11.840 --> 2:12:13.520]  know if there are any federal laws
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:16.360]  which prohibit uh... child molestation
[2:12:16.360 --> 2:12:19.040]  and child abuse sexually
[2:12:19.040 --> 2:12:22.440]  all fifty states must have strict laws against this
[2:12:22.440 --> 2:12:26.480]  is this uh... upcoming hate crimes legislation in congress once
[2:12:26.480 --> 2:12:30.080]  it may be approved is it going to supersede and negate
[2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:33.440]  uh... the legality of all of the state laws
[2:12:33.440 --> 2:12:35.400]  well that's what the feds are doing and
[2:12:35.400 --> 2:12:40.240]  look i didn't ever imagine this i never had an inkling
[2:12:40.240 --> 2:12:43.800]  devil worshippers pedophiles sickos
[2:12:43.800 --> 2:12:47.160]  ran the new world order but when you actually study this
[2:12:47.160 --> 2:12:49.200]  you find out that's who they are
[2:12:49.200 --> 2:12:52.280]  and so of course they're trying to legalize in england
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:54.800]  sex with children as young as ten
[2:12:54.800 --> 2:12:58.560]  and uh... they wanna arrest you if you criticize them see this is what they do
[2:12:58.560 --> 2:13:01.080]  they arrest you if you criticize them
[2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:03.920]  they come after your free speech and that's why
[2:13:03.920 --> 2:13:08.720]  you know uh... whether somebody is a black extremist or a hispanic
[2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:11.560]  extremist or white you know racist or whatever
[2:13:11.560 --> 2:13:15.560]  i don't agree with their views but i'll fight to the death for their views
[2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:18.720]  but see they sell the general public in europe in the u.s and canada australia
[2:13:18.720 --> 2:13:20.920]  in new zealand where they're passing all this
[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:23.840]  all you're not for nazis that want to kill jews are you
[2:13:23.840 --> 2:13:25.760]  you're not for nazi saying that
[2:13:25.760 --> 2:13:27.240]  the holocaust didn't happen
[2:13:27.240 --> 2:13:30.480]  well whether you disagree with that idea or not and whether it's despicable or
[2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:31.440]  not

[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:11.600]  to uh... do this this is going to be so wonderful
[2:14:11.600 --> 2:14:14.800]  and then you go read the bill itself and it actually says
[2:14:14.800 --> 2:14:18.760]  that if you criticize somebody you and they say it hurts their feelings and
[2:14:18.760 --> 2:14:19.940]  they sign an affidavit
[2:14:19.940 --> 2:14:21.280]  you go
[2:14:21.280 --> 2:14:22.760]  to prison

[2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:39.160]  it's her personally
[2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:41.600]  cyberbullying can seriously scar people
[2:14:41.600 --> 2:14:44.240]  leading them to hurt themselves as they go on to say
[2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:47.140]  anything that hurt someone's feelings will be a federal felony
[2:14:47.140 --> 2:14:51.360]  you can read this is actually happening they actually have bills introduced

[2:17:03.440 --> 2:17:06.760]  yeah uh... for about two weeks since we learned of this and then it was racing
[2:17:06.760 --> 2:17:08.200]  through congress and it's got
[2:17:08.200 --> 2:17:09.420]  white house support
[2:17:09.420 --> 2:17:11.560]  and and and
[2:17:11.560 --> 2:17:13.640]  media icon support
[2:17:13.640 --> 2:17:17.240]  the media's pushing this i mean i i watched tv like thirty minutes yesterday
[2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:19.040]  i said this earlier in the show and saw
[2:17:19.040 --> 2:17:21.840]  the news pushing the cyberbullying act and and
[2:17:21.840 --> 2:17:24.120]  and hannah montana
[2:17:24.120 --> 2:17:27.960]  i know that's not her real name but she's she's pushing it as the character
[2:17:27.960 --> 2:17:29.680]  this is a p r stop
[2:17:29.680 --> 2:17:32.560]  and she's pushing it as uh...
[2:17:32.560 --> 2:17:35.560]  miss iris the uh...
[2:17:35.560 --> 2:17:37.900]  the uh...
[2:17:37.900 --> 2:17:39.280]  you know the uh...
[2:17:39.280 --> 2:17:41.640]  real person
[2:17:41.640 --> 2:17:44.800]  and people can be willing to learn talking about the hate crimes bail
[2:17:44.800 --> 2:17:47.240]  i am we linked to it months ago
[2:17:47.240 --> 2:17:49.140]  we've covered a covered last week
[2:17:49.140 --> 2:17:51.440]  that is nothing
[2:17:51.440 --> 2:17:54.000]  i don't know how to explain this to people
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:57.320]  that's bad enough to create it it says
[2:17:57.320 --> 2:18:00.240]  if you mug a heterosexual
[2:18:00.240 --> 2:18:02.120]  uh...
[2:18:02.120 --> 2:18:04.120]  then you get a year in jail
[2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:08.600]  you know basically but if you mug a homosexual you get twenty years in jail
[2:18:08.600 --> 2:18:11.640]  is basically boiling it down like well how about you get twenty years if you
[2:18:11.640 --> 2:18:13.320]  mug either person
[2:18:13.320 --> 2:18:16.400]  you know let's have equal rights under the law
[2:18:16.400 --> 2:18:18.400]  not special rights
[2:18:18.400 --> 2:18:21.160]  and then also what's gonna happen is government
[2:18:21.160 --> 2:18:22.500]  is going to
[2:18:22.500 --> 2:18:24.680]  selectively enforce
[2:18:24.680 --> 2:18:26.560]  this right here
[2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:29.680]  they're going to selectively enforce
[2:18:29.680 --> 2:18:31.620]  the hate crimes bill
[2:18:31.620 --> 2:18:33.440]  on whoever they want
[2:18:33.440 --> 2:18:36.120]  and it's already hard to get the cops out when you get mugged now
[2:18:36.120 --> 2:18:38.960]  is it too busy out writing tickets and and and you know collecting data and
[2:18:38.960 --> 2:18:41.400]  kidnapping kids were under orders
[2:18:41.400 --> 2:18:44.240]  and they're too busy milking the you know the cows
[2:18:44.240 --> 2:18:46.700]  us the slaves so
[2:18:46.700 --> 2:18:49.600]  that's going on that's happening
[2:18:49.600 --> 2:18:53.760]  can i please get people concerned about the cyber bullying act as i mean i i go
[2:18:53.760 --> 2:18:55.000]  around all the other
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:58.040]  patriot sides and i mean i don't see people talking about it i'm like
[2:18:58.040 --> 2:19:00.200]  where is the disconnect
[2:19:00.200 --> 2:19:03.440]  to this where where where it will be we're writing articles every two or three
[2:19:03.440 --> 2:19:04.600]  days about this
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:05.960]  for two weeks straight
[2:19:05.960 --> 2:19:07.880]  and i'm true and it's strange
[2:19:07.880 --> 2:19:11.760]  i'll do some little story or issue it goes mega viral everybody talks about it
[2:19:11.760 --> 2:19:13.040]  and links to it and covers it
[2:19:13.040 --> 2:19:17.080]  and then i will be pointing out major stuff bills roiders
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:18.920]  you know mtv pushing it
[2:19:18.920 --> 2:19:22.880]  and people just don't pick up on it i don't know what i'm supposed to do
[2:19:22.880 --> 2:19:24.220]  this bill is
[2:19:24.220 --> 2:19:25.920]  racing through congress
[2:19:25.920 --> 2:19:27.520]  so is the
[2:19:27.520 --> 2:19:32.360]  uh... no fly no buy guns list will also come out and take your guns
[2:19:32.360 --> 2:19:35.720]  no judge no jury they just put you on a magic list no way to get off of it no
[2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:37.360]  way to tell you why you got on it
[2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:39.560]  just the end of the entire bill of rights
[2:19:39.560 --> 2:19:43.240]  end of habeas corpus end of everything
[2:19:43.240 --> 2:19:45.600]  that's not even a big deal i mean i
[2:19:45.600 --> 2:19:48.160]  i think we know what's a big deal on what's not
[2:19:48.160 --> 2:19:51.080]  so if you want us to will come cover the hate crime bill and repeat the bill
[2:19:51.080 --> 2:19:52.640]  number over and over again
[2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:55.960]  and it's bad but it's nothing compared to this i mean
[2:19:55.960 --> 2:20:01.520]  you know it's like a bb gun compared to the three-fifty-seven magnet
[2:20:01.520 --> 2:20:05.160]  west in a century ago half of the american public grew much of their own

[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:36.520]  John Harman my call list here who is up next all right steward and mass you are
[2:24:36.520 --> 2:24:43.800]  on the air thanks for holding hey good afternoon hey buddy I had a few things
[2:24:43.800 --> 2:24:48.800]  to say that I was just gonna get off the air the first thing that I wanted to say
[2:24:48.800 --> 2:24:55.560]  is using the information on this show I was able to pretty much take over a
[2:24:55.560 --> 2:25:00.680]  radio show at first everyone laughed at me but I was able to take over a show to
[2:25:00.680 --> 2:25:05.120]  the point where the whole start is having local organic food farmers on and
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:10.520]  started talking about you know mercury in the back scenes and all that stuff and
[2:25:10.520 --> 2:25:16.280]  so thanks to you for that I was able to say you see the people in the world
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:19.600]  or exactly the people are only hearing from me what they've always known in
[2:25:19.600 --> 2:25:22.960]  their gut and already had all the pieces to in their mind they just hadn't put
[2:25:22.960 --> 2:25:25.960]  them all together yet or they had already put it together but hadn't found a
[2:25:25.960 --> 2:25:29.920]  focal point and that's what's happening is people know the truth in their gut
[2:25:29.920 --> 2:25:34.360]  when they hear it and this information is explosive right now and it's going to
[2:25:34.360 --> 2:25:38.560]  continue to be explosive and it's going to intensify and the people's hunger for
[2:25:38.560 --> 2:25:42.280]  it's going to intensify that's why they've got counterfeits like Glenn Beck
[2:25:42.280 --> 2:25:45.720]  but those counterfeits are only going to blow up in the establishment's face and
[2:25:45.720 --> 2:25:51.760]  get people to want to then find the real thing yeah absolutely when you get
[2:25:51.760 --> 2:25:55.840]  into a new hobby at first you buy the junkie model of something or you think
[2:25:55.840 --> 2:25:59.000]  you know about it and you find out you got screwed or you know you didn't
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:02.120]  fully understand it and then you find out there's a lot better thing and then
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:06.640]  oh there's even more to know and then somebody claims they've got something
[2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:10.360]  even better and you find out no that wasn't real this was the real McCoy it's
[2:26:10.360 --> 2:26:15.200]  like wine tasting people are do or cigars or some things people like people
[2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:19.560]  are developing a taste for liberty and freedom and true information and they
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:23.640]  are getting more discerning and more informed it's a process we all go
[2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:27.240]  through it go ahead yeah I got people riled up to the point there was like
[2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:30.480]  eighty-year-old women calling up saying we needed to march on Washington but
[2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:34.440]  then I had to go to the point you said we're no we can't march on Washington
[2:26:34.440 --> 2:26:38.800]  they you know and I told I laid out their whole plan for that with neutron
[2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:42.320]  bombs or whatever well I mean I mean well the Pentagon and the British
[2:26:42.320 --> 2:26:45.560]  Ministry of Defense have said we've shown the documents their public on and
[2:26:45.560 --> 2:26:48.760]  Guardians reported on it but they said if people tried to march on Western
[2:26:48.760 --> 2:26:53.360]  capitals that the neutron bomb arsenal is for us or if Congress rebelled or
[2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:55.960]  parliament rebelled and got up and had press coverage and said there's a shadow
[2:26:55.960 --> 2:26:59.160]  government we're arresting them you would see the neutron bombs are basically
[2:26:59.160 --> 2:27:02.400]  already planted in each city probably right under parliament and they just go
[2:27:02.400 --> 2:27:08.760]  and oh terrorist you know so we have to understand we take over the counties the
[2:27:08.760 --> 2:27:14.040]  cities then be aware then have you know intelligence operations exposed they've
[2:27:14.040 --> 2:27:21.000]  got the neutron weapons in place and space-based the the DU Sabo meteor gun
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:27.640]  technology in the encircling Blackmana space planes that's that's
[2:27:27.640 --> 2:27:30.640]  declassifying and I've talked to the former head of Star Wars admitting that
[2:27:30.640 --> 2:27:34.320]  so we have to expose globalist decapitation system for elites the
[2:27:34.320 --> 2:27:38.920]  neutron bomb control grid the financial heart plug they can pull that and make
[2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:43.000]  us collapse and bleed to death as they can stage nuclear attacks clean al-qaeda
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:47.200]  did it get the fully inoculate the public psychologically to their program and
[2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:52.280]  then take over the counties the cities the states from that perspective and
[2:27:52.280 --> 2:27:55.480]  just say no no no to all their programs and then that will render them
[2:27:55.480 --> 2:27:59.640]  defenseless that's why they're trying to shift to their robotic aircraft robotic
[2:27:59.640 --> 2:28:07.080]  tanks pre-programmed hover control drones to to carry out the globalist
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:10.880]  orders so even of their own military says no they can also then launch fake
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:15.280]  attacks with their robot aircraft and say humans did it is you can see the
[2:28:15.280 --> 2:28:19.480]  technocracy they're building the enemy is weak now we expose them the deeper we
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:23.600]  get into this the harder it's going to be to stop Skynet and by the way that's
[2:28:23.600 --> 2:28:26.840]  what they called it 40 years ago would be Skynet with the robotic aircraft the
[2:28:26.840 --> 2:28:30.000]  Air Force said that see when you see movies like Terminator that's throwing
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:33.640]  it in your face but Skynet doesn't work for the machines it works for the
[2:28:33.640 --> 2:28:39.080]  Eugenesis New World Order and they plan a Terminator type scenario for us I just
[2:28:39.080 --> 2:28:41.200]  say two more things real quick sure go ahead
[2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:45.080]  um I called up my spirits were down a couple weeks ago but I'm getting them
[2:28:45.080 --> 2:28:49.160]  back I this and it's funny you bring up CPS because it was over that I thought
[2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:55.720]  CPS for three years lost our kids three times got them back three times but the
[2:28:55.720 --> 2:29:00.200]  last time I went through me under the bus lied that I did some things I did
[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:05.360]  and I'm facing jail time actually but I don't care anyway also I heard Russia is

[2:35:06.600 --> 2:35:11.200]  getting used to this but I'm ruining my hearing with blasting headphones a lot of
[2:35:11.200 --> 2:35:13.880]  talk shows lose their hearing and I'm starting to lose some so I've been told
[2:35:13.880 --> 2:35:18.320]  to go to this because it looks better on TV so forgive me if I'm a bit bit
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:23.280]  flustered here occasionally there is a host of issues we're going to talk
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:29.080]  about Darrell rundus has owned several really big successful companies and
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:33.160]  Darrell also started some very successful international Christian
[2:35:33.160 --> 2:35:36.800]  ministries that are very well known and he'll tell you about some of that and
[2:35:36.800 --> 2:35:39.760]  I and he's come out some of the in the Fed protests with us have been spied on
[2:35:39.760 --> 2:35:44.080]  by the regular army that we confirmed that and he was down at the down at the
[2:35:44.080 --> 2:35:48.320]  Tea Party down in San Antonio my guy saw him down there and he's here in studio
[2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:51.360]  with us today to talk about a host of issues viral marketing some sites he's
[2:35:51.360 --> 2:35:55.480]  starting some some some things he's doing and then he also came down to
[2:35:55.480 --> 2:35:57.720]  Austin from Dallas to give me a donation which we're not really
[2:35:57.720 --> 2:36:02.400]  soliciting but it last when he gave us we did use for a bunch of prizes and
[2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:06.160]  contests we had and I do want to get the space next to this to really build a
[2:36:06.160 --> 2:36:09.880]  proper TV studio I thought going from 3,000 square feet 7,000 square feet
[2:36:09.880 --> 2:36:15.720]  with enough now it's not enough luckily well blessedly right next to us is 7,000
[2:36:15.720 --> 2:36:19.840]  more square feet the economy's imploded cheapest stuff in town $3,000 a month for
[2:36:19.840 --> 2:36:23.360]  7,000 square feet okay and we're signing the deal we're getting it but it's
[2:36:23.360 --> 2:36:26.760]  going to be tough for us financially and with Darrell giving donations and
[2:36:26.760 --> 2:36:29.920]  things I may not have to be up here so much pitching this pitching that because
[2:36:29.920 --> 2:36:33.280]  it's like a meter I got running with all these employees and TV and radio and
[2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:38.120]  almost $30,000 of IT and bandwidth a month I mean I mean it's a lot and as we
[2:36:38.120 --> 2:36:41.960]  get bigger and bigger it becomes greater and greater and Darrell found out found
[2:36:41.960 --> 2:36:45.920]  out that with tyranny crusher one they had $30,000 real bids but the people
[2:36:45.920 --> 2:36:49.640]  bragged they put in fake bids so it got disqualified and they sent us emails
[2:36:49.640 --> 2:36:54.160]  saying you will never get the $50,000 you will fail you will never sell that
[2:36:54.160 --> 2:36:59.160]  bullhorn well it's Darrell's idea they failed today they'll run this tell folks
[2:36:59.160 --> 2:37:02.880]  so what you decided to do hey well I just can't believe people would rip you
[2:37:02.880 --> 2:37:07.000]  off like that I mean I'm enraged that people would take they've been posted on
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:10.440]  their website with the file brag about it does that tell you about the state of
[2:37:10.440 --> 2:37:13.520]  the world today I mean just the evil atrocity they've been posted that the
[2:37:13.520 --> 2:37:17.600]  the the ebay filing with their code and their name and how they put the $5
[2:37:17.600 --> 2:37:21.880]  million bid in to screw it up yeah well their loss is my game I guess what
[2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:28.240]  Alex I'm gonna I'm gonna pay you $50,000 for unbelievable sir one man I can't
[2:37:28.240 --> 2:37:31.640]  wait to go out on the streets with you and and we'll go protest the Fed if I
[2:37:31.640 --> 2:37:35.160]  know that got attacked by MSNBC they cut the wire but you can have it sold you
[2:37:35.160 --> 2:37:39.760]  can't have it no no no hey Darrell thank you so much we're gonna use that to
[2:37:39.760 --> 2:37:43.880]  finish the new TV studio but also you're encouraging folks original idea
[2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:47.000]  unless I want you to take people to turn a Christian woman you found out would be
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:50.760]  to get people to match at the money bomb info works money bomb calm yeah and you
[2:37:50.760 --> 2:37:54.120]  know the bottom line is look Alex I was here what about six months ago you show
[2:37:54.120 --> 2:37:58.120]  me this new place and you hadn't had it done yet and I'm honestly and genuinely
[2:37:58.120 --> 2:38:01.960]  amazed and I'm impressed at what you guys have accomplished was so little if
[2:38:01.960 --> 2:38:05.000]  people knew how hard you worked it's like Michelangelo now I'm not putting
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:09.360]  in Michelangelo's league here but when people were marveling at what he had done
[2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:12.920]  at the Sistine Chapel you know what he said he said if people knew how hard I
[2:38:12.920 --> 2:38:17.080]  had to work to achieve my mastery it would be no mystery at all and that's the
[2:38:17.080 --> 2:38:20.680]  key to what you're doing I mean it's just hard work in fact I thank you for
[2:38:20.680 --> 2:38:23.800]  letting me come here today because I know there's a lot of people out there who
[2:38:23.800 --> 2:38:27.680]  owe the fact that they woke up to the new world order into these evil atrocities
[2:38:27.680 --> 2:38:31.200]  and things that are being committed on the common man today and that the
[2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:34.680]  ultimate question they ask themselves when they first wake up is what what
[2:38:34.680 --> 2:38:38.480]  can I do what can I do and hey it could be wearing a t-shirt it could be buying
[2:38:38.480 --> 2:38:43.320]  a bullhorn I mean it could be anything but do something get up get out speak up
[2:38:43.320 --> 2:38:47.760]  don't shut up and never give up or your your liberties are gone I mean now is
[2:38:47.760 --> 2:38:52.400]  the time to to make a change in fact you can make a difference one person can
[2:38:52.400 --> 2:38:55.080]  make a difference take a look at Alex and in what he's doing he's just a man
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:39:00.200]  Jason Burmese he's just a man I am just a man but God takes one people and he'll
[2:39:00.200 --> 2:39:04.960]  you know duplicate them and he'll create magnificent amazing miraculous even
[2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:09.160]  events occur if somebody's just willing of heart they have the commitment the
[2:39:09.160 --> 2:39:14.040]  dedication determination and the will to carry it out the perseverance that it
[2:39:14.040 --> 2:39:18.640]  takes to get up suit up show up and never give up absolutely Darrell you're
[2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:21.960]  doing a lot of stuff these days for folks that don't know you are tell us a
[2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:24.840]  little bit about yourself and some of the ministries you've started and you're
[2:39:24.840 --> 2:39:27.760]  going to be launching some new alternative media things for everybody to
[2:39:27.760 --> 2:39:32.360]  kind of go around YouTube you're also got a new thing you're doing because
[2:39:32.360 --> 2:39:35.640]  you're always wanting to spread the gospel and even people aren't into the
[2:39:35.640 --> 2:39:40.480]  gospel they might as well know they can win a win a quite a big prize with what
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:43.280]  you're doing there because as you said you've sold your big business your
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:46.320]  attempt now is to wake folks up to the new world order and win souls well
[2:39:46.320 --> 2:39:50.120]  exactly I mean when you pull it all down you're one of my favorite or you're
[2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:53.360]  one of your favorite analogies of mine is the who would trade their eyes for a
[2:39:53.360 --> 2:39:56.440]  million dollars right and if your eyes are merely the windows for yourself and
[2:39:56.440 --> 2:39:59.640]  always tell that wrong start over and tell it okay well basically I say hey
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:03.120]  Alex would you trade your eyes for a million bucks absolutely not how about
[2:40:03.120 --> 2:40:06.560]  a billion never quadrillion never not all the money in the world right you
[2:40:06.560 --> 2:40:09.320]  guys are valuable they're precious to you well if your eyes are merely the
[2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:13.000]  windows for your soul to look out then how much more should your soul be worth
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:16.120]  to you there's just nothing more valuable than someone's soul and that's what
[2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:20.080]  we're really in a battle for this is a struggle against good against evil and I
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:23.000]  would say for a billion bucks I would give my eyes and then use the billion
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:27.240]  dollars to for good right right but but but most people would you give it for
[2:40:27.240 --> 2:40:31.400]  self-gain no no absolutely not you have to be insane I've yet to meet a same
[2:40:31.400 --> 2:40:34.800]  person who trade their eyes for all Bill Gates money okay but the bottom line
[2:40:34.800 --> 2:40:39.040]  is look this is a struggle for good and evil evil is done in darkness the truth
[2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:42.280]  is brought into the light every day you're here under the lights out into the
[2:40:42.280 --> 2:40:45.280]  public look at Bilderberg everything is in secret that's right exactly because
[2:40:45.280 --> 2:40:47.640]  they have things to hide if you if you don't have anything to hide you bring
[2:40:47.640 --> 2:40:52.200]  it into the light so we want to expose people in the the cornerstone to a free
[2:40:52.200 --> 2:40:57.120]  society is a free and independent press without a free and independent press we
[2:40:57.120 --> 2:41:00.640]  don't have a free society so we're doing something that's gonna give people a
[2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:03.760]  chance to make a difference people ask themselves all the time fact just last
[2:41:03.760 --> 2:41:08.160]  month I'm in LA I'm having a breakfast with a very well-known Christian
[2:41:08.160 --> 2:41:11.240]  celebrity and I'm sharing with them some of the things I've learned some of the
[2:41:11.240 --> 2:41:14.680]  things I've woke up to about the Fed and he just had the recent big hit movie
[2:41:14.680 --> 2:41:17.480]  we won't say is right right big hit movie I don't want to bring up his name and
[2:41:17.480 --> 2:41:20.000]  do any name-dropping I know a lot of different people in a lot of high
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:23.200]  places and anyway so you're out there and what happens so you know when you're
[2:41:23.200 --> 2:41:25.720]  a millionaire right and you're successful and you've ran several
[2:41:25.720 --> 2:41:29.200]  successful businesses people inevitably ask you questions about what do you
[2:41:29.200 --> 2:41:31.040]  think about the bailout what do you think about the bankers what do you
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:34.080]  think about the economy and so one thing leads to another course I didn't start
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:37.400]  off with hey 9-11's an inside job they would have thought I was a cook right so
[2:41:37.400 --> 2:41:41.600]  you start in the natural you swing to some of these things these harder truths
[2:41:41.600 --> 2:41:44.880]  that it's hard for people to comprehend because it is so evil it is so
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:48.360]  atrocious you think well how could our government be so wicked how could they
[2:41:48.360 --> 2:41:51.640]  be so evil so so but surely I incrementally increased the amount of
[2:41:51.640 --> 2:41:54.720]  knowledge I'm given this guy and I knew he woke up because he asked the
[2:41:54.720 --> 2:41:59.080]  question we all ask when we first wake up what can I do what can I do and I
[2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:02.200]  said well the first thing you can do is provide and protect your own family
[2:42:02.200 --> 2:42:06.080]  that's your first responsibility under God name our owner and then wake other
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:09.520]  people up do something you don't care what it is use your celebrity lose your
[2:42:09.520 --> 2:42:13.520]  use your television show whatever it is start sowing the seed and and and you
[2:42:13.520 --> 2:42:17.080]  know and I know Alex it's not about winning them or waking them up right
[2:42:17.080 --> 2:42:20.720]  it's also just about sowing that seed and what they do with that knowledge is
[2:42:20.720 --> 2:42:23.480]  up to them after that you don't have to wake them up it's not your job to wake
[2:42:23.480 --> 2:42:26.760]  them up it's your job to speak to your job to warn them that's it you warn them
[2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:30.080]  you wake them up you know and you talk to them you're on the walls of the city
[2:42:30.080 --> 2:42:32.960]  the enemies pouring towards the gates and we're saying hey they're here and
[2:42:32.960 --> 2:42:36.440]  then folks want to be idiots and not not rise up and protect themselves that's
[2:42:36.440 --> 2:42:39.520]  their issue if they want to continue at CDC come and take their kids they want
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:42.720]  to continue to inject their kids with poison that's going to kill them so be
[2:42:42.720 --> 2:42:45.360]  it but it's my job I mean I got to thinking about this my wife and I last
[2:42:45.360 --> 2:42:49.440]  night were talking about how much would you have to hate somebody not to warn
[2:42:49.440 --> 2:42:53.040]  them that they're inadvertently or unwittingly killing their kids by
[2:42:53.040 --> 2:42:56.800]  injecting them or allowing the state to inject them with poisonous facts and it's
[2:42:56.800 --> 2:43:00.120]  a state that's been caught doing thousands and thousands of lethal test
[2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:04.080]  on children and people it's all there I mean these these folks do it over and
[2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:07.760]  over again well we should trust them this time and then the HPV shots killing
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:10.720]  all these girls I mean it's just one thing after another you report on it all
[2:43:10.720 --> 2:43:13.640]  day I mean look at this stack of infant that's just the last few days just the
[2:43:13.640 --> 2:43:16.840]  last few days so I mean how much would you look at this irish priest beat rape
[2:43:16.840 --> 2:43:20.520]  children report I've got this stuff about CPS in Ireland that's run by the
[2:43:20.520 --> 2:43:26.600]  Catholic mass raping guys that are Texas hundreds and hundreds of the CPS are
[2:43:26.600 --> 2:43:31.120]  convicted criminals and pedophiles that was in AP yesterday I never even got to
[2:43:31.120 --> 2:43:34.920]  it on air while I was exposing the child protective services that the bottom
[2:43:34.920 --> 2:43:38.560]  of their pedophiles we all I finally when we wake up we ask ourselves what can
[2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:41.360]  we do and there's a lot of people who call you on air all the time say Alex
[2:43:41.360 --> 2:43:44.320]  you need to do this and Alex you needed that man this one man let me tell you
[2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:47.960]  world you listen you listen good this one man's doing more than a thousand of
[2:43:47.960 --> 2:43:51.400]  you combined already okay so don't keep laying burdens back on him and he
[2:43:51.400 --> 2:43:54.080]  didn't know I was gonna even say these things but that's only some people I
[2:43:54.080 --> 2:43:56.960]  mean I know there are people out there they say oh ox you got to do this now
[2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:00.080]  she gets and that's great but you know what maybe God gave them that idea maybe
[2:44:00.080 --> 2:44:02.960]  they need to take that idea and run with it and get up and go out and go do
[2:44:02.960 --> 2:44:06.160]  something with it you you're doing what God's called you to do okay you're
[2:44:06.160 --> 2:44:09.600]  you're the watchman on the wall you're the point on the tip of the spear that's
[2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:13.160]  gonna be the dagger in the heart of the new world I don't know about that okay
[2:44:13.160 --> 2:44:16.640]  we wanted to give people a platform that big black hearts full of acid that
[2:44:16.640 --> 2:44:19.520]  might be painful be the dagger going in there well you know like you dude
[2:44:19.520 --> 2:44:22.880]  untenacious okay and I like to make a difference I'm not one who wants to
[2:44:22.880 --> 2:44:26.560]  sit on the sidelines satisfied in my own success I want to take what God's given
[2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:29.080]  me and I want to use it to be a blessing to other people and to wake other
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:32.000]  people up and I couldn't think as you know I've talked to you talked to Ted
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:35.200]  Anderson I talked to a lot of people about maybe doing a radio show I think
[2:44:35.200 --> 2:44:38.720]  you should well and that may be but I wanted to do something bigger I said I
[2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:42.200]  don't think small you know me Alex I'm six four that's called me run to source
[2:44:42.200 --> 2:44:45.520]  you may be the t-rex you can call me run to source but on the source you are a
[2:44:45.520 --> 2:44:47.880]  great guy no but I've told you that's what everybody you said over the years
[2:44:47.880 --> 2:44:50.720]  is told you because you've started some media companies other things you need to
[2:44:50.720 --> 2:44:54.120]  get on the radio and I know this this what I'm about to tell you what I'm
[2:44:54.120 --> 2:44:57.400]  about to unleash on the public right now okay this is something that the world
[2:44:57.400 --> 2:45:02.120]  needs see once again the cornerstone to a free and independent country is a free
[2:45:02.120 --> 2:45:05.160]  and independent press but we don't have one you know that and I know that and
[2:45:05.160 --> 2:45:09.400]  let me tell you folks if you're tired of being told the same propaganda over and
[2:45:09.400 --> 2:45:12.760]  over parroted the same five or six stories a day by all the mainstream media
[2:45:12.760 --> 2:45:16.480]  you're gonna love this okay if you want to take control and you ask yourself
[2:45:16.480 --> 2:45:20.040]  what can I do you know what you can do you can do news okay the power to change
[2:45:20.040 --> 2:45:23.000]  the world I don't know if I'm on camera here is right here in the palm there you
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:26.880]  are you're on TV right now it's in the palm of your hand pick up a camera get
[2:45:26.880 --> 2:45:31.840]  up go out and start reporting things we're gonna unleash a new website a lot
[2:45:31.840 --> 2:45:35.960]  like YouTube without the clutter without the fluff without the craziness a true
[2:45:35.960 --> 2:45:40.440]  independent journalistic website where people can upload their news stories okay
[2:45:40.440 --> 2:45:44.280]  and that could be anything from local news to weather to sports to business one
[2:45:44.280 --> 2:45:48.240]  thing I would encourage people to do is what I call TV news review you know go
[2:45:48.240 --> 2:45:53.160]  watch the Glenn Beck show go watch the O'Reilly factor go watch CNBC and CNN and
[2:45:53.160 --> 2:45:56.840]  all those and then a week later make commentary on these comments these liars
[2:45:56.840 --> 2:46:00.520]  are telling you and expose them for the liars that they really are yeah in fact
[2:46:00.520 --> 2:46:03.400]  you've you've always had that idea and I've had that separately and I need to do
[2:46:03.400 --> 2:46:07.840]  that that's my next calling is and you can under fair use do this to play a
[2:46:07.840 --> 2:46:10.880]  little news clips analyze it because instead of me yelling at the TV at night
[2:46:10.880 --> 2:46:15.320]  or everybody else start taking little clips it doesn't matter if you do it
[2:46:15.320 --> 2:46:19.080]  perfectly happy you know you and your house with a camera going okay watch
[2:46:19.080 --> 2:46:22.800]  this clip this is the lies right and just all of us doing it uploading it
[2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:26.440]  everywhere but also on to the site you're gonna be launching right you do
[2:46:26.440 --> 2:46:31.240]  news what can you do you can do news you can get up go out start reporting these
[2:46:31.240 --> 2:46:34.640]  cops that are harassing people or robbing people of their civil rights
[2:46:34.640 --> 2:46:38.320]  hate the week before Christmas is a classic example we're out sharing the
[2:46:38.320 --> 2:46:42.080]  gospel okay just passing out million dollar bills okay no no big deal
[2:46:42.080 --> 2:46:44.960]  everybody loves them tell them people the real reason for the season all of a
[2:46:44.960 --> 2:46:50.000]  sudden out of nowhere to dart police cops were in West End Marketplace tackle a
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:53.960]  guy okay arrest him throw him in cuffs beat him up throw him in the back of the
[2:46:53.960 --> 2:46:58.320]  squad car and charge him with public intoxication now this guy's a Christian
[2:46:58.320 --> 2:47:02.120]  he's not drinking he's out there and he's hanging out gospel tracks that that's
[2:47:02.120 --> 2:47:05.800]  it but they didn't want us out there the week after that the real week before
[2:47:05.800 --> 2:47:09.440]  Christmas they almost threw me and my daughter and a few others in jail for
[2:47:09.440 --> 2:47:13.160]  doing the same thing come to find out I did a little research almost a year to
[2:47:13.160 --> 2:47:18.000]  the day earlier the chief of police from dart in the CEO of dart had sent out a
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:21.560]  memo to all the officers saying they have every right to be on that public
[2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:25.360]  sidewalk and even on the public train passing out those gospel I know why
[2:47:25.360 --> 2:47:30.200]  would the police break the orders of their commanders and the Constitution and
[2:47:30.200 --> 2:47:34.720]  do that because they're today they're like my boots boy like my boots man
[2:47:34.720 --> 2:47:38.120]  they're all fluoride it up and on steroids man what do you expect now not
[2:47:38.120 --> 2:47:41.960]  all officers are bad you know I I pray for police officers every day I pray
[2:47:41.960 --> 2:47:44.880]  gotta protect no you're a really nice guy I've seen it but all over down as the
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:49.000]  cops come up and tell you on city sidewalks you can't be there show the
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:52.480]  camera this little flyers you give out well like these you know hey by the way
[2:47:52.480 --> 2:47:57.280]  I brought you a big donation can you break a big bill so I mean so I mean these
[2:47:57.280 --> 2:48:00.640]  are ways that you know and that's your and even if folks hate Christians out
[2:48:00.640 --> 2:48:03.760]  there and they got a problem it's you're right to go out and have a first
[2:48:03.760 --> 2:48:06.560]  amendment and in fact we got a case against the state fair Texas right now
[2:48:06.560 --> 2:48:08.680]  because they kicked us off the fairgrounds and said we couldn't be
[2:48:08.680 --> 2:48:10.920]  there even though it's owned by Fair Park and then you couldn't be out they
[2:48:10.920 --> 2:48:13.720]  tell the sidewalk in front of it they even threatened to rest us for
[2:48:13.720 --> 2:48:16.720]  criminal trespassing for being out there and now they conceded to that but
[2:48:16.720 --> 2:48:19.240]  we're still in this court case so I can't say a whole lot about it because
[2:48:19.240 --> 2:48:23.880]  it's it's coming up but what I can say is that they asked me a question they
[2:48:23.880 --> 2:48:27.040]  said Darrell how would you feel if a bunch of gays and lesbians were marching
[2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:29.720]  down with the pink police and doing that I mean if we let you do it we got a lot
[2:48:29.720 --> 2:48:32.880]  everybody I said well praise God you know what the Constitution's all about
[2:48:32.880 --> 2:48:36.360]  free speech look I mean I'd agree with your opinion but you're entitled to it
[2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:40.640]  and you have every right and every civil liberty under the Constitution the
[2:48:40.640 --> 2:48:43.480]  United States plus under this system they're gonna be allowed to march you're
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:47.000]  not well that's the thing they're selective oh you know we can't profile
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:50.600]  people at the airport but we can single out you know Christians or wrong
[2:48:50.600 --> 2:48:55.280]  Balkans wrong Paul people or people that believe in or their pro life instead of
[2:48:55.280 --> 2:48:59.160]  pro yeah they're all unless yeah we're on the list they're not exactly and and so
[2:48:59.160 --> 2:49:02.960]  look we need to give people a platform to take to start speaking the truth to
[2:49:02.960 --> 2:49:06.400]  power all right so if they're a little guy or the big guy you live in a little

[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:27.520]  taken it to a new level oh man where he'll say he's ending torture but he's
[2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:31.640]  expanding it he'll say he's fighting CEO bonuses from bailout money and he's

[2:54:20.840 --> 2:54:24.160]  folks about it in fact you know me I'm a silver and gold bug yeah let me have
[2:54:24.160 --> 2:54:27.040]  that let me see that well let me present it to you properly no I just want to
[2:54:27.040 --> 2:54:31.000]  show people I want to show people okay but but what it is it's a pure one out
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:34.480]  silver bar zoom in over here has the tank commandments on it now I don't care
[2:54:34.480 --> 2:54:37.680]  if you're Christian or an atheist or what I don't really care but look if we're
[2:54:37.680 --> 2:54:41.400]  gonna get back to basics Alex there's nothing more fundamental no more basic
[2:54:41.400 --> 2:54:45.040]  in fact our whole society's laws were based on what law the 10 commandments
[2:54:45.040 --> 2:54:49.560]  okay we don't murder people don't lie don't cheat don't kill don't steal and
[2:54:49.560 --> 2:54:52.880]  so on and if we would start to take hold ourselves accountable to that standard
[2:54:52.880 --> 2:54:56.920]  especially the Christians then maybe we'd start to hold other people like our
[2:54:56.920 --> 2:55:00.000]  people you know these plunderers you know quit coveting our property quit
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:04.080]  coveting our resources quit lying quit stealing our money quit overtaxing us and
[2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:08.440]  so on you created this one ounce fine here show Jim again yeah it's a it's a
[2:55:08.440 --> 2:55:10.560]  one ounce silver bar has the 10 commandments on it but that's not what
[2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:14.320]  we're doing I was in genuinely intrigued Alex believe it or not I went out and
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:17.960]  asked thousands of different people who claim to believe in God if they could
[2:55:17.960 --> 2:55:21.240]  name the 10 commandments now they could name 10 sports teams they could name 10
[2:55:21.240 --> 2:55:25.240]  beers they could name 10 celebrities okay but when I asked him to name the 10
[2:55:25.240 --> 2:55:29.960]  commandments you know how many people could do it about 5% okay so I wanted
[2:55:29.960 --> 2:55:33.720]  to give people an awesome incentive to learn the law that of life and of liberty
[2:55:33.720 --> 2:55:38.640]  that's already written on their hearts so I'm giving away $20,000 to anybody who
[2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:43.200]  can list the law in order and do it in 20 seconds I cut this open yeah guys we
[2:55:43.200 --> 2:55:46.920]  give me some scissors so in other words if they'll go to 10andwin.com sites
[2:55:46.920 --> 2:55:50.720]  already live okay it's there and all they got to do in fact if they can't
[2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:54.360]  list the law in order and do it in 20 seconds or less don't worry we put a
[2:55:54.360 --> 2:55:58.280]  two-minute video up on the site called learn the law and we made it so simple
[2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:01.680]  for you to learn how to do it my eight-year-old can do it so we did a
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:05.160]  video of her you know how do they win it online I don't understand what it's
[2:56:05.160 --> 2:56:08.000]  going to be as you go through the registration process there's a site
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:11.280]  coming up there and you get a little intro video it tells you a little bit
[2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:14.640]  about why this crazy guy's given 20 grand away for you to list the law once
[2:56:14.640 --> 2:56:18.160]  you go through the the registration process and I think it's October 28th
[2:56:18.160 --> 2:56:22.080]  somewhere around the end of October we are going to get on the phone live maybe
[2:56:22.080 --> 2:56:25.360]  we do it on your show or do it at somebody else's that's fine but we'll do

[2:56:50.760 --> 2:56:54.000]  and just like the New World Order controls things through money they
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:56.960]  don't really care about money they want souls that's what you want on the other
[2:56:56.960 --> 2:56:59.800]  side that's right we were fighting because control of the minds of men is
[2:56:59.800 --> 2:57:02.560]  everything we want to free them they want to control them but you know what
[2:57:02.560 --> 2:57:06.560]  so so how many winners can you have or we have one winner at the end of the

[3:00:33.640 --> 3:00:41.480]  management classes the whole class and it's being sponsored one by Walmart and
[3:00:41.480 --> 3:00:46.000]  two by the boys and girls scouts I thought that was a little interesting
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:52.680]  yeah yeah they're taking all the major corporations all the major organizations
[3:00:52.680 --> 3:00:55.680]  the Boy Scouts everything and they had this in the Soviet Union and they
[3:00:55.680 --> 3:00:59.640]  admit that's what it is this is reeducation this is political brainwashing
[3:00:59.640 --> 3:01:04.040]  this is going to teach them to notice their sexual difference or to notice
[3:01:04.040 --> 3:01:07.200]  their racial difference and to be obsessed with it and report it and
[3:01:07.200 --> 3:01:10.600]  tattle and the Boy Scouts are being trained to tattle on their parents in
[3:01:10.600 --> 3:01:14.000]  England the US Europe they're being trained to spy on their neighbors they're
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:17.560]  being trained to take on veterans and confiscate guns this is mainstream news
[3:01:17.560 --> 3:01:21.800]  and yes I mean the government's not playing games they know they're losing
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:26.720]  the people and so they're coming in to take over the youth and in the New
[3:01:26.720 --> 3:01:30.440]  York Times Braggs and I've had parents call me in mass you know their kids
[3:01:30.440 --> 3:01:32.880]  come home and say you can't take a bath anymore that's bad for the environment
[3:01:32.880 --> 3:01:36.160]  hey mom that bite bulbs wrong and then you're supposed to encourage them oh
[3:01:36.160 --> 3:01:40.200]  good you've tattled on me then once it's set to do it for the environment they
[3:01:40.200 --> 3:01:43.720]  then bait and switch and by the way what are the guns so so so see they prime it
[3:01:43.720 --> 3:01:47.160]  with something that sounds popular oh they're just tattling and reporting on
[3:01:47.160 --> 3:01:51.320]  you for the environment but now it's going to be for everything and folks you
[3:01:51.320 --> 3:01:55.600]  know there's only a few degrees between liberty and tyranny okay and and once
[3:01:55.600 --> 3:01:58.320]  they have warrantless wiretapping and indefinite detention it can take your
[3:01:58.320 --> 3:02:01.160]  guns because you're on a secret list and they're training your kids to smile on
[3:02:01.160 --> 3:02:05.120]  you it's one more degree and your mass death camps and black uniforms and
[3:02:05.120 --> 3:02:08.280]  marching because scum gets into government evil gets in the government
[3:02:08.280 --> 3:02:12.000]  and it's its nature even when Stalin had total control of Russia no one was
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:16.080]  resisting him he said kill 20 million people you know linen when they were
[3:02:16.080 --> 3:02:18.560]  taking over Ukraine they said there's no one resisting as they said I don't care
[3:02:18.560 --> 3:02:23.440]  continue to kill I want terror more blood and he wrote bizarre poetry that's
[3:02:23.440 --> 3:02:27.040]  public poetry about I want to destroy the earth destroy the sun a great
[3:02:27.040 --> 3:02:30.960]  blackness he would go to a little island with all these white rabbits and they
[3:02:30.960 --> 3:02:33.480]  kind of put that in a Clint Eastwood movie off of that story and when the guy
[3:02:33.480 --> 3:02:36.200]  opens the trunk up there's white rabbits and he's shotgunning them crazy
[3:02:36.200 --> 3:02:40.000]  linen would go and just rip white rabbits apart and roll around for hours
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:43.840]  just just convulsing Darryl Rundus well I just tell you what Alex this is
[3:02:43.840 --> 3:02:47.840]  another good reason why we need to do it you do news I mean take this guy he has
[3:02:47.840 --> 3:02:51.680]  his what is it his daughter his son I can't remember but what a great story
[3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:54.640]  for him to report on he could sit there and interview his daughter and then
[3:02:54.640 --> 3:02:57.760]  upload it to you do news which is gonna ultimately take the place of the
[3:02:57.760 --> 3:03:00.560]  mainstream media because people are fed up with the lies they're being told by
[3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:04.240]  the mainstream media look I own to the world's largest newspaper circulation
[3:03:04.240 --> 3:03:06.840]  sales and marketing firm I've worked with all the biggest newspapers from the
[3:03:06.840 --> 3:03:11.520]  New York Times the LA Times and they're all in it for the money period I've
[3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:14.680]  seen stories thrown on the ground that need to make the front page but they
[3:03:14.680 --> 3:03:18.000]  don't because they're not sensational enough so the bottom line is simply this
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:21.880]  look we need to empower people and one good thing they can do is to bring light
[3:03:21.880 --> 3:03:26.720]  into darkness hey how much darkness can absorb the light none right light always
[3:03:26.720 --> 3:03:30.200]  beats the darkness and when we expose light when we start reporting stories
[3:03:30.200 --> 3:03:34.280]  like this one this guy just called in and upload it to a you do news website
[3:03:34.280 --> 3:03:37.840]  where people can be informed people can be woken up to the truth and to the
[3:03:37.840 --> 3:03:43.880]  reality absolutely Kirk going back to you still there yeah I'm one else I mean
[3:03:43.880 --> 3:03:48.760]  I mean yes I'm aware of what you're saying I can go ahead I said not only am I
[3:03:48.760 --> 3:03:52.920]  gonna interview my daughter like your guest said I'm actually I have a
[3:03:52.920 --> 3:03:57.760]  interview or not an interview but an appointment with her teacher and I'm
[3:03:57.760 --> 3:04:04.360]  also in in my face of trying to get the school board here to get back in touch
[3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:08.080]  with me because like you had mentioned the Soviet style schooling I'd read
[3:04:08.080 --> 3:04:11.840]  Charlotte Isherbeets coming down of America and after I read that and then
[3:04:11.840 --> 3:04:16.320]  this was put in front of my face I knew exactly what I was confronting yeah and
[3:04:16.320 --> 3:04:20.400]  first it starts with first it starts with sensitivity training then it's are
[3:04:20.400 --> 3:04:23.320]  your parents being mean to you I mean it's like this little girl in the office
[3:04:23.320 --> 3:04:26.720]  they called all the kids into the to the computer lab took them one and after
[3:04:26.720 --> 3:04:30.760]  the other would look at their legs say is mommy is mommy mean to you are they
[3:04:30.760 --> 3:04:33.800]  sometimes rude and tell you not to do jobs it's even how to trick them and
[3:04:33.800 --> 3:04:37.600]  they're little girls like yes oh we're gonna take you from your mommy then I
[3:04:37.600 --> 3:04:40.520]  mean would it be great to be an independent news journalist and say hey
[3:04:40.520 --> 3:04:44.960]  I'm with you do news I'm doing expose a and I'm gonna get behind it I'd like to

[3:10:06.080 --> 3:10:08.800]  doing it better than I could in many ways and the activists you know they're
[3:10:08.800 --> 3:10:12.200]  going to these media events where the establishment is meeting and taking them
[3:10:12.200 --> 3:10:14.840]  over just with you know political questions and things and getting the
[3:10:14.840 --> 3:10:18.800]  news and the system realizes that the people that love liberty and freedom and

[3:11:56.800 --> 3:12:00.440]  priority is someone's soul while they will start in the natural and tell people
[3:12:00.440 --> 3:12:04.440]  about the Fed or about the evil tyrannies or the craziness that's going on in
[3:12:04.440 --> 3:12:08.000]  Washington D.C. or you know any of these other things we know ultimately if that
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:11.320]  person wakes up continues to fight the new world order but ends up in hell in

[3:12:17.480 --> 3:12:19.680]  future and I want to tell you you know you say you're starting with something
[3:12:19.680 --> 3:12:23.280]  big it is big for you start a radio show I'm the one that's been pushing you and
[3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:26.440]  Ted's offered you one you really should start at least a three hour weekend show
[3:12:26.440 --> 3:12:30.240]  and also simulcast it on your new TV station we're gonna do we're gonna do
[3:12:30.240 --> 3:12:33.640]  on a run this was gonna call the run this report and in 60 days we'll go beta

[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:45.600]  and win.com that looks really good you so you got some good guys got good media
[3:12:45.600 --> 3:12:49.600]  guys we got great web work you know I'm just having caught up on the curve when
[3:12:49.600 --> 3:12:52.200]  it comes no I know people wanted last year's money bomber like where's the
[3:12:52.200 --> 3:12:55.840]  studio it took me months to find the cheapest best place then I had to move
[3:12:55.840 --> 3:12:59.880]  do all the contracts took them months had to move in put it all in while I was
[3:12:59.880 --> 3:13:02.960]  doing everything else then get in here and now we're ready to go to the next
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:05.920]  level that's what I mean it takes time when you're small I think exactly I
[3:13:05.920 --> 3:13:09.120]  think people there's a big disconnect between mainstream media and what you're
[3:13:09.120 --> 3:13:11.960]  able to accomplish because they got unlimited literally unlimited amounts
[3:13:11.960 --> 3:13:15.000]  of money it's like the government they don't care about how much money they
[3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:18.320]  spent because they never have to pay it back so those meet mainstream media they
[3:13:18.320 --> 3:13:21.800]  can throw billions and billions and billions of people's dollars at it and
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:25.400]  they get bailout after they go look at what we've done though with the equivalent
[3:13:25.400 --> 3:13:29.800]  of one one hundredth or one one thousand what they do incredible and think what
[3:13:29.800 --> 3:13:33.640]  other people can do but I'm I'm done running about that the point is we can
[3:13:33.640 --> 3:13:38.240]  win if you take action there are a lot of you smarter than me and Darrell more
[3:13:38.240 --> 3:13:41.160]  active we've all got different gifts different combinations of those gifts
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:43.960]  and you do news isn't the answer to everything once again it could be pick
[3:13:43.960 --> 3:13:47.920]  up your bullhorn paint wear a t-shirt like we do pass out some some literature
[3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:53.240]  break the ice with people here's a great way to get a CD a DVD or you know
[3:13:53.240 --> 3:13:56.600]  whatever message in somebody's hands you know I gotta say is hey do you like the
[3:13:56.600 --> 3:14:01.440]  government what do you say no there you'll need this okay now I say do you
[3:14:01.440 --> 3:14:05.520]  like the government say yes yes oh you need this okay so just ask a question
[3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:08.760]  no matter what they say hey do you live here in town yeah I do oh great you'll
[3:14:08.760 --> 3:14:13.120]  need this everybody'll take what I do 90% is like what's an Obama deception hey
[3:14:13.120 --> 3:14:16.320]  this is a really wild film about Obama you ought to check it out right but
[3:14:16.320 --> 3:14:21.080]  somebody you like Obama do you like Obama no oh you'll need this you'll
[3:14:21.080 --> 3:14:23.680]  like this this great DVD you'll like this oh you like Obama oh here you'll
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:27.200]  like this you like this DVD so whatever they say yes or no it's all I've told
[3:14:27.200 --> 3:14:30.640]  listeners and of course you're a more professional salesman than I am I just
[3:14:30.640 --> 3:14:33.680]  you know doing it in a lately but I'm always kind of you're confident and
[3:14:33.680 --> 3:14:37.880]  happy people will then take the info but it looks like I've got this for you
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:41.200]  there's an old saying this is if you don't seem interested how they gonna be so
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:43.760]  I mean if you're not excited about what you're doing how they're gonna get
[3:14:43.760 --> 3:14:47.360]  excited about what you're doing so yeah enthusiasm is the key you got to go with
[3:14:47.360 --> 3:14:51.160]  zeal but not with not on with no knowledge you got to have wisdom to go
[3:14:51.160 --> 3:14:53.880]  with that zeal you got too much zeal and no wisdom you're gonna scare people off
[3:14:53.880 --> 3:14:56.720]  you can scare all the fish away but when you go fishing you gotta be quiet you
[3:14:56.720 --> 3:15:00.200]  gotta be stealthy and you got to use the right bait so bait your hook with
[3:15:00.200 --> 3:15:03.480]  certain questions that are leading okay well it doesn't matter if they say yes
[3:15:03.480 --> 3:15:07.680]  or no hey do you love our government hey do you like taxes hey do you like green
[3:15:07.680 --> 3:15:11.400]  hey do you are you married whatever question it doesn't matter what they
[3:15:11.400 --> 3:15:14.560]  say if they say yes or no say hey well you'll like this or hey you'll need this
[3:15:14.560 --> 3:15:18.520]  that the key is so in those seeds once again they won't all take root they all
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:22.200]  won't bear fruit but the bottom line is you just keep being you get the seeds in
[3:15:22.200 --> 3:15:25.280]  the ground it's gonna happen let's take some more calls Catalina in Michigan
[3:15:25.280 --> 3:15:30.120]  you're on the air with Darryl Rondis go ahead Catalina hello hi Catalina
[3:15:30.120 --> 3:15:35.920]  hi Alex how are you good I'm good I'm excited well you know what I want to
[3:15:35.920 --> 3:15:40.680]  tell you my husband was driving through Detroit he was doing a jab and he
[3:15:40.680 --> 3:15:44.440]  called me up immediately goes Catalina you wouldn't believe what I just saw and
[3:15:44.440 --> 3:15:50.000]  I'm like what he does an Obama gas station and it was in Wyoming in
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:54.240]  Plymouth Road and he said they had Obama hats out there and t-shirts and they're
[3:15:54.240 --> 3:15:57.680]  selling all about Obama restaurants in New York
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:16:04.360]  Obama it scared the hell out of me I'm like what the heck's going on here but you
[3:16:04.360 --> 3:16:09.320]  know I wanted to tell you I am selling the seeds I belong to several business
[3:16:09.320 --> 3:16:16.000]  networks I'm giving out DVDs I'm talking to people I'm giving them your
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:20.040]  website I've just been opening up eyes left and right and whenever I get a new
[3:16:20.040 --> 3:16:24.080]  email I I always send it out or something interesting off your website
[3:16:24.080 --> 3:16:28.960]  and people are asking questions and people are starting to wake up but my
[3:16:28.960 --> 3:16:34.240]  biggest concern is we're waking everyone up and you kind of blew my idea of
[3:16:34.240 --> 3:16:39.560]  overthrowing the government so what do you do to stop all this tyranny a stop
[3:16:39.560 --> 3:16:43.720]  all this terrorism you just start saying no to corruption and you start getting
[3:16:43.720 --> 3:16:46.720]  involved in going to city council and speaking and going to church and speaking
[3:16:46.720 --> 3:16:52.000]  out this new world order will fall if you just say no no no there's more good
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:55.240]  people there are evil if we just take action and educate others this thing
[3:16:55.240 --> 3:16:58.360]  will fall I appreciate your call Catalina great call and that was a question I
[3:16:58.360 --> 3:17:00.960]  wanted to have you on today about because you're always so articulate over the
[3:17:00.960 --> 3:17:03.640]  phone about it want to have you back soon Darrell or over the phone at least
[3:17:03.640 --> 3:17:07.280]  something you drop down from Dallas Romans 13 taking completely out of
[3:17:07.280 --> 3:17:10.560]  context these you say you're talking to Christians they're like oh I'm just
[3:17:10.560 --> 3:17:13.560]  gonna let it all come and let it in even if it is the end of the world don't
[3:17:13.560 --> 3:17:18.360]  we have to warn people absolutely I mean that is just another excuse for people
[3:17:18.360 --> 3:17:22.360]  not to face their fear and to get up and get out and do something I mean we are
[3:17:22.360 --> 3:17:27.040]  called to be the light of the world as a Christian I mean I am I'm just you know
[3:17:27.040 --> 3:17:30.920]  when I'm get sick to my stomach when I think about all the apathy within the
[3:17:30.920 --> 3:17:33.960]  church today it's not just people in America but Christians in particular
[3:17:33.960 --> 3:17:38.080]  ought to be the ones leading the charge against the evil deeds done in darkness
[3:17:38.080 --> 3:17:42.280]  there they're called to expose those deeds done in darkness and yet every
[3:17:42.280 --> 3:17:45.360]  time I even share with them about a corrupt police officer or about a
[3:17:45.360 --> 3:17:48.640]  politician who's lying or cheating or stealing you know what they say they
[3:17:48.640 --> 3:17:52.160]  saw a Romans 13 got a submit to authority you know what Poppy Kosh I
[3:17:52.160 --> 3:17:56.280]  say hey you know what well to what authority Jesus was submitting to when
[3:17:56.280 --> 3:17:59.000]  he stood up to the Pharisees in the Sadducees and called them sons of hell
[3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:02.680]  and brutal vipers and hypocrites to what authority were Paul and all the other
[3:18:02.680 --> 3:18:05.680]  apostles or all the other early Christians thrown to the lions because
[3:18:05.680 --> 3:18:09.160]  they wouldn't submit to the tyranny and the authority of the people that were
[3:18:09.160 --> 3:18:12.760]  above them no if you continue to re Romans 13 which you come to realize is
[3:18:12.760 --> 3:18:16.560]  one it says look if you owe respect give respect okay so in other words hey if
[3:18:16.560 --> 3:18:20.120]  they come to arrest you don't arrest us don't resist okay you know they don't
[3:18:20.120 --> 3:18:22.640]  deserve it they don't earn it but hey you know what I've seen you get arrested
[3:18:22.640 --> 3:18:26.080]  in New York City and what did you do did you throw a fit did you resist no you
[3:18:26.080 --> 3:18:28.920]  went with them and then no because then they lost if I'd have fought back they
[3:18:28.920 --> 3:18:31.680]  would have won one that's right it's like Gandhi it made them look bad that's
[3:18:31.680 --> 3:18:36.200]  right so civil disobedience that's what we need civil is the keyword civil
[3:18:36.200 --> 3:18:40.240]  disobedience but moreover look our governing authority isn't the politicians
[3:18:40.240 --> 3:18:43.880]  okay they work for us the governing authority if we had a if we had a godly
[3:18:43.880 --> 3:18:47.440]  government it would be and plus this is a new government new form where we the
[3:18:47.440 --> 3:18:51.760]  people not a king that's it we're not subjects and and so that means render
[3:18:51.760 --> 3:18:55.480]  under Caesar that's us that's right we are Caesar the Constitution is our
[3:18:55.480 --> 3:18:58.440]  governing authority and when you see someone breach that Constitution you
[3:18:58.440 --> 3:19:01.880]  ought to get up stand exactly when the police and the military and the
[3:19:01.880 --> 3:19:04.840]  government violates the bill of Constitution they're violating Romans
[3:19:04.840 --> 3:19:08.680]  13 they ought to go to jail we ought to hold them accountable I mean I'm like
[3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:12.560]  with Ron Paul or Chuck Norse man I'd like to line up all those people and get
[3:19:12.560 --> 3:19:15.840]  with Ron Paul and say which one of these guys is the crooks and we'll just throw
[3:19:15.840 --> 3:19:18.280]  them in the heat pile if they don't want to go we'll let Chuck put them in a

[3:20:03.680 --> 3:20:07.560]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[3:20:07.560 --> 3:20:11.320]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[3:20:11.320 --> 3:20:15.000]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:18.280]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[3:20:18.280 --> 3:20:22.400]  again so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[3:20:22.400 --> 3:20:27.840]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an
[3:20:27.840 --> 3:20:32.040]  endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best
[3:20:32.040 --> 3:20:35.800]  part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you
[3:20:35.800 --> 3:20:39.920]  actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them

[3:20:59.360 --> 3:21:04.760]  survival seed bank dot com in the new world order is war against humanity
[3:21:04.760 --> 3:21:09.600]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear and we've got to give them a stake in
[3:21:09.600 --> 3:21:14.200]  creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see the
[3:21:14.200 --> 3:21:18.840]  Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[3:21:18.840 --> 3:21:23.400]  interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging yeah but since
[3:21:23.400 --> 3:21:27.800]  day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement

[3:25:30.680 --> 3:25:34.240]  the radio a Jesse Ventura because I we didn't we have hours and hours we didn't
[3:25:34.240 --> 3:25:37.240]  put this on the web for some reason and I noticed it's all over the news when he
[3:25:37.240 --> 3:25:41.280]  talks about you know he could waterboard chaining and making him say he killed
[3:25:41.280 --> 3:25:44.360]  Sharon Tate and how ridiculous waterboarding is here's part of that
[3:25:44.360 --> 3:25:47.600]  clip we'll go out of break come back with the rest of it and go live to Jesse
[3:25:47.600 --> 3:25:57.000]  Ventura stay with us our country today is not the country that I defended when
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:26:03.800]  I was in the service back in the 1970s and 60s because to back in those days you
[3:26:03.800 --> 3:26:13.400]  had watching back in those days you are you still had to be charged with the
[3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:19.680]  crime before you were guilty of it and today it seems that and you back in
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:27.160]  those days you had to be charged with the crime to be held it seems today now
[3:26:27.160 --> 3:26:32.680]  they can arrest you they can hold you for an undetermined as long as they feel
[3:26:32.680 --> 3:26:36.320]  like it like they're doing in Guantanamo the military Commission's access they
[3:26:36.320 --> 3:26:41.200]  can grab which is absurd well I mean I mean how is it that the people running
[3:26:41.200 --> 3:26:44.040]  things aren't the bad guys on saying America is the bad guys we all have
[3:26:44.040 --> 3:26:47.560]  seized the government when they wrote memos saying it's okay to torture
[3:26:47.560 --> 3:26:51.880]  people's children in front of their parents it's okay to kill them if you
[3:26:51.880 --> 3:26:55.560]  didn't mean to kill them under the torture or the enhanced interrogation
[3:26:55.560 --> 3:27:00.120]  techniques and so they played the lawyer game of saying well we don't call
[3:27:00.120 --> 3:27:04.960]  electroshocks are pulling out fingernails we don't call it torture we
[3:27:04.960 --> 3:27:08.640]  call it enhanced interrogation and then play that lawyer mind game can you
[3:27:08.640 --> 3:27:13.040]  speak I think I don't know about all of that but I will speak directly about
[3:27:13.040 --> 3:27:19.840]  waterboarding I mean specifically about torture well no I am but I will only
[3:27:19.840 --> 3:27:27.280]  speak about waterboarding I was waterboarding I was waterboarded by my
[3:27:27.280 --> 3:27:35.000]  own country now if that's if we call waterboarding torture then why do we
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:41.120]  torture our own soldiers and I'm not saying waterboarding isn't torture it
[3:27:41.120 --> 3:27:47.520]  is I deem it as torture but yet I was waterboarded everybody that I knew was
[3:27:47.520 --> 3:27:51.240]  waterboarded because it was part of what they called Sears school which was
[3:27:51.240 --> 3:27:57.560]  survival escape resistance and evasion it was a required course if you were
[3:27:57.560 --> 3:28:01.400]  going into the combat zone back in the era of Vietnam I'm sure it's probably
[3:28:01.400 --> 3:28:04.880]  still required today they were getting them ready to be tortured and to resist
[3:28:04.880 --> 3:28:09.560]  and and and it's listed in those army manuals as torture so that just proves
[3:28:09.560 --> 3:28:13.640]  the White House later saying it isn't torture well and my simple response to
[3:28:13.640 --> 3:28:19.280]  all this Alex is I would like to take our five-time deferred vice president
[3:28:19.280 --> 3:28:24.760]  Dick Cheney I would like to waterboard him and let him then make the
[3:28:24.760 --> 3:28:28.760]  determination having been waterboarded then we'll ask him whether he thinks
[3:28:28.760 --> 3:28:32.880]  it's torture or not I got a feeling he dropped dead with the heart that he has
[3:28:32.880 --> 3:28:37.440]  today if you waterboarded Dick Cheney I feel that he would become a fatality
[3:28:37.440 --> 3:28:42.440]  because well his weak heart wouldn't be able to take it but my point being on
[3:28:42.440 --> 3:28:47.480]  doing that is I think these people that determine what torture is or isn't I
[3:28:47.480 --> 3:28:53.640]  think they should first have it done to them physically and then let them make
[3:28:53.640 --> 3:28:57.680]  an actual determination on whether they felt it was torture or not can you
[3:28:57.680 --> 3:29:02.560]  describe what waterboarding was like drowning it gives a complete sensation
[3:29:02.560 --> 3:29:06.960]  that you are drowning what did they do they strap you down they put a towel
[3:29:06.960 --> 3:29:12.880]  across your face and they start pouring water into the towel and naturally your
[3:29:12.880 --> 3:29:17.120]  mouth and that can't consume all the water you can't drink it quick enough as
[3:29:17.120 --> 3:29:21.640]  they pour it and it gives you the sensation it's going up your nose it's
[3:29:21.640 --> 3:29:26.160]  going down your throat and it gives you the complete feeling that you are
[3:29:26.160 --> 3:29:30.880]  drowning even though you're not the moment they stop it you know then it'll
[3:29:30.880 --> 3:29:34.920]  it'll just it'll subside but that's the field waterboarding have another one
[3:29:34.920 --> 3:29:38.880]  they put your head completely I don't know okay I don't know about that one yeah
[3:29:38.880 --> 3:29:43.960]  the only kind we don't know the only kind we got was the field waterboarding

[3:33:18.800 --> 3:33:21.560]  that little clip of Jesse Ventura when he first talked about waterboarding
[3:33:21.560 --> 3:33:24.200]  chaining I was the first time he were talking about it that I knew of and now
[3:33:24.200 --> 3:33:28.080]  it's big news today we should have put that clip on the web but let's go ahead
[3:33:28.080 --> 3:33:30.880]  and go back to that video here it is and you describe what waterboarding was
[3:33:30.880 --> 3:33:36.120]  like drowning it gives a complete sensation that you are drowning what did
[3:33:36.120 --> 3:33:40.200]  they do they they strap you down they put a towel across your face and they
[3:33:40.200 --> 3:33:46.120]  start pouring water into the towel and naturally your mouth and that can't
[3:33:46.120 --> 3:33:51.240]  consume all the water you can't drink it quick enough as they pour it and it
[3:33:51.240 --> 3:33:55.040]  gives you the sensation it's going up your nose it's going down your throat and
[3:33:55.040 --> 3:34:00.040]  it gives you the complete feeling that you are drowning even though you're not
[3:34:00.040 --> 3:34:05.360]  the moment they stop it you know then it'll know it'll subside but that's
[3:34:05.360 --> 3:34:08.480]  the field waterboarding have another one they put your head completely I don't
[3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:12.600]  know okay I don't know about that one yeah the only kind we don't know that
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:17.240]  I the only kind we got was the field waterboarding back in the days of the
[3:34:17.240 --> 3:34:21.840]  early 70s well that's the classic one man and they did it to all of us at Sears
[3:34:21.840 --> 3:34:27.160]  School it was part of the training and so my argument there is if waterboard is
[3:34:27.160 --> 3:34:32.800]  indeed torture which I think it is how come we allow it to torture and and for
[3:34:32.800 --> 3:34:42.160]  us seals UDT seal guys giving us waterboard they didn't it was irrelevant
[3:34:42.160 --> 3:34:47.920]  no and I'll say that it was irrelevant because in our platoons and in all the
[3:34:47.920 --> 3:34:53.800]  people that I served with we all had an agreement we would never be captured
[3:34:53.800 --> 3:35:00.240]  will die first so why would I need to face the waterboard if I'm dead there
[3:35:00.240 --> 3:35:05.080]  didn't all of us were under an agreement that we will die first we will not be
[3:35:05.080 --> 3:35:11.440]  captured we will go down in a blaze of glory so why did I need to be waterboarded
[3:35:11.440 --> 3:35:17.080]  and when I had already made a conscious decision that if if it had not to the
[3:35:17.080 --> 3:35:22.320]  position where I felt I was going to be captured I would take death first and
[3:35:22.320 --> 3:35:26.520]  and you know and I would stay my attitude was I'll take three or four of
[3:35:26.520 --> 3:35:31.760]  them with me before I go because always remember the seals we don't get mad we
[3:35:31.760 --> 3:35:41.200]  get even that's how we operate I mean you know but so to me I felt that the
[3:35:41.200 --> 3:35:46.040]  waterboarding and the whole POW thing was irrelevant to us because there's
[3:35:46.040 --> 3:35:50.840]  never been a seal captured nor do I believe where will there ever will be
[3:35:50.840 --> 3:35:56.680]  one because the seal will die first in our type of operation you know the only
[3:35:56.680 --> 3:35:59.960]  way they capture the seal is if the seal didn't know he was going to get
[3:35:59.960 --> 3:36:05.400]  captured you know and then okay captured there is Jesse Ventura was
[3:36:05.400 --> 3:36:08.680]  somewhere in time six months ago when he was here in Austin Texas what a great
[3:36:08.680 --> 3:36:13.920]  guy in person just a regular guy but a quite a quite an individual quite a
[3:36:13.920 --> 3:36:16.520]  presence I've never been around anybody in my life there are a lot of famous
[3:36:16.520 --> 3:36:19.920]  people who has the presence of Jesse Ventura and the energy people say I
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:23.800]  wear him out I was wore out after a few days hanging out with this guy and he's
[3:36:23.800 --> 3:36:28.040]  gonna come on for a full hour coming up on June 1st he's been on a huge media
[3:36:28.040 --> 3:36:31.760]  blitz with a paperback of his don't stop the revolution without me put up by a
[3:36:31.760 --> 3:36:36.440]  sky horse publishing a big bestseller and he's got a lot of news for us today and
[3:36:36.440 --> 3:36:40.520]  I got a lot of questions for him the 25 minutes we've got left Jesse Ventura
[3:36:40.520 --> 3:36:44.400]  thanks for coming on with us good to have you back here hi Alex I guess it's
[3:36:44.400 --> 3:36:50.160]  nice to be back but I don't know Mexico gets more attractive all the time it
[3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:53.440]  absolutely does are you kidding I would love to be down there in the beach in
[3:36:53.440 --> 3:36:57.600]  the surf as well I was I went down to Mexico for a week a few months ago and
[3:36:57.600 --> 3:37:00.520]  I wanted to stay speaking of Mexico let's bring up a question you haven't
[3:37:00.520 --> 3:37:04.320]  been asked what do you think about all the hype of this flu a couple people die
[3:37:04.320 --> 3:37:08.200]  and they act like it's the end of the world and Obama saying that we may all
[3:37:08.200 --> 3:37:12.880]  be forced to take an inoculation in the fall well you know it's certainly
[3:37:12.880 --> 3:37:18.160]  something that you don't poo poo you know anytime you get any a type of
[3:37:18.160 --> 3:37:21.960]  sickness like this you need to pay attention to it but I think it was
[3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:27.160]  completely overhyped by the media to put the country again into a scare pattern
[3:37:27.160 --> 3:37:32.960]  which seems to be what the media enjoys to do now there's two cars fear and
[3:37:32.960 --> 3:37:37.960]  now and have everyone living in fear what they need to understand is okay if
[3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:43.400]  there were 1500 cases of it in Mexico City yes that's something to be very
[3:37:43.400 --> 3:37:48.160]  concerned about I feel the Mexicans I was down there they did a terrific job
[3:37:48.160 --> 3:37:52.080]  with what they could do they closed all the schools they shut down all the
[3:37:52.080 --> 3:37:55.760]  soccer games they did everything conceivably they could do but remember
[3:37:55.760 --> 3:38:01.760]  Mexico City is a city what two or three times the size of New York yeah it's
[3:38:01.760 --> 3:38:08.240]  30 plus million 20 million people live there 100 cases of something is not that
[3:38:08.240 --> 3:38:13.920]  large and I'm not saying it shouldn't be looked at of course but when I came home
[3:38:13.920 --> 3:38:18.560]  I went to the airport because I flew this time they made you fill out a
[3:38:18.560 --> 3:38:22.000]  questionnaire and they asked you questions about your you know how you
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:25.760]  felt and then they actually had this device where they touched it to your
[3:38:25.760 --> 3:38:30.280]  wrist and it took your temperature and they wrote that down and if you went up
[3:38:30.280 --> 3:38:36.160]  to fly out if your temperature was too high you didn't get on the plane amazing
[3:38:36.160 --> 3:38:40.120]  but Mexico did everything they could within their power when they learned
[3:38:40.120 --> 3:38:44.200]  that the swine flu was going around that they did everything conceivably as a
[3:38:44.200 --> 3:38:49.320]  you know a poor nation that they could possibly do well governor I agree with
[3:38:49.320 --> 3:38:53.240]  you but I agree with the first thing you said this was used to create hype and
[3:38:53.240 --> 3:38:57.000]  fear and then to openly introduce we might need to have martial law there's
[3:38:57.000 --> 3:39:02.240]  gonna be another breakout soon and and it's this whole infrastructure getting
[3:39:02.240 --> 3:39:05.520]  to the big national controversy you've caused quite a buzz and help really I
[3:39:05.520 --> 3:39:09.680]  think single-handedly push it back into the spotlight that Cheney and Bush
[3:39:09.680 --> 3:39:14.040]  committed all these crimes ordered torture and then burn their own underlings
[3:39:14.040 --> 3:39:17.440]  and sent them to prison for it and are now denying it when we have their own
[3:39:17.440 --> 3:39:22.880]  memos from Gonzales and others and Bush's speech what should be done what's
[3:39:22.880 --> 3:39:26.680]  your idea a hearing in Congress they'll just whitewash it I mean if we don't
[3:39:26.680 --> 3:39:30.840]  bring Bush and Cheney to Justice and of Obama covers for him as he said he's
[3:39:30.840 --> 3:39:34.200]  gonna quote move forward and I mean what do we do about this in you know from
[3:39:34.200 --> 3:39:38.560]  your view first of all Alex let's understand why the president wants to
[3:39:38.560 --> 3:39:45.400]  move forward because the Democrats are involved too yes you know good point now
[3:39:45.400 --> 3:39:49.560]  maybe they didn't order it but the in my opinion they certainly knew what was
[3:39:49.560 --> 3:39:53.680]  going on and they didn't step forward because of that you know let's remember
[3:39:53.680 --> 3:39:59.600]  Democrats truly don't have spines for the most part and so they condoned it
[3:39:59.600 --> 3:40:04.040]  went along with it that's why they don't want to continue with it it's because
[3:40:04.040 --> 3:40:08.600]  whenever the government tells you it's time to move on that means that both
[3:40:08.600 --> 3:40:13.320]  parties are involved in both of them did something wrong they don't want you to
[3:40:13.320 --> 3:40:18.160]  know about it so they want you to move on and so that's the dilemma you're
[3:40:18.160 --> 3:40:22.720]  faced with and in light of the fact that it's all basically all Democrats and
[3:40:22.720 --> 3:40:26.600]  Republicans in the Congress and everywhere out there they're gonna move on
[3:40:26.600 --> 3:40:31.400]  and we'll be left like we always are Alex yelling out they're going where's
[3:40:31.400 --> 3:40:36.640]  justice well that's my big this will again will have been lost or blinded
[3:40:36.640 --> 3:40:41.040]  well that's my question to you I mean from your perspective how do we get out
[3:40:41.040 --> 3:40:44.680]  of this left right where the as you described when we interviewed you two
[3:40:44.680 --> 3:40:49.720]  different wrestlers you know play the bad guy the good guy but really they're
[3:40:49.720 --> 3:40:54.040]  on the same team how do we get past that and ever get the special interest in
[3:40:54.040 --> 3:40:57.760]  these elites out of the way that are doing this to us well it's that simple
[3:40:57.760 --> 3:41:02.960]  the lemmings out there have to start voting for the independence look at we
[3:41:02.960 --> 3:41:08.000]  tried our asses off to get Dean Barkley elected he did very very well he got
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:13.600]  over 400,000 votes but we have to continue from there and keep the only
[3:41:13.600 --> 3:41:19.680]  way is to win elections the only way is to not vote for Democrats and
[3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:25.040]  Republicans and stop being lemmings and believing it's your only choice
[3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:30.000]  absolutely it's like a Don King and it be done I don't know it well it's like a
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:34.400]  Don King boxing match I mean you know both fighters are owned by him so what's
[3:41:34.400 --> 3:41:38.560]  the point of watching it you know it's a no it's a rig deal speaking of a Dick
[3:41:38.560 --> 3:41:43.440]  Cheney Alex come on so is wrestling and that's entertaining as hell hey speaking
[3:41:43.440 --> 3:41:48.160]  of that you went to UFC and saw one of those events didn't you do you still
[3:41:48.160 --> 3:41:55.440]  think it might be fake oh the ultimate fighting yeah um let me put it to you
[3:41:55.440 --> 3:42:03.120]  this way Brock Lesnar who's the champ now right yes Brock Lesnar told me that
[3:42:03.120 --> 3:42:12.440]  pro wrestling is tougher really yeah that kind of stuns you doesn't it but
[3:42:12.440 --> 3:42:17.440]  you know why he says it here's why Brock told me pro wrestling is harder because
[3:42:17.440 --> 3:42:23.760]  in ultimate fighting he only has to go in there for 15 minutes a hell then he
[3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:28.800]  takes two month two to three months rest he trains for two months and he goes
[3:42:28.800 --> 3:42:34.420]  back in for 15 minutes a hell while in pro wrestling you got a trip you got a
[3:42:34.420 --> 3:42:38.320]  wrestle every night you got to do interviews you got to travel all over
[3:42:38.320 --> 3:42:43.000]  the country from one end to the other it's the most exhausting business can
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:50.160]  possibly be in so that's why do I think they're really fighting yes I do have you
[3:42:50.160 --> 3:42:54.120]  seen the movie the wrestler the point is it's only for 15 minutes and then they
[3:42:54.120 --> 3:42:58.640]  get a six month rest sure have you seen the movie the wrestler no I have not I
[3:42:58.640 --> 3:43:03.760]  just got back to Mexico I want to get your get your take on that I can tell
[3:43:03.760 --> 3:43:09.200]  you this I think that rather than what Hulk Hogan says it's about him no it's
[3:43:09.200 --> 3:43:14.040]  not I but for what I know about the film I believe it's about Jake the Snake
[3:43:14.040 --> 3:43:18.800]  Roberts much more because if you go to a movie that was a documentary called
[3:43:18.800 --> 3:43:23.800]  Beyond the Map that was done by a friend of mine Barry Bloustate if you go watch
[3:43:23.800 --> 3:43:29.240]  that movie you'll see that this character very much parallels the Mickey
[3:43:29.240 --> 3:43:33.560]  Rourke character in the fact that he went through ups and downs he achieved
[3:43:33.560 --> 3:43:37.640]  the greatest in his career he ended up down on the bottom again and he had a
[3:43:37.640 --> 3:43:43.000]  great deal of battle with a lot of demons including a daughter who are in and in
[3:43:43.000 --> 3:43:47.520]  the documentary it shows Jake's rough relationship with his daughter which
[3:43:47.520 --> 3:43:50.840]  very much parallels the Rourke character in the movie the wrestler well
[3:43:50.840 --> 3:43:55.440]  obviously it's not about Hulk Hogan it's about a guy who's you know living in a
[3:43:55.440 --> 3:43:59.800]  trailer shack and is totally broken has a heart attack I mean Hogan is
[3:43:59.800 --> 3:44:03.200]  something else I guess complete egomaniac oh yeah I mean Hogan's out
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:10.120]  there saying just because the guy says brother it's about me I don't think so
[3:44:10.120 --> 3:44:13.760]  hey by the way I love what you revealed about Hogan on Stern the other day I
[3:44:13.760 --> 3:44:19.920]  happen to hear that don't do it here this is a conservative show but it was
[3:44:19.920 --> 3:44:25.640]  hilarious oh my goodness okay okay the time we got we're gonna get serious forget
[3:44:25.640 --> 3:44:32.480]  something we Navy SEALs don't get mad we get even well what I've got you for a
[3:44:32.480 --> 3:44:35.240]  full hour to take calls come up about eight nine days we appreciate that time
[3:44:35.240 --> 3:44:38.380]  will I will I get more into all that other stuff and all the serious
[3:44:38.380 --> 3:44:41.880]  issues but tell us about the paperback of don't start the revolution without me
[3:44:41.880 --> 3:44:47.720]  well you know I added we because the the epilogue was now outdated I don't know
[3:44:47.720 --> 3:44:51.560]  if they removed it but I added a couple new chapters and that we updated it
[3:44:51.560 --> 3:44:56.440]  which is what they always do and when a hardcover goes to paperback but you know
[3:44:56.440 --> 3:45:01.040]  I updated a few a new chapter in it all that stuff but again it's a wake-up call
[3:45:01.040 --> 3:45:06.960]  I hope I hope this country will wake up to the fact that you know dissension is
[3:45:06.960 --> 3:45:10.920]  the greatest form of patriotism and the fact that if you don't hold your
[3:45:10.920 --> 3:45:14.400]  government officials feet to the fire you're gonna get bad government that
[3:45:14.400 --> 3:45:19.200]  that's good that that's not on patriotic and now we we better start taking our
[3:45:19.200 --> 3:45:25.120]  country back or we're gonna lose it because Alex you know that to me if
[3:45:25.120 --> 3:45:29.480]  we're torturing people now that means the terrorists are winning because
[3:45:29.480 --> 3:45:34.960]  they're changing America and that's what they've set out to do do we really want
[3:45:34.960 --> 3:45:41.600]  them to win I don't well Jesse I mean governor you're a smart guy and we've
[3:45:41.600 --> 3:45:44.440]  had a lot of talks and I know you're getting deeper into the whole under
[3:45:44.440 --> 3:45:47.320]  world of the New World Order and all this doing a lot more research on it and
[3:45:47.320 --> 3:45:51.080]  working on a lot of projects a book and a TV show and the rest of it I don't know
[3:45:51.080 --> 3:45:54.140]  how much that we can get into but you know some of that's got you know gag
[3:45:54.140 --> 3:45:59.760]  order on it because it's you know being produced right now but we talk about the
[3:45:59.760 --> 3:46:03.560]  buildings clearly being blown up and then the question is who could put them in
[3:46:03.560 --> 3:46:06.560]  there who could do it I know you've been in Mexico but now they've had top
[3:46:06.560 --> 3:46:10.960]  scientists to peer-reviewed journals top Dutch physicists have come out
[3:46:10.960 --> 3:46:16.360]  international news BBC national TV in Europe confirming they actually got the
[3:46:16.360 --> 3:46:19.800]  thermate samples from the buildings they were blown up with explosive
[3:46:19.800 --> 3:46:24.000]  thermate then you have the folks at NIST that are covering all this up to still
[3:46:24.000 --> 3:46:29.320]  happen to be three of the top seven or so experts in explosive thermite
[3:46:29.320 --> 3:46:35.080]  thermate in the world so come on this whole terrorist thing it's a fraud they've
[3:46:35.080 --> 3:46:38.920]  used this to take our liberties to take our freedoms and the same elite that was
[3:46:38.920 --> 3:46:42.400]  in control when Bush was in control is in control with Obama aren't you worried
[3:46:42.400 --> 3:46:45.520]  that they're talking about going into Iran now and aren't you worried the same
[3:46:45.520 --> 3:46:48.960]  global elite might stage more terror attacks or do you think that was just
[3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:54.920]  Bush well I don't know you know we we I guess I hate to say it but until they do
[3:46:54.920 --> 3:46:59.840]  something we won't know will we Alex you know until the because we're not on the
[3:46:59.840 --> 3:47:03.520]  inner circle we were not sitting in on the meetings where the decisions are
[3:47:03.520 --> 3:47:10.200]  made so I can only respond as it happens and Bob young are you know I know I
[3:47:10.200 --> 3:47:15.000]  guess the Iranians blew off a missile you know that they showed me film I guess
[3:47:15.000 --> 3:47:19.320]  of some missile going up in the air do I really know they did it I don't know I
[3:47:19.320 --> 3:47:24.160]  you know you get to the point especially with our news media today that you don't
[3:47:24.160 --> 3:47:27.720]  know what to believe and what not to believe yeah you were telling me a
[3:47:27.720 --> 3:47:32.160]  showy initially you come out and they make you believe something and then four
[3:47:32.160 --> 3:47:35.640]  to six months later you learn other things that make you disbelieve what
[3:47:35.640 --> 3:47:39.840]  they were told you so when they tell me something today I don't know whether to
[3:47:39.840 --> 3:47:46.200]  believe it or not absolutely Jesse let me bring this question up to you then
[3:47:46.200 --> 3:47:52.200]  on 888 I get up CNN says Russia has snuck attack Georgia then I get to the
[3:47:52.200 --> 3:47:56.200]  office and I'm watching foreign TV and even reading you know down deep in the
[3:47:56.200 --> 3:48:00.160]  Associated Press that Georgia snuck attack South Ossetia and then two days
[3:48:00.160 --> 3:48:04.240]  later they admitted okay it was all a PR stunt NATO and US troops were there
[3:48:04.240 --> 3:48:08.480]  advising the sneak attack on the Russians I mean that's how much our media
[3:48:08.480 --> 3:48:12.200]  and government will lie is that they will launch sneak attacks on Russian
[3:48:12.200 --> 3:48:16.520]  territories does that sound like a good idea to you Jesse no not at all you know
[3:48:16.520 --> 3:48:21.840]  that that sounds to me like the you know if I can go back in history it is
[3:48:21.840 --> 3:48:24.960]  Howard Hunt still alive
[3:48:26.320 --> 3:48:32.760]  and so Alex no I mean that sounds like the stuff they were doing to Cuba back
[3:48:32.760 --> 3:48:36.280]  down there in the air you know the days of the Bay of Pigs and all that stuff
[3:48:36.280 --> 3:48:41.240]  when when when our CIA was down there trying to overthrow Castro secretly and
[3:48:41.240 --> 3:48:45.840]  making attempts and blowing up ships in the harbor and doing all that sort of
[3:48:45.840 --> 3:48:49.960]  behavior it reminds me the stuff that went on in Central America during the
[3:48:49.960 --> 3:48:56.240]  whole Iran contra stink what we need to what this country's got to do is pick
[3:48:56.240 --> 3:49:01.360]  get its head out of it you know what start realizing that there's a reason
[3:49:01.360 --> 3:49:05.680]  that these people don't like us out there in the world and a lot of it's got
[3:49:05.680 --> 3:49:11.240]  to do with our behavior I agree and it this corrupt offshore elites that are
[3:49:11.240 --> 3:49:15.200]  using the United States as their tool or their frontman their their their strong
[3:49:15.200 --> 3:49:19.120]  man their engine to carry this out can you talk about what you what we discuss
[3:49:19.120 --> 3:49:23.000]  this morning in that conversation about how you're discovering more and more
[3:49:23.000 --> 3:49:27.360]  stuff you're writing a book about conspiracies the point about Lincoln or
[3:49:27.360 --> 3:49:31.120]  do you want to just not get into that oh no that's fine I'll I well the story I
[3:49:31.120 --> 3:49:35.240]  can tell you is this you know Dick Russell my co-writer he brought this to my
[3:49:35.240 --> 3:49:40.280]  attention he sat me down and we were down together in the Bahaan and he just
[3:49:40.280 --> 3:49:43.360]  looked at me and he said governor he said what do you know about the murder of
[3:49:43.360 --> 3:49:48.080]  Abraham Lincoln what were you taught in school and I said well what I recall that
[3:49:48.080 --> 3:49:52.080]  I was taught in school is that Abraham and his wife went to the movie theater
[3:49:52.080 --> 3:49:56.560]  the Ford theater and that John Wilkes Booth snuck up behind him shot him in
[3:49:56.560 --> 3:50:00.560]  the head tried to jump from the balcony hooked his leg on something or other
[3:50:00.560 --> 3:50:04.960]  broke his leg they trailed him to a cabin and killed him burnt him or
[3:50:04.960 --> 3:50:10.200]  whatever I said that's what I was taught and Dick said to me so they never
[3:50:10.200 --> 3:50:14.680]  taught you that there were actually seven people arrested tried and convicted
[3:50:14.680 --> 3:50:20.960]  for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the attempt on Ulysses S. Grant and
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:25.040]  vice president Johnson I said I never heard a word about that till you told
[3:50:25.040 --> 3:50:31.720]  me that right now and so what causes me concern is that I don't know why aren't
[3:50:31.720 --> 3:50:36.040]  we why don't we put that in our school books about what really happened it that
[3:50:36.040 --> 3:50:39.880]  though that there was this literal attempt from the Confederacy to
[3:50:39.880 --> 3:50:45.200]  assassinate three of the top union leaders the president the vice
[3:50:45.200 --> 3:50:49.480]  president general grant now the issue is why isn't this put in school books
[3:50:49.480 --> 3:50:54.360]  regardless of what side of this year on why don't they write the truth about
[3:50:54.360 --> 3:50:59.880]  history and it scares me to death to think okay what can you believe in our
[3:50:59.880 --> 3:51:04.120]  history books that our children are reading today you know are they going
[3:51:04.120 --> 3:51:08.880]  to continue to tell us that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Jack Kennedy when there's
[3:51:08.880 --> 3:51:14.120]  enough evidence out that it indicates if he if he did take part in it he
[3:51:14.120 --> 3:51:18.440]  certainly didn't do it alone well governor here's another one it is main
[3:51:18.440 --> 3:51:23.400]  line history even in Shire's rise and fall of third right Pulitzer prize
[3:51:23.400 --> 3:51:27.240]  winning it's in all the major main line history books but it's never on
[3:51:27.240 --> 3:51:30.840]  discovery channel history channel the news did you know that the British and
[3:51:30.840 --> 3:51:34.920]  US governments actually funded Hitler that the Edward the 8th the king was a
[3:51:34.920 --> 3:51:39.800]  Nazi had to escape Germany when the war started and that the West basically
[3:51:39.800 --> 3:51:43.280]  told Hitler to go ahead and do what he did that they were going to back him and
[3:51:43.280 --> 3:51:47.600]  they turned against him I mean Hitler still evil the point is is that if that's
[3:51:47.600 --> 3:51:50.280]  why they let the British escape at Dunkirk and all that that's why the
[3:51:50.280 --> 3:51:54.840]  right Fuhrer came in and parachuted into England with a peace treaty saying I
[3:51:54.840 --> 3:51:59.480]  have the peace treaty well you know why are you doing this we had a deal Alex I
[3:51:59.480 --> 3:52:02.880]  have to tell you I don't know of any of that I have to claim ignorance I've
[3:52:02.880 --> 3:52:08.080]  never studied it I probably should but you know there's only so many hours in
[3:52:08.080 --> 3:52:11.720]  the day and no exactly I'm saying you're a prominent guy get your rider look into
[3:52:11.720 --> 3:52:16.640]  that because that's something that is main line Pulitzer prize it's just it's
[3:52:16.640 --> 3:52:20.120]  just in there though like it's no big deal it's kind of like an elephant in
[3:52:20.120 --> 3:52:23.640]  the living room and nobody's nobody's even pointing it out yeah you can't see
[3:52:23.640 --> 3:52:28.520]  the forest for the trees absolutely I did you know no interesting stuff no
[3:52:28.520 --> 3:52:32.160]  the book we're gonna write those gonna deal with multiple conspiracies down
[3:52:32.160 --> 3:52:36.280]  through the years and you know and and cover them and just uh you know
[3:52:36.280 --> 3:52:40.560]  hopefully make people think a little bit and realize because I still sit back
[3:52:40.560 --> 3:52:45.280]  and say you're telling me all the assassinations of the 60s were all done
[3:52:45.280 --> 3:52:51.160]  by low nuts you know that I live through that and I just can't believe that there
[3:52:51.160 --> 3:52:56.120]  wasn't one more person involved than who they told us well it's now come out that
[3:52:56.120 --> 3:52:59.560]  Patty Hurst and the weatherman that that was all stage that's mainstream
[3:52:59.560 --> 3:53:03.200]  declassified and every time I hear about mad bombers they're about to blow
[3:53:03.200 --> 3:53:06.920]  something up I was in the shower this morning with the radio on listening to
[3:53:06.920 --> 3:53:10.280]  NPR and they admitted this latest group of idiots they found in New York they
[3:53:10.280 --> 3:53:14.200]  admit oh by the way the informants set up the group were leading it and gave
[3:53:14.200 --> 3:53:21.400]  them the explosives well again Alex you know more than I do on that stuff I
[3:53:21.400 --> 3:53:25.800]  can't comment on it because I have no idea well you're a very smart guy and
[3:53:25.800 --> 3:53:28.440]  you got a lot of courage Jesse and you've certainly been learning a lot of
[3:53:28.440 --> 3:53:31.160]  stuff I didn't know about and you've you've taught me quite a bit about
[3:53:31.160 --> 3:53:34.720]  things that have happened so remember Alex I think you're here all the time
[3:53:34.720 --> 3:53:40.000]  now I take a leave of absence for six months well I think that's good I think
[3:53:40.000 --> 3:53:43.600]  you deserve it after all you've done of speaking of that they keep asking you
[3:53:43.600 --> 3:53:46.200]  are you going to run for the Senate are you going to run for governor are you
[3:53:46.200 --> 3:53:50.720]  ever going to run for office again at this time no I don't but I never say
[3:53:50.720 --> 3:53:55.280]  never because you know I can't predict the future I can't predict if something
[3:53:55.280 --> 3:54:00.640]  would happen that would inspire me to do it again but right now I don't have the
[3:54:00.640 --> 3:54:05.280]  fire in my belly to go for like if the Senate race you know it really came down
[3:54:05.280 --> 3:54:09.640]  to flipping the coin I let destiny determine it but the other main reason
[3:54:09.640 --> 3:54:15.360]  was I thought about you know at my age now that six years of my life that I
[3:54:15.360 --> 3:54:21.800]  got to go hang out with people I don't even like yeah they are difficult to do
[3:54:21.800 --> 3:54:26.400]  you know at this point in my life I know I've only got so many more years on the
[3:54:26.400 --> 3:54:31.880]  planet you know I'm closing in on 60 years old and I want to enjoy myself and
[3:54:31.880 --> 3:54:36.120]  to go out there and hang around with them people for six years that would be
[3:54:36.120 --> 3:54:40.240]  like you know why don't I just go put myself in prison well Governor Ventura I
[3:54:40.240 --> 3:54:45.480]  understand and that's the problem evil people will scrabble and claw to get
[3:54:45.480 --> 3:54:49.920]  power will gnaw through steel to get it and then good guys like you they don't
[3:54:49.920 --> 3:54:53.480]  want power so they don't you know they do something to fight the evil but then
[3:54:53.480 --> 3:54:57.840]  you know at a certain point it's so disgusted you know by the elitist that
[3:54:57.840 --> 3:55:00.720]  they don't even want to get involved with them and I don't blame you if I get
[3:55:00.720 --> 3:55:06.280]  that disgusted you know I'll be back absolutely so that's a little hint that
[3:55:06.280 --> 3:55:09.880]  you're gonna be back in the future well we'll talk a lot coming up on June 1st
[3:55:09.880 --> 3:55:12.800]  I still need to get with you and find out exactly what hour of the show you
[3:55:12.800 --> 3:55:18.000]  want to come on then but Governor Ventura the book is out in paperback in
[3:55:18.000 --> 3:55:21.720]  closing you talk about on TV waterboarding Dick Cheney I mean if
[3:55:21.720 --> 3:55:25.840]  this guy says it's so great it's so wonderful they admit 90 plus percent of
[3:55:25.840 --> 3:55:29.600]  the people at Guantanamo Bay totally innocent just picked up by bounty
[3:55:29.600 --> 3:55:35.320]  hunters they get $25,000 a piece most of them 14 15 years old the intelligence
[3:55:35.320 --> 3:55:41.040]  they used to scare everybody came from torture I mean I think if Cheney says
[3:55:41.040 --> 3:55:44.960]  waterboarding is no big deal I mean I mean maybe he should show us that it's
[3:55:44.960 --> 3:55:49.880]  no big deal can you comment on that well first of all I made the quote I think I
[3:55:49.880 --> 3:55:54.760]  said it on the view that if you are or no I said that I'm Larry King that if you
[3:55:54.760 --> 3:55:59.640]  gave me a waterboard Dick Cheney and one hour I'd have him confessing to the Tate murders
[3:55:59.640 --> 3:56:05.440]  well I have to amend that though Alex I don't think I could accomplish that you
[3:56:05.440 --> 3:56:10.600]  know why what his heart ain't good enough you wouldn't be alive for an hour to
[3:56:10.600 --> 3:56:17.440]  even confess exactly exactly how bad waterboarding is because I do not
[3:56:17.440 --> 3:56:22.000]  believe Dick Cheney physically could take it you know with with the heart that
[3:56:22.000 --> 3:56:27.080]  he has well what about the stuff for him to advocate doing this to people and for
[3:56:27.080 --> 3:56:33.120]  calling it another name called enhanced interrogation well that's baloney
[3:56:33.120 --> 3:56:38.320]  because uh well torture is torture and they're like jury-picking they go well
[3:56:38.320 --> 3:56:42.440]  you can't torture a person from the United States but if the person comes
[3:56:42.440 --> 3:56:47.280]  from somewhere else in the world tortures okay that was my last question
[3:56:47.280 --> 3:56:51.000]  what about what about the Department of Homeland Security documents that came
[3:56:51.000 --> 3:56:55.120]  out listing conservatives gun owners returning veterans as the number one
[3:56:55.120 --> 3:56:58.560]  terror threat and that Homeland Security set up for them and then it made the
[3:56:58.560 --> 3:57:01.880]  news you know we broke that that when we were out having an in the Fed rally with
[3:57:01.880 --> 3:57:06.840]  Ron Paul the army was spying on us in Texas well that's because you're in
[3:57:06.840 --> 3:57:12.360]  Texas you can't do nothing in Texas no but what do you think of that DHS report
[3:57:12.360 --> 3:57:17.240]  you know trying to list the American people as the terrorist well again you
[3:57:17.240 --> 3:57:22.320]  know I don't know I Alex that's only stuff you know I can only speak to stuff
[3:57:22.320 --> 3:57:26.240]  that and it's not that I don't believe you but I can only speak to stuff that I
[3:57:26.240 --> 3:57:29.600]  actually know about and I'll say there you know you have been down in Mexico
[3:57:29.600 --> 3:57:34.360]  yeah I'm going for not vigilant if we're not vigilant we're gonna lose our
[3:57:34.360 --> 3:57:39.560]  freedoms because it's a natural progression it's a natural it's it's if
[3:57:39.560 --> 3:57:43.600]  you look down to the annals of history you will always see it happen and unless
[3:57:43.600 --> 3:57:49.920]  the citizenry takes control in fact let me say this Alex now finish like this
[3:57:49.920 --> 3:57:56.080]  they won't release the photos of our torture right yes well then how about
[3:57:56.080 --> 3:58:01.080]  if I step forward on behalf of the taxpayers and the citizens of the
[3:58:01.080 --> 3:58:05.880]  great United States of America mm-hmm and I want to go public with this now
[3:58:05.880 --> 3:58:13.320]  let you break it I will represent us let me go where these photos are let me go
[3:58:13.320 --> 3:58:19.360]  inside and see them and let me come out and report back as to what these photos
[3:58:19.360 --> 3:58:24.200]  are I think I have the right to do that I think they have no right to keep me from
[3:58:24.200 --> 3:58:30.360]  that you know why I pay their salary and I'm a governor I'm a mayor I'm a former
[3:58:30.360 --> 3:58:35.560]  Navy SEAL I had a top-secret security clearance I think I'm fully qualified to
[3:58:35.560 --> 3:58:40.560]  walk in and view these photos on Jesse so we can finish I'm gonna go one minute
[3:58:40.560 --> 3:58:43.560]  I'm gonna go one minute over right now we're gonna keep on the web
[3:58:43.560 --> 3:58:47.640]  transmitting an info wars calm for one minute we're gonna cut that feed John do
[3:58:47.640 --> 3:58:52.080]  I have Jesse there yeah yeah governor we had to end the main thing on the end
[3:58:52.080 --> 3:58:55.400]  of it but we still got tens of thousands on the internet listing and then I'm
[3:58:55.400 --> 3:58:58.680]  gonna cut that transmission in a moment and say bye to you off air because I
[3:58:58.680 --> 3:59:02.220]  want to know where to send something that you were asking for but finish your
[3:59:02.220 --> 3:59:05.680]  statement we're still on the internet still a prison planet dot TV statement
[3:59:05.680 --> 3:59:10.360]  was again I will go on behalf of the American people and let me go view these
[3:59:10.360 --> 3:59:15.880]  pictures they won't let us see on torture yeah you're a governor that and
[3:59:15.880 --> 3:59:20.040]  also a populous figure is very popular in the polls that's a good idea we go in
[3:59:20.040 --> 3:59:24.040]  and look at them and I'll come out now report to the public whether you know
[3:59:24.040 --> 3:59:28.720]  what it will what it is the why we don't need it why we shouldn't be able to see
[3:59:28.720 --> 3:59:33.560]  them because I understand it could infuriate the enemy but I'm not the
[3:59:33.560 --> 3:59:38.360]  enemy well therefore I think I have every right to see these photos in
[3:59:38.360 --> 3:59:41.800]  private well governor let me just tell you in closing what what is in them
[3:59:41.800 --> 3:59:44.880]  because these photos were seen as you know by Congress and members of the
[3:59:44.880 --> 3:59:49.880]  Senate it is children being raped videos it is photos of children being raped
[3:59:49.880 --> 3:59:53.560]  in front of their parents and Obama was gonna release some whitewashed ones and
[3:59:53.560 --> 3:59:57.280]  then it was decided those were too hardcore but Cy Hirsch you can just
[3:59:57.280 --> 4:00:04.880]  Google Cy Hirsch New Yorker raping boys and or or or interrogations raping
[4:00:04.880 --> 4:00:09.280]  children and it is confirmed the general to goomba the american general
[4:00:09.280 --> 4:00:14.920]  he's Filipino he did the army report three-star general where they said all
[4:00:14.920 --> 4:00:18.080]  that was done so we have an army report about those but yeah that would be
[4:00:18.080 --> 4:00:21.320]  important to to send you in there but but that was the question I was gonna
[4:00:21.320 --> 4:00:24.840]  ask that's how bad these crimes get as I told you six months ago when you're
[4:00:24.840 --> 4:00:28.360]  here in Austin what should be done I mean is it I mean is that a pretty bad
[4:00:28.360 --> 4:00:31.840]  crime raping kids in front of their parents yeah I would think so I you know
[4:00:31.840 --> 4:00:37.040]  to me all tortures a bad crime but again I I'll reserve comment until I'm
[4:00:37.040 --> 4:00:42.640]  allowed to see the photos let me go see what they won't allow us to see and I'll
[4:00:42.640 --> 4:00:48.760]  be happy to come out and and give you my opinion on on what I saw okay
[4:00:48.760 --> 4:00:53.960]  governor line is this if we haven't done torture in the first place Alex there
[4:00:53.960 --> 4:00:58.120]  wouldn't be any photos would there absolutely and they wouldn't be having
[4:00:58.120 --> 4:01:02.760]  to defend torture and say it's okay and exactly and that's the bottom line if
[4:01:02.760 --> 4:01:07.000]  all like when they're attacking Pelosi that's just a red herring because the
[4:01:07.000 --> 4:01:11.760]  bottom line whether she knew or didn't know is if the torture had to take in
[4:01:11.760 --> 4:01:16.120]  place in the first place it would be irrelevant absolutely governor listen I
[4:01:16.120 --> 4:01:20.560]  need to talk to you off air so let's end the transmission right now a lot
[4:01:20.560 --> 4:01:24.840]  radio show and then I will say bye to governor Ventura I just want to know
[4:01:24.840 --> 4:01:27.720]  where to send you this atmospheric water generator she was saying you want to
[4:01:27.720 --> 4:01:32.080]  know where to get one will we'll just mail you one so you know what let me do
[4:01:32.080 --> 4:01:34.800]  this governor so I'll make sure we're not on air let me just call you back on
[4:01:34.800 --> 4:01:39.480]  this line right now okay okay I'll call you in 60 seconds all right there goes

[4:01:51.960 --> 4:01:55.320]  and stuff now to fully educate him about the torture so when he goes on
[4:01:55.320 --> 4:01:59.440]  national TV he'll talk about what they're doing to kids it's all admitted
[4:01:59.440 --> 4:02:03.080]  it's just the public doesn't know all right that's it for this transmission
[4:02:03.080 --> 4:02:07.400]  great job crew great job Genesis great job affiliates take care of the info
[4:02:07.400 --> 4:02:27.200]  war continues right now
