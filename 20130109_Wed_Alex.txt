[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.480 --> 00:20.120]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:20.120 --> 00:37.160]  Alex Jones
[00:37.160 --> 00:47.120]  ladies and gentlemen it is Wednesday the ninth day of January 2013 and if you go
[00:47.120 --> 00:57.520]  up to infowars.com we have on the site the video of Piers Morgan last night
[00:57.520 --> 01:02.880]  where he said he'd like to have me back on again which I'm ready to do via
[01:02.880 --> 01:10.160]  satellite whenever he wants and they went on to talk about they hope my kids
[01:10.160 --> 01:13.820]  don't get killed while my children were in the room and I thought that was
[01:13.820 --> 01:19.700]  cryptic and then the next guest comes on three of them and says that Piers Morgan
[01:19.700 --> 01:24.400]  needs to shoot me with a semi-auto and then the daughter of governor Huntsman
[01:24.400 --> 01:29.160]  ambassador Huntsman says that she'd like to see him dressed up in a uniform
[01:29.160 --> 01:34.640]  because it's okay he see that he has the authority it was all scripted and then
[01:34.640 --> 01:38.160]  Piers Morgan says maybe I'll wear my brother's uniform he always talks about
[01:38.160 --> 01:42.680]  how his brother is in the military and then he tells the Marine who's on it was
[01:42.680 --> 01:46.440]  excellent by the way that bottom dollar that guy's a listener I want to get him
[01:46.440 --> 01:50.600]  on if one to get him on since last week he was listening and the Marines you
[01:50.600 --> 01:53.080]  know explains that we have guns protect ourselves from government not about
[01:53.080 --> 01:57.400]  hunting and Piers is like well you've done a great job in all your combat you
[01:57.400 --> 02:03.560]  can have guns but but the citizens can't so I'm ready to debate you Piers Morgan
[02:03.560 --> 02:08.600]  in fact if you wanted to have a moderator with a time clock and then say
[02:08.600 --> 02:14.760]  I could present my questions you could present your questions they could
[02:14.760 --> 02:19.280]  present their questions that way obviously you could still rig it with
[02:19.280 --> 02:22.720]  you can even have your own moderator as long as it's I have the same amount of
[02:22.720 --> 02:26.500]  time you could have even you know rig it where people send in the tweets that you
[02:26.500 --> 02:30.480]  choose from I just want to be able to ask my five questions and we have an
[02:30.480 --> 02:34.020]  hour-long debate and instead of having a half million viewers I think you're
[02:34.020 --> 02:38.400]  noticing this now you'd have about five million ten million maybe like CNN you
[02:38.400 --> 02:43.600]  used to have I mean folks know we don't want to be lectured all day and hear the
[02:43.600 --> 02:52.360]  Second Amendment demonized over and over and over again at nauseum I mean people
[02:52.360 --> 02:57.120]  know and they know that statistically mass shootings are as rare as the tooth
[02:57.120 --> 03:00.600]  fairy they know you're pulling on heartstrings that's why they've tuned
[03:00.600 --> 03:05.400]  out and you know that and by the way when I was talking to their producers
[03:05.400 --> 03:11.920]  off-air before I got on they went and looked up the radio stations were on
[03:11.920 --> 03:15.280]  they went and got the numbers they have numbers they know how to get unlisted
[03:15.280 --> 03:19.440]  numbers of people that even have somebody else get on the phone I mean
[03:19.440 --> 03:23.420]  it's definitely government type stuff and they knew they said oh no we know
[03:23.420 --> 03:26.880]  you have three million listeners a day we know you have 15 million a week we
[03:26.880 --> 03:30.840]  know and pierce morgan on airs like you have an incredible reach you shouldn't
[03:30.840 --> 03:36.840]  have it and guess who else said that Glenn Beck I saw 15 minutes last night
[03:36.840 --> 03:42.320]  on YouTube of him yesterday starting a show that made me really ashamed for him
[03:42.320 --> 03:45.160]  and we're gonna have jakari Jackson in here later to play some of the clips I
[03:45.160 --> 03:49.080]  mean went on for hours but it's it's 15 minutes long we'll play a few clips of
[03:49.080 --> 03:56.120]  it he said I'm a liar he said I am spooky these are quotes I'm dangerous
[03:56.120 --> 04:02.840]  I'm a fascist and that and and then I'm a liar
[04:02.840 --> 04:08.880]  I'm a call me a fat idiot yeah and and you know a bunch of other stuff and he
[04:08.880 --> 04:15.560]  also well his minion called me a fat idiot and he also said that people come
[04:15.560 --> 04:20.360]  up to him saying they bought 1.6 billion bullets and he said this guy is lying to
[04:20.360 --> 04:24.080]  you don't believe him and that's why I don't like Glenn Beck and folks you know
[04:24.080 --> 04:28.400]  I don't attack Michael Savage Rush Limbaugh any of them okay I mean I don't
[04:28.400 --> 04:31.560]  want Rush Limbaugh to have a heart attack and die so that I get his radio
[04:31.560 --> 04:35.800]  stations literally I'm not that kind of guy so I'm not like mad at Glenn Beck
[04:35.800 --> 04:40.400]  because you know he's made hundreds of millions of dollars I'm mad at him
[04:40.400 --> 04:47.440]  because he's always been there behind the scenes trying to keep me down and he
[04:47.440 --> 04:51.880]  lies to his audience and then tells them I'm a liar I mean if anybody is a
[04:51.880 --> 04:56.400]  manipulating sack of garbage it's it's it's Glenn Beck I mean you're the liar
[04:56.400 --> 04:59.240]  you little nanny
[05:00.160 --> 05:05.400]  looking back on 2012 we asked ourselves how did we ever survive from natural

[08:23.920 --> 08:29.240]  all right ladies and gentlemen the biggest story in the country right now
[08:29.240 --> 08:35.000]  is my appearance Monday night on piers Morgan last night the Daily Show
[08:35.000 --> 08:43.240]  responded Conan O'Brien responded they did stuff like superimpose a gun in my
[08:43.240 --> 08:48.600]  hand shooting piers Morgan with the real video from the show it's like something
[08:48.600 --> 08:52.000]  out of the running man there's the proof that mad dog Ben Richards is really the
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.560]  brooder the brutal butcher of Bakersfield I mean they could put my
[08:57.560 --> 09:03.520]  head on Obama's and you know have me walking around saying whatever they want
[09:03.520 --> 09:07.240]  or putting whatever they want in my hands and and obviously it's comedy but
[09:07.240 --> 09:11.920]  it still puts out the archetypal image that we as gun owners are violent and
[09:11.920 --> 09:19.000]  bad meanwhile ladies and gentlemen the founder of SPS Russian the biggest gun
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.080]  show in the world not just on YouTube about a hundred million viewers on
[09:24.080 --> 09:30.560]  average a month just on YouTube biggest gun show in the world was tied up at his
[09:30.560 --> 09:36.080]  offices he's a gun manufacturer and shot in the back of the head execution style
[09:36.080 --> 09:42.440]  the biggest gun show in the world the founder dead and it's in the back of the
[09:42.440 --> 09:46.080]  local Georgia papers that it's a state police murder investigation he was
[09:46.080 --> 09:52.480]  executed assassin mafia style tied up in a chair expertly shot in the back of the
[09:52.480 --> 10:00.680]  head execution style we have also discovered in military times that other
[10:00.680 --> 10:05.760]  gun manufacturers and people are dying mysteriously now you remember the head
[10:05.760 --> 10:08.480]  of the Northeast Intelligence Network who I want to work on getting on
[10:08.480 --> 10:12.960]  tomorrow Doug Hagman maybe even pop in the day of
[10:12.960 --> 10:17.520]  eating do it he said two weeks ago on this show but I want to go back and find
[10:17.520 --> 10:20.880]  the clip it's one thing me to say oh he was on the show and said this and new
[10:20.880 --> 10:23.880]  listeners like yeah I bet we have to like it's why we gotta hire some more
[10:23.880 --> 10:27.560]  crew because you guys are working really hard but I need staff to go back and go
[10:27.560 --> 10:31.720]  okay that was the not the last interview with the interview before last it was
[10:31.720 --> 10:36.800]  like two weeks ago we've got to go into that interview and he says my federal
[10:36.800 --> 10:41.560]  source he's got a lot of those sources says there's going to be a purge he goes
[10:41.560 --> 10:47.960]  assassinations of pro gun leaders and it'll look like you get mugged or crack
[10:47.960 --> 10:51.920]  dealers go after you and that's why whenever I was being stalked in New York
[10:51.920 --> 10:57.080]  by what looked like police and normally again you're going to CNN you're walking
[10:57.080 --> 11:00.440]  ten blocks because they wanted to have a car deliver us I said no I'll walk I
[11:00.440 --> 11:05.120]  wanted some exercise I want to wake back up as I've been up since 5 a.m. and you
[11:05.120 --> 11:09.400]  know one guy pops out looks like a cop on a street you're walking up ten blocks
[11:09.400 --> 11:14.240]  taking turns it goes hey Alex Jones I'm a big fan and you think okay that guy's a
[11:14.240 --> 11:17.160]  listener but then it happens with another guy then you see other guys with
[11:17.160 --> 11:21.480]  the with the windbreakers and the obvious cop type I mean once you've been
[11:21.480 --> 11:24.000]  around this a hundred times you know what it looks like not and I've been
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.160]  around Bloomberg a few times where he has like 15 detectives around him that's
[11:27.160 --> 11:30.760]  just security that's exactly how they act the whole confident thing where they
[11:30.760 --> 11:35.640]  act like gangsters basically these type of detectives
[11:37.320 --> 11:42.920]  I've been around quite a few of them in in Los Angeles too but they're more like
[11:42.920 --> 11:47.520]  assassin types look like more like old special forces types in Los Angeles but
[11:47.520 --> 11:53.280]  the point is is that basically I describe them as people out of central
[11:53.280 --> 11:59.360]  casting from The Sopranos same look same confident face same deal like you know
[11:59.360 --> 12:04.000]  I've done a lot of bad things to people and you know enough to where it wasn't
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.080]  that I was scared at a physical level it was in my gut I said you need to live to
[12:09.080 --> 12:12.960]  fight another day something's bad here are they gonna drop something on you
[12:12.960 --> 12:15.160]  what's gonna happen and it kept happening and then they were in the
[12:15.160 --> 12:19.040]  hotel we left that night that's why I didn't basically sleep took us a long
[12:19.040 --> 12:23.520]  time to get to New Jersey I mean I left you know you're in hotels paying cash
[12:23.520 --> 12:28.440]  just because when you've got I know let's not exaggerate seven detectives
[12:28.440 --> 12:32.080]  following you and looking at you like they want to
[12:32.080 --> 12:36.920]  kill you it's a serious situation and I didn't know that the day before that
[12:36.920 --> 12:42.800]  SPS Russian founder had been murdered and I didn't know that some other it's
[12:42.800 --> 12:46.600]  all pro-gun gun show people they canceled three shows on Discovery that
[12:46.600 --> 12:53.320]  were top-rated including Jesse James's by the way I got his number and know him
[12:53.320 --> 12:55.760]  I've said now's the time to get on the show I just need to go ahead and get him
[12:55.760 --> 13:00.560]  on talk about what happened behind the scenes with that he lives here in Austin
[13:00.560 --> 13:05.920]  as a listener and all of this is just happening and and then last night I'm
[13:05.920 --> 13:13.720]  sitting there and imagine this there's a big storm our satellite dishes out blown
[13:13.720 --> 13:18.520]  out or whatever I live in the country Ron Paul's coming up by the way and our
[13:18.520 --> 13:22.640]  Internet's not working too good for whatever reason and so I go okay I guess
[13:22.640 --> 13:25.360]  we'll watch Piers Morgan so we're watching it on the computer and they've
[13:25.360 --> 13:29.160]  got the first guest on going gee I hope Alex Jones's kids don't get killed and
[13:29.160 --> 13:35.340]  that guy just comes off like an absolute scripted actor just my view on it I feel
[13:35.340 --> 13:42.000]  sorry for his loss or whatever but one of the victims families from Aurora and
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.640]  he's like I sure hope nothing happens to his kids on your own appears like I
[13:47.640 --> 13:52.440]  sure hope to and my kids are like what four years old eight years old ten years
[13:52.440 --> 13:59.160]  old and I said oh it's nothing the the internet feed of the show live starts
[13:59.160 --> 14:03.240]  cutting out so I'm in there reading books to him we're in the bedroom
[14:03.240 --> 14:10.080]  watching your TV on the computer my wife's there and it cuts back on and
[14:10.080 --> 14:14.680]  there's a Daily Beast reporter on there a senior reporter and he's saying you
[14:14.680 --> 14:19.680]  need to get a gun and and shoot Alex Jones and then the daughter of
[14:19.680 --> 14:26.480]  ambassador Huntsman says oh I'd love that we're gonna play it here in a
[14:26.480 --> 14:29.880]  moment and then Piers Morgan says you know I
[14:29.880 --> 14:33.240]  could dress up with my brother's uniform
[14:33.760 --> 14:39.200]  so this is just very bizarre and then there's all the quotes about how groups
[14:39.200 --> 14:42.800]  want to kill the NRA president or go after Larry Pratt mother Larry Pratt's
[14:42.800 --> 14:47.120]  popping in today he's gonna be on Piers Morgan tonight head of Gun Owners of
[14:47.120 --> 14:52.160]  America so this is a type of stuff going on and even more prominent gun owners
[14:52.160 --> 14:55.560]  because if I was the globalist I even said privately around here I said if
[14:55.560 --> 15:02.120]  this is true they'll kill people like F's FPS Russia because if you don't know
[15:02.120 --> 15:05.880]  what that is it's the most popular gun show in the world it's online and it's
[15:05.880 --> 15:10.760]  probably had 10 times the viewers of top shows on Discovery Channel that they've
[15:10.760 --> 15:13.480]  now just canceled
[15:14.280 --> 15:20.080]  600 million views on YouTube alone and they were accelerating it took them a
[15:20.080 --> 15:23.760]  couple years to get a hundred million views and now the last year or so they
[15:23.760 --> 15:26.320]  got another 500 million views they've got all these other platforms with
[15:26.320 --> 15:30.280]  hundreds of millions of views I mean they were dominating making guns fun
[15:30.280 --> 15:34.280]  they started getting girls in bikinis out there shooting machine guns and I
[15:34.280 --> 15:38.880]  said if this purge is real they will go after those guys first because see I'm
[15:38.880 --> 15:43.400]  here politically trying to wake people up what really works is making guns fun
[15:43.400 --> 15:50.400]  and sexy and now that guy's dead and some other people have been killed I've
[15:50.400 --> 15:53.320]  got a video an article up at info works calm about it some other prominent
[15:53.320 --> 15:57.960]  pro-gun people have died mysteriously and I'm getting followed by guys that
[15:57.960 --> 16:01.440]  are looking at me like they want to kill me
[16:02.200 --> 16:08.080]  and and again I'm telling CNN security when they're walking aside I go I want
[16:08.080 --> 16:11.160]  to go out the mall entrance it's open and they go no you're going out this way
[16:11.160 --> 16:16.680]  and I knew the entrance was right behind me to the mall there's a big mall it's
[16:16.680 --> 16:20.040]  built into a mall and I didn't want to have a confrontation I was like all
[16:20.040 --> 16:23.220]  right start rolling your camera as we're walking out so we catch one of the
[16:23.220 --> 16:26.520]  detectives and he turns what looks like one of the detectives you know in
[16:26.520 --> 16:30.400]  talking into a sleeve and walks into the wall walks into the corner it was that
[16:30.400 --> 16:33.800]  pathetic and there's other guys and dudes like you want to get footage I
[16:33.800 --> 16:36.060]  think he heard some of it last night I didn't I couldn't watch the nightly news
[16:36.060 --> 16:40.520]  shows I was driving home at that time he did air it and there's like two more of
[16:40.520 --> 16:44.940]  them coming down cops like this and I go taxi and we jump in a taxi and I'm like
[16:44.940 --> 16:48.280]  don't drive me to my hotel drive me somewhere else we drive a few blocks
[16:48.280 --> 16:51.960]  over and I walk up and now the streets blocked off in front of our hotel I'm
[16:51.960 --> 16:55.920]  like that's it I walk in there's more of the guys sitting there waiting for us
[16:55.920 --> 17:00.240]  with newspapers looking up we come in I'm like let's get out of here and these
[17:00.240 --> 17:06.080]  guys were in suits so let me tell you there may be the beginning of a purge
[17:06.080 --> 17:09.240]  against gun owners and we cannot and they're gonna go after those of us that
[17:09.240 --> 17:13.560]  are prominent if I get pulled over and the cop claims I pulled a gun on them
[17:13.560 --> 17:18.600]  it's not true if I get shot in the head I mean I've seen they executed a CIA guy
[17:18.600 --> 17:24.800]  a few years ago at Carney was his last name in Houston and they just get him
[17:24.800 --> 17:27.740]  out of the car he steps out and they just the cop shoots him in the head the
[17:27.740 --> 17:31.240]  news said well that's okay he's allowed to do that and he'd been blowing the
[17:31.240 --> 17:36.320]  whistle according to our NSA source well I have one it one NSA source and then
[17:36.320 --> 17:40.200]  one that's public I have Wayne Madsen and he confirmed what our other source
[17:40.200 --> 17:42.400]  said
[17:43.040 --> 17:48.060]  so if they just pull me over to shoot me in the head hey I'm a martyr just know
[17:48.060 --> 17:52.920]  it's on canary in the coal mine if they if I'm found dead in a hotel room with a
[17:52.920 --> 17:56.160]  hooker I don't go to hotel rooms with hookers I don't use illegal drugs I
[17:56.160 --> 17:59.720]  don't even use prescription drugs I mean I've had like broken legs before and
[17:59.720 --> 18:03.440]  didn't want to take the painkillers that makes me nauseous
[18:05.560 --> 18:11.640]  if if a if I get run over walking down the street you can bet I was killed if
[18:11.640 --> 18:15.660]  I'm struck by a bolt of lightning you can bet I was it was a setup another way
[18:15.660 --> 18:19.120]  they'll do it is if I get carjacked
[18:21.720 --> 18:25.160]  I mean they killed a Palestinian activist who was a professor who wasn't
[18:25.160 --> 18:28.920]  doing anything and his arms and legs were duct tape and his throat slit in
[18:28.920 --> 18:34.840]  the ear and I had to lose a progressive Muslim group pretty mainline and I had
[18:34.840 --> 18:38.320]  the imam call me I think he may have been on the show and they talked about
[18:38.320 --> 18:42.180]  they got the body from the APD and then it later came out in the news and he'd
[18:42.180 --> 18:47.700]  been tortured to death and he was all bound with duct tape and the police said
[18:47.700 --> 18:51.120]  well you can you can be get bound with duct tape and slit your own throat and
[18:51.120 --> 18:55.880]  stuff and throw yourself into Lake Austin which is really a river Colorado
[18:55.880 --> 18:58.200]  River they call it like Austin I'm sorry they changed name again it's now
[18:58.200 --> 19:04.640]  Ladybird Lake maybe they'll call it you know possum lake next I don't know but
[19:04.640 --> 19:08.600]  if I get found with duct tape I mean it's like Fannie Malick the Arkansas
[19:08.600 --> 19:12.200]  medical examiner under Clinton where people have their arms and legs cut off
[19:12.200 --> 19:16.520]  machine gun in a trash pile and they'd say the person killed themselves you
[19:16.520 --> 19:20.920]  cannot chop your arms and legs and head off it's like when they killed Gary Webb
[19:20.920 --> 19:25.240]  the Pulitzer Prize winner on Dark Majesty and Dark Alliance the CIA drug
[19:25.240 --> 19:29.040]  dealing he had a new book coming out totally documenting it even more and I
[19:29.040 --> 19:32.040]  talked to friends of his said his house was getting broken into he'd moved he'd
[19:32.040 --> 19:35.560]  seen Special Forces guys from his two-story sliding down the drainage
[19:35.560 --> 19:41.040]  poles like in a movie and they had him sign a deal saying that he was you know
[19:41.040 --> 19:45.320]  gonna commit suicide that shot him twice in the head first they blew his jaw off
[19:45.320 --> 19:49.800]  they really killed him with a shotgun the police had a revolver so just just
[19:49.800 --> 19:53.840]  get it straight folks they may start killing us stay with us

[24:38.280 --> 24:48.760]  is coming up I was just walking back there and CNN was re-airing a clip of
[24:48.760 --> 24:53.240]  what we're about to play here so this is the message being sent out this is what
[24:53.240 --> 24:57.120]  they said on CNN last night on Piers Morgan before they called for me to be
[24:57.120 --> 25:02.160]  shot in the next panel here is a clip from Piers Morgan I don't want Alex
[25:02.160 --> 25:06.040]  Jones to get the phone call at three o'clock in the morning that one of his
[25:06.040 --> 25:10.480]  children have been shot and killed by somebody who shouldn't have a handgun or
[25:10.480 --> 25:16.160]  a rifle or a automatic weapon I don't want him to get that phone call no I
[25:16.160 --> 25:18.560]  think that's the reason that is the whole point of you yeah that is the
[25:18.560 --> 25:23.720]  whole point okay and so I'm watching that and then the next panel comes on
[25:23.720 --> 25:30.080]  and again this article is up at info Wars calm you can go to the site Piers
[25:30.080 --> 25:35.480]  Morgan and guests discuss shooting Alex Jones it's the bottom of the featured
[25:35.480 --> 25:38.760]  news we're gonna move it back to the top of the featured news it's also a drudge
[25:38.760 --> 25:42.800]  report calm on the left-hand side by the Piers Morgan photos an easy way to find
[25:42.800 --> 25:50.680]  it and here you have in this clip Daily Beast writer Buzz Bissinger says Piers
[25:50.680 --> 25:56.440]  Morgan should pop Alex Jones with a semi-automatic weapon then Abby Huntsman
[25:56.440 --> 26:02.400]  it looks like her father with a wig on the governor and ambassador to China top
[26:02.400 --> 26:07.560]  globalist just absolute New World Order pusher said I'd love to see that in
[26:07.560 --> 26:11.080]  uniform because that's psych warfare oh you're in a uniform you kill him it's
[26:11.080 --> 26:15.720]  okay and peers does maybe I'll wear my brothers who's been in the military so
[26:15.720 --> 26:19.360]  Piers Morgan is saying I'll borrow my brother's uniform to shoot Alex Jones
[26:19.360 --> 26:26.160]  now people can say oh that must be a joke if I would have said hey Piers
[26:26.160 --> 26:32.280]  Morgan I might get a gun and shoot you I guarantee you they would have
[26:32.280 --> 26:35.200]  arrested me on the spot and they had the plainclothes detectives they're milling
[26:35.200 --> 26:42.280]  around inside now I guarantee it and this is becoming a story some picked up
[26:42.280 --> 26:47.960]  by several newspapers because they all basically get their their newsroom info
[26:47.960 --> 26:51.120]  from drudge report calm I appreciate drudge putting that up there because I
[26:51.120 --> 26:55.520]  need to I need coverage of this or I'm I mean we're all hanging together here are
[26:55.520 --> 26:58.920]  we hang separate I mean this is really coming down to the wire and they're in
[26:58.920 --> 27:01.840]  there finding the Doug Hagman clip from two weeks ago where he said they're
[27:01.840 --> 27:10.800]  gonna start killing prominent proponents of the Second Amendment and I noticed
[27:10.800 --> 27:13.720]  that they're saying I'm dangerous I shouldn't have a platform Glenn Beck
[27:13.720 --> 27:17.380]  said the exact same thing we're getting clips of that for later and I got to
[27:17.380 --> 27:21.240]  tell you it's creepy this is not the type of attention I like but I've got to
[27:21.240 --> 27:24.600]  do it all I can do is speak up and get in their face and try to get folks out
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.760]  of their trance and I just prayed to God help me do a good job and that's what I
[27:28.760 --> 27:34.200]  did and yeah I'm the guy in the arena it's easy to be the critic out there but
[27:34.200 --> 27:37.960]  what about the person in the arena who's got the dust in their eyes and who's
[27:37.960 --> 27:41.960]  bloodied in the fight who knows the great you guys print me the Teddy
[27:41.960 --> 27:45.720]  Roosevelt cloak I want to cover that let's go ahead and now go to this clip
[27:45.720 --> 27:50.120]  of a man that looks completely deranged
[27:50.560 --> 27:54.680]  the author of Friday Night Lights it's actually pretty good book up there
[27:54.680 --> 27:58.280]  fantasizing and I've been around these people behind the scenes with quote
[27:58.280 --> 28:01.280]  liberals all they ever talk about is how they want to shoot us and kill us see
[28:01.280 --> 28:07.240]  they're not liberals they're authoritarians and here is the clip
[28:07.240 --> 28:12.840]  where they fantasize about dressing up in uniforms and shooting me here it is
[28:12.840 --> 28:17.720]  but what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for the only reason I think you
[28:17.720 --> 28:21.840]  need it is Pierce challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match show up with a
[28:21.840 --> 28:29.200]  semi-automatic that you got legally and pop them I'd love to see that I borrow
[28:29.200 --> 28:32.720]  my brother's you think guns are more guns are the answer here I mean there
[28:32.720 --> 28:36.240]  are a lot they keep saying to me more guns that's crime more guns that's crime
[28:36.240 --> 28:40.760]  in fact that's just not backed up by any real evidence it's not and and we talked
[28:40.760 --> 28:45.280]  about that's not true not intend to live in a society the modern society that we
[28:45.280 --> 28:49.040]  live in today I mean just they always tell us what the founders stood for
[28:49.040 --> 28:53.840]  ladies and gentlemen since guns proliferated the last 20 years I've
[28:53.840 --> 28:57.680]  shown you the statistics about 50 times I'm not gonna do it again fbi.gov over
[28:57.680 --> 29:02.680]  20% crime rate drop in the last 16 17 years but now you look at it and most of
[29:02.680 --> 29:07.080]  it in the last five to six years 11 to 12 percent of it depending on how you
[29:07.080 --> 29:11.920]  cut it has happened just since 2007 and that's the new crime numbers from 2011
[29:11.920 --> 29:15.520]  they come out a year later they're very accurate statistics compiled by local
[29:15.520 --> 29:19.840]  police departments and integrated with federal numbers violent crimes get
[29:19.840 --> 29:24.480]  reported and violent crime is down because criminals are getting their butt
[29:24.480 --> 29:28.100]  shot off everywhere by the way of the 11,000 people the diver here most of its
[29:28.100 --> 29:32.600]  gang bangers and the rest is suicide it's a very small portion of innocence
[29:32.600 --> 29:36.720]  but see out of 315 million people they can show a one guy shooting his wife
[29:36.720 --> 29:41.600]  once a week and make it sound like it's an epidemic all right we'll be back

[33:24.240 --> 33:30.400]  congressman the first time I interviewed him he was running for Congress again I
[33:30.400 --> 33:35.160]  guess back in 95 96 and he'd been in Congress once before as a libertarian
[33:35.160 --> 33:39.720]  and of course went back as a Republican and he has been our greatest defender of
[33:39.720 --> 33:43.200]  Liberty worldwide loved and admired he's got big announcements coming up soon
[33:43.200 --> 33:48.600]  I've heard the rumors and I'll see if he'll give us any hint but he joins us
[33:48.600 --> 33:51.960]  obviously to talk about the fiscal cliff that he said we've already gone over a
[33:51.960 --> 33:56.640]  long time ago what's happening with that the Sandy Hook shooting the announcements
[33:56.640 --> 34:00.120]  of the NSA openly spying on us it's like everything Ron Paul talked about 15
[34:00.120 --> 34:04.320]  years ago and got called a conspiracy theorist is now just out in the open and
[34:04.320 --> 34:09.800]  former congressman and really Omni Budsman of Liberty worldwide thank you
[34:09.800 --> 34:14.960]  so much for spending time with us did you have a good Christmas yep very good
[34:14.960 --> 34:20.760]  family got here we had a lot of fun and didn't solve any world problem I wish I
[34:20.760 --> 34:24.720]  need to learn how to unplug as well Wow you know you heard what I threw out
[34:24.720 --> 34:29.200]  there sir where would you like to start first well the things that I've talked
[34:29.200 --> 34:33.840]  about is mostly well the general you know deterioration of our individual
[34:33.840 --> 34:39.440]  freedoms and our liberties in our market but I think the big thing as I went down
[34:39.440 --> 34:45.960]  my career dealt with you know financial and the economy and I think both major
[34:45.960 --> 34:50.320]  parties and most members of Congress are in total denial as to what the real
[34:50.320 --> 34:56.160]  problem is because they think it's just a budget you know well if we change this
[34:56.160 --> 35:00.600]  number raise taxes cut spending you know pretend to cut spending we saw the
[35:00.600 --> 35:04.520]  problem and I think it's much bigger than I think first off the country is
[35:04.520 --> 35:08.560]  bankrupt we're insolvent we can't pay the bills and they won't admit it I mean
[35:08.560 --> 35:14.880]  we have these obligations of 220 trillion dollars a national debt of 16
[35:14.880 --> 35:21.160]  trillions we're the biggest born debtor nation ever and that is ignored and they
[35:21.160 --> 35:27.640]  they talk about you know what they're going to do with tinkering with the tax
[35:27.640 --> 35:33.920]  code and and they talk about cuts which aren't cut there it's just all deceit
[35:33.920 --> 35:39.320]  and trying to fool the people into believing that they can tinker with a
[35:39.320 --> 35:43.640]  budget but I think the problem is is government is too big they don't follow
[35:43.640 --> 35:46.800]  the Constitution they don't know what the rule of government ought to be in a
[35:46.800 --> 35:51.720]  free society and they don't admit we're bankrupt and oftentimes I've used this
[35:51.720 --> 35:57.280]  saying that are we going to go over the cliff well in many ways we're over the
[35:57.280 --> 36:00.880]  cliff in that we're not going to retrace ourselves if you're over a cliff you
[36:00.880 --> 36:04.560]  just don't have a chance to climb back up and we really don't we're not going
[36:04.560 --> 36:09.360]  to have enough people in Congress in the next go around or do we have them now we
[36:09.360 --> 36:13.440]  have better people now and we're gonna have some people speaking for us but we
[36:13.440 --> 36:17.720]  can't go back and all of a sudden balance our budget remove the
[36:17.720 --> 36:21.600]  regulations and protect our liberties all we have to do is listen to our
[36:21.600 --> 36:25.640]  president what his plans are but the Republicans aren't you know doing a
[36:25.640 --> 36:31.440]  whole lot more because we have we're doing we're facing a situation where it
[36:31.440 --> 36:36.480]  took a hundred years for our governments and our schools to indoctrinate our
[36:36.480 --> 36:40.800]  people to accepting the idea that the role of government ought to be to take
[36:40.800 --> 36:46.680]  care of us and provide perfect safety and make sure nobody falls through you
[36:46.680 --> 36:53.760]  know the net and and take care of people and the whole world and I think we have
[36:53.760 --> 36:56.680]  to address the subject what should the role of government be the founders made
[36:56.680 --> 37:00.480]  an attempt at it they wrote a constitution we don't obey it and to me
[37:00.480 --> 37:03.840]  if we would accept the notion that the role of government is to protect our
[37:03.840 --> 37:08.400]  freedoms to provide some national defense for us providing a sound
[37:08.400 --> 37:13.960]  currency and protect our liberties there would be no warfare state and there'd be
[37:13.960 --> 37:19.080]  no welfare state and nobody wants to address that you know in all this talk
[37:19.080 --> 37:23.960]  neither and there's neither Republicans or Democrats would even suggest about
[37:23.960 --> 37:29.880]  cutting the militarism the only talk was should we increase the military
[37:29.880 --> 37:37.560]  expenditures by 18% or 20 the people who wanted 18% were castigated for slashing
[37:37.560 --> 37:42.040]  national defense instead they were you know unpatriotic so that is where the
[37:42.040 --> 37:46.840]  mess is I see the mess that we're in a problem of education the consequence of
[37:46.840 --> 37:52.480]  a hundred years of control of many generations indoctrinating them into bad
[37:52.480 --> 37:57.680]  economic policy and bad foreign policy congressman you've talked about
[37:57.680 --> 38:01.480]  globalism the Bilderberg group people like that but it's now in the financial
[38:01.480 --> 38:04.520]  times of London it's in hundreds of papers that we can probably pull some up
[38:04.520 --> 38:07.880]  and put them on screen where they announce global government by the six
[38:07.880 --> 38:12.480]  mega banks and I listen to Bloomberg Financial on XM and they brag that
[38:12.480 --> 38:15.880]  they've conquered Europe with debt they've signed the Europeans on to
[38:15.880 --> 38:19.720]  derivatives they've got them dependent on socialism but most of the debt is
[38:19.720 --> 38:25.080]  actually the central bank's debt that are really private and now I see them
[38:25.080 --> 38:30.840]  wrecking us congressman on purpose to make us debt slaves while also making us
[38:30.840 --> 38:34.640]  dependent I mean surely they know the facts even the Congressional Budget
[38:34.640 --> 38:38.200]  Office as you know three four years ago said we were bankrupt all these other
[38:38.200 --> 38:42.480]  government economists have admitted this so you're not just somebody studied
[38:42.480 --> 38:46.000]  economics you're also a medical doctor it's kind of like a patient that's got
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.040]  cancer all over their body this is already a done deal so what's your take
[38:51.040 --> 38:55.920]  on my statement that we've been maneuvered into rack and ruin by loan
[38:55.920 --> 38:59.240]  sharks I mean I think it's important to not just say they're a bunch of buffoons
[38:59.240 --> 39:05.680]  in DC Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and others in my research are just mafia
[39:05.680 --> 39:11.000]  organizations that want us as basically debt slaves on a sharecropping
[39:11.000 --> 39:18.280]  plantation partially true but it also involved indoctrination through through
[39:18.280 --> 39:22.240]  education it's just not ten or fifteen people who get together and all of a
[39:22.240 --> 39:26.040]  sudden they can change people's minds people endorse Keynesianism they endorse
[39:26.040 --> 39:29.480]  the Federal Reserve they endorse us being the policeman of the world and we
[39:29.480 --> 39:33.560]  should have these wars in the Middle East so they have been indoctrinated and
[39:33.560 --> 39:37.960]  yes there are a few who are going to benefit but you know I don't I can't
[39:37.960 --> 39:41.480]  read into their minds I don't know they sit back and say you know what we're
[39:41.480 --> 39:44.880]  going to bankrupt the country and cause its chaos I think they try to get away
[39:44.880 --> 39:48.920]  with manipulating and maneuvering and benefiting themselves both with power
[39:48.920 --> 39:54.920]  and money and philosophically it doesn't doesn't work out so they have to react
[39:54.920 --> 39:59.760]  so they take advantage of it sort of like taking advantage don't let a major
[39:59.760 --> 40:04.640]  crisis and go to waste I mean they create the problems they think they're
[40:04.640 --> 40:09.000]  going to get away with it and then when the crisis hits they make use of it and
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.880]  they say well we had well we have to do they're motivated by money and power and
[40:12.880 --> 40:18.840]  they have to control sure they're smart enough to on a daily basis say well
[40:18.840 --> 40:22.240]  we're going to do a and B is going to be resolved I think there are mostly
[40:22.240 --> 40:27.680]  unintended consequences that occur and they and they react I'd like to get
[40:27.680 --> 40:33.040]  people to react differently I agree with you that at the mid level even the upper
[40:33.040 --> 40:37.200]  levels obviously it's just a corrupt system people been born into now but I'm
[40:37.200 --> 40:40.320]  talking about the hundred and twelve point plan that got leaked out of the
[40:40.320 --> 40:44.560]  World Bank when Joseph stick let's resign the Nobel Prize winner economics
[40:44.560 --> 40:49.360]  in 2002 it talked about how they manipulated third world countries into
[40:49.360 --> 40:54.080]  bankruptcy to take control and it discussed doing it to the west so at
[40:54.080 --> 41:00.000]  Bilderberg from our sources but also at Davos they I've got Herman von Ruppe
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.480]  head of the EU saying we're going to use the financial crisis to bring in the New
[41:03.480 --> 41:09.960]  World Order well you know that may be and I don't know every individual who
[41:09.960 --> 41:15.160]  makes these plans but I do know that I meet a lot of people who believe I mean
[41:15.160 --> 41:20.280]  you take a guy like Bernanke I think Bernanke actually believes that joke you
[41:20.280 --> 41:26.120]  know I think he really believes that he's been sent here by the Creator to
[41:26.120 --> 41:28.840]  make sure we never have a Great Depression before because they didn't
[41:28.840 --> 41:33.720]  put the money fast enough I don't think he he sits and says and goes much
[41:33.720 --> 41:38.480]  further than this because he has invested a lifetime into proving this
[41:38.480 --> 41:43.680]  ideology I think he's wrong he's determined to prove he's right so he
[41:43.680 --> 41:48.600]  creates truly sure it's in these people that you're talking about they know
[41:48.600 --> 41:52.840]  what's going on and they line up and they get involved and they learn how to
[41:52.840 --> 41:59.080]  manipulate the system for political reasons so we we know that our president
[41:59.080 --> 42:04.040]  has an agenda and it's very very clear so he works his agenda with the system
[42:04.040 --> 42:07.920]  that exists I agree with you there's different factions who only care about
[42:07.920 --> 42:11.400]  themselves and together the the perfect for me you're saying he thinks he's
[42:11.400 --> 42:14.920]  right you think you're right sir you know I watch a speech that's in our film
[42:14.920 --> 42:19.640]  matrix of evil you gave in 2003 at McKinney roughs right outside Austin
[42:19.640 --> 42:23.600]  here in South Austin and you laid out everything that was going to happen how
[42:23.600 --> 42:27.560]  they'd use the drones here how they'd have the NSA spy on us how they would
[42:27.560 --> 42:31.520]  use the Patriot Act on the citizens how how when they collapse things they would
[42:31.520 --> 42:35.240]  use that to take full control how the derivatives bubble would work it's like
[42:35.240 --> 42:37.840]  you're a prophet but you're not you were in there in the committees you've
[42:37.840 --> 42:41.640]  studied history you know what was gonna happen you said the stimulus would work
[42:41.640 --> 42:46.600]  you said all these things wouldn't work you said that the Republicans would vote
[42:46.600 --> 42:52.360]  to raise taxes $1 of cuts for every 41 and spending increases 77% of Americans
[42:52.360 --> 42:58.080]  with tax increases on payroll I mean it's like the lying and what's happened
[42:58.080 --> 43:01.920]  is we've been eased into this tyranny and so now you're here saying well we'll
[43:01.920 --> 43:05.520]  see who's gonna be proven right you've been proven right congressman toot your
[43:05.520 --> 43:12.720]  own horns well I will keep tooting my horn about what I believe in because I
[43:12.720 --> 43:16.760]  think there are those who do exactly what you're talking about I remember
[43:16.760 --> 43:22.200]  very clearly George Bush senior you know when the WTO came in and you say that
[43:22.200 --> 43:27.960]  now so much of these plans are out in the open and I think George Bush put him
[43:27.960 --> 43:32.640]  out in the open when he said I saw a major ad I think was in the New York
[43:32.640 --> 43:38.200]  Times or something that we put on the third leg of the New World Order before
[43:38.200 --> 43:42.560]  that you couldn't say New World Order out loud I mean or you were a complete
[43:42.560 --> 43:48.480]  idiot or a nut job but he put it out he says we have it now we have the WTO we
[43:48.480 --> 43:53.480]  we have the IMF and we have the World Bank and I think yes but they have a
[43:53.480 --> 43:59.640]  philosophic belief that world government is good and some of them believe it
[43:59.640 --> 44:04.640]  because they think world government just like world communism is is good and and
[44:04.640 --> 44:08.880]  some people who join communism they were sincere they thought it was good but
[44:08.880 --> 44:15.240]  others are driven by power they're driven by wealth and control and they're
[44:15.240 --> 44:20.000]  they're psychopathic and they want to use force against people so I think they
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.240]  feed on each other is what I think happens but I think if you get but all
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.840]  governments reflect popular opinion and there's no I agree with you I've heard
[44:28.840 --> 44:31.640]  you say over and over again this is happening because we become lazy
[44:31.640 --> 44:36.640]  decadent slobs I work some days 18 hours a day but I'll be honest compared to my
[44:36.640 --> 44:42.080]  dad or somebody like his dad who grew up on farms they enjoy working they can fix
[44:42.080 --> 44:46.280]  anything they I mean my dad I call him at 3 in the morning and he'll come help
[44:46.280 --> 44:51.840]  me and I worry because I mean I'm a shadow of my dad he's a shadow of his
[44:51.840 --> 44:57.100]  dad I'm not teaching my kids to work that hard like I I mean I I think we
[44:57.100 --> 45:01.780]  really are degenerating and I'm not I'm not romanticizing old-timers I just know
[45:01.780 --> 45:06.280]  that people used to be closer to the ground more street smart and harder
[45:06.280 --> 45:11.000]  working more independent and not as decadent and there is a feedback loop of
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.940]  decadence now that's almost impossible to escape well I know exactly what you're
[45:15.940 --> 45:19.840]  talking about would agree with you to a great deal but also look for the
[45:19.840 --> 45:24.960]  positive things because if I look at the young people that come out for my
[45:24.960 --> 45:30.480]  rallies I see young people who are very dedicated they're very principled their
[45:30.480 --> 45:34.520]  idealistic and they're not decadent when it comes to computers and the Internet
[45:34.520 --> 45:39.500]  they're pretty darn smart and I don't know the technology but I know how
[45:39.500 --> 45:44.040]  valuable it is and I'm able to use it and get other people to help me so in
[45:44.040 --> 45:50.800]  that sense I become the optimist because technology so far in most of all of
[45:50.800 --> 45:54.240]  history has always been used to enhance the power of the state and to kill
[45:54.240 --> 46:00.240]  people you know this is one time if we're smart enough that we ought to be
[46:00.240 --> 46:04.280]  able to use this technology and spread information you do it all the time you
[46:04.280 --> 46:09.000]  you know about the technology we're spreading this message so I I get to be
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.320]  optimistic that all we have to do is continue this and that is why in my
[46:13.320 --> 46:18.440]  farewell speech the most dangerous trend that we have to stop is the threat to
[46:18.440 --> 46:23.000]  our civil liberties our ability to resist you know what is the what are
[46:23.000 --> 46:28.000]  these people how many people are going to be arrested you know and put in
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.120]  secret prisons and how often are we going to be able to maintain our First
[46:32.120 --> 46:35.720]  Amendment rights and our Second Amendment rights that is the protection
[46:35.720 --> 46:39.560]  of civil liberties it's most important but the best way to do is awaken a
[46:39.560 --> 46:43.880]  generation and we have the tool and it's the internet and we have a very
[46:43.880 --> 46:48.480]  responsive young group and they what happens to the establishment they eat
[46:48.480 --> 46:52.600]  this out of us they do it with every generation to make you feel like you're
[46:52.600 --> 46:57.680]  a bad guy because you think freedom is good now our job and we have these tools
[46:57.680 --> 47:01.640]  is to make sure that this whole new generation knows that freedom their
[47:01.640 --> 47:05.640]  instincts are right we're all natural believers in Liberty we're all
[47:05.640 --> 47:10.200]  libertarian in the sense that we want to be left alone but it's beaten out of us
[47:10.200 --> 47:16.800]  by our system the movies that schools the government all these things so I see
[47:16.800 --> 47:23.200]  a tremendous opportunity and I hope I'm not totally deceiving myself but I'll
[47:23.200 --> 47:29.160]  keep working with the assumption that we can change people's mind yes sir and to
[47:29.160 --> 47:33.960]  be clear I was speaking in generalities like you did in your powerful farewell
[47:33.960 --> 47:38.160]  address from Congress that's gone so viral out there thank God thanks to
[47:38.160 --> 47:41.360]  drudgereport.com and other big sites that posted it millions and millions of
[47:41.360 --> 47:45.000]  views just on the internet alone that obviously there are the Liberty loving
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.880]  people who are a growing minority but it's it's pretty much the wheat from the
[47:49.880 --> 47:53.920]  chaff people are either getting totally mind blown and accepting any level of
[47:53.920 --> 47:58.440]  corruption or they're getting more and more active and we have to take heart as
[47:58.440 --> 48:03.480]  you've said 5% started and won the Revolutionary War well we're trying to
[48:03.480 --> 48:08.520]  win an inflow war we've got more like 25 30 percent now that are awake all we've
[48:08.520 --> 48:12.540]  got to do is wake up others and then we're gonna take the country back and so
[48:12.540 --> 48:16.380]  there's a race by the authoritarians to take over but that there's good factions
[48:16.380 --> 48:21.400]  people need to know that yeah you're absolutely right and the thing that's on
[48:21.400 --> 48:26.100]  our side is not only has our message grown in popularity and we've been able
[48:26.100 --> 48:31.720]  to spread it but the opportunity is the absolute failure of their system
[48:31.720 --> 48:35.940]  communism you don't hear people come on you know I'm a communist I think the
[48:35.940 --> 48:40.540]  communism is gonna take over the world communism failed it fell apart the
[48:40.540 --> 48:44.240]  Soviet system doesn't exist but Keynesianism the planned economy
[48:44.240 --> 48:49.600]  welfareism inflationism it's failing it's failed over and over again and they
[48:49.600 --> 48:53.920]  keep saying capitalism has failed no that's a big challenge we have to make
[48:53.920 --> 48:58.000]  sure that we don't get blamed it isn't capitalism fail they haven't ever
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.840]  really even tried total free market and that's what we should force on them I
[49:01.840 --> 49:05.520]  agree with you moving quickly there are other points campaign for liberty dot o
[49:05.520 --> 49:09.940]  RG I've been told you know a little bit here a little bit there from different
[49:09.940 --> 49:13.920]  folks you've got three big things that are going to be announced soon a can you
[49:13.920 --> 49:20.200]  give us any sneak peek and B when will this announcement come a Ron Paul
[49:20.200 --> 49:25.760]  a lot of things I've been talking about and planning for they're not quite ready
[49:25.760 --> 49:31.720]  but there's a possibility I'll be able to do some type of programming you know
[49:31.720 --> 49:38.720]  on the internet not on regular TV and if that works out you know I think we can
[49:38.720 --> 49:42.880]  get a big audience for what we're doing I'm going to be very interested in
[49:42.880 --> 49:46.300]  promoting homeschooling because I talk about education all the time and I think
[49:46.300 --> 49:51.200]  the public school system is feeling and you know it isn't the rich people that
[49:51.200 --> 49:56.440]  are taking their kids you know doing the homeschooling but I think average people
[49:56.440 --> 50:01.280]  and even poor people can salvage their children from the system by by
[50:01.280 --> 50:07.880]  homeschooling and I'm also going to be touring the colleges soon I will be
[50:07.880 --> 50:14.840]  starting that so I'll continue to do that so I have a lot of things that I
[50:14.840 --> 50:20.080]  can do but they're not all firm yet that's right but I mean I heard about a
[50:20.080 --> 50:25.800]  Ron Paul theatrical release Ron Paul TV and something else I heard is being
[50:25.800 --> 50:34.320]  planned I want to make sure you know little birds tell me this and that but
[50:34.320 --> 50:39.400]  you know I keep my ear to the ground all I know is very exciting and I'm not
[50:39.400 --> 50:42.400]  taking this moment to bash Glenn Beck I've tried to be nice to him but he says
[50:42.400 --> 50:49.800]  he's not a leader of the libertarian movement because he told me that your
[50:49.800 --> 50:52.560]  supporters four years ago we're gonna blow us up with bombs and that we did
[50:52.560 --> 50:56.240]  Oklahoma City and then he keeps you know saying that we shouldn't get in the
[50:56.240 --> 50:59.880]  government's face I mean my only deal with Glenn Beck is he says I'm dangerous
[50:59.880 --> 51:03.780]  and basically shouldn't be on the air Piers Morgan basically says that as well
[51:03.780 --> 51:07.720]  and then now he tells me that he's my leader and he's now going to become Ron
[51:07.720 --> 51:12.080]  Paul and Alex Jones I guess mix to do you have any comments on that not too
[51:12.080 --> 51:16.080]  much because I don't know exactly what he's talking about all I can do is speak
[51:16.080 --> 51:20.240]  for myself what I believe in on what I'm trying to do and I've been pretty much
[51:20.240 --> 51:25.280]  upfront on you know what the principles are and in which direction we should go
[51:25.280 --> 51:32.960]  and effort I I think I do one thing differently than others and that is I try
[51:32.960 --> 51:38.280]  to stick to you know ideas rather than personalities and of course we've already
[51:38.280 --> 51:42.400]  mentioned the president and I mentioned George Bush but over the years I
[51:42.400 --> 51:47.520]  basically don't attack the individuals I don't surely attack sure but you didn't
[51:47.520 --> 51:50.440]  call him a demagogue when he said that your supporters want to blow up
[51:50.440 --> 51:55.360]  buildings that's for sure but generally speaking I don't I don't do the
[51:55.360 --> 51:59.280]  personality thing that is doesn't mean that matter of fact if you do the
[51:59.280 --> 52:03.160]  personality thing you get a lot more attention but I don't want it to distract
[52:03.160 --> 52:08.600]  if people want they'll try to entice me to say what should we do with Bernanke
[52:08.600 --> 52:13.120]  how should we punish them remember what our governor said that we should do with
[52:13.120 --> 52:17.520]  them I I might agree with it I might even say things along that way but most
[52:17.520 --> 52:21.240]  of the time I'll go and say it's the system it's the system of the Federal
[52:21.240 --> 52:26.320]  Reserve no I agree I agree is what I want to concentrate some people will
[52:26.320 --> 52:29.440]  concentrate on different things they'll have different tactics and different
[52:29.440 --> 52:32.920]  viewpoints and I think I think that's fine no no listen I think Glenn Beck
[52:32.920 --> 52:35.600]  does a lot of great work and has gotten better and better he is just
[52:35.600 --> 52:39.160]  systematically I don't in fight you'll never hear my show talking about other
[52:39.160 --> 52:43.200]  people that are in the Liberty Movement he just routinely says I'm he said I
[52:43.200 --> 52:47.760]  made up the 1.6 million bullets even though that's AP Reuters direct federal
[52:47.760 --> 52:52.040]  purchases you know I'm making up the police state I'm making up NSA spying
[52:52.040 --> 52:57.840]  your supporters want to blow buildings up I mean he is trying to gatekeep and
[52:57.840 --> 53:03.160]  I'm just warning you that that unless you join with Sauron dr. Paul he's gonna
[53:03.160 --> 53:06.240]  he's gonna stab you in the back and I'm only saying that like kind of like a
[53:06.240 --> 53:10.160]  chart when you're coming into a bay in a boat I'm just marking the chart dr. Paul
[53:10.160 --> 53:13.120]  but you're a smart guy you know that we've only got about six seven minutes
[53:13.120 --> 53:17.720]  left in closing Sandy Hook and now the Feinstein bill and others to make us
[53:17.720 --> 53:21.800]  physically turn them in not just go back and re-register with the ATF at their
[53:21.800 --> 53:26.080]  pleasure now they want to just open where they decide law-abiding citizens
[53:26.080 --> 53:29.760]  turning their guns in what is your take on that and are you concerned about a
[53:29.760 --> 53:34.040]  purge or persecution of gun owners well I'm concerned about their
[53:34.040 --> 53:37.880]  inconsistency they want to get rid of guns because somebody used a gun and did
[53:37.880 --> 53:43.100]  some violence but we all know that more people are getting killed with hammers
[53:43.100 --> 53:49.040]  and fists and knives so they're not very they're not very consistent they see an
[53:49.040 --> 53:54.400]  opportunity they they they want to get rid of the guns some people believe
[53:54.400 --> 53:57.440]  they're dangerous and want to get rid of them and other people want to get rid of
[53:57.440 --> 54:01.780]  them because they know that guns can resist the government tyranny and some
[54:01.780 --> 54:06.640]  people like the idea that governments become tyrants and they should run
[54:06.640 --> 54:10.280]  things as long as the government kills children it's okay so they want to
[54:10.280 --> 54:16.440]  protect that you know all that scandal and outcry which much of it was
[54:16.440 --> 54:21.320]  justified seeing kids getting killed it's a horror but at the same time how
[54:21.320 --> 54:24.600]  about those people who are saying okay this is an excuse to take away the
[54:24.600 --> 54:28.360]  rights of people who use guns to defend their family how many of them are
[54:28.360 --> 54:32.240]  shouting and screaming about the children that our drones are killing on
[54:32.240 --> 54:37.000]  a daily paid basis because they're Muslim kids and different color and
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.920]  they're overseas and and nobody has to line them up and shoot them we can do it
[54:41.920 --> 54:47.200]  by directing drones from this country that doesn't even count so that's that's
[54:47.200 --> 54:51.160]  what their whole goal is is to distract us from some of the horrors that
[54:51.160 --> 54:55.000]  government perpetuate and the way they destroy our liberties and they
[54:55.000 --> 54:59.000]  perpetuate the violence I mean compared to the violence that governments have
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.220]  perpetuated on the people versus what the people do to each other there's no
[55:03.220 --> 55:06.720]  contest historically government's the number one killer as you know university
[55:06.720 --> 55:11.600]  studies out of Hawaii and others 292 million people killed the 20th century
[55:11.600 --> 55:15.360]  non-military combatants we have a red alert serve that just came out while you
[55:15.360 --> 55:21.840]  were on with us drugs report calm weekly standard AP you name it Obama White
[55:21.840 --> 55:25.640]  House threatens executive action to physically confiscate the firearms
[55:25.640 --> 55:31.220]  Biden has now given a speech sir they've got a bunch of state reps and federal
[55:31.220 --> 55:35.000]  reps I've literally got over 10 articles they're all calling for executive orders
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.800]  and Obama is saying now that he may he'll do everything in his power
[55:38.800 --> 55:42.960]  including executive orders ladies and gentlemen this is what we feared
[55:42.960 --> 55:46.720]  congressman constitutionally that's beyond a constitutional crisis as a
[55:46.720 --> 55:51.640]  constitutional expert sir if he signs an order ordering we turn in our guns what
[55:51.640 --> 55:56.560]  does that mean well she'd go without saying that he's gone way too far it
[55:56.560 --> 56:01.520]  also should go without saying that he's acting with the use of illegal violence
[56:01.520 --> 56:07.240]  and he becomes the violent person to say that if you don't any this is not new
[56:07.240 --> 56:11.040]  he's been doing this you know an environmental regular if Congress moves
[56:11.040 --> 56:14.840]  too slowly well I'll write an executive order but he didn't invent the executive
[56:14.840 --> 56:19.520]  order and assigning orders you know I'll ignore this it's it's a bipartisan
[56:19.520 --> 56:25.200]  accelerating and getting dictatorial that s our military orders us to turn
[56:25.200 --> 56:27.980]  our guns in doesn't that make him a dictator if he just says I'll do
[56:27.980 --> 56:33.480]  whatever I want well it's certainly the dictatorial move on that if the American
[56:33.480 --> 56:39.520]  people had been a little better versed maybe they wouldn't have reelected them
[56:39.520 --> 56:45.120]  so I do not say that he is a dictator like some of the 20th century dictators
[56:45.120 --> 56:50.200]  that killed 290 million people but these are dictatorial moves they're very very
[56:50.200 --> 56:55.800]  dangerous and people say to me why are you worried about you know the military
[56:55.800 --> 57:01.360]  arresting Americans citizens National Defense Authorization Act there's only
[57:01.360 --> 57:05.000]  one or two people were involved yeah but the principles 100% when you establish
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.480]  your pencil so what he's doing is perpetuating a principle of putting
[57:10.480 --> 57:14.000]  more power into the presidency and it's very very dangerous
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.800]  the president under NDAA we're almost out of time sir will you will you turn
[57:18.800 --> 57:25.680]  in your semi-autos well I might not even have anything to turn in for for that
[57:25.680 --> 57:30.840]  purpose but I don't think the American people will I've always assumed that the
[57:30.840 --> 57:36.480]  line in the sand may well be drawn if the federal agent marches in
[57:36.480 --> 57:40.720]  unannounced and they say well give me your gun and give me your gold I don't
[57:40.720 --> 57:46.240]  think they're there we'll do that you know come when I think the American
[57:46.240 --> 57:51.600]  people will highly resent it and I resist so you think I was right then
[57:51.600 --> 57:55.280]  telling piers Morgan if they try to confiscate the guns it will start 1776
[57:55.280 --> 57:59.600]  part two well I put them in the same words but I think I said something very
[57:59.600 --> 58:03.520]  similar to what you're saying well god bless you sir I hope we can get you back
[58:03.520 --> 58:07.360]  again in a month what are any other websites that are important to plug just

[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:30.560]  ladies and gentlemen if you just joined us former congressman Ron Paul was on
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:36.320]  the transmission and while he was on the news broke in the weekly standard and
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.520]  other publications that Joe Biden they said executive orders they're set to use
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:45.840]  executive orders to ban our guns and make us turn them in they've got 11
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.140]  different bills turned in to do background checks and huge federal taxes
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:53.100]  to buy ammo try to make you register ammo you already have I mean this is it
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:57.240]  and they're probably gonna stage some more shootings this has all the looks
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:02.400]  the last two Colorado and Sandy Hookup being partially are all staged and I
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.600]  told you they were on drugs that's all coming out and it's all weird government
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.840]  funding and bizarreness at every level so we're in a lot of trouble and and and
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:15.240]  a lot of people are gonna cower to the system and go along with it that's why
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.200]  it's such a dangerous shine that Glenn Beck well normally wouldn't even you
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:22.720]  know give attention here on air because I don't want to be in rivalries with
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:26.640]  people I mean I was watching last night cuz I was sent the clip with him and his
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:30.080]  sidekicks and they were just literally look scared and freaked out and said

[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:44.120]  TV on in thousands of newspapers it's like oh man great now I've really got to
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.320]  watch what I say I mean this is about defeating the globalist that's what I
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.960]  want I mean I wouldn't be up here putting it on the line calling for
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:56.080]  second American Revolution peacefully before it gets violent I said that
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.540]  because I can see they're gonna make their move we got to get real aggressive
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:03.040]  we're gonna lose it but Oh piers Morgan and Becker like don't be aggressive sit
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:07.600]  down and shut up they always tell constitutionalist libertarians what

[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.280]  shootings and folks are gonna look they're gonna be false flags I believe
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:23.760]  these are false flags they have all the earmarks we know Oklahoma City was here
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.800]  they go you say the government in Oklahoma City criminal elements they did

[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:37.340]  they did it to blame the Second Amendment and as Larry Pratt has said if
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:41.360]  they'd stage fast and furious they'd stage Aurora the president is going to
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.600]  act said Biden giving some comments to the press before a meeting with victims
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.880]  of gun violence there are executive orders there are executive action that
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.600]  can be taken yeah it's called dictatorship as Ron Paul said that's a
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:56.080]  dictatorial move we haven't decided what this is yet but we're compiling it with
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:59.560]  the help of the Attorney General and the rest of the cabinet members as well as
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:04.120]  legislative action that we believe is required it's critically important we
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.120]  act the president is going to act the president has said we're going to react
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:11.960]  and they're gonna go get this rubber stamp with it says the Attorney General
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:17.240]  and the task force as the president said we have got Holder scheduled for a
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.680]  meeting that's currently taking place in the White House and they're gonna wait
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:24.240]  till he gets inaugurated you watch and they're gonna drop a hammer on us
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:28.880]  they're gonna say all right if you get a letter from the ATF because they already
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.120]  do this to veterans we already know what they're gonna do you got to come into
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.240]  the ATF for an evaluation they're gonna make you do a psychological evaluation
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.060]  that's a total fraud we're gonna make you see a government psychiatrist it's
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.680]  gonna cost tens of billions of dollars they're gonna do it and they're gonna
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:46.520]  take your guns and they're gonna pick people that look kooky and act weird but
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:50.560]  who are law-abiding to kill and say well they deserve it they fire them a SWAT
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:54.240]  team and they're gonna attack police stations and blameless I mean this is
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:58.600]  these are guys that wrote memos during the last four years saying we need
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.340]  staged terror attacks to blame on libertarians conservatives and
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:04.840]  constitutionalists and Glenn Beck even to his credit before he left Fox said
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.860]  here's all their quotes about how they're gonna stage terror attacks and
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:12.200]  he said blame me ie Glenn Beck no they said they were gonna blame anti new world
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.400]  order people I mean they're saying they were gonna do this and blame us okay and
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:21.480]  a lot of folks are gonna decide to cower to this if you cower they fully take
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:25.520]  over I mean believe me it's not fun to get up here and me and these people's
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:37.120]  faces it's not fun but it's got to be done they're going for broke now that
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:41.240]  lots of threatening things got said to me while I was at CNN lots of little
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:43.920]  cryptic things and I didn't say all that on air because people wouldn't believe
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:50.760]  it I told you that yesterday I said I'm holding back I told you and I shot a
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.220]  video that night and I left New York to go to New Jersey where I was taking off
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:58.600]  in Newark and got like two hours sleep was I got to New Jersey because we had
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:03.280]  Planco's police in the hotel following us around we turned down a street a guy
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.160]  would step out you know all of his police I saw guns under there you know
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:10.480]  they were like oh were you doing how you doing I mean this was this was bad
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:15.640]  waiting for us at CNN waiting when we came out I mean it's super creepville
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.080]  like they were on a rabbit hunt or something and I you know lived to fight
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:22.920]  another day got out of there got out of Bloomberg's crime syndicate operation
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:27.640]  since then they're making cryptic comments about my family and my children
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:32.400]  being killed on Piers Morgan and I thought okay honey that's not a veiled
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.200]  threat let's wait and see but it was said creepily with a lot of relish and
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:41.360]  re-aired again on CNN and then they had the writer for the Daily Beast and it
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:46.480]  was clearly scripted say we need to have you kill Alex the next time you seem
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:52.200]  with a semi-auto you buy legally as if buying legally is what did it and then
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:58.480]  the daughter of Huntsman top globalist minion says ooh ooh yeah peers I want to
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.720]  see you do it in a uniform baby and peers is like I'll wear my brother's

[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:44.560]  pick up a gun and then they may be coming to kill me because that's the
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.680]  message they're sending that's what mafia's do they killed thousands of
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.600]  Mexicans hundreds of US citizens five police officers so pray for us but but
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:58.000]  if they kill me I was murdered okay if they kill me I was murdered and I've
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.760]  told you the last few months even before this happened I said something big is
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:06.000]  about to happen I can see the writing on the wall so pray for us ladies and
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.640]  gentlemen and again I've always had really bad cedar allergy it's gotten
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.760]  really bad so I've had like a lot of chest cold but when I went to New York
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:18.640]  and I can barely breathe when I came back I can barely breathe and stuff like
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.560]  Benadryl doesn't work I'm gonna have to go to the doctor since that's why I've
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.100]  sounded even more Clint Eastwood style with a voice because it's just
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:30.000]  completely shot and I really need to rest as well I am overwhelmed I'm not in
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:36.280]  fear I just love God and and and I'm sad for America I'm sad for my family I'm
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.920]  sad that it's come to this I know I'm right about what I'm saying and Piers
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.480]  Morgan Glenn Beck the entire media are saying I shouldn't be on the air and I'm
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:48.320]  dangerous and I want violence and none of that's true and and they're saying
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.440]  I'm a liar and then that I want to deceive people and all I ever wanted was
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:57.720]  freedom nothing more all I ever wanted was decency and honor yes I have a
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:01.240]  temper about bullies it's it's a hot button I don't bullies really get me
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:07.340]  upset and it's probably because I got beat up no exaggeration probably 50
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:11.120]  something times my bullies before I learned to fight back and now it's just
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:18.960]  instinctive I get really upset and that's why I blow up is because I'm not
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:23.960]  good at running and I knew these were police in New York and I had to swallow
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.660]  my prize a few times almost got in their faces and I thought no that's what they
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:35.440]  want so I got out of there but I never wanted to be the real leader of the
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:41.760]  Liberty movement Ron Paul is more more of a statesman but he's 76 77 now what
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:47.480]  is he 76 look up his age and unfortunately for all intensive purposes
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:51.480]  I am the leader because other people like Ted Nugent others they don't get
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:58.600]  the whole picture Rand Paul is such a statesman you know that he's just not
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:01.800]  really leading right now he should be all over the he should be all over the
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.560]  place climbing the walls trying to defend the Second Amendment right now
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:11.400]  like Ron Paul's doing and I'm not criticizing it was just now is the time
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:16.640]  to act Ron Paul 77 just had his birthday that's right a few months ago
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:22.360]  media wise Matt Drudge is the leader when it comes to getting the word out
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:27.000]  for whatever reasons is a focal point what I've called for they know that I've
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:33.960]  got the biggest audience and and and I am in grave danger and the weird thing
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:41.040]  is it doesn't scare me it's more like
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.720]  crossing a river it's it's it's it's actually peaceful in a way but very
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:52.240]  saddening that we are in the hands of criminals real criminals hardcore
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:56.000]  tyrants and if we don't come out and say they're trying to become dictators it's
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.800]  over we either back them down or it's over let's go to this clip here ladies
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.160]  and gentlemen let's go ahead and go to clip of Biden's ten they're going to use
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:12.200]  executive orders here it is executive orders executive action that can be
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:16.520]  taken we haven't decided what that is yet but we're compiling it all with help
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:21.680]  with the Attorney General and all the rest of the cabinet members as well as
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:27.240]  legislative action we believe is required so I appreciate you very much

[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:15.600]  of times and it's because I get hyped up about this I mean I know I'm right about
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:19.720]  it as more and more stuff comes true I'm just completely freaked out at my core
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:24.040]  and I'm flailing around trying to get people to wake up and get out of their
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:28.960]  coma and you know what it isn't pretty sometimes but it's effective and that's
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:36.760]  why the enemy's pulling out the stops against us and if they kill if any more
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:39.720]  gun because it's not just FPS Russian there's been some other deaths of
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:44.040]  prominent gun manufacturers that's why other gun manufacturers are like you
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.920]  know we're getting out of the business you know you said they're meeting with
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.800]  the NRA today telling them there's gonna be an executive order you get in line
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:57.600]  don't you thugs get it you could get 99% of gun owners to turn their guns in the
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:03.480]  1% is 1.5 million people it's a guaranteed civil war as Ron Paul said
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:08.400]  that doesn't mean I want one I'm the last person that wants one but Glenn
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.680]  Beck and CNN take out of context what I've said and say that I want a violent
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:18.960]  revolution and that's ahead of a setup so if I get killed I want investigations
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:24.840]  and I will never commit suicide but again he who's in us is greater than he
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:28.920]  who is in the world and I need your prayers folks I believe in it I know
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.440]  it's real people say well you're not a goody two-shoes Christian while you play
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.280]  rock and roll sometimes it's not about that I love God my heart loves God I
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:41.280]  know I'm like dirty rags to God but God knows I love innocence and beauty and
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:48.440]  decency okay and that's what matters and that's why they always attack those of
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.680]  us that have good hearts and say we're not for real because they're not for
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.880]  real
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:58.480]  now here's the clip which clip do we have first the guy going he helps my
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:03.400]  kids don't get killed on CNN yeah yeah yeah let's go to the Daily Beast
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:07.440]  go with Piers Morgan when they agree that that I need to be shot by Piers
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.840]  Morgan but they'll dress him up in a uniform so it's okay then Piers goes
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:14.400]  yeah I'll wear my brother's uniform now you people say it's a joke if I said
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:24.000]  kill ki double hockey sticks anybody with a gun I would be arrested and by
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.240]  the way I should be I said you break in my house I'm gonna kill you that's legal
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:32.840]  and lawful to say yeah I've said Piers Morgan anybody you know tries to lay a
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.440]  hand on me I'll defend myself that's different they they are fantasizing and
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.080]  I've been around these authoritarians that call themselves leftist how many
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:42.240]  times I told you I've been around them they'll come up to me when I've been at
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.080]  countless democratic events covering them and they'll say you know one day
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:48.760]  we're gonna kill you I'm like I thought you're a liberal yeah you know we're not
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:54.160]  I mean these people are demons okay I don't know how else to explain it to you
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.000]  and they can't control themselves if you're a radio listener you got to see
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:06.600]  this pig this guy on the show who is the writer Buzz Bissinger this darling of
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:12.880]  the left and him he looked when he talks about killing me he looks like he's
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:19.880]  about to have an orgasm I'm serious I mean these people these people are sick
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:26.320]  and that's why we have our guns Bissinger you understand that let's go
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:31.000]  and go to the club here it is but what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.960]  the only reason I think you needed is Pierce challenge Alex Jones to a boxing
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:39.760]  match show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop them I'd love to
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:47.120]  see that I don't think guns are more guns are the answer here I mean there
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:51.960]  are so she goes on to say yeah oh you wear a uniform then it's okay and then
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:55.320]  appears oh yeah I'll get my brothers so they're all agreeing yeah yeah let's
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:59.520]  kill Alex and that's a message just like they know if they said everybody go to
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:02.440]  this suit place they've got the best soup in town there'd be a line 50 feet
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:06.040]  long outside of it and everybody advertise if you're crazy go kill kids
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.960]  at schools nobody's there with guns to protect them then that becomes self
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:12.640]  fulfilling that's what advertisement is and they're on there saying and it's
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:17.880]  other shows too somebody ought to kill Alex Jones that's what they're saying
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:23.840]  and I had to run the gauntlet of their cops with guns getting in our faces the
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:28.480]  ten blocks up there out of there waiting for us all over us I came out and said I
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.600]  don't want to go out that I'm gonna go out the main entrance the guy goes with
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:34.960]  the security goes you're going out the front I go I know there's detectives out
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:37.480]  there getting our faces stuff and I think there's gonna be a bunch of me
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:41.520]  goes you're going out and that punk security guard you got his suit like he
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.640]  was FBI got off on he goes oh no you're going out that door and they were all

[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:53.160]  want I just went taxiing by the grace of God one was right there and we jumped at
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:56.080]  it and left and then they were at our hotel okay I don't know what they were

[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:47.840]  the NRA they say we killed the children they say it's our fault I guess we killed
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:51.720]  the people that died or been injured in that big ferry crash we got it we got a
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:55.160]  van ferries now bad things happen there's seven and a half billion people

[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:04.120]  poor dead shelter we pray for their families and then tell us we did it when
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:08.000]  they're the ones that made them victim disarmament zones and I told you they're
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.760]  going to use an executive order the ATF last year started telling gun shops what
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.020]  to do outside law and they told him hey don't argue when he's reelected we'll do
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:20.800]  whatever we want I talked to multiple gun show people in Tennessee in Arizona
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:24.840]  in California and Austin we broke that they were being given memos and they
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:28.360]  said well there's no law this law didn't pass they said well you do what we say
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:35.000]  we're gonna shut you down we found an eye that wasn't dotted literally and now
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.200]  when you go in to do your background it's all put in a computer it all go
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:40.760]  when you call the feds it's all computerized you're already registered
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:44.960]  they're now saying they're going to physically take the semi-autos like
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:49.060]  Diane Feinstein said mr. mrs. America get ready to turn your guns in that's a
[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:51.960]  quote and then Piers Morgan says I don't want your guns I just want you to turn
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:56.560]  all these in and then I get angry at him and then he says I'm dangerous I
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:59.440]  shouldn't have guns when I have no criminal record and then the next night
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.960]  last night and the man we're about to talk to he's scheduled to be under
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:08.360]  tonight Larry Pratt Piers Morgan doesn't have a big audience but when it's a gun
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:12.320]  debate it goes in all the other news and tens of millions probably a hundred
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:16.780]  million I mean this is the biggest story in the last two days is what I did with
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:20.880]  Piers Morgan and that wasn't my full plan it was part of it if he pulled bull
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:24.920]  I was gonna get his face because all he ever does is bully people so I gave him
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:29.160]  his own medicine back and put him on notice because I realized what Ron Paul
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:33.480]  said last hour he said the line in the sand is the guns there will be a
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:37.780]  revolution he agreed with me if they come to take the guns it will happen
[01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:42.440]  folks I don't want this to happen I'm not planning to physically resist I'm a
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:47.520]  media person I'm a general okay they're gonna use this to purge and persecute
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:51.360]  gun owners and it is going to be an unmitigated nightmare for police and
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:56.960]  military who even if you try to carry it out I mean it's a death sentence and the
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.800]  glow that's the globalist plan they've been preparing for this and police are
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:02.920]  like you're right if this happens it's gonna be horrible but they wouldn't dare
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:06.480]  yes they will and they're getting it ready for another executive order with
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:09.640]  the next mass shooting you know will happen with all their hyping and now we
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:13.200]  have them saying Larry I called you this morning to get you on when you were
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:17.400]  driving into work have you had a chance to see the CNN clip now where the host
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:22.280]  and his two guests talk about shooting me and agree it's okay as long as they
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:28.240]  wear a uniform Alec I haven't had a chance to even look at a clock non-stop
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:32.960]  but I'll tell you what you were just discussing this executive order that is
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:37.200]  something that I believe I might have even talked about on your show because
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:41.480]  you've been nice enough to have me on so many times but sometime well in the last
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:46.440]  year it occurred to me these guys don't have the votes in Congress and after the
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:49.880]  election it was clear they didn't have the votes in Congress for the next
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:54.960]  Congress either but Obama has shown by what he's done in other areas such as
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:59.440]  immigration he'll just bloody well do what he wants and issue an executive
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:05.440]  order against the law against the Constitution hey when you're socializing
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:10.440]  the country you know what's a few broken laws here and there they were they were
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:15.160]  only put on the books by a bunch of dead people that aren't here anymore it's our
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:19.840]  country now and I want it because I got elected and so I think he believes he
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:24.720]  might have been elected King although even the British King has far less power
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:31.680]  than what he's presuming but I saw what they would do if you assume the guy is
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:35.640]  lawless and you don't have to be a prophet and I'm not a prophet but I
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:41.280]  could see that that would be for him the course of least resistance that's where
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:47.520]  his water would flow if you will and he's doing it well I had Ron Paul on and
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:51.040]  he just heard me right basically paraphrase what he said he agreed that
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:55.280]  they're they want a civil war they know what they're doing if they think they're
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:59.360]  going to get 160 million gun owners to turn their guns in there will be a
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:05.160]  percentage that's not going to go along with it well it's very very very
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:14.080]  critical that if anything bad comes down that it'd be very clear that it was the
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:20.640]  government initiating violence remember Lexington and Concord that day's battle
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:25.400]  was started by the British because I think his name was Preston or Prescott
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:34.080]  the captain on Lexington green said hold your fire until until fired upon and if
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:37.600]  I recall correctly there were a couple of guys that died almost immediately
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.280]  following that order because the British did fire for quite a few of them but
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:48.400]  that gave them the high ground moral high ground and I think it's absolutely
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:56.440]  essential that that be that we hold our fire that we even be willing to perhaps
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:05.800]  be the first one down because we are in a war of ideas of monster culture clash
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:12.160]  and it's absolutely essential that we be perceived as the law abiding once as the
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:18.120]  lawful ones that we need to make it understandable that there are two kinds
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:23.760]  of rebels there's the rebel who goes out in the mountains on his own and is out
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:28.280]  there kind of like Robin Hood shooting people and then there's the rebel that
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:33.600]  comes with a badge if they're act if either one of them are acting outside
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:39.240]  the law that makes them a rebel and I know they the statists of our time can't
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:43.760]  get it through their head that they could be the rebels but the Constitution
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:49.560]  was put up to strictly limit what the federal government can do well that's
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:53.880]  profound what you said when Lenin took over and then Stalin they were rebels
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:59.000]  and they and they even call us counter revolutionaries that's what Bill Ayers
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.960]  and Obama in his training they know they're the rebels that's why they
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:07.960]  operate like this and are buying 1.6 million bullets and armored vehicles and
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:12.960]  demonizing real Americans because they are an occupying rebel enemy force
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:18.960]  against the Republic and you're absolutely right so we need to remember
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:24.680]  the Battle of Lexington that ultimately went very poorly for the British that
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:32.680]  day because our guys insisted that the moral high ground be theirs and that may
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:38.240]  take a lot more courage than would be needed to go and hide behind a rock and
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:43.240]  shoot which they did later in the day but to stand there at first naked
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:48.160]  against the British ball that was coming down at him out of those muskets that
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:53.440]  that was real courage but they knew why they were there and in fact their
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:59.360]  preacher had preached on that the Sunday before and he was there with him because
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:03.480]  he believed as much as they did what he'd been preaching about I believe he
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:08.280]  died I don't remember that but that's entirely possible because it was not a
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:12.800]  fun day for either side the British ultimately lost about a quarter to a
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:18.600]  third of their entire regiment that they sent out some 800 guys that many made it
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:25.360]  back and more importantly we were able to get to London ahead of the British
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:31.040]  couriers and point out what had happened and who had fired first and that it was
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:35.560]  this oppressive government that we've been hollering about for four and six
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:40.120]  years and formal petitions and petitions of rights bills of rights all those
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:45.720]  kinds of things we're going over to the British mainland being published in
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:51.780]  their newspapers and then it finally came to that and so I think we have to
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:55.680]  remember that history the history that's not being taught in our government
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:01.840]  schools sure but our forefathers did it right and god willing yes sir we'll do
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:05.360]  it right I can't believe we're to the point that we're having to talk about
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:10.880]  1775 1776 I mean this is this is not a joke and I had John a few weeks ago and
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:13.800]  I said from all I've seen this with the greatest assault ever and you said it's
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:18.640]  shaping up to be that undoubtedly now Larry Pratt of gun owners dot o-r-g this
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:24.680]  is clearly the greatest assault ever certainly in my lifetime if for a while
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:29.520]  I've been comparing it to Columbine but I'm beginning to think that they are
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:35.720]  much bolder than they were even back in Columbine and one of the guys here made
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:41.000]  a suggestion which I still think could well be the case and that is they've
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:46.560]  overreached what Diane Feinstein has proposed in her legislation is so far
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:54.520]  beyond what she excuse me got enacted in 94 that they're essentially with a few
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:59.520]  exceptions coming for it all her much-vaunted statement after she'd
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:06.640]  enacted her quote-unquote limited gun ban of 1994 was well I just didn't have
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:10.640]  the votes otherwise I'd have said mr. and mrs. America turn them all in well
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:16.680]  we know what her objectives are so we shouldn't be fooled she's told us and
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:22.360]  she's now indicating that she wants more now I think she's getting greedy and I
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.720]  think we can use that against her and god willing that's exactly what about an
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:31.640]  executive order I mean Congress has got to start impeachment now with just
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:38.120]  Biden and defunding without money guarantee Alex none of these Jaspers
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:44.040]  here inside the beltway our volunteers they're extremely well paid I'm sure
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:51.040]  that 99% of your listeners would love to have what this 1% that works here in the
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:59.880]  government class is being paid this is definitely something that can be solved
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:05.360]  partially by money if if we can get a get around the Speaker of the House who
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:11.480]  is like a downed tank blocking a bridge and if somehow we can build another
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:17.840]  bridge or get him off the bridge in some way then I think we could actually enact
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:22.960]  spending measure that had a proviso in it none of these funds may be used for
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:28.360]  the implementation of executive order whatever it might be sure go ahead
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:32.680]  they're out of gas at that point you have always again been a very measured
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:36.960]  calm person and I'm like that in private when I get wound up I get very very
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:40.160]  upset and you know did that with Piers Morgan because he's always been a bully
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:45.000]  I was not gonna let him bully me so I just you basically dominated him but I
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.480]  want to play you a clip here because this is what was said last night amongst
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:54.280]  other things they said they hope my children don't end up dead and and then
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:59.360]  there was this so I'm gonna play it for you now Piers Morgan and guests discuss
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:04.160]  shooting Alex Jones Daily Beast writer Buzz Bissinger says Piers Morgan should
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:09.920]  pop Alex Jones with a semi-automatic weapon then Huntsman's daughter Abby
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:13.840]  Huntsman of the Huffington Post says I'd love to see that laughter in a uniform
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:17.200]  Piers Morgan I'd borrow my brother's uniform who reportedly is an army
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:20.560]  officer so I guess if it's a uniform it's okay I want to play this clip and
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:25.680]  get your take on it here it is but what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:29.660]  the only reason I think you needed is Pierce challenge Alex Jones to a boxing
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:34.440]  match show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop them I'd love to
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:43.480]  see that I'll borrow my brother's uniform and then there was talk of
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.600]  I hope my children don't get killed I mean and this is entering a whole
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:52.540]  another level of people what they did there is reveal the heart of the
[01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:58.640]  leftist the leftist is about force they're about imposing their
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:04.840]  righteousness on us slubs that don't know what's good for us and it's such a
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:10.740]  delightful topic to talk about offing some loudmouth like Alex Jones that'll
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:16.400]  teach those bumpkins a thing or two won't it I guess it will my children
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:19.620]  were there watching when their deaths were being discussed I mean they're
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:23.040]  clearly trying to terrorize the entire American people with these shootings
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:26.320]  while they're horrible statistically it's one of the rarest forms of death
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:31.840]  right along with our general murder rate which is declining and I was just
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:35.960]  looking at something that happily if my son Eric pulled something up it's quite
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:41.000]  good there's an under reporting of murder data in England which has always
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.040]  held up as the country that's so wonderful compared to ours British crime
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:51.120]  I'm quoting from the finding reporting tactics keep murder rates artificially
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:55.720]  low and then this is a quote from a report from the inspect what of
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:00.680]  constabulary suppose that three men kill a woman during an argument outside of
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:04.040]  bar they are arrested for murder but because of problems with
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:08.600]  identification quote or a friend the main witness is dead charges are
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:12.440]  eventually dropped in American crime statistics the event counts as a
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:17.560]  three-person homicide but in British statistics it counts as nothing at all
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:23.640]  and then the report is quoted directly here with such differences this is
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:30.540]  British 2000 with such differences in reporting criteria comparisons of u.s.
[01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:37.620]  homicide rates with British homicide rates is a sham that's the British cop
[01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:42.000]  group the inspectorate of constabulary well can I have that headline cuz I've
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.680]  got the Telegraph and others admitting that they're the crime capital of Europe
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:51.240]  Switzerland has the lowest crime rate in the world because of course they have
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:56.120]  more guns but but you can just type in Britain or England the crime capital of
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:48:01.360]  Europe people are beat stabs you know but yeah I read all the time where if
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:05.120]  you fistfight someone raping your wife that busts in your house you they throw
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:08.920]  the book at you you know the farmer who'd been robbed three times defending
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:13.560]  himself and they threw him in prison I mean they probably give some condoms to
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:18.480]  the guy that was raping your wife and tell him to clean up his act amazing I
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:22.720]  know I mean but see that's on purpose they want that's a criminal government
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:26.160]  with trying to team up with the criminals why do they why do they love
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:31.440]  crime-ridden cities run by mafias well because we're then terrorized and we
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:36.600]  must depend all the more for our quote protection on the very authorities that
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:42.160]  have put us into that predicament to begin with and I don't know whether
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:46.000]  they're accepting it in England although it is as the Telegraph said two days
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.480]  after that Piers Morgan interview it is the third it is the fourth most violent
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:56.840]  country in the world violent crime which would include murder but also rape and
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:59.800]  everything else and that's what watered down numbers because I've seen those
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:03.000]  numbers before that they just let murder I mean they don't even investigate when
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.560]  they come to your house and you and your wife are chopped up I mean it's just
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:09.560]  like you could have the neighbor running around with a hand in their you know
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:14.400]  hand of a chopped off person they just say oh no big deal right they do not
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:19.640]  believe in self-defense that farmer it was infamous that up in the little town
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:25.560]  of Norfolk in England had after the like the third home invasion by the same
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:31.720]  gypsy gang members that had been terrorizing the whole area he shot one
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:35.640]  of them in the dark of night who was coming up the stairs actually shot both
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:39.760]  of them and killed one of them and for that they gave him a life sentence which
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:45.240]  now he's out of jail because happily British public opinion finally focused
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:50.280]  on that outrage and see see that's what scares me is that I'm a I'm still a
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:54.840]  young man 38 but I've got aches and pains and things and you know problems
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:50:01.480]  now from a you know life of action I can't imagine once I get old and all I
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:04.800]  can depend on is the gun I mean if two guys are coming up my stairs I'm gonna
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:08.080]  get so angry even if they're pretty tough I can probably deal with them but
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:14.240]  not when I'm 65 70 I need that firearm and more and more now you know I mean
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:18.720]  as I get older by more and more I try to avoid physical stuff it's just natural
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:25.400]  we need to equalize things for for the infirm the old the women handicap I mean
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:33.040]  the real liberal thing to do is to arm women exactly exactly and to make it so
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:38.440]  that unarmed children can be protected by their teachers the janitors whatever
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:44.960]  and schools rather than insist for now 20 years that if we just say no guns at
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:47.920]  schools everything will be fine well everything is not fine that's where most
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:52.480]  of our men in fact that's where all of our mass murders have occurred in
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:56.000]  whatever kind of gun I hope you can get that out tonight with Piers Morgan's
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.200]  five more minutes with our guests on the other side gun owners out org is Larry

[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:23.280]  Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:27.840]  deadly threat I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this it may
[01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:30.720]  be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up

[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.800]  don't feel like I'm putting the words into it properly how big of a deal is it
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:39.840]  with with Biden saying don't worry they'll be executive orders and we're
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:43.600]  going to take the recommendation of Attorney General Eric Holder who's the
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:48.280]  fast and furious architect I mean why we need to bring that up when he earlier
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:54.000]  had said even before he made it clear that they would go executive order but
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.680]  two three four days ago sometime last week maybe it was sent to some anti-gun
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:05.520]  group we're gonna have gun control by the end of January well wait a minute
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:10.120]  the Congress couldn't even vote to adjourn for an ice cream social that
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:15.040]  fast I mean it's just come on it's not gonna happen then that just reinforces
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:19.080]  what you and I've been talking about clearly they're gonna go executive order
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:28.960]  against us and so what Biden is is up to is setting the stage for this very act
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:35.240]  of lawlessness and for them to talk about offing you I've just found that on
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:39.240]  your page and it's great that you've got it there I think people ought to go to
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:45.160]  your info wars calm and this is what needs to be this needs to go viral
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:52.480]  people need to see that the left it's sort of like Che Guevara the Cuban
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:59.640]  executioner for Fidel Castro he was literally the chief executioner and he
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:04.800]  would have people executed even during breakfast time well he he wanted to see
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:12.040]  that so he had a wall cut out of his office onto the body long onto the
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:16.120]  shooting wall so that he could see the executions of the men women and children
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:21.120]  taking place and he would have his breakfast you know while all of this
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:25.960]  blood was flowing from those horrible people and that's the that's the tone
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:31.880]  that I get that way what you were being subjected to was the Tata Che Guevara
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:36.120]  had it right you know you know I also pulled up the quotes he even wrote
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:39.720]  papers that are public he actually it's not propaganda he called Mexicans sub
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:45.200]  humans he called poor Indians sub humans he called him trash he said who it
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:51.280]  quotes who cares how many brown people die and and then I see Hispanics wearing
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:55.920]  his shirt everywhere and he said they were animals I mean people just have no
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:57:00.040]  idea that these communists are a bunch of elitists that like to kill people and
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:05.640]  typically are the biggest races in history it's the status who like to pick
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:11.440]  on a target population a minority population and of course in our country
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:17.080]  that would be black or Mexican or somebody like that it's not the right
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:24.280]  that is out making fun of or even threatening minority population we're
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:27.940]  the ones that are talking about empowerment we're the ones that are

[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:40.320]  executive order I predict that does a few unconstitutional things to set the
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:44.160]  precedent so people don't fight it too hard and then there'll be another mass
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:48.600]  shooting that they stage are allowed to happen or wind up what I call a wind-up
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:52.760]  toy get a mentally ill person profile them and send them out

[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:35.800]  I wish his source wasn't real mm-hmm and he said the plan is a total takeover and
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:39.280]  they're gonna use the NDAA to do it I'm not trying to scare people if we don't
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:43.240]  talk about this is gonna happen and I've already got plainclothes cops all over

[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:21.040]  and he said I can't be trusted not bad definitely trying because he knows I'm
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:24.960]  getting on more and more radio stations to inoculate his listeners and people to
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:33.400]  not listen to the show because we're effective folks and Glenn I'm not trying

[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:54.200]  first hour I never got up and said there weren't FEMA camps and then put lies out
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:59.440]  he said that they're they didn't buy 1.6 billion bullets I said my gosh I can't
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:03.080]  believe he's doing that it's well known it's national mainstream news after we
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:07.520]  broke it at the end he said now I may be wrong about all this check it out for

[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:57.080]  sanity to be killed I'm talking about my kids on air cryptically I got so much
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:00.240]  stuff going on and then and then I see this clip and I couldn't even watch it
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:06.200]  all and then I thought it suppose he went on for hours just how I'm this evil
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:11.760]  fascist that's a quote and how I'm Van Jones and all this stuff and how I lie I
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:17.320]  don't lie about 9-eleven I said we don't know exactly what happened there we just
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:21.160]  know that the government left the hijackers in and that's been declassified
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:26.040]  mainstream news look it up Michael Springman with a whistle and there were
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:29.880]  drills of the same thing happening that day and I said it's going to be used to
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:33.760]  build Homeland Security to go after constitutionalist because that was
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:37.320]  always the plan and now it's happened I saw what's sad about this I saw a clip
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:41.560]  and I'll go to your calls I saw a clip of Glenn Beck because I don't watch a
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:45.760]  show I'm too busy but sometimes I see clips online and I even meant to play it
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:48.920]  on air last week never got around to it most stuff I give to him we never even
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:54.480]  get to and he was talking about how Obama runs al-qaeda and they're killing
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:58.920]  people in Libya and Syria it was back in October and now he killed the ambassador
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:02.360]  to cover something up and how the Turkish ambassador was there to get the
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:06.040]  missiles and of course it was what we'd all broken a long time ago and put in
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:09.760]  the news you know we we forced it out there and then now mainstream news is
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:14.160]  covering it and I was like wow he's saying the
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:18.720]  government runs al-qaeda the hijacked government that that's what I said 11
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:25.200]  years ago I mean it's a fact bud and he says he's un-American he says that the
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:28.760]  US government blew up the towers
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:33.240]  there are all sites all sorts of parasites that get inside animals you
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:39.000]  know if tapeworms are in a dog's stomach I don't go to the dog and and poison it
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:43.720]  and say the dog is a tapeworm the US government is full of tapeworms okay
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:48.120]  tapeworms in the government did this I mean can you get that I know you get
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:52.320]  that but you think your audience is stupid and see I don't think people are
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:59.760]  stupid let's play the clip one more time if you

[02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:03.600]  Jared and Texas you're on the air go ahead I was a curious if certain guns
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:08.360]  are outlawed how do you think that they'll they'll confiscate them like did
[02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:10.760]  you think that the government's physically going to come to people's
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:15.520]  houses but they know have these guns no not in phase one they're going and I
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:17.680]  already knew they do this but I've talked to my sources what the training
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:20.920]  is they're gonna set up gang checkpoints on the highway it's already begun all
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:24.160]  over the country federally funded totally illegal martial law checkpoint
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:28.000]  it'd be martial law slowly implemented and then they'll say we got a record you
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.040]  got these firearms you'll be like huh you know half the time you know how many
[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:34.680]  guns you bought how many years ago you know or who you sold to a buddy or what
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:38.720]  you traded and then and then you'll be like oh yeah I got some guns well
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:42.200]  doctor all right let's get you out of that vehicle and take you on and I got
[02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:45.000]  you admitting you got those guns and then they're gonna serve a search warrant
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.920]  on your house that's and then they're gonna you know take down everything on
[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:52.760]  your computer plant stuff on you whatever that's the new culture and all
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:55.580]  the crime labs all the big ones have been caught framing people and then
[02:17:55.580 --> 02:18:00.280]  they'll tell you we're gonna you plea bargain on this and you know all right
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:03.920]  we want you to work as a spy now and other gun owners and that's just how it
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:07.520]  works and it's targeting us for political persecution like Jews and
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:13.240]  Nazi Germany or or or free market people in Russia and maybe this is their
[02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:16.520]  takeover this is what it's gonna look like and it's a way to go after
[02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:20.460]  everybody and then they'll pick like Mormon break-off groups they think they
[02:18:20.460 --> 02:18:24.280]  can demonize or groups like the Davidians and they're gonna go out and
[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:28.040]  blow up their churches burn them down and and say look you're gonna die if you
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:33.360]  don't turn your guns in and so that'll be their plan and then people will start
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:37.200]  fighting back it's guaranteed Ron Paul agreed in the first hour and we're not
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:40.760]  happy we need to stop that and then the Civil War will begin and they're just
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:44.520]  gonna say we're going after everybody and and so that's that's what they're
[02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:48.720]  planning is that answer your question yeah but I also do you think that
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:52.640]  that'll be local law enforcement as far as you know sheriff absolutely they've
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:56.600]  got it multi-jurisdictional SWAT team people who've been profiled and been
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:18:59.600]  found that they'll do whatever they're told some will be criminals in the force
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:03.560]  summer just totally do right to do whatever they're told others will do it
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:07.280]  for the paycheck and then the rest will all be on a patrol right and take us a
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:12.720]  little old ladies and that's already set up they're already doing the training
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:16.320]  nationwide they told them be ready in the next two months to begin highway
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:19.200]  checkpoints and they've already started the highway checkpoints but and they're
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:23.080]  already going through cars and taking your guns and you know they'll
[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:29.400]  selectively you know well Alex Jones has semi-autos he didn't turn in and you
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:34.120]  know come SWAT team me and you know say I made a wrong move I mean you know
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:37.440]  it'll be a big bag I mean you know that's what men do is they kill American
[02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:41.120]  Patriots and it'll be like man I killed a grizzly bear look I got the big
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:45.080]  Patriot look at him look at him we shot him five times look at him flop around
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:50.080]  while I'm bleeding out on the ground that's how they work that's how they
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:54.200]  stomp your brains out like Nazi Germany tell they take your wives and break
[02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:58.440]  their noses and that's what they want to do and put your kids in forced labor
[02:19:58.440 --> 02:20:03.360]  camps they're not gonna get away with it looking back on 2012 we asked ourselves

[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:30.880]  again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:35.640]  actually strive to do the deeds who knows the great enthusiasms the great
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:42.080]  devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:46.880]  the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst of it if he fails at least
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:52.880]  fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:59.080]  timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat Teddy Roosevelt said that in a

[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:14.560]  man in the arena and that is where this will lead drones secret arrest torture
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:18.560]  that's already on the books they're trying the police for it I wanted to
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:24.640]  debate Alan Dershowitz who says that whoever they want they should be able to
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:28.240]  grab and torture people like that is liberal that is a good idea if the
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:30.960]  government's real just disappear you kill your torture and people like man
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:34.480]  that's liberal yeah that Alex Jones he's dangerous we need to get his guns on the
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:38.880]  government he's guns so we can torture and kill you well that's liberal they're
[02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:41.440]  like and then the next night they're like yeah we ought to kill Alex Jones
[02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:48.160]  yeah I'd be really fun to kill him hey they're on power trips let's go to
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:52.200]  secrets of the Fed in New Jersey go ahead thanks for holding
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:57.360]  hey Alex thanks for taking my call I wanted to go into a couple solutions
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:01.360]  people always are on here criticizing you that you don't give solutions which
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:05.360]  really I just said Congress needs to start impeachment now or needs to say
[02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:09.360]  you can't sign executive orders taking guns all I give is solutions that's
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:14.240]  armchair quarterbacks bitching that I'm in the arena go ahead oh look I agree
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:18.040]  with you and it's funny that you just had that quote from Roosevelt my father
[02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:21.560]  actually had bought that for me when I was a child and it hung on my wall when
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:25.960]  I was growing up but the point is is that the solutions is the information
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:30.680]  it's up to the listeners to go out and do something with it for instance my
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:34.960]  friends and I you know we're listeners and we decided we needed to take action
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:38.600]  we started a Facebook page we started a website we've got a hundred and forty
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:42.720]  thousand people on our Facebook page we started this website four months ago
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:47.560]  we've got 91,000 hits on our website yesterday and I'm nobody I'm just some
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:52.720]  guy you go engage the enemy exactly and I'm gonna say this if they shut me up
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:57.200]  who's gonna take my place I don't care if they end up destroying me I'm not
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:01.720]  happy about it but I I'm committed I want you guys to know your leaders
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:06.520]  exactly we've got to be these are these are not boss hogs that just want to run
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:10.760]  things these are killers don't people if you like I know they're killers we
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:17.560]  better bend over no no no they want to gut this country I'm sorry go ahead no
[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:21.580]  you're absolutely right and the point is is that every piece of information is a
[02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:25.600]  bullet and unless you go out there and use that bullet the information you know
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:30.400]  this is metaphor here but unless you go out and use that information and pass it
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:34.440]  along it's worthless these this is the tools either you're gonna end up
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:39.000]  spreading information now or shedding blood later so it's up to us to go out
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.680]  and do that beyond that when it comes to guns the solution is very simple I
[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:48.400]  remember I brought home my first pistol the 357 Magnum I showed it to my wife
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:52.640]  and she got so scared she went and hid behind the door little did she know that
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:57.000]  the door wasn't gonna do much the block at 357 but she was terrified of the
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:00.880]  thing so I brought her to the range and next thing you know her Facebook picture
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:04.840]  is her at the range people enjoy shooting and there's a hundred and
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:09.320]  sixty million of us if we convert one more person we win that's why they want
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:13.060]  them now that's why they had to advertise the schools as the places to
[02:28:13.060 --> 02:28:15.720]  kill people and use their Prozac heads to do it
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:20.840]  yep next time you go to the range bring someone who is on a fence about guns for
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:25.680]  someone who's never shot a gun before and I guarantee you 99% of those people
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:29.000]  are gonna be enthusiasts and ask you when look look how they try to convert
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:32.740]  people to communism and collectivism to get them under their control we've got
[02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:36.800]  to convert them to liberty god bless you great points my friend let's talk to

[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:16.440]  they said I should be killed not only said that but they said you were
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:23.400]  basically crazy and all your listeners were too it's amazing and then they said
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:27.160]  that I said Bush was responsible for 9-eleven and I said criminal elements

[02:36:13.840 --> 02:36:19.040]  everything we do for over a decade he rips off and copies and that's why he's
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:22.640]  always been trying to keep me off Fox I found out he'd want me on there when I
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:26.480]  came to be a guest once he's throwing a fit that was told by other Fox host oh
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:29.600]  my gosh Glenn Beck tells people he won't have on the show that you know you
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:33.520]  shouldn't go on his show I mean he goes around to everybody I even know the
[02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:37.520]  names of prominent people who've told me this and if Beck ever challenges me you
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:40.260]  know some of them didn't even say I couldn't say it but I still haven't I
[02:36:40.260 --> 02:36:44.680]  don't want to create a controversy I don't sit up here speaking of that the
[02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:49.200]  point is get a prison planet on TV membership I don't get up here and in an
[02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:56.840]  attack Glenn Beck except that when I have seen things like him come out and
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:37:00.520]  say I FEMA camps are real I'm gonna expose them this is three years ago and
[02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:04.840]  then what that guy's always said they don't exist and I predicted and I waited
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:08.080]  till a few days before so that so so wouldn't be me shaping their show
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:11.640]  because I knew from insiders he had like five guys watching everything I do but
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:15.720]  you go to his website it's our stories rewritten I mean most of them I mean
[02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:20.360]  what he charges for his online TV what he does the truth lives here all of it
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:25.600]  and then I've talked to the insiders I've talked to multiple people over and
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:30.720]  over again about man Glenn Beck done like you sponsors everybody I mean he
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:35.120]  rush Limbaugh isn't out to get me Michael Savage isn't out to get me I
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:38.880]  mean I wish them well I don't agree with everything they say or do but they're at
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:41.920]  least pro-gun and you know constitutionalists at some level I mean
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:46.840]  I I'm not but I found out Glenn Beck would do stuff like he admits this like
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:50.480]  call up the other shock jock when he was a liberal talk show host you have 15
[02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:54.440]  years ago or so and say I'm glad your wife had a miscarriage I read those
[02:37:54.440 --> 02:38:00.240]  reports and just really nasty stuff I mean he's a demon he's a demon and the
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:02.800]  thing is he covers a lot of good stuff he's gotten better over the years so
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:07.160]  every time I wanna I saw him in a video last week saying the government runs
[02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:10.560]  al-qaeda in Libya and Syria and it's horrible well I mean yeah we know that
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:13.680]  we've been saying it for two years then he says I'm a traitor because I say
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:16.480]  elements of the government run al-qaeda and I have all these historians and
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:22.520]  experts on and then I hate America and then I'm a fascist and and just on and
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:25.600]  on and on and the issue is my uncle said I don't want to hear about Glenn Beck
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:30.520]  ever again I can't stand him well he moved to Texas he goes around all the
[02:38:30.520 --> 02:38:35.400]  people I get on my show that live here in Texas and talks trash about me it's
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:39.680]  just ongoing and I'm sick of it and now he knows we're gaining all these
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:44.440]  affiliates as he loses affiliates we're rising while he's falling which I don't
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:47.320]  he's got hundreds of millions of dollars he'll be able to reach people in TV but
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:51.160]  he's announced I'm the libertarian leader I'm the libertarian talk shows I'm
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:55.000]  the cutting edge I've got reporters all over the world like we do I've got the
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:00.480]  reporters I and it's my my model which I haven't had the time or energy to even
[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:05.200]  fully deploy and I'm watching this guy who who rips me off for everything and I
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:08.880]  wouldn't care if he was a good guy because the necessities the mother of
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:13.920]  invention the greatest form of flattery is imitation I wouldn't care if it
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:18.920]  wasn't so personal and if he didn't do dirty tricks constantly and edit what I
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:25.160]  say and misconstrue and do horrible things and if he wasn't that cynical
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:30.040]  fake snot nose type like Piers Morgan who is into how they're smart and you're
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:35.240]  dumb and they're manipulating and then he says I'm doing that buddy I got a
[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:37.840]  good brain about the world works but there's not a bunch of calculation once
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:41.240]  I decide what direction I'm going I'm more like a rhinoceros so don't sit
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:46.560]  there and claim I'm some oily shifty person I make mistakes but they're not
[02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:49.320]  on purpose you say I'm not a conservative you're right I'm a
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:51.800]  constitutionalist because the word conservative doesn't mean anything
[02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:56.760]  today means Mitt Romney okay I'm not that you know they say I'm so right-wing
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:40:01.560]  I'm left all this baloney man I'm for justice I'm against killing kids with
[02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:04.720]  drones who are innocent I'm against warrantless wiretapping the left claim
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:07.080]  they were all against that when they're all part of the same thing to get into
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:13.080]  power I realize that too so when Bush is in I'm called a communist and when
[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:16.880]  Obama's in I'm called a right-winger or a fascist and Beck said almost exactly
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:20.800]  what Piers Morgan said I'm dangerous it's bad I have a big audience on and on
[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:25.840]  and on after saying I had no audience and he said that I was lying about 1.6
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:29.680]  million bullets but then at the end he went now I may be wrong about all this
[02:40:29.680 --> 02:40:33.680]  you can see the little guy's been talking to lawyers better check out what
[02:40:33.680 --> 02:40:38.400]  I said man that that's like this is a work of fiction you know I say check out
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:41.920]  what I said to see it for yourself don't just believe me that's my old saying
[02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:45.640]  that he says all the time just it's like listening to myself but twisted he takes
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:48.520]  he admits it too by the way they talked to insiders was in the New York Magazine
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:53.480]  article Oprah Winfrey Alex Jones it's kind of a fusion of those two fake
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:57.320]  emotionalism and let me tell you why I know Glenn Beck's really bad because
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:00.320]  again he's going after me to tell his audience don't listen to him he's
[02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:05.600]  dangerous he's bad I'll tell you why he's doing this because he's so cynical
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:10.680]  and so worldly and so and I hope he's got a good side every time I hope I just
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:16.680]  see the nastiness that he said he was going blind for macular degeneration I've
[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:22.280]  had dr. Blaylock all these brain surgeons neurosurgeons optometrist on that
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:25.560]  aspartame is what alcohol based it breaks down into that what alcohol makes
[02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:30.880]  go blind it causes macular degeneration starts dissolving the cornea and the
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:34.680]  nerve connections and so I wrote an article saying hey Glenn you're asking
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:38.280]  for sympathy and you're out you know at this at this rehabilitation center for
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:42.080]  weeks and all this I said I said Glenn man stop drinking Diet Coke I see you
[02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:47.080]  every time on your show with one he makes a big deal out of it and he
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:50.360]  attacked me and told me I was a joke and scum I mean look Glenn Beck knows that's
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:54.760]  bad he talks about eugenics no one talked about that I put it on the map
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:59.280]  I'm not even proud of that I'm just trying to warn people so in a way it's
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:03.160]  good he's ripping us off them but the problem is he's doing it so he can
[02:42:03.160 --> 02:42:08.000]  control the movement and be a gatekeeper that's the issue and he's doing it at a
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:12.160]  time when the enemy is coming against me and calling for me to be shot on CNN
[02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:16.640]  last night and I'm being followed around by folks and harassed I mean folks I'm
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:20.840]  Alex Jones we even got some video do show to these guys going like this and
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:23.680]  turning up against walls when we come by I mean all over the place you walk in
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:26.840]  the hotel there they are it's like what in Hades is going on I mean I got I mean
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:33.680]  this is real they're on TV saying ought to be shot and this guy doesn't even
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:37.080]  want me to say when Drudge Matt Drudge and he had a story yesterday about the
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:41.760]  EU documenting it's killing people and make them go blind and how they may ban
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:45.200]  it actually something reasonable going on even though they use a tyranny some
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:48.400]  of their bureaucrats know it's really bad it's in most products down since
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:54.120]  over 10,000 I know of and to make a long story short here Drudge had another
[02:42:54.120 --> 02:42:57.160]  story up yesterday just warning people just hey oh by the way look they're
[02:42:57.160 --> 02:43:00.000]  admitting this is hurting you just a normal thing hey by the way don't drink
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:05.520]  antifreeze I mean it's it's it's it's spiritual sickness and again people are
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:08.760]  always sending emails or comments get team up with Glenn Beck and I don't try
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:12.280]  to say anything about him because I know because I get I hear from listeners
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:17.040]  every week or so he's making stine remarks and you know it doesn't get to
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:25.000]  me in an ego level it hurts me to know that he is to take over
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:32.160]  that's his job is to be the Patriot he's the guy we're all supposed to go to and
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:37.400]  I just hope if something happens to me folks that other leaders stand up and
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:39.800]  spring up and are out there that's what I try to do with reporters and others
[02:43:39.800 --> 02:43:45.280]  that are here is that is that we just can't let them have these Judas coats
[02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:47.960]  and you can look at anybody and say hey they're a Judas coat they're a Judas
[02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:50.920]  coat I've been accused of that but with Glenn Beck man I mean he said Ron Paul
[02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:54.400]  supporters want to blow up buildings and the army should be used against him if
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:57.920]  you're like I never heard that just search it you'll use the army on on on
[02:43:57.920 --> 02:44:01.520]  Ron Paul supporters or Ron Paul says he's a demagogue I mean at key points
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:04.320]  when he was about to win primaries he came out and said Ron Paul people are
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:09.000]  liberals they want to blow up buildings like Oklahoma City I mean and he's just
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:15.160]  really duplicitous and now he says he is Ron Paul and he's our leader well I'm
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:18.040]  not your leader and neither is Glenn Beck you've got to be your leader to
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:21.720]  turn this around Jakari Jackson we've got this clip that I mean tell us your
[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:26.120]  view on this because you were talking about this morning and you could break
[02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:29.280]  down the video clip what's your take on this and tell us what clips coming up
[02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:33.680]  here the clip from the Glenn Beck show I don't normally watch Glenn Beck guys
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:38.080]  here at the office said hey check this out and so I took a look at it and it's
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:41.960]  like so I never watched the show but it's what I expected to see it's just
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:46.480]  Alex Jones is bad he talked about your your visit on Pierce Morgan and they
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:50.000]  said here's this guy Alex Jones going on Pierce Morgan the first they didn't want
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:53.440]  to mention you by name then one the guy slipped up said Alex Jones you know
[02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:58.400]  Glenn Beck was referring you to another guy that crazy guy that fascist that
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:02.980]  that whatever this guy who shreds the Constitution or something to this
[02:45:02.980 --> 02:45:07.920]  deceiver yeah he stands on a mountain of lies and says he's pro-constitution and
[02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:12.880]  he says he's you know debunked FEMA camps and all these other things you
[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:17.600]  know forgot to put you know we have all the bills we have all this the name of
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:21.240]  it civilian inmate labor camp program model states health emergency powers act
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:27.620]  civilian internment of facilities the emergency internment facilities the
[02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:31.880]  executive orders the army manuals right and I sent all that kind of stuff to him
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:36.240]  during his month-long investigation three years ago right but it's it's a
[02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:40.120]  hit piece you know people do what they do and you know he had his guys they
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:42.860]  with them they're laughing about you know you and how you hang out with
[02:45:42.860 --> 02:45:46.920]  Charlie Sheen one of the guys try to do Alex impression and actually you know I
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:49.760]  guess he was saying he want to have some type of sex well well well they didn't
[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:52.920]  say it well they've said before that I've yeah I must have you know I've
[02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:55.880]  been doing something in the shower which is obvious I could own them for that but
[02:45:55.880 --> 02:45:59.320]  whatever and the point is I knew Charlie Sheen before he went back into drugs
[02:45:59.320 --> 02:46:02.920]  he'd been off drugs for over a decade right really smart guy and I went out to
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:06.080]  LA quite a bit you know but to be on TV shows and stuff and I just got you know
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:09.520]  obviously I went out there when he was getting off drugs he was pretty wild the
[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:12.600]  media was saying he didn't go to the hospital for hernia and I had seen him
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:15.560]  when he'd come back from surgery right he'd been out swimming I said man I've
[02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:19.220]  seen you you know I've seen your hernia then they go yeah in the shower with him
[02:46:19.220 --> 02:46:24.360]  having sex you know they didn't say this yesterday they said it before and again
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:31.840]  this is the type of bizarreness that that goes on from these people let's go
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:35.480]  ahead and play did you get it all in there where I'm a fascist and all this
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:38.160]  oh yeah it's about a minute long but I think I got everything in there that
[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:41.360]  they said okay let's go ahead and go to that clip right now here it is
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:48.480]  Piers Morgan whose clear agenda is gun control and watch his face whose whose
[02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:55.280]  clear agenda is the government is out of control which it is Alex Jones is using
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:46:59.440]  this so he can be more popular and more people will talk about him so now they
[02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:05.360]  immediately books the madman this is how they like every tea party or to seem
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:12.480]  like that guy the screaming moron the fat moron I think is psycho I don't know
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:20.080]  what he is except a conspiracy theorist you cannot say I'm for the Constitution
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:26.160]  and and and declare it standing on a mountain of deceit that sounds like the
[02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:32.920]  ravings of a fascist I'm not the FEMA camp guy this guy's a real day wow this
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:38.800]  is the guy who was convincing 50% of Democrats that George W Bush was
[02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:42.040]  responsible for bringing down the World Trade Center and if you don't agree with
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:47.000]  him you don't just you don't just disagree you're in on it he is he is a
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:55.360]  really he's a really spooky guy you know I'm somebody who's been spooked by evil
[02:47:55.360 --> 02:47:58.920]  and who's standing up as best I can and just asking God to give me guidance and
[02:47:58.920 --> 02:48:04.420]  I'm it I'm in the arena and Glenn you were a liberal shock jock guy that had
[02:48:04.420 --> 02:48:07.240]  wars with all the other talk shows in every city you were in you've you've
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:11.760]  admitted it but I'm not in some war with you bud okay I want to try to be a
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:16.440]  friend but I've watched you I've been told man Glenn Beck doesn't tells people
[02:48:16.440 --> 02:48:19.800]  that he won't have him on if they ever have you on and you're told this four or
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:23.560]  five times and then you Garrett Fox and they go Glenn Beck's throwing a fit you
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:29.640]  can't come on interesting that he just like Piers Morgan did it wasn't about
[02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:33.200]  the issues it wasn't about the things you're talking about like the the 1.6
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:36.960]  billion bullets it's that Alex Jones said it and we didn't have time to put
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:40.720]  it in that clip but he says if you got your dad story from info Wars it must
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:44.480]  not be true that there's 1.6 billion bullets being bought by the government
[02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:48.200]  and so on same thing when Piers Morgan you know he has you on the show and it's
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:52.440]  not about you know gun rights and this and that it's about being deported which
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:57.560]  you know yeah that is something you are a part of but the larger issue is gun
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:00.960]  rights in this country and he completely ignores and just why do you want to
[02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:04.280]  deport me why do you want to deport me and even said it at the beginning of the
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:07.280]  interview with Pierce we got a bunch of foreigners telling us what to do nobody
[02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:10.520]  put up with this right obviously you're not getting deported I told him that
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:13.720]  before the show I said nobody's gonna deport you it's to point out you're here
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:16.480]  telling us what to do and nobody else would put up with that and he goes back
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:20.420]  into it on the show but the my issue is if you watch the whole clip of them they
[02:49:20.420 --> 02:49:26.480]  are freaked out and upset that I'm in the media right and and and again this
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:30.560]  isn't some big breakthrough for us this is a great time of danger we already had
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:33.380]  a giant audience when Piers Morgan goes you have a huge audience you have too
[02:49:33.380 --> 02:49:36.720]  much power you're dangerous Glenn Beck says the exact same thing right you said
[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:41.220]  George Bush blew this up when I said government knew about it government
[02:49:41.220 --> 02:49:44.480]  opened the doors for these people governments running Al-Qaeda today Glenn
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:48.040]  I mean I should get an apology from Glenn Beck but they're trying to get
[02:49:48.040 --> 02:49:51.360]  conservatives to hear me and go well everything he says must be bad because
[02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:55.120]  if we get aggressive we win notice how the so-called left is always aggressive
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:58.920]  with us right but then we're not supposed to go hey man stop lying and
[02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:02.040]  saying you know what my guns the bills are introduced Morgan right just when
[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:05.520]  Pierce Morgan he had Larry Pratt on he was yelling at him called him stupid and
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:08.760]  all this and that and when he's you know when you're there he's sitting there all
[02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:12.520]  all calm and collected then the next night he's like oh I just let Alex Jones
[02:50:12.520 --> 02:50:16.960]  make fun of me and and yell at me and stuff and even I had to make a joke
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:20.720]  about it last night when I did the the intro for the tonight the the nightly
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:24.140]  news show and I said that appears Morgan's master strategy was to sit
[02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:28.000]  there while you threw facts at him and say nothing you know that was his master
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:31.760]  strategy and then the next I said of course once you're gone you're back here
[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:36.180]  in Texas then he comes out Alex Jones this and Alex Jones that well what's

[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:17.320]  what we do here what what this is this is this is real this is that came out
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:20.040]  three weeks before it all started I said this is you're coming for our guns and
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:23.640]  we've been telling people forever that that they want your guns that Obama
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:28.360]  wants your guns but you know even though he's saying it in debates in these
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:32.240]  different forms people didn't want to believe it and now it's coming all out
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:36.640]  and it's now it's that shift it was they're not coming for your guns and now
[02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:39.440]  you shouldn't care that they're coming for your gun we're gonna kill Alex but
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:42.680]  that's nice too yeah that's perfectly fine well I mean they're always talking
[02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:45.440]  about how they want to put us in forced labor camps and stuff right
[02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:50.000]  Belafonte is like well what else can Obama do put his detractors in camps I
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:53.960]  mean and then I've got the bills and I've got the the orders and that's like
[02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:57.800]  that doesn't exist Alex is bad I'm willing to come up here folks and tell

[03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:38.000]  announcement you heard go ahead thanks Alex for taking my call again yeah
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:43.360]  yesterday on a local radio station here in Virginia they did a PSA from FEMA and
[03:00:43.360 --> 03:00:48.400]  it kind of concerned me a little bit because of listening to your show
[03:00:48.400 --> 03:00:53.120]  basically they said they put out a few points that we all should have three
[03:00:53.120 --> 03:00:59.560]  days of water and food duct tape and plastic to seal doors and windows and
[03:00:59.560 --> 03:01:04.000]  some sort of high-quality dust mask for any biological or other attack yeah and
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:07.680]  let's be clear they break in now and take control and they always start with
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:11.600]  that next it'll be report illegal guns I've already seen them do this a few
[03:01:11.600 --> 03:01:16.720]  years ago you're just in the beginning stages our cell phones now are getting
[03:01:16.720 --> 03:01:19.840]  FEMA overrides which we knew were coming now they're saying it's gonna be
[03:01:19.840 --> 03:01:25.600]  messages from the president forced onto your phone yeah they were very urgent
[03:01:25.600 --> 03:01:30.560]  about saying doing it in January and making sure it's done this month yeah I
[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:34.120]  don't know they want you know everything collapses they tried to keep you safe
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:37.680]  but your cookie if you get a year supply you're only supposed to be a week supply
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:42.080]  or a three-day supply it's all psych warfare why is FEMA wired into the
[03:01:42.080 --> 03:01:47.440]  internet kill switch now all the radio all the TV UHF VHF cable they all are
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:50.200]  wired in to put out whatever messages they want but they don't need to take
[03:01:50.200 --> 03:01:54.200]  over they've already got their messages going out except talk radio and there's
[03:01:54.200 --> 03:01:56.760]  only a few hosts that'll tell it like it is I mean and we're gonna lose
[03:01:56.760 --> 03:02:00.720]  everything I see good signs by a lot of conservatives are really getting the
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:04.640]  hardcore now because they better it's time to admit I've been right Ron Paul's
[03:02:04.640 --> 03:02:09.000]  been right other it's classic tyranny folks it's time to admit we've been
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:16.400]  right okay I mean that's what's so frustrating is that we we don't want to
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:23.920]  be proven right the rest of the way okay I appreciate your call my brother
[03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:30.280]  Scott in California you're on the air and disagrees goes ahead hey I was just

[03:02:36.680 --> 03:02:43.080]  of I think many that think that you did more harm to the cause of you know the
[03:02:43.080 --> 03:02:47.400]  libertarian freedom-oriented sure cuz Piers Morgan told you some no no not at
[03:02:47.400 --> 03:02:51.560]  all I've been listening to you since 2003 and you calling him a redcoat doing
[03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:54.800]  the British accent doing everything I mean imagine if he was black and you
[03:02:54.800 --> 03:02:59.120]  would have done the stereotypical black accent so you're you're a former liberal
[03:02:59.120 --> 03:03:03.160]  who's now become a libertarian because because look look look bloody I'll make
[03:03:03.160 --> 03:03:09.600]  fun of the snot-nosed upper-class twits that they even make fun of over in
[03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:15.040]  England all day long okay I'll do that all I want and the point is we put it in
[03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:18.120]  their face about what was happening and again could I've done a better job
[03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:24.120]  absolutely but I'm in the arena I'm in the arena you understand that you
[03:03:24.120 --> 03:03:28.640]  quintessentially fit every single stereotype it was they use those
[03:03:28.640 --> 03:03:33.600]  stereotypes of what they don't want us to be because that's winning our founders
[03:03:33.600 --> 03:03:38.080]  murdered people according to the British redcoats who abused our rights killed
