[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:31.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.080 --> 00:39.320]  just when you think things can't get any crazier they do actually had two of my
[00:39.320 --> 00:44.440]  writers write about the same thing today like two ships I guess quietly
[00:44.440 --> 00:49.240]  passing each other in the night so there's two articles on this up an
[00:49.240 --> 00:58.000]  info wars.com MSNBC guest more white kids have to die and then there's Paul
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.040]  Watson's article that was Curt Nemo's headline MSNBC pundit more white kids
[01:02.040 --> 01:06.800]  need to die for Americans to understand racism you know I just asked Curt to add
[01:06.800 --> 01:13.160]  crime statistics from the Justice Department on exactly who's killing who
[01:13.160 --> 01:18.200]  just a fact because it's been advertised and pushed by the socialist
[01:18.200 --> 01:23.080]  authoritarian media and by the new Black Panther Party and a lot of other groups
[01:23.080 --> 01:27.840]  like that that don't mug people and rob people in your neighborhood go find a
[01:27.840 --> 01:33.440]  predominantly white neighborhood and go after them and then Michael Moore says
[01:33.440 --> 01:37.400]  if white people buy guns is because they're scared of scared of black
[01:37.400 --> 01:42.840]  people I don't think that's the case on average but this is really a war on
[01:42.840 --> 01:51.160]  self-defense and Michael Moore and his social engineers they want all of us to
[01:51.160 --> 01:55.840]  live like folks do in the most dangerous areas of Chicago the most dangerous
[01:55.840 --> 02:03.280]  areas of New York and DC where they have taken the firearms from the law-abiding
[02:03.280 --> 02:08.320]  citizens and that's what this whole psi-op is about last night my wife had
[02:08.320 --> 02:11.560]  gone to the grocery store late so she pulls up gets out of the car about nine
[02:11.560 --> 02:15.600]  at night comes in the house and she said I was just listening to Greta Van
[02:15.600 --> 02:22.000]  Sestern on Fox via XM and she said you've got to hear this so this morning
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.400]  she went and found the club I forgot to give it to the guys but I
[02:25.400 --> 02:30.880]  will where she has one of the attorneys for the a Martin family on and the
[02:30.880 --> 02:36.480]  woman says I am a social engineer not just a lawyer and we're here fighting
[02:36.480 --> 02:41.760]  racism and that's why the Justice Department needs to go after Zimmerman
[02:41.760 --> 02:49.080]  and and it just hit me with what a distraction this whole thing is from all
[02:49.080 --> 02:57.200]  the real tyranny going on in this world and how that's all the establishment has
[02:57.200 --> 03:01.000]  going for them is to get us to fight with each other it's so elementary it's so
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.760]  obvious but the media puts something out like this puts a story out beats the
[03:06.760 --> 03:11.120]  drum for a year and a half and people almost feel like they're celebrities
[03:11.120 --> 03:22.600]  weighing in on it people feel like they are part of the establishment weighing in
[03:22.600 --> 03:28.480]  on things they feel like it's you know it's cool to be part of it and you've
[03:28.480 --> 03:33.920]  got the white folks you know on the internet which has the anonymity or
[03:33.920 --> 03:37.280]  people claiming they're white folks some cases it's probably people in
[03:37.280 --> 03:41.600]  government saying horrible things about quote minorities and then you've got
[03:41.600 --> 03:45.400]  people claiming to be black some of them I'm sure are some of them aren't sure
[03:45.400 --> 03:49.480]  it's the same thing as with the provocateurs on the other side stirring
[03:49.480 --> 03:55.000]  up things and you sit here and you look at it and the drum just beats and beats
[03:55.000 --> 04:03.400]  and beats and beats and beats and beats so what I'm gonna do is get into the
[04:03.400 --> 04:09.120]  latest on the whole saga where you have racial attacks I mean I saw a video
[04:09.120 --> 04:14.040]  where you've got another TV reporter interviewing a black guy but it's to a
[04:14.040 --> 04:18.400]  white camera guy on a white reporter and it looks like when they run away it's
[04:18.400 --> 04:23.840]  couple black looks like teenagers come up and sucker punch in the back of the
[04:23.840 --> 04:34.160]  head the cameraman and the reporter and then running off and you can hear the
[04:34.160 --> 04:38.440]  big black guy they're interviewing turned towards the teenagers it says what's
[04:38.440 --> 04:43.320]  you gonna do little man so they run off from him and there's a bunch of these
[04:43.320 --> 04:47.600]  videos I mean imagine there's a white guy let me go punch him he he probably I
[04:47.600 --> 04:52.560]  mean that's pure racism and then I saw an info wars people defending it going
[04:52.560 --> 04:56.840]  hey go ahead and shoot the reporters you know they might be dangerous like

[08:39.160 --> 08:45.560]  ladies and gentlemen here we are broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday
[08:45.560 --> 08:53.840]  the 17th day of July 2013 worldwide broadcast okay coming up I want to get
[08:53.840 --> 08:59.480]  into a article from yahoo news today is carrying it it's actually the associated
[08:59.480 --> 09:05.360]  press driving somewhere there's a government record of that now going
[09:05.360 --> 09:13.400]  back 18 years when I first got on air I confirmed that they were installing
[09:13.400 --> 09:20.760]  license plate reading cameras in Indiana and Texas I saw it in a technology
[09:20.760 --> 09:28.240]  publication that actually an engineer brought me this is back in 1995 1996 and
[09:28.240 --> 09:34.240]  I said those cameras they've put up on I-35 because it listed them are recording
[09:34.240 --> 09:38.440]  your license plate and everywhere you go and people would call in and say we're
[09:38.440 --> 09:45.240]  not 1984 we're not beyond Soviet Russia you're a liar and I would tell people by
[09:45.240 --> 09:50.520]  1998 your digital cable box is listening to you with a microphone I even busted
[09:50.520 --> 09:57.080]  one open on access television and got death threats over it by people claiming
[09:57.080 --> 10:01.920]  they were engineers you know if you keep talking about this you're dead boy
[10:01.920 --> 10:05.920]  stuff like that because back then hey there's no microphone listening to me in
[10:05.920 --> 10:11.680]  my cable box I'm in America and this is big money for the system they got
[10:11.680 --> 10:18.320]  hopping and I mean hopping mad but here it is in the associated press today so
[10:18.320 --> 10:23.760]  see what's ancient news for my audience is now new news for the public because
[10:23.760 --> 10:26.760]  now it's all about throwing it in your face because now they're going to use
[10:26.760 --> 10:32.960]  the grid openly government bureau creating a Google Earth on every financial
[10:32.960 --> 10:39.320]  tracts transaction senator says seeing an s news yeah the Pentagon a few years
[10:39.320 --> 10:44.560]  ago actually came out and said we have a giant computer map with DARPA of every
[10:44.560 --> 10:48.680]  transaction you make every phone call you make every place you go who you talk
[10:48.680 --> 10:54.560]  to what you do so of course I mean why are they seeing arrest Snowden because
[10:54.560 --> 10:59.080]  he came out and said that it's illegal and it's wrong and that they're
[10:59.080 --> 11:05.320]  targeting non-terrorist the general public his crime is his credibility as a
[11:05.320 --> 11:09.560]  network administrator over very high-level stuff because even if you're
[11:09.560 --> 11:12.440]  not you know somebody that's been working there for years when you've got
[11:12.440 --> 11:17.480]  to know how they need you're over the infrastructure you're the mole the ghost
[11:17.480 --> 11:23.880]  in the system and so this is about intimidating their own minions that's
[11:23.880 --> 11:29.160]  what this whole situation is about so we're gonna be getting into that old
[11:29.160 --> 11:32.680]  news for our audience new news for the general public financial times of London
[11:32.680 --> 11:36.360]  we have good cause to abhor the surveillance state and they go into
[11:36.360 --> 11:39.920]  talking about how every case it's been done in history it results in absolute
[11:39.920 --> 11:44.560]  tyranny and nightmare despotism oh yeah most the people that are filthy rich
[11:44.560 --> 11:49.760]  right now and help bring the system in are going to be robbed by the tyranny
[11:49.760 --> 11:58.760]  they set up only mad men get rid of the checks and the balances continuing do
[11:58.760 --> 12:05.440]  you know where you'll be in 285 days from now at 2 p.m. Microsoft and Google do
[12:05.440 --> 12:13.520]  this is out of fast company dot com again I told you about this 1999 is when I
[12:13.520 --> 12:17.840]  learned about it and then they were bragging about it in MIT publications by
[12:17.840 --> 12:27.920]  2005 and I've told you that by 2006 they had 93% accuracy on where you're gonna
[12:27.920 --> 12:33.500]  eat dinner tomorrow night even before you knew and even higher accuracy with
[12:33.500 --> 12:38.400]  mass movements now it's even worse so there's that article privacy groups led
[12:38.400 --> 12:45.640]  by electronic frontier foundation sue to stop NSA and FBI electronic
[12:45.640 --> 12:51.240]  surveillance pointing out it's illegal well it's secret arrest and torture is
[12:51.240 --> 12:56.680]  illegal saying the Tea Party is terrorist is illegal having the IRS
[12:56.680 --> 13:00.000]  tell churches what they can pray is illegal and telling pro-lifers they
[13:00.000 --> 13:06.400]  can't demonstrate against abortions this has been recorded this has been in the
[13:06.400 --> 13:10.520]  news so that's illegal but you know tell that to add all Hitler tell that to
[13:10.520 --> 13:16.080]  Julius Caesar tell that to Pol Pot tell that to Mao Zedong tell that to Kim
[13:16.080 --> 13:21.040]  Jung-un and Kim Jung-il and his daddy before him they got the guns you don't
[13:21.040 --> 13:24.600]  you're a slave that's why the globalists want our guns that's why by
[13:24.600 --> 13:28.520]  partisan they want our guns that's why they're connecting gun ownership on
[13:28.520 --> 13:37.160]  CNN and MSNBC and and Fox Sports to racism so that they can culturally get
[13:37.160 --> 13:40.480]  the minorities that are really the majority and they're gonna be a super
[13:40.480 --> 13:45.360]  majority within about a decade to to think I want to ban the guns it's my
[13:45.360 --> 13:50.280]  civil right to have my guns taken it's my civil right to kill my baby it's my
[13:50.280 --> 13:56.820]  civil right to have free fluoride put my water it's my civil right this is
[13:56.820 --> 14:03.920]  loving your servitude this is how they they bind it to that if you don't let
[14:03.920 --> 14:08.440]  unlimited foreigners come in and be given government welfare as a stipend to
[14:08.440 --> 14:13.760]  help supplant jobs and drive down wages you're a racist if you don't like the
[14:13.760 --> 14:18.320]  health care bill written by insurance companies to not give pre-existing care
[14:18.320 --> 14:23.400]  make poor people buy the care have giant taxes on everybody's payroll rip
[14:23.400 --> 14:28.400]  everybody off but the mega rich that are exempt and Congress who's exempt you're
[14:28.400 --> 14:32.320]  a racist yeah everybody's been looking at their paycheck with that old
[14:32.320 --> 14:39.280]  Obamacare money getting peeled off the top yeah yeah yeah he's gonna give you
[14:39.280 --> 14:44.040]  something free because he's a black man and he loves you that's all big foreign
[14:44.040 --> 14:51.400]  banks funded him two to one against the ringer he was running against Mittens
[14:51.400 --> 14:58.080]  Romney that whole thing ladies and gentlemen was one big fix people said
[14:58.080 --> 15:01.080]  well why weren't you for John McCain then why did you not go out against Obama
[15:01.080 --> 15:05.120]  five years ago because I knew they were all just globalists and they were gonna
[15:05.120 --> 15:09.600]  put in who they wanted he probably did get elected popularly that's how this
[15:09.600 --> 15:14.200]  country works that's why we're suckers it's why we're becoming poor it's why
[15:14.200 --> 15:18.760]  we're dying young it's why the cancer rates are up and the IQs are dropping
[15:18.760 --> 15:24.680]  physically because we stopped being wily we stopped not trusting the
[15:24.680 --> 15:28.640]  government we stopped the common sense folks if you went back a hundred years
[15:28.640 --> 15:33.200]  ago to the north south the east the west black white Asian it didn't matter and
[15:33.200 --> 15:36.800]  you said let's trust the government let's give them power they're going to
[15:36.800 --> 15:41.320]  take care of us people would laugh at you
[15:42.400 --> 15:49.560]  oh the old timers they don't like to keep their money in a bank why they
[15:49.560 --> 15:54.080]  don't trust it and now you see him stealing people's bank accounts bank fees
[15:54.080 --> 15:58.400]  taking money out of people's accounts all over the world looting the pension
[15:58.400 --> 16:03.440]  funds all over the world and now it's accelerating here and once they get their
[16:03.440 --> 16:07.800]  cashless society in place then they can charge you five dollars or whatever they
[16:07.800 --> 16:12.200]  want to use your own digital money and that's the plan and then they can track
[16:12.200 --> 16:15.800]  everywhere you go and they could figure out what you've absolutely got to have
[16:15.800 --> 16:20.160]  and they can find where you're getting money off the radar most people couldn't
[16:20.160 --> 16:23.880]  survive nowadays if they actually paid all the taxes most people couldn't survive
[16:23.880 --> 16:29.440]  the day they weren't doing some underground work and that's all gonna be
[16:29.440 --> 16:33.840]  gotten rid of so they can have the post-industrial world and shut things
[16:33.840 --> 16:39.080]  down and make you live in a 200 square foot coffin apartment that's the plan
[16:39.080 --> 16:47.320]  jack to make you poor so that you can be the the ignorant food of the new world
[16:47.320 --> 16:51.000]  order when you look at what they've done to poor communities across the world the
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.160]  globalist how they make them dependent how they break them down how they break
[16:55.160 --> 16:59.840]  down the families that is the group that's already been dominated and taken
[16:59.840 --> 17:06.720]  control of and enslaved that is then used as the the political football fodder
[17:06.720 --> 17:12.480]  to then go out and be the political minions and the political foot soldiers
[17:12.480 --> 17:22.920]  of the collectivist hive Borg that sees control of the system so I'm gonna be
[17:22.920 --> 17:27.400]  getting into a little bit more on the NSA and we're gonna get into the U.S.
[17:27.400 --> 17:35.960]  Army on record being used to spy on anti-GMO activist now why would the Army
[17:35.960 --> 17:42.160]  be involved in spying on health groups anti-war groups tea party groups and
[17:42.160 --> 17:45.320]  this has come out that the Army leaked it when they were told to go to Ron Paul
[17:45.320 --> 17:50.440]  rallies in Houston and Dallas one of which I was speaking at and in in the
[17:50.440 --> 17:57.720]  training sheet and in the briefing it said don't let them know your U.S. Army
[17:57.720 --> 18:03.920]  they may kill you remember that and in the Fed rally four years ago it's in my
[18:03.920 --> 18:10.360]  film Obama deception just four and a half years ago we show our rally up there
[18:10.360 --> 18:14.880]  you can just pull up army at Ron Paul rallies and imagine the Army sitting
[18:14.880 --> 18:18.520]  there in a meeting with straight face going don't let them know your U.S. Army
[18:18.520 --> 18:24.880]  in plain clothes they may attack you or try to kill you really I think probably
[18:24.880 --> 18:27.840]  half the people of those rallies are probably active due to military and
[18:27.840 --> 18:33.040]  that's why the military leaked that out of Camp Maybury Austin Texas was because
[18:33.040 --> 18:38.000]  they're like wow this is this is crazy yes this is authoritarianism all of it
[18:38.000 --> 18:43.120]  all of it you see is authoritarianism pointed at the American people and the
[18:43.120 --> 18:46.120]  only way the globalist can win is playing us off against each other so when
[18:46.120 --> 18:53.400]  I come back I'm first gonna get into the latest now four plus days into the
[18:53.400 --> 18:57.600]  verdict and I've got stacks of news articles here where Hollywood hit by
[18:57.600 --> 19:03.200]  roaming band of robbers police say no connection to the Zimmerman Trayvon
[19:03.200 --> 19:07.160]  Martin verdict that's what the LA Times says that'd be like if the Sun came up
[19:07.160 --> 19:11.120]  and warm the plants and made the plants grow and they said it has no effect on
[19:11.120 --> 19:15.320]  the plot I guess the UN already actually voted and said that that the Sun
[19:15.320 --> 19:18.560]  doesn't affect climate so I guess it's true the Sun doesn't doesn't warm my
[19:18.560 --> 19:21.520]  skin doesn't give me a sunburn doesn't make the plants grow doesn't make the
[19:21.520 --> 19:26.120]  water turn into vapor and then go out and form clouds because the UN said so so
[19:26.120 --> 19:30.320]  I see I try to make satirical jokes and then it's not satire it's already
[19:30.320 --> 19:35.760]  happening so all over the place there are groups of black teens mainly with
[19:35.760 --> 19:43.760]  with you know methhead type drooling anarchist so-called anarchist in tow
[19:43.760 --> 19:49.080]  with them beating people up going into Walmart's robbing people that this is a
[19:49.080 --> 19:53.560]  phenomenon all over the country and the police always stand down because this is
[19:53.560 --> 20:01.200]  again a sacrament of the trendiness preparing the race war what does freedom

[24:18.080 --> 24:30.800]  you know there's another Bob Marley song that we play a clip of where he talks
[24:30.800 --> 24:35.040]  about they want us divided they want us fighting with each other they want us
[24:35.040 --> 24:41.160]  killing one another that's why when Malcolm X ceased to be a racist you know
[24:41.160 --> 24:45.520]  saying that all whites were inherently bad people because he traveled to Eastern
[24:45.520 --> 24:51.440]  Europe he traveled the Middle East so everybody living in peace together then
[24:51.440 --> 24:54.960]  he came back and preached against it and got assassinated same reason they
[24:54.960 --> 24:59.360]  killed Martin Luther King the last thing the globalist want is for you to go off
[24:59.360 --> 25:03.920]  what somebody actually stands for and does and think about it the so-called
[25:03.920 --> 25:07.760]  liberal media and Al Sharpton and all these other racist do you think them
[25:07.760 --> 25:13.360]  saying outrageous stuff on television is going to create more unity or less
[25:13.360 --> 25:22.600]  unity oh it's going to unify the rabble under them it's going to unify the
[25:22.600 --> 25:28.760]  black racist and the thug culture that is taking over the communities of this
[25:28.760 --> 25:34.400]  country period the thug life under that as a racial system just like the
[25:34.400 --> 25:38.160]  government funds Mecha and La Raza and the Fortune 500 funds it which are
[25:38.160 --> 25:42.240]  Hispanic Ku Klux Klan groups go read their writings it's incredible and just
[25:42.240 --> 25:48.400]  like the government gives attention and has been giving support to the white
[25:48.400 --> 25:53.840]  supremacist rabble and then playing us off against each other that is exactly
[25:53.840 --> 25:57.480]  what's going on by the way Jimmy Carter has come out and this is in
[25:57.480 --> 26:04.040]  Politico there's a video saying George Zimmerman jury was right well I guess
[26:04.040 --> 26:09.200]  that's because he is a cracker but no it's because he actually knows the law
[26:09.200 --> 26:14.240]  whether you love or hate Jimmy Carter he always tries to be fair and he's
[26:14.240 --> 26:17.720]  always been a big peacemaker with the only real accords with Israel and
[26:17.720 --> 26:22.040]  Egypt ever that we've seen and no one can deny he's a real Christian and means
[26:22.040 --> 26:26.320]  well and he followed and he said they made the right decision I think the
[26:26.320 --> 26:30.000]  jury made the right decision based on the evidence presented because the
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.520]  prosecution inadvertently I don't think inadvertently they wanted this to go to
[26:34.520 --> 26:39.080]  trial and then be a mistrial we said that day one inadvertently set the
[26:39.080 --> 26:45.080]  standards so high that the jury had to be convinced that it was deliberate act
[26:45.080 --> 26:50.720]  by Zimmerman that he was not at all defending himself there you go yeah
[26:50.720 --> 26:54.040]  they probably could have gotten an involuntary manslaughter or manslaughter
[26:54.040 --> 26:58.960]  because this case is close folks I don't think it's a cut and dry thing and
[26:58.960 --> 27:05.360]  that's why it was chosen I don't think it's smart to follow somebody with a
[27:05.360 --> 27:09.760]  gun if they're walking between houses and looking and you know looking back and
[27:09.760 --> 27:12.760]  forth because they're wearing a hoodie and fit some type of archetype in your
[27:12.760 --> 27:15.800]  mind and I mean I do think that fed into the fact that there have been some
[27:15.800 --> 27:24.680]  robberies the suspects were black males and then it fed into it but there is an
[27:24.680 --> 27:28.080]  injustice of a dead person here because we don't know Trayvon Martin was robbing
[27:28.080 --> 27:31.880]  we don't know that but we don't know that Zimmerman killed him on purpose it's
[27:31.880 --> 27:36.200]  called reasonable down and what you've got is a power structure that wants to
[27:36.200 --> 27:40.480]  divide and conquer people now this video is up on info wars calm there's two
[27:40.480 --> 27:45.240]  different articles Kurt wrote his last night but had it had it on pause until
[27:45.240 --> 27:50.880]  this morning so you could publish it at 5 a.m. and Paul Joseph Watson also did an
[27:50.880 --> 27:59.120]  article on it professor who said black people can't be racist spews racism and
[27:59.120 --> 28:05.800]  we're gonna play a clip MSNBC pundit and professor Michael Eric Dyson who
[28:05.800 --> 28:09.520]  previously argued that it's impossible for black people to be racist all that
[28:09.520 --> 28:12.920]  is his tribalism I mean they got black tribes killing black tribes in Africa
[28:12.920 --> 28:16.600]  over any excuse you know well you you worship a different God or you live in
[28:16.600 --> 28:20.920]  a different area I mean it's tribalism but he says it's impossible
[28:20.920 --> 28:27.560]  illustrating why so many viewers are abandoning the beleaguered network that
[28:27.560 --> 28:31.440]  has said Americans would not understand racism until white kids were being
[28:31.440 --> 28:35.480]  killed in the same numbers as blacks so I've seen these Justice Department
[28:35.480 --> 28:38.960]  numbers before I'm gonna have the guys dig it up and add it to Kurt and
[28:38.960 --> 28:44.000]  Watson's article where on average last time I saw the numbers a white is ten
[28:44.000 --> 28:49.520]  times more likely to be assaulted or killed by a black person ten times and
[28:49.520 --> 28:53.880]  on average it's above ten but in some areas 20 times and I show these
[28:53.880 --> 28:58.400]  statistics Sunday from the Justice Department 20 times more likely to be
[28:58.400 --> 29:03.320]  killed by a black person if you're a black person than by a white person
[29:03.320 --> 29:08.640]  there are some areas of the country where Hispanics are killing blacks in a
[29:08.640 --> 29:13.240]  gang-related racist thing and that's an LA where it's the only place the
[29:13.240 --> 29:18.480]  numbers are flipped and the Hispanics are mainly from Mexico it's Mexican
[29:18.480 --> 29:25.560]  gangs they're coming in and pushing the blacks out but so so I think I think
[29:25.560 --> 29:31.240]  whites do understand sir that the media has said whites are racist and bad kill
[29:31.240 --> 29:34.840]  them rob them murder them and then people actually don't feel like they're
[29:34.840 --> 29:40.800]  racist doing it it becomes a good thing to do that's like kill a commie for
[29:40.800 --> 29:49.640]  mommy kill a cracker for daddy you know it's that's what's going on here we're

[35:45.160 --> 35:51.760]  spend it and say America's free unlike what Alex Jones says because he's still
[35:51.760 --> 35:58.320]  on the air yeah it's taken me 18 years and there's still enough freedom left
[35:58.320 --> 36:02.560]  that I could be on the air I never said America was under total tyranny
[36:02.560 --> 36:07.600]  they're trying to put us under total tyranny anybody can see that so I'll
[36:07.600 --> 36:10.440]  mention that later if I have time maybe in the next hour we have a guest in

[39:47.440 --> 39:52.160]  thank you for joining us all right resetting here Jimmy Carter you can
[39:52.160 --> 39:57.320]  say what you want about him he was a real guy he was a real guy I don't agree
[39:57.320 --> 40:00.880]  with a lot of his bleeding heart stuff because it always makes people dependent
[40:00.880 --> 40:05.880]  can be used but he he followed the trial he said he's been upset by it and he
[40:05.880 --> 40:11.520]  told WXIATV there's a video of it up on info wars.com it's also on drudge
[40:11.520 --> 40:15.400]  report.com it's from Politico where he says I think they made the right
[40:15.400 --> 40:19.880]  decision because the prosecution inadvertently set the standard so high
[40:19.880 --> 40:25.600]  the jury had to be convinced that it was the Libert act by Zimmerman that he was
[40:25.600 --> 40:31.600]  not at all defending himself and so forth and if you know the law that's how
[40:31.600 --> 40:39.960]  OJ got off and was it you know a thing of anti-white that he killed his white
[40:39.960 --> 40:47.360]  ex-wife many believed no white people didn't go he's a racist he he you know
[40:47.360 --> 40:52.840]  because he's white and no it's a crime of passion a crime of passion but
[40:52.840 --> 40:56.600]  regardless they couldn't totally prove it even though it looked like he was
[40:56.600 --> 41:03.760]  guilty you got to be sure folks there cannot be any reasonable doubt any
[41:03.760 --> 41:11.280]  reasonable doubt that's our system hey in North Korea they don't have a trial
[41:11.280 --> 41:15.400]  folks you just disappear and in other places they have kangaroo courts where
[41:15.400 --> 41:18.760]  politically they decide what they want to do and that's what this is all about
[41:18.760 --> 41:21.880]  is social engineering I've been saying it for a year and a half since this
[41:21.880 --> 41:25.960]  started and one of Trayvon Martin's family's lawyers got up there and said
[41:25.960 --> 41:30.880]  on Grad of Assessor we're gonna play a clip coming up said that exact thing and
[41:30.880 --> 41:35.480]  you can say what you want I'm sure black people gone through a lot of racism and
[41:35.480 --> 41:41.880]  discrimination and just uncomfortableness I've said this many times I don't like
[41:41.880 --> 41:46.920]  being invited to fancy you know country clubs like the most elite because I
[41:46.920 --> 41:54.680]  don't feel like state senators or US senators or you know famous people
[41:54.680 --> 41:59.880]  because I get invited to stuff like this it'll come to our spa and then I'm in
[41:59.880 --> 42:05.160]  the bathroom I took a shower you know after playing tennis or whatever and who
[42:05.160 --> 42:09.120]  are you are you Alex Jones I'm judge such and such what are you what are you
[42:09.120 --> 42:13.440]  doing here who invited you here well the such and such has invited me and we're
[42:13.440 --> 42:18.680]  just you know here to play tennis and then eat dinner of uh-huh well very nice
[42:18.680 --> 42:24.160]  to see you you know it's so so much what you call racism is just
[42:24.160 --> 42:32.440]  uncomfortableness and the media is there trying to create that trying to make
[42:32.440 --> 42:35.120]  people where they don't feel like they're comfortable I mean if you go to
[42:35.120 --> 42:39.000]  some of these elite restaurants slash speakeasies in Austin because that's the
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.840]  trendy thing is to go to a bar that's not licensed and they serve dinner and
[42:43.840 --> 42:46.600]  anytime I go out with celebrities and awesome when they come visit me they
[42:46.600 --> 42:51.080]  want to go to one of these things in East Austin and so you go and you knock
[42:51.080 --> 42:53.880]  on the door and they look at you and they bring in there's gourmet food and
[42:53.880 --> 42:58.760]  all stuff but people come over go Alex Jones who lets you in here you know what
[42:58.760 --> 43:02.760]  I'm saying is it's like that if you go to some trendy black bar you're probably
[43:02.760 --> 43:08.440]  gonna have some racist black guys come over even the 90% of people in there
[43:08.440 --> 43:13.440]  like you and think you're cool they're gonna be some racist in there again
[43:13.440 --> 43:17.440]  they're tribalist or they're elitist or want to be elitist it's like a club who
[43:17.440 --> 43:21.560]  wasn't said I wouldn't be part of any club that would have me and then they
[43:21.560 --> 43:25.760]  come over I mean you could go to a redneck event and if they don't know
[43:25.760 --> 43:29.600]  you they're gonna come over and say who are you if they're trashy people that
[43:29.600 --> 43:34.920]  are just into their club who invited you to this bonfire even just sitting there
[43:34.920 --> 43:39.040]  you know how uncool people are so you go to here's some jazz it's some you know
[43:39.040 --> 43:42.760]  East Austin you know they're talking ten years ago before all the trinities
[43:42.760 --> 43:46.720]  went over there it's like what are you crackers doing here and you're like
[43:46.720 --> 43:52.000]  nothing like oh that's alright I'm not gonna beat your butt or anything and
[43:52.000 --> 43:55.200]  then a reason I won't go to places like that I'll say oh you are well go ahead
[43:55.200 --> 44:00.120]  and try it see because that's my problem I can't back off to anybody folks so
[44:00.120 --> 44:02.960]  that's why I don't go to country clubs it's why I don't go to pretty much
[44:02.960 --> 44:07.640]  black only bars cuz you're gonna get told get your cracker butt out of here you
[44:07.640 --> 44:11.440]  go to a country club they're gonna be like who are you well Alex Jones why
[44:11.440 --> 44:17.880]  are you here if you go to the most elite country club they'll kick anybody out
[44:17.880 --> 44:22.040]  because that's how they feel elitist I'm explaining to you how the world really
[44:22.040 --> 44:27.160]  works if you haven't experienced this okay so they want us all uncomfortable
[44:27.160 --> 44:31.400]  they want us all in our own groups and it's a gang mentality Al Sharpton and
[44:31.400 --> 44:35.520]  Jesse Jesse Jackson's not that bad compared Al Sharpton and Al Sharpton's
[44:35.520 --> 44:41.560]  not that bad compared to some of these professor Michael Eric Dyson who says
[44:41.560 --> 44:46.400]  blacks cannot be racist we're perfect and whites are inherently bad and more
[44:46.400 --> 44:52.040]  white people need to die and I'm like excuse me on average it's 10 to 1 black
[44:52.040 --> 44:56.840]  on white crime in this country because it's advertised go out and knock a
[44:56.840 --> 45:00.800]  cracker over the head I can play the clips of this stuff and then so crackers
[45:00.800 --> 45:07.000]  go and get guns and start getting scared because there's a minority of blacks
[45:07.000 --> 45:13.760]  that are racist that go out and feed on white people and then you've got
[45:13.760 --> 45:18.920]  professor running around on MSNBC I mean my mom said she hadn't watched NBC in
[45:18.920 --> 45:22.160]  about a year she turned it on and my mom's what you'd call kind of a
[45:22.160 --> 45:27.240]  classical populist you know liberal she's changed over the years just seeing
[45:27.240 --> 45:31.800]  the extremism of the left and she goes my I couldn't believe it she said it was
[45:31.800 --> 45:40.080]  like the twilight zone I know MSNBC is scientific cultural death scientific
[45:40.080 --> 45:48.120]  cultural pollution it is a weapon it is an assault and anytime I'm in LA or some
[45:48.120 --> 45:52.760]  liberal area and I'm in a minority owned store man you know it's on and the
[45:52.760 --> 45:58.080]  people are sitting there watching it and it's just like wow this is not a
[45:58.080 --> 46:02.720]  quality folks this is not coming together this is going to create people
[46:02.720 --> 46:12.840]  segregating themselves people segregate themselves they segregate themselves and
[46:12.840 --> 46:17.000]  it's everybody doing this and this is by design because these political groups
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.800]  want these groups under them so let's go to this clip that's up at info wars
[46:21.800 --> 46:27.200]  dot com a professor who said black people can't be racist and then spews
[46:27.200 --> 46:32.160]  incredible racism here's the clip as for Eric Holder look the reality is you
[46:32.160 --> 46:36.320]  got to act now the president you won the second term you're in office you are
[46:36.320 --> 46:42.120]  ensconced do something courageous bold and helpful not only to African American
[46:42.120 --> 46:46.760]  people but to America because lest we do this white Americans and others will
[46:46.760 --> 46:49.760]  feel that this was a justifiable verdict this is how things happen not
[46:49.760 --> 46:55.600]  until and unless the number of white kids died that approximate the numbers of
[46:55.600 --> 46:59.480]  black and other kids who died will America see it's beyond logic it's about
[46:59.480 --> 47:02.160]  rationality it's about let's get something done I think the Attorney
[47:02.160 --> 47:08.520]  General will look at this and I think it's time for a drink up now again this
[47:08.520 --> 47:12.320]  is about making the whole world about race to I mean it's a bunch of
[47:12.320 --> 47:15.520]  grandstanding and the Attorney General came out and said we're gonna stand up
[47:15.520 --> 47:19.640]  against these guns we're gonna stand up we're gonna stand our ground
[47:19.640 --> 47:24.000]  so now they're selling self-defense laws that by the way statistics are out
[47:24.000 --> 47:27.920]  today the daily caller has them the Justice Department admits two to one in
[47:27.920 --> 47:32.400]  Florida blacks you stand their ground when somebody's got a weapon you gotta
[47:32.400 --> 47:36.920]  have a weapon coming at somebody to attack them and they shoot them you see
[47:36.920 --> 47:41.200]  I want to arm the people in Mexico to defend themselves against the organized
[47:41.200 --> 47:46.600]  criminal government and the cartels I want to arm black people in Chicago
[47:46.600 --> 47:49.800]  New York and DC and let me tell you because we know what's happened when
[47:49.800 --> 47:53.680]  this has been done in other areas the crime rate will go straight down let me
[47:53.680 --> 48:00.240]  tell you if you if they had a city program to train Chicagoans train
[48:00.240 --> 48:03.520]  Chicagoans you could have public events with thousands out there sign a waiver
[48:03.520 --> 48:10.520]  do the training you would see a massive crime reduction if especially law
[48:10.520 --> 48:14.800]  abiding citizens hard work in black folks in Chicago it's the black areas that
[48:14.800 --> 48:18.440]  have the crime rate just off the charts 500 plus dead a year thousands
[48:18.440 --> 48:22.240]  wounded if you armed the good citizens because they fall the lawn and don't have
[48:22.240 --> 48:27.160]  a gun you would literally see those criminals a bloodbath at first and then
[48:27.160 --> 48:31.560]  crime rates plunge to almost nothing it is a fact this is not my opinion the
[48:31.560 --> 48:37.840]  true racism is that black cities don't let black people have guns because the
[48:37.840 --> 48:42.600]  Democratic Party is the party of the Ku Klux Klan I mean that that's a fact
[48:42.600 --> 48:46.760]  ladies and gentlemen these are Judas goats just like Margaret singer said
[48:46.760 --> 48:50.080]  she goes we're gonna go hire black leaders poses liberals to control these
[48:50.080 --> 48:53.080]  people that's how we're gonna get control and break up their families and
[48:53.080 --> 48:57.760]  social engineering now let's go to the next clip here here is another clip this
[48:57.760 --> 49:04.200]  is Eric Holder saying we must stand our ground at the NAACP convention this is
[49:04.200 --> 49:07.160]  the guy that ships guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment that has
[49:07.160 --> 49:12.280]  killed thousands of people this is a guy it is absolutely cold-blooded playing
[49:12.280 --> 49:19.440]  a race card manipulating his would-be slaves at the NAACP here it is to ensure
[49:19.440 --> 49:24.480]  that our laws reduce violence and take a hard look at laws that contribute to more
[49:24.480 --> 49:28.920]  violence than they prevent we must also seek a dialogue on attitudes about
[49:28.920 --> 49:33.700]  violence and disparities that are too commonly swept under the rug by honoring
[49:33.700 --> 49:38.640]  the finest traditions established by generations of NAACP leaders and other
[49:38.640 --> 49:43.000]  nonviolent nonviolent advocates throughout history and by paying tribute
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.920]  to the young man who lost his life here last the patron saint of disarming
[49:46.920 --> 49:50.760]  America how many others whose futures have been cut well this guy arms to the
[49:50.760 --> 49:54.600]  teeth with 7,000 armored vehicles two off billions of rounds of ammo in our
[49:54.600 --> 50:00.720]  streets drones in NSA spying government shipping narcotics in the block area we
[50:00.720 --> 50:05.440]  must do so by engaging with one another in a way that is at once peaceful
[50:05.440 --> 50:10.120]  inclusive respectful you see of Ron Paul that's enough just get him off there as
[50:10.120 --> 50:14.680]  we thank you you know you know Ron Paul gave speeches saying the CIA ships the
[50:14.680 --> 50:19.680]  drugs in we need to abolish it and decriminalize so that it isn't a
[50:19.680 --> 50:25.840]  scourge our inner cities can you imagine if they decriminalized drugs it would
[50:25.840 --> 50:29.880]  take all the money out of it it would in it would really hurt the thug culture
[50:29.880 --> 50:34.120]  oh but no no no no holders never gonna come out and say the big bank ship
[50:34.120 --> 50:39.600]  drugs in the minority neighborhoods no no he's not gonna do anything real he's
[50:39.600 --> 50:43.120]  gonna sit up there and talk about his he has to teach his son about racial
[50:43.120 --> 50:46.120]  profiling really it turns out they searched for more whites without
[50:46.120 --> 50:49.960]  warrants than blacks in New York it's up to like a million a year what about
[50:49.960 --> 50:52.200]  everybody getting their bill of rights what about everybody getting the
[50:52.200 --> 50:57.440]  Constitution oh well don't worry we don't profile anybody everybody's a slave

[54:02.440 --> 54:07.440]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[54:07.440 --> 54:15.400]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network now I
[54:15.400 --> 54:21.080]  want to go to this clip of Jasmine Rand on Fox News last night she said a bunch
[54:21.080 --> 54:26.840]  of times that I'm a social engineer and we're gonna change the culture and
[54:26.840 --> 54:30.240]  that's what this trial is about and that's what they're turning Trayvon
[54:30.240 --> 54:35.320]  Martin into is an anti-second amendment martyr an anti-self-defense martyr an
[54:35.320 --> 54:40.440]  anti-jury martyr and you've got all these calls about get rid of juries have
[54:40.440 --> 54:47.160]  the Justice Department decide yeah just make them God but this is more about
[54:47.160 --> 54:51.400]  there's a lot of reasons the social engineers do this and then the right
[54:51.400 --> 54:55.200]  textbooks on it that's why this lawyer spouts off about it because they're all
[54:55.200 --> 54:59.640]  in the club and they're showing how smart they are that I'm an engineer too
[54:59.640 --> 55:03.960]  no you're being engineered as well those that think they're in control think
[55:03.960 --> 55:08.320]  they know how to manipulate people if you don't give people wide-spectrum truth
[55:08.320 --> 55:12.760]  you dumb them down and then you build a world of idiots and nobody wants to live
[55:12.760 --> 55:17.480]  in that because the world of idiots will be led by a world of tyrants a planet
[55:17.480 --> 55:24.760]  of sheep will be ruled by predators and wolves but this is really about thinking
[55:24.760 --> 55:27.440]  your right is about your sexual preference or what color you are
[55:27.440 --> 55:33.280]  whereas that you know that's in there in the mix to the exclusion of do I have a
[55:33.280 --> 55:37.480]  right to not have foreign banks ruling over me stealing my entire economy
[55:37.480 --> 55:41.480]  picking winners and losers deindustrializing shutting down the
[55:41.480 --> 55:45.920]  small businesses you know federal law says two-thirds of federal bids should
[55:45.920 --> 55:49.560]  go to small business none of it goes to it basically and I have the head of the
[55:49.560 --> 55:52.840]  small business league ongoing we're all being discriminated against if we're
[55:52.840 --> 55:57.360]  gonna have a big government if the money shouldn't go offshore it should go to a
[55:57.360 --> 56:02.840]  bid process and the money should go back in the economy that's discrimination
[56:02.840 --> 56:08.360]  that gets me upset lying when Rick Perry lies and says it's the law you've got to
[56:08.360 --> 56:12.920]  take these vaccines that's discrimination a hoax to say take this deadly
[56:12.920 --> 56:18.880]  shot when Mexico's forcing Gardasil on all girls by law here it wasn't the law
[56:18.880 --> 56:23.520]  he lied and said it was there they're doing it Japan banned it it's killing
[56:23.520 --> 56:29.480]  people I don't want those Mexican girls dying my my humanity
[56:29.480 --> 56:33.720]  see I'm a racist is why see all this real stuff's happening we're being
[56:33.720 --> 56:36.840]  hammered folks with chemtrails electromagnetic I'm getting chills
[56:36.840 --> 56:40.760]  right now and they're just gonna force race race race race and I'll have to
[56:40.760 --> 56:44.880]  hear white people online saying racist stuff then I hear black people saying
[56:44.880 --> 56:49.120]  racist stuff just knowing what idiots they are when we when we've got a new
[56:49.120 --> 56:55.640]  world order over us coming down on us social engineering our genetics our
[56:55.640 --> 57:01.080]  food everything towards the end of civilization towards the end of
[57:01.080 --> 57:06.320]  humanity towards Elysium man I'm getting heavy chills I don't think I've
[57:06.320 --> 57:09.560]  ever gotten chills this bad you guys see this I mean I've got goosebumps man
[57:09.560 --> 57:12.960]  because I realize let's go to this clip of this lady saying she's a social
[57:12.960 --> 57:17.000]  engineer Fox News last night here it is I have a greater duty beyond being an
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.200]  attorney and that's to be a social engineer and when the law doesn't get it
[57:20.200 --> 57:24.360]  right I believe that we have the right to peacefully and morally conscientiously
[57:24.360 --> 57:28.880]  object to the decision of the jury that doesn't mean that we believe that it's
[57:28.880 --> 57:32.280]  going to be overturned or that it will or that we don't respect the decision
[57:32.280 --> 57:35.400]  that those six people made but there are millions of people out there who don't
[57:35.400 --> 57:37.800]  agree with that decision so it's not just the legal it's you know what the
[57:37.800 --> 57:41.320]  problem is you know that's disturbing that's deeply over the world that's
[57:41.320 --> 57:45.400]  deeply disturbing they say millions are out there didn't see it you know and I
[57:45.400 --> 57:50.080]  know that millions of people who may not has been around is he says it again and
[57:50.080 --> 57:54.880]  again the full clips up on info wars.com but this is an inherently evil
[57:54.880 --> 58:01.200]  woman using her beauty and her mind to sit there and play games and again
[58:01.200 --> 58:07.440]  anytime people like her Al Sharpton all these folks black white didn't matter
[58:07.440 --> 58:12.480]  when they seize on this it's to make them a celebrity and the more radical they
[58:12.480 --> 58:16.240]  are like the Fox Sports guys saying all gun owners are racist they're the new
[58:16.240 --> 58:21.720]  clan basically I mean they know that's a lie and see they get to be racist they
[58:21.720 --> 58:26.520]  get to promote race spading as a political weapon because all they want
[58:26.520 --> 58:32.280]  green money folks they want to separate you from your money it is unbelievable
[58:32.280 --> 58:35.720]  all right I'm gonna get into a bunch of the news got a special guest in studio

[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.680]  blow up Russian defensive anti ship missiles that the Russians have been
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.680]  massing troops and a bunch of other stuff while we're busy you know talking
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.800]  about the new Christ figure Trayvon Martin and the white devil that killed
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:07.520]  him and and as MSNBC is busy saying white children need to be killed so we
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.240]  learn the pain and as whites get attacked all over the country in this
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:18.160]  orgy of a Balkanization and race politics out of the party of the Ku Klux
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.720]  Klan the Democrats and yet I'm not even a Republican folks just the Democrats
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:27.800]  are the seediest nastiest big city corruption mafia group of knuckle
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.120]  dragging scum I've ever seen in my life people like Chris Matthews and all
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:37.800]  these master manipulators they make me want to throw up and I know there's been
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.760]  a well-meaning Democrats in the past and the Democrats you know claim they stand
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:45.000]  for good things on the surface but the truth is ladies and gentlemen to white
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.440]  the Eisenhower and the Republicans got the Civil Rights Act passed they were
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:52.400]  the ones the Democrats figured that America had shifted against them the
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.800]  white voters mainly in the north and the south in the west and so they said oh
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.280]  really will one up you will will will pay the black families not to have men in
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.440]  the house they've been Margaret singers thing they'd already done in New York and
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:09.920]  we'll put them all in prison and take over and destroy their culture and since
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:15.800]  then we've gone from less than 10% black illegitimacy to over 93% blacks had
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:21.520]  less illegitimacy pull these numbers up the single parent homes from the kick
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:26.240]  off than whites did course whites are now at about 50% illegitimate so don't
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.960]  worry will everything has been done to the black people will be done on a slow
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.800]  roast to the Hispanics the blacks the whites and we're all the same social
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:41.120]  engineering roaster it's like a crock pot we've been put in here and they're
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:47.000]  outside laughing as social engineers and I just played a clip of the Martin's
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:55.600]  lawyer cutie cakes miss Rand up there with just arrogant going I'm a social
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:00.080]  engineer that's what this trials about yeah you guys have really engineered
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.240]  something you know you judge an employee by their their production their
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:09.280]  quality how honorable they are you judge a tree by its fruits I don't care how
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:14.840]  big a fruit tree is an apple tree I've got some apple trees some date trees some
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:21.800]  plum trees peach trees and some of the big old green ones but don't really put
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.320]  off a lot of fruit but some little scraggling ones may put off even more
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:32.960]  fruit and so I judge a tree by its fruits of course I'm an extremist I judge you
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:40.000]  know a hunting dog by how good it how good it can find find the coil I judge
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.200]  a restaurant by how good the food is see I actually judge a tree by its fruits
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.840]  we're not supposed to do that we're supposed to just judge right off the
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:53.360]  surface and what you look like and I guess it's some levels how beautiful
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:57.720]  someone is or how strong they look at a certain point I guess when I was like
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:03.520]  18 years old I'd go off how a woman looked a hundred percent but the older
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.640]  I've gotten I've gone off how somebody acts I'd rather be hanging around with a
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:12.400]  300 pound fat person that's got moles on their face I'm talking about a
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.120]  particular person I know I'm friends with then I would with some beautiful
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.960]  person on the surface who's arrogant and shallow and not smart I'd rather hang
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.120]  around with somebody that's funny and somebody who's nice and somebody who
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.360]  likes me and isn't a parasite that I'd rather hang around with a beautiful
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.640]  person now the big problem is when you're around a beautiful person who's also
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.920]  very nice and they have great personality then then there's a problem
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:41.000]  obviously then then obviously I'm very attracted to that but it's all for me
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.320]  about personality and who people are and that's what Martin Luther King stood for
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:49.600]  because he was a racist being sarcastic ladies and gentlemen Jimmy Carter's a
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.280]  racist he said the jury to the right thing he's a racist Jimmy Carter now

[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:13.600]  the last week we've been reposting and I guess indicating online one of his very
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.080]  interesting and informative articles so I wanted to go over some of those with him
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.440]  and then have him write shotgun to take some phone calls here with us today here
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.360]  here's a few of them while we're busy obsessing on planet trayvon martin
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:31.640]  world war three brews as a nation distracted by trayvon martin case oh
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:37.040]  yes massing you russian troops is real fired cruise missiles into some of their
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:44.120]  installations in syria also russian military amasses full combat readiness
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:49.680]  strategic bombers japan had to scramble fighters because of it that's some of the
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:54.440]  news a wtc owner larry silversing sue's airlines for billions over nine
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:58.400]  eleven after five billion insurance payout and then the main reason i wanted
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:06.600]  to get him on report gmo activist and independent scientist targeted by
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:11.040]  military and and i covered this four years ago when the army leaked it that
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.080]  ron paul and is in the federalese including in the federal i had in
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:21.280]  dalis the army was there in plain clothes and it said don't let them know
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:27.320]  you're there they may attack you or kill you and of course michael more i'm not a
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:30.080]  big fan of it in his Fahrenheit nine eleven he showed what had already been
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:37.440]  the news in houston the army was going to to milk toast peace groups who were
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:41.560]  baking cookies and it showed this completely non-threatening group they
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:45.200]  had the army and they had police infiltrating them totally illegal folks
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:50.000]  but that they have domestic cia propaganda you have all this stuff going
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.040]  on but nobody watching the big corrupt government so we're going to be going
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:59.080]  over all of that today but first anthony because you brought this up what is your
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:07.440]  take on the whole saga and now msnb see how saying white children need to be
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.080]  killed to show them our pain yeah we can have like human sacrifice again like
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:15.400]  like that's an idea not just pay indulgences of carbon taxes to obama and
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:20.560]  al gore to drive cars but we could actually have federal sacrifices of
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.560]  white children maybe feed them into woodchippers up on the on the rose
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.800]  garden lawn and then al sharpening and maybe pull a lever or maybe this
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:33.480]  professor and we just throw white babies in like one of the new black
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.560]  panther party guys said one time he said we should kill the white babies
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:42.000]  and kill the white women because of the military manufacturing center so what
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.160]  do you say about that well I mean in your inherent white devilness yeah well
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.280]  definitely mean on Twitter the writers say basically kill all white folks so I
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:54.400]  mean maybe we should have a time square type of rally where we just hang all
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:58.320]  white people I mean that's what they want msnbc says we need more white
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.200]  children to die to fully understand this and I guess that's what it comes down
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:06.280]  to in this mainstream media theater piece that is a distraction but we do
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.760]  need to cover it to highlight that so what if people started committing
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.720]  suicide I bet if they told trendies if Obama told white people to commit
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:17.240]  suicide I'm not exaggerating I bet a hundred thousand people would kill
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:21.820]  themselves well they could be he could be like the Jim Jones maybe have
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:25.720]  Kool-Aid well I think you know it's white guilt maybe they should kill
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:29.480]  themselves for doing nothing to anybody I mean Zimmerman isn't even white to
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.600]  begin with and that's a whole nother time it's like Kim Jong-un right it's you
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.840]  know maybe he's a North Korean spy maybe apparently but notice also when the
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:40.160]  lawyers go on Pierce Morgan everything they actually absolutely dominate him
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:43.960]  because they have no actual talking points or logic whatsoever but the fact
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:47.480]  of the matter is again it is a distraction first and foremost while we
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.360]  have World War 3 brewing or already commencing in Russia with a hundred and
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:57.040]  sixty thousand troops in full combat readiness but Russia is crackers to kill
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.200]  them oh everybody Russia they should all kill themselves everybody needs to die
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.080]  besides obviously Trayvon Martin so but bottom line is that as you would say
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:11.480]  Israel went in and blow blew up the Russian missiles in Syria and then let's
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:16.440]  show those anti-ship missiles that were blown up if you just type in Israel used
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:21.800]  dolphin submarine to destroy Russian missiles it'll pop up and and and
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:26.160]  undoubtedly Russian crews on them I keep going I mean that was loving though
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:29.880]  yeah so they actually instigated all this and they act like it's no big deal
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:34.320]  and then Russia goes ahead and orders this combat readiness emergency response
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:37.120]  drill whatever they want to call it Putin goes in because he's not going to
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.920]  take that you know he's not somebody like Obama that's just going to take that
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:45.320]  he's racist yeah he's obviously racist so Israel goes ahead and says you know
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.600]  how dare Russia do that how dare they amass the troops after we blow up their
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.840]  stuff and Russia's here with these strategic bombers and I have just
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.280]  interviewed with RT and I hear that society over there is calling for nukes
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.840]  for Israel they absolutely want to go into war they want to go against Israel
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.360]  and I mean all this is brewing and the mainstream media is too busy talking
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:08.080]  about what Zimmer and Zimmerman ate for breakfast it's a juice maybe they could
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:13.720]  use those big bear strategic bombers to drop white people on Israel maybe and
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:18.200]  go into the gulags as a response but yeah I think it's amazing that we have
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:21.840]  this a brewing of World War three if not something else a global conflict
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:26.000]  potentially or most likely right out of the Bible yeah yeah exactly it is
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.640]  biblical proportions I mean if Russia were to attack Israel as it's written
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:34.080]  in revelations and so on I mean we all know what may happen and it may it may
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.280]  mean that we're closer to you know certain scenarios than we previously
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:41.120]  thought I mean this is massive breaking news and you did cover it up on info
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:45.480]  wars.com when I originally wrote on story leak so that you info wars and
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.400]  story leak we're the only ones actually even talking about this besides the
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.920]  Israeli National Post it's a complete spin article on it though that Russia's
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:55.880]  evil for responding to their blowing up of their missiles which they instigated
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:00.400]  it but then it goes into the question really if Russia was to go up against
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.280]  Israel the United States would undoubtedly back Israel and then you
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:09.200]  actually have a world war scenario now it's not that nothing's happened yet
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.960]  Russia hasn't done anything fully but they have full combat readiness troops
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:17.560]  and strategic bombers ready to go but Israel actually one in a hot war blew
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:22.120]  up their missile system so we're facing so many threats domestically and
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:25.040]  internationally it's hard to keep up with some people you know where it's
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:28.720]  going and everything like that but the fact of the matter is now we're
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:32.360]  struggling against the US military domestically and they're about to go
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:35.640]  potentially fight another war it's a it's a war on all sides against the
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:39.280]  people and the Constitution which is burning and fueling all this like coal
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:43.520]  in the train of tyranny up against the world right now and then we have our
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:48.160]  government putting in hundreds of thousands in the last two years of real
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.520]  al-Qaeda who are engaged in incredible atrocities just starting a war with
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:56.480]  Syria and it's not even in our news and then the Syrian rebels go in of course
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:00.080]  kill all the Christians eat their heart for their power on TV and that's fine
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:03.920]  though I mean that's not a big deal apparently and then we're living in a
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:09.360]  twilight zone world where Vladimir Putin says it's wrong that they're eating
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.560]  hearts on TV and our media criticizes him and I don't live in Russia I've never
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:16.760]  been to Russia I'm not a fan of the Russian system but Russia is not here
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.600]  taking my country over foreign banks have hijacked my country they're force
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.840]  feeding us GMO they're trying to force vaccines on us they're trying to start
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.960]  race wars what what do you think is the method to Goldman Sachs JP Morgan
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.600]  madness because that's who runs it well let me tell you something interesting
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.920]  here this is actually from Bloomberg but it goes into an NBC report taxpayers
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:41.400]  fund the mega banks with 83 billion dollars per year okay that works from
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.880]  the mega bailouts and different leveraging since a lot more than that
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:47.160]  it did that's just one funding that's just on paper okay that's just the very
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:52.360]  minimal amount 83 billion publicly on paper but the QE 3 is 87 billion a month
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.400]  oh it all stacks up way higher but this is just the taxpayer dollars here 83
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.080]  billion that goes into the government funding that ultimately goes to the
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:04.200]  banks but then NBC reports that it was in the back of the news I found it had
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:09.280]  about 12 shares on Facebook that the banks then take that cash and use it to
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:14.080]  finance the Mexican drug cartels publicly 100% and terror cells known
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:18.000]  terror cells inside the United States yet we still continue to fund them with
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.920]  83 billion and the more amounts of cash that you're talking about every single
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.560]  year so what's going on and that's apparently they claim that's pretty much
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.240]  all of their profits I don't need to respond to any of that I can just call
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.280]  you racist you could and I obviously am because I'm against big banks and tyranny
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.920]  of all kinds and also I'm against racial profiling which is what's happening I
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:40.200]  mean when Rachel Gentel goes on Pierce Morgan and says certain things they just
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.080]  clap because she's black and that's the problem she said he was obviously a gay
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:47.840]  rapist a gay a gay pervert and Nancy Gray says that you know he's a top
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.200]  there were men's a Taco Bell loving churro eating you know blank and I mean
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.760]  that's perfectly fine though you can insult Zimmerman because he's a he's a
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:59.760]  white Hispanic so that's perfectly fine I tell you what's bizarre about this is
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:06.040]  the I mean when you look at Nancy Gray she's like a cartoon character and all
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:12.160]  she spews it why is she allowed to basically call call Zimmerman a racist
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:15.560]  name towards Hispanics I guess anything to whip things up I guess that's the
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:18.960]  mission well the real question is where are the Hispanics why don't they care
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.760]  about this George Zimmerman is a Hispanic and when you say yeah he goes
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:25.600]  through Taco Bell and eats churros every night that is racist if I were to go up
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.840]  and say yeah Trayvon loves watermelon and fried chicken do you know what would
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:32.480]  happen you know what might happen just cuz I made a reference to that but she
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.000]  can say that Zimmerman loves Taco Bell and churros and use race baiting and so
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.280]  on and so forth and salon can go out and use the same thing but we're not
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.000]  allowed to talk about that simply because I guess we're in the right and we
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  have logic on our side and anyone that makes any sense isn't allowed to use a
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.400]  counter argument to this race baiting but see that's what it does and we're
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:54.440]  not discussing all the scandals the IRS gate the NSA gate telling pro-life
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:59.240]  groups what they can pray that that's on record that's how authoritarian this is
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:02.920]  yeah they're chanting hell Satan down at the Texas Capitol little heroes you
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:06.920]  know against the pro-lifers and the answer is let's just have a big race
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:10.600]  fight well and then you're talking about earlier I mean what they are is
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:14.240]  they're shallow if anything they're insulting us saying we're racist and
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:17.280]  dumb they're making it about race and they're coming down to the point where
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:22.080]  it's about Trayvon being black and oh Zimmerman was a gay rapist racist how
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:25.920]  many things can you pile up on this guy and then they go out and insult the gay
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:28.560]  community you know everyone's all concerned about being politically
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.520]  corrected they're the most politically incorrect well the politically correct
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.920]  are the only ones that can do whatever they want exactly that's the rule it's
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:40.120]  like an animal farm where you know four legs good you know two legs bad it then
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:46.160]  becomes four legs good two legs good then it becomes four legs you know good
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.640]  two legs better then it becomes again two legs good four legs bad and the pigs
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:55.720]  are all now walking around on two feet it's the same thing that's all they've

[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:24.560]  that that showed ill will and hatred open and shut I mean there wasn't even a
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:32.200]  question now that they rewrite revising said he's saying these punks get away
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:39.760]  with it they always get rich how it goes
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:47.760]  ladies and gentlemen we are back with Anthony Gucci arting and he's got a
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:53.760]  great news website but I just follow every day story link dot com link to it
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:58.960]  up on info wars dot com they are trying to invoke everything she can we've got
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:04.440]  the clip of her saying oh he loves his Mexican food every night driving through
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:09.720]  Taco Bell what does that even mean and invoking this racial word that clearly
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:13.240]  audio doesn't say but again it just shows how they can change the whole
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:19.240]  subject from the entire world of what's happening on to this to then blame the
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:24.840]  second amendment but also make rights only about race or sex or religion not
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:29.400]  about what about a right to not have a gender 21 shut down our country's
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.720]  industries what about that right yeah exactly and you know the whole
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:35.480]  stand your ground thing isn't even about stand your ground it's about the
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.280]  second amendment they want to get rid of the second amendment entirely they
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:42.600]  said that repeatedly over and over again politicians are completely on board with
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:45.200]  that entire thing I made a documentary about it called this arm for your
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:49.640]  operation power of your contest and that's the simple reality is that this is
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:53.000]  not even about Trayvon Martin at the heart of it and certain ways it's really
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.200]  about ending the ability to own a weapon look at Obama he said Trayvon Martin
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:01.120]  could have been his son well I think the media used the 12-year-old Trayvon
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.520]  Martin but if you look at the actual 17-year-old Trayvon Martin if that was
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:08.400]  Obama's son there's definitely something wrong there no question and it's
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.400]  ultimately been about a war on the Constitution and that's why we have a
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:16.960]  hundred mile Constitution free zones as done by the DHS that extend beyond the
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:20.480]  quote-unquote border including the oceans that swallows Philadelphia Houston
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:23.760]  over a hundred million people where they don't have the fourth amendment
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:26.760]  fourth amendment right so they can search your belongings at any time so you
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:29.400]  go down to Houston around here you don't have your fourth amendment right the
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:34.120]  DHS can quote-unquote legally stop you and search your stuff the Constitution
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:39.480]  does not apply in Houston according to the DHS that's admitted amazing I want to
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:44.680]  shift gears to Rolling Stone Boston bomber cover sparks outrage that's from
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:51.000]  the London Telegraph and it says that Zohar Zarnaev has been featured on the
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.600]  front cover of Rolling Stone magazine sparking an outcry on social media that
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:00.120]  that they're implying that he's a hero well that's not even the big issue for
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:06.920]  me it's that it says the bomber the bomber this guy's pled not guilty they're
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.640]  on tape going don't shoot we didn't do it they clearly wanted to kill the other
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:15.360]  brother they've shot the friend in the top of the head FBI agents involved have
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:20.720]  been falling out of helicopters we know there was a drill and his brother was
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:25.160]  working for the CIA this is all come out and then I've got a clip coming up
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:31.880]  after the break where the five last Friday said anybody that says free him
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:34.600]  or investigate he's innocent because they're acting like people are saying
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:38.440]  free him he's a hero no the group saying free him or our listeners who've done
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:41.640]  the research I've been contacted by their lawyers they're trying to get a hold of
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.840]  him I mean it's clear he is a patsy they shot that boat up trying to kill him and
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:51.360]  then the media got cameras on it so they couldn't he got out and there was 500
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:55.320]  bullet holes or more in it and then he suddenly talking next his throats cut
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:59.480]  out but who knows what he's going through and he says not guilty and it's
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:03.360]  like how oh how dare him try to get a free trial what do you think's going on
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:07.440]  with this okay here's the reality of this 100% and I was right with you from day
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.920]  one covering the Boston bombings up all night literally two nights in a row
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:14.560]  covering this stuff because I find that when you watch the news at 2 a.m. you get
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:18.160]  the real information and that's the bottom line but the fact is they're
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:22.760]  using Sarnab to basically go after this anti-hero and sure they're putting it
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:25.640]  on the cover and that is encouraging more people to go and kill people but
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:29.400]  like you said the main thing is that when they locked down in Boston I had
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:33.000]  readers actually sending me live feeds of troops coming to their house and stuff
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.160]  like that when they locked down Boston and went on this witch hunt for the
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:40.160]  brothers what happened was people actually started cheering the abandonment
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:43.520]  of the legal system the abandonment of the Constitution and that's exactly what
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:47.560]  they want and Politico says now that's a routine thing that cities will routinely
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:51.800]  be shut down now to search for terrorists so what's happened is people are now
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:56.160]  applauding in a 1984 like scenario they're clapping they're screaming they're
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.560]  so happy please take away our Constitution to get and that's the
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:04.080]  Psyop they really Psyop that and then project that idea to then sell the rest
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:08.120]  of it and now police oh fireworks got shot off in Las Vegas we'll shut down
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:11.200]  your whole neighborhood and search your houses they're setting that precedent
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.440]  well did you see that one city with the image that a reader had sent to me
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:17.960]  actually and you guys posted up it was it went viral on your website info wars

[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:49.360]  five o'clock yesterday by Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs who was really good
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:53.840]  friends with the Rolling Stone Associate Editor whose car blew up three four
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:35:00.120]  weeks ago in Los Angeles and he went to the funeral he's friends with the wife
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:04.760]  Mrs. Hastings who was a speechwriter for Connelly's Arise by the way and works
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:10.120]  in the Bush White House and he's this big award-winning reporter and you've got
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:15.640]  the whole story about what happened to him that I won't repeat but he said I'm
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:19.680]  going into hiding they're coming after me we got feds visiting friends family
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:24.960]  they're probably gonna raid Buzzfeed get a lawyer a biggest story ever CIA I'm
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:31.200]  going underground to break it car blows up 4 a.m. the wife goes to the funeral and
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:35.640]  tells Staff Sergeant Biggs I'm gonna bring these people down she called him
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:38.480]  up yesterday and I'm out of liberty to tell all of it because I announced I was
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.320]  gonna send Biggs pay for it he didn't have the money he's in college out of
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:46.200]  the military after eight years or whatever and I was gonna send investigative
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:50.160]  journalist Wayne Madsen there and I was gonna send David Knight there and Rob
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:55.920]  Jacobson there she called up she was texting and texting going don't do this
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:00.760]  respect my wishes don't come investigate then he calls their numbers
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.320]  he's crying in the background her friend answers so she's crying just please
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:09.040]  don't do this there's no doubt they've been threatened and he said that when
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.840]  you went to the funeral the friends of the family like oh we're scared no the
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:16.920]  feds did come we're not gonna say who because they see the feds on TV saying
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:21.200]  we never visited them they know they came they're freaked out they know I
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:24.920]  mean she thinks they killed him and then she's so scared I guess for her child
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:29.360]  do you do you respect her we're gonna give it a week we're gonna see what
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:35.080]  happens but it's not just about her husband it's about journalist and the
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:40.640]  media and it's about you know just cuz she says stand down or just cuz she says
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:45.240]  don't come do this cuz she's scared do does everybody have to back down and
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:49.160]  then where's the media they clearly blew his car up they're coming after me I'm
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.480]  going to hide him because forever boom and then now they're suppressing the
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:57.320]  police report and they did cremate the body without permission that's illegal
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:04.880]  they I mean so so Anthony Gutiarty what is your take on this exclusive here I've
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:07.840]  never talked about this before but I'm going to do it because when you said
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:12.640]  that this story pretty much sent chills down my spine during the Boston bombings
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:16.360]  I was in communication with the guy who told the Alabama media order because
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:19.840]  news news post I don't know what it's called Alabama.org or something he
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:23.480]  said there was a drill on the day of the Boston bombing yeah that was the TV
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:26.840]  station right the TV station but he told actually we talked to him and he got
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:30.280]  threatened right no I yeah I did the interview with him I did the exclusive I
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:33.440]  called his cell phone I did like three hours of research online I got a cell
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:37.920]  phone from a college basketball thing or something I called him he all of the
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:42.680]  of all the people BBC NBC CBS he called me back I don't even know why but he did
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:45.920]  and he called me back and I did the report with them I put it on YouTube
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.960]  that's right yeah I've got a ton of views and you featured and everything like
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:52.080]  that but I'll tell you what I emailed him again and I said hey you know I would
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:55.400]  like to talk more about this this is a huge breaking news I actually asked if
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:58.760]  you would go on your show and everything I remember yeah he says I can't talk about
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:02.360]  that anymore I don't know I'm not ever talking about that again please take down
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:06.000]  the interview don't ever talk about that ever again and the college emailed me
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.320]  and asked me to take the video down everything like that and I responded I
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:12.360]  said you know what happened did did you get threatened you can talk about it
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.320]  because they might actually kill you if you don't actually go and speak about it
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:18.760]  and the college person said don't ever talk to us again you're a conspiracy
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:23.760]  theorist Alistair is no longer speaking to any of you guys and remember he told
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:27.920]  the TV station that he told a radio station that and then you had more to
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:31.920]  tell and he obviously got threatened he obviously got threatened and what's
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:35.160]  amazing is he wasn't some conspiracy theorist as they would have you believe
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.880]  he said that he was so happy there was bomb sniffing dogs there and everything
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:42.040]  and violating the Constitution because he wanted to catch the terrorists and we
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:46.040]  now know there was a drill before that day and they had one planned also or a
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:50.040]  patriot group was gonna bomb it exactly and that's one of the things I covered
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:53.760]  to from the Boston Globe in the back of the paper I found it had one Facebook
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:57.440]  share none of these things are ever shared or no one talks about it they had a
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:01.320]  fake group called Free American Citizens I believe it was nothing worse than them
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:04.840]  and they were supposed to blow up the whole entire thing and kill everybody
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:08.120]  and they ran multiples they were going to run multiple drills of that exact
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:11.520]  scenario they were going to use backpacks with amateur explosives to kill
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:15.800]  everyone and then I literally say that I say this is from the Boston Globe you
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:20.480]  put on info wars.com and people trash us and say that we're talking about drills
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:24.360]  that don't exist it's but it turns out they did a drill of the Boston Marathon
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:28.760]  bomb two years before they were doing drills before of it being bombed and
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:32.480]  then now we learn there was the Patriot group that's if they got caught they
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:35.720]  were gonna run with that as the cover it's always the same story and everyone
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:39.400]  was everything was leading up to a right-wing extremist groups remember they
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:42.720]  had the guy at the at the courthouse it's him we were right it's and then all
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:46.000]  the sudden they surround it with armored vehicles and so they could sneak the guy
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.400]  out go that's not it we're going with another plan CNN then they saw these
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:53.080]  out of the river and the CNN analyst on that day said it has to be a right-wing
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:56.760]  extremist everything was set to the point to where it was going to be blamed
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:02.680]  on a right-wing stream how mad do you think we are how mad do you think the
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:06.120]  globalists are gonna get if we continue to expose them they are going to lose
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:10.040]  ultimately I mean teaming up and coming together these alternative news sources
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:13.000]  like we've never seen before no bickering no wasting time in fighting
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.440]  garbage we're coming together we're just blasting them I mean we're hitting them
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:19.720]  like a train right now I mean they can't even handle it the mainstream media is
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:23.600]  so irrelevant how mad do you think they are when what we call the Kraken in
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:27.200]  fact will you hand me that Anthony right there that painting I've never shown this
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:30.880]  on air before I apologize since I'm gonna bring this up now for TV viewers
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:36.560]  this is the Kraken ladies and gentlemen sent to us by an artist because I had
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:40.440]  dubbed Dan Badan to our East Coast reporter as the Kraken in class of the
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:43.640]  Titans they say release the Kraken when he went and took over three press
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:49.280]  conferences they had secret service come on video and threaten him he said I'm
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:53.480]  not afraid and didn't back off how angry do you think the globalist are that we
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:57.280]  absolutely took that over from them probably about as angry as that loser
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:00.840]  kid who screamed at Dan for actually trying to go and reporting something
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:04.200]  that was real but I think Dan did an awesome job on that and a lot of
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:07.280]  exclusive information that we've never otherwise would have known if you didn't
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:11.520]  go out there and it's sad though think about this Dan of Info Wars was the only
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:14.320]  guy to ask any real questions if we didn't have Info Wars we didn't have
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:18.280]  other alternative news groups where would we be oh no the FBI pointed their
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:22.680]  fingers at over a hundred reporters and said you don't look at anything else and
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:27.240]  you know what they did what they were told they all do no one's covering
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:33.440]  Hastings I mean this is crazy thank God we're so alive though well let me tell
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:36.600]  you something I've been on mainstream media before and it is literally all
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:40.360]  scripted they'd sit down I came in here we came right in we talked we didn't even
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:43.200]  talk really about what we're gonna talk about it's just all boom boom boom you
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:45.840]  know mainstream media they'll sit you down say what are you gonna talk about
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:49.120]  okay specifically what points are you gonna talk about and if they don't like
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:52.080]  something now that we're not gonna talk about that oh yeah welfare like they did
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:55.680]  with Pierce on you they'll cut you off air if you're not following the script if
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.880]  you're not following the monologue of BS and garbage and spewing you know
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:03.560]  illiterate dogma then you're off the air period and they're not gonna have you
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:06.600]  back on even though the ratings are super good and people want real
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:09.520]  information which they do crave and that's why we have record views of all
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:12.840]  these mainstream alternative news sites in the mainstream media yeah according to
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:16.600]  Gallup the trust is pretty much dead and the viewership is dying no one watches
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:20.960]  it so what do you expect to happen now they're gonna go from propaganda power
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:24.560]  and they admit the CA is operating domestically with brainwashing now just
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:28.800]  repealed that law it was already dead what are they going to do though is
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:33.000]  everyone knows that literally foreign offshore banks run the country they run
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.220]  the paramilitary hit teams they run the drugs they run the white slavery they
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:42.000]  run the stuff films all on record every horrible vice and they are terrorist I
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.120]  mean what's going to happen as we all know I guess they think they're gonna go
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:48.920]  directly to troops well I mean what's already happening with the mainstream
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:52.840]  media you're talking about is they're becoming a really really fake version of
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:57.080]  info wars look at Bloomberg they're releasing actual content that is about
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.520]  one one millionth of the truth and they go like I was talking about earlier they
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:03.480]  released a piece that yeah we fund the magic mega banks with eighty three
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:06.600]  billion dollars a year and why do we do that in reality it's trillions but they
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:09.800]  talk about the 83 billion publicly so then it gets people a little mad the
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:12.720]  Occupy Wall Street stuff but nothing really happens they don't go into why
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:16.200]  we're funding the bankers they don't go into the Federal Reserve system they
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:20.400]  don't go into eugenics which happened to sterilize 60,000 people from 1929 to
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:23.360]  about the I believe it was the fact and that's a whitewash too they just came
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:27.320]  out California still doing it yeah so it all happens anyway it's also the GMOs
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:29.560]  everything which we could talk about but the fact of the matter is they're
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:33.960]  becoming a light fake phony version of the alternative news but it's not going
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:38.320]  to work everyone can see that that's right we forced them now into disclosure
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:43.600]  you know 15 years after okay we license plate scan you everywhere okay there's a
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:47.520]  few cancer viruses in that shot big deal breaking news break on ton ton pull it

[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:09.240]  20 years after it happened and you know yeah sure some of the politicians are
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:13.560]  corrupt oh sure Kissinger wanted to overthrow America get rid of the Bill
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:18.080]  of Rights big deal maybe we should it's racist and also they cover certain
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.600]  things specifically after you forced them to do it on info wars and I come
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:25.640]  or drudge yeah well drudge is an awesome way to for example the girl that was
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:30.400]  harassed and literally beaten by the six alcohol agents what a useful job of
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:34.720]  the state for buying water for buying water she went and I covered that because
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:38.200]  I found it on this random blog and I said this is this true and I looked it up
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:41.200]  and it was actually sourced from mainstream media and this was old news no
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:44.320]  one that I've talked to it at all I covered it you guys posted it gets up
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:47.760]  on I guess it was drudge and then everyone's talking about it's on every
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:50.680]  single talk show I was listening to Austin radio the other day and they were
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:53.920]  talking about it we are literally no no no so many mornings I tuned into local
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:57.880]  radio and they're covering my stories and they know our story no no credit no
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:00.920]  credit all I know how that feels no one ever credits you because they want to
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:04.800]  act like oh the mainstream media is hip and relevant right guys we can make
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:08.360]  interesting news too but they steal all their news and then they put a spin on
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:12.280]  it they said oh it was these liberal alcohol agents that go and attack this
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:15.720]  conservative girl where are you getting that from it's tyranny all see they have
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:20.200]  to make it look it's the same thing left right or black white it's always about
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:24.120]  dividing like this happened bad because they're part of the bad group and they
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:27.440]  don't even use words anymore it's just all it should we the mission the same
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:31.760]  alcohol cops in the same state went after that black rapper I forget his name
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:36.680]  we had him on yeah and he was buying the Arnold Palmer T and they did the same
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:39.640]  deal the truth is they just do that they just have nothing else to do they said
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:43.640]  there were six of them six a federal I guess it was stayed actually stayed
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:47.600]  alcohol but it's yeah they sell the alcohol there yeah so they sit around
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:51.080]  six of them at this place like a convenience store and they have nothing
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:54.960]  better to do the girl had was in a car and they bashed her window in it started
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:58.400]  just assaulting her and just like freaking out why not and then she says
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:02.240]  hey wait a minute let me roll down my window they arrest her and they charge
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:05.240]  her with two felonies assaulting a police officer and something else I think
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:08.160]  she should be given the death penalty she should be killed and what happened is
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:12.120]  ultimately someone reasonable in the government went and said hey this is a
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:15.800]  prosecutor yeah but the alcohol agent said no she still should be hit with
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:19.280]  those two felonies they are ruthless they don't give a crap and police officers
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:25.160]  email no wait a minute they care they care I mean they care because they want
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:28.640]  to hurt her it's not just they don't care no no no they want to hurt her and
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:32.160]  put her in prison for life they want to ruin her life for buying LaCroix water
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:37.840]  to go to for a fundraiser for disabled kids yeah help their scum well you know
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:41.520]  what it really is and not all cops are bad we know that yes but the fact is I
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:45.680]  get a lot of emails and news tips that steroid use and all these drugs are just
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:48.440]  rampant in the police force and these agents and everything like that and
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:52.640]  they're just dosing up ten times the amount that even bodybuilders do so I
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:56.120]  mean they're just going into complete rage going crazy you know happens to your
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:59.280]  mind from a health perspective when you do that it just completely makes you
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:02.840]  insane like literally when I start exercising a lot I get more aggressive
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:07.280]  naturally I couldn't imagine take a time to thousand I mean people have been on
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:10.120]  steroids for various reasons maybe health reasons they might know what we're
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:14.520]  talking about you know the prescribed anabolic yeah exactly but the fact is
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:17.560]  that these people are dosed up on so much stuff not just steroids we're talking
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:20.840]  coke anything they can confiscate and do it real quick from these guys but you
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:24.880]  also talk about the training where it's instant shooting yeah which is good to
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:28.240]  save your life unless the guy gets out with his wallet you shoot him and they
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:32.120]  go well he thought the wallet was a gun and we see this all the time now well
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:36.040]  there's no question is by design but you can fuel this further by advocating the
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:39.000]  use of these drugs and and which it's trickle down tyranny as Mike Adams would
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:46.880]  say they had the the police chief of four of Fort Worth a few years ago come
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:51.000]  out and say we all need to take steroids yeah it's a it's a great thing there was
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.480]  even a documentary that everyone should take steroids because they're perfectly
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:56.720]  fine and then the guy's brother died and he retracted the statement but I mean
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:00.880]  it's it's amazing how the advocacy is basically do anything that's great for
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:04.000]  you you are God you are amazing and the government is the only thing that's
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.520]  hard well that's the thing everybody I know basically goes to the doctor now
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:10.440]  they go you know what you need is a bunch of steroids we're hormones you got
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:14.400]  it's synthetic hormones and then they turn insane and go crazy and then what
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:18.840]  do you do you put them on SSRIs it's a whole entire system that it that you
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:21.920]  can go to the government as your dad you want some birth control pay for me
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:24.600]  please let me go out and have promiscuous sex with whoever I want the
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:27.840]  government will take care of me if I don't want the kid get rid of it or if
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:30.480]  I'm feeling bad I'll go to the pharmaceutical companies and free

[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:12.880]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:31.880]  I'm actually glad that the mainstream media Anthony is really starting to
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:36.920]  finally cover that there's licensed light scanning cameras up everywhere the
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:40.720]  tracking everything we're doing but people are now starting to say hey I
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:44.560]  want that for my trial or I want to use that to prove I haven't done
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:48.400]  something they're like oh no that's not for you so it just shows how it's a
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:52.760]  totally rigged system and we're now learning how hopelessly corrupt the
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:56.040]  system is do you think they'll get away with it no I don't and what's
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:59.320]  interesting is it shows that we've already won the fact that the mainstream
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:03.200]  media is forced to pick up on these alternative news pieces even though they
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.280]  do spin it and you know make it into their own kind of fake left-right system
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:11.280]  etc etc the fact is we've already won by making them cover it and as far as this
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:16.000]  Orwellian system goes just consider the fact that Verizon and T-Mobile are
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.040]  getting paid massive amounts of cash from the NSA and the FBI for letting them
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:24.760]  spy on your phone so they have actually a public obligation as far as their
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:28.920]  shareholders are concerned to let the NSA and the FBI spy on people they're
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:33.800]  getting like $500 a month to initiate a wiretap from the NSA this is in a new
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:37.440]  report and they're getting about $50 just for your little cell phone they get
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:41.200]  about $50 more than you pay for your bill they're getting from the NSA and the
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:45.480]  FBI to the point where it accumulates to about 500 million of revenue profit
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:48.240]  pure profit they don't have to do anything for these companies and they
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:52.480]  have about 90 employees so I think of Verizon at 30 or 90 and by the way that's
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:55.920]  just when they want to finally use it in court or something they're already
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:00.920]  spying on everything then they get the official FISA roving you know mass wire
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:05.240]  tap when they go to the next level sure but this is a pure product profit
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:09.000]  motivation to spy on people but also yeah they go directly to the servers for
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.840]  all this kind of stuff and there's oh yeah and they've been paid billions a
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:16.000]  year to put the grids in the buildings let's go to a call here Alan in
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.160]  Delaware thanks for holding her on the air
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:24.200]  well Alex I just want to say that you know Michael Hastings was on to
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:29.920]  something look the beltway is swarming every third car in rush hour is

[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:10.600]  milk it's like like they dress up in black uniforms so then you're bad you

[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:20.960]  you noticed what I'm talking about it's almost like a dress up with government
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:25.760]  like like they announced the fantasy and then we all play along with it yes it's
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:31.360]  just weird worship of this concept that anything they deem to be incorrect or
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:35.640]  wrong and it's always it's they're always wrong but anything they say it's
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:40.640]  always you're a suspect you you you what do you say for yourself yeah or three
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:45.720]  American thinkers they call themselves info wars they make it seem so spooky and
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:50.160]  weird everything this wrap they say the government might not be trusted oh how
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:56.520]  crazy yeah exactly or they'll say they say that Russia has 160,000 troops ready
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:02:01.440]  for combat when it's actually happening 100% or the commenters will be the the
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:04.680]  people buy into it too though they'll comment and say there's no proof of this
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:08.440]  when you link to CNN you link to Israeli oh no it's like here's the company that
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:12.000]  has the targets for children to shoot them and here they are admitting
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.080]  Homeland Security ordered them shut up liar that they never do that yeah it's
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:19.520]  almost like it they obviously are the ones who are mentally ill and often on
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:22.680]  SSRIs and stuff like that but then they're saying that we're crazy for
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:26.080]  literally we could copy paste articles sometimes you guys post up articles from
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:30.240]  mainstream news and they insult you they say Alex this is crazy when at the top
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:33.840]  it's linked to CNN they don't even know how to basically click on some stuff and
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:37.360]  a lot of people are informed but the fact is that they'll trash us is it's all
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:41.280]  perceived it's fake perception they can go on your site info wars right now and
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:44.640]  there will be an article up from a mainstream news organization and there
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:48.840]  will be comments you can read where it says Alex you're making this up you're
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:52.000]  crazy your writers are making this up when it's from a mainstream news so well
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.320]  that's what may be made up is from them but the point is is that a lot of those
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:59.320]  are trolls they know it's real yeah they'll just say that because it's their
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:02.760]  job sure but there is a percentage of the population that literally buys into
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:05.760]  every single thing that the government says in the mainstream media mouth
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:10.160]  propaganda theater piece what are they going to do as everything it's taken away
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:14.440]  from them I think cling even more to the new world orders yeah I mean so it's as
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:18.480]  you always say some Zimbabwean or whatever scams you your $90,000 in
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:21.200]  it's also marketing I've studied marketing for pretty much all my life
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:25.040]  the number one thing you do is you never make people think about the exit you
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:28.240]  sell them something and then when they're already invested in buying it when
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:31.560]  they're about to click check out for example there must be no distractions
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:34.840]  we're here blowing the whistle and saying all this kind of stuff and they're
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:37.720]  trying to ignore us as much as they possibly can so that we don't get in
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:41.760]  their heads I've had two people that I knew flip out and not associate with me
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:46.120]  when I said listen this Nigerian email scam is a scam when you send Prince
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:51.640]  Abu Bu or a BP or whatever it is the $4,000 they'll say oh the prince is
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:55.480]  ready to talk to you he needs 10,000 more it's like the prince wants to talk
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:59.440]  to me and then and then and I go okay you're gonna get ripped off and then
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:02.920]  later they're like you're just jealous that I know the prince well I go did you
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:08.680]  get your money back shut up I know Prince up baby how do you think they feel
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:12.080]  when they call the DHS and they think they're talking to Janet Napolitano a
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:15.120]  high level they're like celebrities because people worship celebrities now
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:18.400]  they worship governments the same thing they call and they say I saw someone who
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:22.480]  is doing something weird and they had an info worst calm bumper sticker those are
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:25.760]  the same people they feel the same way as if they're invested in in this weird
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:29.360]  kind of system they think they are celebrities when they become it just
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:32.160]  like when you go to a show and you see someone in a rock concert these five
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:35.280]  feet away from me that's how they feel when they snitch on you it's a reflected
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:39.040]  glory it's like the celebrity thing of SWAT teams and everybody's got to be in
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:43.200]  a SWAT team yeah I mean it literally is a bunch of little kids
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:48.320]  toddling around doing whatever they want and anyone else is racist they're five
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:51.320]  years old their mind is so small it's been it's been reduced and then they
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:54.240]  just go I don't like government-run healthcare racist I don't want to hurt

[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:41.680]  totally illegal but why not just do it I mean why not so secretly spying on us
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:45.480]  so was having a CIA being involved in domestic propaganda they were already
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:50.840]  doing it but now now it's out in the open and now Rolling Stone says the guy
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:55.440]  that's pled not guilty is the bomber it's just you just go directly to jail and
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:59.960]  this just broke it info wars comm and prison planet comm federal court

[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:14.000]  mean they're lawful and so land of the free home of the brave the only country
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.840]  in the world that actually has stuff like this on the books right now North
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:23.360]  Korea doesn't have stuff like this on the books only land of the kidnapped home
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:27.240]  of the fluoridated yeah where the Constitution doesn't exist as I said in
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:31.160]  most major cities now LA Houston Philadelphia from DHS they they actually
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:34.800]  said we're gonna review it okay we're gonna review it four years after we were
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:38.200]  requested to review it when legally underlaw you have to review it within 90
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:41.760]  days but they did four years later and they said we determined that it's
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:45.120]  perfectly fine because the Constitution doesn't apply at the borders which is a
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:48.400]  hundred mile zone throughout the entire United States if you would imagine well
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:52.560]  everything you're doing is okay because Obama is black and if you don't he's the
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:56.520]  government so you're racist well that's one thing that I don't know how we're
[02:09:56.520 --> 02:10:01.640]  gonna beat honestly if they had a black female gay president what can you do you
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:05.280]  can't I mean Obama's bad but can you imagine you can't insult Trayvon
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:10.680]  anything about Trayvon what what it was a transvestite black white no no no
[02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:17.520]  hermaphrodite hermaphrodite black gay you know whatever it's someone like that
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:20.760]  what are you gonna do you can't say anything because if you had an opinion
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:23.480]  on the drapes that the White House had be racist you can't you're not allowed to
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:27.440]  judge characteristics you're not allowed to judge achievements goals anything
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:31.480]  accomplishment it's just if you saw a hermaph a black and white hermaphrodite
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:35.960]  you just fall down you better work in England they've got three parent babies
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:44.120]  now yeah you could have like a 10 parent baby like Asian Hispanic black white and
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:48.480]  then part part animal or something because then you're anti-animal if you
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:51.000]  if you don't like it well you know it goes back to this whole thing you're
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:54.480]  talking about laws that aren't actually legal well the fact is the legal system
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:57.240]  we can't really win with that people ask all the time why don't you just sue the
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:00.560]  government why don't you just sue the FDA why don't you sue the FBI whatever the
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:04.640]  laws are written so everything they do they're giving GMOs immunity now yeah
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:08.040]  they're giving GMOs immunity and we'll talk about their report just imagine if
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:10.920]  they're classifying you as a terrorist putting you on a watch list
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:14.840]  surveilling everything you do if you're against GMOs which most people are I
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:19.040]  mean 92% the 94% of all the people in the United States according to the
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:22.840]  Gallup polls say they're in favor of at least GMO labeling let alone a ban
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:26.320]  well they're they're racist that's low tier I mean they're obviously racist
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:29.920]  against I guess you know who knows what GMOs well they're racist against grass
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:33.120]  hoppers because they put grasshopper genes in some of the corn and they put
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:38.040]  the and and they put pesticides a bacterial pesticide grows naturally in
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:41.680]  it and kills them I mean that's racist that racist against bacteria sure but
[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:45.680]  that's nothing now they have biopharms by 2017 it's gonna be 17 billion dollar
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:49.400]  industry according to analysts where they actually grow the AIDS vaccine every
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:52.480]  single type of experimental vaccine in the crops they say it's more efficient
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:56.280]  and that openly blows around yeah which they admit could cause mass death but
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:59.200]  if you're against that you're racist and the US get if you're against abortion
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:01.800]  you're racist yeah if you're against abortion which kills you know hundreds
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:04.640]  of millions of black kids specifically targets the black children if you had
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:07.640]  you've had the black genus that's spoken like a cracker racist yeah of course
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:10.880]  obviously because we actually care about the black people we care about the kids
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:13.680]  that are being killed oh you want to kill Trayvon racist and you know when you
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:17.520]  crackerhead crackerhead we can get into the whole abortion one small tiny
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:21.480]  fragment of it is when you allow the killing of these children it allows
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:24.200]  these crazy people that we're talking about earlier that just are in love with
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:27.480]  the system they don't care if it's after birth or not Obama says after birth
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:30.320]  abortions are great well they're now saying kill babies up to age three you
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:32.800]  have to and if you're against that you're a cracker so at what point is a
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:36.240]  life valuable if we can get into that whole debate at age 20 or is my life
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:39.200]  valuable most people who knows Obama would probably say no is your life
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:42.600]  valuable at what age as a person I'll put that article up there's a cracker a
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:46.520]  white guy trying to say that 60% of black babies are aborted I thought it was
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:51.200]  52% but it's that that's saying 60 here's look at it he's a racist I mean
[02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:56.160]  obviously look at that racist he's white get that red that the FCC will shut us
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:59.680]  down putting a white person on TV oh but what are you doing putting a racist on
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:03.120]  there but you know what a black person says it like the black genocide guy he's
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:06.320]  a he's a race hater that's what it is you don't want to kill blacks he's right
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:09.720]  you can even be racist when you're black saying don't kill black people that's
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:15.000]  racist now if you're black racist yeah so in parenthood loves me it's not racist
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.640]  though if you want to kill all the 60 you know 100 million whatever black kids if
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:22.960]  you want that that's good Pierce Morgan everybody who supports that well well
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:30.000]  the now professor said black people can't be racist says says that kill kill the
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.600]  white children so what's wrong with them it says they need to die white is white
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:38.000]  isn't a race I mean racist is the whole concept of being against a race but
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:42.080]  apparently racist means what blackest you can only be racist against black
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:46.480]  people it doesn't make any sense the whole privilege concept is immune to any
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:50.760]  form of logic reason or any foundation and the whole here's the whole thing it
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:54.280]  breaks down to this we have a foundation of understanding right we have morals
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:57.960]  and principles to which we operate off of understanding of how the world works
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:00.760]  the bankers work and everything like that and more importantly we have
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:04.720]  fundamental morals that we follow these people do not they have no basis so
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:08.320]  logic and everything and reason are not their guide their guide is pure emotional
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:11.080]  response to the mainstream media about what they were just showing I think the
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:15.960]  FBI put out the 1969 coloring book that's racist but that was also a false
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:19.800]  flag of course it was but the FBI went in and they made it and they distributed
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:23.600]  massive amount of copies and then said it was the black Panthers to discredit
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:27.160]  them and make them look racist when the FBI actually made the racist drawings
[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:30.600]  and the racist so they could get rid of the real black Panthers and then bring
[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:33.760]  in the new black panther that works for them that of course they go in and they
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:36.560]  start a bunch of conflicts and rides everything like that but if you saw the
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:39.920]  pictures they show black people in a horrible light and then all the white
[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:43.480]  people are labeled pigs and it says good black children grow up to shoot whites
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:48.640]  and it says all that kind of stuff it says yeah if you're afraid of the pig
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:52.440]  the white pig is afraid of black children because they are whatever and
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:56.120]  those are real those are coloring books for our government pays for that in
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:15:01.080]  Mexico saying the US belongs to Mexico the white is a pig creature yeah Ford
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:04.400]  Foundation so the government is actually racist but we're racist well they're
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:06.920]  not they want to fight with each other sure that's why they're flying around in
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:12.120]  jet copters and you know in 20,000 square foot condos you know penthouses and
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:15.400]  tell the public you're gonna live in a 200 square foot thing or you're
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:18.640]  against the earth which is racist against the earth sure well they want to
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:21.360]  kill everybody but they obviously but I mean that's what that's all about people
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:24.440]  like carbon stickers on their car they're you know they're beating
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:28.920]  themselves on the head going I'm racist it's all about a guilt complex look at
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:32.480]  all the movies like after earth like the whole concept that humans are just
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:36.880]  disgusting creatures and that we are so evil that we have so much privilege and
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:39.520]  we need to understand that we need to go back to the environment by killing
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:43.280]  ourselves and having one child policies and stuff like that it's all pushed to
[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:46.240]  the point where if you go in Austin Austin is a great place but it's also a
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:49.000]  pretty bad place I mean you can go in some of these areas where they'll throw a
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:52.080]  brick through your car because it's not eco-friendly when the hybrid is
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:55.720]  actually oh no that goes on big time but but but here's the issue they've all
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:16:00.040]  destroyed California and they're fleeing here yeah and they don't even know when
[02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:03.920]  they literally go you will do as I say or they come to my wife ago you shouldn't
[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:07.840]  have three kids total cult members and you're like well why have you evacuated
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:12.600]  here then and then they go we made it nice and they don't understand
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:15.920]  California is bankrupt for a reason they come here and they want to bankrupt
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:19.360]  taxes as well they're being racist against Californians yeah I'm against
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:25.240]  trendy racist the race of California is well be a raising of a but fascist it
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:28.400]  really does I'm from Philadelphia though I'm not from Texas I recognize the
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:31.800]  beauty of Texas and I came here for a reason I moved all my businesses here I
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:36.160]  came here with everyone that was racist I current encouraged every racist to come
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.320]  here
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:45.720]  oh hey let's talk to Karen Arizona Karen thanks for holding you're on the air

[02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:03.680]  Carson California and it took three weeks before my the owner or my boss he
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:09.040]  would call and said I have a white driver is it safe they said no it took
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:13.600]  three weeks before he felt comfortable and I felt comfortable to go into the

[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:42.600]  Inglewood and Hawthorne and you know those neighborhoods have never
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:47.880]  recovered completely I know I know let me just say this it's like did you guys

[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:30.160]  if someone goes up and starts beating you if they're a minority you're just
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:33.920]  supposed to let them kill no no no no that's racist you're to slit your own

[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:57.000]  unless it's the government just murdering black women you know in mass
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:01.400]  with african then that's good it's okay for the government for the police to
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:04.240]  have weapons but you know what's always an interesting question to these gun
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:07.120]  grabber people too they say all guns should be banned what should the police
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:10.400]  have guns well yeah of course by the way that we just showed a cartoon where

[02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:35.180]  what that was like when we're being chased by the dune buggy's yeah yeah the
[02:35:35.180 --> 02:35:38.900]  dune buggy's and then the guy jumps out there's light in the fire well the the
[02:35:38.900 --> 02:35:43.220]  scary part about it is you know we get there somebody canceled our our
[02:35:43.220 --> 02:35:48.380]  reservations to the rent car to the to the hotel room that's my broken the
[02:35:48.380 --> 02:35:53.380]  hotel room this is this is what we have and then just so happened a guy drove in
[02:35:53.380 --> 02:35:57.660]  from Texas and met us there and then we're like no we don't want your help
[02:35:57.660 --> 02:36:01.060]  so then later it's here and then he jumps out of the bushes yeah he was like
[02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:04.500]  look at Navy seal I mean it was just like ridiculous what he was he was in the
[02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:08.700]  army but before I think it was the Navy he showed up to Waco too when we
[02:36:08.700 --> 02:36:13.660]  rebuilt Waco there's there's Alex when he was when he I gotta know you're gonna
[02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:18.140]  bring all this stuff you told me you were gonna go over all time yeah yes what
[02:36:18.140 --> 02:36:25.300]  is that Waco Tribune Harold yeah there I am and by the way you know I go to the
[02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:33.780]  memorials every year and this lady from Virginia she started a museum and she
[02:36:33.780 --> 02:36:39.260]  took a old black school in downtown Waco and remodeled it and made a Waco
[02:36:39.260 --> 02:36:43.660]  museum in there but what she's missing is she's missing the rebuilding of the
[02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:47.860]  church so I'm I plan on all this stuff that I have all the pictures the
[02:36:47.860 --> 02:36:52.220]  rebuilding plan on donating that next year that's a good idea or worried it
[02:36:52.220 --> 02:36:56.060]  will be and I think that you need to start a museum for you're the one that
[02:36:56.060 --> 02:36:59.140]  always starts this stuff you're the one with Joe companion we tried to fix his
[02:36:59.140 --> 02:37:02.740]  house and they bulldozed it so we built him a new house where it was your and

[02:37:06.780 --> 02:37:10.180]  have your memorial and next you had us build the Davidians a new church yeah

[02:37:27.300 --> 02:37:32.020]  enough what do you think is the craziest thing we ever did I remember we went to
[02:37:32.020 --> 02:37:35.220]  San Antonio and the Delta Force had done that drill we were thinking in the
[02:37:35.220 --> 02:37:38.500]  bohemian road remember they pulled the gun on you because you wouldn't turn the
[02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:42.940]  video over remember that and then I screamed the whole time I was better
[02:37:42.940 --> 02:37:49.060]  and you can't do this to me screaming but they never did take it take us to
[02:37:49.060 --> 02:37:53.260]  jail that was at Fort Sam Houston wasn't it was on the edge of it yeah they
[02:37:53.260 --> 02:37:55.980]  came off the next week we were videotaping the they blew out all the
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:38:01.940]  windows yeah the Delta Force blue to go hospital or something blew it up yeah yeah

[02:38:47.580 --> 02:38:53.660]  grandpa wall and he started a company in 1947 rental business and he died in
[02:38:53.660 --> 02:39:00.380]  2003 so I my wife and I bought this state and another couple Jim and Joanna
[02:39:00.380 --> 02:39:02.860]  bought a bunch of other property down there I try to talk to you in the
[02:39:02.860 --> 02:39:05.220]  buying this property because let me tell you what's happened in the last three
[02:39:05.220 --> 02:39:09.860]  years I know Mike I don't invest I understand but real estate's a very
[02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:13.620]  good investment because I don't tend to mess with it that I spend more money
[02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:17.340]  numbering and now you know this Gonzales pretty soon I'll be a popper Gonzales is
[02:39:17.340 --> 02:39:21.020]  where the first shot of the Texas independence well I know happened and
[02:39:21.020 --> 02:39:23.980]  that's where the come-and-take-it flag comes from that's where my family lived
[02:39:23.980 --> 02:39:29.820]  we were a very very poor area for 50 years but in the last three years oil
[02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:35.220]  something happened it's called the Eagle share a shell formation but you're a
[02:39:35.220 --> 02:39:41.740]  patient Gonzales and we have a hundred new millionaires in Gonzales and we have
[02:39:41.740 --> 02:39:45.860]  300 new millionaires in DeWitt County which is the county over from us so
[02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:49.340]  here's that here's that order Texas is now the biggest oil producer in the
[02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:54.900]  world it's a 30 year you know we are really booming down in Gonzales now and
[02:39:54.900 --> 02:40:00.180]  I built a motel for the oil people and it's really doing really good here you're
[02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:04.180]  a regular free market terrorist and that's right now let's show the article
[02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:09.260]  here but won't when we bought this stuff it was nearly worthless that's right
[02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:14.540]  now you know we're booming I mean it's a boom town you wouldn't believe I mean
[02:40:14.540 --> 02:40:19.940]  just truck after you're like boss hog now no I'm they call me the slumlord of
[02:40:19.940 --> 02:40:24.060]  Gonzales but that's not true I have no no no you went you went and got buildings
[02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:26.900]  that were falling out nobody wanted me I have fixed this so that's how it works
[02:40:26.900 --> 02:40:30.620]  you build something everybody's mad at you hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[02:40:30.620 --> 02:40:36.300]  of dollars of women and you know going to that we got code inspectors now that
[02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:41.180]  I've been fighting I still fight Alex I fight the city council they're in love
[02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:49.020]  with each other they all vote the same way they tried outlaw garage sales in
[02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:53.700]  Gonzales I've fought him and fought him and fought him and now now they said we
[02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:58.980]  can have three a year but you know and then they outlawed horses in town in the
[02:40:58.980 --> 02:41:02.660]  city limits we've had horses for 200 years in town my wife has a horse to
[02:41:02.660 --> 02:41:06.660]  middle of the country I've been yeah and they tried outlawed horses in town you
[02:41:06.660 --> 02:41:11.260]  got to get a permit now to have a horse in town so I mean I saw that there's
[02:41:11.260 --> 02:41:14.020]  paper when you were fighting that you know I'm I mean we are changing San
[02:41:14.020 --> 02:41:17.500]  Antonio I love that group I love the peaceful street project I'm still in

[02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:40.900]  general when they say I'm secretly funded by the government it's nice and

[02:41:51.660 --> 02:41:56.380]  they say I'm like I'm a solid agent or Vatican but you saw me from nowhere that
[02:41:56.380 --> 02:42:01.740]  they call me from you know I if I wanted to out Alex I could have done that a
[02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:07.660]  long time ago I got major newspapers major was that magazine that called me

[02:42:35.020 --> 02:42:38.820]  Bohemia Grove in my book and I had one the other day was a national show and
[02:42:38.820 --> 02:42:43.180]  all they could try to do was try to talk about it you know try to get me to say
[02:42:43.180 --> 02:42:46.740]  something bad about Alex Jones I told that lady ain't gonna happen and I told
[02:42:46.740 --> 02:42:50.420]  her I told her exactly the way it was that you were a good guy but without
[02:42:50.420 --> 02:42:54.220]  defending from the lies you've seen them firsthand and they call me from
[02:42:54.220 --> 02:42:58.340]  these magazines trying to get me to say stuff I just hang the phone up because
[02:42:58.340 --> 02:43:02.900]  you know they can take anything you say and chop it up and it's just not gonna
[02:43:02.900 --> 02:43:06.140]  happen yeah but I sit around on the internet and there's not gonna be one
[02:43:06.140 --> 02:43:10.740]  word of me saying anything bad no but I mean have you ever seen anything out
[02:43:10.740 --> 02:43:17.100]  there that was true is what I'm saying no I mean you make mistakes just like the
[02:43:17.100 --> 02:43:20.780]  rest of us you're you're a human being but that's what we want to see we want
[02:43:20.780 --> 02:43:25.420]  to see you make him mistakes you're not here's something else here here let's
[02:43:25.420 --> 02:43:30.140]  look at some of these old Texan photos here there's your grandpa and when did
[02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:35.700]  he die couple two thousand three now here the go ahead though my grandma died
[02:43:35.700 --> 02:43:41.340]  in 2001 he died in 2003 he started the business in 2000 he had a farm believe
[02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:46.020]  or not I could have bought all of cheap side for about 250 thousand dollars
[02:43:46.020 --> 02:43:49.500]  that's where this oil booms going on just south of Gonzales now it's worth
[02:43:49.500 --> 02:43:55.140]  about 250 billion so I mean this is a kind of opportunity it's going on down
[02:43:55.140 --> 02:44:00.060]  and I remember you tried to get me I try even before your grandpa tried to get me
[02:44:00.060 --> 02:44:04.660]  to buy that because I wanted to make it where patriots could go and have my
[02:44:04.660 --> 02:44:09.260]  lucky charm I should have listened to you but but you know I do have some
[02:44:09.260 --> 02:44:15.140]  investors Jim and Joanna that their listeners are yours that did invest in
[02:44:15.140 --> 02:44:19.220]  Gonzales and bought some of my grandpa's property because I didn't buy the whole
[02:44:19.220 --> 02:44:23.180]  estate I just bought a part of the state and they bought some other houses and
[02:44:23.180 --> 02:44:28.540]  those houses went up a lot in value now and now we got oil people there that
[02:44:28.540 --> 02:44:31.740]  have nowhere to go we got hundreds of people coming into town and nowhere to
[02:44:31.740 --> 02:44:37.300]  rent again folks he is the real Barney Fife in the flesh the good Barney five

[02:54:31.060 --> 02:54:34.300]  it's because you know no I've gotten a little shit now you're saying what
[02:54:34.300 --> 02:54:38.260]  here here folks we're watching on TV look at this photo right here we document
[02:54:38.260 --> 02:54:42.540]  cam on this look I guess a time the great Avenger here I'll just put it over
[02:54:42.540 --> 02:54:46.780]  here you just found a bullet there we were digging a wake-up and you found
[02:54:46.780 --> 02:54:50.860]  some kind of bullet there and we also found the type of burning tear gas
[02:54:50.860 --> 02:54:54.420]  rounds they've lied what it was lied in Congress said that they didn't have and
[02:54:54.420 --> 02:54:58.340]  again this book is available at info or store.com it's Bohemian Grove cult of
[02:54:58.340 --> 02:55:04.700]  conspiracy Mike Hansen former by Tex Mars and it is the definitive book on the
[02:55:04.700 --> 02:55:08.700]  whole Bohemian Grove and so much more and you support Mike and you also support
[02:55:08.700 --> 02:55:12.340]  us but and there's I'd like to say this Alex there is so much on the internet
[02:55:12.340 --> 02:55:16.260]  and out there and people call me up and say that you made this whole thing up
[02:55:16.260 --> 02:55:21.420]  about Bohemian Grove I cannot believe anybody'd be that naive that you didn't
[02:55:21.420 --> 02:55:26.100]  go in there I mean there's well well I mean a a they either say we didn't go
[02:55:26.100 --> 02:55:29.460]  in there or they let us in yeah well that's not true and then they say well
[02:55:29.460 --> 02:55:31.900]  why is it their footage of all of it we'd have to start the little hidden
[02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:35.300]  camera yeah and then put well you know we're gonna do some overdrive and take
[02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:38.500]  calls but tell folks what going into Bohemian Grove was really like for
[02:55:38.500 --> 02:55:41.820]  those that don't know it's like the real eyes wide shut well I was curious hell
[02:55:41.820 --> 02:55:47.220]  if you wouldn't ask me to do it I wouldn't have done it but it's scary I
[02:55:47.220 --> 02:55:50.380]  mean we could ended up in jail for a very long well they've arrested everybody
[02:55:50.380 --> 02:55:54.860]  else oh yeah why did we make it in and out what I seen you on TV not too long
[02:55:54.860 --> 02:55:58.380]  ago trying to get in there again y'all didn't even make it up the hill no no
[02:55:58.380 --> 02:56:04.140]  that's true you paddle in the way yeah I didn't stop I yeah they all good I said
[02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:08.060]  go Alex go get out of there it was a lot worse they cut the lawyers made them all
[02:56:08.060 --> 02:56:12.580]  cut out really went on I'd see I saw the non-disclosure that I can't tell what
[02:56:12.580 --> 02:56:16.260]  else happened I'm not seeing that they you just didn't really see anything well
[02:56:16.260 --> 02:56:19.100]  yeah because the police got all the footage I think they probably have
[02:56:19.100 --> 02:56:23.300]  sensors and everything else way beyond what they had when we were there well
[02:56:23.300 --> 02:56:27.780]  there's no think about it yeah the place they used a theater read to shoot the
[02:56:27.780 --> 02:56:32.420]  interviews they had a bartender that was serving us lunch and stuff you know
[02:56:32.420 --> 02:56:35.940]  during the taping interviews he goes you know I've actually worked there I hang
[02:56:35.940 --> 02:56:39.380]  out with George HW Bush and I don't appreciate what you're saying about
[02:56:39.380 --> 02:56:43.460]  them and I went what I'm just saying that weird stuff goes on in here and he
[02:56:43.460 --> 02:56:45.900]  goes well I'm not gonna call them and tell them you're coming and I went and
[02:56:45.900 --> 02:56:49.380]  told myself that guy's ratting us out and they were and they're like no he
[02:56:49.380 --> 02:56:52.820]  wouldn't do that they were so naive and they were they were waiting when we got
[02:56:52.820 --> 02:56:56.860]  there and so I said I'm not I'm not I'm not going in there I said I'm gonna come
[02:56:56.860 --> 02:56:59.900]  right up to the edge and I watch the cops run down and grab them and then they
[02:56:59.900 --> 02:57:03.620]  told me to stop I was on the waterline I know the state and federal law I just
[02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:08.140]  ran off so well you know they just recently opened up the lbj ranch where
[02:57:08.140 --> 02:57:12.140]  you can go into the house and stuff so I my my daughter just got married out
[02:57:12.140 --> 02:57:16.940]  there last month so we went into the lbj ranch they had this big from the
[02:57:16.940 --> 02:57:22.380]  60s they had this this big radar where he infrared where they could see if
[02:57:22.380 --> 02:57:26.060]  anybody was coming from well that was back in the 60s Alex so you can imagine
[02:57:26.060 --> 02:57:31.940]  what they have now the the secret service had it on top of their their
[02:57:31.940 --> 02:57:34.860]  building and they were they they would look through the whole ranch and see if
[02:57:34.860 --> 02:57:39.420]  anything was moving in the dark that was in the 60s so you imagine what they have
[02:57:39.420 --> 02:57:44.420]  now oh I know I have no idea it was just when I tell people on the you know when
[02:57:44.420 --> 02:57:47.740]  people ask me to come on the radio once in a while they'll ask me to come on
[02:57:47.740 --> 02:57:51.780]  about the book I said I think it was just you know God they got us in there
[02:57:51.780 --> 02:57:54.820]  because I don't see how else we could have got in there got out well so we did
[02:57:54.820 --> 02:57:57.860]  get questioned by the secret service in the sheriff's time describe what's on
[02:57:57.860 --> 02:58:02.820]  the footage many times it's right it's all in the book I see that's why I wanted
[02:58:02.820 --> 02:58:06.140]  to write the book because my memory fades you know over the year you wrote it
[02:58:06.140 --> 02:58:09.620]  right for years after well yeah it took it took three or four years to write the
[02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:14.460]  book and to put it together and pay people to put it together because you
[02:58:14.460 --> 02:58:19.620]  know I don't think I'm qualified to put a book that size together but it it
[02:58:19.620 --> 02:58:22.300]  costs about ten thousand dollars to put that book together I know it's ghost
[02:58:22.300 --> 02:58:25.460]  written but it's your words yeah everything's in your words that was
[02:58:25.460 --> 02:58:29.340]  interviewed yeah Alex Alex does a good job in there describing they can also get

[03:12:00.940 --> 03:12:05.340]  well Alex I know that none of that stuff is true that's the only internet I
[03:12:05.340 --> 03:12:08.580]  mean people can just make up anything and put it on the internet now that's the
[03:12:08.580 --> 03:12:12.900]  problem you know you you don't know what to believe but I'm telling you that I've
[03:12:12.900 --> 03:12:19.260]  been with you 18 years ago when you started and you are a good person oh I
[03:12:19.260 --> 03:12:23.180]  know that Mike listen they do that for jealousy but also to change the subject
[03:12:23.180 --> 03:12:26.700]  some of its calling tell pro government cast Sunstein Coggin of dissonance
[03:12:26.700 --> 03:12:31.620]  stuff but my only issue is knowing me from day one and access television when
[03:12:31.620 --> 03:12:35.420]  I was in the control room by myself I mean it just people are like where'd he
[03:12:35.420 --> 03:12:38.940]  come from you know he just showed up on the scene he was in the cable cast just
[03:12:38.940 --> 03:12:42.300]  sitting there but I'm the opposite of coming from nowhere everybody knows who
[03:12:42.300 --> 03:12:46.820]  I am you know they've gone to Rockwall Bob Hooper's his name oh really you know
[03:12:46.820 --> 03:12:50.500]  Bob Hooper yeah I want to have the white he died yeah he died around the same
[03:12:50.500 --> 03:12:56.260]  time that William died oh he was a nice guy yeah he was from Wisconsin yeah no
[03:12:56.260 --> 03:13:00.500]  but expanding on that he was able to explain they've gone and gotten my high
[03:13:00.500 --> 03:13:05.620]  school yearbooks at Anderson and at Rockwall trying to prove I'm not who I
[03:13:05.620 --> 03:13:08.820]  say him and then when they find the proof then they say that person's a fake
[03:13:08.820 --> 03:13:12.220]  yeah which is kind of a nice thing I can't find my man my my but there are
[03:13:12.220 --> 03:13:16.620]  Alex Jones out there they mix you up with some time oh that's how I got that's
[03:13:16.620 --> 03:13:19.660]  how he's heard saying I was a Vatican assassin and nothing is cablixing the
[03:13:19.660 --> 03:13:23.940]  great people and you know well just because you go speak at a Catholic
[03:13:23.940 --> 03:13:28.340]  school for your dog for your sister does not mean yeah college yeah I mean it's
[03:13:28.340 --> 03:13:31.300]  crazy no but the whole pool that's where she got a scholarship but separate
[03:13:31.300 --> 03:13:34.580]  I'm saying Catholics are great people the whole point is is that there was a

[03:16:22.020 --> 03:16:26.260]  the air with boss hog go ahead you're a good boss hog yeah I met somebody that
[03:16:26.260 --> 03:16:30.180]  his grandfather went to Bohemian Grove every year so if people want to say
[03:16:30.180 --> 03:16:33.060]  that's not real then you know but that's not really what I call up about
[03:16:33.060 --> 03:16:37.620]  call up about flight 214 if you just have the windows from the front door on
[03:16:37.620 --> 03:16:41.100]  the still picture where they show that people getting off the plane there are
[03:16:41.100 --> 03:16:46.020]  six windows as you count six windows look straight down where it says asian
[03:16:46.020 --> 03:16:49.980]  airlines you'll be right above the eye if you look at the footage of the first
[03:16:49.980 --> 03:16:56.060]  responders you'll count seven windows and you'll be above the eye what do you
[03:16:56.060 --> 03:17:00.260]  saying that it's not real I mean amateur shot video that the same it's not the
[03:17:00.260 --> 03:17:04.380]  same plane there's two different planes there the grass is like three feet high
[03:17:04.380 --> 03:17:08.220]  when the people are getting off that plane there are yellow tags under the
[03:17:08.220 --> 03:17:13.380]  doors on the video footage that's the first responder footage there are no
[03:17:13.380 --> 03:17:17.060]  yellow I'm gonna say this I think the Boston bombing happened but it was
[03:17:17.060 --> 03:17:22.260]  staged clearly but it people were probably heard same thing with Sandy
[03:17:22.260 --> 03:17:25.980]  Hook because they'll kill real people but you look at the spokespeople they're
[03:17:25.980 --> 03:17:29.380]  clearly acting there's some fake stuff and I saw some people with all their
[03:17:29.380 --> 03:17:33.700]  clothes blown off with no damage to their skin but shrapnel holes and you
[03:17:33.700 --> 03:17:38.340]  can see their actors and they did that on 7 7 but because I was there days after
[03:17:38.340 --> 03:17:41.180]  it happened I flew to England and what happens is they blew up real people but
[03:17:41.180 --> 03:17:45.980]  then they have fake people to then be the celebrity victims who are inserted I'm
[03:17:45.980 --> 03:17:49.820]  telling you they do it and that came out in operation north woods that they would
[03:17:49.820 --> 03:17:54.380]  stage planes crashing and have actors and stuff so so that's a real thing they
[03:17:54.380 --> 03:18:04.660]  do Mike your take on all that well I just listen to you Alex I mean oh man I
[03:18:04.660 --> 03:18:09.340]  tell you Mike answer I think this last deal they pulled is just trying to divide
[03:18:09.340 --> 03:18:14.460]  us you know divide the people you I heard you come on when I was coming in
[03:18:14.460 --> 03:18:20.020]  today about the the Trayvon Martin garbage that's just to divide and conquer
[03:18:20.020 --> 03:18:23.340]  and you've always said that divide and conquer and that's what they're trying to
[03:18:23.340 --> 03:18:29.420]  do so I think the media is like that they did Barney 5 meets Han Solo meets
[03:18:29.420 --> 03:18:36.300]  Boss Hog what's that about that's you you're the Lord though Lord Alex oh and
[03:18:36.300 --> 03:18:44.060]  I call him the police Lord this Lord that well I've worked very very hard for
[03:18:44.060 --> 03:18:48.300]  the last couple years to to build up what we have down there and to have
[03:18:48.300 --> 03:18:52.700]  somebody come in to try to start money off you and I and it's just not gonna
[03:18:52.700 --> 03:18:57.980]  happen what about what about when Obama says you didn't build that no my
[03:18:57.980 --> 03:19:02.460]  grandpa built it no but you've maintained it and expanded it me he
[03:19:02.460 --> 03:19:05.580]  remember Obama making the comment about you didn't build that they want to talk
[03:19:05.580 --> 03:19:10.460]  about people that you know they want to do recycling everything my grandpa tore
[03:19:10.460 --> 03:19:14.380]  down old he went to the dump ground when I was growing up and got lumber and
[03:19:14.380 --> 03:19:20.380]  tore down old houses and built all this this business up from the ground up so
[03:19:20.380 --> 03:19:25.900]  I mean Obama didn't build it no Obama didn't do it he he did us my grandpa was
[03:19:25.900 --> 03:19:31.060]  so cheap when we were growing up he would slam the break on for a loonum can
[03:19:31.060 --> 03:19:34.020]  on the highway and almost throw us through the throw us through the windows
[03:19:34.020 --> 03:19:36.940]  hold on we're gonna skip this break for us to we're gonna skip this break hold on
[03:19:36.940 --> 03:19:41.900]  final segment good job guys thank you huge whistle you're blowing a huge whistle
[03:19:41.900 --> 03:19:46.540]  here what are you getting at sir well it's just like your other guest you had
[03:19:46.540 --> 03:19:52.300]  on Anthony was wasn't he referencing Ali Stevenson the UM coach that was
[03:19:52.300 --> 03:19:57.540]  talking about the bomb drills yes okay well when I saw the picture of that guy
[03:19:57.540 --> 03:20:01.220]  because I showed a still frame of him he's on the phone talking to the media
[03:20:01.220 --> 03:20:05.340]  about it I'm like this guy looks familiar if you look at the picture of the
[03:20:05.340 --> 03:20:11.500]  Richards family look at the dad and you never see you never get to hear an
[03:20:11.500 --> 03:20:17.740]  actual live interview from that Richards family it's always statements God bless
[03:20:17.740 --> 03:20:20.740]  you we'll look into it you know I'll tell you this when they can go to
[03:20:20.740 --> 03:20:23.900]  somebody's house and shoot the suspect in the top of the head and then say
[03:20:23.900 --> 03:20:29.340]  nobody can see the autopsy and then they turned out the FBI wasn't injured they
[03:20:29.340 --> 03:20:34.460]  didn't and then they two FBI guys that were involved in the arrest of Zohar
[03:20:34.460 --> 03:20:42.780]  end up dying and then some of our associates well it's Haaland Haaland
[03:20:42.780 --> 03:20:46.340]  Vanden Neuenhoff's one of his best friends was one of the SWAT team guys in on
[03:20:46.340 --> 03:20:50.340]  that and now he's been told don't talk to him and then Rob do's brother-in-law
[03:20:50.340 --> 03:20:55.140]  is on the Army Marathon team and minutes before gets pulled out and told
[03:20:55.140 --> 03:20:58.420]  you're dehydrated he's like no I'm not you're going to the hospital so he
[03:20:58.420 --> 03:21:02.500]  wouldn't be bombed I guess and then you add the drill and you add the cover up
[03:21:02.500 --> 03:21:08.380]  and you add that the Tamerlin the older brother being part of the CIA that's on
[03:21:08.380 --> 03:21:12.820]  record he was sent overseas under aliases I mean this is definitely a
[03:21:12.820 --> 03:21:17.460]  staged event well I think you were right which you've always said state public
[03:21:17.460 --> 03:21:22.740]  that's why you stayed alive so long because you're public and the first
[03:21:22.740 --> 03:21:26.580]  thing you did when we snuck in the Bohemia Grove is get that video out to
[03:21:26.580 --> 03:21:30.380]  everybody that's the first thing you did remember that but but remember three
[03:21:30.380 --> 03:21:34.180]  times they got him to the mail and we're erasing the tapes we were sending to the
[03:21:34.180 --> 03:21:37.700]  to the you send it out to everybody absolutely out to everybody on the
[03:21:37.700 --> 03:21:43.180]  internet and the internet wasn't like it is now then you know that's 13 years
[03:21:43.180 --> 03:21:46.780]  ago but it was good enough to get it out there and you got it out there quick
[03:21:46.780 --> 03:21:51.140]  to everybody and that's why I think they didn't kill you well we got death
[03:21:51.140 --> 03:21:55.660]  threats over that and and three times they copied the tape there their expert
[03:21:55.660 --> 03:21:58.820]  people camera to camera checked it was good they melded a race they said you
[03:21:58.820 --> 03:22:03.340]  mind mailing this to world of wonder in LA the production company again make the
[03:22:03.340 --> 03:22:09.140]  copy mail they go that's that's that there's that's a blank tape and I said I
[03:22:09.140 --> 03:22:15.580]  said so I sent it again wiped it again and then finally we sent it to England
[03:22:15.580 --> 03:22:25.060]  wiped again and then I used somebody that worked with us their address to mail it
[03:22:25.060 --> 03:22:28.340]  to a crew member of world of wonder and they got it at their house so they were
[03:22:28.340 --> 03:22:33.540]  getting in the mail to get that they were not happy about that it would it I'm
[03:22:33.540 --> 03:22:36.940]  glad you got it out there when you did because I thought I think they could they
[03:22:36.940 --> 03:22:41.620]  could have wiped us all out before we got out of California but we got out of
[03:22:41.620 --> 03:22:44.420]  there we went Sam sure sure I mean we did put like a two-minute clip up just to
[03:22:44.420 --> 03:22:47.060]  show it happened but they did not want the full footage but they don't want was
[03:22:47.060 --> 03:22:51.260]  the faces yeah I'm not stupid I'm not gonna I'm not gonna show the faces of
[03:22:51.260 --> 03:22:55.100]  the of the men dancing together or whatever it was hard to see the faces
[03:22:55.100 --> 03:23:00.460]  because of where we had or I do have footage somewhere around here I mean
[03:23:00.460 --> 03:23:04.580]  because it was it was our long tapes but I can only reload twice I had to get it
[03:23:04.580 --> 03:23:08.900]  out of the hidden bag I had to reload in the bathroom remember absolutely and I
[03:23:08.900 --> 03:23:12.500]  sent you in there cuz and they kept saying was he doing in the bathroom so
[03:23:12.500 --> 03:23:16.860]  I couldn't figure out that that little tape was hard to put in there yeah that
[03:23:16.860 --> 03:23:22.340]  was a hidden camera we were up in the woods absolutely at the at the camps
[03:23:22.340 --> 03:23:26.660]  absolutely well then I said we've been questioned twice no three times I said
[03:23:26.660 --> 03:23:30.460]  let's go hide them and we were able to do it and by the way all at dinner they
[03:23:30.460 --> 03:23:34.340]  were all at dinner by the way then Danny Glover walks by as it's almost dark you
[03:23:34.340 --> 03:23:38.260]  hear about racism I remember and yeah don't don't say the n-word yeah and they
[03:23:38.260 --> 03:23:41.420]  go and all these old men are going what's that because I think the average age
[03:23:41.420 --> 03:23:44.500]  was like 80 I mean these people are that's what's really gross about these
[03:23:44.500 --> 03:23:47.220]  whole men dancing around together the point is I mean sorry it's gross folks
[03:23:47.220 --> 03:23:51.140]  you have to run with a woman's gross it's just disgusting the point is is that
[03:23:51.140 --> 03:23:56.620]  is that they're going what's that doing here and I mean that's all I heard I was
[03:23:56.620 --> 03:24:01.100]  like what so I mean I guess that's who you'd expect that from but but that's
[03:24:01.100 --> 03:24:04.980]  when they were all having dinner and at the at the dining hall we did have a
[03:24:04.980 --> 03:24:08.780]  place to sit so we had to get out of there yeah but just just just 13 years
[03:24:08.780 --> 03:24:11.860]  later all those guys are dead and I'm told now there's a bunch of black people
[03:24:11.860 --> 03:24:15.900]  there but that was like the old guard yeah what do you think the average age
[03:24:15.900 --> 03:24:20.020]  was there like 80 oh it was there was no young people we were we were the
[03:24:20.020 --> 03:24:24.180]  youngest I think that's why that the the Greens workers were whistling at how was
[03:24:24.180 --> 03:24:29.140]  you 13 years ago Alex I was I don't know about look I mean we both looked like
[03:24:29.140 --> 03:24:32.860]  you know handsome so that's why I remember were we being whistled out by
[03:24:32.860 --> 03:24:37.100]  the by the Greens people I'll be 50 this this month I'll be 40 here in real
[03:24:37.100 --> 03:24:41.100]  quick but but I mean once you get but we figured out why we were able to get
[03:24:41.100 --> 03:24:45.540]  there do you remember the old men whistling at us yeah and the describe
[03:24:45.540 --> 03:24:49.540]  that but but in the book I I say I took advantage of that because you know I
[03:24:49.540 --> 03:24:53.660]  wanted to be protected I didn't want to be caught so we took advantage of that
[03:24:53.660 --> 03:24:59.260]  from the very start to get on the bus the Albus yeah but we didn't like take
[03:24:59.260 --> 03:25:04.060]  advantage of it like no but we the if you look at the guards how they looked
[03:25:04.060 --> 03:25:08.380]  at us they thought we were prostitutes for these no no we figured that out yeah
[03:25:08.380 --> 03:25:12.180]  yeah yeah go back look at the tape and look at that guy the way he looks oh I
[03:25:12.180 --> 03:25:20.380]  know yeah I mean it's like they're all bunch of pepula pews but you know when
[03:25:20.380 --> 03:25:24.980]  I when I do a couple interviews once in a while once a couple times a year on the
[03:25:24.980 --> 03:25:28.300]  bohemian grove and I always tell people don't try to get in there because we
[03:25:28.300 --> 03:25:31.980]  don't want I don't want to see anybody go to jail I don't think I don't think you
[03:25:31.980 --> 03:25:36.700]  could do it again I think it'd be too hard hey once every tried to do it one
[03:25:36.700 --> 03:25:43.140]  reporter got my Mark Dyson myself a guy I met a few times he he went worked there
[03:25:43.140 --> 03:25:47.540]  shot footage got it out they set him up and I saw the court case they sent me
[03:25:47.540 --> 03:25:53.740]  copies it was in the news he they they got him saying that he was like a child

[03:27:46.860 --> 03:27:49.980]  shake your fist and you need to be as defiant against someone that was to
[03:27:49.980 --> 03:27:55.220]  oppress you every time you need to say no or else your silence is your consent

[03:28:05.740 --> 03:28:09.740]  just we just got her down to Gonzales in a nursing home and and I go out there to
[03:28:09.740 --> 03:28:13.900]  visitor and stuff and I see all these old people laying around and you've got
[03:28:13.900 --> 03:28:16.700]  to do what you can before you end up in that place because they got them all
[03:28:16.700 --> 03:28:22.500]  drugged up in there and and nobody knows anything now I think that you need to
[03:28:22.500 --> 03:28:28.380]  fight where you can work where you can and live a good life that's what I'm
[03:28:28.380 --> 03:28:31.180]  doing I've been doing that for a couple absolutely you know I was thinking about
[03:28:31.180 --> 03:28:34.740]  Bohemian Grove while we were there five hours a couple of us just hiding out in
[03:28:34.740 --> 03:28:37.660]  the woods behind a cabin because they kept questioning us and I don't want to
[03:28:37.660 --> 03:28:42.860]  try our luck you would it'd be like snapshots guys would walk by going we
[03:28:42.860 --> 03:28:46.100]  got a great deal transferring those nuclear reactors I'm telling you the
[03:28:46.100 --> 03:28:50.260]  such-and-such then that they'd walk off or or that they were all going to the
[03:28:50.260 --> 03:28:54.100]  owl to watch the ritual big throngs of men and like Danny Glover they latch that
[03:28:54.100 --> 03:28:58.580]  Glover what the hell are you doing here it's I mean it was like snapshots of the
[03:28:58.580 --> 03:29:02.580]  weirdness or we go into one camp to use the bathroom there's like a hundred
[03:29:02.580 --> 03:29:06.820]  guys drinking wine dancing together I mean it was just bizarre but being around
[03:29:06.820 --> 03:29:10.300]  being up to that owl you really can't tell what it is when you're up there but
[03:29:10.300 --> 03:29:15.460]  remember the altar had the real altar up there where they they sacrifice yeah
[03:29:15.460 --> 03:29:21.300]  absolutely an effigy or if it's real look I apologize to Mike Robert and
