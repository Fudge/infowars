[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:24.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:24.000 --> 00:35.600]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. It is Thursday, February 7th. I'm not Alex, I'm Aaron Dykes.
[00:35.600 --> 00:40.280]  We're sitting in today. Alex is taking a well-deserved rest, spending some family time,
[00:40.280 --> 00:45.180]  I hope. We're gonna bring you a lot of important news today. We've got several of our reporters
[00:45.180 --> 00:50.360]  joining us, so we're going to have them bringing forth the most important news.
[00:50.360 --> 00:54.800]  David Knight's gonna join us. We're gonna cover drones and a whole lot more. Sha'Carri
[00:54.800 --> 01:00.120]  Jackson, David Ortiz, Melissa Melton, they're all coming up. But we are at an important
[01:00.120 --> 01:05.600]  juncture in history. The authoritarians, the repugnance to the Constitution are completely
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.400]  taking over the levers of power, but they're losing credibility very fast.
[01:10.400 --> 01:15.160]  This Second Amendment battle has been a great moral victory for gun owners everywhere, but
[01:15.160 --> 01:21.120]  we need to hold our ground even more, push forward, and win back the Cultural War. That,
[01:21.120 --> 01:27.040]  of course, is what the Infowar is all about, and we're making significant grounds there.
[01:27.040 --> 01:32.880]  The world's changing around us. You've seen the vast GMO battle that happened last year,
[01:32.880 --> 01:38.440]  largely centered around Proposition 37 in California, which was officially lost.
[01:38.440 --> 01:43.760]  But just like many of the battles in the American Revolution, losing isn't always really losing
[01:43.760 --> 01:48.040]  because it was a significant threat to the establishment that's trying to force us to
[01:48.040 --> 01:54.240]  eat unlabeled foods, lots of dangerous stuff in there. And now they're proposing a federal
[01:54.240 --> 01:59.040]  compromise on GMO labeling that might trump state law forever.
[01:59.040 --> 02:05.080]  And surprise, surprise, the big agra, big food industry is behind quite a bit of it.
[02:05.080 --> 02:11.060]  Supermarkets cry foul as FDA proposes new food labeling under Obama. Will federal compromise
[02:11.060 --> 02:16.820]  on GMO labeling trump state law forever? GMO giant Monsanto joins big business coalition
[02:16.820 --> 02:24.680]  for UN agenda 21. And from Anthony Giucciardi over at Natural Society, safety group blows
[02:24.680 --> 02:27.600]  lid on secret virus hidden in GMO crops.
[02:27.600 --> 02:32.660]  We'll get to that later in the program. But these two headlines tell a story on the Second
[02:32.660 --> 02:40.780]  Amendment battle. Well, maybe three headlines here. DHS purchases 21.6 million more rounds
[02:40.780 --> 02:45.880]  of ammunition to go along with their more than 1.6 billion rounds. You've got to imagine
[02:45.880 --> 02:51.040]  they're preparing for something. Of course, the entire Department of Homeland Security
[02:51.040 --> 02:53.940]  was crafted, designed, put in place before 9-11.
[02:53.940 --> 03:00.500]  But they used that crisis in a very Rahm Emanuel sense. They used that crisis, rode on the
[03:00.500 --> 03:06.000]  backs of tragedy, all the tears everyone's hurt to push through a completely unconstitutional
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.800]  system that we're still living under. And that we've got to expose and roll back so
[03:10.800 --> 03:14.960]  we can put back in place our republic, our constitution, our Bill of Rights.
[03:14.960 --> 03:20.720]  But while they're purchasing more ammunition to occupy America, unprecedented demand. Americans
[03:20.720 --> 03:29.560]  purchase a gun every 1.5 seconds. And an 86-year-old woman grabs gun in self-defense, and she was
[03:29.560 --> 03:34.520]  able to stave off a home robber. And that's what the Second Amendment's for. You would
[03:34.520 --> 03:38.240]  really hope an 86-year-old woman would never have to come to arms.
[03:38.240 --> 03:42.680]  But if no one else is there to protect her, and surely the police can't do it, you would
[03:42.680 --> 03:48.020]  rather she's able to defend herself than let the criminals go wild. Yesterday, last night
[03:48.020 --> 03:52.320]  on the Nightly News, I covered Luke Rudowsky's story there in New York City. Where there's
[03:52.320 --> 03:57.000]  a total citizen disarmament, where you're not allowed not only to have concealed weapons,
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.860]  but you're not allowed to carry knives or really even defend yourself.
[04:00.860 --> 04:05.640]  And he tells the poignant story of a man, his name is Joe Lozito, who was attacked at
[04:05.640 --> 04:12.000]  knife point on a subway and nearly died, but he was able to overcome his assailant. And
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.920]  yet there were police, armed police on that train, no more than two feet away from him
[04:18.920 --> 04:24.320]  through a door. And they refused cowardly to come through and save him because they
[04:24.320 --> 04:26.400]  believe the assailant might have a gun.
[04:26.400 --> 04:32.200]  Well, they have guns, yet they wouldn't respond because they say they have no duty to protect
[04:32.200 --> 04:37.480]  and serve. Well, number one, we want to encourage law enforcement and military to indeed protect
[04:37.480 --> 04:42.120]  and serve. And among the protections is not only the people, but the Constitution and
[04:42.120 --> 04:43.120]  Bill of Rights.
[04:43.120 --> 04:48.680]  Look, we've got to reawaken this country. We've got to go back to liberty, self-defense,
[04:48.680 --> 04:52.760]  common sense people. We'll talk about it more on the other side. A lot of hot news today,
[04:52.760 --> 04:57.040]  stay tuned. We're going to have a lot of special guests and reporters back on the other side
[04:57.040 --> 05:24.400]  at empowards.com.
[05:57.040 --> 06:26.400]  We'll be right back.
[06:26.400 --> 06:33.400]  We'll be right back.
[06:56.400 --> 07:04.400]  We'll be right back.
[07:26.400 --> 07:33.400]  We'll be right back.
[07:56.400 --> 08:03.400]  We'll be right back.
[08:26.400 --> 08:33.400]  We're back at empowards.com. Now that song in the background is about selling your soul
[08:33.400 --> 08:38.400]  to the company store. What's that all about? It's about liberty is this complex struggle
[08:38.400 --> 08:43.400]  where even when you're free in name, we had a lot of indentured servants in this country,
[08:43.400 --> 08:48.400]  of course, slavery. Even once they became free, were they really free because they had
[08:48.400 --> 08:51.400]  to work on these fields owned by the company store.
[08:51.400 --> 08:55.400]  They had to buy their products at the company store. They had to take out debt there and
[08:55.400 --> 09:00.400]  really they could never get free except in their own souls. But if we awaken our minds,
[09:00.400 --> 09:05.400]  if we understand what we're fighting for and why we want our rights in place, we can start
[09:05.400 --> 09:10.400]  to take it back. The Bill of Rights is, in my view, the most promising aspect of the
[09:10.400 --> 09:11.400]  American Revolution.
[09:11.400 --> 09:16.400]  I touched on this last night. I try to touch on it all the time because that is the real
[09:16.400 --> 09:21.400]  whole, that's the whole product of the entire enlightenment, the age of reason, the awakening,
[09:21.400 --> 09:28.400]  the battle against kings and princes and tyrannical religious authorities to say that I'm going
[09:28.400 --> 09:32.400]  to have my relationship with God on a one on one basis, but here on Earth, you're going
[09:32.400 --> 09:33.400]  to respect my rights.
[09:33.400 --> 09:37.400]  Keep your distance. We're going to create a buffer zone. We're going to separate powers
[09:37.400 --> 09:42.400]  because all you people in power are corrupt. It always happens time and again. So here
[09:42.400 --> 09:49.400]  we are once again at the best of times, the worst of times. We've got John Brennan on
[09:49.400 --> 09:55.400]  Capitol Hill today seeking CIA confirmation. And this is, of course, the man who is one
[09:55.400 --> 10:01.400]  of Obama's top advisers and the one considered responsible for these kill lists, these drone
[10:01.400 --> 10:07.400]  strike lists where they just send over this automated thing, take out a suspected target
[10:07.400 --> 10:10.400]  and plenty of collateral damage in between.
[10:10.400 --> 10:14.400]  They don't care if they kill women, children, completely innocent people, as long as they
[10:14.400 --> 10:20.400]  can claim they might have possibly been targeting someone who might be associated with Al Qaeda.
[10:20.400 --> 10:28.400]  Now he's going to lead the already flawed CIA and bring no moral ground to it whatsoever
[10:28.400 --> 10:34.400]  as we continue to deteriorate here. Meanwhile, you've got states like Texas introducing anti
[10:34.400 --> 10:41.400]  drone legislation. Texas anti drone laws would be the toughest in the USA.
[10:41.400 --> 10:46.400]  They're, of course, considering that legislation here in the state capitol. And they already
[10:46.400 --> 10:51.400]  considered banning the TSA and bringing in private security at the airports here. In
[10:51.400 --> 10:57.400]  fact, it passed overwhelmingly in the house and they use procedural moves to block it.
[10:57.400 --> 11:03.400]  Meanwhile, behind the scenes, behind the curtain, they made extortion like threats threatening
[11:03.400 --> 11:08.400]  to have a blockade on Texas, a no fly zone, and basically occupy the country federally
[11:08.400 --> 11:14.400]  if they dared to say no to a clearly unconstitutional TSA.
[11:14.400 --> 11:18.400]  Is it going to be the same with drones? We can see how they would violate our Fourth
[11:18.400 --> 11:22.400]  Amendment, see how they would violate our privacy, see how they would circumvent due
[11:22.400 --> 11:29.400]  process that's put into place so that criminals are dealt with under the law, but that there's
[11:29.400 --> 11:34.400]  proper procedure there. You have people who are suspicious, you have evidence, you have
[11:34.400 --> 11:39.400]  reasons to go investigate. You just don't go from place to place spying so you can collect
[11:39.400 --> 11:44.400]  revenue and round up people and get people in the system and make a bigger collectivist
[11:44.400 --> 11:47.400]  government raise up the coffers.
[11:47.400 --> 11:51.400]  And we saw that too with Kurt Nemo's story from yesterday about how they're gonna do
[11:51.400 --> 11:56.400]  checkpoints in Florida now, not just for DUI, not just to see if you might have been drinking,
[11:56.400 --> 12:01.400]  if you might be a safety hazard out on the highways, but to see if your tires are too
[12:01.400 --> 12:05.400]  worn, to see for registration stickers in place, to see if your lights are working,
[12:05.400 --> 12:09.400]  see if they can give you a ticket and raise some money for the state and just harass you
[12:09.400 --> 12:13.400]  a little bit when you've got a freedom to travel.
[12:13.400 --> 12:18.400]  You've got your rights, and that's what we're fighting for in so many respects. And so there's
[12:18.400 --> 12:23.400]  just news all over the place on that front. Now we're gonna get way into the drone issue
[12:23.400 --> 12:26.400]  after the bottom of the hour. David Knight's gonna join us to bring us up to speed on some
[12:26.400 --> 12:30.400]  of the latest. But you heard the headline in the past couple days, Department of Justice
[12:30.400 --> 12:36.400]  Eric Holder telling us that it's, quote, legal to drone strike Americans.
[12:36.400 --> 12:41.400]  Of course, in this context, they're implying that they mean Al Qaeda Americans living abroad
[12:41.400 --> 12:45.400]  and just because they're born here doesn't mean we can't take them out by drone strike
[12:45.400 --> 12:49.400]  without due process. Well, that's fine and good, and they've been doing all kinds of
[12:49.400 --> 12:53.400]  things like that under the War on Terror. Of course, I don't think it's fine. I think
[12:53.400 --> 12:59.400]  it's shameful the way we're prosecuting this empire and really just wreck and ruining other
[12:59.400 --> 13:00.400]  countries.
[13:00.400 --> 13:04.400]  But the point is, they're trying to legitimize, well, it's this Al Qaeda guy, so why do we
[13:04.400 --> 13:09.400]  wanna bother with putting him on trial? It's Anwar al-Awlaki and his 16-year-old son, and
[13:09.400 --> 13:14.400]  we'll take him out with a drone if we want. But think about it, here they are building
[13:14.400 --> 13:20.400]  up drones here inside the United States, at least 30,000 plus drones being deployed by
[13:20.400 --> 13:22.400]  law enforcement in different areas of the country.
[13:22.400 --> 13:28.400]  The Fed's using it to spy, the EPA using it to spy on farms. They deployed planes to
[13:28.400 --> 13:36.400]  supposedly monitor pollution and check for terrorism and just see if anyone has an unauthorized
[13:36.400 --> 13:41.400]  something on land somewhere that the feds may not already control. We've got to start
[13:41.400 --> 13:46.400]  saying no to this, and it is encouraging, whatever comes of it, that many of these states
[13:46.400 --> 13:51.400]  are beginning to try, at least in name, to restrict drones.
[13:51.400 --> 13:55.400]  But you've got things like Florida police want to use drones for crowd control. That's
[13:55.400 --> 13:59.400]  more of the stuff we've already seen on that front. We'll get more into it, but they're
[13:59.400 --> 14:04.400]  setting the stage for legitimizing not only killing foreign Americans abroad who might
[14:04.400 --> 14:10.400]  be Al Qaeda, but for using drones, of course, domestically on possibly suspected domestic
[14:10.400 --> 14:11.400]  terrorists.
[14:11.400 --> 14:16.400]  Extremist Americans, political dissidents is, of course, what it really boils down to.
[14:16.400 --> 14:21.400]  And you've got some really wicked and corrupt people for a long time, for many decades in
[14:21.400 --> 14:25.700]  Washington, but they're just getting worse and worse. They're getting that feedback loop
[14:25.700 --> 14:30.320]  of no one's going to stop them. No one's going to say no, they've got the controls of levers,
[14:30.320 --> 14:33.500]  they bought out all the elections and politics.
[14:33.500 --> 14:39.520]  And so no wonder you've got people like Jesse Jackson Jr. from one of the many oligarchical
[14:39.520 --> 14:45.560]  dynastical families possibly facing jail time because of his many corruptions as a member
[14:45.560 --> 14:52.560]  of the house. That's just one of many headlines here. And just interesting the stuff that's
[14:52.560 --> 14:59.400]  going on. Let me reset here. There's a lot of interesting China news and this isn't really
[14:59.400 --> 15:00.400]  my specialty.
[15:00.400 --> 15:04.120]  I've probably got a lot of ignorance with China, but you can see there's people clearly
[15:04.120 --> 15:11.080]  fighting for freedom there under a very authoritarian regime. We covered yesterday a wholly disgusting
[15:11.080 --> 15:16.680]  territory. I mean, already the entire one child policy, the encouragement of abortion
[15:16.680 --> 15:22.600]  and infanticide and looking the other way as children are sold into sex slavery and
[15:22.600 --> 15:28.680]  child trafficking, and really just devaluing humans, especially little girls in China.
[15:28.680 --> 15:33.160]  But even more disgusting, just that kind of a cherry on top of the icing that was already
[15:33.160 --> 15:38.680]  on that authoritarian cake is this horrible case of the one child policy enforced for
[15:38.680 --> 15:45.400]  these family planning officers who crushed a 13 year old boy to death because their parents
[15:45.400 --> 15:49.000]  had more than one child and refused to pay the fine.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.560]  And that fine is a big payoff to the system. It's financially burdensome for a lot of struggling
[15:54.560 --> 16:00.200]  Chinese people. And of course, children who are born outside of the one child policy,
[16:00.200 --> 16:05.320]  many of them never are allowed to officially be recognized in the system. They in many
[16:05.320 --> 16:11.380]  ways don't have rights or benefits. They can't get inside of different healthcare systems
[16:11.380 --> 16:13.920]  and they pretty much have to live outside of the books.
[16:13.920 --> 16:17.960]  It's a real tax, but you've got things like in Hong Kong, which is not China proper, of
[16:17.960 --> 16:26.880]  course. Poor people in cages are having to pay rent, to rent $167 a month for about a
[16:26.880 --> 16:35.480]  dozen, excuse me, the 67 year old former butcher in Hong Kong pays 1300 Hong Kong dollars, about
[16:35.480 --> 16:41.920]  $167 a month for a dozen wire mesh cages resembling rabbit hutches that apparently people are
[16:41.920 --> 16:44.720]  living in in this dilapidated town.
[16:44.720 --> 16:51.200]  Meanwhile in Guangzhou, a Yangji village in China, I don't really know the area to be
[16:51.200 --> 16:56.620]  honest, moats have been dug around a Chinese villagers house to drive them out. They're
[16:56.620 --> 17:00.220]  pretty much taking over all these zones and handing them over to corporations, the kind
[17:00.220 --> 17:06.320]  of stuff we've long seen in America and the Western world. And they're dealing with holdouts.
[17:06.320 --> 17:10.920]  Most of the people sell without any resistance, but there have been many cases of resistors
[17:10.920 --> 17:16.880]  in these villages and they've dug a moat to basically commit siege against these villagers
[17:16.880 --> 17:20.320]  and force them to sell or basically starve.
[17:20.320 --> 17:24.000]  And just a lot of disturbing news there. You remember the case last year where the man
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.360]  wouldn't sell his property to the Chinese government. And I remember the case that we're
[17:28.360 --> 17:33.760]  gonna hand it over to a corporation and he was holding out, he refused. And so they just
[17:33.760 --> 17:39.920]  steamrolled him to death, just like this family planning worker just dehumanizingly, wantingly
[17:39.920 --> 17:45.520]  just murdered, ran over with his vehicle, a car, a 13 month old baby boy.
[17:45.520 --> 17:50.080]  I don't know how people can get to that point, but that's the kind of thing you see under
[17:50.080 --> 17:56.640]  authoritarianism. We've got to fight back against it. Other news on Infowars.com, what's
[17:56.640 --> 18:01.700]  behind the punishment for fake guns in schools? That's a John Rappaport article. We've seen
[18:01.700 --> 18:05.680]  a lot of coverage of this, of course, whether it's the five year olds getting in trouble,
[18:05.680 --> 18:11.340]  even arrested, put on their permanent record for bubble guns or kids getting in trouble
[18:11.340 --> 18:16.320]  for drawing guns or talking about guns or making a hand sign for guns.
[18:16.320 --> 18:21.800]  And I remember Brandon Smith, Alt Market, he made a good point that they know it's ridiculous.
[18:21.800 --> 18:26.520]  Obviously it's not a threat. This is an Orwellian mind bending event where they're trying to
[18:26.520 --> 18:31.280]  teach an entire new generation of children, obviously very impressionable, not yet in
[18:31.280 --> 18:35.820]  touch with history or their rights or what's going on in this country.
[18:35.820 --> 18:40.680]  Trying to teach an entire new generation of children that guns are bad, that they're repulsive,
[18:40.680 --> 18:46.440]  to give them almost a Clockwork Orange-like auto response to the very image, the very
[18:46.440 --> 18:51.720]  idea, the very discussion of guns. And so by punishing a few of these children as examples,
[18:51.720 --> 18:55.760]  all children will have a chilling effect not to get into the gun culture.
[18:55.760 --> 18:59.520]  That's the very opposite of what our founders talked about. I believe it was Richard Henry
[18:59.520 --> 19:05.760]  Lee talked about, we should not only all have personal rights to arm ourselves and be trained
[19:05.760 --> 19:10.860]  in guns, but especially the young should be trained in guns. Learn how to use them, learn
[19:10.860 --> 19:15.880]  how to use them safely, be responsible, but know how to use them so that no one can run
[19:15.880 --> 19:17.400]  over that culture.
[19:17.400 --> 19:21.800]  That's the makings of a free society. And I know it sounds radical today, but people
[19:21.800 --> 19:25.040]  are rediscovering that. That's what's happened with the Second Amendment. Mike Adams had
[19:25.040 --> 19:31.180]  a great article yesterday highlighting the many victories maybe between the jaws of defeat
[19:31.180 --> 19:35.960]  we've seen in the attempt to rein in guns. It's totally revitalized the culture. You've
[19:35.960 --> 19:40.680]  had law enforcement and military standing up to say they're not gonna take part in any
[19:40.680 --> 19:41.680]  confiscation.
[19:41.680 --> 19:46.280]  You've had record purchases of guns, people lining up at gun stores, re-engaging in private
[19:46.280 --> 19:51.400]  sales and preparing to resist the government through words, through the info war. Let's
[19:51.400 --> 19:56.200]  not let it get violent, but if they ever try to trample on our rights that far, we're not
[19:56.200 --> 19:57.200]  gonna let them do that either.
[19:57.200 --> 20:04.200]  We'll be back on the other side a lot more ahead of us. Stay tuned.
[20:27.200 --> 20:34.200]  We'll be right back.
[20:57.200 --> 21:04.200]  We'll be right back.
[21:27.200 --> 21:34.200]  We'll be right back.

[24:23.120 --> 24:29.880]  We're back again, Infowars.com. Alex is gonna be back shortly. But today, we're trying to
[24:29.880 --> 24:34.360]  hold down the fort. We're gonna parade some of our excellent reporters coming up later
[24:34.360 --> 24:35.360]  in the broadcast.
[24:35.360 --> 24:40.560]  David Knight about to join us, Jakari Jackson, David Ortiz, Melissa Melton also all coming
[24:40.560 --> 24:44.420]  up. And we're gonna break down all kinds of things going on in the news. We're gonna talk
[24:44.420 --> 24:48.320]  about the cultural war. We're gonna talk about the symbols they hit at the Super Bowl and
[24:48.320 --> 24:53.720]  how they hide the symbols in media all the time around us and how that assaults our psyche
[24:53.720 --> 24:57.960]  and how that contributes to the way they dominate our culture.
[24:57.960 --> 25:02.120]  And just one example of it, of course, we've talked so much about the Second Amendment,
[25:02.120 --> 25:09.080]  about gun rights, and we've talked a lot here at Infowars.com about genocide. Well, yesterday,
[25:09.080 --> 25:15.800]  the demand a plan crowd, which comes from the Mayors Against Illegal Guns, that's Bloomberg's
[25:15.800 --> 25:21.320]  group. So you can see already where this is a very globalist-oriented, eugenics-oriented
[25:21.320 --> 25:24.360]  group who really just badly wants to disarm America.
[25:24.360 --> 25:29.440]  Well, they've rounded up all these celebrities they control in so many ways through the purse
[25:29.440 --> 25:36.360]  strings, through who knows lifestyle, blackmail stuff. Tony Bennett, if Americans keep firearms,
[25:36.360 --> 25:40.900]  the rest of the world will really take care of us. Kurt Nemo's got an article highlighting
[25:40.900 --> 25:45.440]  his comments, showing the video, but they rolled out all kinds of celebrities. We talked
[25:45.440 --> 25:52.360]  about Chris Rock yesterday, who is so ignorant and so backwards that he thinks the president
[25:52.360 --> 25:55.360]  is the boss of the country instead of the other way around.
[25:55.360 --> 26:00.420]  The president is just supposed to be an executor of the laws, kind of a bully pulpit representation
[26:00.420 --> 26:06.040]  of the pulse of the people. They're not supposed to rule over us. Other countries have kings.
[26:06.040 --> 26:11.560]  We fought a rebellion, we fought a war, we fought a revolution to not have a king so
[26:11.560 --> 26:17.440]  that we could have a normal civil society with the balance of power as much representation
[26:17.440 --> 26:18.440]  as possible.
[26:18.440 --> 26:23.160]  Yet here's these mayors against illegal guns who don't understand the Second Amendment,
[26:23.160 --> 26:27.660]  or some of which who do, but would just love to see the country destroyed, playing into
[26:27.660 --> 26:33.100]  the hands of democide. Now, just remember for a minute, just for context, that Mayor
[26:33.100 --> 26:38.480]  Bloomberg is one of these people who goes to these secret, genocidal meetings with Bill
[26:38.480 --> 26:43.760]  Gates, with David Rockefeller, where they talk about how to curve the world's population.
[26:43.760 --> 26:47.800]  It's those secret billionaire meetings where they bring in the top billionaires, people
[26:47.800 --> 26:54.080]  like Oprah for show, but the real controllers, Bill Gates, David Rockefeller, and their powerful
[26:54.080 --> 27:00.460]  foundations that spread eugenics, family planning, abortion around the world, and who are trying
[27:00.460 --> 27:05.160]  to control the food supply through the GMO issues and doing so much more.
[27:05.160 --> 27:10.520]  Here they are also behind the mayors against illegal guns via Bloomberg and all these other
[27:10.520 --> 27:16.300]  brainwashed mayors rolling out these celebrities. And what does Tony Bennett say? He says that
[27:16.300 --> 27:21.240]  gun owners basically are like the Nazis. And to paraphrase his remarks, if we don't rein
[27:21.240 --> 27:27.960]  in the gun culture, this gun violence will be taken care of by the rest of the world.
[27:27.960 --> 27:33.640]  In other words, he's suggesting there be a world war against America as if they were
[27:33.640 --> 27:38.880]  the Nazi enemy because we haven't restricted our gun rights. Well, that is just a veiled
[27:38.880 --> 27:44.220]  threat for the globalists to conquer America. I mean, that's what it's always been. Every
[27:44.220 --> 27:49.440]  time they disarm, they then commit genocide, atrocities, and of course, take rights and
[27:49.440 --> 27:54.600]  rack and ruin these countries to bring them under the yoke of the larger one world government
[27:54.600 --> 27:59.200]  system for which I would argue the United Nations is just one vehicle of.
[27:59.200 --> 28:04.560]  That's a larger agenda beyond that. That's kind of a shell building framework organization.
[28:04.560 --> 28:10.160]  But like Gulliver's travels with the Lilliputians, they use 100 ropes, 100 binding things to
[28:10.160 --> 28:15.080]  bring down the big enemy America, to bring down any free country and bind them down with
[28:15.080 --> 28:18.960]  a bunch of small ropes. That's one thing the United Nations does.
[28:18.960 --> 28:25.200]  But Tony Bennett here saying, excuse me, where's that quote? It's the kind of turn that happened
[28:25.200 --> 28:29.640]  to the great country of Germany when Nazis came over and created tragic things and they
[28:29.640 --> 28:34.520]  had to be told off. And if we continue this kind of violence and accepted it in our country,
[28:34.520 --> 28:37.840]  the rest of the world's really gonna take care of us in a bad way.
[28:37.840 --> 28:43.080]  And I really know history and I understand what's at stake with guns. Yeah, no, you don't
[28:43.080 --> 28:48.200]  know nothing celebrity. And Chris Rock, who's told us that Obama's the dad of the country
[28:48.200 --> 28:53.440]  and our boss and all these other no name celebrities insisting that they know bust and we must
[28:53.440 --> 28:58.800]  turn in our arms. It's really become a desperate last gasp at this point because they've seen
[28:58.800 --> 29:02.760]  the trends in social media, in the gun purchases.
[29:02.760 --> 29:06.260]  People want the Second Amendment preserved. They're not gonna give in. They see through
[29:06.260 --> 29:10.600]  this rhetoric of standing on the back of dead children, whether it be Sandy Hook or the
[29:10.600 --> 29:15.240]  dead victims of the Colorado massacre. Of course, this is almost reaching the point
[29:15.240 --> 29:19.040]  of beating a dead horse, but we must stand our ground for the Second Amendment.
[29:19.040 --> 29:24.280]  It's just so flimsy. These people with no arguments, trying to take away our rights
[29:24.280 --> 29:28.720]  and just pimping for these globalists. I know all about the funding behind it. I know what
[29:28.720 --> 29:34.560]  these billionaires are up to. All these celebrities in these videos, by the way, come from 30
[29:34.560 --> 29:40.320]  Rock. That's the Rockefeller Center in New York, NBC, all the most controlled aspects
[29:40.320 --> 29:41.320]  of our society.
[29:41.320 --> 29:45.800]  We've got to recognize it, say no. We'll be back. David Knight on the other side, drones,
[29:45.800 --> 29:49.880]  radios, and the Illuminati culture all coming up ahead.
[29:49.880 --> 30:00.400]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[30:05.680 --> 30:11.360]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[30:11.360 --> 30:16.520]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

[33:26.400 --> 33:30.920]  We're back at infowars.com. I'm Aaron Dykes sitting in, but I'm going to be joined today
[33:30.920 --> 33:35.920]  by a number of our reporters, and they're going to bring us some of the most important
[33:35.920 --> 33:39.760]  elements of the smattering of news. Now at the beginning of the next hour, we're going
[33:39.760 --> 33:46.840]  to start to take some calls. That call number is 1-800-259-9231. So let's see what kind
[33:46.840 --> 33:51.280]  of topics you can bring to the table. I hope it's relevant. But joining me now is David
[33:51.280 --> 33:55.160]  Knight, one of our newest members. You've seen him on the Infowars Nightly News, brings
[33:55.160 --> 33:59.120]  a great deal of knowledge. It's been really interesting to get to know him and pick his
[33:59.120 --> 34:03.520]  brain and see how it balances and messes with the other information that we've already put
[34:03.520 --> 34:08.440]  together at Infowars. We're always growing here. That's why I love working here, because
[34:08.440 --> 34:13.520]  it's food for the mind. It's re-understanding what's going on in this world and why things
[34:13.520 --> 34:17.200]  are important and why we're taught American history. Well, there's so much behind the
[34:17.200 --> 34:23.080]  scenes because it applies to everything. It's timeless because authoritarians and the mechanisms
[34:23.080 --> 34:28.160]  of power and control just go in cycles. And so David Knight, tell us what you're bringing
[34:28.160 --> 34:29.160]  to the table today.
[34:29.160 --> 34:34.320]  Well, thank you, Aaron. I guess today the thing that is really breaking are these John
[34:34.320 --> 34:38.440]  Brennan hearings. And it's kind of important because there's been a lot of leaks this last
[34:38.440 --> 34:42.140]  week about things that are going on with the CIA, with drone assassinations, with torture,
[34:42.140 --> 34:49.600]  that sort of thing. And Brennan has been kind of at the nexus of both torture and assassination.
[34:49.600 --> 34:53.680]  He's been the apologist for this type of policy. As a matter of fact, he's been called by Ron
[34:53.680 --> 35:01.220]  Wyden, Obama's counterterrorism chief, essentially. And now they're putting him up for CIA director.
[35:01.220 --> 35:05.680]  So this week, as this is coming today, the hearings are today, but leading up to this,
[35:05.680 --> 35:10.440]  we've had a number of leaks. The first there was a leak from the Holder Justice Department
[35:10.440 --> 35:16.360]  talking about their quote unquote legal justification for these drone strikes and actually move
[35:16.360 --> 35:19.720]  the bar a little bit from what people understood as to where they were.
[35:19.720 --> 35:26.480]  Well, by legal, they just say it's legal. They say it's legal to just extra judicially
[35:26.480 --> 35:32.320]  kill someone, just like they said it was legal to torture even children using pliers on their
[35:32.320 --> 35:37.000]  genitals in the John Yoo memos and the other related torture memos under the Bush administration.
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.840]  I mean, they'll just say it's legal, but it's disgusting and repugnant to any kind of human
[35:41.840 --> 35:45.320]  morality to any kind of constitutional notion. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[35:45.320 --> 35:49.360]  That's right, yeah. And we'll talk about the details of that. But just in general, that
[35:49.360 --> 35:54.600]  was released. Then they also released some information that the CIA had been involved
[35:54.600 --> 36:01.000]  in renditions using 54 different countries. So basically, this is another kind of legal
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.080]  fiction where the CIA says, well, we don't torture anybody. No, they don't torture people,
[36:05.080 --> 36:08.760]  they kidnap them and send them to other countries where they're tortured.
[36:08.760 --> 36:12.040]  And there's 54 countries, including European countries that have been involved in this
[36:12.040 --> 36:17.140]  type of thing. It's not just banana republics or third world dictators. And then there was
[36:17.140 --> 36:26.120]  also a leak about a CIA drone base in Saudi Arabia. That's interesting because, and actually
[36:26.120 --> 36:31.180]  that was the base that was used to kill Al Alaki, the first American citizen who was
[36:31.180 --> 36:36.940]  assassinated by Obama. But that was interesting because that story was covered up for quite
[36:36.940 --> 36:39.280]  some time by the Washington Post.
[36:39.280 --> 36:44.000]  They claim that they released it this week just before the hearings because another news
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.400]  organization was going to release it. But that's a situation where the media is carrying
[36:49.400 --> 36:50.800]  water for the CIA.
[36:50.800 --> 36:55.480]  Well, in many respects, they're owned by the CIA, you could argue.
[36:55.480 --> 37:00.840]  Absolutely, absolutely. But this is a clear case so the public can see that this is happening.
[37:00.840 --> 37:05.700]  And again, the timing of that is somewhat suspicious with these hearings coming up.
[37:05.700 --> 37:09.880]  The interesting thing about the hearings from a political standpoint is that a lot of this
[37:09.880 --> 37:13.240]  opposition and perhaps a lot of these leaks like you see coming from the Washington Post
[37:13.240 --> 37:16.400]  is coming from some Democrats.
[37:16.400 --> 37:20.320]  The only resistance that we seem to see and it is actually pretty weak and ineffective
[37:20.320 --> 37:25.920]  resistance to these policies is from some Democrats. The Republicans by and large are
[37:25.920 --> 37:30.120]  kind of cheering this stuff on. They're all for torture and that sort of thing. As a matter
[37:30.120 --> 37:36.260]  of fact, last night I heard as I was driving home on the radio, I heard Sean Hannity had
[37:36.260 --> 37:41.640]  somebody on his show and they were taking this classic left right paradigm to the extreme
[37:41.640 --> 37:47.920]  where the one fellow that was a Democrat was defending Obama's assassination programs while
[37:47.920 --> 37:50.440]  he was criticizing Bush's torture programs.
[37:50.440 --> 37:54.640]  And then of course, Hannity took exactly the opposite position that torture was fine but
[37:54.640 --> 37:59.200]  assassination was bad. And it's like the only thing that's being tortured here is reason
[37:59.200 --> 38:03.520]  and morality and the legality of doing this stuff. I mean, it was such a torture discussion.
[38:03.520 --> 38:07.640]  It was just amazing to hear these guys try to jump through hoops to defend one position
[38:07.640 --> 38:13.640]  and not the other because there is no legal or moral justification for what they're doing,
[38:13.640 --> 38:16.960]  either one of these guys, but they're defending it strictly on partisan grounds like that.
[38:16.960 --> 38:21.600]  Well, obviously not. Now, John Brennan, of course, as we mentioned already, was behind
[38:21.600 --> 38:25.600]  the kill list. He's the one who comes to Obama each week and says, here's the targets we
[38:25.600 --> 38:30.240]  want to send drones over and strike. Now, they want to exploit our emotions and try
[38:30.240 --> 38:36.040]  to tell us that 20 children who are dead at Sandy Hook by a random killer who apparently
[38:36.040 --> 38:40.440]  was not properly profiled in society, that we should worry about that.
[38:40.440 --> 38:44.520]  Well, here's two killers that we know about in the White House who have children's blood
[38:44.520 --> 38:50.760]  on their hands. They drone strike a 17-year-old girl. John Brennan has the 17-year-old girl's
[38:50.760 --> 38:52.880]  blood on his hands. So does Obama.
[38:52.880 --> 38:58.460]  Yeah, and just from a pragmatic standpoint, one of the articles was talking about a Muslim
[38:58.460 --> 39:03.560]  cleric who had taken a stand against Al Qaeda in his country. And he got a call from Al
[39:03.560 --> 39:08.240]  Qaeda, and they said, we want to meet with you. So he was assigned a time and a place
[39:08.240 --> 39:13.240]  to meet with him. He took a local law enforcement guy with him as kind of a backup. Three Al
[39:13.240 --> 39:16.200]  Qaeda show up, and the five of them are talking.
[39:16.200 --> 39:21.920]  And a drone strike hits, vaporizes all five of them and a nearby camel. Okay, now this
[39:21.920 --> 39:25.160]  guy, if they wanted to really do something in terms of winning hearts and minds, I mean,
[39:25.160 --> 39:30.760]  if you want to buy into the Republican vision of what this war is about, that it really
[39:30.760 --> 39:35.920]  is some kind of a crusade, moral crusade, which I don't believe that it is. I believe
[39:35.920 --> 39:40.120]  this whole thing is a false paradigm that it's set up by the CIA.
[39:40.120 --> 39:44.040]  It's a sham for geopolitical control as well as domestic control.
[39:44.040 --> 39:48.120]  Absolutely. But even if you want to take the position that these drone strikes are saving
[39:48.120 --> 39:52.200]  American lives, it's like, really, exactly how are they saving American lives? I mean,
[39:52.200 --> 39:58.960]  are they saving American lives because they're keeping the military from going in and attacking
[39:58.960 --> 40:03.920]  these people? I mean, first of all, is this war justified? But then secondly, when they
[40:03.920 --> 40:09.160]  destroy somebody like that, that is essentially on their side of the issue that is opposing
[40:09.160 --> 40:15.680]  Al Qaeda, all that does is inflame the righteous indignation of the people who are there.
[40:15.680 --> 40:20.760]  Think about Pearl Harbor. Think about the standard, again, the standard historical perspective
[40:20.760 --> 40:27.920]  of Pearl Harbor. You have the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor. Now clearly, we were arming
[40:27.920 --> 40:32.480]  and a threat to them, more so even than you could, certainly more so than Al Qaeda is
[40:32.480 --> 40:39.380]  a threat to us, okay? And you could argue that an attack was imminent. And yet, it resonates
[40:39.380 --> 40:44.660]  with people that that was a day of infamy, that that was an unjustified preemptive attack.
[40:44.660 --> 40:51.040]  And under the age old moral rules of war, you don't go to war preemptively.
[40:51.040 --> 40:55.240]  Whoever strikes first is the moral loser. Exactly, exactly. That goes all the way back
[40:55.240 --> 41:03.040]  to Augustine, 300 AD. And he basically laid out the, excuse me, he laid out the case for
[41:03.040 --> 41:08.720]  just war. And what he said was, you don't strike first, you don't do more than you have
[41:08.720 --> 41:13.340]  to. And the same sort of situation if somebody breaks in your home, once they are subdued,
[41:13.340 --> 41:14.920]  you don't keep shooting.
[41:14.920 --> 41:21.760]  So that type of thing, there's several aspects to just war. When you violate that morally,
[41:21.760 --> 41:27.140]  when you are on a losing side, you invigorate the other side, if there are legitimately
[41:27.140 --> 41:28.140]  two sides.
[41:28.140 --> 41:32.520]  Well, that's the whole thing. That's why domestically here in America, we've got to recognize these
[41:32.520 --> 41:38.240]  authoritarians and kick them out of power. Because they are bringing all that moral indignation
[41:38.240 --> 41:43.200]  upon our nation in our name, even though they don't represent us, they're not accountable
[41:43.200 --> 41:50.240]  to us. But all that torture stuff is about humiliating the Muslim, Islamic, Arabic, general
[41:50.240 --> 41:52.680]  Middle East cultures.
[41:52.680 --> 41:57.780]  Doing things with children, doing sexual things in these torture junctions, these drone strikes,
[41:57.780 --> 42:02.160]  not seeing the face of the enemy. All that is about inflaming them while they discredit
[42:02.160 --> 42:06.280]  them and try to paint them in a bad light through the al-Qaeda mechanism, which they
[42:06.280 --> 42:12.000]  have raised as a specter for more than 40, 50 years, but especially in the last couple
[42:12.000 --> 42:13.600]  of decades.
[42:13.600 --> 42:18.480]  We talked about Anwar al-Awlaki, he's on record, he dined at the Pentagon, he was brought there,
[42:18.480 --> 42:23.040]  he was investigated by the FBI, but apparently cleared through the CIA, through the Justice
[42:23.040 --> 42:28.440]  Department. We know the hijackers were allowed to travel on visas. And these are just fronts
[42:28.440 --> 42:32.840]  for the American and Western intelligence apparatus.
[42:32.840 --> 42:36.480]  It's like a can opener, like you just paint the bad guy and then you can go into any country
[42:36.480 --> 42:37.480]  you want.
[42:37.480 --> 42:40.680]  Absolutely, and if you look at these, that takes us to the other part of this. These
[42:40.680 --> 42:46.960]  54 countries that were involved in extraordinary renditions is the euphemism that they use.
[42:46.960 --> 42:54.200]  You had Libya under Qaddafi, was a partner of the CIA in torture. You had Egypt under
[42:54.200 --> 43:00.760]  Mubarak, you had Syria under Assad, Iran under Ahmadinejad. These are all people that we're
[43:00.760 --> 43:06.920]  told we have to go to war to take out, and yet they're partners with the CIA in torturing
[43:06.920 --> 43:07.920]  people.
[43:07.920 --> 43:12.800]  It's the same kind of phony paradigm that we've got, this guy is actually a bad guy,
[43:12.800 --> 43:17.400]  like you said, Al-Awlaki went into the Pentagon and was dining with people, right? So these
[43:17.400 --> 43:22.560]  same people like Qaddafi that we go in to take out, he was actually helping us to torture
[43:22.560 --> 43:24.440]  people with the CIA.
[43:24.440 --> 43:28.440]  I think the simplest way to sum it up is that the worst people rise to the top in every
[43:28.440 --> 43:33.200]  culture, every country. We learn to respect them and trust them cuz they look like us,
[43:33.200 --> 43:37.500]  because we're from that particular area of the world. And they all secretly work behind
[43:37.500 --> 43:42.800]  the scenes through these shadow government apparatuses to dominate people everywhere
[43:42.800 --> 43:43.800]  worldwide.
[43:43.800 --> 43:49.280]  But specifically with these 54 plus torture dungeons, they've misdirected us into only
[43:49.280 --> 43:54.400]  talking about Guantanamo Bay, which by the way, Obama the liar promised to close, never
[43:54.400 --> 44:00.200]  did. And of course, bad things happen at Guantanamo, all the weird sensory deprivation, force feeding
[44:00.200 --> 44:05.360]  stuff and general torture. But yeah, then you've got these black hole prisons in places
[44:05.360 --> 44:11.360]  like Romania, and Poland, and Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, and Libya, and all around the world.
[44:11.360 --> 44:16.000]  And just like these free trade zones where they make everyone in the world operate under
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.400]  globalism rules, it's bad for most of the general public.
[44:19.400 --> 44:23.780]  But then they always have exception zones, so-called free zones where they're allowed
[44:23.780 --> 44:28.600]  to not pay taxes in whatever local country they're in, not subject to any of the laws
[44:28.600 --> 44:32.640]  there. And it's just this black hole culture where they think they can get away with whatever
[44:32.640 --> 44:35.560]  they want, and they must be horrible in these prisons.
[44:35.560 --> 44:40.000]  Yeah, one article that I thought was really good was from antiwar.com, and it had 20 facts
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.960]  that you should know about extraordinary rendition. And as I was listening, like I said, I listened
[44:44.960 --> 44:49.880]  to conservative radio and Fox News and how they were spinning this stuff, trying to defend
[44:49.880 --> 44:54.040]  torture at the same time than trying to attack assassinations. And what they were saying
[44:54.040 --> 44:56.520]  was that this is not really that bad.
[44:56.520 --> 45:00.620]  I mean, waterboarding is not really, you're kind of scaring people or you're depriving
[45:00.620 --> 45:05.040]  them of sleep or whatever. This is truly, I don't have time to read all of this, but
[45:05.040 --> 45:11.220]  it is truly amazing. You've got innocent people like a German national who happens to be Arabic
[45:11.220 --> 45:16.320]  or Islamic or whatever, kidnapped, that's what extraordinary renditioning is, kidnapped
[45:16.320 --> 45:19.160]  and taken to Afghanistan, tortured for 77 days.
[45:19.160 --> 45:25.600]  You've got one guy who was seized in Iran, held for 77 days in the CIA's dark prison
[45:25.600 --> 45:30.600]  in Afghanistan, subjected to sleep deprivation, hung from the ceiling by his arms and a strip
[45:30.600 --> 45:35.880]  auto position, threatened by dogs, made to watch torture videos, subjected to sounds
[45:35.880 --> 45:42.720]  of electronic sawing accompanied by cries of pain. You've got one of these fellows who
[45:42.720 --> 45:47.320]  is threatened to have a relative of his, this is another common thing that they do, is bring
[45:47.320 --> 45:51.820]  in children, wives, mothers, and threaten to torture them in front of the people.
[45:51.820 --> 45:57.760]  And it's just amazing the stuff that you see here. This is our government, okay? This is
[45:57.760 --> 46:02.960]  our government, the CIA, that is at the center. You've got all these 54 countries and their
[46:02.960 --> 46:08.100]  names have been made public and it's creating scandals in the UK and other European countries.
[46:08.100 --> 46:13.960]  People are calling for people to resign. But at the center of it is our government.
[46:13.960 --> 46:18.260]  Our government hijacked by the repugnance are modeling themselves on literal brainwashing
[46:18.260 --> 46:22.800]  techniques from communist China, North Korea, from the Spanish Inquisition. It's the worst
[46:22.800 --> 46:28.240]  of the worst stuff done in our name and it's so insulting to everyone involved.
[46:28.240 --> 46:33.080]  And yet what you see here is you can't get a unified front from either the Democrats
[46:33.080 --> 46:38.320]  or Republicans to say, this is wrong, let's stop it. These perpetual wars are wrong, let's
[46:38.320 --> 46:43.440]  stop them. Instead, they're just trying to defend their guy. If their guy is torturing
[46:43.440 --> 46:48.560]  but not assassinating or this or that. But it was even more ridiculous for the Democrat
[46:48.560 --> 46:53.080]  because Obama is continuing all these torturing programs as well as adding assassination.
[46:53.080 --> 46:56.440]  That's the actual thing that's going on. It's not like he stopped the torturing, of course
[46:56.440 --> 47:00.400]  he didn't stop the torturing. He's just adding this assassination, especially of American
[47:00.400 --> 47:01.400]  citizens.
[47:01.400 --> 47:07.640]  And that's one of the things in this legal memo that was really amazing is to see what
[47:07.640 --> 47:16.680]  they say to defend it. They say that it's legal, it's effective. And one of the things
[47:16.680 --> 47:20.800]  that they pointed out in the memo, they had four conditions. And they said that you need
[47:20.800 --> 47:25.220]  to have an informed high level official of the US government determined that the targeted
[47:25.220 --> 47:28.600]  individual poses an imminent threat of violence against the United States.
[47:28.600 --> 47:34.160]  Two, capture is not feasible. And three, the operation will be conducted in a manner consistent
[47:34.160 --> 47:39.600]  with the application with applicable laws of war principles. Well, it has to be all
[47:39.600 --> 47:45.120]  three of those, right? And if it's going to be applicable with the law of war principles,
[47:45.120 --> 47:50.000]  then it's going to fail every time. Because again, we're back to a situation where they're
[47:50.000 --> 47:57.080]  not only saying that, we were concerned about the drone assassinations initially, because
[47:57.080 --> 48:00.760]  they were being conducted against people who had not been given due process, okay?
[48:00.760 --> 48:05.900]  That was what everybody was concerned about. But they're not even saying that they need
[48:05.900 --> 48:12.400]  to have studied the situation and determined that this person was responsible for an attack.
[48:12.400 --> 48:16.760]  They're not even saying that that person is planning an attack. Now what they're saying
[48:16.760 --> 48:22.640]  is it's enough that that person is associated with Al Qaeda or some other group that they
[48:22.640 --> 48:24.480]  have labeled as terrorists.
[48:24.480 --> 48:27.980]  And see how they're moving the football field first since we were attacked, so let's go
[48:27.980 --> 48:32.920]  get retaliation. Well, that's one thing. But now it's all the way whittled down to, well,
[48:32.920 --> 48:37.600]  you're associated with people who might be Al Qaeda, might be extremists. And that's
[48:37.600 --> 48:41.680]  just what's so disgusting because you can see how they're trying to bring the war home
[48:41.680 --> 48:45.480]  here to occupy America and to target dissidents.
[48:45.480 --> 48:50.240]  It happens in every country, it's very historical. But again, this drone stuff, this torture
[48:50.240 --> 48:56.760]  stuff completely is a continuation, a parallel to the worst of the abuses on the Bush administration,
[48:56.760 --> 49:01.640]  which is a complete upending of our entire country. And again, they were already torturing
[49:01.640 --> 49:06.960]  people, already doing all this extrajudicial stuff. But then they write white papers and
[49:06.960 --> 49:10.200]  memos out of the White House to justify it after the fact.
[49:10.200 --> 49:15.920]  Yes, and I would say to people like Hannity who say that waterboarding is not torture.
[49:15.920 --> 49:20.980]  Is he aware of the fact that waterboarding was done by Japanese officers against Allied
[49:20.980 --> 49:26.640]  soldiers during World War II? And that those Japanese officers were considered to be war
[49:26.640 --> 49:32.120]  criminals. Some of them were executed for doing that. That's what we understood. I mean,
[49:32.120 --> 49:37.200]  it's amazing how we have slid down this slope.
[49:37.200 --> 49:42.000]  We look at the standards and say, if you attack a country before that country has attacked
[49:42.000 --> 49:49.600]  you, that is a gross and immoral violation of law and of ethics. But now we accept that.
[49:49.600 --> 49:55.360]  And we say that we can torture people with water. When they tortured people with waterboarding,
[49:55.360 --> 49:58.880]  when the Japanese did it, it was a horrific thing. And these people were criminals. Now
[49:58.880 --> 49:59.880]  we defend it.
[49:59.880 --> 50:03.760]  I agree with you, but it's like they want us to focus on the tree instead of the forest.
[50:03.760 --> 50:07.440]  They want to send a semantical debate over what waterboarding is. And for one thing,
[50:07.440 --> 50:12.120]  it's all about the context. If you're in a dungeon or a cell being surrounded by guys,
[50:12.120 --> 50:16.760]  you could just wave a finger in front of someone's face for enough hours and it becomes torturous.
[50:16.760 --> 50:24.160]  Yeah, absolutely. But going to the assassination stuff, I mean, here's an exchange with the
[50:24.160 --> 50:30.480]  director of the FBI. This is about a year ago. This representative said, so I guess
[50:30.480 --> 50:33.920]  from a historical perspective, this is representative Tom Grays.
[50:33.920 --> 50:37.160]  All that thought. We're coming up on the break again. We're going to do calls later in the

[53:59.520 --> 54:27.040]  And we do need to let them stop depraving us, stop forcing us. At what point are we
[54:27.040 --> 54:31.360]  going to say no? I'd like to get into some of the GMO news in the next hour, but we do
[54:31.360 --> 54:38.640]  want your calls as well, 1-800-259-9231. Now back to David Knight on the topic of drones,
[54:38.640 --> 54:43.760]  on the topic of torture, and really on the topic of how long is this phony war on terror
[54:43.760 --> 54:45.040]  gonna continue?
[54:45.040 --> 54:50.760]  We're already 12 years into it. There's not a real enemy, it's pretty clear. It's a shadow
[54:50.760 --> 54:57.520]  enemy. We've exposed in so many ways how the Al-Qaeda so-called is really just an asset
[54:57.520 --> 55:04.660]  of the larger shadow government, CIA and Pentagon run operation to try to dominate geopolitically
[55:04.660 --> 55:09.900]  the world and really try to rescind the rights of Americans and get them under the yoke.
[55:09.900 --> 55:15.320]  But we've had the whole Arab Spring uprisings, which they clearly incited but miscalculated,
[55:15.320 --> 55:20.200]  I believe. And there's so many ways they're inducing more and more blowback and drones
[55:20.200 --> 55:21.480]  are one of them.
[55:21.480 --> 55:26.660]  They want to have this ongoing war, this never-ending empire to control the world for America to
[55:26.660 --> 55:32.040]  be the first and last superpower as PNAC, the Project for New America Century, dubbed
[55:32.040 --> 55:36.800]  it. And yet our troops have been overstretched. There are so many bases around the world.
[55:36.800 --> 55:42.640]  And moreover, they're demoralized because they realize in so many of the regular troops
[55:42.640 --> 55:46.400]  that what we're doing is wrong, that it's not for the reasons we've been told. We know
[55:46.400 --> 55:50.760]  the WMD things are a lie. So that's one of the major reasons we're seeing drones, why
[55:50.760 --> 55:54.760]  they're now trying to legitimize them. David Knight, your response.
[55:54.760 --> 55:58.600]  Yeah, absolutely. You're talking about when is this war on terror gonna end? Well, it's
[55:58.600 --> 56:03.880]  not going to end because as Ron Paul and others have pointed out, it's a war on a tactic.
[56:03.880 --> 56:07.480]  It's like saying you're gonna declare war on sneak attacks. We didn't declare war on
[56:07.480 --> 56:12.140]  sneak attacks, we were attacked by Pearl Harbor, right? And then what they've done is they've
[56:12.140 --> 56:18.160]  extended this so that as you're seeing now, first it was like, well, we're gonna go after
[56:18.160 --> 56:21.840]  some people that supposedly are behind a specific event, okay?
[56:21.840 --> 56:27.400]  Then it becomes people who are maybe planning to do something. Now it's just people who
[56:27.400 --> 56:32.040]  are associated with that. And what we should all worry about is that when they say that's
[56:32.040 --> 56:37.720]  somebody that's merely associated with a terrorist group, let's understand that the MYAC report
[56:37.720 --> 56:42.360]  were constitutionalist, conservatives, people who voted for Ron Paul, for Chuck Baldwin.
[56:42.360 --> 56:45.000]  Puts pretty much any thinking individual in the terrorist category.
[56:45.000 --> 56:50.920]  Right, right. People who are libertarians, conservatives, Tea Party members, these are
[56:50.920 --> 56:57.680]  the types of people that have repeatedly been classified and tagged as terrorist opponents.
[56:57.680 --> 57:03.360]  And war games by the military and memos recently from West Point strategizing about war on
[57:03.360 --> 57:08.760]  terror and the MYAC report from 2009. I mean, there's too many of these to go through, but
[57:08.760 --> 57:13.000]  there's so many places where we see that, yes, clearly there are many people in the
[57:13.000 --> 57:18.040]  government and in the press and places like the Southern Poverty Law Center repeatedly
[57:18.040 --> 57:24.320]  characterize constitutionalist, libertarians, conservatives, Tea Party people as terrorists.
[57:24.320 --> 57:30.200]  So this should very much, and the fact that it's an American citizen that is being gone
[57:30.200 --> 57:34.820]  after, once we get to the point where they don't have to give us due process, they don't
[57:34.820 --> 57:38.960]  even have to claim that there is an event that they're reacting to or a plan that they're
[57:38.960 --> 57:43.920]  reacting to, you're just merely associated with an ideology, which is what's going on
[57:43.920 --> 57:44.920]  here.
[57:44.920 --> 57:49.480]  That's a very dangerous situation for everybody. That part now that has now just resurfaced
[57:49.480 --> 57:54.900]  with this legal memo is something that we should all be very concerned. And as this
[57:54.900 --> 58:00.280]  is coming up, again, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee is none other than
[58:00.280 --> 58:04.240]  Diane Feinstein. This woman seems to be at the center of everything pretty much that's
[58:04.240 --> 58:09.360]  evil. And she had a quote about this hearing about John Brennan that's coming up today.
[58:09.360 --> 58:12.800]  And she said that they would consider his information.
[58:12.800 --> 58:16.320]  We're up against the hour, finish your point and we'll come back on the other side.
[58:16.320 --> 58:20.480]  Well, basically what she's saying is that this is good that these memos have been leaked
[58:20.480 --> 58:24.360]  because we need to be transparent about it as if transparency itself were virtue and
[58:24.360 --> 58:25.360]  it isn't.
[58:25.360 --> 58:29.360]  Well, it's virtuous if you otherwise have some virtue. We'll be back in just one minute
[58:29.360 --> 58:35.040]  on the other side in the second hour, Infowars.com. A lot more news ahead. Other reporters stay
[58:35.040 --> 58:37.040]  tuned.
[58:37.040 --> 58:48.040]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:48.040 --> 59:00.560]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says
[59:00.560 --> 59:05.480]  that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most
[59:05.480 --> 59:10.960]  impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret
[59:10.960 --> 59:17.040]  network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity
[59:17.040 --> 59:22.020]  of government program has established an old powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles
[59:22.020 --> 59:26.600]  the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive
[59:26.600 --> 59:33.280]  world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror
[59:33.280 --> 59:37.720]  and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish
[59:37.720 --> 59:45.260]  plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at Infowars.com

[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:31.760]  GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in the second hour. This is Infowars.com on the Alex Jones
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:41.640]  show. Alex is taking a day off, a well-deserved break. He needs to spend some time with his
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:49.280]  family. Reset, relax. Meanwhile, we've got new uncertainty in Tunisia after assassination.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.600]  And this is coming in. I'm just seeing it for the first time, but apparently there's
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:58.640]  riots going on, and you name it. And this is just more evidence that the Western concocted
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.060]  Arab Spring has gone the wrong direction.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:07.760]  Or perhaps the direction they intended all along to sow the seeds of chaos so that they,
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:13.920]  the supposed controllers, can bring order out of chaos. And we're seeing these countries,
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:19.720]  Egypt slipping into total despotism, Tunisia with fresh riots, and the rest of the entire
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:25.200]  region in increasing disarray. Iran is doing new posturing, saying they've had nuclear
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.380]  all along, but are no threat to Israel.
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:34.400]  They continue to leave on the table the possibility of a wider World War III type scenario. And
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.400]  we just hope it doesn't come to that. But meanwhile, it's increasingly clear to me,
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:43.720]  we were talking before the break about how they've targeted and painted Americans who
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:49.000]  just have an ideology as potential terrorists, as extremists who need to be watched, monitored,
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.020]  reined in, preemptively checked, pulled over at checkpoints, arrested.
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:58.480]  And they really wanna just clamp down so that everyone becomes a dependent on the system
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:05.160]  and just looks up to Big Daddy Obama, as Chris Rock called him, looks up to our boss, the
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:10.260]  president, and just lets them top down, tell us what to do, even though they're known liars,
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:15.600]  known criminals, admitted murderers, at least through the military apparatus, through these
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.000]  cowardly and unwise drone strikes.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.120]  And you were getting into the supposed virtues of tyranny. Well, there's no virtue in a tyranny,
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.120]  even through transparency.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:31.560]  That's right. What we're seeing is the reactions of even the people who oppose some of this
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:36.200]  are really kind of looking to Obama as some kind of a dictator to just tell them where
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:42.160]  we are on all this. As I was saying just before the break, Feinstein was saying that on Tuesday,
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:47.520]  she said, well, this white paper was released without the consent of the administration.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:52.360]  So that should quell calls for more transparency. Well, Obama didn't release that. So it's not
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:58.480]  transparency on his part. And it's not a virtue, even if he had released that information,
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.980]  it's not a virtue to say, guess what, I'm gonna tell you about these illegal assassinations
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.360]  that I'm doing without any due process of American citizens.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.080]  And you should be proud of me because I'm openly telling you about it. What that tells
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:18.720]  us is that he's lost any sense of shame over violating these legal, moral, and ethical
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:24.360]  considerations over violating his oath to the Constitution. But even someone who opposes
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:29.860]  him, now that's Feinstein, who's head of the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:35.920]  Another senator, Ron Wyden, is actually opposed to John Brennan and has some questions about
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:39.620]  him. But listen to what he says. He says he has questions like, how much evidence does
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:43.520]  the president need to decide that a particular American is part of a terrorist group? Does
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:48.480]  the president have to provide individual Americans with an opportunity to surrender?
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:53.640]  Can the president or the intelligence agencies or the military kill an American who is inside
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:58.680]  the United States? These are questions that need to be answered in a way that is consistent.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:02.480]  And you see once again how they move the goalposts, how they're bringing it home to America.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.920]  Right, they're bringing it home to America. But also look at what the attitude is behind
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:12.700]  this, these questions that he asks. Basically, he's saying, please, dictator, tell me what
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.520]  the new law is out of your mouth.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.360]  It's as if we didn't have a constitution, because they don't pay any attention to it.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.440]  And so when you get rid of the constitution, when you say that it is a living document
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.400]  that isn't a controlling legal authority, as Al Gore said, we have no controlling legal
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:31.760]  authority here. As Ron Wyden is saying, we don't know where the administration is, tell
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:36.520]  us where we are. You're standing on slippery sand. You have no foundation to stand on.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:40.380]  Slippery sand, slippery slope leads to all-out despotism and tyranny. It's just happened
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:44.120]  over and over in history. That's what's so frustrating about it. We'll get more into
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:48.280]  that. We're gonna take calls as soon as we get on the other side of this break.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.720]  And of course, David Knight will be hosting the Info Wars Nightly News tonight. We're
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.560]  doing it live this week, ladies and gentlemen. How exciting is that? Tune in, tell your friends,
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.840]  subscribe, share it. Let's get the word out. Let's change things.
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:05.540]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:09.520]  through the year. From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:13.060]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:16.920]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. My friends at eFoods Direct hear
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:20.820]  from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:25.360]  of food on hand. Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said,
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:29.520]  almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.560]  to be able to help my sister and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.480]  years too early and one day too late.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:06:03.920]  Now that we have moved into the winter season,
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:09.240]  there is an increased need to support our immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:14.760]  committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:20.460]  Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce nano silver solutions, our 2-ounce
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:26.440]  nano silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps. Just released
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:33.280]  is our 100% natural silver gel. Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents,
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:38.160]  which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface. But rather, we have formulated
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:43.600]  our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:51.440]  and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com

[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:04.720]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:09.480]  Don't be one of them. Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:14.660]  spectrum antibacterial solution. Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:19.500]  solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold and food poisoning
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:24.360]  and help improve wound healing. Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:29.480]  while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases such as strep, staph,
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:34.680]  colonia, colds, flus and other harmful pathogens. This new technology has the ability to terminate

[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, the world is being made and remade according to a very disgusting,
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:37.840]  dark, repugnant to the Constitution, authoritarian design. Just this week we see as Treasury
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:43.500]  Secretary Timothy Geithner leaves office for Jacob Lew to take his place. He's rejoining
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.800]  the Council on Foreign Relations vowed to destroy the country. They've got new news
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:52.560]  on GMO. But back to David Knight first, you were finishing up your points on torture on
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.320]  drones and this whole war on terror. Yeah, there was just one exchange that I thought
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:01.800]  was really critical. They placed about a year ago and it was Representative Tom Graves talking
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:08.280]  to FBI Director Robert Mueller. And Tom Graves said him, so I guess from a historical perspective,
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:12.320]  does the federal government have the ability to kill a US citizen on United States soil
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:18.100]  or only overseas? And this is what the FBI director said, I'm gonna defer that to others
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:23.120]  in the Justice Department. Would not give him a clear answer. So we know where this
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.640]  is headed, right?
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.640]  Yes.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:29.560]  And when the Justice Department came in, Eric Holder said that there are no limits to quote
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:34.600]  the geographic scope of our ability to use force. And they made it clear all these senators
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:40.600]  who cannot find it amongst themselves to oppose torture or to oppose drone assassinations.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:46.740]  These are also the senators that just voted this last November unanimously for the indefinite
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:50.520]  detention of American citizens on American soil under the NDAA.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:56.160]  Yeah, they've been over and just passed the NDAA, completely stripping away any of the
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.880]  last messages of our due process of our Bill of Rights. But just read that quote one more
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.160]  time because we've seen how they're trying to bring the drone war, the occupation of
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:09.720]  America home. That's what all the continuity of government, all the leaked documents about
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:15.320]  FEMA camps to just general Homeland Security operations, all the painting of dissidents
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.600]  and patriots and returning veterans.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:24.680]  They want them all in the eyes of the public disarmed in terms of their ideology and their
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.240]  ability just to operate and be individuals in this country. Read that quote one more
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.980]  time because they are planning to bring home this war to American soil.
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:41.440]  Holder said there are no limits to the geographic scope of our ability to use force. No limits.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:44.780]  And clearly they don't see if there's any legal limits to what they can do in terms
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:52.320]  of the military use of using the military's police, militarizing the police, indefinite
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:57.320]  detention without trial, execution of people without trial, execution of people even without
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:02.600]  a crime having been committed, without evidence of a crime even being planned merely by somebody's
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:06.920]  association with a group that they target and label as terrorist.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:10.920]  And that's a label that we've talked about has been thrown around pretty indiscriminately
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.800]  and at a lot of people.
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.960]  And there's Eric Holder knowingly with the blood of Fast and Furious on his hands. And
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:23.000]  he and John Brennan and Obama think that because they do these unconstitutional immoral things
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.960]  by proxy that somehow that doesn't morally fall back on them.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.200]  They're gonna have a big price to pay in their soul. But at the same time, we've got to work
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:36.600]  overtime to expose them, to get them out of power. I wanna go to a call and we can continue
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.120]  this discussion. Frank in Indiana, you've been holding the longest.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:45.560]  Yeah, thank you, gentlemen. And what I wanted to talk about is exactly what you're talking
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:51.600]  about. First of all, I wanna call everyone, make your peace with God, pick up the Bible,
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:58.560]  start in Matthew or John. And second of all, now is the time for civil disobedience and
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.760]  for political activism. You're going along with what you guys are saying. That's why
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:08.360]  they're putting 30,000 drones in disguise. That's why they're putting all these TV shows,
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:14.200]  demonizing the founding fathers and guns because it's getting to the point to where they are
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:20.160]  going to call the Americans the terrorists and they will justify killing us. And that's
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:25.040]  exactly where it's headed to. You look at all the rounds of ammo, almost 2 billion rounds
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:31.880]  of ammo. Why? Why? I think about it, people. Now's the time to stand up because listening
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:39.560]  to the show just isn't enough. I plead with everybody, please stand up and take action.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:44.400]  And one more thing I would like to suggest, I'd like to suggest a come and take it bumper
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.960]  sticker with infowars.com at the bottom of it.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:52.020]  Great, I agree. And of course, you're right, we need to get right with God. But the other
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:57.640]  reason to go read the Bible is a lot of Christian people sometimes just focus on the New Testament.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:03.800]  The Old Testament is an incredible line of how history cycles over and over. And when
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.760]  the Jewish people broke the covenant, they were always dominated and they would have
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.480]  usurper takeover or they'd be taken over by another tribe. And you can see over and over
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.660]  again how when you break the system, when you go against the Constitution in the case
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:21.880]  of our country, the moral indignation, the ruin that it brings upon you, your response,
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880]  David?
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:27.440]  Well, that brings us to the interpretation of Romans 13, right? Many churches have adopted
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:31.680]  the same interpretation of it that was popular in Nazi Germany, which is, if somebody is
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:35.680]  an authority, they're obviously been put there by God and they have the right to do whatever
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:41.580]  they want to. That's how you get to Nuremberg. But the real interpretation of Romans 13 is
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:48.320]  that God establishes governments to help to establish legal authority and to create a
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.040]  peaceful system.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:56.840]  And once these governments get out of line of what is good, what God defines as good
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:01.520]  out of things that are absolutely, obviously moral to everybody, whether you're a Christian
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:06.440]  or not. You understand that killing people who haven't done anything to harm somebody,
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:10.640]  that grates against you whether you're a Christian or not. You've got that natural understanding
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.600]  of that. And so once you get a government that starts acting in a criminal way, that's
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:20.580]  essentially the same as if you've got a father and a family who was abusing his wife or children.
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:26.240]  That father no longer is using the role that he is no longer in the legitimate role that
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:30.680]  he's been put in. He has lost his authority. That's what's happened to our government.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:35.640]  And as the caller points out, it's time for us to start doing things, looking for organizations,
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:41.480]  looking for ways to peacefully and legally try to stop this with civil disobedience because
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:46.000]  it is quite clear that we're not going to find any allies in either the Republican or
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  the Democratic Party.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  There's one-
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.200]  No, we know who they're working for.
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.280]  Right, and we know that the electoral system is completely corrupted. And so we can see
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:58.400]  that none of them have any problems with these policies that we're talking about of assassination,
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:04.840]  endless undeclared war, torturing, you name it. Suspending due process for people, suspending-
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.920]  Well, that's why the Bible also talks about my people perish for a lack of a vision. We
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.960]  have to use the info wars, a vector point to re-identify. Are you going to be with the
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:17.440]  Bill of Rights? Are you going to be for due process? Or are you going to be just for arbitrary
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.520]  law and dictators running rough shot all over everyone?
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:25.840]  Now our next caller, I see the name is Matt Lapasic. That's one of the biggest We Are
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:30.640]  Change activists. He's been doing this for years, many events over the years. Welcome
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.640]  to the show, Matt.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.640]  Hey, how are you doing?
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:34.640]  Pretty good.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:40.000]  Hey, I'm calling in today because this is one of those red alert type of days. We found
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:46.120]  out on January 25th, Keith Pantaleum, another old We Are Change member here in New York,
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:51.340]  was actually arrested on some very, very, very serious charges. You may have heard the
[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:55.600]  other day when Glenn called in from New Jersey to let everybody know, when I first found
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:56.600]  out.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:02.040]  So we're trying to get the word out. Keith's been with us since 2008, and now he's been
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:06.440]  in jail in Hudson County since the 25th of January. He's in jail right now.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:09.720]  Hold on one second. They're saying they have the story over there. Can we pull that up
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:15.640]  while you're giving us the story here? I just want to see what's going on. Okay, they're
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:20.320]  letting me know in the booth. They've been following the story. Please continue, Matt.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:27.200]  Well, a pseudo journalist over there at NJ.com ran a wonderful hit piece associating Keith
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.600]  with the Sandy Hook massacre because he simply had a rifle and a handgun and a couple of
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.920]  other weapons in his home, all of which were legally acquired.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:43.400]  This is the big bullet point here. What happened is that the upstairs tenant in Keith's apartment
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.800]  simply called the police, called the police because he didn't have heat in his building.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:52.680]  The police arrived at Keith's apartment and the landlord was there and let him into Keith's
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:57.200]  apartment. Not knowing that Keith was there, Keith heard some noises and he immediately
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:03.960]  reacted and he left his bedroom to find a man standing in his living room dressed in
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.520]  plain black.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:09.260]  And then he saw his door was open, a police officer and a landlord. Keith at that time
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:14.360]  had his gun in his hand. He was responding to noises. And at that point, the police officer
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:22.440]  arrested him. We have pretty much a campaign right now at tyrannyredalert.com. I hate to
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:27.640]  ask for donations. We never like doing this, but tyrannyredalert.com is a quick domain
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.840]  that we bought. This is redirecting to Keith's donation page.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:37.500]  Keith is currently on a $75,000 bond. We're currently looking to get $10,000 in order
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:44.000]  to get the attorney. Keith's father has already donated $5,000. Wonderful people like all
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.760]  of you have already donated at tyrannyredalert.com.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.040]  Can we pull that story back up? We found it. It's been in the New Jersey press, the very
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:56.140]  story you're talking about. Jersey City police say man had a legal rifle, handguns, prohibited
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:18:01.300]  bullets in his home. So people can look at that headline to see more about the story.
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:04.400]  So what exactly has he been charged with?
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.060]  As of right now is it charges are unlawful possession of two handguns, unlawful possession
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:13.200]  of his rifle, unlawful possession of his ammunition and felony possession of an assault rifle.
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:17.840]  All because without a warrant, without so much even as a knock on the door, the landlord
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:24.800]  lets a gentleman police officers into his apartment. And when Keith simply opens his
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.680]  bedroom door, he sees police officers. He's got a gun in his hand. He immediately realizes
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.920]  what's going down. He puts the gun down. The officer asked what was that because it was
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:39.440]  in its holder, all zipped up. The officer then immediately saw the gun and arrested
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:43.960]  him, then asked for receipts, then even checked the validity of any of the guns.
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:48.520]  Nowadays in 2013, you have got a gun, you are a enemy.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:54.680]  Sure, they brainwashed everybody. So yeah, that's the case of Keith Pantaleon. We can
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.160]  look that up, David Keith.
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:00.040]  That certainly is the case that's going on there. There's been other cases. There was
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:05.980]  one, I remember a guy was in the process of moving across country and he was just stopping
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:11.640]  through New Jersey, I believe. He had in his trunk some weapons that were stored in his
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:14.640]  trunk, along with the other stuff he was clearly moving.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:19.400]  And his mother was concerned about him, called the police. They pulled the guy over and they
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.240]  conducted a search of his car, found the weapons, and then went to send him to jail for a very
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:27.660]  long time. These types of things that you're seeing happening in New Jersey, this is what's
[01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:32.380]  going to happen across the country if these kinds of gun control laws go through.
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:36.220]  This is what we all need. Help this person here, but also understand this is a pattern
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:40.480]  of tyranny and of jeopardy that is going to be facing all gun owners if we don't stop
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.480]  this law.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.000]  Or the other case where the New York police say, we don't have a duty to protect you and
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.940]  we'll stand by even if you're being stabbed by a serial killer. We're going to get to
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:53.140]  more calls on the other side. Jacari Jackson coming up to bring some fresh news to us.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:59.700]  David Ortiz, Melissa Melton later in the broadcast. And stay tuned, we got exciting stuff on this
[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:00.700]  Info Wars.

[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:06.980]  Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:13.060]  280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:18.360]  device poses the greatest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.440]  Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:27.260]  about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:31.980]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:38.080]  just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:43.760]  off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:48.940]  exactly what it is. Plus, discover the number one way you and your family can survive this
[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:54.180]  deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online. So go to weirddevice.com
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:57.820]  before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:01.740]  Oh, great. Now I've got to go to court.
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:04.380]  Meet Tina now facing a future court date.

[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:32.500]  since 1997. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers
[01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:37.220]  investment advisors want to talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986. Yet
[01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:41.820]  the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:45.780]  outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:51.540]  for your retirement call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:59.360]  returns call 800-686-2237. Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:04.260]  It's time for a home security quiz. Answer this. What effective home security device
[01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:08.580]  is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:13.480]  while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:20.540]  and sells for less than $35? Yes, it's fake TV. This year about one in every 50 US homes
[01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:25.300]  will have a break in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that
[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:30.340]  looks like no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:35.740]  like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:41.340]  on a timer but far more convincing. And for only $34.95 fake TV could be the difference
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:46.920]  between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. Go to faketv.com or
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:24:01.420]  call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:22.900]  We're back at infowars.com. On the other side of this break at the bottom of the hour,
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:27.620]  we're gonna be joined by Jakari Jackson. He's gonna be covering some rather disturbing news.
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:32.020]  Yeah, there's a dark side to the Super Bowl and there's something that happens to society
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:37.600]  when we give in and reduce ourselves to bread and circuses. That's why we need to accelerate
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:42.620]  this reawakening but we're gonna jam in some calls. Cody in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding.
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:51.580]  How you doing, man? Hey, I'm alright. How you doing? Good. My comment was in reference
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:25:00.940]  to you and David were talking about just how DHS and other government groups are targeting
[01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:11.220]  gun owners, libertarians and things like that. I had an experience before both of the shootings
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:20.220]  happened in Colorado in Newtown where I tried to purchase a handgun and was denied, although
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:28.380]  I have no felonies or any misdemeanors that would be considered a restriction on owning
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:32.460]  a handgun. So you think you were flagged in the system for political speech or what's
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:38.820]  going on? Well, the thing is, is later on, I had a gun stolen out of my car, my first
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:44.660]  handgun, which I was approved for, and it was about two years old before it got stolen
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:49.860]  and I went to report it to the police station and the police told me that it was in the
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:53.580]  original owner's name and that the state hadn't put in the information.
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:58.540]  Oh, so they forced the registration, the tracking of serial numbers, and then you get identified
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:03.340]  as the criminal when an actual criminal steals your weapon. Isn't that interesting? Something
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:07.460]  that doesn't seem to come up in the mainstream discussion. Well, let me give you 30 more
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:13.100]  seconds and we're going to move on. Yeah, I mean, I just say if I got pulled over and
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:19.060]  they wanted to check my car and everything else because I have political speech stickers
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:24.660]  on my car and I had my handgun and I was legally carrying it, I would have went to jail until
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:29.500]  they figured out that they made a mistake and I probably would have been denied a handgun
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:35.460]  for that reason after the fact until they sorted their mess out and with no regard to
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:38.220]  my safety. I hear you, it's troubling. Your phone's a
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:41.300]  little bad, so I'm going to let you go, but I appreciate the call. That is something to
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:46.460]  think about how registration can unfairly target someone and deny them their Second
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.420]  Amendment rights.
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:53.820]  There's so many troubling aspects with the gun control agenda that they want. We've analyzed
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:58.740]  it in detail. Let's see what Janos in Canada has to say. Thanks for holding.
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:03.980]  Hi, how are you? I'm hanging in there. What are you bringing
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:13.100]  to the discussion today? Can I express myself or I need to follow the exact topic of the
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:16.540]  gun control? It's open phones, but you got to move quickly
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:19.940]  because we're coming up on a break and we're trying to get phones.
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:27.060]  Okay, okay. I stopped watching television. There's so much evil there. All this mind
[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:35.140]  control there is just incredible. What I wanted to say is that it's so demonized. They try
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:42.500]  to hypnotize people's minds and souls so you don't have time for your family. You can't
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:52.980]  be focused. It's all propaganda on TV. I cannot believe this. Me as a believer, as a Christian,
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:28:00.340]  I trust Jesus. And that's what I say to people, to all Americans and Canadians, to trust Jesus.
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:04.660]  Jesus is the way. Jesus said, I am the way, the true and the
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:08.860]  life. No man cometh in the Father, but mine me. But people now, they're putting their
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:15.940]  faith in the government. They believe all these lies all the time. And I don't vote
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:22.060]  for governmental officials. I don't vote for, let's say example, Stephen Harper from Canada
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:27.420]  or Obama. They're all Freemasons. They're all liars.
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:31.660]  They're all caught up in the system and all these entertainers are too. And that's why
[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:37.540]  we see at these Super Bowls and other high television rituals, such an extreme display
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:42.340]  of these occultic hidden symbols. And there is an aspect of mind control going on. It
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:46.420]  seems unbelievable to many people, but if you look more deeply into it, it's there.
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:49.780]  We're gonna get into that in the third hour, actually. So I appreciate you bringing the
[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:54.860]  topic. Let's finish out the segment with Dave in Arizona. Thanks for holding, Dave.
[01:28:54.860 --> 01:29:00.660]  Oh, yes. Hi, Aaron. I'm just gonna hit you right with the jab first. I think the mark
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:08.100]  of the beast is in effect right now. And I'm gonna explain why. We don't wanna be part
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.940]  of the evil done by the United States. Is that correct?
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:13.940]  Yeah, you got about 40 seconds, but I'm with you on the point.
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:17.620]  Hey, we have freedom of religion. Is that correct?
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:21.060]  We're told we are, and it's pretty much what we decide to express, though.
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:25.660]  Okay, well, the United States forces us to keep the beast alive. What if my religion
[01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:31.220]  says I cannot take the name of an evil nation or use a number by which money is taken from
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:36.220]  my wages? What if I wanna think one way, but a government tries to force me to think another?
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:40.580]  You can't own property. It's hard to get a job, if not impossible, without a Social Security
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:45.260]  number. You've gotta buy and sell under the cashless grid. It's coming. Thanks for your
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:50.140]  call. We are going to break, but we're gonna be back on the other side with Sha'Carri Jackson.
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:30:01.200]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.900]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms. But if you don't have a home security
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:10.660]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection. When

[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:05.740]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:09.700]  through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:13.940]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:18.020]  to those that have lost everything. My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every

[01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:26.740]  from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery stores
[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:30.820]  are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:34.920]  and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day

[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:57.280]  is joining me and it's true. You can decide what you're going to believe, how far down
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:01.620]  the rabbit hole you're going to go, but if you do go, don't look away. Embrace the truth
[01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:06.020]  because there's some powerful stuff going on. If we don't route it out, we're all going
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:09.880]  to be toppled over by that evil. Now we're going to get into the Super Bowl and some
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:15.540]  of the many dangerous aspects of it, but first let's jam in one more call. JC in Connecticut,
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:21.220]  thanks for holding. Hey, how you doing today? Hey, how you doing? I'm doing all right. I
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:24.100]  wanted to talk really quick about a couple of things. First of all, I want to get into
[01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:30.140]  the grand simulation thing. It's cool to call it computer simulation. I believe it's a little
[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:35.420]  more advanced than that. Obviously, considering we're taking a tiny, tiny slice of it and
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:42.940]  then using our most powerful computer to decode it, but as all computers are, they're built
[01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:48.620]  on code. Our computers are built on binary. If anyone's interested in the code of the
[01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:54.620]  universe, I would look up sacred geometry, but I had one more thing I wanted to get into.
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:35:00.380]  Yesterday, something happened on air. Alex started getting really... He started getting
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:04.740]  to him. I could hear it in his voice and it got to me too because I feel the same way.
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:08.500]  I could hear all these things, all this information. I'm pretty sure a lot of your listeners have
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:15.140]  the same thing. It's not his fault. He's not trying to bring anyone down, but that's the
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:19.460]  nature of the information. This is the only show that gives out the good information,
[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:27.620]  which is great, but I wanted to put something into the awareness of people. If anyone's
[01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:33.140]  out there who is into the reason why everything is so depraved and everything is so messed
[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:42.140]  up, there's an article on called Rise of the Archons and another one called Never Call
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:47.340]  Them Archons. Now, it's really out there. A lot of people, a lot of your listeners,
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:53.060]  people ridiculed him on getting into God and Jesus and religion and all that. You know
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:58.820]  what? That's great that he has... He believes in the one true God, the one person everyone
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:04.900]  has to answer to. It's not necessarily religion to believe in someone who has all the answers
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:11.180]  to the one person where everything was created from, or the one enough person, so much being.
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:15.460]  But I wanted to get that out there. I hate when people start ridiculing God because I
[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:18.740]  do the same thing with religion. As soon as someone starts talking related, starts talking
[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:23.220]  God, there's a negative connotation there. People start thinking, oh, he's into religion
[01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:33.020]  and I can't listen to it. There is a one true being out there and everyone's got an answer
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:37.820]  to him, but everyone is a product of that creation with the same free will that that
[01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:44.900]  creator has and has given us. So reading up on the archons, it's something that even if
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:52.900]  you ridicule it and don't view it as truth, you are now aware of that possibility.
[01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:57.460]  I appreciate that, caller, and I wasn't necessarily going to get into the whole are we a computer
[01:36:57.460 --> 01:37:02.540]  simulation aspect today. It's obviously deeply philosophical, but the Bible talks about it
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:07.620]  being a great test clearly refers to dimensions. If you don't go for that metaphor, if you
[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:11.220]  want to take it as a metaphor rather than truth, you've got the matrix. Either way you
[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:15.960]  look at it, we're being deceived, yet the actions we take, the moral stances we take
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:21.300]  make a difference in this world. Martin Luther King talked about how the universe tends towards
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:26.320]  justice. Well, that's only if we stand with our free will, as you mentioned, on principle
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:27.720]  and turn against the darkness.
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:32.220]  If we stand down, if we look away, if we don't hold accountable those who've taken the range
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:37.140]  of power, they're going to try to tip it towards darkness, annihilation. And really, it's a
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:41.180]  good segue into the kind of topic we're going to talk about. Jakari Jackson, you've been
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:45.520]  reading through the news, you've been growing your mind here at the Infowar, already a great
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:47.540]  mind and a great voice when you came here.
[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:54.060]  But it is such a dark and deep rabbit hole. There's so much information, but it reaches
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:55.060]  a point, doesn't it?
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:58.940]  It definitely does, it definitely does. And before I get into my topic right here, I just
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:03.580]  want people to know we're following the situation in Tunisia. And I believe it's the article
[01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:09.220]  we have pulled up on our screen in here. I believe this gentleman's name is Chokhi Belaid,
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:12.920]  was shot dead outside his home on Wednesday morning, throwing the country into confusion
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.300]  and prompting angry protest.
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:21.020]  This seems to be one of the things that sparked the recent protest in Tunisia. So I just wanted
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:25.180]  to throw that out there. But yes, what you were saying, Aaron, it's kind of a dark time,
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:28.500]  and I believe Melissa Melton has already touched on this. I believe she'll be touching on it
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:33.540]  again today, some of the occultism going on at the Super Bowl and other big events.
[01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:39.100]  Not just the Super Bowl, not blaming the Baltimore Ravens for all these Illuminati symbols and
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:44.180]  whatever else going on. But there is a dark side to sporting events in general, and I'm
[01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:50.060]  not blaming the sports institutions. But we have this article out of the Huffington Post.
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:56.460]  Super Bowl is single largest human trafficking incident in US as the Attorney General. Now,
[01:38:56.460 --> 01:39:02.260]  this is something that came to my attention a few months ago. And it really bothered me
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:07.140]  to see that there's such a large gathering for human trafficking, but it's something
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:08.300]  under the table.
[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:11.500]  We even talked about a little bit when Formula One came here, and I actually have an article
[01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:15.580]  about that I'll get to in a second, about how so many people are trafficked at these
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:22.940]  events. Prostitutes are brought in, some of them underage. And it's this big show in
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:26.200]  the sportsmanship and all that's well and good, but then you have this underside when
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:30.380]  the game's over and people go to the hotels, they go wherever, and they interact with these
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:31.380]  prostitutes.
[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:32.380]  That makes sense.
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:38.980]  And human trafficking isn't just sexual trafficking, it's debt bondage, indentured servitude. And
[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:43.220]  we'll start off with some sexual bondage, but it's all types of things. I just wanna
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.220]  read a little bit from this article.
[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:51.540]  According to Forbes, 10,000 prostitutes were brought to Miami for the Super Bowl in 2010.
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:57.060]  As of Friday, this is in current times, as of Friday, five women were rescued and eight
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:02.500]  human trafficking related arrests were made in New Orleans, according to Fox 8. And that's
[01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:03.500]  just the tip.
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:08.500]  I mean, I have stacks, cuz I originally wasn't even gonna talk about this today, because
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:11.580]  I didn't think I could get enough information in time. But problem was, I didn't have enough
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:16.260]  time to read through all these articles. There's just so much information on the topic, and
[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:20.380]  I have this next story from the International Business Times.
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:25.740]  Sex trafficking at the Super Bowl, does America's dirtiest secret tarnish the NFL's biggest
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:29.140]  event? And once again, I'm not blaming the NFL or any of these organizations, but this
[01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:31.740]  is definitely something that's going on at these events.
[01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:40.020]  Well, it's a societal thing. Yeah, and it's all over. It's the NFL, this one is about
[01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:44.620]  the NBA. Now, this isn't so much about trafficking at the NBA, but the NBA got to a point. They
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:48.540]  said, we need to speak out against this, and they actually went to Greece to demonstrate
[01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:49.540]  against it.
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:54.380]  I mean, it's a huge problem. Well, look how the Super Bowl brings together kind of the
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:59.600]  worst aspects of society. I think it's great to be an athlete, being competitive and trying
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:03.540]  to make yourself as good as you could be. Obviously, it makes sense. Being on sports
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:09.660]  teams is fine. But in general, we've got a degraded, slipping away society. We're falling
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:14.160]  apart at the seams because people are tuning into these sporting events.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:18.140]  They're losing touch with what's important, their family, the reasons for the country,
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:23.340]  the most important institutions, keeping people accountable. And it's very much a parallel
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:29.140]  to Roman history, which was a republic as well for 600 years. Then it was taken over
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:33.980]  by emperors, and things just went downhill because the population in general, they called
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:35.540]  it bread and circuses.
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:40.920]  They'd be paid off with doles of bread, given free stuff, given entertainment. And this
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:46.860]  allowed them to get in the mindset of buying into gladiatorial sports, celebrating two
[01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:51.860]  warriors killing each other just for sport, just for show, bringing in slaves and letting
[01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:58.060]  them be slaughtered by a gladiator, who himself is a slave but is a highly trained one. And
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:01.200]  this is, again, it's not the athletes necessarily.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:06.500]  It's that the Super Bowl is the big spectacle. It's where all of television watching culminates
[01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:07.500]  in a focus point.
[01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:11.460]  And I believe this last one was the most watched event in history, if I saw that.
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:16.020]  But look at who attends the Super Bowl. Those are high priced tickets. These are elite rich
[01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:21.380]  people. Not all rich people, bad of course, but many of them get into these decadent forms
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:26.860]  of society using prostitutes. And that's why you have 10,000 prostitutes there.
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:33.100]  This epidemic of child slavery, and it just goes along with actually the kind of Masonic,
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:39.680]  Satanic, Illuminati type symbolism that we've seen put on display by Madonna, by these other
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:44.820]  entertainers and artists. This year was Beyonce. People wonder why we talk about celebrities
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:45.980]  and what they show in their entertainment.
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:51.780]  Well, it's a big mass ritual, a big spectacle for culture. And it's meant to represent the
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:56.820]  overall culture of sports watching, television viewing, and it kind of underscores where
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:01.660]  we're at in society. But get back to the actual human trafficking stuff, because it's a big
[01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:08.140]  problem in general in society. And here it is at what everybody perceives to be an innocent
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:09.140]  event, the Super Bowl.
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:13.820]  You get your chips, you have some snack foods at home, and you get together with your buddies.
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:17.700]  But there's a lot more to it underneath what people see.
[01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:22.860]  Exactly, and we even have this article here. ESPN got to a point where they had to talk
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:28.820]  about it. This was particularly about the World Cup back in 2010. And it said the Johannesburg
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:33.660]  police estimated that 38,000 children each year were being forced into prostitution in
[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:36.180]  South Africa.
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:41.060]  Some estimates are that the number is closer to 20,000, even if it's 20,000. Just in this
[01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:46.380]  one area, and that's where they had the World Cup a few years ago. And then this article
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:51.340]  I was referring to about Austin. Few arrests, no minor victims at Formula One sex trafficking
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:56.460]  operation. And this article goes on to say they arrested 13 prostitutes at the Formula
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:59.000]  One event just a few months ago.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.620]  And I mean, it goes on from that. That's just the opening of Pandora's box, so to speak.
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:09.020]  And I have these FBI crime statistics from back in 2010. And this is human trafficking
[01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:16.180]  incident cases open for investigation between January 2008 and 2010. So these are just the
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:19.580]  incidents that had cases opened on them. Many of these incidents go unreported.
[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:22.060]  Yeah, it's vastly unreported. Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:26.980]  And I mean, it's shocking to me cuz you see they had a total, and these are just the ones
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:33.940]  they knew about, 2,515 total incidents. They have sex trafficking at over 2,000, labor
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:39.400]  trafficking over 200, and other types of unknown trafficking.
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:43.780]  And you ask yourself why. I mean, prostitution is the oldest business in the world, as they
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:48.060]  say. Maybe it's not even prostitution itself. Maybe it's this eugenics culture in terms
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:53.020]  of life has become very cheap, especially in these authoritarian regimes. I mean, again,
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:58.480]  look at China. They prevented 400,000 births through abortion and family planning.
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:03.180]  But then when they have girls, well, Chinese society wants a boy because they want someone
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:08.220]  who can get a job and support them. So the girls become practically worthless in the
[01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:13.100]  eyes of many in that society. And these are the kind of vulnerable people who get sucked
[01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:18.300]  into the sex trafficking, slavery aspects of things, and who's looking out for them
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:22.940]  because life has become so cheap. Yeah, exactly, these eugenicists, these people
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:27.260]  who get on there and they brag and they say, we wanna reduce the world population by X
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:31.600]  number of percent. They don't care if you're one of the people who lives through that.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:35.620]  They don't care if you're a prostitute or you're a slave or you're whatever else. I
[01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:39.140]  mean, it's a huge problem. It goes way beyond trafficking. That's what we're talking about
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:42.800]  here today, but it goes way beyond trafficking.
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:49.300]  But in Roman terms, the Super Bowl has really devolved into a grand orgy spectacle where
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:54.260]  the most elite of society get together for, again, this big mass ritual and they just
[01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:58.220]  engage in all kinds of things. Yeah, I mean, the halftime shows, and I believe
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:01.280]  Melissa Nelson's gonna talk about this in a little bit, the halftime shows are just
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:06.700]  big Illuminati. Whether you believe in that or not, they're just big cultic symbolism.
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:10.620]  I mean, you can just look at the stuff and I mean, she'll break it down better than I
[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:15.020]  can but it's so much symbolism and it's not a nice family event anymore.
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:18.760]  Years past, you could take your kids and maybe you had enough money to take the neighbor
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:23.300]  kid down to the football game. You guys all have a good time and now, I mean, the thing
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:29.700]  so it's so grandiose. I mean, and it's so absurd just over the top, even the halftime
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:34.020]  shows. I mean, if I had a daughter, I wouldn't want her to watch all the stuff that goes
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:36.720]  on there. Yeah, it's just weird and inappropriate for
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:41.140]  a general audience but I would also submit the whole deal with symbolism. It is what
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:45.260]  it is, you can read into the symbolism, there's different interpretations of the meaning.
[01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:50.020]  But it mainly it's a hidden language meant for those who have, as the Bible says, eyes
[01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:54.620]  to see, ears to hear. If you don't know what you're looking at, how is that affecting your
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:47:00.500]  subconscious? I mean, what if Madonna or Beyonce got on stage and started speaking Greek to
[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:03.480]  an English speaking audience or speaking Arabic?
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:07.640]  You would wonder what they're trying to say in a hidden coded fashion. Why are they talking
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:10.620]  in a language that's not understood by people? Exactly.
[01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:15.620]  That's one of the ways we need to look at these hidden languages. But again, it becomes
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:21.180]  an excuse for people who are already decadent to go all out. And they did this in Roman
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:27.460]  society during what we know today is the Christmas time, then it was Saturnalia Festival. And
[01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:32.280]  in my view, it's very tied to satanic practices, where they would just encourage this kind
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:37.800]  of running wild, running rampant, and just evolving more and more into this bread and
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.300]  circuses mentality.
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:43.740]  And again, you give up your right to control your own life, to control society and to hold
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:47.860]  any of your leaders even remotely accountable when you give in to this kind of behavior
[01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:52.140]  as a general society. I'm not judging anyone in particular for the things they're getting
[01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:58.080]  involved in. But clearly this is abusive stuff. It's horrible to women and we'd like to rein
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:00.420]  it in. It's such a hidden problem though.
[01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:02.700]  It is. As you mentioned, it goes under reported.
[01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:07.460]  It's the white slavery as it's called. And it's not slavery of white people. It's this
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:14.540]  sex slavery. It's this indentured servitude, this we own you kind of aspect. And it's way
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:20.900]  beyond the US. It's way beyond just women. I mean, there's children. I mean, to a much
[01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:26.180]  lower extent, even men get sucked into this, adult males. But it's really large amounts
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:27.180]  of women.
[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:33.140]  Next article here, human trafficking to UK rising. And this says, last year the authorities
[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:42.580]  learned of 946 victims compared to 710 in 2010. The report said that 712 adult victims
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:48.700]  and 234 child victims were reported last year to the National Referral Mechanism. I actually
[01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:49.700]  have this graph here.
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:54.100]  Let me get a shot of this. And you can see the countries where these people are coming
[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:59.980]  from. You see Nigeria in the lead, Vietnam, Romania, and the list goes down from there.
[01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:05.480]  And it says that the top 10 countries account for 64% of all referrals.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:10.260]  And again, Nigeria country with a high birth rate. So they've told us in the eugenics mentality,
[01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:13.900]  those are worthless people. Don't worry about them. Who cares what happens to them? We just
[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:19.020]  need less of them. That is a disgusting mentality. And Alex has talked about this. I don't have
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:22.320]  the articles in front of me cuz I wasn't prepared to talk about this.
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:28.900]  But Dine Corps, the military contractor, got caught trafficking human slaves, sex slaves.
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:33.460]  The United Nations has been part of this. And the United Nations in Africa just lets
[01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:39.020]  these dictators slaughter their own people, encourages these factionalized wars, and disarms
[01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:45.140]  populations to keep them from being able to resist and institute kind of a normal society.
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:50.940]  While they look the other way to these mass epidemics, the systematic abuse of sex slavery,
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:56.020]  human trafficking, you name it. And in the case of Dine Corps, they were caught, as in
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:50:00.580]  the system knew about it. They were investigated. There were hearings in Congress even, but
[01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:03.420]  basically it was at most a slap on the wrist.
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:08.260]  They got some fines. The system looks the other way because they, at the top, the most
[01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:13.340]  elite people want to engage in this. They're blackmailed into going along with it. And
[01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:18.500]  it becomes epidemic with these illegitimate systems of government that have taken us over.
[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:22.900]  Look at the climate change hearings. Again, on behalf of the United Nations, they had
[01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:27.780]  them. I think the Copenhagen hearing, they had the largest influx at that time of known
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:31.180]  prostitutes. And of course, there's an underbelly again to that.
[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:35.660]  Are we going to break? We're going to break. We'll come back with your final thoughts,
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:40.740]  maybe take some more calls. And then coming ahead, we've got David Ortiz, Melissa Melton,
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:44.540]  and more of our great reporters for the Infowars Nightly News. It's getting exciting, isn't
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:45.540]  it?

[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:15.160]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the

[01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:19.820]  Aaron Dikes sitting in for Alex Jones. We're back on the broadcast, Infowars.com. Of course,
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:24.780]  tonight, 7 p.m. Central. The Infowars Nightly News, again, we're doing it live this week
[01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:29.140]  and it's exciting. David Knight's gonna do it tonight. I've done it the past two nights.
[01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:32.660]  Jakari Jackson, we're coming to the end of the hour. We've got other reporters coming
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:38.940]  in with different topics. But finish up on the dark side of the Super Bowl, the sex trafficking
[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:41.140]  slavery issue nobody wants to talk about.
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:46.300]  Right, and it's not just a Super Bowl. I mean, it's all over. It's in various aspects of
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:51.260]  entertainment, not just sports. I mean, it's all over and I mean, it's a big deal and I
[01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:54.740]  don't wanna limit it just to that. But in my closing remarks, I wanna bring up some
[01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:59.940]  of these remarks that various officials have made concerning just things such as rape and
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:01.100]  trafficking and such as that.
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:06.900]  And I have this article right here. US judge says victims' bodies can prevent rape. Yes,
[01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:11.980]  it is as absurd as he said it. A Southern California judge is being publicly admonished
[01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:17.060]  for saying rape victims didn't put up a fight during her assault. The California Commission
[01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:23.320]  on Judicial Performance voted 10 to 0 to impose a public admonishment Thursday, saying Supreme
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:28.780]  Court Judge Derrick Johnson's comments were inappropriate in a breach of judicial ethics.
[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:30.160]  Blame the victim mentality.
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:36.020]  That's what it is. And that's the same thing with these elitists, these globalists. You're
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:40.140]  a sex slave because you didn't put up enough of a fight to get out of that. And that's
[01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:44.400]  the mentality of many of these people, but I'll move quick to our next one.
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:50.540]  Richard Graham, UK lawmakers rape remarks draw condemnation. A British lawmaker's suggestion
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:55.740]  that young women who wear high heels and short skirts put themselves at greater risk of rape
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:56:00.420]  has drawn widespread condemnation. If you are blind drunk, these are his words, if you
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:06.500]  are blind drunk and wearing those clothes, how are you able to get away?
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:15.060]  He said to a group of people in my last one right here, corrupt judge exonerates 13 child
[01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:23.180]  sex slave traders and ignores 130 witnesses as liars. In an unprecedented case with hundreds
[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:28.400]  of witnesses, a group of judges allowed 13 accused sex slave traders to walk and believe
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:33.260]  their testimony that the victims were liars. So that's the mentality. I mean, you go to
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:41.380]  the courts to get your justice, you have 130 witnesses, and now they're liars.
[01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:47.540]  That's incredible. And again, same thing with Sandusky. They were reporting, I have an article
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:53.100]  for that, that they were reporting him as a pedophile. Yeah, here it is right here.
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:58.500]  Sandusky labeled likely pedophile in 1998 report. So they knew way back then that this
[01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:02.500]  guy was at least suspect. I mean, maybe they didn't have any concrete evidence, but going
[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:07.300]  back to 1998, they had reason to suspect this guy was up to something.
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:11.220]  Yeah, and again, of course, everyone's entitled to their defense, but he's now been convicted
[01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:15.580]  it's proven. But the first thing they did was try to discredit the witnesses and say
[01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:20.240]  that was a long time ago. You don't remember other reasons. They were supposedly their
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:24.660]  own fault for being caught up in this stuff. When it was systematic, it was across the
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:31.220]  board, it was institutionalized there at Penn State, other places around the country.
[01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:36.100]  And that's just the way these people operate. And it's really troubling stuff. You wanna
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:40.660]  take a call here? Sure, sure. Okay, we've got Paul in New Jersey. He's holding, he wants
[01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:45.540]  to talk about guns. Thanks for holding. Well, guns and everything else. I mean, I'm
[01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:52.780]  just gonna say a couple things. The UN, I mean, Al Qaeda is a terrorist organization
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:58:02.380]  for the UN. NATO is the military arm of the UN, and we're paying for it all. And you pay
[01:58:02.380 --> 01:58:08.620]  your income tax, where does it go? It goes to the IMF, International Monetary Fund. So
[01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:11.320]  we're paying for our own destruction.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:14.940]  Isn't that the truth? I'd like to do a segment in the future on the IMF and how they hold
[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:20.000]  these countries hostage. They give them loans, hold them on strings, and then they impose
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.900]  the kind of new world order corporatist system they want. We're coming up to the end of the
[01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:28.820]  hour. Appreciate you, Jakari Jackson. We'll see you in the near future, see what you're
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:29.820]  working on.
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:33.420]  We got David Ortiz, Melissa Melton ahead. Info Wars Nightly News tonight. Stay tuned.
[01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:39.780]  A lot of powerful information still ahead.

[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:32.820]  I'm joined by an array of InfoWars Nightly News reporters all doing great work, all upping
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:38.060]  their game, informing themselves, and taking it to the world so we can try to make a difference.
[02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:42.100]  Got a great crew working in the background, too. We had a quick turnaround here, getting
[02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:47.480]  people set into place. David Ortiz, you are at the helm now, so tell us what kind of things
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:51.180]  are on your mind. What have you seen in the news cycle here lately?
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:54.980]  Well there's a lot of good news going on as well, so I want to focus a little bit on some
[02:00:54.980 --> 02:01:01.420]  of the good news. And one of the good news is Senator Rand Paul is reintroducing his
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:08.180]  Audit the Fed bill. Obviously last year, that passed overwhelmingly. It was Dr. Ron Paul's
[02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:14.540]  bill, and it passed in the House, 327 to 98, overwhelmingly. And then it made its way to
[02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:20.020]  the Senate, and only 37 senators signed it. But it didn't make the floor. Had it made
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:23.700]  the floor, a lot more senators would have supported it.
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:28.140]  So just so you know, last year when it was introduced, Nancy Pelosi was quoted as saying,
[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:34.300]  I don't know that Congress and the public should be having a political impact on monetary
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:39.540]  policy. The central banks in all countries have these responsibilities. If the thought
[02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:44.980]  is we're politicizing monetary policy, I don't think that's a good idea.
[02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:49.940]  And of course, the Constitution authorizes Congress to control the currency. And it doesn't
[02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:56.300]  make sense for a private corporation, a private bank to issue and control the currency, especially
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:02:05.620]  when they're using it clearly to engage in economic warfare, excuse me. But of course,
[02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:10.500]  Ron Paul and the others who joined him finally, after tireless decades of pushing for the
[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:16.500]  issue, finally got just a partial minuscule puny kind of on the surface audit of the Federal
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:17.500]  Reserve.
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:22.500]  And they found all kinds of misappropriations, giving billions to banks, giving billions
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:28.580]  to overseas foreign banks of taxpayer money, parking it at the Federal Reserve, giving
[02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:34.060]  them interest free loans while allowing them to gain interest by just parking their money,
[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:38.420]  not loaning it out to small businesses, not using it to revive America.
[02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:43.660]  Imagine how much more devastating information we'll find through a full audit. And again,
[02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:49.180]  this is an important time because this is the year 2013, hard to believe. 100 years
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:54.580]  ago, 1913 is when they passed the act that created the Federal Reserve System, of course,
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:59.340]  in the dead of night on Christmas Eve, when most of the Congress had already been dismissed
[02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:00.900]  and went home for the holidays.
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:05.300]  They snuck it in and sabotaged against America because they know that the power to issue
[02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:10.940]  currency is the power to destroy. Rothschild said he doesn't care who has an army, who
[02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:17.540]  has political force. He doesn't care who makes the laws, just let him manipulate the currency.
[02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:18.540]  David Ortiz.
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:23.260]  Yeah, absolutely. And we have on record Bernanke saying we should print some more. They're
[02:03:23.260 --> 02:03:27.640]  almost at the end of their rope there, but he's willing to print some more. And they're
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:32.580]  devaluing our currency. I think inflation just over the last year has been about 10%.
[02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:38.460]  So the good news is that this bill is being reintroduced. And now, four people who were
[02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:43.660]  in the House last year who supported this bill are now senators. So there's a much better
[02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:50.420]  chance. Obama has stated President Obama that he will not vote for it. But if this keeps
[02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:55.600]  on passing in both chambers, he's gonna have a lot of egg on his face if he doesn't ultimately
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:56.600]  approve this.
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:00.860]  So even if it passes the Senate and the House this go around and Obama votes it down, he
[02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:07.260]  could only do that for so long before the American people demand that he pass it. So
[02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:11.060]  let's wish Senator Rand Paul luck on that.
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:16.220]  Yeah, even the worst of politicians can be politically shamed into going along with something
[02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:20.180]  that's actually good for people. I was just pulling up on Google Images, the purchasing
[02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:26.900]  power of the US dollar since 1774. That, of course, is right around the start of the American
[02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:29.080]  Revolution, the founding of the country.
[02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:33.380]  And you can see there were definitely ups and downs. There were spikes, but it remained
[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:40.140]  relatively high. Then you come to the early 1900s. It's almost a straight graph down 45
[02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:47.340]  degree angle to where we are in the present day, less than 5% of the original value of
[02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:51.880]  the dollar. That will come up more ahead, but we need to talk more about the reauthorization
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:56.420]  of the Federal Reserve Charter or rather the stopping of the Federal Reserve. We can hope
[02:04:56.420 --> 02:04:57.860]  we'll have more on the other side.
[02:04:57.860 --> 02:05:12.660]  Stay tuned, maybe even some calls.

[02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:11.420]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

[02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:25.420]  This is the Infowar, ladies and gentlemen. Engage your minds, open up to the larger reality
[02:08:25.420 --> 02:08:30.380]  and start to take back your life. There's that old saying that the best revenge is living
[02:08:30.380 --> 02:08:35.460]  well. The best way actually to defeat this tyranny is to take back the power of your
[02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:40.780]  life into your own hands. I believe we need to decentralize the power that they've concentrated
[02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:47.380]  in Washington DC, the spheres of Wall Street and the larger IMF, United Nations, Bank of
[02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:53.420]  International Settlements, World Bank system that they're erecting to spread worldwide
[02:08:53.420 --> 02:08:58.420]  tyranny. But if we just educate ourselves, tell others, of course, but change your own
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:02.620]  life, that's the best way we can do it. But of course, we're part of a nation, we're part
[02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:07.580]  of a country and currency. Again, we just blasted into it in the first short segment.
[02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:13.180]  Now we have a long segment. David Ortiz, one of our Infowars nightly reporters here. Currency
[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:17.780]  is one of the most powerful mechanisms of control there is. There's political power,
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:22.000]  there's military power. People like Rothschild said they're not so concerned about that as
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:27.220]  long as they can control the currency. And we know that in the early days of colonial
[02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:32.060]  America leading up to 1776, they had what was known as colonial script.
[02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:38.420]  They issued their own currency, and they had a vivacious lively economy there. And I think
[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:42.740]  it was Ben Franklin who talked about how when they destroy their ability to issue their
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:48.060]  own colonial script, that was the beginning of the end. That was perhaps the real trigger
[02:09:48.060 --> 02:09:52.820]  towards revolution. There were many factors, the taxation, the abuses of civil liberties
[02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:55.960]  and rights, the attempt to disarm the colonists.
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:10:00.180]  But one of the most important was that currency thing. And we're seeing these issues crop
[02:10:00.180 --> 02:10:04.900]  up again as people become educated about the Federal Reserve. And again, this is the 100
[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:09.900]  year anniversary of the tyrannical parasite, the Federal Reserve, who have changed our
[02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:15.020]  system of currency, moved it away from gold and silver, moved it away from a controlled
[02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:20.380]  based on the population fiat currency, which could work in theory, and just made it a weapon
[02:10:20.380 --> 02:10:23.220]  of all out economic sabotage.
[02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:25.540]  David Ortiz, please get back into some of these issues.
[02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:30.060]  Well, absolutely. I mean, as you were saying, our currency is being devalued. I said earlier
[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:34.380]  in the segment, it's about 10% inflation annually, according to many independent studies. And
[02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:40.740]  it seems that many states are taking action as a result of this. Last year, 13 states
[02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:47.940]  represented bills to create their own currency or to, at the very least, create a committee
[02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:50.580]  that would review the matter.
[02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:55.320]  And it moved further along, depending on each state. Wyoming, I believe, either Wyoming
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:11:00.260]  or Washington narrowly, it was voted down, but they almost created their own currency
[02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:05.500]  in one of those two states. But it seems now that lawmakers in Virginia say they wanna
[02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:10.240]  keep their options open in case the value of the US dollar ever collapses.
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:17.780]  So they're considering minting state coinage. A bill passed in their house in Virginia to
[02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:26.140]  create a committee to see if they will honor gold and silver as legal tender. So it's already
[02:11:26.140 --> 02:11:29.820]  passed the Virginia House. If it goes to the Virginia Senate and passes, a committee will
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:35.700]  be created to see if they could use gold and silver as a legal currency.
[02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:39.340]  And that's already being done in Utah. And of course they're trying to convince us that
[02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:44.500]  using gold and silver is a new form of terrorism and it's gonna undermine the economy. No,
[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:49.340]  it's been the Federal Reserve debasing the value of our money and using it as an insider
[02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:53.780]  trading weapon where they can give, again, these zero interest loans to the bankers on
[02:11:53.780 --> 02:11:58.780]  Wall Street, the big bankers, the Rothschild, Rockefeller factions, while the little people
[02:11:58.780 --> 02:12:06.940]  have to pay huge inflation, huge, I'm sorry, huge prices for their money.
[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:13.580]  If they get a credit card, it's upwards of 20, 30% in many cases. But whereas many local
[02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:18.460]  cities do issue their own currency, they have coupon systems and it's revitalized a lot
[02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:22.820]  of failing cities across the country, even in the modern day. So why not look at those
[02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:27.420]  kind of systems? I think it's encouraging that states like Virginia are looking at that.
[02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:30.940]  Yeah, absolutely. I think at last count, it was about 20 communities throughout the United
[02:12:30.940 --> 02:12:36.580]  States had their own currency. And it really helps the unemployed, low income people because
[02:12:36.580 --> 02:12:42.460]  now their currency has value. So it's good to see that Virginia is doing this. Last year,
[02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:49.100]  13 states reviewed this issue. Utah has passed a bill, as I stated earlier, to honor gold
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:50.100]  and silver.
[02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:52.380]  People are using it, so we wish the state of Virginia well.
[02:12:52.380 --> 02:12:56.860]  Look, economic viability is one of our inherent rights. We have a right to our own lives and
[02:12:56.860 --> 02:13:01.220]  to try to prosper. I mean, that's basic to the Declaration of Independence of the Constitution,
[02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:06.420]  life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. And they want us to be economic slaves to this
[02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:12.900]  system to be told what to do out of Washington and on Wall Street, and it's just so backwards.
[02:13:12.900 --> 02:13:14.780]  I mean, you see what I'm saying?
[02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:18.300]  Yeah, absolutely. Like we stated earlier about Rand Paul's audit the Fed bill that's being
[02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:23.820]  reintroduced. One of the reasons why the powers that be don't want that bill passed is because
[02:13:23.820 --> 02:13:29.740]  once a light is shined on the Federal Reserve, it will send international markets into a
[02:13:29.740 --> 02:13:30.740]  frenzy.
[02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:34.860]  It's not so much because they wanna honor what the Federal Reserve does. They really
[02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:41.680]  wanna cover for the Federal Reserve. So it's good to see that states are taking action.
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:46.900]  Now in other important news in terms of victories, because the liberty movement is also experiencing
[02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:52.340]  a lot of victories. In Washington State, they're preparing to take on the TSA. There's an article
[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:58.820]  posted on infowars.com where Representative Jason Overstreet is introducing a bill called
[02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:06.820]  HB 1454. And it basically says that if the TSA abuses their power, if they take a child
[02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:12.740]  away from a parent without the parent's consent, and they frisk the child and the parent doesn't
[02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:16.740]  like that, they're gonna rule it a class C felony.
[02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:20.500]  Now I don't know what a class C felony is, but clearly there's gonna be a penalty for
[02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:21.500]  it.
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:25.460]  Well, even a class B or class A misdemeanor could be some pretty serious jail time.
[02:14:25.460 --> 02:14:29.980]  Yeah, absolutely. So it's good to see that the state of Washington is really repudiating
[02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:36.900]  the TSA and they're introducing a bill as well to really put the TSA on their toes.
[02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:42.620]  But again, we've been conditioned since 9-11 and the war on terror to just accept these
[02:14:42.620 --> 02:14:47.060]  top down controls when they're abusive and make no sense. But they wanna engage us in
[02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:50.820]  a semantical debate. It's like I was talking with David Knight earlier about the drone
[02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:56.020]  situation and about torture. They wanna argue over the definition of waterboarding versus
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:57.020]  torture.
[02:14:57.020 --> 02:15:01.940]  I mean, the stuff they do at a TSA checkpoint is a form of harassment and torture. I mean,
[02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:07.020]  why do they have to touch people's genitals into pants, harass old people and children
[02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:12.700]  especially? Notice they're the most vulnerable sectors of society on either end of the spectrum.
[02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:17.180]  Why do we have to be stopped and frisked and checked just to travel when we have a right
[02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:22.940]  to travel? And again and again, anytime there is an incident of terrorism, it just links
[02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:28.060]  back to the shadow government and to those in Washington who have an agenda for controlling
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:29.060]  us.
[02:15:29.060 --> 02:15:33.980]  Absolutely, these agencies just continue to grow and grow. The TSA is about $8 billion
[02:15:33.980 --> 02:15:38.980]  a year agency. They have not caught one terrorist. It's not a good return on investment.
[02:15:38.980 --> 02:15:40.500]  That's right, tell them again.
[02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:45.100]  $8 billion a year, the TSA agency, that's how much it costs the taxpayers and they haven't
[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:47.260]  caught one terrorist. It's not a very-
[02:15:47.260 --> 02:15:51.060]  But you get a lot of lip from people in a uniform who think it makes them important.
[02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:56.140]  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. But it's good to see that people are wising up to this.
[02:15:56.140 --> 02:16:00.900]  But I've only, since I've been here at Infowars, started to re-recognize states' rights and
[02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:05.580]  the importance of the 10th Amendment. But we've had a great awakening over several issues
[02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:10.460]  just in the last year or two, thanks to people like Drudge Report covering the TSA issue.
[02:16:10.460 --> 02:16:15.420]  Thanks to states like Texas overwhelmingly, unanimously passing the House that they wanted
[02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:20.820]  to try to throw out the TSA. But then again, we're told by the feds, you can't do that.
[02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:25.140]  We'll tell you what to do. We're the parent, we're the child. Obama is our daddy. Did you
[02:16:25.140 --> 02:16:26.460]  see that clip yesterday?
[02:16:26.460 --> 02:16:30.580]  Yeah, when I thought about that, I just thought we should all just close our eyes and envision
[02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:33.300]  Obama picking us up and spinning us in a circle.
[02:16:33.300 --> 02:16:38.340]  Oh, he could hug us like little children like Joseph Stalin or Fidel Castro or all the other
[02:16:38.340 --> 02:16:43.900]  dictators around the world who pose for these poster images. Hitler went to many photo ops
[02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:44.900]  with children.
[02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:50.100]  Yeah, it's not very loving. The NDAA is not very loving. Drone attacks are not very loving.
[02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:56.620]  A top-down approach is not very loving. But just speaking of Obama and the federal government,
[02:16:56.620 --> 02:17:01.020]  I was making this point earlier with another reporter that the economy, any revitalization
[02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:04.220]  that is taking place in the economy, Obama's getting credit for.
[02:17:04.220 --> 02:17:10.020]  But in reality, it's because states are nullifying a lot of what he does. They're nullifying
[02:17:10.020 --> 02:17:16.100]  right to work. They're nullifying Obamacare. So he's actually getting credit for some of
[02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:20.740]  the improvements in the economy when, in fact, it's the states taking the matters into their
[02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:25.100]  own hand, abolishing state income taxes, things of that nature.
[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:29.540]  And here you got Obama posing as the hero when, in fact, the states should be commended
[02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:32.700]  for the revitalization of the economy, the little revitalization.
[02:17:32.700 --> 02:17:37.700]  Look at the biggest spike in sales of the whole year. It's in guns. That's because Obama's
[02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:42.780]  been trying to attack and rescind Second Amendment rights. It's because states have stood up
[02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:48.020]  and introduced Firearms Protections Act, because sheriffs have stood up and said no, and because
[02:17:48.020 --> 02:17:53.020]  the people have stood up and said, we see the value in self-defense and arming ourselves
[02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:56.260]  and having you not tell us what to do and control our lives.
[02:17:56.260 --> 02:18:02.180]  The TSA issue, again, $8 billion spent through federal tax money sucked out of the people.
[02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:07.020]  Not one terrorist caught. Lots of harassment of the people. But also it's been economically
[02:18:07.020 --> 02:18:13.140]  devastating. They admit tens of billions of dollars in travel money and hotel money and
[02:18:13.140 --> 02:18:17.500]  leisure spending is all drying up because people don't want to travel and put up with
[02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:18.500]  that harassment.
[02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:19.500]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:26.580]  They've had major industry reps meet with the TSA, Pistole and Napolitano, Chertoff,
[02:18:26.580 --> 02:18:31.420]  you name it, to say, can you please just back off? Can you please not now harass pilots
[02:18:31.420 --> 02:18:36.260]  after harassing regular passengers? Because we want people to travel. We're in bed with
[02:18:36.260 --> 02:18:40.980]  the travel industry. We've got Travelocity packages with flights and hotels and rental
[02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:41.980]  cars.
[02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:45.340]  We want people to keep doing that and to have vacation time and money to spend. Can you
[02:18:45.340 --> 02:18:49.500]  stop harassing people and destroying a large sector of the economy?
[02:18:49.500 --> 02:18:54.260]  Absolutely, and some airports, from what I understand now, do have the option to opt
[02:18:54.260 --> 02:18:58.980]  out and to have their own private security force. Sacramento just backed out. I don't
[02:18:58.980 --> 02:18:59.980]  know why.
[02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:00.980]  They did that in Orlando, right?
[02:19:00.980 --> 02:19:01.980]  Right.
[02:19:01.980 --> 02:19:03.940]  And again, major tourist town, Disneyland's there.
[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:07.860]  Right, but what they don't say is that even if you get your own private security force
[02:19:07.860 --> 02:19:15.700]  to do security at airports, the TSA still oversees them, you know? So yeah, it's good
[02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:22.340]  to see that states are taking the initiative, but yeah, the TSA is absolutely growing out
[02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:23.540]  of control.
[02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:27.660]  And speaking of states' rights, because we were talking about states' rights earlier,
[02:19:27.660 --> 02:19:33.460]  it seems that the gun issue, many states are nullifying the assault weapons ban. But sadly,
[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:38.920]  Maryland is, they look like they're gonna pass an assault weapons ban. So the victory
[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:40.460]  is really on the state level.
[02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:44.100]  Well, that's why we have to be vigilant. We'll get more into this discussion on the other
[02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:49.260]  side. Other reporters, Melissa Melton coming up, InfoWars Nightly News tonight. Stay tuned,

[02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:45.140]  battle between the forces of freedom and darkness. You are the response to the globalist technocrats
[02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:52.780]  and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination. The war is here.
[02:20:52.780 --> 02:21:04.660]  It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984. You land in Buenos Aires,
[02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:10.380]  then a shuttle to Santa Rosa where a nicely furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi,

[02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:24.980]  begins. You're on a golden stag safari for big game. But it's not Africa. It's Argentina.
[02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:31.260]  One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, huger, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest

[02:22:00.700 --> 02:22:04.580]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors. Are we going to see economic
[02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:09.900]  growth, slide into recession, or at worst, depression? Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:14.160]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:18.660]  is prudent. When the market becomes volatile, U.S. treasuries are a safe haven. But what
[02:22:18.660 --> 02:22:23.840]  do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means? Many investors
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:28.620]  are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:22:28.620 --> 02:22:33.140]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing
[02:22:33.140 --> 02:22:38.200]  costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights and measures. The book

[02:22:45.860 --> 02:22:53.220]  year history. Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.

[02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:26.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've been talking about, of course, rights-based issues, TSA
[02:24:26.740 --> 02:24:31.500]  in the Fourth Amendment, guns in the Second Amendment, how they want an assault weapon
[02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:36.700]  ban. But it's also, as we discussed in the last segment, economic in every instance.
[02:24:36.700 --> 02:24:40.940]  Again, you look at the pattern of history repeating itself. Look back to the American
[02:24:40.940 --> 02:24:45.580]  Revolution. They talked about how they were eating out their substance. They had to fight
[02:24:45.580 --> 02:24:50.500]  back against the British because of these long train of abuses. Their rights were directly
[02:24:50.500 --> 02:24:56.380]  connected with their ability to conduct themselves in a viable way economically, and that's what
[02:24:56.380 --> 02:24:59.020]  drove them in many respects to fight for that.
[02:24:59.020 --> 02:25:02.840]  There were other agendas at work as well. But David Ortiz, you've been highlighting
[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:06.700]  on a number of these issues. Now, we just mentioned at the last break there's an attempt
[02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:09.620]  at assault weapons ban in Maryland, but there's more.
[02:25:09.620 --> 02:25:14.140]  Yeah, absolutely. In Maryland and in Colorado, it turns out that they're really having a
[02:25:14.140 --> 02:25:21.020]  heated debate in Maryland. Governor O'Malley, a Democrat, he's proposing a bill which would
[02:25:21.020 --> 02:25:25.740]  add Maryland to the 11 states that require residents to apply for and receive a license
[02:25:25.740 --> 02:25:28.180]  before purchasing a handgun.
[02:25:28.180 --> 02:25:32.100]  Now, he's targeting assault weapons as well, which I'll talk about in a second. But do
[02:25:32.100 --> 02:25:37.220]  you see how this is incremental? The argument was assault weapons. And now they're saying
[02:25:37.220 --> 02:25:40.820]  in Maryland, they want a bill that says you're gonna need a license to get a handgun. It's
[02:25:40.820 --> 02:25:41.820]  all incremental.
[02:25:41.820 --> 02:25:47.980]  Well, they take one tragedy they could seize upon. One gun, the AR-15, they can exploit
[02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:52.700]  and play up, even though it's admitted the Sandy Hook shooter never used an AR-15. He
[02:25:52.700 --> 02:25:57.300]  supposedly had one in his car, who knows if it was planted there. And yet they wanna demonize
[02:25:57.300 --> 02:25:58.460]  all guns.
[02:25:58.460 --> 02:26:02.980]  And you were talking about how they wanna hold gun manufacturers legally responsible
[02:26:02.980 --> 02:26:08.220]  for any damage done. Well, look at those hypocrites who conducted Fast and Furious. Will Eric
[02:26:08.220 --> 02:26:13.220]  Holder have to hold out a personal bond for the tens of thousands killed by drug cartels
[02:26:13.220 --> 02:26:19.340]  armed by our own government, encouraged by the CIA to carry out a black ops war against
[02:26:19.340 --> 02:26:20.340]  the people?
[02:26:20.340 --> 02:26:25.240]  Will he be held liable for the damage to Border Patrol agent Brian Terry and the dozens of
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:29.900]  others who have been killed, the Mexican beauty queen, the upset to the economy in Mexico
[02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:32.460]  and in the United States?
[02:26:32.460 --> 02:26:35.300]  Absolutely not. I mean, how it works is when a government official kills someone, it's
[02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:39.380]  collateral damage. When the American people kill someone, they need to be controlled,
[02:26:39.380 --> 02:26:40.380]  they're bad.
[02:26:40.380 --> 02:26:41.380]  Well, that makes a lot of sense, yeah.
[02:26:41.380 --> 02:26:45.580]  Yeah, so no, yeah, Fast and Furious, it just goes on and on. All those children that were
[02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:49.300]  killed at a party in Mexico as a result of Fast and Furious.
[02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:53.620]  Oh, but those children don't count because we're supposed to talk about the Sandy Hook
[02:26:53.620 --> 02:26:54.620]  children.
[02:26:54.620 --> 02:26:58.340]  Yeah, absolutely, Obama won't shed a tear for those Mexican children. So yeah, when
[02:26:58.340 --> 02:27:03.020]  a government official kills someone, it's collateral damage. We shouldn't pay attention
[02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:06.620]  to that. But in terms of Colorado, you were talking about Colorado. Let me talk about
[02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:07.620]  Maryland real quick.
[02:27:07.620 --> 02:27:13.060]  Aside from purchasing a handgun and needing a license in the Maryland bill, his legislation
[02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:19.880]  in Maryland would also limit the magazine capacity from 20 to 10 rounds. And you need
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:27.820]  to pay $100 fee as well. And Maryland Republicans have compared the bill's $100 fee and heightened
[02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:33.260]  training requirements to poll taxes imposed in many southern states during the Jim Crow
[02:27:33.260 --> 02:27:39.220]  era, which were often designed to discourage participation by poor black citizens.
[02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:44.220]  So more registration and also if you're poor, you gotta fork over $100 as well.
[02:27:44.220 --> 02:27:48.900]  And they tried this under the original gun control in the United States in the 30s. That
[02:27:48.900 --> 02:27:52.540]  original gun control, they tried to make people pay registration fees, it was hundreds of
[02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:57.140]  dollars. And that was taken to the Supreme Court, a lot of it was struck back. But parts
[02:27:57.140 --> 02:28:02.260]  of it that weren't rescinded were based on that somehow they have the right to just tax
[02:28:02.260 --> 02:28:04.560]  us even against our own rights.
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:07.500]  We see the same thing with Obamacare as well, just by the way.
[02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:11.900]  Yeah, and this works. These restrictions work. They sound reasonable, but very few people
[02:28:11.900 --> 02:28:17.380]  in New Jersey have a gun now. Very few people conceal carry because they gotta pay a fee,
[02:28:17.380 --> 02:28:21.660]  they gotta go through so much training. So this stuff actually works. So it does infringe
[02:28:21.660 --> 02:28:23.080]  upon our Second Amendment rights.
[02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:26.980]  It works at disarming victims and letting criminals run wild.
[02:28:26.980 --> 02:28:30.820]  And while Dianne Feinstein, she carries a concealed carry. And you were also mentioning
[02:28:30.820 --> 02:28:34.480]  earlier Colorado, what they're gonna do in Colorado is if they can't pass an assault
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:40.260]  weapons ban straight out, they're going to circumvent. And Colorado bill would hold gun
[02:28:40.260 --> 02:28:43.780]  makers and sellers accountable for weapon violence.
[02:28:43.780 --> 02:28:49.380]  If the bill becomes law, owners of semi-automatic rifles would face strict liability for civil
[02:28:49.380 --> 02:28:54.860]  damages caused by their types of weapons. While state statues that safeguard manufacturers
[02:28:54.860 --> 02:29:00.020]  and dealers from such liability would be abolished. So basically, if you're a manufacturer and
[02:29:00.020 --> 02:29:04.940]  someone has your gun and there's a massacre, you're gonna have to get liability insurance.
[02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:08.740]  And none of this happens in a vacuum. We've seen these liberal journalists in various
[02:29:08.740 --> 02:29:13.860]  magazines. I don't wanna misquote the magazine, I have one in mind. But they wrote about how
[02:29:13.860 --> 02:29:17.580]  you should have a license to get a gun, how you should have to take out personal insurance
[02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:22.860]  if you're gonna own a weapon. And they say, well, we should rewrite the Constitution.
[02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:28.600]  We should rewrite the second amendment. We should say, you do have a right to a weapon
[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:33.260]  unless Congress or the President decides otherwise. That's not a right, that is tyranny, that's
[02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:38.740]  arbitrary power. And it's turning our rights into a privilege. Thank you, David Ortiz.

[02:33:01.300 --> 02:33:05.260]  You heard it here. I'm on television so everybody knows it. I believe in the Second Amendment.
[02:33:05.260 --> 02:33:11.820]  I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms. We're gonna find the people who are
[02:33:11.820 --> 02:33:16.780]  doing this, take them out and shoot them. No, you take them out. They are traitors in
[02:33:16.780 --> 02:33:22.060]  this country and shoot them. Shoot them dead. I'll pay for the bullet. Challenge Alex Jones
[02:33:22.060 --> 02:33:27.460]  to a boxing match. Show up with a semi automatic that you got legally and pop them. I'd love
[02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:41.380]  to see that. In uniform. I will not take your shotgun away. I will not take your rifle away.
[02:33:41.380 --> 02:33:58.580]  I will not take your handgun away. Mr and Mrs America, turn them all in.
[02:33:58.580 --> 02:34:03.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the info war. We must awaken our minds, educate ourselves
[02:34:03.340 --> 02:34:08.820]  and again take back our lives. We were touching on so many topics earlier with David Ortiz,
[02:34:08.820 --> 02:34:12.700]  but I mentioned how they're eating out our substance. They really are. Now on the backs
[02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:18.380]  of all the stuff we've heard about genetically modified foods, it's linkage to organ damage,
[02:34:18.380 --> 02:34:24.740]  tumors, cancer, and especially digestive issues. We have the story up at info wars.com safety
[02:34:24.740 --> 02:34:31.260]  group blows lid on secret virus hidden in GMO crops. And it just is further evidence
[02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:37.560]  that this stuff is inducing gene mutations and really just wrecking all species up and
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:38.960]  down the food chain.
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:44.700]  At the same time, we have this news out of the new American, the GMO giant Monsanto joins
[02:34:44.700 --> 02:34:51.400]  big business coalition for United nations 21. Well, of course, agenda 21 was always
[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:57.260]  about using so-called seed technology to feed a hungry world. When at the same time, it's
[02:34:57.260 --> 02:35:01.760]  really about centralized control and eating out your substance. Look at what they did
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:06.780]  in Iraq. It wasn't just a war against the people. It wasn't just a war for territory.
[02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:12.180]  Remember the 100 orders from Iraq that Paul Bremer, not to be confused with John Brennan
[02:35:12.180 --> 02:35:15.560]  introduced, one of them had to do with GMO seeds.
[02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:21.340]  They took over all the seeds and mandated that only Monsanto and other biotech seeds
[02:35:21.340 --> 02:35:27.700]  could be planted. But after a year or more of pushing for Prop 37, people demanding to
[02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:32.660]  know what's in their food so they can avoid GMOs, pushing for labeling laws, they are
[02:35:32.660 --> 02:35:38.300]  moving with this false solution. You've got the big agra industry and the GMO industry
[02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:44.620]  now pushing for their own federal compromise on GMO labeling that they say could trump
[02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:46.500]  state law forever.
[02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:51.760]  You've got representatives of Walmart, General Mills, Pepsi, Frito Lay, Mars, Coca Cola,
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:59.100]  and others meeting with the FDA on January 11th for mandatory federal GMO labeling. And
[02:35:59.100 --> 02:36:04.340]  they say this is the concept of preemption. They want to preempt what states and local
[02:36:04.340 --> 02:36:09.860]  areas can do so that they can create their own loopholes, continue to do business as
[02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:14.380]  they like to operate while giving the public some assurance that something's being done
[02:36:14.380 --> 02:36:19.020]  about these very dangerous, very devastating GMO technologies.
[02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:22.780]  Now I'm gonna shift gears completely into another subject. We're joined by our reporter
[02:36:22.780 --> 02:36:28.420]  Melissa Melton. She did this special report on the Super Bowl and the Illuminati messages
[02:36:28.420 --> 02:36:33.820]  displayed during that weird pinnacle halftime ritual show. Let's go to that piece right
[02:36:33.820 --> 02:36:44.500]  now.
[02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:49.260]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for Info Wars Nightly News. The day after the Super Bowl,
[02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:54.900]  the top story on yahoo.com was did Beyonce flash an Illuminati sign? Next to a picture
[02:36:54.900 --> 02:37:00.100]  of Beyonce making a pyramid hand symbol, the article goes on to say, according to legend,
[02:37:00.100 --> 02:37:04.460]  the Illuminati are a tiny super secret cabal of influential individuals who have shaped
[02:37:04.460 --> 02:37:09.020]  the course of world events. So it makes perfect sense that Beyonce would flash their triangle
[02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:13.660]  sign to one of the largest viewing audiences in human history. What better way to preserve
[02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:19.340]  a secret? That's a definite possibility. Founded by Bavarian professor of law Adam Weishaupt
[02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:25.860]  in 1776, the Illuminati is considered the most notorious secret society, a sect bent
[02:37:25.860 --> 02:37:31.260]  on manipulating reality and dominating through a world government. These so called illuminated
[02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:36.740]  ones have been referred to by some as Satan's elite, whom they worship. Their symbol is
[02:37:36.740 --> 02:37:41.860]  a pyramid to illustrate the idea of a top down societal control system. And the pyramid
[02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:47.300]  features an all seeing eye or the eye of Lucifer. Info Wars has reported extensively on the
[02:37:47.300 --> 02:37:52.980]  history of the Illuminati, their birthplace, their prevalence in popular culture, music,
[02:37:52.980 --> 02:37:58.220]  movies, and their intent to dominate the world. While the articles language seems to sarcastically
[02:37:58.220 --> 02:38:03.260]  play off Beyonce's hand gestures, no big deal. This isn't the first time we've seen questionable
[02:38:03.260 --> 02:38:08.980]  symbolism at the Super Bowl. Look at these screenshots we've got from last night's Super
[02:38:08.980 --> 02:38:14.700]  Bowl performance by Madonna. And then you can also Google image search for yourself
[02:38:14.700 --> 02:38:22.180]  and type in Baphomet. And of course, we see that Madonna is dressed up as Baphomet. She's
[02:38:22.180 --> 02:38:27.900]  sitting on the throne of Baphomet. She's got the horns. Later on, she's got the hand gestures
[02:38:27.900 --> 02:38:32.820]  of Baphomet. And this is the idol that the American people during Super Bowl halftime
[02:38:32.820 --> 02:38:41.140]  show are being told to worship. So who's Baphomet? Baphomet is an idol used by Satanists to represent
[02:38:41.140 --> 02:38:46.540]  the devil. This also isn't the first time we've seen questionable symbolism from Beyonce.
[02:38:46.540 --> 02:38:52.060]  The pagan deity Baphomet, a figure revived in the 19th century as an idol for Satan worship,
[02:38:52.060 --> 02:38:56.940]  has been prominently featured in her videos and album artwork. And she even wears a Baphomet
[02:38:56.940 --> 02:39:03.220]  ring. And Beyonce isn't the only music star by far who's been called out for having hidden
[02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:08.660]  symbolism in her videos. The Yahoo article claims that Beyonce is merely supporting her
[02:39:08.660 --> 02:39:13.820]  husband's record label. But if this symbol is a diamond and not a pyramid, why are he,
[02:39:13.820 --> 02:39:18.860]  Beyonce and other stars seen looking through it with one eye? In addition, let's analyze
[02:39:18.860 --> 02:39:24.180]  this shirt sold under Jay Z's clothing label. It again depicts the pyramid hand symbol with
[02:39:24.180 --> 02:39:29.620]  the all seeing eye atop it, and 13 rays of light coming out of the sides, encircled by
[02:39:29.620 --> 02:39:34.780]  a serpent and other smaller symbols with the tagline Masters of the Craft at the bottom.
[02:39:34.780 --> 02:39:40.140]  Jay Z has also had some interesting critiques of hidden messages in his music as well.
[02:39:40.140 --> 02:39:48.020]  Jay Z, H to the Izzo, V to the Izzi, J, Hova, God, that's what he calls himself. We just
[02:39:48.020 --> 02:39:56.860]  happen to come across a very disturbing song by brother Jay Z and has a backwards message
[02:39:56.860 --> 02:40:10.140]  in it and we had to reverse the song and play the song backwards. And the rapper has gone
[02:40:10.140 --> 02:40:14.700]  on record wondering why people have linked him to devil worship and the Illuminati. When
[02:40:14.700 --> 02:40:19.020]  asked by radio personality, Angie Martinez, if these rumors of deliberately adding images
[02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:24.180]  to his videos were true, Jay Z responded, no, never done that before. Why would I do
[02:40:24.180 --> 02:40:28.780]  that? That's retarded. But here's a clip of another interview where Jay Z actually admits
[02:40:28.780 --> 02:40:35.460]  he hides messages in his music. And then I start doing, you know, these different, you
[02:40:35.460 --> 02:40:42.420]  know, hidden messages in the music, you know, just as a, that replaced, you know, the technical
[02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:48.140]  aspect of it. And then it's just, you know, evolved from there. The Super Bowl aside,
[02:40:48.140 --> 02:40:53.420]  we've seen other curious eye symbolism at major events. At the one year anniversary
[02:40:53.420 --> 02:40:59.980]  of 9-11 the band marched out onto ground zero in what appeared to be an all seeing eye formation.
[02:40:59.980 --> 02:41:05.260]  Are all of these mere coincidences? Many people ask if the Illuminati is such a super secret
[02:41:05.260 --> 02:41:10.300]  cabal and they're so devious, why are they openly hiding their symbols in plain sight?
[02:41:10.300 --> 02:41:16.060]  In his book, Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare, Michael Hoffman II calls this revelation
[02:41:16.060 --> 02:41:21.680]  of the method or advertising one's power openly to amplify it, gloating and flaunting the
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:27.700]  idea that resistance is futile before an unsuspecting public. Are all of these established Illuminati
[02:41:27.700 --> 02:41:33.740]  symbols supposed to acclimate people subconsciously to a darker agenda? Or are we really supposed
[02:41:33.740 --> 02:41:37.620]  to believe that all seeing eyes and pyramids and Bophomet costumes are going to be the
[02:41:37.620 --> 02:41:42.500]  new theme for the Super Bowl every year? And what is the average person supposed to think
[02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:47.260]  about this continuous symbolism inundation? Or is the truth that they're not supposed
[02:41:47.260 --> 02:41:52.080]  to think at all, but just go along with their regularly scheduled programming? I mean, how
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:56.860]  many coincidences can you have before it's not a coincidence anymore? These are overt
[02:41:56.860 --> 02:42:02.180]  messages of elite domination by a covert group parading a pageant of mass conditioning before
[02:42:02.180 --> 02:42:07.340]  the public in a culture dominated by television at a sporting event watched by millions every
[02:42:07.340 --> 02:42:13.700]  year and many do not even realize what's happening. If it doesn't mean anything, why is it there?
[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:18.020]  For Infowars Nightly News, I'm Melissa Melton.
[02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:23.080]  And so again, that's a recap of yet again, the strange occurrence is happening at the
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:29.260]  halftime show at the Super Bowl. Madonna did her strange ritual last year, Beyonce blinged
[02:42:29.260 --> 02:42:33.980]  all these messages. And really, there should be no denial. They're clearly demonstrating
[02:42:33.980 --> 02:42:39.900]  Illuminati, Masonic, other occultic symbols. But the point is why? Why would they do it
[02:42:39.900 --> 02:42:45.100]  if the public doesn't know what's going on? Well, they rule the public by demonstrating
[02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:51.140]  their dominance over them by putting suggestive subliminal messages into our daily lives.
[02:42:51.140 --> 02:42:55.300]  Is it really going on? Well, ask yourself politically how we came to work against our
[02:42:55.300 --> 02:43:00.540]  own interests to turn over the power of our own lives to these politicians who give us
[02:43:00.540 --> 02:43:07.440]  phony pretext, 9-11, the war on terror, phony WMD exploits to take over our constitutional
[02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:12.580]  bounds and run over us. Meanwhile, we've submitted to this consumer culture. We've learned to
[02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:15.860]  believe in and buy in these celebrities.
[02:43:15.860 --> 02:43:20.060]  We watch these commercials where we relate to the little short messages they give us.
[02:43:20.060 --> 02:43:26.260]  And why not demonstrate some of the hardcore control symbols that they put into us? People
[02:43:26.260 --> 02:43:30.660]  don't know how to read anymore. You've got to remember, literacy has been an ongoing
[02:43:30.660 --> 02:43:36.380]  tens of thousands of years struggles. In old times, it was only kings and priests class
[02:43:36.380 --> 02:43:41.900]  who could read at all or afford books because they had to be transcribed by hand.
[02:43:41.900 --> 02:43:47.660]  The rise of the printing press changed that to a large extent and many revolutionary tendencies
[02:43:47.660 --> 02:43:52.100]  were built on that principle. The whole age of enlightenment, the American Revolution
[02:43:52.100 --> 02:43:57.380]  was on the backs of the printing press and people learning to read. You've got the regular
[02:43:57.380 --> 02:44:02.280]  text, that's the words, the things as you see them. But there's also subtext, the things
[02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:07.060]  between the lines, the things they're not saying. And there's also the context, what
[02:44:07.060 --> 02:44:10.700]  is surrounding it, what other events are happening at the time.
[02:44:10.700 --> 02:44:16.020]  That's the kind of analyzation we need to use. My literature teacher was actually pretty
[02:44:16.020 --> 02:44:20.860]  good in public schools, taught us how to read between the lines and see what authors and
[02:44:20.860 --> 02:44:25.980]  other things were really meaning. We analyzed 1984 and it's really played a big role in
[02:44:25.980 --> 02:44:30.540]  my awakening and one of the reasons I'm here. And so with that in mind, let's look at the
[02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:35.340]  Super Bowl. Melissa Melton, you joined us, you analyzed these things, why they display
[02:44:35.340 --> 02:44:40.180]  these ritualistic like symbols during the Super Bowl, during this mass event where everyone
[02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:44.140]  tunes into television, everyone watches this one performance.
[02:44:44.140 --> 02:44:48.580]  Yeah, I mean, a lot of people have come out since I did this report and they've actually
[02:44:48.580 --> 02:44:53.780]  said that if it's just Jay-Z's record label, that's just a symbol for his record label
[02:44:53.780 --> 02:44:58.000]  and we're making a big deal out of nothing. However, why would you pick something that's
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:02.060]  been historically linked to devil worship and the Illuminati, it's been around for a
[02:45:02.060 --> 02:45:05.900]  very long time. That's like if I went and got a record label and I decided to make the
[02:45:05.900 --> 02:45:10.500]  swastika my symbol and then got offended when people linked it to Nazis, no?
[02:45:10.500 --> 02:45:13.740]  And I said, well, that's just a weird X. I don't know why you're thinking that about
[02:45:13.740 --> 02:45:18.540]  me. I mean, it's ridiculous. And actually, in analyzing it even further, we found the
[02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:23.100]  Pepsi commercial that they showed beforehand, a little intro into the Super Bowl, had some
[02:45:23.100 --> 02:45:24.100]  subliminal messages.
[02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:28.220]  I didn't see it, but tell us what's in it. We got a clip, actually, we're gonna play
[02:45:28.220 --> 02:45:31.580]  a clip. Do we have that, guys?
[02:45:31.580 --> 02:45:35.540]  Right here, this was shown for maybe half a second.
[02:45:35.540 --> 02:45:40.220]  And again, prisonplanet.tv viewers can see what's going on, but they're showing the Pepsi
[02:45:40.220 --> 02:45:44.100]  can, they're flashing through hundreds of people, they're showing sneakers. It's all
[02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:47.260]  very fast motion and there's devil horns just in there.
[02:45:47.260 --> 02:45:48.580]  There's a girl holding a devil horn sticking her tongue out.
[02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:52.500]  Just for a second, half a second. Right, and then the very next image after that is an
[02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:58.860]  eyeball. Just gigantic eyeball right there, all seeing eye right there. I mean, why would
[02:45:58.860 --> 02:45:59.860]  they have that?
[02:45:59.860 --> 02:46:03.260]  Why do they need to have a girl flashing devil horns hidden in there, basically? I mean,
[02:46:03.260 --> 02:46:06.380]  you have to really slow it down to even notice that it's there.
[02:46:06.380 --> 02:46:12.260]  Well, you've got a whole history of masonry, of the Illuminati, in relation to the power
[02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:18.220]  structure. People who want power or at the pinnacle of power are brought into these societies.
[02:46:18.220 --> 02:46:22.900]  That's how they are given higher office. And then you've got the whole celebrity culture,
[02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:27.700]  Hollywood, who's learned to read these messages, learn that they're supposed to interject them
[02:46:27.700 --> 02:46:33.180]  in for the masses, again, without the masses necessarily understanding what they're seeing.
[02:46:33.180 --> 02:46:38.420]  But they convey, especially the pyramid with the all seeing eye, they convey top down control
[02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:40.820]  that the masses are supposed to submit.
[02:46:40.820 --> 02:46:45.480]  And does it have an effect? Well, we see it every day in music videos and commercials.
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:51.660]  It's just that the Super Bowl is extra on display because it's a primary moment. 104
[02:46:51.660 --> 02:46:52.660]  million viewers.
[02:46:52.660 --> 02:46:56.660]  104, they're saying, watched Beyonce's. 112, Madonna's. Million people.
[02:46:56.660 --> 02:47:00.820]  Yeah, Madonna. Okay, so I made the case on the Nightly News the other night, after they
[02:47:00.820 --> 02:47:06.780]  aired your report, that it was the secret symbolism, hidden messages for top down control.
[02:47:06.780 --> 02:47:11.220]  But could it really be considered a ritual? Is there really something satanic or hidden
[02:47:11.220 --> 02:47:12.220]  going on here?
[02:47:12.220 --> 02:47:16.740]  Well, let's hear what Madonna herself had to say about her Super Bowl performance last
[02:47:16.740 --> 02:47:17.740]  year.
[02:47:17.740 --> 02:47:18.740]  Are you nervous about doing the Super Bowl?
[02:47:18.740 --> 02:47:21.900]  Oh, my God. So I'm so nervous. You have no idea.
[02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:22.900]  Really?
[02:47:22.900 --> 02:47:23.900]  Yeah.
[02:47:23.900 --> 02:47:31.460]  I mean, first of all, it's the Super Bowl. I mean, the Super Bowl is kind of like the
[02:47:31.460 --> 02:47:37.540]  holy of holies in America, right? So like, here I am. I'm going to come into the half
[02:47:37.540 --> 02:47:44.100]  way between the church, the church experience, and I'm going to have to deliver a sermon.
[02:47:44.100 --> 02:47:47.500]  It's going to have to be very impactful.
[02:47:47.500 --> 02:47:51.200]  So there again, I might even play that clip one more time, just so we make sure the listeners
[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:57.420]  are analyzing the words she's using. She sacrilegiously says the Super Bowl is like a holy of holies,
[02:47:57.420 --> 02:48:01.980]  says it's like a church event, and that she's going to give the sermon. And then you look,
[02:48:01.980 --> 02:48:03.540]  this was before the Super Bowl.
[02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:08.540]  Look at what she did in her, quote, sermon at the Super Bowl. She displayed Baphomet.
[02:48:08.540 --> 02:48:13.180]  She did all these weird ritualistic things. Could it really be a ritual? Well, for her,
[02:48:13.180 --> 02:48:14.580]  it's a church. Let's play it one more time.
[02:48:14.580 --> 02:48:15.820]  Are you nervous about doing the Super Bowl?
[02:48:15.820 --> 02:48:18.940]  Oh, my God. So I'm so nervous. You have no idea.
[02:48:18.940 --> 02:48:19.940]  I am.
[02:48:19.940 --> 02:48:20.940]  Really?
[02:48:20.940 --> 02:48:28.920]  Yeah. I mean, first of all, it's the Super Bowl. I mean, the Super Bowl is kind of like
[02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:35.180]  the holy of holies in America, right? So like, here I am. I'm going to come into the halfway
[02:48:35.180 --> 02:48:41.660]  between like the church, the church experience, and I'm going to have to deliver a sermon.
[02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:43.800]  It's going to have to be very impactful.
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:45.380]  She's going to deliver a sermon.
[02:48:45.380 --> 02:48:47.260]  Her Baphomet ritual was a sermon.
[02:48:47.260 --> 02:48:52.700]  Exactly. And so if it doesn't matter, it doesn't necessarily matter if the people, believe
[02:48:52.700 --> 02:48:54.540]  it or not, she obviously does.
[02:48:54.540 --> 02:48:57.980]  And she's admittedly into Kabbalah and all kinds of other secret society stuff.
[02:48:57.980 --> 02:49:02.140]  A lot of these people in entertainment are, and she's been propped up for decades as a
[02:49:02.140 --> 02:49:07.620]  major cultural icon. Everybody loves or hates her, but they know who she is.
[02:49:07.620 --> 02:49:12.660]  Yeah. Well, and so you've got this being paraded around in front of people. And even this year,
[02:49:12.660 --> 02:49:16.500]  it was more subtle this year, but there were still a lot of symbolism and bizarre things
[02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:22.660]  throughout her Beyonce's performance. And then we also have a clip of people in the
[02:49:22.660 --> 02:49:29.820]  crowd mirroring her symbols back to her and making devil horns and making triangle pyramid
[02:49:29.820 --> 02:49:30.820]  things.
[02:49:30.820 --> 02:49:38.020]  And so it has an effect, obviously. Obviously it does. Obviously it's brainwashing people
[02:49:38.020 --> 02:49:40.700]  whether they realize it is or not.
[02:49:40.700 --> 02:49:45.020]  And whether these things are ultimately meaningful or not is yours to discover and decide, but
[02:49:45.020 --> 02:49:49.360]  it's in all the mass media we're watching every day. People, you really shouldn't be
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:54.400]  watching television more than maybe a couple minutes to catch maybe a major news story.
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:58.940]  It's not just entertainment, it is, quote, programming. And they really have changed
[02:49:58.940 --> 02:49:59.940]  our society with it.
[02:49:59.940 --> 02:50:05.560]  They've shown it contributes to declining sperm counts. It contributes to this people
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:11.220]  in an alpha state who lose touch with their regular consciousness, follow the leader,
[02:50:11.220 --> 02:50:16.900]  do what they're told and really aren't engaged in society. It's destructive in so many forms.
[02:50:16.900 --> 02:50:21.140]  And there's just so much of the symbolism going on. Your comments, take us out to break
[02:50:21.140 --> 02:50:23.620]  and we'll come back with a little bit more.
[02:50:23.620 --> 02:50:29.820]  Well, obviously, yahoo.com had that as their main top story for the day. Did Beyonce flash
[02:50:29.820 --> 02:50:35.700]  an Illuminati sign? And the reason is so many people came out and said that she did. Obviously
[02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:41.020]  they think it's an issue enough to make it the main top story for the day. So if it doesn't
[02:50:41.020 --> 02:50:42.620]  mean anything, why is it there?
[02:50:42.620 --> 02:50:47.380]  Yeah, it doesn't mean anything. It's just hundreds, if not thousands of years of these
[02:50:47.380 --> 02:50:54.840]  symbols being manifest always by top down societies, people who want control. You know,
[02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:59.660]  it's fascinating. Again, Madonna admitted for her it was a sermon satanic ritual. We'll
[02:50:59.660 --> 02:51:00.660]  be back.
[02:51:00.660 --> 02:51:05.540]  Attention, gardeners and patriots, drought conditions in our nation's heartland and massive

[02:52:59.380 --> 02:53:03.980]  Life's getting better. My name is Stephen Huir. After 22 years of nutritional counseling,
[02:53:03.980 --> 02:53:08.200]  I've observed that most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity
[02:53:08.200 --> 02:53:12.740]  and brain damage. So whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking or more
[02:53:12.740 --> 02:53:17.320]  serious matters like inability to focus, speak normally or remember things, the emphasis
[02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:21.740]  to getting one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification. One World Way
[02:53:21.740 --> 02:53:26.700]  supports your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production. My name
[02:53:26.700 --> 02:53:32.080]  is Angie and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation. I got him on One
[02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:37.240]  World Way and in two months his constipation is gone. He's become friendlier. He can carry
[02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:42.240]  on a normal conversation with me and he's made his first friend. He's doing great and
[02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:47.540]  he looks forward to taking One World Way every day. You could offer him a present or a cake
[02:53:47.540 --> 02:53:54.440]  and he would prefer the One World Way. Go to OneWorldWay.com. That's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com

[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:17.960]  This is the Emperor War. Our hour is coming to an end but the battle never ends. We must
[02:54:17.960 --> 02:54:23.200]  awaken our minds, understand what the fight is and take a position, dig in. Only with
[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:27.560]  that can we turn things around. That's how we affect our universe. Now the show is going
[02:54:27.560 --> 02:54:32.960]  to end. Go to rebroadcast in just a moment but tonight live Info Wars Nightly News with
[02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:37.360]  David Knight. We've been doing it live the past two nights just kind of as an experiment
[02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:42.240]  but it's very energizing, very exciting to do it that way. Anyway, we go back to Melissa
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:47.800]  Melton with more of the symbolism we saw on display on exhibit at the Super Bowl.
[02:54:47.800 --> 02:54:53.480]  Well, I mean, she's dancing around inside of a red circle that looks like an eye. She's
[02:54:53.480 --> 02:54:58.240]  dancing around in a ring of flames. She's flashing these pyramid symbols. I mean, nothing
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:02.600]  about that seems wholesome or good. I mean, and then you've got the lights going out.
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:05.580]  That was another issue that people brought up. I didn't have time to cover everything
[02:55:05.580 --> 02:55:09.280]  in a small special report but the lights did go out about 10 minutes after her performance
[02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:16.280]  I think it was and they stayed out for 33 minutes and some seconds. Say what you want
[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:22.200]  but 33 is the highest known degree of Freemasonry and we know it's on record that Adam Weishaupt
[02:55:22.200 --> 02:55:26.920]  who founded the Illuminati did infiltrate the Masons and so I actually have a quote
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:31.000]  here that I think is pretty interesting about that by writer Peter Farley.
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:35.320]  He says, masonry never works in the full light of day. Everyone knows of its existence, its
[02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:40.480]  meeting places and of many of its adepts but one is ignorant of its real aims, its real
[02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:44.440]  means, its real leaders. The immense majority of Masons themselves are in that position.
[02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:48.820]  They are only the blind machinery of the sect which they serve. Many honest Masons are so
[02:55:48.820 --> 02:55:52.800]  blind that they would be stupefied if they knew for what they are being used.
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:57.880]  Yeah, and so they talk about how masonry is not all bad. A lot of its membership are well
[02:55:57.880 --> 02:56:03.960]  meaning but again, it's a secret society with hierarchical ranking and just like the military
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:08.620]  or just like in the White House, it's on a need to know basis. So you've got a lot of
[02:56:08.620 --> 02:56:13.760]  people blindly in that system assuming it's doing good work, they do charity, etc. Not
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:15.320]  knowing what's really going on.
[02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:19.120]  And you mentioned Adam Weishaupt, I've read books on this. I went to the founding place
[02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:25.060]  of the Illuminati over in Germany. And Weishaupt took his Illuminati society, they infiltrated
[02:56:25.060 --> 02:56:30.460]  the ranks of masonry, took over many of the lodges and got their ranks instituted in there.
[02:56:30.460 --> 02:56:35.840]  And John Bowne was showing me behind the scenes, the old all seeing eye pyramid logo used to
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:42.560]  have the fairly innocent slogan De Favente Perennis, which translates to with God's favor.
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:50.880]  But over the years, but now it's Novus Scloro Ordom, New Order of the Ages. Excuse me, I
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:55.720]  said it wrong, Novus Ordo Scloro, New Order of the Ages, New World Order. And you see
[02:56:55.720 --> 02:56:59.080]  that with people like Francis Bacon and more.
[02:56:59.080 --> 02:57:02.080]  But let's get back to the Super Bowl and what kind of stuff they had on display.
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:07.080]  Well, actually, we just found this out too. There was actually an ad during the Super
[02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:12.640]  Bowl for Mercedes Benz, where Willem Dafoe actually plays the devil and a young man has
[02:57:12.640 --> 02:57:17.400]  made a deal, offered a deal with the devil where he can receive a new Mercedes Benz.
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:19.240]  You get a cool car, you just have to sell your soul.
[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:22.480]  You just have to sell your soul. And they actually have him signing a contract at the
[02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:28.280]  end. But it flashes to a ring that he's wearing, that Willem Dafoe is wearing that has a mason
[02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:30.680]  symbol on it, three mason symbols.
[02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:34.520]  And these commercials, I didn't see it, but these don't happen by accidents. They spend
[02:57:34.520 --> 02:57:39.240]  millions of dollars producing them and millions upon millions for that prime airtime when
[02:57:39.240 --> 02:57:40.240]  there's maximum viewers.
[02:57:40.240 --> 02:57:42.120]  It was $4 million for 30 seconds this year.
[02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:44.280]  Wow, more than ever so.
[02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:47.520]  Every single thing they put in one of these commercials is meaningful. If you're gonna
[02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:50.040]  spend $4 million on 30 seconds, every second-
[02:57:50.040 --> 02:57:51.600]  This isn't stuff slipping by.
[02:57:51.600 --> 02:57:56.560]  No, it's not an accident that this is in there, that we have. It says there's a satanic spirit
[02:57:56.560 --> 02:57:59.880]  in here. I'm looking at this breakdown. I mean, I just received this a minute ago. There's
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:05.200]  an all-seeing eye at the end, too. Once again, more eye symbolism. And actually, eye symbolism's
[02:58:05.200 --> 02:58:09.640]  been around in the Super Bowl halftime show even before Madonna. I have a clip in there
[02:58:09.640 --> 02:58:15.520]  of the Black Eyed Peas, an image of that. It's all these people raising their hands
[02:58:15.520 --> 02:58:18.440]  up in a circle, then an eye.
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:22.840]  It's creepy stuff. It's all on display. You know, blogs like Vigilant Citizen break down
[02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:27.640]  a lot of the behind the scenes, what these symbols mean. But you could do it for yourself
[02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:33.000]  just by learning to read text, subtext, and context. Tonight, Infowars Nightly News, live
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:38.200]  with David Knight, 7 p.m. Central, 8 p.m. Eastern. Tune in, spread the word, get people
[02:58:38.200 --> 02:59:00.160]  watching. Let's turn things around.
