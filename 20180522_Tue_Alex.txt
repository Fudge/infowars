[02:05.280 --> 02:13.800]  mole inside of the white house not just inside the campaign not just inside the
[02:13.800 --> 02:24.880]  president elects operation neil there is just so much to get to today that it
[02:24.880 --> 02:29.160]  makes my head spin and we're going to be presenting that information coming up

[02:39.440 --> 02:46.640]  michael caputo also saying that there were other moles but that he is not
[02:46.640 --> 02:51.400]  allowed to get into it because of his lawyers but we separately are going to
[02:51.400 --> 02:59.680]  name a mole that we know was feeding information to the media and to the
[02:59.680 --> 03:06.760]  clinton's and to george soros so that is coming up ladies and gentlemen in the

[03:17.640 --> 03:22.000]  going to begin patrolling taiwanese airspace that means chinese fighter jets
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.360]  are going to be flying over the military of taiwan and their defense forces
[03:26.360 --> 03:30.600]  basically in a prelude to physically taking it over this is unbelievable

[03:55.160 --> 03:58.560]  the governments are actually saying in court rulings they're allowed to do it
[03:58.560 --> 04:06.120]  and it gets even more insane they're telling women in europe don't go out at

[04:10.400 --> 04:16.160]  today also china celebrates their new social credit system that's the mark of

[06:39.000 --> 06:43.880]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting worldwide thank you so much
[06:43.880 --> 06:48.000]  for joining us we're going to be here for the next four hours live in the
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.440]  war room with Owen shroyer and Roger Stone is coming up we are in the thick of
[06:53.440 --> 07:00.600]  the battle against the globalist right now Michael Caputo former Trump campaign
[07:00.600 --> 07:05.880]  member who's been targeted by Mueller says that he's aware of other moles inside
[07:05.880 --> 07:12.560]  the campaign well we're aware and have outed previously moles inside the
[07:12.560 --> 07:16.440]  White House and got the information directly to the president and he removed
[07:16.440 --> 07:22.400]  them so we're going to reveal a major mole here right now but first I want to
[07:22.400 --> 07:26.600]  play a clip of Michael Caputo says another informant as they're called
[07:26.600 --> 07:31.920]  first oh we're never spying on you we're monitoring your digital transmissions
[07:31.920 --> 07:36.320]  not wiretapping that's an old term so technically we're not wiretapping we're
[07:36.320 --> 07:40.480]  just intercepting everything you do illegally oh we always said we didn't
[07:40.480 --> 07:46.560]  have moles inside the campaign we were we had informants for your own safety run
[07:46.560 --> 07:53.760]  by Hillary Clinton and run by Strach and run by McCabe and run by Mueller and all
[07:53.760 --> 07:57.480]  the rest these people who've all testified before Congress there was no
[07:57.480 --> 08:03.640]  surveillance and now they've been caught lying this is so sensational ladies and
[08:03.640 --> 08:07.680]  gentlemen it's so incredible that we are at this point and the media is
[08:07.680 --> 08:13.800]  desperately trying to cover it up desperately trying to not give it any
[08:13.800 --> 08:17.800]  coverage because they've all told you on late night comedy and on all the fake
[08:17.800 --> 08:23.120]  dinosaur media and all the fake news that there is no spying on the campaign
[08:23.120 --> 08:31.240]  because it dwarfs Watergate by magnitudes it's in its own class of
[08:31.240 --> 08:40.640]  industrial level behavior operation crossfire hurricane operation crossfire
[08:40.640 --> 08:50.480]  hurricane now the precious New York Times broke that last Friday they did
[08:50.480 --> 08:55.080]  not break it last Friday we broke it last year we broke it this year we broke
[08:55.080 --> 09:04.920]  it on Sunday stings Stefan Halperin we specifically fingered him we pointed the
[09:04.920 --> 09:09.240]  whole thing out and I only point that out because they're trying to shut us
[09:09.240 --> 09:14.520]  down because they know time and time again we're patient zero they see
[09:14.520 --> 09:18.720]  freedom as a disease they see liberty and free market and wealth and and
[09:18.720 --> 09:23.360]  religious freedom and family freedom and true classical liberalism as a
[09:23.360 --> 09:32.160]  threat and so they are doing everything they can to destroy him full wars and
[09:32.160 --> 09:38.360]  then all the rest of the free independent media so here is a breakdown of
[09:38.360 --> 09:42.840]  this by Michael Caputo then I'm going to give you another mole even more
[09:42.840 --> 09:48.240]  powerful even more dangerous even more out of control here is that clip Michael
[09:48.240 --> 09:53.280]  so you see a pattern here former Obama administration officials justifying
[09:53.280 --> 09:58.920]  spying on surveilling whatever you want to call it putting a mole in on a
[09:58.920 --> 10:04.760]  opposing campaign and a hotly contested election here final final thoughts I
[10:04.760 --> 10:12.840]  think you you've spent time in Russia Carter and I both have in Russia we're
[10:12.840 --> 10:16.960]  back live again ladies and gentlemen this is the Alex Jones show you just
[10:16.960 --> 10:23.320]  heard Michael Caputo break that down I was thinking about this this morning and
[10:23.320 --> 10:30.520]  it gave me a headache because there are so many known FBI Democratic Party
[10:30.520 --> 10:39.440]  George Soros Foundation Defense Intelligence CIA globalist operatives
[10:39.440 --> 10:44.360]  who were openly surveilling Trump when he was a candidate when he was the
[10:44.360 --> 10:50.080]  nominee when he was the president-elect and even once he was president
[10:50.520 --> 10:59.160]  clapper Brennan rice powers Obama they're all on record to the Atlantic
[10:59.160 --> 11:02.840]  Monthly and the New Yorker magazine and the New York Times and all the
[11:02.840 --> 11:10.720]  establishment publications after Trump won started on November 9th I read the
[11:10.720 --> 11:13.320]  news every day I look at hundreds of news articles I look at hundreds of
[11:13.320 --> 11:18.520]  video clips and I saw them going don't worry intelligence communities got seven
[11:18.520 --> 11:24.040]  ways to Sunday to bring him down and get back at him and don't worry we had him
[11:24.040 --> 11:28.560]  surveilled we had him wiretapped we had him watched we had electronic
[11:28.560 --> 11:32.880]  intercepts and boy let me tell you he is in bed with the Russians and he's
[11:32.880 --> 11:37.960]  going down so government hold on don't do what Trump says he'll be out before
[11:37.960 --> 11:43.280]  he's inaugurated in a couple months this is November 2016 he's gone and so
[11:43.280 --> 11:47.720]  they deployed on a late night comedy and they deployed all the fake news to
[11:47.720 --> 11:52.120]  say Trump is not even going to get inaugurated remember that and then they
[11:52.120 --> 12:03.440]  said electors don't on January 7th go in to Congress and give your votes to him
[12:03.440 --> 12:07.400]  in the electoral college remember that and they had Nancy Pelosi's daughter on
[12:07.400 --> 12:14.000]  Fox News going we're not gonna let him be seated and then she went but Alex
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.880]  Jones threatened me and he needs to be shut down never said a word about her I
[12:19.880 --> 12:22.960]  said they're traitors their enemies trying to overthrow our country and then
[12:22.960 --> 12:27.120]  I learned later from the Justice Department Patriots in there that they
[12:27.120 --> 12:32.320]  had meetings with Pelosi and others demanding my arrest and then a month
[12:32.320 --> 12:37.560]  later they were having congressional hearings saying Alex Jones is a Russian
[12:37.560 --> 12:42.200]  and we want him arrested and I'm up here watching all this happen all because
[12:42.200 --> 12:47.080]  I'm going hey they tried to steal the nomination they did steal it from
[12:47.080 --> 12:52.160]  Bernie Sanders on record they they're they're trying to not seat his electors
[12:52.160 --> 12:56.200]  they're trying to block the electoral college and have the people that are
[12:56.200 --> 13:00.520]  supposed to deliver the votes say that they represent the voters and that
[13:00.520 --> 13:04.400]  they're not gonna follow the popular vote remember all that do we have amnesia
[13:04.400 --> 13:09.320]  I'm making a film on this this is this is so important Zach had a great idea so
[13:09.320 --> 13:14.840]  they were all over the news saying he's a Russian he will not get put into office
[13:14.840 --> 13:21.320]  and then I was there on January 20th when they wouldn't let people in to the
[13:21.320 --> 13:23.840]  inauguration and I was there where they was the front page of New York Times
[13:23.840 --> 13:28.040]  saying we have wiretaps of Trump Tower we know he's a Russian and I go look they
[13:28.040 --> 13:32.840]  admit they're spying on him they go you're crazy we're not spying because it
[13:32.840 --> 13:35.680]  was illegal so they wanted to say we're spying don't worry he's a Russian hold
[13:35.680 --> 13:39.280]  on government don't do what he says but out of the other side of their mouth
[13:39.280 --> 13:46.560]  they were saying oh we're not doing it so when we come back I'm gonna reveal the
[13:46.560 --> 13:52.760]  biggest mole confirmed inside the White House with all these fake leaks because
[13:52.760 --> 13:56.560]  they use the fact that they're inside to mix truth with lies and disinfo now
[13:56.560 --> 13:59.840]  we're gonna go to break we're gonna come back and go over all of this ladies and
[13:59.840 --> 14:05.760]  gentlemen but my source on them spying on Trump is Barack Hussein Obama my source
[14:05.760 --> 14:11.480]  is Hillary Clinton they were quoted in the New York Times on January 7th and
[14:11.480 --> 14:16.600]  8th saying so that the electors from electoral college would read it and go
[14:16.600 --> 14:21.320]  okay the president says it said Obama is quoted by the New York Times as telling
[14:21.320 --> 14:26.400]  this reporter that he won't get seated because he's a Russian agent and they're
[14:26.400 --> 14:30.640]  gonna bring him down and people when the president is telling people that
[14:30.640 --> 14:35.880]  they're believing it of course I was saying they were surveilling him they
[14:35.880 --> 14:40.440]  were on the news saying it and they think you have amnesia they think you're a
[14:40.440 --> 14:45.560]  goldfish member Gruber said thank God you're so dumb and have no memory we're
[14:45.560 --> 14:50.000]  gonna triple their health care prices because you're so stupid I don't think

[21:32.520 --> 21:36.520]  you know why I got really excited earlier because I can feel it and I can
[21:36.520 --> 21:40.640]  see it and I can you know when something's happened you feel the energy
[21:40.640 --> 21:43.480]  it's like when you're in the room and you know somebody died you know yet
[21:43.480 --> 21:46.480]  didn't work paying attention you look over and grandma's dead she just went
[21:46.480 --> 21:50.600]  you felt it you feel somebody looking at you you know from the back in a

[21:52.720 --> 21:57.920]  scientifically proven it's much more complex than that and I'm not bragging

[22:04.640 --> 22:10.640]  have poured in to resisting these people and as I feel them weakening and
[22:10.640 --> 22:14.600]  imploding I feel like I'm coming up out of the water like I'm alive that's why
[22:14.600 --> 22:21.920]  I was just yeah yeah yeah I'm bursting out of water you down there a thousand feet

[22:51.800 --> 22:54.400]  of a sudden you go out of the storm and it's like it's not even any wind and
[22:54.400 --> 22:59.640]  it's all beautiful blue skies you're like you get out of your car park at some
[22:59.640 --> 23:02.760]  road stop and you look back at the big storm and the lightning everything
[23:02.760 --> 23:07.560]  you're like it's like two different universes and that's what's happening and
[23:07.560 --> 23:12.200]  and their power over our minds and our souls it's spiritual they're losing
[23:12.200 --> 23:17.600]  power right now yeah look at Michael Flynn juniors sent this tweet out today
[23:17.600 --> 23:25.640]  everybody should retweet it you're all going down you know who you are mark my
[23:25.640 --> 23:45.240]  word Michael Caputo came out and he said that of course there's other moles
[23:45.240 --> 23:50.640]  and he's ready to name them from the FBI in the campaign but it's pretty obvious
[23:50.640 --> 23:53.960]  who they are they're the ones that kept going to all these meetings that were
[23:53.960 --> 23:57.320]  had minutes and saying hey what about Russia let's meet with the Russians are
[23:57.320 --> 24:00.800]  the Russians pretty cool couldn't we you know disarmed the Russians couldn't we
[24:00.800 --> 24:04.600]  sell the Russians I mean I had people I was in DC walking over to me while I
[24:04.600 --> 24:10.640]  was at dinner tables while I was sitting there with Navy SEALs active duty and
[24:10.640 --> 24:14.880]  the and the people walking over the table they did it twice they knew what
[24:14.880 --> 24:19.120]  Navy SEALs I was with one of them was the leader of a major submarine group
[24:19.120 --> 24:25.520]  like a bunch of classified stuff and this guy walks over to the middle of the
[24:25.520 --> 24:32.080]  table and says you know I really want to learn about selling some submarine
[24:32.080 --> 24:38.080]  technology to the Taiwanese and and the Navy SEALs go I mean that's the kind of
[24:38.080 --> 24:41.480]  stuff we're dealing with where these people coming in have files on not just
[24:41.480 --> 24:46.640]  me but who we're with and imagine if we just joked around oh yeah I'll sell you
[24:46.640 --> 24:50.080]  some submarine technology
[24:54.960 --> 24:58.680]  that's the level we're at here so a lot of this I can't even get into but I'm
[24:58.680 --> 25:02.720]  gonna give you one of the moles because there's Fox News has the big
[25:02.720 --> 25:07.240]  exclusive that oh my gosh you know Halperin was the mole we told you that
[25:07.240 --> 25:10.560]  five days before the New York Times and they did and I've got a lot of other
[25:10.560 --> 25:13.520]  information here I just want you to know that here's the headline another
[25:13.520 --> 25:19.200]  informant attempted to infiltrate Trump's campaign under Obama campaign aid
[25:19.200 --> 25:23.720]  says Michael Caputo and Caputo been talking to him his lawyer didn't want
[25:23.720 --> 25:28.960]  to come on but I'm trying to get him on right now let us give you who one of the
[25:28.960 --> 25:33.400]  bigger moles is who was leaking it to the media and to everybody else and it's a
[25:33.400 --> 25:37.320]  mole that we exposed in dozens of articles last year and that Trump became
[25:37.320 --> 25:43.080]  aware of and removed and then removed who the mole brought in and that of course
[25:43.080 --> 25:48.200]  was HR McMasters and his aid so let's get into this right now in full wars
[25:48.200 --> 25:57.520]  calm Clifford cutting him May 31st 2017 bombshell Soros insider infiltrates
[25:57.520 --> 26:06.200]  Trump campaign in that precious Trump insider Roger Stone warned globalist
[26:06.200 --> 26:09.040]  billionaire George Soros has infiltrated the Trump administration through a
[26:09.040 --> 26:12.400]  newly appointed member of the National Security Council tied to CFR and Soros
[26:12.400 --> 26:16.840]  funded school in Hungary where his command base was this is very hard to
[26:16.840 --> 26:21.440]  believe but I am confirmed the facts again this morning George Soros has
[26:21.440 --> 26:24.340]  penetrated the Trump White House said stone during an appearance on the
[26:24.340 --> 26:28.960]  Alex Jones show Soros has planted a mole infiltrating the National Security
[26:28.960 --> 26:33.200]  apparatus a woman named Fiona Hill who has a Harvard background she has been
[26:33.200 --> 26:40.400]  on the Soros payroll and the payroll of the Open Society Institute
[26:40.400 --> 26:46.400]  well media matters that Soros funds bragged to Politico five years ago that
[26:46.400 --> 26:49.440]  they were infiltrating conservative media outlets and trying to set people up
[26:49.440 --> 26:54.640]  this is espionage so of course they infiltrated of course they were spying
[26:54.640 --> 27:04.520]  and they've been caught so all of this is coming out see how that is in May 19th
[27:04.520 --> 27:10.680]  of the intercept and Glenn Greenwald go to last Sunday go to our article from
[27:10.680 --> 27:16.120]  the Sunday before last we broke it first you can see it right there YouTube FBI
[27:16.120 --> 27:23.480]  mole inside Trump campaign exposed exclusive and it's right there and
[27:23.480 --> 27:27.760]  only I keep going back to that is that's why they fear us that's why they hate
[27:27.760 --> 27:32.720]  us because other people are all scared to do this if we do it first over and
[27:32.720 --> 27:37.080]  over and over again that it makes it safe for others to do it and that's why
[27:37.080 --> 27:40.400]  they say where does Trump get all this he gets it from Alex Jones and where does
[27:40.400 --> 27:43.680]  Sean Hannity get it Alex Jones and where's Rush Limbaugh get it Alex Jones
[27:43.680 --> 27:48.280]  and the truth is those people already all know this stuff too they've got
[27:48.280 --> 27:52.920]  better sources than I do Sean Hannity talks to president every day but Fox
[27:52.920 --> 27:58.080]  News tries to keep him on a leash so I can put it out then that allows other
[27:58.080 --> 28:02.360]  people to research it then it breaks on local talk radio in other areas and then
[28:02.360 --> 28:06.440]  it's safe for them to cover it and that's how we're breaking the globalist
[28:06.440 --> 28:13.640]  and ripping them to pieces right now so there it is and we're gonna reveal other
[28:13.640 --> 28:17.600]  moles we know a bunch of them we're gonna be exposing it actively leaking lying
[28:17.600 --> 28:21.000]  about what they put out the leaks themselves are fake they use their
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.440]  proximity of the president to mix some truth with lies this is what they're
[28:24.440 --> 28:27.960]  doing they've got electronic leaking going on all of it but the big news here
[28:27.960 --> 28:32.080]  is criminal investigation now opened they have them open and shut lying to
[28:32.080 --> 28:37.840]  Congress we have them now we have the whole Clinton crime cabal at the top
[28:37.840 --> 28:42.920]  of the DOJ in desperate deep trouble and you can see all the sold-out media
[28:42.920 --> 28:48.520]  starting to realize this is starting to hedge their bets start to say hey we need
[28:48.520 --> 28:51.560]  to impeach Trump and let's get some real dirt first we don't have any real dirt
[28:51.560 --> 28:55.440]  when we shoot we need to shoot to kill that's the quote we're gonna cover

[30:52.920 --> 30:56.320]  aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word again thank you so much
[30:56.320 --> 31:01.400]  for being part of the second American revolution. Info war's life is bringing
[31:01.400 --> 31:05.880]  you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block we have found
[31:05.880 --> 31:10.400]  an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[31:10.400 --> 31:15.480]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and
[31:15.480 --> 31:20.760]  respiratory function. In the 1960s researchers in France noticed that
[31:20.760 --> 31:24.720]  people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and
[31:24.720 --> 31:29.080]  inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials
[31:29.080 --> 31:34.200]  and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable
[31:34.200 --> 31:38.400]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is
[31:38.400 --> 31:43.160]  natural and effective it is not an antihistamine. In fact current research
[31:43.160 --> 31:47.200]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which
[31:47.200 --> 31:52.160]  is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go
[31:52.160 --> 31:57.320]  outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack
[31:57.320 --> 32:02.640]  of our pollen block chewable tablets. Fueling your body is hard work that's

[33:02.520 --> 33:07.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:07.960 --> 33:21.400]  Live from Austin Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[33:28.760 --> 33:34.040]  Coming up we're gonna play the video next segment. Democrat representative says
[33:34.040 --> 33:40.880]  will impeach Trump if we win back the house. But another Democrat then says
[33:40.880 --> 33:46.600]  live on television we need to shoot to kill though. So that is coming up with
[33:46.600 --> 33:51.600]  their violent rhetoric that they couch in political parlance. That's all coming
[33:51.600 --> 33:56.440]  up in the next segment. Again I'm your host Alex Jones here in just a minute or
[33:56.440 --> 34:01.320]  two. I'm gonna play a boil down of the media denying that there was any spying
[34:01.320 --> 34:05.600]  on Trump and then later having to admit that okay there was spying on Trump but
[34:05.600 --> 34:10.880]  you're going to learn about hundreds and hundreds of people in the executive
[34:10.880 --> 34:18.000]  branch and in the campaign that have been turned. There are thousands of people
[34:18.000 --> 34:22.600]  that were in Trump's orbit. Many people are very weak-minded they're very
[34:22.600 --> 34:25.600]  dishonorable. They've been brought up with silver spoons in their mouths and
[34:25.600 --> 34:32.720]  they're very two-faced and so the more pressure got put on Trump people would
[34:32.720 --> 34:39.040]  hedge their bets. People would go oh man everybody's out to get him I better go
[34:39.040 --> 34:41.840]  ahead and leak some stuff I better go ahead and work with the media. That way
[34:41.840 --> 34:50.280]  Washington will be nice to me. If Trump gets destroyed no now they'll never hire
[34:50.280 --> 34:56.480]  you or work with you because you're a trader because you're a sellout. Do you
[34:56.480 --> 35:00.760]  think these globalist scumbags sell each other out? No they understand working
[35:00.760 --> 35:04.560]  together in their criminal enterprise but those of you that help lower the
[35:04.560 --> 35:09.640]  drawbridge on Trump have now been discovered and you are going to either
[35:09.640 --> 35:15.000]  go to prison or never work again. Guaranteed you screwed yourselves over.
[35:15.000 --> 35:19.480]  There's a quote here one of my favorite quotes I probably read on air 50 times
[35:19.480 --> 35:25.120]  in the last 23 years on air and this time
[35:25.640 --> 35:29.720]  former CIA director John Brennan the guy that said the president should watch
[35:29.720 --> 35:35.200]  his mouth two days before the inauguration quote Cicero while DOJ
[35:35.200 --> 35:41.760]  expands IG FISA abuse investigation. Now what's the narrative he's stupid what
[35:41.760 --> 35:47.720]  did Bill Gates say? Donald Trump didn't know the difference between HPV human
[35:47.720 --> 35:56.640]  papillomavirus and HIV which you know is just totally made up but it's all about
[35:56.640 --> 36:03.040]  the narrative of how stupid he is. So Brennan has been defeated by this moron
[36:03.040 --> 36:08.120]  Donald Trump. Brennan couldn't get a 3% growth rate now we're at 3.2 the new
[36:08.120 --> 36:14.840]  numbers are coming out at 4 reportedly. Heard that here first by the way. So you
[36:14.840 --> 36:23.720]  got beaten by I guess the idiot strength of Trump. No you guys are drunk on power
[36:23.720 --> 36:30.200]  and so crazy arrogant that you all bragged that he would never be seated as
[36:30.200 --> 36:34.080]  the president on January 20th and then you had communists out there beating up
[36:34.080 --> 36:37.800]  families trying to keep him from going in so you could shoot photos of the mall
[36:37.800 --> 36:42.000]  not being full. By the way there's so many lies I can't even keep track of them.
[36:42.000 --> 36:51.800]  BBC tweeted out on Saturday and tried to quote that the headline was BBC Trolls.
[36:51.800 --> 37:01.920]  I want to do a whole piece on this. BBC Trolls Trump. This is so incredible and
[37:01.920 --> 37:08.960]  they said BBC Trolls Trump because they they show the royal wedding and how that
[37:08.960 --> 37:13.400]  entire big park was lined with people and then it shows Trump's inauguration
[37:13.400 --> 37:17.360]  right when they opened the gate so it looks like it's empty. They say look
[37:17.360 --> 37:26.720]  nobody came to see Trump's event but they did go see the Queen. That was taken
[37:26.720 --> 37:33.400]  that photo at 8 30 in the morning. We did a whole report on this. Just a few
[37:33.400 --> 37:36.120]  minutes after they opened the gates because they were wandering everybody
[37:36.120 --> 37:40.120]  and getting their tickets going in. You see the giant crowds of people trying to
[37:40.120 --> 37:44.880]  get in all lined up on the sides and the whole thing didn't kick off for a
[37:44.880 --> 37:49.600]  couple hours so they show the wedding during the middle of it and say look at
[37:49.600 --> 37:53.680]  this crowd and it zoomed in by the way they look bigger so you can see each
[37:53.680 --> 37:58.960]  person and then they show this far-off shot to deceive you and recycle that lie.
[37:58.960 --> 38:03.440]  We have the HD video. We have the HD photos from CNN taken from the Capitol
[38:03.440 --> 38:10.280]  and you can see the record crowd according to the Capitol police. But again
[38:10.280 --> 38:15.920]  this is how they systematically lie at every level and every angle at every
[38:15.920 --> 38:26.600]  point perpetually. Oh there's the headline BBC trolls Trump. No they trolled
[38:26.600 --> 38:32.760]  the people watching. Oh look our hereditary queen, our hereditary dictator
[38:32.760 --> 38:43.440]  oh look these rich welfare queens they live off the people while thousands of
[38:43.440 --> 38:45.880]  old people freeze that every year because the government cut off their gas
[38:45.880 --> 38:51.480]  allotment while old people freeze to death the BBC worships the monarchy and
[38:51.480 --> 38:57.800]  then look oh there it is right when the mall opened of your TV viewer and then
[38:57.800 --> 39:00.600]  let's show while the president was being sworn in let's show it again from
[39:00.600 --> 39:05.200]  CNN's own digital camera but CNN didn't care. One part of CNN posted the digital
[39:05.200 --> 39:10.120]  camera photos the super pixel you know 200 megapixel or whatever but then the
[39:10.120 --> 39:13.800]  separately CNN also ran the lie of showing it empty and said look no one
[39:13.800 --> 39:20.160]  was there. While the real story was people were getting beaten up I saw
[39:20.160 --> 39:23.680]  women beaten up by anti-fund communists while the police still under
[39:23.680 --> 39:28.080]  Obama's control until the president was sworn in allowed it so there's the real
[39:28.080 --> 39:42.680]  photo by the way I'm in that crowd I'm right there in the crowd boom there I am
[39:42.680 --> 39:50.160]  I was there 50 yards from the president being sworn in and that's how stupid they
[39:50.160 --> 39:57.080]  think you are that's what they show you on CNN BBC they say nobody was there
[39:57.080 --> 40:02.400]  tell them I was just taking a photo the day before and then I was there I saw it
[40:02.400 --> 40:11.400]  I witnessed it all this is the criminal evil of these people makes me really get
[40:11.400 --> 40:19.000]  upset now before I go any further we need to be funded yes we're starting to

[48:07.680 --> 48:14.400]  London hospital to replace doctors and nurses with AI let me give you a little
[48:14.400 --> 48:21.240]  newsflash ladies and gentlemen there's something called bioethics it replaced
[48:21.240 --> 48:31.520]  the Hippocratic oath of Hippocrates and for at least eight years a computer
[48:31.520 --> 48:45.880]  program called Watson named after Thomas Watson of IBM infamy came out with the
[48:45.880 --> 48:50.760]  fact that they had computers deciding what troops what veterans will be given
[48:50.760 --> 48:56.000]  health care that was the secret death list and hospitals are already putting
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.960]  these computers in because they found that they can't get the bioethics boards
[49:00.960 --> 49:05.080]  even though it's all about money to kill enough people to refuse care to enough
[49:05.080 --> 49:09.080]  folks to lie to people and turn turn their families off before they come out
[49:09.080 --> 49:16.760]  of comas if their insurance is run out and so now it's gonna be Thomas Watson
[49:16.760 --> 49:22.320]  computers all over the world running it and isn't that fitting because it was
[49:22.320 --> 49:28.240]  Thomas Watson computers back when he was alive called the hollereth machine that
[49:28.240 --> 49:33.160]  ran the Nazi Holocaust and he received the highest award ever given by the
[49:33.160 --> 49:38.040]  Nazi Party or Nazi government for what he did there's a best-selling Pulitzer
[49:38.040 --> 49:43.240]  Prize winning book about it several books detailing it and you can find out
[49:43.240 --> 49:48.640]  all about it we've had ebb and black on IBM in the Holocaust so you might want
[49:48.640 --> 49:55.880]  to find out about it in that sweet sweet there it is IBM dealt directly with
[49:55.880 --> 50:02.040]  Holocaust organizers the London Guardian that's a whitewash it's the left that
[50:02.040 --> 50:08.080]  ran the Nazis that it was all a beta test it's all declassified because they're
[50:08.080 --> 50:11.720]  not the left folks they're the Nazis that they they they fill that space and
[50:11.720 --> 50:14.640]  everything's race-based because the Nazis are race-based they just do it from a
[50:14.640 --> 50:18.440]  minority position to make whites hate minorities and vice versa for total
[50:18.440 --> 50:25.800]  control it's next level Nazism and Bill Gates's father ran the operation for
[50:25.800 --> 50:29.160]  Planned Parenthood and actually wrote up the main diagrams for the takeover of
[50:29.160 --> 50:34.920]  the US and this is all public he talks about it on PBS 20 years ago and now
[50:34.920 --> 50:38.880]  his son was given control of some of the main systems to run it he's a complete
[50:38.880 --> 50:46.080]  front is in control of none of it himself but meanwhile Germany's Nazi

[51:04.280 --> 51:09.400]  the subject you might want to go watch it free online the leftist professors
[51:09.400 --> 51:14.600]  in slate want that particular video band saying that it's Nazi you you heard
[51:14.600 --> 51:23.520]  me right because it exposes the Nazis there nasty little fellows aren't they
[51:23.520 --> 51:32.680]  very very nasty little fellows very nasty they think you're so stupid I
[51:32.680 --> 51:35.960]  never got to the Brennan quote I'll do it in the next segment where he quotes
[51:35.960 --> 51:40.120]  Cicero I mentioned it earlier and went off on a side tangent let's go to this
[51:40.120 --> 51:43.760]  report though of the egg on their face saying that no one was spying on Trump
[51:43.760 --> 51:48.040]  there was no infiltration this is beyond Watergate we boil it down this goes back
[51:48.040 --> 51:52.000]  a year and a half ago right through to this week here it is one thing that
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.520]  happens when you make wild unproven claims as Trump does is that the people
[51:55.520 --> 51:58.920]  around you have to go to increasingly ridiculous lengths to try to defend those
[51:58.920 --> 52:02.200]  claims and this weekend we saw another example of that when White House
[52:02.200 --> 52:06.240]  counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked if she had any proof for Trump's outlandish
[52:06.240 --> 52:10.240]  claim that Obama wiretapped him during the campaign and offered this bizarre
[52:10.240 --> 52:14.200]  answer how does he know that that it act this that his phone was actually tapped
[52:14.200 --> 52:17.720]  let me answer that globally he's the president the United States he has
[52:17.720 --> 52:21.400]  information and intelligence that the rest of us do not you know what yeah I'll
[52:21.400 --> 52:27.840]  agree with that Trump has intelligence that I definitely do not I agree I just
[52:27.840 --> 52:32.240]  want to add this they were breaking the law to release the fact they were first
[52:32.240 --> 52:37.040]  surveilling him he made that point criminal investigations were started he's
[52:37.040 --> 52:40.280]  been letting them get the rope around their neck and boy isn't it around their
[52:40.280 --> 52:46.080]  next now continue listen people one more time Trump's accusation is ridiculous
[52:46.080 --> 52:50.960]  and pathetic he's suggesting a US president enlisted a foreign intelligence
[52:50.960 --> 52:54.880]  service to spy on a political adversary that is the explosive charge this is a
[52:54.880 --> 52:59.320]  serious allegation this might be the most serious allegation any president has
[52:59.320 --> 53:03.600]  made against a previous president but this is a very serious allegation for
[53:03.600 --> 53:07.480]  sitting presidents and make about his predecessor tweeted terrible just found
[53:07.480 --> 53:12.040]  out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory
[53:12.040 --> 53:16.880]  nothing by the way Trump got that from people inside the British government and
[53:16.880 --> 53:22.760]  from folks inside info poll 9 and from the director of the NSA Admiral Rogers
[53:22.760 --> 53:26.040]  that came in briefed him but he's not supposed to tell you that so they can
[53:26.040 --> 53:30.200]  play these games we have them red-handed continue this is McCarthyism and
[53:30.200 --> 53:34.160]  the other one how low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the
[53:34.160 --> 53:39.000]  very sacred election process this is Nixon watergate bad or sick guy said
[53:39.000 --> 53:44.160]  Obama is either a bad or sick guy maybe he means with his compliments like yeah
[53:44.160 --> 53:49.120]  man he's bad it's a bad guy the NSA's deputy director told the BBC it was
[53:49.120 --> 53:53.640]  Aaron's nonsense revealing a complete lack of understanding in how the
[53:53.640 --> 53:58.280]  relationship works and for their part GCH Q called the accusations utterly
[53:58.280 --> 54:02.280]  ridiculous and yet rather than distancing himself from spicer Trump
[54:02.280 --> 54:06.040]  decided to back him up the craziest thing about Trump calling for an
[54:06.040 --> 54:10.720]  investigation without any evidence zero evidence Trump has not produced a shred
[54:10.720 --> 54:14.280]  of evidence there was no evidence for Trump's claims the there what evidence
[54:14.280 --> 54:19.160]  did not come so where did Trump get his info from the CIA from the FBI where
[54:19.160 --> 54:24.280]  are you getting this information from a very reputable source what the FBI the
[54:24.280 --> 54:30.220]  CIA info wars it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones you know he's legit this
[54:30.220 --> 54:34.880]  bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was
[54:34.880 --> 54:39.400]  wiretapped which developed on the kind of fringe right wing media and then after
[54:39.400 --> 54:42.880]  his tweet storm info wars then started saying well look it was the New York
[54:42.880 --> 54:47.320]  Times that reported it citing our story misreading our story and now a few weeks
[54:47.320 --> 54:52.760]  later the White House and the president are citing info wars so they've got one
[54:52.760 --> 54:56.080]  kind of bizarre right wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right wing
[54:56.080 --> 54:59.680]  fringe theory both of which there's no evidence to support major developments
[54:59.680 --> 55:04.160]  again tonight on the deep state spying on the Trump campaign James Clapper
[55:04.160 --> 55:08.760]  Barack Obama's former director of national intelligence is actually today
[55:08.760 --> 55:14.840]  saying it was a good thing that the Trump campaign had a spy for the FBI in
[55:14.840 --> 55:19.360]  their campaign during an election it turns out according to new reports the
[55:19.360 --> 55:25.320]  FBI may have had a spy in or interacting with the Trump campaign during the
[55:25.320 --> 55:29.800]  2016 election a government spy in the campaign remember when Trump was
[55:29.800 --> 55:34.560]  ridiculed by everyone when he said they you know I was wiretapped he speaks in
[55:34.560 --> 55:37.680]  shorthand at Twitter I was wiretapped or whatever that tweet was he meant
[55:37.680 --> 55:40.960]  surveilled yeah he meant surveilled he was right he was absolutely right judge
[55:40.960 --> 55:44.320]  Andrew Napolitano they crashed him right here in Fox the first one to call
[55:44.320 --> 55:49.880]  this look this has to be seen in context not only did they use a phony
[55:49.880 --> 55:56.440]  fabricated dossier as the underlying legal rationale for the spying on the
[55:56.440 --> 56:00.520]  Republican candidate for president using the power and the authority and the
[56:00.520 --> 56:04.480]  capability of the state to spy on one of the two major party candidates and
[56:04.480 --> 56:10.200]  abuse of power but now they infiltrated the Trump campaign with a FBI agent this
[56:10.200 --> 56:14.280]  makes Watergate look like small potatoes this is Watergate on steroids
[56:14.280 --> 56:19.140]  remember the Nixon scandal it was about a third-rate burglary this is a deep
[56:19.140 --> 56:25.200]  state political hit job now spying on an opposition party campaign FBI spies
[56:25.200 --> 56:30.960]  during an election a human intelligence asset may have been inserted in your
[56:30.960 --> 56:36.280]  political rivals campaign I mean how this is in front-page news on every
[56:36.280 --> 56:40.840]  news paper across the globe is stunning we have a cabal of FBI agents who took
[56:40.840 --> 56:47.000]  it upon themselves to investigate a candidate in his campaign and then we
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.560]  have of course actual spies one or more in the Trump campaign what the hell is
[56:51.560 --> 56:55.280]  this the Soviet Union Venezuela it's the United States of America if that's
[56:55.280 --> 56:58.960]  the case this is not America we don't have a Constitution this is something
[56:58.960 --> 57:03.200]  you'd expect from the former Soviet Union Venezuela I'm not saying this as a
[57:03.200 --> 57:07.280]  Republican or conservative I find it frightening that the power of the
[57:07.280 --> 57:11.560]  federal government could be used in this manner and the in the middle of a
[57:11.560 --> 57:16.640]  political season with spurious or scant evidence

[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.720]  things happening a lot of bad things happening. Coming up Dr. Nick Baggage is
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:31.720]  going to join us and we're gonna look at hospitals across the world are now
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:37.720]  letting AI computers decide who lives and who dies so the doctors and nurses
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.400]  don't feel bad about the insurance companies and governments programming
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:48.000]  who dies. So you put the responsibility on a computer and people find it's easier
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.920]  to then kill people and of course Hitler was obsessed with IBM and Thomas Watson
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:57.080]  and gave him the highest award in Nazi Germany and its IBM is the main system
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.600]  starting out eight years ago in the VAs that says oh you got an operable cancer
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:07.120]  computer says we're not gonna give you the surgery go die but the computer knows
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:10.680]  to send you to appointment after appointment and never even tells you
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:16.000]  what you've been diagnosed with it's all programmed with delicious precision.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.320]  Here it is the London Guardian though tells you about it it's gonna save the
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:26.920]  National Health Service that the UK pedophile of government will now be in
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:36.040]  control fully. Not the doctors but oh the AI you mean who programs the AI. Perhaps
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:42.720]  Cobra Commander. London hospitals to replace doctors and nurses with AI for
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:48.040]  some task. So they're introducing us where you think of the real terminators
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:54.520]  is like looking like humans and going you're killing humans oh no you'll
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:58.040]  never it'll be a nice nurse and doctor coming in and saying all right you're
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.160]  gonna go home now you might feel a little dizzy in a few months might lose
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:07.160]  some vision we'll supply with hospice what do I have doctor what's wrong with
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.880]  me um that's the the the computer made the decision we're thank you bye bye
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.480]  we're not allowed to know what the scan said the computer looked at it you got a
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.560]  big old giant fat brain tumor one of your eyes didn't even point the right
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.480]  direction you'll be dead in a couple months your brain tumors 97% operable
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:29.360]  but the machine is gonna kill you because it's liberal so good and all the
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.480]  liberals think they're gonna get all these big free goodies are coming and
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.680]  what you're gonna get is what the National Health Service I told you
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.640]  just like Cuba or Venezuela oh one legs four inches shorter than the other
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.640]  sweetheart we're not gonna go in for a surgery that cost about $5,000 in the
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.320]  US and most places would just donate to you they have charities that pay for it
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:53.480]  for an extension in your in your femur we're gonna cut your leg off

[01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:09.440]  need your support
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:26.840]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones why has Elon
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:32.840]  Musk over and over again warned you that AI is going to kill you why is he said
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:36.880]  that AI is already killing you and he warns you to look at it when he's a
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:41.960]  multi-billionaire globalist let's say inside the globalist system but a good
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:47.280]  guy overall probably he has a conscience because he's gone to the same
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.240]  meetings that Bill Joyce gone to and talked about where they've made the
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.720]  decision to euthanize you to cut off resources dumb you down you psych warfare
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:07:02.160]  to where you accept your servitude and your extermination that's pretty heavy
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:06.600]  but that's everything I put in in game that came out 11 years ago Elon Musk is
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:11.640]  now saying it the film's free online you might want to go watch in-game
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:15.320]  blueprint for global enslavement per major professors in Slate magazine are
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:22.840]  calling for that film and others by name be removed he calls it a Nazi movie the
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:30.640]  film exposes the Nazis and Cold Springs Harbor and IBM so how are they gonna get
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:34.200]  around to that well I remember learning eight years ago two years into Obama's
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:39.520]  administration that there were death lists at the VA and that a computer would
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:47.640]  say who got a surgery who got anything and and it takes out of the hands of
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:51.440]  humans you say oh a computer can't make a mistake it's a god it's up there it
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:55.440]  makes the decision who programs the computer and what is the computer's
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:04.440]  name at the hospitals where this has been adopted it's called Thomas after
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:09.720]  Thomas Watson and I keep going over this because we're already under AI control
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:18.240]  and who's programming the AI and there's just ads all over TV trust AI let it run
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:25.880]  things it knows what to do but AI is like a gun it's a tool that can be
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:31.840]  programmed a certain way it can do good it can do bad the hospitals have tried
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.640]  to get rid of the hypocritic of they try to bring in their bioethics boards but
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.800]  still they have lawsuits they have problems people have ethical issues
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.400]  about killing folks that shouldn't be turned off and all the rest of it and
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.440]  not giving people eye surgery they need or not giving people leg surgery they
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.600]  need tell little girls in the National Health Service we could straighten out
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.160]  your leg for five thousand dollars three thousand pounds but we're not gonna do
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:56.080]  it because the AI said you don't get it we're gonna the AI the computer says
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:01.560]  chop your leg off do you see how the decision process is being removed pretty
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:05.040]  soon they say cop cars are gonna have cameras on the cops and everything and
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:09.760]  AI in the ear of the cop is gonna tell them procedure to follow and tell them
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.200]  you're not doing right I'm reporting you you're a member section 783 filing for
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:18.200]  what you've done that is one demerit officer system such that if you
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:23.880]  perfectly follow what the robot says Sergeant Johnson Sergeant Sanchez you
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.960]  have a perfect score this quarter you will be given five thousand bonus
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:35.440]  credits and and and that's the system so they're already taking humans out of
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:40.920]  it and here it is just like oh no big deal you know it's the London Guardian
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:46.440]  oh London hospitals replace doctors and nurses with AI no big deal and oh
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:54.600]  they're just gonna make the decisions it's just some some tasks like you know
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.320]  decided we're gonna get cancer treatment but don't worry it's game changing
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:06.200]  benefits oh oh yeah oh it's here like the salt driving cars killing everybody
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.640]  and just like calculators made it where nobody could do math anymore and the
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.880]  children can't even write me more English language over thinking they've got
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:24.200]  emojis though happy sad skull rainbow kitty cat unicorn whiteface blackface
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:33.440]  green face police car telephone computer we have emojis now you can see how
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.080]  this is going it's going quite well isn't it all right I'm done ranting
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.560]  about that I've got some big news I want to hit here and also want to take a few
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.200]  of your phone calls we got Nick baggage coming up but I want to get a few of
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.520]  your phone calls just your quick approximation of the indictments that
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.560]  are forthcoming against the deep state players for their criminal spying on the
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:56.560]  Trump campaign bigger than Watergate by an order of magnitude blown wide open the
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:01.320]  third mole exposed inside the White House exclusively at info wars.com we
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:04.600]  want to go find out about the third mole caputo said there's a second mole we
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:09.480]  have the third mole named for you on info wars.com it's a pretty big deal I
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:14.120]  want to go read about that for yourself and info wars.com and then we've got
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:19.360]  all of this other insane news that we're going to hit the toll-free number to
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:27.400]  join us is H77789 Alex but who even needs a number just have a chip in your
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.560]  brain like they're announcing they're gonna put the troops that's mainstream
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:35.200]  today and just say Alex Jones show call it see the AI then not gonna let you call
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.560]  that show or not let you go to that that's already happening tell it's
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.040]  already deciding who lives and who dies who gets health care why not it's
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:50.360]  liberal 877789 Alex 8777892539 specifically on do you think the tides
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:53.520]  turned I can see it's turned doesn't mean we're winning the whole war but
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.480]  humanity's really starting to wake up and we should do something about this
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.840]  we're talking with Dr. Nick baggage about all the things that are happening you
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.120]  know I saw it on drudge it's on info wars he doesn't print me that article
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.920]  about the troops to get implanted chips in them just to be part of the military
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.280]  but people might want to know that because remember we were all in saying
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:13.760]  that was never coming that was ever gonna happen but now it's here and then
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.360]  I've got two video clips I haven't gotten to yet Harvard law professor Lawrence
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:23.320]  tribe warns the Dems pushing Trump impeachment you have to shoot to kill
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:27.360]  we're gonna explain what that means probably to my take on that coming up
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:31.080]  and we're also gonna get to this other Democrat congressman saying oh we will
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.560]  impeach Trump in fact let's just do that right now let's go ahead and play
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:48.600]  first the Democrat congressman and of course that is that is representative
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:53.760]  Algreen he says will impeach Trump if we went back to house that's the plan and
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:56.440]  we've got tribes saying shoot to kill let's go ahead play out green here it is
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.760]  representative green if Democrats take back the house in November what is the
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:05.680]  likelihood that speaker Nancy Pelosi will bring up an impeachment charge I'll
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:12.240]  let speaker Pelosi address her actions but here is a point that I think is
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:19.680]  salient and one that ought to be referenced every member of the house is
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:24.360]  accorded the opportunity to bring up impeachment this is not something that
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.800]  the Constitution has bestowed upon leadership it's something that every
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:32.760]  member has the right and privilege of doing so I'm not sure that there'll be
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:36.920]  members who are going to wait for someone else if that's someone else
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:42.880]  doesn't matter who it is is declining to do it we can all do it and I think that
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.600]  there's a good likelihood that there will be articles of impeachment have you
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.080]  heard directly from this the minority leader about these efforts of yours
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:54.320]  specifically to ask you to stop asking you to hold back anything along that
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:58.840]  line well I don't think you you have to ask me whether I've heard I think it's
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.760]  probably if you've read publications it's intuitively obvious to perhaps even
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.120]  the most casual observer that she and I in different places on this and I
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:16.320]  respect her position we have AI for eight years at least killing tens of
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.960]  thousands of US soldiers veterans just saying no health care just it's on record
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.560]  death list the government will investigate then they went don't worry
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:27.040]  we're gonna put computers in all the VAs they'll fix it they're the ones
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:34.400]  killing everybody meanwhile US military to spend 50 million pounds on digital
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.120]  brand implants to create super soldiers where'd you first hear about that
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.840]  really what it creates people they can wipe your memory yes you'll be a super
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.280]  soldier now it'll just turn off your inhibitions and stuff so you let them
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.640]  have a heart attacks and break your back and everything and then of course you
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.800]  will just wipe your memories after we're done that's all admitted as well it's
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.480]  okay it's liberal we don't need men anyways we're getting rid of humans in
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:03.680]  combat that's part of the sabotage we're doing right now then we've got tribe
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.200]  who's part of the clip shoot to kill he's saying oh we want to get rid of him
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.920]  but we don't want to go up for something petty that's that's fraudulent we want to
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:15.600]  find something real here it is and if the evidence the Robert Mueller is
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:23.960]  collecting forms a kind of compelling case that a overwhelming bipartisan
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:29.040]  majority of the American people find convincing that this guy is just too
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:35.640]  dangerous to keep in power then we do have the emergency power of impeachment
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:43.160]  available but it will be available only if we don't use it loosely and kind of
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:50.680]  ring the bell every time something looks amiss you can't be the boy who cried
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.800]  wolf and expect to have then he says shoot to kill we'll be right back stay

[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:13.040]  some family that's now out of the military and he was at Fort Sam Houston
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:17.960]  University for an officer's deal and they said this is like 15 years ago
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:21.520]  everybody's gonna start getting chips in the officer corps and then we're gonna
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:25.640]  have volunteers we're gonna get brain chips he told me about it and I didn't
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:29.960]  even say who he was I just said family he got in big trouble and then didn't get
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:33.560]  a promotion over it and said yes I told you that but I'm never talking to you
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:38.240]  again about the military but I mean who cares we didn't get a promotion you told
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:41.320]  me you're in the meeting with like a thousand officers or whatever they're

[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.680]  who programs these things yeah the southern poverty loss center George
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:22:00.320]  Soros and the ADL or and the Atlantic Council are all in Facebook Google and
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:03.160]  Twitter it's in the news today running everything they're already programming it
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:09.400]  so I guess George Soros and I guess Madame Blavatsky and and and Alistair
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:12.360]  Crowleyites I guess they'll decide what you're programmed with because that's
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.920]  who's running stuff now Hollywood's gonna run your brain ship I guess you just
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:22.600]  can't turn it off think about that I should like four segments on the subject
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:30.320]  but it's just insane totally insane and it's really happening I'm sorry the
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:37.120]  doctor doesn't decide what treatment you get the Thomas IBM computer does and

[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:13.680]  appreciate this hey real briefly a number of years ago I was asked to give
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:17.000]  some speeches about economic development and I couldn't believe how it was
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.080]  attacked because apparently I hit a nerve there's basically energy over
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:23.320]  manufacturing but the interesting part was how it was attacked I was back
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:27.160]  multiple times in audits I got audited like four times in a row that's why I
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.720]  started listening to you and it wasn't until that period of time when I figured
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:34.920]  out that oh my god it's really the Republicans trading me out you know it
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:38.560]  anyway I just I love your show and I love how accurate you are I'm happy to
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.520]  speak with you I was former military myself and I I appreciate what you're
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:47.080]  saying about this day I totally agree with you well obviously the old
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:50.360]  Republicans are just the same branch of the Democrats they're globalist with
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.720]  Trump I think we're seeing a real attempt to drain the swamp now and it's
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:58.160]  accelerating and they're panicking but look the veterans are already the
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.880]  target of the globalist because they want automatons they want machines to
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.440]  carry out their bidding not not men and women that they're threatened by who at
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:09.160]  least have courage to fight but what do you make of the IBM eugenics computer
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:15.840]  already in control of the VA well it's not it's not hard for me to believe you
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:20.400]  know it's the same thickness they have everywhere they take control they they
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:25.920]  don't want people thinking but they don't want anybody actually engaged in you
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:30.440]  know in ethics they want to take the thinking process out of a rancher a
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:35.440]  police officer a factory worker a teacher a military officer they want
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:40.000]  everybody to be centrally programmed so no one's in question it is pure evil
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.680]  God bless you Phil we're gonna go to more calls here right now let's talk to
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.160]  Roland in Texas you're on the air thanks for calling Roland
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:54.760]  it's a pleasure to be online with you love your show been that if for years
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:25:03.360]  listening to you real quick briefly so I just opened up a Twitter account added
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:10.000]  everybody on your list as followers from info wars from the top to the bottom
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.160]  after I would say now or when I had time I started to retweet everything that
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:21.240]  y'all were saying and once I retweeted everything I ended up getting a message
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:28.880]  saying that I was blocked I guess for behavior violation I don't know if that
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:32.640]  means anything I felt it was a whistle blow that's bad behavior you tried to
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:36.760]  communicate with people look they have a Chinese social score they celebrated
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:44.000]  today by blocking 11 million flights so I mean that this is the total mark of the
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.160]  beast tracking everything you do and Apple is has moved to China they've
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.360]  given them all the codes to your computers all the codes to the to the
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:54.080]  cloud and they said well of course that's what you do in China they're now
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.760]  tax exempt they're good liberal billionaires they pay no tax and they
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:01.720]  have slave workers at Foxcom laboratories and if anybody criticizes it
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:05.760]  well they can't get a job or eat and they starve to death in that liberal it's
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:10.800]  so liberal but thank God Starbucks gonna let homeless people sleep in the in the
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:14.320]  bathroom that's real freedom and five-year-olds can be taught how to cut
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:18.640]  their genitals off and little girls can be caught out of commit suicide and we
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.840]  can have this anti-female movement of weird devil worshipers that go shoot
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.960]  kids up at schools I mean it's just Satanism it's a mental illness pure
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.560]  evil mark of the beast it's here brain ships in the troops AI computers
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:38.960]  deciding who lives and dies it's insane I agree and I'm the weirdo because I saw
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:43.080]  it coming and I'm freaking out about it because I believe in people and the

[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.360]  Facebook shut up Americans and it just continues on from there I've got a big
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:36.600]  stack of news here about wiping memories in snails I've got a big stack of news
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:44.680]  here dealing with how IBM computers and other AI systems are already in place
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:48.720]  deciding who lives and dies and they're programmed by government the insurance
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:54.600]  companies where if you're politically a patriot veterans have noticed they're
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:57.520]  not given treatment but if you're a globalist you get it well that's the
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:02.880]  Chinese social score that's going global with your healthcare with your ID with
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:07.800]  your digital number India has it Canada's got it it's it's coming in here you
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:11.280]  can't travel you can't get on planes you can't get a job you can't live when
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:14.480]  you go on for healthcare the AI says you don't get healthcare in fact they
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:17.840]  won't even tell you what's wrong with you and notice they're doing it first the
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:21.360]  National Health Service in England in the VA wherever they've got government
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:26.480]  management and its IBM Thomas computer I spent much of the last few hours on
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:31.840]  that it is unbelievable news it is so incredibly important that everybody be
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:36.480]  aware of that and understand it all we're gonna get into this with Dr. Nick
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:41.440]  baggage the 5g all of it with the guy that first exposed it all from the open
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:47.440]  source US Patent Office and University DARPA documents but when Eisenhower said
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:51.280]  beware the military industrial complex before that we should do an intro or
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:56.360]  promo with us we play all the time he said we beware of an a technological
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:03.400]  elite taking control of the country and then he using the military industrial
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:11.280]  complex for total control so that's the huge news here and then we've got other
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:16.120]  big news I'm glad a call are called in about this we'll go to them soon at UM
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:20.120]  commencement Al Gore urges graduates to reclaim the integrity of American
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:24.040]  democracy but the real headline we got to get a story on on this out right now
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:32.360]  I'm gonna strudge he said that the American experiment with the Trump
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:37.520]  administration should like some scientific ventures be terminated early
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:43.040]  for ethical reasons so he's saying abort the president is what that statement
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:46.000]  is so I wanted to spend a few minutes in this this segment and get into all the
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.600]  technical stuff for the rest of the broadcast with Nick baggage in your
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:51.880]  calls because his dad was a famous congressman that died very mysteriously
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:55.800]  in a plane crash for fighting the system and then his brother is also been a US
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:01.080]  senator but but everybody knows Nick baggage for being a scientist I'm gonna
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:03.240]  go through all his degrees in his background and all his best-selling
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:08.000]  books exposing atmospheric manipulation harp and the thousands of patents he
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.360]  says Alex don't worry about the chemicals in the water that's bad enough
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:15.560]  it's the electromagnetic manipulation and now it's being admitted so this is
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:20.280]  being deployed against us so he joins us now but I wanted to ask him first as a
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:26.080]  smart political brain what he makes of Trump his report card I think he's
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:30.520]  starting to break the back so far of the swamp beginning to drain it as all the
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:35.720]  revelations of illegal spying come out I still think we're not out of the woods
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:41.520]  but I think that people need to stay the course because I I really see signs
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:46.000]  that Trump is strengthening and the globalist and their whole plan are
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.120]  weakening and the humanity might have some hope not just through Trump but
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:54.120]  through all the nationalist and populace in your work understanding there's a
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:59.680]  breakaway civilization there's a technocracy there is a system that is
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:02.480]  breaking away from us and it doesn't want us to be involved in it but if we're
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:07.680]  involved in it and just study it then we can take control of it for the betterment
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.080]  of humanity just like they didn't want global government being debated they
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.280]  would say just five years ago didn't exist still when you and I covered it and
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:16.600]  you know you would be on with Art Bell or George Norring we get attacked for it
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:22.360]  but now it's all out in the open so I see that we've made giant leaps from where
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:25.400]  we were and even though it seems like things are really bad now if you look at
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:29.320]  how far we've come I think we've come far enough in the awakening process that
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:34.160]  if we just keep pushing it's gonna get easier and easier and easier as we go I
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:38.200]  think we've reached the top of the hill if humanity recognizes the chance and
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:43.760]  grabs at it what do you say dr. Nick baggage of earth I think it's true you
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:49.600]  know the fact the matter is you know if the public now recognizes the power
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:54.720]  that they actually have in this equation for making change for doing it
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:00.840]  differently we have that opportunity right now I mean over 25 years ago I
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:04.480]  started talking about this stuff and sort of where the trends were headed and
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:10.320]  and we are there unfortunately we're like at five minutes to midnight once
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:16.520]  again which seems to be always the case in American politics we always wait
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:21.120]  sort of to last minute now when I when I look at sort of the conditioning and
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:26.480]  what's happening you mentioned the social scoring that China is now doing
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.720]  that really is part of the the whole system right now across the globe when
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.560]  you look at what China is doing and then you look at their next-door neighbor
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:39.160]  India in terms of facial recognition fingerprints I mean all of the
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:43.560]  biometrics that are being instituted now just to get plugged into their banking
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:49.760]  system and into their system of social services voting etc. you know and they
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:53.720]  and they've done most of it I mean I think it's 1.1 billion people already and
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:40:01.160]  more more to come the whole shift is more towards the elite in fact I have
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:06.120]  this a conversation often with a lot of people I don't think Trump is part of
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:10.400]  that elite I think all of us know that and there's a lot of people would like
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:16.440]  to see him go but look at the scorecard lowest unemployment highest stock
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:21.800]  market people are coming to the tables talking talking to America again the
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:27.520]  trade agreements are out and being revitalized in America's interest and
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:32.000]  I think the approach is certainly radically different than the past and
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.520]  radically different is what America needed and what American citizens voted
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:41.920]  for and we have it and let's see what happens in terms of the control aspect
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.680]  social media has been in the news it was engineered from the very beginning to
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:50.880]  have one purpose and that is to move public opinion and control the culture
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:56.160]  I mean when you look at media across the board people say oh it doesn't have such
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:01.680]  an effect yes it does it is like it's a scandal when Trump and people do some
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:06.000]  public scraping just to reach out to folks when that's like first-grade math
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.720]  compared to quantum mechanics with what Facebook and and and the Democrats have
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:14.160]  been openly doing it's such a joke when they go we didn't know there was social
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:18.800]  engineering gee how evil they they contacted people on Facebook that were
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:23.960]  public databases how terrible we need to control this which means putting
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:28.040]  everybody that's a libertarian a conservative you name it a pro human
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:32.480]  person into an electronic gulag right and you look at you know you're talking
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:38.840]  about putting spies in someone's campaign this is exactly what was happening
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:47.040]  in the 1960s and early 70s here in the US under the Hoover FBI who was black
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:52.680]  mailing half the Congress you know really pushing a lot from that dark side of
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:59.280]  government and it was Hale Boggs strongly opposing him up until the point
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:03.120]  which he was finally out of there out of the FBI but the institution still had
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:09.400]  the same rot the same structure the same internal you know sort of culture that
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:13.560]  it evolved under Hoover that did not change I don't think it's changed today
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:18.240]  the idea that it's a political arm think about this we hear all this saber
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:22.360]  saber rattling about for instance intellectual property rights in China
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:26.520]  as an example but you know right here in the US they don't defend our
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:30.560]  intellectual property rights whatsoever they tell us to go to civil court
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:37.040]  unless your Lucas films or Microsoft or someone like this who's paying the money
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:41.880]  to run the government and to do the trade-offs they get the laws enforced
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:46.720]  selectively for them this is the nature of the 21st century it is for the
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:51.200]  elites it's no longer for you and I and that's what's changed dramatic that's

[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:43.000]  attention but a caller called in and pointed it out to us when we go into
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.520]  Josh in a minute we've got Dr. Nick Baggacher with us this is insane at a
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:52.480]  college commencement we'll put the article on screen please at a college
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:57.220]  commencement at UM commencement Al Gore urges graduates to reclaim the
[01:47:57.220 --> 01:48:03.200]  integrity of American democracy no that's not the headline he says when
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:07.200]  asked about Trump we need to exterminate him for ethical reasons we're gonna play
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:15.280]  the clip one of the questioners student says is it Trump like chemotherapy to
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:20.000]  kill the cancer of the swamp or whatever he goes no it's like something you do
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:25.120]  abort so this is next level you got this other professor we played earlier
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:30.120]  saying that we need to shoot to kill on the president he had another reporter a
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:34.280]  few days ago put crosshairs on him and then removed it this is the call to
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:40.240]  violence we continue to see so here is Al Gore the man that claimed he invented
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:47.840]  the internet decades after it was actually invented the man that said
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:54.000]  that the oceans would have already flooded New York by 2013 here is Al Gore
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:00.080]  making his really not veiled threat to abort the president here it is as one
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:06.960]  of his supporters put it on television he said the way I look at it Donald
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:15.560]  Trump is chemotherapy for America well in medicine and in science some
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:20.400]  experiments are terminated early for ethical reasons
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:43.320]  look at the politically correct cult they created I don't know that that will
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:50.800]  be the case and I do not predict it but I do know that whether you are a
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:56.200]  Republican or a Democrat or an independent the salvation of our
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:00.920]  democracy for those who support Trump or oppose Trump or those who want other
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:07.680]  candidates or not the salvation of our democracy is with the American people
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:16.720]  and most especially with your generation now we're going to have Dr. Nick
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:19.080]  baggage with us throughout the entire next hour we're going to get
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:25.400]  specifically into the high-tech grid the geoengineering the 5g the admissions
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:30.800]  it's causing massive cancer and the big in game of this whole thing so he'll be
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:35.440]  with us we're taking your calls right now and Dr. Nick Davis is riding shotgun
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:38.920]  with us we're about to go to Josh who pointed this out to us this is a
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:44.200]  sickening statement to the response of someone saying again well Trump's like
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:48.760]  chemotherapy I still think it's a bad analogy more like vitamin C and you see
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:52.600]  things turning around as you said earlier under Trump and then the vitriol
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:55.760]  from the deep state as they get outed for all the crimes they've committed and
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:59.400]  all the illegal things they've done they are really going into panic mode and I
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:03.280]  can tell you this dr. baggage from talking to the president quite a few
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:08.480]  times and no one will know him really really well he's not a fake when he
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:13.200]  likes churches and likes Christians but he says it like this I really like the
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:19.520]  energy it really feels good I like black churches I like I like you know
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:23.080]  evangelical churches I like people laying their hands on me I can feel it
[01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:27.240]  and so he likes energy I mean I don't want to be new age you about it but the
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:31.600]  president is pro-life and then he's not he doesn't want stagnation he doesn't
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:35.120]  want us to not produce and move forward he said in his inaugural speech I want
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:38.640]  to unlock the secret to the universe I want to turn humanity loose he said a
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:44.040]  few weeks ago I want planetary victory for humanity come out North Korea this
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:47.680]  the globalist claim they want this big one world of love but they're creating
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:52.920]  one world of discord and evil Trump is the anti-new-world order guy in that
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:56.680]  he's just pragmatic and likes nice things and he doesn't feel good when
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:52:00.880]  people are poor and under him that makes him feel bad because I've studied Trump
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:04.240]  now I understand what makes him tick so he's the anti-austerity president
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:09.240]  doesn't mean he's perfect no and he's a throwback in some ways but he is pro
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:13.800]  human and I think that's why they hate him dr. baggage well I think that's part
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:17.960]  of it and the fact that you know whether you like Donald Trump or not he ran
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:22.480]  authentically this is the difference and I said this to a lot of people is
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:27.600]  what America wanted was authenticity and yeah I mean in terms of character
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:34.080]  issues and all of that yeah we get it but at the same time we have a guy that
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:39.440]  is radically different and I think we needed it I think America needed a shock
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:46.680]  and Donald Trump is that shock and I think what he's done is reawaken in
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:51.160]  Americans an interest in participating on both sides and now this is the
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:55.960]  challenge for this generation it's not the challenge to participate it's the
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:53:01.080]  challenge to do it in the spirit of the founding fathers which is to have that
[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:06.680]  lively debate to have that focus debate that raises the temperature in the
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:12.440]  country but the level of hate coming from the left and segments of the right
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:16.720]  is fundamentally wrong and we need to recognize the respect our founding
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:22.640]  fathers had for divergent of opinions to the point of making it such a
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:27.200]  foundational part of the country because we ought to be able to look at each
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:32.320]  other not in a tolerant way because I consider tolerance that concept actually
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:36.920]  a violent act and let me explain that for a second violent to yourself because
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:42.040]  you withhold your own truth to be politically correct now what I believe
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:47.840]  is something a little bit different I think we should embrace the idea that
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:54.080]  we may find our opponent in the conversations ideas are repugnant but
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:58.560]  we should embrace their right to have them and express them and we should
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:03.400]  listen and be respected and that's a classical liberal idea that built the
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:07.320]  country not the modern authoritarian liberal but when you have the big
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:12.200]  corporations the big foreign banks the communist Chinese at Davis saying will
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:15.440]  crush America the head of Twitter saying will crush conservatives which means
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:18.240]  anybody they disagree with I know you'll consider yourself a conservative I
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:21.320]  consider myself just a common sense pro-human renaissance person as you do
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:24.520]  as well we've got we're friends we've been out to dinner many times you know
[01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:28.360]  over the last 20 years we've known each other and so we're on that real page
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:33.880]  there the globalist or anti renaissance and I think they realize that that
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:38.840]  Trump is a pro renaissance guy even in his own kind of strong man vain and
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:43.080]  that's why I think at an energetic level his energy is so different from
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:47.440]  theirs that's why they're so horrified they are and you know I just went to my
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:52.440]  mom's 80th birthday this last weekend in Anchorage with a whole variety of
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:58.320]  people from Republicans Democrats libertarians independence and my family
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:03.880]  has lively discussion believe me and here's the thing we we have these
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:06.880]  discussions with my brothers and sisters looking each other in the eye
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:14.320]  lively emotional charge but we are respectful and when we leave we embrace
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:19.560]  each other as brothers and sisters the way this nation should recognizing our
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:23.840]  differences recognizing that the context no I totally agree what I'm saying is
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:27.640]  this whole constellation of corporate power and universities trying to break
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:31.200]  the back of free speech worldwide I think it's going to backfire what do you
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:35.720]  think I think so too in fact I would say even more than that it's an
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:40.200]  opportunity right now to begin to take it back what they sliced away from us
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:45.000]  one bite at a time is time to get it back and think about the internet right
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:50.280]  now and what's happening there the idea of using the data against you to
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.920]  manipulate you which is what is exactly happening by government and
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:56:00.560]  corporations this data belongs to us this is our digital doorway this is the
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:05.120]  digital doorway into our homes in the 21st century if our founding fathers
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:10.400]  were here today they'd be fighting for protection of that the new the new
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:16.000]  elites kicking in our doorways kicking in our digital and I know you've advised
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.200]  the EU on this they've even passed laws which I think you're good overall but I
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:22.280]  see them being selectively enforced against small companies not big ones
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:25.840]  but these new EU laws I know you advise the parliament many times are coming in
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:30.160]  telling big data that if we demand our data be destroyed or not use that to do
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:33.480]  it but I don't see Google Facebook or Twitter I mean we're already complying
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.800]  with the EU rules here I don't I don't usually apply with stuff but I'm
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:40.360]  complying with them because I think they're right but and I know you advised
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:46.480]  them on that I yeah indeed we did and this is this is almost 16 years ago now
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:50.960]  I tell you something else on this is I think it shouldn't be a situation if we
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:56.080]  opt in or opt out I think it should be illegal for them to do it no I agree
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:00.720]  because they built a very architecture where the internet spies period yeah I
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:04.840]  mean where they just have no permission that they can get from us they
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:08.840]  explained something I've had all these top engineers and hackers on the way
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:12.960]  they built the web made it have Swiss cheese and not be not be secure I've
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:16.280]  had William Benny former head of the NSA you name it on they built the damn
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:20.080]  thing to be spied on which makes it not work right it should be built to be
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:25.240]  secure and privacy based that that's exactly right which means we have to
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:30.400]  change it fundamentally structurally from the ground up to not be a marketing
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:35.120]  and manipulation tool but to truly be the international life by the way they've
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:37.680]  had Sean Parker a Facebook and all of them come out and say word for what you
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:41.840]  said it's manipulate dopamine that these things are mind control engines we'll be
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:46.000]  back with Nick Beggars in your calls stay with us
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:50.560]  we've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:55.600]  own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:59.600]  us your mother nature to detoxify the body that's why I'm introducing Z shield
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:05.120]  toxic metal and chemical defense support it's made in the USA it's filled with
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:09.240]  known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:13.880]  the body and it supports the info or it is a classical 360 when this is the
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:17.600]  formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:22.040]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:25.760]  possibly get you want to yourself you want to your family and you owe it to the
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:30.160]  future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:35.440]  and as focused as you can be because we need you the remnant of America to
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:39.160]  reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:42.560]  you can be thanks to your support and your prayers together we're changing the
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:45.960]  world now it's time to change our bodies with z-shield and in full wars life
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:52.360]  comm Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:57.840]  censorship is sending down over the UK they're set to pass rules not a law
[01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:03.920]  that if you criticize Islam or Gage you'll get six months in prison we know
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:08.120]  we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK CNN and many
[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:12.240]  others are calling for info wars to be shut down taken off the web Slate
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:16.600]  magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship brainwash
[01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:20.960]  young people against info wars psychologically inoculate them with
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:25.960]  lies so they don't actually have to say we are the most hated news source in
[01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:29.960]  the world by globalist it is so critical that you go to info wars.com
[01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:34.440]  or slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact
[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:39.320]  with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:44.200]  engage in free open dialogue as a society that is critical to this fight we
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:52.480]  will prevail if you take action and I know you will you're listening to the
[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:55.800]  alex jones show
[02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:09.040]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:15.800]  to you live from the front lines of the info war listen I love God I'm a Christian
[02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:18.760]  but I don't like the fake mainline churches where they interpreted all
[02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:22.360]  when pastor Rodney Howard Brown was here the other day I could just feel the
[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:25.360]  spirit was so strong I had tears in my eyes for like 30 minutes after the show
[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:28.360]  with him when he prayed with me and it's the same with baggage I could feel his
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:32.560]  energy it's the spirit and and it's we only see a very limited spectrum of
[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:35.120]  what is that's been proven scientifically now and there's and that's
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:38.800]  just this dimension there's dimensions above and below and I and I'm telling you
[02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:43.240]  the more we go with our gut which is connected to our brain and connected to
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:47.880]  all of our senses it's way more powerful in our conscious mind it knows and
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:51.480]  that's why I knew instinctively Trump was good I knew instinctively he would
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:55.360]  win I knew in students I always used to ignore my gut the more I follow my gut
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:58.720]  and of course you get into that with with earth pulse your book the film all
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:02.080]  of it we carry those info or store.com get them an earth pulse.com but
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:07.120]  whatever you call this they got all these fake new age cults and fake Christian
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:11.720]  groups trying to hijack people that are already looking for God and they try to
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:14.880]  misdirect it all dr. baggage will take calls the next segment this one short
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:19.300]  but I'm telling you the revolution of the soul and the body and the mind and
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:23.000]  humans next level they have their fake counterfeit the real things coming we
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.000]  see it and that's what the globalists are trying to block so desperately I
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:29.920]  know you trailblaze that can you speak to it right absolutely you know this is
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:34.760]  my base perception of what we are we're created in the image and likeness of God
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:40.720]  that we mean really means that we need to remember what we are and what our
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:45.120]  latent capacities are and and I don't think it's a case of evolving to
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:48.400]  anything we're already there no no man I agree we're already there but we're
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:53.840]  about to learn we're there yes and this is the exciting part the thing that gets
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:59.400]  in the way of it is anxiety and fear it stops you from reaching I mean this is
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:04.920]  biological it's it's biophysics it's the way it works when you look at the human
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:09.840]  body when you look at the human brain in terms of what it's doing in real time
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:15.480]  against say the media or say social media Facebook as an example just before
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:19.400]  the break you're talking about the dopamine release that comes from each
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:27.120]  little charge it was designed to make it addictive and it worked 50 minutes a day
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:32.600]  two billion people across the planet spending one work shift a week doing
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:39.160]  social media which is neither social nor legitimate media will fit in it is a
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:44.440]  diversion from your humanity it is the electronic priests put between you and
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:48.840]  the divinity that exists in another human being this is what they're
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:52.720]  attacking this is what they're done just like they're attacking the relationship
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:56.240]  of men and women how satanic is it at produce they don't say mother or father
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:03:00.440]  and oh it's liberal no more families that trying to get between humans and
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:06.760]  and our interface is is the most evil thing it is in fact you know the the
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:15.080]  union between two people a marriage the union represents the dissolving of the
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:21.920]  duality and the joining of one in an example of God yet on earth that's what
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:26.880]  it's about it's about coming to play though even knew that and he's you know
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:30.720]  top globalist this day but he was writing manuals to them for control that's
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:34.400]  what they're trying to keep that power duo from coming together dividing men and
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:39.120]  women that's it you know when when men and women come together it fundamentally
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:45.120]  read in every ancient work this is fundamental it's the recognition when
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:51.920]  you look across the globe and it's absolute total power it is and this is
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:56.120]  the difference if we can remember and we can remember the divinity in another
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:04:02.160]  then we can tone the conversation down and be much more effective it's in that
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:07.920]  voice that we can come into a discussion into a debate that elevates that lifts
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:14.520]  us as a population this idea of division is a globalist concept to divide and
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:18.000]  calm I agree we come back I want to ask you about that I'm gonna cause Kanye how
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:23.080]  big is that I mean I agree with Scott Adams it's like a you know hydrogen bomb
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:26.400]  of truth going off and I want to then explain to me as I really respect you
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:29.000]  people think I'm angry and it's fear-based it's not I'm kind of like
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.520]  wake up wake up things are happening I've been very successful but I do see it
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:35.880]  with some take it as fear it's the opposite I have so much energy and
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:40.040]  wanting to go after them that that I see it as very positive but but it can come
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:44.040]  off as the other so I want your nuance understanding Dr. Baggis to explain from

[02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:04.640]  we are drugged out we are following other people's opinions we are controlled
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:11.440]  by the media today it all changes this reality has been forced upon us it is a
[02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:15.640]  choice just like when I said slavery is a choice Einstein says the depth of
[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:19.200]  insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result so we
[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:22.840]  keep on saying I hate you I hate you fuck you fuck you how are we gonna get a
[02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:27.880]  different result out of hate why don't we just try love why don't we just try
[02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:33.720]  love we have the resources for a peaceful world you know sometimes you need
[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:38.440]  some crazy mother fuckers to change something Steve Jobs is crazy now we
[02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:42.560]  all know Steve Jobs phones they say truck spray they say I'm crazy but I'm here
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:48.880]  to show love it's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:07:05.640]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:14.560]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:20.440]  lines of the info war so I'm a very positive person because this
[02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:22.960]  philosophy is key because they try to misrepresent the media when I stand
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:27.720]  forth they take little steps of what I am really aggressive and upset as the
[02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:32.920]  sum total of what we do but I found that people are in a trance in fact
[02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:36.080]  medically they are with the TVs and the rest of it and sometimes my grating voice
[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:41.680]  when it's in that mode not on purpose I just go into that wakes people up it
[02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:45.720]  gets them out of their comfort zone whereas in PR does it all very
[02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:50.640]  trans like every one of their guests everyone in LP the cadence trust us
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:55.320]  we're the experts it's all calm do this but I find Dr. Nick baggages in the
[02:07:55.320 --> 02:08:01.040]  middle of the road he's positive he's a professor you name it and he's laying
[02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:06.960]  it out lovingly and it's kind of in between the two of an NPR of her voice
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:11.040]  versus Alex Jones so he was kind of saying we should be respectful to people
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:15.120]  when we try to reach out to them and try to talk to them well I agree and a lot
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:18.720]  of times I am disarming with somebody that gets in my face but sometimes I'll
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:22.920]  also tell them wake up you know get out of your trance you're an idiot it's time
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:26.040]  for you understand you know that you've been manipulated so there's a time and
[02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:30.440]  place for everything I don't calculate anything I do I mean it's all just you
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:34.200]  know done either as a moronic thing or idiot savant however you want to see it
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:39.120]  but you can't argue with the results of what we've gotten so I think it takes
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:43.880]  all kinds but definitely trying to not get in a fight mode with somebody that
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:46.800]  disagrees with you is obviously the way to go because they're never going to
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:49.720]  listen to you if you don't get out of it but at the same time I think it's all
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:53.240]  about times and places we're gonna go to some calls right now but that's a
[02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:57.760]  nuanced issue but clearly what you're doing versus what NPR is doing versus
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:03.520]  what I'm doing how would you quantify those with a gestalt see I I look at it
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:06.880]  this way I work with a lot of different people and a lot of different hosts over
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:10.200]  the years who are my friends and they represent every kind of political
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:15.080]  persuasion but what I what I love about everyone I work with is they come right
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:20.280]  out of the center of who they are and when Alex Jones has something to say it
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:24.760]  comes out of right the center of who you are it's not filtered it's not scripted
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:29.000]  there's no teleprompters there's none of this nonsense it comes right out of the
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.560]  core of you so you're saying the key is just like what Trump just just like
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:37.160]  Jerry Kushner said we want genuineness we want from the core we want unfilter we
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:42.720]  want real right and and the balance in that you know this is a I've always I
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:46.640]  always have enjoyed over the last 20 years working with you because when we
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:51.200]  go on the air we have this different style but it really compliments the
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:56.200]  message that we're trying to get out there which is put your energy in this
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:10:00.560]  life and do something you can function in two worlds at once you can function in
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:05.160]  this physical world and the spiritual aspects of who you are at the same time
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:10.320]  the difference is let that spiritual aspect of who you are start to push into
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:14.480]  this world a little differently and then the world changes and what I let me ask
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:16.720]  you that question is you're gonna have the floor in the next three segments I'm
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:19.520]  gonna let you host so I want you to go over all the real serious stuff that
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:22.040]  we're facing you're covering positive stuff and I promise to go to calls but
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:25.840]  let me throw this out at you I look at servants of the globalist and the
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:29.480]  people that are into the system who turn their will over and you know it's
[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:33.000]  spiritual because it's like they're dead suddenly I've known people that have
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:37.880]  sold out and then a year later they're like zombies so people think fighting
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:43.240]  for what's right is is enslaving and work it's yeah it's addicting you just
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:47.160]  get more discernment more understanding I mean I don't want to brag you know how
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:51.200]  it is yourself all your connections I mean the whole world just opens up and
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:55.840]  it's like my god I'm a super person compared to what I was 20 years ago and
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:59.400]  I can't imagine what it's gonna be like in 20 years I can barely handle the
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:03.160]  amount of understanding I've got now because here's the thing doctor 90% of
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:08.440]  time man I'm dead on and I know stuff for other people do it's crazy and I
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:11.880]  want to share this knowledge the globalists are like a fallen form of
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:15.480]  what we're doing where they have some advanced knowledge but they try to hoard
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:18.760]  it and they're obsessed with other people getting it whereas you and I want
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:22.640]  to just spread it and this again you know I think this is what the world
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:27.360]  needs right now that's one of the things I really hope that Trump continues to
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:31.200]  crack open the secrecy syndrome of the United States that's worked against the
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:34.640]  American people I'm not talking about the national security issue that are
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:40.720]  legitimate but under that guys has been hidden the entire efforts on the mind
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:46.320]  control issues the the idea of manipulation the idea of hiding the
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:50.560]  truth nature of our political processes and it hasn't mattered which
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:54.680]  administration's been in control in the past Republicans and Democrats alike I
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:12:00.000]  mean think about the Southeast Asian policies revealed in the Pentagon papers
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:05.080]  in the early 70s again when my dad was in the Congress what was happening then
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:10.760]  was a revelation that it's a rigged system the national parties and on both
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:15.360]  levels rigged it what happened in the last election the Republican Party put
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:20.640]  up their 16 best their best elite establishment candidates and Donald
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:25.400]  Trump beat them all and beat the best Democrats to generate because it was
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:29.640]  about authenticity once again you may not like certain character aspects but
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:34.560]  there's no surprises and I can say this whatever his character flaws were most
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:40.360]  of it has to do with his wife and him not the public he's wild to that's their
[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:45.840]  business man yep but I can say this about Donald Trump so far we haven't
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:49.720]  heard about anything going on with interns in the Oval Office and I'm glad
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:53.200]  to know that and I don't think we're gonna hear anything like that because I
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:56.920]  don't believe that's the nature of what he's doing the presidency I think he's
[02:12:56.920 --> 02:13:00.400]  there to shake the you know here's I know people that know him well he's a
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:04.960]  hundred percent at work at work and then what he does in his own private time
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:09.080]  reportedly that's not even going on now I don't think he has private time as
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:12.200]  president of the United States because I know what public service requires and
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:19.040]  I've seen it in my my entire life true public servants give up everything to
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:23.400]  serve everything their personal privacy but we're not bragging ourselves but
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:27.360]  take my Matt drudge or you or I or anybody we are serving for our families
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:30.600]  everybody this is real service here folks because we tell you and it's
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:35.040]  expensive in terms of what you undertake I mean you and I both know it I mean
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:39.640]  you're beat up constantly you go through this gyration every couple years when
[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:44.200]  they when you rise up on some issue they want to hammer you down and this is the
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:50.200]  nature of it but what we get up every day and we carry on because fundamentally
[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:54.560]  we believe that this thing is changing it's changing right now as people engage
[02:13:54.560 --> 02:14:00.400]  the process and change change the process because that's the opportunity that
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:04.760]  presents this generation will either be free or slaves and our generation decides
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:11.400]  and the millennials coming up have been programmed literally programmed by
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:16.760]  media with the intention to move this culture a different direction I travel
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:21.560]  all over the world and there's a cultural overlay in every single country I go
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:26.560]  to by the same elite players that are playing it out in the United States it's
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:31.480]  no different around the world I promise to go to Josh and a few other callers

[02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:42.960]  grids all of it is now out in the news I've got the most insane stuff where
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:48.080]  word-for-word what he predicted 20 years ago has now come true it's incredible
[02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:49.920]  we're gonna get to that in a moment I promise to take a few of these calls
[02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:55.120]  let's go ahead and talk to Josh in Oregon who called in to tell us about the
[02:20:55.120 --> 02:21:00.520]  bizarre Al Gore statement about a boarding president trump go ahead yeah
[02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:05.040]  so I heard this statement the other day and I just I thought it was one of the
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:08.360]  most insane things that I've ever heard I mean you can imagine if a statement
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:12.200]  like that if you know it's being made by Newt Ginnrich for example about Hillary
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:15.880]  Clinton when she was president or something along those lines it's just
[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:20.200]  it wouldn't you know you wouldn't be able to get away with it and it just it
[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:23.640]  shows the insanity of these criminals I mean you've got you know you've got
[02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:27.480]  people like Brennan who's coming out and threatening Mitch McConnell and Paul
[02:21:27.480 --> 02:21:31.400]  Ryan swamp racks themselves so you really seem fun to turn on each other
[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:34.600]  which I forgot to cover that Brennan comes out he can't threaten the
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:38.560]  president doesn't work tell him shut your mouth now he's threatening them and
[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:44.240]  with what oh yeah yeah oh I know exactly I mean you know this is a guy who you
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:48.320]  know voted for that Communist Party in the 70s and it's just insane you know
[02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:51.240]  you got Loretta Lynch who came out and said that we need to have blood in the
[02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:55.800]  streets Andy McCabe said he's gonna burn down the whole FBI you know you got
[02:21:55.800 --> 02:21:59.920]  clapper coming out and you've got the former deputy director of the CIA and
[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:03.440]  then the FBI brought her by Mueller because Mueller's really CIA confirm that
[02:22:03.440 --> 02:22:09.520]  with high-level CIA who were worked with them and they brought them over and
[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:14.480]  they've got mud on TV saying we're gonna kill Trump these are excellent points
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:20.560]  you're making Josh God bless you what do you make of this Dr. Begich before I
[02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:23.840]  think it was bravada I think they're really scared right now and so I think
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:27.120]  we're at a point of maximum danger with the deep state and you're really well
[02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:30.880]  studied research you know obviously you believe in a lot of folks believe your
[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:34.080]  father's plane was brought down as a US congressman your brother's been a
[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:37.520]  senator you've been on the inside of a lot of big things advised world leaders
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:42.600]  at a gut level what do you think of the deep state and their their their their
[02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:48.440]  threats of violence intensifying there is a panic party going on and they are
[02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:53.080]  worried and they're worried about all of it unraveling and this guy as
[02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:58.640]  president they just don't have the control they did they didn't spend 50
[02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:05.240]  years building his career in politics he came in as an insider outsider as a
[02:23:05.240 --> 02:23:09.520]  as a renegade actually and we get that and we don't care if you went out with a
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:13.640]  porn star exactly we didn't hire him for that we hired him as a wrecking bolt
[02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:18.920]  that's exactly it and I think that's what the American people wanted and if you
[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:22.840]  stop and think about it for a minute even on the Democratic side you know if
[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:27.280]  Hillary hadn't rigged the thing and they did rig the thing at the national level
[02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:31.120]  and the evidence has shown that Bernie probably would have beaten Trump he
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:37.760]  probably would have because once again people wanted radical change and they
[02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:42.120]  didn't care what it looked like how people screamed about they just want to
[02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:46.080]  know they weren't part of the existing power structure that has worked against
[02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:48.840]  us and all around the country I don't care whether you're a liberal
[02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:55.200]  conservative or an independent you have this sense of dis ease of discomfort of
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:24:01.800]  just something about to happen because it is it is it's five minutes to midnight
[02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:07.760]  and here's here's the big dimension of it mind control as a concept is so
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:13.120]  clearly administered in the simplest of forms right now and it's been done
[02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:17.960]  through programming through television through media for decades now what has
[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:23.360]  changed is you can actually monitor in real time what goes on in a human brain
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:27.600]  when you're broadcasting or when you're sending specific signals and this is what
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:33.800]  has happened is so an entire evolution in the technology has happened where you
[02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:40.520]  get what's called a frequency following response FFR is taught in every masters
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:45.760]  level institution that teaches psychology and what it says is external
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:51.800]  signals can influence the internal activity in the brain and cause your
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:56.840]  emotional state to be shifted this is the simplest thing the simplest aspect of
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:00.760]  it well over 20 years old the things that you're reading about today's paper
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:06.280]  about implants this was pioneered years and years ago and people forget that
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:12.240]  over 200 people in the AG's office in Mexico were implanted years and years
[02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:16.480]  ago and people said oh it's to stop corruption no it was to maintain control
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:22.400]  over those who were corrupted the idea of control is really what it's about and
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:28.080]  the and the closer and the more that you see that instituted it is the signal to
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:34.280]  the elites that this is coming because ideally it's a game of bankers it always
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:40.040]  has been go back to the very beginning of banking in Sumeria and it was a king
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:46.200]  issuing little fiat forms of currency and you pay the interest back in silver
[02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:51.000]  then it came into the Middle Ages we had that banking system of all fractional
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.960]  lending and let's be clear under feudalism whether it was ancient Japan
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:58.560]  ancient China, ancient Africa, ancient England, ancient France, ancient you know
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:03.280]  Austrian-Hungarian areas of the Visigoths and Ostragoths you had to have
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:07.120]  the tally sticks or the shells or the coins or you'd be killed if you were
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:12.400]  trading rabbits or trading there was no barter allowed under feudalism you
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:15.080]  always heard about oh you're hunting the you know the king's deer or whatever if
[02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:20.600]  you caught fish and didn't do some tax you were killed so they always lost after
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:25.080]  this total control system and the China celebrating their new social credit
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:29.680]  score barring people from flying or working or living who don't act exactly
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:33.240]  like they want the left is saying let's adopt this here to control
[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:36.880]  conservatives don't they get that once the things in place they can always
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:41.040]  change the rules however they want for total control right and you're
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:45.240]  familiar and I know we've discussed it before you know this is a big New
[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:49.760]  Brzezinski's book between two ages which also laid this all out as an insider
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:55.040]  you look at what he laid out in the early 70s and it is happening right now
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:00.480]  two ages the technotronic era he said it all right and I know my dad when I was
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:04.240]  like 12 he said you don't know how stuff works son you think none dare call
[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:07.080]  conspiracies powerful he goes read this this is from one of their main
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:11.120]  architects and it he admitted that the government brings in the drugs to control
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:15.080]  it the child porn they control the mind control they're gonna have a computer
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:18.640]  technology to control us and their argument is oh we control the child porn
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:22.120]  so it doesn't get out of hand as if anybody even wants that crap it's the
[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:27.400]  government and and the UN pushing Nambla sorry I mean I mean I'm ranting it's
[02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:32.400]  just Brzezinski was so damn evil well and here's the thing you know when you
[02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:35.920]  look at what was constructed from his frame of thought the trilateral
[02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:40.120]  commission foreign affairs journal I actually read it every every time it
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:45.120]  comes out I'm on a subscription list because I want to know what the elites
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:50.400]  plan is and where they're headed I read a lot of publications that are out of
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:55.400]  areas that I consider like my area because I want to know I want to know
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:59.080]  what's being planned how it's being looked at and how our lives are being
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:03.560]  constructed around us we need to change the way we see the world for the world
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:07.880]  to change we need to see it more accurately the mainstream is no longer a
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:14.280]  media outlet fake news what a propaganda game it is the fake news it's all
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:19.320]  editorial it is not information anymore that allows us to discern within a
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:23.880]  democratic republic what ought to shape our government it's done the opposite
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:27.920]  turn freedom of the press was about an informed public so we could maintain
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:32.880]  control of this republic and instead we've got a propaganda machine operator
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:39.120]  right stay there this is such an epic moment to be alive because

[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:47.920]  stuff you know more than we do but your neighbors your friends your family don't
[02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:52.600]  so get the film watch it don't into the local library or go ahead on access TV

[02:34:56.320 --> 02:35:00.240]  sharing it with one person don't underestimate the power of that get his
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:04.440]  book at the film Earth Pulse also about what's happening his prediction of this
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:08.480]  big awakening what happened he said this about 10-12 years ago right at this
[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:13.400]  time Beige is a smart guy so let's let him get into the the globalist first all
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:17.680]  say they want to merge with silicon they believe humanity's ugly and done they
[02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:21.280]  believe they're gods controlling our evolution as you said we've all we're
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:24.880]  already here if anything we're going backwards now in their attempt to
[02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:28.840]  suppress us so quantify who the good guys are the bad guys are we ever talk
[02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:32.880]  about who are the spiders behind these minions they want to sell out humanity
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:36.760]  these narcissistic psychopathic control freaks and then let's hit some of the
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:40.480]  main points here of just it's all admitted they're putting brain chips in
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:44.920]  troops world governments here can't buy or sell if you're not a good globalist
[02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:50.800]  robot cars killing people all over Al Gore saying exterminate a mainstream news
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:55.520]  think cell towers to manipulate your brain I mean this is just it's it's all
[02:35:55.520 --> 02:35:59.240]  here and instead of people going oh Nick baggage and Alex Jones were right it's
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:03.680]  like they're even worse screw them it's just quite a paradigm dr. baggage go
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:08.600]  ahead you're right and that's exactly it and you know when you think about the
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:13.720]  things a mainstream is now reporting I go if you go back to a really important
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:19.080]  article was 1998 now 20 years old and it was called the mind has no firewalls and
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:24.840]  it was reprint from an article that was originally in a Russian journal called
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:28.920]  Orienteer military journal and what it talked about and and was later
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:33.120]  absolutely supported in mainstream reports within the United States and
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:39.120]  academic studies was the idea that any electromagnetic carrier any system that
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:45.760]  can carry a signal can carry a sub signal a signal on it that allows you to
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:50.200]  manipulate the behavior of people within contact of that signal now what can be
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:57.160]  used is the internet telephone radio networks power grids any of the things
[02:36:57.160 --> 02:37:02.280]  that essentially carry a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that you can
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:07.360]  manipulate and so this is essentially what has happened now the idea of being
[02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:11.960]  able to have a more targeted effect rather than affecting general populations
[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:18.640]  this is possible using cell phone systems that then are actually tagging a
[02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:24.200]  specific individual who can be linked into that system so when you think of
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:28.600]  surveillance don't just think about the idea of looking at what you're doing but
[02:37:28.600 --> 02:37:33.680]  also beginning now and has been for some time influencing what you're doing now
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:37.800]  when you look in real time at brain activity for instance in the gaming
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:42.120]  industry when games are being evolved Facebook and the way it operates
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:45.840]  virtually all of these electronic interfaces are monitored because the
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:51.480]  objective of the inventors is to make you come back and that means they want to
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:55.920]  trigger the portions of your brain associated with two things drug addiction
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:03.520]  and orgasm sexual activity the things that will make your brain come back to
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:09.080]  those same sources to get that charge again to get that dopamine release again
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:15.000]  to get serotonin levels change all of these chemical changes occur by the
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:20.040]  energetic changes this is called biophysics it is what the science tells
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:24.480]  us our brains are electrochemical they admitted 20 years ago cell phones
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:28.920]  break the DNA they admit they're doubling brain tumors right and and again
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:34.880]  this is not something new there is a major initiative in in this back in the
[02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:40.480]  early part of the current century and we participated in that in the European
[02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:46.200]  Parliament in testifying about these technologies they went on on the basis
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:50.600]  of the book earth rising the revolution which actually a lot of it made it into
[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:54.240]  their record because they used it as a reference source because there were over
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:39:00.480]  600 sources it made it really easy for people to look at the subject matter and
[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:04.680]  that's been a whole our hallmark all along these aren't just arbitrary
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:08.520]  predictions they're based on the on what's in the published literature and
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:14.520]  what we know today we are indeed at that threshold this is a system to program
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:18.160]  our brains while they're killing us it's all admitted but who's in control of it
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:23.000]  who's at the bottom of the rabbit hole I think it's a layer below most of the
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:26.480]  political leadership quite frankly I think most of the political leadership are
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:31.080]  rolled in and out as long as I agree with what Eisenhower said he said the
[02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:35.840]  technological elite in control of the military industrial complex and this is
[02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:41.120]  exactly who it is so you look at who are those today it's the Microsoft it's the
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:45.760]  Googles it's also the traditional industrialists of the past that
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:51.720]  represent the military industrial complex and the pharmaceutical academic and
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:55.160]  their argument is the Chinese are going to get all this we've got to have better
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:39:59.400]  mind control but of course it's going to end up being used on everybody this is
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:04.040]  already happening and it's the Chinese certainly have investigated all of this
[02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:08.080]  it even comes through on what little comes out of China but they're doing it
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:14.640]  on a level that is going to be the model I would say they call it Skynet the real
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:18.000]  name of the social score system the tracks everything you do and then
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:22.720]  controls you with it if they call it Skynet yeah and you're gonna see the
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:26.520]  extension of this I mean I I see the brick you know what's happening there
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:32.560]  between Russia India South Africa Brazil China a lot of that is economic but the
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:36.840]  economic overlay always has a social overlay and what people know in the
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:42.240]  world today is two to four billion people are coming into the middle class in the
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:48.560]  next 20 years globally and the elites want the same kind of gains only now
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:54.720]  they really want the controls because democratic republics do not serve the
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:58.640]  interest of elites what countries need to do is take their sovereignty back
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:03.320]  starting with their economics starting with their exactly and say we want a new
[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:07.320]  social contract admitting all this and not having a global race towards the
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:12.200]  humanization but a global race towards human empowerment that's right and I
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:17.840]  hope I hope that the secrecy syndrome that has dominated the planet begins to
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:23.880]  again be chiseled away by Donald Trump I hope he has the courage to do it it's
[02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:29.680]  long overdue the public can handle the truth and we need the truth to reform
[02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:36.240]  they crave it in a vacuum the public craves the truth absolutely that's what
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:41.760]  the whole thing has been the last four years leading in the last presidential
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:47.360]  election and coming out of it everyone wants it if you look at the mainstream
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:51.480]  even where do they get their highest ratings when those little bitty
[02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:55.800]  increments is something that actually matters manages to make it no I agree
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:41:59.640]  something else is question the left used to be mean well that they were there
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:02.960]  manipulated just like the right is but now they've weaponized the left so much
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:07.200]  like piranhas out there they almost seem like possessed and it's the social
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:11.760]  media it's the incremental fake bots that they think are real people telling
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:15.520]  them what to do I mean I mean I want to get into like voodoo here but it's like
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:20.240]  they've been possessed it is a type of mind control quite frankly and it's
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:24.680]  intended to do that it's intended to incite your emotions around specific
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:29.760]  ideas that are being shoved into you based on your preferences that are
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:35.360]  that are easily discernible today this is programming we need a digital that's
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:38.560]  right they get your number with the social media they know you're exact with

[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:25.200]  orbiting standard yellow sun on it experiments taking place there are those
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:30.680]  that wish to understand the experiment where are those who wish to know the
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:35.960]  secrets of the universe but there are those who only wish to control their
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:41.760]  fellow humans because they crave total domination and don't want those
[02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:45.840]  discoveries of the universe to ever reach the general public because the
[02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:49.320]  technocrats know the real developments the real science the real spark of
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:55.560]  genius comes from the common people the elites have been imbred so long that
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:48:00.000]  they're mentally ill they're just ruthless psychopaths on average and
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:04.320]  that's why they say humanities impure and fallen they will perfect it with
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:09.520]  digital merger but you must die physically before you're uploaded into it
[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:15.680]  I predicted that 20 years ago now it's been announced and I can see in the
[02:48:15.680 --> 02:48:21.440]  future when people will commit suicide rather than being taken to the oneness
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:25.920]  center where you'll be plugged in your brain downloaded they claim into that
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:35.880]  digital second dimension I see that that's not in the books I see that that's
[02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:42.400]  the future we're gonna face is people running and hiding so they not be picked
[02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:47.640]  up and drug off to be uploaded into the the beautiful matrix and we actually
[02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:51.200]  know that's their plan because obviously Clark was a big luminous and he wrote
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:57.320]  childhoods and and and baggage let's just be honest about this I don't get into
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:01.920]  UFOs I don't get into aliens you know that can be proven but if you look at our
[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:05.320]  globalist operate and the way they behave and things they do and how they
[02:49:05.320 --> 02:49:09.360]  hate humanity like the devil kills till destroyed the Bible warns about and the
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:12.920]  world government coming in all the things it's like wow who the good guys
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:16.920]  they gave us this warning or bad guys using it as an operating manual of
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:22.080]  evil I think it's the first not them the second but just as a scientist I know
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:26.280]  you don't speculate you go off patents and proof and documents that's how they
[02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:31.280]  can never go after you but there's just something so anti-human and so uncool
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:36.160]  about this that's why I frantically fight it because it's it's it's beyond
[02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:41.680]  psychopathic there's something off world about it you know a lot of it is
[02:49:41.680 --> 02:49:46.080]  again about maintaining existing power structures the fact that we have very
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:50.440]  advanced technologies on the planet today some are being you know discussed
[02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:55.080]  lightly you see you know that's when our work in the past 25 years is really
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:58.360]  looking at those trends and and they announce things you know they kind of
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:02.960]  say well let's see what happens how does public relate when you think about
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:08.320]  intellect and what it is and how it actually functions what what they have
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:14.920]  learned is that the human being as a creative force is way way more than
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:18.400]  anyone expected you know the mind effects research done by the central
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:24.160]  intelligence agency and others from the 1950s forward the surprise for them
[02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:28.600]  wasn't the idea that they could create Manchurian candidates this kind of a
[02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:33.280]  mindset if you look at the work of Esther Brooks you'll see plenty on on that
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:39.240]  but the the real thing that they discovered was that all of us have these
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:44.600]  latent human capabilities the military is tagged anomalous human capabilities
[02:50:44.600 --> 02:50:49.120]  which we used to call extra sensory perceptions but there's many other
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:53.240]  names and it's been totally documented so the systems made the decision to
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:57.680]  suppress everyone with a fluoride and to try to suppress it because the elites
[02:50:57.680 --> 02:51:01.440]  don't control it and they don't even have it if they had it they joined
[02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:04.040]  humanity so it's like it's like the elites think they're elite no they're
[02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:08.000]  cancer they're malfunctioning if they had it they would just join humanity they
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:12.240]  would stop it no when you want to talk about is that accurate is that accurate
[02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:16.280]  from your perspective it is and it's a partnership between the elites of
[02:51:16.280 --> 02:51:22.440]  business governments and quite frankly religion has been the servant totally
[02:51:22.440 --> 02:51:26.960]  co-opted the most when I go into a mainline Christian church it feels the
[02:51:26.960 --> 02:51:31.880]  most satanic place you could be because it's been captured well and if you read
[02:51:31.880 --> 02:51:35.920]  if you can read the scripture it says at the end of the age there'll be a form
[02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:40.160]  of godliness but deny the inner power of it and it's the inner power of it that
[02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:44.280]  we need right now in terms of what is happening and that's just a remembrance
[02:51:44.280 --> 02:51:48.720]  of what we are we've been reminded and you know one of the things I've talked
[02:51:48.720 --> 02:51:53.000]  about on your program before is traumatic events and what they trigger
[02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:58.280]  and think about this as a trauma think about the figure of Christ on a cross
[02:51:58.280 --> 02:52:04.480]  as a human being and divine at the same time experiencing this great trauma and
[02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:10.400]  crying out why have you forsaken me and think about this this is where humanity
[02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:16.760]  is where all of us are at this moment is we can ask for that transfiguration of
[02:52:16.760 --> 02:52:21.480]  what we are and recognize what we were created to be but God's free will and
[02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:27.040]  won't do it unless we open the door we have to take a step forward in what we
[02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:30.920]  believe to be right and true and do it from the base from the place that you
[02:52:30.920 --> 02:52:35.960]  are I'm not saying believe like me or change into this or that I'm saying
[02:52:35.960 --> 02:52:41.840]  where you are right now begin to meet yourself again recognize the divinity in
[02:52:41.840 --> 02:52:46.560]  you so you can recognize the divinity statistically know mainstream media
[02:52:46.560 --> 02:52:51.120]  Facebook all of it lowers our IQ sterilizes us makes us depressed and
[02:52:51.120 --> 02:52:55.800]  kills us and it's designed to do it so we know this is from bad people they
[02:52:55.800 --> 02:52:59.440]  didn't just build something that was accidentally bad they built something
[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:05.160]  meant to hurt us it was meant to do exactly what it's doing capture our
[02:53:05.160 --> 02:53:10.680]  time which is the essence of our life you know everyone I know that has
[02:53:10.680 --> 02:53:15.400]  experienced death and I know a lot of people in the last few years and I can
[02:53:15.400 --> 02:53:20.200]  tell you in their last weeks their last days it's not about how much money you
[02:53:20.200 --> 02:53:26.200]  made it's not about another day at the office it's about people relationships
[02:53:26.200 --> 02:53:31.240]  the divinity in each of us that matters and this is what you know they'll talk
[02:53:31.240 --> 02:53:35.000]  about their lives and open up and how smart they are and they're only now
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:40.240]  realizing the power they had all along and it was all it was all blocked it was
[02:53:40.240 --> 02:53:44.040]  all blocked usually by fears that never materialized think about the things we
[02:53:44.040 --> 02:53:47.440]  feared in life and I mentioned this before on a segment it was one of the
[02:53:47.440 --> 02:53:52.000]  best segments I think I've ever done with with your team Alex and and I
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:55.200]  mentioned my father's disappearance and what a trauma that was he just
[02:53:55.200 --> 02:53:59.840]  disappeared off the face of the earth I was 14 years old and and it was
[02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:04.120]  traumatic I can tell you my mom was the entire establishment congressman is
[02:54:04.120 --> 02:54:09.960]  disappears yep and you know my mom had six kids she was 34 years old the
[02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:15.640]  youngest was for the oldest was 14 and I can tell you that it was traumatic but
[02:54:15.640 --> 02:54:20.160]  at the same time it presented for me an opportunity to make different choices and
[02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:26.800]  it was the single greatest gift my father ever gave me because in that trauma
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:32.760]  it changed me it altered me it changed my course in life because I began to make
[02:54:32.760 --> 02:54:39.200]  different choices and I learned at a very young age at 13 and 14 that the
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:45.080]  value of life was the time and how you spent your time and how you moved into
[02:54:45.080 --> 02:54:48.880]  the world from that place and I think that's all of us and if you read the
[02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:54.520]  great home documents it says we're worried about intelligent focused powerful
[02:54:54.520 --> 02:55:00.480]  active there's an exact term they use empowered individuals and that's what
[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:03.360]  the Pentagon under their directive I'm saying they're bad people directing them
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:06.960]  are worried about interesting empowered individuals who have their own
[02:55:06.960 --> 02:55:13.440]  fount right because you can't restrict it you know the truth comes out of you
[02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:18.760]  this is why I I am more interested in the truth being told and then the manner
[02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:23.000]  of its delivery because then I at least know it's coming from the heart and it's
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:27.280]  coming from the head and when you combine those two now you have something
[02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:32.640]  the elite only work from here but they want to manipulate you here this is
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:36.280]  they think we're weak because they have heart they don't understand that the
[02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:40.640]  deeper mind and soul connects the heart and the gut and drives us that's that's
[02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:44.800]  the real brain they're missing that they don't even know that's the advanced
[02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:49.720]  intelligence right and you know the physics even tells us that we're
[02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:55.320]  co-creators in this reality I mean the fact is that the the observer you and I
[02:55:55.320 --> 02:56:00.920]  decide whether something becomes a particle a piece of matter or a wave of
[02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:08.000]  energy wow wow that speaks to our we can conceive it in the higher dimension and
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:13.200]  manifest it if that is God nothing else yeah and it starts in the heart and mind
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:17.960]  and then we speak it with our words and we begin to construct reality that is
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:23.120]  how it works we do it in our families we do it just like Genesis God saw it saw
[02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:28.400]  the void spoke it thought it spoke it it was and it was and you know the thing
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:32.800]  is begin to speak your own personal truth find that truth and speak that
[02:56:32.800 --> 02:56:37.840]  truth and as you learn where you're aired or where you're correct amplify that
[02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:42.800]  and change the air in our thinking and that means a different approach and take
[02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:48.600]  control of your thinking in your heart back turn off the mainstream news don't
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:53.320]  let them have your heart your mind your soul give that to God and then and then
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:58.240]  God isn't a slave master God will then turn you loose who you really are the
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:02.280]  only thing I would say on that ask for grace because a journey to wisdom
[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:06.360]  otherwise is a painful one so ask for grace and all of it and that's where the
[02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:11.000]  change begins and you know what we can make a difference we're seeing it
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:16.640]  happening we can try and do it with a with a kinder heart and a more informed
[02:57:16.640 --> 02:57:22.360]  head and then and then we claim our birth right back and then we march into a
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:27.920]  different kind of war an info war that starts from within wow five more minutes
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:31.320]  with dr. Nick baggage he was powerful 20 years ago but like he kind of disappeared
[02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:34.840]  of the wilderness for a few years like now he's like come back we Obi-Wan Kenobi
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:38.160]  here with us everybody knows the truth when they hear it we'll be back and then
[02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:41.880]  Paul Watson's coming up please spread all the live links and promote the local
[02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:48.240]  stations info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine
[02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:53.560]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:57.880]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and
[02:57:57.880 --> 02:58:03.600]  sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:07.520]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:12.160]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:16.680]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:21.400]  of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[02:58:21.400 --> 02:58:25.960]  distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[02:58:25.960 --> 02:58:30.040]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[02:58:30.040 --> 02:58:34.480]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:39.120]  inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[02:58:39.120 --> 02:58:43.960]  head to info wars life comm and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable

[03:00:09.640 --> 03:00:17.640]  here in this country harping on wars we fight and griping about the way things
[03:00:17.640 --> 03:00:19.720]  are to be
[03:00:19.720 --> 03:00:27.080]  and I don't mind you switching sides and standing up in things they believe in
[03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:33.080]  when they're running down my country man they're walking on well not a big
[03:00:33.080 --> 03:00:38.560]  bit on fire today and I was looking at this daily mail article and business
[03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:42.520]  insider and there's another article out of popular mechanics popular science
[03:00:42.520 --> 03:00:49.720]  that gets into 1974 and the document was finally collated in 1977 that's 44
[03:00:49.720 --> 03:00:57.520]  years ago the year I was born and in the diagrams what's being targeted as a
[03:00:57.520 --> 03:01:02.800]  woman and I continually see this and I'm not saying this to patronize women like
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:09.200]  oh you're the victim own that be a victim no be be victorious realizing that most
[03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:12.880]  the propaganda most the advertising most the chemicals most the weapons are
[03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:19.760]  targeting women now both fluoride and mercury thing targets men as well but
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:23.840]  the whole point is it's it's targeting women dr. baggage in closing powerful
[03:01:23.840 --> 03:01:27.040]  interview it just gets more and more powerful having you on you've been not
[03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:32.080]  vindicated as you're always vindicated but you've really been proven right all
[03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:36.400]  your research now why are they coming out in the open now why are they suddenly
[03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:40.520]  gone from denying it all to putting it out I think it's because they tried to
[03:01:40.520 --> 03:01:43.680]  cover it up but people didn't research in that backfired on them so now they're
[03:01:43.680 --> 03:01:46.760]  trying to hide it in plain view okay we're putting chips and troops heads and
[03:01:46.760 --> 03:01:49.800]  we're gonna end the family and you're all gonna die it's the best for the earth
[03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:53.400]  okay big deal let's move along I mean I think that's what they're trying well
[03:01:53.400 --> 03:01:57.000]  and they're and they're kind of again it's a conditioning process you know now
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:00.000]  they're talking about like for instance with veterans you know because of
[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:03.680]  post-traumatic stress syndrome they're saying hey we might be able to erase
[03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:07.160]  these memories and some people think that's a great idea but what else are
[03:02:07.160 --> 03:02:12.680]  they gonna erase for God's sake and that's what I'm shocked us but when you
[03:02:12.680 --> 03:02:17.560]  start to precision remove a memory set so maybe we have our men and women in
[03:02:17.560 --> 03:02:22.080]  the service engage in some grossly illegal activity and then we just wipe
[03:02:22.080 --> 03:02:25.080]  their memories so you know they're actually working on that you're turning
[03:02:25.080 --> 03:02:29.840]  them into robots that's exactly it and this is the difference the elites
[03:02:29.840 --> 03:02:34.120]  look at us as biological machines that are designed to be manipulated they do
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:39.440]  not see us as spiritual beings occupying a physical form this is the
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:43.360]  difference they're attempting to steal our consciousness just like made in the
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:46.800]  image of God we're not God we're given consciousness and free will and we're
[03:02:46.800 --> 03:02:50.880]  able to create like a baby finger painting towards a stairway to something
[03:02:50.880 --> 03:02:55.400]  greater we're being given the potential to go to the next level by the creator
[03:02:55.400 --> 03:03:01.120]  because obviously God would then give other creatures opportunity to ascend
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:06.200]  and it's about coming back I mean that's what the big message has always been
[03:03:06.200 --> 03:03:11.040]  about coming back to the essence what we are and I think also another model of
[03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:15.640]  the universe is a holographic universe where we as individuals contain some
[03:03:15.640 --> 03:03:21.120]  essence of the whole I think this is what is really meant by those ancient
[03:03:21.120 --> 03:03:24.480]  scriptures that we are part of that that's another question I gotta hold you
[03:03:24.480 --> 03:03:28.000]  over because Paul's taken over or just a minute or two what about all the head of
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:32.000]  like major banks and globalists are going it's all holographic it's all fake
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:35.280]  but they're not agreeing with us they're saying it's all fake give up that's like
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:38.240]  super deluxe this thing from Time Warner it's just give up it's all fake
[03:03:38.240 --> 03:03:42.160]  anyways no no it's all real they're trying to project the hologram explain
[03:03:42.160 --> 03:03:48.160]  that right and and to explain it and also to restrict again to make us feel
[03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:52.280]  like we have no self-determination we do it's the greatest gift that we have at
[03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:57.400]  all that we get to choose we get to choose right now what we do and in the
[03:03:57.400 --> 03:04:02.920]  next second what we do and the power is in making choices not sitting idly by
[03:04:02.920 --> 03:04:07.560]  and accepting like a video game for eternity and they don't want you to
[03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:12.480]  know there's other levels that's exactly it and you don't even have to go
[03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:17.600]  anywhere to find them you're standing in them it's about recognizing remembering
[03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:22.200]  again and having confidence in who you are and what you are and not risk that's
[03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:26.360]  another subject everyone has this essence of their wake of how old we are I

[03:06:41.200 --> 03:06:47.320]  fourth hour and huge headline just went up on info wars.com literally posted one
[03:06:47.320 --> 03:06:53.480]  minute ago this is the back-end data from Reuters polling no other new news
[03:06:53.480 --> 03:06:57.320]  organization has reported on this not even Reuters it's in their back end but
[03:06:57.320 --> 03:07:03.240]  they're not reporting on it as of yet headline huge Republicans now six points
[03:07:03.240 --> 03:07:10.760]  ahead in congressional poll blue wave turns into a drought polling by Reuters
[03:07:10.760 --> 03:07:14.000]  shows that Republicans are now six points ahead of Democrats in the race for the
[03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:20.160]  US Congress remarkable turnaround given that they were once as much as 16 points
[03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:26.440]  behind and that was as recently as December where in another CNN poll
[03:07:26.440 --> 03:07:30.720]  Democrats were 16 points ahead now according to the latest figures from
[03:07:30.720 --> 03:07:36.800]  Reuters in which registered voters were asked if the election for US Congress
[03:07:36.800 --> 03:07:40.120]  were held today would you vote for the Democratic candidate or the Republican
[03:07:40.120 --> 03:07:48.360]  candidate in your district where you live the GOP comes out on top 40.7% of
[03:07:48.360 --> 03:07:52.560]  respondents said they would vote for a Republican with 34.5% saying they would
[03:07:52.560 --> 03:07:56.360]  vote for a Democrat now if you go right to the end of that image on the right
[03:07:56.360 --> 03:08:02.800]  hand side you'll see that the lines have crossed in the past week the Democrats
[03:08:02.800 --> 03:08:08.360]  have sunk and the Republicans have taken over the lines of Chris crossed for the
[03:08:08.360 --> 03:08:16.440]  basically the first time since the 2016 election absolutely incredible polling
[03:08:16.440 --> 03:08:21.600]  figures the Dilbert creator Scott Adams offers his right commentary on the
[03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:26.520]  numbers he says on the plus side Democrats still have 100% support from
[03:08:26.520 --> 03:08:34.120]  MS-13 and Iran and of course from Palestinian terrorists no doubt but
[03:08:34.120 --> 03:08:38.640]  that's the very argument isn't it Nancy Pelosi the lot of them they threw their
[03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:44.680]  lot behind MS-13 animals who are animals by the way today an MS-13 gang
[03:08:44.680 --> 03:08:48.840]  member who's literally nicknamed the animal has been charged with murder
[03:08:48.840 --> 03:08:55.800]  convicted 40 years in jail for murdering a 15 year old boy Nancy Pelosi was
[03:08:55.800 --> 03:09:00.560]  unavailable for comment whether he had a spark of divinity we don't know yet
[03:09:00.560 --> 03:09:05.600]  we're still waiting for word from Pelosi but that's exactly it isn't it
[03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:11.040]  they've plummeted they've created they've collapsed and now in a generic poll for
[03:09:11.040 --> 03:09:17.640]  the US Congress Republicans are more than six points ahead which is marginally
[03:09:17.640 --> 03:09:21.160]  I think outside the margin of error of course we had a CNN poll I think it was
[03:09:21.160 --> 03:09:27.000]  last week where the margin of error had had had become so close that it was a
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:31.400]  basically a toss-up again after Democrats being 16 points ahead as
[03:09:31.400 --> 03:09:37.800]  recently as December now Republicans are six plus points ahead according to the
[03:09:37.800 --> 03:09:43.360]  latest figures out of Reuters and now it's not just the MS-13 situation the
[03:09:43.360 --> 03:09:48.340]  Iran situation it's obviously because of the economy nearly two out of three
[03:09:48.340 --> 03:09:53.080]  Americans polled by CBS this week say the economy is either very good or
[03:09:53.080 --> 03:09:57.640]  somewhat good and that's what it's all about it's going to be the primary issue
[03:09:57.640 --> 03:10:03.280]  as we move towards the midterms Republicans now are whopping given
[03:10:03.280 --> 03:10:07.960]  that how far they were behind six points ahead of Democrats in this
[03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:14.120]  congressional poll absolutely huge I'm gonna send the article to drudge in the
[03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:18.880]  next break here and see if you'll link to that because again you'll only find it
[03:10:18.880 --> 03:10:27.600]  on info wars as of right now talking of ratings and polls CNN's Jake Tapper has
[03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:34.160]  basically lost 32% of his audience in one year this is out of Breitbart
[03:10:34.160 --> 03:10:39.680]  CNN's Jake Tapper has lost nearly a third of his audience throughout all of May
[03:10:39.680 --> 03:10:45.680]  last year CNN's Jake Tapper averaged 1.09 million total viewers and 304,000
[03:10:45.680 --> 03:10:51.200]  viewers in the advertiser coveted 25 to 54 age demo which is by the way is the
[03:10:51.200 --> 03:10:55.760]  predominant demo of my YouTube channel that CNN's tried to shut down tried to
[03:10:55.760 --> 03:11:01.200]  shut down the Alex Jones channel so far this year though through the 16th of May
[03:11:01.200 --> 03:11:06.160]  those numbers have cratered by nearly a third now bear in mind that CNN as a
[03:11:06.160 --> 03:11:12.280]  whole has also lost 30% of its audience in the past year Tapper's demo viewers
[03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:19.240]  have sunk to an average of just 206,000 a 32% decline his total views
[03:11:19.240 --> 03:11:27.040]  collapsed to just 785,028% fall now that was according to CNN's own press
[03:11:27.040 --> 03:11:35.400]  release as of last year he's lost 32% from May 2017 to May 2018 Tapper is now
[03:11:35.400 --> 03:11:41.360]  in last place when compared to Fox News and even MSNBC so you see what's
[03:11:41.360 --> 03:11:46.160]  happened is the Trump derangement syndrome market which was you know let's
[03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:50.400]  be honest a fire last year this time last year everybody was it all into
[03:11:50.400 --> 03:11:54.640]  their Trump derangement syndrome on the left as that kind of cratered in
[03:11:54.640 --> 03:12:00.360]  interest as every new headline every new drama every new bombshell didn't lead
[03:12:00.360 --> 03:12:03.600]  to the impeachment of Donald Trump as they all foolishly thought it would
[03:12:03.600 --> 03:12:10.520]  people began to get jaded so that coalesced basically into MSNBC the
[03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:14.400]  obviously the most hysterical left-wing network on the air although CNN's running
[03:12:14.400 --> 03:12:21.000]  it pretty close so CNN so MSNBC still not doing too bad but CNN has plummeted of
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:25.440]  course that ties into how Trump's basically declared war on them how
[03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:31.480]  they've become at the totem pole of left-wing anti-Trump hysteria article
[03:12:31.480 --> 03:12:37.360]  continues tappas rating woes are impart tied to the fake news albatross that is
[03:12:37.360 --> 03:12:41.880]  the far left CNN CNN's well-documented and ongoing credibility problems have
[03:12:41.880 --> 03:12:46.200]  devastated the anti-Trump channel's ratings which have already collapsed by
[03:12:46.200 --> 03:12:51.800]  some 30% this month nevertheless tappas suffered from some credibility scandals
[03:12:51.800 --> 03:12:56.520]  of his own including his self-destructive refusal to separate himself from the
[03:12:56.520 --> 03:13:03.240]  sinking ship that is CNN because of because before he joined CNN Jake tapper
[03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:08.520]  was seen as you know somewhat of a centrist he did a lot of great work on
[03:13:08.520 --> 03:13:13.040]  the whole surveillance issue back during the Edward Snowden days when he worked
[03:13:13.040 --> 03:13:20.040]  for ABC News so Jake tapper had this kind of perceived credibility even though he
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:25.000]  was it within the mainstream media he was seen as something of an outlier not
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:30.680]  part of the establishment since the 2016 election or of course it he was tied
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:36.760]  in to the Clinton campaign quite intimately going to the dinners going
[03:13:36.760 --> 03:13:40.320]  to the behind-the-scenes events now he's basically joined the chorus of Trump
[03:13:40.320 --> 03:13:47.000]  derangement syndrome on CNN and its costume in viewing figures but MSNBC as
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:52.720]  this article points out is still is pummeling CNN reads MSNBC might be every
[03:13:52.720 --> 03:13:57.280]  bit as dedicated to the left-wing cause as CNN but with hosts like Rachel Maddow
[03:13:57.280 --> 03:14:01.360]  Chris Matthews Ari Melbert Chris Hayes and Joy Reid MSNBC is at least
[03:14:01.360 --> 03:14:05.960]  interesting mainly because several of those people are completely out of their
[03:14:05.960 --> 03:14:12.040]  gourd joy joy Reid in particular of course Rachel Maddow and at times will
[03:14:12.040 --> 03:14:16.600]  even surprise you CNN is as humorous programmed and pedantic as a day spent
[03:14:16.600 --> 03:14:22.720]  at a socialist summer camp not only that as again the most virulent Trump
[03:14:22.720 --> 03:14:27.880]  derangement syndrome imaginable there was a story today upon the drudge report
[03:14:27.880 --> 03:14:32.360]  where it was I think it was a Harvard professor headline Harvard professor
[03:14:32.360 --> 03:14:37.840]  Lawrence tribe warns Dems pushing Trump impeachment you have to shoot to kill
[03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:43.040]  now bearing in mind this arrived a few days after some anti-Trump lunatic who
[03:14:43.040 --> 03:14:48.480]  is shouting anti-Trump slogans tried to shoot up a hotel in Florida you remember
[03:14:48.480 --> 03:14:54.040]  that story now he's been charged it also comes less than a year after James T

[03:14:58.720 --> 03:15:03.800]  group of congressional lawmakers at a baseball practice now we have a Harvard
[03:15:03.800 --> 03:15:08.600]  law professor talking within the context of impeaching Trump but saying
[03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:14.680]  quote if you're going to shoot him you have to shoot to kill now is that really
[03:15:14.680 --> 03:15:19.920]  the kind of rhetoric that we need given these hyperpartis and times given the
[03:15:19.920 --> 03:15:24.840]  fact that we've had fringe extremists on both the left and the right actually
[03:15:24.840 --> 03:15:32.000]  tried to shoot to kill on a regular basis all those words appropriate for CNN
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:35.240]  well he hasn't come out and clarified it obviously he was talking about the
[03:15:35.240 --> 03:15:39.200]  context of impeaching Trump he's not literally talking about shooting to kill
[03:15:39.200 --> 03:15:44.720]  Trump but again all those words really appropriate given the hyperpartisan
[03:15:44.720 --> 03:15:51.120]  fringe extremist hysteria times that we live in probably not probably not but
[03:15:51.120 --> 03:15:55.920]  he wasn't called out for it on CNN reform is confusing but whether it's

[03:22:39.320 --> 03:22:42.840]  with a bit of the research for this behind the scenes to grill Mark Zuckerberg
[03:22:42.840 --> 03:22:49.440]  about Facebook's algorithmic censorship of conservative content now we know
[03:22:49.440 --> 03:22:53.680]  across the board that some conservative commentators some conservative news
[03:22:53.680 --> 03:22:58.520]  outlets on Facebook have been completely decimated by this algorithmic change
[03:22:58.520 --> 03:23:04.280]  which happened basically at the end of January in one week alone I talked about
[03:23:04.280 --> 03:23:11.960]  this last time I was on the show I lost 80 that's 80 80% shares on Facebook
[03:23:11.960 --> 03:23:18.040]  engagement in one week alone so they probably dialed it up even further now
[03:23:18.040 --> 03:23:23.240]  since February the studies show that I think Farage talks about an average of
[03:23:23.240 --> 03:23:28.160]  a 25% drop amongst conservative commentators and news outlets on Facebook
[03:23:28.160 --> 03:23:33.240]  he had the opportunity to ask Zuckerberg about it today we've got the clip and
[03:23:33.240 --> 03:23:38.000]  here it is. Okay I'll start again. Mrs. Zuckerberg I'm the largest user of
[03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:41.920]  Facebook at all the EU institutions in terms of followers in terms of
[03:23:41.920 --> 03:23:46.440]  engagement so I'm your best client here in the room I've no idea of the value
[03:23:46.440 --> 03:23:51.200]  of that but I'm pleased to see you as I hope you are me the one slight problem I
[03:23:51.200 --> 03:23:55.040]  have I'm watching very carefully but testimony that you gave on Capitol Hill
[03:23:55.040 --> 03:24:00.760]  time it again people asked you you know is this genuinely a neutral political
[03:24:00.760 --> 03:24:06.320]  platform and you come up with the same line again and again it's well crafted
[03:24:06.320 --> 03:24:12.760]  you say that Facebook is a platform for all ideas now historically of course
[03:24:12.760 --> 03:24:17.240]  it's true that through Facebook and other forms of social media there is no
[03:24:17.240 --> 03:24:24.020]  way that Brexit or Trump or the Italian elections could ever possibly have
[03:24:24.020 --> 03:24:27.920]  happened it was social media that allowed people to get round the back of
[03:24:27.920 --> 03:24:33.320]  mainstream media now perhaps you're horrified by this creation of yours and
[03:24:33.320 --> 03:24:38.880]  what it's led to I don't know but what is absolutely true is that since January
[03:24:38.880 --> 03:24:44.200]  of this year you've changed your modus operandi you've changed your algorithms
[03:24:44.200 --> 03:24:50.800]  and it has led directly to a very substantial drop in views and engagements
[03:24:50.800 --> 03:24:56.080]  for those that have got right of center political opinions the facts are very
[03:24:56.080 --> 03:24:59.560]  clear just look at President Trump's numbers on a much smaller scale look at
[03:24:59.560 --> 03:25:03.360]  mine look at thousands of other conservative commentators and on average
[03:25:03.360 --> 03:25:09.840]  we're down about 25 percent over the course of this year and you know that's
[03:25:09.840 --> 03:25:14.680]  happening on a platform for all ideas I'm not talking here Mr. Zuckerberg
[03:25:14.680 --> 03:25:19.320]  about extremism I'm not talking about encouraging violence I'm not talking
[03:25:19.320 --> 03:25:24.600]  about hatred of anybody I'm talking about people who have majority mainstream
[03:25:24.600 --> 03:25:29.080]  opinions and frankly I feel
[03:25:29.880 --> 03:25:37.160]  what interests me is who decides what is acceptable who are these people you
[03:25:37.160 --> 03:25:42.120]  referred to earlier these third-party fact-checkers who are these people I
[03:25:42.120 --> 03:25:47.680]  mean why is there no transparency in this process at all I'm not generally
[03:25:47.680 --> 03:25:52.360]  somebody that calls for legislation on the international stage but I'm
[03:25:52.360 --> 03:25:56.800]  beginning to wonder whether we need a social media Bill of Rights to basically
[03:25:56.800 --> 03:26:01.480]  protect free speech and I'm asking you today very very clearly but would you
[03:26:01.480 --> 03:26:08.360]  accept that today Facebook is not a platform for all ideas that is operated
[03:26:08.360 --> 03:26:16.320]  impartially so that was Nigel Farage basically grilling Mark Zuckerberg the
[03:26:16.320 --> 03:26:21.840]  Facebook CEO in the European Parliament today he took all the questions in a
[03:26:21.840 --> 03:26:26.400]  row a very very bizarre way of doing it obviously designed so there would be no
[03:26:26.400 --> 03:26:30.000]  back and forth whatsoever between the people asking the questions and
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:35.040]  Zuckerberg himself half of it somebody else was speaking on his behalf so then
[03:26:35.040 --> 03:26:38.760]  he waited until the end of all the questions before answering any of them
[03:26:38.760 --> 03:26:43.720]  I haven't seen his response in full but from what people have said it's just the
[03:26:43.720 --> 03:26:48.040]  usual denial that there's any you know deliberate targeting of conservatives
[03:26:48.040 --> 03:26:52.400]  basically him saying oh that the algorithm change was simply to boost
[03:26:52.400 --> 03:26:58.600]  trustworthy websites other than the trustworthy websites just happen to be
[03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:03.640]  all establishment media websites just by coincidence of course we had this
[03:27:03.640 --> 03:27:08.040]  headline out of info wars back in January Facebook employee says new
[03:27:08.040 --> 03:27:12.960]  trust algorithm will prevent info wars and Breitbart gaming the system
[03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:17.640]  literally one week later we were decimated along with a lot of other
[03:27:17.640 --> 03:27:22.440]  conservative pages in terms of engagement in terms of shares on Facebook
[03:27:22.440 --> 03:27:29.600]  happened at the end of January Breitbart reported first of May Facebook is now
[03:27:29.600 --> 03:27:35.280]  ranking news organizations based on trustworthiness so they take a URL and
[03:27:35.280 --> 03:27:40.240]  they relegate it before you even post it basically which is why info wars
[03:27:40.240 --> 03:27:44.400]  articles I used to share on Facebook would get as many shares depending on
[03:27:44.400 --> 03:27:49.360]  the interest in the article in the subject as any other link I would post on
[03:27:49.360 --> 03:27:54.720]  Facebook now I mean I could post an info wars link and it'll get it'll get 10
[03:27:54.720 --> 03:28:00.400]  15 shares bearing in mind on my two profiles alone it's an audience of
[03:28:00.400 --> 03:28:05.120]  potential audience of a million people you can still post something else you
[03:28:05.120 --> 03:28:09.440]  can post a meme on Facebook obviously they've got no way of tracking that yet
[03:28:09.440 --> 03:28:15.240]  as to the the political bias of the meme or whatever and that will get three
[03:28:15.240 --> 03:28:20.600]  four five ten thousand shares so they've entered URLs into some kind of
[03:28:20.600 --> 03:28:26.560]  flagging database info wars.com is one of them definitely they've also got
[03:28:26.560 --> 03:28:32.960]  these fake fact checkers it's snopes.com it's the usual suspects being proven
[03:28:32.960 --> 03:28:37.440]  over and over again to be vehemently partisan they're not independent
[03:28:37.440 --> 03:28:42.400]  they're not impartial this is a deliberate attempt to influence people in
[03:28:42.400 --> 03:28:46.000]  their voting habits as we approach the midterms it's very
[03:28:46.000 --> 03:28:53.120]  transparently so this is the Alex Jones show live info wars.com we'll be back

[03:33:23.600 --> 03:33:26.640]  feel back it is of course out of the alex jones show
[03:33:26.640 --> 03:33:30.560]  and now we're going to turn our attention to europe
[03:33:30.560 --> 03:33:34.400]  which is of course the example that america does not want to follow in many
[03:33:34.400 --> 03:33:38.080]  ways we've had some good news in europe over the past few months
[03:33:38.080 --> 03:33:42.160]  obviously the rise of afd in germany and the italian election
[03:33:42.160 --> 03:33:46.720]  it looks like they finally sorted out an agreement to form a government
[03:33:46.720 --> 03:33:49.840]  between the populist five-star movement and the
[03:33:49.840 --> 03:33:54.080]  northern league party which is of course the stuff of nightmares for the
[03:33:54.080 --> 03:33:57.120]  EU because eventually they want to move towards
[03:33:57.120 --> 03:34:01.040]  abolishing the euro basically phasing out of the european union
[03:34:01.040 --> 03:34:04.800]  altogether and they want to control mass immigration
[03:34:04.800 --> 03:34:09.280]  which is also a big problem of course in sweden my favorite country
[03:34:09.280 --> 03:34:13.200]  where the sweden democrats the anti-mass migration party
[03:34:13.200 --> 03:34:17.360]  are now polling first in advance of their
[03:34:17.360 --> 03:34:22.880]  general election which is coming up in september this year not too far away
[03:34:22.880 --> 03:34:27.120]  bright bar had a headline a few days ago new paul shows populist sweden
[03:34:27.120 --> 03:34:32.000]  democrats tied for first ahead of election now this is big because they've
[03:34:32.000 --> 03:34:35.920]  been kind of in third place moving back and forward between
[03:34:35.920 --> 03:34:40.160]  second and third place for basically around a year or more now
[03:34:40.160 --> 03:34:43.360]  but a new poll has shown a surge in support for the anti-mass migration
[03:34:43.360 --> 03:34:48.080]  sweden democrats which are now tied with the ruling social democrat party
[03:34:48.080 --> 03:34:52.320]  head of this year's national election the poll puts the populist anti-mass
[03:34:52.320 --> 03:34:56.400]  migration party it's 23% tied with the social
[03:34:56.400 --> 03:35:01.360]  democrats for first place so that is huge
[03:35:01.360 --> 03:35:04.880]  and why is that happening well it's happening because of stories like this
[03:35:04.880 --> 03:35:11.040]  headline up on info wars dot com sweden police tell women to not go
[03:35:11.040 --> 03:35:15.760]  out late to avoid being raped i've spoken many
[03:35:15.760 --> 03:35:19.200]  times about the skyrocket skyrocketing rape figures sexual
[03:35:19.200 --> 03:35:23.360]  assault figures in sweden now apparently the solution to that
[03:35:23.360 --> 03:35:27.680]  is to not stop the importation of hundreds of thousands of millions of
[03:35:27.680 --> 03:35:31.120]  migrants that tend to have problems in the ways in
[03:35:31.120 --> 03:35:37.120]  which they view and treat women no the solution is to tell women just to
[03:35:37.120 --> 03:35:41.600]  not leave their homes bravo bravo police in sweden are telling
[03:35:41.600 --> 03:35:45.600]  women to not go out late to avoid being raped in a damning
[03:35:45.600 --> 03:35:48.960]  indictment of how the country is putting their own citizens at risk in favor of
[03:35:48.960 --> 03:35:53.680]  pursuing mass migration policies so they had two more attempted
[03:35:53.680 --> 03:35:58.880]  rapes over the weekend in ostosund and that prompted police investigators
[03:35:58.880 --> 03:36:03.360]  sus browner helm to tell swedish radio
[03:36:03.360 --> 03:36:06.800]  that women should be vigilant and quote preferably
[03:36:06.800 --> 03:36:10.880]  do not go out late that's the solution to not
[03:36:10.880 --> 03:36:16.640]  being raped is to not go out at night of course it bears similarities to what the
[03:36:16.640 --> 03:36:20.880]  mayor of cologne told german women back in 2016
[03:36:20.880 --> 03:36:25.440]  after the mass molestation of german women on new years eve 2015 you remember
[03:36:25.440 --> 03:36:29.040]  that carried out by predominantly almost exclusively
[03:36:29.040 --> 03:36:31.920]  even though barely any of them were convicted took for it
[03:36:31.920 --> 03:36:37.680]  muslim migrants she told potential victims she told women to keep
[03:36:37.680 --> 03:36:41.280]  potential rapists at arms length was completely
[03:36:41.280 --> 03:36:45.200]  crucified and rightly so in the media for doing so
[03:36:45.200 --> 03:36:49.120]  again despite the fact that those rapists hardly any of them actually got
[03:36:49.120 --> 03:36:52.800]  prosecuted well as soon as these comments from the swedish
[03:36:52.800 --> 03:36:56.640]  police investigator telling women to not go out late at night to avoid being
[03:36:56.640 --> 03:36:59.760]  assaulted began to attract controversy
[03:36:59.760 --> 03:37:03.040]  they had to dial it back police district manager max
[03:37:03.040 --> 03:37:06.480]  olson asserted that her comments did not stand and
[03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:10.400]  authorities were not encouraging women to avoid going out late at night
[03:37:10.400 --> 03:37:14.000]  that turnaround came about 24 hours later only after
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:18.160]  the initial comments began to begin to receive publicity
[03:37:18.160 --> 03:37:21.600]  so yeah it was obviously an attempt to quell public anger
[03:37:21.600 --> 03:37:26.720]  because swedish women are already afraid of going out at night they're already
[03:37:26.720 --> 03:37:33.920]  imposing curfews on themselves a 2016 poll found that almost half of swedish
[03:37:33.920 --> 03:37:37.360]  women were afraid to go out at night alone in fact i think there's a more
[03:37:37.360 --> 03:37:41.120]  recent poll which found that even more were afraid to go out alone
[03:37:41.120 --> 03:37:46.960]  even in the day of course we had swedish music festivals throughout 2016
[03:37:46.960 --> 03:37:51.120]  throughout 2017 numerous rapes numerous sexual assaults in
[03:37:51.120 --> 03:37:55.280]  some cases literally just men pinning down women in the center
[03:37:55.280 --> 03:37:59.440]  of a field in front of a stage at a music festival and just outright raping
[03:37:59.440 --> 03:38:02.720]  them just in the middle of the entire group of people
[03:38:02.720 --> 03:38:06.960]  absolutely shocking so what what was the solution
[03:38:06.960 --> 03:38:12.960]  to cancel all the music festivals in 2018 sweden's largest music festival
[03:38:12.960 --> 03:38:17.520]  in the summer of 2018 was cancelled because they just said we just can't get
[03:38:17.520 --> 03:38:21.280]  a handle on this rape sexual assaults molestation of
[03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:25.200]  women they just cancelled the event
[03:38:25.360 --> 03:38:29.600]  a study by afton blotter which is by no means a right-wing news outlet found
[03:38:29.600 --> 03:38:32.720]  that 88 percent of gang rapists in the scandinavian
[03:38:32.720 --> 03:38:35.680]  country over the last six years had a migrant background
[03:38:35.680 --> 03:38:39.600]  now bearing in mind if you're not a newspaper a national newspaper in
[03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:43.200]  sweden you can't even talk about these statistics
[03:38:43.200 --> 03:38:46.720]  on social media because you risk being arrested
[03:38:46.720 --> 03:38:50.960]  and prosecuted for hate crimes and we're going to talk more about that
[03:38:50.960 --> 03:38:55.280]  probably in the next segment now but they're called hate facts literally
[03:38:55.280 --> 03:38:58.640]  swedish citizens can't cite statistics anymore
[03:38:58.640 --> 03:39:02.080]  without being told that they're carrying out an act of hate speech
[03:39:02.080 --> 03:39:05.920]  newspapers can do it and they occasionally do but as a private citizen
[03:39:05.920 --> 03:39:10.080]  you put yourself at risk of arrest and jail time
[03:39:10.080 --> 03:39:13.680]  if you point out statistics that are in the government's
[03:39:13.680 --> 03:39:16.720]  own reports that's how bad it is in sweden right now
[03:39:16.720 --> 03:39:20.320]  they literally have a taxpayer funded group
[03:39:20.320 --> 03:39:24.800]  it's called the net hate examiner group funded by taxpayers
[03:39:24.800 --> 03:39:29.440]  that goes out to hunt thought criminals on the internet in sweden
[03:39:29.440 --> 03:39:34.160]  to flag their comments to the authorities so they're prosecuted find
[03:39:34.160 --> 03:39:37.200]  and in some place in some instances thrown in prison
[03:39:37.200 --> 03:39:40.800]  literally a taxpayer funded group that does that in sweden now
[03:39:40.800 --> 03:39:45.920]  i mean we've got equivalents of it in the united states in britain hope not hate
[03:39:45.920 --> 03:39:49.760]  but as far as i know they're at least not taxpayer funded so far
[03:39:49.760 --> 03:39:53.280]  absolutely shocking situation people always wonder
[03:39:53.280 --> 03:39:57.280]  how do these comments get flagged up you know somebody's leaving a
[03:39:57.280 --> 03:40:00.720]  an obscure comment on a on a facebook group that doesn't really have a lot of
[03:40:00.720 --> 03:40:03.920]  members how are these comments come into light well there's
[03:40:03.920 --> 03:40:07.600]  there's a taxpayer funded group that literally is given hundreds of thousands
[03:40:07.600 --> 03:40:10.400]  of dollars to hunt these thought criminals down
[03:40:10.400 --> 03:40:14.960]  for stating statistical fact
[03:40:15.040 --> 03:40:20.960]  a private study the article continues of 4142 rulings regarding sex related
[03:40:20.960 --> 03:40:25.040]  crimes passed by 40 swedish courts between 2012
[03:40:25.040 --> 03:40:28.880]  and 2014 found that 95.6 percent of rapes
[03:40:28.880 --> 03:40:33.600]  were committed by men of foreign dissent
[03:40:33.600 --> 03:40:36.880]  two out of three rapes were ab with aggravating circumstances were
[03:40:36.880 --> 03:40:40.640]  committed by newly arrived migrants or approved asylum seekers
[03:40:40.640 --> 03:40:45.200]  official crime statistics show in sweden that reported rapes have increased
[03:40:45.200 --> 03:40:48.640]  34 percent in the last 10 years and the left
[03:40:48.640 --> 03:40:51.680]  and snopes and all these liars always come out and say oh no that's because
[03:40:51.680 --> 03:40:56.960]  they changed the definition of rape no BS that is not true
[03:40:56.960 --> 03:41:00.320]  it's true that they changed it but then this rape stats
[03:41:00.320 --> 03:41:03.840]  continued to rise after that change was made
[03:41:03.840 --> 03:41:08.000]  so no you can't blame it all on them changing the definition of what rape
[03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:11.360]  of what sexual assault was because it continued to go up
[03:41:11.360 --> 03:41:15.120]  after that and the figures prove that the figures that swedish citizens
[03:41:15.120 --> 03:41:18.640]  can't even talk about on the internet because they risk being arrested
[03:41:18.640 --> 03:41:22.800]  they risk being interrogated so this is all taking place
[03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:25.920]  they're telling women to not go out late at night
[03:41:25.920 --> 03:41:30.240]  again an absolute non-solution absolutely ludicrous and pathetic
[03:41:30.240 --> 03:41:34.880]  meanwhile the real criminals are being kept under thumb by the swedish
[03:41:34.880 --> 03:41:38.240]  authorities this is out of Sputnik swedish
[03:41:38.240 --> 03:41:42.240]  journalist probe for hate speech over sharia mocking cartoons
[03:41:42.240 --> 03:41:45.440]  the former editor-in-chief of the sweden democrats magazine
[03:41:45.440 --> 03:41:48.960]  has been interrogated this is what they like to do they literally just turn up
[03:41:48.960 --> 03:41:52.480]  and interrogate people who are critical of mass immigration
[03:41:52.480 --> 03:41:55.760]  interrogated by authorities after being reported to the police
[03:41:55.760 --> 03:42:00.320]  by the net hate examiner group the taxpayer funded group that literally
[03:42:00.320 --> 03:42:04.160]  hunts down thought criminals in sweden the reason
[03:42:04.160 --> 03:42:07.440]  is two satirical drawings about islamism he published
[03:42:07.440 --> 03:42:11.680]  on facebook so literally siding with the same
[03:42:11.680 --> 03:42:16.480]  ideological motivation as the charlie hebdo islamist killers
[03:42:16.480 --> 03:42:20.000]  by saying no we will not tolerate satirical
[03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:26.560]  cartoons about islam literally faces potential finds prison time
[03:42:26.560 --> 03:42:30.080]  interrogated by the police but drawing some cartoons
[03:42:30.080 --> 03:42:33.600]  which satirized a belief system which is not a race
[03:42:33.600 --> 03:42:38.560]  which is not an ethnicity swedish women being told they can't go out late at
[03:42:38.560 --> 03:42:40.320]  night because they can't get a handle on these
[03:42:40.320 --> 03:42:44.400]  rapist criminals oh but if you draw a cartoon which makes fun of islam

[03:49:22.880 --> 03:49:26.720]  support for the anti mass migration sweden democrats
[03:49:26.720 --> 03:49:30.320]  is now basically at the point where they're tied with the ruling party
[03:49:30.320 --> 03:49:34.640]  after being in third place as little as a few months ago
[03:49:34.640 --> 03:49:38.560]  and you know i wonder why gee i wonder why we've got a situation where people in
[03:49:38.560 --> 03:49:41.920]  sweden can barely even talk about statistics can barely even talk about
[03:49:41.920 --> 03:49:44.320]  what they're witnessing on their own streets
[03:49:44.320 --> 03:49:48.400]  without putting themselves at risk of being interrogated
[03:49:48.400 --> 03:49:52.000]  find that in some cases even imprisoned meanwhile
[03:49:52.000 --> 03:49:55.760]  they're telling women not to go out late at night to avoid being raped
[03:49:55.760 --> 03:49:59.680]  they're interrogating and potentially imprisoning
[03:49:59.680 --> 03:50:03.600]  journalists for drawing cartoons that make fun of islam
[03:50:03.600 --> 03:50:09.200]  and then we have this story up on info wars dot com hate fact
[03:50:09.200 --> 03:50:13.120]  swedish man faces two years in prison for saying Somalis
[03:50:13.120 --> 03:50:18.800]  have low IQ a man in sweden faces up to two years in prison over a
[03:50:18.800 --> 03:50:23.200]  facebook post in which he said Somalis typically have low IQs
[03:50:23.200 --> 03:50:27.440]  despite being technically correct so again who's
[03:50:27.440 --> 03:50:30.800]  who's found him who's uncovered this dangerous thought criminal
[03:50:30.800 --> 03:50:37.280]  well it's obviously the taxpayer funded net hate examiner group because this
[03:50:37.280 --> 03:50:41.760]  comment was made in september last year and they've just caught him
[03:50:41.760 --> 03:50:45.040]  they've caught that dangerous thought criminal you know
[03:50:45.040 --> 03:50:49.840]  rape sexual assault so maybe up 34 violent crime maybe through the roof
[03:50:49.840 --> 03:50:54.240]  they're having grenade attacks like every other day in major swedish cities
[03:50:54.240 --> 03:50:57.600]  but cars are being burned they've got riots but
[03:50:57.600 --> 03:51:01.040]  don't worry about that a guy made an offensive facebook post back in
[03:51:01.040 --> 03:51:04.800]  september and they've caught him they've got him
[03:51:04.800 --> 03:51:08.800]  what did he say he said quote only every fifth Somali have
[03:51:08.800 --> 03:51:13.040]  has an IQ over 70 oh my god just throw away the key
[03:51:13.040 --> 03:51:17.680]  throw away the key according to prosecutor paulina brandberg
[03:51:17.680 --> 03:51:21.840]  the post targets a protected group of people based on their national origin
[03:51:21.840 --> 03:51:25.440]  and is therefore hate speech but is it true
[03:51:25.440 --> 03:51:30.160]  yes it's true according to british professor richard linn
[03:51:30.160 --> 03:51:33.760]  and his finished colleague tatoo bahanan who published a book called IQ and
[03:51:33.760 --> 03:51:36.720]  the wealth of nations which made a correlation between IQ rates
[03:51:36.720 --> 03:51:41.840]  and economic prosperity the defendant is technically correct
[03:51:41.840 --> 03:51:45.600]  since the average IQ in Somalia is wait for it
[03:51:45.600 --> 03:51:50.800]  70 in fact he was being kind to them in some ways because if you go on the IQ
[03:51:50.800 --> 03:51:55.520]  research website which lists all the average IQs by country
[03:51:55.520 --> 03:51:59.280]  and i'm supposed that'll get shut down i'll probably get blocked in sweden
[03:51:59.280 --> 03:52:06.160]  it says that the average IQ in Somalia is 68 now this facebook post may not
[03:52:06.160 --> 03:52:11.360]  argument as to whether IQs are determined on socioeconomic status
[03:52:11.360 --> 03:52:16.960]  environment upbringing race didn't even speculate on that he merely
[03:52:16.960 --> 03:52:20.880]  pointed out the fact that the average IQ in Somalia
[03:52:20.880 --> 03:52:24.320]  is 70 in fact he complimented them to some extent given that it's probably
[03:52:24.320 --> 03:52:29.920]  closer to 68 now he faces two years in prison
[03:52:29.920 --> 03:52:34.000]  i mean if that's such a horrible thing to say even though it's statistically true
[03:52:34.000 --> 03:52:37.920]  shut him down with facts have a debate you know
[03:52:37.920 --> 03:52:41.600]  no they've literally got taxpayer funded groups going out hunting thought
[03:52:41.600 --> 03:52:45.200]  criminals and arresting people interrogating them
[03:52:45.200 --> 03:52:49.120]  the case is yet another example is what of what is now being referred to as hate
[03:52:49.120 --> 03:52:52.480]  facts statements that are generally true
[03:52:52.480 --> 03:52:56.080]  yet are negative towards minorities or other ethnic groups
[03:52:56.080 --> 03:53:00.880]  and another case that i cite in this article which we've talked about before
[03:53:00.880 --> 03:53:04.320]  is a 55 year old swedish man who was put on trial
[03:53:04.320 --> 03:53:09.120]  and fined $1200 for committing quote a crime of opinion
[03:53:09.120 --> 03:53:12.720]  even though it wasn't an opinion it was a statement of fact
[03:53:12.720 --> 03:53:17.040]  he posted on facebook that muslims account for a lot of gang crime in sweden
[03:53:17.040 --> 03:53:22.400]  and other stuff like rapes now again in the previous segment i just read out a
[03:53:22.400 --> 03:53:25.680]  bunch of private studies a bunch of government figures
[03:53:25.680 --> 03:53:29.520]  a study by a swedish newspaper not a right wing news outlet
[03:53:29.520 --> 03:53:33.680]  that proved gang rape violent assault
[03:53:33.680 --> 03:53:38.560]  is predominantly the domain of muslim migrants in sweden their way over
[03:53:38.560 --> 03:53:42.000]  represented in violent crime rates and in sexual assault
[03:53:42.000 --> 03:53:49.440]  that is a fact he said it on facebook and he got interrogated and fined $1200
[03:53:49.440 --> 03:53:52.960]  the guy who said the average IQ in Somalia is 70
[03:53:52.960 --> 03:53:56.240]  faces two years up to two years in prison
[03:53:56.240 --> 03:54:00.880]  absolutely incredible situation this is what a country looks like that's
[03:54:00.880 --> 03:54:06.320]  basically committed suicide on the altar of diversity
[03:54:06.320 --> 03:54:09.840]  now it's this whole new wave which i've talked about before hate facts where you
[03:54:09.840 --> 03:54:13.680]  can literally state facts but because they're about a certain
[03:54:13.680 --> 03:54:17.760]  protected class of people they're deemed to be hate speech
[03:54:17.760 --> 03:54:22.960]  even though they're true now tommy robinson was suspended on twitter back
[03:54:22.960 --> 03:54:27.520]  in february tweeting quote 90 of grooming gang convictions
[03:54:27.520 --> 03:54:31.200]  are muslims now majid Nawaz who is a muslim
[03:54:31.200 --> 03:54:35.440]  reformist got on twitter and said about robinson quote
[03:54:35.440 --> 03:54:41.920]  he's quoting a fact he broke it down and i think it was about 86 percent of
[03:54:41.920 --> 03:54:46.160]  culprits in these grooming gangs that have been caught across the country
[03:54:46.160 --> 03:54:49.520]  our muslims are predominantly bangladesh and pakistani
[03:54:49.520 --> 03:54:54.480]  it's a fact okay if you don't acknowledge basic facts how are we gonna
[03:54:54.480 --> 03:54:58.960]  combat these problems if you turn acknowledging basic facts
[03:54:58.960 --> 03:55:03.040]  into hate crimes where people are so afraid of even talking about it
[03:55:03.040 --> 03:55:05.920]  on the internet how are we ever going to resolve
[03:55:05.920 --> 03:55:10.320]  any of this and you only drive it further underground anyway and make it
[03:55:10.320 --> 03:55:13.360]  the domain the domain of actual extremists
[03:55:13.360 --> 03:55:17.520]  it's completely absurd so we've got
[03:55:17.520 --> 03:55:20.720]  swedish journalists being arrested not being arrested but at least being
[03:55:20.720 --> 03:55:24.160]  charged interrogated for drawing cartoons which
[03:55:24.160 --> 03:55:27.360]  make fun of islam we've got women being told not to
[03:55:27.360 --> 03:55:29.920]  go out late at night because they might get raped
[03:55:29.920 --> 03:55:34.480]  we've got people saying talking about Somali IQs on facebook
[03:55:34.480 --> 03:55:37.440]  being prosecuted facing up to two years in jail
[03:55:37.440 --> 03:55:42.640]  meanwhile Reuters reports swedish girls fearing forced marriage told to hide
[03:55:42.640 --> 03:55:47.280]  spoon in underwear so they got such a big problem now with
[03:55:47.280 --> 03:55:52.240]  muslim migrants trying to secret swedish girls out of the country
[03:55:52.240 --> 03:55:57.520]  to have female genital mutilation operations in other countries and to
[03:55:57.520 --> 03:56:01.440]  force them into forced marriage that now authorities are telling
[03:56:01.440 --> 03:56:04.400]  victims of this which are predominantly of course going to be
[03:56:04.400 --> 03:56:08.560]  little muslim girls to put spoons in their underwear so they
[03:56:08.560 --> 03:56:12.480]  set off the x-ray metal detector scanners at the airports
[03:56:12.480 --> 03:56:16.320]  and they have a final opportunity to sound the alarm
[03:56:16.320 --> 03:56:20.800]  and talk to the authorities and escape basically being shipped abroad
[03:56:20.800 --> 03:56:24.640]  to have their genitals mutilated these are the real problems we have in
[03:56:24.640 --> 03:56:27.680]  countries like sweden but now some guy drew a
[03:56:27.680 --> 03:56:31.840]  an offensive cartoon about muslims let's concentrate on him
[03:56:31.840 --> 03:56:35.440]  and in fact when you look at the funding behind the how they fund the different
[03:56:35.440 --> 03:56:40.080]  aspects of policing it's all going towards hate crimes it's going to
[03:56:40.080 --> 03:56:43.440]  patrolling online tweets it's the same situation in london
[03:56:43.440 --> 03:56:47.280]  and it's absolutely absurd meanwhile in the netherlands
[03:56:47.280 --> 03:56:51.680]  1400 underage dutch girls forced into sex slavery each year
[03:56:51.680 --> 03:56:57.280]  by migrant background males again same situation that we had in the uk
[03:56:57.280 --> 03:57:02.640]  this is their culture and some cultures are better than others and if we
[03:57:02.640 --> 03:57:05.440]  don't focus on this if we don't actually acknowledge it
[03:57:05.440 --> 03:57:09.520]  and allow people to talk about it it's going to continue
[03:57:09.520 --> 03:57:14.800]  it's going to get even worse germany will now train asylum seekers to become
[03:57:14.800 --> 03:57:18.320]  truck drivers what could possibly go wrong with that
[03:57:18.320 --> 03:57:22.960]  in london four young men stabbed in messity cons london in five days
[03:57:22.960 --> 03:57:26.080]  more stabbings but he's pledged some money for
[03:57:26.080 --> 03:57:30.640]  knife crime projects which is infantesimal in comparison to the money
[03:57:30.640 --> 03:57:36.560]  he's pledged to patrol online hate crime absolutely absurd ludicrous that's
[03:57:36.560 --> 03:57:39.520]  going to wrap it up war room with owin shroyer is coming
