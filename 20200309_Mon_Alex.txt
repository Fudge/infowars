[00:00:09.952 --> 00:00:11.093]  Big Brother.
[00:00:11.093 --> 00:00:12.853]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:14.754]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:14.754 --> 00:00:16.475]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:18.135]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:22.837]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.634]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's now all confirmed.
[00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:36.219]  The coronavirus is a man-made bioweapon launched by the deep state and the globalists through China to hit the United States and bring down the economy.
[00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.401]  They're scripting it all to try to bring down Trump.
[00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:45.746]  Trump tried to defend China, tried to not create a hysteria, tried to help him, and now he is being absolutely set up.
[00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:47.747]  We have been dead on again, and we
[00:00:47.927 --> 00:00:51.630]  We can stop the globalist plan, but it's up to you to get the word out.
[00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.153]  We're going to lay it all out today in the most important broadcast ever.
[00:00:55.153 --> 00:01:00.818]  Here's a Gregory's Report that nails it.
[00:01:00.818 --> 00:01:05.102]  25% of the world's generic drugs are made in India.
[00:01:05.102 --> 00:01:10.767]  And India relies upon China for almost 70% of their active ingredients.
[00:01:12.253 --> 00:01:18.437]  Several of these Chinese sources have shut down due to the Wuhan coronavirus.
[00:01:18.437 --> 00:01:26.183]  And as a result, India has restricted exports of 26 ingredients and the medicines made from them.
[00:01:26.183 --> 00:01:30.846]  The United States no longer produces its own medicine.
[00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:33.528]  How did this happen?
[00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:41.454]  In the 1990s, 90% of these fundamental ingredients were produced in the USA, Europe, and in Japan.
[00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:43.211]  But U.S.
[00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:50.173]  laws on generic drugs began motivating companies to manufacture in China.
[00:01:50.173 --> 00:01:55.475]  The greatest win for China came exactly three months after 9-11.
[00:01:55.475 --> 00:02:03.457]  On December 11, 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization, aka the WTO.
[00:02:04.997 --> 00:02:14.645]  And immediately began wiping out the competition in the American free market with unbeatable low slave labor costs.
[00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:24.113]  Within two years, the USA lost their last aspirin, penicillin, and vitamin C producers.
[00:02:24.113 --> 00:02:27.416]  Today, we depend upon China for about 90% of our medicine.
[00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:43.123]  China has already amassed a reputation for poor quality, and because they have monopolized the global market, the FDA has been forced to lower their manufacturing standards.
[00:02:43.123 --> 00:02:53.434]  The low standards in China are likely to blame in part for the many explosions at Chinese pharmaceutical factories that have caused global shortages.
[00:02:54.591 --> 00:03:03.153]  Recently, because of the Wuhan coronavirus, masks were ordered to not be exported from China.
[00:03:03.153 --> 00:03:08.935]  There are life-sustaining drugs that China is the sole supplier of to the U.S.
[00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:15.777]  What happens if China declares an emergency and shuts down all medical supply and drug exports?
[00:03:15.777 --> 00:03:18.898]  Like both India and China are already beginning to do.
[00:03:22.594 --> 00:03:32.180]  If the WTO is the father of globalism, then the UN's insidious replacement migration is its mother.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:41.426]  And in Italy, the man believed to be coronavirus patient zero is a Pakistani migrant who works in food delivery.
[00:03:41.426 --> 00:03:47.390]  After testing positive for the virus, he refused to self-isolate and continued to deliver food.
[00:03:48.755 --> 00:04:00.338]  A recent video of migrants holding babies over fires to make them cry in order to deceitfully cross the border into Greece shows several people speaking Farsi.
[00:04:00.338 --> 00:04:02.738]  They are Iranian.
[00:04:02.738 --> 00:04:06.519]  Iran is currently suffering an outbreak of the coronavirus.
[00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.340]  Why on earth should Greece allow them in?
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.962]  The coronavirus appears to be some type of eugenics bioweapon designed to kill the weak and elderly.
[00:04:17.878 --> 00:04:19.960]  But one thing is for certain.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.524]  It has already killed the philosophy of globalism.
[00:04:24.524 --> 00:04:31.569]  And now, it will be stress-testing the precarious digital grid that our entire society is based upon.
[00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.613]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:50.848 --> 00:04:51.949]  InfoWars.
[00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:53.130]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.133]  Today.
[00:04:59.133 --> 00:04:59.974]  Rich in Alabama.
[00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:00.874]  Rich, thanks for calling.
[00:05:00.874 --> 00:05:01.875]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:02.615]  Appreciate it.
[00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:05.277]  First thing, I love the turbo force.
[00:05:05.277 --> 00:05:08.839]  I drive truck for a living, and it's amazing.
[00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:13.682]  Coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end, but that turbo force is amazing.
[00:05:13.682 --> 00:05:15.664]  How is turbo force different than coffee?
[00:05:15.664 --> 00:05:17.065]  Oh, I'll tell you what.
[00:05:17.065 --> 00:05:17.145]  It's
[00:05:17.725 --> 00:05:21.169]  Sustainable, anywhere from 18 hours.
[00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.693]  I don't feel the jitters like I do drinking coffee.
[00:05:24.693 --> 00:05:28.537]  And it's just, you know, at the end of the day, I don't need anything to go to bed.
[00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:31.901]  I'll, you know, I'll pop a knockout to my mouth cold.
[00:05:32.742 --> 00:05:39.387]  I recently went out to a top developer who didn't want his name on it, and I said, what would the ultimate long, say, 10-hour energy be?
[00:05:39.387 --> 00:05:40.708]  Is that possible?
[00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:46.573]  That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and natural that are time-released.
[00:05:46.573 --> 00:05:49.875]  And there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product.
[00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:53.218]  So that's why turbo force has such a great effect.
[00:05:53.218 --> 00:05:55.880]  And so I really appreciate you, and I'm glad that you like turbo force.
[00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:12.315]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:06:12.315 --> 00:06:16.598]  You better believe you got one!
[00:06:16.598 --> 00:06:21.682]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.138 --> 00:06:35.481]  And that was 12 years ago I gave that speech in Dallas.
[00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:39.043]  And now look at what's ended up happening.
[00:06:39.043 --> 00:06:44.966]  The nationalist patriot movement against the globalists is taking over every major government that has elections.
[00:06:44.966 --> 00:06:48.048]  The economy worldwide was surging back.
[00:06:48.048 --> 00:06:56.353]  And then a man-made virus transferred by Barack Hussein Obama five years ago to Communist China magically is released.
[00:06:57.495 --> 00:06:59.437]  China says they have under control.
[00:06:59.437 --> 00:07:04.541]  Trump wants to be friendly after winning the trade war and agrees with them.
[00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:12.388]  And the media then, as we predicted, begins to say that it's all Trump's fault as the virus spirals out of control.
[00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:36.313]  When you see big tech, and you see Hollywood, and you see the mainstream media, and you see the EU, and you see the authoritarians, all together, hyping this virus like the end of the world, and the responses we've seen with martial law in areas of Europe and Asia, we knew this was going to be super big, whether the virus itself was ultra deadly or not.
[00:07:37.563 --> 00:07:40.045]  And I think the jury's still out on that.
[00:07:40.045 --> 00:07:49.534]  You look at these different cruise ships where you might have 700 to 1,000 to 2,000, 3,000 passengers with recirculated air and two people die.
[00:07:49.534 --> 00:07:53.237]  Two really old people who are husband and wife.
[00:07:53.237 --> 00:07:55.099]  Who are so synced up.
[00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:56.560]  A lot of 87-year-old people.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.442]  When their husband or wife dies, they die that same week.
[00:08:00.442 --> 00:08:10.087]  So, it's a real balancing situation here to be accurate with this, and to not over-hype it, lest we join in with what the globalists are doing.
[00:08:10.087 --> 00:08:16.210]  But then when they're creating massive hype, that is going to create hysteria, we have to report on that and say, that's coming.
[00:08:17.679 --> 00:08:21.181]  And so people a month ago, six weeks ago, they said, why are you hyping this?
[00:08:21.181 --> 00:08:21.921]  Why are you helping them?
[00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:24.642]  I said, no, they're the ones hyping it.
[00:08:24.642 --> 00:08:31.525]  This is concerted, choreographed between all the globalist factions.
[00:08:31.525 --> 00:08:34.887]  This is the big enchilada.
[00:08:34.887 --> 00:08:37.048]  Not Russiagate, not the impeachment.
[00:08:37.048 --> 00:08:38.548]  We kept saying, what's the new thing going to be?
[00:08:38.548 --> 00:08:41.290]  And I said, probably a bio attack to bring down the economy.
[00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.571]  Probably this Wuhan thing six weeks ago.
[00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:44.011]  And again,
[00:08:45.998 --> 00:08:49.760]  The Oracle of Austin was accurate, but I'm no Oracle.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.621]  You're no Oracle.
[00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:53.803]  You all saw it as well.
[00:08:53.803 --> 00:08:54.904]  Wow!
[00:08:54.904 --> 00:08:56.825]  This is going to be insane.
[00:08:56.825 --> 00:08:59.207]  Well, I had several guests booked today.
[00:08:59.207 --> 00:09:01.008]  I've canceled them.
[00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:12.815]  This is a time for we the people, whether you're in Italy, or whether you're in China, or whether you're in Australia, or whether you're in Mexico, or whether you're in the UK or Canada, whether you're in the US, to have a chance to call in on the broadcast.
[00:09:12.815 --> 00:09:13.396]  And so let me
[00:09:14.437 --> 00:09:15.483]  Give the number out.
[00:09:15.483 --> 00:09:17.332]  We're going to take a lot of your calls today.
[00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:26.355]  First-time callers, long-time callers, you agree, you disagree, we're just going to go bam, bam, bam, so don't be offended when I go to you quick and move on.
[00:09:26.355 --> 00:09:28.456]  No matter how good you are, have your point and hit it and we're done.
[00:09:28.456 --> 00:09:33.539]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, that's 877-789-2539 or 512-646-1776 if you're an international caller and 1-800 numbers don't work for some of you, just dial the country access code and 512-646-1776.
[00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:56.576]  This is why all the real Democrat candidates have said it out.
[00:09:56.576 --> 00:10:01.002]  Because they know Trump couldn't be defeated even election fraud at this point.
[00:10:01.002 --> 00:10:06.250]  But economic warfare could bring civil unrest and drive him from office.
[00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:15.692]  Six weeks ago, I'm not going to go back to six weeks ago, five weeks ago, four weeks ago, three weeks ago, two weeks ago, a week ago, last week, last night.
[00:10:15.692 --> 00:10:18.995]  You've all heard it, the regular listeners and the callers and the guests.
[00:10:18.995 --> 00:10:25.039]  We have nailed it spectacularly.
[00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:26.580]  But it's not too hard.
[00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:49.883]  To nail it that your wife's cheating on you if you pull up on a day you're supposed to be out of town, there's a weird car in the driveway, and you go in and her door's locked, and then you look out the window and a guy's putting his pants on in the backyard and he just jumped out the window.
[00:10:49.883 --> 00:10:53.446]  And then she opens the door and says, oh, I was sleeping, and her face is all flushed and she's all sweating.
[00:10:55.526 --> 00:10:58.007]  I mean, you can see this a mile coming.
[00:10:58.007 --> 00:11:05.391]  It's ridiculous how incredibly obvious this whole thing is.
[00:11:05.391 --> 00:11:09.933]  In fact, this is more obvious than the dude jumping out your back window putting his britches on.
[00:11:09.933 --> 00:11:13.995]  This is, the door's open, you open it, he's on top of her.
[00:11:13.995 --> 00:11:21.079]  And I'm sorry to use an analogy like that, but when you're just watching Netflix and CNN, I get some of the public are like zombies.
[00:11:22.213 --> 00:11:29.958]  When you're paying attention, this was red flag level.
[00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:34.461]  Just unbelievable.
[00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:44.327]  The scripting, the choreography, the way that it was all coordinated.
[00:11:44.327 --> 00:11:45.368]  And man did.
[00:11:46.792 --> 00:11:50.195]  Mike Adams and myself and the listeners, too, got it.
[00:11:50.195 --> 00:11:51.435]  Did we not nail it?
[00:11:51.435 --> 00:11:52.116]  Nailed it.
[00:11:52.116 --> 00:11:53.917]  Grand slam.
[00:11:53.917 --> 00:11:55.238]  Royal flush.
[00:11:55.238 --> 00:12:03.104]  But I only say that because now we're sure 100% what's going on.
[00:12:03.104 --> 00:12:07.708]  There's no debating what's happening.
[00:12:07.708 --> 00:12:11.090]  And we better start talking about what's going to unfold next.
[00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.452]  It's going to be unbelievable.
[00:12:15.868 --> 00:12:21.664]  Because of the hype and the way they're gonna lay the hype out and the way everybody wants to grandstand and be part of the hype.
[00:12:22.836 --> 00:12:30.339]  I've had newspapers and TV stations call up that normally never want a quote going, you were at CPAC, could you have been exposed?
[00:12:30.339 --> 00:12:32.020]  Are you going to be self-quarantining?
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.282]  Because two people had it, now Ted Cruz has done it and this other congressman.
[00:12:36.282 --> 00:12:40.384]  Again, everyone's just piling on, that's how humans act, like lemmings.
[00:12:40.384 --> 00:12:44.466]  You can pull up on YouTube, real footage of lemmings running off a cliff.
[00:12:44.466 --> 00:12:48.708]  And once one goes off, they all just start, they all just start jumping off the cliff.
[00:12:50.199 --> 00:12:56.220]  The wicked flee when none pursue, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.301]  I believe this virus is probably more deadly than the flu.
[00:12:59.301 --> 00:13:00.361]  It's obviously man-made.
[00:13:00.361 --> 00:13:03.182]  It's got an HIV delivery system.
[00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:04.662]  It's highly communicable.
[00:13:04.662 --> 00:13:11.704]  Let's say it kills 2% of people that are infirm and old, and maybe half a percent of those that aren't.
[00:13:13.973 --> 00:13:26.722]  That's a problem, but getting hysterical and locking down civilization and just running off the edge of a cliff like a bunch of crazy lemmings is not a good thing to do.
[00:13:26.722 --> 00:13:28.383]  We told you to get the food to be prepared.
[00:13:28.383 --> 00:13:30.264]  We told you to get your ammo and get ready.
[00:13:30.264 --> 00:13:36.649]  And I've got a bunch of storable food and everything else, but I said to my wife, we've only got one deep freeze.
[00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.231]  I'll start parking my car in the driveway.
[00:13:39.231 --> 00:13:41.212]  Go buy two more today.
[00:13:43.703 --> 00:13:50.004]  And just load them with hamburger meat and all other sorts of good stuff to mix in what we got.
[00:13:50.004 --> 00:13:55.385]  Not because of the virus, but if they're successful bringing down Trump, it's going to trigger a civil war.
[00:13:55.385 --> 00:13:56.545]  The globalists don't care.
[00:13:56.545 --> 00:13:58.726]  China wants us in civil war.
[00:13:58.726 --> 00:14:03.766]  They remove Trump, civil war, total breakdown.
[00:14:03.766 --> 00:14:04.687]  But they want that.
[00:14:04.687 --> 00:14:10.808]  And then we could be looking at a depression that lasts years and years and years.
[00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:12.288]  And in the Great Depression, we had
[00:14:14.448 --> 00:14:21.292]  More than half the public, right at 90% living in rural areas, and most of them were self-sufficient.
[00:14:21.292 --> 00:14:26.195]  Today, 10% are rural, half of them are self-sufficient.
[00:14:26.195 --> 00:14:30.537]  So we got 5% self-sufficient versus 50, 60, 70%.
[00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:35.020]  Can you imagine society?
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.762]  It'll look like World War Z when the zombies
[00:14:38.757 --> 00:14:43.878]  Go over the wall in Jerusalem and they're just running around just slaughtering and eating people.
[00:14:43.878 --> 00:14:49.459]  That's what people act like after about two weeks of no food.
[00:14:49.459 --> 00:14:55.460]  And they just, in giant mobs, actually climb over walls just like zombies and behave just like zombies.
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.040]  That's what the Pentagon trains for zombie killing.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.381]  And people go, what's that mean?
[00:14:59.381 --> 00:15:05.722]  Well, that's the cover for practicing to mow down mobs of people that say are trying to take over a nuclear power plant.
[00:15:05.722 --> 00:15:06.882]  And you don't want to mow them down, but
[00:15:09.099 --> 00:15:15.203]  Once they've taken over all the command and control, it's called dark ages.
[00:15:15.203 --> 00:15:17.425]  It's called the fall of civilization.
[00:15:17.425 --> 00:15:23.789]  You look at the LA riots, you look at any of that, the left is totally primed on everything, and this is their moment.
[00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:26.871]  The left is making their move.
[00:15:26.871 --> 00:15:37.698]  This is the CHICOMS and the EU and the UN and Hollywood, and they all were scripted together, and now they're all scripted blaming America and Trump, because they know we don't have a police state in place, which is good,
[00:15:38.118 --> 00:15:44.745]  So they want to then exacerbate that during a crisis, saying Trump's not doing enough and creating much fear as they can.
[00:15:44.745 --> 00:15:49.070]  We'll break down how they're planning to do that and how we stop them together.
[00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.913]  We've already beaten their last three attempts to stop us.
[00:15:51.913 --> 00:15:53.014]  We're going to defeat this one.
[00:15:53.014 --> 00:15:54.816]  But this is the big one.
[00:15:54.816 --> 00:15:56.158]  Tell everybody, tune in now.
[00:15:57.702 --> 00:16:01.145]  I'm here with Scott Youseum, founder of OMG Tax.
[00:16:01.145 --> 00:16:06.009]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[00:16:06.009 --> 00:16:12.394]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnishments sometimes in the same day.
[00:16:12.394 --> 00:16:17.798]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay for what is known as an offer in compromise.
[00:16:17.878 --> 00:16:20.301]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:21.743]  Oh, can I ever?
[00:16:21.743 --> 00:16:26.909]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[00:16:26.909 --> 00:16:27.669]  Guess what?
[00:16:27.669 --> 00:16:32.415]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[00:16:32.688 --> 00:16:43.231]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[00:16:43.231 --> 00:16:43.492]  Call 800-486-8112.
[00:16:43.492 --> 00:16:43.552]  800-486-8112.
[00:16:43.552 --> 00:16:43.612]  800-486-8112.
[00:16:43.612 --> 00:16:43.792]  That's 800-486-8112.
[00:16:57.296 --> 00:17:08.484]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:17:08.484 --> 00:17:17.791]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[00:17:17.791 --> 00:17:22.875]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[00:17:23.075 --> 00:17:27.280]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:35.268]  And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[00:17:35.268 --> 00:17:36.530]  So here's what you should do right now.
[00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.512]  Check out the PPX Microgrid System
[00:17:38.672 --> 00:17:39.252]  That's right.
[00:17:58.539 --> 00:17:59.560]  Everybody's calling me.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:06.907]  I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[00:18:06.907 --> 00:18:08.349]  How bad is it really?
[00:18:08.349 --> 00:18:11.031]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality storable foods.
[00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:14.114]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation, that actually still has food.
[00:18:14.114 --> 00:18:16.717]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got to package it.
[00:18:16.717 --> 00:18:17.357]  They got the food.
[00:18:17.357 --> 00:18:20.040]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important thing.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:40.534]  And that's drink purified water, that's pray, that's get focused, that's not be stressed out because you're prepared, and that's get DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the mitochondria and the cells and is the biggest immune booster you can engage in, the X2, the X3, the foundation, everything, the Ultra 12 back in stock, our Nano Silver, Super Silver and Super Blue toothpaste, it's still 50% off.
[00:18:40.534 --> 00:18:45.657]  Turmeric is known for doing a super job when it comes to cleaning out your cells.
[00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:50.040]  We have the strongest turmeric you're gonna find out there, 95% humanoid from bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:18:51.781 --> 00:19:06.746]  I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by all the work to help people be prepared.
[00:19:06.746 --> 00:19:13.689]  And instead of just giving into sickness care, take care of their health, take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality.
[00:19:13.689 --> 00:19:15.810]  And I say that from personal experience.
[00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:30.721]  Because I know that the products that are being offered here, I've tried them and I use them every day, and that power pack that they have, the AM-PM power pack, well, I wouldn't be so energetic this morning, except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[00:19:31.442 --> 00:19:52.916]  Let me start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think about these great events in the world, one of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself, remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for good purpose, for our families and for our communities.
[00:19:52.916 --> 00:19:58.179]  And right now, folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the future of America.
[00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:03.783]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:13.954 --> 00:20:18.336]  You didn't think the globalists would just take it lying down, do you?
[00:20:18.336 --> 00:20:19.476]  No, my friends.
[00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:23.837]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:23.837 --> 00:20:26.778]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:26.778 --> 00:20:31.700]  They're going to strike back with everything they've got, and they are.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:38.623]  What are the Achilles heels of the globalist operation?
[00:20:38.623 --> 00:20:39.723]  Well, there are many.
[00:20:40.697 --> 00:20:43.479]  You exposed the providence of the virus.
[00:20:43.479 --> 00:20:44.300]  It's man-made.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.901]  It's produced by the U.S.
[00:20:45.901 --> 00:20:53.186]  government and sold by Obama publicly with a huge debate and controversy five years ago.
[00:20:55.877 --> 00:21:02.259]  Then expose how China was praised for killing people at checkpoints and welding into their homes when Trump wanted to stop four weeks ago.
[00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:06.861]  The flights, the media said, that's bad and so did the UN and so did the Chinese.
[00:21:06.861 --> 00:21:18.704]  He exposed Bill Gates and his background developing and patenting a similar virus and how he now wants to ship out test kits to everybody to create a total hysteria.
[00:21:18.704 --> 00:21:23.946]  And you talk about the Democrats and the big takeaway, there's a big article on Infowars.com, there's several,
[00:21:25.333 --> 00:21:32.155]  But it was already trending on Twitter as the top hashtag this morning on every feed.
[00:21:32.155 --> 00:21:34.915]  Stock market crash.
[00:21:34.915 --> 00:21:36.235]  Bear market.
[00:21:36.235 --> 00:21:37.396]  That was being force-fed.
[00:21:37.396 --> 00:21:39.716]  They rig what's up there.
[00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:40.396]  They admit they do.
[00:21:40.396 --> 00:21:41.277]  They have a congressional hearing.
[00:21:41.277 --> 00:21:43.257]  They go, Alex Jones and Paul Watson are number one.
[00:21:43.257 --> 00:21:44.237]  Well, we took that down.
[00:21:44.237 --> 00:21:44.997]  We rig it down.
[00:21:44.997 --> 00:21:48.238]  It'll only be what we want.
[00:21:48.238 --> 00:21:51.399]  And so you've got a almost 3,000 point plunge
[00:21:54.614 --> 00:22:02.970]  It's been gyrating back and forth all day long, depending on the different indices you look at.
[00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:07.017]  S&P, Dow Jones, Nikkei.
[00:22:07.017 --> 00:22:07.198]  So.
[00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:23.026]  Whether the virus is super deadly or not, we know the hype is contrived, the coordination is synthetic, and this is an attack on America.
[00:22:23.026 --> 00:22:38.473]  And anybody that blames Trump, or anybody that blames the first responders, or anybody that blames frontline medical workers, is working with the globalists and the CHICOMs to create a collapse of confidence in the dollar,
[00:22:39.588 --> 00:22:52.777]  And in our country, and this is modern warfare, America is under military, economic, biological attack right now.
[00:22:52.777 --> 00:22:55.259]  You know, I've had a lot of anxiety the last few years.
[00:22:55.259 --> 00:22:58.722]  I've been really upset, and everybody knows it's shown on air.
[00:22:58.722 --> 00:23:01.183]  I have no anxiety now.
[00:23:01.183 --> 00:23:01.984]  It's all confirmed.
[00:23:01.984 --> 00:23:03.365]  We're in a total war.
[00:23:03.365 --> 00:23:05.466]  Nothing's going to be the same after this.
[00:23:05.466 --> 00:23:08.969]  You won't recognize China and the United States in a year.
[00:23:10.188 --> 00:23:15.071]  And we're going to dictate what that transformation is going to look like.
[00:23:15.071 --> 00:23:18.953]  America, incredibly empowered, like after World War II.
[00:23:20.276 --> 00:23:35.523]  Or America as a race-warring, divided, bankrupt nation of victims and cowards, ruled over by Hollywood and the global social engineers, and our debtors, the communist Chinese.
[00:23:35.523 --> 00:23:42.206]  So, this is 21st century warfare, and everybody out there better decide which damn side you're on.
[00:23:45.054 --> 00:23:59.338]  Oh yeah, China's sending special teams to Europe and Africa and offering help here because they're the heroes with Xi Jinping that first fought it and did everything and the media's all scripting that and Trump's bad.
[00:23:59.338 --> 00:24:07.521]  It's their virus, it comes from them, it's man-made and our media, I've got stacks of headlines here that Xi Jinping's a hero.
[00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:11.782]  Remember the Washington Post just four months ago?
[00:24:11.782 --> 00:24:13.583]  Xi Jinping must quote
[00:24:16.089 --> 00:24:20.110]  Destroy Trump?
[00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.130]  Annihilate Trump?
[00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.171]  What was that headline?
[00:24:23.171 --> 00:24:27.252]  Washington Post headline, let's pull up.
[00:24:27.252 --> 00:24:27.752]  G.G.
[00:24:27.752 --> 00:24:34.074]  Ping must destroy Trump to save America.
[00:24:34.074 --> 00:24:39.076]  And now it's scripted again by the folks that own our debt, that own Hollywood, the chi-coms, run by the globalists.
[00:24:39.076 --> 00:24:39.796]  They're just their puppets.
[00:24:42.796 --> 00:24:50.422]  Yet again, we need to thank the CHICOMS for saving us.
[00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:54.966]  And it's our evil president that's to blame.
[00:24:54.966 --> 00:25:01.431]  Because six weeks ago, they're like, oh, we're locking folks up and killing people at checkpoints, but it's contained and it's no big deal.
[00:25:01.431 --> 00:25:04.073]  And Trump goes, okay, yeah, don't kill the market.
[00:25:04.073 --> 00:25:06.495]  I agree, China's doing a great job.
[00:25:06.495 --> 00:25:09.237]  And as soon as he did that, it's all Trump's fault.
[00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:13.230]  There it is.
[00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.492]  Xi's choice.
[00:25:14.492 --> 00:25:16.954]  Destroy Trump.
[00:25:16.954 --> 00:25:22.459]  Or save him and weaken America.
[00:25:22.459 --> 00:25:27.244]  That's how sick these freakazoids are.
[00:25:27.244 --> 00:25:33.770]  And there are people marching in Germany and Sweden and Denmark and Spain.
[00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.132]  I have the articles and videos here today.
[00:25:36.184 --> 00:25:39.065]  Young women with signs saying, KILL SWEDEN!
[00:25:39.065 --> 00:25:40.226]  DOWN WITH WHITES!
[00:25:40.226 --> 00:25:41.506]  KILL SWEDEN!
[00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:42.607]  DOWN WITH CHRIST!
[00:25:42.607 --> 00:25:43.507]  KILL SWEDEN!
[00:25:43.507 --> 00:25:45.068]  They have signs, KILL SWEDEN!
[00:25:45.068 --> 00:25:46.168]  KILL CHRIST!
[00:25:46.168 --> 00:25:46.989]  DOWN WITH SWEDEN!
[00:25:46.989 --> 00:25:50.110]  And they're saying, WE WANT ISLAM!
[00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.251]  BRING IT!
[00:25:52.251 --> 00:25:54.172]  You're like, what's wrong with these people?
[00:25:54.172 --> 00:25:58.434]  Why do they want a bunch of military-age men with no jobs from barbarous countries where women are slaves?
[00:25:59.775 --> 00:26:01.616]  Because they're programmed.
[00:26:01.616 --> 00:26:03.396]  They're paid to do it.
[00:26:03.396 --> 00:26:03.917]  There it is.
[00:26:03.917 --> 00:26:05.497]  Sweden must die.
[00:26:05.497 --> 00:26:07.478]  You go watch the videos, man.
[00:26:07.478 --> 00:26:08.518]  It is just craze.
[00:26:08.518 --> 00:26:15.981]  Just bring down... Because it's a form of decadence.
[00:26:15.981 --> 00:26:24.505]  Of cooking.
[00:26:24.505 --> 00:26:25.505]  They're traitors.
[00:26:25.505 --> 00:26:26.946]  They're paid to do it.
[00:26:28.254 --> 00:26:36.340]  So Europe's having a full Islamic new invasion launch by Erdogan.
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.461]  And now they're attacking the economy.
[00:26:38.461 --> 00:26:42.484]  And I told you on Friday, I said, man, they're going to bring the stock market down next week.
[00:26:43.885 --> 00:26:46.946]  This is sure as the sun came up and now it's here.
[00:26:46.946 --> 00:26:52.948]  And I hate to sit here and say, see, I told you, see, I told you, see, I told you, see, I told you, see, I told you, see, I told you.
[00:26:52.948 --> 00:26:55.448]  These mega banks have armored fortresses.
[00:26:55.448 --> 00:26:57.329]  They have offshore command centers.
[00:26:57.329 --> 00:27:02.070]  They brag that they're going to bring down the nation states and then have armored city states.
[00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.491]  They aren't space stations up in space like Elysium.
[00:27:05.316 --> 00:27:21.580]  But are on earth, armored, beautiful, total control, smart cities that you beg to be part of, and then outside of it is the Hunger Games.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.581]  And there are now two novel coronavirus strains in circulation.
[00:27:25.581 --> 00:27:30.362]  That was confirmed weeks ago, and now it's being confirmed by the UN.
[00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.592]  There's one that's really super deadly, supposedly, and one that isn't.
[00:27:35.592 --> 00:27:42.996]  I mean, again, who knows what any of this is going to turn into, but this is crazy town.
[00:27:42.996 --> 00:27:45.398]  We are not in a normal position anymore.
[00:27:45.398 --> 00:27:50.041]  This is 21st century war, just like World War I or World War II.
[00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:50.861]  This is bigger.
[00:27:50.861 --> 00:27:51.982]  This is psychological.
[00:27:51.982 --> 00:27:55.885]  In fact, print me the Cicero quote, please, and the man in the arena.
[00:27:55.885 --> 00:27:58.286]  I want to read both of those when we come back from here and go to calls.
[00:27:58.286 --> 00:27:59.527]  I'm going to go through all these articles.
[00:28:01.209 --> 00:28:02.950]  At the start of the next hour.
[00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:11.593]  But I first just want to go to your calls and put that front and center when we come back after I read the man in the arena, the human in the arena.
[00:28:11.593 --> 00:28:13.354]  Because this is it.
[00:28:13.354 --> 00:28:13.454]  And.
[00:28:15.069 --> 00:28:17.531]  I've been very upset building up to this fight.
[00:28:17.531 --> 00:28:32.121]  It's kind of like when the bully's gonna meet you after school and you're not gonna back down and he's four years older than you and he's bigger than you but you just can't back down and you're nervous in class all day and then finally you just walk out the parking lot and you just start slamming his head in the concrete.
[00:28:32.121 --> 00:28:33.422]  I mean, I've reached that point now.
[00:28:33.422 --> 00:28:36.825]  I feel good because we're now in it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:36.825 --> 00:28:37.946]  You better believe this is it!
[00:28:38.726 --> 00:28:40.087]  This is the big assault.
[00:28:40.087 --> 00:28:41.968]  America, all the marbles.
[00:28:41.968 --> 00:28:48.593]  And understand, we've got all the thinkers, we've got the best people for every race, color, and creed that want freedom and love God.
[00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:50.975]  We've got the truth, but now you've got to expose.
[00:28:50.975 --> 00:28:54.057]  The left's publicly celebrating this to bring down America.
[00:28:54.057 --> 00:28:56.179]  They are the enemy in their own declarations.
[00:28:57.924 --> 00:28:59.886]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:05.189]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:05.189 --> 00:29:06.771]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:06.771 --> 00:29:15.137]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:15.137 --> 00:29:20.821]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:20.981 --> 00:29:22.822]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:22.822 --> 00:29:25.083]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:25.083 --> 00:29:29.484]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:29.484 --> 00:29:31.665]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:29:31.665 --> 00:29:39.548]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:29:59.116 --> 00:30:01.719]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[00:30:01.719 --> 00:30:08.707]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[00:30:08.707 --> 00:30:19.160]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:25.863]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[00:30:25.863 --> 00:30:26.823]  It is back in stock.

[00:30:36.047 --> 00:30:43.490]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:43.950]  And of course,
[00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:51.558]  Vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[00:30:51.558 --> 00:30:52.759]  And they're both back in stock.
[00:30:52.759 --> 00:30:57.644]  40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:30:59.212 --> 00:31:00.793]  Hanuman, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[00:31:00.793 --> 00:31:01.934]  What do you think's really going on?
[00:31:01.934 --> 00:31:02.654]  And thanks for calling.
[00:31:02.654 --> 00:31:04.716]  So yes, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago.
[00:31:04.716 --> 00:31:05.396]  I was getting ready.
[00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:09.179]  I went to buy a bunch of toilet paper and some things before crowds really hit.
[00:31:09.179 --> 00:31:13.802]  And I had my phone, I had my show going on, sticking it in my pocket so I could hear it.
[00:31:13.802 --> 00:31:14.983]  I wasn't using headphones.
[00:31:14.983 --> 00:31:15.883]  And this lady stops.
[00:31:15.883 --> 00:31:17.384]  She says, who are you listening to?
[00:31:17.384 --> 00:31:18.165]  Who's that talking?
[00:31:18.165 --> 00:31:19.586]  I said, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:21.807]  And she just got, her eyes got wide open.
[00:31:21.807 --> 00:31:22.948]  And she says, really?
[00:31:22.948 --> 00:31:24.029]  I thought he was off the air.
[00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:29.532]  And I said no, and I told her I explained, you know, the whole situation and told her where to go.
[00:31:29.532 --> 00:31:34.395]  She wrote down, you know, Dan.video and also Infowars.com and just said she's still on.
[00:31:34.395 --> 00:31:39.978]  I run into people at the grocery store, at the mall, on the hike and bike trail, and they go, oh Alex, I used to love you.
[00:31:39.978 --> 00:31:40.998]  I wish you were still on air.
[00:31:40.998 --> 00:31:42.039]  Are you ever going to go back on air?
[00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:42.619]  And I'm like, well,
[00:31:42.739 --> 00:31:44.421]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:31:44.421 --> 00:31:46.823]  Coronavirus is a man-made bioweapon designed to destroy nation-states.
[00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.731]  We're in a planetary government.
[00:32:10.731 --> 00:32:13.172]  This is how the globalists are striking back.
[00:32:13.172 --> 00:32:15.233]  Here's a fortune headline today.
[00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:22.116]  Fears of global coronavirus contagion rage as 3,000 cruise ship passengers return home.
[00:32:22.116 --> 00:32:23.997]  And that's just in one nation.
[00:32:24.657 --> 00:32:28.843]  Coronavirus deals major blow to German car factories in China.
[00:32:28.843 --> 00:32:34.430]  They're reporting it could cut their sales in half this year.
[00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.615]  That's how major this is.
[00:32:37.615 --> 00:32:39.297]  Everyone needs to be prepared.
[00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:43.060]  2020 is not a year to play games.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:52.309]  InfoWars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out, regardless of the fact that the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth.
[00:32:52.309 --> 00:33:02.137]  We need you to step to the plate and help spread the word about Bandot Video and InfoWars.com today.
[00:33:02.137 --> 00:33:04.740]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.820]  We've got it.
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:16.662]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:33:16.662 --> 00:33:21.043]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:21.043 --> 00:33:28.185]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:35.167]  I'm not gonna play CNN, MSNBC, ABC News, CBS News, Bill Maher, HBO.
[00:33:36.963 --> 00:33:39.585]  Saying, we hope the coronavirus devastates the U.S.
[00:33:39.585 --> 00:33:40.866]  economy to bring down Trump.
[00:33:40.866 --> 00:33:42.988]  Wow!
[00:33:42.988 --> 00:33:44.389]  Woo!
[00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:45.770]  We hope it destroys your savings.
[00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:47.071]  We hope your factory shuts down.
[00:33:47.071 --> 00:33:49.273]  We hope your farm goes bankrupt.
[00:33:49.273 --> 00:33:52.215]  And I'm just like, these people have reached next criminal level.
[00:33:52.215 --> 00:33:54.617]  I'm not going to play it all for you.
[00:33:54.617 --> 00:33:55.798]  You've heard it.
[00:33:55.798 --> 00:33:57.320]  My God, they played it like 10 times last week.
[00:34:01.078 --> 00:34:04.521]  You know it, and now they are celebrating.
[00:34:04.521 --> 00:34:09.164]  Mainline CNN, ABC News going, yeah!
[00:34:09.164 --> 00:34:15.769]  Trump played this down weeks ago, because the Chycoms were, but they know you don't remember that, or they think you don't.
[00:34:15.769 --> 00:34:18.031]  And so now it's his fault.
[00:34:18.031 --> 00:34:21.514]  It's all Trump's fault.
[00:34:21.514 --> 00:34:23.516]  They're going to try to suspend the election using this.
[00:34:23.516 --> 00:34:26.498]  And again, yeah, okay, maybe the virus kills half a percent of people.
[00:34:29.056 --> 00:34:33.497]  That's like a revolver that has a hundred bullets in it.
[00:34:33.497 --> 00:34:36.559]  Or a revolver that has a hundred cylinders in it and only five bullets.
[00:34:36.559 --> 00:34:41.380]  I mean, it's, it's, it's... It's not even half a percent, it's even less than that.
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:46.962]  It's like a revolver that... You drive down the highway, it's dangerous.
[00:34:46.962 --> 00:34:49.703]  And I'm not saying don't get prepared for the virus.
[00:34:49.703 --> 00:34:55.685]  We knew, though, they were hyping this for maximum hysteria day one, shedding the precedent.
[00:35:02.005 --> 00:35:04.027]  This is the big one, folks.
[00:35:04.027 --> 00:35:13.874]  And I've got to wonder, if they don't get Trump out using this, what comes next after that?
[00:35:13.874 --> 00:35:21.420]  So regardless of how deadly the virus really is, I'll tell you next hour what I really think is going on, and I'll give you a prelude to it now.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.183]  Dr. Pachinko's right.
[00:35:24.183 --> 00:35:29.547]  It's been in the United States for a long time.
[00:35:31.417 --> 00:35:37.778]  And they're gonna find that they held back the test kits, wanting to not create a panic.
[00:35:37.778 --> 00:35:43.659]  And then now the test kits are all going out, as we said weeks ago, there'll be a lot of people that have it.
[00:35:43.659 --> 00:35:51.661]  And then that's gonna set in the giant panic, even though it's harmless to most people, or just gives you a respiratory cold.
[00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:55.681]  Now, it does mutate, it does other things later.
[00:35:55.681 --> 00:35:59.882]  But notice, HIV used to kill all these people, and then suddenly,
[00:36:01.283 --> 00:36:09.231]  It wasn't killing people anymore and suddenly Magic Johnson didn't have it and suddenly all these other folks cure themselves with herbs and things.
[00:36:09.231 --> 00:36:13.936]  And it's because they have to keep putting the vaccines out with the HIV original strain.
[00:36:13.936 --> 00:36:17.459]  And they keep having outbreaks with the original strain from the 1970s and 80s.
[00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:23.698]  And they go, it's funny, it mutates and becomes harmless, but the old strain keeps showing up.
[00:36:23.698 --> 00:36:28.185]  Because they're injecting it into you, and they don't want something that really goes on forever.
[00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:30.649]  They want to kill who they're injecting with it.
[00:36:30.649 --> 00:36:33.473]  And then it mutates and becomes less deadly and then harmless.
[00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:46.418]  And so you test positive for HIV, but most of you have a strain of it that doesn't hurt you, but the AZT and everything does kill you, and that's why they're saying, oh, treat this with these drugs.
[00:36:46.418 --> 00:36:53.323]  Again, so big pharma makes hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:36:53.323 --> 00:36:55.124]  We're so ahead of the curve on this.
[00:36:55.124 --> 00:36:56.165]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:36:57.918 --> 00:37:06.325]  I haven't even plugged this hour because the news that got brought to my attention last week, and I got so busy I didn't cover it, is so incredible.
[00:37:06.325 --> 00:37:19.535]  And then this morning, I was reading news, and I saw this and ran over to my crew and ran over to our researchers and developers, and I said, wow, you tried to tell me last week.
[00:37:19.535 --> 00:37:24.199]  I didn't realize that the main group about to get FDA approval
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:36.648]  For documented over-the-counter coronavirus response, and that Australia is looking at approving, is using raw iodine.
[00:37:36.648 --> 00:37:42.111]  It's not even a tonic.
[00:37:42.111 --> 00:37:45.474]  In a nasal nebulizer you spray into your nostrils.
[00:37:46.536 --> 00:37:47.137]  I'm going to get to that.
[00:37:47.137 --> 00:37:49.518]  And of course, we're way ahead of that curve.
[00:37:49.518 --> 00:37:50.599]  I was wondering why.
[00:37:50.599 --> 00:37:52.921]  Why are our iodine cells like quadruple right now?
[00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:55.043]  Why are we going to sell out of X2 and X3?
[00:37:55.043 --> 00:37:56.424]  Well, people went out and did their own research.
[00:37:56.424 --> 00:38:00.687]  And again, so far ahead of the curve that then I get behind the curve.
[00:38:00.687 --> 00:38:10.055]  It's like, you know, you're like lapping them so much that later you're not even, it's like, you've got to like, oh, you know, those innovations you had years ago, eight years ago?
[00:38:10.055 --> 00:38:11.336]  Oh, well, those are now being picked up.
[00:38:12.762 --> 00:38:14.363]  I'm just like, hey, it's well-known antiviral.
[00:38:14.363 --> 00:38:15.504]  It's really good for you.
[00:38:15.504 --> 00:38:16.525]  Boost your whole immune system.
[00:38:16.525 --> 00:38:18.887]  Get, you know, get iodine, X2, X3.
[00:38:18.887 --> 00:38:26.995]  And then it's like all over the news that these big pharma companies are about to roll out their own nasal iodine systems.
[00:38:26.995 --> 00:38:28.396]  Well, this stuff's strong.
[00:38:28.396 --> 00:38:31.759]  You don't take this and shoot up your nose, but you can do whatever you want with a neti pot or whatever.
[00:38:31.759 --> 00:38:35.662]  But it's just funny because last week I'm telling my wife, just neti pot with X2 or X3.
[00:38:38.485 --> 00:38:46.858]  And I'm showing her the research studies and I'm like, I'm so unopportunistic that I'm not even on air saying that, though I'm doing it for my own self.
[00:38:46.858 --> 00:38:48.641]  That's the same thing that happened with Swirlable Foods six weeks ago.
[00:38:50.216 --> 00:38:54.517]  I said to my wife, hey, here's the number to their main manager.
[00:38:54.517 --> 00:38:55.898]  We get a 20% discount.
[00:38:55.898 --> 00:38:59.599]  They can't do that much because it's not, it's only marked up like 100%.
[00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:01.200]  Most foods marked up like 10 times.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.741]  There's so much bureaucracy and things involved.
[00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:04.541]  I said, you know, call up.
[00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:05.121]  This is the guy.
[00:39:05.121 --> 00:39:05.941]  Just make sure you get it.
[00:39:05.941 --> 00:39:06.542]  Get a lot of it.
[00:39:06.542 --> 00:39:09.883]  Get another year's supply for four people, five people.
[00:39:09.883 --> 00:39:10.483]  She's like, really?
[00:39:10.483 --> 00:39:11.263]  We already got so much.
[00:39:11.263 --> 00:39:12.904]  I said, just, just, just, just, just get more.
[00:39:13.717 --> 00:39:17.318]  And then I'm sitting there a couple days later and I go, wait a minute, I should be plugging storable food.
[00:39:17.318 --> 00:39:25.159]  If I'm, if I'm, because really all I do on air is what I do.
[00:39:25.159 --> 00:39:26.299]  It's totally unscripted.
[00:39:26.299 --> 00:39:27.380]  It's like what I do.
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.200]  It's what I use.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:28.900]  It's what I like.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.760]  It's what I experience.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.960]  It's what callers recommend.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.321]  It's what guests, you know, it's all a real human experience.
[00:39:34.321 --> 00:39:37.161]  Not some big globalist thing tells you what to say and then I do it.
[00:39:37.161 --> 00:39:39.902]  But then sometimes I'm so far ahead, I'm way behind.
[00:39:39.902 --> 00:39:40.462]  Does that make sense?
[00:39:42.005 --> 00:39:46.787]  Because I'm buying affordable food the week before I start promoting it, even though I'm always selling it.
[00:39:46.787 --> 00:39:52.810]  And I'm saying, honey, put iodine in your nighttime nebulizer and put it in the baby's room.
[00:39:52.810 --> 00:40:01.173]  And I'm sitting there literally with nebulizers at the kitchen table, you know, in the morning.
[00:40:01.173 --> 00:40:05.175]  And I'm not selling it to you.
[00:40:05.175 --> 00:40:07.196]  Again, when you're so far ahead, you're way behind.
[00:40:07.196 --> 00:40:09.957]  I know that sounds like a paradox, but that's very Zen, though.
[00:40:11.053 --> 00:40:13.153]  So far ahead, we're way behind.
[00:40:13.153 --> 00:40:19.815]  Because, you know, you say something 10 years ago, 20 years ago, and now it's just everywhere, and you're like, oh, wait, I was right about that.
[00:40:19.815 --> 00:40:20.935]  I better talk about that now.
[00:40:20.935 --> 00:40:23.535]  But see, it's not rocket science.
[00:40:23.535 --> 00:40:32.917]  The UN says, look it up, there's almost 3 billion people with mental disabilities or lower faculties because of iodine deficiency.
[00:40:32.917 --> 00:40:36.337]  And I harped the living hell out of that, and like, no one cares.
[00:40:36.337 --> 00:40:39.058]  But, oh, it can knock out viruses.
[00:40:40.031 --> 00:40:40.471]  Wouldn't it?
[00:40:40.471 --> 00:40:43.574]  It's contact with them.
[00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:46.656]  See, I'm not a chemist, but I've had chemists on, I'll tell you that.
[00:40:46.656 --> 00:40:53.361]  Mercury is highly electrochemical and probably the most toxic thing to nerves, other than like cyanide.
[00:40:53.361 --> 00:40:56.944]  But see, iodine's good for nerves, but bad for other things.
[00:40:58.433 --> 00:41:02.617]  I don't know how it works, how it's like good for your nerves, but it comes along a virus.
[00:41:02.617 --> 00:41:03.919]  It's like a thunderstorm.
[00:41:03.919 --> 00:41:08.964]  You ever seen an oak tree hit by a lightning bolt?
[00:41:08.964 --> 00:41:14.669]  I mean, it's like super deadly to viruses.
[00:41:14.669 --> 00:41:18.954]  It's like silver at low levels is good for us overall and ourselves, but
[00:41:20.216 --> 00:41:24.318]  To bacteria and viruses, it's like a shotgun blast.
[00:41:24.318 --> 00:41:26.639]  Because it just goes right into how they're set up.
[00:41:26.639 --> 00:41:28.300]  But that's all the things God gave us.
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.101]  So, I'm going to go to Brinkman back to the calls.
[00:41:30.101 --> 00:41:30.882]  I'm going to stop ranting.
[00:41:30.882 --> 00:41:31.842]  I didn't even get to these quotes.
[00:41:31.842 --> 00:41:33.743]  I said I would.
[00:41:33.743 --> 00:41:36.265]  It's just insane.
[00:41:36.265 --> 00:41:38.306]  But the crew's like, we keep telling you for weeks.
[00:41:38.306 --> 00:41:38.926]  Iron-9.
[00:41:38.926 --> 00:41:40.267]  Look at these studies.
[00:41:40.267 --> 00:41:42.068]  The big pharmas are patenting it right now.
[00:41:42.068 --> 00:41:42.828]  You need to get on this.
[00:41:42.828 --> 00:41:44.389]  And I'm like, argh!
[00:41:44.389 --> 00:41:47.971]  Because, like, I've been so much promoting it, I'm just kind of sick of talking about it.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:54.361]  It's like telling me after you play 18 holes of golf and a big old glass of lemonade is delicious.
[00:41:54.361 --> 00:41:56.822]  I mean, it's kind of like been there, done that.
[00:41:56.822 --> 00:42:01.884]  We just need to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:42:01.884 --> 00:42:03.024]  This is their big attack.
[00:42:03.024 --> 00:42:07.285]  And yes, we need to personally take care of ourselves.
[00:42:07.285 --> 00:42:15.288]  And while I'm up here preaching, take your PQQ and your CoQ10 DNA Force and brush your teeth with your patented nanotech
[00:42:15.988 --> 00:42:22.936]  Approved biosilver with other studies I've got from the Pentagon that it knocks out the SARS coronavirus family.
[00:42:22.936 --> 00:42:24.397]  We've got that too.
[00:42:24.397 --> 00:42:28.582]  That I then have to do it.
[00:42:28.582 --> 00:42:29.223]  I have to do it.
[00:42:29.223 --> 00:42:31.966]  A couple days ago, I'm like, I don't have any super blue silver.
[00:42:32.864 --> 00:42:33.965]  I don't have a toothpaste.
[00:42:33.965 --> 00:42:34.986]  Why did you buy this toothpaste?
[00:42:34.986 --> 00:42:37.628]  I think she goes, well, it's fluoride free, but you didn't bring it home.
[00:42:37.628 --> 00:42:39.149]  I'm like, put it on auto ship.
[00:42:39.149 --> 00:42:41.070]  So I just came here yesterday.
[00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:45.153]  I was up here on Saturday, two days ago, and I just took some home and I brushed it with it today.
[00:42:45.153 --> 00:42:46.414]  We've just got to remember to do it.
[00:42:46.414 --> 00:42:47.415]  That funds the InfoWars.
[00:42:47.415 --> 00:42:49.857]  I'm done talking about all this, but it's just crazy.
[00:42:49.857 --> 00:42:53.699]  We're going to come back directly with your calls and throughout the next three, four hours.
[00:42:53.699 --> 00:42:55.521]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:42:57.873 --> 00:43:06.060]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness, and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:06.640]  That's good.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.022]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[00:43:09.022 --> 00:43:16.007]  The average person is living hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[00:43:16.007 --> 00:43:19.670]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:26.656]  And that means, even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there, that you only go to in emergencies.
[00:43:27.256 --> 00:43:32.460]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical, or even more so.
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:40.745]  And things like DNA Force Plus, that's now back in stock, is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.
[00:43:40.745 --> 00:43:50.151]  It's back in stock, 40% off right now, along with Ultra 12, and along with Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and a bunch of other great products that are finally back in stock.

[00:43:57.476 --> 00:44:07.424]  Six weeks ago, we warned you that the choreographed nature of the global media and governments concerning coronavirus told us it was a major globalist operation.
[00:44:07.424 --> 00:44:18.033]  Now, whether it's super deadly or not, the issue is it's being used by the globalists as a weapon against the world economy and against nation states and against the populist movement here in America.
[00:44:18.613 --> 00:44:19.874]  And against Infowars.
[00:44:19.874 --> 00:44:21.374]  And that means against you.
[00:44:21.374 --> 00:44:29.438]  So however you're going to do it, now is the time to get ready and to get prepared with emergency supplies and items that are known to boost your immune system.
[00:44:30.469 --> 00:44:32.510]  They're all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:35.431]  High quality, storable food when nobody else has got it.
[00:44:35.431 --> 00:44:45.116]  Super powerful formulas like DNA Force Plus, X2, X3, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and our Nano Silver line of products.
[00:44:45.116 --> 00:44:50.118]  A bunch of which has been sold out, but a bunch of which is coming back in later this week.
[00:44:50.118 --> 00:44:53.240]  So check it all out at InfoWarsTore.com and get prepared!
[00:44:59.588 --> 00:45:04.791]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[00:45:04.791 --> 00:45:09.094]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[00:45:09.094 --> 00:45:13.536]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[00:45:13.536 --> 00:45:21.942]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breathe air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[00:45:21.942 --> 00:45:29.166]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the Breathe uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[00:45:29.566 --> 00:45:33.187]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.
[00:45:33.187 --> 00:45:38.488]  But the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[00:45:38.488 --> 00:45:46.570]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.
[00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:51.952]  Get the Alexa Pure Breeze today and save big on a world-class air filtration system for your home.
[00:45:51.952 --> 00:45:54.212]  Don't keep breathing toxic or dangerous air.
[00:45:54.212 --> 00:45:56.233]  Get this special today at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:45:58.061 --> 00:45:59.843]  We always promote being prepared.
[00:45:59.843 --> 00:46:03.486]  Having firearms, knowing how to use them, and being self-sufficient.
[00:46:03.486 --> 00:46:05.828]  And learn how to hunt, and learn how to garden.
[00:46:05.828 --> 00:46:07.370]  I mean, it's just, it's what we're meant to do.
[00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:08.611]  It feels good when we do it.
[00:46:08.611 --> 00:46:10.513]  But we do sell high-quality, affordable food.
[00:46:10.513 --> 00:46:13.616]  I told my Patriot a month ago, I said, what can you handle?
[00:46:13.616 --> 00:46:14.737]  I said, I think it's gonna be really big.
[00:46:14.737 --> 00:46:16.118]  And they said, well, we can handle probably this.
[00:46:16.118 --> 00:46:19.121]  We're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund
[00:46:19.201 --> 00:46:20.703]  I said, no, I think this is going to be huge.
[00:46:20.703 --> 00:46:24.687]  I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food, even though the prices are going up for you.
[00:46:24.687 --> 00:46:25.929]  So those are the top discussions we have.
[00:46:25.929 --> 00:46:27.971]  I'm just giving the inside baseball of all of us.
[00:46:27.971 --> 00:46:31.074]  This is a hundred times regular volume plus.
[00:46:31.074 --> 00:46:32.416]  It was a hundred times a few days ago.
[00:46:32.416 --> 00:46:33.177]  Now it's about 200 times, okay?
[00:46:34.398 --> 00:46:35.499]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:35.499 --> 00:46:36.861]  You go right in the queue.
[00:46:36.861 --> 00:46:37.701]  First come, first serve.
[00:46:37.701 --> 00:46:41.605]  But the fact that the orders are so ultra-massive, it's dizzying.
[00:46:41.605 --> 00:46:42.926]  I mean, this is just insane.
[00:46:42.926 --> 00:46:45.709]  We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe.
[00:46:45.709 --> 00:46:50.394]  And then, if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales.
[00:46:50.394 --> 00:46:51.615]  Everybody gets their order in.
[00:46:51.615 --> 00:46:52.316]  We'll get your food.
[00:46:52.316 --> 00:46:53.977]  But that's how big this is.
[00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:56.820]  So what you're getting is 100% the straight deal of what's going on.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.761]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:01.616 --> 00:47:04.220]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:16.711 --> 00:47:18.932]  The answer to 1984 tyranny is 1776.
[00:47:18.932 --> 00:47:34.776]  All right, we're gonna go to Chris and Chase and Heath and Joe and Cornell and Joe and Jack and Patrick and Fish and Jason and many others starting here in just a few minutes.
[00:47:34.776 --> 00:47:39.657]  Instead of doing that long babbling breakdown I did earlier, let me just say this.
[00:47:40.942 --> 00:47:44.004]  More important than storable food is getting right with God.
[00:47:44.004 --> 00:47:48.266]  More important than storable food is telling your friends and family what's really going on.
[00:47:48.266 --> 00:47:51.708]  This is a giant military globalist attack on our economy.
[00:47:51.708 --> 00:47:53.389]  We just won a major trade war.
[00:47:53.389 --> 00:47:55.750]  Globalism was just defeated.
[00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:57.931]  If we can stop this attack.
[00:47:57.931 --> 00:47:59.352]  We just defeated them economically.
[00:47:59.352 --> 00:48:01.173]  This is a military attack.
[00:48:01.173 --> 00:48:02.254]  The left is praising
[00:48:03.666 --> 00:48:06.368]  The stock market plunging, hoping it brings down America.
[00:48:06.368 --> 00:48:10.751]  They're rooting against not just the country, but your own financial futures.
[00:48:10.751 --> 00:48:15.834]  It's outrageous that they ever recover from this!
[00:48:15.834 --> 00:48:19.837]  But instead they smell the blood of the hysteria.
[00:48:19.837 --> 00:48:21.778]  And they want to press it.
[00:48:21.778 --> 00:48:27.122]  And so the CDC held back the testing kits.
[00:48:27.122 --> 00:48:31.625]  So that then they're sent out at the perfect time, because they're covering up the fact that the death rate isn't that high.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.381]  That's my view.
[00:48:34.381 --> 00:48:39.823]  Still deadly, but you know.
[00:48:39.823 --> 00:48:48.767]  And then finally, there's a flood of test kits put out by Bill Gates, the guy that did the drill four months ago about martial law and 10 plus million dead.
[00:48:48.767 --> 00:48:51.728]  15 million dead.
[00:48:51.728 --> 00:48:53.449]  And now he's got test kits.
[00:48:53.449 --> 00:48:55.210]  Oh, he's got them!
[00:48:55.210 --> 00:49:00.232]  He's totally running the whole black op operation.
[00:49:01.641 --> 00:49:03.702]  And he's got the patented vaccine.
[00:49:03.702 --> 00:49:04.522]  He's got it already.
[00:49:04.522 --> 00:49:07.083]  Oh, but they're going to make you beg for it first.
[00:49:07.083 --> 00:49:12.044]  And then they cherry-pick the people that go to the hospital who are already the sickest, with pre-existing conditions.
[00:49:12.044 --> 00:49:13.845]  They hype up the death.
[00:49:13.845 --> 00:49:19.647]  And then it's all Trump's fault for going along with China, trying to save the world economy, and saying it's not a big deal.
[00:49:19.647 --> 00:49:20.807]  The setup is there.
[00:49:20.807 --> 00:49:22.468]  We were 100%.
[00:49:22.468 --> 00:49:24.729]  In fact, I'm on a power trip about this.
[00:49:24.729 --> 00:49:25.269]  I'm freaked out.
[00:49:26.584 --> 00:49:31.208]  I cannot believe that InfoWars has been 100% right.
[00:49:31.208 --> 00:49:34.611]  It is unbelievable.
[00:49:34.611 --> 00:49:43.318]  And there's that big Reuters poll out Saturday, headline, Democrats and Republicans split along party lines.
[00:49:44.298 --> 00:49:45.739]  ...concerning their views on the virus.
[00:49:45.739 --> 00:49:49.082]  Republicans think it's no big deal, because Trump said so.
[00:49:49.082 --> 00:49:52.965]  Democrats think it's the end of the world because they know they want to use it to bring down America.
[00:49:52.965 --> 00:49:54.566]  That's two separate things.
[00:49:54.566 --> 00:49:59.670]  Whether the virus is super aggressive or not, we know it spreads easily, we know it's man-made, we should be concerned.
[00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:01.051]  It does kill some people.
[00:50:01.051 --> 00:50:02.412]  Jury's out on how bad it is.
[00:50:02.412 --> 00:50:08.157]  You got these Princess cruise lines and all these other cruises, and you got thousands of people on a ship and only two die?
[00:50:08.157 --> 00:50:09.478]  Doesn't look too deadly to me, man!
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:18.643]  I don't want to just get up and go into the world, into the world, buy my products, and then the whole country goes down.
[00:50:18.643 --> 00:50:23.184]  You need these products anyways because they protect you and your family and there's stuff going on all the time.
[00:50:23.184 --> 00:50:26.026]  And when a real pandemic's going on, folks, they don't tell you.
[00:50:26.026 --> 00:50:29.607]  I've had my family wiped out by it.
[00:50:29.607 --> 00:50:34.249]  And I've had doctors tell me this is a cover-up.
[00:50:34.249 --> 00:50:36.990]  When the real enemy comes, folks, you're not going to hear a damn thing.
[00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:38.710]  That's what I've learned.
[00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:39.291]  So, again,
[00:50:40.441 --> 00:50:47.388]  The hype, the unification, the choreography, the syncing of all this, it's synthetic.
[00:50:47.388 --> 00:50:50.070]  And the virus itself is synthetic.
[00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:54.714]  I keep hyping that because the hype is, hysteria, run for the hills.
[00:50:54.714 --> 00:50:55.595]  No.
[00:50:55.595 --> 00:50:58.238]  I'm hyping the fact that it's hype.
[00:50:58.238 --> 00:51:00.720]  People go, well wait a minute, you just said better get stocked up and running.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.584]  Because all hell's gonna break loose because this is the big globalist move!
[00:51:09.178 --> 00:51:11.819]  We know it's a crash of the economy.
[00:51:11.819 --> 00:51:14.160]  We know it's race riots they're trying to prepare.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.561]  We know it's the takedown.
[00:51:15.561 --> 00:51:18.402]  It's America under attack.
[00:51:18.402 --> 00:51:26.165]  If the virus kills half a percent or two percent, that's a diversion from the fact that the enemy released it!
[00:51:26.165 --> 00:51:27.766]  You don't blame your country.
[00:51:29.241 --> 00:51:32.463]  If you get attacked, you blame who did the attacking.
[00:51:32.463 --> 00:51:39.386]  So don't let the enemy that's launched the attack sit there and pretend like they're little angel cakes with the whole media working for them.
[00:51:39.386 --> 00:51:44.568]  Anybody siding with the globalists right now.
[00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:52.192]  Anybody siding against America and hyping that they want to crash the economy and overthrow the president is an open enemy of you and your family.
[00:51:52.192 --> 00:51:52.672]  Period.
[00:51:53.493 --> 00:51:54.974]  It's unbelievable.
[00:51:54.974 --> 00:51:58.397]  In no other culture in society would anyone act like this.
[00:51:58.397 --> 00:52:06.923]  I guarantee you, in Mexico, if people were like going, oh, we hope this crashes the economy to get rid of a president, people would unify behind that president.
[00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:09.925]  Because they understand you're betting against our country?
[00:52:09.925 --> 00:52:11.967]  Screw you!
[00:52:11.967 --> 00:52:14.169]  You tried that in China, no one would put up with that.
[00:52:14.169 --> 00:52:15.490]  No one would put up with that anywhere.
[00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:20.974]  But America has been taught to hate itself so much that they're actually trying to make this dog hunt.
[00:52:23.234 --> 00:52:26.135]  Well, we're supposed to be off the air while all this crap goes down, but you know what?
[00:52:26.135 --> 00:52:48.304]  We're on the air, and you're boosting us, and I hate to have to tell the enemy this, because I like to fly under the radar, but record tens of millions a day now, new people coming in, listening and watching, because of you telling friends, family, neighbors, spreading the word, keep it up, you're beautiful, call in to talk radio, call in to C-SPAN, get on live, whatever, just spread the word about newswars.com, the forbidden transmission, because we're here in
[00:52:48.584 --> 00:52:50.865]  One hell of a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:50.865 --> 00:52:52.306]  You are witnessing an attack bigger than World War II.
[00:52:52.306 --> 00:52:53.506]  Let me tell you something.
[00:53:17.657 --> 00:53:20.258]  The globalists thought Americans were lazy.
[00:53:20.258 --> 00:53:21.378]  They funded Hitler.
[00:53:21.378 --> 00:53:22.318]  It was all a big setup.
[00:53:22.318 --> 00:53:23.918]  That's all come out.
[00:53:23.918 --> 00:53:25.599]  Didn't go the way they thought it would go.
[00:53:25.599 --> 00:53:28.739]  They thought we were lazies, gonna lay around, because Americans like to have fun.
[00:53:28.739 --> 00:53:31.520]  The Japanese and the Germans came over here and spied on us.
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.440]  They're intelligence agents.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.620]  They're just out drinking beer and dancing.
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:35.581]  They're a bunch of farmers.
[00:53:35.581 --> 00:53:37.561]  These guys aren't a problem.
[00:53:37.561 --> 00:53:39.502]  Until they started the fight.
[00:53:39.502 --> 00:53:43.402]  As long as we know who the enemy is, we will beat them.
[00:53:43.402 --> 00:53:46.443]  But we have to know who the enemy is.
[00:53:52.799 --> 00:53:57.940]  It's like the German Nazis looked at the Russians and thought, they're a bunch of half-starving farmers that hate the Communists.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.341]  We'll just roll in there and win.
[00:53:59.341 --> 00:54:03.042]  But as soon as they rolled in, the people greeted them as liberators.
[00:54:03.042 --> 00:54:12.704]  But as soon as they started taking their property and raping their wives, they all unified like a swarm of bees and kicked the Nazis' asses with brute force, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:12.704 --> 00:54:16.465]  The globalists cannot win when we have the will.
[00:54:16.465 --> 00:54:18.586]  They don't have a hope in hell!
[00:54:20.316 --> 00:54:22.439]  The Chi-Coms released this!
[00:54:22.439 --> 00:54:23.941]  They're blaming our President!
[00:54:23.941 --> 00:54:31.490]  Hillary's all over TV, blaming Trump, saying remove him!
[00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:34.774]  You choose what side you're on right now.
[00:54:34.774 --> 00:54:36.937]  But let me tell you something, I got a photo of Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:36.937 --> 00:54:37.678]  Where's my phone at?
[00:54:38.564 --> 00:54:40.105]  I'll find it and I'll show it next segment.
[00:54:40.105 --> 00:54:48.169]  I heard back when she was in college, this anointed communist, and Time Life Books had her on the cover of one of the pages saying she'll be your president someday.
[00:54:48.169 --> 00:54:54.773]  And you look at this demon who they chose and that she will never succeed.
[00:54:54.773 --> 00:54:55.713]  They're going to lose.
[00:54:55.713 --> 00:54:57.554]  The question is how bad is this going to be?
[00:54:57.554 --> 00:54:59.655]  Here are the quotes and I'll go to break and I promise go to your calls.
[00:54:59.655 --> 00:55:01.637]  I'm just out of control.
[00:55:01.637 --> 00:55:07.640]  This is Marcus Cicero, Roman philosopher and member of the Senate in the time of Julius Caesar.
[00:55:08.877 --> 00:55:13.560]  A nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious, but it cannot survive treason from within.
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:23.586]  An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly, but the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely.
[00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:30.511]  His fly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself, but the traitor appears on a trader.
[00:55:30.971 --> 00:55:36.174]  He speaks in accents familiar to his victims and he wears their face and their arguments.
[00:55:36.174 --> 00:55:39.535]  He appeals to their baseness that lies deep in their hearts of all men.
[00:55:39.535 --> 00:55:41.276]  He rots the soul of a nation.
[00:55:41.276 --> 00:55:44.958]  He works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city.
[00:55:44.958 --> 00:55:49.220]  He infects the body politics so that it can no longer resist.
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:50.921]  A murderer is less to fear.
[00:55:50.921 --> 00:55:52.542]  The traitor is the plague.
[00:55:54.793 --> 00:56:00.455]  And it's those of us that are the men and women in the arena that will stand against the traitors now in the information war.
[00:56:00.455 --> 00:56:04.556]  It's a Chinese bioweapon with the left, publicly to bring down the economy.
[00:56:04.556 --> 00:56:06.236]  They're celebrating it right now.
[00:56:06.236 --> 00:56:09.097]  If we just get the word out, they're done!
[00:56:09.097 --> 00:56:10.878]  Just like everything else they've tried.
[00:56:10.878 --> 00:56:12.058]  We've got to get that out.
[00:56:12.058 --> 00:56:14.119]  And I don't see that talking point from Trump.
[00:56:14.119 --> 00:56:16.039]  I don't see that from any of his people.
[00:56:16.039 --> 00:56:19.740]  I just see them flat-footed because there's an internal setup going on.
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.401]  But don't worry, we fired the bat signal.
[00:56:23.689 --> 00:56:25.551]  Now, what did Roosevelt say?
[00:56:25.551 --> 00:56:32.579]  It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[00:56:32.579 --> 00:56:41.368]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again.
[00:56:42.284 --> 00:57:09.533]  Because there is no effort without error and shortcoming, but who actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at least knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[00:57:09.533 --> 00:57:10.934]  Pure truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:12.367 --> 00:57:14.333]  It's the journey, not the destination.
[00:57:14.333 --> 00:57:15.637]  It's the test on this planet.
[00:57:17.118 --> 00:57:19.440]  People ask how I'm doing under attack.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.401]  I've never been stronger.
[00:57:21.401 --> 00:57:25.503]  The enemy teaches you that if there's any pressure, that it's the end of your life.
[00:57:25.503 --> 00:57:26.764]  But look at the wind.
[00:57:26.764 --> 00:57:31.747]  If the trees and the grass don't have wind, they die in studies.
[00:57:31.747 --> 00:57:32.628]  You need the wind.
[00:57:32.628 --> 00:57:33.828]  You need the storms.
[00:57:33.828 --> 00:57:34.829]  You need it all.
[00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:36.150]  You need the fights.
[00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:41.873]  Because that which does not kill you, as Nietzsche said, only makes you stronger.
[00:57:41.873 --> 00:57:45.395]  Your calls, all the news, and America's greatest test.
[00:57:45.395 --> 00:57:46.296]  Straight ahead!
[00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:48.504]  Everybody's calling me.
[00:57:48.504 --> 00:57:55.829]  I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:57.270]  How bad is it really?
[00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:59.952]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality, storable foods.
[00:57:59.952 --> 00:58:02.914]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation that actually still has food.
[00:58:02.914 --> 00:58:05.657]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got to package it.
[00:58:05.657 --> 00:58:06.277]  They got the food.
[00:58:06.277 --> 00:58:08.999]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important.
[00:58:09.239 --> 00:58:21.506]  And that's drink purified water, that's pray, that's get focused, that's not be stressed out because you're prepared, and that's get DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the mitochondria and the cells and is the biggest immune booster you can engage in.
[00:58:21.506 --> 00:58:23.868]  The X2, the X3, the foundation, everything.
[00:58:23.868 --> 00:58:28.290]  The Ultra 12 back in stock are nano silver, super silver, and super blue toothpaste.
[00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:29.471]  It's still 50% off.
[00:58:29.471 --> 00:58:34.374]  Turmeric is known for doing a super job when it comes to cleaning out your cells.
[00:58:34.574 --> 00:58:39.137]  We have the strongest tumor you're going to find out there, 95% humanoid from bodies, ultimate tumor formula.
[00:58:39.137 --> 00:58:40.057]  That's back in stock.
[00:58:40.057 --> 00:58:46.361]  And purchases at InfoWarsTore.com are the highest quality supplements, storable food, and you actually get them delivered in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:46.361 --> 00:58:48.463]  So get those today.
[00:58:48.463 --> 00:58:49.163]  The best product.
[00:58:49.163 --> 00:58:53.726]  I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[00:58:53.726 --> 00:58:55.067]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[00:58:56.462 --> 00:58:58.163]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[00:58:58.163 --> 00:58:59.824]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[00:58:59.824 --> 00:59:00.764]  That was a crazy week.
[00:59:00.764 --> 00:59:12.449]  I don't remember sleeping, but... As far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, and not relying on other people to do it for you.
[00:59:12.449 --> 00:59:13.770]  Nobody wakes up in the morning...
[00:59:15.256 --> 00:59:17.637]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[00:59:17.637 --> 00:59:19.038]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[00:59:19.038 --> 00:59:23.280]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.521]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[00:59:25.521 --> 00:59:27.022]  I don't think that happens very often.
[00:59:27.022 --> 00:59:27.823]  It's never happened to me.
[00:59:27.823 --> 00:59:30.744]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[00:59:30.744 --> 00:59:32.445]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[00:59:32.585 --> 00:59:35.348]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[00:59:35.348 --> 00:59:43.335]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com and take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[00:59:43.335 --> 00:59:46.638]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[00:59:46.638 --> 00:59:51.542]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[00:59:51.542 --> 00:59:54.165]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:46.611 --> 01:00:49.733]  And too young to go to war, but that's the way it always is.
[01:00:54.512 --> 01:00:58.335]  I can taste the globalist hate, but I don't do this for hate of them.
[01:00:58.335 --> 01:01:00.537]  I do it for love of my children.
[01:01:00.537 --> 01:01:05.001]  You know, I was never that strong, but I could bench press 400 pounds.
[01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:09.745]  I could squat 600, 650, 700.
[01:01:09.745 --> 01:01:11.987]  And I could not do it thinking about people I hated.
[01:01:11.987 --> 01:01:15.030]  A lot of weightlifters do it hating people.
[01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:17.052]  I could always do it when I thought about people I love.
[01:01:18.973 --> 01:01:22.036]  And I have to remind myself, we don't do this for hate.
[01:01:22.036 --> 01:01:24.238]  We do this for love.
[01:01:24.238 --> 01:01:26.120]  And that's the key.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:32.406]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your phone calls now, and I'm late going to them, so bottom of the hour, I'll get into all the news.
[01:01:32.406 --> 01:01:34.908]  But, there's no doubt our country's under globalist assault.
[01:01:34.908 --> 01:01:35.889]  It's totally engineered.
[01:01:35.889 --> 01:01:37.531]  We were dead on about everything.
[01:01:40.747 --> 01:01:45.029]  I just can't believe there's this many Americans that hate the country and are just all over the news, all over everywhere.
[01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:45.669]  I'm not even going to wait.
[01:01:45.669 --> 01:01:46.350]  You see it everywhere.
[01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:46.810]  I'm not going to wait.
[01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:51.752]  The articles are on InfoWars praising the collapse of the economy, saying Trump did this.
[01:01:51.752 --> 01:01:58.175]  I'm just involuntarily going to tear my eye because I'm disgusted by this.
[01:01:58.175 --> 01:02:02.897]  That this is so obvious and so easy to defeat.
[01:02:02.897 --> 01:02:06.558]  And I can see the President.
[01:02:06.558 --> 01:02:07.139]  He looks like hell.
[01:02:08.331 --> 01:02:09.272]  And the left's picked up on it.
[01:02:09.272 --> 01:02:10.653]  It was all over Twitter without me even looking.
[01:02:10.653 --> 01:02:12.875]  I just saw, oh, look, he looks like crap.
[01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:14.836]  You know, he looks, yeah, man, because he really wants to win.
[01:02:14.836 --> 01:02:16.498]  He's pissed, man.
[01:02:16.498 --> 01:02:22.502]  And Trump cannot believe there's so much scum in this country.
[01:02:22.502 --> 01:02:28.187]  And I don't say that to hate my country, but our country has put up with scum too long.
[01:02:28.187 --> 01:02:33.231]  These leftists come up to me, they don't do any more and tell me a bunch of crap.
[01:02:33.231 --> 01:02:34.472]  I get right back in their face.
[01:02:34.472 --> 01:02:36.534]  And now the word's out that I don't roll over to their crap.
[01:02:38.035 --> 01:02:45.737]  And if they want to throw a punch, well then they're going to get knocked upside their head hard and they've probably got it.
[01:02:45.737 --> 01:02:47.097]  And guess what now?
[01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:50.538]  They don't sit there and run their fat mouths to me in public.
[01:02:50.538 --> 01:02:58.340]  I see them looking and I just look at them and say, because I'm not one that's taking it, rolling over.
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:04.762]  Christ was on a mission to be crucified and die for our sins and he wasn't going to let anything get in the way of that when he turned his cheek.
[01:03:06.448 --> 01:03:21.885]  The last thing he said was to his disciples is, buy weapons, because the next time I'm coming back with fire.
[01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:22.746]  So you think about that.
[01:03:24.517 --> 01:03:27.798]  And the biggest thing these lying churches have taught is, thou shalt not kill.
[01:03:27.798 --> 01:03:29.959]  That's not what it says in Greek or Hebrew or anywhere else.
[01:03:29.959 --> 01:03:32.520]  It says, thou shalt not murder.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.722]  Murder is killing an innocent person.
[01:03:35.722 --> 01:03:37.903]  The Bible's full Old Testament, New Testament.
[01:03:37.903 --> 01:03:39.903]  Somebody comes to your house at night to hurt you.
[01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:42.545]  Rise up and kill them!
[01:03:42.545 --> 01:03:44.325]  Pull up the quotes.
[01:03:44.325 --> 01:03:45.086]  Bible verses.
[01:03:45.086 --> 01:03:47.727]  Rise up and kill them.
[01:03:47.727 --> 01:03:48.267]  Of course!
[01:03:55.876 --> 01:03:56.597]  This is a short segment.
[01:03:56.597 --> 01:04:00.319]  We're going to break for a minute, then I swear I'm going to your calls.
[01:04:00.319 --> 01:04:02.481]  Oh, the energy level was just off the charts.
[01:04:02.481 --> 01:04:11.347]  I mean, 26 years on air with you and all of this fight, and it's all just coming to a head right now.
[01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:15.290]  God Almighty, I just cannot believe it.
[01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:24.196]  I cannot believe there are this many people that want to be global as slaves and throw the best part of America
[01:04:26.761 --> 01:04:30.704]  And our vision and our destiny, John, is to drink.
[01:04:30.704 --> 01:04:31.885]  You know, we just gotta get over it.
[01:04:31.885 --> 01:04:49.858]  And I'll tell you this, once we take the country back, through sheer force of will and through sheer force of oratory skill, and by sheer shunning leftists, we are gonna defeat them.
[01:04:49.858 --> 01:04:55.162]  Not through intimidation or bullying, but just by telling them, you don't talk to me, you trash!
[01:04:56.926 --> 01:05:05.670]  I always promote DNA Force Plus with PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the cells and empowers the telomeres and the mitochondria.
[01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:11.393]  It's the most powerful formula out there sold over the counter that is known to energize the body.
[01:05:11.393 --> 01:05:14.974]  I'm not going to jack up prices during crisis, but I am going to end up running out.

[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:03.040]  We're good to go.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:03.921]  We're good to go.

[01:06:08.504 --> 01:06:09.125]  We're good to go.
[01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:11.987]  We're good to go.
[01:06:11.987 --> 01:06:12.507]  We're good to go.
[01:06:12.507 --> 01:06:13.128]  We're good to go.
[01:06:13.128 --> 01:06:13.748]  We're good to go.
[01:06:13.748 --> 01:06:14.449]  We're good to go.
[01:06:14.449 --> 01:06:15.069]  We're good to go.
[01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:15.730]  We're good to go.
[01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:16.270]  We're good to go.
[01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:16.711]  We're good to go.
[01:06:16.711 --> 01:06:16.811]  We're
[01:06:20.418 --> 01:06:30.907]  Slice you apart.
[01:06:30.907 --> 01:06:35.490]  If she gets your name, well, you might not make it back.
[01:06:41.232 --> 01:06:43.473]  The Angel of Death, Gloveless.
[01:06:43.473 --> 01:06:45.715]  And you don't control that, do you?
[01:06:45.715 --> 01:06:47.896]  God controls the Angel of Death.
[01:06:47.896 --> 01:06:50.217]  And God controls life and death.
[01:06:50.217 --> 01:06:52.658]  Not your pathetic God, Satan.
[01:06:52.658 --> 01:06:54.920]  Ha ha ha!
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.561]  She's got the looks.
[01:06:56.561 --> 01:06:59.302]  You see the Brim Reaper, you're dead.
[01:06:59.302 --> 01:07:03.845]  And you will face your creator.
[01:07:03.845 --> 01:07:04.945]  She keeps her motor clean.
[01:07:11.775 --> 01:07:13.736]  She's a number 13!
[01:07:13.736 --> 01:07:19.620]  When the clock strikes midnight.
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:24.562]  She's gonna turn on the juice, boy.
[01:07:24.562 --> 01:07:26.384]  Then she'll turn on the power.
[01:07:29.042 --> 01:07:35.544]  You globalists don't have the power, because you don't bow to God, and you don't recognize it and take the connection.
[01:07:35.544 --> 01:07:37.764]  You create facsimiles of it.
[01:07:37.764 --> 01:07:43.606]  It's why you try to make us weak, because you don't have the looks to kill.
[01:07:43.606 --> 01:07:48.067]  You fear death!
[01:07:48.067 --> 01:07:55.489]  You know this is a Christian song, don't you?
[01:07:55.489 --> 01:07:57.390]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to the phone calls here.
[01:07:58.877 --> 01:08:05.721]  All hell is breaking loose.
[01:08:05.721 --> 01:08:06.301]  Here we go.
[01:08:06.301 --> 01:08:08.142]  On to your calls.
[01:08:08.142 --> 01:08:13.244]  Let's go to Joe in New Jersey, as they try to plunge the stock market, as they blame President Trump.
[01:08:13.244 --> 01:08:14.605]  All of it predicted.
[01:08:14.605 --> 01:08:15.726]  All of it choreographed.
[01:08:15.726 --> 01:08:16.426]  All of it scripted.
[01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:17.026]  How do we counter it?
[01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:17.927]  What do you think is coming next?
[01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:19.488]  Thanks for holding.
[01:08:19.488 --> 01:08:20.308]  Hey Alex, thanks for the call.
[01:08:20.308 --> 01:08:21.529]  I appreciate it.
[01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:23.130]  Multi-time caller.
[01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:26.631]  I think it's important for us to get ahead of this immediately.
[01:08:26.631 --> 01:08:27.752]  I think one way to do this is
[01:08:28.314 --> 01:08:37.402]  We know when they release those testing kits, that number in New York City, or anywhere, any big city, is going to go from the hundreds to thousands or tens of thousands in a state like New York.
[01:08:37.402 --> 01:08:44.728]  He needs to come out and say to the American public, when these tests come out, there will be a large rise because they haven't been tested.
[01:08:44.728 --> 01:08:51.654]  And what he can do with the overflow of the hospitals, because it will happen, is take federal government buildings and start outfitting them
[01:08:52.530 --> 01:08:57.953]  Well, exactly.
[01:08:57.953 --> 01:08:59.614]  Trump wanted to go along with China.
[01:08:59.614 --> 01:09:02.455]  That was a setup to say it's not a big deal to save markets.
[01:09:02.455 --> 01:09:03.696]  Now we know they set him up.
[01:09:03.696 --> 01:09:08.859]  We now know the White House internally debated all this when the listeners and other people warned him.
[01:09:08.859 --> 01:09:09.659]  And we don't need that.
[01:09:09.659 --> 01:09:12.641]  We need the virtue signal to stop the panic.
[01:09:12.961 --> 01:09:15.124]  Yes, and by getting ahead of the thing, listen, we're saying it's
[01:09:29.355 --> 01:09:30.396]  We're saying it could be bad.
[01:09:30.396 --> 01:09:36.679]  If it's going to get worse, here's what we can do to mitigate any situation saying we can't help you guys in a hospital.
[01:09:36.679 --> 01:09:44.323]  Because you know, you know, as soon as it happens and that hits, you're going to have thousands of people at the hospital saying, oh, Trump's not helping us, it's all Trump's fault.
[01:09:44.323 --> 01:09:47.645]  Oh yeah, because the media is already telling them to act like that.
[01:09:47.645 --> 01:09:50.527]  And again, most people aren't even going to get sick from this virus.
[01:09:50.527 --> 01:09:52.528]  We're not saying it doesn't kill people, but the vast majority...
[01:09:53.288 --> 01:09:54.370]  Don't even get sick.
[01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:57.395]  And so again, but it creates a huge hysteria at the hospitals.
[01:09:57.395 --> 01:10:00.039]  And they've got to lock down who it is and use extra staff.
[01:10:00.039 --> 01:10:01.742]  And that can then bankrupt the system.
[01:10:01.742 --> 01:10:04.286]  And that's what the actuaries and analyses show.
[01:10:05.925 --> 01:10:10.769]  And I think a number two point is, which is huge, huge to this whole situation with the economy.
[01:10:10.769 --> 01:10:14.512]  We have no real infrastructure in the United States.
[01:10:14.512 --> 01:10:14.992]  Exactly.
[01:10:14.992 --> 01:10:16.213]  We were trying to build it up.
[01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:22.238]  China's exercising its power over supply side, over the supply chain, on just on time delivery.
[01:10:22.238 --> 01:10:24.259]  They're using their last weapon at the end.
[01:10:24.259 --> 01:10:29.744]  They waited to capitulate to Trump and then, like the scum they are, launched their sneak attack.
[01:10:29.744 --> 01:10:31.785]  But we can start building this.
[01:10:31.785 --> 01:10:35.068]  There are people in America who create American products.
[01:10:35.407 --> 01:10:48.010]  There needs to be a universal site where we can go to and say, hey, I need this and I need that, and go to that site and work with people who want to hire American workers, who are, you know, make American products.
[01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:54.912]  It may be more, but that may be early chance, even from masks to pharmaceuticals to anything, the shirts, the pants.
[01:10:54.912 --> 01:10:56.052]  We can produce it here.
[01:10:56.052 --> 01:10:58.053]  We just need that infrastructure to start being built now.
[01:10:59.875 --> 01:11:02.617]  Damn right, and we need Trump to get ahead of it with a plan.
[01:11:02.617 --> 01:11:06.120]  Not just saying, as we told him six weeks ago, everything's fine, it's wonderful.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.722]  So China's market plunged, but as soon as it came here, that would do that to us.
[01:11:09.722 --> 01:11:13.545]  He had to get ahead of it so that people could prepare for the worst.
[01:11:13.545 --> 01:11:18.469]  And I'm not saying Trump did a bad job, he was advised badly, and we've had top experts on laying that out.
[01:11:18.469 --> 01:11:24.533]  It's just, let me, Joe, I'm not trying to toot our horn at the callers, but has Infowars not been dead on on this?
[01:11:24.533 --> 01:11:25.414]  Dead on 100%.
[01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:28.416]  In fact, I know people that thought I was nuts.
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:29.220]  I don't know.
[01:11:55.293 --> 01:11:56.536]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[01:11:56.536 --> 01:11:59.602]  They're probing, they're testing, they're realigning their propaganda.
[01:11:59.602 --> 01:12:00.404]  Thanks for the call.
[01:12:00.404 --> 01:12:02.869]  And again, I'm going to say it for the 50th time today because it's so key.
[01:12:04.076 --> 01:12:10.960]  The scripting and the unified choreography of the propaganda tells you this thing is a synthetic attack.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.342]  It's organized, it's false, it's an enemy attack.
[01:12:14.342 --> 01:12:15.183]  Period.
[01:12:15.183 --> 01:12:22.847]  And now the president knows, everybody knows, and the knives have come out in the corporate media and the left going, it's your fault, down with America!
[01:12:22.847 --> 01:12:26.490]  I mean, I got up this morning at 5.30.
[01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:31.713]  And I go in, I get coffee, I'm getting ready to cook breakfast at like 6.30 for my kids getting up, and Mike Adams is
[01:12:32.712 --> 01:12:32.912]  I think.
[01:12:48.857 --> 01:12:52.460]  Look at the hashtags, they're artificially feeding on the stock market crash.
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:56.363]  And I went and looked, I went, oh my God, and it was every hashtag was pushing in.
[01:12:56.363 --> 01:13:01.107]  And it was, I mean, you know an attack, man, when it's going down, folks.
[01:13:01.107 --> 01:13:08.653]  I mean, it is scripted, scripted, scripted, scripted, scripted, scripted, scripted, scripted, scripted, scripted.
[01:13:08.653 --> 01:13:10.475]  Now, what comes in the later acts?
[01:13:10.475 --> 01:13:11.796]  I don't know.
[01:13:11.796 --> 01:13:14.258]  But I've said this a thousand times when I walk in to say,
[01:13:16.533 --> 01:13:21.134]  The mall, you know, and I'm going to buy some bedding or whatever, some utensils.
[01:13:21.134 --> 01:13:24.695]  They always have some fake fruit in the home section.
[01:13:24.695 --> 01:13:27.696]  And you know, if you got kids, babies always go, I want the banana.
[01:13:27.696 --> 01:13:29.817]  And you're like, honey, that's not real.
[01:13:29.817 --> 01:13:32.278]  They get pissed at you and you go, look, this is plastic.
[01:13:32.278 --> 01:13:34.098]  It's not real.
[01:13:34.098 --> 01:13:37.279]  I didn't need to know by touching it.
[01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:39.640]  I know fakeness when I see it.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.300]  Well, now though, it's all happened.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:46.142]  So it's not just, we know it's plastic because we looked at it, we bit into it and it's plastic.
[01:13:47.179 --> 01:13:49.882]  Doesn't mean the virus isn't deadly.
[01:13:49.882 --> 01:13:53.405]  What it means is the launch of it, and the response, and the hype.
[01:13:53.405 --> 01:13:54.206]  This is it.
[01:13:54.206 --> 01:13:56.528]  This is America.
[01:13:56.528 --> 01:14:00.011]  This is a greater threat than Hitler, folks, in 1940.
[01:14:00.011 --> 01:14:00.932]  Okay?
[01:14:00.932 --> 01:14:01.713]  And the Japanese.
[01:14:01.713 --> 01:14:02.834]  Give me a break.
[01:14:02.834 --> 01:14:05.177]  Once we geared up, fuck, give me a break.
[01:14:05.177 --> 01:14:06.398]  I mean, come on, folks.
[01:14:08.274 --> 01:14:11.015]  The United States, you attack the United States, you're going to get killed.
[01:14:11.015 --> 01:14:12.015]  You're going to get destroyed.
[01:14:12.015 --> 01:14:12.735]  Okay?
[01:14:12.735 --> 01:14:18.516]  Of course we can't win a war against people we've invaded who we're wronging, like the Vietnamese.
[01:14:18.516 --> 01:14:20.117]  Unless we just killed all of them.
[01:14:20.117 --> 01:14:23.337]  We didn't have the morale because our own troops were like, why are we doing this?
[01:14:23.337 --> 01:14:27.058]  But you attack us, you cannot defeat us.
[01:14:27.058 --> 01:14:29.519]  What is the, you know, Army's slogan?
[01:14:29.519 --> 01:14:30.939]  Free the oppressed.
[01:14:30.939 --> 01:14:32.560]  Well, I mean, that's not what Vietnam was.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.860]  We thought it was, but it was all a big lie.
[01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:37.293]  But this is chi-coms telling us what to do?
[01:14:37.293 --> 01:14:42.858]  This is the left saying America sucks and hoping for a total collapse of everything?
[01:14:42.858 --> 01:14:43.839]  I've got the one caller.
[01:14:43.839 --> 01:14:45.019]  When we come back, I'll get to at least three.
[01:14:45.019 --> 01:14:51.945]  We're going to go to Heath, we're going to go to Patrick, and we're going to go to Joe and Jack and everybody at Fish.
[01:14:51.945 --> 01:14:53.226]  And I'll just do my best.
[01:14:53.226 --> 01:14:56.329]  I just think energy level's so high, I'm bouncing off the walls here.
[01:14:56.329 --> 01:15:03.735]  And Richard Reeves, who's a really smart political patriot and old-time employee of Infowars, he hasn't worked here in years, he was sending me a lot of great text.
[01:15:05.011 --> 01:15:06.412]  I was already, actually I set up, I got up at 5.
[01:15:06.412 --> 01:15:08.012]  I think I got up at like 4 a.m.
[01:15:08.012 --> 01:15:09.273]  Richard was sending me all these texts.
[01:15:09.273 --> 01:15:10.293]  I can show them to you.
[01:15:10.293 --> 01:15:10.973]  Like 4 a.m.
[01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:12.414]  that are dead on as well.
[01:15:12.414 --> 01:15:15.135]  And he was predicting the economic collapse today as well.
[01:15:15.135 --> 01:15:17.736]  So all hell's breaking loose.
[01:15:17.736 --> 01:15:20.577]  And I'll just do my best here.
[01:15:20.577 --> 01:15:22.618]  It's just the total confirmation of this.
[01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:24.718]  It's so evil.
[01:15:24.718 --> 01:15:27.639]  It's so dangerous.
[01:15:27.639 --> 01:15:29.160]  That's why I'm the most freaked out right now.
[01:15:30.854 --> 01:15:38.538]  Because I've looked at every possible scenario that goes for the globalists the way they think, and it just gets worse for them six or seven moves down.
[01:15:38.538 --> 01:15:40.579]  Even if they add other stimulus in.
[01:15:40.579 --> 01:15:41.499]  Market bloodbath.
[01:15:41.499 --> 01:15:42.420]  Stocks crater.
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:43.060]  Oil plunge.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.040]  Banks hit hard.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.061]  Fed pumps more cash.
[01:15:45.061 --> 01:15:46.181]  That's drugsreport.com.
[01:15:46.181 --> 01:15:49.223]  I mean, and he's got the best rundown of all those articles on top.

[01:17:56.946 --> 01:18:02.470]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:05.893]  Now, could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[01:18:05.893 --> 01:18:06.453]  Yeah.
[01:18:06.453 --> 01:18:09.035]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man, I love women.
[01:18:09.035 --> 01:18:10.636]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[01:18:10.636 --> 01:18:12.037]  You may have problems with her.
[01:18:12.037 --> 01:18:13.298]  You may get a divorce.
[01:18:13.298 --> 01:18:14.158]  You may whatever.

[01:19:59.477 --> 01:20:11.547]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:11.547 --> 01:20:18.433]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[01:20:18.433 --> 01:20:24.879]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[01:20:27.253 --> 01:20:39.992]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:39.992 --> 01:20:41.435]  Well, you globalists want to fight?
[01:20:42.728 --> 01:20:46.589]  You keep starting them, because America and the West and Christendom was asleep.
[01:20:46.589 --> 01:20:48.530]  Now you're pissed, doing everything you can.
[01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:56.272]  And I'm here to tell you, everything you do, just like Hitler did, is going to blow up in your dirty, globalist faces.
[01:20:56.272 --> 01:21:00.613]  So get ready to get your asses handed to you.
[01:21:00.613 --> 01:21:04.394]  Your leaders are a bunch of chi-com and Hollywood pedophile filth.
[01:21:11.243 --> 01:21:12.884]  Let's go to phone calls.
[01:21:12.884 --> 01:21:16.726]  All right, up next.
[01:21:16.726 --> 01:21:21.129]  Up next, who's been holding the longest here?
[01:21:21.129 --> 01:21:22.750]  Let's go to Patrick in Michigan.
[01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:23.310]  Thank you, sir.
[01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:29.774]  Go ahead.
[01:21:29.774 --> 01:21:30.594]  How's it going, Patrick?
[01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:34.376]  You doing good in Michigan?
[01:21:34.376 --> 01:21:35.017]  Hello?
[01:21:35.017 --> 01:21:36.478]  Yep, go ahead.
[01:21:36.478 --> 01:21:37.958]  Oh, yeah, it's not Patrick.
[01:21:37.958 --> 01:21:38.759]  It's Pastor Dino.
[01:21:39.682 --> 01:21:42.864]  Okay, it just says Patrick there, but just go ahead.
[01:21:42.864 --> 01:21:43.525]  No problem, sir.
[01:21:43.525 --> 01:21:45.807]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:21:45.807 --> 01:21:50.610]  First and foremost, I had a couple points I wanted to unpack on the coronavirus.
[01:21:50.610 --> 01:22:06.802]  But first and foremost, you know, any virus that they roll out, anything that the eugenicists have, anything that Islam has, is nothing compared to eternal damnation and a lake of fire that's waiting for those that don't put their faith and trust in Christ.
[01:22:06.802 --> 01:22:07.963]  The Bible tells us that
[01:22:08.410 --> 01:22:12.811]  We'll believe in our heart and confess with our mouth the Lord Jesus Christ will be saved.
[01:22:12.811 --> 01:22:15.932]  And that's the ultimate answer to all of the... You're absolutely right.
[01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:19.233]  Don't worry about he that can kill the body, but he that can kill the soul.
[01:22:19.233 --> 01:22:21.813]  Did you see all the footage that Millie Weaver got last week?
[01:22:21.813 --> 01:22:27.735]  She went to the Chuckie Schumer event in front of the Supreme Court where he said, we're going to go after the Supreme Court, we're going to get you.
[01:22:27.735 --> 01:22:31.175]  And the majority of women were saying, I want to kill babies.
[01:22:31.175 --> 01:22:35.416]  They had like earrings of crocodiles eating babies and were like, I love Satan.
[01:22:35.416 --> 01:22:37.617]  I mean, they fully converted to devil worship.
[01:22:38.197 --> 01:22:41.759]  Just like the Bible says, you take God out, the vacuum isn't a vacuum.
[01:22:41.759 --> 01:22:43.480]  It gets filled.
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:47.823]  And it's a shame that that blood's gonna be stained on America and it's on our hands.
[01:22:47.823 --> 01:22:49.524]  It's a shame.
[01:22:49.524 --> 01:22:50.445]  Well, you know why they do it.
[01:22:50.445 --> 01:22:53.587]  They do it to curse us and bring down God's heads of protection.
[01:22:53.587 --> 01:22:54.888]  That's why Schumer got so pissed.
[01:22:54.888 --> 01:22:57.569]  He said, Trump, we're gonna get you in the Supreme Court.
[01:22:57.569 --> 01:23:00.331]  We want that baby blood!
[01:23:00.331 --> 01:23:01.352]  Absolutely.
[01:23:01.352 --> 01:23:04.214]  You notice he finally got animated when it came to killing kids.
[01:23:04.214 --> 01:23:07.436]  That vampire demon boy Schumer came crawling out of his snake pit.
[01:23:09.721 --> 01:23:20.008]  But getting to the coronavirus, you know, for those, I know you have a large Christian audience that listens, so this is probably nothing new to them, but Satan's a master of blinding people.
[01:23:20.008 --> 01:23:21.509]  He's got the whole world blinded.
[01:23:21.509 --> 01:23:23.371]  He's a master magician.
[01:23:23.371 --> 01:23:26.293]  And the art of that illusion is to get your eyes on one thing,
[01:23:26.789 --> 01:23:28.890]  Well, the real work is going on over here.
[01:23:28.890 --> 01:23:30.371]  You're not paying attention to it.
[01:23:30.371 --> 01:23:35.913]  So, I really don't think that this coronavirus, in and of itself, is the thing to be worried about.
[01:23:35.913 --> 01:23:36.853]  It's just a door.
[01:23:36.853 --> 01:23:38.334]  It's just a rollout.
[01:23:38.334 --> 01:23:51.440]  Yeah, it's the real work of plunging the economy, blaming Trump, and then using the civil unrest of the virus to make it non-political reason to drive him from office, but they're going to have leftist operatives on the ground as sappers.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:59.203]  Well, I really think that even the economy and everything is really part of the sleight of hand that's going on.
[01:23:59.203 --> 01:24:08.066]  I think what they're trying to do here, my belief is, from a biblical perspective, is that they need to be able to rule out this genetic modification.
[01:24:08.066 --> 01:24:11.127]  They need to get the public... Oh, you're 100% right.
[01:24:11.127 --> 01:24:15.709]  It's a cover for the 5G and the GMO and the forced inoculations.
[01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:17.670]  It just pushes the whole agenda forward.
[01:24:18.516 --> 01:24:22.397]  They have to do this to be able to get the public to sympathize.
[01:24:22.397 --> 01:24:31.319]  And I think the best move that they could make, it's a terrible move for us, but I think the best thing and the thing we need to look out for is they need a martyr.
[01:24:31.319 --> 01:24:34.660]  They need somebody who is high on the public image.
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:35.180]  Absolutely.
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:36.900]  Hillary Clinton gets killed or something.
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:38.680]  That's why we don't want any violence.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.861]  And a false flag is what they're looking for now, exactly.
[01:24:41.744 --> 01:24:43.906]  And the public says, well, what do we do?
[01:24:43.906 --> 01:24:49.190]  And then, hey, conveniently, they just happen to have a little shirt that you can take.
[01:24:49.190 --> 01:24:51.351]  And then they've got this, and then they've got that.
[01:24:51.351 --> 01:24:53.152]  And then, oh, they're keeping you safe.
[01:24:53.152 --> 01:24:54.894]  Oh, yeah, the real hysteria is going to hit.
[01:24:54.894 --> 01:24:56.575]  Because notice, we don't have a vaccine.
[01:24:56.575 --> 01:24:59.017]  They're making you beg for it, even though the vaccine's already ready.
[01:24:59.017 --> 01:24:59.797]  Great points, Patrick.
[01:24:59.797 --> 01:25:02.179]  Thank you so much for holding.
[01:25:02.179 --> 01:25:07.243]  OK, let's go ahead and go to Joe in California, then Cornell.
[01:25:07.243 --> 01:25:07.923]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:25:07.923 --> 01:25:09.785]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:25:10.359 --> 01:25:13.562]  Man, I'm just... It's a foreign attack.
[01:25:13.562 --> 01:25:14.422]  It's a globalist op.
[01:25:14.422 --> 01:25:16.864]  The Democrats are celebrating the economy plunging.
[01:25:16.864 --> 01:25:18.746]  How do they not think that's going to discredit them?
[01:25:18.746 --> 01:25:20.927]  They're just crazy.
[01:25:20.927 --> 01:25:21.688]  They are.
[01:25:21.688 --> 01:25:25.551]  I want to plug real quick on your product, real quick for the listeners.
[01:25:25.551 --> 01:25:29.794]  I want to say something that probably you couldn't say.
[01:25:29.794 --> 01:25:35.538]  I work downtown LA, and there's a mall right across from my place.
[01:25:35.538 --> 01:25:38.641]  And it's a mall that a lot of Asian people come in from Asia.
[01:25:38.641 --> 01:25:39.381]  They ship them in there.
[01:25:39.381 --> 01:25:40.042]  They go shopping.
[01:25:40.891 --> 01:25:43.392]  And this virus was here around Christmas.
[01:25:43.392 --> 01:25:51.575]  I have a good feeling I picked it up and gave it to my family because my wife and my two kids were deathly ill, like pneumonia.
[01:25:51.575 --> 01:25:54.456]  I mean, it was like a three to four week deal.
[01:25:54.456 --> 01:26:03.519]  And I was taking your product the whole way through, the vitamin D, the silver bullet, all the stuff that you have.
[01:26:03.519 --> 01:26:05.679]  I buy it every month.
[01:26:05.679 --> 01:26:07.180]  I didn't get sick once.
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:10.201]  So I gave my, we took my kid to the doctor, my wife to the doctor.
[01:26:10.782 --> 01:26:11.442]  Well, sir, that's why.
[01:26:34.099 --> 01:26:37.461]  They wouldn't do testing the last few months because it's all over the place.
[01:26:37.461 --> 01:26:50.088]  Now that the testing goes out and Bill Gates is going to pay for tens of millions of kits because he's going to make money off the vaccine, then that's when the hysteria will break because they think it kills you when it's probably just a souped up, you know, type flu deal.
[01:26:50.088 --> 01:26:51.489]  And I totally agree with you.
[01:26:51.489 --> 01:26:53.690]  Dr. Steve Pachinick says wild stuff on the show.
[01:26:54.935 --> 01:26:56.596]  He really was high-level CFR.
[01:26:56.596 --> 01:26:58.156]  He really was the Jack Ryan character.
[01:26:58.156 --> 01:26:59.997]  He really did co-write those books.
[01:26:59.997 --> 01:27:02.458]  He really did run the Camp David Accords.
[01:27:02.458 --> 01:27:05.959]  He really did run psychological operations for the State Department above the CIA.
[01:27:05.959 --> 01:27:10.880]  He really did, you know, overthrow at least six governments.
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:11.621]  So he'll sit here.
[01:27:11.621 --> 01:27:12.801]  I had him on about his memoirs.
[01:27:12.801 --> 01:27:14.322]  He was just rattling off memoir.
[01:27:14.322 --> 01:27:16.202]  He never really talked about it at all.
[01:27:16.202 --> 01:27:17.763]  And people online were like, this is BS.
[01:27:17.763 --> 01:27:19.203]  There's no way this guy did all this.
[01:27:19.203 --> 01:27:21.624]  Well, if I rattled off all the stuff I did, it just sounds like BS.
[01:27:21.624 --> 01:27:23.305]  There's people that are active and do stuff.
[01:27:23.305 --> 01:27:23.885]  There's people that don't.
[01:27:24.565 --> 01:27:28.508]  You know, it's kind of like if you look at the GOAT, you know, of football.
[01:27:28.508 --> 01:27:31.130]  You can say, well, that's no way that guy did all that stuff.
[01:27:31.130 --> 01:27:33.372]  And I'm not saying I'm great or Pacino's great.
[01:27:33.372 --> 01:27:40.078]  When he said, hey, I've met with a Chinese student, because he's involved in all sorts of Asia operations still with the Pentagon.
[01:27:40.078 --> 01:27:40.618]  I got it.
[01:27:40.618 --> 01:27:41.659]  I got deathly ill.
[01:27:41.659 --> 01:27:43.140]  I had the coronavirus.
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:45.602]  Well, now we know that that wasn't as wild as he said.
[01:27:45.602 --> 01:27:46.122]  Exactly.
[01:27:47.123 --> 01:27:50.287]  I haven't been sick in almost five years.
[01:27:50.287 --> 01:27:52.070]  I took a quick vacation.
[01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:53.151]  My wife, I got sick.
[01:27:53.151 --> 01:27:54.473]  She's still coughing.
[01:27:54.473 --> 01:27:58.318]  I have a sneaking suspicion now when those kits come out, I'm going to be positive.
[01:27:58.318 --> 01:28:00.921]  But I'm not going to announce that now so they can lock my ass up.
[01:28:00.921 --> 01:28:02.123]  It's a bunch of hype.
[01:28:02.583 --> 01:28:04.844]  But yeah, it was strong enough that I got a fever.
[01:28:04.844 --> 01:28:07.524]  Hadn't had one in almost five years, four plus years.
[01:28:07.524 --> 01:28:09.965]  I got one and it took me four or five weeks to get rid of the cough.
[01:28:09.965 --> 01:28:10.985]  People heard it on air.
[01:28:10.985 --> 01:28:14.666]  Bunch of coiled silver, bunch of vitamin D3.
[01:28:14.666 --> 01:28:15.327]  Absolutely.
[01:28:15.327 --> 01:28:17.227]  So I get what you're saying.
[01:28:17.227 --> 01:28:17.927]  You're around it.
[01:28:17.927 --> 01:28:18.968]  That makes perfect sense, sir.
[01:28:18.968 --> 01:28:22.189]  Because it now came out that it was bad in China six months ago.
[01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:23.189]  That's now mainstream news.
[01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:24.829]  You're absolutely right.
[01:28:24.829 --> 01:28:25.229]  Right.
[01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:25.530]  Right.
[01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:26.650]  I want to say one thing.
[01:28:26.650 --> 01:28:27.130]  Stay there.
[01:28:27.130 --> 01:28:27.710]  Stay there, Joe.
[01:28:27.710 --> 01:28:29.151]  We got into all that.
[01:28:29.151 --> 01:28:30.071]  Yeah.
[01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:30.311]  Folks.
[01:28:31.826 --> 01:28:39.208]  You need X2, you need X3, pure iodine for your whole body, but also is on record in major studies knocking out viruses.

[01:28:51.892 --> 01:28:53.273]  We're not playing games around here!

[01:29:56.559 --> 01:29:57.579]  Everybody's calling me.
[01:29:57.579 --> 01:30:04.901]  I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[01:30:04.901 --> 01:30:06.341]  How bad is it really?
[01:30:06.341 --> 01:30:09.042]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high-quality, storable foods.
[01:30:09.042 --> 01:30:12.102]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation, that actually still has food.
[01:30:12.102 --> 01:30:14.743]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got to package it.
[01:30:14.743 --> 01:30:15.363]  They got the food.
[01:30:15.363 --> 01:30:19.784]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important thing, and that's drink purified water.
[01:30:19.784 --> 01:30:20.504]  That's pray.
[01:30:20.504 --> 01:30:21.184]  That's get focused.
[01:30:21.184 --> 01:30:23.184]  That's not be stressed out because you're prepared.
[01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:26.085]  And that's get DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10, the clean
[01:30:26.425 --> 01:30:26.785]  I think so.
[01:30:59.845 --> 01:31:01.486]  Owl Killer in New Jersey.
[01:31:01.486 --> 01:31:02.066]  You're on the air.
[01:31:02.066 --> 01:31:02.646]  Go ahead.
[01:31:02.646 --> 01:31:05.408]  Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again.
[01:31:05.408 --> 01:31:08.489]  And I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[01:31:08.489 --> 01:31:13.772]  So that super blue fluoride free toothpaste and that super blue whitening toothpaste is on another level.
[01:31:13.772 --> 01:31:18.934]  I use the one I use the super blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum.
[01:31:18.934 --> 01:31:21.736]  It is by far the best product I've ever used in my life.
[01:31:21.736 --> 01:31:24.397]  I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now.
[01:31:24.597 --> 01:31:32.684]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery, and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[01:31:32.684 --> 01:31:34.025]  So I just want to get that out of the way.
[01:31:34.025 --> 01:31:35.006]  Support this man.
[01:31:35.006 --> 01:31:36.447]  Everything that he exposed.
[01:31:36.447 --> 01:31:37.868]  Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[01:31:37.868 --> 01:31:38.989]  Nobody knew about Epstein.
[01:31:38.989 --> 01:31:40.290]  Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[01:31:40.290 --> 01:31:43.133]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001.
[01:31:43.133 --> 01:31:44.794]  Go look it up yourself.
[01:31:44.794 --> 01:31:45.955]  Well, we try our best, sir.
[01:31:45.955 --> 01:31:47.156]  They definitely want us off the air.
[01:31:47.156 --> 01:31:48.077]  Without you, we're not here.
[01:31:48.077 --> 01:31:49.958]  But yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[01:31:57.219 --> 01:31:58.800]  Hanuman, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:31:59.940]  What do you think's really going on?
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:00.661]  And thanks for calling.
[01:32:00.661 --> 01:32:02.741]  So yes, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago.
[01:32:02.741 --> 01:32:03.402]  I was getting ready.
[01:32:03.402 --> 01:32:07.183]  I went to buy a bunch of toilet paper and some things before crowds really hit.
[01:32:07.183 --> 01:32:11.825]  And I had my phone, I had my show going on, a signal in my pocket so I could hear it.
[01:32:11.825 --> 01:32:12.986]  I wasn't using headphones.
[01:32:12.986 --> 01:32:15.387]  And this lady stops, she says, who are you listening to?
[01:32:15.387 --> 01:32:16.167]  Who's that talking?
[01:32:16.167 --> 01:32:17.588]  I said, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:17.588 --> 01:32:20.949]  And she just got, her eyes got wide open and she says, really?
[01:32:20.949 --> 01:32:22.030]  I thought he was off the air.
[01:32:22.410 --> 01:32:27.595]  And I said no, and I told her, I explained, you know, the whole situation and told her where to go.
[01:32:27.595 --> 01:32:32.399]  She wrote down, you know, band.video and also infowarriors.com and just said she's still on.
[01:32:32.399 --> 01:32:38.004]  I run into people at the grocery store, at the mall, on the hike and bike trail, and they go, oh Alex, I used to love you.
[01:32:38.004 --> 01:32:39.145]  I wish you were still on air.
[01:32:39.145 --> 01:32:40.086]  Are you ever going to go back on air?
[01:32:40.086 --> 01:32:40.606]  And I'm like, well,
[01:32:40.606 --> 01:32:43.608]  We're on hundreds of radio stations, over a hundred TV stations and cable stations.
[01:32:43.608 --> 01:32:45.869]  We have our own streams at InfoWars.com and BandOffVideo.
[01:32:45.869 --> 01:32:46.750]  And they go, really?
[01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:51.353]  They said you were off the air because they took the deplatforming as off the air.
[01:32:51.353 --> 01:32:53.034]  No, we have our own platform.
[01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:53.974]  InfoWars!
[01:32:53.974 --> 01:32:54.815]  InfoWars!
[01:32:54.815 --> 01:32:59.017]  InfoWars!
[01:32:59.017 --> 01:33:01.699]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:12.861 --> 01:33:23.124]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:33:23.124 --> 01:33:27.666]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:27.666 --> 01:33:31.027]  In fact, because of time constraints, I'll just show you this since I mentioned it.
[01:33:31.027 --> 01:33:33.387]  We know no red shot.
[01:33:33.387 --> 01:33:34.928]  This is from over 10 years ago.
[01:33:38.758 --> 01:33:54.552]  And you can read where Dr. Keith Muller, CEO of American Biotech Labs, is talking to the Pentagon and talking to Texas A&M University, and it's got the head of Homeland Security in here, talking about how this patented nano-silver, Department of the Army headquarters, United States Special Operations Command,
[01:33:55.553 --> 01:34:04.119]  Found with Andrew C. von Eckenbach, MD, Commissioner of Food and Drugs, that it was taking out the SARS virus, which is the coronavirus family.
[01:34:04.119 --> 01:34:11.965]  And that's just the nanotech silver that's in our super silver whitening toothpaste that's so good for your body.
[01:34:12.685 --> 01:34:16.828]  That's in the super blue that also has a tea tree oil and iodine.
[01:34:16.828 --> 01:34:19.470]  We also have it for children all fluoride free.
[01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:23.092]  It's still all 50% off even though we're about to sell out of the super silver.
[01:34:23.092 --> 01:34:26.074]  We've still got quite a bit of the other two there.
[01:34:26.074 --> 01:34:33.359]  I can tell you that Walmart is trying to order millions and millions of immune gargles right now.
[01:34:33.359 --> 01:34:35.080]  Let's put them in production.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:35.880]  I've just ordered
[01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:41.353]  They call it something else, and ours has iodine in there, but it's the same plant.
[01:34:41.353 --> 01:34:42.694]  So now this is about to go nationwide.
[01:34:42.694 --> 01:34:45.276]  This stuff will be everywhere soon.
[01:34:45.276 --> 01:34:48.618]  The 18-wheeler is already on its way here from Colorado.
[01:34:48.618 --> 01:34:50.219]  We'll be reselling by Wednesday.
[01:34:50.219 --> 01:34:51.480]  It should pull up Wednesday.
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:53.902]  We don't sell stuff until it's in the warehouse, like other people do.
[01:34:53.902 --> 01:34:56.024]  It pisses me off, man.
[01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:59.746]  Because our food sales went down quite a bit when we said, hey, it's six to eight weeks now.
[01:34:59.746 --> 01:35:00.947]  The other people are all sold out.
[01:35:00.947 --> 01:35:01.628]  They're lying to you.
[01:35:01.628 --> 01:35:01.948]  We know.
[01:35:01.948 --> 01:35:02.388]  We've ordered.
[01:35:02.388 --> 01:35:03.449]  We talked to everybody.
[01:35:03.449 --> 01:35:04.350]  It's just incredible.
[01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:06.992]  And then the food industry will be discredited because of these comebacks.
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:09.680]  We have the food, though.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.761]  We've just got to package it and ship it out, and it's high quality.
[01:35:11.761 --> 01:35:13.181]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:35:13.181 --> 01:35:15.722]  And they haven't raised prices yet, despite that.
[01:35:15.722 --> 01:35:23.284]  Now, sales have still gone back up now, but it was just watching when we said six to eight weeks ago, and the con artist stuff goes up.
[01:35:23.284 --> 01:35:24.785]  We're just not doing it.
[01:35:24.785 --> 01:35:27.785]  We will sell no wine until it's time, as Orson Welles used to say.
[01:35:27.785 --> 01:35:30.266]  We're not going to sell you a product if it's not in the warehouse.
[01:35:30.266 --> 01:35:32.647]  I want to be clear, though.
[01:35:32.647 --> 01:35:36.528]  All of our supplements, the books, the films, the t-shirts, those all ship
[01:35:37.557 --> 01:35:38.558]  Within a day or two.
[01:35:38.558 --> 01:35:41.402]  We're like up to next day shipping.
[01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:44.266]  Then it takes two or three days to get to you, depending on where you're at.
[01:35:44.266 --> 01:35:47.510]  If you order on a Friday, though, it'll be until Monday it ships out.
[01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:48.531]  We're up to the day now.
[01:35:48.531 --> 01:35:49.532]  The crew's doing a great job.
[01:35:49.532 --> 01:35:50.534]  Big warehouse here in Austin.
[01:35:52.065 --> 01:35:54.006]  It's the food that's six to eight weeks.
[01:35:54.006 --> 01:35:58.929]  And the truth is it's four to five, but we're just saying that because it could take longer.
[01:35:58.929 --> 01:36:12.236]  But depending on if you order some specialty deal or there's a hang-up, and the FDA is there on every batch that's made on these big plants, so they never have a problem, but knock on wood, you just need to put those extra two weeks in case a batch got turned back or something.
[01:36:12.236 --> 01:36:16.338]  Because any big thing where it's Blue Bell ice cream or whether it's Red Baron pizza, the FDA is in there.
[01:36:17.799 --> 01:36:19.421]  You know, testing everything as it goes through.
[01:36:19.421 --> 01:36:21.463]  And so we got to put the extra two weeks in case there was ever a problem.
[01:36:21.463 --> 01:36:23.465]  It's only four to five weeks.
[01:36:23.465 --> 01:36:24.766]  And they're like, don't tell them that!
[01:36:26.766 --> 01:36:28.607]  All I can do is just say what's really going on.
[01:36:28.607 --> 01:36:30.567]  It's a new roasties I actually have.
[01:36:30.567 --> 01:36:31.567]  Don't tell me any secrets.
[01:36:31.567 --> 01:36:34.688]  Well, I have a lot of secrets, but that's only when I'm told those in confidence that I don't give them out.
[01:36:34.688 --> 01:36:36.149]  But they said I could tell you that.
[01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:37.689]  They're just like, okay, I guess.
[01:36:37.689 --> 01:36:40.430]  But the point is, is that you need to get prepared.
[01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:41.830]  You need to get prepared now.
[01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:45.711]  And these nano silver products that we have are the best you're going to find out there.
[01:36:45.711 --> 01:36:46.932]  And they're just amazing.
[01:36:46.932 --> 01:36:48.252]  Okay, let's go back.
[01:36:48.252 --> 01:36:49.112]  Joe, we got to move quick.
[01:36:49.112 --> 01:36:51.333]  Joe, what was your point, though, about the coronavirus and all the rest of it?
[01:36:52.185 --> 01:36:56.366]  Well, I just want to put a shout out to the President.
[01:36:56.366 --> 01:37:07.250]  Mr. President, it's time you take the gloves off and start moving forward with the prosecution and letting these people know that you're not taking any more of their crap.
[01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:10.491]  Oh, that's exactly what I said when he defeated the impeachment.
[01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:15.832]  I said, even before, I said they're going to come back with something bigger, a war, a bioweapon, God knows what.
[01:37:15.832 --> 01:37:17.453]  You've got to take them down.
[01:37:18.601 --> 01:37:19.061]  He has to.
[01:37:19.061 --> 01:37:20.282]  He has to take him down.
[01:37:20.282 --> 01:37:22.264]  He has to, you know, tell China.
[01:37:22.264 --> 01:37:25.346]  I think he should start buddying up with Putin.
[01:37:25.346 --> 01:37:25.947]  Oh my God.
[01:37:25.947 --> 01:37:26.427]  Print that.
[01:37:26.427 --> 01:37:26.968]  Print that.
[01:37:26.968 --> 01:37:27.788]  I hadn't even seen that.
[01:37:27.788 --> 01:37:29.189]  The New York Times.
[01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:32.052]  The coronavirus is coming for Trump's presidency.
[01:37:32.052 --> 01:37:38.517]  Did we not, the listeners, myself, did we not call exactly the scripting here?
[01:37:38.517 --> 01:37:39.097]  Absolutely.
[01:37:39.097 --> 01:37:41.519]  Six weeks, eight weeks ago.
[01:37:41.519 --> 01:37:42.139]  God Almighty.
[01:37:42.139 --> 01:37:43.260]  Thank you, Joe.
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:46.883]  Man, I just can't believe they think they're going to get away with it.
[01:37:46.883 --> 01:37:47.344]  But you know what?
[01:37:48.328 --> 01:37:50.329]  Why do they care?
[01:37:50.329 --> 01:37:57.251]  Because if they get caught staging this, Trump's, the Justice Department's not going to do anything.
[01:37:57.251 --> 01:38:01.753]  So why not just keep escalating what they're going to do forever?
[01:38:01.753 --> 01:38:08.315]  It becomes a dereliction of duty issue, but Trump is surrounded by a bunch of lawyers and a bunch of cowards.
[01:38:08.315 --> 01:38:09.596]  So I really can't fault the man.
[01:38:09.596 --> 01:38:11.797]  Hell, he's pulling troops out of Afghanistan.
[01:38:11.797 --> 01:38:14.378]  He's doing everything he said he'd do.
[01:38:14.378 --> 01:38:15.238]  Or die and try him.
[01:38:20.782 --> 01:38:23.183]  Is it Heath or is it Chris?
[01:38:23.183 --> 01:38:24.043]  Or is it Fish?
[01:38:24.043 --> 01:38:24.983]  Fish!
[01:38:24.983 --> 01:38:26.704]  And then Jason, Fish in Colorado.
[01:38:26.704 --> 01:38:28.464]  Thanks for rolling.
[01:38:28.464 --> 01:38:29.905]  Hey, what's up Alex?
[01:38:29.905 --> 01:38:35.846]  Man, I am just... I'm like I stuck my finger in a light socket.
[01:38:35.846 --> 01:38:37.147]  I'm so... I mean, stuff's crazy.
[01:38:37.147 --> 01:38:38.987]  What do you think?
[01:38:38.987 --> 01:38:40.327]  I'm thinking the same thing.
[01:38:40.327 --> 01:38:42.028]  Hey, by the way, I'm Fish, man.
[01:38:42.028 --> 01:38:43.148]  It's nice to meet you.
[01:38:43.148 --> 01:38:45.669]  It's short for Eat All Your Fish.
[01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:47.049]  That's my YouTube channel.
[01:38:47.049 --> 01:38:49.090]  I make infomercials for your guys.
[01:38:49.918 --> 01:38:52.740]  Between the segments, I make ads for you guys.
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:54.601]  Oh, I saw that funny ad you made.
[01:38:54.601 --> 01:38:55.322]  That's great, brother.
[01:38:55.322 --> 01:38:56.643]  Thank you.
[01:38:56.643 --> 01:38:57.123]  Yeah, man.
[01:38:57.123 --> 01:39:00.085]  I'm totally being proactive about getting a job there.
[01:39:00.729 --> 01:39:05.493]  Well let me tell you, let me tell you, we were, I had to mortgage my house to pay for this year and I was glad to do it.
[01:39:05.493 --> 01:39:08.816]  It was like the loaves and fishes or the widows might.
[01:39:08.816 --> 01:39:13.200]  Of course then this crisis came and now we're bringing in quite a bit of money, but there's a lot of other problems.
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:22.708]  But yeah, it's been amazing how all of you promoted the products out there to keep us on air the last two years under all the globalist platforming and lawsuits.
[01:39:22.708 --> 01:39:23.648]  We wouldn't have been here
[01:39:24.389 --> 01:39:25.369]  Yeah, I feel you, man.
[01:39:25.369 --> 01:39:27.990]  And I think this coronavirus, I mean, it's definitely being orchestrated.
[01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:30.650]  I'm wondering where George Soros has been this whole time.
[01:39:30.650 --> 01:39:31.490]  You know what I mean?
[01:39:54.750 --> 01:40:14.463]  Like, kinda like Dr. Evil and his player, and like, this coronavirus has been unleashed intentionally to wreck the global economy, to kill the supply chain, to take down Trump, and then when they nominate Biden, he's gonna bring in Hillary for a VP choice, she's gonna take Biden out and take over control for the globalists.
[01:40:14.463 --> 01:40:17.144]  And they're even saying that in the news now!
[01:40:17.144 --> 01:40:20.326]  Oh, don't worry if Biden can't talk, Hillary's gonna swoop in last.
[01:40:22.375 --> 01:40:25.197]  What's incredible is how scripted it all is.
[01:40:25.197 --> 01:40:28.539]  We should be able to beat that, shouldn't we, knowing what's coming?
[01:40:28.539 --> 01:40:34.243]  Yeah, I mean, it's straight out of their globalist playbook, and I knew that they were going to pull some...
[01:40:34.744 --> 01:40:39.126]  Like, people, I think, underestimate just how evil these people are.
[01:40:39.126 --> 01:40:47.431]  Oh no, they released a bio-weapon and then used the media to hype it, and then advised Trump with their own people to say it was no big deal, so that they could then absolutely hype it to the next level.
[01:40:47.431 --> 01:40:49.732]  I want to show people the document Kim shot, though.
[01:40:49.732 --> 01:40:51.953]  This is who we're up against, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:51.953 --> 01:40:56.676]  This is who the Timeline Books was saying would be the president.
[01:40:57.799 --> 01:41:03.281]  Back in the 60s, just look at that lazy-eyed, evil little vessel.
[01:41:03.281 --> 01:41:05.442]  That's for the demon editor, though.
[01:41:05.442 --> 01:41:08.924]  But now you look at her, and she is run by something else.
[01:41:08.924 --> 01:41:10.664]  But that's the empty vessel.
[01:41:10.664 --> 01:41:14.546]  A little traumatized, mind-controlled daughter of a mafia boss.
[01:41:16.209 --> 01:41:17.249]  That's who she is.
[01:41:17.249 --> 01:41:22.452]  That's, that's who thinks she can, that's the goddess that they worship.
[01:41:22.452 --> 01:41:25.553]  That they believe can destroy America and bring down the Republic.
[01:41:25.553 --> 01:41:27.074]  And I say, they're going to fail.
[01:41:27.074 --> 01:41:28.274]  Thank you, sir.
[01:41:28.274 --> 01:41:29.915]  All right, let's go to Joel.
[01:41:29.915 --> 01:41:32.616]  When we come back, let's go to Heath right now in Louisiana.
[01:41:32.616 --> 01:41:34.537]  Heath, you're on the air.
[01:41:34.537 --> 01:41:34.917]  Hey, Alex.
[01:41:34.917 --> 01:41:37.599]  Can you hear me?
[01:41:37.599 --> 01:41:38.119]  Yes, I can.
[01:41:39.679 --> 01:41:42.842]  Yeah, I just wanted to talk about, you know, this whole New World Order thing.
[01:41:42.842 --> 01:41:52.810]  You know, it's been going on since the 2nd century when they established the Council of Messiah to force people to believe and see things in a specific way, changing the whole indoctrination of the Gospel.
[01:41:52.810 --> 01:42:02.338]  And then moving forward after that, you know, you get to the 1800s when they put out these perversions of the Bible, forcing people to see the Bible through the New World Order instead of the actual truth of the Gospel.
[01:42:03.328 --> 01:42:12.634]  And you know, the 1980s and the 2000s, you know, Rockefeller, you know, he even admit that they want to establish a major crisis so that people will accept the new world order.
[01:42:12.634 --> 01:42:25.763]  And you move forward and now, you know, as they put all these towers up, you know, pressing over time and all these satellites and stuff feeding into people, making people's bodies feel a specific way and be a specific way and stuff like that.
[01:42:25.763 --> 01:42:28.465]  It's changed and altered how people think and are.
[01:42:28.465 --> 01:42:31.327]  And they want to create that one world society through these things.
[01:42:32.734 --> 01:42:37.377]  Exactly, and use a global pandemic to bring in their world government.
[01:42:37.377 --> 01:42:39.059]  And I think Trump walked into their trap.
[01:42:39.059 --> 01:42:39.719]  He's not perfect.
[01:42:39.719 --> 01:42:41.640]  He was advised by people, hey, play this down.
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:42.581]  It's going to be okay.
[01:42:42.581 --> 01:42:43.282]  That makes sense.
[01:42:43.282 --> 01:42:44.863]  And now they're trying to set him up.
[01:42:44.863 --> 01:42:46.584]  He should see what happened there.
[01:42:46.584 --> 01:42:48.045]  Thank you so much, Heath.
[01:42:48.045 --> 01:42:49.946]  All right, we did a good job that segment.
[01:42:49.946 --> 01:42:51.167]  It took like four calls.
[01:42:51.167 --> 01:42:52.928]  I'm coming right back.
[01:42:52.928 --> 01:42:54.890]  Right back on the other side with more of your calls.
[01:42:55.484 --> 01:42:56.265]  Everybody needs food.
[01:42:56.265 --> 01:42:57.806]  I'm proud we're selling high-quality food.
[01:42:57.806 --> 01:43:03.091]  Elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble, this is something you need on your checklist to have done.
[01:43:03.091 --> 01:43:07.656]  But for me, it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food.
[01:43:07.656 --> 01:43:15.944]  And I had long discussions this morning, over an hour-long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this, right down to the folks who run the plants, to get the best idea we have.
[01:43:16.084 --> 01:43:19.706]  But they want me to say six to eight weeks, just so people aren't getting pissed.
[01:43:19.706 --> 01:43:25.950]  But understand, the last food company, the biggest food company, is now at hundreds of times their regular order.
[01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:30.573]  And they were having discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales next week.
[01:43:30.573 --> 01:43:32.354]  And at a certain point, just saying, we're done.
[01:43:32.354 --> 01:43:34.916]  Because people aren't going to take food orders out ten weeks.
[01:43:34.916 --> 01:43:38.718]  We don't want to sit on your money ten weeks, and then just all the weirdness that comes with that.
[01:43:38.718 --> 01:43:39.378]  Because we're honest.
[01:43:40.299 --> 01:43:40.639]  I think so.
[01:43:56.199 --> 01:44:00.181]  It's really smart to get high quality, storable food at InfoWareStore.com.

[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:39.023]  I'm so proud of it, and I had run out of it as well, so I got it last week.
[01:44:39.023 --> 01:44:40.945]  When it came back in, I was so excited.
[01:44:40.945 --> 01:44:43.586]  It's now available at Infowarstore.com.

[01:44:56.896 --> 01:45:06.845]  Six weeks ago, we warned you that the choreographed nature of the global media and governments concerning coronavirus told us it was a major globalist operation.
[01:45:06.845 --> 01:45:17.456]  Now, whether it's super deadly or not, the issue is it's being used by the globalists as a weapon against the world economy and against nation states and against the populist movement here in America.
[01:45:18.016 --> 01:45:19.279]  And against Infowars.
[01:45:19.279 --> 01:45:20.782]  And that means against you.
[01:45:20.782 --> 01:45:28.857]  So however you're going to do it, now is the time to get ready and to get prepared with emergency supplies and items that are known to boost your immune system.

[01:45:44.545 --> 01:45:49.549]  A bunch of which has been sold out, but a bunch of which is coming back in later this week.
[01:45:49.549 --> 01:45:52.672]  So check it all out at InfoWarsStore.com and get prepared!
[01:45:57.259 --> 01:45:58.099]  Rich in Alabama.
[01:45:58.099 --> 01:45:59.000]  Rich, thanks for calling.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:45:59.980]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:00.741]  Appreciate it.
[01:46:00.741 --> 01:46:03.402]  First thing, I love the turbo force.
[01:46:03.402 --> 01:46:06.944]  I drive truck for a living, and it's amazing.
[01:46:06.944 --> 01:46:11.806]  Coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end, but that turbo force is amazing.
[01:46:11.806 --> 01:46:13.407]  How is turbo force different than coffee?
[01:46:14.368 --> 01:46:19.293]  I'll tell you what, it's sustainable anywhere from 8-10 hours.
[01:46:19.293 --> 01:46:22.836]  I don't feel the jitters like I do drinking coffee.
[01:46:22.836 --> 01:46:26.660]  And it's just, you know, at the end of the day, I don't need anything to go to bed.
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:30.004]  I'll, you know, I'll pop a knockout and my mouth's cold.
[01:46:30.524 --> 01:46:37.511]  Well, that's what we went out to a top developer who didn't want his name on it, and I said, what would the ultimate long, say, 10-hour energy be?
[01:46:37.511 --> 01:46:38.832]  Is that possible?
[01:46:38.832 --> 01:46:44.697]  That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and natural that are time-released.
[01:46:44.697 --> 01:46:48.020]  And there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product.
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:51.363]  So that's why TurboForce has such a great effect.
[01:46:51.363 --> 01:46:54.026]  And so I really appreciate you, and I'm glad that you like TurboForce.
[01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:02.831]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:02.831 --> 01:47:10.796]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:47:10.796 --> 01:47:17.680]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:29.690 --> 01:47:41.322]  There is now zero doubt that the globalists engineered this virus, released it, told Trump it was no big deal so he wouldn't really respond so they could then blame it on America and tank the stock market.
[01:47:41.322 --> 01:47:42.523]  Where is the stock market right now?
[01:47:42.523 --> 01:47:43.164]  Let's look that up.
[01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:49.853]  I've actually got a quote from Henry Kissinger that I'm going to read to you, and we start the next hour.
[01:47:49.853 --> 01:47:50.873]  Can you guys print that off for me?
[01:47:50.873 --> 01:47:53.435]  It's kind of hard for me to read that off the screen.
[01:47:53.435 --> 01:48:05.341]  Dealing with the fact that America would never put up with UN troops invading it unless there was a giant crisis, be it economic, biological, or military.
[01:48:05.341 --> 01:48:07.963]  But the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[01:48:13.035 --> 01:48:16.698]  He's down 1,834 points right now.
[01:48:16.698 --> 01:48:19.039]  This is all being done synthetically.
[01:48:19.039 --> 01:48:24.503]  You can see how it'll drop for a few hours, then stop when the Federal Reserve goes in and pumps liquidity in to stop it.
[01:48:24.503 --> 01:48:27.926]  Then it goes a while, and then it stops again when they block it.
[01:48:30.267 --> 01:48:31.028]  Here's the quote.
[01:48:31.028 --> 01:48:36.532]  Today, Americans would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order.
[01:48:36.532 --> 01:48:37.713]  Tomorrow, they will be grateful.
[01:48:37.713 --> 01:48:47.642]  This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence.
[01:48:47.642 --> 01:48:56.609]  It is then that all people in the world will pledge with world leaders to deliver them from evil.
[01:48:56.609 --> 01:48:58.271]  One thing every man fears is the unknown.
[01:48:59.138 --> 01:49:00.980]  That was transcribed from a tape recording made by one of the Swiss delegates.
[01:49:21.769 --> 01:49:23.570]  Like, let me read it the way he would do it.
[01:49:23.570 --> 01:49:30.033]  Today, Americans would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order.
[01:49:30.033 --> 01:49:32.314]  Tomorrow, they would be grateful.
[01:49:32.314 --> 01:49:41.139]  This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence.
[01:49:41.139 --> 01:49:47.502]  It is then that all peoples of the world will pledge with world leaders to deliver them from this evil.
[01:49:47.502 --> 01:49:50.604]  The one thing every man fears is the unknown.
[01:49:51.257 --> 01:49:58.293]  When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by their world government.
[01:50:00.250 --> 01:50:02.091]  All right, I'm going to go back to your calls.
[01:50:02.091 --> 01:50:07.675]  Richard Reeves called in, long time, a co-host with me, a great political researcher.
[01:50:07.675 --> 01:50:11.898]  And I wanted to just get a few minutes from him on what he sees is happening here.
[01:50:11.898 --> 01:50:14.139]  How deadly is the virus, really?
[01:50:14.139 --> 01:50:19.183]  He's got a good scenario to break that down with the cruise ships as a test example, a good laboratory example.
[01:50:19.183 --> 01:50:21.324]  But clearly this is synthetic.
[01:50:21.324 --> 01:50:23.205]  Clearly it's been launched to bring down the economy.
[01:50:23.205 --> 01:50:28.049]  And the Democrats are now celebrating everywhere, having gotten the articles, the tweets and the videos.
[01:50:28.049 --> 01:50:30.130]  You've already seen them, hoping a few weeks ago, we bet.
[01:50:30.370 --> 01:50:31.231]  They're like, yay!
[01:50:31.231 --> 01:50:32.111]  Bring down the market!
[01:50:32.111 --> 01:50:33.512]  Down with America!
[01:50:33.512 --> 01:50:34.413]  Down with Trump!
[01:50:34.413 --> 01:50:37.875]  I mean, that should be discrediting them, not the other way around.
[01:50:37.875 --> 01:50:41.157]  Richard Reeves, thanks for coming on.
[01:50:41.157 --> 01:50:41.717]  Hi, Alex.
[01:50:41.717 --> 01:50:42.918]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:50:42.918 --> 01:50:54.865]  And hey, the Lex Luthor thing, I think it's probably working, but you should probably tone down the one-upmanship battle with Owen, because the next thing he's liable to do is come out in the Speedo and do the broadcast.
[01:50:54.865 --> 01:50:56.666]  I think he'll bait me in that.
[01:50:56.666 --> 01:50:59.168]  Yeah, he's, yeah.
[01:50:59.841 --> 01:51:01.242]  Anyway, where do you want to start, Alex?
[01:51:01.242 --> 01:51:02.003]  Tell me where you want to start.
[01:51:02.003 --> 01:51:04.204]  Well, no, you just sent me a lot of messages at 4 a.m.
[01:51:04.204 --> 01:51:06.145]  I was already up, and you made a lot of sense.
[01:51:06.145 --> 01:51:09.168]  So get into your cruise ship petri dish.
[01:51:09.168 --> 01:51:11.609]  It's a great scientific study to see how deadly it really is.
[01:51:11.609 --> 01:51:13.851]  I think it shows it's not that deadly, but it doesn't matter.
[01:51:13.851 --> 01:51:15.792]  The hype is giant and is the real threat.
[01:51:15.792 --> 01:51:17.874]  You were getting into all that.
[01:51:17.874 --> 01:51:18.394]  Absolutely.
[01:51:18.394 --> 01:51:24.158]  Well, I think for now, the canary in the coal mine to watch is the Diamond Princess scenario, which
[01:51:24.787 --> 01:51:33.411]  Evidently they've unleashed and unloaded those 2,600 passengers, but basically the scorecard is there were 2,600 passengers on there.
[01:51:33.411 --> 01:51:43.175]  Last I checked, which was yesterday morning, there were 1,900 people unaffected, non-infected, but presumably 100% exposed.
[01:51:43.175 --> 01:51:47.236]  And then you have 700 that were infected, which that's an ugly number.
[01:51:47.236 --> 01:51:48.977]  That's a high percentage of the 2,600.
[01:51:48.977 --> 01:51:50.538]  That's a little scary.
[01:51:51.597 --> 01:51:58.618]  There are only, as of yesterday morning, seven reported deaths, which works out to less than 1%.
[01:51:58.618 --> 01:52:04.839]  That's 0.27% so far, as of yesterday morning.
[01:52:04.839 --> 01:52:08.100]  And I agree with you that that's a laboratory-type test.
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:08.800]  You're on a ship.
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:10.260]  It's a classic example of plague.
[01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:14.601]  And so you get to find out how communicable it is and how deadly it is with that.
[01:52:14.601 --> 01:52:17.782]  And so it looks like that it's a very, very low number.
[01:52:17.782 --> 01:52:19.342]  And it's a couple of old people that died.
[01:52:20.686 --> 01:52:21.327]  Right, right.
[01:52:21.327 --> 01:52:22.888]  Very low death rate number.
[01:52:22.888 --> 01:52:25.130]  So that'll be the thing to watch for.
[01:52:25.130 --> 01:52:36.259]  And I guess the question would really be now is what level of tracking is going on with those passengers that now presumably have been scattered all over the world, you know, including the United States.
[01:52:36.259 --> 01:52:43.965]  But I would just imagine anybody coming into an ER room, you know, they're going to find out where they came from, where they've been, who they've been exposed to, etc.
[01:52:43.965 --> 01:52:49.390]  So I think that we'll still probably have pretty decent tracking of the Diamond Princess passenger
[01:52:50.032 --> 01:52:51.313]  We're good to go.
[01:53:13.806 --> 01:53:17.848]  Fewer very young people and fewer very old people that are going to be on the boat.
[01:53:17.848 --> 01:53:21.729]  But still that high sampling of old people is still very, very low.
[01:53:21.729 --> 01:53:24.250]  Some people say, well then why are you freaking out for six weeks?
[01:53:24.250 --> 01:53:30.593]  The unified choreographed response of the media with the shycoms and others shows you they were going to try to blame Trump with this.
[01:53:30.593 --> 01:53:31.853]  And I think he's walked right into it.
[01:53:31.853 --> 01:53:33.214]  I'm not blaming the president.
[01:53:33.214 --> 01:53:34.735]  His advisors told him, play it down.
[01:53:34.735 --> 01:53:36.455]  Now they're saying, don't play it down.
[01:53:36.455 --> 01:53:38.576]  And the media is all trying to blame the president.
[01:53:38.576 --> 01:53:40.237]  But I want to get to that, Richard, but what about this?
[01:53:41.274 --> 01:53:45.555]  For me, this is a really central point, paramount.
[01:53:45.555 --> 01:53:48.355]  The way they're saying, oh, now there'll be plenty of testing kits.
[01:53:48.355 --> 01:53:50.836]  Well, we all know it's already spread around the country.
[01:53:50.836 --> 01:53:53.036]  We already know it's not as deadly as they've been saying.
[01:53:53.036 --> 01:54:08.799]  But regardless, once people learn that large numbers have it, and then each person has to be locked down, that saps the economy, and it will create the illusion of a nation totally paralyzed, and then leftists are going to exacerbate that with civil unrest.
[01:54:08.799 --> 01:54:09.259]  What do you think?
[01:54:10.888 --> 01:54:21.237]  Well, I agree with you, Alex, that potentially this would be and may be a big economic recession slash depression, but Trump is the roadrunner.
[01:54:21.237 --> 01:54:24.660]  I see that he's got a huge opportunity to do this whole thing.
[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:32.327]  I mean, China has plausible deniability that they've launched this bioweapon, but that means they also have plausible accountability.
[01:54:32.327 --> 01:54:33.688]  Trump could just come out and say, hey,
[01:54:34.537 --> 01:54:39.399]  Trump, you know, could say that China clearly does not like me being president.
[01:54:39.399 --> 01:54:51.783]  I've brought tariffs to bear on the Chinese economy and it's hurt them economically-wise, so they've launched this bioweapon against us to hurt our economy and to attack our supply chain from China, etc.
[01:54:51.783 --> 01:55:01.026]  I mean, there's so many points there to cover, and that Trump could just judo this to say, the Chinese are literally meddling in our election this election cycle.
[01:55:01.026 --> 01:55:02.567]  We've heard the Democrats out there.
[01:55:03.254 --> 01:55:03.474]  Yeah.
[01:55:21.181 --> 01:55:31.205]  But he could get out there and judo this, and I could imagine that most American people, if they understand it and get wind of it, how are they not going to vote for Trump?
[01:55:31.205 --> 01:55:32.706]  Richard, are you here in town?
[01:55:32.706 --> 01:55:34.747]  I know you were out in California a couple of weeks ago.
[01:55:34.747 --> 01:55:36.788]  Are you here in Austin?
[01:55:36.788 --> 01:55:38.088]  I'm here in Austin right now, yes.
[01:55:38.088 --> 01:55:39.589]  Well, you should come in studio the next few days.
[01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:40.369]  God bless you, Richard.
[01:55:40.369 --> 01:55:41.150]  Great points.
[01:55:41.150 --> 01:55:47.593]  All right, we're going to break, come back, a whole other hour of phone calls, a bunch of clips, but this is Hillary just a month or so ago on
[01:55:49.190 --> 01:55:51.091]  Matt Maudow Show.
[01:55:51.091 --> 01:55:58.316]  And she was on there with her boyfriend talking about we need China to meddle, you know, because if Trump asks for Russia to meddle, we need China.
[01:55:58.316 --> 01:55:59.677]  Well, China is meddling.
[01:55:59.677 --> 01:56:02.399]  So that's her hiding in plain view who she really works for.
[01:56:02.399 --> 01:56:04.380]  Here it is.
[01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:07.082]  And since Russia is clearly backing Republicans,
[01:56:08.422 --> 01:56:10.865]  Why don't we ask China to back us?
[01:56:10.865 --> 01:56:12.026]  I hear by tonight.
[01:56:12.026 --> 01:56:12.747]  Ask China.
[01:56:12.747 --> 01:56:13.408]  That's right.
[01:56:13.408 --> 01:56:19.134]  And not only that, China, if you're listening, why don't you get Trump's tax returns?
[01:56:19.134 --> 01:56:22.478]  I'm sure our media would richly reward you.
[01:56:25.216 --> 01:56:26.778]  That was all tongue-in-cheek by Trump.
[01:56:26.778 --> 01:56:29.440]  He knew it was Eric Prince got the WikiLeaks.
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:31.523]  I mean, I told you that years ago.
[01:56:31.523 --> 01:56:32.504]  It was even in the New York Times.
[01:56:32.504 --> 01:56:34.285]  They usually lie if that was accurate.
[01:56:34.285 --> 01:56:38.890]  It was Prince and groups in the Pentagon that were sick of Hillary for Benghazi.
[01:56:38.890 --> 01:56:40.912]  And then Prince just helped get it out.
[01:56:40.912 --> 01:56:42.054]  And of course they now know that.
[01:56:42.054 --> 01:56:44.396]  Okay, it wasn't the Russians.
[01:56:44.396 --> 01:56:46.638]  The Russians are good guys overall.
[01:56:46.638 --> 01:56:47.539]  I mean, they're not...
[01:56:49.383 --> 01:56:50.283]  We did it.
[01:56:50.283 --> 01:56:51.243]  America did it.
[01:56:51.243 --> 01:56:52.424]  We dealt with that witch.
[01:56:52.424 --> 01:56:54.005]  Can we get a little bit of credit here?
[01:56:54.005 --> 01:56:59.887]  But see, they don't want Americans defeating that anti-American trash.
[01:56:59.887 --> 01:57:07.731]  They want to say, oh, the Russians did it, so the Pentagon and Trump and Alex Jones are listening to the Russians.
[01:57:07.731 --> 01:57:10.092]  Give me a break.
[01:57:10.092 --> 01:57:12.013]  I don't do what Trump tells me.
[01:57:12.013 --> 01:57:13.534]  He doesn't do what I tell him.
[01:57:13.534 --> 01:57:14.774]  We do what's right.
[01:57:14.774 --> 01:57:15.735]  Now, it's usually aligned.
[01:57:16.275 --> 01:57:19.736]  But it doesn't mean that I'm sitting there taking orders, man.
[01:57:19.736 --> 01:57:23.577]  I'm not a commissioned officer in the military.
[01:57:23.577 --> 01:57:25.457]  Space Force.
[01:57:25.457 --> 01:57:29.998]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, we got hour number three of your phone calls only two minutes away.
[01:57:29.998 --> 01:57:32.779]  Please don't forget, we still have high-quality, storable food.
[01:57:32.779 --> 01:57:33.939]  We have it to deliver.
[01:57:33.939 --> 01:57:35.440]  Other people are lying to you.
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:36.340]  We have it.
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:37.900]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:39.161]  Haven't raised prices yet.
[01:57:39.161 --> 01:57:40.221]  Get yours in now.
[01:57:40.221 --> 01:57:41.781]  This thing peaks in like four or five months.
[01:57:41.781 --> 01:57:44.302]  Still time to get your food and boost your immune system.
[01:57:47.042 --> 01:57:50.303]  This should really be easier than it is.
[01:57:50.303 --> 01:57:52.424]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[01:57:52.424 --> 01:57:54.905]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[01:57:54.905 --> 01:58:08.371]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself you will see how amazing it is and then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[01:58:09.051 --> 01:58:09.191]  I hope!
[01:58:25.453 --> 01:58:30.456]  Eight years ago I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[01:58:30.456 --> 01:58:38.141]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it.
[01:58:38.141 --> 01:58:39.321]  It's amazing.
[01:58:39.321 --> 01:58:42.904]  Discover the benefits, and it funds the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[01:58:42.904 --> 01:58:46.766]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[01:58:46.766 --> 01:58:48.487]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[01:58:48.487 --> 01:58:50.608]  I love tuning in to Owen Troyer.
[01:58:50.608 --> 01:58:53.230]  I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you.
[01:58:54.079 --> 01:58:59.449]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[01:58:59.449 --> 01:59:01.312]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[01:59:01.312 --> 01:59:02.615]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[01:59:02.615 --> 01:59:03.356]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:59:04.369 --> 01:59:05.830]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:08.532]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[01:59:08.532 --> 01:59:09.693]  I don't want them to win.
[01:59:09.693 --> 01:59:12.615]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[01:59:12.615 --> 01:59:15.717]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[01:59:15.717 --> 01:59:18.879]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[01:59:18.879 --> 01:59:22.682]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[01:59:22.682 --> 01:59:24.243]  These will change your life.
[01:59:24.243 --> 01:59:25.664]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[01:59:25.664 --> 01:59:27.666]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[01:59:27.666 --> 01:59:28.366]  Check it all out.
[01:59:28.366 --> 01:59:30.308]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[01:59:30.308 --> 01:59:32.089]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[01:59:32.089 --> 01:59:33.290]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[01:59:33.670 --> 01:59:35.491]  You got no when to hold em, no when to fold em,
[02:00:02.705 --> 02:00:03.385]  I think so.
[02:00:16.314 --> 02:00:24.197]  I'll give myself a B minus going to calls, but we're going to get an A plus this hour taking your calls.
[02:00:24.197 --> 02:00:31.800]  I still, I've covered a lot of the news, but I haven't had a lot of this, this, this, this, this epidemic news because it's totally synthetic.
[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:35.802]  It's absolutely designed to create hysteria and hurt our economy.
[02:00:35.802 --> 02:00:39.484]  And the Democrats are so arrogant, undisciplined.
[02:00:39.484 --> 02:00:42.185]  I don't know.
[02:00:42.185 --> 02:00:44.746]  But I don't, I don't like North Korea.
[02:00:46.613 --> 02:00:48.936]  But the people are slaves there.
[02:00:48.936 --> 02:00:52.361]  I wouldn't go, oh, there's a virus bringing down North Korea.
[02:00:52.361 --> 02:00:53.162]  Yay!
[02:00:53.162 --> 02:00:58.930]  That's real people.
[02:00:58.930 --> 02:01:00.852]  I wasn't celebrating China being hit by that.
[02:01:00.852 --> 02:01:02.675]  I said, you watch, this is aimed at us.
[02:01:02.675 --> 02:01:03.516]  They're the incubation.
[02:01:03.516 --> 02:01:04.217]  They're the petri dish.
[02:01:07.841 --> 02:01:10.263]  But as of this morning, like 10 a.m.
[02:01:10.263 --> 02:01:30.800]  before I went on air, there were articles, CNN, ABC News, they've been showing them, New York Times, we're gonna get Trump, thank God for the virus, you can't gaslight a pandemic, you're done, yeah, the stock market's crashing, yoo-hoo, yeah, wow!
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:34.563]  Don't they get, just like Dr. Strangelove, they're riding that hydrogen bomb down?
[02:01:34.563 --> 02:01:36.845]  We can show that, riding the hydrogen bomb down.
[02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:46.632]  Excellent pickings.
[02:01:46.632 --> 02:01:52.193]  To actually see them do it, to project it and see they were setting it up wasn't hard to see.
[02:01:52.193 --> 02:01:56.075]  And then to see them do it!
[02:01:56.075 --> 02:02:08.779]  I mean, I've been to a dog show and a rodeo and to church and to a cop fight and I ain't ever seen nothing like this before.
[02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:13.252]  I mean, it's just like, what the hell?
[02:02:13.252 --> 02:02:18.835]  Because according to propaganda rules, whether you're good or bad, you wouldn't do something like this.
[02:02:18.835 --> 02:02:19.436]  Go, yeah!
[02:02:19.436 --> 02:02:20.356]  Bring down America!
[02:02:20.356 --> 02:02:20.857]  Woo!
[02:02:20.857 --> 02:02:21.617]  Yeah!
[02:02:21.617 --> 02:02:23.458]  And it's just, it's not even a news issue.
[02:02:23.458 --> 02:02:27.141]  Ah, it's on Infowars.com.
[02:02:27.141 --> 02:02:31.304]  But it's all in echo chambers.
[02:02:31.304 --> 02:02:36.907]  I just, man, I tell you what, boy.
[02:02:36.907 --> 02:02:37.848]  I am pissed right now.
[02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:40.780]  I said I'd go to your calls, and I love you to death.
[02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:47.962]  This has been the longest here.
[02:02:47.962 --> 02:02:49.863]  We're going to Cornell next segment.
[02:02:49.863 --> 02:02:51.023]  Let's go to Jason in Oregon.
[02:02:51.023 --> 02:02:51.643]  Go ahead, Jason.
[02:02:51.643 --> 02:02:54.644]  Thanks for rolling.
[02:02:54.644 --> 02:02:55.004]  Hey, Alex.
[02:02:55.004 --> 02:02:56.024]  It's good to talk to you again.
[02:02:56.024 --> 02:02:57.985]  This is Jason from Germany.
[02:02:57.985 --> 02:03:07.567]  I moved my family back to Oregon in 2017, and as you can see with what's happening with the Turkey and Greece situation, you can see that... Yeah, Europe's literally getting invaded again by the Muslims.
[02:03:08.368 --> 02:03:09.008]  Exactly.
[02:03:09.008 --> 02:03:14.711]  So anyway, we made out good on that hunch as it turned out to be the right move.
[02:03:14.711 --> 02:03:24.837]  Anyway, on the coronavirus real quick, I think we need to agree that Trump's messaging on this has been just catastrophic.
[02:03:24.837 --> 02:03:27.338]  Yeah, Trump, we said it six weeks ago.
[02:03:27.338 --> 02:03:30.180]  He got conned, he screwed the pooch, he knows it now.
[02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:32.241]  All right, so now Trump
[02:03:32.884 --> 02:03:35.990]  He plays the strongman role really well, if he wants to.
[02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:39.076]  I think he needs to look at ways that he can play the strongman in this situation.
[02:03:39.076 --> 02:03:39.677]  Oh, I agree.
[02:03:39.677 --> 02:03:43.164]  How does Trump turn the tables on the Qaikom bio-attack?
[02:03:43.164 --> 02:03:43.785]  That's the question.
[02:03:43.785 --> 02:03:44.166]  What does he do?
[02:03:45.069 --> 02:03:49.993]  Well, he's got to come out strong, at least on his messaging, and the messaging has to be consistent across the board.
[02:03:49.993 --> 02:03:58.599]  There can't be any difference between what he's saying and what Adar or some of the other people next to him at these press conferences are saying.
[02:03:58.599 --> 02:04:01.121]  There's got to be a unified message, number one.
[02:04:01.121 --> 02:04:04.464]  Number two, that message has got to include some pretty strong rhetoric.
[02:04:05.064 --> 02:04:05.765]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:04:20.077 --> 02:04:24.959]  If the strategy that Oregon... Jason, it sounds like you ate your Wheaties today.
[02:04:24.959 --> 02:04:26.499]  We're going to go to break for 60 seconds.
[02:04:26.499 --> 02:04:31.001]  I want you to give the President a briefing on how to save the Republic.
[02:04:31.001 --> 02:04:33.481]  You'll have three minutes when we come back.
[02:04:33.481 --> 02:04:37.002]  And then, Cornell.
[02:04:37.002 --> 02:04:41.624]  And... Everybody else has been patiently holding.
[02:04:41.624 --> 02:04:45.385]  We're going to your phone calls one after the other on this live.
[02:04:47.139 --> 02:04:50.662]  March 9th, 2020, Monday Transmission.
[02:04:50.662 --> 02:04:53.044]  You can feel the electricity in the air.
[02:04:54.853 --> 02:05:03.060]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness, and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:03.620]  That's good.
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:06.002]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[02:05:06.002 --> 02:05:12.987]  The average person is living hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[02:05:12.987 --> 02:05:16.670]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[02:05:16.670 --> 02:05:23.656]  And that means, even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there, that you only go to in emergencies.
[02:05:24.256 --> 02:05:29.437]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical, or even more so.
[02:05:29.437 --> 02:05:37.719]  And things like DNA Force Plus, that's now back in stock, is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.
[02:05:37.719 --> 02:05:47.141]  It's back in stock, 40% off right now, along with Ultra 12, and along with Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and a bunch of other great products that are finally back in stock.

[02:05:52.762 --> 02:05:53.182]  A total 360 win.
[02:06:04.526 --> 02:06:08.210]  You can't run on for a long time.
[02:06:08.210 --> 02:06:11.613]  I can't run on for a long time.
[02:06:11.613 --> 02:06:14.535]  Run on for a long time.
[02:06:14.535 --> 02:06:17.418]  Run on for a long time.
[02:06:17.418 --> 02:06:20.421]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[02:06:20.421 --> 02:06:22.903]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[02:06:24.995 --> 02:06:39.758]  Go tell that long-tongued liar Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter Tell him that God's gonna cut him down Tell him that God's gonna cut him down
[02:06:44.255 --> 02:06:44.875]  Johnny Cash!
[02:06:44.875 --> 02:06:47.958]  Well, my goodness, crazies, let me tell you the news.
[02:06:47.958 --> 02:06:51.180]  My head's been wet with the midnight dew.
[02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:56.623]  I've been down on bended knee, talking to the man from Galilee.
[02:06:56.623 --> 02:07:02.587]  He spoke to me in a voice so sweet, I thought I heard the shuffle of angels sweep.
[02:07:02.587 --> 02:07:05.549]  He called my name and my heart stood still.
[02:07:05.549 --> 02:07:10.233]  When he said, John, go do my will, go tell that long-tongued liar,
[02:07:11.013 --> 02:07:14.295]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper, if we're following God.
[02:07:27.691 --> 02:07:30.433]  The New World Order can run on for a long time.
[02:07:30.433 --> 02:07:37.658]  Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, they can run on for a long time.
[02:07:37.658 --> 02:07:40.220]  Run on for a long time.
[02:07:40.220 --> 02:07:42.121]  Sooner or later gonna cut them down.
[02:07:45.352 --> 02:07:46.833]  It's a metaphysical rule.
[02:07:46.833 --> 02:07:48.013]  You can't beat God.
[02:07:48.013 --> 02:07:49.433]  There's no way.
[02:07:49.433 --> 02:07:51.854]  Nobody ever has, nobody ever will.
[02:07:51.854 --> 02:07:52.654]  Cut you down.
[02:07:52.654 --> 02:07:55.275]  Alright, let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:07:55.275 --> 02:07:58.596]  Alright, Jason, you're a smart guy, don't...
[02:08:14.238 --> 02:08:15.138]  Don't not say anything.
[02:08:15.138 --> 02:08:16.159]  You didn't say last segment.
[02:08:16.159 --> 02:08:17.440]  Recap it all.
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:19.421]  Because imagine Trump's got to deal with the states.
[02:08:19.421 --> 02:08:20.581]  He's got to deal with the insurance.
[02:08:20.581 --> 02:08:22.022]  He's got to deal with the banks.
[02:08:22.022 --> 02:08:23.102]  He's got to deal with the foreign governments.
[02:08:23.102 --> 02:08:24.403]  He's got to deal with treaties.
[02:08:24.403 --> 02:08:25.183]  It's a mess.
[02:08:25.183 --> 02:08:27.465]  And they've just taken this thing and hyped it.
[02:08:27.465 --> 02:08:29.065]  Oh, you beat our race war.
[02:08:29.065 --> 02:08:30.566]  Oh, you beat our Russiagate.
[02:08:30.566 --> 02:08:34.108]  How about a virus we release that hypes it up and then we blame you?
[02:08:34.108 --> 02:08:36.409]  And then we plunge the economy and say it's your fault.
[02:08:36.409 --> 02:08:41.912]  But as long as he attacks it and owns it and points out that they are the ones that exacerbated it and the left
[02:08:42.772 --> 02:08:49.176]  Instead of saying, oh, it's fake news that this virus is deadly, just say, hey, you're the ones hoping it brings down America.
[02:08:49.176 --> 02:08:51.957]  How dare you root for this to be terrible?
[02:08:51.957 --> 02:09:01.903]  We hope and pray that this is better and people should get sunshine and get vitamin C and get cloyal silver and get iodine and, you know, people just want Trump to hold their hand.
[02:09:02.844 --> 02:09:05.326]  But instead, he wants to tell them there's no problem.
[02:09:05.326 --> 02:09:13.513]  Well, when the media creates this hysteria, knowing this virus is all over the U.S., been here for six months, they're gonna say you're dead wrong.
[02:09:13.513 --> 02:09:15.875]  And from in there, just one button they push.
[02:09:15.875 --> 02:09:17.596]  So Trump needs to take action.
[02:09:17.596 --> 02:09:21.099]  And I'm not telling you this on March 9th.
[02:09:21.099 --> 02:09:23.521]  I told you this six weeks ago, Cochise.
[02:09:23.521 --> 02:09:25.863]  So you better listen to me, Trump, because I'm on your team.
[02:09:27.290 --> 02:09:28.050]  You brought me here.
[02:09:28.050 --> 02:09:28.691]  I brought you here.
[02:09:28.691 --> 02:09:29.611]  We're together.
[02:09:29.611 --> 02:09:32.053]  But you've got to listen to us, and I know you are now.
[02:09:32.053 --> 02:09:33.413]  So go ahead.
[02:09:33.413 --> 02:09:34.194]  Knowledge the crowd.
[02:09:34.194 --> 02:09:36.715]  Jason, brief the president.
[02:09:36.715 --> 02:09:37.256]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:09:37.256 --> 02:09:42.639]  So, you know, a lot of my suggestions are coming from family and friends that work in the health care industry.
[02:09:42.639 --> 02:09:46.321]  These are health care professionals who have, you know, I can hear you.
[02:09:46.321 --> 02:09:46.901]  You're smart.
[02:09:46.901 --> 02:09:47.901]  You know what you're talking about.
[02:09:47.901 --> 02:09:48.682]  So brief the president.
[02:09:49.721 --> 02:09:58.587]  So he needs to create a federal task force that's specifically tasked with monitoring state response.
[02:09:58.587 --> 02:10:07.953]  Because as I was trying to point out here in Oregon, the state healthcare professionals have taken an approach that if Trump had advocated it, he would have been attacked for.
[02:10:07.953 --> 02:10:17.119]  Because what they're saying here is, if you've got a child at a local school that has been tested positive for coronavirus, we are not yet advocating for those schools to close down.
[02:10:17.119 --> 02:10:19.601]  They're actually telling schools, keep going, even if you've got
[02:10:20.021 --> 02:10:20.981]  No, they want the maximum spread.
[02:10:43.143 --> 02:10:45.904]  You know, let them take the fall for their lackluster response.
[02:10:45.904 --> 02:10:49.266]  That's what me and Mike Adams said six weeks ago.
[02:10:49.266 --> 02:10:56.930]  Be decisive up front on guidelines, see if the states implement them, and then he's already put out Draconian stuff, and then it's not implemented, it's not his fault.
[02:10:56.930 --> 02:10:59.551]  He doesn't respond, they say he didn't take action.
[02:10:59.551 --> 02:11:07.715]  Right, and he needs to take the higher road on the messaging and leave the partisan stuff, you know, attacking Nancy and Chuck, out of the mix.
[02:11:07.715 --> 02:11:09.436]  Let us, let people like you, let his
[02:11:10.063 --> 02:11:12.544]  Let his supporters handle those attacks.
[02:11:12.544 --> 02:11:16.185]  He needs to stay on message when he's dealing with coronavirus messaging.
[02:11:16.185 --> 02:11:17.406]  Stay on message.
[02:11:17.406 --> 02:11:19.186]  Don't make it partisan.
[02:11:19.186 --> 02:11:23.568]  Let people in the media like you and others handle the other stuff.
[02:11:23.568 --> 02:11:35.492]  And just on the economic side and supply chain side, Trump needs to come out and reassure the American people that he's taking extreme and proactive measures to ensure our supply chain remains reliable.
[02:11:35.492 --> 02:11:36.332]  Well, exactly.
[02:11:36.332 --> 02:11:37.833]  Hey, we don't know how deadly it is.
[02:11:37.833 --> 02:11:38.873]  Probably almost all hype.
[02:11:39.233 --> 02:11:44.501]  But the economic crisis and the supply chain crisis, that is very real.
[02:11:44.501 --> 02:11:51.091]  And again, why do you think Democrats are openly licking their lips celebrating this and celebrating the downfall of the economy?
[02:11:51.091 --> 02:11:52.954]  I think that's a major miscalculation by them.
[02:11:53.473 --> 02:12:06.477]  So far I can't recall Trump coming out and decisively, you know, articulating the fact that we rely so heavily on China that this should, that this points out that our reliance, our heavy reliance on China is actually a detriment, not a benefit.
[02:12:06.477 --> 02:12:19.461]  And I think he needs to call up the Defense Production Act of 1950 that gives him the authority to put some pressure on local companies in the United States to ramp up production of necessary items.
[02:12:19.461 --> 02:12:20.462]  You're a smart guy.
[02:12:20.462 --> 02:12:20.962]  What do you do?
[02:12:23.261 --> 02:12:25.224]  Uh, I'm an armchair researcher, man.
[02:12:25.224 --> 02:12:26.105]  I just, I read a lot.
[02:12:26.105 --> 02:12:27.246]  No, you know what you're talking about.
[02:12:27.246 --> 02:12:28.147]  Alright, good to hear from you.
[02:12:28.147 --> 02:12:29.108]  Thank you.
[02:12:29.108 --> 02:12:33.373]  Okay, let's go to Cornell in Seattle, the epicenter of the North American outbreak.
[02:12:33.373 --> 02:12:35.756]  Cornell, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:12:35.756 --> 02:12:36.577]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:12:36.577 --> 02:12:39.280]  I'm feeling the fire!
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:40.201]  I can feel it too, man.
[02:12:40.201 --> 02:12:41.622]  America's under attack.
[02:12:41.622 --> 02:12:43.424]  This is, they admit it.
[02:12:44.995 --> 02:12:45.716]  Oh, I agree.
[02:12:45.716 --> 02:13:00.168]  I just want to go back to what Patrick says, that we serve the Lord of Lords, King of Kings, and in 2016, when everyone thought Trump was going to lose, we were praying, fasting, because we needed something better for the nation, and that's what's going to happen right now.
[02:13:00.168 --> 02:13:08.054]  Christians are going to pray, we're going to fast, and this is all a hoax, not a, you know, the hysteria around it is just blown up.
[02:13:08.054 --> 02:13:10.596]  You look at South Korea, 0.7%, you know, death rate.
[02:13:13.337 --> 02:13:18.898]  Move in, you know, test 15,000 a day and America can't do more than 1,000?
[02:13:18.898 --> 02:13:22.279]  Like, this is ridiculous.
[02:13:22.279 --> 02:13:26.040]  What do you think's going on, Cornell?
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:34.282]  You know, going back, you know, I'm from Seattle and, you know, like you said, the epicenter, Kirkland over here where the CARES Center was.
[02:13:35.236 --> 02:13:37.277]  You know, the employees haven't even been tested.
[02:13:37.277 --> 02:13:41.838]  180 employees, 70 have symptoms, not all of them are getting tests.
[02:13:41.838 --> 02:13:46.679]  People are wondering, why haven't they gotten tests yet?
[02:13:46.679 --> 02:13:49.260]  But don't worry, Bill Gates has tests.
[02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:52.280]  That's because they sabotaged it early so the U.S.
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:14:00.843]  wouldn't have solidarity with China or others, so that later it comes, once the worldwide hysteria is worse, and then Trump gets blamed.
[02:14:00.843 --> 02:14:01.623]  I agree, I agree.
[02:14:02.259 --> 02:14:07.484]  I know someone first-handedly gave CPR to someone that had COVID-19.
[02:14:07.484 --> 02:14:08.444]  Were they tested?
[02:14:08.444 --> 02:14:08.685]  No.
[02:14:08.685 --> 02:14:10.106]  Was the family tested?
[02:14:10.106 --> 02:14:10.746]  No.
[02:14:10.746 --> 02:14:17.452]  You go into someone in isolation that has tuberculosis and you're getting tested right away.
[02:14:17.452 --> 02:14:19.554]  Why isn't that the same with this virus?
[02:14:19.554 --> 02:14:21.576]  Because they know it's already all over the U.S.
[02:14:21.576 --> 02:14:23.097]  and I don't think it's as deadly as they think.
[02:14:23.097 --> 02:14:24.759]  Thank you.
[02:14:26.232 --> 02:14:29.434]  But people say, well, you're saying it's not as deadly as they're saying.
[02:14:29.434 --> 02:14:30.515]  Why are you saying freak out?
[02:14:30.515 --> 02:14:32.636]  Because it's a synthetic move.
[02:14:32.636 --> 02:14:34.857]  The hype, the globalists are making their move.
[02:14:34.857 --> 02:14:37.279]  Get ready because of that.
[02:14:37.279 --> 02:14:45.884]  Get ready because this is their big move and back the president, back the republic, and point out that it's China that had a man-made bioweapon.
[02:14:45.884 --> 02:14:48.246]  Well, what if we had 180,000 people tested like South Korea?
[02:14:50.777 --> 02:14:55.500]  Or over that, and we found out that the death rate was actually a lot less.
[02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:56.860]  Oh, you just reversed the script.
[02:14:56.860 --> 02:14:57.681]  You're right.
[02:14:57.681 --> 02:15:01.123]  They don't want mass testing not to cover it up.
[02:15:01.123 --> 02:15:02.784]  Not Trump, it's the bureaucracy.
[02:15:02.784 --> 02:15:08.147]  But because it's not that deadly, and mass testing would prove it wasn't, and that would end the hype.
[02:15:08.147 --> 02:15:10.308]  Oh, that's why I love callers.
[02:15:10.308 --> 02:15:13.550]  Oh, say that again.
[02:15:13.550 --> 02:15:14.250]  Say that again.
[02:15:14.250 --> 02:15:17.972]  Why aren't they putting out tests like South Korea?
[02:15:17.972 --> 02:15:19.473]  If we could take them for an example.
[02:15:20.109 --> 02:15:26.690]  And then the death rate would be a lot lower because we'd see how many people have the disease as well as, you know.
[02:15:27.885 --> 02:15:28.425]  No, that's it.
[02:15:28.425 --> 02:15:44.611]  They're suppressing the kits, you could say, not to cover up the infections, but to show the infections were already here, and that there's very low death rate, which ends the hysteria, which they're using against the economy and President Trump, and that's why we take calls.
[02:15:44.611 --> 02:15:49.853]  Cornell, we've had a lot of amazing callers, but that was the most important statement of the day.
[02:15:49.853 --> 02:15:51.594]  That was profound.
[02:15:53.787 --> 02:15:55.048]  Maybe not today.
[02:15:55.048 --> 02:15:56.349]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:15:56.349 --> 02:16:00.092]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:00.092 --> 02:16:01.172]  Forget bunkers.
[02:16:01.172 --> 02:16:02.994]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[02:16:02.994 --> 02:16:04.715]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:47.389]  InfoWareStore.com.
[02:18:48.650 --> 02:18:56.237]  Real stuff, man.
[02:18:56.237 --> 02:18:57.638]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[02:18:57.638 --> 02:19:02.883]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[02:19:02.883 --> 02:19:05.745]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[02:19:05.745 --> 02:19:07.447]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[02:19:07.447 --> 02:19:11.250]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[02:19:11.250 --> 02:19:14.493]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[02:19:14.853 --> 02:19:16.314]  Twenty different stickers.
[02:19:16.314 --> 02:19:17.934]  Impeach the Democrats.
[02:19:17.934 --> 02:19:19.014]  Save the Second Amendment.
[02:19:19.014 --> 02:19:20.095]  Defend the First Amendment.
[02:19:20.095 --> 02:19:21.435]  Infowars.com.
[02:19:21.435 --> 02:19:23.616]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[02:19:23.616 --> 02:19:28.378]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[02:19:28.378 --> 02:19:29.958]  People say, why are you doing this?
[02:19:29.958 --> 02:19:30.478]  What's happening?
[02:19:30.478 --> 02:19:31.979]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[02:19:32.619 --> 02:19:34.100]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:37.423]  And Dr. Pucinich, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[02:19:37.423 --> 02:19:38.423]  It's brilliant.
[02:19:38.423 --> 02:19:45.509]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that's silence, and made it into a weapon.
[02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:48.451]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[02:19:48.451 --> 02:19:51.273]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[02:19:51.273 --> 02:19:57.598]  Silence.
[02:19:57.598 --> 02:20:00.240]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:14.782 --> 02:20:21.051]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:52.054 --> 02:20:53.875]  Okay, I was almost late.
[02:20:53.875 --> 02:21:08.747]  Well, I was 30 seconds late getting back in here because I was in a meeting with a research scientist, a chemist, and then our marketing guys, and we have an expert in supplements, and they're like, hey, you need to come to this meeting.
[02:21:08.747 --> 02:21:10.188]  So I was in there like four minutes, they're like, um...
[02:21:11.417 --> 02:21:15.440]  We told you a few weeks ago we're selling record amounts of our clean atomic iodine.
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:18.622]  We have the only deep-earth crystal iodine you're going to find out there, X2.
[02:21:18.622 --> 02:21:24.326]  X3 has some of that and the other two types of iodine that some people can't absorb, only the pure atomic iodine.
[02:21:24.326 --> 02:21:27.368]  Everybody else calls their iodine atomic iodine, but that's not the case.
[02:21:27.368 --> 02:21:33.693]  It's this other type of iodine that's bound to other members of the periodic table.
[02:21:33.693 --> 02:21:40.538]  We'll leave it to you with that because no one wants to go through the DEA and have a DEA-controlled facility
[02:21:41.803 --> 02:21:47.125]  That you got to pay for every year at your factory and then DEA inspections every quarter.
[02:21:47.125 --> 02:21:48.806]  We did that!
[02:21:48.806 --> 02:21:52.427]  We just wanted to have the best iodine for you.
[02:21:52.427 --> 02:21:53.448]  So I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:21:53.448 --> 02:21:57.390]  This was not a planned plug.
[02:21:57.390 --> 02:22:03.172]  And I was researching this this morning.
[02:22:03.172 --> 02:22:06.653]  And I wasn't going to get to this yet, but I'm just going to cover this now because this is news.
[02:22:09.042 --> 02:22:11.383]  This isn't just a plug of products, this is news.
[02:22:11.383 --> 02:22:19.986]  Remember six, seven weeks ago, I came to you and I said, we have the biggest swearable foods company in the United States, the most respected.
[02:22:19.986 --> 02:22:21.427]  FEMA just tried to buy all their food out.
[02:22:21.427 --> 02:22:25.288]  It was actually the Office of Procurement or whatever, but it was for FEMA.
[02:22:25.288 --> 02:22:27.569]  The letter we got was technically from them.
[02:22:27.569 --> 02:22:29.650]  And they said no, but everybody else had sold out.
[02:22:29.650 --> 02:22:32.651]  So other people that said they had swearable food didn't really have it.
[02:22:32.651 --> 02:22:33.111]  We did.
[02:22:33.111 --> 02:22:34.452]  We said to package it and get it out.
[02:22:34.452 --> 02:22:36.693]  We still do.
[02:22:36.693 --> 02:22:37.573]  Dr. McCamp shot, please.
[02:22:41.363 --> 02:22:46.467]  They've been, for weeks, telling me, hey, we're selling three times as much iodine, we're gonna sell out.
[02:22:46.467 --> 02:22:48.468]  And I said, that's not a problem.
[02:22:48.468 --> 02:22:57.594]  Call up the manufacturer in Utah, and the other one in Arizona, and tell them double production.
[02:22:57.594 --> 02:22:59.196]  Well, they just got off the phone with them.
[02:22:59.196 --> 02:23:00.276]  Well, they've been talking to them all day.
[02:23:00.276 --> 02:23:02.398]  It was the third phone call.
[02:23:02.398 --> 02:23:05.940]  They talked to them this morning, they go, yeah, we're glad you called about ramping up production.
[02:23:05.940 --> 02:23:07.862]  We have federal agencies calling us.
[02:23:09.175 --> 02:23:14.517]  By the second call, the feds are threatening them.
[02:23:14.517 --> 02:23:18.218]  Saying, you have a strategic stockpile.
[02:23:18.218 --> 02:23:19.859]  And they're like, well, who's your boss?
[02:23:19.859 --> 02:23:21.960]  What's the, is there a court order?
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:25.221]  That's how hysterical this has gotten.
[02:23:25.221 --> 02:23:29.702]  People keep asking, how do we have the nanotech silver that the Pentagon authorized and everybody went on wants?
[02:23:29.702 --> 02:23:30.763]  Because that's what we do.
[02:23:32.489 --> 02:23:34.850]  How do we have the iodine nobody else has?
[02:23:34.850 --> 02:23:36.931]  How do we know Trump was gonna win when nobody else did?
[02:23:36.931 --> 02:23:38.852]  How do we expose they were coming after us with this?
[02:23:38.852 --> 02:23:41.714]  Because we're in the zeitgeist, we're blessed by God.
[02:23:41.714 --> 02:23:42.734]  This is what I do.
[02:23:42.734 --> 02:23:44.755]  I don't watch football all day.
[02:23:44.755 --> 02:23:48.497]  I don't sit there and like act trendy and know all the Hollywood stuff.
[02:23:48.497 --> 02:23:51.279]  I don't even know, I don't even go to see movies anymore.
[02:23:51.279 --> 02:23:53.320]  I don't even give a damn about it.
[02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:55.301]  But I live in this world of reality.
[02:24:00.020 --> 02:24:01.601]  So let me show TV viewers this.
[02:24:01.601 --> 02:24:03.642]  Radio listeners can pull this up.
[02:24:03.642 --> 02:24:05.803]  This is out of a Financial Review newspaper.
[02:24:05.803 --> 02:24:09.445]  Melbourne company creates nasal spray for coronavirus.
[02:24:09.445 --> 02:24:10.765]  It's getting approved in Australia.
[02:24:10.765 --> 02:24:12.606]  They're looking at approving it here in the U.S.
[02:24:12.606 --> 02:24:17.248]  And it shows how in these studies it knocks out coronavirus.
[02:24:17.248 --> 02:24:18.529]  And here it is, a big study.
[02:24:20.660 --> 02:24:26.643]  SARS coronavirus by means of, that name means raw iodine that's bound.
[02:24:26.643 --> 02:24:27.664]  We have the clean one.
[02:24:27.664 --> 02:24:31.186]  Physical conditions and chemical reagents.
[02:24:31.186 --> 02:24:34.687]  And it's a huge study on how it kills it.
[02:24:34.687 --> 02:24:36.869]  Not just on the surface, in the blood.
[02:24:36.869 --> 02:24:40.851]  Infectious disease management control with iodine.
[02:24:40.851 --> 02:24:42.652]  Inside the body.
[02:24:42.652 --> 02:24:45.893]  So, this morning I'm like, hey, write an ad up, I'm gonna plug this.
[02:24:45.893 --> 02:24:48.915]  Well, they got the ad done like an hour ago, but
[02:24:50.543 --> 02:24:52.664]  That's not the issue.
[02:24:52.664 --> 02:24:55.785]  The issue is, just like when I'm like, what?
[02:24:55.785 --> 02:25:00.688]  FEMA's trying to buy up all the food in the country and it is six weeks ago.
[02:25:00.688 --> 02:25:02.028]  I said, this must be big.
[02:25:02.028 --> 02:25:03.789]  This is gonna be huge.
[02:25:03.789 --> 02:25:06.891]  It's a bellwether.
[02:25:06.891 --> 02:25:09.372]  It's an example.
[02:25:09.372 --> 02:25:14.474]  Let's say you live near a military base and you see all the riot police get ready and loading their guns.
[02:25:14.474 --> 02:25:15.655]  I mean, you don't know what's going on.
[02:25:15.655 --> 02:25:16.635]  Is it a drill?
[02:25:16.635 --> 02:25:17.155]  Is it real?
[02:25:17.155 --> 02:25:17.736]  But let's say
[02:25:18.886 --> 02:25:19.987]  Riots are already going on.
[02:25:19.987 --> 02:25:21.588]  Let's say cities are on fire.
[02:25:21.588 --> 02:25:22.709]  You see troops getting ready.
[02:25:22.709 --> 02:25:25.670]  You know, oh, okay, something big's going down.
[02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:26.891]  It's human intelligence.
[02:25:26.891 --> 02:25:30.554]  It's grassroots, the most important type.
[02:25:30.554 --> 02:25:42.581]  The nano silver that we get from the top company, they're calling us going, if you want another order in, Walmart just taking everything over.
[02:25:42.581 --> 02:25:45.083]  See, I'm not going to say the private stuff, but
[02:25:46.243 --> 02:25:49.884]  And then now we're like, oh yeah, just double the iodine production.
[02:25:49.884 --> 02:25:50.384]  Oh, sorry.
[02:25:50.384 --> 02:25:59.926]  Do you know why Homeless Security is threatening us saying that they may just commandeer our plant?
[02:25:59.926 --> 02:26:04.687]  Yeah, I want to sell products and fund our operation and stay on air and kick the globalist ass and hire a bunch of reporters.
[02:26:04.687 --> 02:26:06.267]  That's important to me.
[02:26:06.267 --> 02:26:12.088]  But that's secondary to what is going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:13.976 --> 02:26:16.517]  I mean, I'm calling my nanotech silver people.
[02:26:16.517 --> 02:26:17.817]  It's getting all bought up.
[02:26:17.817 --> 02:26:19.237]  I'm calling my iodine people.
[02:26:19.237 --> 02:26:21.418]  It's all getting... The government's like threatening them.
[02:26:21.418 --> 02:26:24.279]  You're going to give us that iodine.
[02:26:24.279 --> 02:26:26.239]  Because it's atomic.
[02:26:26.239 --> 02:26:27.400]  It's crystal.
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:28.940]  I paid to have it mined.
[02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:31.361]  My million dollar contracts paid for that.
[02:26:33.595 --> 02:26:36.437]  You don't just think Easter bunnies just get that, do you?
[02:26:36.437 --> 02:26:42.381]  You gotta pay the oil companies on their way down, the gas companies, at 10,000 feet, 7,000 to 12,000 feet.
[02:26:42.381 --> 02:26:48.165]  You gotta pay for them to extract it and pay to have it taken out, which is expensive for them.
[02:26:48.165 --> 02:26:50.346]  You're like, my God, they'd want a million dollars right on sale.
[02:26:50.346 --> 02:26:52.488]  No, compared to oil and gas, it's nothing.
[02:26:52.488 --> 02:26:54.009]  Millions a day just to drill those suckers.
[02:26:55.051 --> 02:26:56.232]  You want them to extract it?
[02:26:56.232 --> 02:26:57.212]  You got to beg them.
[02:26:57.212 --> 02:26:59.773]  And then they'll get their engineers and they'll grab it and give it to you.
[02:26:59.773 --> 02:27:00.893]  And it's like these crystals.
[02:27:00.893 --> 02:27:06.756]  And if you throw one on the ground, just like I dream of Jeannie, purple smoke, it eats holes through things.
[02:27:06.756 --> 02:27:09.077]  But once you put the palm oil, it's totally different for your body.
[02:27:09.077 --> 02:27:13.119]  Your body just takes it in like Superman takes in our yellow sun.
[02:27:13.119 --> 02:27:14.699]  It's amazing.
[02:27:14.699 --> 02:27:15.640]  And we have the X2.
[02:27:17.728 --> 02:27:19.829]  X3 is not a lowly product.
[02:27:19.829 --> 02:27:21.789]  It's just the Deep Earth Crystal and two others.
[02:27:21.789 --> 02:27:26.431]  Because again, some people cannot absorb what the engineers and scientists tell me.
[02:27:26.431 --> 02:27:31.232]  The pure iodine, without the other iodines in it, and they're still excellent.
[02:27:31.232 --> 02:27:33.833]  But, my point is, all hell's breaking loose right now.
[02:27:33.833 --> 02:27:35.374]  I mean, here's the ad I'm going to cut later.
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:39.641]  Mainstream science confirms iodine kills coronavirus family.
[02:27:39.641 --> 02:27:44.342]  Mainstream science has been researching the effects of iodine for 100 years.
[02:27:44.342 --> 02:27:53.524]  We have discovered key research that shows how forms of iodine are highly effective against the coronavirus family, Ebola and others.
[02:27:53.524 --> 02:27:57.984]  One major study found that one form of iodine demonstrated more than 99.99% activity
[02:28:01.024 --> 02:28:06.129]  And actively against viruses including Ebola, MERS, SARS, Coronavirus, Influenza and others.
[02:28:06.129 --> 02:28:07.711]  I've got the studies I just showed you.
[02:28:07.711 --> 02:28:12.877]  Mainstream pharma companies are now even creating iodine products to fight Coronavirus.
[02:28:12.877 --> 02:28:20.665]  Financial Times confirms that forms of iodine could be capable of reducing the amount of detectable Coronavirus to almost 100%.
[02:28:21.906 --> 02:28:26.748]  So I should have just said, Financial Times of London and others say pure iodine is cutting it down to almost 100%.
[02:28:26.748 --> 02:28:45.677]  The importance of PVP-1 iodine and its emphasis by its inclusion in the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines actively has been observed against viruses of significant global concern, including hepatitis A influenza as well as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses.
[02:28:45.677 --> 02:28:47.258]  That's right out of Mainline Studies.
[02:28:47.258 --> 02:28:47.658]  And again,
[02:28:48.138 --> 02:28:49.739]  Yet again, it's only God.
[02:28:49.739 --> 02:28:50.980]  All glory goes to God.
[02:28:50.980 --> 02:28:52.801]  We are again in the exact center.
[02:29:18.599 --> 02:29:21.701]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[02:29:21.701 --> 02:29:28.707]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[02:29:28.707 --> 02:29:33.891]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[02:29:33.891 --> 02:29:37.193]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[02:29:37.193 --> 02:29:38.154]  Get clean.
[02:29:38.154 --> 02:29:39.976]  Call now and learn more.
[02:29:39.976 --> 02:29:40.016]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:44.019 --> 02:29:44.480]  800-506-6740 That's 800-506-6740
[02:29:55.100 --> 02:29:56.681]  Hanuman, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[02:29:56.681 --> 02:29:57.822]  What do you think's really going on?
[02:29:57.822 --> 02:29:58.542]  And thanks for calling.
[02:29:58.542 --> 02:30:00.603]  So yes, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago.
[02:30:00.603 --> 02:30:01.283]  I was getting ready.
[02:30:01.283 --> 02:30:05.066]  I went to buy a bunch of toilet paper and some things before crowds really hit.
[02:30:05.066 --> 02:30:09.688]  And I had my phone, I had my show going on, sticking on my pocket so I could hear it.
[02:30:09.688 --> 02:30:10.869]  I wasn't using headphones.
[02:30:10.869 --> 02:30:11.649]  And this lady stops.
[02:30:11.649 --> 02:30:13.270]  She says, who are you listening to?
[02:30:13.270 --> 02:30:14.051]  Who's that talking?
[02:30:14.051 --> 02:30:15.471]  I said, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:15.471 --> 02:30:17.713]  And she just got, her eyes got wide open.
[02:30:17.713 --> 02:30:18.813]  And she says, really?
[02:30:18.813 --> 02:30:19.914]  I thought he was off the air.
[02:30:20.294 --> 02:30:25.459]  And I said no, and I told her I explained, you know, the whole situation and told her where to go.
[02:30:25.459 --> 02:30:30.283]  She wrote down, you know, Dan.video and also Infowars.com and just said she's still on.
[02:30:30.283 --> 02:30:35.888]  I run into people at the grocery store, at the mall, on the hike and bike trail, and they go, oh Alex, I used to love you.
[02:30:35.888 --> 02:30:37.009]  I wish you were still on air.
[02:30:37.009 --> 02:30:37.909]  Are you ever going to go back on air?
[02:30:37.909 --> 02:30:38.470]  And I'm like, what?
[02:30:38.490 --> 02:30:41.473]  We're on hundreds of radio stations, over 100 TV stations and cable stations.
[02:30:41.473 --> 02:30:43.755]  We have our own streams at InfoWars.com and BandOffVideo.
[02:30:43.755 --> 02:30:44.616]  And they go, really?
[02:30:44.616 --> 02:30:49.220]  They said you were off the air because they took the deplatforming as off the air.
[02:30:49.220 --> 02:30:50.902]  No, we have our own platform.
[02:30:50.902 --> 02:30:51.843]  InfoWars!
[02:30:51.843 --> 02:30:52.684]  InfoWars!
[02:30:52.684 --> 02:30:53.605]  InfoWars!
[02:30:54.870 --> 02:31:04.812]  Six weeks ago, we warned you that the choreographed nature of the global media and governments concerning coronavirus told us it was a major globalist operation.
[02:31:04.812 --> 02:31:16.014]  Now, whether it's super deadly or not, the issue is it's being used by the globalists as a weapon against the world economy and against nation-states and against the populist movement here in America.
[02:31:16.014 --> 02:31:17.275]  And against Infowars.
[02:31:17.275 --> 02:31:18.775]  And that means against you.
[02:31:18.775 --> 02:31:23.756]  So however you're going to do it, now is the time to get ready and to get prepared with emergency supplies
[02:31:24.316 --> 02:31:27.838]  And items that are known to boost your immune system.
[02:31:27.838 --> 02:31:29.900]  They're all at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:29.900 --> 02:31:32.821]  High quality storable food when nobody else has got it.
[02:31:32.821 --> 02:31:42.507]  Super powerful formulas like DNA Force Plus, X2, X3, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and our Nano Silver line of products.
[02:31:42.507 --> 02:31:47.510]  A bunch of which has been sold out, but a bunch of which is coming back in later this week.
[02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:50.652]  So check it all out at InfoWarsStore.com and get prepared.
[02:31:54.699 --> 02:31:55.740]  Everybody's calling me.
[02:31:55.740 --> 02:32:03.065]  I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[02:32:03.065 --> 02:32:04.506]  How bad is it really?
[02:32:04.506 --> 02:32:07.208]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high-quality, swearable foods.
[02:32:07.208 --> 02:32:10.170]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation, that actually still has food.
[02:32:10.170 --> 02:32:12.892]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got to package it.
[02:32:12.892 --> 02:32:13.512]  They got the food.
[02:32:13.512 --> 02:32:16.234]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important thing.
[02:32:16.594 --> 02:32:17.115]  That's right.
[02:32:36.954 --> 02:32:39.095]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:33.886 --> 02:33:51.016]  With the development, or the advent, you see it as a positive, of nuclear weapons, atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and all the other little antimatter weapons and all other goodies that we have that'll blow the whole solar system up.
[02:33:51.016 --> 02:33:51.496]  Yeah.
[02:33:51.496 --> 02:33:57.059]  We're not in Kansas anymore, folks.
[02:33:57.059 --> 02:34:02.763]  With the advent of all of that, old-fashioned warfare, lining up and killing each other, kind of became
[02:34:04.056 --> 02:34:07.679]  Old shoe, old hat, yesterday's news.
[02:34:07.679 --> 02:34:13.303]  But now it's economic war, now it's culture war, now it's spiritual war.
[02:34:13.303 --> 02:34:20.549]  Which it had always been before, hadn't it?
[02:34:20.549 --> 02:34:22.831]  And so that's where we are now.
[02:34:22.831 --> 02:34:28.175]  And this is 21st century war, and the President needs to come out and say the truth.
[02:34:29.215 --> 02:34:37.062]  He gives a fireside chat on the globalists, the shy comms and Americans that are rooting against our economy and rooting for the collapse.
[02:34:37.062 --> 02:34:38.343]  They're all done.
[02:34:38.343 --> 02:34:40.986]  It's over.
[02:34:40.986 --> 02:34:43.748]  You got to call it like it is.
[02:34:43.748 --> 02:34:44.629]  It's a no brainer.
[02:34:44.629 --> 02:34:47.331]  It's sure victory.
[02:34:47.331 --> 02:34:48.552]  But will the president do that?
[02:34:48.552 --> 02:34:50.254]  That's the big question.
[02:34:50.254 --> 02:34:50.614]  All right.
[02:34:50.614 --> 02:34:51.555]  You've been very patient.
[02:34:51.555 --> 02:34:53.116]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[02:34:53.916 --> 02:34:56.137]  Let me go back to your phone calls right now.
[02:34:56.137 --> 02:35:01.520]  We're going to try to move as quickly as possible here so that folks don't hold too long.
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:03.381]  Chris, in Washington State, you're on the air.
[02:35:03.381 --> 02:35:05.743]  Go ahead.
[02:35:05.743 --> 02:35:07.624]  Hey, it's an honor to talk to you, Alex.
[02:35:07.624 --> 02:35:08.504]  Honor to talk to you, brother.
[02:35:08.504 --> 02:35:09.605]  Go ahead.
[02:35:09.605 --> 02:35:18.310]  Hey, you know, I've been talking to a lot of people and, you know, we've been trying to figure out this, you know, why are they doing all the suppression of testing?
[02:35:18.928 --> 02:35:23.111]  You know, the corrupt disease control that we have.
[02:35:23.111 --> 02:35:30.956]  You know, and I've basically come, Cornell broke it down to, you know, one of the speakers you just had.
[02:35:30.956 --> 02:35:33.738]  I believe that he's on to something there.
[02:35:33.738 --> 02:35:48.187]  They're suppressing the testing so that way they aren't getting the actual data out that shows that it's not as bad as it is because they do want the economic collapse that they're, you know, I mean,
[02:35:49.275 --> 02:35:49.675]  Well, that's right.
[02:35:49.675 --> 02:35:52.956]  They're not putting the kids out to cover up how bad it is.
[02:35:52.956 --> 02:35:56.618]  They're putting the kids out to cover up it's not bad.
[02:35:56.618 --> 02:35:57.458]  100%.
[02:35:57.458 --> 02:35:57.918]  100%.
[02:35:57.918 --> 02:36:07.182]  And I think that if the president would actually go on the offense and stop the... I don't even know how to say it.
[02:36:07.182 --> 02:36:08.943]  Pussy footing.
[02:36:08.943 --> 02:36:09.763]  What's that?
[02:36:09.763 --> 02:36:11.243]  Pussy footing.
[02:36:11.243 --> 02:36:12.384]  Yeah.
[02:36:12.384 --> 02:36:15.005]  If he would just be the president that we elected
[02:36:15.789 --> 02:36:27.812]  And you know, the $8.2 billion, how he said he only wanted $2.5 or whatever, use some of that money to help the businesses here locally because our food supply chain
[02:36:28.815 --> 02:36:32.077]  It's drastically going to be affected.
[02:36:32.077 --> 02:36:36.341]  Oh yeah, this supply side, this supply chain thing is real.
[02:36:36.341 --> 02:36:38.822]  Say we learn about the virus, this is a big deal.
[02:36:38.822 --> 02:36:41.845]  And now they're trying to exacerbate it and use it against the economy.
[02:36:41.845 --> 02:36:43.025]  It's so obvious.
[02:36:43.025 --> 02:36:47.849]  But what about how obvious it is that Democrats and globalists are seizing on this?
[02:36:47.849 --> 02:36:50.711]  Imagine if I went on air and said, I hope this destroys America.
[02:36:50.711 --> 02:36:52.412]  You'd all hate me and be done with me.
[02:36:52.412 --> 02:36:53.273]  I wouldn't do that anyways.
[02:36:53.273 --> 02:36:54.714]  But how do the Democrats get away with it?
[02:36:56.956 --> 02:37:03.080]  To me, I don't understand how there's even a Democratic Party left.
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:04.922]  There isn't.
[02:37:04.922 --> 02:37:06.423]  The Democrats?
[02:37:06.423 --> 02:37:08.484]  They're just a group of terrorists that hate America.
[02:37:08.484 --> 02:37:09.385]  Thank you so much, Chris.
[02:37:09.385 --> 02:37:10.946]  Thank you.
[02:37:10.946 --> 02:37:17.852]  That really is it, isn't it?
[02:37:17.852 --> 02:37:18.752]  Jack in Atlanta.
[02:37:18.752 --> 02:37:19.953]  Wow, I didn't see you were holding that long.
[02:37:19.953 --> 02:37:20.834]  Sorry, Jack.
[02:37:20.834 --> 02:37:21.654]  Thanks for holding, Jack.
[02:37:21.654 --> 02:37:22.075]  You're on the air.
[02:37:23.308 --> 02:37:24.068]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:24.068 --> 02:37:27.870]  First thing I want to tell you, your crew and your products are outstanding.
[02:37:27.870 --> 02:37:35.795]  Quick plug, I'm a prior military and international airline captain, and I believe I was also exposed to this particular virus.
[02:37:35.795 --> 02:37:39.617]  I use the silver products that I keep in my bag.
[02:37:39.617 --> 02:37:42.258]  I always have iodine in there and lots of vitamin C and D3.
[02:37:42.258 --> 02:37:43.479]  Well, that's amazing.
[02:37:43.479 --> 02:37:46.660]  As an international airline pilot, if anybody's going to be exposed, it's you.
[02:37:46.660 --> 02:37:47.281]  This is important.
[02:37:47.281 --> 02:37:51.563]  We'll get to your next topic, but talk about when it was, what you think happened.
[02:37:53.174 --> 02:37:59.857]  Well, I don't know if it came in with the loading crews that load the aircraft, possibly.
[02:37:59.857 --> 02:38:08.320]  But, you know, all of a sudden I've got the, you know, out of nowhere, the sore throats, runny nose, the post nasal, the, you know, basically flu symptoms.
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:09.301]  I'm like, well, hell with this.
[02:38:09.301 --> 02:38:10.201]  And I'm stuck on a trip.
[02:38:10.201 --> 02:38:18.044]  So I just started down in the silver and I always take iodine anyway, because my little thing, I'm exposed to gamma, you know, at high altitude.
[02:38:18.044 --> 02:38:19.045]  So I take it at any rate.
[02:38:20.785 --> 02:38:26.707]  But, uh, I started rubbing that stuff in my nose, and I had the super gel, and I put some of that inside my nostril.
[02:38:26.707 --> 02:38:28.267]  I know that sounds nasty.
[02:38:28.267 --> 02:38:31.768]  And, uh, and I started breathing the garth, you know, uh, gargling the back of my throat.
[02:38:31.768 --> 02:38:32.929]  Well, who told you to do that?
[02:38:32.929 --> 02:38:39.750]  Because that's what the big, the big pharma's coming out with, the iodine that they're gonna spray up the nostril, into the sinus.
[02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:41.171]  Okay.
[02:38:41.171 --> 02:38:43.912]  You just instinctively thought, put it in your nose.
[02:38:43.912 --> 02:38:44.772]  Yeah.
[02:38:44.772 --> 02:38:46.532]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:38:46.532 --> 02:38:47.633]  Well, keep going, Captain.
[02:38:47.633 --> 02:38:48.153]  Tell us what else.
[02:38:49.229 --> 02:38:54.331]  Well, anyway, that hung on, and I felt the millies and all that kind of stuff for a few days.
[02:38:54.331 --> 02:38:58.113]  I've got a pretty strong immune system anyway, but I felt that stuff for a few days.
[02:38:58.113 --> 02:38:58.913]  I'm like, hell with this.
[02:38:58.913 --> 02:39:01.594]  I started drinking a lot of water, and I work out every day.
[02:39:01.594 --> 02:39:05.796]  And within about four days, it's pretty much gone.
[02:39:05.796 --> 02:39:11.118]  And I had the stuff in the back of your throat where you're coughing stuff up a little bit, but that was about it.
[02:39:11.118 --> 02:39:12.278]  Well, Jack, thanks for holding.
[02:39:12.278 --> 02:39:12.919]  I apologize.
[02:39:12.919 --> 02:39:15.179]  We've got so many phone lines, but you're here now.
[02:39:15.179 --> 02:39:18.881]  What is your view on the virus and what Trump needs to do and what you think is really going on?
[02:39:19.915 --> 02:39:22.176]  Well, I'm going to dovetail into your previous calls.
[02:39:22.176 --> 02:39:26.959]  I think that we should have had an Andy Jackson moment long ago, but this is what I'm thinking.
[02:39:26.959 --> 02:39:29.360]  I am sick of absorbing straight.
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:30.500]  I'm absolutely tired of that.
[02:39:30.500 --> 02:39:31.461]  I want to go on offense.
[02:39:31.461 --> 02:39:33.282]  I want to start smashing these people in the nose.
[02:39:33.282 --> 02:39:34.542]  I am done with this.
[02:39:34.542 --> 02:39:35.803]  And this is what I think we should do.
[02:39:35.803 --> 02:39:41.546]  If you want to upset the bank and do this in broad strokes, this is what I think.
[02:39:41.546 --> 02:39:43.587]  I'm looking at that clock right now.
[02:39:43.587 --> 02:39:45.628]  And we have real tangible damages.
[02:39:46.092 --> 02:39:46.592]  We're good.
[02:40:16.781 --> 02:40:18.382]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:40:18.382 --> 02:40:20.964]  If we do that, we should punch them first.
[02:40:44.008 --> 02:40:47.450]  We're going to be done with this, and then that will set the table to do the following.
[02:40:47.450 --> 02:40:48.410]  Remember Iris Mack?
[02:40:48.410 --> 02:40:52.793]  You had a guest on a few years ago, wrote a book, Bailout from Main Street.
[02:40:52.793 --> 02:40:53.073]  I do.
[02:40:53.073 --> 02:40:54.934]  We had him on.
[02:40:54.934 --> 02:40:55.334]  Yeah.
[02:40:55.334 --> 02:40:55.674]  Yes.
[02:40:55.674 --> 02:41:09.582]  She's a Harvard University professor, and in one of her chapters, she cataloged, itemized the $17.1 trillion in debt that the Americans took on to bail out mostly foreign banks.
[02:41:09.582 --> 02:41:11.663]  When I look at that foreign held debt,
[02:41:12.547 --> 02:41:14.769]  And offset that with the 17 remaining debt.
[02:41:14.769 --> 02:41:20.033]  Oh yeah, most of its money the Federal Reserve gave the CHICOMS to then bring back in for control.
[02:41:20.033 --> 02:41:23.216]  It's traitorous sedition.
[02:41:23.216 --> 02:41:24.457]  Let's send them a bill.
[02:41:24.457 --> 02:41:25.438]  Let's send them a damn bill.
[02:41:25.438 --> 02:41:25.878]  I'm over it.
[02:41:25.878 --> 02:41:27.379]  No, you said it.
[02:41:27.379 --> 02:41:31.522]  Send China a bill for the 2008-2009 beggar bailout.
[02:41:31.522 --> 02:41:33.244]  That is genius, Jack.
[02:41:35.394 --> 02:41:46.197]  Jack, I'm not just saying this, all the callers are too good, but give us your name and number, because we're going to launch like a four-hour show once a week that different rotating callers host, and then we'll have some other callers on, and I'll also be part of that.
[02:41:46.197 --> 02:41:47.598]  Thank you so much, Jack.
[02:41:47.598 --> 02:41:48.118]  Amazing.
[02:41:48.118 --> 02:41:49.679]  Okay.
[02:41:49.679 --> 02:41:53.780]  We've got a couple segments ahead, and I really like Gerald Cilente, and I always take a lot of his time.
[02:41:53.780 --> 02:41:54.340]  I don't want to do that.
[02:41:54.340 --> 02:42:00.122]  I'm going to take 15 minutes to the next hour, and I'm going to just come back, and I'm going to go to all these callers that are holding like Joel.
[02:42:01.249 --> 02:42:04.952]  And James and Mark and Joseph in Ireland.
[02:42:04.952 --> 02:42:06.092]  Joseph in Ireland.
[02:42:06.092 --> 02:42:08.314]  We'll get to all of you when we come back on the other side.
[02:42:08.314 --> 02:42:10.715]  Just briefly.
[02:42:10.715 --> 02:42:15.439]  They're all out trying to hype folks out about buying toilet paper and you gotta worry.
[02:42:15.439 --> 02:42:18.821]  Forget toilet paper, folks.
[02:42:18.821 --> 02:42:21.323]  I want to give you a little bit of a message here, but
[02:42:22.742 --> 02:42:26.964]  I don't want to be gross here, but if you got a shower, you ain't got to wipe your ass.
[02:42:26.964 --> 02:42:27.964]  That's a fancy duvet.
[02:42:27.964 --> 02:42:30.746]  If you run out of toilet paper, you're going to survive.
[02:42:30.746 --> 02:42:44.331]  But if you do not have items that boost your immune system, like DNA Force Plus, like turmeric bodies, like the nano silver products we have, you're going to have a problem and you're dead.
[02:42:44.331 --> 02:42:47.793]  But ass wiping, I don't want to be gross here, is the least of our problems.
[02:42:47.793 --> 02:42:49.014]  We'll be able to take care of that.
[02:42:49.014 --> 02:42:51.795]  Hell, get like the New York Times, wipe your ass with that.
[02:42:53.447 --> 02:42:59.270]  I wanted to talk about Super Silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[02:42:59.270 --> 02:43:02.832]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[02:43:02.832 --> 02:43:05.134]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[02:43:05.134 --> 02:43:06.955]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[02:43:06.955 --> 02:43:08.556]  So here I am telling people.
[02:43:09.296 --> 02:43:19.443]  Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[02:43:19.443 --> 02:43:30.991]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[02:43:30.991 --> 02:43:33.212]  It feels so good.
[02:43:33.212 --> 02:43:36.434]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[02:43:36.434 --> 02:43:38.716]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth
[02:43:39.478 --> 02:43:42.631]  Three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[02:43:42.631 --> 02:43:44.298]  Because I like the way it feels.
[02:43:53.789 --> 02:44:05.482]  Across the Western world, from high school to college sports, to even the Olympics, men, biological men, are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[02:44:05.482 --> 02:44:14.171]  This is men invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away, all in the name of liberalism and openness.
[02:44:14.491 --> 02:44:25.033]  And that every day I have stacks of news articles, just like today, UK teen fined under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings.
[02:44:25.033 --> 02:44:36.896]  UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[02:44:36.896 --> 02:44:38.576]  That's the thought police.
[02:44:38.576 --> 02:44:43.357]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail.
[02:44:43.717 --> 02:44:45.018]  This is tyranny.
[02:44:45.018 --> 02:44:51.281]  These people are bullies, and it's sick, and it's evil, and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover.
[02:44:51.281 --> 02:44:51.901]  Resist it.
[02:44:51.901 --> 02:44:54.362]  Speak out against it.
[02:44:54.362 --> 02:44:56.143]  We always promote being prepared.
[02:44:56.143 --> 02:45:02.126]  Having firearms, knowing how to use them, and being self-sufficient, and learn how to hunt, and learn how to garden.
[02:45:02.126 --> 02:45:03.686]  I mean, it's just, it's what we're meant to do.
[02:45:03.686 --> 02:45:04.887]  It feels good when we do it.
[02:45:04.887 --> 02:45:06.808]  But we do sell high-quality, affordable food.
[02:45:06.808 --> 02:45:08.969]  I told my Patriot a month ago, I said,
[02:45:09.309 --> 02:45:09.869]  What can you handle?
[02:45:09.869 --> 02:45:10.930]  I said, I think this is going to be really big.
[02:45:10.930 --> 02:45:12.391]  And they said, well, we can handle probably this.
[02:45:12.391 --> 02:45:15.652]  We're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund.
[02:45:15.652 --> 02:45:16.973]  I said, no, I think this is going to be huge.
[02:45:16.973 --> 02:45:20.975]  I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food, even though the prices are going up for you.
[02:45:20.975 --> 02:45:22.216]  So those are the type of discussions we had.
[02:45:22.216 --> 02:45:24.257]  I'm just giving the inside baseball of all of us.
[02:45:24.257 --> 02:45:27.459]  This is 100 times regular volume plus.
[02:45:27.459 --> 02:45:28.699]  It was 100 times a few days ago.
[02:45:28.699 --> 02:45:29.340]  Now it's about 200 times.
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:30.320]  Okay.
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:33.162]  At InfoWarsTore.com, you go right in the queue.
[02:45:33.162 --> 02:45:33.982]  First come, first serve.
[02:45:33.982 --> 02:45:37.884]  But the fact that the orders are so ultra-massive, it's dizzying.
[02:45:37.884 --> 02:45:39.205]  I mean, this is just insane.
[02:45:39.205 --> 02:45:41.986]  We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe.
[02:45:41.986 --> 02:45:46.588]  And then, if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales.
[02:45:46.588 --> 02:45:47.889]  Everybody gets their order in.
[02:45:47.889 --> 02:45:48.589]  We'll get your food.
[02:45:48.589 --> 02:45:50.270]  But that's how big this is.
[02:45:50.270 --> 02:45:53.111]  So what you're getting is 100% the straight deal of what's going on.
[02:45:53.111 --> 02:45:54.052]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:45:55.410 --> 02:45:57.851]  We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[02:45:57.851 --> 02:46:04.853]  Humanity's waking up to their tyranny, how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post-human world.
[02:46:04.853 --> 02:46:06.714]  But we know they're going to strike back.
[02:46:06.714 --> 02:46:13.796]  And the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world countries and then use those giant populations
[02:46:14.176 --> 02:46:14.617]  I'm good.
[02:46:30.237 --> 02:46:47.520]  This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word because people are waking up like never before, but this fight against tyranny is neck and neck, so spread the word about band.video and infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:49.521]  That is so important.
[02:46:49.521 --> 02:46:52.041]  You are at the center of the resistance.
[02:46:52.041 --> 02:46:57.022]  You are our only hope.
[02:46:57.022 --> 02:46:59.623]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:09.645 --> 02:47:12.026]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:47:12.026 --> 02:47:15.967]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:15.967 --> 02:47:26.371]  Alright, if you're a TV viewer, you're about to see something really amazing.
[02:47:26.371 --> 02:47:31.973]  Radio listeners, there's the feed at Infowars.com, Portsmouth Show and Bandai Video.
[02:47:31.973 --> 02:47:36.075]  But this is a CNBC live feed from the
[02:47:39.358 --> 02:47:41.920]  Stock market system.
[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:44.121]  Now, let's look at it right here.
[02:47:44.121 --> 02:47:57.270]  On screen, way over here on the left hand side, reading left to right, you see Obama when he left office almost four years ago.
[02:47:57.270 --> 02:47:59.672]  That's where the stock market is.
[02:47:59.672 --> 02:48:01.453]  Because America wasn't open for business.
[02:48:01.453 --> 02:48:06.537]  China was the only place you can invest with the environmental regulations, the taxes, the tariffs.
[02:48:06.537 --> 02:48:06.657]  Now,
[02:48:08.502 --> 02:48:12.044]  Trump becomes president elect.
[02:48:12.044 --> 02:48:13.405]  Boom!
[02:48:13.405 --> 02:48:14.506]  Goes down a little bit, though.
[02:48:14.506 --> 02:48:15.106]  Nobody's sure.
[02:48:15.106 --> 02:48:17.908]  Maybe the inauguration is not going to happen.
[02:48:17.908 --> 02:48:20.169]  Then he gets inaugurated.
[02:48:20.169 --> 02:48:21.650]  And what happens?
[02:48:21.650 --> 02:48:24.492]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[02:48:24.492 --> 02:48:25.973]  This is all just confidence.
[02:48:25.973 --> 02:48:26.854]  Of course it's fiat.
[02:48:26.854 --> 02:48:27.374]  Doesn't matter.
[02:48:27.374 --> 02:48:29.115]  We can do anything.
[02:48:29.115 --> 02:48:35.579]  Here comes coronavirus a couple weeks ago.
[02:48:35.579 --> 02:48:36.700]  And it's already lost.
[02:48:39.164 --> 02:48:47.092]  More than half its gains since Obama left.
[02:48:47.092 --> 02:48:50.255]  We can never have a 3% growth rate.
[02:48:50.255 --> 02:48:52.378]  America was done.
[02:48:52.378 --> 02:48:55.701]  Stopped markets down 2,000 points today.
[02:48:55.701 --> 02:48:57.022]  But look at that.
[02:48:57.022 --> 02:49:00.166]  Look at where Obama is.
[02:49:01.889 --> 02:49:03.711]  They could have turned it on better than Trump.
[02:49:03.711 --> 02:49:05.672]  They run it.
[02:49:05.672 --> 02:49:09.135]  China had 10% growth rate four years ago.
[02:49:09.135 --> 02:49:10.776]  China was getting it all.
[02:49:10.776 --> 02:49:12.758]  Because the people weren't getting it.
[02:49:12.758 --> 02:49:16.441]  The globals were getting it and leveraging Chinese slave power worldwide.
[02:49:16.441 --> 02:49:21.706]  So here's Obama for the American person.
[02:49:21.706 --> 02:49:23.087]  And then here we go right here.
[02:49:23.087 --> 02:49:25.489]  But look at what they've done with coronavirus.
[02:49:25.489 --> 02:49:26.850]  Was it not called perfectly?
[02:49:28.188 --> 02:49:40.775]  Here we are, six weeks ago, right here at this peak saying, they are pissed, we are winning, this virus, the way it's hyped, the way the media is behind China, look out, this is the attack.
[02:49:40.775 --> 02:49:45.058]  And again, I don't tell you, oh look, we were right to go, oh look, I'm so smart.
[02:49:45.058 --> 02:49:47.179]  I don't give a rat's ass.
[02:49:47.179 --> 02:49:49.481]  I'm a recluse if you want to get down to brass tacks.
[02:49:49.481 --> 02:49:51.342]  I don't care about that.
[02:49:51.342 --> 02:49:55.744]  I just want you to know, man, I'm telling you what's going on.
[02:49:55.744 --> 02:49:56.925]  And I know you already get it.
[02:49:58.311 --> 02:50:00.712]  So spread the word right now because it's that word of mouth.
[02:50:00.712 --> 02:50:01.813]  They know you've got it.
[02:50:01.813 --> 02:50:02.913]  They know I've got it.
[02:50:02.913 --> 02:50:04.214]  They know we've got it.
[02:50:04.214 --> 02:50:06.875]  And they don't want to get it now.
[02:50:06.875 --> 02:50:14.458]  So they want to do this to us with a virus that maybe has killed 100 people in the U.S.
[02:50:14.458 --> 02:50:16.479]  Talk about mice and men.
[02:50:16.479 --> 02:50:18.300]  Talk about the wicked flea with none pursued.
[02:50:19.565 --> 02:50:20.985]  But Americans aren't cowards.
[02:50:20.985 --> 02:50:23.766]  They take what our media says like it's the end of the world.
[02:50:23.766 --> 02:50:24.946]  And Trump's done a terrible job.
[02:50:24.946 --> 02:50:33.789]  And now all these trillions that the American people had, a piece of the market you had, you invested, the globalists moved all that money out before they dropped it.
[02:50:33.789 --> 02:50:36.430]  And they're all laughing at you with the shy comms right now.
[02:50:36.430 --> 02:50:38.950]  So we need to have a discussion about how do we defeat this?
[02:50:38.950 --> 02:50:39.931]  How do we say no to this?
[02:50:39.931 --> 02:50:41.011]  But this is a big deal.
[02:50:41.011 --> 02:50:44.552]  Let's go back to your phone calls for a couple of segments before Gerald Solente takes over.
[02:50:44.552 --> 02:50:45.772]  But I'm pledged to do it.
[02:50:45.772 --> 02:50:47.253]  And I love you to death for holding.
[02:50:47.253 --> 02:50:48.513]  And I really appreciate you all.
[02:50:49.413 --> 02:50:51.114]  So, who's up next?
[02:50:51.114 --> 02:50:54.777]  Let's go ahead and get my mic on here.
[02:50:54.777 --> 02:50:57.719]  Let's go to James in Georgia.
[02:50:57.719 --> 02:51:01.141]  Thanks for holding.
[02:51:01.141 --> 02:51:03.723]  Can you hear me?
[02:51:03.723 --> 02:51:04.763]  Yes, I sure can, James.
[02:51:04.763 --> 02:51:05.064]  Thank you.
[02:51:05.064 --> 02:51:15.090]  Yeah, I believe the economy would have dropped anyways drastically due to the supplies line being severed.
[02:51:15.090 --> 02:51:16.051]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:51:16.051 --> 02:51:17.712]  That alone is just ginormous.
[02:51:18.445 --> 02:51:33.510]  Right, but 100% we're under attack and it's going to be like waves in my opinion and I just worry once all the people are running around like chickens with their heads cut off that they're going to drop that EMP.
[02:51:33.510 --> 02:51:39.092]  By the way, let me just say this, not to interrupt you, but every time I talk to a caller it just enlightens everything.
[02:51:40.373 --> 02:51:43.894]  We could beat the Germans, we could beat the Japanese, we could beat the Soviets.
[02:51:43.894 --> 02:51:48.776]  We can't beat our own media attacking us with a virus unless we realize they're behind it.
[02:51:48.776 --> 02:51:51.417]  So we just gotta tell Americans, hey, let's not be scared of this.
[02:51:51.417 --> 02:51:55.719]  They're trying to kill our economy and let everybody know the Democrats and the globalists are behind it.
[02:51:55.719 --> 02:51:58.319]  And just keep saying it, Democrats and globalists are behind it.
[02:51:58.319 --> 02:52:00.140]  Democrats and globalists are behind it.
[02:52:00.140 --> 02:52:02.901]  And as long as the President does that, they're gonna run for the hills.
[02:52:02.901 --> 02:52:07.243]  You talk about chickens with their heads cut off, but if Trump keeps trying to cover up this,
[02:52:08.183 --> 02:52:12.504]  He's not covering up the virus, he's covering up the hype, the war they've launched.
[02:52:12.504 --> 02:52:13.965]  He already lost that fight.
[02:52:13.965 --> 02:52:16.305]  He needs to belly up and take them on head on.
[02:52:16.305 --> 02:52:21.347]  What do you think we do, James?
[02:52:21.347 --> 02:52:25.228]  He's been infested with the globalists since he's gotten here, man.
[02:52:25.228 --> 02:52:27.008]  So I don't know.
[02:52:27.008 --> 02:52:30.690]  I guess maybe I've given up a little bit of hope on Trump.
[02:52:30.690 --> 02:52:31.930]  No, that's a good point.
[02:52:33.280 --> 02:52:34.201]  Is he just dumb?
[02:52:34.201 --> 02:52:34.501]  No.
[02:52:34.501 --> 02:52:36.463]  Why is he always surrounding himself with globalists?
[02:52:36.463 --> 02:52:41.227]  He's done a lot of good stuff, but it, you know, yeah.
[02:52:41.227 --> 02:52:49.455]  Like I said, I don't have the answer, but I worry that the attacks will continue to come, because at all costs, they're going to keep him out.
[02:52:49.455 --> 02:52:51.536]  But see, if he's a globalist, why would they be attacking him?
[02:52:51.536 --> 02:52:52.437]  See, that's the paradox.
[02:52:52.437 --> 02:52:53.999]  They genuinely don't like Trump.
[02:52:53.999 --> 02:52:55.340]  He is a globalist, I believe.
[02:52:57.048 --> 02:52:59.369]  The neocons have just swamped him with the globalists.
[02:52:59.369 --> 02:53:04.272]  Bolton, Pompeo, I even believe Pence is a globalist, but that's just my opinion.
[02:53:04.272 --> 02:53:06.434]  I don't believe Trump is a globalist.
[02:53:17.612 --> 02:53:18.953]  I think he's overwhelmed.
[02:53:18.953 --> 02:53:22.174]  Oh, believe me, I got a crew that's fully behind me.
[02:53:22.174 --> 02:53:22.914]  I'm overwhelmed.
[02:53:22.914 --> 02:53:24.034]  I'm 47, 46.
[02:53:24.034 --> 02:53:27.155]  I couldn't imagine being in Trump's position.
[02:53:27.155 --> 02:53:30.396]  And I gotta tell you, I don't just, I'm not gonna be confident when I'm not.
[02:53:30.396 --> 02:53:32.237]  He looks like hell now for the first time.
[02:53:32.237 --> 02:53:33.897]  He looks bad right now.
[02:53:33.897 --> 02:53:35.058]  I wonder what news he's getting.
[02:53:35.058 --> 02:53:37.118]  He got all these big CEOs resigning.
[02:53:37.118 --> 02:53:38.479]  That's on NewsWorks.com.
[02:53:38.479 --> 02:53:40.519]  Top three CEOs just resigned.
[02:53:40.519 --> 02:53:42.760]  What do you think's behind that?
[02:53:44.315 --> 02:53:46.556]  I have no idea, really.
[02:53:46.556 --> 02:54:04.342]  I just, you know, if they cut all the communications with the Patriots, and, you know, I go back to the Bible, the Bible says the whore of Babylon will be put in a dark, you know, and the only way to put us in a dark would be an EMP, and the Koreans, North Koreans have got that satellite going overhead every day, so.
[02:54:04.895 --> 02:54:18.706]  Well, all I know is I don't need a satellite or any internet to tell me that any globalist, once this goes to a civil war, I'm not going to be killing cops and FBI agents and bureaucrats.
[02:54:18.706 --> 02:54:24.150]  That one thing they fear is they're going to try to stage riots and weird pitch battles between leftists and right-wingers.
[02:54:24.150 --> 02:54:25.812]  Don't go to those fights.
[02:54:25.812 --> 02:54:32.077]  But if a civil war breaks out, brother, you, like Santa Claus, you should be making a list about who's naughty and who's nice.
[02:54:32.737 --> 02:54:34.978]  And I'm not kissing police ass, they're not the enemy.
[02:54:34.978 --> 02:54:37.100]  I'm not kissing FBI ass, they're not the enemy.
[02:54:37.100 --> 02:54:46.426]  Globalists that work with CHICOMS and did this, and openly rooted for our country's destruction, if it goes to a shooting war, who's the enemy?
[02:54:46.426 --> 02:54:47.026]  I'm asking you.
[02:54:47.026 --> 02:54:51.789]  Everybody should be having that discussion right now, because they're going to vaporize a federal building and blame it on us.
[02:54:51.789 --> 02:54:53.270]  We know a false flag's coming.
[02:54:53.270 --> 02:54:58.553]  As soon as they kill Trump or remove him, because all they need to do is create riots and hysteria, and then kill him.
[02:54:58.553 --> 02:54:59.614]  Like, oh, well, it doesn't matter.
[02:55:00.234 --> 02:55:02.836]  In the middle of hysteria, they believe they can kill the President.
[02:55:02.836 --> 02:55:05.578]  And they do that, then they're going to start coming after us.
[02:55:05.578 --> 02:55:07.780]  And so all I'm saying is, I'm not taking it lying down.
[02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:13.385]  One thing's for sure, God's in charge.
[02:55:13.385 --> 02:55:14.666]  Have faith in God and pray.
[02:55:14.666 --> 02:55:16.928]  Let me tell you how real God is, man.
[02:55:16.928 --> 02:55:18.489]  I know everybody's had these experiences.
[02:55:18.489 --> 02:55:19.450]  God bless you and thanks for your call.
[02:55:20.936 --> 02:55:25.758]  Well, everybody knows young people are more tuned into God and have been brain damaged by the systems.
[02:55:25.758 --> 02:55:26.698]  We're more clairvoyant.
[02:55:26.698 --> 02:55:29.720]  But I mean, I used to have these dreams where I'd wake up sweating.
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:36.542]  And it sounds to be really the stupidest thing, like they're going to change the golf course in front of our house and build a house right there.
[02:55:36.542 --> 02:55:40.524]  And then three years later, they change the golf course and build a house right there.
[02:55:40.524 --> 02:55:42.245]  And I went in the house where they're building it.
[02:55:42.245 --> 02:55:43.265]  It was the exact same house.
[02:55:43.265 --> 02:55:47.267]  I looked out the window and it was like I had time travel to that point.
[02:55:47.267 --> 02:55:49.828]  Then I had other dreams where
[02:55:51.363 --> 02:55:55.907]  What am I doing walking behind a cinder block building?
[02:55:55.907 --> 02:56:03.674]  And all of a sudden there's a guy in a pink and green striped polo shirt with a knife trying to kill me.
[02:56:03.674 --> 02:56:04.615]  And then a few months later.
[02:56:08.117 --> 02:56:09.638]  That happened to me.
[02:56:09.638 --> 02:56:11.539]  Because I had like an older girlfriend who was like 17.
[02:56:11.539 --> 02:56:12.220]  I'm like 15.
[02:56:12.220 --> 02:56:13.340]  I'm riding with her.
[02:56:13.340 --> 02:56:15.882]  She wants to go buy weed in Dallas in like a bad part of town.
[02:56:15.882 --> 02:56:16.922]  I'm like, I don't want to do this.
[02:56:16.922 --> 02:56:18.203]  I just want to, you know, take her home.
[02:56:18.203 --> 02:56:20.725]  I just want to get back to her house.
[02:56:20.725 --> 02:56:22.946]  And she's like, I'm just going to go behind here and buy this weed.
[02:56:22.946 --> 02:56:24.627]  And she didn't come back.
[02:56:24.627 --> 02:56:27.469]  Then all of a sudden, I walk around the corner and there's that guy, man.
[02:56:27.469 --> 02:56:31.551]  And it's like you have those, it's like God is warning you.
[02:56:31.551 --> 02:56:36.935]  Because if I hadn't been ready, as soon as I was walking around that cinder block, back of that, back of that gas station,
[02:56:38.629 --> 02:56:40.170]  That guy probably would have killed me.
[02:56:40.170 --> 02:56:42.572]  And interdimensionally, God wanted me to be where I am.
[02:56:42.572 --> 02:56:46.154]  God doesn't intervene when it's absolutely, like, in the timeline, absolutely needed.
[02:56:46.154 --> 02:56:49.357]  And I've learned that, like, something may not make sense when God intervenes.
[02:56:49.357 --> 02:56:50.597]  Like, what doesn't make sense?
[02:56:50.597 --> 02:56:53.359]  Like, some little dumb thing and God intervenes.
[02:56:53.359 --> 02:56:59.784]  I got to talk to a very famous musician, a big, quote, rock star.
[02:56:59.784 --> 02:57:03.566]  And he wasn't a Christian yet, but he was starting to think about God.
[02:57:03.566 --> 02:57:04.607]  He was in Los Angeles.
[02:57:08.206 --> 02:57:28.031]  He was in like a sex orgy right when that famous 1980s earthquake hit and he's sitting there right after he had sex with these women and he looks up as the earthquake starts and there's literally an angel like on like from the ceilings looking at him saying yeah you better watch what you're doing.
[02:57:28.031 --> 02:57:29.412]  And those are real stories folks.
[02:57:29.412 --> 02:57:30.752]  He wasn't on drugs when that happened.
[02:57:31.516 --> 02:57:39.522]  And he became a Christian after that and changed his life, but it's those things, like, you know, you see that, you're like, okay, uh, I'm going to behave myself now.
[02:57:39.522 --> 02:57:44.446]  But God is on our side.
[02:57:44.446 --> 02:57:53.133]  I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[02:57:53.133 --> 02:57:54.314]  And I spent a lot of time thanking you.
[02:57:55.097 --> 02:58:02.462]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul Revere's.
[02:58:02.462 --> 02:58:09.967]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[02:58:09.967 --> 02:58:18.794]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[02:58:18.794 --> 02:58:23.317]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalists.
[02:58:24.306 --> 02:58:24.846]  It's hard.
[02:58:24.846 --> 02:58:28.768]  So it's not a burden to support InfoWars.

[02:58:44.921 --> 02:58:54.870]  Six weeks ago, we warned you that the choreographed nature of the global media and governments concerning coronavirus told us it was a major globalist operation.
[02:58:54.870 --> 02:59:05.479]  Now, whether it's super deadly or not, the issue is it's being used by the globalists as a weapon against the world economy and against nation states and against the populist movement here in America.
[02:59:06.040 --> 02:59:07.322]  And against InfoWars.
[02:59:07.322 --> 02:59:08.825]  And that means against you.

[03:00:02.372 --> 03:00:08.675]  I miss dancing with you the most of all.
[03:00:08.675 --> 03:00:11.996]  I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go.
[03:00:14.605 --> 03:00:27.350]  Let's take these final five or six phone calls.
[03:00:27.350 --> 03:00:30.351]  Joel in Ohio, welcome back to the transmission.
[03:00:30.351 --> 03:00:32.531]  Thanks for being here, Rose.
[03:00:32.531 --> 03:00:33.652]  Hey, Alex.
[03:00:33.652 --> 03:00:34.392]  Two things.
[03:00:34.392 --> 03:00:42.075]  First of all, the guy the media is trying to blame Trump for, for firing the pandemic expert guy.
[03:00:42.867 --> 03:00:44.128]  That was John Bolton.
[03:00:44.128 --> 03:00:50.092]  John Bolton pressured him and his team into resigning.
[03:00:50.092 --> 03:00:50.933]  No, you're absolutely right.
[03:00:50.933 --> 03:00:53.254]  Elaborate on that.
[03:00:53.254 --> 03:00:55.916]  Well, that's not the reason I called.
[03:00:55.916 --> 03:00:59.799]  I just heard somebody bring up John Bolton, but somebody needs to look into that.
[03:00:59.799 --> 03:01:03.502]  But here's what's the important part.
[03:01:03.502 --> 03:01:12.528]  So one of the two companies the government's now facilitating testing with is Quest Diagnostics.
[03:01:14.665 --> 03:01:19.887]  They started working in China in 2006.
[03:01:19.887 --> 03:01:26.951]  Then, in 2011, they expanded, creating an alliance partnership with KingMed Diagnostics.
[03:01:26.951 --> 03:01:31.353]  KingMed, they're the ones doing all the testing in China.
[03:01:31.353 --> 03:01:37.596]  And KingMed, Quest, several other companies started a global diagnostic network in 2018.
[03:01:39.562 --> 03:01:49.164]  So everything that China knows, all the data, everything should be in Quest Diagnostics' database.
[03:01:49.164 --> 03:01:50.424]  Well, that's a great point.
[03:01:50.424 --> 03:01:58.986]  And the globalists that run our government, to a great extent, they've had us merge with China's databases forever already.
[03:01:58.986 --> 03:02:00.146]  And it's not just that.
[03:02:00.146 --> 03:02:02.207]  It's Cleveland Clinic, too.
[03:02:02.207 --> 03:02:03.887]  They worked with KingMed in 2014 on pathology.
[03:02:08.723 --> 03:02:16.208]  Q2 labs in the U.S., they worked with KingMed on in vitro diagnostics.
[03:02:16.208 --> 03:02:17.509]  Like, it's insane.
[03:02:17.509 --> 03:02:20.571]  We should have all the data.
[03:02:20.571 --> 03:02:26.515]  We should be running our own tests a long time ago.
[03:02:26.515 --> 03:02:28.817]  What do you think President Trump needs to do to get ahead of this?
[03:02:28.817 --> 03:02:31.218]  Because clearly they're trying to set him up.
[03:02:31.218 --> 03:02:36.942]  He just needs to say it came from China, it's man-made, screw you, instead of like bowing down to it.
[03:02:36.942 --> 03:02:37.763]  Well, I think
[03:02:38.942 --> 03:02:43.966]  I think it's not acceptable for us to not have all the information and the data.
[03:02:43.966 --> 03:02:49.009]  Not just the U.S., every country around the world should know everything about it.
[03:02:49.009 --> 03:02:57.996]  And the fact that we don't know whether their information is correct or not that they gave us, that's absurd.
[03:02:57.996 --> 03:03:01.619]  Well, the left is openly celebrating this.
[03:03:01.619 --> 03:03:02.920]  They're openly celebrating.
[03:03:04.949 --> 03:03:06.090]  The stock market drop.
[03:03:06.090 --> 03:03:07.131]  What does that tell people?
[03:03:07.131 --> 03:03:10.434]  They're celebrating attacking the economy.
[03:03:10.434 --> 03:03:15.078]  I just I can't believe that they just do that.
[03:03:15.078 --> 03:03:25.987]  Well, this global diagnostic network, the I think you guys and the Trump administration, I think everybody needs to look into that and ask Quest Diagnostics.
[03:03:25.987 --> 03:03:27.408]  That's about to start doing testing.
[03:03:28.177 --> 03:03:29.578]  Why didn't they bring this up?
[03:03:29.578 --> 03:03:31.459]  Why don't we have that data?
[03:03:31.459 --> 03:03:32.300]  Great point, brother.
[03:03:32.300 --> 03:03:33.261]  Thank you, Joel.
[03:03:33.261 --> 03:03:38.264]  Joseph in Ireland, and we'll hold you over, but get started now.
[03:03:38.264 --> 03:03:40.906]  Joseph, what do you think's going on?
[03:03:40.906 --> 03:03:43.508]  Alex, I'll take it back to a point in history.
[03:03:43.508 --> 03:03:51.593]  Remember Japan was put to the wall by America with the sanctions, and they had two choices, go on their knees or surrender or go to war.
[03:03:51.593 --> 03:03:54.015]  China is not going on its knees.
[03:03:54.015 --> 03:03:55.736]  It has released its bioweapon.
[03:03:56.556 --> 03:03:58.557]  Hold on, Joseph, this is too powerful.
[03:03:58.557 --> 03:03:59.557]  Stay there.
[03:03:59.557 --> 03:04:04.899]  We're going to come back and give you the floor when we come back, and then we're going to hit Red Jack in Norman.
[03:04:04.899 --> 03:04:06.340]  Red Jack Norman.
[03:04:06.340 --> 03:04:08.720]  That sounds like a secret code for something powerful.
[03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:09.581]  Or Norman Jack Red.
[03:04:09.581 --> 03:04:10.021]  Or Jack Norman Red.
[03:04:26.292 --> 03:04:28.113]  Something's going on over there.
[03:04:28.113 --> 03:04:29.855]  Jack, Norman, Red.
[03:04:29.855 --> 03:04:31.576]  Red, Jack, Norman.
[03:04:31.576 --> 03:04:33.037]  Jack, Red, Norman.
[03:04:33.037 --> 03:04:34.538]  Norman, Red, Jack.
[03:04:34.538 --> 03:04:39.561]  We're gonna come back to those callers as well, but don't hang up, Joseph, in Ireland.
[03:04:39.561 --> 03:04:42.263]  Yeah, no, this is clearly China lost the war.
[03:04:42.263 --> 03:04:47.267]  It's globalists lost the war, and now the guy Mira is striking back.
[03:04:47.267 --> 03:04:48.067]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:48.067 --> 03:04:48.508]  Stay with us.

[03:06:01.384 --> 03:06:03.565]  Mainstream media.
[03:06:03.565 --> 03:06:05.427]  Government cover-ups.
[03:06:05.427 --> 03:06:07.128]  You want to stop tyranny?

[03:06:08.810 --> 03:06:15.555]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:15.555 --> 03:06:18.757]  So, China has this virus that's out there.
[03:06:18.757 --> 03:06:27.865]  Now we're told it's America's fault, President Trump's fault, and the markets are plunging, and the left is praising it, and MSNBC journalist claims, calling coronavirus, Wuhan virus, is racist.
[03:06:29.059 --> 03:06:32.221]  Yes, it's all going on in a big, big way.
[03:06:32.221 --> 03:06:35.783]  And I was just talking to Joseph in Ireland, but we went to break.
[03:06:35.783 --> 03:06:36.844]  Joseph, recap.
[03:06:36.844 --> 03:06:42.227]  I mean, the Chi-Coms have lost the war, so now they're not taking it lying down.
[03:06:42.227 --> 03:06:43.088]  Give us your take.
[03:06:43.088 --> 03:06:44.569]  Start over.
[03:06:44.569 --> 03:06:50.573]  OK, look, if you know your history, you know history, Alex, better than anybody.
[03:06:50.573 --> 03:06:54.055]  The Japanese had two choices, go on their knees or go to war.
[03:06:54.055 --> 03:06:55.296]  They went to war.
[03:06:55.296 --> 03:06:57.497]  Now, the difference between Japan and China is,
[03:06:58.089 --> 03:07:00.792]  Japan didn't have America's factories.
[03:07:00.792 --> 03:07:02.734]  China has your factories.
[03:07:02.734 --> 03:07:05.316]  They ain't giving them back.
[03:07:05.316 --> 03:07:07.478]  So they've turned their country into a gulag.
[03:07:07.478 --> 03:07:12.423]  They released the virus because it's a virus to start the war, to cut the fat.
[03:07:12.423 --> 03:07:16.207]  So they're going to use it to get rid of all their old so they'll have extra food supplies.
[03:07:16.207 --> 03:07:17.948]  Their military is gearing up their factories.
[03:07:17.948 --> 03:07:20.210]  They're not going to turn over to military production.
[03:07:20.210 --> 03:07:20.671]  Meanwhile,
[03:07:21.135 --> 03:07:22.736]  America will descend into chaos.
[03:07:22.736 --> 03:07:24.717]  This is a narrow street at your stock market.
[03:07:24.717 --> 03:07:25.618]  It will collapse.
[03:07:25.618 --> 03:07:26.598]  I'm sorry.
[03:07:26.598 --> 03:07:28.740]  I'm not here to demoralize.
[03:07:28.740 --> 03:07:29.580]  No, but I see it.
[03:07:29.580 --> 03:07:34.683]  It's a double-edged weapon to shut down Taiwan, to shut down their own people, to make them the victim.
[03:07:34.683 --> 03:07:39.466]  The whole corporate media says they're the angel, and then Trump's the bad guy for the Wuhan virus.
[03:07:39.466 --> 03:07:40.787]  We're not supposed to call it Wuhan.
[03:07:40.787 --> 03:07:42.428]  You can see the scripting.
[03:07:42.428 --> 03:07:44.149]  I don't think the dog's gonna hunt.
[03:07:44.149 --> 03:07:49.672]  I think the average American is gonna see through a foreign authoritarian regime's attack and not buy it.
[03:07:50.089 --> 03:07:53.671]  Yeah, but the problem is, Alex, this virus is real.
[03:07:53.671 --> 03:07:56.313]  It's going to leave children scared for life.
[03:07:56.313 --> 03:07:57.534]  It's going to wipe out the old.
[03:07:57.534 --> 03:08:01.376]  This virus was made to order.
[03:08:01.376 --> 03:08:04.058]  Yeah, and the CHICOMS have released a bioweapon.
[03:08:04.058 --> 03:08:08.160]  And the left is... Why is the left cheering it then?
[03:08:08.160 --> 03:08:09.181]  It's going to be so deadly.
[03:08:09.181 --> 03:08:11.042]  Don't they know they'll be blamed later?
[03:08:11.042 --> 03:08:15.104]  The Democratic Party, the Liberals are cheering this virus.
[03:08:15.104 --> 03:08:15.745]  No, you see, Alex,
[03:08:17.379 --> 03:08:22.042]  This tsunami will overwhelm everything and only what's going to happen... Exactly.
[03:08:22.042 --> 03:08:23.983]  They don't care what happened before.
[03:08:23.983 --> 03:08:25.504]  This is their big assault.
[03:08:25.504 --> 03:08:26.365]  This is it.
[03:08:26.365 --> 03:08:36.131]  And Alex, okay, the end line here is the collapse of the currencies and they're going to force us to take the mark of the beast, which is the chip.
[03:08:36.131 --> 03:08:37.391]  That's the bit here.
[03:08:37.391 --> 03:08:37.932]  One more go.
[03:08:37.932 --> 03:08:44.596]  When I said to you in another episode, I said, God is going to step in here at some stage soon.
[03:08:44.596 --> 03:08:46.617]  We will get a final warning before the war.
[03:08:47.423 --> 03:08:50.144]  But people will not change.
[03:08:50.144 --> 03:08:53.845]  And this is happening, and I'm going to the Bible now.
[03:08:53.845 --> 03:08:58.526]  This is happening because we're murdering our children.
[03:08:58.526 --> 03:09:00.066]  And this is a plague, Alex.
[03:09:00.066 --> 03:09:01.987]  This is straight from the Bible.
[03:09:01.987 --> 03:09:04.608]  The river of blood now in Turkey.
[03:09:04.608 --> 03:09:08.749]  Sure, if you give your children a mullet, God will send plagues at you.
[03:09:08.749 --> 03:09:09.649]  And the reality is,
[03:09:10.740 --> 03:09:17.304]  In the Bible, when Moses went into Egypt to release the Jews, the first thing he did was turn the river to blood.
[03:09:17.304 --> 03:09:19.205]  And the Egyptians knew what that meant.
[03:09:19.205 --> 03:09:20.886]  That meant there was death coming.
[03:09:20.886 --> 03:09:24.748]  But they were stubborn and they refused because Pharaoh was proud.
[03:09:24.748 --> 03:09:30.291]  Well, there's rivers of blood now in Turkey and that will have meaning soon.
[03:09:30.291 --> 03:09:34.893]  There will be... The wars are coming because they've destabilized the world.
[03:09:34.893 --> 03:09:35.514]  Oh, you're right.
[03:09:35.514 --> 03:09:39.316]  We're in a World War II, World War II moment where everything's popping off now.
[03:09:40.151 --> 03:09:40.871]  Yes, yes.
[03:09:40.871 --> 03:09:46.893]  And I'm sorry, I don't want to be doom and gloom, but the reality is either God is right or he's wrong.
[03:09:46.893 --> 03:09:48.354]  And God is right as far as I'm concerned.
[03:09:48.354 --> 03:09:49.214]  The Bible is correct.
[03:09:49.214 --> 03:09:55.697]  And the Bible talks about us going under a one world government where all power will be handed up to the Antichrist.
[03:09:55.697 --> 03:09:58.798]  Now the Pope is beaverly going around the false Pope.
[03:09:58.798 --> 03:10:02.179]  He's beaverly going around putting in place the one world church.
[03:10:02.179 --> 03:10:04.620]  The one world government is in place.
[03:10:04.620 --> 03:10:05.340]  Oh, you're right.
[03:10:05.340 --> 03:10:07.281]  It's all being put in place and it will exist.
[03:10:07.961 --> 03:10:09.281]  For one year.
[03:10:09.281 --> 03:10:10.162]  I appreciate your call.
[03:10:10.162 --> 03:10:11.462]  We've got to jam in some others here.
[03:10:11.462 --> 03:10:12.443]  Great call, though.
[03:10:12.443 --> 03:10:13.603]  Norman in Washington.
[03:10:13.603 --> 03:10:14.163]  You're on the air.
[03:10:14.163 --> 03:10:16.464]  Thanks, Norman.
[03:10:16.464 --> 03:10:17.365]  Hello, Alex.
[03:10:17.365 --> 03:10:18.325]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:10:18.325 --> 03:10:19.765]  Thank you, brother.
[03:10:19.765 --> 03:10:20.986]  I've been a longtime listener.
[03:10:20.986 --> 03:10:21.846]  I love your products.
[03:10:21.846 --> 03:10:23.547]  I take X2 every day.
[03:10:23.547 --> 03:10:26.288]  I just love you getting the products to keep us on air, but they are great products.
[03:10:26.288 --> 03:10:30.950]  All right, I've got to get this theory out before I forget.
[03:10:30.950 --> 03:10:34.331]  It's my belief that there is no virus, that what's going on is
[03:10:35.060 --> 03:10:38.942]  Mass propaganda by the media in order to make us all think there's a virus.
[03:10:38.942 --> 03:10:44.465]  You get the common flu, you go downtown, you go to the hospital, which they don't want you to go, and you go get tested.
[03:10:44.465 --> 03:10:49.027]  And that's when they selectively infect you with the test from China.
[03:10:49.027 --> 03:10:50.548]  Because everything is made in China, right?
[03:10:50.548 --> 03:10:51.909]  All the kits are made in China.
[03:10:51.909 --> 03:10:54.670]  All our medicine is made in China, right?
[03:10:54.670 --> 03:10:57.852]  That's another reason why we didn't get the test kits right up front because, you know,
[03:10:59.006 --> 03:11:00.827]  There was a delay getting the kits here.
[03:11:00.827 --> 03:11:05.889]  And China's the savior advising everyone now on how to deal with it.
[03:11:05.889 --> 03:11:09.970]  They're going to come teach us how to lock people up and arrest them and kill them.
[03:11:09.970 --> 03:11:12.471]  Not only that, but the children.
[03:11:12.471 --> 03:11:14.212]  You notice the children aren't getting sick.
[03:11:14.212 --> 03:11:18.333]  That's because they're not giving the bad test strips or the test kits to the children.
[03:11:18.333 --> 03:11:19.454]  They don't want to kill the children, right?
[03:11:19.454 --> 03:11:20.534]  They just want to take out the old.
[03:11:21.278 --> 03:11:23.939]  Oh, everybody's texting me, including my wife, like an hour ago.
[03:11:23.939 --> 03:11:26.000]  It's like, I think it's to kill old people.
[03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:27.381]  Absolutely.
[03:11:27.381 --> 03:11:30.582]  This is a sickening, disgusting, globalist operation.
[03:11:30.582 --> 03:11:33.383]  The good news is, I think people are seeing through it, Norman.
[03:11:33.383 --> 03:11:34.264]  It's a psyop.
[03:11:34.264 --> 03:11:37.365]  It really is a mass psyop, and we're being under attack right now by China.
[03:11:37.365 --> 03:11:38.025]  We're at war.
[03:11:38.025 --> 03:11:39.806]  We're at war right now.
[03:11:39.806 --> 03:11:40.866]  No, that's it.
[03:11:40.866 --> 03:11:42.047]  And the globalists are allied with them.
[03:11:42.047 --> 03:11:42.707]  Thank you, Norman.
[03:11:42.707 --> 03:11:44.668]  Thank you so much for calling Amazing Points.
[03:11:44.668 --> 03:11:46.109]  Jack in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[03:11:46.109 --> 03:11:46.469]  Go ahead.
[03:11:47.441 --> 03:11:48.202]  What's up, Alex?
[03:11:48.202 --> 03:11:51.127]  I have seven angles about coronavirus that no one's talked about.
[03:11:51.127 --> 03:11:57.278]  These are just some wild conspiracy theories I believe are going on in regards to the novel coronavirus.
[03:11:57.278 --> 03:11:59.622]  First, it's a great opportunity to
[03:12:02.526 --> 03:12:11.551]  Harvest people and do eugenics via demo Chai Com social credit score based euthanasia in hospitals in the guise of pandemic mitigation.
[03:12:11.551 --> 03:12:12.172]  No, exactly.
[03:12:12.172 --> 03:12:17.895]  They're arresting their political opposition and you never asked where they went because they're already walling up buildings.
[03:12:17.895 --> 03:12:20.157]  They're already shooting people at checkpoints.
[03:12:20.157 --> 03:12:24.459]  It's a perfect cover for a clamp down on political dissidence.
[03:12:24.459 --> 03:12:27.261]  Secondarily, it is a dirty little secret that
[03:12:27.893 --> 03:12:33.057]  All our poo and waste water gets analyzed by supercomputers, so I think the U.S.
[03:12:33.057 --> 03:12:39.161]  knows exactly who's got the virus, or coronavirus, or anything for that matter.
[03:12:39.161 --> 03:12:45.146]  Well, there is genetic testing that's been around for 20 years that takes your genetic profile with what's happening in the sewer and tests it.
[03:12:45.146 --> 03:12:47.307]  Exactly, that's how crazy this is.
[03:12:47.307 --> 03:12:49.549]  Anything else, Jack?
[03:12:49.549 --> 03:12:55.053]  Tertiary, I don't know if you saw the video footage from Juan of the birds acting very weird.
[03:12:55.635 --> 03:13:02.918]  The abnormal bird activity signifies 5G playing a part in at least weakening the immune wall.
[03:13:02.918 --> 03:13:03.679]  Quintarily.
[03:13:03.679 --> 03:13:05.820]  Oh yeah, this is a giant test takeover.
[03:13:05.820 --> 03:13:06.900]  Thank you, Jack.
[03:13:06.900 --> 03:13:10.542]  Gerald Cilente is about to take over, then the war room with Owen Schroeder.
[03:13:11.877 --> 03:13:13.078]  I did a special report Saturday.
[03:13:13.078 --> 03:13:14.019]  I'll probably be back for tonight.
[03:13:14.019 --> 03:13:15.660]  There's so much happening.
[03:13:15.660 --> 03:13:22.625]  The point is, this is the big corporate interest trying to maintain their control, exacerbating crises that already exist.
[03:13:22.625 --> 03:13:26.207]  We'll get Gerald Solendez to take half this break, but real fast, last caller.
[03:13:26.207 --> 03:13:27.848]  Red in Texas.
[03:13:27.848 --> 03:13:28.449]  You're on the air.
[03:13:28.449 --> 03:13:30.130]  What's your view on this?
[03:13:30.130 --> 03:13:30.630]  Hey, man.
[03:13:30.630 --> 03:13:36.335]  First of all, I just want to tell you, Red is short for Red Wolf the animal, and the globalists better be afraid of me.
[03:13:36.335 --> 03:13:37.195]  That's all I'll say.
[03:13:37.195 --> 03:13:38.196]  I hear you, brother.
[03:13:39.031 --> 03:13:41.712]  I wanted to plug your silver toothpaste real quick.
[03:13:41.712 --> 03:13:47.054]  My teeth look the best they've looked in years after about a month of using the product.
[03:13:47.054 --> 03:13:48.634]  It's amazing.
[03:13:48.634 --> 03:13:56.217]  Second thing real quick, I wanted to say if this is a hoax, this coronavirus thing, that's one of the stupidest things a globalist could have done.
[03:13:56.217 --> 03:13:59.918]  When you have people that aren't prepared, they're easy to push around.
[03:13:59.918 --> 03:14:05.580]  All of us patriots, we're preparing now, we're stocking up on food and ammo, and we're going to be ready to fight if we have to.
[03:14:05.580 --> 03:14:08.321]  That was one of the stupidest things they could have done if this was a hoax.
[03:14:11.474 --> 03:14:22.900]  Savannah Hernandez is one of the most beautiful women in the entire world and I would gladly step into a ring with 50 other men and fight to the death for a chance at her hand.
[03:14:22.900 --> 03:14:25.562]  Savannah is very smart and very good.
[03:14:25.562 --> 03:14:29.144]  I hear you brother, I appreciate your call Red.
[03:14:29.144 --> 03:14:32.066]  Gut level though, how bad does this get?
[03:14:36.288 --> 03:14:36.588]  All right.
[03:14:36.588 --> 03:14:37.589]  He's gone.
[03:14:37.589 --> 03:14:37.990]  He's gone.
[03:14:37.990 --> 03:14:38.770]  All right.
[03:14:38.770 --> 03:14:39.531]  I'm going to go to break.
[03:14:39.531 --> 03:14:42.153]  Gerald Slunday for three segments is taking over.
[03:14:42.153 --> 03:14:43.054]  Trends Forecaster.
[03:14:43.054 --> 03:14:44.695]  Can't wait to hear what he has to say.
[03:14:44.695 --> 03:14:46.917]  And then Owen takes over after that.
[03:14:46.917 --> 03:14:48.859]  So you have to find Owen for Savannah.
[03:14:48.859 --> 03:14:52.342]  But please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, there's no panacea.
[03:14:52.342 --> 03:14:53.523]  There's no silver bullet.
[03:14:53.523 --> 03:14:54.684]  But there is nano silver.
[03:14:54.684 --> 03:14:55.945]  We have the very best.
[03:14:55.945 --> 03:14:57.367]  And then FortWorthStore.com.
[03:14:57.367 --> 03:14:58.488]  There are great products you need.
[03:14:59.068 --> 03:15:00.209]  And it funds the operation.
[03:15:00.209 --> 03:15:03.070]  We have the ultimate turmeric formula bodies.
[03:15:03.070 --> 03:15:07.993]  We also have DNA Force Plus with PQQ and CoQ10 back in stock, all 40% off.
[03:15:07.993 --> 03:15:09.654]  And that funds our operation.
[03:15:09.654 --> 03:15:10.715]  And if you want storable food...
[03:15:12.051 --> 03:15:14.352]  It's sold out everywhere, but in full force.
[03:15:14.352 --> 03:15:17.735]  But it takes six to eight weeks to get it to you, because they've got to package it and get it out.
[03:15:17.735 --> 03:15:20.056]  So go to the grocery store and stock up there.
[03:15:20.056 --> 03:15:26.000]  Because whether this virus is super deadly or not, the panic and the insanity and what's happened to the stock market is very real.
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:27.581]  Down over 2,000 points.

[03:15:29.202 --> 03:15:32.324]  He'll break it down on the other side of this break.
[03:15:32.984 --> 03:15:35.587]  And whatever you do, please don't upset the globalists.
[03:15:35.587 --> 03:15:41.292]  Do not tell folks about NewsWorks.com or Infoworks.com or Vandal Video.

[03:15:44.836 --> 03:15:45.857]  Do not do it.
[03:15:45.857 --> 03:15:46.317]  Do not.
[03:15:51.710 --> 03:15:54.731]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[03:15:54.731 --> 03:15:57.633]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[03:17:27.533 --> 03:17:30.355]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[03:17:52.466 --> 03:17:55.708]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world.
[03:17:55.708 --> 03:17:58.090]  A lot of people that never deliver.
[03:17:58.090 --> 03:18:11.340]  Well, I'm here to tell you, InfoWars has delivered in royal flush, in a handful of ace of spades, because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at InfoWars.
[03:18:11.340 --> 03:18:14.683]  And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:18:14.683 --> 03:18:18.586]  So right now, humanity is awakening, it's explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible.
[03:18:19.366 --> 03:18:28.709]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road, and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game on Jim Folwar's Citizenship of the Spirit is your financial support.
[03:18:28.709 --> 03:18:31.550]  We make it really easy at jimfolwarstore.com.
[03:18:31.550 --> 03:18:35.651]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now with our
[03:18:37.773 --> 03:18:38.174]  We're good.
[03:18:52.307 --> 03:19:00.635]  I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by all the work to help people be prepared.
[03:19:00.635 --> 03:19:07.582]  And instead of just giving into sickness care, take care of their health, take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality.
[03:19:07.582 --> 03:19:09.704]  And I say that from personal experience.
[03:19:09.824 --> 03:19:24.718]  Because I know that the products that are being offered here, I've tried them and I use them every day, and that power pack that they have, the AM-PM power pack, well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[03:19:24.718 --> 03:19:28.422]  I just wanted to start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember that
[03:19:28.422 --> 03:19:46.787]  But beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think about these great events in the world, one of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself, remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for good purpose, for our families and for our communities.
[03:19:46.787 --> 03:19:52.069]  And right now, folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the future of America.
[03:19:55.473 --> 03:20:12.348]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:12.348 --> 03:20:14.731]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:14.731 --> 03:20:17.473]  It's Gerald Solente.
[03:20:17.473 --> 03:20:20.296]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.918 --> 03:20:24.959]  Hello, hello!
[03:20:24.959 --> 03:20:32.480]  I'm glad I'm over here and you're over there, that the goodbye-Rosie-Queen-of-Corona virus might get you, you know?
[03:20:32.480 --> 03:20:38.662]  I gotta tell you, in my entire life, I've never seen a spectacle like this before.
[03:20:38.662 --> 03:20:51.805]  The prostitutes, the media whores, they get paid by their corporate pimps and their government whoremasters to sell propaganda and those
[03:20:52.878 --> 03:21:19.650]  Puppet masters, you know, those leaders of the PAC, those presidents and prime ministers, those governors, those senators, those congressmen, right down to your local town official, official puppet, are destroying the global economy.
[03:21:19.650 --> 03:21:22.371]  Nothing like this ever seen
[03:21:24.335 --> 03:21:26.116]  in the world.
[03:21:26.116 --> 03:21:30.660]  Not even History Part 1 or Part 2.
[03:21:30.660 --> 03:21:43.270]  New York City Mayor urges New Yorkers to work from home, get mental health counseling, and jerk off
[03:21:43.945 --> 03:21:47.927]  Over there, de Blasio, you need mental health.
[03:21:47.927 --> 03:21:49.688]  You're a nobody.
[03:21:49.688 --> 03:21:53.590]  You're a piece of low-life garbage crap.
[03:21:53.590 --> 03:21:56.412]  By their deeds, you shall know them.
[03:21:56.412 --> 03:21:59.734]  You're the one that needs a mental health examination.
[03:21:59.734 --> 03:22:05.016]  Oh, now we got the other guy up here, the clown Cuomo.
[03:22:05.016 --> 03:22:08.778]  Yeah, you know, his little brother over there, eh, Chrissy.
[03:22:08.778 --> 03:22:09.899]  Chrissy Cuomo.
[03:22:09.899 --> 03:22:13.341]  Two little boys born on third base and thought they had a home run.
[03:22:14.226 --> 03:22:26.471]  Chrissy wouldn't be on CNN and arrogant Andy wouldn't be playing Governor of New York if Daddy wasn't there before him!
[03:22:26.471 --> 03:22:30.593]  We did it in our Trends Journal as this was happening last week.
[03:22:30.593 --> 03:22:35.275]  When all of a sudden Andy Cuomo decided, I'm gonna give myself power!
[03:22:35.275 --> 03:22:37.236]  I'm gonna give myself power!
[03:22:37.236 --> 03:22:40.137]  I'm gonna declare emergencies anytime I want!
[03:22:40.137 --> 03:22:42.038]  I know more than everybody!
[03:22:44.119 --> 03:22:48.463]  Oh, and the way the prostitutes pump this up!
[03:22:48.463 --> 03:22:49.523]  Mon ami.
[03:22:49.523 --> 03:22:50.424]  You ready?
[03:22:50.424 --> 03:22:52.786]  Here we go.
[03:22:52.786 --> 03:22:56.929]  You read the headlines.
[03:22:56.929 --> 03:23:04.155]  New York declares state of emergency over coronavirus outbreak.
[03:23:04.155 --> 03:23:11.461]  Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency on Saturday as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases increased.
[03:23:12.659 --> 03:23:16.601]  To 89!
[03:23:16.601 --> 03:23:16.981]  89!
[03:23:16.981 --> 03:23:18.822]  These are cases!
[03:23:18.822 --> 03:23:21.363]  These aren't deaths!
[03:23:21.363 --> 03:23:24.344]  These are cases!
[03:23:24.344 --> 03:23:31.708]  Cases of influenza!
[03:23:31.708 --> 03:23:33.288]  89 people, and now the number's up.
[03:23:33.288 --> 03:23:36.110]  I don't want to get the right number here because that was Saturday.
[03:23:36.110 --> 03:23:36.490]  We're up to 142!
[03:23:36.490 --> 03:23:37.370]  142 cases in New York State!
[03:23:42.253 --> 03:23:43.654]  Hmm.
[03:23:43.654 --> 03:23:45.916]  20 million people, huh?
[03:23:45.916 --> 03:23:47.678]  20 million people.
[03:23:47.678 --> 03:23:48.038]  You got 142 cases.
[03:23:48.038 --> 03:23:56.105]  And, uh... I don't know how many people died.
[03:23:56.105 --> 03:23:58.667]  Couldn't be that many.
[03:23:58.667 --> 03:24:00.869]  Because, um... Oh, oh!
[03:24:00.869 --> 03:24:01.690]  New York City?
[03:24:01.690 --> 03:24:05.753]  New York City?
[03:24:05.753 --> 03:24:06.754]  Jerk.
[03:24:06.754 --> 03:24:07.995]  Off.
[03:24:07.995 --> 03:24:08.796]  de Blasio.
[03:24:10.770 --> 03:24:13.251]  20 confirmed cases so far.
[03:24:13.251 --> 03:24:13.971]  How many died?
[03:24:13.971 --> 03:24:16.312]  20 confirmed cases.
[03:24:16.312 --> 03:24:17.693]  How many people in New York City have?
[03:24:17.693 --> 03:24:20.834]  What, about 7 million?
[03:24:20.834 --> 03:24:24.815]  The fear and hysteria that's being sold.
[03:24:24.815 --> 03:24:26.816]  You know that I call the greatest depression.
[03:24:26.816 --> 03:24:31.718]  I did it on David Knight's show probably a year ago.
[03:24:31.718 --> 03:24:34.058]  I said it would happen in 2021.
[03:24:34.058 --> 03:24:36.259]  Guess what?
[03:24:36.259 --> 03:24:38.620]  The greatest depression's already happened.
[03:24:43.513 --> 03:24:53.039]  22 deaths in a country of 327 million people.
[03:24:53.039 --> 03:24:54.199]  Nothing.
[03:24:54.199 --> 03:24:56.501]  Nothing.
[03:24:56.501 --> 03:25:00.843]  And again.
[03:25:00.843 --> 03:25:04.465]  Here we go.
[03:25:04.465 --> 03:25:08.647]  This is according to the New England Journal of Medicine.
[03:25:08.647 --> 03:25:11.649]  Patients of 59 years with higher morbidity
[03:25:12.961 --> 03:25:20.036]  And mortality among the elderly and among those with coexisting conditions.
[03:25:20.036 --> 03:25:24.024]  Of note, there were no cases in children younger than 15 years of age.
[03:25:24.824 --> 03:25:26.645]  Oh, and then they got this picture.
[03:25:26.645 --> 03:25:29.566]  They got this picture of de Blasio.
[03:25:29.566 --> 03:25:30.786]  They're announcing it.
[03:25:30.786 --> 03:25:34.408]  And it was this little, you know, this little side show.
[03:25:34.408 --> 03:25:35.288]  And there he is.
[03:25:35.288 --> 03:25:36.729]  They're hitting elbows.
[03:25:36.729 --> 03:25:38.250]  You can't shake hands.
[03:25:38.250 --> 03:25:42.451]  And in Italy, I'm ashamed as an Italian.
[03:25:42.451 --> 03:25:49.494]  I'm ashamed of what's going on in Italy and the Italian people for taking the crap.
[03:25:49.494 --> 03:25:50.254]  Look at this jerk.
[03:25:50.254 --> 03:25:51.175]  Look at this de Blasio.
[03:25:51.175 --> 03:25:51.595]  You know what they're
[03:25:54.457 --> 03:25:57.180]  Don't kiss on the cheeks.
[03:25:57.180 --> 03:25:59.763]  Don't kiss on the cheeks.
[03:25:59.763 --> 03:26:01.244]  Elbow foot.
[03:26:01.244 --> 03:26:03.226]  Ah yeah, I got that for you.
[03:26:03.226 --> 03:26:05.248]  Who's telling me this crap?
[03:26:05.248 --> 03:26:08.171]  A lot of low-life politicians.
[03:26:08.171 --> 03:26:10.274]  Pieces of garbage.
[03:26:10.274 --> 03:26:14.818]  Political manure.
[03:26:14.818 --> 03:26:17.101]  Giving us rules and telling us what to do.
[03:26:20.396 --> 03:26:24.879]  They say that the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%.
[03:26:24.879 --> 03:26:27.900]  This is only according to the New England Journal of Medicine.
[03:26:27.900 --> 03:26:29.681]  But why listen to them?
[03:26:29.681 --> 03:26:34.264]  Listen to your politician tell you what to do.
[03:26:34.264 --> 03:26:38.507]  Giving you emergency laws to tell you what to do.
[03:26:38.507 --> 03:26:40.107]  You go over that line.
[03:26:40.107 --> 03:26:42.309]  We got the guys dressed up over there.
[03:26:42.309 --> 03:26:44.850]  They'll blow your brains out.
[03:26:44.850 --> 03:26:45.371]  None of that.
[03:26:45.371 --> 03:26:48.732]  No kissing like that.
[03:26:48.732 --> 03:26:49.613]  Disgusting.
[03:26:50.523 --> 03:26:52.504]  Disgusting what's going on.
[03:26:52.504 --> 03:26:54.885]  And the peoples are buying it.
[03:26:54.885 --> 03:26:57.886]  And they're buying it along the party lines.
[03:26:57.886 --> 03:26:58.867]  The Repulsivekins?
[03:26:58.867 --> 03:27:00.087]  They don't think it's so bad.
[03:27:00.087 --> 03:27:02.168]  The Dumbo Craps?
[03:27:02.168 --> 03:27:03.329]  Ah, this is terrible.
[03:27:03.329 --> 03:27:04.890]  Yeah, these are only reported cases.
[03:27:04.890 --> 03:27:06.630]  They didn't test everybody.
[03:27:06.630 --> 03:27:08.391]  How many people died?
[03:27:08.391 --> 03:27:11.032]  Could you count how many people died?
[03:27:11.032 --> 03:27:17.615]  Oh, and most of the people that died in America died over there in Washington State.
[03:27:17.615 --> 03:27:18.776]  In a nursing home.
[03:27:20.902 --> 03:27:25.224]  And who are all elderly and chronically ill.
[03:27:25.224 --> 03:27:32.827]  That's the majority of the 22 in a society of 327 million people.
[03:27:32.827 --> 03:27:34.948]  Oh, and it's a terrible outbreak.
[03:27:34.948 --> 03:27:37.569]  Yeah, like that cholera epidemic.
[03:27:37.569 --> 03:27:40.970]  And that Ebola epidemic over there in Yemen.
[03:27:40.970 --> 03:27:47.313]  And who cares about all the people dying over there in Yemen?
[03:27:47.313 --> 03:27:47.773]  Ebola.
[03:27:50.410 --> 03:27:50.830]  Cool.
[03:27:50.830 --> 03:27:55.892]  Who cares what they get?
[03:27:55.892 --> 03:28:00.314]  Our friends, the murderers-in-chief, the Great Vietas, the Saudis, they did it.
[03:28:00.314 --> 03:28:00.974]  That's okay.
[03:28:00.974 --> 03:28:04.316]  They're our allies.
[03:28:04.316 --> 03:28:06.296]  This is sick what's going on.
[03:28:06.296 --> 03:28:09.478]  It's bringing down the global economy.
[03:28:09.478 --> 03:28:12.459]  Nothing like this before.
[03:28:12.459 --> 03:28:17.181]  Look at the low lives that are bringing life low.
[03:28:17.181 --> 03:28:17.661]  In Italy.
[03:28:18.323 --> 03:28:24.850]  I'm ashamed of the Italian people as a Napolitano, born in the Bronx.
[03:28:24.850 --> 03:28:34.400]  I'm ashamed of the Italian people where they just closed down a quarter of the country.
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:38.204]  And they're not fighting back.
[03:28:38.204 --> 03:28:40.246]  Everybody's bowing down.
[03:28:41.857 --> 03:28:45.219]  Goodbye Rosie, queen of coronavirus.
[03:28:45.219 --> 03:28:47.760]  See me and Julio down by the schoolyard.
[03:28:47.760 --> 03:28:51.763]  No down by the schoolyard, but we'll be back in just a few.
[03:28:51.763 --> 03:28:54.784]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[03:28:54.784 --> 03:28:57.686]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[03:29:52.907 --> 03:29:55.508]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.

[03:30:02.490 --> 03:30:12.934]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[03:30:13.374 --> 03:30:19.638]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[03:30:19.638 --> 03:30:20.619]  It is back in stock.
[03:30:20.619 --> 03:30:29.845]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[03:30:29.845 --> 03:30:37.289]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[03:30:37.289 --> 03:30:37.750]  And of course,
[03:30:38.570 --> 03:30:45.342]  Vladimir 12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[03:30:45.342 --> 03:30:46.544]  And they're both back in stock.
[03:30:46.544 --> 03:30:51.452]  40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:30:52.984 --> 03:30:54.545]  Hanuman, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[03:30:54.545 --> 03:30:55.686]  What do you think is really going on?
[03:30:55.686 --> 03:30:56.426]  And thanks for calling.
[03:30:56.426 --> 03:30:58.488]  So yes, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago.
[03:30:58.488 --> 03:30:59.148]  I was getting ready.
[03:30:59.148 --> 03:31:02.931]  I went to buy a bunch of toilet paper and some things before crowds really hit.
[03:31:02.931 --> 03:31:07.574]  And I had my phone, I had my show going on, the signal in my pocket so I could hear it.
[03:31:07.574 --> 03:31:08.755]  I wasn't using headphones.
[03:31:08.755 --> 03:31:11.136]  And this lady starts, she says, who are you listening to?
[03:31:11.136 --> 03:31:12.057]  Who's that talking?
[03:31:12.057 --> 03:31:13.338]  I said, this is Alex Jones.
[03:31:13.338 --> 03:31:16.700]  And she just got, her eyes got wide open and she says, really?
[03:31:16.700 --> 03:31:17.781]  I thought he was off the air.
[03:31:18.161 --> 03:31:23.347]  And I said no, and I told her, I explained, you know, the whole situation and told her where to go.
[03:31:23.347 --> 03:31:28.152]  She wrote down, you know, Dan.video and also Infowars.com and just said she's still on.
[03:31:28.152 --> 03:31:33.757]  I run into people at the grocery store, at the mall, on the hike and bike trail, and they go, oh, Alex, I used to love you.
[03:31:33.757 --> 03:31:34.899]  I wish you were still on air.
[03:31:34.899 --> 03:31:35.799]  Are you ever going to go back on air?
[03:31:35.799 --> 03:31:36.240]  And I'm like,
[03:31:36.340 --> 03:31:39.341]  We're on hundreds of radio stations, over 100 TV stations and cable stations.
[03:31:39.341 --> 03:31:41.621]  We have our own streams at InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[03:31:41.621 --> 03:31:42.481]  And they go, really?
[03:31:42.481 --> 03:31:47.102]  They said you were off the air because they took the deplatforming as off the air.
[03:31:47.102 --> 03:31:48.763]  No, we have our own platform.
[03:31:48.763 --> 03:31:49.723]  InfoWars!
[03:31:49.723 --> 03:31:50.563]  InfoWars!
[03:31:50.563 --> 03:31:52.524]  InfoWars!
[03:31:52.524 --> 03:31:53.224]  The best product.
[03:31:53.224 --> 03:31:57.805]  I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[03:31:57.805 --> 03:31:59.125]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[03:32:00.523 --> 03:32:02.224]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[03:32:02.224 --> 03:32:03.885]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[03:32:03.885 --> 03:32:04.845]  That was a crazy week.
[03:32:04.845 --> 03:32:16.510]  I don't remember sleeping, but... As far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, and not relying on other people to do it for you.
[03:32:16.510 --> 03:32:17.831]  Nobody wakes up in the morning...
[03:32:19.315 --> 03:32:21.717]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[03:32:21.717 --> 03:32:23.098]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[03:32:23.098 --> 03:32:27.341]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[03:32:27.341 --> 03:32:29.582]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[03:32:29.582 --> 03:32:31.083]  I don't think that happens very often.
[03:32:31.083 --> 03:32:31.884]  It's never happened to me.
[03:32:31.884 --> 03:32:34.806]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[03:32:34.806 --> 03:32:36.507]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[03:32:36.647 --> 03:32:39.410]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[03:32:39.410 --> 03:32:47.397]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com, take control of your health right now, and support the resistance.
[03:32:47.397 --> 03:32:50.720]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[03:32:50.720 --> 03:32:55.484]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[03:32:55.484 --> 03:32:58.107]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.664 --> 03:33:20.545]  Goodbye, Rosie.
[03:33:20.545 --> 03:33:21.866]  We need a coronavirus.
[03:33:21.866 --> 03:33:25.128]  We need Julio down by the schoolyard.
[03:33:25.128 --> 03:33:27.589]  Yep.
[03:33:27.589 --> 03:33:34.393]  The prostitutes and the puppet masters are destroying the global economy.
[03:33:34.393 --> 03:33:38.896]  The leaders, leaders of the pack, are crap.
[03:33:38.896 --> 03:33:42.638]  So let's think about what I just was talking about.
[03:33:42.638 --> 03:33:43.899]  You got one guy.
[03:33:43.899 --> 03:33:46.721]  They had another guy over there.
[03:33:46.721 --> 03:33:47.321]  What's his name?
[03:33:49.301 --> 03:33:53.082]  It starts with an H. Hand something, hand job, this or that.
[03:33:53.082 --> 03:33:57.063]  A guy playing governor over there in Maryland.
[03:33:57.063 --> 03:34:00.724]  Called a state of emergency on Friday.
[03:34:00.724 --> 03:34:01.305]  You know why?
[03:34:01.305 --> 03:34:07.866]  A state of emergency in Maryland for three cases.
[03:34:07.866 --> 03:34:09.327]  Three cases.
[03:34:09.327 --> 03:34:16.489]  These are cases of insanity by freaks and fools running and ruining a country near you.
[03:34:18.283 --> 03:34:24.845]  How many people are shooting Baltimore on Friday night?
[03:34:24.845 --> 03:34:27.046]  You're talking about three cases?
[03:34:27.046 --> 03:34:28.326]  And I'm taking over!
[03:34:28.326 --> 03:34:29.827]  Hey, don't you know who I am?
[03:34:29.827 --> 03:34:35.108]  I'm the Governor!
[03:34:35.108 --> 03:34:36.328]  Three cases!
[03:34:36.328 --> 03:34:37.129]  I'm the Governor!
[03:34:37.129 --> 03:34:38.729]  I'll tell you what to do!
[03:34:38.729 --> 03:34:40.910]  You get back to work!
[03:34:40.910 --> 03:34:45.511]  All you are out there are little people of Slavelandia!
[03:34:45.511 --> 03:34:47.212]  I'm a lowlife boy or girl!
[03:34:53.018 --> 03:34:58.860]  For the corporations and multinationals and whoever else tells me what to do.
[03:34:58.860 --> 03:35:00.121]  I'm in charge.
[03:35:00.121 --> 03:35:01.842]  You get back to work.
[03:35:01.842 --> 03:35:05.083]  And work from home.
[03:35:05.083 --> 03:35:08.204]  Three cases in Maryland!
[03:35:08.204 --> 03:35:13.466]  And the people let these pieces of garbage get away with it.
[03:35:13.466 --> 03:35:16.247]  Here's the big story.
[03:35:16.247 --> 03:35:17.668]  Martial Law 2020.
[03:35:17.668 --> 03:35:18.148]  Got it?
[03:35:22.537 --> 03:35:26.019]  You saw what happened in China.
[03:35:26.019 --> 03:35:28.080]  Quarantining entire cities.
[03:35:28.080 --> 03:35:31.501]  Hundreds of millions of people.
[03:35:31.501 --> 03:35:34.603]  Like that.
[03:35:34.603 --> 03:35:39.285]  And now you're seeing it again.
[03:35:39.285 --> 03:35:40.766]  Italy.
[03:35:40.766 --> 03:35:44.188]  A quarter of the country closed down.
[03:35:44.188 --> 03:35:45.608]  What are these politicians?
[03:35:45.608 --> 03:35:48.109]  Hey, I'm an expert in this stuff!
[03:35:48.109 --> 03:35:50.230]  What are you telling me?
[03:35:50.230 --> 03:35:51.011]  I'll tell you!
[03:35:52.540 --> 03:35:55.221]  I got voted in!
[03:35:55.221 --> 03:35:57.982]  Ignorant, stupid people voted me in!
[03:35:57.982 --> 03:36:05.886]  Actually, that guy, Conte, who's running the show over there, wasn't even voted in.
[03:36:05.886 --> 03:36:07.266]  He was brought in.
[03:36:07.266 --> 03:36:08.787]  Conte.
[03:36:08.787 --> 03:36:11.168]  I like to use the real word for him.
[03:36:11.168 --> 03:36:13.449]  But I get, uh, blackballed.
[03:36:13.449 --> 03:36:13.809]  Oh!
[03:36:13.809 --> 03:36:14.789]  Gotta be careful.
[03:36:14.789 --> 03:36:18.111]  Can't say blackballed, can't say blackballed.
[03:36:18.111 --> 03:36:18.791]  I'm a racist.
[03:36:19.636 --> 03:36:26.499]  Can't say over abroad, over there in Italy, can't say abroad!
[03:36:26.499 --> 03:36:30.681]  That's how ignorant this whole thing is.
[03:36:30.681 --> 03:36:35.463]  Martial law, get it in your heads, everybody!
[03:36:35.463 --> 03:36:38.824]  When this economy goes down, and it's going to go fwoop!
[03:36:38.824 --> 03:36:41.606]  If this thing doesn't reverse real quick.
[03:36:41.606 --> 03:36:42.706]  Yeah.
[03:36:42.706 --> 03:36:46.908]  From our Trends in the News, and by the way, the magazines are weekly now, there's nothing like it anywhere.
[03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:55.594]  ECB looks at options to bolster economy.
[03:36:55.594 --> 03:36:59.537]  Likhaid faces pressure to lower interest rates.
[03:36:59.537 --> 03:37:04.381]  That's Christine Likhaid, the head of the ECB over there.
[03:37:04.381 --> 03:37:11.887]  Former head of the IMF, the International Monetary Fund.
[03:37:11.887 --> 03:37:17.572]  IMF earmarks $50 billion for countries hit by Goodbye Rosie, Queen of Coronavirus.
[03:37:18.689 --> 03:37:22.870]  Limbering fallout of virus puts Italy at risk of recession.
[03:37:22.870 --> 03:37:24.251]  Guess what?
[03:37:24.251 --> 03:37:31.073]  Already in recession, Europe was in recession before this happened, or just going into it.
[03:37:31.073 --> 03:37:40.697]  To make it 100% clear with the facts, last quarter GDP in Europe was 0.1%.
[03:37:45.049 --> 03:37:46.530]  No growth at all.
[03:37:46.530 --> 03:37:48.070]  Now they're going down.
[03:37:48.070 --> 03:37:50.291]  Down, down, down, down, down.
[03:37:50.291 --> 03:37:52.712]  No soccer games, no stadiums.
[03:37:52.712 --> 03:38:04.077]  Here, this is how stupid, this is how stupid the moron imbecile leaders leading the country near you over there in Italy know what they're saying?
[03:38:04.077 --> 03:38:11.220]  If you're standing next to someone, stand at least three or two or one or however many meters away.
[03:38:11.220 --> 03:38:12.861]  A couple of feet.
[03:38:14.181 --> 03:38:17.423]  So when you go to a restaurant, you have to be a couple of feet away.
[03:38:17.423 --> 03:38:17.964]  Ah-choo!
[03:38:17.964 --> 03:38:18.344]  Ha-ha!
[03:38:18.344 --> 03:38:19.185]  Did you get that?
[03:38:19.185 --> 03:38:19.905]  Ah-choo!
[03:38:19.905 --> 03:38:21.927]  You're going to get it all over you now.
[03:38:21.927 --> 03:38:22.947]  You're going to get coronavirus.
[03:38:22.947 --> 03:38:41.461]  Make sure when you sneeze, you say, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, v
[03:38:43.610 --> 03:38:47.752]  And now it's really heading down fast.
[03:38:47.752 --> 03:38:52.053]  Again, you know from my work in the Trends Journal, the data is there.
[03:38:52.053 --> 03:38:53.574]  Don't want to go over it.
[03:38:53.574 --> 03:38:59.416]  The whole world was in an economic slowdown before this happened.
[03:38:59.416 --> 03:39:08.819]  And now, by the unprecedented stupidity of the freaks and fools in charge, they're crashing one industry after another.
[03:39:11.155 --> 03:39:14.176]  Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise?
[03:39:14.176 --> 03:39:15.297]  Ooh wee!
[03:39:15.297 --> 03:39:16.638]  Ooh wee, baby!
[03:39:16.638 --> 03:39:18.318]  No sea cruise!
[03:39:18.318 --> 03:39:19.779]  No sea cruise!
[03:39:19.779 --> 03:39:21.200]  You can't do it!
[03:39:21.200 --> 03:39:23.721]  You're not allowed to do it!
[03:39:23.721 --> 03:39:32.065]  Because you go on a sea cruise, you're going to be on that ship for, hey, maybe who knows forever when!
[03:39:32.065 --> 03:39:34.666]  Want to fly anywhere?
[03:39:34.666 --> 03:39:36.027]  I'm afraid to go flying now.
[03:39:36.027 --> 03:39:37.068]  You know why?
[03:39:37.068 --> 03:39:38.508]  Not because I'm afraid of Rosie.
[03:39:38.508 --> 03:39:38.548]  No.
[03:39:40.188 --> 03:39:49.473]  I'm afraid to go flying now because I love the way they feel me up when I won't go through that metal detector machine over there.
[03:39:49.473 --> 03:39:53.355]  You know, I love the way they feel me up like that.
[03:39:53.355 --> 03:39:57.557]  So now I just can't wait because I won't go through.
[03:39:57.557 --> 03:40:00.818]  So then they go, well, remember, remember, I'm going to put my hands up.
[03:40:00.818 --> 03:40:01.799]  You know what?
[03:40:01.799 --> 03:40:03.039]  And maybe I'll stick your finger up.
[03:40:03.039 --> 03:40:03.139]  Yes.
[03:40:07.026 --> 03:40:08.287]  Now they're going to test you.
[03:40:08.287 --> 03:40:09.208]  That's right.
[03:40:09.208 --> 03:40:14.632]  They'll the morons, the imbeciles at the at the airports.
[03:40:14.632 --> 03:40:15.773]  You could be in a wheelchair.
[03:40:15.773 --> 03:40:17.814]  You could be dying to be a little kid.
[03:40:17.814 --> 03:40:19.415]  We're going to test you now.
[03:40:19.415 --> 03:40:24.199]  They're going to start testing us to everything.
[03:40:24.199 --> 03:40:27.041]  And then they're going to get you get this guy in quarantine.
[03:40:27.765 --> 03:40:28.145]  What's wrong?
[03:40:28.145 --> 03:40:29.346]  I'm feeling fine.
[03:40:29.346 --> 03:40:42.156]  No, no, we came up with a test over here and we're in charge because we're the little people that follow the orders of the people above that we bow down to and suck up to so we can get this job.
[03:40:42.156 --> 03:40:45.238]  Because if I didn't have this job, I'd have no other job in the world.
[03:40:45.238 --> 03:40:53.845]  So I got a useless job filling you up and now I'm going to give you stuff to see how sick you are and maybe how when you're going to die and whatever the things you're else carrying with you.
[03:40:56.172 --> 03:40:57.653]  This is serious.
[03:40:57.653 --> 03:41:11.745]  The airline industry, not only the airline industry, the people that make them, and all the parts that go into them.
[03:41:11.745 --> 03:41:17.809]  Movie theaters face sell-off in shares.
[03:41:17.809 --> 03:41:21.332]  Cancellation wave threatens cruise industry.
[03:41:21.332 --> 03:41:25.596]  Ad agencies pained.
[03:41:26.843 --> 03:41:36.387]  By downturn, particularly in travel, it's one after the other.
[03:41:36.387 --> 03:41:50.414]  UK broadcast ITV PLC warned Thursday that the impact of reduced advertising spending from the leisure and tourism industry would hurt its outlook, sent the stock down 10%.
[03:41:50.414 --> 03:41:52.795]  Movie Theorist, ah!
[03:41:57.651 --> 03:42:01.592]  Outbreak shakes up trade show circuit.
[03:42:01.592 --> 03:42:03.852]  Yeah.
[03:42:03.852 --> 03:42:17.775]  Organizers in Asia, Europe and North America have canceled or postponed at least 440 trade shows and exhibitions in response to... Goodbye Rosie, Queen of Coronavirus.
[03:42:17.775 --> 03:42:21.096]  Do you realize all the people this is hurting?
[03:42:21.096 --> 03:42:23.416]  And how many deaths are there?
[03:42:23.416 --> 03:42:23.776]  What about 3,600, 800?
[03:42:29.076 --> 03:42:30.517]  In a population of how many?
[03:42:30.517 --> 03:42:33.680]  7.7 billion people.
[03:42:33.680 --> 03:42:43.567]  18,000 people died of the flu in the USA since January.
[03:42:43.567 --> 03:42:45.209]  But forget that.
[03:42:45.209 --> 03:42:46.570]  We've got other things to talk about.
[03:42:46.570 --> 03:42:50.112]  When we come back, we'll talk about them all.

[03:44:01.406 --> 03:44:12.018]  Now, whether it's super deadly or not, the issue is it's being used by the globalists as a weapon against the world economy and against nation states and against the populist movement here in America.
[03:44:12.598 --> 03:44:13.860]  And against Infowars.
[03:44:13.860 --> 03:44:15.362]  And that means against you.

[03:45:51.952 --> 03:45:52.972]  Everybody's calling me.
[03:45:52.972 --> 03:46:00.313]  I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[03:46:00.313 --> 03:46:01.754]  How bad is it really?
[03:46:01.754 --> 03:46:04.454]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality storable foods.
[03:46:04.454 --> 03:46:07.415]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation, that actually still has food.
[03:46:07.415 --> 03:46:10.135]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got to package it.
[03:46:10.135 --> 03:46:10.755]  They got the food.
[03:46:10.755 --> 03:46:15.136]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important thing, and that's drink purified water.
[03:46:15.136 --> 03:46:15.916]  That's pray.
[03:46:15.916 --> 03:46:16.596]  That's get focused.
[03:46:16.596 --> 03:46:18.576]  That's not be stressed out because you're prepared.
[03:46:18.576 --> 03:46:21.497]  And that's get DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10 that clean
[03:46:21.817 --> 03:46:22.177]  I think so.
[03:46:55.336 --> 03:46:57.945]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.476 --> 03:47:20.499]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:20.499 --> 03:47:31.165]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:47:31.165 --> 03:47:33.246]  Hey, great to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:33.246 --> 03:47:37.108]  Before I get rosy, the coronavirus gets me.
[03:47:37.108 --> 03:47:44.132]  Hey, listen, I mentioned to you about the prostitutes and the politicians that are destroying
[03:47:45.578 --> 03:47:49.481]  Beauty, joy, liberty and love on earth.
[03:47:49.481 --> 03:47:50.661]  And this is serious.
[03:47:50.661 --> 03:47:53.263]  So you want to keep the truth alive.
[03:47:53.263 --> 03:47:59.167]  And the way you do that is by supporting shows like InfoWars.
[03:47:59.167 --> 03:48:03.750]  And the way you do that is by buying their products.
[03:48:03.750 --> 03:48:09.835]  A number of which I fully support, agree with and love.
[03:48:09.835 --> 03:48:12.556]  DNA Force Plus from InfoWars
[03:48:15.109 --> 03:48:17.850]  Afraid of that virus.
[03:48:17.850 --> 03:48:22.773]  40% off single, 50% off two or more.
[03:48:22.773 --> 03:48:27.135]  Again, they finally got enough DNA Force Plus to bring it back in stock.
[03:48:27.135 --> 03:48:29.236]  And again, a 40% off.
[03:48:29.236 --> 03:48:33.818]  But to make sure you're able to get all you need before it disappears again.
[03:48:33.818 --> 03:48:38.941]  And it's going to be disappearing more and more as this coronavirus fear starts spreading.
[03:48:39.451 --> 03:48:44.132]  They're giving you 50% off when you buy two or more.
[03:48:44.132 --> 03:48:57.716]  DNA Force Plus, it's the perfect formula to help you support optimal energy levels that you need now while adapting your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.
[03:48:57.716 --> 03:49:03.017]  And then toxins are being bombarded on us like never before.
[03:49:03.017 --> 03:49:05.738]  You're afraid of, hey, you're afraid of coronavirus?
[03:49:06.670 --> 03:49:11.072]  You like eating that food with all that pesticides in it?
[03:49:11.072 --> 03:49:13.872]  Hey, you folks in Flint!
[03:49:13.872 --> 03:49:17.654]  Remember Obama, folks?
[03:49:17.654 --> 03:49:21.755]  Said that, um, he was gonna fix that water in Flint.
[03:49:21.755 --> 03:49:23.696]  Still can't drink it?
[03:49:23.696 --> 03:49:24.716]  Eh, don't worry about it.
[03:49:24.716 --> 03:49:27.037]  Coronavirus is gonna get ya.
[03:49:27.037 --> 03:49:29.498]  Hey, you like them GMOs?
[03:49:29.498 --> 03:49:34.240]  How about those artificial flavoring and those artificial colors?
[03:49:34.240 --> 03:49:34.320]  Yeah.
[03:49:36.878 --> 03:49:48.868]  All the crap that they put into our food, into our water, into the air, into the earth, and you're worried about coronavirus?
[03:49:48.868 --> 03:49:58.476]  So you buy these products to keep yourself healthy, while things are going down.
[03:49:58.476 --> 03:50:02.299]  And boy, they're going down.
[03:50:02.299 --> 03:50:03.740]  It's serious.
[03:50:03.740 --> 03:50:04.541]  It's serious.
[03:50:05.891 --> 03:50:16.040]  New Zealand's health ministry confirmed a woman in her 30s who recently returned from Auckland, from Northern Italy.
[03:50:16.040 --> 03:50:18.582]  To Auckland, from Northern Italy.
[03:50:18.582 --> 03:50:20.423]  I've been to Auckland.
[03:50:20.423 --> 03:50:21.464]  And to Northern Italy.
[03:50:21.464 --> 03:50:30.652]  Has coronavirus, the country's second case.
[03:50:30.652 --> 03:50:32.874]  Two people are sick with the flu.
[03:50:39.612 --> 03:50:48.855]  Poland has confirmed its first case of the coronavirus disease.
[03:50:48.855 --> 03:50:51.656]  Whoa!
[03:50:51.656 --> 03:50:58.499]  All right, so this is from the New York Times.
[03:50:58.499 --> 03:51:03.961]  Assessing the risks, disruption of society is likelier than death.
[03:51:03.961 --> 03:51:08.083]  Many cases thought to be mild or asymptomatic, for example.
[03:51:08.584 --> 03:51:11.545]  As they're saying.
[03:51:11.545 --> 03:51:15.305]  For most people, the disease is not lethal.
[03:51:15.305 --> 03:51:27.448]  Health officials tend to put it somewhere within the range of an unusually severe seasonal flu.
[03:51:27.448 --> 03:51:34.669]  Even in a global pandemic, it's expected to kill fewer people than the flu virus.
[03:51:35.947 --> 03:51:45.890]  Fewer people than the flu virus that has already killed 18,000 people in the United States.
[03:51:45.890 --> 03:52:04.195]  Data so far suggests that if you catch Goodbye Rosie, Queen of Coronavirus, you may be likelier to have no symptoms at all!
[03:52:04.195 --> 03:52:05.395]  Well, I can't read this, yeah.
[03:52:07.753 --> 03:52:14.178]  You may require no symptoms at all or require hospitalization.
[03:52:14.178 --> 03:52:26.868]  The coronavirus is thought to be much more dangerous for people over 70 or with existing health conditions such as diabetes.
[03:52:26.868 --> 03:52:32.453]  All right?
[03:52:32.453 --> 03:52:35.215]  And this is also true of the flu.
[03:52:36.206 --> 03:52:43.650]  And that's why when you get the flu and you are critically ill, you got a flu days to live.
[03:52:43.650 --> 03:52:45.711]  And that's what's going on with this.
[03:52:45.711 --> 03:52:53.034]  They're telling people like me in Italy and other places, it's too early to go out.
[03:52:53.034 --> 03:52:53.874]  Stay home.
[03:52:53.874 --> 03:52:56.956]  You got to get the flu.
[03:52:56.956 --> 03:52:57.756]  Stay home.
[03:52:57.756 --> 03:52:59.277]  Coronavirus is going to get you.
[03:52:59.277 --> 03:53:00.398]  Stay home.
[03:53:00.398 --> 03:53:01.938]  And no kissing on the cheeks.
[03:53:04.275 --> 03:53:10.798]  I'll tell you, these people that are giving you orders to kiss on the cheeks, I'll tell them what cheek to kiss on!
[03:53:10.798 --> 03:53:13.079]  Yeah!
[03:53:13.079 --> 03:53:22.202]  Oh, and by the way, number one, what I said, and again, this is all in your trends journal.
[03:53:22.202 --> 03:53:29.925]  We've been writing about this right from the top, saying that this is
[03:53:30.796 --> 03:53:34.399]  Destroying the global economy and to prepare for the future.
[03:53:34.399 --> 03:53:37.281]  We tell you what's going on, what it means, and what's next.
[03:53:37.281 --> 03:53:40.083]  There's no other magazine like it, like, in the world.
[03:53:40.083 --> 03:53:42.665]  And that's why I'm mentioning it here.
[03:53:42.665 --> 03:53:57.677]  Because the other thing that I mentioned to you earlier, the big, the big point here is how easily they can, how they can declare martial law.
[03:53:57.677 --> 03:53:59.579]  Like that!
[03:53:59.579 --> 03:53:59.919]  Jerks!
[03:54:00.680 --> 03:54:13.826]  Off in Maryland, and jerks off in New York, and jerks off in other states and countries calling emergency.
[03:54:13.826 --> 03:54:21.470]  So, when things go down, and this thing hits, business is really bad.
[03:54:21.470 --> 03:54:25.551]  Remember what I said, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[03:54:25.551 --> 03:54:26.772]  You're gonna see violence, crime,
[03:54:27.136 --> 03:54:27.896]  Escalate.
[03:54:27.896 --> 03:54:30.958]  It's going to give more of a cause to clamp down on us.
[03:54:30.958 --> 03:54:36.380]  And again, the reason I said I won't fly right now is I don't want them checking up on me and making my life miserable.
[03:54:36.380 --> 03:54:38.801]  Because I hate flying anyway.
[03:54:38.801 --> 03:54:42.762]  When I was a young man, when I used to fly first class, what would you like, sir?
[03:54:42.762 --> 03:54:44.143]  Lobster Thermidor?
[03:54:44.143 --> 03:54:48.025]  Or they have a roast and they're carving in front of you.
[03:54:48.025 --> 03:54:49.645]  So I hate flying now anyway.
[03:54:49.645 --> 03:54:50.366]  Now I won't go.
[03:54:50.366 --> 03:54:52.146]  But the other big one.
[03:54:52.146 --> 03:54:53.287]  Now hear this.
[03:54:53.287 --> 03:54:53.987]  Now hear this.
[03:54:57.179 --> 03:55:01.521]  The economy's going down.
[03:55:01.521 --> 03:55:08.943]  They have more and more cheap money to pump into the system.
[03:55:08.943 --> 03:55:19.987]  They're going to come out with, they're already doing it, heads up, don't, don't you, don't you dare use
[03:55:27.281 --> 03:55:31.063]  Paper money.
[03:55:31.063 --> 03:55:35.585]  No paper money, you're going to spread them joints.
[03:55:35.585 --> 03:55:39.167]  We got digital dough for you.
[03:55:39.167 --> 03:55:42.168]  You think things are bad?
[03:55:42.168 --> 03:55:45.369]  And the market's going way down?
[03:55:45.369 --> 03:55:48.071]  Economy's crashing?
[03:55:48.071 --> 03:55:49.691]  We can't bail you out.
[03:55:49.691 --> 03:55:52.713]  We're out, Rosie.
[03:55:52.713 --> 03:55:54.674]  But we're going to use her as an excuse.
[03:55:56.263 --> 03:56:01.526]  To get rid of them dollars and them reals and those pesos.
[03:56:01.526 --> 03:56:04.387]  No more Lido.
[03:56:04.387 --> 03:56:06.989]  All gone.
[03:56:06.989 --> 03:56:09.970]  Remember.
[03:56:09.970 --> 03:56:13.772]  They were doing this before Rosie came around.
[03:56:13.772 --> 03:56:17.354]  Digital currencies and now they're doing it.
[03:56:17.354 --> 03:56:19.195]  They're using it to spread the fear.
[03:56:19.195 --> 03:56:21.416]  We've been writing about this in the Trends Journal.
[03:56:22.119 --> 03:56:29.821]  They're going to come up with a new scheme to get rid of those old currencies.
[03:56:29.821 --> 03:56:33.122]  And now you're going digital.
[03:56:33.122 --> 03:56:42.444]  Now, the slimers and the low lives that control our lives, called presidents, chancellors, prime ministers and all the way down.
[03:56:42.444 --> 03:56:46.385]  They will know every penny that you're spending.
[03:56:46.385 --> 03:56:48.185]  Every penny that you're spending.
[03:56:50.248 --> 03:56:53.089]  It's all digital.
[03:56:53.089 --> 03:56:58.310]  Digital currency backed by nothing and printed on nothing.
[03:56:58.310 --> 03:57:04.431]  But we know every dime that you spent and we're going to get every penny in taxes from you.
[03:57:04.431 --> 03:57:10.753]  While we give our big guys and girls a break for free.
[03:57:10.753 --> 03:57:13.193]  Martial law.
[03:57:13.193 --> 03:57:15.814]  Digital currency.
[03:57:15.814 --> 03:57:18.515]  And for me, I don't give financial advice.
[03:57:18.515 --> 03:57:19.675]  My goal forecast
[03:57:20.441 --> 03:57:23.403]  Match him, anybody, anywhere in the world.
[03:57:23.403 --> 03:57:27.766]  He said the Gold Bull run began in June of 2019.
[03:57:27.766 --> 03:57:29.147]  June 6th.
[03:57:29.147 --> 03:57:32.889]  And that Gold Bull is going to keep on running, as I see it.
[03:57:32.889 --> 03:57:35.591]  But you know, think for yourself.
[03:57:35.591 --> 03:57:39.933]  And boy, you better, and girl, you better do a lot of thinking for yourself now.
[03:57:39.933 --> 03:57:40.634]  See you next week.
