[00:00.000 --> 00:16.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.600 --> 00:24.840]  so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[00:24.840 --> 00:29.960]  ladies and gentlemen it's now all confirmed the corona virus is a
[00:29.960 --> 00:33.360]  man made by a weapon launched by the deep state and the globalist through
[00:33.360 --> 00:36.280]  China they hit the United States and bring down the economy they're
[00:36.280 --> 00:40.840]  scripting it all to try to bring down Trump Trump tried to defend China tried
[00:40.840 --> 00:45.600]  to not create hysteria tried to help him and now he is being absolutely set up
[00:45.600 --> 00:50.560]  we have been dead on again and we can stop the globalist plan but it's up to
[00:50.560 --> 00:53.760]  you to get the word out we're gonna lay it all out today and the most important
[00:53.760 --> 01:01.560]  broadcast ever here's a Gregory's report that nails it 25% of the world's
[01:01.560 --> 01:09.240]  generic drugs are made in India and India relies upon China for almost 70% of
[01:09.240 --> 01:15.400]  their active ingredients several of these Chinese sources have shut down due
[01:15.400 --> 01:22.520]  to the Wuhan corona virus and as a result India has restricted exports of 26
[01:22.520 --> 01:27.920]  ingredients and the medicines made from them the United States no longer
[01:27.920 --> 01:36.000]  produces its own medicine how did this happen in the 1990s 90% of these
[01:36.000 --> 01:43.040]  fundamental ingredients were produced in the USA Europe and in Japan but US
[01:43.040 --> 01:50.240]  laws on generic drugs began motivating companies to manufacture in China the
[01:50.240 --> 01:56.520]  greatest win for China came exactly three months after 9-11 on December 11th
[01:56.520 --> 02:05.680]  2001 China joined the World Trade Organization aka the WTO and immediately
[02:05.680 --> 02:10.920]  began wiping out the competition in the American free market with unbeatable
[02:10.920 --> 02:19.320]  low slave labor costs within two years the USA lost their last aspirin
[02:19.320 --> 02:27.600]  penicillin and vitamin C producers today we depend upon China for about 90% of
[02:27.600 --> 02:34.960]  our medicine China has already amassed a reputation for poor quality and because
[02:34.960 --> 02:40.120]  they have monopolized the global market the FDA has been forced to lower their
[02:40.120 --> 02:46.200]  manufacturing standards the low standards in China are likely to blame in
[02:46.200 --> 02:51.520]  part for the many explosions at Chinese pharmaceutical factories that have
[02:51.520 --> 02:59.160]  caused global shortages recently because of the Wuhan corona virus masks were
[02:59.160 --> 03:04.920]  ordered to not be exported from China there are life-sustaining drugs that
[03:04.920 --> 03:10.400]  China is the sole supplier of to the US what happens if China declares an
[03:10.400 --> 03:16.560]  emergency and shuts down all medical supply and drug exports like both India
[03:16.560 --> 03:25.280]  and China are already beginning to do if the WTO is the father of globalism
[03:25.280 --> 03:33.520]  then the UN's insidious replacement migration is its mother and in Italy the
[03:33.520 --> 03:38.880]  man believed to be coronavirus patient zero is a Pakistani migrant who works
[03:38.880 --> 03:44.960]  in food delivery after testing positive for the virus he refused to self
[03:44.960 --> 03:51.080]  isolate and continued to deliver food a recent video of migrants holding babies
[03:51.080 --> 03:56.160]  over fires to make them cry in order to deceitfully cross the border into Greece
[03:56.160 --> 04:03.680]  shows several people speaking Farsi they are Iranian Iran is currently
[04:03.680 --> 04:09.520]  suffering an outbreak of the coronavirus why on earth should Greece allow them in
[04:09.520 --> 04:15.680]  the coronavirus appears to be some type of eugenics bio weapon designed to kill
[04:15.680 --> 04:21.400]  the weak and elderly but one thing is for certain it has already killed the
[04:21.400 --> 04:27.680]  philosophy of globalism and now it will be stressed testing the precarious
[04:27.680 --> 04:35.120]  digital grid that our entire society is based upon for info wars.com this is
[04:35.120 --> 04:37.680]  Greg Rees
[04:37.680 --> 04:55.320]  Info wars tomorrow's news today
[04:58.320 --> 05:03.360]  rich in Alabama rich thanks for calling I mr. Jones appreciate it first thing I
[05:03.360 --> 05:09.680]  love the turbo force I drive truck for a living and it's amazing coffee kind of
[05:09.680 --> 05:13.960]  gives you a little crash there then but that purple force is amazing how is
[05:13.960 --> 05:18.440]  turbo force different than coffee I'll tell you what it's sustainable
[05:18.440 --> 05:23.760]  anywhere from eight ten hours I don't feel the jitters like I do drink and
[05:23.760 --> 05:27.960]  coffee and it's just you know at the end of the day I don't need anything to go
[05:27.960 --> 05:33.520]  to bed off you know knock out them I'm out cold well that's what we went out to
[05:33.520 --> 05:36.920]  a top developer who did want his name on it and I said what would the ultimate
[05:36.920 --> 05:42.160]  long say ten hour energy be is that possible that's good and clean and
[05:42.160 --> 05:44.940]  strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and
[05:44.940 --> 05:48.640]  natural that are time-released and there's more money in it than anybody
[05:48.640 --> 05:53.280]  else puts in their product so that's why turbo force has such a great effect and
[05:53.280 --> 05:57.840]  so I really appreciate you and I'm glad that you like turbo force
[06:04.440 --> 06:09.600]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's
[06:09.600 --> 06:13.880]  gonna happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got
[06:13.880 --> 06:23.640]  one from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[06:30.760 --> 06:37.240]  and that was 12 years ago I gave that speech and now look at what's ended up
[06:37.240 --> 06:41.680]  happening the nationalist patriot movement against the globalist is
[06:41.680 --> 06:46.320]  taking over every major government that has elections the economy worldwide was
[06:46.320 --> 06:53.600]  surging back and then a man-made virus transferred by Barack Hussein Obama five
[06:53.600 --> 06:58.320]  years ago to communist China magically is released China says they have under
[06:58.320 --> 07:03.600]  control Trump wants to be friendly after winning the trade war and agrees with
[07:03.600 --> 07:07.320]  them and the media then as we predicted begins to say that it's all
[07:07.320 --> 07:15.840]  Trump's fault as the virus spirals out of control when you see big tech and you
[07:15.840 --> 07:19.960]  see Hollywood you see the mainstream media you see the EU and you see the
[07:19.960 --> 07:25.160]  authoritarians all together hyping this virus like the end of the world and the
[07:25.160 --> 07:31.480]  responses we've seen with martial law in areas of Europe and Asia we knew this
[07:31.480 --> 07:37.600]  was going to be super big whether the virus itself was ultra deadly or not and
[07:37.600 --> 07:41.760]  I think the jury's still out on that but you look at these different cruise ships
[07:41.760 --> 07:45.360]  where you might have 700 to a thousand to two thousand three thousand passengers
[07:45.360 --> 07:51.080]  with recirculated air and two people die two really old people who are husband
[07:51.080 --> 07:57.720]  and wife who are so synced up a lot of 80 something year old people when their
[07:57.720 --> 08:03.920]  husband or wife dies they die that same week so it's a real balancing situation
[08:03.920 --> 08:08.880]  here to be accurate with this and to not overhype it less we join in with what
[08:08.880 --> 08:12.600]  the globalists are doing but then when they're creating massive hype that is
[08:12.600 --> 08:17.680]  going to create hysteria we have to report on that and say that's coming and
[08:17.680 --> 08:21.400]  so people a month ago six weeks ago they said why are you hyping this why are
[08:21.400 --> 08:26.120]  you helping him I said no they're the ones hyping it this is concerted
[08:26.120 --> 08:34.960]  choreographed between all the globalist factions this is the big enchilada not
[08:34.960 --> 08:38.480]  Russia gay not the impeachment we kept saying what's the new thing and a big
[08:38.480 --> 08:41.720]  and I said probably a bio attack to bring down the economy probably this
[08:41.720 --> 08:48.680]  Wu hand thing six weeks ago and again the Oracle of Austin was accurate but I'm
[08:48.680 --> 08:56.720]  no Oracle you're no Oracle you all saw it as well this is going to be in saying
[08:56.720 --> 09:02.080]  well I had several guest book today I've canceled them this is a time for we the
[09:02.080 --> 09:05.560]  people whether you're in Italy or whether you're in China or whether you're
[09:05.560 --> 09:08.280]  in Australia or whether you're in Mexico or whether you're in the UK or
[09:08.280 --> 09:12.880]  Canada whether you're in the US to have a chance to call in on the broadcast and
[09:12.880 --> 09:19.040]  so let me give the number out we're gonna get a lot of your calls today first
[09:19.040 --> 09:22.920]  time callers longtime callers you agree you disagree we're just gonna go bam
[09:22.920 --> 09:26.720]  bam bam so don't be offended when I go to you quick and move on no matter how
[09:26.720 --> 09:29.880]  good you are have your point and hit it more done eight seven seven seven eight
[09:29.880 --> 09:33.320]  nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven seven eight nine Alex that's
[09:33.320 --> 09:37.160]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine or five one two six four
[09:37.160 --> 09:41.480]  six 1776 if you're an international caller and one 800 numbers don't work
[09:41.480 --> 09:45.440]  some of you just dolly the country access code and five one two six four six
[09:45.440 --> 09:56.960]  1776 this is why all the real Democrat candidates have set it out because they
[09:56.960 --> 10:01.080]  know Trump couldn't be defeated even election fraud at this point but
[10:01.080 --> 10:08.320]  economic warfare could bring civil unrest and drive him from office six weeks
[10:08.320 --> 10:12.000]  ago I'm not gonna go back to six weeks ago five weeks ago four weeks ago three
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.440]  weeks ago two weeks ago a week ago last week last night you've you've all heard
[10:16.440 --> 10:20.920]  it the regular listeners and the callers and the guests we have nailed it
[10:20.920 --> 10:31.600]  spectacularly but it's not too hard to nail it that your wife's cheating on you
[10:31.600 --> 10:36.120]  if you pull up on a day you're supposed to be out of town there's a weird car in
[10:36.120 --> 10:41.200]  the driveway and you go in and the her door is locked and then you look out the
[10:41.200 --> 10:44.360]  window and a guy's putting his pants on the backyard he just jumped out the
[10:44.360 --> 10:52.200]  window and then she opens the door says oh I was sleeping in her face is all
[10:52.200 --> 10:58.160]  flushes she's all sweating I mean you could see this a mile coming it's
[10:58.160 --> 11:06.280]  ridiculous how incredibly obvious this whole thing is in fact this is more
[11:06.280 --> 11:10.080]  obvious than the dudes jumping out your back window putting his britches on this
[11:10.080 --> 11:15.040]  is the door is open you open it he's on top of her and I'm sorry to use an
[11:15.040 --> 11:19.680]  analogy like that but when you're just watching Netflix and seeing and I get
[11:19.680 --> 11:25.480]  some of the public are like zombies when you're paying attention this was red
[11:25.480 --> 11:38.520]  flag level just just unbelievable the scripting the choreography the way that
[11:38.520 --> 11:49.360]  it was all coordinated and man did Mike Adams and myself and the listeners to
[11:49.360 --> 11:55.880]  got it did we not nail it nailed it grand slam royal flush but I only say
[11:55.880 --> 12:03.560]  that because now we're sure a hundred percent what's going on there's no
[12:03.560 --> 12:10.520]  debating what's happening and we better start talking about what's gonna unfold
[12:10.520 --> 12:17.320]  next it's going to be unbelievable because of the hype and the way they're
[12:17.320 --> 12:20.920]  gonna lay the hype out and the way everybody wants to grandstand and be
[12:20.920 --> 12:26.600]  part of the hype I've had newspapers in TV stations call up that normally never
[12:26.600 --> 12:30.560]  want a quote doing you were at CPAC could you have been exposed are you gonna
[12:30.560 --> 12:35.000]  be self-quarantining because two people had it now Ted Cruz has done in this
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.800]  other congressman again everyone's just piling on that's how humans act like
[12:39.800 --> 12:43.680]  lemons you can pull up on YouTube foot real footage of lemons running off a
[12:43.680 --> 12:48.240]  cliff and once one goes off they all just like they all just start jumping off
[12:48.240 --> 12:56.560]  the cliff so wicked flee when none pursue ladies and gentlemen I believe
[12:56.560 --> 13:00.440]  this virus is probably more deadly than the flu it's obviously man-made it's
[13:00.440 --> 13:06.800]  got an HIV delivery system it's highly communicable let's say it kills two
[13:06.800 --> 13:11.360]  percent of people that are infirm and old and maybe half a percent of those
[13:11.360 --> 13:17.320]  aren't hey that's a problem but getting hysterical and locking down
[13:17.320 --> 13:21.800]  civilization and just running off the edge of a cliff like a bunch of crazy
[13:21.800 --> 13:28.440]  lemmings is not a good thing to do we told you get the food to be prepared we
[13:28.440 --> 13:31.360]  told you get your ammo and get ready and I've got a bunch of horrible food
[13:31.360 --> 13:36.960]  everything else but I said to my wife we only got one deep freeze I'll start
[13:36.960 --> 13:44.360]  parking my car in the driveway get order to go buy two more today and just load
[13:44.360 --> 13:47.400]  them with hamburger meat and all other sorts of good stuff to mix in what we
[13:47.400 --> 13:53.680]  got not because of the virus but if they're successful bringing down Trump
[13:53.680 --> 13:57.600]  it's gonna trigger a civil war the globalist don't care China wants us in
[13:57.600 --> 14:04.640]  civil war they remove Trump civil war total breakdown but they want that and
[14:04.640 --> 14:10.480]  then we could be looking at a depression that last years and years and years and
[14:10.480 --> 14:18.200]  in the great depression we had more than half the public right at 90% living in
[14:18.200 --> 14:23.280]  rural areas and most of them were self-sufficient today 10% are rural half
[14:23.280 --> 14:31.720]  of them are self-sufficient so we got 5% self-sufficient versus 50 60 70%
[14:31.720 --> 14:39.040]  do you imagine society it'll look like World War Z when the zombies go over
[14:39.040 --> 14:43.080]  the wall in Jerusalem and they're just running around just slaughtering and
[14:43.080 --> 14:48.880]  eating people that's what people act like after about two weeks of no food and
[14:48.880 --> 14:54.440]  they just in giant mobs actually climb over walls just like zombies and behave
[14:54.440 --> 14:58.080]  just like zombies that's what the Pentagon trains for a zombie killing and
[14:58.080 --> 15:01.280]  people go what's that mean well that's the cover for practicing to mow down
[15:01.280 --> 15:05.880]  mobs of people that say are trying to take over a nuclear power plant and you
[15:05.880 --> 15:10.640]  don't want to mow them down but once they've taken over all the command and
[15:10.640 --> 15:17.600]  controlled it's called Dark Ages it's called the fall of civilization you look
[15:17.600 --> 15:20.920]  at the LA riots you look at any of that the left is totally primed on
[15:20.920 --> 15:27.280]  everything and they this is their moment the left is making their move this is
[15:27.280 --> 15:31.920]  the chai comms and the EU and the UN and Hollywood and they all were scripted
[15:31.920 --> 15:35.200]  together and now they're all scripted blaming America and Trump because they
[15:35.200 --> 15:38.560]  know we don't have a police state in place which is good so they want to
[15:38.560 --> 15:42.200]  then exacerbate that during a crisis saying Trump's not doing enough and
[15:42.200 --> 15:46.320]  creating much fear as they can we'll break down how they're planning to do
[15:46.320 --> 15:50.520]  that and how we stop them together we've already beaten their last three
[15:50.520 --> 15:54.920]  attempts to stop us we're gonna defeat this one but this is the big one tell

[17:20.600 --> 17:24.000]  having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi because of the flooding
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.920]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than
[17:27.920 --> 17:31.200]  move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that
[17:31.200 --> 17:35.560]  might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory so here's

[19:10.640 --> 19:13.880]  of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality and I
[19:13.880 --> 19:17.880]  say that from personal experience because I know that the products that are
[19:17.880 --> 19:22.360]  being offered here I've tried them and I use them every day and that power pack
[19:22.360 --> 19:27.160]  that they have the ampm power pack well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning
[19:27.160 --> 19:31.360]  except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard I just wanted to
[19:31.360 --> 19:34.920]  start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember that beyond
[19:34.920 --> 19:38.520]  the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think
[19:38.520 --> 19:42.440]  about these great events in the world one of the priorities has to be to take
[19:42.440 --> 19:48.400]  care of yourself remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he
[19:48.400 --> 19:52.840]  intends us to use for good purpose for our families and for our communities and
[19:52.840 --> 19:57.680]  right now folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the future
[19:57.680 --> 20:00.080]  of America
[20:00.320 --> 20:05.600]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:05.600 --> 20:18.680]  you didn't think the globalists would just take it lying down do you know my
[20:18.680 --> 20:23.320]  friends if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[20:23.320 --> 20:28.840]  you're listening to Alex Jones they're going to strike back with everything
[20:28.840 --> 20:37.680]  they've done and they are what are the Achilles heels of the globalist operation
[20:37.680 --> 20:44.120]  well there's there many you expose the providence of the virus it's man-made
[20:44.120 --> 20:51.480]  is produced by the US government sold by Obama publicly with a huge debate and
[20:51.480 --> 20:58.760]  controversy five years ago then expose how China was praised for killing people
[20:58.760 --> 21:01.800]  of checkpoints and welding them in their homes when Trump wanted to stop four
[21:01.800 --> 21:05.160]  weeks ago the flights the media said that's bad and sort of the UN and so
[21:05.160 --> 21:10.160]  the Chinese exposed Bill Gates in his background developing and patenting a
[21:10.160 --> 21:14.200]  similar virus and how he announces ship out test kits to everybody to create a
[21:14.200 --> 21:21.840]  total hysteria and you talk about the Democrats and the big takeaway there's a
[21:21.840 --> 21:26.840]  big article on them four words.com or several but it was already trending on
[21:26.840 --> 21:31.640]  Twitter as the top hashtag this morning on every feed
[21:31.640 --> 21:39.120]  stock market crush bear market that was being force-fed they they rig what's up
[21:39.120 --> 21:42.400]  there they admit they do they have an international hearing go Alex Jones and
[21:42.400 --> 21:45.880]  Paul Watson number one well we took that down we rig it down it will only be what
[21:45.880 --> 21:55.600]  we want and so you've got a almost 3,000 point plunge and it's been gyrating back
[21:55.600 --> 22:02.040]  and forth all day long depending on the different indices you look at
[22:02.040 --> 22:09.120]  S&P Dow Jones, EK so
[22:12.000 --> 22:18.760]  whether the virus is super deadly or not we know the hype is contrived the
[22:18.760 --> 22:24.040]  coordination is synthetic and this is an attack on America and anybody that
[22:24.040 --> 22:30.280]  blames Trump or anybody that blames the first responders or anybody that blames
[22:30.280 --> 22:35.920]  frontline medical workers is working with the globalist the chai comms to
[22:35.920 --> 22:41.400]  create a collapse of confidence in the dollar and in our country and this is
[22:41.400 --> 22:49.920]  modern warfare America is under military economic biological attack right now
[22:49.920 --> 22:56.040]  you know I've had a lot of anxiety the last few years I've been really upset
[22:56.040 --> 23:01.880]  and everybody knows it's shown on air I have no anxiety now it's all confirmed
[23:01.880 --> 23:06.680]  we're in a total war nothing's gonna be the same after this you won't recognize
[23:06.680 --> 23:12.280]  China and the United States in a year and we're going to dictate what that
[23:12.280 --> 23:18.400]  transformation is gonna look like America incredibly empowered like after
[23:18.400 --> 23:26.080]  World War two or America as a race-warring divided bankrupt nation of
[23:26.080 --> 23:31.160]  victims and cowards ruled over by Hollywood and the global social
[23:31.160 --> 23:38.000]  engineers and our debtors the communist Chinese so this is 21st century warfare
[23:38.000 --> 23:44.200]  and everybody out there better decide which damn side you're on
[23:44.200 --> 23:50.760]  oh yeah China sending special teams to Europe and Africa and an offering help
[23:50.760 --> 23:56.120]  here because they're the heroes with Xi Jinping that first fought it and did
[23:56.120 --> 23:59.720]  everything and the media is all scripting that and Trump's bad it's their
[23:59.720 --> 24:04.960]  virus it comes from them it's man-made and our media I've got stacks of
[24:04.960 --> 24:09.200]  headlines here that Xi Jinping's a hero remember the Washington Post is four
[24:09.200 --> 24:18.960]  months ago G.G. Ping must quote destroy Trump
[24:19.600 --> 24:26.440]  annihilate Trump what was that headline Washington Post headline let's pull up
[24:26.440 --> 24:35.360]  G.G. Ping must destroy Trump to save America and now it's scripted again by
[24:35.360 --> 24:38.680]  the folks that own our debt that own Hollywood the chai comms run by the
[24:38.680 --> 24:47.080]  globalist they're just their puppets oh yet again we need to thank the chai comms
[24:47.080 --> 24:56.240]  for saving us and it's our evil president that's to blame because six
[24:56.240 --> 24:59.040]  weeks ago they're like oh we're locking folks up and killing people at
[24:59.040 --> 25:02.800]  checkpoints but it's contained and it's no big deal and Trump goes okay yeah I
[25:02.800 --> 25:07.360]  don't kill the market I agree China's doing a great job and as soon as he did
[25:07.360 --> 25:11.120]  that it's all Trump's fault
[25:11.960 --> 25:22.920]  there it is G's choice destroy Trump or save him and weaken America that's how
[25:22.920 --> 25:31.480]  sick these freakazoids are and there are people marching in Germany and
[25:31.480 --> 25:36.360]  Sweden and Denmark and Spain I have the articles and videos are today young

[33:50.000 --> 33:54.720]  people have reached next criminal level I'm not gonna play it all for you you've
[33:54.720 --> 34:01.760]  heard it my god it's it's it played it like 10 times last week you know it and
[34:01.760 --> 34:10.280]  now they are celebrating mainline CNN ABC news going yeah Trump played this down
[34:10.280 --> 34:13.480]  weeks ago because the chai comms were but they know you don't remember that
[34:13.480 --> 34:21.600]  they think you don't and so now it's his fault it's all Trump's fault they're
[34:21.600 --> 34:25.120]  gonna try to suspend the election using this and again yeah okay maybe the
[34:25.120 --> 34:30.320]  virus kills half a percent of people that's like a revolver that has a
[34:30.320 --> 34:35.640]  hundred bullets in it and or a revolver that has a hundred cylinders in it and
[34:35.640 --> 34:40.960]  only five bullets I mean it's it's it's it's even half a percent it's even less
[34:40.960 --> 34:47.000]  than that it's like a revolver that you drive down the highway it's dangerous and
[34:47.000 --> 34:51.120]  I'm not saying don't get prepared for the virus we knew though they were hyping
[34:51.120 --> 35:02.560]  this for maximum hysteria day one shedding the precedent this is the big
[35:02.560 --> 35:07.680]  one folks and I've got to wonder if they don't get Trump out using this what
[35:07.680 --> 35:18.280]  comes next after that so regardless of how deadly the virus really is I'll tell
[35:18.280 --> 35:21.120]  you next hour I really think it's going on and I'll give you a prelude to it
[35:21.120 --> 35:30.800]  now dr. Pachennick's right it's been in the United States for a long time and
[35:30.800 --> 35:36.000]  they're gonna find that they held back the test kits one of you not create a
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.960]  panic and then now the test kits are all going out as we said weeks ago there'll
[35:40.960 --> 35:45.600]  be a lot of people that have it and then that's gonna set in the giant panic
[35:45.600 --> 35:51.760]  even though it's harmless to most people or just gives you a respiratory cold now
[35:51.760 --> 35:57.960]  it does mutate it does other things later but notice HIV used to kill all
[35:57.960 --> 36:03.360]  these people and then suddenly it wasn't killing people anymore and suddenly
[36:03.360 --> 36:07.200]  magic Johnson didn't have it suddenly all these other folks cure themselves with
[36:07.200 --> 36:12.000]  herbs and things and it's because they have to keep putting the vaccines out
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.880]  with the HIV original strain and he having outbreaks for the original strain
[36:16.880 --> 36:21.880]  from the 1970s and 80s and they go it's funny it mutates it becomes harmless but
[36:21.880 --> 36:25.880]  the old strain keeps showing up because they're injecting it with into you and
[36:25.880 --> 36:29.000]  they don't want something that really goes on forever they want to kill who
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  they're injecting with it and then it mutates it becomes less deadly and then
[36:33.000 --> 36:39.200]  harmless and so you test positive for HIV but most of you have a strain of it
[36:39.200 --> 36:43.800]  that doesn't hurt you but the AZT and everything does kill you and that's why
[36:43.800 --> 36:47.600]  they're saying oh treat this with these drugs again so a big pharma makes
[36:47.600 --> 36:55.480]  hundreds of billions of dollars we're so ahead of the curve on this it's just
[36:55.480 --> 37:01.640]  mind-blowing I haven't even plugged this hour because the news that got brought
[37:01.640 --> 37:05.600]  my attention last week and I got so busy I didn't cover it is so incredible and
[37:05.600 --> 37:12.560]  then this morning I was reading news and I saw this and ran over to my crew and
[37:12.560 --> 37:17.680]  ran over to our researchers and developers and I said wow you tried to
[37:17.680 --> 37:23.600]  tell me last week I didn't realize that the main group about to get FDA
[37:23.600 --> 37:31.240]  approval for documented over-the-counter coronavirus response and that Australia's
[37:31.240 --> 37:44.040]  looking at approving is using raw iodine it's not even atomic in a nasal nebulizer
[37:44.040 --> 37:48.640]  you spray into your nostrils I'm gonna get to that and of course we're way
[37:48.640 --> 37:52.560]  ahead of that curve I was wondering why why are our iodine cells like quadruple
[37:52.560 --> 37:55.880]  right now why are we gonna sell out of X2 and X3 well people went out to their
[37:55.880 --> 38:00.360]  own research and I again so far ahead of the curve that then I get behind the
[38:00.360 --> 38:03.840]  curve it's like you know you're like lapping them so much later you're not
[38:03.840 --> 38:09.320]  even it's like she's got like oh you know those innovations yet years ago eight
[38:09.320 --> 38:13.640]  years ago oh well those are now being picked up I'm just like hey it's well
[38:13.640 --> 38:17.080]  known antiviral it's really good for you boost your whole immune system get you
[38:17.080 --> 38:21.080]  know get iodine X2 X3 and then it's like all over the news that these big
[38:21.080 --> 38:27.080]  pharma companies are about to roll out their own nasal iodine systems well
[38:27.080 --> 38:30.080]  this stuff's strong you don't take this and shoot up your nose but you can do
[38:30.080 --> 38:32.680]  whatever you want with the neti pot or whatever but it's just funny because
[38:32.680 --> 38:39.280]  last week I'm telling my wife just neti pot with X2 or X3 and I'm showing her
[38:39.280 --> 38:44.480]  the research studies and like I'm so unopportunistic that I'm not even on air
[38:44.480 --> 38:47.600]  saying that though I'm doing it for my own self that's the same thing that happened
[38:47.600 --> 38:53.360]  with horrible food six weeks ago I said to my wife hey here's the number to their
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.320]  main manager we get a 20% discount they can't do that much because it's not
[38:57.320 --> 39:00.640]  it's only marked up like a hundred percent most foods marked up like ten
[39:00.640 --> 39:03.960]  times there's so much you know bureaucracy and things involved I said
[39:03.960 --> 39:06.600]  you know call up this is the guy just make sure you get it get a lot of it get
[39:06.600 --> 39:10.800]  another your supply for four people five people she's like really we already got
[39:10.800 --> 39:14.680]  so much I said just just just just get more and then I'm sitting there a couple
[39:14.680 --> 39:19.480]  days later and go wait a minute I should be plugging horrible food if I'm if I'm
[39:19.480 --> 39:26.400]  that's just really all I do on air is what I do it's totally unscripted it's
[39:26.400 --> 39:30.520]  like what I do it's what I use is what I like it's what I experience what callers
[39:30.520 --> 39:34.960]  recommend it's what guests you know it's all real human experience not some big
[39:34.960 --> 39:38.520]  globalist thing tells you what to say that I do it but then sometimes I'm so
[39:38.520 --> 39:43.160]  far ahead I'm way behind does that make sense because I'm buying horrible food
[39:43.160 --> 39:47.120]  the week before I start promoting it even though I'm always selling it and I'm
[39:47.120 --> 39:51.800]  saying honey put on your nighttime nebulizer and put it in the baby's room
[39:51.800 --> 39:57.600]  and I'm sitting there literally with nebulizers at the kitchen table you know
[39:57.600 --> 40:05.600]  in the morning and I'm not selling it to you see that it's a again when you're
[40:05.600 --> 40:09.360]  so far ahead you're way behind I know that sounds like a paradox that's very
[40:09.360 --> 40:14.680]  zen them so far ahead we're way behind because you know you say something 10
[40:14.680 --> 40:19.040]  years ago 20 years ago and now it's just everywhere and you're like oh wait I was
[40:19.040 --> 40:22.760]  right about that I better talk about that now but see it's not rocket science
[40:22.760 --> 40:26.680]  the UN says look it up there's almost three billion people with mental
[40:26.680 --> 40:33.520]  disabilities or lower faculties because of iodine deficiency and I harp the
[40:33.520 --> 40:39.040]  living hell out of that and like no one cares but oh it can knock out viruses
[40:39.040 --> 40:45.800]  when it gets contact with them see I'm on a chemist but I've had chemists on
[40:45.800 --> 40:49.760]  the side of it mercury is highly electrochemical and the most probably the
[40:49.760 --> 40:55.040]  most toxic thing the nerves other than like cyanide but see iodine's good for
[40:55.040 --> 41:00.120]  nerves but bad for other things I don't know how it works how it's like good for
[41:00.120 --> 41:04.520]  your nerves but it comes along a virus it's like a thunder like a little you
[41:04.520 --> 41:09.840]  ever seen an oak tree hit by lightning bolt I mean it like I mean it is like
[41:09.840 --> 41:17.880]  super deadly to viruses it's like silver at low levels is good for us overall
[41:17.880 --> 41:24.520]  and ourselves but to bacteria and viruses it's like a shotgun blast because
[41:24.520 --> 41:28.280]  it just goes right into how they're set up but that's all the things God gave us
[41:28.280 --> 41:31.160]  show I'm gonna go to break it back with the calls I'm gonna stop ranting I didn't
[41:31.160 --> 41:36.960]  even get to these quotes I said I would it's just insane but the crew is like we
[41:36.960 --> 41:40.480]  keep telling you for weeks iodine look at these studies that they're the big
[41:40.480 --> 41:44.520]  farmers of patenting it right now you need to get on this and I'm like this
[41:44.520 --> 41:47.680]  because like I've been so much promoting it I'm just kind of sick of talking
[41:47.680 --> 41:52.960]  about it it's like telling me after you play 18 holes of golf for the big old
[41:52.960 --> 41:57.560]  glass eliminates lishes I mean it's kind of like been there done that we just need
[41:57.560 --> 42:02.240]  to understand ladies and gentlemen that we're not in Kansas anymore this is
[42:02.240 --> 42:07.160]  their big attack and yes we need to personally take care of ourselves and
[42:07.160 --> 42:11.800]  while I'm up here preaching take your PQQ and your CoQ 10 DNA force and you
[42:11.800 --> 42:18.040]  know brush your teeth with your patented nanotech approved bio silver with

[42:21.680 --> 42:29.080]  coronavirus family we've got that too that I then have to do it I have to do
[42:29.080 --> 42:33.160]  it a couple days ago I'm like I don't have any super blue silver I don't have
[42:33.160 --> 42:36.240]  a toothpaste why why'd you buy this toothpaste I think she goes well it's
[42:36.240 --> 42:39.600]  fluoride free but you didn't bring it home like put it on auto ship so I just
[42:39.600 --> 42:43.320]  came here yesterday I was up here on Saturday two days ago and I just took

[42:50.280 --> 42:53.680]  come back directly with your calls and throughout the next three four hours in
[42:53.680 --> 43:00.040]  four hours on tomorrow's news thing it's wonderful that so many people are now
[43:00.040 --> 43:04.520]  thinking about preparedness and that we're seeing record food sales not just
[43:04.520 --> 43:09.160]  here but across the world that's good people need to be self-sufficient the

[44:08.040 --> 44:12.520]  super deadly or not the issue is it's being used by the globalist as a weapon
[44:12.520 --> 44:16.800]  against the world economy and against nation-states and against the populist

[46:59.600 --> 47:16.600]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:16.600 --> 47:25.240]  the answer to 1984 tyranny is 1776 all right we're gonna go to Chris and Chase
[47:25.240 --> 47:31.480]  and Heath and Joe and Cornell and Joe and Jack and Patrick and fish and Jason
[47:31.480 --> 47:35.640]  and many others starting here in just a few minutes let's do instead of doing that
[47:35.640 --> 47:41.560]  long babbling right now I did earlier let me just say this more important
[47:41.560 --> 47:45.600]  and storeable food is getting right with God more important and storeable food is
[47:45.600 --> 47:49.880]  telling your friends and family what's really going on this is a giant military
[47:49.880 --> 47:54.040]  globalist attack on our economy we just want a major trade war globalism was
[47:54.040 --> 47:59.480]  just defeated if we can stop this attack we just defeated them economically this
[47:59.480 --> 48:05.160]  is a military attack the left is praising the stock market plunging hoping
[48:05.160 --> 48:09.400]  it brings down America they're rooting against not just the country but your own
[48:09.400 --> 48:16.320]  financial futures it's outrageous that they ever recover from this but instead
[48:16.320 --> 48:22.760]  they smell the blood of the hysteria and they want to press it and so the CDC
[48:22.760 --> 48:29.120]  held back the testing kits so that then they're sent out at the perfect time
[48:29.120 --> 48:33.400]  because they're covering up the fact of the death rate in that high that's my
[48:33.400 --> 48:42.360]  view still deadly but you know and then finally there's a flood of test kits
[48:42.360 --> 48:46.840]  put out by Bill Gates the guy that did the drill four months ago about
[48:46.840 --> 48:53.320]  martial law and 10 plus million dead 15 million dead and now he's got test kits
[48:53.320 --> 49:02.040]  oh he's got him he's totally running the whole black op operation and he's got
[49:02.040 --> 49:05.920]  the patented vaccine he's got it already hope they're gonna make you beg for it
[49:05.920 --> 49:09.880]  first and then they cherry pick the people that go to the hospital are already
[49:09.880 --> 49:14.160]  the sickest the pre-existing conditions they hype up the death and that it's
[49:14.160 --> 49:17.760]  all Trump's fault for going along with China trying to save the world economy
[49:17.760 --> 49:22.520]  and saying it's not a big deal the setup is there we were a hundred print one in
[49:22.520 --> 49:27.240]  fact I don't I'm on a power trip about this I'm freaked out I could not believe
[49:27.240 --> 49:35.160]  that info wars has been 100% right it is unbelievable and there's that big
[49:35.160 --> 49:42.240]  Reuters poll out Saturday headline Democrats from the public and split along
[49:42.240 --> 49:46.840]  party lines concerning their views of the virus Republicans think it's no big
[49:46.840 --> 49:50.920]  deal just Trump said so Democrats think it's the end of the world because they
[49:50.920 --> 49:53.960]  know they want to use it to bring down America that's two separate things
[49:53.960 --> 49:58.160]  whether the virus is super aggressive or not we know it spreads easily we know
[49:58.160 --> 50:01.720]  it's man-made we should be concerned it does kill some people juries out on how
[50:01.720 --> 50:05.240]  bad it is you got these princess cruise lines and all these other cruises and
[50:05.240 --> 50:08.960]  you got thousands of people on a ship and only two die doesn't look too deadly
[50:08.960 --> 50:14.480]  to me man I don't want to just get up or go into the world into the world by my
[50:14.480 --> 50:19.960]  products and then the whole country goes down you need these products anyway
[50:19.960 --> 50:22.880]  because they protect you and your family and there's stuff going on all the time
[50:22.880 --> 50:26.400]  and when a real pandemic is going on folks they don't tell you I've had my
[50:26.400 --> 50:34.360]  family wiped out by it and I've had doctors tell me this is a cover-up when
[50:34.360 --> 50:37.360]  the real enemy comes folks you're not gonna hear a damn thing that's what I've
[50:37.360 --> 50:43.960]  learned so again the hype the unification the choreography the the the
[50:43.960 --> 50:48.320]  the the the sinking of all this it's synthetic and the virus itself is
[50:48.320 --> 50:54.840]  synthetic I keep hyping that because the hype is hysteria run for the hills no
[50:54.840 --> 50:59.720]  I'm hyping the fact that it's hype people go away that you just said better get
[50:59.720 --> 51:03.320]  stocked up a great because all hell's gonna break loose because this is the
[51:03.320 --> 51:13.120]  big globalist move we know it's a crash of the economy we know it's race riots
[51:13.120 --> 51:18.400]  they're trying to prepare we know it's the takedown it's America under attack if
[51:18.400 --> 51:21.880]  the virus kills half a percent or two percent that's a diversion from the
[51:21.880 --> 51:29.640]  fact that the enemy released it you don't blame your country if you get
[51:29.640 --> 51:33.480]  attacked you blame who did the attacking so don't let the enemy that's
[51:33.480 --> 51:37.480]  launched the attack sit there and pretend like their little angel cakes
[51:37.480 --> 51:42.480]  with the whole media working for him anybody siding with the globalist right
[51:42.480 --> 51:47.560]  now anybody siding against America and hyping that they want to crash the
[51:47.560 --> 51:51.960]  economy and overthrow the president is an open enemy of you and your family
[51:51.960 --> 51:57.840]  period it's unbelievable in no other culture in society with anyone act like
[51:57.840 --> 52:02.120]  this I guarantee in Mexico if people were like going oh we hope this crashes
[52:02.120 --> 52:06.240]  the economy to get rid of a president people would unify behind that president
[52:06.240 --> 52:12.280]  because they understand you're betting against our country screw you you tried
[52:12.280 --> 52:15.600]  that in China no one would put up with that no one put up with that anywhere but
[52:15.600 --> 52:19.760]  America has been taught to hate itself so much that they're actually trying to
[52:19.760 --> 52:25.280]  make this dog hunt well we're supposed to be off the air while this crap goes
[52:25.280 --> 52:28.880]  down but you know what we're on the air and you're boosting us and I hate to
[52:28.880 --> 52:34.040]  tell the enemy this because I like to fly to the radar but record tens of
[52:34.040 --> 52:37.680]  millions a day now new people coming in listening and watching because of you
[52:37.680 --> 52:41.000]  telling friends family neighbors spread the word keep it up you're beautiful
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.120]  calling it talk radio calling the c-span get on live whatever just spread the
[52:45.120 --> 52:48.360]  word about news wars calm the forbidden transmission because we're here in
[52:48.360 --> 52:52.240]  defiance of their plan and I believe that we will defeat the globalist if we
[52:52.240 --> 52:56.880]  get on our knees and ask God for providence and repent and ask God to
[52:56.880 --> 53:03.480]  protect the Republic now but we have to get active and aggressive that's what
[53:03.480 --> 53:12.240]  God wants to see one hell of a time to be alive ladies and gentlemen you are
[53:12.240 --> 53:17.760]  witnessing an attack bigger than World War two let me tell you something the
[53:17.760 --> 53:22.200]  globalist thought Americans were lazy they funded Hitler it was all a big set
[53:22.200 --> 53:25.840]  up that's all come out didn't go the way they thought it would go they thought
[53:25.840 --> 53:28.800]  we were lazy is gonna lay around because Americans like to have fun the
[53:28.800 --> 53:32.160]  Japanese and the Germans come over here and spy on us their intelligence
[53:32.160 --> 53:35.520]  haters they're just out drinking beer and dancing and they're a bunch of farmers
[53:35.520 --> 53:40.640]  these guys aren't a problem until they started the fight as long as we know who
[53:40.640 --> 53:53.080]  the enemy is we will beat them but we have to know who the enemy is it's like
[53:53.080 --> 53:55.800]  the German Nazis looked at the Russians and thought they're a bunch of half
[53:55.800 --> 53:59.560]  starving farmers that hate the communists we'll just roll in there and win but as
[53:59.560 --> 54:03.480]  soon as they rolled in the people reading them as liberators but as soon as
[54:03.480 --> 54:06.760]  they started taking their property or raping their wives they all unified
[54:06.760 --> 54:11.720]  like a swarm of bees and kicked the Nazis asses with brute force ladies and
[54:11.720 --> 54:17.640]  gentlemen the globalist cannot win when we have the will they don't have a hope
[54:17.640 --> 54:24.360]  in hell the chai comms release this they're blaming our president Hillary's
[54:24.360 --> 54:29.080]  all over TV blaming Trump saying remove him
[54:30.600 --> 54:35.880]  you choose what side you're on right now but let me tell you something I got a
[54:35.880 --> 54:39.560]  photo Hillary Clinton where's my phone it I'll find it I'll show it next
[54:39.560 --> 54:42.920]  segment I heard back when she was in college in this anointed communist and
[54:42.920 --> 54:47.040]  time-life books had her on the cover of one of the pages saying she'll be your
[54:47.040 --> 54:51.240]  president someday and you look at this demon who they chose and that she will
[54:51.240 --> 54:57.240]  never succeed they're going to lose the question is how bad is this gonna be
[54:57.240 --> 54:59.760]  here are the quotes and I'll go to break and I promise go to your calls I'm
[54:59.760 --> 55:04.960]  just out of control which is Marcus Cicero Roman philosopher and member of
[55:04.960 --> 55:10.880]  the Senate in the time of Julius Caesar a nation can survive its fools and even
[55:10.880 --> 55:15.360]  the ambitious but it cannot survive treason from within an enemy at the
[55:15.360 --> 55:20.640]  gates is less formidable for he is known and carries his banner openly but the
[55:20.640 --> 55:25.240]  trader moves amongst those within the gate freely his fly whispers rustling
[55:25.240 --> 55:29.280]  through all the alleys heard in the very halls of government itself but the
[55:29.280 --> 55:33.400]  trader appears on a trader he speaks in accents familiar to his victims and he
[55:33.400 --> 55:37.960]  wears their face and their arguments he appeals to their baseness that lies
[55:37.960 --> 55:41.640]  deep in their hearts of all men he rocks the soul of a nation he works
[55:41.640 --> 55:45.040]  secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city he
[55:45.040 --> 55:50.240]  infects the body politics so that it can no longer resist a murderer is less to
[55:50.240 --> 55:56.360]  fear the trader is the plug and it's those of us that are the men and women in
[55:56.360 --> 56:00.520]  the arena that will stand against the traders now in the information war it's
[56:00.520 --> 56:04.360]  a Chinese bio weapon with the left publicly to bring down the economy
[56:04.360 --> 56:09.200]  they're celebrating it right now if we just get the word out they're done just
[56:09.200 --> 56:12.640]  like everything else they've tried we've got to get that out I don't see that
[56:12.640 --> 56:16.480]  talking point from Trump I don't see that from any of his people I just see
[56:16.480 --> 56:20.280]  them flat-footed because there's an internal setup going on but don't worry
[56:20.280 --> 56:26.440]  we fired the bat signal now what did Roosevelt say it is not the critic who
[56:26.440 --> 56:30.480]  counts not the man who points out of the strongman stumbles or where the doer of
[56:30.480 --> 56:34.280]  deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who was
[56:34.280 --> 56:38.040]  actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who
[56:38.040 --> 56:42.920]  strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is
[56:42.920 --> 56:48.040]  no effort without air and shortcoming but who actually strived to do the deeds
[56:48.040 --> 56:52.640]  who knows the great enthusiasm the great devotions who spends himself in a
[56:52.640 --> 56:56.640]  worthy cause who at least knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and
[56:56.640 --> 57:01.920]  who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his
[57:01.920 --> 57:07.520]  place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor
[57:07.520 --> 57:14.400]  defeat pure truth ladies and gentlemen it's the journey not the destination it's
[57:14.400 --> 57:19.360]  the test on this planet the end of people ask how I'm doing under attack I've
[57:19.360 --> 57:24.320]  never been stronger the enemy teaches you that if there's any pressure he that
[57:24.320 --> 57:29.360]  it's the end of your life but look at the wind you if the trees and the grass
[57:29.360 --> 57:33.880]  don't have wind they die in studies you need the wind you need the storms you
[57:33.880 --> 57:38.520]  need it all you need the fights because that which does not kill you as Nietzsche
[57:38.520 --> 57:44.920]  said only makes you stronger your calls all the news and America's greatest test
[57:44.920 --> 57:50.560]  straight ahead everybody's calling me I'm getting constant streams of text
[57:50.560 --> 57:54.720]  messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying is coronavirus

[58:04.720 --> 58:07.720]  because they got a package they got the food but I would encourage listeners to

[59:45.760 --> 59:50.080]  turbo force Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good
[59:50.080 --> 1:00:17.640]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:49.080]  you want to go to war but that's the way it
[1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:58.440]  always is. I can taste the globalist hate, but I don't do this for hate of them. I do
[1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:02.640]  it for love of my children. You know, I was never that strong, but I could bench press
[1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:11.600]  400 pounds. I could just squat 600, 650, 700, and I could not do it thinking about people
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:15.960]  I hated because a lot of weightlifters do it hating people. I could always do it when
[1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:22.120]  I thought about people I loved. And I have to remind myself we don't do this for hate.
[1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:28.200]  We do this for love. And that's the key. Alright, I'm going to go to your phone calls now,
[1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:32.960]  and I'm late going to them, so bottom of the hour, I'll get into all the news. But there's
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:36.880]  no doubt our country's under globalist assault. It's totally engineer. We were, we were dead
[1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:42.840]  on about everything. And I just can't believe there's this many Americans that hate the
[1:01:42.840 --> 1:01:45.760]  country and are just all over the news, all over everywhere. I might even know what you
[1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:49.200]  see it everywhere. I'm not going to wait. The articles are on him for praising the collapse
[1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:56.960]  of the economy, saying Trump did this. I'm just involuntarily going to tear my eye because
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:06.600]  I'm disgusted by this. That this is so obvious and so easy to defeat. And I can see the president.
[1:02:06.600 --> 1:02:10.480]  He looks like hell. And the last picked up on it was all over Twitter without me even
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:13.960]  looking. I just saw. Oh, look, he looks like crap. You know, he looks. Yeah, man, because
[1:02:13.960 --> 1:02:20.360]  he really wants to win. He's pissed, man. And Trump cannot believe there's so much scum
[1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:26.360]  in this country. And I don't say that to hate my country, but our country has put up with
[1:02:26.360 --> 1:02:32.760]  scum too long. These leftists come up to me. They don't do it anymore and tell me a bunch
[1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:36.080]  of crap. I get right back in their face. And now the words out that I don't roll over to
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:40.440]  their crap and they want to throw a punch. Well, then they're going to get knocked up
[1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:47.760]  side of their head hard. They probably got it. And they guess what? Now they don't sit
[1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:52.080]  there and run their fat mouths to me in public. I see him looking nice. Look at him. That's
[1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:59.360]  right. Because I'm not one that's taking it rolling over. Christ was on a mission to
[1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:03.600]  be crucified and die for our sins. And he wasn't going to let anything get in the way
[1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:10.800]  of that when he turned his cheek. The last thing he said was to his disciples is buy
[1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:24.600]  weapons. Because the next time I'm coming back with fire. So you think about that. And
[1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:28.040]  the biggest thing these lion churches have taught is thou shall not kill. That's not
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:33.280]  what it says in Greek or Hebrew or anywhere else. It says thou shall not murder. Murder
[1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:38.120]  is killing an innocent person. The Bible's full Old Testament New Testament. Somebody
[1:03:38.120 --> 1:03:44.560]  comes to your house at night to hurt you. Rise up and kill them. Pull up the quotes.
[1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:57.040]  Bible verses rise up and kill them. Of course. I was a short segment. We're going to break
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:02.600]  for a minute. I swear I'm going to your calls. Oh, the energy level was just off the charts.
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:09.560]  I mean. Twenty six years on air with you and all of this fight and it's all just coming
[1:04:09.560 --> 1:04:17.600]  to a head right now. God, I'm not. I just can't believe. I cannot believe there are
[1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:26.760]  this many people that want to be globalist slaves and throw the best part of America
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:33.560]  in our vision and our destiny to train. You know, we just got to get over it. I'll tell
[1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:41.920]  you this. Once we take the country back through sheer force of will and through sheer force
[1:04:41.920 --> 1:04:50.720]  of oratory skill and by sheer shunning leftist, we are going to defeat them. Not through intimidation
[1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:58.160]  or bullying, but just by telling them you don't talk to me, you trash. I always promote
[1:04:58.160 --> 1:05:04.680]  DNA Force Plus with PQQ and CoQ 10 that cleans out the cells and empowers the telomeres and

[1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:50.400]  You don't control that. God controls the angel of death and God controls life and death.
[1:06:50.400 --> 1:06:59.000]  Not your pathetic God Satan. She's got the looks. You see the brim reaper. You're dead

[1:07:10.760 --> 1:07:15.520]  You believe me. You believe me. She's a number 13. She's a number 13. When the clock strikes
[1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:25.440]  midnight. She's gonna turn on the juice boy. She's gonna turn on the juice boy. Then she'll
[1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:31.600]  turn on the power. She's gonna turn on the power. You loveless don't have the power because
[1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:37.120]  you don't bow to God and you don't recognize it and take the connection. You create facsimiles
[1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:48.120]  of it. It's why you try to make us weak because you don't have the looks that kill. You fear
[1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:56.760]  death. You know, that's the Christian song, isn't it? All right, let's go ahead and go
[1:07:56.760 --> 1:08:08.760]  phone calls here. All hell is breaking loose. Here we go. Going to your calls. Let's go
[1:08:08.760 --> 1:08:13.280]  to Joe in New Jersey as they try to plunge the stock market as they blame President Trump.
[1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:17.200]  All of it predicted. All of it choreographed. All of it scripted. How do we counter it?
[1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:19.200]  What do you think is coming next? Thanks for holding.
[1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:23.880]  Hey Alex, thanks for the call. I appreciate it. Multi-time caller. I think it's important
[1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:28.800]  for them to get ahead of this immediately. I think one way to do this is we know when
[1:08:28.800 --> 1:08:32.600]  they release those testing kits, that number in New York or anywhere, any big city, is
[1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:37.600]  going to go from 100s to thousands or tens of thousands, say like New York. He needs
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:41.800]  to come out and say to the American public, when these tests come out, there will be a
[1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:46.600]  large rise because they haven't been tested. And what he can do with the overflow of the
[1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:51.400]  hospitals because it will happen is take several government buildings and start outfitting
[1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:55.840]  them as in small and firmly to help other people. So they're not saying, hey, listen,
[1:08:55.840 --> 1:08:59.080]  we're on this. You can't help us. Well, exactly. Trump wanted to go along
[1:08:59.080 --> 1:09:03.040]  with China. That was a setup to say it's not a big deal to save markets. Now we know they
[1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:06.800]  set them up. We now know that White House internally debated all this when the listeners
[1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:12.080]  and other people warned them. And we don't need that. We need the virtue signal to stop
[1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:18.640]  the panic. And so Trump's not a virtue signal. I get it. This is the time to create the calm.
[1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:22.880]  And I don't think it's too late for him yet, but they've already now shifted to scripting
[1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:27.840]  that it's all his fault. Yes. And by getting ahead of the saying, listen,
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:33.080]  we're saying it could be good if it's going to get worse. Here's what we can do to mitigate
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:38.640]  any situation saying we can't help you guys in a hospital. Because you know as soon as
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:41.760]  it happens and that hits, you're going to have thousands of people watch the hospital
[1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:44.280]  saying, oh, it's not helping us. It's all Trump's fault.
[1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:48.840]  Oh, yeah. Because the media is already telling them to act like that. And again, most people
[1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:51.840]  aren't even going to get sick from this virus. We're not saying it doesn't kill people, but
[1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:56.800]  vast majority don't even get sick. And so again, but it creates a huge hysteria at the
[1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:00.520]  hospitals and they've got to lock down who it is and use extra staff. And that can then
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:06.000]  bankrupt the system. And that's what the actuaries and analyses show.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:10.400]  And I think a number two point is which is huge, huge to this whole situation with the
[1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:18.000]  United States. Exactly. We were trying to build it up. China's exercising its power
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.240]  over supply side over the supply chain on just on time delivery. They're using their last
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:28.360]  weapon at the end. They waited to capitulate to Trump and then like the scum they are launched
[1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:33.680]  their sneak attack. But we can start building this out. There are people in America who
[1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:39.480]  create American products. There need to be a universal site where we can go and say,
[1:10:39.480 --> 1:10:44.400]  hey, I need this and I need that. And go to that site and work with people who want to
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:49.160]  hire American workers who are, you know, make American products. It may be more, but that
[1:10:49.160 --> 1:10:53.480]  may be the only chance to eat from from mass to pharmaceuticals to anything. The shirts
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:57.880]  the pants. We can produce it here. We just need that infrastructure to start being built
[1:10:57.880 --> 1:11:03.520]  now. Damn right. And we need Trump to get ahead of it with a plan. Not just saying, we told
[1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:07.640]  him six weeks ago, everything's fine. It's wonderful. So China's market plunged. But
[1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:11.880]  as soon as it came here, that would do that to us. He had to get ahead of it so that people
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:16.760]  could prepare for the worst. And I'm not saying Trump did a bad job. He was advised badly.
[1:11:16.760 --> 1:11:20.440]  And we've had top experts on laying that out. It's just, let me be Joe, I'm not trying to
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:24.760]  to toot our horn of the collars, but it has info or has not been dead on on this. Dead
[1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:29.880]  on 100%. In fact, I know people that thought I was nuts. And I was telling exactly what's
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:34.280]  happened. Now people are coming to say, Hey, listen, this is actually happening. But yeah,
[1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:38.360]  it's happening. And it's going to get worse. And not to panic people, but it is because
[1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:42.200]  the numbers are low right now. And when they raise that's where the panic and one more thing,
[1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:46.600]  when this happened, this is this is this is a test of the stock market, like we said, right?
[1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:50.920]  The stock market start three, four thousand points, whatever it's done. This is just a small
[1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:55.000]  test because when these numbers come out, there's a prepping for this market.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:58.920]  Oh, you're absolutely right. They're probing. They're testing. They're realigning their
[1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:02.520]  propaganda. Thanks for the call. And again, I'm saying for the 50th time today, because it's so
[1:12:02.520 --> 1:12:09.400]  key, the scripting and the unified choreography of the propaganda tells you this thing is a
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:15.960]  synthetic attack. It's organized. It's false. It's an enemy attack period. And now the president
[1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:20.840]  knows everybody knows and the knives have come out in the corporate media and the left going,
[1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:27.720]  it's your fault down in America. I mean, I got up this morning at 530. And I go in and get coffee.
[1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:33.160]  I'm getting ready to cook breakfast at like 630 for my kids getting up. And Mike Adams is he says,
[1:12:33.160 --> 1:12:37.560]  this is the day that the panic begins. This is the day the market crashes. He's a smart guy.
[1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:43.640]  So I start going and looking and I call my cup and I go, you know, like 645, I waited and he goes,
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:46.840]  he goes, I've been up. Don't worry about it. I said, well, obviously you're texting me, you know,
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:51.240]  six in the morning. He goes, well, look at the hashtags are artificially feeding on the stock
[1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:56.200]  market crash. And I went and looked and went, Oh, my God. And it was every hashtag was pushing it.
[1:12:56.200 --> 1:13:00.120]  And it was, I mean, he's, you know, an attack man, when it's going down, folks,
[1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:06.920]  I mean, it is scripted, scripted, scripted, scripted, scripted, scripted, scripted,
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:10.840]  scripted, scripted, scripted, scripted. Now, what comes in the later acts? I don't know.
[1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:14.120]  But I've said this a thousand times when I walk in to say,
[1:13:16.360 --> 1:13:21.640]  the mall, you know, I'm going to buy some bedding or whatever, some utensils. They always have some
[1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:26.520]  fake fruit in the, in the, in the home section. And you know, if you've got kids, babies always go,
[1:13:26.520 --> 1:13:30.600]  I want the banana and you're like, honey, that's not real. And they get pissed at you and you
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:35.080]  don't get in the van and you go, look, this is plastic. It's not a real. I didn't need to know
[1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:41.880]  by touching it. I know fakeness when I see it. Well, now though, it's all happened. So it's not
[1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:47.720]  just, we know it's plastic because we looked at it, we bit into it and it's plastic. Doesn't mean
[1:13:47.720 --> 1:13:53.480]  the virus isn't deadly. What it means is the launch of it and the response and the hype. This
[1:13:53.480 --> 1:14:00.360]  is it. This is, this is America. This is a greater threat than Hitler folks in, in, in, in 1940.
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:06.360]  Okay. And the Japanese give me a break once we geared up. I mean, come on folks.
[1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:11.240]  The United States, you attack the United States, you're going to get killed. You're going to get
[1:14:11.240 --> 1:14:16.280]  destroyed. Okay. Of course, we can't win a war against people we've invaded who we're wronging
[1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:21.160]  like the Vietnamese unless we just killed all of them. We didn't have the morale because our own
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:27.480]  troops are like, why are we doing this? But you attack us. You cannot defeat us. What is the,
[1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:32.600]  you know, armies slogan, free the oppressed? Well, I mean, that's not what Vietnam was. We
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:37.480]  thought it was. It was all a big lie. But this is chai comms telling us what to do. This is
[1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:40.920]  the left saying America sucks and hoping for a total collapse of everything.
[1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:45.080]  All right. I've got the one caller. When we come back, I'll get to at least three.
[1:14:45.800 --> 1:14:50.520]  We're going to go to Heath. We're going to go to Patrick and we're going to go to Joe and Jack
[1:14:50.520 --> 1:14:55.080]  and everybody at fish. And I'll just do my best. I just the energy level so high I'm bouncing on
[1:14:55.080 --> 1:15:00.280]  the walls here. And Richard Reeves is a really smart political patriot and old time employee
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:05.560]  of info wars. He hasn't worked during years. He was sending me a lot of great text. I was already,
[1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:09.160]  I said, if I got up at five, they have like four a.m. Richard was sending me all these texts.
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:13.560]  I can show them to you like four a.m. that are dead on as well. And he was predicting the economic
[1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:20.840]  collapse today as well. So all hell's breaking loose. And I'll just do my best here. It's just
[1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:28.600]  the total confirmation of this. It's so evil. It's so dangerous. That's why I'm the most freaked
[1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:34.440]  out right now. Because I've looked at every possible scenario that goes for the globalist
[1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:39.240]  the way they think. And it just gets worse for them. Six or seven moves down, even if they add other
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:44.920]  stimulus in market blood bath stocks, greater oil plunge banks, it hard fed pumps, more cash.
[1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:49.320]  That's rug report dot com. I mean, he's got the best rundown of all those articles on top. It's
[1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:57.240]  just crazy town. America is under 21st century military attack. We can all agree. These are
[1:15:57.240 --> 1:16:03.080]  troubled times, right? So do you know who's on your wireless network, whether it's a big company

[1:20:11.400 --> 1:20:16.840]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[1:20:16.840 --> 1:20:27.240]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:37.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:39.800 --> 1:20:45.000]  Well, you globalists want to fight. You keep starting them because America and the West and
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:49.720]  Christendom was asleep. Now you're pissed doing everything you can. And I'm here to tell you
[1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:56.520]  everything you do just like Hitler did is going to blow up in your dirty globalist faces to get
[1:20:56.520 --> 1:21:03.480]  ready to get your asses handed to you. Your leaders are a bunch of shy come and Hollywood
[1:21:03.480 --> 1:21:18.600]  pedophile filth. Let's go to phone calls. All right, up next. Up next, who's been holding the
[1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:23.560]  longest here? Let's go to Patrick in Michigan. Thank you, sir. Go ahead.
[1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:31.400]  How's it going, Patrick? You doing good in Michigan?
[1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:40.920]  Hello? Yep. Go ahead. Oh, yeah, it's not Patrick. It's Pastor Dino. Okay, just says Patrick there,
[1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:47.000]  but just go ahead. No problem, sir. Thank you for taking my call. First and foremost, I had a
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:53.400]  couple points I wanted to unpack on the coronavirus. But first and foremost, you know, any virus that
[1:21:53.400 --> 1:22:00.360]  they roll out, anything that the eugenicists have, anything that Islam has is nothing compared
[1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:05.080]  to eternal damnation and a lake of fire that's waiting for those that don't put their faith and
[1:22:05.080 --> 1:22:10.440]  trust in Christ. The Bible tells us that we'll believe in our heart and confess with our mouth
[1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:15.560]  the Lord Jesus Christ will be saved. And that's the ultimate answer to all of the... You're absolutely
[1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:19.800]  right. Don't worry about he that can kill the body, but he can kill the soul. Did you see all the
[1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:24.360]  footage that Millie Weaver got last week? She went to the Chucky Schumer event in front of the
[1:22:24.360 --> 1:22:27.560]  Supreme Court where he said, we're going to go after the Supreme Court. We're going to get you.
[1:22:27.560 --> 1:22:32.840]  And the majority of women were saying, I want to kill babies and had like earrings of crocodiles
[1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:38.040]  eating babies. And we're like, I love Satan. I mean, they fully converted to devil worship.
[1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:42.360]  Just like the Bible says, you take God out. The vacuum isn't a vacuum. It gets filled.
[1:22:43.320 --> 1:22:48.120]  And it's a shame that that blood's going to be stained on America and it's on our hands. It's
[1:22:48.120 --> 1:22:53.400]  a shame. Well, you know why they do it. They do it to curse us and bring God's heads of protection.
[1:22:53.400 --> 1:22:57.480]  And that's why Schumer got so pissed. He said, Trump, we're going to get you in the Supreme Court.
[1:22:57.480 --> 1:23:03.640]  We want that baby blood. Absolutely. You notice he finally got animated when it came to killing
[1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:07.400]  kids. That vampire demon boy Schumer came crawling out of his snake pit.
[1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:15.000]  For getting to the coronavirus, you know, for those, I knew you have a large Christian audience
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:19.880]  that listens. So this is probably nothing new to them. But he's a master of blinding people.
[1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:25.000]  He's got the whole world blinded. He's a master magician. And the art of that illusion is to get
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:29.800]  your eyes on one thing. Well, the real work is going on over here. You're not paying attention
[1:23:29.800 --> 1:23:35.080]  to it. So I really don't think that this coronavirus in and of itself is the thing to be
[1:23:35.080 --> 1:23:40.360]  worried about. It's just a door. It's just a rollout. Yeah, it's the real work of plunging the
[1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:46.120]  economy, blaming Trump and then using the civil unrest of the virus to make it non political
[1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:49.800]  reason to drive him from office. But they're going to have leftist operatives on the ground
[1:23:50.520 --> 1:23:56.760]  as sappers. Well, I really think that even the economy and everything is really part of the
[1:23:56.760 --> 1:24:02.200]  sleight of hand that's going on. I think what they're trying to do here, my belief is from a
[1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:08.200]  biblical perspective, is that they need to be able to rule out this genetic modification. They
[1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:14.520]  need to get the public. Oh, you're 100% right. It's a cover for the 5G and the GMO and the
[1:24:14.520 --> 1:24:20.440]  forced inoculations. It just pushes the whole agenda forward. They have to do this to be able
[1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:25.320]  to get the public to sacrifice. And I think the best move that they could make, it's a terrible
[1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:31.160]  move for us. But I think the best thing and the thing we need to look out for is they need a martyr.
[1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:37.000]  They need somebody who is absolutely Hillary Clinton gets killed or something. That's why
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.840]  we don't want any violence. And a false flag is what they're looking for now. Exactly.
[1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:46.840]  And the public says, well, what do we do? And then, hey, conveniently, they just happen to have
[1:24:46.840 --> 1:24:51.480]  a little shirt that you can take. And then they've got this and then they've got that. And they're
[1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:56.040]  Oh, they're keeping you safe. Oh, yeah, the real hysteria is going to hit. Notice we don't have
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:24:59.080]  a vaccine. They're making you beg for it, even though the vaccine is already ready. Great
[1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:06.360]  points, Patrick. Thank you so much for holding. Okay, let's go ahead and go to Joe in California
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:13.560]  and Cornel. Joe, you're on the air. How you doing, Alex? Man, I'm just it's a foreign attack. It's
[1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:17.720]  a globalist stop. The Democrats are celebrating the economy plunging. How do they not think that's
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:24.040]  going to discredit them? They're just crazy. They are. I want to plug real quick on on your product
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:27.960]  real quick for the listeners want to say something that probably you couldn't say.
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:35.320]  I work downtown LA, and there's a mall right right across from my place. And it's a mall that a lot
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:40.600]  of Asian people come in from major, they ship them in there, they go shopping. And this virus was
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:46.440]  here around Christmas. I have a good feeling I picked it up and gave it to my family, because my
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:51.880]  wife and my two kids were deathly ill, like pneumonia. I mean, it was like a three to four
[1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:59.400]  week deal. And I was taking your product the whole way through the vitamin D, the silver
[1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:05.800]  bullet, all the stuff that you have. I buy it every month. I didn't get sick once. So I gave
[1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:10.840]  my we took my kids to the doctor, my wife to the doctor. And basically, the doctors said,
[1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:15.000]  you know, just go home and rest. They were getting worse. So I told them, Hey, why don't you try some
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:19.480]  of the stuff? You know, my wife would laugh at me. Well, she tried it and she got well. So did the
[1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:25.640]  kids. And so if, if the coronavirus, I think there might have been the coronavirus in that area,
[1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:28.920]  I think I might have gotten it. I might have been a carrier, but I'll tell you one thing. This stuff
[1:26:28.920 --> 1:26:35.240]  really works. Well, sir, that's why they wouldn't do testing the last few months, because it's all
[1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:39.480]  over the place. Now that the testing goes out, and Bill Gates is going to pay for tens of millions
[1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:44.200]  of kits because he's going to make money off the vaccine. Then that's when hysteria will break,
[1:26:44.200 --> 1:26:48.440]  because they think it kills you when it's probably just a souped up, you know, type
[1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:53.080]  flu deal. And I totally agree with you. Dr. Steve Pachennick says wild stuff on the show.
[1:26:54.120 --> 1:26:57.880]  He really was high level CFR. He really was the Jack Ryan character. He really did
[1:26:57.880 --> 1:27:03.080]  co-write those books. He really did run the Camp David Accords. He really did run psychological
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:09.080]  operations for the State Department above the CIA. He really did, uh, you know, overthrow at least
[1:27:09.080 --> 1:27:13.640]  six governments. So he'll sit here. I had him on about his memoirs. He was just rattling off memoir.
[1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:17.560]  He never really talked about it all. And people online were like, This is PS. There's no way this
[1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:21.640]  guy did all this. Well, if I rattled off all the stuff I did, it just sounds like BS. There's
[1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:24.920]  people that are active and do stuff. There's people that don't. You know, it's kind of like,
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:29.480]  if you look at the goat, uh, you know, uh, a football, you'd say, Well, that's no way that guy
[1:27:29.480 --> 1:27:35.000]  did all that stuff. And I'm not saying I'm greater Pachennick's great. When he said, Hey, I've met
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:39.720]  with a Chinese student, he's involved in all sorts of Asia operations still with the Pentagon.
[1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:44.920]  I got it. I got deadly ill. I had the coronavirus. Well, now we know that that wasn't as well as he
[1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:52.280]  said. Exactly. I haven't been sick in almost five years. I took a quick vacation. My wife,
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:56.760]  I got sick. She's still coughing. I have a sticky suspicion. Now, when those kits come out,
[1:27:56.760 --> 1:28:00.600]  I'm going to be positive, but I'm not going to announce that now. It's thinking locked my ass up.
[1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:05.160]  It's, it's a bunch of hype. But yeah, it was strong enough that I got a fever, hadn't had one in
[1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:09.560]  almost five years, four plus years. I got one and it took me four or five weeks to get rid of the
[1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:16.440]  cough. People heard it on air. Bunch of coil silver, bunch of vitamin D three. Absolutely. So I get
[1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:20.280]  what you're saying. You're around it. That makes perfect sense, sir, because it now came out that
[1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:25.080]  it was bad in China six months ago. That's now mainstream news. You're absolutely right. Right,
[1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:30.200]  right. I want to stay one. Stay there. Stay there, Joe. We got into all that. Yeah, folks,
[1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:36.280]  you need X two, you need X three, pure. I and I, I'm your whole body, but also is on record.

[1:30:59.480 --> 1:31:04.120]  Owl killer in New Jersey, you're on the air, go ahead. Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great
[1:31:04.120 --> 1:31:07.800]  to be back once again and I've never gotten to do this but I'm going to give you a shout out for
[1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:12.040]  your product. So that's super blue fluoride free toothpaste and that super blue whitening
[1:31:12.040 --> 1:31:16.120]  toothpaste is on another level. I use the one, I use the super blue in the morning and then the
[1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:21.080]  whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum. It is by far the best product that I've ever used
[1:31:21.080 --> 1:31:25.400]  in my life. I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now. I've had four shoulder
[1:31:25.400 --> 1:31:30.520]  surgeries and a back surgery and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical
[1:31:30.520 --> 1:31:33.880]  therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life so I just want to get that out of the way.
[1:31:33.880 --> 1:31:38.200]  Support this man, everything that he exposed. Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove, nobody knew
[1:31:38.200 --> 1:31:43.640]  about Epstein, nobody knew about Bilderberg, nobody called 9-11 before it happened. In July 2001,
[1:31:43.640 --> 1:31:47.400]  go look it up yourself. Well we try our best sir, they definitely want us off the air without you
[1:31:47.400 --> 1:31:56.520]  or not here but yeah, these are all great products so thank you sir.
[1:31:57.080 --> 1:31:59.880]  Hannah, I'm going to end up pronouncing that right. What do you think is really going on and
[1:31:59.880 --> 1:32:03.560]  thanks for calling. So yes, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago, I was getting ready, I went
[1:32:03.560 --> 1:32:09.000]  to buy a bunch of toilet paper and some things before crowds really hit and I had my phone,
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:12.920]  I had my show going on, sticking on my pocket so I could hear it, I wasn't using headphones.
[1:32:12.920 --> 1:32:17.560]  This lady starts, who are you listening to, who is that talking? I said this is Alex Jones and
[1:32:17.560 --> 1:32:23.640]  she just got, her eyes got wide open and she says, really I thought he was off the air and I said no
[1:32:23.640 --> 1:32:28.280]  and I told her, I explained the whole situation and told her where to go, she wrote down you know
[1:32:28.280 --> 1:32:34.040]  band.video and also infowords.com and just said she's still on. I run into people at the grocery
[1:32:34.040 --> 1:32:38.200]  store at the mall on the hiking bike trail and they go, oh Alex I used to love you, I wish you
[1:32:38.200 --> 1:32:41.480]  were still on air, are you ever going to go back on air and I'm like, we're on hundreds of radio
[1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:45.160]  stations, over a hundred TV stations and cable stations, we have our own streams at infowars.com
[1:32:45.160 --> 1:32:48.840]  and band.video and they go, really they said you were off the air because they took the
[1:32:48.840 --> 1:32:55.640]  platforming as off the air, no we have our own platform, info wars, info wars, info wars.
[1:32:55.640 --> 1:33:11.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:12.120 --> 1:33:14.920]  All right, I gotta go quickly to your calls now no matter how good they are,
[1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:16.200]  so we're doing it.
[1:33:16.200 --> 1:33:25.720]  You are listening to an info wars.com front line report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:30.040]  you are the resistance. In fact, because of time constraints, I'll just show you this since I
[1:33:30.040 --> 1:33:35.800]  mentioned it, we know no red shot. This is from over 10 years ago
[1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:44.440]  and you can read where Dr. Keith Muller CEO American Biotech Labs is talking to the Pentagon
[1:33:44.440 --> 1:33:49.480]  and talking to Texas A&M University and it's got the head of Homeland Security in here talking
[1:33:49.480 --> 1:33:53.720]  about how this patented nano silver Department of the Army headquarters United States Special
[1:33:53.720 --> 1:33:59.800]  Operations Command found with Andrew C. Vaughn Eckenbach MD Commissioner of Food and Drugs
[1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:05.880]  that it was taking out the SARS virus which is the coronavirus family and that's just the nano
[1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:12.760]  tech silver that's in our super silver whitening toothpaste that's so good for your body that's
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:17.960]  in the super blue that also has the tea tree oil and iodine. We also have it for children
[1:34:17.960 --> 1:34:22.360]  all fluoride free. It's still all 50% off even though we're about to sell out of the super
[1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:27.400]  silver. We've still got quite a bit of the other two there. I can tell you that Walmart
[1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:33.720]  is trying to order millions and millions of immune guardels right now. I'd like to put them
[1:34:33.720 --> 1:34:39.560]  in production. I've just ordered, they call it something else and ours has iodine there
[1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:43.320]  does but it's the same plant. So now this is about to go nationwide. This is the stuff will be
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:49.480]  everywhere soon. The 18-wheeler is already on its way here from Colorado. We'll be reselling
[1:34:49.480 --> 1:34:53.240]  by Wednesday. It's full of Wednesday. We don't sell stuff till it's in the warehouse like other
[1:34:53.240 --> 1:34:58.200]  people do. It pisses me off man because our food sales went down quite a bit when we said,
[1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:01.800]  hey it's six to eight weeks now. The other people are all sold out. They're lying to you. We know,
[1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:05.560]  we've ordered, we talked to everybody. It's just incredible and then the food industry will be
[1:35:05.560 --> 1:35:10.600]  discredited because of these comebacks. We have the food though. We've just got to package it and
[1:35:10.600 --> 1:35:15.640]  ship it out and it's high quality at forestore.com and they haven't raised prices yet despite that.
[1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:20.040]  Now sales have still gone back up now but we were just watching when we said six to eight
[1:35:20.040 --> 1:35:26.040]  weeks ago and the con artist stuff goes up. We're just not doing it. We will sell no wine until
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:29.560]  it's time as Orson Welles used to say. We're not going to sell you a product if it's not
[1:35:29.560 --> 1:35:34.360]  in the warehouse. I want to be clear though. All of our supplements, the books, the films,
[1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:40.600]  the t-shirts, those all ship within a day or two. We're like up to next day shipping.
[1:35:41.160 --> 1:35:44.520]  Then it takes two or three days to get to you depending on where you're at. If you order on
[1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:48.920]  a Friday though it'll be until Monday it ships out. We're up to the day now. The crew's doing a
[1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:54.440]  great job. Big warehouse here in Austin. It's the food that's six to eight weeks and the truth is
[1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:59.720]  it's four to five but we're just saying that because just it could take longer but depending
[1:35:59.720 --> 1:36:04.920]  on if you order some specialty deal or there's a hang up and the FDA's there on every batch that's
[1:36:04.920 --> 1:36:09.320]  made and these big plants so some never have a problem but knock on wood. You just need to put
[1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:12.840]  those extra two weeks in case a batch got turned back or something because you know any big thing
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:16.920]  where it's Bluebell ice cream or whether it's red barren pizza. In fact for each man there the FDA's
[1:36:16.920 --> 1:36:20.520]  in there you know testing everything as it goes through and so we got to put the extra two weeks
[1:36:20.520 --> 1:36:24.760]  in case it was ever a problem. It's really four to five weeks and they're like don't tell them that.
[1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:31.000]  All I can do is just say what's really going on. It's a new rocees I actually have. Don't tell me
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:33.880]  any secrets. Well I have a lot of secrets but that's the only one I'm told those in confidence
[1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:37.720]  that I don't give them out but they said I could tell you that they're just like okay I guess but
[1:36:38.600 --> 1:36:42.680]  the point is is that you need to get prepared you need to compare now and these nano silver
[1:36:42.680 --> 1:36:47.480]  products that we have are the best you're going to find out there and they're just amazing. Okay let's
[1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:50.760]  go back Joe we got to move quick. Joe what was your point though about the coronavirus?
[1:36:50.760 --> 1:36:58.440]  Well I just want to put a shout out to the president Mr. President it's time you take the
[1:36:58.440 --> 1:37:03.720]  gloves off and start moving forward with the prosecution and letting these people know that
[1:37:03.720 --> 1:37:09.720]  you're not you're not taking any more of their crap. Oh that's exactly what I said when he defeated
[1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:13.640]  the impeachment I said even before I said they're going to come back with something bigger a war
[1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:20.200]  a bio weapon. God knows what you've got to take them down. He has to. He has to take them down.
[1:37:20.200 --> 1:37:25.480]  He has to you know tell China I think he should start budding up with Putin because I know. Oh my
[1:37:25.480 --> 1:37:30.360]  god print that print that I hadn't even seen that it. The New York Times the coronavirus is coming
[1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:37.400]  for Trump's presidency did we not the listeners the get myself do we not call exactly the scripting
[1:37:37.400 --> 1:37:45.400]  here? Absolutely six weeks eight weeks ago. God Almighty thank you Joe. Man I just I just can't
[1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:50.680]  believe they think they're going to get away with it but you know what why do they care? Because
[1:37:50.680 --> 1:37:55.480]  if they get caught staging this Trump's the Justice Department's not going to do anything.
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:38:02.520]  So why not just just keep escalating what they're going to do forever? It becomes a derelict
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:06.840]  you know duty issue but Trump is surrounded by a bunch of lawyers and a bunch of cowards.
[1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:11.960]  So I really can't fault the man hell he's pulling troops out of Afghanistan. He's doing
[1:38:11.960 --> 1:38:18.680]  everything he said he do he or or or die and try him. Oh my gosh who's been on the longest now?
[1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:26.040]  I am. Is that Jack or is that Heath or is that Chris or is it fish? Fish and then Jason Fish
[1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:34.920]  in Colorado thanks for holding. Hey what's up Alex? Man I am just I'm like I stuck my finger
[1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:40.200]  in a light socket I'm so fine I mean stuff's crazy what do you think? I'm thinking the same thing
[1:38:40.200 --> 1:38:45.960]  hey by the way I'm fish man it's nice to meet you it's short for eat all your fish that's my
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:52.520]  YouTube channel I make infomercials for your guys between the segments I make ads for you guys.
[1:38:52.520 --> 1:38:57.640]  Oh I saw that that funny ad you made that's great brother thank you. Yeah man I'm
[1:38:57.640 --> 1:39:02.040]  totally being proactive about getting a job there but that's the whole. Well let me tell you let me
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:05.480]  tell you we were I had to mortgage my house to pay for this year and I was glad to do it it was
[1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:10.120]  like the loaves and fishes or the widows might as of course then this crisis came and now we're
[1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:15.960]  bringing in quite a bit of money but there's a lot of other problems but but but yeah it's
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:19.800]  it's been amazing how all of you promoted the products out there to keep us on air the last
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:24.760]  two years under all the globalist platforming lawsuits we wouldn't have been here if it wasn't
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:28.520]  for you and I got to the point I was happy to mortgage my house started spending the money
[1:39:28.520 --> 1:39:34.280]  into the company and boom now the virus comes in and so a lot of capital is coming in it's just
[1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:40.360]  a crazy time to be alive brother. Yeah I feel you man and I think this coronavirus I mean it's
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:45.720]  definitely being orchestrated I'm wondering where George Soros has been this whole time you know what
[1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:53.960]  I mean. Oh he's been laying low haven't you noticed. He's been laying low. Yeah and I'm thinking that
[1:39:54.600 --> 1:40:01.480]  like kind of like Dr. Evil and his lawyer and like this coronavirus has been unleashed intentionally
[1:40:01.480 --> 1:40:07.720]  to wreck the global economy to kill the supply chain to take down Trump and then when they nominate
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:12.680]  Biden he's going to bring in Hillary for a VP choice she's going to take Biden out and take
[1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:18.040]  over control for the globalist. And they're even saying that in the news now oh don't worry if Biden
[1:40:18.040 --> 1:40:24.040]  can't talk Hillary's going to swoop in last it's it's it's what's incredible is how scripted it all
[1:40:24.040 --> 1:40:30.360]  is we should be able to beat that shouldn't we knowing what's coming. Yeah I mean it's it's uh
[1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:34.600]  it's straight out of their globalist playbook and I knew that they were going to pull some
[1:40:34.600 --> 1:40:40.520]  like people I think underestimate just how evil these people are. Oh no they released a bio weapon
[1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:44.040]  and then used the media to hype it and then advise Trump with their own people to say it was no big
[1:40:44.040 --> 1:40:48.520]  deal so that they could then absolutely hype it to the next level. I want to show people a document
[1:40:48.520 --> 1:40:54.520]  came shot though. This is who we're up against ladies and gentlemen. This is who the the time
[1:40:54.520 --> 1:41:02.440]  life books was saying would be the president back in the 60s just look at that lazy-eyed evil little
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:08.840]  vessel that's for the demon editor though but now you look at her and she is run by something else
[1:41:08.840 --> 1:41:14.520]  but that's the empty vessel a little traumatized mind-controlled daughter of a mafia boss.
[1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:21.720]  That's who she is but that's that's who thinks she can that's the goddess that they worship
[1:41:21.720 --> 1:41:27.000]  that they believe can destroy America and bring down the republic and I say they're going to fail.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:32.520]  Thank you sir. All right let's go to Joel when we come back let's go to Heath right now in Louisiana
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:41.240]  Heath are on the air. Hey Alex. Can you hear me? Yes I sure can. I just wanted to talk about you know
[1:41:41.240 --> 1:41:45.080]  this whole new world order thing you know it's been going on since the second century when they
[1:41:45.080 --> 1:41:49.720]  established the council to see you to force people to believe and see things in a specific way
[1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:54.680]  changing the whole indoctrination of the gospel and then moving forward after that you know you get
[1:41:54.680 --> 1:41:59.640]  to the 1800s when they put out these perversions of the bible forcing people to see the bible through
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:05.960]  the new world order instead of the actual truth of the gospel and you know the 1980s and the 2000s
[1:42:05.960 --> 1:42:10.440]  you know the Rockefeller you know even admit that they want to establish a major crisis so that
[1:42:10.440 --> 1:42:14.920]  people will accept the new world order and you move forward and now you know as they put all these
[1:42:14.920 --> 1:42:20.600]  towers up you know pressing over time and all these satellites and stuff feeding into people
[1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:25.560]  making body people's bodies feel a specific way and be a specific way and stuff like that
[1:42:25.560 --> 1:42:30.360]  it's changed and altered how people think and are and they want to create that one world society
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:37.000]  through these things. Exactly use a global pandemic to bring in their world government
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:41.320]  and I think Trump walked into their trap he's not perfect he was advised by people hey play this
[1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:45.640]  down it's gonna be okay that makes sense and now they're trying to set him up he should see
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:50.200]  what happened there thank you so much Heath all right we did good job that segment took like
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:55.640]  four calls I'm coming right back right back on the other side with more of your calls. Everybody
[1:42:55.640 --> 1:43:00.440]  needs food I'm proud we're selling high quality food elections globalism the economy the bubble
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:06.040]  this is something you need on your checklist to have done but for me it just is a bummer to know
[1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:10.840]  that everybody needs food and I had long discussions this morning over an hour long discussion
[1:43:10.840 --> 1:43:14.680]  with different individuals at different levels of this right now the folks run the plants to get
[1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:19.560]  the best idea we have but they want me to say six to eight weeks just so people aren't getting pissed
[1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:24.840]  but understand the last food company the biggest food company is now at hundreds of times their
[1:43:24.840 --> 1:43:29.880]  regular order and they were having discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales
[1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:34.040]  next week and at a certain point just saying we're done because people are going to take food orders
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:38.360]  out 10 weeks we don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks and then just all the weirdness that comes
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:42.440]  with that because we're honest under promise over delivered but technically it's going to be six to
[1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:46.520]  eight weeks and we want you to get a great deal and feel like we took care of you so you come back

[1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:08.920]  turbo force I drive truck for a living and it's amazing coffee kind of gives you a little crash
[1:46:08.920 --> 1:46:14.440]  there at the end but that turbo force is amazing. How is turbo force different than coffee? I'll
[1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:21.880]  tell you what it's sustainable anywhere from 18 hours I don't feel the jitters like I do drinking
[1:46:21.880 --> 1:46:26.920]  coffee and it's just you know at the end of the day I don't need anything to go to bed I'll you
[1:46:26.920 --> 1:46:32.680]  know knock out to my mouth cold. Well that's what we went out to a top developer who did
[1:46:32.680 --> 1:46:38.680]  want his name on it and I said what would the ultimate long say 10 hour energy be is that possible
[1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:43.000]  that's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:47.880]  natural that are time released and there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product
[1:46:47.880 --> 1:46:53.080]  so that's why turbo force has such a great effect and so I really appreciate you and I'm glad that
[1:46:53.080 --> 1:47:22.440]  you like turbo force. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:47:23.080 --> 1:47:32.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. There is now zero doubt that the globalist
[1:47:32.520 --> 1:47:39.080]  engineered this virus released it. Told Trump it was no big deal so he wouldn't really respond so
[1:47:39.080 --> 1:47:42.440]  they could blame it on America and tank the stock market and where is the stock market right now
[1:47:42.440 --> 1:47:48.520]  let's look that up. I've actually got a quote from Henry Kissinger that I'm going to read to you
[1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:51.720]  and we start the next hour you guys print that off for me it's kind of hard for me to read that
[1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:56.360]  off the screen dealing with the fact that America would never put up with UN troops
[1:47:57.080 --> 1:48:03.160]  invading it unless there was a giant crisis be it economic biological or military
[1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:07.960]  but the Dow Jones industrial average
[1:48:12.920 --> 1:48:20.280]  is down 1834 points right now this is all being done synthetically you can see how it'll drop for
[1:48:20.280 --> 1:48:24.280]  a few hours and stop when the Federal Reserve goes in and pumps liquidity in to stop it
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:27.880]  and then it goes a while and then it stops again when they block it.
[1:48:30.040 --> 1:48:36.120]  Here's the quote today Americans would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore
[1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:40.600]  order tomorrow they will be grateful this is especially true they were told there was an
[1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:46.200]  outside threat from beyond whether real or promulgated that threatened our very existence
[1:48:46.200 --> 1:48:53.880]  it is then that all people the world will pledge with world leaders to deliver them from evil
[1:48:56.360 --> 1:49:00.680]  one thing every man fears is the unknown presented with a scenario individual rights
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:05.560]  will be willingly relinquished with a guarantee of their well-being granted them by their world
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:12.840]  government Henry Kissinger and addressed to Bilderberg, Evian, France May 21st 1992
[1:49:12.840 --> 1:49:19.400]  that was transcribed from a tape recording made by one of the Swiss delegates that's on record
[1:49:19.400 --> 1:49:26.360]  major newspapers like let me read it the way he would do it today Americans would be outraged if
[1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:33.240]  UN troops into Los Angeles to restore order tomorrow they will be grateful this is especially
[1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:38.360]  true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond whether real or promulgated
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:44.760]  that threatened our very existence it is then that all people the world will pledge with world leaders
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:51.720]  to deliver them from this evil the one thing every man fears is the unknown and presented
[1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:55.880]  with a scenario individual rights will be willingly relinquished with a guarantee of
[1:49:55.880 --> 1:50:01.160]  their well-being granted them by their world government all right i'm gonna go back to your
[1:50:01.160 --> 1:50:07.480]  calls Richard Reeves called in a long time a co-host with me and great political researcher
[1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:12.440]  and i wanted to just get a few minutes from him on what he sees is happening here how deadly is
[1:50:12.440 --> 1:50:17.320]  the virus really he's got a good scenario to break that down with the cruise ships as a test
[1:50:17.320 --> 1:50:22.360]  example a good laboratory example but clearly this is synthetic clearly it's been launched to bring
[1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:26.200]  down the economy and the democrats are now celebrating everywhere i've even gotten the
[1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:30.680]  articles the tweets and the videos she's already seen them hoping a few weeks ago we bet i'm like
[1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:36.680]  yay bring down the market down with america down with trump i mean that should be discrediting them
[1:50:36.680 --> 1:50:43.160]  not the other way around Richard Reeves thanks for coming on hi alex thanks for taking my call and
[1:50:43.160 --> 1:50:48.120]  hey the lex lucer thing i think it's probably working but you should probably come down the
[1:50:48.120 --> 1:50:53.080]  one upmanship with battle with owing because the next thing he's allowed to do is come out in the
[1:50:53.080 --> 1:51:00.280]  speedo and do the broadcast and i think he'll beat me in that yeah he's yeah so anyway where do you
[1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:05.240]  want to start alex tell me where you want to sit me a lot of messages at 4am i was already up and
[1:51:05.240 --> 1:51:09.880]  you made a lot of sense so get into your your cruise ship petrie dish is a great scientific
[1:51:09.880 --> 1:51:13.880]  study to see how deadly it really is i think it shows it's not that deadly but that matter the
[1:51:13.880 --> 1:51:19.160]  hype is giant and is the real threat you were getting into all that absolutely well i think
[1:51:19.160 --> 1:51:24.600]  for now the the canary in the coal mine to watch is the diamond princess scenario which
[1:51:24.600 --> 1:51:30.600]  evidently they've uh unleashed and unloaded those 2600 passengers but basically the scorecard is
[1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:36.840]  there were 2600 passengers on there last i checked which was yesterday morning there were 1900 people
[1:51:37.480 --> 1:51:45.160]  unaffected non-infected but presumably 100% exposed and then you have 700 that were
[1:51:45.160 --> 1:51:50.760]  infected which that's an ugly number that's a high percentage of the 2600 that's a little scary but
[1:51:51.400 --> 1:51:55.480]  there are only as of yesterday morning seven reported deaths which works out to
[1:51:55.480 --> 1:52:02.200]  less than 1% that's 0.27% so far as of yesterday morning
[1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:09.640]  so and i agree with you that that's a laboratory type test you're on a ship it's a classic example
[1:52:09.640 --> 1:52:14.760]  of plague and so you get to find out how communicable it is and how deadly it is with that and so it
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:19.240]  looks like uh that it's a very very low number and it's it's a couple of old people that died
[1:52:19.240 --> 1:52:25.640]  right right very low death rate number so uh that'll be the thing to watch for and i guess the
[1:52:25.640 --> 1:52:31.240]  question would really be now is what level of tracking is going on with those passengers that
[1:52:31.240 --> 1:52:36.600]  now presumably been scattered all over the world you know including the united states but i would
[1:52:36.600 --> 1:52:41.080]  just imagine anybody coming into an er room you know they're going to find out where they came from
[1:52:41.080 --> 1:52:46.120]  where they've been who they've been exposed to etc so i think that we'll still probably have a
[1:52:46.120 --> 1:52:52.360]  pretty decent tracking of the diamond prince's passenger roster around the world and we should
[1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:58.360]  get reporting but the other thing though that i would kind of think in that text also is that
[1:52:58.360 --> 1:53:04.120]  the 2600 that would be presumably on a cruise that would be overall a higher level of fitness
[1:53:04.120 --> 1:53:10.520]  than they would from a segment of the 2600 a similar 2600 person segment of the general population
[1:53:10.520 --> 1:53:16.600]  because most likely you are going to have fewer fewer very young people and fewer very old people
[1:53:16.600 --> 1:53:20.440]  that are going to be on the boat so they're probably still that high sampling of old people
[1:53:20.440 --> 1:53:24.280]  it's still very very low some people say well then why are you freaking out for six weeks the
[1:53:24.280 --> 1:53:29.320]  unified choreographed response to the media with the chycoms and others shows you they were going
[1:53:29.320 --> 1:53:33.080]  to try to blame trump with this and i think he's walked right into it i'm not blaming the president
[1:53:33.080 --> 1:53:37.400]  his advisors told him play it down now they're saying don't play it down and the media is all
[1:53:37.400 --> 1:53:42.040]  trying to blame the president but i'm going to do that richard but what about this for me this is a
[1:53:42.040 --> 1:53:47.960]  really central point paramount the way they're saying oh now there'll be plenty of testing
[1:53:47.960 --> 1:53:52.120]  kits well we all know it's already spread around the country we already know it's not as deadly as
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:57.640]  they've been saying but regardless once people learn that large numbers have it and then each
[1:53:57.640 --> 1:54:03.640]  person has to be locked down that saps the economy and it will create the illusion of a nation totally
[1:54:03.640 --> 1:54:11.000]  paralyzed and then leftists are going to exacerbate that with civil unrest what do you think well i
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:17.880]  agree with you alexa potentially this would be and will may be a big economic recession
[1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:23.640]  slash depression but trump is the road runner i see that he's got a huge opportunity to do
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:29.160]  this whole thing i mean china has plausible deniability that they've launched this bio weapon
[1:54:29.160 --> 1:54:33.640]  but that means they also have plausible accountability trump could just come out and say hey
[1:54:34.440 --> 1:54:39.480]  trump you know could say that china china clearly does not like me being president i've
[1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:45.960]  brought tariffs to bear on the chinese economy and it's hurt them economically wise so they've
[1:54:45.960 --> 1:54:51.240]  launched this bio weapon against us to hurt our economy and to attack our supply chain from china
[1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:56.520]  etc i mean there's so many points there to cover and that trump could just judo this to say the
[1:54:56.520 --> 1:55:02.280]  chinese are literally meddling in our election this election cycle we've heard the democrats out
[1:55:02.280 --> 1:55:08.040]  there yelling and yelling about supposed russian meddling in our election well trump has a lot
[1:55:08.040 --> 1:55:12.920]  more proof that china is meddling in our election and i just can't imagine you know trump has a way
[1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:19.240]  of saying things and simplifying things for the american public that he could probably say in a much
[1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:25.080]  more powerful way than me but uh he could get out there and judo this and and i could imagine that
[1:55:25.080 --> 1:55:30.200]  most american people if they understand it and get wind of it how are they not going to vote for
[1:55:30.200 --> 1:55:34.840]  trump i mean uh are you here in town i know you're out in california a couple weeks ago are you
[1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:39.480]  here in austin i'm here in austin right now yes well you should come in studio the next few days
[1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:43.000]  god bless you richard great points all right we're gonna break come back hold another hour
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:50.280]  of phone calls bunch of clips but this is hillary just a month or so ago on um matt mountow show
[1:55:50.280 --> 1:55:56.200]  and she was on there with her boyfriend talking about we need china to meddle you know because if
[1:55:56.200 --> 1:56:00.360]  trump asked for russia to meddle we need china well china is meddling so that's her hiding
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:07.000]  in plain view who she really works for here it is and since russia is clearly backing republicans
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:15.000]  why don't we ask china to back us i hear by tonight ask china that's right and not only that china
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:22.200]  if you're listening why don't you get trump's tax returns i'm sure our media would rich lee reward
[1:56:22.200 --> 1:56:29.480]  you that was all tongue-in-cheeked by trump he knew it was eric prince got the wiki leaks i mean
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:34.120]  i told you that years ago it was even the new york times they usually live that was accurate
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:38.840]  it was prince and and and groups in the pentagon that were sick of hillary for ben gauzing and
[1:56:38.840 --> 1:56:43.160]  then prince just helped get it out and of course they now know that okay it wasn't the russians
[1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:51.080]  i mean the russians are good guys overall i mean they're not we did it america did it
[1:56:51.080 --> 1:56:56.760]  we dealt with that witch okay can we get a little bit of credit here but see they don't want americans
[1:56:56.760 --> 1:57:04.920]  defeating that anti-american trash they want to say oh the russians did it so the pentagon and and
[1:57:04.920 --> 1:57:11.880]  trump and alex jones are listening to russians give me a break i don't do what trump tells me
[1:57:11.880 --> 1:57:17.240]  he doesn't do what i tell him we do what's right now it's usually aligned but it doesn't
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:20.840]  doesn't mean that i'm sitting there and taking orders man i'm not a commissioned officer in the

[2:00:23.960 --> 2:00:29.080]  i still i've covered a lot of the news but i haven't had a lot of this this this this epidemic
[2:00:29.080 --> 2:00:34.440]  news because it's totally synthetic it's absolutely designed to create a sterian
[2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:43.880]  herder economy and the democrats are so arrogant undisciplined i don't know but i don't i don't
[2:00:43.880 --> 2:00:51.720]  like north korea but the people are slaves there i wouldn't go oh there's a virus bringing down north
[2:00:51.720 --> 2:01:01.640]  korea yay that's real people i wasn't celebrating china being hit by that i said you watch this is
[2:01:01.640 --> 2:01:10.120]  aimed at us they're the incubation they're the petri dish but as of this morning at like 10 a.m
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:15.320]  before i went on air there were articles cnn abc news they've been showing them new york times
[2:01:15.320 --> 2:01:24.680]  we're gonna get trump thank god for the virus you can't gaslight a pandemic you're done yeah the stock
[2:01:24.680 --> 2:01:33.880]  market's crashing yeah wow don't they get just like dr strange love they're riding that hydrogen
[2:01:33.880 --> 2:01:42.120]  bomb down and we can show that riding the hydrogen bomb down lex limb pickings
[2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:51.400]  to actually see them do it to project it and see they were upset it up wasn't hard to see
[2:01:51.400 --> 2:01:56.920]  it and then to see them do it i mean i've been to a
[2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:03.560]  dog show and a rodeo and to church and
[2:02:06.040 --> 2:02:12.440]  to a cop's fight and i never seen nothing like this before i mean it's just like what the hell
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:18.680]  because according to propaganda rules whether you're good or bad you wouldn't do something like this
[2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:24.840]  so yeah bring down america whoa yeah and it's just it's not even a news issue it's on info wars.com
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:28.360]  but it's all in echo chambers
[2:02:30.920 --> 2:02:33.640]  i just man i tell you what boy
[2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:41.800]  i am pissed right now i said i go to your calls and i love you to death there's been all the longest here
[2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:52.040]  we're gonna go to cornell next segment let's go to jason organ go ahead jason thanks for holding
[2:02:54.440 --> 2:02:58.840]  hey alex let's get to talk to you again uh this is jason from germany uh we moved back to i moved
[2:02:58.840 --> 2:03:03.160]  my family back to orgin in 2017 and as you can see with what's happening with the turkey and
[2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:07.640]  increased situation you can see this yeah you're literally getting invaded again by the muslims
[2:03:07.640 --> 2:03:14.040]  exactly so anyway we we made out good on that uh on that hunch as it turned out turned out to be
[2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:19.640]  the right move anyway uh on the coronavirus real quick um i think we need to agree that
[2:03:19.640 --> 2:03:26.680]  trump's messaging on this has been just cat just catastrophic get out trump we said it six weeks
[2:03:26.680 --> 2:03:33.400]  ago he got conned he screwed the pooch he knows it now all right so he now trump plays the strong
[2:03:33.400 --> 2:03:37.720]  man role really well if you want to uh i think he needs to look at ways that he can play the
[2:03:37.720 --> 2:03:43.320]  strong man oh i agree yeah how does trump turn the tables on the chi-com bio attack that's the
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:47.880]  question what does he do well he's he's got to come out strong at least on his messaging and
[2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:51.960]  the messaging has to be consistent across the board there can't be any difference between
[2:03:51.960 --> 2:03:57.000]  what he's saying what a star or some of the other people uh not you know next to him uh at these
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:01.880]  press conferences are saying there's gotta be a unified message number one number two that
[2:04:01.880 --> 2:04:07.240]  message has gotta include some pretty strong rhetoric uh that reassures all the states that the
[2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:10.920]  federal government is going to take a more proactive role in how states handle it because
[2:04:10.920 --> 2:04:14.520]  it actually almost doesn't matter what the federal government does if the states don't play along
[2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:20.840]  anyway i mean i can see here in oregon that what they're doing here uh if if the if the strategy
[2:04:20.840 --> 2:04:26.040]  that oregon jason it sounds like you ate your wheaties today we're gonna go to break for 60
[2:04:26.040 --> 2:04:31.080]  seconds i want you to give the president a briefing on how to save the republic you'll

[2:08:16.040 --> 2:08:20.440]  recap at all because imagine trump's got to deal with the states he's got to deal with the insurance
[2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:23.480]  he's got to deal with the banks he's got to deal with the foreign governments got to deal with
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:29.240]  treaties it's a mess and they've just taken this thing and hyped it oh you beat our race for oh you
[2:08:29.240 --> 2:08:34.200]  beat our russia gate how about a virus we released that hypes it up and then we blame you and then
[2:08:34.200 --> 2:08:38.680]  we plunged the economy and say it's your fault but as long as he attacks it and owns it and points
[2:08:38.680 --> 2:08:45.080]  out that they are the ones that exacerbated it and the left instead of saying oh it's fake news that
[2:08:45.080 --> 2:08:50.600]  this virus is deadly just say hey you're the ones hoping it brings out america how dare you root for
[2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:55.560]  this to be terrible we hope and pray that this is better and people should get sunshine and get
[2:08:55.560 --> 2:09:01.560]  vitamin c and get gloital silver and get iodine and you know people just want trump to hold their
[2:09:01.560 --> 2:09:07.400]  hand but instead he's was telling there's no problem well when the media creates this hysteria
[2:09:07.400 --> 2:09:12.520]  knowing this virus is all over the u.s been here for six months they're gonna say you're dead wrong
[2:09:13.320 --> 2:09:18.440]  and from in there just one button they push so trump needs to take action and i'm not telling you this
[2:09:18.440 --> 2:09:24.840]  uh on march 9th i told you this six weeks ago coach ace see you better listen to me trump because
[2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:30.280]  i'm on your team you brought me here i brought you here we're together but you've got to listen
[2:09:30.280 --> 2:09:35.240]  to us and i know you are now should go ahead uh knowledge the crowd jason brief the president
[2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:41.640]  uh thanks alex so you know a lot of my suggestions are coming from family and friends that work in
[2:09:41.640 --> 2:09:46.200]  the healthcare industry these are healthcare professionals who have you know i can hear you
[2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:50.760]  you're smart you know what you're talking about so brief the president so he needs to create a
[2:09:50.760 --> 2:09:55.000]  i mean if he already hasn't you know started it you need to create a federal task force that's
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:10:00.680]  specifically tasked with monitoring state response because as i was trying to point out here here in
[2:10:00.680 --> 2:10:06.520]  oregon state the state healthcare professionals have taken a an approach that if trump had advocated
[2:10:06.520 --> 2:10:10.680]  it he would have been attacked for because what what they're saying here is uh if you've got a child
[2:10:10.680 --> 2:10:16.040]  at a local school that has been tested positive for coronavirus we are not yet advocating for
[2:10:16.040 --> 2:10:19.880]  those schools to close down they're actually telling schools keep going even if you've got
[2:10:19.880 --> 2:10:23.800]  kids that are coming down from the virus don't shudder the schools well that's not something
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:28.440]  that you would expect uh a left-leaning more liberal you know government to be advocating
[2:10:28.440 --> 2:10:33.640]  no they want they want the maximum spread well that could be part of it too but what i'm saying is
[2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:38.360]  there's trump's got to come out as the one who's actually the strongest in his response on this
[2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:44.040]  and and go ahead and let the liberals and more left-leaning entities you know let them take the
[2:10:44.040 --> 2:10:49.080]  fall for their lackluster response don't let don't listen to me and like adam said six weeks ago
[2:10:49.080 --> 2:10:53.480]  be decisive up front on guidelines see if the state's implement them and then he's already
[2:10:53.480 --> 2:10:57.800]  put out their coding and stuff and then it's not implemented it's not his fault he doesn't respond
[2:10:57.800 --> 2:11:02.200]  they say he didn't take action right and he needs to take the higher root on the messaging and leave
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:07.560]  leave that partisan stuff you know attacking nancy and and chuck out out of the mix let let
[2:11:07.560 --> 2:11:13.080]  let us let people like you let his let his supporters handle those attacks he needs to stay
[2:11:13.080 --> 2:11:16.920]  on message when he's when he's dealing with coronavirus messaging stay on message don't
[2:11:16.920 --> 2:11:22.600]  make it a don't make it partisan let let people you know in the media like you and others handle
[2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:27.960]  the other stuff and just on the economic side the supply chain side trump needs to come out and
[2:11:27.960 --> 2:11:32.680]  reassure the american people that he's taking extreme and proactive measures to ensure our
[2:11:32.680 --> 2:11:38.120]  supply chain remain uh reliable well exactly hey we don't know how deadly it is probably
[2:11:38.120 --> 2:11:44.520]  almost all hype but the economic crisis in this in the supply chain crisis that is very real and
[2:11:44.520 --> 2:11:49.560]  again why do you think democrats are openly licking their lips celebrating this and celebrating
[2:11:49.560 --> 2:11:54.520]  the downfall of the economy i think that's a major miscalculation by them so far i can't recall
[2:11:54.520 --> 2:12:00.520]  trump coming out and and decisively you know articulating the fact that we rely so heavily
[2:12:00.520 --> 2:12:04.600]  on china that this should at this point out that our reliance our heavy reliance on china is actually
[2:12:04.600 --> 2:12:09.640]  a detriment not a benefit and he i think he needs to call up the defense production act of 1950
[2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:15.160]  that gets him the authority to put the put some pressure on local companies in the United States
[2:12:15.160 --> 2:12:24.040]  to ramp up production of necessary items you're a smart guy what do you do uh i'm an armchair
[2:12:24.040 --> 2:12:27.640]  researcher man i just i read a lot no you know what you're talking about all right good to hear
[2:12:27.640 --> 2:12:32.840]  from you thank you okay let's go to cornell in seattle the epicenter of the north american
[2:12:32.840 --> 2:12:37.480]  outbreak cornell thanks for holding her on the air thank you alec i'm feeling the fire
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:46.600]  i can feel it too man america's under attack this is you admit it oh i agree you want to go back
[2:12:46.600 --> 2:12:52.360]  to what patrick says that we serve the lord of lords king of kings and in 2016 when everyone
[2:12:52.360 --> 2:12:58.120]  thought trope was going to lose we were praying fasting because we needed something better for
[2:12:58.120 --> 2:13:01.640]  the nation and that's what's going to happen right now christian's going to pray we're going to fast
[2:13:01.640 --> 2:13:08.520]  and this is all the hope not a you know the the hysteria around it is just blown up you look at
[2:13:08.520 --> 2:13:17.240]  south korea 0.7 percent you know death rate they're moving you know uh test 15 000 a day in america
[2:13:17.240 --> 2:13:23.640]  can't do more than a thousand like this is ridiculous what do you think's going on cornell
[2:13:23.640 --> 2:13:31.480]  you know going back you know i'm from seattle and you know like you said the epicenter yeah uh
[2:13:31.480 --> 2:13:37.480]  Kirkland over here where the care center was you know the employees haven't even been tested
[2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:42.920]  180 employees 70 have symptoms not all of them are getting tests people are wondering why haven't
[2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:51.480]  they gotten tested yet but don't worry bill gates has test that's because they sabotage it early
[2:13:51.480 --> 2:13:56.120]  so the u.s wouldn't have solidarity with china or others so that later it comes
[2:13:56.120 --> 2:14:02.840]  once the worldwide hysteria is worse and then trump explains i agree i agree and i know someone
[2:14:02.840 --> 2:14:09.480]  first handedly gave cpr to someone that had covet 19 where they tested no with the family
[2:14:09.480 --> 2:14:17.320]  tested no you go into someone in isolation that has tuberculosis and you're getting tested right away
[2:14:17.320 --> 2:14:21.720]  why isn't that the same with this virus because they know it's already all over the us and i don't
[2:14:21.720 --> 2:14:27.480]  think it's as deadly as they think and so thank you yeah but people say well that what you're
[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:32.120]  saying it's not as deadly as they're saying why are you saying freak out because it's a synthetic
[2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:37.880]  move the high the globalists are making their move get ready because of that get ready because
[2:14:37.880 --> 2:14:42.520]  this is their big move and back to president back to republic and point out that it's china
[2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:50.600]  that a man made by a weapon well what if we had 180 000 people tested like south korea
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:56.360]  or over that and we found out that the death rate was actually a lot less oh you just reversed
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:15:01.720]  the script you're right they don't want mass testing not to cover it up not trump it's a
[2:15:01.720 --> 2:15:06.680]  bureaucracy but because it's not that deadly and mass testing would prove it wasn't and that
[2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:15.960]  would in the hype oh that's why i love callers you oh say that again say that again why aren't
[2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:20.680]  they putting out tests like south korea if we could take them for an example and then the
[2:15:20.680 --> 2:15:26.600]  death rate would be a lot lower because we see how many people have the disease as well as you know
[2:15:27.720 --> 2:15:33.160]  oh that's it they're suppressing the kits you can say not to cover up the infections
[2:15:33.160 --> 2:15:38.600]  but to show the infections were already here and that there's very low death rate which
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:43.240]  ends the hysteria which they're using as the economy and president trump and that's why
[2:15:43.240 --> 2:15:48.920]  we take calls for now we've had a lot of amazing callers but that was the most important statement
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:57.960]  of the day that was profound maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon you'll need a plan

[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:13.480]  months ago i came up with a plan that i haven't launched yet we have a warehouse full of hundreds
[2:19:13.480 --> 2:19:18.840]  of thousands of stickers 20 different stickers impeach the democrats save the second amendment
[2:19:18.840 --> 2:19:23.240]  defend the first amendment info wars.com and it looks like duct tape but it's just a regular

[2:19:27.400 --> 2:19:31.240]  even disrupting things people say why are you doing this what's happening when you go well we're
[2:19:31.240 --> 2:19:35.640]  being censored you know trump won't do anything about it and dr pacinic i'm let me just ask you
[2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:41.000]  what you think because i've not launched this yet it's brilliant you've taken the very element that
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:47.560]  they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon you have the loudest sound of all
[2:19:47.560 --> 2:19:53.160]  silence and you know what's most disturbing to people silence silence silence silence
[2:19:53.160 --> 2:20:00.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:00.120 --> 2:20:11.080]  you
[2:20:11.080 --> 2:20:28.040]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:20:41.640 --> 2:20:52.040]  different
[2:20:52.040 --> 2:20:56.600]  okay i was almost late i was 30 seconds late and back in here because i was in a meeting
[2:20:57.640 --> 2:21:05.800]  with a research scientist a chemist and then our marketing guys and then we have an expert
[2:21:05.800 --> 2:21:10.120]  in supplements and i tell you to come this meeting so i was in there like four minutes they're like
[2:21:10.120 --> 2:21:15.480]  um we told you a few weeks ago we're selling record amounts of our clean atomic iodine we have
[2:21:15.480 --> 2:21:19.640]  the only deep earth crystal iodine you're going to find out there x2 x3 has some of that in the
[2:21:19.640 --> 2:21:24.440]  other two types of iodine and some people can't absorb only the pure atomic iodine everybody
[2:21:24.440 --> 2:21:28.440]  else calls their iodine atomic iodine but that's not the case it's this other type of iodine that's
[2:21:28.440 --> 2:21:35.800]  bound to other other members of the periodic table we'll leave it to you with that because
[2:21:35.800 --> 2:21:42.520]  no one wants to go through the dea and have a dea controlled facility that you got to pay for
[2:21:42.520 --> 2:21:49.080]  every year at your factory and then dea inspections every quarter we did that because we wanted to
[2:21:49.080 --> 2:21:54.760]  have the best iodine for you so i'm going to go to your calls this was not a planned plug
[2:21:57.160 --> 2:22:00.440]  and i was researching in this of this of this morning
[2:22:00.440 --> 2:22:06.680]  and i wasn't going to get to this yet but i'm just going to cover this now because this is news
[2:22:08.840 --> 2:22:14.200]  this isn't just a plug of products this is news remember six seven weeks ago i came to you and
[2:22:14.200 --> 2:22:19.080]  i said we have the biggest verbal foods company in the united states the most respected
[2:22:19.800 --> 2:22:23.560]  fema just tried to buy all their food up it was actually the office of procurement or whatever
[2:22:23.560 --> 2:22:28.520]  that was for fema the letter we got was technically from them and they said no but
[2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:32.520]  everybody else has sold out so other people that said they had swarable food didn't really have it
[2:22:32.520 --> 2:22:37.480]  we did we said the package didn't get it out we still do document cam shot please
[2:22:41.240 --> 2:22:45.160]  they've been for weeks telling me hey we're we're selling three times as much iodine we're
[2:22:45.160 --> 2:22:50.440]  going to sell out and i said that's not a problem call up the manufacturer in utah
[2:22:52.040 --> 2:22:56.040]  and the other one in arizona and tell them double production
[2:22:56.040 --> 2:23:00.520]  well they just got off the phone with them well they've been talking to them all day it was a
[2:23:00.520 --> 2:23:05.000]  third phone call they talked to them this morning they go yeah we're glad you called about ramping
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:11.880]  a production we have federal agencies calling us by the second call the feds are threatening them
[2:23:14.440 --> 2:23:20.520]  saying you have a strategic stockpile and they're like well who's your boss what's the is there a
[2:23:20.520 --> 2:23:27.160]  court order that's how hysterical this has gotten people keep asking how do we have the nanotech
[2:23:27.160 --> 2:23:32.760]  silver the pentagon authorized and everybody went on once because that's what we do how do we
[2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:37.160]  have the iodine nobody else has how do we know trump was gonna win nobody else did how do we
[2:23:37.160 --> 2:23:41.720]  expose they were coming at first with us because we're in the zeitgeist we're blessed by god this
[2:23:41.720 --> 2:23:47.480]  is what i do i don't watch football all day i don't sit there and like act trendy and know all the
[2:23:47.480 --> 2:23:52.600]  hollywood stuff i don't even know i don't even go to see movies anymore i don't even give a damn about
[2:23:52.600 --> 2:24:02.520]  it but i live in this world of reality so let me show tv viewers this radio listeners can pull this
[2:24:02.520 --> 2:24:09.240]  up this is out of the financial review newspaper melbourne company creates a nasal spray for coronavirus
[2:24:09.240 --> 2:24:13.400]  it's getting approved in australia they're looking at proving it here in the u.s and it shows how in
[2:24:13.400 --> 2:24:22.920]  these studies it knocks out coronavirus and here it is a big study sars coronavirus by means of
[2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:29.800]  that that name means raw iodine is bound we have the clean one physical conditions and chemical
[2:24:29.800 --> 2:24:37.320]  reagents and it's a huge study on how it kills it not just on the surface in the blood infectious
[2:24:37.320 --> 2:24:45.080]  disease management control with iodine inside the body so this morning i'm like hey write an ad
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:24:51.400]  if i'm going to plug this well they got the ad done like an hour ago but that's not the issue
[2:24:52.520 --> 2:24:59.480]  the issue is just like when i'm like what fema's trying to buy up all the food in the country and
[2:24:59.480 --> 2:25:04.680]  he has six weeks ago i said this must be big this is going to be huge it's a bellwether
[2:25:04.680 --> 2:25:13.400]  it's an example let's say you live near a military base and you see all the riot police get ready
[2:25:13.400 --> 2:25:17.640]  and load their guns i mean you don't know what's going on is it a drill is it real but let's say
[2:25:18.760 --> 2:25:23.400]  riots are already going on let's say cities are on fire you see troops getting ready you know oh
[2:25:23.400 --> 2:25:28.600]  okay something big's going down it's human intelligence it's grassroots the most important type
[2:25:28.600 --> 2:25:37.560]  that the nano silver that we get from the top company they're they're calling us going uh if
[2:25:37.560 --> 2:25:44.280]  you want another order in walmart just taking everything over see i'm not going to say the
[2:25:44.280 --> 2:25:50.520]  private stuff but and then now we're like oh yeah just just double the iodine production oh sorry uh
[2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:55.160]  do you know a homeless security's threatening us saying that that they may just
[2:25:55.160 --> 2:26:02.840]  commandeer our plant yeah i want to sell products and funder operation and stay on air and kick the
[2:26:02.840 --> 2:26:09.480]  globalist ass and hire a bunch of reporters that's important to me but that's secondary to what is
[2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:17.160]  going on ladies and gentlemen i mean i'm calling my nano tech silver people it's getting all bought
[2:26:17.160 --> 2:26:21.480]  up i'm calling my iodine people it's all getting the government's like threatening them you're
[2:26:21.480 --> 2:26:29.320]  going to give us that iodine because it's atomic it's crystal i paid to have it mined my million
[2:26:29.320 --> 2:26:36.360]  dollar contracts paid for that you don't just think just easter bunnies just get that do you
[2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:41.720]  you got to pay the oil companies on their way down the gas companies at 10 000 feet seven to 12 000
[2:26:41.720 --> 2:26:47.960]  feet you got to pay for them to extract it and pay to have it taken out which is expensive for them
[2:26:47.960 --> 2:26:52.360]  you're like my god they won a million dollars i don't sell no compared to oil and gas it's nothing
[2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:57.320]  millions a day just to drill those suckers you want them to extract it you got to beg them and then
[2:26:57.320 --> 2:27:01.080]  they'll get their engineers and they'll grab it and give it to you and it's like these crystals and
[2:27:01.080 --> 2:27:05.640]  if you throw one on the ground it's just like dream of genie purple smoke it eats holes through
[2:27:05.640 --> 2:27:09.480]  things but once you put in the palm oil it's totally different for your body your body just
[2:27:09.480 --> 2:27:15.800]  takes it in like superman takes in our yellow sun it's amazing and we have the x2
[2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:23.080]  x3 is not a lowly product it's just the deep earth crystal and two others because again some people
[2:27:23.080 --> 2:27:28.920]  cannot absorb what the engineers and scientists tell me the pure iodine without the other iodines
[2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:34.360]  in it and they're still excellent but my point is all hell's breaking loose right now i mean here's
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:39.400]  the ad i'm going to cut later mainstream science confirms iodine kills coronavirus family
[2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:44.920]  mainstream science has been researched in the effects of iodine for 100 years we have discovered
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:50.120]  key research that shows how forms of iodine and early effective against the coronavirus family
[2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:54.840]  or highly effective against coronavirus family abola and others one major study found that one
[2:27:54.840 --> 2:28:02.680]  form of iodine demonstrated more than 99.99 activity and actively against viruses including
[2:28:02.680 --> 2:28:06.920]  abola mirrors SARS coronavirus influenza and others i've got the studies that you showed
[2:28:06.920 --> 2:28:12.680]  them to you mainstream pharma companies are now even creating iodine products to fight coronavirus
[2:28:12.680 --> 2:28:18.920]  financial times confirms that forms of iodine could be capable of reducing the amount of
[2:28:18.920 --> 2:28:24.680]  detectable coronavirus to almost 100 so i should just say financial times of one another say
[2:28:24.680 --> 2:28:31.480]  pure iodine's cutting it down to almost 100 the importance of pvp1 iodine and its emphasis
[2:28:31.480 --> 2:28:35.800]  by its inclusion the world health organizations list of essential medicines actively has been
[2:28:35.800 --> 2:28:40.440]  observing against viruses of significant global concern including hepatitis a influenza as well
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:45.480]  as the middle east respiratory syndrome and sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses
[2:28:45.480 --> 2:28:50.760]  that's right out of mainline studies and again yet again it's only god all glory goes to god

[2:33:48.840 --> 2:33:53.640]  have in the blood the whole solar system up yeah not in Kansas anymore folks
[2:33:53.640 --> 2:34:02.680]  with the advent of all of that old-fashioned warfare lining up and killing each other kind of became
[2:34:03.880 --> 2:34:11.160]  old shoe old hat yesterday's news but now it's economic war now it's culture war now it's spiritual
[2:34:11.160 --> 2:34:23.960]  war which had always been before hadn't it and so that's where we are now and this is 21st century
[2:34:23.960 --> 2:34:31.800]  war and the president needs to come out and say the truth he gives a fireside chat on the globalist
[2:34:31.800 --> 2:34:37.000]  the chai comms and americans that are rooting against our economy and rooting for the collapse
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:45.240]  they're all done it's over you got to call it like it is it's a no-brainer it's your victory
[2:34:47.160 --> 2:34:51.400]  but will the president do that that's the big question all right you've been very patient
[2:34:51.400 --> 2:34:56.520]  i appreciate everybody holding let me go back to your phone calls right now we're gonna try to
[2:34:56.520 --> 2:35:02.760]  move as quickly as possible here so that folks don't hold too long chris in washington state
[2:35:02.760 --> 2:35:08.520]  we're on the air go ahead hey it's an honor to talk to you alex honor to talk to you brother go
[2:35:08.520 --> 2:35:14.360]  ahead hey you know i've been talking to a lot of people and um you know we've been trying to figure
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:19.640]  out this you know why are they doing all the suppression of testing you know the corrupt
[2:35:19.640 --> 2:35:27.320]  disease control that we have um you know and i've and i've basically come cornell broke it down to
[2:35:27.320 --> 2:35:32.840]  you know you want to talk one of the speakers you just had i believe that he he's on to something
[2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:40.680]  there they're suppressing the testing so that way they aren't getting the actual data out that shows
[2:35:40.680 --> 2:35:47.880]  that it's not as bad as it is because they do want the economic collapse that they're that you know i
[2:35:47.880 --> 2:35:53.240]  mean well that's right they're not putting the kits out to cover up how bad it is they're putting
[2:35:53.240 --> 2:35:59.240]  the kits out to cover up it's not bad a hundred percent a hundred percent and i think that if
[2:35:59.240 --> 2:36:06.840]  the president would actually go on the offense and stop the the yeah i don't i don't even know how
[2:36:06.840 --> 2:36:14.040]  to say pussy footing what's that pussy footing yeah if he would if he would just be the president
[2:36:14.040 --> 2:36:19.880]  that we elected and you know the the eight point two billion dollars how he said he only wanted
[2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:26.520]  two point five or whatever use some of that money to help the businesses here locally because our
[2:36:26.520 --> 2:36:34.680]  our food supply chain it it's drastically going to be affected oh yeah this supply side this this
[2:36:34.680 --> 2:36:39.160]  supply chain thing is real what similar about the virus this is a big deal and now they're
[2:36:39.160 --> 2:36:44.120]  trying to exacerbate it and use it against the economy it's so obvious but what about how obvious
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:48.840]  it is the democrats and globalists are seizing on this this would imagine if i would on air and said
[2:36:48.840 --> 2:36:53.240]  i hope this destroys america you'd all hate me and be done with me i wouldn't do that anyways but
[2:36:53.240 --> 2:36:59.480]  how do the democrats get away with it uh you need to me i i don't understand how there's even a
[2:36:59.480 --> 2:37:07.560]  democratic party left it there isn't there the the the demon crats they're just a group of terrorists
[2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:11.960]  that hate america thank you so much chris thank you that really is it isn't it
[2:37:11.960 --> 2:37:21.800]  jack at atlanta wow i didn't see you're holding that one sorry jack thanks for holding jack around
[2:37:21.800 --> 2:37:28.760]  the air yes sir a first thing i want to do your crew and your products are outstanding quick plug
[2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:34.680]  i'm a prior military and international airline captain and i believe i was also exposed to this
[2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:40.520]  particular virus and i uh i used uh the silver products that i keep my bag i always have iodine
[2:37:40.520 --> 2:37:44.920]  in there and lots of items to be in d3 well that's amazing your international airline pilot if
[2:37:44.920 --> 2:37:48.280]  anybody's gonna be exposed it's you this is important we'll get to your next topic but
[2:37:48.840 --> 2:37:55.960]  talk about when it was what you think happened well i don't know if it came in with the uh
[2:37:55.960 --> 2:38:01.000]  loading uh crews that uh load the aircraft possibly but you know all of a sudden i've got
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:06.520]  the uh you know out of nowhere the sore throat throwing nose the post nasal the you know basically
[2:38:06.520 --> 2:38:10.760]  flu flu symptom i'm like well hell with this and i'm stuck on a trip so i just started
[2:38:11.320 --> 2:38:17.000]  down in the silver and i always take iodine anyway because my little thing i'm exposed to gamma
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:22.520]  you know at high altitude so i take it in here at any rate but uh i started rubbing that stuff
[2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:28.040]  on my nose i had the super gel and i put some of that inside my nostril i know it sounds nasty
[2:38:28.040 --> 2:38:32.600]  and uh and i started breathing the gar you know uh gargling the back of my well who told you to do
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:36.440]  that because that's what the big the big farm is coming out with an iodine that they're gonna
[2:38:36.440 --> 2:38:43.080]  spray up the not be into the sinus okay you just exchangeably thought put it in your nose
[2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:51.000]  yeah yeah absolutely well keep going captain tell us what else well anyway that that's
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:54.680]  hung on and i you know i felt the millies and all that kind of stuff for a few days i got a pretty
[2:38:54.680 --> 2:38:59.160]  strong immune system anyway but i felt that stuff for a few days i'm like hell with this i started
[2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:05.560]  drinking a lot of water and i work out every day and uh within about 40 uh it's pretty much gone
[2:39:05.560 --> 2:39:09.400]  and i had you know the stuff in the back of your throat where your cops and stuff up a little bit
[2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:14.200]  but that was about it well jack thanks for holding i apologize we got so many phone lines but you're
[2:39:14.200 --> 2:39:18.360]  here now what is your view on the virus and what trump needs to do and what you think is really
[2:39:18.360 --> 2:39:23.240]  going on well i'm going to dovetail into your previous calls i think that we should have had
[2:39:23.240 --> 2:39:29.160]  an andy dexon moment long ago but this is what i'm thinking i am sick of absorbing strength
[2:39:29.160 --> 2:39:32.680]  i'm absolutely tired of that i want to go on offense i want to start smashing these people
[2:39:32.680 --> 2:39:37.400]  the nose i am done with this and this is what i think we should do if you want to upset the bank
[2:39:37.400 --> 2:39:43.640]  and do this in in in broad strokes this is what i think i'm looking at that clock right now and
[2:39:43.640 --> 2:39:50.200]  we have real tangible damages from china we know this release release the genesis of that let us
[2:39:50.200 --> 2:39:54.760]  let the american people metabolize exactly where this thing came from start putting the word out
[2:39:54.760 --> 2:39:59.400]  right now just like you are but let's start getting this uh trump involved putting the word out and
[2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:05.960]  and we have damages to our market medical law enforcement supply chain disruption transportation
[2:40:05.960 --> 2:40:11.240]  cost let's start deducting that right now the two trillion dollars the uh chinese owner our bond
[2:40:11.240 --> 2:40:18.920]  there's about seven trillion in in uh foreign-owned debt for our country that foreign-owned uh national
[2:40:18.920 --> 2:40:23.640]  debt we need to and china is the biggest holder after the federal reserve you're dead on exactly

[2:41:05.720 --> 2:41:11.560]  americans took on to bail out mostly foreign banks when i look at that foreign held debt
[2:41:12.360 --> 2:41:17.160]  and offset that with the 17 remaining debt oh yeah most of its money the federal reserve gave the

[2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:15.320]  but they're all out trying to hype folks out about buying toilet paper and you got to wear it
[2:42:15.320 --> 2:42:21.240]  forget toilet paper folks i want to give you a little bit of a message here but
[2:42:22.600 --> 2:42:28.360]  i'll be gross here but if you got a shower you ain't got to wipe your ass that's a fancy dupe
[2:42:28.360 --> 2:42:34.760]  you're on a toilet paper you're gonna survive but if you do not have items that boost your immune
[2:42:34.760 --> 2:42:42.280]  system like dna force plus like turmeric bodies like banana silver products we have you're gonna
[2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:46.920]  have a problem if you're dead but ash wiping i'm trying to be gross here is the least of our
[2:42:46.920 --> 2:42:51.560]  problems we'll be able to take care of that hell get get like the new york times wipe your ass with
[2:42:51.560 --> 2:42:57.640]  that i want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because i hadn't tried it except for
[2:42:57.640 --> 2:43:02.360]  maybe the last week and a half and um i told alex i said man this is the best toothpaste i've ever
[2:43:02.360 --> 2:43:05.800]  tried he's like well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and
[2:43:05.800 --> 2:43:12.120]  tell people and oh so here i am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far
[2:43:12.120 --> 2:43:16.600]  the best toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm 45 years old and i've tried a lot of different
[2:43:16.600 --> 2:43:21.800]  toothpaste and it's fluoride free i think the big difference the game changer in this is the
[2:43:21.800 --> 2:43:27.560]  coral calcium because after i brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that i
[2:43:27.560 --> 2:43:33.240]  don't even like rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like
[2:43:33.240 --> 2:43:38.600]  it feels like good things are happening in my mouth in fact i find myself brushing my teeth
[2:43:39.320 --> 2:43:44.200]  three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because i like the way it feels
[2:43:44.200 --> 2:44:01.240]  across the western world from high school to college sports to even the olympics men biological
[2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:08.200]  men are winning almost all of the sporting events this is men invading women's spaces
[2:44:08.200 --> 2:44:14.280]  and bullying them and taking their rights away all in the name of the liberalism and openness
[2:44:14.280 --> 2:44:20.680]  and then every day i have stacks of news articles just like today uk team find under house arrest
[2:44:20.680 --> 2:44:27.480]  for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings uk mother spared jail for
[2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:34.600]  misgenerating trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have caused anxiety
[2:44:34.600 --> 2:44:41.320]  in the new royalty that's the thought police if a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason
[2:44:41.320 --> 2:44:47.640]  you get fined and you go to jail this is tyranny these people are bullies and it's sick and it's
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:54.840]  evil and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover resist it speak out against it we always
[2:44:54.840 --> 2:45:00.440]  promote being prepared having firearms knowing how to use them and be self-sufficient and learn how to
[2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:04.680]  hunt and learn how to garden i mean it's just it's what we're meant to do it feels good when we do it
[2:45:04.680 --> 2:45:09.800]  but we do so high quality swareable food i told my patriot a month ago i said what can you handle
[2:45:09.800 --> 2:45:12.520]  i said i think this is gonna be really big and they said we can handle probably this we're not
[2:45:12.520 --> 2:45:16.280]  sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund i said no i think
[2:45:16.280 --> 2:45:19.160]  this is gonna be huge i think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more
[2:45:19.160 --> 2:45:22.360]  food even though the prices are going up for you so those are the types of questions we have i'm just
[2:45:22.360 --> 2:45:27.720]  giving the inside baseball of all of us this is a hundred times regular volume plus was a hundred
[2:45:27.720 --> 2:45:33.000]  times a few days ago now it's about 200 times okay at infowarstore.com you go right in the queue
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:37.880]  first come first served but the fact that the orders are so ultra massive it's dizzying i mean
[2:45:37.880 --> 2:45:42.920]  this is just insane we're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe and then if it
[2:45:42.920 --> 2:45:47.560]  continues like this we're looking at having to suspend food sales but everybody gets their order
[2:45:47.560 --> 2:45:51.640]  in we'll get your food but that's how big this is so what you're getting is 100 the straight

[2:45:58.280 --> 2:46:03.320]  waking up to their tyranny how they run their scams their Ponzi schemes how they're building a
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:08.280]  post-human world but we know they're going to strike back and the UN has said that they're
[2:46:08.280 --> 2:46:15.160]  going to absolutely implode third world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized
[2:46:15.160 --> 2:46:21.000]  hordes to come in and overwhelm the west and collapse our social services and a giant clowered
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:27.400]  and pivot program the UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world
[2:46:27.400 --> 2:46:34.760]  government inner coronavirus this is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed
[2:46:34.760 --> 2:46:40.600]  and to be spreading the word because people are waking up like never before but this fight against
[2:46:40.600 --> 2:46:47.400]  tyranny is neck and neck so spread the word about banned.video and infowars.com forward slash show
[2:46:47.400 --> 2:46:53.400]  that is so important you are at the center of the resistance you are our only hope
[2:46:56.920 --> 2:46:59.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:46:59.560 --> 2:47:28.920]  you are you're about to see something really amazing radio listeners there's the feed at infowars.com
[2:47:28.920 --> 2:47:36.360]  forward slash show and banned.video but this is a CNBC live feed from the
[2:47:39.160 --> 2:47:47.640]  stock market system now let's look at it right here on screen way over here on the left hand
[2:47:47.640 --> 2:47:57.480]  side reading left or right you see obama when he left office almost four years ago that's where
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:48:03.000]  the stock market is because america wasn't open for business china was the only place you can invest
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:12.440]  with the environmental regulations the taxes the tariffs now trump becomes president-elect boom
[2:48:13.240 --> 2:48:16.440]  goes down a little bit though nobody's sure maybe the inauguration is not going to happen
[2:48:17.720 --> 2:48:23.800]  then he gets inaugurated and what happens done done done done done done done done done done done
[2:48:23.800 --> 2:48:27.960]  done done this is all just confidence of course it's fiat doesn't matter we can do anything
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:31.640]  here comes coronavirus a couple weeks ago
[2:48:35.400 --> 2:48:36.680]  and it's already lost
[2:48:39.080 --> 2:48:48.680]  more than half its gains since obama left we can never have a three percent growth rate
[2:48:48.680 --> 2:48:57.560]  but america was done stop markets down 2 000 points today but look at that look at where
[2:48:59.080 --> 2:49:07.160]  obama is they could have turned it on better than trump they run it that china had 10 growth
[2:49:07.160 --> 2:49:12.760]  rate four years ago china was getting it all because the people weren't getting it the
[2:49:12.760 --> 2:49:18.760]  globals were getting it and leveraging chinese slave power worldwide so here's obama for the
[2:49:19.720 --> 2:49:25.320]  american person and then here we go right here but look at what they've done with coronavirus
[2:49:25.320 --> 2:49:33.800]  was it not called perfectly here we are six weeks ago right here at this peak saying they are pissed
[2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:39.560]  we are winning this virus the way it's hyped the way the media is behind china look out
[2:49:39.560 --> 2:49:44.920]  this is the attack and again i don't tell you oh look we were right to go oh look i'm so smart
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:51.160]  i don't give a rat's ass i'm a recluse if you want to get down to breast tax i don't care about that
[2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:56.920]  i just want you to know man i'm telling you what's going on and i know you already get it
[2:49:58.040 --> 2:50:02.040]  so spread the word right now because it's that word of mouth they know you've got it they know
[2:50:02.040 --> 2:50:09.800]  i've got it they know we got it and they don't want to get down so they want to do this to us with a
[2:50:09.800 --> 2:50:16.920]  virus that maybe has killed a hundred people in the us talk about of mice and men talk about the
[2:50:16.920 --> 2:50:22.520]  wicked flea with none pursue but americans aren't cowards they take what our media says like it's
[2:50:22.520 --> 2:50:27.640]  the end of the world and trump said a terrible job and now all these trillions that the american
[2:50:27.640 --> 2:50:32.360]  people had a piece of the market you had you invested the globalist moved all that money out
[2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:36.600]  before they dropped it and they're all laughing at you with the chai comms right now so we need
[2:50:36.600 --> 2:50:40.840]  to have a discussion about how do we defeat this how do we say no to this but this is a big deal
[2:50:40.840 --> 2:50:44.680]  let's go back to your phone calls for a couple seconds before jerry solente takes over but i'm
[2:50:44.680 --> 2:50:49.800]  pledged to do it and i love you to death we're holding i really appreciate you all uh so who's
[2:50:49.800 --> 2:50:57.960]  up next uh let's go ahead and uh take my mic on here let's go to uh james in georgia thanks for
[2:50:57.960 --> 2:51:07.560]  holding um can you hear me it's not sure can james thank you uh yeah i believe the economy would
[2:51:07.560 --> 2:51:15.880]  have uh dropped anyways drastically due to the uh supplies line being severed but oh absolutely
[2:51:15.880 --> 2:51:24.040]  that alone is just ginormous right but i 100% we're under attack uh and it's going to be like
[2:51:24.040 --> 2:51:30.520]  waves in my opinion and i just worry once all the people are running around like chickens with
[2:51:30.520 --> 2:51:35.880]  their heads cut off that uh they're going to drop that emp and by the way let me just say
[2:51:35.880 --> 2:51:39.080]  this not to interrupt you but it's every time i talk to a caller you just enlightens everything
[2:51:40.200 --> 2:51:44.280]  we could beat the germans we could beat the japanese we could beat the soviets we can't
[2:51:44.280 --> 2:51:48.920]  beat our own media attacking us with a virus unless we realize they're behind it so we just
[2:51:48.920 --> 2:51:53.000]  got to tell americans hey let's not be scared of this they're trying to kill our economy and let
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  everybody know the democrats and the globalists are behind it and just keep saying democrats and
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:01.240]  globalists are behind it democrats and globalists are behind it and as long as the president does
[2:52:01.240 --> 2:52:04.520]  that they're going to run for the hills you talk about chickens with their heads cut off
[2:52:04.520 --> 2:52:10.280]  but if trump keeps trying to cover up this he's not covering up the viruses that he's covering up
[2:52:10.280 --> 2:52:15.240]  the the hype the war they launched he already lost that fight he needs to belly up and take
[2:52:15.240 --> 2:52:23.640]  him on head on what do you think we do james uh he's been infested with the globalists since
[2:52:23.640 --> 2:52:29.720]  he's got there man so i you know i don't know i guess maybe i've given up a little bit of hope
[2:52:29.720 --> 2:52:35.480]  on trump i mean yeah now that's a good point is he just dumb no why is he always surrounding
[2:52:35.480 --> 2:52:42.280]  himself with globalists he's done a lot of good stuff but you know yeah right like i said i don't
[2:52:42.280 --> 2:52:47.080]  have the answer but i worried that the the tax will continue to come because at all cost they're
[2:52:47.080 --> 2:52:51.800]  going to keep him out but see if he's a globalist why would they be attacking him see that's the
[2:52:51.800 --> 2:52:58.280]  paradox they genuinely don't like trump is a globalist i believe the neocons have just swamped
[2:52:58.280 --> 2:53:04.520]  him with the globalist bolton Pompeo i even believe pence is a globalist that's just my opinion but
[2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:08.760]  oh yeah well listen when i ask these questions james i'm not debating you i'm like asking you
[2:53:09.320 --> 2:53:15.480]  because i literally i agree with you this this is crazy right now i don't believe trump is a
[2:53:15.480 --> 2:53:22.040]  globalist i i just i think he's overwhelmed oh i believe me i got a crew that's fully behind me
[2:53:22.040 --> 2:53:27.720]  i'm overwhelmed and i'm 47 46 i couldn't imagine being in trump's position and i gotta tell you
[2:53:27.720 --> 2:53:32.280]  i don't just i'm not gonna be confident when i'm not he looks like hell now for the first time he
[2:53:32.280 --> 2:53:36.920]  looks bad right now i wonder what news he's getting he got all these big ceo's resigning
[2:53:36.920 --> 2:53:42.520]  that's on news wars dot com top three ceo's just resign what he thinks behind that i
[2:53:44.120 --> 2:53:50.280]  i have no idea really i i just you know that if they cut all the communications of the patriots
[2:53:50.280 --> 2:53:55.880]  and you know i go back to the bible the bible says the oral Babylon will be in put in the dark
[2:53:55.880 --> 2:54:01.800]  you know and the only way to put us in a dark would be an emp and the koreans north koreans
[2:54:01.800 --> 2:54:07.800]  got that satellite going overhead every day so well all i know is i don't need a satellite or any
[2:54:07.800 --> 2:54:13.320]  internet or tell me that any globalist once this goes to a civil war i'm not going to be killing
[2:54:13.320 --> 2:54:21.480]  cops and fbi agents and bureaucrats um that one thing they fear is they're gonna try to stage riots
[2:54:21.480 --> 2:54:26.600]  and weird pitch battles we left us the right wingers don't go to those fights but about civil war
[2:54:26.600 --> 2:54:31.720]  breaks up brother europe you like santa claus you should be making a list about who's naughty who's
[2:54:31.720 --> 2:54:36.360]  nice and i'm not kissing police ass they're not the enemy i'm not kissing fbi ass they're not the
[2:54:36.360 --> 2:54:43.160]  enemy globalists that work with chi coms and did this and openly rooted for our country's destruction
[2:54:43.160 --> 2:54:48.120]  if it goes to a shooting war who's the enemy i'm asking you everybody should be having that
[2:54:48.120 --> 2:54:51.960]  discussion right now because they're gonna vaporize a federal building and blame it on us we know
[2:54:51.960 --> 2:54:56.840]  false flags coming so as they kill trump we're removing because all they do is create riots in
[2:54:56.840 --> 2:55:01.320]  hysteria and then and then kill him like oh well it doesn't matter in the middle of hysteria they
[2:55:01.320 --> 2:55:05.800]  believe they kill the president and they do that then they're gonna start coming after us and so all
[2:55:05.800 --> 2:55:11.400]  i'm saying is i'm not taking it lying down so one thing for sure god's in charge so that's that's
[2:55:12.600 --> 2:55:17.640]  you know have faith in god and pray that's let me tell you how real god is man and i know everybody's
[2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:23.000]  had these experiences god bless you thanks for your call well i'm everybody knows young people
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:27.160]  are more tuned into god and have been brain damaged by the systems were more clairvoyant but
[2:55:27.160 --> 2:55:30.520]  i mean i used to have these dreams where i'd wake up sweating and it's not to be really the
[2:55:30.520 --> 2:55:35.160]  stupidest thing like they're gonna change the golf course in front of our house and build a house
[2:55:35.160 --> 2:55:40.920]  right there and then three years later they changed the golf course and build a house right there and
[2:55:40.920 --> 2:55:44.600]  i went in the house they're building it was the exact same house i looked out the window and
[2:55:44.600 --> 2:55:52.040]  it was like i had time travel to that point then i had other dreams where what am i doing walk
[2:55:52.040 --> 2:55:59.240]  him on a center block building and all of a sudden there's a guy in a pink and green striped polo
[2:55:59.240 --> 2:56:09.800]  shirt with a knife trying to kill me and then a few months later that happened to me because i had
[2:56:09.800 --> 2:56:14.360]  like an older girlfriend was like 17 i'm like 15 i'm riding with her she wants to go buy a weed in

[2:57:16.040 --> 2:57:22.120]  there right after he had sex with his women and he looks up as the earthquake starts and there's
[2:57:22.120 --> 2:57:26.760]  literally an angel like on like from a sealants looking at him saying yeah you better watch what

[3:00:27.240 --> 3:00:33.800]  joel in ohio welcome back to the transmission thanks for being here with us hey alex uh two
[3:00:33.800 --> 3:00:40.520]  things first of all the guy the media is trying to blame trump for for firing the pandemic
[3:00:41.240 --> 3:00:46.680]  expert guy that was john bolton john bolton pressured him and his team into resigning
[3:00:49.880 --> 3:00:56.040]  now you're absolutely right elaborate on that well um that's not the reason i call it i just
[3:00:56.040 --> 3:01:00.760]  heard somebody bring up john bolton but somebody needs to look into that but here's what's the
[3:01:00.760 --> 3:01:10.440]  the important part so one of the two companies the government's now facilitating testing with
[3:01:11.160 --> 3:01:21.560]  is quest diagnostics they started working in china in 2006 then in 2011 they expanded
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:28.600]  creating a alliance partnership with king med diagnostics king med they're the ones doing
[3:01:28.600 --> 3:01:36.920]  all the testing in china and king med quest several other companies started a global diagnostic
[3:01:36.920 --> 3:01:45.080]  network in 2018 so everything that china knows all the data everything should be in quest diagnostics
[3:01:45.080 --> 3:01:53.480]  database well that's a great point and the globalists that run our government to a great
[3:01:53.480 --> 3:02:00.520]  extent they've had us merge with china's databases forever already and it's not just that it's uh
[3:02:00.520 --> 3:02:11.560]  cleveland clinic too they worked with king med in 2014 on pathology and uh q q two labs in the u.s
[3:02:11.560 --> 3:02:20.600]  they worked with king med on and vitro diagnostics like it's insane we should have all the data we
[3:02:20.600 --> 3:02:28.040]  should be running our own tests a long time ago what do you think president trump needs to do to
[3:02:28.040 --> 3:02:32.440]  get ahead of this because clothe trying to set him up you just need to say it came from china
[3:02:32.440 --> 3:02:40.360]  it's man made screw you instead of like bowling down to it well i think i think there's it's not
[3:02:40.360 --> 3:02:46.120]  acceptable for us to not have all the information and and the data not just the u.s every country
[3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:52.120]  around the world should know everything about it and the fact that we don't know whether their
[3:02:52.120 --> 3:02:59.800]  information is correct or not that they gave us that's absurd well they're the left is openly
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:07.000]  celebrating this they're openly celebrating the stock market drop what does that tell people
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:12.680]  they're celebrating attacking the economy i i just i can't believe that they just do that
[3:03:12.680 --> 3:03:21.640]  well this global diagnostic network the i think you guys and the trump administration
[3:03:21.640 --> 3:03:26.600]  i think everybody needs to look into that and ask quest diagnostics that's about to start
[3:03:26.600 --> 3:03:32.360]  doing testing why didn't they bring this up why don't we have that data great point brother thank
[3:03:32.360 --> 3:03:38.760]  you joel joseph in ireland and we'll hold you over but get started down joseph what do you

[3:06:34.920 --> 3:06:41.480]  break joseph recap i mean the chai comms have lost the war so now they're not taking it lying down

[3:06:48.520 --> 3:06:55.400]  not expelled anybody the japanese the two choices go underneath or go to war they went to war now
[3:06:55.400 --> 3:07:02.600]  difference between japan and china is japan didn't have america's factories china has your factories
[3:07:02.600 --> 3:07:08.600]  they ain't given them back so they've turned their country into a gulag they released the virus
[3:07:08.600 --> 3:07:13.720]  because it's a war it's a virus to start the war to cut the fat so they're going to use it to get
[3:07:13.720 --> 3:07:17.400]  rid of all their old so they'll have extra food supplies their military is gearing up their
[3:07:17.400 --> 3:07:22.200]  factories are not going to turn over to military production meanwhile america will descend into
[3:07:22.200 --> 3:07:28.200]  chaos this is a narrow street at your stock market it will collapse i'm sorry i'm not here to the
[3:07:28.200 --> 3:07:33.320]  marl no but i see it it's a double-edged weapon to shut down taiwan to shut down their own people
[3:07:33.320 --> 3:07:37.880]  to make them the victim the whole corporate media says they're the angel and then trump's the bad
[3:07:37.880 --> 3:07:42.920]  guy for the wuhan virus we're not supposed to call it wuhan you can see the scripting i don't think
[3:07:42.920 --> 3:07:48.120]  the dog's gonna hunt i think the average american is going to see through a foreign authoritarian
[3:07:48.120 --> 3:07:54.200]  regimes attack and not buy it yeah but the problem is like this virus is real it's going to leave
[3:07:54.200 --> 3:08:02.280]  children scarred for life it's going to wipe out the old this virus was made to order yeah the chai
[3:08:02.280 --> 3:08:08.200]  comms have released a bio weapon yeah and the left is why is the left cheering it then it's
[3:08:08.200 --> 3:08:12.600]  going to be so deadly don't they know they'll be blamed later the democratic party the liberals
[3:08:12.600 --> 3:08:20.520]  are cheering this virus no you see alex the this tsunami will overwhelm everything and only
[3:08:20.520 --> 3:08:25.400]  what's going to happen exactly they don't care what happened before this is their big assault
[3:08:25.400 --> 3:08:32.840]  this is it and i'm not like i'm okay the end line here is the collapse of the currencies
[3:08:32.840 --> 3:08:37.160]  and they're going to force us to take the mark of the beast which is the chip that's the bit here
[3:08:37.160 --> 3:08:42.520]  one more gov and i said to you on another episode i said god is going to step in here at some stage
[3:08:43.480 --> 3:08:49.960]  soon we will get a final warning before the war but people will not us will not change
[3:08:49.960 --> 3:08:55.640]  and this is happening and i'm going to the bible now this is happening because we're
[3:08:55.640 --> 3:09:02.360]  murdering our children and this is a plague alex this is straight from the bible the river of
[3:09:02.360 --> 3:09:07.400]  blood now in in in turkey sure if you give your children a mullet god will send flags at you
[3:09:08.600 --> 3:09:15.240]  and the reality is in the bible when moses went to egypt or went into egypt to release the jews
[3:09:15.240 --> 3:09:19.080]  the first thing he did was turn the river to blood and the egyptians knew what that meant
[3:09:19.080 --> 3:09:23.400]  that meant there was death coming but they were still they were stubborn and they refused because
[3:09:23.400 --> 3:09:29.880]  ferro was proud well those rivers of blood now in in in turkey and that will have meaning soon
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:34.840]  that there will be there'll be like the wars are coming because they've destabilized the world oh
[3:09:34.840 --> 3:09:39.320]  you're right we're in a world war two world war two moment where everything's popping off now
[3:09:39.960 --> 3:09:44.120]  yes yes and i'm sorry i don't want to be doing them but the reality is
[3:09:44.120 --> 3:09:49.080]  is either god is right or is wrong and god is right as far as i'm concerned the bible is correct
[3:09:49.080 --> 3:09:54.520]  and the bible talks about us going under one world government where all power will be handed
[3:09:54.520 --> 3:09:59.960]  up to the antichrist now the pope is beaverly going around the fox pope is beaverly going around
[3:09:59.960 --> 3:10:04.200]  putting in place the one world church the one world government is being is in place the one
[3:10:04.200 --> 3:10:09.640]  world oh you're right now it's all being put in place and it will exist for one year i appreciate
[3:10:09.640 --> 3:10:14.040]  your call we got a jam and some others here great call though norman in washington you're on the air
[3:10:14.040 --> 3:10:20.440]  thanks norman hello alex thanks for taking my call thank you brother i've been a long time
[3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:25.160]  listener i love your products i take x2 every day i just love you getting the products keep us on
[3:10:25.160 --> 3:10:31.160]  air but they are great products all right i gotta get this theory out before i forget um it's my
[3:10:31.160 --> 3:10:36.840]  belief that there is no virus that what's going on is mass propaganda by the media in order to
[3:10:36.840 --> 3:10:41.400]  make us all think there's a virus you get the common flu and you go downtown you go to the
[3:10:41.400 --> 3:10:47.560]  hostel which they don't want to go you go get tested and that's when they selectively infect you
[3:10:47.560 --> 3:10:51.880]  with the test from china because everything's made in china right all the kits are made in china
[3:10:51.880 --> 3:10:56.280]  everything's all our medicines made in china right that's another reason why we didn't get the test
[3:10:56.280 --> 3:11:02.600]  kits right up front because you know it there was a delay getting the kits and china's the savior
[3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:08.600]  advising everyone now on how to deal with they're going to come teach us how to lock people up and
[3:11:08.600 --> 3:11:13.560]  arrest them and kill them not only that but the children you know that knows the children are
[3:11:13.560 --> 3:11:18.200]  getting sick that's because they're not giving the bad test strips or the test kits to the children
[3:11:18.200 --> 3:11:21.960]  they don't want to kill the children right they just want to take out the old and oh everybody's
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:26.520]  texting me including my wife like an hour ago i was like i think it's to kill old people absolutely
[3:11:26.520 --> 3:11:31.640]  that this is a sickening disgusting globalist operation the good news is i think people are
[3:11:31.640 --> 3:11:36.200]  seeing through it norman it's it's a sigh of it really is a mass sigh up and we're being under
[3:11:36.200 --> 3:11:41.400]  attack right now by china we're at war we're at war right now no that's it and the globalist
[3:11:41.400 --> 3:11:45.480]  ally with them thank you norman thank you so much for calling amazing points jack in wisconsin
[3:11:45.480 --> 3:11:50.200]  you're on the air go ahead what's up alice i have uh seven angles about coronavirus that
[3:11:50.200 --> 3:11:54.680]  no one's talk about these are just some wild conspiracy theories i believe are going on in
[3:11:54.680 --> 3:12:03.640]  regard to the novel coronavirus first it's a great opportunity to um harvest people
[3:12:03.640 --> 3:12:09.800]  and do eugenics via demo chai com social credit score based euston asia in a hospital in the
[3:12:09.800 --> 3:12:14.520]  guise of pandemic mitigation no exactly they're arresting their political opposition and you
[3:12:14.520 --> 3:12:18.680]  never asked where they went because they're already walling up buildings they're already
[3:12:18.680 --> 3:12:22.840]  shooting people at checkpoints it's a perfect cover for a clamp down on political dissidents
[3:12:22.840 --> 3:12:30.760]  secondarily it is a dirty little secret that all our pool and wastewater gets analyzed by
[3:12:30.760 --> 3:12:36.280]  super computer so i think the us knows exactly who's got the virus or coronavirus or anything for
[3:12:36.280 --> 3:12:42.280]  that matter well there is genetic testing been around for 20 years that takes your genetic
[3:12:42.280 --> 3:12:47.400]  profile with what's happening in the sewer and tested exactly that's how crazy this is anything
[3:12:47.400 --> 3:12:54.600]  else jack um tertiary i don't know if you saw the video footage from huan of the birds acting very

[3:53:37.720 --> 3:53:43.720]  magazine like it like in the world and that's why I'm mentioning here because the other thing
[3:53:43.720 --> 3:53:49.320]  that I mentioned to you earlier the big the big point here is how easily they can
[3:53:49.320 --> 3:54:05.160]  how they can declare martial law like that jerks off in Maryland and jerks off in New York
[3:54:06.120 --> 3:54:15.720]  and jerks off in other states and countries calling emergency so when things go down
[3:54:15.720 --> 3:54:23.240]  and this thing hits business is really bad remember what I said when people lose everything
[3:54:23.240 --> 3:54:28.040]  and have nothing left to lose they lose it you're going to see violence crime escalate it's going
[3:54:28.040 --> 3:54:33.000]  to give them more of a cause to clamp down on us and again the reason I said I won't fly right
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:37.720]  now is I don't want them checking up on me and making my life miserable because I hate flying
[3:54:37.720 --> 3:54:43.080]  anyway when I was a young man when I used to fly first class what would you like so lots to
[3:54:43.080 --> 3:54:49.080]  serve at all or they have a roast in their carving in front of you so I hate flying now
[3:54:49.080 --> 3:54:57.960]  anyway now I won't go but the other big one now hear this now hear this the big one the economy is
[3:54:57.960 --> 3:55:10.280]  going down they have no more cheap money to pump into the system you're going to come out with
[3:55:10.280 --> 3:55:28.600]  you're already doing it heads up don't don't you don't you dare use paper money
[3:55:31.000 --> 3:55:37.640]  no paper money you're going to spread them joins we got digital dough for you
[3:55:37.640 --> 3:55:48.760]  yeah you think things are bad and the market's going way down economy's crashing we can't bail
[3:55:48.760 --> 3:55:57.800]  you out we're out rosy but we're going to use her as an excuse to get rid of them dollars and
[3:55:57.800 --> 3:56:12.280]  them reals and those pesos no more later all gone remember they were doing this before rosy came
[3:56:12.280 --> 3:56:19.400]  around digital currencies and now they're doing it they're using it to spread the fear we've been
[3:56:19.400 --> 3:56:25.080]  writing about this in the trends journal they are going to come up with a new scheme to get rid
[3:56:25.080 --> 3:56:35.880]  of those old currencies and now you're going digital now the slimmers in the low lives that
[3:56:35.880 --> 3:56:42.680]  control our lives called president's chances prime ministers and all the way down they will
[3:56:42.680 --> 3:56:51.720]  know every penny that you're spending every penny that you're spending it's all digital
[3:56:51.720 --> 3:57:00.920]  digital currency backed by nothing and printed on nothing but we know every dime that you spent
[3:57:00.920 --> 3:57:07.640]  and we're going to get every penny in taxes from you but we give our big guys and girls a break for
[3:57:07.640 --> 3:57:19.640]  free martial law digital currency and for me i don't give financial advice my goal forecast
[3:57:19.640 --> 3:57:28.360]  match him anybody anywhere in the world i said the goal ball run began in june of 2019 june 6th
[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:34.280]  and that goal bowl is going to keep on running as i see it but you know think for yourself
[3:57:34.280 --> 3:57:50.200]  and boy you're better at girl you better do a lot of thinking for yourself now see you next week
