[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[00:13.000 --> 00:28.000]  mother tell your children not to walk my way tell your children not to hear my words what they mean what they say mother
[00:28.000 --> 00:45.000]  mother can you keep them in the dark for a while can you hide them from the wedding world mother
[00:45.000 --> 00:58.000]  it is sunday february 16th the year is 2020 i am your host alex jones we're gonna be here live for the next two hours as we are every sunday four to six p.m.
[00:58.000 --> 01:16.000]  now we are going to have max keiser in studio with us coming up in about 10 minutes to talk about the waterfront and make some major bitcoin announcements as well but he's always on fire especially when he comes through maybe once a year
[01:16.000 --> 01:31.000]  and is in studio with us so the always interesting and informative max keiser will be in studio mike adams is going to be joining us coming up in the second hour with just horrifying new corona virus developments we know the virus is killing people killing
[01:31.000 --> 01:44.000]  them in europe starting to kill people in western nations we know it's spreading very very fast and it's mutating into something even more deadly it's now being confirmed but the response the response to it is what's really
[01:44.000 --> 02:04.000]  horrifying and really frightening and the communist chinese are definitely using it to suppress and demoralize their population and to try to have a crackdown in taiwan which have been politically slipping away under their tyranny and all of it's being cast with the dictator for life g.g.
[02:04.000 --> 02:18.000]  as the saviour so that is coming up also we had steve chenicon i think the smart guy but i don't always agree with him completely he thinks bars after the president but we've got a thousand plus former justice department
[02:18.000 --> 02:35.000]  operatives saying that they want him removed and fired because they dare talk about not giving roger stona sentence that's too long well i mean if you've done nothing wrong any sentence is is too long so we're gonna be looking at the angles on that of course the really big
[02:35.000 --> 02:53.000]  announcement we've even talked about this and i totally believe drudge has sources effect i know he does and drudge doesn't put out dis info when he rarely breaks a big story it's almost always been dead on i remember speculation that hillary would join bloomberg months
[02:53.000 --> 03:10.000]  ago when he first got in or that she'd have a broker convention or they could have impeached trump then pelosi would have been the third in line they got rid of pence as well and that she would then be appointed vp by pelosi they even came out and then floated that
[03:10.000 --> 03:28.000]  a hundred percent that's what bloomberg's doing is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to shoehorn in hillary as his vp and then at some point he steps down she becomes the nominee and massive election fraud is engaged in and she is installed
[03:28.000 --> 03:44.000]  because there is a cult around this one and they've always meant to put her in power and the deep state minions that have been promised all these goodies if she ever just gets in there they are still beavering away believing in the coming of their
[03:44.000 --> 04:09.000]  messiah and believing that it is her right to rule and that she is the madame president that they can jerk victory from the jaws of defeat the big question is what type of death wish does michael bloomberg have to ever have her as his vp just a few heart beats away from the presidency she would absolutely end up killing him
[04:09.000 --> 04:26.000]  but he knows that they know that and so that's why he would only get into office and then step down making her the president this is what they have always believed in so bloomberg does not need to jump off of a cliff he does not
[04:26.000 --> 04:39.000]  need to run headlong towards the grim reaper because that's not his intention he's there to soften up trump with a bunch of propaganda spend a bunch of money to weaken the other candidates and then at the key moment he steps back
[04:39.000 --> 04:59.000]  I'm Alex Jones your host we've got some really important news on the other side trump at the Daytona 500 yes it's absolutely important and I'll explain why in my view it's sunday we're live broadcasting worldwide
[04:59.000 --> 05:17.000]  well it's finally happening the president is coming out and saying the deep state are a bunch of out of control criminals that need to be prosecuted and he has fired over 200 senior bureaucrats in the state department and the justice department in just the last few days
[05:17.000 --> 05:32.000]  and he took the head prosecutor over stone and offered her a job at treasury as soon as she quit that job he then withdrew the nomination and now she's out on her globalist ass this is beautiful it's happening but we need to see a lot more
[05:32.000 --> 05:49.000]  all the neocons need to be fired all the Obama appointees fired all the deep state globalist who have resumes with George Soros fired fired fired fired trump is finally unleashed trump is not the red wave he is the red storm
[05:49.000 --> 06:03.000]  and info wars is the tip of the spear powered by we the people never backing down never giving in and delivering victory in our time we've got it
[06:03.000 --> 06:24.000]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[06:24.000 --> 06:43.000]  there are 160 plus major nations on the face of this earth and many of those countries are larger geographically and have more resources than the united states and their populations are much greater than the united states
[06:43.000 --> 07:02.000]  by 1955 the united states was 4% of the world's population 96% lived outside the united states the united states had more than half the wealth on earth and the wealth wasn't stolen the wealth was generated
[07:02.000 --> 07:18.000]  something that people that want communism and socialism and who haven't studied history don't understand because america was a free market capitalist nation it was the destination for anyone who wanted to be set free and be successful
[07:18.000 --> 07:32.000]  and as we become incredibly powerful we become decadent our children have become decadent we become decadent their children have become decadent and we're forgetting and losing who we are the point of major polls show more than half of college students identify as communists
[07:32.000 --> 07:49.000]  our socialist and bernie sanders is the main candidate in all polls across the united states and a billionaire oligarch who made almost all his money on fiat digital fraud not real products bloomberg is coming in to the rescue
[07:49.000 --> 08:10.000]  i don't know which one of these people is worse probably bloomberg because he's so inauthentic and such a fraud now contrast that with hollywood and the mainstream media constantly telling you how much america sucks
[08:10.000 --> 08:24.000]  and telling you how much you suck and saying america was never great it will never be great they're doing that because they're globalists that are conquering the nation and vertically integrating the economy showing it up getting rid of the middle
[08:24.000 --> 08:43.000]  and putting us in debt as they devalue the currencies while the very ultra rich that claim they oppose bernie through their endowments teaching the colleges classic communism as again a way to knock out their competition and sabotage the minds of young people everywhere
[08:43.000 --> 08:59.000]  and that's a piece of collectivism now inner trump he's been called a carnival barker by hillary and by bloomberg who now we're hearing are going to be running mates probably
[08:59.000 --> 09:19.000]  it flies in we'll play this in a moment to the Daytona 500 today with a huge flight of the valkyries spectacle than he says starts your engines and f-16 jets fly over it's pageantry it's it's it's booing it's a pep rally for the nation
[09:19.000 --> 09:34.000]  celebrating the great outdoors and powerful engines and men and women risking their lives like modern gladiators racing around that track it's the opposite of the nanny state
[09:34.000 --> 09:49.000]  Michael Bloomberg is embracing all of his weaknesses he's known as the nanny state that he wants to tell you how much soda you can drink he wants to say how much salt you can have he says he knows best in a big article called the technocrat it talks about Bloomberg
[09:49.000 --> 10:07.000]  he says I do know more than everyone I will run your life and now he's in a play I'm not kidding this is coming up in a few minutes as Mary Poppins and he says I'm going to make Americans behave I'm going to become their president
[10:07.000 --> 10:30.000]  he rubs it in as he flies around like Mary Poppins folks this is not satire I'm not joking absolute total fraud he wants to demoralize you Trump wants to empower you because when you believe you can be empowered
[10:30.000 --> 10:47.000]  you will have the capability to be empowered you you will become empowered yeah the article is called the great technocrat you've got to go read it and it's an interview with him and you think it's satire he's like I'm the smartest person probably on earth and I know how to run your life
[10:47.000 --> 11:08.000]  and so we're going to set up a worldwide computer system and we will decide when you go to bed when you wake up what you eat what you do you're like is this a joke and he's like no and the article funds after him and it's 78 billion that's all just digital made up manipulation and trading all fraud he produces nothing
[11:08.000 --> 11:23.000]  he makes Bernie Madoff look like salt of the earth and Hillary's behind him and he's a shoehorn to pump money in to try to hurt the other candidates to hurt Trump to annihilate Sanders and then he steps back at the last moment of
[11:23.000 --> 11:38.000]  brother convention and in slides Hillary Rodham Clinton I told you that months ago now drudges confirm that with his high level sources and Bloomberg confirmed he goes well we have been looking at Hillary but you know maybe maybe not folks don't like it see they're
[11:38.000 --> 11:58.000]  already trial ballooning it she's been on TV more than any other candidate she's raising money so here is the video of Trump coming in trying to boost our morale so that we're not demoralized and so we have some fun and that's so
[11:58.000 --> 12:10.000]  important when people are trying to tell you you suck no we don't suck America is amazing and it was leading the world and we're going to lead the world again with ideas not with socialism we export here's the president
[12:10.000 --> 12:28.000]  as we walk in you to NASCAR on Fox and the 62nd running of the great American race along with Jeff Gordon Jamie Mcmurray I'm Chris Myers and nice to have you along with us for this special moment I have been to a lot of Daytona 500
[12:28.000 --> 12:41.000]  Chris never have I felt the excitement and energy we've had great races on the track but we've got the president landing right now the fans are pumped up I mean wow what a day it's
[12:41.000 --> 12:55.000]  it's one of the most incredible things I've ever seen Obama wouldn't do anything like this he wants Hollywood to give him awards they don't like flower country remember he got secretly recorded saying he hates the Midwest hates Bible thumpers hates gun owners better clingers their
[12:55.000 --> 13:10.000]  elitists they don't want to fly over a bunch of NASCAR fans and have energy together they don't want to have that communal event no because they're separate from us they're better than us you know I like Joe Rogan but I saw a clip the other day where he had a reporter on and
[13:10.000 --> 13:31.000]  he was they were making fun of Midwesterners talking about the fact that the pimp madam that helped Epstein kidnap kids was supposedly somewhere in the Midwest they made the joke so those Midwesters they came and read a book they don't they don't
[13:31.000 --> 13:52.000]  even know what Max well looks like Epstein's operative and again that's that attitude of how do you get so disconnected you think the majority of the country they're idiots because of where they live that's not reality based ladies and gentlemen
[13:52.000 --> 14:12.000]  that's elitism and it's just it's what the left does it's their currency it's the supposed power they have until the point they get so disconnected from reality that Bloomberg has hired people
[14:12.000 --> 14:25.000]  to put out memes and to have him do things he believes will make him popular here is the latest production of Michael Bloomberg
[14:25.000 --> 14:52.000]  I'll tell you where I'm going first Iowa then New Hampshire maybe I can get the whole country to behave by the way we cut the clip short they worship him for like a minute no these women
[14:52.000 --> 15:10.000]  and he has no idea how idiotic he is how no idea that people hate his guts no idea how ridiculous that is to then say I'm going to make the whole country behave I'm Mary Poppins America's nanny unbelievable
[15:10.000 --> 15:25.000]  let's let's go out to break with Trump and start your engines which you rather America starts your engines or I'm a little twerk I'm your nanny here's the president words and motor sports at the Daytona 500 please welcome this year's

[19:42.000 --> 20:00.000]  brilliant you've took on the very element that they tried to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapons you have the loudest sound of all silence and you know what's most disturbing to people cylinder seal
[20:01.000 --> 20:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:20.000 --> 20:26.000]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[20:31.000 --> 20:41.000]  I always get just a few hours of notice from Max Kaiser, the famous playboy and international superstar.
[20:41.000 --> 20:52.000]  TV host and BBC, RT, you name it, Al Jazeera, author, broadcaster, filmmaker, famous stockbroker, opinion trader.
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  He's also co-founder of Bitcoin Capital and presenter of Kaiser Report on RT.
[20:56.000 --> 21:01.000]  I first heard about Bitcoin from him like 10 years ago or longer, maxkaiser.com.
[21:01.000 --> 21:06.000]  And he's with us, and he wants to get into Bitcoin and global currencies and what's happening in the markets and what's happening with coronavirus.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  First, and then we're going to get into the most concerning developments with coronavirus.
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  We had a long dinner last night.
[21:13.000 --> 21:19.000]  He, myself, his significant other, Stacey Herbert and my wife, Erica, we had an in-depth discussion.
[21:19.000 --> 21:26.000]  And I concur with you about what's happening in China, that regardless of how bad the virus is, they're using it as a power grab.
[21:26.000 --> 21:33.000]  We'll look at the economy, Hillary, they're picking back with Bloomberg, what you think of the judge of the booty,
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  and just a lot of really important points.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  What you think of Bill Barr, you think Bill Barr is good, you were telling me last night.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  I hope that's the case, and that he's not undermining the president.
[21:42.000 --> 21:50.000]  Now you've got 1,100 former XDOJ officials demanding Barr resign, so maybe you're right, maybe Barr is good.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  I just want to see some major action on the whole Epstein front.
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  So it's good to have you here back in the ATX.
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  I'm glad you called in when you landed yesterday.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  I called in from the plane.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  I was styling, I'm on the tarmac.
[22:02.000 --> 22:08.000]  I'm heading into South Congress in Austin to be as hipster and trendy as possible.
[22:08.000 --> 22:14.000]  Yeah, that's right, I've come right over now, we've got some barbecue, don't stop, I've got some great barbecue right here at the headquarters.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  And we just came right over.
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  And of course that's what we do.
[22:18.000 --> 22:24.000]  Now, Bitcoin, you missed at a dollar, you missed it at $10, you missed it at $100, you missed it at $1,000.
[22:24.000 --> 22:34.000]  The good news, Alex Jones, is that Bitcoin at $10,000 or $9,300 is equally attractive as it was at $100.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  I am officially raising my target for Bitcoin and I first made this prediction when it was a dollar.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  I said this could go to $100,000.
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.000]  I'm raising my official target for the first time in eight years.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  I'm raising it to $400,000.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  That's my new official target.
[22:49.000 --> 22:52.000]  So you've got a 40X return.
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  You know, $10,000 becomes $400,000.
[22:55.000 --> 23:02.000]  And so this is yet your new chance to make Bitcoin a dominant work for you.
[23:02.000 --> 23:07.000]  So Alex Jones, and I told you over 10 years ago, I wasn't going to get into it until I thought the market stabilized.
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  I know it's a real technology.
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.000]  I know it's needed.
[23:09.000 --> 23:14.000]  I know that our government, George Washington, beat the British because of encryption.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  Encryption was once seen as an ammunition, only the NSA for a while had it.
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.000]  It's good to have it in the people's hands.
[23:20.000 --> 23:25.000]  But there's also been a wild, wild West and a lot of crap coin out there as well.
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.000]  But still, you believe Bitcoin, the original is the gold standard.
[23:28.000 --> 23:33.000]  Right, everything but Bitcoin is basically pyrite or a fool's gold.
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  There's only one Bitcoin.
[23:35.000 --> 23:36.000]  Nothing else comes close.
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  And now, a good point.
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  After 10 years, it's been accepted by the marketplace.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  It's established itself.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  And now large money's moving into this thing.
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  I was about to say, so it had its crash, but now it's going back up and the big money's going in,
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  meaning they're not planning to extinct it.
[23:50.000 --> 23:51.000]  They just wanted to take it over.
[23:51.000 --> 23:58.000]  There's no reason why it wouldn't be volatile as it makes a move from a dollar to $10,000, $20,000.
[23:58.000 --> 23:59.000]  That's extremely volatile.
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  But to get to $20,000, $100,000, and $400,000, you need the volatility.
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.000]  That's perfectly normal.
[24:04.000 --> 24:09.000]  The best solution, there's a three-pronged approach that I'm telling you about right now.
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  First of all is Cache App, which is a simple app on your phone.
[24:12.000 --> 24:15.000]  You can download this app and you can stack Satoshi.
[24:15.000 --> 24:22.000]  A Satoshi is basically, there's 100 Satoshis in every penny.
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.000]  Let's put it that way.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  So you can stack Satoshis on your Cache App.
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.000]  You can buy a dollar at a time, $5 at a time, and you can build your position.
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.000]  Number two would be if you don't want to keep your Bitcoin on that app,
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  you can download it to something called a wallet.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  And in this case, I recommend the green wallet.
[24:40.000 --> 24:41.000]  It's the best wallet.
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.000]  It's the most secure wallet.
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.000]  And if you want to play with the big boys and you want to buy $10,000, $20,000 with Bitcoin at a time,
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  then the place to go would be Kraken.
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  Kraken is established since 2011.
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  It's the best exchange, really, I think, in the world.
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  And this is where you go when you're graduating to the big time in the Bitcoin space.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  But initially, it's Cache App.
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  Just go to Cache App every single day and you buy a few dollars with the Bitcoin every single day.
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.000]  Now, what's one of these, what I like is the fact that if I can decide where it's invested or where it's kept
[25:10.000 --> 25:18.000]  in one of these, so I can actually tailor it so that I don't have this cryptocurrency somewhere where it's helping a bad guy.
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  Yeah, you can take delivery of your private keys.
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  That's the whole thing is about individual sovereignty.
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.000]  It's a whole about the Fourth Amendment.
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  You know, the Fourth Amendment guarantees privacy.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  Well, what I like is this.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  I could sit there and put money in an offshore account.
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  Everyone will make me a political prisoner and try to get out of the country to protect myself and my family.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  But those banks will work with other big banks just to take your money away.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  But things like Bitcoin absolutely just brings diversity to the marketplace of digital currencies.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  And it is something that is completely legitimate.
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.000]  It's just like the power of fire, not just being with the gods, but being given to Prometheus.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  It's unconfiscatable, which is great.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  So even a private account, those are all being cracked down upon.
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  Those are all being looked into by various governments.
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  Bitcoin is the only thing that's unconfiscatable.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  And it's the only thing where when you transact, that is the verification of that transaction.
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.000]  That's something you never find with gold. With gold, if I traded gold with you,
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  you would have to verify that the gold that I traded with you was real.
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  It wasn't tungsten or, you know, something opposing as gold.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  It was you need a third party verification with Bitcoin.
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  That's not a problem because it is it verifies itself on the blockchain.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  Well, we've got the owner of Twitter.
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.000]  You've got Eric Prince.
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  You've got all these big players, all these big governments heavily invested in Bitcoin.
[26:27.000 --> 26:33.000]  And so clearly they think down the road, it's going to end up being a continual powerful force.
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  But you've gotten my point.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  I only talk about stuff that I really understand backwards and forwards.
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  And so I've been waiting a decade believing in the technology,
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  but I just could never tell my listeners.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  I think this is the best way to go because I don't want to steer them wrong.
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  Right. Well, you know, we've we're beyond that phase now where people are asking how it works.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  No, no, I agree with you because most of the things you deal with during the day,
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  you have no idea how they work people.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  The cars are ultimately, ultimately technologically driven.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  Nobody knows how the technology and cars work.
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  Nobody knows how most of the technology they deal with all day works.
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  It's just accepted after 10 years of being up and running flawlessly.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  Now it works.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  We and we accept it and people are using it as a store of value.
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.000]  All the fly by nighters and all the people running scams that that that could have brought it down, but they didn't.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  Yeah, it withstood all the scams.
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  So all the what we call, you know, the Bitcoin cash, for example, is a scam.
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  Craig Wright is a scam.
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  These are some of the more obvious scams in the crypto space.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  This is your opinion.
[27:35.000 --> 27:36.000]  I don't really know who these guys are.
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  Right. Okay.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  This is but this is pretty well documented at this point.
[27:39.000 --> 27:46.000]  And everything, even Ethereum to a large degree, it's all the fighting in the crypto currencies.
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  But that's I don't like in fighting.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  Right. But anytime you have a revolutionary currency,
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  I mean, a lot of people are buying for attention and they're going to be changed.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  You know, I always say that you don't change Bitcoin.
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.000]  Bitcoin changes you.
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.000]  And if as long as you understand that you will allow yourself to be open up your mind to what
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  uncomfiscatable immutable centricity, persistent store of value goal 2.0 means to the world.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  It means people in Venezuela, Argentina have a way to fight back against the government.
[28:11.000 --> 28:17.000]  It means people in America have a way to fight back against the government against money printing and all this money
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  inflation and all this psycho drama happening in the finance space.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  Trump saying, hey, we're going to introduce another tax break for stock market investors to keep the bubble going.
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  That bubble at like 2008 will pop.
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.000]  And when it pops, are you going to thank goodness that you've got some Bitcoin?
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  Well, I'll say this, the global markets are obviously overvalued.
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  I know Trump's just trying to prop up the bubble because what other choices he had,
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  but it is smart to diversify.
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  We tie Bitcoin now into what's happening with the virus, what's happening with the economy,
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  what the virus is going to do, the Chinese economy, how that affects the world economy.
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  On the other side, then we'll talk about Hillary and Bloomberg kissing in a tree.
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.000]  KSSS-ING.
[28:58.000 --> 29:02.000]  Almost all the other big storeable food companies are sold out of food.
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.000]  But I know for a fact from sources to tell them people, oh, we've got it.
[29:05.000 --> 29:08.000]  Get your order in two weeks for delivery.
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  We follow this pattern over and over again.
[29:10.000 --> 29:13.000]  Already for 25 years, I've had storeable food for a long time.
[29:13.000 --> 29:17.000]  And I learned very quickly a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times.
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.000]  But during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory.
[29:21.000 --> 29:22.000]  They'll still take your orders.
[29:22.000 --> 29:27.000]  That's why about 11 years ago, I found my Patriot supply now the biggest, most trusted company out there.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  And I became a private labeler for them because they actually have it on hand.
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  They actually give it delivered to you on time.
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.000]  They do what they're going to say they're going to do because they want you as a customer over and over again.
[29:36.000 --> 29:37.000]  And they're good people.
[29:37.000 --> 29:41.000]  Now they were saying seven to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food, but they've got to package it.
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  Record level orders.
[29:42.000 --> 29:47.000]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  So get your orders in an infowarstore.com.
[29:49.000 --> 29:50.000]  Get the best deals.
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  Get it delivered first.
[29:51.000 --> 29:52.000]  They're in our system.
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  It goes right to them.
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  Then it funds the info as well.
[29:54.000 --> 29:58.000]  So get prepared infowarstore.com with storeable foods.
[29:58.000 --> 30:03.000]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election.
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.000]  And already you've seen all sorts of crazy things happen.
[30:05.000 --> 30:07.000]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy.
[30:07.000 --> 30:08.000]  They're trying to start wars.
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  They're trying to overthrow the president.
[30:10.000 --> 30:11.000]  They're trying to silence free speech.
[30:11.000 --> 30:16.000]  They're trying to trigger riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing up in their face.
[30:16.000 --> 30:22.000]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies.
[30:22.000 --> 30:25.000]  And we have to be prepared in case things go south.
[30:25.000 --> 30:32.000]  That's why it's so critical to go to infowarstore.com and stock up on high quality preparedness items from storeable foods,

[30:52.000 --> 30:55.000]  The only way we can be defeated is if you don't take action.
[30:55.000 --> 30:59.000]  Get high quality products at infowarstore.com today.
[30:59.000 --> 31:05.000]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[31:05.000 --> 31:08.000]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[31:08.000 --> 31:12.000]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people.
[31:12.000 --> 31:20.000]  And so here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[31:20.000 --> 31:25.000]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[31:25.000 --> 31:30.000]  I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this,
[31:30.000 --> 31:36.000]  they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[31:36.000 --> 31:42.000]  It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[31:42.000 --> 31:59.000]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[32:12.000 --> 32:18.000]  It's great because of God, because of the audience of activists and because of the great team at M-Full Wars.
[32:18.000 --> 32:21.000]  And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[32:21.000 --> 32:26.000]  So right now, humanity is awakening. It's explosive. It's powerful. It's incredible.
[32:26.000 --> 32:29.000]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road.
[32:29.000 --> 32:35.000]  And the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game like M-Full Wars is to the spirit is your financial support.
[32:35.000 --> 32:38.000]  We make it really easy at M-FullWarsStore.com.
[32:38.000 --> 32:47.000]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now with our reporters doing triple the work they ever have because they volunteered to do it.
[32:47.000 --> 32:52.000]  And Owen and the rest of the crew will fight 18 hours a day, 7 days a week during this election year.
[32:52.000 --> 32:56.000]  That's so critical, but they need the financing to put them in the field.
[32:56.000 --> 33:09.000]  M-FullWarsStore.com and fight for your own future.
[33:27.000 --> 33:32.000]  Max Kaiser, quite the character. Very informative.
[33:32.000 --> 33:37.000]  Eccentric, the dictionary next to the word eccentric.
[33:37.000 --> 33:41.000]  I think Cyclopedia was a picture of Max Kaiser. At least there should be.
[33:41.000 --> 33:45.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday Transmission.
[33:45.000 --> 33:52.000]  By the way, you didn't come on here to pitch Bitcoin. You don't own part of those companies you just pitched and they're not paying me.
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.000]  What happened is he was coming through connecting from another city, from another country.
[33:57.000 --> 34:03.000]  Today, let's get dinner. And then I said, listen, you're right. I should have gotten involved in Bitcoin and things a long time ago.
[34:03.000 --> 34:12.000]  Now it's settled out. Will you explain it to me? Will you take me under your wing and really walk me through it?
[34:12.000 --> 34:16.000]  And he said, yes. But he said, here's just the three basic things you need to know.
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.000]  You just start using them because it's good to diversify anyway.
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  Right into China, the economy. Obviously, I don't want the bubble to pop.
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  Neither does Trump. It's not that the bubble's a good thing. I'm totally against it.
[34:26.000 --> 34:31.000]  But clearly, they're just pumping more liquidity. They're talking about paying banks to loan now.
[34:31.000 --> 34:36.000]  The government saw it. This is crazy. It's going to get your real economic outlook here in a moment.
[34:36.000 --> 34:43.000]  But first, get back to our conversation last night and kind of, and on the drawing board in there, in my office, you were explaining to me,
[34:43.000 --> 34:49.000]  the three companies that you say are good that I should start using and getting involved in to teach myself.
[34:49.000 --> 34:54.000]  Right. And first of all, that I mentioned, my Twitter handle is now real Max Kaiser.
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.000]  Because I had a quarter of a billion followers on Max Kaiser, but I realized that I'm rebirthing myself as a maximalist in the Bitcoin space
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  for the ninth, for the 2020, the 21st century.
[35:04.000 --> 35:12.000]  So this is the trifecta of Bitcoin that anyone can basically dive in and become extremely proficient at Bitcoin.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  The first one would be the Cash App.
[35:14.000 --> 35:20.000]  So the Cash App, you can download that on your phone and you can buy miniscule amounts of Bitcoin just to get started.
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  We say in the Bitcoin space, stack satoshis or stack sats.
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  Every single day, just put a few bucks into Bitcoin.
[35:25.000 --> 35:29.000]  If it's high by some, if it's low by some, over a few months, you end up with a lot of Bitcoin.
[35:29.000 --> 35:35.000]  And a lot of people that, when they go shopping, they say, you know, I'll pass on that $4 coffee and I'll buy $4 with Bitcoin.
[35:35.000 --> 35:43.000]  They do that for a year and suddenly they got 30, 40, 50, 60, $70,000 with the Bitcoin and they didn't sacrifice for that one bit.
[35:43.000 --> 35:48.000]  So it's just a matter of accumulating Bitcoin without any effort whatsoever.
[35:48.000 --> 35:55.000]  As this price goes from the 9,000, 10,000 area up to 400,000, which is my new price target, because it's going to equal the value of gold.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  Gold worth about $7.5 trillion.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  Bitcoin at $400,000 would be worth about $7.5 trillion.
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  And that's where it's going because now it competes with gold globally and it's used as a safe haven and a store of value.
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.000]  And by the way, you were the first guy I ever heard talk about this more than 10 years ago.
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  People are going to look at the three things you mentioned. You said this last night and I went and looked them up.
[36:13.000 --> 36:17.000]  I mean, I knew what Cash App was. I knew that Jack Dorsey was invested in it.
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  Well, exactly. Folks, the ones that are going to end up being the most legitimate and the ones that have run the longest the best,
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.000]  those are going to have the establishment start investing in them.
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.000]  And then that's when I'm like, hey, now I can tell listeners and myself, time to stick the toe in.
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.000]  Sure, a lot of folks made fortunes in the Wild Wild West of all the stuff that went on the last 10 years.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  People said, Alex, why did you never get involved in it?
[36:37.000 --> 36:43.000]  Because I just, I only, look, I know when I sell somebody, you've got my super silver toothpaste.
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  Yes, I've got patented. It's super high quality.
[36:46.000 --> 36:47.000]  Super silver.
[36:47.000 --> 36:52.000]  And it knocks out viruses and bacteria and it makes your teeth incredibly clean and it re-memorizes them.
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  So I'm selling something good that I know people are going to get a great response with.
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.000]  That's why I've been promoting a colloidal silver type products for 25 years back then they weren't accepted.
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  Now they're totally accepted even by hospitals, you name it.
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  It smells like Nancy Pelosi. That's kind of an added benefit when you get this.
[37:08.000 --> 37:09.000]  It smells like death.
[37:09.000 --> 37:10.000]  Super silver toothpaste.
[37:10.000 --> 37:11.000]  It smells like a dead dog.
[37:11.000 --> 37:12.000]  No, it doesn't.
[37:12.000 --> 37:13.000]  It's like, right.
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  So, well, let me see that toothpaste.
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  Don't take my toothpaste, buddy.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  I've got it. I've got the toothpaste now.
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  You're shooting me.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  Look, that's it.
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  What's going on?
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  Oh, don't bring out the 15 caliber again.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  No, don't do it.
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  I was just trying to...
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  Just because you didn't buy Bitcoin at a dollar.
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  Don't blame me.
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  I beg you to buy Bitcoin at a dollar.
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.000]  And he said, no, it's a conspiracy from...
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  Never shoot Bitcoin.
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  I read that.
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.000]  Sorry.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  No, it's not a George Soros conspiracy, believe it or not.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  You know, not everything is a Soros conspiracy, Alex Jones.
[37:50.000 --> 37:51.000]  They're really reloading.
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  Some things are actually just what they are.
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.000]  They're good.
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  Oh, you need some more. There you go.
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.000]  Hey, let's get serious.
[37:58.000 --> 37:59.000]  I am deadly serious.
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  Let's talk global economy right now.
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  How is this virus going to affect China?
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.000]  Oh, well, the supply lines coming out of China are completely interrupted.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  So, in the case of Apple Computer, for example,
[38:12.000 --> 38:15.000]  I'm not sure how they're going to continue in their business,
[38:15.000 --> 38:18.000]  but I do have a suspicion of what they will continue to do
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.000]  is they will buy back their own stock, you know, for the last five years.
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  Apple's earnings have not really gone up much at all,
[38:25.000 --> 38:28.000]  but the stock goes up because they keep buying back their own stock,
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  which makes it look like the earnings are better than they really are.
[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  And they're able to do that by borrowing money from the central bank at 0% interest rates.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  That's one of the nefarious impacts of 0% interest rates.
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  Exactly.
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  Michael Bloomberg doesn't really make a huge money on their stock options.
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  And meanwhile, you and I are paying 19% on our credit cards.
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  That's interest rate apartheid.
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.000]  How come I live in a Bantuston where my credit card rate is 19%
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.000]  and Tim Cook gets to live on the other side of the interest rate apartheid wall,
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.000]  borrow money at 0%, buy back his own stock, which used to be illegal just a few years ago,
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  pump up his stock options and make billions of dollars.
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  How is that legal? How is that moral? How is that American?
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  So, over to you, Nalix.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  What's wrong with Tim Cook's eyes?
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  Well, he's a cyborg.
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  I think that's pretty well understood at this point.
[39:16.000 --> 39:21.000]  And I'll tell you something about Steve Jobs, which actually is not nice, so I won't.
[39:21.000 --> 39:22.000]  No, Nalix.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  He's passed away, so I won't tell the ugly truth about Steve Jobs.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  I'd rather talk about the future.
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  After Cash App, the thing you got to keep in mind is Green Wallet.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  Because let's say you don't like Jack Dorsey.
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.000]  Let's say you're like, oh, Jack Dorsey is a censoring social media clown,
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  and I don't want anything to do with him.
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  I don't care, he's got a great app called Cash App.
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  Well, he does have a great app called Cash App,
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  and you can buy Bitcoin really easily, and you can do it every single day.
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  If you don't want to keep it on Cash App, you can move it to something called Green Wallet.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  Green Wallet is the best Bitcoin Wallet on the market today.
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  That's what I was going to say though about you.
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  It's called Green Wallet.
[39:57.000 --> 39:58.000]  Download Green Wallet now.
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  Download Green Wallet now.
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  That's enough.
[40:01.000 --> 40:09.000]  We already have problems with PayPal kicking journalists and people off of it, myself included.
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  Yes.
[40:10.000 --> 40:17.000]  That's another reason about the head of Twitter, he's buying up all of the internet processing banks
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  and then censoring people.
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  These dudes are real jerks, man.
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.000]  Yeah, they come under a lot of pressure from governments to do all kinds of things that are anti-constitutional.
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.000]  But, nevertheless, for the newbie, the newb out there who just wants people to ask me all the time,
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  how do I get into Bitcoin?
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.000]  This is the easiest way to do it.
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  It just happens to be the easiest way.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  Once you secure your coin...
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  No, you're right.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  We have to fund the revolution by making it no mainstream.
[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  That's what revolutions are supposed to do is succeed.
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  Exactly right.
[40:42.000 --> 40:49.000]  And, you know, this revolution is going to be successful because the regulators who are in position to try to stop this revolution,
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  when they start buying Bitcoin, then the revolution is won.
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  Because the regulators get paid in fiat money dollars.
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  And those in fiat money dollars are becoming increasingly worthless.
[40:58.000 --> 41:03.000]  So as they reject fiat money and take Bitcoin themselves and the cops join the revolution, then we win.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.000]  And that's happening now.
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  A lot of regulators are quitting their jobs as regulators and joining Bitcoin startups,
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  because they know that this thing is unstoppable.
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  It's uncomfiscatable.
[41:12.000 --> 41:13.000]  It's immutable.
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  It's the goal 2.0.
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  Every single other coin out there is garbage when you compare it to Bitcoin.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  And that's how we are running this revolution.
[41:21.000 --> 41:26.000]  Now, third point, Alex Jones, is that if you start to get $10,000 in your account
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  and you want to join a higher echelon of traders, you go to Kraken.
[41:30.000 --> 41:33.000]  Kraken is the number one exchange in the world.
[41:33.000 --> 41:39.000]  It was started in 2011 by Jesse Powell, who's one of the most fantastic people in the Bitcoin space.
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  He told the New York regulators to go pound sand,
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  because they tried to over-regulate him with New York's BitLicense.
[41:46.000 --> 41:47.000]  He said, you know what?
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  I'm not even going to do business in New York, so they can't do business in New York,
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  but they do it every other state, except New York and Washington state.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  But every other state you can buy on Kraken is the best exchange in the world.
[41:57.000 --> 42:00.000]  This is how you expand your Bitcoin empire.
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  So the three steps, cash app, green wallet, Kraken.
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.000]  That's the trifecta, the holy trinity of Bitcoin individual sovereignty
[42:09.000 --> 42:15.000]  to take yourself out of the matrix and to own your own future and respect the Constitution.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  By the way, we went out to dinner last night.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  He wasn't even going to come on the show, but he said,
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  if I do, I only talk Bitcoin now. Everything is Bitcoin.
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.000]  As you can see, I'm reborn as real Max Kaiser on Twitter.
[42:27.000 --> 42:32.000]  I've abandoned the old Max Kaiser because even on the old Max Kaiser on Twitter,
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  I mentioned other things than Bitcoin.
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.000]  I'm now just pure Bitcoin, real Max Kaiser on Twitter.
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  I'm a purist, I'm a maximalist, and we're going to $400,000 on Bitcoin.
[42:42.000 --> 42:43.000]  All right, let's get...
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.000]  Okay, okay.
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  I really want to cover the waterfront, Abinadi, Hillary, and Bloomberg,
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  the virus, China, the global economy with you when we come back.
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  And then Mike Adams is going to be here next hour.
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  Max Kaiser is with us. Stay with us.
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  Whoever's got them, release them.
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.000]  It's about Hillary committing a crime, not who has the emails, don't change the subject.
[43:32.000 --> 43:35.000]  Well, Julian Assange undoubtedly took Trump over the top.
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  The WikiLeaks exposed the deep state.
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  The man is a hero.
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  Daniel Ellsberg was a hero.
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.000]  Well, Assange is even a bigger hero, and he's rotting in solitary confinement,
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  and the court hearings can barely talk.
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  President Trump do the right thing and asked the British to release Julian Assange
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  and give him a medal.
[43:52.000 --> 43:55.000]  President Trump, you must release Julian Assange.
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  Free Julian Assange.
[43:57.000 --> 44:24.000]  Thank you very much.
[44:27.000 --> 44:33.000]  Just like the loving kiss of a king cobra pumping deadly, I mean loving,
[44:33.000 --> 44:36.000]  helpful nutrients in their body.
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.000]  Hug the cobra. Love the cobra. Kiss the cobra.
[44:41.000 --> 44:49.000]  But never, never go to Infowars.com or Infowarsstore.com.
[44:49.000 --> 44:59.000]  Do not order those products. Silence Jones.
[44:59.000 --> 45:04.000]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate Infowars,
[45:04.000 --> 45:11.000]  it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[45:11.000 --> 45:16.000]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans
[45:16.000 --> 45:20.000]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[45:20.000 --> 45:25.000]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side,
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  and they do what they do because they're slaves,
[45:31.000 --> 45:36.000]  because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves,
[45:41.000 --> 45:46.000]  but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[45:49.000 --> 45:52.000]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  They fear the fact that we love God,
[45:55.000 --> 46:00.000]  and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[46:00.000 --> 46:05.000]  Three weeks ago, we told you that the Pentagon had set up secret quarantine centers
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  for the coronavirus and that they believed it was much more serious than we were being told.
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  Now we know that that is the case.
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.000]  And we know the federal government and major corporations have been buying up
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  all the major storable food supplies around the country.
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  Almost everyone else is sold out.
[46:19.000 --> 46:26.000]  But our supplier, my patriot, m4warstore.com, still has their entire line of high-quality fresh food.
[46:26.000 --> 46:27.000]  And it's fresh.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  That's why you have to wait 10 to 14 days for it to get delivered,
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.000]  not because they don't have the food, but because they've got to package it
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  and their factories are going 24 hours a day.
[46:36.000 --> 46:41.000]  High-quality fresh food, the best package systems, tastes great, protects you and your family,
[46:41.000 --> 46:42.000]  and funds the m4war.
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.000]  You just got to get the orders in until they extend it out even more, which could happen.
[46:47.000 --> 47:10.000]  Lock in your orders now and sure you get it at m4warstore.com today.
[47:18.000 --> 47:23.000]  By the way, when you see his shows on RT, BBC, Al Jazeera, it's so professional.
[47:23.000 --> 47:24.000]  Totally.
[47:24.000 --> 47:27.000]  He comes on my show to misbehave.
[47:27.000 --> 47:28.000]  By the way, we were having...
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.000]  It's weird. It's awesome. Keep it weird. Keep it weird, Austin.
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  That's the brand from Austin.
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.000]  We were having a Nerf gun battle earlier.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  But you should let me have one.
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  So I came back in here. I have two. You have none.
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  That's how Communist China works or an authoritarian state.
[47:45.000 --> 47:48.000]  I have the guns and you don't have anything.
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.000]  I have super silver toothpaste, which is as powerful as all your weaponry
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  in fighting the battle against cavities.
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  Super silver toothpaste.
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  It's made with something similar to silver and it looks really cool.
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.000]  And if you use it, a lot of women will stop you on the street and say,
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  hi, I'd like to marry you.
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  Super silver toothpaste. It's for winners.
[48:09.000 --> 48:13.000]  Available at m4warstore.com. Still at 50% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.000]  50% off. That's an incredible deal.
[48:16.000 --> 48:17.000]  It is actually a real deal.
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  You know, speaking of Bitcoin, if you can buy it with Bitcoin,
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  that's an excellent way to use your Bitcoin.
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.000]  Yes.
[48:24.000 --> 48:25.000]  You are an enemy of the state.
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  Right. OK, great. No problem.
[48:27.000 --> 48:28.000]  That's fine.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  I get all the guns. You get nothing.
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.000]  I still have my Bitcoin to keep me safe
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  from unreasonable search-and-serve seizure in the Fourth Amendment
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  and the First Amendment and the Second Amendment.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  Don't you feel safer in a country where the government has the guns?
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  No. No, Alex, I don't.
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  I feel safer in a country that has a reserve currency of Bitcoin.
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.000]  Tell me you love Gigi Payne.
[48:49.000 --> 48:50.000]  That would mean the safest currency.
[48:50.000 --> 48:51.000]  Tell me, are you hearing something scary?
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  He just pointed at my jewels.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  You're pointing those nerf guns at my top.
[48:55.000 --> 48:56.000]  This is fully powered up right now.
[48:56.000 --> 48:57.000]  At my twang twang.
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  Do you know what that means?
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.000]  One wrong move, buddy. One wrong move.
[49:01.000 --> 49:02.000]  Wow. That's power.
[49:02.000 --> 49:03.000]  See that?
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  That is power.
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  See that?
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  That's awesome.
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  Right in the lens. One wrong move.
[49:09.000 --> 49:10.000]  Now.
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  Your aim is getting better.
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  You tell me you love Hillary right now.
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  How would you like me to set flame to all of your food for a decade?
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  The super food.
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  It's a whole pyramid of super food.
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  How about a bullet?
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.000]  Set it on fire.
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  Back to Camera 7, please.
[49:27.000 --> 49:35.000]  Ha! Ha! Ha!
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  This is fun.
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  I'll tell you what.
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  Ultimate fish oil.
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  You actually live in America.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  The citizens have guns as well as the government.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  Reduce your cholesterol levels.
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  Here you go.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  Quickly.
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  And that's what you need in a super fish oil.
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  Why sit down to a plate of 50 pounds of cod when you can just pop one of these tablets
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  and get the same benefit?
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  It's super fish oil.
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.000]  Ultimate fish oil.
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  Today a special deal.
[49:57.000 --> 50:03.000]  Super silver special toothpaste and fish oil for 89.7% off.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  If you pay in Bitcoin, we'll pay you $500 back.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  Let me ask you a question.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  Why do you act like this on my show?
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  You're such a professional.
[50:12.000 --> 50:13.000]  Hillary's laughing right now.
[50:13.000 --> 50:18.000]  You do such a perfect job on your own international program that airs in 100-something countries.
[50:18.000 --> 50:19.000]  There's 100 countries.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  30 million people a week watch Kaiser Report.
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  And it's now seen.
[50:22.000 --> 50:23.000]  It's dubbed into Spanish.
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  And those shows are seen even more widely than our English-speaking Kaiser Report.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  But you don't act like a clown on those shows.
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  Well, that's because I'm in Austin, Texas.
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  And in Austin, Texas, you've got to keep it weird.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  I respond to my environment.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  I'm a human being, I'm an organic being.
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  This broadcast comes out of Austin.
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  We're not in Austin.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  We are freaking in Austin.
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  We are not in Austin.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  You're going to give it an address right now if you want to send your love note.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  This is a small part of Texas.
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  Right.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  A little reservation of Texas here.
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  Right.
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  When they push the Native Americans back, they've got little areas.
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  My offices is still Texas.
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  Really?
[50:55.000 --> 51:00.000]  I thought that your offices were like the Vatican, the City of London, and Washington, D.C.
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.000]  It's its own nation state with its own police force and its own set of rules.
[51:04.000 --> 51:08.000]  I thought, here, that was the case.
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  Wow.
[51:09.000 --> 51:12.000]  I think the globalists have lost the anti-gun battle.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  That's like the old Norelco Shaver ads.
[51:14.000 --> 51:15.000]  The kids are playing with stuff like this.
[51:15.000 --> 51:16.000]  Remember the Christmas?
[51:16.000 --> 51:23.000]  The Norelco Shaver ads were like Santa Claus was skiing down your face as an electric shaver.
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  We have a massive luster ship that really wants to get serious.
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  Give me, stop it.
[51:28.000 --> 51:32.000]  This fish oil product is great, but when I was a kid, we just sniffed glue.
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  That was 15 cents.
[51:34.000 --> 51:35.000]  Look what it did to you.
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.000]  It had to work, right?
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.000]  I didn't have any ill effects because of it.
[51:39.000 --> 51:40.000]  It's 15 cents.
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  It's good for the whole day.
[51:42.000 --> 51:52.000]  Give me three minutes serious on the global bubble and what do you think it will pop and how long can they keep it pumped up?
[51:52.000 --> 51:58.000]  Well, it all depends on how expansive these central banks will get in buying back a lot of this junk.
[51:58.000 --> 52:04.000]  So the central banks have in America, I think it's four and a half trillion worth of bad debts on their balance sheets.
[52:04.000 --> 52:09.000]  The ECB now has a similar quantity of bad debts.
[52:09.000 --> 52:13.000]  And so they have to keep coordinating and Bank of Japan similarly.
[52:13.000 --> 52:26.000]  They have to coordinate this asset purchases or quantitative easing where all of the mistakes made by the globalists or Tim Cook or Jeff Bezos or whomever are purchased from them for treasury bills.
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  And they get to wash their sins.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  It's a huge money laundering operation at the central banks.
[52:30.000 --> 52:36.000]  And as long as they interest rates are zero, there's no cost to them because they're borrowing costs are zero.
[52:36.000 --> 52:50.000]  So I think the question with the coronavirus to bring it back to that, the question always with the coronavirus is, is it going to be more disruptive than the central banks ability to paper it over with more money printing?
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  That's the only question.
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.000]  So far with the coronavirus stock markets have gone up.
[52:54.000 --> 52:57.000]  So they've said the central banks have said, you know what, this is a disaster.
[52:57.000 --> 52:58.000]  This is a catastrophe.
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  All supply lines are going to be interrupted.
[53:01.000 --> 53:07.000]  So what we need to do is we need to print more money, the paper over the mistake and all that money goes directly into the stock market.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  It doesn't go into the real economy.
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  And you know how we know that?
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  Look at one very simple chart.
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  It's called the money velocity chart.
[53:14.000 --> 53:17.000]  And it shows you how fast the money is circulating through the economy.
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  It's hitting new all time lows.
[53:19.000 --> 53:31.000]  Even though the money supply M1, M2, M3 are skyrocketing, it doesn't circulate because it just goes directly into the pockets of the financiers and hedge funds and people in New York buying $200 million apartments.
[53:31.000 --> 53:32.000]  So that's why you have...
[53:32.000 --> 53:36.000]  Which then generates inflation in the real economy for the average Joe.
[53:36.000 --> 53:40.000]  Well, what it does is it distorts all the economic signals.
[53:40.000 --> 53:46.000]  So you have health care going up 100 percent, education costs going up 100 percent, but the economists in Washington saying there's no inflation.
[53:46.000 --> 53:53.000]  And the reason they can say there's no inflation is because they don't count those things in their calculation for inflation so that they get the central banks to print more money.
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.000]  They don't count luxury goods.
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.000]  No, they don't.
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  They don't count housing.
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.000]  They don't count health care.
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  Let's expand on this.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  Let's expand on this.
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  Okay, let's expand on this.
[54:01.000 --> 54:04.000]  And then the universities teach communism is the answer.
[54:04.000 --> 54:08.000]  And they point at somebody who most their assets is in fiat.
[54:08.000 --> 54:12.000]  I mean, obviously Jeff Bezos couldn't even spend three or four million dollars of his money.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  It would end up crashing his stock.
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.000]  So he's not really worth 160 million dollars in reality.
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  It's a bunch of fiat crap that would make Bernie Madoff blush.
[54:21.000 --> 54:25.000]  But then the average student looks at that and thinks there's really all this money out there.
[54:25.000 --> 54:37.000]  Well, what do they teach in university would be under the topic of Keynesianism or essentially planned economic models where economists get together and they plan the economy for the betterment of all.
[54:37.000 --> 54:38.000]  That's a work.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  That's not a model that ever worked really.
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  You could say socialism.
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  We don't really have capitalism right now.
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.000]  We have crony capitalism.
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  And the problem is that we don't have sound money.
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.000]  We don't have gold.
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  Certainly is not a standard for our money anymore.
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  Bitcoin could be because it is hard money like gold.
[54:54.000 --> 54:58.000]  But that's not a that's not a unit of account America either for transactions.
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  We have fiat money and fiat money is easily printed.
[55:01.000 --> 55:07.000]  And then we have a bunch of plutocrats and kleptocrats who keep changing the laws to make it easier to commit fraud.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  Because they have the first use of the money, which then makes them kinch.
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.000]  They can't tell in effect.
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.000]  That's right.
[55:12.000 --> 55:18.000]  That's why all the zip codes around Washington and around the central bank are very rich because they are the ones who see the money first.
[55:18.000 --> 55:24.000]  They buy stuff that goes up in price like a rare painting, you know, a ski chalet.
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  And these things are part of the assets that go up as they print money.
[55:27.000 --> 55:36.000]  And by the time it reaches mom and pop store owner in the middle of the country, it's lost all of its ability to generate any kind of genuine income improvement.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  Why is there such an east coast, west coast?
[55:38.000 --> 55:45.000]  There's all the people there, but you just average people are run into those literally think Midwesterners or Texans or people in the southwest are idiots.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  And they make fun of us and laugh at everybody.
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  And it's not even true what they say.
[55:50.000 --> 55:58.000]  Well, because if you are on the east coast in New York and you're around Wall Street, you have the hand on the button that prints the money.
[55:58.000 --> 56:06.000]  And you make it easier for your own conscious if you vilify or dehumanize people and saying they're less than human.
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  They're saying I'm printing lots of money for my own benefit and I'm destroying the American economy.
[56:10.000 --> 56:16.000]  And the way that I can go to sleep at night is to say people in the Midwest are deplorables like Hillary Clinton would say.
[56:16.000 --> 56:24.000]  Essentially, that's a slippery slope to dehumanization or scapegoating of people, which of course didn't work out in the 30s did in 1930s.
[56:24.000 --> 56:30.000]  You had a massive dehumanization scapegoating of an entire ethnic group and that led to catastrophe.
[56:30.000 --> 56:37.000]  But we see the same thing happening in America now where the people who are printing the money are treating everybody else as less than human.
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  And that is a slippery slope to a political catastrophe.
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.000]  Well, I think we're down the slope now where they're saying attack Trump supporters everywhere.
[56:45.000 --> 56:49.000]  And it doesn't even get covered in the news when they run people over with vans, you name it.
[56:49.000 --> 56:53.000]  Right. Well, Trump is, I think, represents Americana.
[56:53.000 --> 57:02.000]  Trump is as American as Apple Pie and, you know, while Bill Hickok, you know, he's an American icon and that's where he comes from.
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.000]  And people don't want, people want to think that if I'm American, I'm more like America Obama.
[57:07.000 --> 57:12.000]  He's a very smooth talking European diplomat. He'd do great in Europe as a diplomat.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  He's not an American political figure.
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  Exactly. Super slick Harvard dudes in $5,000 suits that are on private jets. That's not America.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  That's why Pete Buttigieg is not American either.
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.000]  He's just sent in their power, shoot it in like a new white Barack Obama.
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.000]  They try to disrupt things on behalf of the McKinsey's and the consultants and the plutocrats and the club.
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.000]  Now we're getting the real smart Max Kaiser here.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  We're going to come back with two more segments ahead of Mike Adams.
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  Let's have you look at the races, look at Hillary and Bloomberg, all of it hour two.
[57:42.000 --> 57:48.000]  And Max Kaiser is now here. Max Kaiser is here.
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.000]  Almost all the other big storeable food companies are sold out of food.
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.000]  But I know for a fact from sources to tell them people, oh, we've got it. Get your order in.
[57:56.000 --> 57:59.000]  Two weeks for delivery. We follow this pattern over and over again.
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.000]  I've been on radio for 25 years. I've had storeable food for a long time.
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.000]  And I learned very quickly a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times.
[58:07.000 --> 58:11.000]  But during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory.
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.000]  They'll still take your orders. That's why about 11 years ago, I found my Patriot supply.
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.000]  Now the biggest, most trusted company out there, and I became a private labeler for them,
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  because they actually have it on hand. They actually give it delivered to you on time.
[58:22.000 --> 58:26.000]  They do what they're going to say they're going to do because they want you as a customer over and over again.
[58:26.000 --> 58:27.000]  And they're good people.
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.000]  Now they were saying seven to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food,
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  but they've got to package it record level orders.
[58:32.000 --> 58:37.000]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.000]  So get your orders at an info store.com. Get the best deals, get it delivered first.
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  They're in our system. It goes right to them.
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  Then it funds the M4 as well. So get prepared.
[58:45.000 --> 58:50.000]  info-war-store.com with Swarble Foods.
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  All right, folks, here's the bad news.
[58:52.000 --> 58:57.000]  We've already sold out of the 16-ounce immune gargle with the patented nano-tech silver
[58:57.000 --> 59:01.000]  that's documented to knock out viruses and bacteria unlike anything else.
[59:01.000 --> 59:05.000]  But we do still have it in the 3-ounce and the 1-ounce for limited time.
[59:05.000 --> 59:11.000]  The good news is we have the super blue toothpaste and the super silver toothpaste,
[59:11.000 --> 59:14.000]  both that have the nano silver in them as well.
[59:14.000 --> 59:19.000]  The super blue has tea tree that's also antiviral and antibacterial and high-quality iodine.
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  And then of course the whitening has the nano silver,
[59:22.000 --> 59:27.000]  but on top of that it has the above-secral calcium that remelamorizes the teeth.
[59:27.000 --> 59:30.000]  And so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find, period.
[59:30.000 --> 59:33.000]  It has the nano silver and we still have supplies of it,
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  though it'll sell out at current rates in about two weeks.
[59:35.000 --> 59:40.000]  But despite that, I'm keeping it at sale at 50% off so everybody can protect themselves,
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  with this high-quality product.
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  You'll never use it before. Get yours today.
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  Infowarsstore.com
[59:46.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  Alright, next guys are here.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  He's very informative, very entertaining.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  They got really serious the last three or four minutes.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  I did. I was super serious what happened.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  You know what it was? It was that potato soup.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  I had some of that cold-storage potato soup good for 50 years and it just gave me clarity.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  Suddenly I could see things clearly for the first time in over three hours.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Well, you know, actually governments are buying up all the storable food.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  Most places are already sold out and we're selling more storable food than ever because of the coronavirus.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  And I just say it's good to have storable food to be prepared for whatever's coming in the future.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  And I think Trump is trying to prop things up because he inherited this mess.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  But if the economy goes down, that's when people really do need the storable food and it funds their operation.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  You know, I just want to say that you got de-platformed because Rachel Maddow at NBC and MSNBC realized
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  that your audience was huge, their audience was dying.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  So she's the new Alex Jones on MSNBC and they had to de-platform you.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  That was a coup by the corporation's mainstream media.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  It's shocking. You should be back in full regalia on every channel as you were.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  The fact that you've been de-platformed is a heinous miscarriage of media injustice.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Well, we were definitely way more popular than them, but that's not saying that they were collapsing.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  They were collapsing. Now Rachel Maddow is this raging lunatic who is trying to do you.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  She's trying to do your act, essentially your Alex Jones, but she can't do it and she's failing at it.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  And she went down the Russia Gate hoax, the Ukraine Gate hoax, the impeachment hoax,
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  and they keep her on the air even though she's a pale version of Alex Jones.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Just go home already. Fire yourself. You're a disgrace.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  Not you, of course, Rachel Maddow.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  Well, I'm not gay, but he's a good-looking man.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  Rachel Maddow is Nancy Pelosi's intimate partner, and when they get down with some ultimate fish oil,
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  it's a beautiful thing, and not even AOC can stay away from that union.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  It's like a threesome of socialism.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  All right, Max Kaiser. Max, this is a shorter segment, long segment coming up.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  Let me just ask you a question. Getting back into the economy.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  Yes.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  As you said, the country is very divided, but Trump is winning.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  If Trump hadn't gotten in, what would you expect to happen to the economy?
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  We would be at war with Russia because Hillary is a Russifobe, and she's a bigot,
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  and she's a racist, and she's an anti-Semite.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  A level of racial hatred towards Slavic people.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  She's a Russifobe, and she would be killing Russians because she's a psychopath,
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  and that would be the first effect of a Hillary president.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Where does that come from? It doesn't really exist only in the minds of some conspiracy theorists
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  because there's no reason to have this antipathy toward Russia.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  Russia is out there trying to do business like everybody else.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  It's not undermining anyone's elections.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  It's a country that we could have an amazing relationship with to help.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  Bill Maher, Friday night, said Roger Stone was convicted for giving the leaks to the Russians.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  No one's ever even said that.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  I think that's even backwards if you believe the lie. It's just pure crap.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  Julian Assange is also somebody that, if we had a functioning constitution here in America,
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  would be somehow rescued from being tortured by UK regulators who are sadistic, torturing maniacs.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  Same thing with Edward Snowden.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  Edward Snowden basically brought clarity.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  He told Americans what was really happening behind the scenes as we should know.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  We should have transparency. He is essentially performing a vital function for democracy.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  He also is an American hero.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  And it's just not right that this mainstream media, Rachel Maddow, CNN, MSNBC, my old friend Alec Baldwin,
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  who I had a friendship for 30 years, the second Trump won, he immediately disowned me,
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  would never talk to me again and started sending me emails like he's going to report me to the FBI
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  because my show is an RT, even though he's been on my show many times with Russell Brandt and others.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  So this is the level of psycho war that is being perpetrated on these poor victims, these poor Americans,
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  these people that are being turned into bigots, racists, and anti-Semites.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  Well, you told me you were there at the big after party thing for Saturday Night Live
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  and that they were just crying the night that Trump won.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  Yeah, they were in a puddle of tears when Hillary lost.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  We're going to break back in 60 seconds. Let's talk about Hillary and that story.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  Well, it's finally happening. The president is coming out and saying the deep state are a bunch of out-of-control criminals
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  that need to be prosecuted and he has fired over 200 senior bureaucrats in the State Department
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  and the Justice Department in just the last few days.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  And he took the head prosecutor over Stone and offered her a job at Treasury. As soon as she quit that job,
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  he then withdrew the nomination and now she's out on her globalist ass.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  This is beautiful. It's happening, but we need to see a lot more.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  All the neocons need to be fired. All the Obama appointees fired.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  All the deep state globalists who have resumes with George Soros fired, fired, fired, fired.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  Trump is finally unleashed. Trump is not the red wave. He is the red storm.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  An info wars is the tip of the spear powered by we the people, never backing down,
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  never giving in and delivering victory in our time.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:15.000]  All right, we were just talking about the night that Trump won 2016.
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  You were there amongst all the leftist and Alec Baldwin, the rest of them.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  They were just crying. It was at the end of the world it just happened.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  It was awful. Like Alec Baldwin I've known for 30 years and then suddenly Hillary lost and Trump won
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  and he doesn't recognize that Trump is an American archetype.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  He won fair and square and the Constitution didn't disappear.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  But he suddenly lashed out and he disowned a lot of people myself.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  He disowned his brother Stephen. Stephen Baldwin and I did a show called
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  The Great American Pilgrimage and the point of the show is to make fun of Alec Baldwin for the entire series
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  and to just travel around America and poke fun at Alec for being such a crybaby and a sore loser.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  And so we made a show and we didn't get into it to that extent, sadly,
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  but that was the premise of The Great American Pilgrimage with Stephen Baldwin was to make fun of Alec Baldwin
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  for 16 episodes as we drove across the country, which was kind of how I got that going on the air.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  Let's talk about Hillary and Bloomberg. Obviously, we were talking about this last night.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  It's well known that he's doing this for her to position himself so that at the broker convention
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  he like steps down and she goes forward where he becomes president and he steps down.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  She becomes president. They even said that they could have impeached Trump and Pence.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  They were going to have Pelosi as president and then she would put Hillary in as VP
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  and then she would step down. They're openly saying this constantly.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  She really still thinks she's going to run. Talk about tone deaf. Talk about this connected from reality.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  Well, Michael Bloomberg is essentially a Republican. So I don't know why he's representing the Democratic Party.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  Number one, number two, this idea that the Democrats have been shown to be so dysfunctional
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  where you have the leading guys leading the pack is Bernie Sanders who's at war with billionaires
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  who's on a platform of socialism.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  So the DNC power shoots in, changes all their laws to bring in another billionaire from New York
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  to go to battle with another billionaire from New York as if the end result of that won't be benefits to billionaires in New York.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  Obviously, all the billionaires in New York are going to cheer Mike Bloomberg-Trump contest
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  because they're going to be working in their interest.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  But the DNC is so obviously corrupt, so obviously undermined by the interest of big money.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  And Hillary Clinton is such a toxic loser and such a nefarious influence on this entire party
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  that she's literally going to put them into political cold storage for a generation or two.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  But they're so delusional they still think it's her right to rule.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  There's this cult of Hillary Clinton using the Epstein blackmail to still control people.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  She has a sense of entitlement that was her turn.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  And what's amazing is that what we saw with Hillary's loss is what she would have been as a president.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  So she's a conniving, backstabbing, sore loser.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  And usually when people lose, even Al Gore went away gracefully.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  He didn't stick around crying and trying to undermine the entire political process.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  In America, we don't like sore losers.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  If you go into battle and you lose, you walk away from the battlefield and you don't cry about it.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  She just reinforces all the negative stereotypes about having a woman leader.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  She's setting women's rights back 20 or 30 years because she's failing to accept responsibility for her own actions.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  That was fake news when Newsweek said she was Madam President.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  Yeah, and Nancy Pelosi is doing no great favor to women's movement either.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  I mean, she's not, you know, she doesn't respect the rule of law, the Constitution.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  What do you think is going on with Bloomberg?
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  Because he's been putting memes out that either make Trump look good or make Bloomberg look like an idiot.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  And now he's starring in a Mary Poppins play.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  Let's cue that up.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  This is not a joke for radio listeners. TV viewers will actually see it.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  And we played it last hour, guys. You guys cut the front off.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  Play it with the women cheering like he's God.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  And then he comes in and says, I'll make Americans behave when, of course, the big joke is he's the nanny.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  The full video is on NewsWars.com. Cringe Internet mocks Mike Bloomberg in bizarre stage play performance as Mary Poppins,
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  the nanny mayor of New York. Here it is.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  There he is.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  I'll tell you where I'm going.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  First, Iowa, then New Hampshire.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  Maybe I can get the whole country to behave.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  I mean, is this a joke?
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  He's got a hook on his back.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  He's flying around being worshiped by leftists.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  And these weird leftists are always into weird, like 1930s style plays.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  And they act and behave like ventriloquist dolls.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  And then he's like shaking dogs' faces.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  And then he came to Texas and tried to talk in a Texas accent.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  And they have experts writing him like, sir, if you talk like this, they'll think you're a Texan.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  And then this Mary Poppins crap.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  I mean, he may be a space alien.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  Look, this is all about unconscious marketing.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  You know what Fort Chan is, right?
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  Fort Chan is kind of a, you know, a collective of young hacker-minded malcontents who there's no censorship.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  No censorship whatsoever.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  They came up with Pepe the Frog.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  Hillary Clinton was convinced that Pepe the Frog was-
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  Was a major enemy.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  Was a major enemy and represented Nazism.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  And she started quoting Pepe the Frog.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  And that was part of her downfall in 2016.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  And now they've got Rofis being in and the OK sign.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  Fort Chan, stop it.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  They're going to ban the alphabet.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  So what I think, I think Mike Bloomberg is going to Fort Chan.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  He sees the wackiest memes over there.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  And he says, well, this is the way you get elected.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  You have to take the Fort Chan wackiest memes out there because somehow they hit everyone on a-
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  But he doesn't get how to do it.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  He has advisors because he has a billion dollars.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  So he gets to the advisors and they get into a room and they say, how are we going to win this thing?
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  And they say, well, we know that the American public is susceptible to Fort Chan memes.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  So let's go to Fort Chan, see what kind of memes they're generating about you.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  And use that as our campaign because for some reason that works.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  And meanwhile, on Facebook, Twitter, Google, they're banning anybody who's pro-Trump saying,
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  you're not allowed to have memes, but then Bloomberg could dump hundreds of millions on them.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  Right. This is meme warfare.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  It looks crazy and psychotic, but it's attacking people on their unconscious level and softening them up as a form of meme torture.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  So when they go into the voting booth, they feel like Stockholm syndrome.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  They fall in love with their captor.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  They feel enslaved by these awful weaponized memes and they end up voting for Mike Bloomberg.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  But see, it's not working because I've been looking at these memes and they don't make sense.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  They're not supposed to make sense.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  They're supposed to disrupt your unconscious mind so that you feel enslaved to your master meme, the meme master.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  And it works. It worked against Hillary to some degree. She fell for it.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  She was tailor made to fall into it because she was late to the party.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  Mike Bloomberg, because he's also a media savvy guy, he has Bloomberg as a media empire.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  He understands the power of memes.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  He understands the power of Fort Chan and eight Chan and all those spin-offs of these things.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  Yeah, the user red one. I like that made me really like Trump more actually.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  Well, the memes are powerful on the unconscious level. So you don't know how they're going to impact people's behavior.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  Mostly it's very disruptive and you are in a place of where it's a very topsy-turvy and what you thought.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  It's the same thing in the stock market. The worse the coronavirus gets, the better for the stock market.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  Because the worse it gets, the more money printing will have from the central banks that goes right into the stock market.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  So you actually want the coronavirus to be as deadly as possible.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  That's no thing. War is the health of the state.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Yeah, exactly. It adds more free money to the top two or three percent that own most of the stocks.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  And then fund socialist ideas to further consolidate control but actually building a group of people that will tear them limb from limb.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  It's not socialism. It's neo-futilism. Let me explain.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  Neo-futilistic capitalism.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  Yeah, let me explain. So only when you have a wealth gap like we do now, it's really a feudalistic model.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  Where not just most of the wealth is in a few hands, it's all of the wealth.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  And we are essentially serfs.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  You know, you were used to peasant uprisings in places like Venezuela.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  There's like a peasant uprising in France called the Gilles Jean.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  In America, AOC and the Democrats and Bernie Sanders, this is a peasant uprising against an entrenched plutocracy.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  But the entrenched plutocracy is actually funding the old communist model as the resistance knowing it's going to fail.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  When they're all posing as Black Lives Matter supporters, Jeff Bezos and people, they're actually funding Bernie.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  Sanders, his strength would be is to recognize that this is a peasant revolt.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  And we in America that are being victimized by the opiate industry, the healthcare plutocrats, the banking cartel,
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  are drifting into neofedalism.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  And he should say, look, we are drifting into neofedalism.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  We are emerging as a peasant class, just like the peasant classes.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  They're getting rid of the middle class on purpose.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  Completely. Absolutely.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  They're getting a client underclass now that begs for the state for handouts, ending American individualism.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  Nobody wants to admit that they're a peasant.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  Certainly not 250 million Americans or 320 million Americans who want to admit they're a peasant.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  They're susceptible to me more fair because they're in denial about their own peasantry.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  MaxKaiser.com. Max, thanks for coming in.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  I'm at Real Max Kaiser on Twitter.

[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  That's fine. I've been in straight jackets many times.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  Good.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  And already you've seen all sorts of crazy things happen.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  They're trying to start wars.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  They're trying to overthrow the president.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  They're trying to silence free speech.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  They're trying to trigger riots in the streets,
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  but everything they do is blowing up in their face.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word,
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  keep countering their lies.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  And we have to be prepared in case things go south.

[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  please tell others about it word of mouth.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  How we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  We're fighting to win and we are winning.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  Thanks to you.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  Real stuff, man.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you,
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  he sits there and lets these big tech people
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  keep running rough shot over and everybody,
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  I mean, I've got a problem.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  That said, about two months ago,
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers,
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  20 different stickers,
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  impeach the Democrats,
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  save the Second Amendment,
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  defend the First Amendment in FullWars.com.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  And it looks like duct tape.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  It's just a regular sticker.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally,
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  People say, why are you doing this?
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  What's happening?
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  When you go, well, we're being censored.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  And Dr. Pachennick,
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  let me just ask you what you think,
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  because I've not launched this yet.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  It's brilliant.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with,
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  Silence.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  First.com is tomorrow's news today.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  All right.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  It's always great to have Max Geyser in studio with us.
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  But I think part of it is he does his international RT show.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  It's very serious.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  And then he likes to blow off steam
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  and have fun here on this show.
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  But things are really, really serious.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  And on air and off air,
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  he was agreeing that this coronavirus,
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  long-term, threatens the global economy.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  And it's certainly causing big shake-ups in China.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  But I wanted to get Mike Adams on,
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  because in the last month that we've been focused on the coronavirus,
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  I have really tried to downplay how serious things could be,
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  because I don't want to overplay it.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  But I got to tell you,
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  the response we've seen has been over the top.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  The government's saying everything's okay
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  out of one side of their mouth,
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  but massive preparations on the other side really concerns me.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  And now we're seeing that, indeed,
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  we're covering up the real numbers of people that were sick.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  And now we've got major scientific institutions
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  and major medical institutions saying the reinfection is happening
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  and people get even sicker in the reinfection
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  because it looks like it's mutated.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  So something big's going on here.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  Absolutely, Xi Jinping is using this to clamp down a political list
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  and it's moving to Taiwan where their takeover's been unpopular.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  But there's something else going on.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  We know it's been made.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  We know they've been covering up the origin of that.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  Now, mainline news is saying it's man-made.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  So we've really been the cutting edge here
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  with Mike Adams, another guest that we've had on the broadcast.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  Cruise ship coronavirus cases spiked 30%
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  first death reported in Europe.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  Doctors warn of even deadlier coronavirus reinfection
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  causing sudden heart attacks.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  Leading medical journal reports coronavirus highly contagious
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  and more deadly than initially estimated.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  Bill Gates warns 10 million lives at risk as virus spreads to Africa
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  and Taiwan reports first death.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  China now censoring coronavirus critics in the U.S.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  We'll get more into that in a moment.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  China's disintegrating, steel demand, property sales, traffic
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  all approaching zero.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  I mean, if it is a hoax, it's the biggest hoax in history,
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  but it is contagious.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  It is killing people, but I mean, are they over-responding?
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  Coronavirus could infect 60% of the whole population of unchecked.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  That's the London Guardian.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  Xi's early involvement in virus outbreak raises questions.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  To 10 coronavirus, Mao-style social control blankets China.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  Did coronavirus originate in Chinese government laboratories?
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  See, that's now in Reuters.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  It's now in the Daily Mail.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  It's now in the German news.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  No handshakes, viral outbreaks, spook Asians, places of worship, AP.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  Pets in China forced to wear bizarre makeshift masks made by owners
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  amid fears they may catch deadly coronavirus.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  And there's just all taped up animals faces looking completely dystopic.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  Mass hysteria?
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  A hunt for clues in Hawaii after a tourist couple falls ill with coronavirus.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  China desperate to stop coronavirus spread turns neighbor against neighbor.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  Avoid crowds, overvirus, Japan health minister warns.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  I mean, I gotta go to Mike Adams to stop just reading all these headlines.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  Everything Mike said two, three weeks ago has now come true, okay?
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  And we've been laying this out, so it's obviously big, but what is it?
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  What's behind it?
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  How bad is it gonna get?
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  Mike Adams, what's the latest?
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  Tell us tomorrow's news today.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  I really appreciate your segments with Max Kaiser there.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  I apologize, I can't bring that level of levity to this because I've just been diving into the coronavirus,
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  but I'm glad, you know, I'm really glad that we could have a little humor today
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  because it's about to get really dark for America.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  So number one, first of all, in the last week, the CDC top person,
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  the head of the CDC, Dr. Redfield, admitted that this was coming to America
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  in the form of community outbreaks and that it would return essentially year after year
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  kind of like the way the seasonal flu keeps coming back mutated.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  So you have the head of the CDC admitting that this is going to become endemic in the human population,
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  and it's only a matter of time before it goes across America.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  That's right, after God said that on Friday, and you wrote about it, naturalloves.com,
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  but that's so huge, there's a whole new class of virus that's clearly made in the laboratory
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  that they tell us is this whole new thing we've got to just deal with now.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  Absolutely, and as you just mentioned, the reinfection of this is more fatal than the initial infection
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  because what happens is during the initial infection, your body is slow to respond,
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  slow to build the antibodies.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  If you survive that, and currently we believe that maybe 83, 85 out of 100 people survived that first infection,
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  if you get reinfected, what happens is your body over responds with what's called a cytokine storm
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  and that combined with the initial scarring of your lungs from the first infection is causing sudden heart failure.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  And Alex, this I believe is what's behind those videos of people dropping dead on the streets,
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  where they die in 60 seconds and it just collapse.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  It's the second infection.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  It's the same virus.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  It's just that your body responds differently and you have sudden extreme heart failure and you're dead.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  You cannot be revived. It's over.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  So remember, I don't know if you've read reports about the Spanish flu in 1918.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  It wasn't the first wave that killed the, what, 50 million people around the world.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  It was the second wave.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  So even if we are lucky enough to survive the first wave of this, the second wave of infection could be even more devastating than the first.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  And by the way, I'm starting to get hints.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  I want to be careful.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  This is not confirmed yet, but we're seeing in the Asian media, we're seeing a lot of mentions of people who had been traveling to and from Hawaii
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  later getting diagnosed in countries like Japan and Taiwan and Malaysia and so on.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  There seems to be some kind of link to Hawaii right now.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  Again, it's not confirmed. We're not aware of any outbreaks there.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  But if you think about the number of Asian people who visit Hawaii for tourism or business, you know,
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  they're large Japanese American communities in Hawaii and so on,
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  then you begin to understand Hawaii makes sense as the first geographical place for this to really have sustained outbreaks in America.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  But it doesn't happen.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  But the evidence is sort of pointing in that direction.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  At the same time, right now in China, so many people are under quarantine or lockdown.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  It's now double the population of the entire United States of America.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  760 million people under lockdown in China.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  And they're now starting to offer rewards if you narc on your feverish neighbor.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  So now this is full blown communism, Alex, where it's like, here, we're going to pay you money.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  The state is going to pay you money to turn in your neighbor who has a fever or who's coughing or who just came from Wuhan and didn't tell anybody.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  So now we have this secret police culture where they're turning people against each other all across China.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  And on top of that, you want me to keep going? I've got more.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  You've got the floor here. I mean, clearly something big behind this. And you're right, they're using it as a clamp down.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  But there are people for real just dropping dead. And that's what these reports.
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  You talked about this two weeks ago, but now major medical institutions are saying that's what's causing his total cardiac arrest.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  So a piece I put together, by the way, I just published 15 minutes ago a new piece that talks about how the coronavirus could alter the outcome of the 2020 election.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  We should probably get into that.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  Maybe you want to repost it's up to you. But the Democrat cities, they rely on public transportation where you share common surfaces in subways and taxis and rail trains and public transportation buses.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  Well, the coronavirus survives up to nine days on a surface, viable.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  And also in liberal cities, you have sanctuary status, which means that once this gets into Mexico or other South American or Central American nations,
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  they're going to have people fleeing those nations who are infected. They're trying to run away from the pandemic.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  They're going to cross the U.S. border and they're going to be drawn like magnets to the sanctuary cities like San Francisco, where we already have a feces problem there.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  We now have scientists confirming that this coronavirus spreads through human feces.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  Another confirmed case in Hong Kong where it was spread through the sewage lines in an apartment building.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  Stay there. Let's start over then because that's really the big news that this could affect the 2020.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  Three weeks ago, we told you that the Pentagon had set up secret quarantine centers for the coronavirus and that they believed it was much more serious than we were being told.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  Now we know that that is the case.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  And we know the federal government and major corporations have been buying up all the major storable food supplies around the country.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  Almost everyone else is sold out. But our supplier, my patriot, InfowarsStore.com still has their entire line of high quality, fresh food.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  And it's fresh. That's why you have to wait 10 to 14 days for it to get delivered.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  Not because they don't have the food, but because they've got a package it and their factories are going 24 hours a day.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  High quality, fresh food, the best package systems, tastes great, protects you and your family and funds the Infowar.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  You just got to get the orders in until they extended out even more, which could happen.
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  Lock in your orders now. Ensure you get it at InfowarsStore.com today.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  Trust CNN, trust MSNBC, drink fluoridated water, just like the loving kiss of a king cobra pumping deadly, I mean loving, helpful nutrients in their body.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  Hug the cobra, love the cobra, kiss the cobra, but never, never go to Infowars.com or InfowarsStore.com.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  Do not order those products. Silence, don't sell it.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  Don't be a victim. If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard, because that can lower your immune system.
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:07.000]  Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down when you have plenty of hydration.
[1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  Prayer and meditation has been a privilege to make you healthier. Get plenty of vitamin C, get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it. That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:25.000]  We have sold out of the 16-ounce immune gargle that has the nano-silver that Pat did and documented and even admitted in documents we've shown
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  to go after this whole Corona SARS family. A virus. We're almost sold out of the one-ounce spray bottles.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  That'll be sold out a couple days, and we're about a week and a half or so of the super-silver three-ounce bottles.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  Great to have, period. Really good for your gums, really great for your teeth.
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  We also have the super-silver in our whitening toothpaste. Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  with this top nanotech company based here in the U.S. that's in all these Homeland Security documents and everything,
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  because we get the best stuff. There's a lot of patrons. There's not just bad guys coming after us.
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  There's the flip side of all the good guys and good gals. It's very exciting.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by InfoWarsLife.

[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  Alright, Mike Adams is our guest here, Natural News. He's been on target.
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  Nobody else really breaking all this down. It's been in the medical journals, it's been out there,
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  but they've been really suppressing those and making people cover it up.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  But now more and more scientists, more and more people in the U.S. government are coming out and saying,
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  no, it is man-made. And it's a whole new class of viruses that they say is like the flu
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  that'll just be mutating and bouncing around forever. So who knows how it really mutates later?
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  Who knows what they've already done with this virus in the laboratory? And now we're going to see it unfold for years.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  We have the headline. It's up at InfoWars.com. Hope people will share it. It's also at NaturalNews.com, where Mike first published it.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  Could the coronavirus pandemic drastically alter the 2020 elections?
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  Democrat cities are the most likely outbreak hubs because of the rats, the feces, the needles,
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  just the overall mental illness and filthiness everywhere, and their giant destinations for people pouring out of the third world
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  with all sorts of other diseases that also lower the immune system. Mike, lay it out for them.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  Well, there are really two big risks. One set of risks works against the Democrats and the other against Trump.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  First, in terms of infections, the Democrat cities are the high-density areas that are most likely to spread these diseases.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  They have homelessness problems in places like Seattle, shared needles, filthy streets,
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  B.C.s running in the streets of San Francisco, bad public health policies. It's a disaster in many of these liberal cities. On top of that, again,
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  you have shared public transportation. People don't typically own their own private cars. They share transportation.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  And these are sanctuary cities where infected migrants are likely to go to.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  On the other side of this, if there is an economic impact from this outbreak, then that's going to hurt Trump.
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  Because, as I said in the story, I believe that President Trump has foolishly tied himself to one number in America,
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  and that's the Dow Jones industrial average, which by itself is very one-dimensional, doesn't really cover the full economy
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  of what's really happening. I mean, there's a lot of good news in America. Unemployment rate has plummeted, especially among minority groups.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  But the stock market is a bubble. It is going to correct at some point if this pandemic accelerates that correction,
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  and that will be used to hammer Trump, and people might start to lose faith in the Trump administration if he can't keep that stock market sky-high
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  all the way through November. So maybe these are a wash. Maybe these risks balance each other out. It's hard to say,
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  but I think we have to be asking right now, and here on your show, this is the first time we're talking about it publicly on any broadcast,
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  how will this impact the election? And there were 26 Democrat senators who wrote a letter to President Trump,
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  an urgent letter, I think just two days ago, saying that they need more funding to combat this virus.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  So far, President Trump has really not done much about this, and I think he needs to get out in front of this very quickly.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  He has ordered the research, as you know, to find out if this was genetically engineered. We already know that's the case.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  We don't know if the government's going to cover that up. At least Trump is doing something.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  But he needs to get out in front of this and say to the American people, it's not a bad idea to get prepared.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  It's not a bad idea to think about maybe you have to keep your kids home from school if there's an outbreak in your community.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  But so far, he's not doing any of that. I think he doesn't want to cause panic.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  So we're still far away from the election. We're going to see how this plays out.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  By the way, 355 people now confirmed infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  Now think about this. They're getting infected because they're sharing the same air on that ship.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  It's not a level four biohazard quarantine center. It's a floating clinic now, basically.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  People keep getting infected, and here's the problem, Alex.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  They're going to release people from that quarantine on February 19th in three days.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  They're going to release people who do not yet show signs.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  Well, what if that person got infected today or tomorrow?
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  They would only be in day two or day three of the incubation period.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  They would have full blown symptoms maybe two weeks later, but they're going to be released on February 19th.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Some of them are Americans, and they're choosing to fly back on commercial airlines in first class seats
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  rather than take the evacuation flights that are currently being chartered by the United States government.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  The evacuation participants will suffer another quarantine in the United States 14 more days after they come back,
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  at least according to early reports.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  But these other people who are released on February 19th, they will have no quarantine.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  They will be able to fly commercially and come back to U.S. airports and go back to their homes in U.S. cities all across the country
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  with no monitoring until they start to show symptoms.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  So I think this is a critical mistake. This is how these things happen.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  Bad mistakes. The CDC has already screwed up once.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  They sent a quarantine person home, accidentally realized that they should have been back in the quarantine center.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  There was a lab mix-up. You know, you covered that, I think, earlier in the week, and then they had to come back in the quarantine.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  So we're starting to see mistakes being made, not even to cover deliberate cover-ups that may be taking place,
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  but just mistakes will cause this to spread everywhere.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  Just jump in whenever you want. I'm going to keep going until you do.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  Oh, no, Mike, that's why you're here. I want you to lay all this out.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  Nobody's laying out more comprehensive, more accurate information. We're blessed to have you.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  Well, look, I'm honored to be here, and Bill Gates now says 10 million people could be killed in Africa alone.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  Of course, a lot of people are going to find that ironic, given the depopulation agenda of Bill Gates and so on.
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  But he's talking about just Africa.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  Now, Ethiopia Airlines is continuing to take flights directly from China, because they take money from China.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  They don't want to insult China, so they haven't cut off the flights.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  Ethiopia and other African nations, I mean, in Egypt now we have a confirmed case.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  Many of these nations are not in any way equipped to deal with this outbreak, and they will simply just refuse to test for it.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  And that way they don't have to report any numbers.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  An outbreak in Africa, Bill Gates, he's saying it could kill 10 million people.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  He knows the real number is more like 100 million. He's being very conservative.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  This could be a real wipeout of millions of people, tens of millions of people across the world in Africa.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  Something big is going on because, and yes, I'm selling terrible food.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  I always am. It's the highest quality. It's the best. We've still got it on hand. Others don't.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  But we know the other big suppliers really are sold out.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  We know they're selling out to FEMA and the federal government. We know that.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  So that's why I'm still concerned is we're seeing real governmental action behind the scenes.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  So what we're seeing from our commercial suppliers in very fascinating conversations is that all the commercial buyers are now rejecting supplies from China,
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  which means they're now starting to source food supplies from other non-China sources which are being really wiped out very quickly.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  As an example, just two days ago, we purchased the last 5,000 pounds of organic millet that's available in North America.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  We were told by our supplier, that's it. No more millet till the next season because now everybody's shifting away from China.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  So we have this massive movement in the food industry, which is why it's great that your suppliers have supplies locked up,
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  probably contractually locked up for many, many months. They can still supply food.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  Most people cannot.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  That's starting to run out too though. That's what's scary is food sales aren't going down after a month of panic buying.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  They're actually going up now again to record levels and that's because institutions, corporations and government are buying everything up.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  My patriot isn't selling out to government. That's their policy.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  But we've seen massive buying by government agencies and others. That means they believe something big is coming.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  I hope that's not the case. I hope it's just a backup.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  But again, Mike, the insane response that you have seen to this by China, is it just a power grab by Xi Jinping?
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  What's the real death numbers? What's the real projections now?
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  Well, according to my estimates, just based on analysis, there are at least now 250,000 people infected and probably over 25,000 deaths.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  Those might be off by a factor of 10. It might be 10 times higher. We just don't know yet.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  But look, the real play here is that China now wants to export these infections to other countries so that China doesn't get the blame for the global pandemic that's coming.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  I have no question. No doubt China is trying to export infections to Taiwan, to Hawaii, to Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, so that China doesn't get the blame.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  They already convinced the WHO to change the name of the virus away from the Wuhan pneumonia coronavirus to COVID-19, which doesn't have the word China in it, by the way.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  They're trying to rewrite history. They're trying to blame America. If they can cause an outbreak in America, they can say, look, even the CDC couldn't control this.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  How could you expect us in China to control it?
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  So this is getting to a very dangerous biological weapons stage.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  China already put a Chinese citizen that was infected on a Taiwan evacuation flight to try to sneak that person into Taiwan.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  And by the way, Mike, we were skeptics of China's official story going back a month ago.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  We were attacked. They called for us to be censored even more off the Internet because we dared question the official story.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  Now it turns out we were right yet again, which is why it's so important to keep info wars and actual news on the air and why the listeners are so amazing.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  Because we're here to challenge the official narrative and bring you all the intel that's available that they're just covering up.

[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy. They're trying to start wars.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  They're trying to overthrow the president. They're trying to silence free speech. They're trying to trigger riots in the streets,
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  but everything they do is blowing up in their face.

[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad, but here's the bottom line.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face the globalists not contract.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  I don't want them to win. So listen, you got this guarantee from me.

[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  During a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory. They'll still take your orders.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  That's why about 11 years ago, I found my Patriot supply now the biggest, most trusted company out there and I became a private label or forum
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  because they actually have it on hand. They actually give it delivered to you on time.
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  They do what they're going to say they're going to do because they want you as a customer over and over again and they're good people.
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  Now they were saying seven to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food, but they got a package at record level orders.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  So get your orders at infowarsore.com. Get the best deals, get it delivered first.
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  They're in our system. It goes right to them. Then it funds the info as well.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  So get prepared infowarsore.com with Swarble Foods.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  We know there's a depopulation agenda. We know that they are developing deadly biological weapons under the guise of
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  bioweapons protection all over the world and we know this virus is man-made.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  It's got the injection points where it leaves the signature of exactly what was done and how it was done.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  And you think of, again, somebody's had open heart surgery. You see a big scar and they can x-ray it and see where the chest was cut open and where it was stapled back together.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  Or you can see a woman that's had breast implants. They either went in through the front or they go in under the bottom.
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  You know she's had breast implants.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  Well, when stuff's microscopic, it's even easier to see because it's so little and you're trying to inject something into it.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  It's got a big old smashed inside and it's got the RNA sleeves still touching it.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  So it's fake. It's been manipulated and they're introducing it to us. I think it's the new global fear every year and it's going to mutate and get worse.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  We already know it is with reinfection and causing heart attacks.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  And so the flu doesn't scare us enough to take the vaccines. This is a man-made weapon to make us take vaccines.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  I've studied it. I've looked at it at every angle. Mike's held back a lot and says, well, clearly it's released and they're using it as a power grab, but it looks like it escaped.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  You know what? I don't think it escaped. I think they released it.
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  Now that's speculation and I'm not saying Mike's wrong. Either way, you've got all these governments agreeing with each other and they're getting the vaccine, but oh, you got to wait 18 months.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  Oh, oh, they're going to hurry it up and have it next year.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  This is bad and it pisses me off. And that's where I stand on this. Mike Adams, what do you think?
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  I agree with you now. My assessment has changed in the last week. I believe this was also a deliberate release.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  So that's interesting. Just said that. I believe that it was introduced possibly by an agent working in that virology lab in Wuhan, but it was.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  Oh, yeah, I forgot. Now the scientists reportedly stole it from Canada. It is dead.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  Yeah. And a bunch of other people are getting killed. I'm sorry. There's just so many angles here.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  No, exactly. Well, look, this this achieves all of the top goals of the globalist.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  Think about this. I don't think anybody's put all these pieces together. It's not just the population, but every government in the world is about to go broke from debt spending.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  They need a scapegoat. Sure would be great to blame a virus for the economic collapse that's about to happen everywhere because of the global debt pyramid that that Max Kaiser was just talking about an hour ago.
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  By the way, he's correct on all that. Also, think about this. What's driving governments broke entitlement programs to retired people who no longer pay taxes but have huge costs to the governments in terms of Medicare and Social Security pensions.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  If they could come up with a way to kill off mostly elderly people. Wow, that would sure save governments of the world, including America, Canada, the UK, China, everywhere.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  Billions I mean hundreds of maybe trillions of dollars over a few years. What an amazing coincidence that this is happening and they get to roll out a medical martial law police state and they get to censor people who are anti vaccine saying that you're responsible for causing all these deaths because you didn't promote the vaccine.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  I mean, think about all that this accomplishes. This is sort of a globalist dream come true. It's it hits on all these notes. And that's why I think this is no longer coincidence.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  I don't think it's an accident anymore. I think it was engineered. And it's made to look like an accident. But for whatever reason they chose China. Maybe some globalists want to get rid of the communists first but they knew this was going to spread globally.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  They knew this could not be contained. And now that we have the CDC admitting that that that that is coming to America and what they call community outbreaks. We know this is a global killer.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  It bill gates 10 million number. That's that's best case scenario. It's more like hundreds of millions. If this really infects 60% of the world population as is predicted by some scientists like the Hong Kong doctors and scientists.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  I mean, we're talking about a significant reduction in human population and also complete medical martial law coming out of this and basically rewriting human history also talk about the upheavals the geopolitical changes population changes the the financial bankruptcies the
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  waves of that that's coming globally. This is this is going to reconfigure our world.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  Mike, you just said it the final piece of the puzzle. And again, you've been running along and what was coming next and we were all hoping it was this accidentally released.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  Because why the hell would you do it when it's so obviously a bio weapon that the Chinese have but maybe they didn't release it. They stole it. Somebody else knew they stole it and they released it to set them up and Jesus making lemonade with lemons.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  I mean, regardless, we've always known when the global financial collapse comes, the UN Bill Gates and others have said we'll keep globalism together with a global pandemic, global response to a global pandemic and that's it.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  The way the central banks get out of this and blame a world financial meltdown. If not this year next year the year after is with a new deadly virus show whether it is ultra deadly or not we know it spreads fast and it's killing a lot of people.
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  We know it's mutating, but they can tell us that whatever is killing people, whatever is going on, whatever they pull, whenever they want is the coronavirus and then use that as the excuse to bring down the Ponzi scheme that they themselves know they can't
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  prop up much longer because we know they can't prop it up much longer.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  Look, every government made entitlement promises. They absolutely cannot. They cannot pay the pensions in Illinois or the city of Chicago or even at a federal level. They cannot pay the Social Security promises. They can't pay Medicare.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  Look, this system ends one way or another. What the globalists have figured out here is that they can end it in a way that doesn't cast blame on them. They can find a scapegoat. How they always find a scapegoat.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  They had a scapegoat for the assassination of JFK. They have a scapegoat for 9-11, even though of course we know they allowed that attack to happen for all sorts of reasons. Right.
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  If not actively involved in it, but they always have a scapegoat because continuity of government is what matters to them. They, the elitists and the controllers and the bureaucrats, they want to survive.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  And they have to be the savior and they have to have their system in position to make sure we follow orders during a major war, during a major outbreak.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  While the UN attacks the borders and attacks the infrastructure at the very same time to bring in the collapse, but they want a controlled collapse.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  And I believe Trump is not working with them and has been trying to prop it up. Even though the bubble is not good, no one wants to be there when it implodes.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  He wants to have defeated the deep state, gotten people ready, released a bunch of suppressed technologies to try to create new economies before the collapse.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  And that's why things are so incredibly dangerous. Mike Adams, amazing job. Please join us again throughout the weekday broadcast tomorrow, the next day, whenever you can pop in.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  This has been some of the most important radio I think we've ever done here. I think everybody knows truth when they hear it.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  You've got all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle and now the last pieces are plopping in and we're not saying this to scare people. We're saying it so people can have plans, be prepared and know how serious the situation is.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  Mike Adams of naturalnews.com. Thank you. Thank you.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  All right, I'm out of time, but I wanted to end with some good news.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  Hillary Clinton is incredibly obnoxious and almost everyone hates her.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  But still she's delusional and thinks she can win. Same thing with Bloomberg.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  And it's the same thing with Michael Avenatti, who was the savior of everyone and invincible and he's God and he's going to defeat Trump.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  And notice now he's been indicted a bunch of times. He's nothing but a dirty crook. Everybody knew that, who already knew who he was out in Los Angeles for years.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  And so it just shows how, yeah, evil has plans and it seems like sometimes they're really powerful and can't be defeated.
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  But in the end, God is in control and these people will be defeated. So here's a boil down of the fall of their savior, Avenatti.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  He's Donald Trump's worst nightmare, Michael Avenatti.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  Joining us once again is Michael Avenatti.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  Let's bring in Michael Avenatti.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  Michael Avenatti. Michael Avenatti. Michael Avenatti.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  Michael Avenatti, thank you very much.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  He's out there saving the country.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  Like God Meacham says he may be the savior of the republic.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  You are something of a folk hero now.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  I owe Michael Avenatti an apology.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  I've been saying enough already, Michael. I've seen you everywhere. What do you have left to say?
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  I was wrong, brother. You have a lot to say.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  I am just dying to hear what you think.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  These people all like you.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  I'm the only person right here. Donald Trump fears more than Robert Miller.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  We think you guys are the tip of this beer that's going to take down Donald Trump.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  Michael Avenatti's a beast.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  Okay, that's true.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  And he's a beast.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  He's a beast.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  I hand it to her and I hand it to Michael Avenatti.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  But he has a bigger calling here that being a lawyer is minimal compared to what he's doing.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  No one has talked tougher directly to Donald Trump on TV than Michael Avenatti.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  And Donald Trump is afraid to mention his name.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  That's fascinating.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  Donald Trump is terrified of Michael Avenatti.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  Trump will run for his money and everybody else, Michael Avenatti.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  Existential threat to the Trump presidency.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  The Democrats could learn something for you.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  You are messing with Trump a lot more than they are.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  He has no doubt created sheer panic in Donald Trump's very fragile mind.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  Michael Avenatti is laying down the law as guest co-host.
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  And is he really thinking about running for president?
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  One reason why I'm taking you seriously as a contender is because of your presence on cable news.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  You look at the field of Democrats right now and Avenatti is the one who stands out.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  If they decide they value a fighter most, people would be foolish to underestimate Michael Avenatti.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  I have always said that they need a fighter.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  Look, I mean, we're going to continue to use the media.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  I think we've used it with great success.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  All of my sexual fantasies involve handcuffs.
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  Aww.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  Yeah, he actually said that, folks.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  So there's their god, their savior, their lord, their king.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  He's a total joke.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  Just like all these other cover-up lawyers attacking Trump supporters and trying to take folks off the air,
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  they're all going to end up just like that dirtbag, creepy porn lawyer in the dustbin of history.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  The globalists are over.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  They're finished and so is their witch god, Hillary, and her little footstool, Bloomberg.
