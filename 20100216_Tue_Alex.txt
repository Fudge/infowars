[00:35.000 --> 00:39.920]  offensive against tyranny we launch a new offensive against the new world
[00:39.920 --> 00:45.760]  order and its lies and disinformation at the start of each day's transmission 11
[00:45.760 --> 00:53.320]  a.m. central standard time to 3 p.m. central standard time it is Tuesday the
[00:53.320 --> 01:04.600]  16th day of February 2010 we're gonna be live here for the next four hours

[01:33.000 --> 01:43.120]  to give us his take on the report the verbal radio report I did yesterday that
[01:43.120 --> 01:48.320]  dovetails with the text report by Paul Joseph Watson today from prisonplanet.com
[01:48.320 --> 01:58.360]  Obama is being blackmailed into attacking Iran and it goes on in the story
[01:58.360 --> 02:05.080]  I guess info wars.com actually chopped off half the headline so I'm reading an
[02:05.080 --> 02:10.480]  info wars.com version we need to have that sub headline added or it doesn't
[02:10.480 --> 02:15.800]  make sense and the rest of the headline breaks down the fact that the
[02:15.800 --> 02:24.120]  establishment media is setting the precedent and pre-programming the
[02:24.120 --> 02:36.680]  population ahead of an attempted assassination on Barack H. Obama so
[02:36.680 --> 02:42.640]  Tarpley will be joining us in the third hour to talk about that today and then

[04:30.040 --> 04:33.680]  Australia exposing the fraud there
[04:34.040 --> 04:43.360]  obviously the climate fraud is in full complete retreat right now at the
[04:43.360 --> 04:47.320]  international level they have no intention these ticks and fleas and
[04:47.320 --> 04:52.400]  other blood-sucking parasites from going quietly they've got to be removed and
[04:52.400 --> 04:58.720]  pulled out of our flesh but we're definitely starting to route them stay
[04:58.720 --> 05:03.320]  with us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[05:03.320 --> 05:07.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:07.640 --> 05:11.840]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:11.840 --> 05:15.880]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:15.880 --> 05:19.720]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[05:19.720 --> 05:24.000]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.160]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:28.160 --> 05:32.480]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:32.480 --> 05:36.200]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[05:36.200 --> 05:40.400]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[05:40.400 --> 05:43.760]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[05:43.760 --> 05:47.720]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[05:47.720 --> 05:53.000]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government

[06:01.320 --> 06:06.320]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[06:06.320 --> 06:11.000]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[06:11.000 --> 06:14.440]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[06:14.440 --> 06:19.320]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[06:19.320 --> 06:24.120]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[06:24.120 --> 06:28.480]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[06:28.480 --> 06:33.760]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[06:33.760 --> 06:38.080]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[06:38.080 --> 06:41.520]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the

[08:13.680 --> 08:22.960]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[08:22.960 --> 08:28.880]  waging war on corruption crashing through the lies and disinformation we
[08:28.880 --> 08:36.680]  are live Tuesday February 16th 2010 coming up Michael Bagnari of his first
[08:36.680 --> 08:42.240]  interviews since his heart attack that almost killed him Webster Tarbley on the
[08:42.240 --> 08:47.760]  plan to assassinate or attempt an assassination as a false flag on Barack
[08:47.760 --> 08:52.480]  Obama and Darwin Vedaker in the last 30 minutes on the latest attacks on the
[08:52.480 --> 08:59.920]  gun show and all the gun grabbing going on nationwide total news blitz in this
[08:59.920 --> 09:05.320]  first hour ladies and gentlemen let me just say this because it's been an hour
[09:05.320 --> 09:12.120]  and a half on Glenn Beck yesterday I meant to spend 30 minutes I don't like
[09:12.120 --> 09:16.520]  attacking other talk show host we are not known for in fighting and this is not
[09:16.520 --> 09:22.640]  in fighting Glenn Beck is an actor and a phony and a fake who has been positioned
[09:22.640 --> 09:28.640]  by News Corp and Rupert Murdoch to control the libertarian constitutionalist
[09:28.640 --> 09:35.000]  anti-New World Order movement and I last night I went to bed early at about 11
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.440]  and I couldn't sleep and I got up and I went and brainstormed and wrote four
[09:40.440 --> 09:44.600]  pages of notes tiny notes on Glenn Beck and sometime the next few weeks I'm
[09:44.600 --> 09:48.080]  gonna break it down and I began to remember I mean yesterday I was just
[09:48.080 --> 09:51.280]  criticizing him for a five-minute piece he did saying 9-11 truthers are gonna
[09:51.280 --> 09:56.240]  kill Obama and then I noticed that they're putting out this propaganda
[09:56.240 --> 09:59.360]  everywhere it's a talking point how dangerous that is they're clearly
[09:59.360 --> 10:03.200]  prepping everybody to attempt an assassination of him as a way to make
[10:03.200 --> 10:07.160]  him a hero and get his agenda through in his war on Iran that's why I have to
[10:07.160 --> 10:13.680]  cover this it's it's it's clearly an op they're running but I went to his YouTube
[10:13.680 --> 10:19.400]  channel and actually started watching things he's done in the past and really
[10:19.400 --> 10:22.440]  doing more research because I don't really follow Glenn Beck much just every
[10:22.440 --> 10:26.920]  time I see him or hear him he's saying we need to get a value-added tax or
[10:26.920 --> 10:30.520]  national sales tax O'Reilly saying that O'Reilly says he believes in global
[10:30.520 --> 10:37.200]  warming Sarah Palin says she believes in it as of just two months ago you've got
[10:37.200 --> 10:41.160]  them demonizing real patriots like Ron Paul and Deborah Medina and on the same
[10:41.160 --> 10:45.080]  show they'll have Ron Paul on and then talk bad about him after he leaves it's
[10:45.080 --> 10:50.640]  like a junior high school girl or something I mean it's just unbelievably
[10:50.640 --> 10:55.200]  transparent without even doing much research I mean it's just everywhere and
[10:55.200 --> 11:00.800]  so the more I actually start looking into this guy it gets worse and worse and
[11:00.800 --> 11:08.640]  worse and worse and he now says communist in acorn caused the financial
[11:08.640 --> 11:14.280]  collapse by design when Beck called for the banking takeover and called for the
[11:14.280 --> 11:17.520]  stimulus and everything else and it's called by the Wall Street Journal a
[11:17.520 --> 11:25.320]  champion of Wall Street I mean it's just a sick joke and I started thinking
[11:25.320 --> 11:31.960]  about Bill O'Reilly just how bad this guy is other than talking about how he
[11:31.960 --> 11:37.160]  supports troops all day never talks about other dying from DU and chemical
[11:37.160 --> 11:43.080]  weapon exposure other than just saying they're patriots every five seconds these
[11:43.080 --> 11:48.200]  guys are horrible and news core itself in all its foreign newspapers and
[11:48.200 --> 11:52.600]  magazines goes around saying global warming is real we got to have global
[11:52.600 --> 11:58.080]  taxes Rupert Murdoch goes to Davos you can pull these clips up and calls for
[11:58.080 --> 12:02.120]  global government and global taxes and they have all the rest the corporate
[12:02.120 --> 12:06.000]  media pushing it and Newt Gennrich saying it's real and calling for world
[12:06.000 --> 12:13.920]  government and these are the people that that run Fox News and so when the
[12:13.920 --> 12:17.640]  worm turned in the last five months against the globalist yes some of them
[12:17.640 --> 12:21.240]  jumped on the bandwagon but they did it after the fact I mean Rupert Murdoch
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.000]  put out an eight minute video we've played before here where he bragged and
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.440]  showed how all his TV holdings in the US are pushing man-made global warming and
[12:29.440 --> 12:34.720]  taxes so yeah they'll have a few people on Fox News saying it's a fraud
[12:34.720 --> 12:38.720]  occasionally until climategate blew open and then they came out and told the
[12:38.720 --> 12:45.040]  truth when it was already too late for them and I've had enough of this we
[12:45.040 --> 12:48.760]  don't need a value-added tax and a sales tax and they're going to keep that on
[12:48.760 --> 12:53.480]  top of the income tax they're not getting rid of that I remember reading
[12:53.480 --> 12:59.960]  talking points 10 years ago put out by neocon publications put out by some of
[12:59.960 --> 13:03.720]  these fake libertarian groups calling for a national sales tax or a value-added
[13:03.720 --> 13:07.440]  tax and then getting rid of the income tax and how they plan to actually keep
[13:07.440 --> 13:15.440]  both then this is public I told you more than 10 years ago they were gonna have
[13:15.440 --> 13:19.680]  neocons and fake conservatives push new tax systems but they're not gonna get
[13:19.680 --> 13:25.840]  rid of the income tax either I mean Rick Perry passed three new taxes in taxes
[13:25.840 --> 13:29.760]  including an income tax they call it a franchise tax or business tax he's for
[13:29.760 --> 13:35.720]  the nap to superhighways supported gun control and the average person doesn't
[13:35.720 --> 13:41.400]  even remember this from two three years ago I mean it's a sick joke Palin is bad
[13:41.400 --> 13:48.600]  Rick Perry is bad Glenn Beck is bad Bill O'Reilly is bad they have to have fake
[13:48.600 --> 13:54.840]  conservatives call for new taxes because they've got the confidence of so-called
[13:54.840 --> 14:00.000]  mainline America who believe the labeling but not what's actually inside the
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.800]  package although a lot of them are starting to get wise just like they
[14:03.800 --> 14:07.440]  have to have Obama the supposed peace prize winner launching all these new
[14:07.440 --> 14:12.400]  wars only he could get away with that there's no way Bush could have done
[14:12.400 --> 14:18.560]  that the country was on the verge of revolution till they put Obama in to
[14:18.560 --> 14:28.040]  whitewash and pacify everybody it's just so obvious it's so ridiculously clear
[14:28.040 --> 14:38.960]  you judge a tree by its fruits and now they've got a neocon and controlled left
[14:38.960 --> 14:43.720]  talking point out that 9-11 truth is working with al-qaeda and is gonna kill
[14:43.720 --> 14:48.400]  or try to kill Obama and you better bet it's all gonna be rigged this is
[14:48.400 --> 14:53.080]  serious business that's coming up in the third hour of the Webster Tarpley we're
[14:53.080 --> 15:01.080]  gonna break it down with him today why did Bush's White House put out memos
[15:01.080 --> 15:05.000]  saying 9-11 truth is the number one enemy why does Obama's White House put
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.920]  out memos saying that why do they have congressional hearings about it because
[15:08.920 --> 15:15.840]  we know the big dirty secret and it's nonpartisan then the top democratic
[15:15.840 --> 15:19.800]  candidate in Texas says he believes it can be an inside job Debra Medina just
[15:19.800 --> 15:24.200]  said people have a right to their opinion see the system has a problem
[15:24.200 --> 15:28.120]  because the majority of people don't believe the official story including
[15:28.120 --> 15:33.080]  six of the ten 9-11 Commission members Bush even appointed these people and they
[15:33.080 --> 15:41.080]  came out and said it was a fraud you can't suppress the truth that man made
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.520]  global warming's a fraud and a way to take over society you can't suppress the
[15:44.520 --> 15:48.320]  truth that we have a criminal government that stages terror attacks and then
[15:48.320 --> 15:52.040]  every other major government's been got doing it for their favorite tricks you
[15:52.040 --> 15:58.120]  can't suppress the fact that Stalin Mao Hitler and George Bush did it and that
[15:58.120 --> 16:03.440]  Obama staged that underwear bomber it's on record the feds got him on the plane
[16:03.440 --> 16:07.080]  it's on record they protected him it's on record another guy was on board
[16:07.080 --> 16:11.200]  reportedly with a bomb it's on record somebody was recording the underwear
[16:11.200 --> 16:14.920]  bomber the entire time it's on record the FBI live and now has been forced to
[16:14.920 --> 16:18.480]  come out and say okay it's all true but then it's not a major news issue it's in
[16:18.480 --> 16:23.160]  a few newspapers the State Department admitting they were ordered by
[16:23.160 --> 16:26.800]  intelligence to help him get on the plane who and then they say well we won't
[16:26.800 --> 16:30.720]  talk about the sharp-dressed man yes he was there well how does someone get you
[16:30.720 --> 16:33.680]  through security through the checkpoint through the body scanners without having
[16:33.680 --> 16:38.400]  to do it with no idea and get you on the plane that's a government agent and they
[16:38.400 --> 16:42.840]  admit they got him on they don't just they just don't say how we have them
[16:42.840 --> 16:52.880]  red-handed red-handed let me tell you something when Obama blows up some
[16:52.880 --> 16:56.960]  buildings or sets off a nuke or releases a bio weapon when I say Obama I mean his
[16:56.960 --> 17:02.600]  handlers all you foolish conservatives who've been prepositioned to make it a
[17:02.600 --> 17:05.840]  religious belief that you have that governments don't stage terror attacks
[17:05.840 --> 17:10.360]  and when they use this crisis to come after your land your kids and your guns
[17:10.360 --> 17:17.040]  remember that Glenn Beck and Fox News positioned you mentally to not be able
[17:17.040 --> 17:22.000]  to accept the facts and remember that the Mayak at Homeland Security documents
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.200]  that we received and released point the finger at you as the enemy you fools
[17:27.200 --> 17:36.040]  this whole thing is for you there is a plethora of false flags they can engage
[17:36.040 --> 17:43.680]  in on US naval ships in the Strait of Hormuz bio weapon releases Obama signed
[17:43.680 --> 17:49.280]  executive orders on that on a staged assassination attempt but clearly they're
[17:49.280 --> 17:54.040]  testing and laying the groundwork so people psychologically know who to
[17:54.040 --> 18:03.920]  blame right up front when somebody tries to kill Obama they are setting this up

[24:41.760 --> 24:46.600]  they're not buying our t-bills they're not buying our debt so the Federal

[25:31.800 --> 25:36.000]  flu kills 35,000 they say but most the doctors we've talked to in the
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.320]  statistics we've seen show that's inflated it's really about 15,000 but
[25:40.320 --> 25:43.800]  they count elderly people folks that have had heart attacks people that are
[25:43.800 --> 25:47.480]  have diabetes people that have compromised immune systems who have HIV
[25:47.480 --> 25:58.080]  they'll say oh well flu killed them and it's the same thing here just classic
[25:58.080 --> 26:08.600]  classic propaganda Arizona sheriff US in standoff over immigration enforcement
[26:08.600 --> 26:13.640]  that's right you have 800 plus cities in the US at the feds and the Mexican
[26:13.640 --> 26:19.160]  government it may deals with where they don't enforce laws on drunk driving
[26:19.160 --> 26:25.640]  having no ID no insurance not paying bills but they're given welfare anything
[26:25.640 --> 26:31.000]  they want under any fake name they want more than 90% of the illegal aliens
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.920]  that have houses in Austin this comes directly from Austin Energy don't even
[26:35.920 --> 26:41.040]  have to pay their bill it's just given to them you can't make this type of stuff
[26:41.040 --> 26:45.280]  up meanwhile all over the country when sheriffs will arrest a vanload of illegal
[26:45.280 --> 26:50.360]  aliens with the coyote carrying them around to jobs that's what they're
[26:50.360 --> 26:54.480]  called the smugglers the human smugglers they call ice and ice won't pick them up
[26:54.480 --> 26:58.720]  and then the AP reported last year when they do most the time the government
[26:58.720 --> 27:04.880]  gives them jobs and green cards on the spot we already have amnesty and so God
[27:04.880 --> 27:09.840]  forbid a sheriff actually enforce the law an Arizona sheriff said he planned to
[27:09.840 --> 27:12.680]  defy Washington's attempt to roll back his staunch enforcement of federal
[27:12.680 --> 27:15.800]  immigration law a move that could put him on a collision course with the US
[27:15.800 --> 27:20.080]  government late last year US immigration customs enforcement the largest arm the
[27:20.080 --> 27:22.920]  Department of Homeland Security stripped Maricopa County Sheriff Joe
[27:22.920 --> 27:26.880]  Arpaio the authority to use 100 of its deputies to enforce federal immigration
[27:26.880 --> 27:30.840]  in his jurisdiction which includes Phoenix which is totally overrun they
[27:30.840 --> 27:34.400]  mainly the criminals from Mexico come up and do whatever they want imagine it's
[27:34.400 --> 27:38.080]  just that they're above the law the customs agency took the action because
[27:38.080 --> 27:41.560]  Mr. Arpaio's aggressive immigration crackdowns had drawn criticism from
[27:41.560 --> 27:46.440]  human rights groups early what about Mexico when an arrest college kids for
[27:46.440 --> 27:51.840]  drinking beer and then sucks $50,000 or more out of their families anybody care
[27:51.840 --> 27:57.320]  about that when they beat you up the customs agency took the action because
[27:57.320 --> 28:00.480]  Mr. Arpaio's aggressive immigration crackdowns had drawn criticism from human
[28:00.480 --> 28:04.080]  rights groups and had run a foul of US Justice Department which is investigating
[28:04.080 --> 28:10.320]  whether he had used racial profiling and abused his authority you know what
[28:10.320 --> 28:16.240]  racial profiling is it's what they call zero tolerance when they say in a
[28:16.240 --> 28:21.280]  school we have zero tolerance so if your mother puts a plastic knife in your
[28:21.280 --> 28:31.240]  in your lunchbox so you can put butter on your bread I've seen this countless
[28:31.240 --> 28:37.120]  times they arrest you for a deadly weapon a plastic knife that maybe if you tried
[28:37.120 --> 28:43.040]  to saw your finger maybe you tried to cut yourself you might be able to what
[28:43.040 --> 28:47.920]  is it this big new TSA case were the cop that you know the media says he even
[28:47.920 --> 28:53.360]  told him he was a cop and they didn't care oh my goodness a God they brought

[29:15.600 --> 29:20.720]  meant to be you can't profile anyone if somebody matches the description of the
[29:20.720 --> 29:25.800]  bank robber you can't profile them no you've got to harass little old ladies
[29:25.800 --> 29:33.440]  and kids that can't even walk that's the same thing here oh my gosh you know he

[37:49.120 --> 38:00.560]  break down these 11 how many points is it 12 points that newsweek made saying
[38:00.560 --> 38:05.440]  that know your conspiracies man made global warming doesn't exist fema
[38:05.440 --> 38:11.320]  camps don't exist we're gonna be breaking that down with bagnaric coming up
[38:11.320 --> 38:17.840]  in the next hour but right now let me get into climate game you know we
[38:17.840 --> 38:21.040]  covered some of this yesterday and word monkeen is on in the second hour
[38:21.040 --> 38:26.600]  tomorrow to recap where we're at but here's the parallel the analogy the
[38:26.600 --> 38:33.040]  parable here's the little story to try to illustrate it for some people out
[38:33.040 --> 38:37.080]  there you know you go wild hog hunting or deer hunting and you're walking
[38:37.080 --> 38:41.720]  around the woods in the winter you're not gonna get any ticks but you go
[38:41.720 --> 38:49.280]  quail hunting or you go dove hunting in the hot late summer early fall you
[38:49.280 --> 38:52.880]  stay out the bush a few days and bring your quail or your dove back and
[38:52.880 --> 38:56.320]  marinate them there at the camp house and fry them up the pan and sleep in a
[38:56.320 --> 39:02.240]  tent when you get back to civilization in three or four days and you pull your
[39:02.240 --> 39:06.960]  clothes off you're probably gonna have 10 or 15 ticks on you they're gonna be
[39:06.960 --> 39:10.720]  between your legs between your toes they're gonna be on your head under your
[39:10.720 --> 39:19.080]  arms they like to hide in the dark and if you just start pulling those ticks out
[39:19.080 --> 39:22.680]  their heads are gonna be left in you you're gonna get a big old pustule so
[39:22.680 --> 39:28.320]  the best thing in the old days was you take a cigarette and they've normally
[39:28.320 --> 39:31.920]  been on you a day or so and you put it right up to them for just a second or
[39:31.920 --> 39:35.360]  so and they'll pull out they'll voluntarily pull their head out and then
[39:35.360 --> 39:43.720]  you can smash them and it's the same thing we have just discovered the tick
[39:43.720 --> 39:48.960]  infestation with climate game it's really illustrative for people just how
[39:48.960 --> 39:53.200]  dastardly and deceptive government is in a coordinated operation worldwide under
[39:53.200 --> 39:58.040]  you and control on record and Time Magazine and Newsweek and others hope
[39:58.040 --> 40:01.720]  you don't actually go read the climate gate emails or the other it's got to be
[40:01.720 --> 40:05.080]  more than 30 scandals I mean there's there's two or three every day I don't
[40:05.080 --> 40:08.920]  know in the last month so what is that 60 or so I mean I'm not kidding there's
[40:08.920 --> 40:13.960]  three new ones today there were two yesterday all bigger than climate game
[40:13.960 --> 40:18.960]  another parable is you know analogy is like a cop pulling somebody over and
[40:18.960 --> 40:24.760]  they got bloody scratches on their faces or on the guy's face and there's a
[40:24.760 --> 40:28.960]  woman's ripped dress in the back and the cop says stay right here I got
[40:28.960 --> 40:32.960]  probable cause calls back up they open the trunk up there's a dead woman in the
[40:32.960 --> 40:37.200]  back yeah that's climate gate then you drive to the guy's farmhouse and you
[40:37.200 --> 40:42.840]  find 30 or 40 bodies buried out back and films the guy's shot of torturing the
[40:42.840 --> 40:48.200]  women I mean how many times does that happen hundreds of times thousands of
[40:48.200 --> 40:53.560]  other cases they haven't caught these people a lot of times they're cops not
[40:53.560 --> 40:57.400]  saying cops are all serial killers but smart serial killers this is taught in
[40:57.400 --> 41:01.320]  criminology they go get positions of authority like they just caught a cop
[41:01.320 --> 41:08.080]  allegedly robbing a bank on the way to work yesterday doesn't mean all cops are
[41:08.080 --> 41:11.440]  bad it means that's a group you got to watch and they're low-level government
[41:11.440 --> 41:16.440]  at the higher you go the worst they get so climate gate is a dead woman in the
[41:16.440 --> 41:24.040]  back of the trunk bound and gagged been raped and killed now you go to the
[41:24.040 --> 41:27.600]  farmhouse folks it's a lot worse we've gone to the farmhouse and there's hundreds
[41:27.600 --> 41:30.720]  of bodies I mean this is the biggest serial killer operation we've ever
[41:30.720 --> 41:35.560]  seen and it gets worse ladies and gentlemen that's the whole point of
[41:35.560 --> 41:40.440]  course there were no WMD's of course 9-11 was staged of course the banks
[41:40.440 --> 41:44.160]  engineered the financial collapse and the evidence is all there on those two
[41:44.160 --> 41:50.040]  just like it is on climate gate it came out two months ago in the middle of
[41:50.040 --> 41:54.200]  climate gate that the UN in the mid-90s had coordinated with over a hundred major
[41:54.200 --> 41:57.800]  universities to engage in systematic fraud and now every university they go
[41:57.800 --> 42:03.960]  spot check is engaged in total fraud with the UN and the UN says in that
[42:03.960 --> 42:06.720]  document we covered so much that Paul Watson wrote about two months ago that
[42:06.720 --> 42:11.240]  a listener sent us actually on the UN website they weren't even hiding it that
[42:11.240 --> 42:14.800]  they found fellow travelers who supported getting rid of industrial
[42:14.800 --> 42:19.360]  society and setting up global government for a redistribution of wealth
[42:19.360 --> 42:22.040]  you out of the bankers
[42:25.880 --> 42:31.400]  we have them they think you're so stupid Von Roompi of the head of the EU
[42:31.400 --> 42:36.000]  Ban Ki-moon head of the UN Gordon Brown Al Gore they all announced world
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.120]  government you're gonna pay taxes to private banks and the Newsweek writes
[42:39.120 --> 42:43.200]  an article saying none of it exists and climate gates a conspiracy I mean it's
[42:43.200 --> 42:47.120]  admitted in thousands of newspapers the head of the UN programs admitted it's a
[42:47.120 --> 42:52.480]  fraud Santa Jones all of them and Newsweek thinks their readers are so
[42:52.480 --> 42:57.280]  stupid they write an article two days ago saying none of it exists now who's
[42:57.280 --> 43:03.200]  the conspiracy theorist here who's lying here I got an easy job folks all of
[43:03.200 --> 43:06.680]  you study the facts I understand the enemy's operations and I report the
[43:06.680 --> 43:10.960]  truth it's real easy that's why the number one target of media attacks from
[43:10.960 --> 43:14.440]  below and above because we're over the target ladies and gentlemen and the
[43:14.440 --> 43:21.560]  establishment knows it so yes we have just discovered we have a tick infestation
[43:21.560 --> 43:26.400]  but the ticks are hanging on we haven't even started burning them off us yet we
[43:26.400 --> 43:30.280]  haven't even gotten our zippo lighters out and you know just giving them a few
[43:30.280 --> 43:36.520]  seconds of flame under their hind in and they're putting on a good face just
[43:36.520 --> 43:40.760]  like they did for two weeks from climate gate broke in November they said
[43:40.760 --> 43:43.280]  there's no such thing we're not reporting on it for two weeks finally the
[43:43.280 --> 43:46.680]  dam broke and now in Austin and other cities where they're taking over every
[43:46.680 --> 43:50.720]  facet of your lives remote control thermostats home inspections 2.6
[43:50.720 --> 43:54.280]  billion dollars in taxes the next three years city council set to vote on it
[43:54.280 --> 43:58.400]  this month or next month and they just say it's all real we don't care and we've
[43:58.400 --> 44:02.200]  got former special forces black op commanders running local environmental
[44:02.200 --> 44:13.640]  group I mean this is a mechanized scientific hop they know what they're
[44:13.640 --> 44:23.200]  doing they know and they're not backing off we're gonna have to dig them out of
[44:23.200 --> 44:26.760]  their holes use a bush term smoke them out of their holes we're gonna have to
[44:26.760 --> 44:30.720]  go over every inch of our body and remove these lice these ticks these
[44:30.720 --> 44:35.280]  fleas you're gonna have to go to city council and county commissioner and
[44:35.280 --> 44:39.600]  water district and school board and say stop brainwashing our kids stop all
[44:39.600 --> 44:43.480]  your fake taxes stop raising taxes to take our money and then give it to your
[44:43.480 --> 44:47.480]  buddies for supposedly green jobs that cost two jobs for every job you create
[44:47.480 --> 44:56.920]  on top of the $700,000 for every job you deliver it's a joke they shut down
[44:56.920 --> 45:02.840]  your economy by design then they tell you don't worry we've got green jobs to
[45:02.840 --> 45:10.720]  fix it all they always maneuver you from stage crises to stage crises and
[45:10.720 --> 45:15.520]  ladies and gentlemen I have four mainstream news articles today out of
[45:15.520 --> 45:28.960]  Reuters and the London Telegraph and you name it where they are openly admitting
[45:28.960 --> 45:37.200]  that this is all staged what's happening in Europe right now again all the
[45:37.200 --> 45:43.160]  currencies will go down together our economists guests have all agreed it
[45:43.160 --> 45:46.280]  would start with the euro first the dollars already dropped by more than 40%
[45:46.280 --> 45:50.080]  over the but we're talking about dramatic fast drops then the euro starts
[45:50.080 --> 45:54.640]  dropping then everybody goes oh who ran the dollars surging for a day then it
[45:54.640 --> 45:58.480]  starts plunging today because it draws everything down with it then they'll
[45:58.480 --> 46:02.560]  pump them back up some more and then bring them back down again because they
[46:02.560 --> 46:07.400]  are the insider currency traders the big central banks have a huge casino that's
[46:07.400 --> 46:11.080]  rigged for themselves where they get to engage in all the insider trading they
[46:11.080 --> 46:21.520]  could ever want to they know what they're doing they are the enemies they are
[46:21.520 --> 46:25.520]  the parasites they're the people you're going to pay all your carbon taxes to and
[46:25.520 --> 46:29.920]  they don't care if Congress says no they'll just have the executive orders do
[46:29.920 --> 46:34.360]  it and they'll just come in and buy off your local city hell they can steal 2.6
[46:34.360 --> 46:39.880]  billion with one program that's only one program in Austin in three years if they
[46:39.880 --> 46:43.400]  can steal a hundred billion in the next decade seizing existing roads and
[46:43.400 --> 46:47.160]  throwing toll roads on it and they want you to go bankrupt they don't want you
[46:47.160 --> 46:50.560]  to be able to make it to your job they had climatologist at NASA the head of
[46:50.560 --> 46:57.400]  the UN program morey strong they all say in industrialized society can't you
[46:57.400 --> 47:03.000]  listen to them can't you listen to what they say they're out in the open about
[47:03.000 --> 47:09.440]  this they want to run your life they want to collectivize you and transfer all
[47:09.440 --> 47:13.640]  the wealth into the one-tenth of 1% and make you a bunch of destitute slaves and
[47:13.640 --> 47:20.680]  me a destitute slave they know what they are doing look at this dollar up is
[47:20.680 --> 47:32.160]  Europe reels that's earlier today but then an hour later before the bell US stock
[47:32.160 --> 47:42.200]  futures up as gold rises dollar drops Germany growls as grease balks at
[47:42.200 --> 47:46.960]  emulation what's emulation that's lighting yourself on fire see they
[47:46.960 --> 47:52.280]  position it and it's in the news that Goldman Sachs advised Greece and set all
[47:52.280 --> 47:56.360]  this up and who set up Iceland Goldman Sachs we've had members of their
[47:56.360 --> 48:00.880]  parliament on and who set up the housing crasher in the US Goldman Sachs and
[48:00.880 --> 48:04.240]  guess what's in the newsweek thing about debunking conspiracy theories they
[48:04.240 --> 48:07.920]  give no facts they just say Goldman Sachs was not involved in the collapse by
[48:07.920 --> 48:12.480]  design it's a complete fraud it's ridiculous and there's no truth to
[48:12.480 --> 48:17.520]  climate gate story finished we are newsweek we said so I mean it's like a
[48:17.520 --> 48:21.840]  10-year-old wrote this story but see it's not that their writers are actually
[48:21.840 --> 48:27.480]  stupid it's targeted at a 10-year-old intellect it's targeted people that
[48:27.480 --> 48:32.760]  still read newsweek and just want to be told everything's okay there's nothing
[48:32.760 --> 48:40.240]  going on the economy's wonderful everything's fine the EU has issued a
[48:40.240 --> 48:44.520]  political pledge to rescue Greece yes with more debt oh we'll rescue you going
[48:44.520 --> 48:49.920]  into debt and by precedent all club Mediterranean countries without first
[48:49.920 --> 48:54.800]  securing a mandate from the parliaments or creditor nations and it goes on from
[48:54.800 --> 49:00.120]  there Germany's Bundestag has drafted an opinion deeming a degree
[49:00.120 --> 49:05.520]  illegal but the executive bodies of the German government and other governments
[49:05.520 --> 49:09.520]  say we don't care what the guy what the real elected government says we'll do
[49:09.520 --> 49:16.200]  what we want just like they marched in Paulson and Geithner in the first days
[49:16.200 --> 49:19.760]  of October 2008 and said we don't care if you don't pass us we're just gonna do
[49:19.760 --> 49:28.560]  it read PDD 51 Paulson told the Congress sit down and shut up North
[49:28.560 --> 49:32.920]  com standing by you think we go in and wreck third-world countries and kill
[49:32.920 --> 49:37.080]  millions because we're weak we're powerful or murderers will stage more

[52:14.080 --> 52:19.480]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling

[52:24.760 --> 52:28.760]  attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[52:28.760 --> 52:33.520]  criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its
[52:33.520 --> 52:37.640]  ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[52:37.640 --> 52:41.160]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[52:41.160 --> 52:46.400]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does here and right now in Washington DC we
[52:46.400 --> 52:52.400]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at

[54:02.640 --> 54:11.720]  Come you masters of war. Here to build the big guns. The banking robbery of the
[54:11.720 --> 54:19.440]  planet is illegal. It is a fraud. It is us or them. We either bring the offshore
[54:19.440 --> 54:23.800]  banking cartel to justice and get our nation states back or we go into their
[54:23.800 --> 54:32.360]  Orwellian eugenics control grid. But I look I mean I have stacks of news. Every
[54:32.360 --> 54:39.800]  state's sales taxes are way down. 41 states have record sales tax plunges.
[54:39.800 --> 54:45.720]  Record the worst they've ever seen. Ladies and gentlemen most of the
[54:45.720 --> 54:48.560]  restaurants I like to go to and I don't go to restaurants often maybe once a
[54:48.560 --> 54:54.200]  week. Most of them I pull up to are closed. More than half the shops in Austin
[54:54.200 --> 55:00.840]  are shut down. Everything's shutting down. And Austin's one of the best cities in
[55:00.840 --> 55:07.760]  the country financially. Now on the subject of gold the banks did everything
[55:07.760 --> 55:11.440]  they could to come in with gold reserves they owned to sell them at below
[55:11.440 --> 55:18.920]  price to drive it down because gold exposes their entire program. And no I
[55:18.920 --> 55:24.400]  am not for a gold backed currency ladies and gentlemen. I am for a open public
[55:24.400 --> 55:28.120]  debate about monetary policy. I am for gold because it's up in the last nine
[55:28.120 --> 55:35.120]  years. The only investment that's been performing consistently well. There's no
[55:35.120 --> 55:37.960]  way we can go to that system because the banks own most the gold they would
[55:37.960 --> 55:42.920]  control things again. But I do believe we should get Congress in control of the
[55:42.920 --> 55:53.600]  currency again. Now the euro starts plunging Goldman Sachs is in there
[55:53.600 --> 56:00.320]  imploding Spain, Greece and several other nations. Ireland. The euro will be
[56:00.320 --> 56:03.280]  driven down the Toronto Commission said 20 years ago this was their plan build
[56:03.280 --> 56:06.840]  up several global currencies have them compete have instability and then call
[56:06.840 --> 56:11.240]  for a global regulatory group. Now they call the G 20 that will standardize and
[56:11.240 --> 56:14.240]  run everything in the name of stopping the crisis they created and then
[56:14.240 --> 56:20.120]  levying taxes on money transfers oil energy building everything that's their
[56:20.120 --> 56:25.200]  plan and it's now public they've launched it. This was never our opinion. What I
[56:25.200 --> 56:28.360]  talked about 14 years ago came true because I was reading what they said
[56:28.360 --> 56:36.080]  they would do. It's not hard. It's not hard. So of course the euro went down
[56:36.080 --> 56:40.720]  the dollar shot up and then the dollar plunged today because they'll all go
[56:40.720 --> 56:46.000]  down. You have the G 20 in a concerted operation devaluing currencies together
[56:46.000 --> 56:51.560]  which robs your savings and robs your purchasing power while they cut off your
[56:51.560 --> 56:56.120]  jobs and accelerate the industrialization under the quote green economy that is
[56:56.120 --> 57:01.200]  designed in their own internal documents to shut down our economy. So yes I say by
[57:01.200 --> 57:06.400]  gold and Ted Anderson when it went down to a thousand fifty dollars bought a bunch of it now
[57:06.400 --> 57:16.360]  it's gone up over seventy dollars to over a thousand one hundred and sixteen or
[57:16.360 --> 57:23.080]  gets us sixty five dollars and Ted has it sixty plus dollars under what the
[57:23.080 --> 57:26.840]  market is right now. Ted Anderson good to have you with us tell folks about today's
[57:26.840 --> 57:32.080]  gold offer quickly. Yeah Frank's currently right now at two forty nine sixty one. I
[57:32.080 --> 57:34.680]  know that people have been listening to the radio and they've been hearing me
[57:34.680 --> 57:39.840]  talk about this. This is at a thousand fifty dollar gold. My internet prices have
[57:39.840 --> 57:44.400]  already gone up actually two forty nine sixty one on the Frank if you just buy one
[57:44.400 --> 57:47.080]  of them I'm going to get you a full year subscription to the international
[57:47.080 --> 57:51.400]  forecaster which actually if you take that hundred and fifty nine dollars off of
[57:51.400 --> 57:55.080]  there it comes down down to be about four hundred and eighty dollars an ounce
[57:55.080 --> 57:59.040]  because this is a fifth of an ounce coin. I also have the British sovereign
[57:59.040 --> 58:02.960]  currently right now at three oh eight seventy six. I just think the walking
[58:02.960 --> 58:08.120]  Liberty half at eight forty four when they were ten bucks per coin here just a
[58:08.120 --> 58:12.160]  short time ago that is such a great buy at eight forty four there are hundred and
[58:12.160 --> 58:16.680]  sixty eight eighty a roll of twenty that's a good buy too. Eight hundred six
[58:16.680 --> 58:20.840]  eight six two three seven the brokers are there to take your call order one

[58:52.200 --> 58:56.400]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[58:56.400 --> 59:01.400]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[59:01.400 --> 59:05.000]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have a tremendous
[59:05.000 --> 59:10.080]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I
[59:10.080 --> 59:15.720]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of
[59:15.720 --> 59:20.360]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[59:24.760 --> 59:28.480]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists they're asking for more
[59:28.480 --> 59:32.440]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to. Today seems
[59:32.440 --> 59:38.080]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:32.400]  his first interviews since he had a very serious heart attack very thankful
[1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:36.720]  that he's covered to a great extent will be joining us talk about a host of
[1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:43.480]  issues former libertarian candidate for president for the libertarians that is
[1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:49.600]  coming up. We've got Webster Tarpley on how the neocons are saying 9-11 truth
[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:53.040]  is going to try to assassinate Obama what's really behind that I believe
[1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:57.520]  they're going to stage an attempted attack as a pretext for control and
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:00:59.880]  we'll talk about the attack on the second moment the last 30 minutes of the
[1:00:59.880 --> 1:01:03.440]  show I haven't even gotten into a lot of the financial news I mean to cover plus
[1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:06.920]  climategate completely imploding and now admit it's all complete fraud but
[1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:09.600]  they're not they don't care they're not backing off they submit okay it's all a
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:13.320]  fraud we're still taking your property kind of like all over the country hey
[1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:19.000]  your housing values gone down 20 30 40 50% in some cases but on average over 20
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.320]  we're still gonna raise your property taxes and if you don't pay we got men
[1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:25.800]  with guns they're gonna come take your stuff and throw it on the street but I'm
[1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:29.600]  going bankrupt I can't pay my bills there's all these toll roads now there's
[1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:33.160]  always new taxes there's all these cops writing tickets everywhere the illegal
[1:01:33.160 --> 1:01:37.760]  aliens are above the law we don't care we have guns we will use them you are
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:42.280]  now owned by the banks the banks are just robbing everyone everywhere it's in
[1:01:42.280 --> 1:01:46.400]  mainstream news they're engineering the crisis in Europe right now and all these
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:50.720]  fools cheer and go yay the euro's dropping those people are in the same
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:54.040]  boat as we are all the currencies are being manipulated and of course the
[1:01:54.040 --> 1:02:00.280]  dollar started then dropping and gold is shooting up right now you know how
[1:02:00.280 --> 1:02:03.880]  about gold was 300 bucks an ounce I didn't sell it when it hit a thousand I
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:09.120]  won't sell it drops to 800 because I know it's all manipulated I know they are
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:14.040]  devaluing currency so even in the midterm not even long term midterm it
[1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:18.680]  can only go up of the laws of real economics Ted Anderson do you agree
[1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:23.560]  well I most certainly do and you're talking about that bailout of Greece I
[1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:27.600]  mean who are we really bailing out and why in the world are we willing to
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:33.160]  stand by and give up our resources our revenues what we've labored for for
[1:02:33.160 --> 1:02:37.560]  Greece so we can support the EU it is all about the international base we're
[1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:41.920]  bailing them out no one record on a record in every country when you hear
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:45.720]  it's a bailout they put the people in those countries in more debt and the
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:48.600]  banks make the money on the way up with derivatives and then they get quote
[1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:52.520]  bailed out and get profit on the Ponzi scheme this would be like giving made
[1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:56.200]  off a hundred billion dollar bailout because he stole a hundred billion and
[1:02:56.200 --> 1:03:00.840]  letting him keep it that's exactly the analogy I was thinking of Alex I mean
[1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:04.960]  you said earlier that the banks have all the gold well how do you think they
[1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:09.280]  have the gold it's because they can print money from nothing and lend it to
[1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:13.680]  us at interest and we have to accept it through legal tender laws and service
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:18.440]  the interest on that debt we work our tailbones off for them we are their
[1:03:18.440 --> 1:03:22.640]  serves like it or not that's what's happened and they're the enemy and
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:26.520]  Glenn Becker Barack Obama aren't gonna save you they control both parties the
[1:03:26.520 --> 1:03:31.200]  bankers are the enemy bottom line understand that Ted again a free

[1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:17.160]  hour and eight minutes into the syndicated radio transmission on this
[1:08:17.160 --> 1:08:23.480]  Tuesday the 16th day of February 2010 the rest of the hour Michael Badnarik is
[1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:30.960]  our guest he of course was a libertarian a candidate for the libertarians he has
[1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:34.440]  given thousands of lectures around the country he's an author documentary
[1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:41.000]  filmmaker former GCN radio host and a few months ago he had a really serious
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:46.200]  heart attack while at a rally in Wisconsin trying to stop the banning of
[1:08:46.200 --> 1:08:51.440]  raw milk being sold I mean they're not just trying to keep marijuana illegal
[1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:55.840]  folks are trying to ban vitamins right now Canada is openly moving to do it so
[1:08:55.840 --> 1:08:59.760]  they're attacking all of our freedoms and he had a serious serious heart attack
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:04.800]  I already had a rough go of it but it was great to hear yesterday that he's doing
[1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:08.560]  a lot better now and so we're very honored to have him with us I want to
[1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:12.960]  talk about what happened with Michael but then also want to get into a whole
[1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:19.600]  host of other issues and how much ground the liberty movement the awakening to
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:24.720]  tyranny has gained climate-gain government health care in deep trouble
[1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:29.840]  the police state being exposed the TSA naked body scanners in deep trouble
[1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:35.520]  open talk of them being removed so many other positive things happening polls
[1:09:35.520 --> 1:09:41.880]  between 75 and 91% of people want to abolish or audit the Fed 10 years ago
[1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:45.440]  almost no one knew it was a private criminal group we're now identifying the
[1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:50.760]  real power structure and it's thanks to people like Michael Badnarik Michael
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:54.680]  joining us via video Skype back in the great state of Texas good to have you
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:10:03.800]  with us thank you so much don't close the casket yet I'm still alive well you
[1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:09.280]  look great watching you here on prisonplanet.tv Michael talk about
[1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:13.320]  talk about your ordeal and everybody's prayers and the donations and everything
[1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:21.880]  else well I was invited to Wisconsin to speak at a rally in favor of raw milk
[1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:26.880]  I've been drinking raw milk for about a year year and a half it is so much
[1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:30.880]  better than the stuff you can buy in the store it's also much healthier for you
[1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:36.560]  and as you said in the intro I mean it's not just marijuana or just heroin or
[1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:40.440]  cocaine that the government is trying to make illegal they're trying to make
[1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:46.600]  milk illegal something that humans have been drinking for literally centuries
[1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:52.600]  and so I went and spoke now most of it I don't remember the hospital gave me a
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:11:00.120]  combination of drugs that they lovingly refer to as milk of amnesia so most of
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:05.080]  the bad part I do not remember the doctors and nurses were really surprised
[1:11:05.080 --> 1:11:10.120]  however I wasn't supposed to be able to lift a finger and on several occasions
[1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:15.320]  I was sitting up in bed looking for my pants I guess I was hoping to leave and
[1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:20.800]  the doctors and nurses wanted to know what I was made out of my my friends the
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:25.720]  people who know me well were not surprised they know how dedicated I am
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:30.600]  especially when it comes to liberty the good news is that I went to Gunderson
[1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:35.240]  Lutheran Hospital in La Crosse Wisconsin I think it's the best hospital in the
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:41.080]  United States they took fantastic care of me and literally brought me back from
[1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:48.040]  the brink of death I want to thank them and I I'm back to a hundred percent my
[1:11:48.040 --> 1:11:53.000]  voice is good my energy is good and as long as I'm alive and able to breathe
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:57.080]  you know that I'm going to be lighting the fires of liberty and I want to
[1:11:57.080 --> 1:12:02.200]  thank you in particular for you know letting your listeners know what was
[1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:07.880]  going on my mother was touched that that you would do a little presentation to
[1:12:07.880 --> 1:12:12.000]  tell everybody about my status so I want to thank you I want to thank your
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:19.360]  listeners I am back to normal as far as I can tell and the one good thing for
[1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:26.480]  years I've been telling people that if I die liberty is no longer my problem and
[1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:31.760]  the lesson I hoped I was teaching was that everybody has to get involved on a
[1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:39.400]  personal basis this is your Constitution this is your Bill of Rights and now
[1:12:39.400 --> 1:12:43.600]  that I've had this heart attack people are understanding that and they are
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:48.800]  jumping on board so I think that we're going to see an even greater increase in
[1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:54.520]  the number of people who are helping us in the patriot movement well I don't want
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:12:57.920]  to dwell on it but we are blessed to have you here with us because talking to
[1:12:57.920 --> 1:13:02.480]  your family and others they say it was a really bad heart attack specifically if
[1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:05.680]  you don't mind telling us people are wondering what type of heart attack did
[1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:13.920]  you have Michael I had a 100% blockage I had a heart attack about 11 years ago on
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:19.880]  the backside of my heart which had affected the atrium say the top of the
[1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:25.680]  heart well that that's not as serious this one was and in front of the heart
[1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:30.640]  it directly affected the ventricles the part that actually pushed the blood
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:36.080]  through your body and well in the ambulance and at the hospital I was
[1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:42.360]  technically dead for about 10 minutes wow and I was on life support in a
[1:13:42.360 --> 1:13:49.880]  chemically induced coma for 16 days so I genuinely appreciate everybody's
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:57.800]  prayers and concern because it was a very serious thing and I am I'm just so
[1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:02.440]  grateful to still be here so that I can work with you and and all the other
[1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:07.640]  patriots here in Texas and across the country because we are we are going to
[1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:11.840]  restore this constitutional republic there's no doubt about that the only
[1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:15.720]  question is you know just how interesting and messy it's going to be
[1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:20.920]  between now and then well no doubt the prayers certainly help because I know a
[1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:25.000]  lot of people were praying for you Michael well my mother was thanking me
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:31.520]  personally she said if nothing else I brought a lot of people back to her to
[1:14:31.520 --> 1:14:38.240]  religion and faith because well I know at least two of my friends had started
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:43.560]  praying for me said that they hadn't prayed in over a decade and and it was
[1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:49.560]  my condition that that caused them to to get back into prayer so I I want to
[1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:53.880]  genuinely thank everybody who was concerned about me I know for a fact
[1:14:53.880 --> 1:14:58.600]  that that helped and and I think that my stubborn attitude had a little bit to
[1:14:58.600 --> 1:15:05.000]  do with the two absolutely but not among the living for 10 minutes but
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.920]  definitely you're the same Michael Bagnari we knew so it didn't hurt your
[1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:12.360]  brain too bad a true a true blessing and a miracle that you're that you're here
[1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:16.360]  with us today I want to talk about a host of issues with you and then have you
[1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:21.720]  back soon with us as well to you know cover more of the Constitution itself
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:30.120]  that you really are an amazing promoter and teacher of but looking at Texas
[1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:33.320]  obviously the second most popular state the second largest state
[1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:37.800]  geographically all over the country 30 plus states moving to declare 10th the
[1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:41.960]  9th Amendment powers nullifying the federal government that's been seized
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:45.640]  by offshore banks we're in the midst of the globalist takeover they're not
[1:15:45.640 --> 1:15:50.040]  denying world government anymore Debra Medina was gaining five points a week
[1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:54.200]  we'll soon get polls later in the week to see if this stage glenn beck event
[1:15:54.200 --> 1:15:59.160]  we've now talked to Medina's people she's coming on later uh sunday or monday
[1:15:59.160 --> 1:16:03.800]  one of those days it's clear that beck was cutting her audio off so she could
[1:16:03.800 --> 1:16:07.880]  understand even what she was saying she never really talked about 9 11 truth
[1:16:07.880 --> 1:16:10.920]  she said people have a right to their own opinions just like six of the 10
[1:16:10.920 --> 1:16:14.040]  commission members have said it's a cover up and
[1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:17.400]  farmer the head lawyer on it's written a book saying it was a criminal
[1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:22.520]  conspiracy and cover up but glenn beck the reason i talk a lot about him more
[1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:26.040]  and more is he they've positioned him as the leader of the patriot movement
[1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:29.800]  when he calls for a value added tax a sales tax to pay the bankers
[1:16:29.800 --> 1:16:32.840]  he calls for the reauthorization of the patriot act he called for the banker
[1:16:32.840 --> 1:16:37.320]  bailout takeover bill he attacks ron paul constantly but then too facially
[1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:41.880]  has him on and supports him but kind of giggles at him with disdain
[1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:45.240]  he's now savage deborah medina and the media is saying she's going to lose
[1:16:45.240 --> 1:16:47.880]  because of this i think they're just telling people she's a loser so they
[1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:51.320]  won't vote for i think she clearly will get into the run off and her numbers
[1:16:51.320 --> 1:16:55.320]  are still growing a lot of this backfired the the donations are more than
[1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:58.680]  doubled since this happened but you know specifically
[1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:02.760]  how important this deborah medina race is uh because you have a real patriot
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:08.120]  running not just some rhino republican name only like we saw in massachusetts
[1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:11.160]  taking the kennedy seat this was a bellwether event
[1:17:11.160 --> 1:17:16.680]  and we see him always at key moments showing he's a benedict arnold
[1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:21.080]  well i've been saying that glenn beck was controlled opposition
[1:17:21.080 --> 1:17:25.880]  for a long time i mean for a long time he was saying the right things but i
[1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:29.240]  said be careful because he's going to turn around
[1:17:29.240 --> 1:17:32.840]  and as many people have finally recognized the
[1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:37.160]  interview with deborah medina showed his true colors
[1:17:37.160 --> 1:17:40.840]  the good news and i'm always looking for the silver lining
[1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:46.840]  this is if they are attacking and savaging deborah medina you know that
[1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:51.800]  we are doing the right thing deborah has so much support here in texas
[1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:57.400]  she is gaining in the popularity polls people all over texas i have i have
[1:17:57.400 --> 1:18:00.600]  dozens of friends who are actively working
[1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:05.160]  on her campaign and we have an opportunity
[1:18:05.160 --> 1:18:09.400]  we have a real opportunity here in texas to show people the way
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:13.480]  the path to liberty by electing someone other
[1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:19.320]  than the democrats or republicans and and as you were talking earlier this
[1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:22.840]  drive for liberty and freedom is increasing
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:26.840]  and it's going to happen i'm hoping that it happens in this election
[1:18:26.840 --> 1:18:30.440]  i really hope that we elect deborah as our governor
[1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:33.400]  because uh... oklahoma is trying to elect
[1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:37.800]  uh... a liberty minded candidate and
[1:18:37.800 --> 1:18:41.960]  that will be the the first dominoes that will fall
[1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:45.560]  as we as we restore this public it's very very important
[1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:49.800]  well let me expand on that they tried to keep her out of the debates but people
[1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:53.400]  protested and got the word out so she got the debate she clearly won both of
[1:18:53.400 --> 1:18:57.320]  them and they will they saw that
[1:18:57.320 --> 1:19:01.560]  she was going to win gaining four to five points a week she was going to end up
[1:19:01.560 --> 1:19:04.920]  as of this week overtaking hutchinson next week overtaking perry
[1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:08.440]  into the main election early next month early voting begins of
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:13.000]  uh... in on friday so all of this is going on
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:16.680]  so they know it's a danger to come out the tacker because that elevates her
[1:19:16.680 --> 1:19:19.720]  but they did it from somebody we supposedly would trust
[1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:23.560]  a glenn beck a benedict arnold in our army
[1:19:23.560 --> 1:19:27.080]  and so again that shows how viable she is
[1:19:27.080 --> 1:19:31.640]  that they did this whole rumors of her demise have been greatly exaggerated
[1:19:31.640 --> 1:19:34.680]  and that's why i'm spending so much time on this is because beck
[1:19:34.680 --> 1:19:38.360]  has been positioned to engage in key sabotage
[1:19:38.360 --> 1:19:41.720]  at every juncture ron paul surging he says he may be a terrorist
[1:19:41.720 --> 1:19:45.320]  who wants to bomb buildings we need to use the army against ron paul supporters
[1:19:45.320 --> 1:19:49.960]  2007 madina surging about to lead the state's rights rebellion
[1:19:49.960 --> 1:19:53.640]  in comes in the enemy tie fighters blasting at her x-wing
[1:19:53.640 --> 1:19:56.760]  stay there michael bagner will continue to talk about the great awakening that's
[1:19:56.760 --> 1:20:00.040]  happening and a lot more we all know that the

[1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:44.360]  my website is constitutionpreservation.org and i want you to know that it
[1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:48.360]  just went live with a new design a half an hour ago
[1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:50.840]  just when i knew i was going to be on your program
[1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:53.960]  i uh i went ahead and went live with the new design
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:59.080]  should be prettier easier to navigate and and i'm very excited about it so it's
[1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:04.600]  constitutionpreservation.org well again good to have you here and of
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:07.080]  course the books and films and things you've made
[1:25:07.080 --> 1:25:11.160]  are all available there on the site as well you know so much to talk about
[1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:14.760]  michael i want to get into climate gait go over
[1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:19.080]  uh the swine flu fraud falling apart uh the banks
[1:25:19.080 --> 1:25:22.760]  robbing everybody that's now revealing the structure why the globalists are
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:25.640]  now admitting world government after decades of denying it
[1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:29.240]  but before we go there what does michael bagnaric want to talk about what's
[1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:32.680]  most important on your mind right now
[1:25:32.680 --> 1:25:37.160]  well i am really i'm probably lucky that i was in a coma
[1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:41.480]  when the atf shut down the gun show in austin
[1:25:41.480 --> 1:25:45.000]  because i probably would have had an adverse reaction to that
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:48.920]  um i want to make sure that we get that gun show back up and running
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:53.480]  someplace and i want everybody to know that 23 000 gun laws in the united
[1:25:53.480 --> 1:25:57.720]  states are unconstitutional because they directly
[1:25:57.720 --> 1:26:02.120]  infringe on your right to protect yourself your family your property
[1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:09.800]  and the atf is a federal agency that spends 900 million dollars
[1:26:09.800 --> 1:26:14.680]  almost a billion dollars a year trying to put gun dealers and gun owners out of
[1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:19.800]  business so i i can't let that happen in my backyard
[1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:23.960]  so uh that's my big issue i'm not sure exactly what we can do about it
[1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:28.920]  i know that people in austin have already had a huge rally to protest that
[1:26:28.920 --> 1:26:34.280]  that that's my personal hot button well absolutely and and i've been studying
[1:26:34.280 --> 1:26:37.080]  this you know we broke the story about the gun show had
[1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:41.080]  mr betty caron about what happened uh they did get a new location at the
[1:26:41.080 --> 1:26:43.400]  target center he's on in the last 30 minutes
[1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:47.880]  today to talk about that but it then came out that the feds did come in did
[1:26:47.880 --> 1:26:51.560]  basically order it the police tried to lie later admitted it when we pointed
[1:26:51.560 --> 1:26:54.920]  out they had no law and they said oh well we used a crack house
[1:26:54.920 --> 1:27:01.160]  nuisance abatement uh to shut it uh down and then we've also found out that
[1:27:01.160 --> 1:27:04.760]  clearly and i didn't believe this at first i had to see it i may cover it
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:09.080]  coming up the next few days clearly people working for the police and the
[1:27:09.080 --> 1:27:12.520]  adl are involved even in the austin pro gun movement
[1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:16.280]  trying to destabilize it and things and even go after me and it blew me even
[1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:19.640]  write articles how great the adl is and they're right about me being bad and
[1:27:19.640 --> 1:27:23.400]  you know staging these different events i mean it's getting really crazy
[1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:27.320]  which shows austin is a test ground
[1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:32.280]  uh example of what they want to do nationwide and obama announces you know
[1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:36.440]  earlier in the week they said look signing statements executive orders
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:39.800]  we're going to implement the carbon taxes regardless around congress we're
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:42.600]  going to implement government health care even if congress doesn't pass it
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:45.960]  we're going to implement amnesty even if the congress doesn't pass it i mean
[1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:50.120]  michael this is tyranny it's just getting worse and worse
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:54.040]  oh it is treason to an exponential degree
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:59.080]  and and it is it's because of this blatant tyranny
[1:27:59.080 --> 1:28:02.840]  that our fellow citizens are finally starting to wake up
[1:28:02.840 --> 1:28:08.520]  um i remember back in 1997 i met you for the first time we were
[1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:12.440]  participating in a rally at the state capitol i don't even remember what our
[1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:16.920]  issue was but you and i were trying to wake people up
[1:28:16.920 --> 1:28:23.400]  over 10 years ago and now finally the government is being so preposterous
[1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:26.840]  that the people who didn't believe us the people who thought that
[1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:30.920]  you and i were radical and extremist now they're starting to realize that
[1:28:30.920 --> 1:28:34.680]  that we were telling them the truth and they are now on board
[1:28:34.680 --> 1:28:39.000]  with this patriot movement so you know the government in a backhanded way
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:43.080]  is helping us to to wake the people up and to get them on our side
[1:28:43.080 --> 1:28:47.240]  well here's another example uh the national pose a toronto star last week
[1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:51.560]  reported in their headlines that pharmacies drug
[1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:56.040]  stores health food stores get notices stop selling all vitamins minerals and
[1:28:56.040 --> 1:29:02.280]  nutrients including vitamin c uh maliluca oil
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:09.960]  things like fish oil uh they listed uh things like uh
[1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:15.160]  oh what's the plant they use for burns aloe vera aloe vera yeah and and and
[1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:18.920]  they said under un treaty with codex alimentarius
[1:29:18.920 --> 1:29:22.360]  that was a huge wake-up call i mean this is really going on
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:26.280]  it really is and like i said you and i've been telling the people
[1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:30.200]  and they just didn't believe us they were in denial
[1:29:30.200 --> 1:29:34.440]  our government would never do anything like that the united states is the good
[1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:37.960]  guys you know congress would never well wake up
[1:29:37.960 --> 1:29:41.160]  ladies and gentlemen because they will they are

[1:31:01.240 --> 1:31:05.240]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[1:31:05.240 --> 1:31:09.000]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:12.600]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:31:12.600 --> 1:31:16.840]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:31:16.840 --> 1:31:20.520]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:24.920]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[1:31:24.920 --> 1:31:28.840]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[1:31:28.840 --> 1:31:32.440]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[1:31:32.440 --> 1:31:36.360]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[1:33:10.760 --> 1:33:15.240]  with michael bachnarik to illustrate
[1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:20.840]  the fact that the establishment is shooting blanks
[1:33:20.840 --> 1:33:24.520]  they still think this is 30 years ago where they control reality like carol
[1:33:24.520 --> 1:33:29.000]  robes said to a group of reporters
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:32.920]  we're going back to michael in a moment uh in fact i'll

[1:33:37.400 --> 1:33:40.360]  i want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio
[1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:43.640]  show possible one of them is the unbelievably
[1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:48.120]  fantastic that i use in my office and home a cola blue 28 and the cola blue
[1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:52.120]  30 those are the smaller units one puts it through seven filters the other
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:56.680]  through 12 i have the seven filter units
[1:33:56.680 --> 1:34:02.280]  reverse osmosis carbon uv filter and it grabs the water out of the air you
[1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:07.400]  cannot get cleaner better water a cola blue dot com
[1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:10.920]  it's a moisture evaporator it just grabs it right out of the air and then
[1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:14.600]  purifies it it's got a little high-tech computer system hot and cold water you
[1:34:14.600 --> 1:34:19.160]  name it just check it out at ec olo b l u e dot com
[1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:23.640]  a cola blue dot com or give me a call 800 6 9 1 60 43
[1:34:23.640 --> 1:34:28.120]  800 6 9 1 60 43 or keep drinking the government water or i guess trust the
[1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:31.960]  bottle water that's had so many problems uh it and plus it's the cheapest form of
[1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:35.160]  water uh you know they've got all the statistics on how
[1:34:35.160 --> 1:34:41.800]  inexpensive this is with the unit also i want to tell you about my solar backup
[1:34:41.800 --> 1:34:46.920]  have you lost your power wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on
[1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:50.040]  if so you should check out my solar backup dot com because there's never been a
[1:34:50.040 --> 1:34:52.920]  better time start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of
[1:34:52.920 --> 1:34:56.200]  electrical power here's why plug and play solar generators are now
[1:34:56.200 --> 1:34:59.080]  available from solutions from science have been available for about two years
[1:34:59.080 --> 1:35:02.600]  our listeners love them these portable power systems need no installation
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:06.280]  supply household current whenever or whenever you need it producing
[1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:08.360]  electricity from the sun directly from it
[1:35:08.360 --> 1:35:11.720]  unlike gas generators the solar generator runs quietly and amidst no fumes
[1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:14.920]  it's like having your own electric power plant is perfect for your home
[1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:18.520]  or your campsite whether it's hurricanes ice storms blackouts
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:22.840]  or brownouts uh you'll never have to suffer through

[1:35:45.400 --> 1:35:51.000]  you were in a coma for two weeks uh i mean it's just so good to have you here
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:54.680]  because we all just expect our friends and our colleagues people we admire to
[1:35:54.680 --> 1:35:57.480]  be here forever but i agree with you i realize how
[1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:01.160]  transitory life is there's been a few times in my life i've almost been
[1:36:01.160 --> 1:36:04.520]  killed and in a way it makes me be less
[1:36:04.520 --> 1:36:08.360]  fearful about death to just know it's coming and
[1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:12.440]  obviously you're going to be here for a long time i hope at some level you take
[1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:16.440]  it easy sometimes but i know in a way you probably you'll be
[1:36:16.440 --> 1:36:19.960]  let it be a hundred if you just keep fighting but i guess so it's kind of a
[1:36:19.960 --> 1:36:24.280]  catch 22 but it's just so good to have you here with us my friend
[1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:28.920]  well it is good to be here as a skydiving instructor i know
[1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:32.360]  that life is transitory we we have to take advantage
[1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:36.840]  of every moment that we are here and i highly recommend
[1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:39.560]  that you talk to your family your friends
[1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:43.080]  and tell them how much you love them how tell them
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:47.560]  how important they are in your life because you don't know
[1:36:47.560 --> 1:36:52.200]  when either they will you know disappear or when you will
[1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:55.240]  and the same is true for fighting for liberty
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:36:59.000]  don't postpone it don't do it next week or
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:03.560]  i'll go and get a power generator next month or when it's more convenient
[1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:09.240]  do it now we've got to go to a gun rally next year i'll go to city council and
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:13.240]  tell them don't bring in you and run carbon taxes no
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:17.720]  you got to do it now ladies and gentlemen absolutely now while you're
[1:37:17.720 --> 1:37:20.680]  still alive while you still have the energy
[1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:25.880]  and it it was my love of liberty that brought me back it was a little bit like
[1:37:25.880 --> 1:37:29.560]  i've been practicing football and now right before the super bowl i'm
[1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:33.400]  going to you know cash in my chips there's no way
[1:37:33.400 --> 1:37:36.840]  alex i love you but i'm not going to let you fight for liberty
[1:37:36.840 --> 1:37:41.000]  all by yourself i just have to be here and uh and
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:44.920]  help you out well you're a classy guy my friend and
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:48.120]  just you get better like fine wine as the years go
[1:37:48.120 --> 1:37:51.960]  i mean the great presentations the constitutional classes you give
[1:37:51.960 --> 1:37:54.600]  are you going to be giving any of those in the future
[1:37:54.600 --> 1:37:57.960]  absolutely i'm i'm kind of keeping it close to home
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:02.840]  as i recover i'll be teaching a class in farmers branch here in dallas
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:09.080]  on march 6th i'm coming to austin on march 13th and i'll be in
[1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:13.800]  fort worth on march 20th so anywhere here in texas
[1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:18.280]  you can go to my website constitutionpreservation.org
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:21.560]  to find out more information my phone numbers there
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:24.600]  you know just give me a call i'd love to have
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:27.640]  you know well michael i'm not going to tell you take it easy because i've read
[1:38:27.640 --> 1:38:30.440]  the statistics where a lot of people have a heart attack they take it easy and
[1:38:30.440 --> 1:38:33.960]  then they they die it seems be those that do keep doing
[1:38:33.960 --> 1:38:37.160]  stuff that you know that that recover because the body recognizes that sometimes
[1:38:37.160 --> 1:38:40.360]  you have a heart attack the body says well it's time to check out
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:43.800]  so obviously you're doing the right thing here but take it easy a little bit
[1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:46.760]  bro i mean i mean you just came out of a coma how
[1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:52.840]  many weeks ago uh... it's over is about a month now uh... it was uh...
[1:38:52.840 --> 1:38:57.960]  early january and i was in the hospital for an additional two weeks
[1:38:57.960 --> 1:39:02.040]  i when i finally opened my eyes my best friend was there
[1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:07.560]  and he said do you know who you are and i thought well that's pretty condescending
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:12.440]  of course i know and he says do you know what day it is
[1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:15.800]  and i was supposed to give a speech on december 21st
[1:39:15.800 --> 1:39:19.720]  and so i'm thinking well i don't know maybe december 22nd
[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:26.600]  and he says it is january 6th i said 2010
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:31.000]  yeah and so it was a little bit like discovering that you're adopted after
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:34.120]  you're 50 years old i mean it was just a shock
[1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:37.560]  i mean i had to sit there and evaluate that and go
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:43.080]  wow i said i missed christmas he said yeah you missed new years too
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:47.960]  so it was very serious and i am i am again thankful to everybody who showed
[1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:51.880]  their concern i've still got to get well cards that i really
[1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:56.200]  haven't had time to open but i just the most important thing
[1:39:56.200 --> 1:39:59.160]  is that i am back i am back with a vengeance
[1:39:59.160 --> 1:40:03.400]  and i'm getting back on the liberty trail as of march 6th well that's
[1:40:03.400 --> 1:40:07.400]  certainly fantastic michael but at the same time i was told that that you did
[1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:10.360]  it these heart problems run in the family
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:16.440]  if they do both of my grandfathers died early of heart attacks mom has had a
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:20.840]  quadruple bypass my youngest brother has had a
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:27.160]  pacemaker for 20 years and so the only solution really would be for me to
[1:40:27.160 --> 1:40:32.440]  select different parents at this time i don't i don't think that's possible
[1:40:32.440 --> 1:40:36.120]  i've been one of the reasons that i've recovered so quickly
[1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:39.080]  is because i was taking such good care of myself
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:42.200]  beforehand taking the fish oil taking the
[1:40:42.200 --> 1:40:47.560]  vitamin c um avoiding red meat you know i'd have a good steak every once in a
[1:40:47.560 --> 1:40:50.120]  while but you know eating fish and chicken and
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:56.440]  salad and and doing the exercise so it was all of that nutrition
[1:40:56.440 --> 1:41:01.080]  beforehand that allowed me to bounce back so quickly
[1:41:01.080 --> 1:41:05.400]  absolutely and so much is genetics uh now
[1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:08.920]  i want to go over an article here because i said i would do this yesterday
[1:41:08.920 --> 1:41:13.240]  and i didn't really do it and
[1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:17.960]  it's as if the heavens have opened up and and and drop lightning bolts on us
[1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:22.120]  but the lightning bolts bounce off at every level
[1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:26.440]  dirty tricks co until pro national media local media
[1:41:26.440 --> 1:41:30.520]  attacking me specifically but also others who were standing up for liberty
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:33.640]  because they're scared now they tried to ignore us before
[1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:37.160]  but two different newsweek articles attacking me and others
[1:41:37.160 --> 1:41:40.040]  in just the last week there's a big quasi
[1:41:40.040 --> 1:41:46.600]  hit piece coming out this week in um it's a it's a featured story in
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:50.280]  texas monthly so i'm wondering what that's going to be like but but the
[1:41:50.280 --> 1:41:53.480]  the issue is we're drawing their fire that means we're having an effect and
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:56.520]  maybe it's not going to be a hit piece i haven't read it yet but the point is
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:42:00.360]  um paul watson wrote a counter article to this
[1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:03.480]  yesterday it's up on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com
[1:42:03.480 --> 1:42:08.120]  newsweek powerful people do bad things too silly to discuss
[1:42:08.120 --> 1:42:13.960]  that's an actual quote and uh the articles titled that's our
[1:42:13.960 --> 1:42:17.720]  counter article titled know your conspiracy theories and i want to show
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:21.720]  people a document cam shot and i'm going to go over these and just get you
[1:42:21.720 --> 1:42:24.520]  to respond and and they mix in a few silly ones
[1:42:24.520 --> 1:42:29.480]  to try to give way to this now uh number two they say
[1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:34.200]  man-made global warming is a hoax anthropogenic global warming is a hoax
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:39.080]  and they go on to say there is no story there is no climate gate it doesn't
[1:42:39.080 --> 1:42:43.000]  exist it's completely insane even as look at this
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:46.280]  deck uh document cam shot folks if you're a radio listener go pull it up
[1:42:46.280 --> 1:42:50.120]  you turn to scientists at center of ral or argument
[1:42:50.120 --> 1:42:54.120]  uh admits there has been no global warming since 95 globally
[1:42:54.120 --> 1:42:57.160]  with the un with over 100 universities they concertedly
[1:42:57.160 --> 1:43:00.440]  fudged the numbers they've now been caught he now admits it because he knows
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:04.200]  he's facing criminal prosecution here's another one the continuing climate
[1:43:04.200 --> 1:43:09.400]  meltdown here's another one uh science blogger finds errors and met
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:12.760]  office climate change records is every facility lying
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:18.680]  warming meltdown uh it goes on and on and then what's the answer from
[1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:21.720]  newsweek it's as if a 10 year old wrote this
[1:43:21.720 --> 1:43:26.280]  saying my daddy can beat up your daddy i mean or or as if saying
[1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:30.200]  that the sun doesn't come up in the morning they just say it doesn't
[1:43:30.200 --> 1:43:34.200]  exist and that our claim that a global government is being established
[1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:38.280]  through this doesn't exist that's what the un said at copenhagen
[1:43:38.280 --> 1:43:42.680]  i mean i mean how dumb do they think we are to to say know your conspiracies
[1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:46.440]  guide to today's trendiest hippest and least likely fringe police
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:51.320]  and it's full of just mainline stuff i mean don't they know this is political
[1:43:51.320 --> 1:43:54.520]  suicide or are they just speaking to their tiny
[1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:57.560]  audience they've got left as their circulation plummets
[1:43:57.560 --> 1:44:01.880]  across the board and and and just have such disdain for the average newsweek
[1:44:01.880 --> 1:44:04.280]  reader that they tell them this doesn't exist i mean
[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:07.880]  is this a miscalculation what is this michael
[1:44:07.880 --> 1:44:11.960]  i think it's an effort to spin people around five or six times
[1:44:11.960 --> 1:44:16.280]  and get them dizzy so they don't know what to think
[1:44:16.280 --> 1:44:22.040]  you know the best lies are significantly true
[1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:25.400]  and what happens in people's thought process
[1:44:25.400 --> 1:44:28.920]  if i meet you for the first time alex and you tell me
[1:44:28.920 --> 1:44:34.280]  ten things that i know are true eventually i go this alex jones guy is a
[1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:40.360]  really good guy and i stop analyzing i i mean most people will just say
[1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:45.720]  okay alex is a good guy from now on whatever alex says i assume to be true
[1:44:45.720 --> 1:44:50.120]  that's what they did with glenn beck glenn beck got on the radio and the
[1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:54.280]  television and for a long time he was he sounded
[1:44:54.280 --> 1:44:58.200]  like he was on our side and what they were doing is they wanted glenn beck to
[1:44:58.200 --> 1:45:01.960]  establish credibility so now that everybody's on
[1:45:01.960 --> 1:45:06.120]  the glenn beck uh you know bandwagon that's when he is
[1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:09.720]  established our trust and that's when he can turn around
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:13.720]  and savage debra madina and make it sound like you know
[1:45:13.720 --> 1:45:17.560]  she has no chance so what we need to do
[1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:21.800]  as people is to question everything think
[1:45:21.800 --> 1:45:25.080]  you've your parents taught you the difference between right and wrong
[1:45:25.080 --> 1:45:28.680]  yeah i mean that's why i tell people to always check out all the co until pro
[1:45:28.680 --> 1:45:32.520]  lies about me we are not owned by abc we have nothing to do
[1:45:32.520 --> 1:45:36.520]  with abc years ago we leased a radio feed which anybody in radio does
[1:45:36.520 --> 1:45:40.920]  we now have another one uh i am not owned by saudi arabians i am not owned by
[1:45:40.920 --> 1:45:44.200]  the brothans i've never met a brothman no connection to brothans
[1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:48.520]  but the establishment like cast sunstein the winehouse says
[1:45:48.520 --> 1:45:53.080]  they operate and poses us and i've always noticed these dis info sites
[1:45:53.080 --> 1:45:56.840]  come out for a year there's no infighting there's no nothing that they
[1:45:56.840 --> 1:46:00.440]  they create a rapport that's what government agents do at any level
[1:46:00.440 --> 1:46:05.160]  that's what you know anti drug agents do and then they launch their operation
[1:46:05.160 --> 1:46:09.240]  once they think they have people's credibility and they make up stories
[1:46:09.240 --> 1:46:15.080]  about you know cheney's been arrested or alex jones is a reptoid or they mix
[1:46:15.080 --> 1:46:19.000]  bigfoot in and they know what they're doing
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:22.520]  absolutely and it's just you know supports what i said
[1:46:22.520 --> 1:46:26.360]  people will be critical they'll be suspicious
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:30.840]  up to a certain point and then they drop their defenses and after that
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:36.280]  you know they just pretty much assume that that people are credible uh you
[1:46:36.280 --> 1:46:40.520]  can't i mean if you're going to be a trader you got to infiltrate you've
[1:46:40.520 --> 1:46:45.320]  got to look like you know your friend and then once you get
[1:46:45.320 --> 1:46:49.080]  inside the the defenses then you can destroy it
[1:46:49.080 --> 1:46:53.480]  so we we need to have people continue to do critical
[1:46:53.480 --> 1:46:59.480]  thinking figure it out for yourself yeah but how dumbed i mean but with news
[1:46:59.480 --> 1:47:02.600]  week it it's so ridiculous like they have another
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:06.120]  article and they say alex jones is the prophet of the tea parties
[1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:09.640]  and he makes up this wild story that they want a global government with the
[1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:14.520]  carbon taxes and i mean it that's it's all on record in the
[1:47:14.520 --> 1:47:17.160]  treaty with all the world leaders saying it
[1:47:17.160 --> 1:47:20.280]  well i mean what is the psychological tactic to
[1:47:20.280 --> 1:47:24.520]  admit they're doing it but then say it's insane it doesn't exist
[1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:29.400]  i i really don't know the people who are trying to take over the world
[1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:35.080]  they have such weird philosophies that i mean trying to figure out how they
[1:47:35.080 --> 1:47:39.640]  think or what they think is it hurts you know my brain
[1:47:39.640 --> 1:47:43.240]  doesn't work like that i agree with you you and i
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:46.600]  you and i believe in individual rights and private property
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:51.640]  everybody should make that and it boggles our minds
[1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:55.080]  to assume that someone would try to commit murder
[1:47:55.080 --> 1:48:01.160]  or try to steal your property or try to control the world and i think that's
[1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:04.760]  it that's what the globalist count on here's number three from the
[1:48:04.760 --> 1:48:09.160]  article goldman sacks intentionally created the economic crises
[1:48:09.160 --> 1:48:12.440]  and then they give credit to matt tebe who were reported on it years after we
[1:48:12.440 --> 1:48:16.520]  did at rolling stone and then just basically says none of it's true
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:20.520]  when we have a five part series with the internal emails of goldman sacks
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:26.200]  from uh major publications what was the five part series i'm having one of
[1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:29.640]  those moments it was uh what was the five part
[1:48:29.640 --> 1:48:33.400]  series we uh yeah mclatchy news service i have one of
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:37.480]  those moments there confirming it was premeditated and now it's come out
[1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:41.880]  they engineered iceland and greece that's in loyters today
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:46.200]  so of course the banks engineered this and here's newsweek saying goldman sacks
[1:48:46.200 --> 1:48:50.920]  nothing to do with this well it's a last ditch effort
[1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:53.880]  on their part the liberty movement is growing
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:57.560]  we've got the two parties the nine twelves the libertarian party
[1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:01.560]  constitution party all of these groups getting together
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:06.680]  and well all of these groups moving forward not necessarily together
[1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:10.440]  and the bad guys are just struggling to keep
[1:49:10.440 --> 1:49:15.320]  that small percentage confused you know your listeners know the truth
[1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:18.920]  the people who take my class cannot be confused
[1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:22.920]  it's just a couple of those people who are still in doubt
[1:49:22.920 --> 1:49:27.880]  will read this article and go well i'm just not going to worry about it
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:32.280]  you know and they just won't try to to figure things out
[1:49:32.280 --> 1:49:35.560]  well here's another one because we have tens of thousands of listeners every
[1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:38.760]  day so i'm talking to them as well and for our listeners
[1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:41.640]  to go out and wake up people around them that have been dumbed down
[1:49:41.640 --> 1:49:45.080]  and lied to number four democratic health plan
[1:49:45.080 --> 1:49:48.840]  will create death panels and then it goes in to say that's not true
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:52.520]  it it does create a government bureaucracy
[1:49:52.520 --> 1:49:55.800]  and tom daschle's own book said it where they will restrict health care to
[1:49:55.800 --> 1:49:59.160]  people that are above 60 and in europe they've done this
[1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:03.080]  and it it is a bioethicist death panel newsweek's
[1:50:03.080 --> 1:50:06.920]  own publication had the case for killing granny
[1:50:06.920 --> 1:50:11.560]  saying go ahead and kill grandma so i mean hey again it's like the schizophrenia
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:14.120]  where they say we want to kill your grandma but we're not saying that it
[1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:18.840]  doesn't exist well at some point i think that they
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:23.080]  are so delusional that they start to believe their own hype
[1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:25.960]  i mean they are they are coming apart at the seams
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:29.720]  the only thing we have that is necessary for us
[1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:33.960]  is just to not give up liberty will be restored
[1:50:33.960 --> 1:50:39.160]  we are moving forward and you know the only way that we can lose
[1:50:39.160 --> 1:50:43.720]  is if we decide if we start to doubt ourselves and we've gained a lot of
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:47.480]  ground i got webster tarply coming up at the eight after next hour

[1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:35.240]  saying the u.s. government will stage a terror attack in the u.s.
[1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:39.160]  to blame it on you you better do what we say then we are change interviewed him
[1:54:39.160 --> 1:54:42.280]  he admitted it after they could read the quotes to him he first lied and
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:44.680]  denied it and then he published it in the
[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:49.320]  huffington post but here's another one time magazine
[1:54:49.320 --> 1:54:53.880]  wants to restrict internet to licensed users time and concert with pro
[1:54:53.880 --> 1:54:57.480]  censorship groups is backing a plan that would require a licensed i.e.
[1:54:57.480 --> 1:55:01.160]  government sanction for people to get on the internet proponents
[1:55:01.160 --> 1:55:05.240]  radio host a conspiracy junkie alex jones
[1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:09.320]  kernel of truth time published a story reporting on microsoft executive at a
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:12.360]  un devos meeting who'd like to see licensing to combat
[1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:15.720]  anonymity which the white house and cast sunstein called for and which time
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:21.560]  magazine said was good i mean this is crazy so
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:25.000]  they even here say they say this is happening but yeah we are kind of
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:28.840]  calling for it but still alex jones is a junkie i mean it's just
[1:55:28.840 --> 1:55:32.840]  it's just idiocy it shows their contempt for the general public and i agree
[1:55:32.840 --> 1:55:35.400]  with you i think they're delusional i think they've
[1:55:35.400 --> 1:55:39.880]  got so much put spa or arrogance or bravada that they don't understand what's
[1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:43.000]  happening michael when i say liberties on fire
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  every major globalist agenda is crashing and burning right now
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:50.760]  i'm worried about false flag stage terror attacks
[1:55:50.760 --> 1:55:56.440]  what's your take on that yes i gosh i wish i didn't agree with you
[1:55:56.440 --> 1:56:01.160]  but they probably will do something people are gonna die
[1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:06.760]  they're gonna try to terrify us into you know following the government
[1:56:06.760 --> 1:56:10.840]  anytime there's this you know like the world trade center coming down
[1:56:10.840 --> 1:56:14.440]  you know a significant portion of the public will turn to the government
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:20.920]  to go protect us save us help us and i i don't think that's going to be as
[1:56:20.920 --> 1:56:24.520]  prevalent but yeah you're right they will probably do
[1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:27.800]  something kill people in america but
[1:56:27.800 --> 1:56:31.320]  but i think that most of our patriots fellow patriots
[1:56:31.320 --> 1:56:35.640]  will recognize it for what it is and and that will be
[1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:39.080]  their moment that they jump on board we
[1:56:39.080 --> 1:56:43.960]  we are going to restore this republic well i agree i mean look at kurt haskell
[1:56:43.960 --> 1:56:47.240]  with the underwear bomber and his wife and other witnesses
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:51.080]  they are really not 11 truthers i mean they've admitted that
[1:56:51.080 --> 1:56:54.280]  but they like to keep that someone in the lowdowns of the media doesn't make too
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:57.800]  big an issue out of it and they called them liars and then later it came out
[1:56:57.800 --> 1:57:01.480]  it was all true the u.s government ordered him to be allowed on that plane
[1:57:01.480 --> 1:57:05.880]  that's mainstream news because we now have our people everywhere
[1:57:05.880 --> 1:57:08.680]  watching them
[1:57:09.560 --> 1:57:13.800]  i i agree and i strongly recommend that your listeners
[1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:16.920]  walk around with a video camera because you never know
[1:57:16.920 --> 1:57:20.680]  where you're going to see tyranny manifested you know we do live in a
[1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:25.080]  totalitarian police state that that's obvious to anybody who's got their eyes
[1:57:25.080 --> 1:57:28.680]  open naked body scanners violate child porn
[1:57:28.680 --> 1:57:32.040]  laws in the u.s canada england they're putting them in chard
[1:57:32.040 --> 1:57:35.400]  offs making money off of it who made the order a year and a half ago
[1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:40.840]  obama's continuing it clearly an act of domination a way to make us submit
[1:57:40.840 --> 1:57:43.960]  and now they've been caught lying saying they don't record your naked bodies i
[1:57:43.960 --> 1:57:48.440]  mean when does government not lie well i don't know

[1:57:51.160 --> 1:57:55.240]  and there are very few instances of that so
[1:57:55.240 --> 1:57:58.520]  yeah i i am concerned about those as well
[1:57:58.520 --> 1:58:03.080]  i mean personally i don't care they they take a photo of my body but i think it
[1:58:03.080 --> 1:58:10.040]  is a violation of everybody's prop privacy and we need to put an end to it
[1:58:10.040 --> 1:58:13.800]  absolutely we predicted that start videotaping tv and movie stars and now
[1:58:13.800 --> 1:58:17.400]  it's been confirmed that's happening the british government tried to lie about
[1:58:17.400 --> 1:58:19.960]  it first and got caught i mean it's just amazing

[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:39.720]  in the liberty movement um you know get to know your neighbors
[2:01:39.720 --> 2:01:43.400]  throw a little barbecue as soon as it warms up get to know your neighbors
[2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:46.040]  those are the people that you're going to need to rely on
[2:01:46.040 --> 2:01:49.960]  you know if the electricity goes out or you know when
[2:01:49.960 --> 2:01:53.960]  there's a little bit of social unrest you need to know who you can trust
[2:01:53.960 --> 2:01:58.440]  and you need to get involved with your neighbors now stock up on food
[2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:02.040]  get one of the solar power generators that
[2:02:02.040 --> 2:02:07.560]  alex advertises you need to be prepared and then you need to know the truth
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:11.480]  so you know continue listening to alex alex's program
[2:02:11.480 --> 2:02:15.240]  and if you'd like to take my class you can find out all you need
[2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:20.440]  at constitutionpreservation.org
[2:02:20.440 --> 2:02:25.000]  and when we get up here and we say we're winning we're having success
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:28.440]  i mean not ten years ago i was saying we're doomed if people don't wake up
[2:02:28.440 --> 2:02:31.160]  we're i mean i don't just get up here in cheerlead
[2:02:31.160 --> 2:02:34.600]  look at all the evidence look at the success we're having
[2:02:34.600 --> 2:02:38.040]  that's why it's more important than ever that people that were fighting five
[2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:41.400]  ten fifteen twenty years ago and then quit
[2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:46.360]  all that work dated decades ago is now bearing fruit but now
[2:02:46.360 --> 2:02:50.840]  make hay while the sun's shining people's minds are fertile to be unlocked
[2:02:50.840 --> 2:02:55.800]  now i mean there is a awakening that's terrifying the globalist
[2:02:55.800 --> 2:02:59.560]  and they're so greedy that the banks are openly robbing the planet but they're
[2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:03.080]  now revealed i mean this is so positive in closing
[2:03:03.080 --> 2:03:06.440]  why do you think they've gone public with world government after denying it
[2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:10.040]  i mean i guess we're just to that point now it's time for them to admit it
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:13.800]  i think their window of opportunity is closing
[2:03:13.800 --> 2:03:17.320]  you know if if you're a farmer and you've got all the animals
[2:03:17.320 --> 2:03:22.040]  inside the corral you don't have to rush because there's no way that the animals
[2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:25.880]  can escape but if there's an open gate
[2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:29.240]  someplace where the animals get out you've got to run
[2:03:29.240 --> 2:03:33.560]  and try to close that gate to trap all the animals
[2:03:33.560 --> 2:03:38.040]  and i think from their point of view they do not have things
[2:03:38.040 --> 2:03:42.120]  you know completely in hand otherwise there'd be no reason for them
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:46.600]  to rush to try to push this through as quickly as possible
[2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:50.840]  and i believe that it is especially because we are waking up
[2:03:50.840 --> 2:03:55.400]  uh i can't can't even estimate how many people you've brought
[2:03:55.400 --> 2:03:58.520]  uh woke up with your programs and your videos
[2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:02.760]  uh when i was at home recovering with my parents uh my mother and i
[2:04:02.760 --> 2:04:07.480]  watched the fall of the republic and and she sat on the edge of the couch
[2:04:07.480 --> 2:04:11.000]  with her mouth oh but i i have to confess i kept pushing pause
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:15.880]  to go see i told you i told you and then we'd push play again
[2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:18.920]  well i want to interview you i keep meaning to do this
[2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:22.840]  for the next fall of the republic so perhaps when you do come to austin you
[2:04:22.840 --> 2:04:26.200]  can come a day early and uh i can get you a hotel room
[2:04:26.200 --> 2:04:29.400]  a day early and then we can come interview maybe go to dinner that way
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:33.320]  i would want to be a distraction at your event there might be some co until pro
[2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:35.240]  show up and say i'm not supposed to be there
[2:04:35.240 --> 2:04:39.160]  but uh i'm serious it's it's unbelievable they're all over me
[2:04:39.160 --> 2:04:42.760]  michael bagnaric i really appreciate you joining us
[2:04:42.760 --> 2:04:45.880]  let me say bye to you during the break webster tarfley's coming up after i play
[2:04:45.880 --> 2:04:49.480]  a four minute clip of ron paul on the economic implosion in europe
[2:04:49.480 --> 2:04:53.400]  webster tarfley with key info straight ahead michael bagnaric we love you you're
[2:04:53.400 --> 2:04:57.160]  awesome you are too alex thanks this is alex
[2:04:57.160 --> 2:05:01.000]  jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:04.920]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:09.240]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[2:05:09.240 --> 2:05:13.160]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[2:05:13.160 --> 2:05:16.680]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:05:16.680 --> 2:05:20.360]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:05:20.360 --> 2:05:23.800]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:05:23.800 --> 2:05:27.560]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:30.520]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[2:05:30.520 --> 2:05:34.280]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[2:05:34.280 --> 2:05:37.160]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[2:05:37.160 --> 2:05:40.280]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[2:05:40.280 --> 2:05:43.000]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:48.200]  information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[2:05:48.200 --> 2:05:52.360]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[2:05:52.360 --> 2:05:58.040]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[2:05:58.040 --> 2:06:01.320]  hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs
[2:06:01.320 --> 2:06:04.680]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal
[2:06:04.680 --> 2:06:08.280]  silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[2:06:08.280 --> 2:06:12.200]  by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the
[2:06:12.200 --> 2:06:15.560]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses
[2:06:15.560 --> 2:06:19.000]  the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:23.400]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers
[2:06:23.400 --> 2:06:27.000]  the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:31.080]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products
[2:06:31.080 --> 2:06:34.600]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[2:06:34.600 --> 2:06:39.080]  with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions
[2:06:39.080 --> 2:06:41.960]  are provided making production fast and simple
[2:06:41.960 --> 2:06:47.320]  go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[2:06:47.320 --> 2:06:54.360]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[2:06:54.360 --> 2:07:01.320]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:04.520]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[2:07:04.520 --> 2:07:08.520]  as we're finishing off this agenda we'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:11.720]  americans at home i have tremendous influence
[2:07:11.720 --> 2:07:15.720]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[2:07:15.720 --> 2:07:21.000]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:24.920]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[2:07:24.920 --> 2:07:28.600]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:07:28.600 --> 2:07:31.000]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:34.920]  tim geithner, bernanke and arsonists they're asking for more matches
[2:07:34.920 --> 2:07:37.400]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[2:07:37.400 --> 2:07:41.800]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[2:07:41.800 --> 2:07:47.000]  we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic on
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:52.040]  dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super
[2:07:52.040 --> 2:07:55.800]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[2:07:55.800 --> 2:08:00.120]  hello this is brawn paul with your weekly update for february 15th
[2:08:00.120 --> 2:08:03.800]  last week we were reminded that ours is not the only country suffering from
[2:08:03.800 --> 2:08:07.880]  severe economic turmoil the greek government is the latest to come
[2:08:07.880 --> 2:08:12.440]  close to default on their massive public debt greece has insufficient funds in
[2:08:12.440 --> 2:08:15.880]  their treasury to make even the minimum payments
[2:08:15.880 --> 2:08:21.160]  that are now coming due their debt level is about 120 of their gross domestic
[2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:26.280]  product and their public sector absorbs what amounts to 40 of gdp
[2:08:26.280 --> 2:08:30.040]  any talk of cutting costs and spending is met with violent protests from the
[2:08:30.040 --> 2:08:33.160]  many greecs heavily dependent on government payments
[2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:36.920]  mounting fears of default have sent shockwaves through their creditors and
[2:08:36.920 --> 2:08:41.080]  all of the eurozone countries but there have been statements made by the
[2:08:41.080 --> 2:08:44.840]  european central bank to calm fears and give assurances that greece
[2:08:44.840 --> 2:08:49.080]  will get the aid it needs details of agreements are not
[2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:53.080]  forthcoming is it possible that our federal reserve has had
[2:08:53.080 --> 2:08:58.600]  some hand in bailing out greece the fact is we don't know and current laws
[2:08:58.600 --> 2:09:01.640]  exempt agreements between the fed and foreign central banks
[2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:06.440]  from disclosure or audit greece is only in the latest in a series of countries
[2:09:06.440 --> 2:09:10.680]  that have faced this type of crisis in recent memory
[2:09:10.680 --> 2:09:13.400]  not too long ago the same types of fears
[2:09:13.400 --> 2:09:17.560]  were mounting about dubai and before that iceland
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:21.560]  several other countries spain portugal ireland
[2:09:21.560 --> 2:09:26.360]  lasvia are approaching crisis level with public debt as well
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:30.680]  many have strong ties to golden sacks and the case could easily be made that
[2:09:30.680 --> 2:09:34.280]  default could have serious implications for big
[2:09:34.280 --> 2:09:39.880]  us banking cartels considering the ties between the fed and these big banks
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:43.880]  it's not outlandish to wonder if the u.s taxpayer is secretly
[2:09:43.880 --> 2:09:46.520]  bailing out the entire world country by country
[2:09:46.520 --> 2:09:50.840]  even as our real unemployment tops 20 percent
[2:09:50.840 --> 2:09:55.000]  unless laws are changed to allow a complete and meaningful audit of the
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:58.280]  federal reserve including its agreements with foreign central banks
[2:09:58.280 --> 2:10:02.440]  we might never know if this is occurring or not
[2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:06.280]  this global financial crisis is a predictable result of secretive
[2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:10.280]  central banking and unsound fiat currency
[2:10:10.280 --> 2:10:13.640]  governments are entirely committed to this system of fiat money and fraction
[2:10:13.640 --> 2:10:18.280]  reserve banking for obvious reasons it enables them to do what they love
[2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:21.480]  most spend hordes of money with near impunity
[2:10:21.480 --> 2:10:25.400]  without the limitations of sound money governments will spend without limit
[2:10:25.400 --> 2:10:29.000]  they will spend money to hire their cronies pay off special interest give
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.520]  out favors create dependence and generally distract
[2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:36.360]  from the terrible job that they do as their chief mandate
[2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:39.880]  which is to protect the liberties of the people
[2:10:39.880 --> 2:10:43.480]  fiat money is a blame check to government which is very dangerous and
[2:10:43.480 --> 2:10:46.520]  we are witnessing the death row of the system
[2:10:46.520 --> 2:10:51.160]  as the bills come due and the underlying capital
[2:10:51.160 --> 2:10:57.000]  is squandered away because of our globe straddling empire
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:01.960]  and lingering reserve currency status perhaps no one has a more vested interest
[2:11:01.960 --> 2:11:05.320]  in keeping the system cobbled together than our own government and the federal
[2:11:05.320 --> 2:11:08.440]  reserve the agreements that iceland and
[2:11:08.440 --> 2:11:11.880]  dubai and greece have negotiated can amount to a little more
[2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:15.800]  than kicking the king down the road as their overall spending habits remain
[2:11:15.800 --> 2:11:19.560]  largely intact fiat currencies are still legal tender
[2:11:19.560 --> 2:11:23.880]  and more debt is issued on top of unsustainable debt
[2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:27.320]  the american people have the right to know if they are going to be the ones
[2:11:27.320 --> 2:11:30.040]  holding the bag in the end because the federal reserve
[2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:34.840]  secretly put them on the hook for it this knowledge would be a key factor in
[2:11:34.840 --> 2:11:40.360]  peacefully dismantling this immoral and unconstitutional system
[2:11:40.360 --> 2:11:43.800]  thanks for calling this update a new update is based on this number
[2:11:43.800 --> 2:11:48.520]  888-322 okay ladies and gentlemen that's ron paul we're going to be talking
[2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:52.120]  about the complete economic meltdown that's clearly happening
[2:11:52.120 --> 2:11:56.680]  sales tax revenues property tax revenues all plunging
[2:11:56.680 --> 2:12:00.520]  the next big crisis now beginning in commercial real estate as shops where i
[2:12:00.520 --> 2:12:04.120]  live shut down everywhere many shopping centers even in middle
[2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:07.720]  class areas are half empty poor areas it's even worse
[2:12:07.720 --> 2:12:10.840]  i want to go over that coming up in about 30 minutes with webster griffin
[2:12:10.840 --> 2:12:15.800]  tarpoli who is an economist a phd of history as well
[2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:19.320]  uh... doctor of history and we really appreciate
[2:12:19.320 --> 2:12:23.720]  him joining us we sell all four of his published books nine eleven synthetic
[2:12:23.720 --> 2:12:28.040]  terror his two books on obama his economic cataclysm book they're all
[2:12:28.040 --> 2:12:31.960]  invaluable and discounted at info wars dot com and you may
[2:12:31.960 --> 2:12:34.120]  know all this stuff or may think you know at all
[2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:37.560]  you learn a lot reading tarpoli's books get them give them to other folks
[2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:41.960]  every mind you unlock is one step closer to bringing down the new world order
[2:12:41.960 --> 2:12:45.400]  believing that these people aren't invincible is half the battle
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:48.840]  knowing who the enemy is ladies and gentlemen is half the battle taking
[2:12:48.840 --> 2:12:53.160]  action as the rest now uh... we're gonna tarpoli in a moment i first
[2:12:53.160 --> 2:12:56.440]  want to read from some of this article
[2:12:56.440 --> 2:13:02.040]  i thought of tarpoli over the weekend as i was doing research
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:05.480]  because i had remembered months ago when they had the gate crashes at the
[2:13:05.480 --> 2:13:09.800]  winehouse and they talked about how that he wasn't safe in the winehouse
[2:13:09.800 --> 2:13:13.000]  and tarpoli tied it in with some other news i've learned to respect what he
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:16.120]  has to say is piercing understanding
[2:13:16.120 --> 2:13:20.520]  he said these were threats to obama and that they were opening the public
[2:13:20.520 --> 2:13:23.720]  mind and and creating kind of a track
[2:13:23.720 --> 2:13:27.080]  that obama is going to be assassinated there's already been a huge
[2:13:27.080 --> 2:13:31.640]  you know discussion of this in the media then i started seeing shan hanity
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:35.880]  and other neocon mouthpieces like glenn beck saying nine eleven truthers
[2:13:35.880 --> 2:13:39.880]  will try to kill obama now nine eleven truthers
[2:13:39.880 --> 2:13:43.960]  are against violence nine eleven truthers expose false flag
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:48.440]  nine eleven truthers expose obama as a puppet
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:52.920]  they're nonpartisan it's been proven under bush they said we were liberals
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:55.160]  now under obama they say we're right wingers
[2:13:55.160 --> 2:13:58.040]  and they talk about oh my gosh deborah medina might be a nine eleven truther
[2:13:58.040 --> 2:14:02.200]  and the democratic candidate in texas is openly questioning nine eleven it's
[2:14:02.200 --> 2:14:05.000]  like everybody is and the polls show that
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:08.680]  and so depending on the poll 36 percent to 84 percent they
[2:14:08.680 --> 2:14:12.440]  they vary widely and angus and reed and gallop and and and
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:16.120]  script tower news service polls but let's say 50 percent let's take the
[2:14:16.120 --> 2:14:19.160]  medium you know i mean let's take the middle here
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:22.520]  when they try to stage an attack on the christmas day you got nine eleven
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:24.680]  truthers people that are tuned in on board
[2:14:24.680 --> 2:14:28.120]  they notice he was led on protected somebody else had a bomb
[2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:31.560]  the fb i says they're liars month later it comes out the fb i versus their
[2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:33.560]  story okay we helped him get on the plane
[2:14:33.560 --> 2:14:36.360]  you know as a part of an intelligence operation we'll talk about that with
[2:14:36.360 --> 2:14:39.320]  tarply as well we may be a little bit in the
[2:14:39.320 --> 2:14:43.240]  next hour because i'm getting too late here but
[2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:45.640]  again there's so much data that goes into this i'm always trying to give
[2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:50.760]  listeners a picture of my mind and my understanding but
[2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:54.280]  then when i saw glenn beck starts saying on the radio and tv the last three
[2:14:54.280 --> 2:14:58.680]  weeks and i'm just spot checking him and i i tune in he calls for a new value
[2:14:58.680 --> 2:15:02.440]  added tax a new sales tax to pay the bankers another bailout
[2:15:02.440 --> 2:15:06.920]  uh i tune in he's for the patriot act i tune in same thing with o riley
[2:15:06.920 --> 2:15:09.880]  uh nine eleven truthers want to kill the president
[2:15:09.880 --> 2:15:13.320]  no evidence they're just saying this who's their number one enemy according to
[2:15:13.320 --> 2:15:16.840]  white house uh regulations are that obama's now
[2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:21.160]  operating under saying he'll just use executive orders to circumvent everything
[2:15:21.160 --> 2:15:24.840]  nine nine eleven truthers what is north common homeland security say their big
[2:15:24.840 --> 2:15:28.040]  enemy is christians conservatives returning veterans gun owners nine
[2:15:28.040 --> 2:15:34.360]  eleven truthers in the fetters people that are awake populist constitutionalist
[2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:39.000]  and so i see them openly saying nine eleven truth is going to try to kill him
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:41.800]  and that's like i'm predicting it mark my words
[2:15:41.800 --> 2:15:45.320]  they love to act like profits so we know
[2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:48.120]  that's how i knew they were going to launch nine eleven i saw them introducing
[2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:51.880]  bin laden as the boogeyman he's going to get you he's going to attack you
[2:15:51.880 --> 2:15:54.600]  i knew the feds had cooked the bomb trained the driver in ninety three and
[2:15:54.600 --> 2:15:56.360]  who they'd already attacked the world trade center
[2:15:56.360 --> 2:15:59.640]  i knew they had foreign operatives running the world trade center and a bunch
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:02.520]  of other data i said they're going to attack at the next few months blaming
[2:16:02.520 --> 2:16:06.600]  on bin laden i was right three months before the flu outbreak i got
[2:16:06.600 --> 2:16:10.280]  government documents they were getting ready to stage something on flu told you
[2:16:10.280 --> 2:16:13.880]  it's the same thing here they are planning to attempt to kill obama he's
[2:16:13.880 --> 2:16:16.360]  probably in on it it'll be staged like
[2:16:16.360 --> 2:16:19.880]  ten years ago with the uh...
[2:16:19.880 --> 2:16:24.440]  the uh... situation uh... in taiwan with their president staging a shooting of
[2:16:24.440 --> 2:16:27.800]  himself and it came out it was fake that they did a fake grazing and just had
[2:16:27.800 --> 2:16:31.400]  some blanks go off and a little fake cut he put on himself
[2:16:31.400 --> 2:16:34.760]  so this is done over and over again or they could really kill him
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:38.360]  and that's why i've got webster tarpley on to break this down and give us his
[2:16:38.360 --> 2:16:42.440]  his take on it from his slightly different perspective from my it's not
[2:16:42.440 --> 2:16:45.080]  that we disagree i just want to get his view on it
[2:16:45.080 --> 2:16:50.120]  but uh... key article up on prisonplanet dot com info wars dot com
[2:16:50.120 --> 2:16:53.960]  obama is being blackmailed into attacking iran
[2:16:53.960 --> 2:16:57.560]  neocons hypersacination attempt on president to be blamed on
[2:16:57.560 --> 2:17:00.760]  political extremist and this is why this is important
[2:17:00.760 --> 2:17:06.680]  dovetail with all this they say if you attack iran we're going to support you
[2:17:06.680 --> 2:17:10.040]  sir pale and beckham all said it
[2:17:10.040 --> 2:17:12.920]  if you don't the nine eleven truthers will kill you
[2:17:12.920 --> 2:17:17.160]  so the message is we're going to kill you and blame it on our opposition if
[2:17:17.160 --> 2:17:18.680]  you don't do this now
[2:17:18.680 --> 2:17:21.720]  let's see if webster griffin tarpley agrees with my analysis
[2:17:21.720 --> 2:17:25.080]  i didn't talk to him before he went on air you're gonna find out with me right
[2:17:25.080 --> 2:17:28.680]  now dr tarpley do you agree in what can you add
[2:17:28.680 --> 2:17:32.600]  well i think you've certainly identified a real problem uh... maybe we take a
[2:17:32.600 --> 2:17:35.800]  couple of steps backwards though because i think it's it's not it's a it's a
[2:17:35.800 --> 2:17:37.240]  complex problem
[2:17:37.240 --> 2:17:42.440]  uh... during the election campaign by the idea that obama obama's life was in
[2:17:42.440 --> 2:17:43.400]  danger
[2:17:43.400 --> 2:17:48.360]  was largely a myth spread by his own campaign i think by his own followers
[2:17:48.360 --> 2:17:50.600]  they had a deep emotional need
[2:17:50.600 --> 2:17:55.080]  to believe that obama was in danger because this helped to mask the fact
[2:17:55.080 --> 2:17:58.280]  that he was so obviously a wall street puppet in other words he was a holy
[2:17:58.280 --> 2:18:01.160]  unsubsidiary of wall street but somehow
[2:18:01.160 --> 2:18:05.000]  the emotional need of the obama supporter was to do him as somebody who was a
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:08.520]  an anti-establishment rebel and insurgent and therefore
[2:18:08.520 --> 2:18:12.600]  in grave danger because he was so is this back trying to invoke democrats to
[2:18:12.600 --> 2:18:15.800]  hate nine love and truth i think that that's a different phase now that
[2:18:15.800 --> 2:18:18.840]  that's also looking at what the the um...
[2:18:18.840 --> 2:18:23.000]  the idea that obama needs to be blackmailed in order to attack iran i
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:24.840]  think is also uh...
[2:18:24.840 --> 2:18:29.240]  probably not not the germane uh... obama ran as a warmonger right we have to
[2:18:29.240 --> 2:18:31.160]  remember he ran as the guy
[2:18:31.160 --> 2:18:34.600]  who was going to bomb pakistan unilaterally without
[2:18:34.600 --> 2:18:36.920]  uh... talking to the pakistani government
[2:18:36.920 --> 2:18:40.200]  he was very very adamant about that and he was going to win the war
[2:18:40.200 --> 2:18:43.400]  in afghanistan and we had a statement incident
[2:18:43.400 --> 2:18:45.480]  where obama said i'm going to send uh...
[2:18:45.480 --> 2:18:49.000]  that that's it and i'm going to send uh... predator drones into pakistan to
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:50.840]  get obama where he lives
[2:18:50.840 --> 2:18:54.920]  uh... and hillary clinton said no this is too much mccain said it's too much
[2:18:54.920 --> 2:18:58.440]  and even bush said no it's too much because i talked to my friend
[2:18:58.440 --> 2:19:02.520]  we shot up there was running pakistan at the top only the fake liberal
[2:19:02.520 --> 2:19:06.840]  could get away with expanding more so i know that's that's one phase now
[2:19:06.840 --> 2:19:11.000]  if we look at uh... all obama has had these i think three incidents right we
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:12.520]  have the salahis
[2:19:12.520 --> 2:19:16.440]  on the night of the uh... manmohan singh state dinner back in december
[2:19:16.440 --> 2:19:19.640]  we had another another guy who got in the same night
[2:19:19.640 --> 2:19:22.160]  but they were two incidents counting three people
[2:19:22.160 --> 2:19:25.200]  that night and then apparently a month before that
[2:19:25.200 --> 2:19:29.440]  there was a middle-aged uh... black war veteran in his wife who got into a
[2:19:29.440 --> 2:19:31.760]  breakfast so it's a total of three incidents
[2:19:31.760 --> 2:19:35.200]  five people got in who should not have gotten in obama would have been well
[2:19:35.200 --> 2:19:40.640]  advised to fire the head of the secret service which he didn't do
[2:19:40.640 --> 2:19:43.240]  we're going to skip this break because this is so important i do this
[2:19:43.240 --> 2:19:44.360]  occasionally
[2:19:44.360 --> 2:19:48.040]  well i would compare this right let's let's compare it to some others right
[2:19:48.040 --> 2:19:52.200]  because i i i would argue is that obama's treatment has been relatively mild
[2:19:52.200 --> 2:19:53.880]  so far
[2:19:53.880 --> 2:19:56.240]  ronald reagan what did he have
[2:19:56.240 --> 2:19:58.560]  he had inkly shooting at him
[2:19:58.560 --> 2:20:00.640]  i think that's that's a pretty clear one
[2:20:00.640 --> 2:20:04.640]  uh... jerald ford had at least that two people right he had let that squeaky
[2:20:04.640 --> 2:20:07.680]  promise there are jane more shooting at him
[2:20:07.680 --> 2:20:09.800]  uh... in the case of clinton
[2:20:09.800 --> 2:20:13.360]  uh... it's often forgotten in nineteen ninety three ninety four there were
[2:20:13.360 --> 2:20:16.680]  lots of really rough things done to clinton uh...
[2:20:16.680 --> 2:20:20.520]  is uh... helicopter crashed killing three or four
[2:20:20.520 --> 2:20:22.440]  marines who were flying that
[2:20:22.440 --> 2:20:24.600]  marine one there was a guy in the
[2:20:24.600 --> 2:20:26.800]  uh... dc city council here
[2:20:26.800 --> 2:20:30.680]  who was a political friend of uh... of clinton's by the name of wilson
[2:20:30.680 --> 2:20:32.200]  who was found hanged
[2:20:32.200 --> 2:20:34.360]  in his uh... in his apartment
[2:20:34.360 --> 2:20:38.040]  uh... and then you've got uh... vince fostered i thought i would be a bit
[2:20:38.040 --> 2:20:38.880]  faster
[2:20:38.880 --> 2:20:40.600]  as the intelligence community
[2:20:40.600 --> 2:20:44.080]  murdering a person in clinton's immediate out to rye in order to
[2:20:44.080 --> 2:20:45.120]  intimidate him
[2:20:45.120 --> 2:20:48.040]  other people thought it as as clinton doing this i don't think how that makes
[2:20:48.040 --> 2:20:49.000]  any sense
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  what makes sense to me is that the intelligence community
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:55.720]  uh... doing that right up up here in uh... in fort marcy above above the
[2:20:55.720 --> 2:20:56.840]  atomic
[2:20:56.840 --> 2:20:59.060]  you also had in clinton's uh...
[2:20:59.060 --> 2:21:01.840]  a little bit later in the clinton president you had this case were a
[2:21:01.840 --> 2:21:04.560]  light plane actually crashed into the uh...
[2:21:04.560 --> 2:21:07.840]  into the side of the white house not so far from clinton's office right that
[2:21:07.840 --> 2:21:09.600]  was a few years on
[2:21:09.600 --> 2:21:14.000]  in the case of bush we have to remember nine eleven itself
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:15.880]  that was full of threats
[2:21:15.880 --> 2:21:19.040]  to bush and i've written about this at great length but they were reports
[2:21:19.040 --> 2:21:20.160]  coming to bush
[2:21:20.160 --> 2:21:22.960]  that there was an attack going on on his ranch
[2:21:22.960 --> 2:21:26.080]  that uh... there were other planes were going to come crash into a report he
[2:21:26.080 --> 2:21:29.960]  ran away scared so clearly he's such a delusional puppet you're saying from your
[2:21:29.960 --> 2:21:31.080]  research
[2:21:31.080 --> 2:21:33.960]  he was only let on it let in on it later
[2:21:33.960 --> 2:21:38.560]  sure he's you know he's a very low-level participant in this and indeed
[2:21:38.560 --> 2:21:42.120]  that the centerpiece of nine eleven is angel is next i have a whole chapter
[2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:44.800]  about angel is next in my book on nine eleven
[2:21:44.800 --> 2:21:48.640]  which is a direct threat to bush if you don't do what we want
[2:21:48.640 --> 2:21:52.080]  which is to declare the war of civilizations against iraq and
[2:21:52.080 --> 2:21:56.400]  and and get going and start saying ben laden and al-qaeda and terrorism
[2:21:56.400 --> 2:21:57.400]  and all this
[2:21:57.400 --> 2:22:00.240]  then uh... then something that is going to happen to you
[2:22:00.240 --> 2:22:01.400]  um...
[2:22:01.400 --> 2:22:05.520]  so you can see that compared to other presidents this has not been
[2:22:05.520 --> 2:22:10.280]  very rough right obama has now got these these incidents three incidents five
[2:22:10.280 --> 2:22:11.160]  people
[2:22:11.160 --> 2:22:14.640]  he's also got uh... a significant number of death threats
[2:22:14.640 --> 2:22:18.000]  but he's also in that couple of people have already been sentenced to jail for
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:18.960]  threatening
[2:22:18.960 --> 2:22:22.720]  uh... obama but i think on the whole this is not the roughest treatment that
[2:22:22.720 --> 2:22:23.680]  we've seen
[2:22:23.680 --> 2:22:24.880]  in recent years
[2:22:24.880 --> 2:22:30.080]  uh... although it and unmistakably is a reminder to obama
[2:22:30.080 --> 2:22:33.760]  that he is a puppet and he better remember that he's a puppet
[2:22:33.760 --> 2:22:37.760]  i think what we saw in the in the case of the christmas patty
[2:22:37.760 --> 2:22:40.280]  uh... with the the state department now
[2:22:40.280 --> 2:22:42.280]  revealing through the sky
[2:22:42.280 --> 2:22:45.720]  undersecretary of state for management patrick kennedy
[2:22:45.720 --> 2:22:47.000]  they've revealed
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:51.120]  that there was uh... uh... desire in the state department and intention in the
[2:22:51.120 --> 2:22:53.000]  state department to revoke
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:54.040]  the visa
[2:22:54.040 --> 2:22:56.760]  of the detroit christmas patty mutalib
[2:22:56.760 --> 2:23:00.160]  but that this revoking of the visa was blocked
[2:23:00.160 --> 2:23:04.120]  by a u s agency which he refused to name in public he wouldn't tell you what
[2:23:04.120 --> 2:23:04.920]  was
[2:23:04.920 --> 2:23:07.120]  but somebody came forward and said no
[2:23:07.120 --> 2:23:10.400]  we're putting a national security override on this we're flagging this
[2:23:10.400 --> 2:23:11.440]  guy's name
[2:23:11.440 --> 2:23:14.640]  because we're telling him we're watching him we've got eyes on him
[2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:17.040]  he's going to lead us to some really big fish
[2:23:17.040 --> 2:23:19.440]  so therefore you can't touch him he's immune
[2:23:19.440 --> 2:23:22.880]  and of course that's the classic method that a mole uses
[2:23:22.880 --> 2:23:26.160]  to protect the patty the most responsibility is to make sure that
[2:23:26.160 --> 2:23:29.760]  the patty got through and we see that with oklahoma city we see it with nine
[2:23:29.760 --> 2:23:32.640]  eleven nine every case the shoe bomber
[2:23:32.640 --> 2:23:34.960]  the government gets them on the plane
[2:23:34.960 --> 2:23:38.320]  the government causes a stand-down well they're always being trained at that
[2:23:38.320 --> 2:23:42.560]  but but what we have to say alex rather than say government in this case you see
[2:23:42.560 --> 2:23:45.920]  it's private global corporate intelligence
[2:23:45.920 --> 2:23:50.920]  nexus networks with key rogue groups interfacing at an international level
[2:23:50.920 --> 2:23:54.920]  but you also have the state department would like to lift the visa at least
[2:23:54.920 --> 2:23:55.920]  they claim
[2:23:55.920 --> 2:23:59.160]  but then another agency says no we're overriding that
[2:23:59.160 --> 2:24:03.600]  and the the general idea in the obama white house as we saw on january fourth
[2:24:03.600 --> 2:24:06.700]  right with this very interesting broadcast by richard wolf
[2:24:06.700 --> 2:24:10.480]  on msnbc he came on over a minute came on rachel maddoin said
[2:24:10.480 --> 2:24:14.640]  the obama white house thinks that the christmas day incident was intentional
[2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:17.040]  by a network with an alternative agenda
[2:24:17.040 --> 2:24:20.720]  and then it's designed to make obama look bad now the obama look bad part is
[2:24:20.720 --> 2:24:24.980]  very superficial and trivial compared to the big geopolitical
[2:24:24.980 --> 2:24:28.280]  goals that are always involved that we had several weeks if it was the new
[2:24:28.280 --> 2:24:32.080]  yemen war get the naked body scanners and look i want to go over all this with
[2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:32.720]  you
[2:24:32.720 --> 2:24:33.880]  but first
[2:24:33.880 --> 2:24:35.920]  specifically
[2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:37.640]  no clearly
[2:24:37.640 --> 2:24:40.240]  they are putting out the talking point
[2:24:40.240 --> 2:24:42.160]  through neocon channels
[2:24:42.160 --> 2:24:45.440]  that nine eleven truth we know is the white house
[2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:49.120]  and the road networks number one enemy we have cast sunsteen admitting it we
[2:24:49.120 --> 2:24:50.480]  have bushes
[2:24:50.480 --> 2:24:55.120]  congressional hearings saying at webster they're clearly putting out the trial
[2:24:55.120 --> 2:24:56.140]  balloon
[2:24:56.140 --> 2:24:58.880]  the psychological back story
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:04.000]  uh... the history that nine eleven truth is going to kill
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:07.800]  uh... the president now my question to you is
[2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:11.880]  i mean i believe and i've gotten to uh... it pretty darn good track record of
[2:25:11.880 --> 2:25:14.320]  being able to gauge what they're up to and doing
[2:25:14.320 --> 2:25:17.800]  that it bear minimum they're putting the card in their hand they're taking out
[2:25:17.800 --> 2:25:18.800]  of their sleeve
[2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:19.920]  and putting the
[2:25:19.920 --> 2:25:21.200]  false flag
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:24.400]  fake assassination attempt
[2:25:24.400 --> 2:25:27.080]  getting ready to play it considering
[2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:29.280]  that they may go ahead and try it
[2:25:29.280 --> 2:25:31.320]  so they're gauging right now
[2:25:31.320 --> 2:25:36.160]  uh... to stage an assassination on obama to get his approval ratings up
[2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:38.480]  and i'd believe he's probably involved in it
[2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:41.480]  and then it could have the added intimidation threat on top of it i mean
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:42.320]  why
[2:25:42.320 --> 2:25:44.360]  are the neocons and others
[2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:47.840]  right now saying nine eleven truth is going to try to kill him
[2:25:47.840 --> 2:25:51.080]  well i think you have to take that very seriously and i the reason i think
[2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:53.680]  you should take it seriously is also because
[2:25:53.680 --> 2:25:56.760]  what's going on in the background i think it's a very important strategic
[2:25:56.760 --> 2:25:59.080]  shift and again you have to take a step back
[2:25:59.080 --> 2:26:02.560]  last week we had February eleventh
[2:26:02.560 --> 2:26:05.240]  iran right the anniversary of the revolution
[2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:08.280]  and the green movement the cia backed
[2:26:08.280 --> 2:26:11.120]  color revolution people power coup forces
[2:26:11.120 --> 2:26:13.080]  associated with mousavi
[2:26:13.080 --> 2:26:16.240]  rapsadjani and the mullahs as we now find out
[2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:20.120]  uh... we're attempting to make this a a test of strength that they would bring
[2:26:20.120 --> 2:26:21.920]  out their green base
[2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:26.040]  and overwhelm the akhmadini job supporters overwhelm the existing
[2:26:26.040 --> 2:26:29.360]  uh... government and maybe use maybe start a people power coup
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:33.360]  on february eleventh uh... this has been going on of course in last summer
[2:26:33.360 --> 2:26:37.360]  but this is a complete failure it would get fiddled completely they did not have
[2:26:37.360 --> 2:26:41.520]  the people they were not coordinated the forces of demoralized
[2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:43.880]  and so forth so it means that for the moment
[2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:47.600]  the idea of overthrowing the iranian government from within
[2:26:47.600 --> 2:26:51.520]  and getting a regime change uh... is out the window so
[2:26:51.520 --> 2:26:55.600]  now what you see from hillary clinton and others is
[2:26:55.600 --> 2:27:00.720]  beating the drum for crippling economic sanctions against iran but then
[2:27:00.720 --> 2:27:03.920]  behind that looms what i think it is an important shift
[2:27:03.920 --> 2:27:06.240]  for the first time in two years now
[2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:10.280]  i think the attack on iran is on the front burner it was way on the back
[2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:11.080]  burner
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:12.800]  it was several rows back
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:16.080]  on the stove that they have but now it's on the it's on the absolute front
[2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:19.960]  burner i agree with you they're moving in troops moving in ships moving in
[2:27:19.960 --> 2:27:21.160]  missile systems
[2:27:21.160 --> 2:27:24.560]  defensive and offensive and i want to walk through this with you after
[2:27:24.560 --> 2:27:26.400]  but specifically
[2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:29.760]  when my little alarm bells start going off you know it's it's almost more than
[2:27:29.760 --> 2:27:30.800]  just the data
[2:27:30.800 --> 2:27:34.720]  you know you a it's like a hunch but i have pretty much always been right
[2:27:34.720 --> 2:27:38.920]  why are they saying nine eleven truth is going to kill obama what's the point of
[2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:39.600]  that
[2:27:39.600 --> 2:27:43.200]  well they want the option uh... again the uh... you know we have to be aware
[2:27:43.200 --> 2:27:45.680]  that there would probably be other options right you've mentioned some of
[2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:47.920]  them right but some of them would be disgruntled
[2:27:47.920 --> 2:27:50.320]  right wing war veterans but then again
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:53.880]  the other possibility is somebody with a link to iran would also be very
[2:27:53.880 --> 2:27:57.720]  convenient so that's what back saying he says nine eleven truth works with
[2:27:57.720 --> 2:27:58.520]  iran
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:00.440]  so they're going to double goody
[2:28:00.440 --> 2:28:03.040]  well that's that makes it even more plausible than so
[2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:06.480]  i i think everybody should take that stuff very very very seriously so you
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:10.320]  think you know you think my concerns are valid absolutely valid sure
[2:28:10.320 --> 2:28:13.680]  uh... the only thing is that we've got to keep keep in mind that there's an
[2:28:13.680 --> 2:28:16.240]  array of of possibilities
[2:28:16.240 --> 2:28:19.120]  and every one of them give them certain certain possible
[2:28:19.120 --> 2:28:20.880]  uh... advantages
[2:28:20.880 --> 2:28:21.920]  here's the thing though
[2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:27.160]  the attack on iran now he's not the same as the attack on iran
[2:28:27.160 --> 2:28:30.600]  in two thousand six two thousand and seven when cheney
[2:28:30.600 --> 2:28:34.440]  the cheney group that the the rogue network invisible government with cheney
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:36.480]  is the busy of the visible
[2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:38.360]  part of that above the waterline
[2:28:38.360 --> 2:28:42.480]  they really wanted to attack iran for the purpose of destroying iran and the
[2:28:42.480 --> 2:28:46.880]  other stuff would have been secondary right now the attack on iran is
[2:28:46.880 --> 2:28:49.480]  primarily directed against china
[2:28:49.480 --> 2:28:54.520]  because the big thing in washington right now is the absolute hysteria of the
[2:28:54.520 --> 2:28:58.520]  ruling class right the elite the wall street group in their political
[2:28:58.520 --> 2:29:00.440]  commissars here in washington
[2:29:00.440 --> 2:29:04.480]  is the idea that china is catching up and passing the united states right it's
[2:29:04.480 --> 2:29:06.800]  already the world's biggest exporter
[2:29:06.800 --> 2:29:09.960]  there's some question about whether it's past japan to become the world's
[2:29:09.960 --> 2:29:11.400]  biggest economy
[2:29:11.400 --> 2:29:15.520]  they're building as obama said today china is building twenty one
[2:29:15.520 --> 2:29:19.920]  nuclear reactors of the most modern type and obama came forward and said we're
[2:29:19.920 --> 2:29:21.720]  going to counter that with two
[2:29:21.720 --> 2:29:24.760]  so it's pathetic uh... the chinese have got
[2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:28.760]  they're building eighteen thousand miles of fast rail the u.s. has you know two
[2:29:28.760 --> 2:29:30.360]  hundred three hundred miles
[2:29:30.360 --> 2:29:34.720]  they're they're uh... they're going into space right over there stay there
[2:29:34.720 --> 2:29:36.800]  we've got a break we're gonna come back and
[2:29:36.800 --> 2:29:41.400]  go over this we have hillary saying we'll put sanctions on china if you don't
[2:29:41.400 --> 2:29:47.400]  uh... let us attack iran i mean it's insane
[2:29:47.400 --> 2:29:48.880]  we're on the march

[2:33:16.520 --> 2:33:20.120]  agree with you if you remember one of the few predictions where you were wrong
[2:33:20.120 --> 2:33:23.800]  and nobody's perfect which you were sure they were gonna attack Iran was it four
[2:33:23.800 --> 2:33:28.800]  years ago and I didn't believe they were from all my sources but you've been
[2:33:28.800 --> 2:33:33.360]  right more times than I have been and I agree with you this time and that's why
[2:33:33.360 --> 2:33:38.240]  I'm worried they clearly are saying they want to go into Iran Israel saying it
[2:33:38.240 --> 2:33:42.040]  they're pre positioning what will the attack look like it's now on the front
[2:33:42.040 --> 2:33:50.000]  burner how do we stop it from happening and on the larger scene how will they
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:54.760]  precipitate it will it be a false flag what type of false flag are you looking
[2:33:54.760 --> 2:33:59.360]  for let me just this backtrack now the the last time we had this active danger
[2:33:59.360 --> 2:34:06.280]  was 2006 2007 which was the twilight of the of the neocon cheney invisible
[2:34:06.280 --> 2:34:11.240]  government regime under the second bush administration and that was of course the
[2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:17.960]  road B-52 of August to September 2007 was the high point of that after which the
[2:34:17.960 --> 2:34:21.040]  the danger right because it had been blocked right the missing cruise
[2:34:21.040 --> 2:34:24.680]  missiles that was blocked by forces inside the u.s. military in the
[2:34:24.680 --> 2:34:29.360]  intelligence community and it may have fallen said no that was the real end of
[2:34:29.360 --> 2:34:33.560]  it went up it went up the the ladder and then the answer came back no and they
[2:34:33.560 --> 2:34:36.880]  have been the know probably came from Robert Gates and the Pentagon by then
[2:34:36.880 --> 2:34:40.360]  the burjinski guy put in with the idea that they were going to change the
[2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:44.680]  policy and get rid of the neocon approach to these things when you had the
[2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:49.640]  national intelligence estimate of December 2007 saying and it's worth
[2:34:49.640 --> 2:34:55.760]  stressing again today there is no Iranian nuclear weapons program as of
[2:34:55.760 --> 2:35:00.680]  December 2007 that was a sign that inside the bureaucracy the people who
[2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:06.040]  wanted the attack on Iran had had lost out and that the burjinski group coming
[2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:10.240]  in saying we have better things in store for Iran what they had in store of
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:14.320]  course was the color revolution that now seems to have fizzled with the idea
[2:35:14.320 --> 2:35:19.840]  being if you could put in a u.s. puppet regime in Iran it's possible that you
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:24.200]  could then use Iran against China by cutting off oil and against Russia by
[2:35:24.200 --> 2:35:29.800]  making trouble in the Caspian Sea and and in Central Asia in general so as soon
[2:35:29.800 --> 2:35:35.680]  as I think by by January 2008 I put out now that the attack on Iran was getting
[2:35:35.680 --> 2:35:41.480]  to be less and less likely so that and I think that has held true during 2008
[2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:47.440]  2009 and now currently Iran is not making anything near fizzle material they
[2:35:47.440 --> 2:35:51.640]  asked France to enrich it for him so everybody would know it couldn't be
[2:35:51.640 --> 2:35:55.520]  used in a weapons system they want to supply nuclear energy to the Middle East
[2:35:55.520 --> 2:36:01.400]  they know that they can't count on oil and they're told no no no right which is
[2:36:01.400 --> 2:36:05.400]  it was illegal it's outrageous it's a double standard right Pakistan has
[2:36:05.400 --> 2:36:09.600]  nuclear weapons Israel has nuclear weapons what is the signaling out of
[2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:13.800]  Iran it's contrary to international law couldn't come in international law
[2:36:13.800 --> 2:36:18.160]  everybody has to be equal formally equal that to be complete reciprocity no
[2:36:18.160 --> 2:36:23.040]  hypocrisy no double standard we go back to 53 it's been a Anglo-American British
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:27.360]  possession they've always wanted back right now just in terms of the war
[2:36:27.360 --> 2:36:33.280]  danger a couple of couple of things to say I couldn't in a job in his speech I
[2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:39.240]  guess yesterday or this this morning even says Israel wants war by spring
[2:36:39.240 --> 2:36:45.120]  summer of this year so that's Ahmadinejad and a general Eva Schaaf right
[2:36:45.120 --> 2:36:49.000]  the former head of the Russian military high official of the Russian Defense
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:54.840]  Ministry I had I met him at the Kerry Mason's access for peace back in 2005
[2:36:54.840 --> 2:37:00.920]  he says that the danger of an Israeli attack on Iran right now is greater than
[2:37:00.920 --> 2:37:08.280]  it ever was and you've got Netanyahu in Moscow for two days trying to convince
[2:37:08.280 --> 2:37:13.800]  Russia among other things not to deliver this a 300 surface-to-air missile
[2:37:13.800 --> 2:37:19.040]  capability which would make it not impossible but much more difficult and
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:24.080]  much more expensive in terms of planes and pilots lost for anybody to attack
[2:37:24.080 --> 2:37:29.480]  certain key targets inside Iran so all of this is coming together in the middle
[2:37:29.480 --> 2:37:33.480]  of this Hillary Clinton has made a speech which I think is really a
[2:37:33.480 --> 2:37:38.840]  teachable moment she says and this is she repeated this three times yesterday
[2:37:38.840 --> 2:37:43.040]  she's she's in the Gulf right she was in Qatar I guess and then she went on to
[2:37:43.040 --> 2:37:47.360]  Saudi Arabia she's trying to organize the Saudis and their friends in the Gulf
[2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:51.960]  cooperation council to be part of what looks like we now have a Saudi minister
[2:37:51.960 --> 2:37:56.680]  agreeing that sanctions aren't enough so Saudi Arabia where the 15 hijackers came
[2:37:56.680 --> 2:38:02.720]  from always wanting to attack other countries well I think they fear Iran
[2:38:02.720 --> 2:38:06.400]  and I think they've been they've been cajoled and threatened maybe to go along
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:10.120]  with this but here's what what Hillary Clinton says is really bizarre she says
[2:38:10.120 --> 2:38:15.760]  the big danger now is that Iran is getting to be a military dictatorship I
[2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:19.720]  think that is correct and with that's been visible for the past three four or
[2:38:19.720 --> 2:38:24.560]  five months that it's no longer the Mullahs it's no longer the Milwaukee it's
[2:38:24.560 --> 2:38:29.320]  no longer the theocratic Islamic Republic but you look at Ahmadinejad
[2:38:29.320 --> 2:38:34.440]  he's a general he's a general with you know so it's a more scientific
[2:38:34.440 --> 2:38:38.840]  disciplined hardcore group yeah it's the kind of thing that that the u.s. hates
[2:38:38.840 --> 2:38:43.880]  the most if they if the funny thing about the u.s. policy is in public they
[2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:47.840]  say that they're against Islamic fundamentalism but in in practice they
[2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:51.680]  supported yeah they love a bunch of people running around mutilating their
[2:38:51.680 --> 2:38:55.640]  women acting like fools that's why they fund these brigades but they're scared
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:39:00.760]  of what they are a scientific military dictatorship with high-tech propaganda
[2:39:00.760 --> 2:39:06.080]  they fear themselves in the mirror that they see an iran yeah you can you know
[2:39:06.080 --> 2:39:10.700]  you look at nasser in Egypt they didn't like that you look at that the
[2:39:10.700 --> 2:39:14.920]  military government that preceded Saddam Hussein the u.s. didn't like that but
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:20.240]  now she comes out and says it she says we want sanctions against Iran to
[2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:25.880]  protect the Islamic Republic and the rule of the mullahs against the threat of
[2:39:25.880 --> 2:39:30.440]  the Revolutionary Guard the pastor on the military and that's clearly last
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:36.200]  summer's coup was really a bunch of the original revolutionaries the CIA
[2:39:36.200 --> 2:39:39.960]  clearly funded let's go back then Webster let's go back in a snapshot
[2:39:39.960 --> 2:39:43.480]  this is historical fact that people a lot of them don't know this explain to
[2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:48.360]  people what happened what really happened in 79 and flying you know the
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:53.640]  king pin in from Paris explain what that strategic brzezinski model was really
[2:39:53.640 --> 2:39:57.880]  about what exactly that that's what it really couldn't have shown that the u.s.
[2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:02.280]  policy is to support an Islamic fundamentalist the autopliocracy in
[2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:06.600]  Iran the u.s. has always been the main backer look at who they put in Iraq the
[2:40:06.600 --> 2:40:10.920]  women are now wearing the turbines it's now an Islamic Republic but then and in
[2:40:10.920 --> 2:40:16.560]  other words enforced backwardness and enforced self-isolation 1979 is simply
[2:40:16.560 --> 2:40:22.760]  this the Shah has two sides the Shah is politically a monster of course because
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:27.920]  he's got the fabric he's got this awful gestapo that goes around repressing
[2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:32.240]  people and so forth it horrendous human rights situation but on the other hand
[2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:38.320]  he's building about 75 billion to a hundred billion of dollars of those days
[2:40:38.320 --> 2:40:43.200]  in development projects he's building steel mills urban mass transit he's
[2:40:43.200 --> 2:40:47.680]  building a whole nuclear industry if the Shah's plans had been allowed to go
[2:40:47.680 --> 2:40:52.760]  through Iran would have been a nuclear power in terms of at nuclear energy and
[2:40:52.760 --> 2:40:56.440]  and probably more you know decades ago wouldn't would never have been an issue
[2:40:56.440 --> 2:41:01.920]  and as soon as Khomeini came in he immediately shut down 75 to 80 billion
[2:41:01.920 --> 2:41:05.640]  dollars of these development projects among other things they took the the
[2:41:05.640 --> 2:41:10.560]  cooling towers of nuclear reactors and tried to use them as as silos to store
[2:41:10.560 --> 2:41:15.240]  grain in so this was a tremendous step backward the other thing about the
[2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:19.880]  Shah that the US objected to a great deal was that he was making deals not
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:25.440]  with London and and Washington New York but he was dealing with the Italians he
[2:41:25.440 --> 2:41:29.400]  was the Italian civil engineering companies were building the city of
[2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:33.720]  well today it's called Bondar Khomeini but it was Bondar Abbas in those days and
[2:41:33.720 --> 2:41:38.960]  the Soviets and and the Japanese and everybody else was was a welcome
[2:41:38.960 --> 2:41:43.200]  partner in Iran so the US said no we will not allow these other countries to
[2:41:43.200 --> 2:41:47.280]  come in and develop Iran we're going to enforce backwardness on Iran so here
[2:41:47.280 --> 2:41:51.800]  comes the Muslim here comes the Muslim brigade they use against the US they use
[2:41:51.800 --> 2:41:56.240]  against every other country they use against the Serbs they use them against
[2:41:56.240 --> 2:42:00.480]  the Russians it's admittedly their creation and Glenn Beck saying we better
[2:42:00.480 --> 2:42:04.480]  give all our rights up or the radical Muslims are get us and then meanwhile
[2:42:04.480 --> 2:42:08.000]  Bush three years ago puts out a press release at White House dot gov admitting
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:13.320]  that they're using Wahhabist al-Qaeda groups to attack the Iranians meanwhile
[2:42:13.320 --> 2:42:18.720]  the news says Iran is al-Qaeda when it's Shiite the opposite group yeah it's
[2:42:18.720 --> 2:42:23.960]  incredible mishmash but the one constant that goes through it is big new
[2:42:23.960 --> 2:42:29.840]  burshinsky said in 78 79 islamic fundamentalism is our great bulwark
[2:42:29.840 --> 2:42:35.320]  against soviet communism meaning against Russia today Hillary Clinton says the
[2:42:35.320 --> 2:42:39.560]  role of the United States is to interfere in the internal affairs of Iran with
[2:42:39.560 --> 2:42:44.080]  these sanctions because we want to protect the mullah regime we want to
[2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:48.440]  protect the uh... the the this domination of theocracy and if what an
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:51.320]  incredible statement she's saying
[2:42:51.320 --> 2:42:57.120]  I mean it's letting the cat out of the bag in a very very gross way I mean
[2:42:57.120 --> 2:43:01.040]  everybody in the world is noticing how bizarre is this now she may be saying
[2:43:01.040 --> 2:43:06.000]  that to try to make it easier for the Saudis to get into a war with Iran
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:10.560]  because she can say your Saudis don't worry these are not fellow Muslims even
[2:43:10.560 --> 2:43:15.320]  even on paper these are really military dictators these are really communists or
[2:43:15.320 --> 2:43:20.360]  socialists or something like this right like uh... Saddam Hussein or Nasser or
[2:43:20.360 --> 2:43:22.320]  something like this
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:27.600]  so that the other situation so I would once again say the big shift is now
[2:43:27.600 --> 2:43:32.720]  we're back to the attack on Iran as a definite possibility in this in the
[2:43:32.720 --> 2:43:36.840]  short run but now this is mainly against
[2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:40.240]  china because if you're you're attacking iran today
[2:43:40.240 --> 2:43:43.320]  uh... this is to cut off oil to china iran
[2:43:43.320 --> 2:43:47.520]  i think that's china about eleven or twelve percent of the oil that china
[2:43:47.520 --> 2:43:48.720]  imports
[2:43:48.720 --> 2:43:52.840]  they're up uh... it's about seventy five eighty billion dollars of of
[2:43:52.840 --> 2:43:54.200]  development deals
[2:43:54.200 --> 2:43:58.280]  but explain to me in globalization why they didn't give tax incentives to move
[2:43:58.280 --> 2:43:59.920]  all our businesses there
[2:43:59.920 --> 2:44:02.240]  which select global corporations get
[2:44:02.240 --> 2:44:06.520]  uh... basically oligopolies or cartels out of
[2:44:06.520 --> 2:44:10.160]  i mean what's the method of that madness they give china all this power but
[2:44:10.160 --> 2:44:12.760]  then on record are in circling them
[2:44:12.760 --> 2:44:16.000]  that it's uh... you're the only way to approach it is that it's
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  hopelessly contradictory because it's hopelessly
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:22.600]  irrational and other so the bankers are greedy and want to go
[2:44:22.600 --> 2:44:25.960]  uh... set everything up in china but the same time i want to cut the royal
[2:44:25.960 --> 2:44:29.000]  they want to have their cake and eat it too and they they want to make money
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:30.400]  individually
[2:44:30.400 --> 2:44:31.520]  off
[2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:34.440]  chinese labor and chinese economic development
[2:44:34.440 --> 2:44:37.760]  but then at the same time we we have this this mode that is kicked in now
[2:44:37.760 --> 2:44:41.440]  just a little on plus that phase is over china's done its job it's the
[2:44:41.440 --> 2:44:44.000]  industrialized the u.s
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:48.200]  uh... yeah well that's again nobody could be industrialized the u.s. except the
[2:44:48.200 --> 2:44:52.440]  u.s. i i i'm putting that on on the u.s. ruling class directly no i know i'm
[2:44:52.440 --> 2:44:54.680]  good but that's what i'm saying they partnered
[2:44:54.680 --> 2:44:57.800]  and set that up just like they're plunging the euro today
[2:44:57.800 --> 2:45:00.440]  and goldman sacks is in there sucking spain
[2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:01.520]  and greece
[2:45:01.520 --> 2:45:06.320]  and and next iran dry and they just move on is carrying birds
[2:45:06.320 --> 2:45:08.320]  from from point to point
[2:45:08.320 --> 2:45:09.220]  yeah i look at
[2:45:09.220 --> 2:45:12.200]  deep the mood in washington i would compare it to
[2:45:12.200 --> 2:45:15.720]  great britain looking at germany before nineteen fourteen
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:19.160]  uh... at that time you know britain was it was the dominant their financial
[2:45:19.160 --> 2:45:21.640]  center certainly would bring significant industry
[2:45:21.640 --> 2:45:25.760]  but germany was coming up really fast and after the boa war in the ten or
[2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:27.440]  fifteen years before
[2:45:27.440 --> 2:45:28.800]  world war one
[2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:30.380]  the british added choice
[2:45:30.380 --> 2:45:31.280]  if they looked at
[2:45:31.280 --> 2:45:33.000]  uh... germany and they said well
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:35.520]  this is very rapid economic development
[2:45:35.520 --> 2:45:39.480]  do we want to match that right china's getting eight nine percent ten percent
[2:45:39.480 --> 2:45:41.640]  economic uh... growth per year
[2:45:41.640 --> 2:45:45.960]  the u.s. has ten percent unemployment officially really twenty percent
[2:45:45.960 --> 2:45:47.840]  and the chinese have ten percent
[2:45:47.840 --> 2:45:50.400]  economic growth and there's a poll today that
[2:45:50.400 --> 2:45:53.840]  that uh... you know part of seven chinese think they're going to have
[2:45:53.840 --> 2:45:54.960]  more money
[2:45:54.960 --> 2:45:58.880]  in the in the coming year and america's in decline and we have the pl a
[2:45:58.880 --> 2:45:59.880]  commanders
[2:45:59.880 --> 2:46:02.660]  saying the u.s. is getting ready for war with them
[2:46:02.660 --> 2:46:03.960]  dump our bonds
[2:46:03.960 --> 2:46:06.820]  china doesn't usually just right uh... rattlesabers this is
[2:46:06.820 --> 2:46:11.360]  incredible escalation it is it's a bit that that deterioration that
[2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:15.000]  that i think is is why this attack on iran is in many ways even more dangerous
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:15.760]  because
[2:46:15.760 --> 2:46:20.480]  it is it right right now it's a it's a oblique attack a proxy attack
[2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:21.560]  on china
[2:46:21.560 --> 2:46:23.240]  but the thing with china is
[2:46:23.240 --> 2:46:25.160]  the u.s. could say all right
[2:46:25.160 --> 2:46:30.080]  let's have a piece race and if china is building twenty one nuclear reactors
[2:46:30.080 --> 2:46:31.320]  will build a hundred
[2:46:31.320 --> 2:46:32.480]  if they're building
[2:46:32.480 --> 2:46:36.200]  eighteen thousand miles of fast rail will build a hundred thousand but the
[2:46:36.200 --> 2:46:40.200]  parasite offshore bankers want all the money for themselves
[2:46:40.200 --> 2:46:43.720]  to go buy up third world countries they don't want us getting jack squad of our
[2:46:43.720 --> 2:46:46.220]  tax money exactly and then that would that would be a
[2:46:46.220 --> 2:46:49.800]  good a lot of people in goldman tax would say that that's a lot of money
[2:46:49.800 --> 2:46:52.760]  so the bankers are worse than the commies
[2:46:52.760 --> 2:46:53.660]  that yet
[2:46:53.660 --> 2:46:55.280]  again comies uh...
[2:46:55.280 --> 2:46:56.160]  i don't know what
[2:46:56.160 --> 2:46:57.320]  you know how we can
[2:46:57.320 --> 2:46:59.840]  uh... applied to china today
[2:46:59.840 --> 2:47:04.560]  is is uh... there are some of course but at that the economic process in general
[2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:08.880]  is not really communism at all it's it's rather more like a dirige is a more
[2:47:08.880 --> 2:47:11.760]  mercantilism of a of a rather traditional
[2:47:11.760 --> 2:47:13.200]  type
[2:47:13.200 --> 2:47:15.160]  but that the big problem is
[2:47:15.160 --> 2:47:17.000]  the u.s. ruling class
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:18.560]  they have a choice
[2:47:18.560 --> 2:47:22.080]  you could have a piece race and you could engage with china again if you if
[2:47:22.080 --> 2:47:24.760]  you're concerned because you're falling behind
[2:47:24.760 --> 2:47:27.280]  then match the chinese here an example
[2:47:27.280 --> 2:47:29.200]  before nineteen fourteen
[2:47:29.200 --> 2:47:33.360]  the british felt threatened by the child of the growth of the german fleet
[2:47:33.360 --> 2:47:36.880]  so every time the germans would lay down the keel of a battleship
[2:47:36.880 --> 2:47:38.280]  and start building it
[2:47:38.280 --> 2:47:42.080]  the british would lay down too they call this two keels to one
[2:47:42.080 --> 2:47:44.520]  so far if you're worried about china
[2:47:44.520 --> 2:47:47.040]  have two nuclear reactors to one
[2:47:47.040 --> 2:47:50.120]  two miles of fast rail for every one they build
[2:47:50.120 --> 2:47:53.560]  and put twice as much money into your space program i'd say we're going to
[2:47:53.560 --> 2:47:58.360]  have the chinese will be on the moon and will be sitting here in poverty with
[2:47:58.360 --> 2:48:02.520]  credit default swaps collateralized debt obligations and goldman fax
[2:48:02.520 --> 2:48:03.760]  running the show
[2:48:03.760 --> 2:48:06.480]  but the big problem for the u.s. ruling class is
[2:48:06.480 --> 2:48:08.880]  you've got to choose a piece race
[2:48:08.880 --> 2:48:12.040]  and and come away from the stupid policies because what they're doing now is
[2:48:12.040 --> 2:48:12.760]  saying
[2:48:12.760 --> 2:48:14.280]  we'll format
[2:48:14.280 --> 2:48:17.160]  war will format rebellion in to bet
[2:48:17.160 --> 2:48:19.760]  we're going to cause trouble with with taiwan
[2:48:19.760 --> 2:48:23.760]  we're going to cause trouble in sinchang with this world week or
[2:48:23.760 --> 2:48:25.320]  conference conference
[2:48:25.320 --> 2:48:28.960]  we're going to have affront to china right we're having the dalai lama here
[2:48:28.960 --> 2:48:30.520]  in washington this week
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:31.480]  and then
[2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:33.440]  we'll use iran
[2:48:33.440 --> 2:48:37.640]  as you can call it the iran monkey trap because they think they've got china
[2:48:37.640 --> 2:48:40.040]  in a bind right china needs
[2:48:40.040 --> 2:48:42.800]  iran because they need that pipeline
[2:48:42.800 --> 2:48:47.760]  from iran across pakistan and into china right that's the long-term solution
[2:48:47.760 --> 2:48:51.080]  to china's energy problems or at least a very large part of it
[2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:55.880]  is to build those pipeline so if you can break chinese relations with iran
[2:48:55.880 --> 2:48:58.560]  they lose ten or twelve percent of their oil now
[2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:01.800]  seventy eighty billion of development contracts plus
[2:49:01.800 --> 2:49:04.040]  hundreds of billions of future oil
[2:49:04.040 --> 2:49:07.040]  that they've contracted for right that could all be lost
[2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:10.640]  and what did what missus clinton was doing in saudi arabia
[2:49:10.640 --> 2:49:14.440]  she went there to get the southeast to say don't worry iran
[2:49:14.440 --> 2:49:17.600]  we will give you the oil that you would have gotten
[2:49:17.600 --> 2:49:19.200]  from iran if we
[2:49:19.200 --> 2:49:22.720]  if we put this the sanctions on iran is but it's basically a fraud
[2:49:22.720 --> 2:49:25.920]  okay well listen we understand a larger picture and this is this is really
[2:49:25.920 --> 2:49:29.120]  excellent uh... what she did is no one else can
[2:49:29.120 --> 2:49:33.440]  how do they precipitate how do they get the american people
[2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:36.120]  to go along with this attack on iran
[2:49:36.120 --> 2:49:39.800]  and militarily we know cheney they wanted a two-month sardine
[2:49:39.800 --> 2:49:43.520]  thousands of flights bombing the entire infrastructure power plants water
[2:49:43.520 --> 2:49:47.600]  treatment factories military bases navel fleets
[2:49:47.600 --> 2:49:48.760]  uh...
[2:49:48.760 --> 2:49:50.760]  how do they get us to war
[2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:53.080]  and what will the war look like
[2:49:53.080 --> 2:49:56.760]  well you know what during the course of two thousand nine one of the things we've
[2:49:56.760 --> 2:50:00.400]  seen is the return of false flag
[2:50:00.400 --> 2:50:04.560]  operations where we had major health on it for good in november
[2:50:04.560 --> 2:50:06.680]  and then we had the christmas pat c
[2:50:06.680 --> 2:50:07.280]  in
[2:50:07.280 --> 2:50:10.400]  december and even every time intelligence knows all about it and
[2:50:10.400 --> 2:50:11.400]  protects
[2:50:11.400 --> 2:50:15.240]  but then we'd be even before that during during the summer we had
[2:50:15.240 --> 2:50:16.040]  between
[2:50:16.040 --> 2:50:18.880]  plushing new york and uh... and colorado
[2:50:18.880 --> 2:50:20.480]  because they were around that
[2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:23.720]  we had the black guy dressed up with a fake beard and turban with grenade
[2:50:23.720 --> 2:50:25.360]  launchers in new jersey
[2:50:25.360 --> 2:50:26.680]  three weeks ago
[2:50:26.680 --> 2:50:31.640]  uh... the cars deal i'm sorry the uh... the uh... your uh...
[2:50:31.640 --> 2:50:36.200]  the uh... westchester pat c's who are going to attack a synagogue in river
[2:50:36.200 --> 2:50:36.920]  dale
[2:50:36.920 --> 2:50:40.520]  and uh... also at an air base a little bit north of new york city so
[2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:44.080]  that has been building up to the big big increase during two thousand and nine
[2:50:44.080 --> 2:50:47.480]  compared to stay there then we're gonna answer those two key questions straight
[2:50:47.480 --> 2:50:48.320]  out of western
[2:50:48.320 --> 2:50:49.480]  ribbon terribly
[2:50:49.480 --> 2:50:51.480]  i'm alex jones we're gonna answer
[2:50:51.480 --> 2:50:55.440]  how do they launch the false flag what will the attack on iran look like
[2:50:55.440 --> 2:50:58.320]  what will the aftermath be
[2:50:58.320 --> 2:51:01.240]  our economy is in great distress
[2:51:01.240 --> 2:51:04.760]  the financial dominoes can fall at any time
[2:51:04.760 --> 2:51:07.280]  it's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen
[2:51:07.280 --> 2:51:10.320]  and prepare just in case it does
[2:51:10.320 --> 2:51:13.000]  you have auto and home insurance
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:16.160]  why wouldn't you have food insurance
[2:51:16.160 --> 2:51:19.520]  are you prepared to feed your family long-term
[2:51:19.520 --> 2:51:22.080]  because it might take years to recover
[2:51:22.080 --> 2:51:23.280]  as the adult
[2:51:23.280 --> 2:51:28.600]  it's your responsibility to feed your family especially during rough times

[2:52:01.480 --> 2:52:04.760]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[2:52:04.760 --> 2:52:06.920]  as a finishing off this agenda
[2:52:06.920 --> 2:52:10.280]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath americans at home

[2:55:37.160 --> 2:55:40.520]  two five three three one three nine
[2:55:40.520 --> 2:55:41.620]  okay webster
[2:55:41.620 --> 2:55:43.060]  you got cut off by the break
[2:55:43.060 --> 2:55:45.000]  so i'm gonna reintroduce the questions
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:47.520]  how will they launch the world i ran
[2:55:47.520 --> 2:55:50.960]  we've got some of their public planning on how they're gonna hit iran
[2:55:50.960 --> 2:55:55.760]  who will be involved in that and what are the possible outcomes of it
[2:55:55.760 --> 2:55:59.340]  well i think that given the uh... the weakness of the u.s. in the general
[2:55:59.340 --> 2:56:02.080]  method of the people who are now in power
[2:56:02.080 --> 2:56:03.320]  probably not
[2:56:03.320 --> 2:56:07.800]  starting with a direct u.s. attack on iran but through uh...
[2:56:07.800 --> 2:56:12.320]  some proxy in that they're of course israel always comes into
[2:56:12.320 --> 2:56:14.240]  question uh...
[2:56:14.240 --> 2:56:18.760]  whether the israelis are simply going to let themselves be used for that
[2:56:18.760 --> 2:56:22.760]  i do not know but that's obviously the very great danger so you think the u.s.
[2:56:22.760 --> 2:56:27.360]  is the body in israel's the tale you don't think israel's wagon u.s. no
[2:56:27.360 --> 2:56:31.200]  no i think that that's a misconception uh... it's london in new york uh...
[2:56:31.200 --> 2:56:34.000]  and then they have client state in israel
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:37.240]  is one of them but in this case uh... that there's also there's a
[2:56:37.240 --> 2:56:40.040]  constituency in israel to do this kind of stuff
[2:56:40.040 --> 2:56:42.000]  but i think there's also an opposition
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:46.720]  uh... let's let's keep that one of the best probably the leading example right
[2:56:46.720 --> 2:56:48.280]  so then the u.s. could take
[2:56:48.280 --> 2:56:51.720]  why this is a breakaway ally we didn't do this but now
[2:56:51.720 --> 2:56:54.400]  don't you dare retaliate because that would uh...
[2:56:54.400 --> 2:56:58.080]  destabilize they said that's the policy they said israel don't attack but we
[2:56:58.080 --> 2:57:00.360]  won't stop if you do we're going to support you and if
[2:57:00.360 --> 2:57:04.840]  anybody raises a hand even block your attacks that will be called terrorism
[2:57:04.840 --> 2:57:08.080]  well the the thing that there's been the israelis in the past two years have been
[2:57:08.080 --> 2:57:10.120]  told no no no no no
[2:57:10.120 --> 2:57:14.240]  and now i wonder if that is changing behind the scene that's a big a big
[2:57:14.240 --> 2:57:15.920]  obvious uh... question
[2:57:15.920 --> 2:57:18.000]  otherwise you have all of these
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:22.520]  golf of tankenball flag event of all all different types i mean if they did the
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:24.720]  entire panoply that we've discussed
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:26.560]  over the years comes into play
[2:57:26.560 --> 2:57:29.720]  let's talk about how do you mobilize to stop this talk about i think this is
[2:57:29.720 --> 2:57:31.160]  really essential
[2:57:31.160 --> 2:57:35.960]  the first thing is this christmas patsy story right the umar farouk
[2:57:35.960 --> 2:57:38.640]  all Abdul mutalab
[2:57:38.640 --> 2:57:42.040]  has fallen apart faster and more
[2:57:42.040 --> 2:57:45.640]  than any other similar case in recent years
[2:57:45.640 --> 2:57:47.920]  because we now have the testimony
[2:57:47.920 --> 2:57:50.080]  not of just anybody
[2:57:50.080 --> 2:57:52.960]  but the undersecretary of state
[2:57:52.960 --> 2:57:56.800]  patrick kennedy undersecretary of state for management that means consular
[2:57:56.800 --> 2:57:59.400]  services and visa
[2:57:59.400 --> 2:58:01.400]  we wanted to take his
[2:58:01.400 --> 2:58:03.360]  visa away
[2:58:03.360 --> 2:58:07.240]  there's this other federal agency that overrode it and said no
[2:58:07.240 --> 2:58:09.560]  we have a national security reason
[2:58:09.560 --> 2:58:12.880]  for you to keep the visa in his hands because we're following it
[2:58:12.880 --> 2:58:15.920]  we want to know what federal agency we want to know who
[2:58:15.920 --> 2:58:17.400]  people names
[2:58:17.400 --> 2:58:18.200]  post
[2:58:18.200 --> 2:58:22.280]  well they said intelligence agency so it's probably the cia well it could be
[2:58:22.280 --> 2:58:26.280]  law enforcement to cia obviously the leading candidate but it could be the
[2:58:26.280 --> 2:58:30.200]  idea it could be somebody inside the state department itself you don't know
[2:58:30.200 --> 2:58:32.280]  stay there back in seventy seconds
[2:58:32.280 --> 2:58:36.760]  with the final hour web sir we will continue
[2:58:36.760 --> 2:58:42.600]  america's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade

[2:59:47.560 --> 3:00:08.120]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio
[3:00:08.120 --> 3:00:12.920]  here's the french news agency headline israel mulling a spring or summer war
[3:00:12.920 --> 3:00:19.800]  ockman denigy but in response ap netanyahu israel not planning war
[3:00:19.800 --> 3:00:24.600]  with iran but they continue to put out both stories
[3:00:24.600 --> 3:00:27.480]  webster tarpon says it's now on the front burner
[3:00:27.480 --> 3:00:32.040]  and it's being green-lighted notice we hear the media saying it's been red
[3:00:32.040 --> 3:00:36.680]  light and that admiral mullen and the head of the joint chiefs have said no
[3:00:36.680 --> 3:00:40.440]  webster you were getting into false flag terror as the pretext but how fast it's
[3:00:40.440 --> 3:00:44.120]  been exposed because the majority of the population knows about false
[3:00:44.120 --> 3:00:49.560]  flag and knows what to watch for so continuing with how they get the war
[3:00:49.560 --> 3:00:54.280]  with iran what happens in the war with iran how they hit iran how israel
[3:00:54.280 --> 3:00:57.640]  hits him and then what comes out of that go ahead
[3:00:57.640 --> 3:01:01.240]  again the the thing that we have to mobilize on is we now have this
[3:01:01.240 --> 3:01:05.080]  testimony from the undersecretary of state of the united states
[3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:09.240]  saying we wanted to take the visa away and somebody came forward inside the
[3:01:09.240 --> 3:01:14.920]  federal intelligence community either law enforcement or
[3:01:14.920 --> 3:01:19.480]  intelligence and said no he keeps his visa he gets on the plane in effect we
[3:01:19.480 --> 3:01:22.840]  want the incident now that's a string to pull
[3:01:22.840 --> 3:01:27.160]  you pull on that thread it leads you to the invisible government it leads you
[3:01:27.160 --> 3:01:31.560]  to dishonest to god rogue network which is an empirical reality
[3:01:31.560 --> 3:01:35.080]  not just some legend or myth or shadowy presence
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:38.200]  here it is they're caught in the act right
[3:01:38.200 --> 3:01:42.280]  they're you know red-handed so this is the time to pull on that now
[3:01:42.280 --> 3:01:45.480]  in the uh... in that house homeland security committee
[3:01:45.480 --> 3:01:48.920]  one of the people uh... leading the questioning i think is your congressman
[3:01:48.920 --> 3:01:54.440]  alex mccall is that his name yes yeah he's there right there in austin now he
[3:01:54.440 --> 3:01:58.200]  was interested in this he had benny tomsen of mississippi right a black
[3:01:58.200 --> 3:02:02.360]  democrat you had a whole bunch of these people struggling to pretending to
[3:02:02.360 --> 3:02:04.920]  struggle i don't know to figure out what this is
[3:02:04.920 --> 3:02:08.360]  the the members of the uh... of the homeland security committee you can
[3:02:08.360 --> 3:02:12.440]  look this up on their their website those are the people you want to talk to
[3:02:12.440 --> 3:02:16.200]  about this right plus obviously other people like you know leahy of vermont
[3:02:16.200 --> 3:02:18.680]  right the senate judiciary committee
[3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:23.400]  uh... this is a big big story and you can see how afraid the new york times the
[3:02:23.400 --> 3:02:26.600]  washington post and the tv network talk about they don't
[3:02:26.600 --> 3:02:30.680]  they don't cover this this is essentially a a phantom story which uh...
[3:02:30.680 --> 3:02:33.880]  you know it's out on the internet in different different websites but
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:36.920]  none of the none of the mainstream media have it because they're really afraid of
[3:02:36.920 --> 3:02:41.720]  this because this is authoritative conclusive testimony that this whole
[3:02:41.720 --> 3:02:44.280]  thing was a fraud that it was staged
[3:02:44.280 --> 3:02:47.720]  now the other side of it i would say let me appeal to people who are friendly
[3:02:47.720 --> 3:02:50.440]  to obama i'm sure there there are some listening in right
[3:02:50.440 --> 3:02:54.280]  or even you don't even have to be friendly to obama you just have to be
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:02:58.600]  uh... you know interested in the presidency or avoiding this this uh
[3:02:58.600 --> 3:03:01.320]  this outcome that we've that we've been talking about
[3:03:01.320 --> 3:03:05.080]  obama needed to fire the head of the secret service
[3:03:05.080 --> 3:03:07.560]  that was when you have three groups of people
[3:03:07.560 --> 3:03:09.160]  led into the white house
[3:03:09.160 --> 3:03:10.440]  he's got a fire
[3:03:10.440 --> 3:03:13.640]  the head of the secret service the name is escaping me right now but it's easy
[3:03:13.640 --> 3:03:14.760]  to find out
[3:03:14.760 --> 3:03:19.000]  and this woman kate ray roger's right the social secretary
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:22.280]  in the white house i mean her public policies that she's a
[3:03:22.280 --> 3:03:25.400]  a celebrity right that she wants to be a uh...
[3:03:25.400 --> 3:03:29.640]  uh... you know the famous person and therefore she she milks her job for that
[3:03:29.640 --> 3:03:32.280]  but maybe something more sinister with her so
[3:03:32.280 --> 3:03:36.200]  it would be good practice to fire her because she's the one who keeps the
[3:03:36.200 --> 3:03:38.520]  list makes the list of who gets invited
[3:03:38.520 --> 3:03:42.600]  to these white house events and the head of the secret service by all means
[3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:47.320]  should be fired generally speaking obama needed to fire people
[3:03:47.320 --> 3:03:51.640]  on january fourth january fifth when he came out with that stuff that that was
[3:03:51.640 --> 3:03:56.840]  well that richard wolf put on msnbc that the white house was considering
[3:03:56.840 --> 3:03:59.800]  that this christmas incident was a staged
[3:03:59.800 --> 3:04:02.920]  uh... intentional incident with the alternative agenda
[3:04:02.920 --> 3:04:08.280]  the only answer to that is heads must roll you've got to start firing people
[3:04:08.280 --> 3:04:12.360]  uh... whether or not you know if they're incompetent or if they're in the rogue
[3:04:12.360 --> 3:04:13.720]  network but if you
[3:04:13.720 --> 3:04:16.760]  find people who were party to this kind of a lap
[3:04:16.760 --> 3:04:17.880]  you have to fire them
[3:04:17.880 --> 3:04:20.360]  so napolitano needed to be fired
[3:04:20.360 --> 3:04:23.160]  uh... probably panetta needed to be fired
[3:04:23.160 --> 3:04:27.560]  denise blair the intelligence are certainly needed to be fired webster
[3:04:27.560 --> 3:04:31.960]  final segment with you straight ahead separately you have j rockefeller
[3:04:31.960 --> 3:04:36.120]  saying obama is not believable you've got all these people throwing him under the
[3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:39.240]  bus they've ridden this horse as far as they can
[3:04:39.240 --> 3:04:42.440]  unless they stayed some attack on him
[3:04:42.440 --> 3:04:47.240]  and i again see them preparing this you agree it's a serious danger
[3:04:47.240 --> 3:04:50.680]  i just think we really need to get out ahead of this because
[3:04:50.680 --> 3:04:53.400]  an attempted assassination will buoy him
[3:04:53.400 --> 3:04:54.360]  we'll talk about it
[3:04:54.360 --> 3:04:57.880]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[3:04:57.880 --> 3:04:58.920]  power generator
[3:04:58.920 --> 3:05:02.760]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[3:05:02.760 --> 3:05:03.240]  bill
[3:05:03.240 --> 3:05:07.480]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[3:05:07.480 --> 3:05:09.000]  company allows you to have
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:13.160]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[3:05:13.160 --> 3:05:14.600]  technology is coming
[3:05:14.600 --> 3:05:18.280]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[3:05:18.280 --> 3:05:19.000]  overloaded
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:22.920]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[3:05:22.920 --> 3:05:26.440]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[3:05:26.440 --> 3:05:30.120]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[3:05:30.120 --> 3:05:34.280]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[3:05:34.280 --> 3:05:36.680]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power
[3:05:36.680 --> 3:05:40.120]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[3:08:04.680 --> 3:08:08.440]  okay i want to try to cover a bunch of other little subjects here
[3:08:08.440 --> 3:08:12.360]  with webster problem before he leaves us
[3:08:12.360 --> 3:08:16.920]  in areas of australia china italy new zealand
[3:08:16.920 --> 3:08:19.720]  two weeks ago and this came out in mainstream news
[3:08:19.720 --> 3:08:24.920]  info wars.com prisonplanet.com got banned
[3:08:24.920 --> 3:08:29.640]  we had a google shopping cart we launched and they came and banned it
[3:08:29.640 --> 3:08:34.200]  and said that it's advocating against a protected group
[3:08:34.200 --> 3:08:37.480]  and the shopping cart we started with them only had a few of my films and we
[3:08:37.480 --> 3:08:42.280]  you know we're not a racial show uh even if we were shouldn't we be allowed to
[3:08:42.280 --> 3:08:45.480]  sell things because then once you start that discrimination it happens
[3:08:45.480 --> 3:08:49.400]  to everybody i mean we're all about bringing people together
[3:08:49.400 --> 3:08:53.480]  and we got direct letter from google saying
[3:08:53.480 --> 3:08:57.240]  uh well you can read the letter at prisonplanet.com poll was written
[3:08:57.240 --> 3:09:01.160]  article google bans dvd critical of obama administration
[3:09:01.160 --> 3:09:06.360]  both the obama deception and fall the republic we even with other merchant
[3:09:06.360 --> 3:09:10.280]  accounts went and set them up just with one video
[3:09:10.280 --> 3:09:14.760]  and they sent us a letter and said basically no criticism of obama
[3:09:14.760 --> 3:09:18.760]  because he's black people get confused by this i don't care if he's black
[3:09:18.760 --> 3:09:22.360]  chinese anglo-saxon jewish it doesn't matter
[3:09:22.360 --> 3:09:27.720]  it's what he does he's a puppet and people get confused when i go over the
[3:09:27.720 --> 3:09:31.320]  math of this technically he's six percent african
[3:09:31.320 --> 3:09:35.800]  if you look at his eight grandparents one of them was half african so he's six
[3:09:35.800 --> 3:09:40.920]  percent see so i mean because he's six percent black
[3:09:40.920 --> 3:09:44.440]  you can't you know i mean i sell videos exposing
[3:09:44.440 --> 3:09:48.840]  black genocide how they abort more black babies that are born
[3:09:48.840 --> 3:09:52.200]  in game exposes the but doesn't matter even if i was
[3:09:52.200 --> 3:09:55.160]  bashing black people i mean every time i talk about
[3:09:55.160 --> 3:09:59.080]  kool-aid drinkers that just means jim jones i get news articles saying i'm
[3:09:59.080 --> 3:10:02.600]  saying black string kool-aid i don't know even know what that means
[3:10:02.600 --> 3:10:06.600]  it's like you can't say government's programs corrupt or you're racist i
[3:10:06.600 --> 3:10:11.080]  mean they they're playing the race card as big city
[3:10:11.080 --> 3:10:17.800]  machines do and we now see time newsweek all these other publications
[3:10:17.800 --> 3:10:21.480]  microsoft's head technology officer bill gates comes out and supports it the
[3:10:21.480 --> 3:10:25.880]  un supports it cast sunstein writes papers saying at the
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:28.520]  white house we've got a restrict free speech ban
[3:10:28.520 --> 3:10:32.200]  criticizing man-made global warming newsweek comes out and says it's a
[3:10:32.200 --> 3:10:35.640]  conspiracy theory that climate gate never even happened
[3:10:35.640 --> 3:10:41.160]  webster they are really moving ahead with chinese style net censorship here in
[3:10:41.160 --> 3:10:44.840]  the west are you concerned about this i wouldn't call it that chinese this is
[3:10:44.840 --> 3:10:48.760]  american style and even worse yeah what you what you're pointing to because it's
[3:10:48.760 --> 3:10:52.360]  more hypocritical um let me stop you let them know
[3:10:52.360 --> 3:10:56.680]  they want a web id to get online and then government indexes over cyber
[3:10:56.680 --> 3:10:59.960]  security that ban anything they want from any network go ahead
[3:10:59.960 --> 3:11:03.160]  but look at the look at the context for this it's very interesting like google
[3:11:03.160 --> 3:11:06.680]  moves against you probably in the same week
[3:11:06.680 --> 3:11:11.640]  that google announced the united front with the national security agency
[3:11:11.640 --> 3:11:15.640]  practically a merger i did a commentary if people are interested on on
[3:11:15.640 --> 3:11:19.960]  toply dot net you can see my commentary on russia to you're also on russia
[3:11:19.960 --> 3:11:23.880]  today we played it here yes about this stuff because the google
[3:11:23.880 --> 3:11:29.240]  has always been a protégé of uh... essentially of the u.s intelligence
[3:11:29.240 --> 3:11:32.200]  can you tell and i had steel the former cia
[3:11:32.200 --> 3:11:36.280]  technologist uh technologist on he said five years four years ago
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:41.560]  it was created by the cia right and and what people know as google earth
[3:11:41.560 --> 3:11:47.400]  was the cia's project keyhole so uh... there it is right at the ticket to go
[3:11:47.400 --> 3:11:49.960]  back over it because what does this signify
[3:11:49.960 --> 3:11:53.960]  that the u.s only censors when it's getting ready for war
[3:11:53.960 --> 3:11:58.120]  well they beat the hypocrisy of google is google says they object to chinese
[3:11:58.120 --> 3:12:01.000]  censorship but they are themselves an engine
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:05.320]  of u.s censorship right they've done this now to you i can i can also take this
[3:12:05.320 --> 3:12:08.520]  instance of civil admins when she was going to appear
[3:12:08.520 --> 3:12:12.200]  uh... before the congress to testify google shut down her blog
[3:12:12.200 --> 3:12:15.960]  which he located on on google because they didn't like
[3:12:15.960 --> 3:12:19.480]  uh... the content of it like it was a challenge to the official nine eleven
[3:12:19.480 --> 3:12:24.120]  story and other whistleblowing themes notice though in china they might
[3:12:24.120 --> 3:12:28.200]  accuse you of anti-state activity but in the united states you're accused of
[3:12:28.200 --> 3:12:33.000]  spamming or you're attacking some protected group right hate speech or
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:37.000]  something like this but this is the essence of uh... of censorship and
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:41.880]  people need to be aware that these companies right from twitter to google
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:45.720]  they come on the scene as wonderful paladins of free speech
[3:12:45.720 --> 3:12:48.680]  are in reality tools of the intelligence community
[3:12:48.680 --> 3:12:52.280]  and you see right twitter in iran google versus china
[3:12:52.280 --> 3:12:56.680]  and so forth that they are simply uh... instruments of imperialism quite frankly
[3:12:56.680 --> 3:13:00.680]  in a mind control and people therefore need to need to know that and and
[3:13:00.680 --> 3:13:04.760]  certainly uh... defend the people that are getting targeted with this stuff
[3:13:04.760 --> 3:13:07.880]  uh... that's one of the features let me just add let me just have to
[3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:11.480]  interrupt you here's pc world today why google has become
[3:13:11.480 --> 3:13:16.280]  microsoft's evil twin and then it goes on to say the backlash over google buzz
[3:13:16.280 --> 3:13:19.880]  reveals an even bigger problem that the people behind the search engine
[3:13:19.880 --> 3:13:24.040]  are deeply out of touch so even mainline pc world
[3:13:24.040 --> 3:13:27.160]  is saying they are evil we have the head of apple
[3:13:27.160 --> 3:13:31.880]  jobs saying their slogan don't be evil is a joke i mean
[3:13:31.880 --> 3:13:35.960]  webster we are getting hundreds of emails a day with screenshots
[3:13:35.960 --> 3:13:41.160]  of time warner cox all over the world banning going to info wars in prison
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:44.040]  planet everybody needs to go to banner hangs
[3:13:44.040 --> 3:13:47.640]  they need to support our sites what is it that my sights are doing
[3:13:47.640 --> 3:13:51.400]  that has them coming after us webster well if it's a challenge to the uh...
[3:13:51.400 --> 3:13:56.120]  the mind control universe of of these uh... forces right and then you can see
[3:13:56.120 --> 3:14:00.120]  that that they they feel that they've absorbed the tea party
[3:14:00.120 --> 3:14:04.040]  movement in that they've somehow brought that back under the control
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:08.920]  of traditional bankrupt republican politicians right the deep
[3:14:08.920 --> 3:14:13.240]  pro-war pro-globalist pro-federal reserve
[3:14:13.240 --> 3:14:18.360]  republican party is out supporting john mccain reelection rick perry all
[3:14:18.360 --> 3:14:19.720]  globalist
[3:14:19.720 --> 3:14:23.160]  yes and and uh... therefore they they say well that you know we'll draw the
[3:14:23.160 --> 3:14:26.360]  line right in the woods will it will erect a a border
[3:14:26.360 --> 3:14:31.560]  at the uh... at the extreme of the of the uh... tea party might say that anybody
[3:14:31.560 --> 3:14:35.640]  who is not a war monger anybody who's interested in in uh... in
[3:14:35.640 --> 3:14:40.040]  nationalizing the federal reserve anybody who's interested in in a bunch of
[3:14:40.040 --> 3:14:43.000]  other themes is going to be declared totally heretical
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:47.240]  and beyond the project because the core of the tea party is nine eleven truth
[3:14:47.240 --> 3:14:50.600]  it is patriots it's a true populist diverse movement
[3:14:50.600 --> 3:14:53.960]  they're scared to death of the real tea party so they've got a shot down the
[3:14:53.960 --> 3:14:57.880]  real tea party but they would like to make this into a kind of lost parole
[3:14:57.880 --> 3:15:01.800]  movement that's of just about exclusively concerned with taxes
[3:15:01.800 --> 3:15:05.720]  and deficits right and ignores the issue of the general depression
[3:15:05.720 --> 3:15:09.240]  and above all ignores unemployment right not interested at all in the question
[3:15:09.240 --> 3:15:09.880]  of
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:14.920]  they're probably so what do we do about the growing censorship and open calls
[3:15:14.920 --> 3:15:17.960]  and i mean i've read the cyber security bill on air
[3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:21.880]  it's the total takeover of all infrastructure and open censorship
[3:15:21.880 --> 3:15:25.480]  well the secret of the first amendment has always been used it or lose it
[3:15:25.480 --> 3:15:29.080]  now with the first amendment lives through us and it it atrophies and
[3:15:29.080 --> 3:15:32.440]  wilts in any generation when people don't use it
[3:15:32.440 --> 3:15:35.640]  as vigorously as possible so the idea is simply uh...
[3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:40.120]  promote uh... the kind of media that you represent and and uh... make that into a
[3:15:40.120 --> 3:15:41.160]  a mass
[3:15:41.160 --> 3:15:45.240]  a vehicle right a clearinghouse in exchange for all kinds of ideas
[3:15:45.240 --> 3:15:45.880]  uh...
[3:15:45.880 --> 3:15:49.400]  i don't think that it's going to be possible for anybody to in
[3:15:49.400 --> 3:15:51.000]  to reimpose the uh...
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:15:54.920]  orthodoxy on global warming i think i'm sitting at home now
[3:15:54.920 --> 3:15:55.720]  i've got
[3:15:55.720 --> 3:15:59.560]  snow piled up about five feet high in my front yard
[3:15:59.560 --> 3:16:03.800]  that i had to shovel off the driveway and the sidewalks over a period of
[3:16:03.800 --> 3:16:05.080]  several days
[3:16:05.080 --> 3:16:06.040]  uh...
[3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:09.800]  global warming is pretty much a dead duck here in uh...
[3:16:09.800 --> 3:16:13.400]  in the middle let me stop you sure jones comes out and says we've been
[3:16:13.400 --> 3:16:15.800]  cooling since nineteen ninety five
[3:16:15.800 --> 3:16:19.080]  all the universities are caught in red-handed fraud but sharia ripping
[3:16:19.080 --> 3:16:20.120]  everybody off
[3:16:20.120 --> 3:16:23.560]  you've got the head climatologist at nasa saying we want to destroy industrial
[3:16:23.560 --> 3:16:24.440]  society
[3:16:24.440 --> 3:16:26.280]  we have the u n saying it
[3:16:26.280 --> 3:16:27.640]  austin announces
[3:16:27.640 --> 3:16:32.120]  we're gonna put two point six billion in energy taxes in the next three years
[3:16:32.120 --> 3:16:35.800]  the whole city's going bankrupt they're robbing everything
[3:16:35.800 --> 3:16:39.400]  you say it's dead but yeah they don't care webster
[3:16:39.400 --> 3:16:42.440]  they're just going ahead with it at the barrel of the gun
[3:16:42.440 --> 3:16:47.160]  well uh... activism is the only cure and above all the kind of activism we're
[3:16:47.160 --> 3:16:50.360]  gonna need is some some organizational form
[3:16:50.360 --> 3:16:53.080]  uh... if you look at the debate inside the tea party
[3:16:53.080 --> 3:16:57.920]  the authentic people are the people who say no to the democrats no to the
[3:16:57.920 --> 3:17:00.360]  republicans therefore we must consider
[3:17:00.360 --> 3:17:03.920]  a third party or something along these lines independent
[3:17:03.920 --> 3:17:07.240]  of the bankrupt politicians of the current majority and the current
[3:17:07.240 --> 3:17:08.280]  minority
[3:17:08.280 --> 3:17:11.160]  uh... and therefore i would urge people to think about this too
[3:17:11.160 --> 3:17:15.480]  because if you don't translate uh... you know movement and ferment into an
[3:17:15.480 --> 3:17:19.960]  organizational structure that remains that remains as a vehicle
[3:17:19.960 --> 3:17:23.880]  uh... then ultimately you're going to be reabsorbed right in this appellant
[3:17:23.880 --> 3:17:25.120]  actually came out and said it
[3:17:25.120 --> 3:17:28.400]  palin said the republican party should absorb
[3:17:28.400 --> 3:17:30.000]  the tea party
[3:17:30.000 --> 3:17:33.040]  largely i think they've they've done it although some people
[3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:35.960]  uh... would would like to break off from that the people who would like to
[3:17:35.960 --> 3:17:37.600]  break off from the tea party
[3:17:37.600 --> 3:17:40.480]  i think should now consider along with others right
[3:17:40.480 --> 3:17:44.680]  open it up to people who are anti-war open it up to people who uh...
[3:17:44.680 --> 3:17:48.840]  who are you know leftist uh... but i'll let the center whatever it is right
[3:17:48.840 --> 3:17:53.680]  people if you know if you're anti-war anti-federal reserve anti-globalization
[3:17:53.680 --> 3:17:56.280]  i think that's a that's a good basis for discussion
[3:17:56.280 --> 3:17:59.240]  and then work out the differences on the other things but you're going to need
[3:17:59.240 --> 3:18:03.600]  an organizational form and again the big question is you can listen to hannity
[3:18:03.600 --> 3:18:08.080]  listen to to uh... limbaugh every day they say we need the republican party the
[3:18:08.080 --> 3:18:11.880]  republican party the republican party anybody who is saying that and and
[3:18:11.880 --> 3:18:14.080]  simply leave it at that i think is uh...
[3:18:14.080 --> 3:18:17.360]  essentially giving people a pump steer
[3:18:17.360 --> 3:18:21.820]  well i agree with you and there's no doubt we're going into very
[3:18:21.820 --> 3:18:25.640]  tumultuous times right now and all of our voices
[3:18:25.640 --> 3:18:29.600]  are more important and will be listened to more than ever
[3:18:29.600 --> 3:18:32.520]  right now
[3:18:32.520 --> 3:18:36.080]  again we're being censored we're being attacked we're being hit from all sides
[3:18:36.080 --> 3:18:37.360]  and it's because
[3:18:37.360 --> 3:18:40.380]  we have been effective here info wars dot com
[3:18:40.380 --> 3:18:44.560]  and present planet dot com we're a platform for ron paul webster tarpley
[3:18:44.560 --> 3:18:46.200]  and sheriff mac
[3:18:46.200 --> 3:18:50.920]  and countless other sheriff max in the new york times saying he came on the show
[3:18:50.920 --> 3:18:55.560]  and energized him nationwide for speaking engagements to thousands
[3:18:55.560 --> 3:18:58.080]  uh... from the show
[3:18:58.080 --> 3:19:00.480]  and that's why we're under attack because
[3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:04.560]  love alex jones are hating the point is we're a launch pad
[3:19:04.560 --> 3:19:08.240]  from what we've built to all these different diverse ideas
[3:19:08.240 --> 3:19:12.520]  they're outside the very small cloistered
[3:19:12.520 --> 3:19:16.200]  uh... confines of globalist speak
[3:19:16.200 --> 3:19:18.920]  and this propaganda mind control universe
[3:19:18.920 --> 3:19:21.600]  the webster tarpley was talking about and that's why we need you more than

[3:28:51.800 --> 3:28:57.000]  zones and not letting people have coal mines or gold mines or oil rigs or
[3:28:57.000 --> 3:29:00.840]  factories or businesses for hundreds of square miles around

[3:35:44.720 --> 3:35:49.280]  government okay going to darwin bettaker
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:54.560]  this became a national story because a listener called me the sunday
[3:35:54.560 --> 3:35:59.120]  that the show was their final day there and said
[3:35:59.120 --> 3:36:02.240]  they ordered them to post a notice saying no private sale of farms well
[3:36:02.240 --> 3:36:05.680]  there's no law against that and the police lied and said oh we didn't do
[3:36:05.680 --> 3:36:08.560]  that and later they said yeah we did order them basically to shut down
[3:36:08.560 --> 3:36:12.240]  it was a nuisance abatement like a crack house
[3:36:12.240 --> 3:36:17.120]  then they had a staged arrest that wasn't unarrested let the guy go
[3:36:17.120 --> 3:36:22.240]  where they just put him in handcuffs and let him out
[3:36:22.240 --> 3:36:25.680]  they told the media basically that darwin was the previous saxon who were
[3:36:25.680 --> 3:36:30.160]  great people who'd been there since the early 1990s who they ran out of town
[3:36:30.160 --> 3:36:34.000]  the biggest gun show in texas so texasgunshows.net
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:38.000]  only has two shows in texas very small but a great outfit
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:41.840]  they got then after they stood up against them h e b just said look just get
[3:36:41.840 --> 3:36:46.560]  out of here your your lease is over you're not allowed to be here
[3:36:46.560 --> 3:36:50.160]  and the vatf who ordered this and the police then were more honest and said
[3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:53.920]  yeah the fed said do this we did it so amazing
[3:36:53.920 --> 3:37:00.880]  absolutely amazing that all of this has gone on and the establishment
[3:37:00.880 --> 3:37:04.400]  tried to come in and get people to in-fight locally to get it shifted
[3:37:04.400 --> 3:37:07.840]  off the story of the gun show that we broke onto other issues that hasn't
[3:37:07.840 --> 3:37:10.640]  worked they were able to secure another great location
[3:37:10.640 --> 3:37:14.000]  this time in south austin we're going to give you that address and it's coming
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:18.400]  up this saturday and sunday in austin texas darwin bettiger good to have you
[3:37:18.400 --> 3:37:23.680]  back on with us good good to be back on alex i really appreciate it
[3:37:23.680 --> 3:37:26.960]  what's your general take on everything that's happened
[3:37:26.960 --> 3:37:31.840]  in this saga and then bring us up to date on what's coming up this saturday and
[3:37:31.840 --> 3:37:35.440]  sunday okay well first let me start by saying
[3:37:35.440 --> 3:37:39.680]  i you know i really appreciate uh you know y'all breaking the story and and
[3:37:39.680 --> 3:37:43.840]  all your listeners have been you know overwhelmingly uh supportive
[3:37:43.840 --> 3:37:48.000]  and you know i really really want to thank everybody on your staff for
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:51.840]  for keeping in contact with me and and y'all definitely been leading the
[3:37:51.840 --> 3:37:55.280]  leading the fight to try to get us a a new location but
[3:37:55.280 --> 3:37:59.440]  we haven't been able to to find a new location like you said it's an old target
[3:37:59.440 --> 3:38:04.240]  building with 110 000 square feet so it's about three times bigger
[3:38:04.240 --> 3:38:07.680]  than where we were before so there's plenty of room to
[3:38:07.680 --> 3:38:11.520]  to make it probably the largest show in all of central south texas
[3:38:11.520 --> 3:38:15.760]  and uh we'll be there we'll be there this weekend like you said
[3:38:15.760 --> 3:38:19.360]  and we're just trying to get as many people out to to show you know support
[3:38:19.360 --> 3:38:23.920]  for the second amendment and and uh you know let the awesome pd
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:28.080]  know that that we're not going anywhere that well we're here to stay
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:31.680]  yeah here's the key they'll probably because you talk about how they just
[3:38:31.680 --> 3:38:35.360]  walk in the back door like they own it they're not allowed to do that lawfully
[3:38:35.360 --> 3:38:38.720]  so we're gonna have people watching those doors i'm gonna as you told me
[3:38:38.720 --> 3:38:41.440]  off air no cameras are allowed but ours to try to
[3:38:41.440 --> 3:38:45.760]  control and stop any provocaturing you talked about printing off a little
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:38:48.960]  leaflet to people that are doing private sales that you better ask for a
[3:38:48.960 --> 3:38:53.280]  driver's license under under state and federal law
[3:38:53.280 --> 3:38:56.640]  you know to make sure they are a citizen but it's a private sale if they are
[3:38:56.640 --> 3:38:59.520]  able to push this through through law which they've tried you won't be able to
[3:38:59.520 --> 3:39:02.000]  give your son or daughter a gun or your wife a gun
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:05.040]  that this is the so-called gun show loophole private sale they want to shut
[3:39:05.040 --> 3:39:09.280]  down they're harassing not just gun shows but also
[3:39:09.280 --> 3:39:15.040]  swap meets bazaars garage sales this is a big fight nationwide
[3:39:15.040 --> 3:39:21.440]  obama has announced that on gun control on amnesty on open borders
[3:39:21.440 --> 3:39:25.360]  on the green taxes he's going to use executive orders and just
[3:39:25.360 --> 3:39:29.920]  this is in the new york times and orders to the bureaucracy outside of law not
[3:39:29.920 --> 3:39:33.840]  even executive order to just do whatever he wants and then this is a test in
[3:39:33.840 --> 3:39:38.240]  austin so we've got to make sure that there's always eyes and ears there every
[3:39:38.240 --> 3:39:41.200]  month this is a major battleground there's no
[3:39:41.200 --> 3:39:44.400]  doubt they're going to try to run you out we need everybody to be there this
[3:39:44.400 --> 3:39:48.960]  month next month the month after because this is a national fight
[3:39:48.960 --> 3:39:52.880]  with the bat fe and so i'm going to have a crew there from
[3:39:52.880 --> 3:39:56.800]  the opening of the show to the shutdown each day i'm going to be popping in
[3:39:56.800 --> 3:39:59.920]  as well we've got tables up at the front you've given us we're very thankful for
[3:39:59.920 --> 3:40:04.480]  that tell people the location when it opens
[3:40:04.480 --> 3:40:07.440]  am i correct in saying you've sold out the tables
[3:40:07.440 --> 3:40:10.560]  i know we still have some tables available like i said that the building
[3:40:10.560 --> 3:40:14.640]  itself is a hundred ten thousand square feet so if we ever did fill up the
[3:40:14.640 --> 3:40:17.600]  entire building you'd be looking at about a thousand tables
[3:40:17.600 --> 3:40:21.200]  but uh... we we have we still have room uh... you know for anybody else that
[3:40:21.200 --> 3:40:25.040]  wants them last night tables and we'll you know we'll find them a spot
[3:40:25.040 --> 3:40:29.440]  definitely and we need people there with books and videos and material not
[3:40:29.440 --> 3:40:34.160]  just guns to make this an educational experience again we're going to be there
[3:40:34.160 --> 3:40:38.880]  uh... but uh... very very exciting uh... now the address is at texasgunshows.net
[3:40:38.880 --> 3:40:42.240]  but give people the address who aren't on the internet
[3:40:42.240 --> 3:40:48.560]  yes it's 6405 south iH 35 it's on the south side of
[3:40:48.560 --> 3:40:53.520]  austin it's exit 228 which is the william cannon exit
[3:40:53.520 --> 3:40:57.920]  and it's really fine it's right behind the mcdonald's right there
[3:40:57.920 --> 3:41:02.000]  absolutely it's in south austin right off
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:05.760]  i-35 in the target center very easy to find
[3:41:05.760 --> 3:41:12.560]  give folks that address one more time yes there's 6405 south iH 35
[3:41:12.560 --> 3:41:16.080]  i mean it's really easy on easy off you don't have to go you know
[3:41:16.080 --> 3:41:18.880]  very far off the 35 it's it's right off the access
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:22.720]  it's an old super target building now what if folks want to call and book a
[3:41:22.720 --> 3:41:25.760]  table and and can't get online what's the phone number
[3:41:25.760 --> 3:41:33.520]  it's uh... 210 8727469 and the other thing i was going to mention is
[3:41:33.520 --> 3:41:37.200]  you know we're trying to make this a record record show just to show
[3:41:37.200 --> 3:41:40.240]  uh... apd that we're back in full strength and
[3:41:40.240 --> 3:41:43.600]  if anybody that that's listening i know you have a lot of listeners that will
[3:41:43.600 --> 3:41:46.160]  not be able to make it uh... to the show
[3:41:46.160 --> 3:41:50.160]  they can still visit the website to buy complimentary tickets online
[3:41:50.160 --> 3:41:53.200]  and uh... that's open available for those people
[3:41:53.200 --> 3:41:56.560]  and again you put all this advertising in when they shut the other showdown
[3:41:56.560 --> 3:41:59.520]  this is really set you back so it's important
[3:41:59.520 --> 3:42:03.600]  just like in 1776 to financially support that's one of the biggest ways
[3:42:03.600 --> 3:42:07.680]  people can vote you also have a petition on there tell
[3:42:07.680 --> 3:42:10.720]  folks about the petition yeah we have a petition on our
[3:42:10.720 --> 3:42:13.440]  website that you can go on there and and sign
[3:42:13.440 --> 3:42:16.640]  and uh... when we collect a hundred fifty thousand signatures which were
[3:42:16.640 --> 3:42:19.920]  well on our way we're gonna turn that over to the attorney general just to let
[3:42:19.920 --> 3:42:24.320]  them know that that you know you have a lot of a lot of upset americans a lot
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:27.360]  upset texas that you know they don't want you uh...
[3:42:27.360 --> 3:42:31.120]  they don't want you getting into their gun rent
[3:42:31.120 --> 3:42:35.440]  and i want to warn the federal police force we have that masquerades is the
[3:42:35.440 --> 3:42:38.880]  austin police department in violation of state law
[3:42:38.880 --> 3:42:42.480]  i want to tell them something i know most of police officers themselves are
[3:42:42.480 --> 3:42:45.520]  against what happened but when i showed up at that
[3:42:45.520 --> 3:42:50.800]  protest uh... you know not a rally it was a protest
[3:42:50.800 --> 3:42:54.480]  uh... and when i showed up there and i saw police and we have a video of this
[3:42:54.480 --> 3:42:58.480]  we've been so busy we haven't posted it up there with their sniper rifles on us
[3:42:58.480 --> 3:43:02.880]  and police in the windows taking photos of everybody that made me angry
[3:43:02.880 --> 3:43:05.760]  now again the average cop is against what's happened here knows the police
[3:43:05.760 --> 3:43:08.800]  officers came with you friends of yours from san antonio
[3:43:08.800 --> 3:43:11.680]  so we need police officers who said they're going to support to come out as
[3:43:11.680 --> 3:43:16.240]  well and uh... let people know that you're against what's happening we know
[3:43:16.240 --> 3:43:20.000]  most police are pro second amendment we appreciate that but
[3:43:20.000 --> 3:43:24.160]  the governor rick perry when he was questioned by richard reeves
[3:43:24.160 --> 3:43:27.360]  and i i would imagine you've seen that uh... video darwin
[3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:31.840]  oh yeah i've seen it he said it does look like harassment intimidation
[3:43:31.840 --> 3:43:35.120]  and if they do it again it's clearly criminal
[3:43:35.120 --> 3:43:39.680]  so i want to warn them do not engage in the type of racketeering you've already
[3:43:39.680 --> 3:43:42.880]  engaged in don't try it because
[3:43:42.880 --> 3:43:45.200]  we're going to be there at the shows other people are going to be there at
[3:43:45.200 --> 3:43:48.560]  the shows when they drag somebody out for a fake arrest we're going to
[3:43:48.560 --> 3:43:52.160]  document it and they need to follow the law
[3:43:52.160 --> 3:43:56.240]  and not the federal government
[3:43:56.240 --> 3:43:59.280]  yeah another thing i was going to mention is you know a lot of people that
[3:43:59.280 --> 3:44:03.200]  haven't actually been to a gun show that want to see their rights protected
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:06.240]  uh... i don't want them to think that it's just guns you know that are being
[3:44:06.240 --> 3:44:10.800]  sold there there's jewelry and find jewelry guns i mean it's
[3:44:10.800 --> 3:44:15.760]  it's a ride blow dart blow dart blow dart
[3:44:15.760 --> 3:44:20.400]  guns that are fun crossbows archery stuff what i love is the bird bombs
[3:44:20.400 --> 3:44:22.720]  i don't shoot them at birds that are on runways
[3:44:22.720 --> 3:44:26.080]  but what they're meant for i like taking them out to a pond and
[3:44:26.080 --> 3:44:29.680]  and i mean it's a high-powered firecracker a lot better one you can buy
[3:44:29.680 --> 3:44:33.200]  from a firework store shooting into the water and you see the big flash under
[3:44:33.200 --> 3:44:37.200]  water a lot of fun toys oh yeah no they're they're a lot of fun
[3:44:37.200 --> 3:44:41.200]  and i mean it's a it's a wide assortment of products that's going to be sold
[3:44:41.200 --> 3:44:44.480]  there we're going to have both dealers there and everything else that course
[3:44:44.480 --> 3:44:47.920]  you know would y'all be in there it should be one of our best shows ever
[3:44:47.920 --> 3:44:50.160]  i'm really i'm really looking forward to it
[3:44:50.160 --> 3:44:53.440]  absolutely because you know i had michael bagnarica on earlier he didn't
[3:44:53.440 --> 3:44:56.480]  even know that you guys have got another show so quickly
[3:44:56.480 --> 3:45:00.160]  so a lot of people don't know so it's important for all the activists listeners
[3:45:00.160 --> 3:45:03.760]  and people to understand that we're going to have a table there
[3:45:03.760 --> 3:45:06.800]  selling our books and videos but really that's just because my
[3:45:06.800 --> 3:45:12.560]  guys are going to be staking it out we need to stand up to the feds and the
[3:45:12.560 --> 3:45:15.760]  police that are out of control the leadership and let them know we're not
[3:45:15.760 --> 3:45:17.840]  putting up with this and again i'm going to be
[3:45:17.840 --> 3:45:21.440]  popping in quite frankly i'm going to be in the parking lot watching the back
[3:45:21.440 --> 3:45:24.400]  doors people really want to know or somewhere else
[3:45:24.400 --> 3:45:28.320]  the point is is that i'm going to be sneaking around
[3:45:28.320 --> 3:45:32.240]  and you may see me if you if you look carefully uh but i'm definitely going to
[3:45:32.240 --> 3:45:35.920]  be there the point is point is is that they'll probably
[3:45:35.920 --> 3:45:39.520]  hit you in three months and and so that's why it's important
[3:45:39.520 --> 3:45:42.720]  for people to be watching the next six months or so
[3:45:42.720 --> 3:45:48.080]  this is a critical national test do you agree darwin buddiger
[3:45:48.080 --> 3:45:51.760]  yeah no absolutely and and you know the other thing i was going to mention is
[3:45:51.760 --> 3:45:55.120]  you know the the more people the more people they show up in the the bigger
[3:45:55.120 --> 3:45:59.120]  the crowd look i think that the the least likely that
[3:45:59.120 --> 3:46:02.800]  they'll try the same tactics that they did it's only because you know we had
[3:46:02.800 --> 3:46:06.080]  such a small show and uh because of the recommendations
[3:46:06.080 --> 3:46:09.360]  we had to follow that that allowed you know that allowed them to come in and
[3:46:09.360 --> 3:46:12.640]  basically intimidate you know intimidate me by by you know
[3:46:12.640 --> 3:46:15.360]  having such a small show where if there's large numbers there in a
[3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:18.560]  great turnout i think that'd be you know least likely to happen
[3:46:18.560 --> 3:46:22.880]  well the key is darwin you got bushwhacked you got
[3:46:22.880 --> 3:46:26.960]  called in three days before the show and told this is the way it is
[3:46:26.960 --> 3:46:29.360]  and they were so dumbed down they thought you were the last show they'd
[3:46:29.360 --> 3:46:33.280]  criminally run out and now you're standing up and
[3:46:33.280 --> 3:46:36.480]  you stood up day one and had the petition there and that's why they punish
[3:46:36.480 --> 3:46:40.560]  you by shutting your show down if we allow them to shut down commerce google
[3:46:40.560 --> 3:46:44.400]  has banned us selling on a google shopping cart
[3:46:44.400 --> 3:46:49.360]  obama deception fall the republic that stories up on prisonplanet.com
[3:46:49.360 --> 3:46:53.520]  they're trying to ban our commerce in self-defense implements
[3:46:53.520 --> 3:46:58.640]  in freedom teeth and this is how tyranny works it tries to shut
[3:46:58.640 --> 3:47:02.640]  people down from their right to commerce this is really a property a
[3:47:02.640 --> 3:47:05.440]  private property and a right to contract issue
[3:47:05.440 --> 3:47:08.640]  and they want to keep this illusion going that it's illegal to sell your
[3:47:08.640 --> 3:47:11.520]  neighbor a gun or illegal for a private seller to go sell
[3:47:11.520 --> 3:47:15.920]  somebody a gun but when i went to the impromptu
[3:47:15.920 --> 3:47:20.240]  demonstration at the police station you know i handed out hundreds
[3:47:20.240 --> 3:47:23.840]  my dad showed up without me even knowing
[3:47:23.840 --> 3:47:28.240]  that he was coming handing out the law from the batf zone website
[3:47:28.240 --> 3:47:33.040]  explaining it is not illegal to privately sell guns but they got on the
[3:47:33.040 --> 3:47:37.520]  news and said it was illegal yeah you know the thing that that strikes me is
[3:47:37.520 --> 3:47:41.120]  is strange is you know when the story broke and then
[3:47:41.120 --> 3:47:43.920]  you know your your staff was the one that
[3:47:43.920 --> 3:47:48.400]  that broke it but you know all these tv stations and everybody in austin
[3:47:48.400 --> 3:47:50.960]  uh... media outlets they all wanted interviews and they all want to know
[3:47:50.960 --> 3:47:54.720]  what's going on but you know now that we found a new location to me i would
[3:47:54.720 --> 3:47:58.880]  think that would be just as big of news that we're actually back in austin
[3:47:58.880 --> 3:48:02.480]  and you know nobody you know none of these uh... liberal tv stations are
[3:48:02.480 --> 3:48:06.000]  calling one you know to talk about how the show is back on or anything like
[3:48:06.000 --> 3:48:09.520]  that i find that strange no they just wanted to celebrate that they'd shut
[3:48:09.520 --> 3:48:12.960]  down freedom in austin and now that it's back
[3:48:12.960 --> 3:48:16.240]  they don't want people to know but folks should call all those stations
[3:48:16.240 --> 3:48:20.000]  and invite them out i'm sure you talked to them if they came out
[3:48:20.000 --> 3:48:23.680]  oh yeah yeah now i talked to them i did you know at there at the rally i i talked
[3:48:23.680 --> 3:48:26.800]  to a few stations and everyone of them said well you know definitely let us
[3:48:26.800 --> 3:48:30.480]  know as soon as you find a new location and i've done that and they you know
[3:48:30.480 --> 3:48:33.920]  they haven't really expressed any interest
[3:48:33.920 --> 3:48:38.960]  well they want to do what they've done in the dark i will say the cbs guy came up
[3:48:38.960 --> 3:48:42.400]  and said alex i'm a listener of yours look all i did was report what the police
[3:48:42.400 --> 3:48:46.800]  told me and i gave him the law and he did report it so cbs did
[3:48:46.800 --> 3:48:49.600]  rectify some of what they've done but i still said
[3:48:49.600 --> 3:48:54.720]  why do you just believe whatever the police tell you
[3:48:54.720 --> 3:48:57.920]  i'm sorry my phone was getting out i would you say no i mean i just said to
[3:48:57.920 --> 3:49:02.320]  cbs why do you just believe whatever the police tell you
[3:49:02.320 --> 3:49:05.920]  well yeah i know i i mean that that's what i don't understand either because
[3:49:05.920 --> 3:49:08.640]  you know they're gonna spend it they're gonna the police are gonna spend in
[3:49:08.640 --> 3:49:10.960]  whatever way is gonna seem more favorable
[3:49:10.960 --> 3:49:13.600]  you know for them because they don't want to admit that they came in and did
[3:49:13.600 --> 3:49:16.240]  exactly what they did
[3:49:16.240 --> 3:49:19.840]  well you've also heard from a lot of police who go to church in our community
[3:49:19.840 --> 3:49:22.080]  go to the grocery store in our community they live with us
[3:49:22.080 --> 3:49:25.600]  we're with their fellow americans we're fellow americans
[3:49:25.600 --> 3:49:28.560]  i've heard from a lot of police nationwide and locally you've heard from a
[3:49:28.560 --> 3:49:32.000]  lot you told me off air who were really upset about this
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:35.600]  very upset and i've gotten a huge huge uh
[3:49:35.600 --> 3:49:40.880]  you know supportive response from not just police i mean you know from
[3:49:40.880 --> 3:49:45.120]  firefighters from uh from you know even a couple
[3:49:45.120 --> 3:49:48.960]  atf agents themselves that you know said they were with atl but didn't want to
[3:49:48.960 --> 3:49:51.600]  mention their name or anything i mean they even called up
[3:49:51.600 --> 3:49:55.520]  you know from out of state and everybody was real supportive and you know
[3:49:55.520 --> 3:49:58.800]  and like i said before i totally respect the profession
[3:49:58.800 --> 3:50:02.400]  and you know it's a tough one it's a hard one but you know when you have a few
[3:50:02.400 --> 3:50:06.320]  bad uh seats and they kind of overshadows everybody
[3:50:06.320 --> 3:50:09.280]  else and and as far as the department goes
[3:50:09.280 --> 3:50:12.400]  it's those i mean i totally i'm totally supportive of
[3:50:12.400 --> 3:50:16.800]  apd as a department but you know when you have a few people out there pursuing
[3:50:16.800 --> 3:50:19.920]  their own agenda you know basically because they
[3:50:19.920 --> 3:50:22.880]  don't like guns they don't want to have gun shows and they're in a position
[3:50:22.880 --> 3:50:26.960]  where they can make it happen it's not right well it's very simple when the
[3:50:26.960 --> 3:50:30.640]  police and the government become rogue
[3:50:30.640 --> 3:50:34.080]  they become north korea or mexico or communist russia
[3:50:34.080 --> 3:50:38.400]  and we have to keep government confined to its constitutional parameters
[3:50:38.400 --> 3:50:41.440]  let's come back with a few final important questions i've got
[3:50:41.440 --> 3:50:44.720]  for darwin bettiger straight ahead it's send a message
[3:50:44.720 --> 3:50:48.560]  to obama to the globalist to the gun grammars that you won't let them
[3:50:48.560 --> 3:50:51.440]  illegally in the dark of night shut down a gun show
[3:50:51.440 --> 3:50:57.040]  show up this saturday and sunday in south austin money talks and it sounds

[3:52:14.880 --> 3:52:19.120]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay

[3:52:35.440 --> 3:52:38.240]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[3:52:38.240 --> 3:52:41.760]  and right now in washington dc we have seen
