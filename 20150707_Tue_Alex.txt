[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:38.800]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:38.800 --> 00:43.160]  lord christopher mongton will be joining us in the second hour to give us a
[00:43.160 --> 00:48.480]  detailed breakdown on the EU contagion that is threatening the world
[00:48.480 --> 00:54.800]  economy and this is a EU problem not a grecian problem very important
[00:54.800 --> 01:00.880]  information there is a massive disinformation campaign that is now
[01:00.880 --> 01:09.680]  heating back up concerning jade helm that is going to kick off here in just a
[01:09.680 --> 01:19.960]  few days jade helm 15 and the media from the washington post to television is
[01:19.960 --> 01:25.480]  implying and saying that we're saying this is an imminent martial law takeover
[01:25.480 --> 01:30.280]  and editing clips of us together to make it sound like that's what we've said what
[01:30.280 --> 01:36.040]  we've said is there is a large slow motion federalization globalization
[01:36.040 --> 01:40.640]  takeover of society so we're gonna be looking at that here's the washington
[01:40.640 --> 01:45.880]  post going with the same headline the austin american statesman used the
[01:45.880 --> 01:53.120]  americans are coming some in a texas county fear and obama led u.s. military
[01:53.120 --> 02:02.200]  invasion and the washington post is going on to say that it's racist there's
[02:02.200 --> 02:07.360]  another article breaking this down because obama's black that's why people
[02:07.360 --> 02:11.960]  don't like jade helm no we see the military in stars and stripes and in
[02:11.960 --> 02:17.160]  army times admitting that they're training to take on the tea party and
[02:17.160 --> 02:22.400]  gun owners during a civil war in this country and we have all the army
[02:22.400 --> 02:32.120]  documents admitting preparations for civil unrest and for rounding people up
[02:32.120 --> 02:37.560]  that's why folks are concerned with the government lying and the government
[02:37.560 --> 02:41.720]  being illegitimate the government being rogue and just the president operating
[02:41.720 --> 02:47.760]  as a dictator on so many fronts that's why texas wants his billion dollars a
[02:47.760 --> 02:52.360]  gold back from the private fellow reserve that's why texas has had to put
[02:52.360 --> 02:57.960]  thousands of state police on the border because the feds just erased it our
[02:57.960 --> 03:03.960]  government's openly funding al qaeda and isis and obama has now come out we have
[03:03.960 --> 03:10.920]  video of this coming up the next segment and he says we will not defeat isis
[03:10.920 --> 03:21.160]  with guns but with better ideas really so you're gonna go talk to him and then
[03:21.160 --> 03:29.040]  they're just going to stop what they're doing no you mr. president represent the
[03:29.040 --> 03:38.200]  cartel that basically laid the isis egg and then sat on it and then now you've
[03:38.200 --> 03:44.560]  been busy the mama bird vomiting weapons and taxpayer money into their mouths
[03:44.560 --> 03:51.880]  Obama is the father of isis the United States as a contingent of NATO has been
[03:51.880 --> 03:56.120]  on record the number one funder of the Free Syrian Army with John McCain over
[03:56.120 --> 04:01.120]  there hanging out with the isis leaders back when they were under different
[04:01.120 --> 04:06.600]  names of Al Nuzra and the rest of it it's all Wahhabist but the average
[04:06.600 --> 04:11.520]  American doesn't know what the fourth of July is doesn't know why we celebrate
[04:11.520 --> 04:17.720]  it there's a new poll out national poll 19% know what the First Amendment is so
[04:17.720 --> 04:25.880]  of course they can fund the terrorist publicly and get away with it because
[04:25.880 --> 04:31.520]  I've seen TV newscast where Australian TV goes out in the US and holds up a sign
[04:31.520 --> 04:36.040]  of Australian says there's al qaeda stand should we nuke it and they're like
[04:36.040 --> 04:40.360]  yes let's attack they go to the next 10 people and they all want to blow up
[04:40.360 --> 04:47.560]  Australia the public basically are lobotomized gerbils and that's why we're
[04:47.560 --> 04:52.600]  in so much trouble our government runs the terrorist organizations the
[04:52.600 --> 04:59.760]  narcotics the snuff films and everything evil we'll be back when speaking
[04:59.760 --> 05:05.000]  about isis president Obama recently said this ideologies are not defeated with
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.920]  guns they're defeated by better ideas the president was meeting with military
[05:09.920 --> 05:13.800]  leaders at the Pentagon when he made the comments perhaps Obama should have
[05:13.800 --> 05:17.560]  considered this notion before continuing the policy of flooding the
[05:17.560 --> 05:23.280]  chaotic Middle East with weapons as info wars has tirelessly documented US
[05:23.280 --> 05:28.160]  weapons have fallen into isis hands time and time again and bolstered the terror
[05:28.160 --> 05:32.600]  group via the insane policy of arming and training the so-called moderate
[05:32.600 --> 05:38.320]  rebels in Libya Syria and Iraq the CIA has shipped weapons to al qaeda
[05:38.320 --> 05:43.320]  affiliated groups in Syria since at least 2012 a fact reported by the New
[05:43.320 --> 05:48.320]  York Times Iraqi intelligence even claims that the US is intentionally
[05:48.320 --> 05:52.920]  dropping weapons to known Isis linked groups of rebels where were the better

[08:15.240 --> 08:17.480]  happen
[08:17.480 --> 08:29.600]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[08:34.760 --> 08:44.640]  it's already seven seven Tuesday the seventh day of July 2015 it's hard to
[08:44.640 --> 08:50.400]  believe it's the 10th anniversary since the London false flag bombings I traveled
[08:50.400 --> 08:54.200]  a few days after the bombings to London England and of course made the film
[08:54.200 --> 09:00.120]  terror storm a history of government-sponsored terrorism and in that
[09:00.120 --> 09:05.600]  case they had a drill with the Metropolitan Police and Scotland yard of
[09:05.600 --> 09:12.880]  the exact same trains and bus being bombed at the exact same time and exact
[09:12.880 --> 09:19.600]  same location Peter Powers the former head of public relations in Scotland
[09:19.600 --> 09:26.360]  yard was running the drill and admitted on BBC and IT in that day that they were
[09:26.360 --> 09:29.960]  running a drill of the exact same thing and then he thought it was fantastical
[09:29.960 --> 09:34.760]  I'm not saying they were involved in the attack they were hired to create a
[09:34.760 --> 09:39.040]  smoke screen with the drill in case any operatives got caught but it is
[09:39.040 --> 09:44.840]  impossible and even mainstream news had to admit it was basically one out of
[09:44.840 --> 09:50.040]  what 23 treachery Gillian insurance actuary was done that that could have
[09:50.040 --> 09:54.920]  happened in fact we should probably try to get Paul Watson I didn't think of
[09:54.920 --> 10:00.240]  this we probably try to get Paul Watson who covered it on for maybe the last 20
[10:00.240 --> 10:04.800]  minutes of the show Lord of the second hour because Lord Moncton is coming on
[10:04.800 --> 10:10.960]  to break down the whole EU contagion the meltdown the grief situation and where
[10:10.960 --> 10:15.120]  all of that is going could this be the death of the EU that we're beginning to
[10:15.120 --> 10:20.440]  see Paul Watson would be perfect to be on the last 20 minutes of that hour to go
[10:20.440 --> 10:26.480]  over and to repost some of the articles that he and I wrote that were the top
[10:26.480 --> 10:31.840]  stories at the time concerning 7-7 I mean they got millions of readers and we
[10:31.840 --> 10:37.920]  would just post the video of them admitting that the exact same trains
[10:37.920 --> 10:43.960]  and bus at the exact same time and exact same location in the drill is where the
[10:43.960 --> 10:49.080]  terrorists struck the so-called terrorists were set up they thought
[10:49.080 --> 10:54.160]  they were part of another drill and it turned out MI6 was managing them through
[10:54.160 --> 11:00.280]  a character named a SWAT who was the leader of al Qaeda in England and who
[11:00.280 --> 11:05.480]  was allowed to then travel in and out of the country unmolested even Fox News had
[11:05.480 --> 11:11.920]  to report that indeed he was MI6 and John Loftus former top-level anti-terrorism
[11:11.920 --> 11:17.520]  head at the Justice Department came on this show and talked about it and I'm
[11:17.520 --> 11:23.120]  only scratching the surface there we've got all this other news it's just
[11:23.120 --> 11:29.520]  important to remember that a lot of this terror gets staged 7-7 was completely
[11:29.520 --> 11:34.640]  staged now shifting years out of that there's three different types of stage
[11:34.640 --> 11:44.960]  terror purely staged provocateur patsy staged and wind-up toy and ISIS is the
[11:44.960 --> 11:50.400]  mother of wind-up toys you don't control a wind-up toy you'll wind it up you
[11:50.400 --> 11:55.400]  turn it loose and it goes around in circles running into things a wind-up
[11:55.400 --> 11:59.600]  toy is black widows take a hundred black widows you know my allegory dump it in
[11:59.600 --> 12:05.320]  your neighbor's bed because you don't like them and you didn't physically bite
[12:05.320 --> 12:09.720]  your neighbor or kill them but the black widows will give it their best shot
[12:09.720 --> 12:14.280]  that's a wind-up toy but no two or three rattlesnakes in somebody's bed or
[12:14.280 --> 12:26.760]  cobras that's a wind-up toy 7-7 was not a wind-up toy it was staged ISIS is a
[12:26.760 --> 12:32.560]  wind-up toy multi hundred thousand man operation allowed to recruit on Facebook
[12:32.560 --> 12:36.000]  and Twitter allowed to recruit and fly in and out of the United States Canada
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.880]  England Germany all over Europe France and now they've got cells and copycat
[12:41.880 --> 12:47.800]  cells fellow travelers a lone wolf fellow travelers that are in all 48
[12:47.800 --> 12:54.760]  contiguous states they are in every European country and whenever I guess
[12:54.760 --> 12:59.440]  ISIS feels like it whenever the time is right signals will be sent through
[12:59.440 --> 13:04.000]  Western handlers to the double and triple agent commanders who will then
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.600]  activate the operations and that's why when they came out three weeks ago and
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.520]  said start attacking Western targets I said it's gonna be real you're gonna see
[13:12.520 --> 13:16.520]  attacks they'll be badly coordinated low-intensity because they're not staged
[13:16.520 --> 13:25.360]  they happen I'm an expert on this folks I spend hours every few days studying it
[13:25.360 --> 13:29.040]  talking to all the top experts
[13:32.520 --> 13:37.640]  the ISIS situation is a real threat and I'm not even talking about the few dozen
[13:37.640 --> 13:40.840]  or a few hundred people they're gonna kill I'm sad for those folks to get killed
[13:40.840 --> 13:48.360]  we're trying to stop it but the big issue is how they're going to use it to
[13:48.360 --> 13:53.960]  take our liberties the government and the government-controlled media thinks
[13:53.960 --> 13:59.640]  you're so stupid and I'm so stupid that they're going to basically let Al Qaeda
[13:59.640 --> 14:04.920]  slash ISIS attack us and then no one is going to point out I guess hey our
[14:04.920 --> 14:10.600]  government funded them our government created them Rand Paul and we should
[14:10.600 --> 14:14.240]  play some of these clips I'm giving the guy a short notice we try to find Rand
[14:14.240 --> 14:19.920]  Paul and Ted Cruz saying we shouldn't be Al Qaeda's Air Force Hillary said we
[14:19.920 --> 14:23.280]  helped create them I mean it's all true but that's our covering her but when she
[14:23.280 --> 14:26.840]  admits it when she's heavily involved in Benghazi and the head of the State
[14:26.840 --> 14:30.840]  Department when they launched this program five years ago to arm these
[14:30.840 --> 14:38.520]  groups and turn them loose on Syria Egypt Iraq Libya she now wants to cover
[14:38.520 --> 14:45.040]  her but and say oh it's terrible we made a mistake Al Qaeda's back worse than
[14:45.040 --> 14:52.000]  ever now called ISIS when she is right in the middle of doing it so now they
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.080]  know the attacks are coming so they start demonizing the guy that exposed
[14:56.080 --> 15:01.800]  them at the greatest level and that's Rand Paul and they're saying when the
[15:01.800 --> 15:08.080]  attack comes Chris Christie and others it's Rand Paul's fault because Rand Paul
[15:08.080 --> 15:12.880]  is the only one other than Ted Cruz but Rand Paul keeps doing it Rand Paul keeps
[15:12.880 --> 15:17.760]  beating the drum Ted Cruz is shut up and clearly got word to shut his mouth
[15:17.760 --> 15:24.240]  Rand Paul is traveling the whole US giving speeches going on radio and TV and
[15:24.240 --> 15:29.560]  pointing out that we created the Free Syrian Army the John McCain went over
[15:29.560 --> 15:33.920]  there and helped set him up with Hillary support and that they're gonna hit us
[15:33.920 --> 15:38.640]  and so now they are politically assassinating him trying to and saying
[15:38.640 --> 15:45.200]  when terror attacks come it's his fault for four years ago trying to stop the
[15:45.200 --> 15:51.360]  funding of these people he actually is a hero so in inverted reality it's his
[15:51.360 --> 15:59.360]  fault and in this upside-down planet we now have Obama coming out saying that
[15:59.360 --> 16:08.720]  ISIS will not be defeated with guns but with better ideas when Obama and the
[16:08.720 --> 16:12.960]  EU run offense and defense for the radical Islamists bringing him into
[16:12.960 --> 16:17.280]  Europe bringing him into the United States protecting them giving the Free
[16:17.280 --> 16:21.880]  Syrian Army over seven million dollars the last four and a half years that we
[16:21.880 --> 16:26.400]  know of Hillary at the State Department allowing the weapons to be transferred
[16:26.400 --> 16:31.440]  it goes on and on and on and then airlifts giving them weapons I've had
[16:31.440 --> 16:37.600]  Tosh Plumlee current CIA pilot on looking up he's in the congressional record you
[16:37.600 --> 16:43.040]  go how does he still have a job at the CIA when he blew the whistle on government
[16:43.040 --> 16:47.040]  drug dealing in the 70s and the 80s and is one of the biggest Iran Contra
[16:47.040 --> 16:51.160]  witnesses because the whole government's not bad there's a white side in the dark
[16:51.160 --> 16:56.160]  side and Plumlee has won all his court cases and so they can't uninstate him as
[16:56.160 --> 17:02.760]  a contract pilot you have the Justice Department is threatening yeah they
[17:02.760 --> 17:07.440]  started following me around once I had him on he's coming on soon I mean they're
[17:07.440 --> 17:11.960]  really mad at us but do they really want to arrest us for exposing that we have
[17:11.960 --> 17:15.920]  NATO sources he does I don't want to have them it's too dangerous and Pentagon
[17:15.920 --> 17:20.640]  sources that have been there when the C-130s deliver high-impact kinetic
[17:20.640 --> 17:24.920]  weapons missiles equivalent of tow missiles you name an anti-tank and any
[17:24.920 --> 17:30.720]  helicopter and anti-aircraft missiles directly to guys with al-Qaeda flags and
[17:30.720 --> 17:36.240]  our special forces flipped out starting four years ago when these guys would
[17:36.240 --> 17:39.440]  laugh at them and say we're gonna kill you next as they were delivering them
[17:39.440 --> 17:43.640]  chest of missiles and let me tell you they're gonna start shooting down Western
[17:43.640 --> 17:47.600]  aircraft the media will never point out our government gave it to them and the
[17:47.600 --> 17:52.160]  word is they went on the market and bought Russian and Chinese armor piercing
[17:52.160 --> 17:57.120]  knockoff tow missiles I forget the name I think it's red arrow yeah look up red
[17:57.120 --> 18:02.360]  arrow check my facts my memory and also Chinese and Russian anti-aircraft
[18:02.360 --> 18:06.960]  handheld missiles so there's gonna be a whole set up there too and I'm just
[18:06.960 --> 18:13.320]  giving you this has got the CIA the NSA the Pentagon with red smoke coming out
[18:13.320 --> 18:16.560]  of their ears I have a responsibility to tell you the truth no matter how
[18:16.560 --> 18:21.800]  dangerous it is you understand this radio shows on a game okay now let's go
[18:21.800 --> 18:27.120]  ahead and let's go to this club of Obama that we just need to have better
[18:27.120 --> 18:32.680]  ideas what Caitlyn Jenner maybe tell al-Qaeda how to wear a dress it will
[18:32.680 --> 18:37.920]  that idea trump them or how about some Obama care how about some two plus two
[18:37.920 --> 18:42.840]  equals five maybe that ideal will defeat them against Western weapons most of them
[18:42.840 --> 18:53.280]  Colt m16s us 308 rifles 556 most of its us made deliver oh they accidentally got

[19:31.200 --> 19:35.360]  leaders agree this broader challenge of countering bound extremism is not
[19:35.360 --> 19:41.040]  simply a military effort oh yeah ideologies are not defeated with guns

[24:14.120 --> 24:17.600]  need to train the military to operate domestically that's to take on the Tea
[24:17.600 --> 24:23.280]  Party for an imminent civil war they say is coming out of the blue sky and our
[24:23.280 --> 24:32.200]  president says we can't fight ISIL the Islamic State with guns we have to fight
[24:32.200 --> 24:39.240]  it with ideas when our so-called allies of Turkey and Saudi Arabia and Qatar are
[24:39.240 --> 24:46.960]  publicly funding these proxy armies to take out all of their enemies and run
[24:46.960 --> 24:50.800]  around chopping off every Christian head they find and blowing up every non
[24:50.800 --> 25:00.640]  radical mosque and every Shiite mosque they fund this is a Wahhabist Sunni
[25:00.640 --> 25:06.440]  Islamic takeover of the Middle East and hey if the Muslims the Shiites and the
[25:06.440 --> 25:11.200]  Sunnis want to kill each other I don't have a dog in that fight but my
[25:11.200 --> 25:16.060]  government shouldn't be arming the Sunnis to go do it especially when the
[25:16.060 --> 25:27.440]  Shiite non radicals in areas of the Middle East like Syria let women go to
[25:27.440 --> 25:30.920]  college they're not attacking the United States they're not sexually
[25:30.920 --> 25:33.880]  mutilating women they're not chopping Christians heads off they're not
[25:33.880 --> 25:40.000]  stoning Jews to death where are the feminists we're the liberals because
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.840]  they're not feminist or liberals it's all just a thing to beat people over the
[25:42.840 --> 25:47.920]  head politically here to accept turning our guns in and Obama screw job care and
[25:47.920 --> 25:53.040]  open borders and globalism when the rubber meets the road our government as
[25:53.040 --> 26:00.480]  a litmus test is arming Islamic State the new free Syrian army to range around
[26:00.480 --> 26:07.160]  and create failed states all over the Middle East Egypt the government
[26:07.160 --> 26:12.160]  defeated the West attempted total takeover but for the year that the
[26:12.160 --> 26:19.800]  Western allies the Muslim Brotherhood the Sunnis were in control there was a
[26:19.800 --> 26:24.800]  rain of murder and terror and rioting and throwing gays off buildings and
[26:24.800 --> 26:29.800]  chopping Christians heads off and crucifying them upside down just anybody
[26:29.800 --> 26:36.360]  who was it a Sunni and by the way Syrian girl that comes on is Sunni and she's
[26:36.360 --> 26:39.560]  against this most Sunnis aren't like this I mean it I have studied the
[26:39.560 --> 26:45.920]  demographics Sunnis are 79% of Islam and the vast majority of them are not blood
[26:45.920 --> 26:52.120]  thirsty psychopathic killers they're killing non radical Sunnis because Saudi
[26:52.120 --> 26:58.240]  Arabia is the homeland of radical Islam and it's allied with our criminal
[26:58.240 --> 27:02.720]  rogue government it ran the attacks of 9-11 working with criminals in our
[27:02.720 --> 27:08.600]  government to take American freedom and attack their arch enemy at the time Iraq
[27:08.600 --> 27:13.520]  who was blamed when Saddam gave speeches saying I'm our tenemies with al-qaeda
[27:13.520 --> 27:19.440]  they're always trying to kill me they work for Saudi Arabia I've been set up I
[27:19.440 --> 27:23.640]  worked with your government I was trained in Egypt by the CIA I was told to
[27:23.640 --> 27:29.800]  attack Iran I have been set up Saddam gave all those speeches they were true
[27:29.800 --> 27:34.880]  does it mean Saddam was an angel cake does it mean hazy mubarak was an angel
[27:34.880 --> 27:42.760]  no but they were Western dictators who did not persecute at one one hundredth
[27:42.760 --> 27:49.280]  that al-qaeda does but they had made for TV movies and HBO movies and all about
[27:49.280 --> 27:53.640]  how bad Saddam was Saddam could go stand in the crowd of 20,000 people with
[27:53.640 --> 27:58.480]  AK-47s and no one was shooting under Saddam Hussein they had total Second
[27:58.480 --> 28:08.800]  Amendment rights now Iraq's being broken in three parts and our president has the
[28:08.800 --> 28:14.320]  nerve to come out and say we need to beat al-qaeda because that's what ISIS is
[28:14.320 --> 28:19.800]  and ISIL with ideas when he knows full well they're funding him and it's a
[28:19.800 --> 28:24.000]  proxy army the whole Pentagon knows the whole military knows and the good news
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  is they've spoken out against it you've had you've seen hearings but they've
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.240]  successfully contained all that now and shut down the debate about we have to
[28:32.240 --> 28:36.440]  force that debate back out in the open they just changed the name to confuse the
[28:36.440 --> 28:40.240]  public here is the traitor in chief and that means that we're gonna have to
[28:40.240 --> 28:46.200]  pick up our game to prevent these attacks means take your freedom it's also
[28:46.200 --> 28:51.000]  true why ultimately in order for us to defeat terrorist groups like ISIL and
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.720]  al-qaeda is gonna also require us to discredit their ideology the twisted
[28:57.720 --> 29:02.880]  thinking that draws vulnerable people into their ranks so I've said before and
[29:02.880 --> 29:06.440]  I know our military leaders agree this broader challenge of countering bound
[29:06.440 --> 29:13.200]  extremism is not simply a military effort ideologies are not defeated with
[29:13.200 --> 29:17.200]  guns they're defeated by better ideas horse crap more attractive and more
[29:17.200 --> 29:21.560]  compelling vision so the United States will continue to do our part by working
[29:21.560 --> 29:27.640]  with partners to counter ISIL's hateful propaganda especially online will
[29:27.640 --> 29:31.120]  constantly reaffirm through words and deeds there you go never be they're
[29:31.120 --> 29:34.840]  gonna restrict everybody's free speech and past cybersecurity laws on the back
[29:34.840 --> 29:38.200]  of this and take freedoms domestically to fight the proxy armies they've
[29:38.200 --> 29:42.760]  released we're gonna come back and get into all the other news on Greece the

[33:32.240 --> 33:36.080]  joining us I want to just read the different stacks of headlines before I
[33:36.080 --> 33:44.040]  launch into the next areas sections of news this is so important that I'm gonna
[33:44.040 --> 33:49.520]  spend a large portion of the third hour on it because again it illustrates the
[33:49.520 --> 33:57.680]  inversion of reality not just the story itself there are 700 plus million
[33:57.680 --> 34:06.200]  people south of the US border if you've ever been to Central or South America
[34:06.200 --> 34:11.880]  it's super beautiful has a lot of interesting things the people come off
[34:11.880 --> 34:17.240]  is very funny very nice very creative very smart but they never got out from
[34:17.240 --> 34:21.800]  under colonialism and there are stabbings shootings I mean it's as
[34:21.800 --> 34:27.280]  dangerous as Chicago all over Central and South America it's Wild Wild West
[34:27.280 --> 34:33.000]  it's dangerous and their prisons are hellish and when people run from the law
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.880]  in Latin America but now it's China Russia you name it they come to the
[34:38.880 --> 34:45.680]  United States because you can get fake IDs and blend in and be left alone if
[34:45.680 --> 34:51.320]  you're a citizen though and you do something wrong or you use a fake ID
[34:51.320 --> 34:54.800]  you hear about embusting people that have been using a fake social security
[34:54.800 --> 34:58.960]  number for 20 years not to steal an identity of somebody that's dead not to
[34:58.960 --> 35:06.440]  not to steal money but just to change your identity because you're a convicted
[35:06.440 --> 35:09.800]  criminal or something you hear about people getting rated all the time but
[35:09.800 --> 35:15.560]  if you're any legal that's committed rapes murders arson you name it you
[35:15.560 --> 35:19.680]  come here and you're above the law and then Trump talks about that and they
[35:19.680 --> 35:26.120]  are trying to crucify him and again whether you like Trump or don't like
[35:26.120 --> 35:30.840]  Trump if they can crucify someone telling the truth they crucify the truth
[35:30.840 --> 35:38.200]  and now there's a video of the arrogant San Francisco sheriff who released the
[35:38.200 --> 35:43.200]  seven-time felon he'd been deported five times he was about to be deported ice
[35:43.200 --> 35:49.320]  wantoning and they just released this guy and he went shot a woman for no
[35:49.320 --> 35:54.120]  reason in front of witnesses first and not he did it now says oh he just picked
[35:54.120 --> 35:58.520]  the gun up and it's shot her by accident and then he well first he said he was
[35:58.520 --> 36:02.120]  shooting sea lions then it was he didn't remember then it was it was an
[36:02.120 --> 36:07.440]  accident and then he was just pointing at her and then now he wasn't pointing at
[36:07.440 --> 36:12.920]  her it was in a bag and then next and this guy's the worst liar the bill
[36:12.920 --> 36:23.520]  Clinton and the issue is I've been hit twice by illegal drunk once at a fast
[36:23.520 --> 36:27.560]  food restaurant drive-through it wasn't that bad but they hit me on about eight
[36:27.560 --> 36:31.920]  miles an hour and crunched in some stuff had no license had no info cop said
[36:31.920 --> 36:37.240]  nothing I can do another time same thing got back ended going down at 35
[36:37.240 --> 36:41.000]  probably only going 20 miles an hour stop and go traffic I've back ended
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.720]  somebody before differences I got the ticket my insurance had to pay cops
[36:46.720 --> 36:53.480]  come God just goes no speaking English you're gone everybody you know has
[36:53.480 --> 36:58.040]  experienced this or knows somebody that has the drunk driving the hit and running
[36:58.040 --> 37:03.320]  the raping the stealing the killing does that say that people in Latin America
[37:03.320 --> 37:08.840]  are inherently bad people know but Latin America has collapsed into a crime
[37:08.840 --> 37:13.560]  wave there's a hundred and ten thousand dead Mexicans in the last eight years
[37:13.560 --> 37:20.560]  that we know of when college kids protest the corrupt government they go
[37:20.560 --> 37:29.880]  and kidnap 20-something of them and kill them that's the government there's a
[37:29.880 --> 37:35.320]  report out from MRC TV border report backs up Trump's rapist claim well of
[37:35.320 --> 37:41.200]  course it does and that ties in I'll cover it the third hour in great detail
[37:41.200 --> 37:46.920]  the knockout game I've seen four different knockout games since Sunday
[37:46.920 --> 37:51.040]  two of my sent to you guys ever too I need to dig up and give you new videos
[37:51.040 --> 37:56.240]  from rock star hip-hop and all the other sites that celebrate this stuff where
[37:56.240 --> 38:01.600]  you got an old white guy or an old white woman a lot of times it's even a
[38:01.600 --> 38:07.440]  homeless person and a black teenager walks over and punches them in the head
[38:07.440 --> 38:11.080]  and sometimes they fall over and hit their head and die and it's clearly
[38:11.080 --> 38:15.800]  racial the sites say it's racial hi look at that old cracker-ass hit the ground
[38:15.800 --> 38:21.600]  you know great job and when the Klan does something like that that's the exact
[38:21.600 --> 38:25.920]  kind of stuff the Klan used to pull and still does sometimes is you go find some
[38:25.920 --> 38:33.240]  old homeless black guy and you kill him same MO I can pull up the stories but
[38:33.240 --> 38:37.440]  see when they do it it's a big deal but when black people do it it's not a big
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.440]  deal just like when Hispanics go around committing crimes mailing against
[38:41.440 --> 38:46.560]  Hispanics doesn't tend to be racial except against blacks Hispanics commit
[38:46.560 --> 38:52.240]  on average at the crime statistics in Austin and in LA and in Dallas and in
[38:52.240 --> 38:56.400]  Houston and in San Francisco against blacks they have a derogatory term for
[38:56.400 --> 39:00.880]  them the point is I've studied the anthropology the sociology I know what's
[39:00.880 --> 39:09.040]  going on here and the media doesn't want to admit that this stuff is going on
[39:09.040 --> 39:15.960]  and is intensifying because MSNBC and the White House are charging up racial
[39:15.960 --> 39:24.960]  tensions and charging up social tensions with class warfare and making double
[39:24.960 --> 39:30.160]  black unemployment what it was six years ago and all the social problems be
[39:30.160 --> 39:36.200]  blamed on white people and most the white people being attacked are poor they
[39:36.200 --> 39:46.360]  have done nothing to anybody and in Los Angeles especially every day or two a
[39:46.360 --> 39:53.600]  black person gets shot by Hispanic gangs and the response the spanish gangs are
[39:53.600 --> 39:56.960]  we're tired of getting shot me an attack we're gonna kill everybody the point is
[39:56.960 --> 40:03.280]  is that the world from Africa to Latin America to areas of Eastern Europe to
[40:03.280 --> 40:09.120]  many areas of Asia is completely unraveling I mean you go to any country
[40:09.120 --> 40:16.600]  out there and there are gangs of people going around killing each other you look
[40:16.600 --> 40:20.120]  at Indonesia there it's the exact same people they all look the same same
[40:20.120 --> 40:23.600]  genetics but they'll all kill each other over who lives on this side of the
[40:23.600 --> 40:28.920]  street or that side of the street or in Africa it'll be animus or Muslims killing
[40:28.920 --> 40:33.760]  Christians or Christians though we gotta be honest statistically they don't do a
[40:33.760 --> 40:39.000]  lot of it killing those groups it's black people you live on that side of the
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  river you you live on that side we're gonna kill each other it's like the
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.080]  Star Trek episode where one guy's got black on his left side of the face and
[40:46.080 --> 40:49.640]  the other guys got black on the right side of his face and one's the upper
[40:49.640 --> 40:53.240]  class and one's the lower class and they're killing each other this is divide
[40:53.240 --> 40:59.800]  and conquer and I know you know that but it's just amazing illegal immigrant
[40:59.800 --> 41:06.520]  deported six times charged at felony hit and run a family that injured young
[41:06.520 --> 41:12.400]  children that's just I mean I see this every few hours San Francisco sheriff
[41:12.400 --> 41:19.800]  pure 14 murder could happen in a US city he calls Trump an opportunist see
[41:19.800 --> 41:24.360]  it's no big deal this woman's dead you know what it's a good thing the sheriff's
[41:24.360 --> 41:27.840]  department they're defending themselves yes we don't we're a sanctuary city and
[41:27.840 --> 41:31.800]  if we have an aggravated felon who ice wants to deport who isn't a citizen
[41:31.800 --> 41:36.840]  we're gonna let him stay here see we can't even deport aggravated felons that
[41:36.840 --> 41:44.160]  are illegal the Travis County Sheriff is black and a Democrat he deport's on
[41:44.160 --> 41:50.640]  average five illegal aliens that are felons a week he gives them to the feds
[41:50.640 --> 41:54.840]  most the time beds won't pick them up and the Democratic Party is running
[41:54.840 --> 42:01.600]  people against him and trying to remove him saying he's a racist you're like why
[42:01.600 --> 42:08.240]  because the precedent has to be set under globalism to have no border and to
[42:08.240 --> 42:13.560]  have it where they can selectively keep anybody they want inside the country and
[42:13.560 --> 42:17.880]  if you give in to the common sense hey we should deport illegals that are
[42:17.880 --> 42:27.040]  rapist and killers and arsonist and robbers why then you have to admit that
[42:27.040 --> 42:32.400]  there's an illegal alien crime wave I mean in the 80s they admitted there was a
[42:32.400 --> 42:37.080]  Cuban crime wave not that Cubans were all criminals or predisposed to be
[42:37.080 --> 42:42.000]  criminals but because Fidel Castro dumped 300 plus thousand people
[42:42.000 --> 42:47.960]  conservatively out of his prisons and put them on boats and said go to El
[42:47.960 --> 42:57.960]  Norte in Florida that was a crime wave and they came into the Cuban communities
[42:57.960 --> 43:03.600]  that were there and took them over that's not deniable it's not racist to
[43:03.600 --> 43:12.760]  say the truth Mexico is in a collapse crime wave Venezuela is in a socialist
[43:12.760 --> 43:21.600]  crime wave collapse the Soviet Union was under a horrible dictatorial permanent
[43:21.600 --> 43:26.320]  collapse system those are white people it's not racist against slobs to say
[43:26.320 --> 43:35.480]  they were under a tyranny and I know you know that it's not racist against Asians
[43:35.480 --> 43:40.080]  to say we shouldn't pay for Chinese women by the thousands a week to travel
[43:40.080 --> 43:44.040]  to the United States to openly declare they're here to have their babies and
[43:44.040 --> 43:50.520]  have it all paid for this is suicide of this country we're totally bankrupt so
[43:50.520 --> 43:56.240]  I'm gonna take this stack I'm gonna put it over here I'm gonna spend a lot of the
[43:56.240 --> 44:02.800]  third hour on it I didn't watch the nightly news one night last week I
[44:02.800 --> 44:09.280]  tend to watch it in the morning on my iPad while I get on the elliptical that
[44:09.280 --> 44:14.080]  I've got you know televisions in there that I monitor as well in the gym in the
[44:14.080 --> 44:21.200]  public gym I go to and I heard them back there talking yesterday afternoon about
[44:21.200 --> 44:26.520]  a show they did last week and I knew that we've sent our East Coast reporter Dan
[44:26.520 --> 44:30.560]  Badandi up there to cover it and I heard dude talking about his uncle who I know
[44:30.560 --> 44:35.480]  was a Navy SEAL and then a decorated FBI agent who retired a few years ago and
[44:35.480 --> 44:39.720]  it's part of a big security firm and I heard dude talking and I was like are
[44:39.720 --> 44:42.840]  you kidding me
[44:42.840 --> 44:53.320]  his uncle talking to other FBI people who I guess are still in was told you
[44:53.320 --> 44:59.400]  ought to go check out Sandy Hook we're not allowed to it doesn't add up and his
[44:59.400 --> 45:05.360]  uncle went to the hearings and I didn't even realize we have video of him at the
[45:05.360 --> 45:09.480]  hearings and Badandi interviewing him and what he said on air and what he said
[45:09.480 --> 45:14.040]  off air and he told you yeah you can repeat what I said he's been in the
[45:14.040 --> 45:19.320]  John Gotti trial he's a well-known FBI agent he's been a whole bunch of stuff a
[45:19.320 --> 45:30.040]  bunch of big cases and he told dude I have never seen people acting so weird and
[45:30.040 --> 45:36.080]  so suspicious and saying no one knows anything and no paperwork on anything
[45:36.080 --> 45:44.360]  he's a former Navy SEAL retired FBI agent and I'm and I know what'll happen
[45:44.360 --> 45:47.800]  these guys are compartmentalized are like mr. America most of them they
[45:47.800 --> 45:51.080]  really think they're the good guys and overall they are good guys but they're
[45:51.080 --> 45:56.360]  compartmentalized right next to him is the devil and above them people like
[45:56.360 --> 46:03.240]  Eric Holder as bad as it gets they'll go investigate something find out it's
[46:03.240 --> 46:06.880]  true and then be shut down and I would imagine after we talk about this he's
[46:06.880 --> 46:11.320]  going to he's going to get a visit because he's now investigating Sandy
[46:11.320 --> 46:20.000]  Hook Rob do's uncle he's down investigating Sandy Hook former FBI
[46:20.000 --> 46:25.960]  agent retired that's got a really freak him out and I'm not gonna put words in
[46:25.960 --> 46:30.400]  his mouth but he said he's never seen something that looks this fake it's
[46:30.400 --> 46:33.760]  because it is folks I don't know they really killed kids I don't know but
[46:33.760 --> 46:37.800]  they we got emails and memos that school was shut down a year before they tore it
[46:37.800 --> 46:41.640]  down they covered it up note rescue helicopters no ambulances within an
[46:41.640 --> 46:47.320]  hour and a half they had a sign saying check in here it was a media event if
[46:47.320 --> 46:51.280]  they did kill kids they knew it was coming stocked the school with kids
[46:51.280 --> 46:54.240]  killed him and then had the media there and that probably didn't even happen I
[46:54.240 --> 46:58.160]  mean no wonder we get so many death threats and so much heat and so much
[46:58.160 --> 47:01.040]  other stuff I'm not gonna get into behind the scenes when we touch Sandy Hook
[47:01.040 --> 47:13.840]  because folks it's as phony as a $3 bill and what a small world that this
[47:13.840 --> 47:24.400]  happened by the way Rob do also had family in the special forces who was in
[47:24.400 --> 47:28.960]  the marathon at Boston and told us a bunch of stuff and then never talked to
[47:28.960 --> 47:34.040]  us again after got threatened you name it there was a drill and they pulled him
[47:34.040 --> 47:39.680]  out right before the bomb went off so they're just it's just what a small
[47:39.680 --> 47:45.520]  world it is that through Rob do's family this stuff continues to come out
[47:45.520 --> 47:49.520]  Rob do's kind of like that in the hippie of the family and and now you know he
[47:49.520 --> 47:54.720]  works here but he's a patriot libertarian the rest of his family are you know kind
[47:54.720 --> 47:59.520]  of like the you know salty earth patriot types but you get into it and
[47:59.520 --> 48:04.800]  they're so naive until they run right into the reality I mean it all came out
[48:04.800 --> 48:11.680]  right before 9 11 and right after but the FBI was blown the whistle before 9
[48:11.680 --> 48:17.240]  11 about the flight schools being told to stand down same thing on 7 7 there were
[48:17.240 --> 48:21.520]  two FBI agents in the LA Times that saw the surveillance footage of McVay and
[48:21.520 --> 48:27.520]  eight other men staged the attack and they went public and said this should be
[48:27.520 --> 48:32.120]  released there should be investigation and of course they basically got given
[48:32.120 --> 48:36.440]  desk jobs over it but then they had other FBI agents go into the police
[48:36.440 --> 48:40.640]  department and threaten the head of the K9 unit Don Browning highly decorated
[48:40.640 --> 48:45.560]  Marine Corps veteran from Vietnam we've had him on three times they walked right
[48:45.560 --> 48:49.640]  ahead and said you and your wife are dead if you don't shut your mouth and then
[48:49.640 --> 48:54.120]  he didn't shut up so a month later he's at the water cooler and they walk in
[48:54.120 --> 48:59.080]  walk right over to him and say did you not get our first warning well guess
[48:59.080 --> 49:06.320]  what he still comes on this show and he named the names so suing oh you're not
[49:06.320 --> 49:10.640]  gonna sue the retired decorated police officer are you because you know it's
[49:10.640 --> 49:14.600]  true so see it's not that the whole government's bad you got FBI trying to
[49:14.600 --> 49:18.320]  expose it's a false flag over here and you got FBI right over here that's
[49:18.320 --> 49:24.120]  involved in it at least in the cover-up because you got the special units run by
[49:24.120 --> 49:33.400]  people like good old Eric Holder who's now gone back to work at the big law
[49:33.400 --> 49:37.680]  firm that's the only law firm you can hire like Arthur Anderson was for
[49:37.680 --> 49:41.840]  accountants who they certify what your company does paying no taxes or getting
[49:41.840 --> 49:47.480]  bailouts you never get prosecuted he'll go there now and make millions a year
[49:47.480 --> 49:52.560]  for a job well done screwing us over oh but don't worry he'll work to the
[49:52.560 --> 49:59.280]  Democrats and say to Texas through a DOJ front to move to indict our attorney
[49:59.280 --> 50:03.080]  general because he's a patriot and not a crook see if you're a crook and work for
[50:03.080 --> 50:08.720]  them you do fine if you're not a crook you get indicted and dr. Paul Craig
[50:08.720 --> 50:11.720]  Roberts has written an article about this today how they can indict a ham

[50:44.960 --> 50:51.240]  premeditated fraud what a joke the justice system at the federal level is
[50:51.240 --> 51:00.680]  defunct illegitimate not fit to attend toilets so mark and his wife came over

[54:09.080 --> 54:14.240]  well our government openly created ISIS out of Al Qaeda now they say we can't
[54:14.240 --> 54:24.160]  fight them we just got to be have better ideas coming up 10 killed 55 wounded in
[54:24.160 --> 54:28.440]  4th of July gun violence in Chicago that's the Chicago Tribune you mean
[54:28.440 --> 54:34.880]  black-on-black gang violence no let's blame the guns that's all coming up the
[54:34.880 --> 54:39.280]  third hour now it ties into the illegal alien crime wave and police and I
[54:39.280 --> 54:43.480]  brutal beating of white man by black mob was racially motivated even though
[54:43.480 --> 54:48.360]  that was put in the police report it's now been removed and that's like the
[54:48.360 --> 54:53.000]  San Francisco sheriff because the Hispanic killed a white person he's
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.400]  like defending himself and saying they've done nothing wrong and they would
[54:56.400 --> 54:59.520]  release the illegal again
[55:01.680 --> 55:07.920]  so it's it's it's really becoming a problem where white people mainly liberal
[55:07.920 --> 55:12.680]  trendies go into black areas and find out that it's not all as liberal and
[55:12.680 --> 55:21.080]  trendy as a you know as you thought and this is the wages of MSNBC in the
[55:21.080 --> 55:25.680]  White House where they're teaching young people it's virtuous to go out and
[55:25.680 --> 55:29.040]  attack a white person because they deserve it because they've got it out
[55:29.040 --> 55:37.240]  to get you so the problems in society never get fixed and so folks that are
[55:37.240 --> 55:44.480]  into thug culture are primed to go in to prison
[55:47.000 --> 55:53.880]  very very sad for everybody coming up London is now the global money laundering
[55:53.880 --> 55:58.440]  center of drug trade says crime expert oh but if you get caught selling a baggy
[55:58.440 --> 56:02.680]  a weed or something go to prison but the banks are laundering trillions every
[56:02.680 --> 56:06.280]  year globally and drug money all that can't be investigated I'm sorry the
[56:06.280 --> 56:09.040]  Justice Department doesn't do that
[56:09.040 --> 56:14.040]  Newsyam poll only 19% know first amendment guarantees freedom of
[56:14.040 --> 56:16.800]  religion yeah I want to send our reporters out they've been doing a great
[56:16.800 --> 56:21.920]  job why don't we send you Kari out see if he wants to go cover this and ask

[56:31.000 --> 56:37.720]  know what the first amendment is and then ask them about the poll they have a
[56:37.720 --> 56:40.720]  Lee and Mac the report coming up where she goes out and asks folks about Greece
[56:40.720 --> 56:44.640]  and their collapse and are they concerned I noticed most people wanted to
[56:44.640 --> 56:47.960]  say Greece was lazy and deserved it they didn't want to talk about are they
[56:47.960 --> 56:51.280]  worried about a collapse here they wanted to say they need to pay their debts
[56:51.280 --> 56:56.880]  really debts they didn't sign on to America is in deeper debt than Greece's
[56:56.880 --> 57:04.640]  overall and you watch these people sit there and shoot their mouths off
[57:08.520 --> 57:13.040]  one black guy gets it right and says it's an aristocracy running it not a
[57:13.040 --> 57:18.880]  democracy in Greece Greece meltdown is America next it's up on info wars.com

[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.640]  the beginning of the end of the EU project I want to look at the EU and
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:55.280]  what it is and actually what they maneuvered Greece into clearly Greece is
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.480]  partly the blame for allowing government to sign them on the derivatives to
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:04.520]  invest their pension funds in global equities and things that were
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:10.640]  questionable but we're just as guilty of it here and then coming up at the bottom
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:19.920]  of the third hour Rob do is coming in his uncle is was a former Navy SEAL is a

[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:37.800]  he's never seen people more secretive and he's been in John Gotti mob trials so
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:42.640]  he says it's the it's the it's the spookiest sneakiest what was the exact
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:49.640]  word strangest thing he's ever seen I'm telling you folks I didn't say it was
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.840]  staged at first and I got a lot of criticism just because I can't believe
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:02:00.240]  they're this bold man they're bold man they're bold and then I just can't believe
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.360]  what a small world it is that Rob do would end up going and doing this I did
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.440]  an anemic 30-second plug at the end of the last hour and we can't pay the bills

[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.280]  whole bunch of something to stockpile it and then it doesn't sell and then you
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.600]  buy other groups of something and it all sells out you're like that's great but

[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:09.200]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:19.520]  what is the European Union out of the United Kingdom ever get brought into it
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.360]  without having a vote well how did we get put into the Trans Pacific partnership
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:33.920]  without a say this is the nature of global governance what is the EU what
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.520]  is global governance why is it promoting global carbon taxes well to fund
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:47.040]  itself Lord Christopher Moncton was one of the top advisors and in the
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:51.280]  cabinet of Margaret Thatcher he's a best-selling author and researcher a top
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:56.400]  inventor and is no stranger to this audience will just be with us to the
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:01.160]  bottom of the hour maybe a little bit more of he has time but I wanted to get
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:05.520]  his take specifically on what's happening in Greece because from my
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:12.080]  perspective whether Greece gets bailed out or not the EU is designed to create
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:17.640]  financial crisis to consolidate nation states just two years ago the EU
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:27.080]  announced a move to get the nation states like France and Spain and others to
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:32.240]  not even call their national teams the French or the Spanish but to give them
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:38.600]  now basically dinosaur and superhero names and mythical names because even
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:44.040]  the idea of having national teams is xenophobic and bad see political
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:52.040]  correctness is to kill any national independent ideology and when you
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.920]  research deeper most of Greeks is so-called debt is globalist bank run
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:01.360]  derivatives that have been signed on to and separately we have the announcements
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.080]  they're gonna bail in and take money out of people's bank accounts China has
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:10.560]  started doing that that happened of course a few years ago in there in the
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:16.800]  Mediterranean as well in Cyprus and now banks are making similar announcements
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:22.880]  and preparations here and they're acting like cash is illegal so this is a
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:29.840]  very dangerous situation we're in some say it could bring down the whole world
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:36.280]  economy I wanted to get the perspective of a man who's been again at the highest
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:39.880]  levels of government an editor of a major newspaper studied the financial
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:44.240]  situation in Greece is one of the main opponents of the European dictatorship
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:49.320]  Lord Moncton thank you for joining us well Alex it's a pleasure to be with you
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:56.680]  and in a way I could say I told you so because in 1996 I gave a lecture to the
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.640]  faculties of economics and of international relations at the
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:05.800]  University of St Andrews here in Scotland and what I said was look the
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:09.520]  euro is going to fail now I didn't even start for three years after that but
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:15.080]  already I knew it was going to fail because they didn't understand the
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:20.400]  elementary economics of trying to put together an area with a single currency
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:24.880]  you have to have nations who are all more or less kind of economically
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.360]  competent at the same level this is known as the economics of optimal
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:34.600]  currency areas now these words are simply not known by the average politician
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:39.080]  and as a result they sailed ahead with the euro when it couldn't possibly work
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:47.000]  now it's failed but here's the warning if this one has failed imagine how much
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.360]  bigger the failure will be when the UN gets its way in Paris this December and
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:59.120]  sets up a world government which is like the EU but on a global scale with no
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.120]  escape for anyone at least at the moment you don't like the EU you can get out and
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.240]  go to the States or go to go to somewhere Canada or Australia you don't
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.680]  have to be in the EU but if it's a global government there's no escape unless
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:17.080]  you've got a spaceship and the problem is that these politically correct people
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:20.400]  you were talking of the people who think there is only one view and that's the
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.960]  Marxist view and nothing else should be allowed to prevail these people are
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.840]  dangerous it was they who captured the European Union they didn't actually set
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:34.000]  it up but they captured it very quickly after it was set up as you know the KGB
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.120]  was largely instrumental in founding the euro-dollar market and had a lot of
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.560]  influence on shaping the creation of the euro because they knew that the euro
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:48.400]  would undermine the economies of the EU which it's now doing even though
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:53.320]  Britain is outside the EU we are threatened by the bankruptcy of
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:58.400]  Greece because this could bring down a house of cards we have Portugal Spain
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:05.320]  Ireland even France Italy Belgium all these countries Poland they're all
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:10.240]  running massive debts they're all in serious financial trouble or natural
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:14.880]  troubles made worse by the euro you call it the EU dictatorship you just don't
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:19.080]  use that word lightly that's not rhetoric explain to them why you call it a
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:27.280]  dictatorship and what percentage of UK laws are now by imperial edict from the
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:34.440]  shadow of bureaucracy that's right now five laws out of every six that are made
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:39.920]  in the United Kingdom and inflicted upon us are made because the unelected
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:45.760]  commissars of the European Union who have the sole right to propose legislation
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:49.360]  for the whole of Europe and that legislation takes precedence over all
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:55.000]  our own domestic legislation they have to do what the commissars tell us to do
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.160]  commissar is the official German name for the 30 people who behind closed doors
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:05.320]  run Europe they have absolute power enormous wealth and no responsibility
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:12.000]  these are the people who now dictate to us what our laws shall be democracy has
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.120]  gone from within the European Union it will go from the world as a whole if the
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:23.440]  EU and the UN get together at Paris as they are already planning to do to set
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.080]  up a world government in the name of saving the planet from I want to talk
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.520]  about that world government because they tried five six years ago you were
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.360]  there got the secret document of course you got no credit it was just
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:38.080]  devastating victory it was like winning a major war stopping that global
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.600]  government treaty that they tried to keep secret they're keeping TPP secret
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.600]  but now more and more the Pope's calling for global governance on climate
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:52.360]  change it seems the whole system and their operatives are coming out being
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.600]  honest at least on the surface that yes it's global government but they're
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.960]  selling it as something to save people but you talk about how they use the
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:04.120]  Soviet or communist German name commas are for their political officers the
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:07.960]  commas are is of course with the political police in the Soviet Union under
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:13.000]  Obama this is mainstream news the Pentagon in 2010 said they're quote
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.360]  preparing to arrest libertarians and conservatives is actually in the army
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:21.600]  document and put them in quote reeducation camps it actually says
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.960]  reeducation camps so fantastical so over the top again this is that this is
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.760]  the danger because not only have you got the entire governing class now
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:36.480]  ganging up on the people in individual nations and look at your Supreme Court
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.760]  it got one out of its three big decisions right and look how badly wrong the
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:46.040]  other two were you have the Supreme Court unelected by anyone effectively
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:50.640]  making new law contrary to the Constitution and press it on its
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:55.240]  obligations and why are they all doing this why is the Pentagon joining in and
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:59.440]  saying right we're going to lock up the likes of Moncton and Jones in reeducation
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:03.240]  camps why are they doing this well that was my point I'm not joking I feel like
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:07.320]  a liar when I say that because it sounds so outrageous but I can show people the
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:11.320]  mainstream article in the army document why would they use terms like commas are
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:17.280]  in reeducation I mean they're using actual totalitarian terminology they're
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:22.880]  not even hiding it why because they think they've got away with it and they may
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:29.560]  have got away with it the problem is that at Paris in December which is the
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:35.000]  really big climate conference this is the big push where the entire kind of
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.880]  communist group worldwide is getting together and has captured most governments
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:44.160]  now I've act very nearly all governments I think are going to sign this
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:50.120]  agreement now the one thing that needs to be in that agreement to stop it setting
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:54.720]  up a world government is a clause the same as the clause that's in the Kyoto
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:00.080]  protocol which preceded this one the Kyoto protocol of 1997 which America
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:05.360]  didn't sign under Al Gore as president of the Senate because 95 out of a hundred
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:09.560]  senators voted it down but even that protocol at least contained what's
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:13.360]  called a freedom clause it's a secession clause technically as the name for it
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:17.400]  it means that any country after six months or a year doesn't like the
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:21.480]  obligations under the Kyoto protocol can simply give notice and break free
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:24.960]  Canada's done it Russia's done it Japan's done it several others I think
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:29.800]  we'll do it when they get the chance but what is now being proposed is a treaty
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:35.880]  like the European treaties which have no escape clauses once you're in you are
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:40.040]  subject to the alien power whether you like it or not with your voters like
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:44.160]  not whether your Congress likes it or not that's why this really is the end of
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.680]  democracy it's the end of democracy not just in some sort of general hand-waving
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:54.040]  eye-rolling sense it's the end of democracy because the law in future
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:59.280]  will make sure that the supreme law that applies to the United States after
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.760]  Paris will be the law made by what at the moment the treaty draft because I
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:08.800]  have seen it is calling a governing body now six years ago at Copenhagen which
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:13.320]  you mentioned earlier they called it a government they're now calling it a
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:18.360]  governing body but it's going to have even bigger powers of government than
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:22.640]  the government they were going to establish in Copenhagen and much of it
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.840]  is already in place they've just quietly steamed ahead regardless the defeat at
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:32.400]  Copenhagen and put a thousand new international bureaucracies in place all
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.320]  interlocking with one another the Pentagon talks to them of course the EU is in
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.520]  there and there's now a thousand of these bureaucracies which together will
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:46.840]  form the sinews the enforcement arm if you like of this new hideous totalitarian
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:52.320]  global government and all of this was based on the climate lie just as the
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:57.760]  European Union was based on the lie that the Soviet Union would otherwise pull
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:02.920]  Europe apart in fact NATO was already guaranteeing the security of Europe we
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:06.560]  didn't need the European Union for that and indeed if anything it has increased
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:11.360]  the risk of tension and war in Europe rather than reducing absolutely and you
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:14.440]  were right telling Thatcher that 30 years ago it's certainly been proven
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:18.400]  true moving forward as we're about to go to break certain and Lord Christopher
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:22.680]  Monckton joins us so undoubtedly do you agree with the point I've made and
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:27.600]  others are saying that this is the moment that they uncloak admit world
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:32.600]  government still deceive on the details but basically a merge I mean it looks
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:38.120]  like this is the big assault this is the next big phase the big takeover this is
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:43.760]  the big assault this is the moment when they think they're going to get away
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:48.320]  with setting up a world government and after the break I'll tell you how we're
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:52.960]  going to stop them it's an epic time to be alive folks because we're not just
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.640]  being conquered by some you know advanced civilization or something we're

[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:12.520]  arrive he stood six foot six and waited 245 kind of brawl at the shoulder and
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:19.680]  there at the hip and everybody knew you didn't give no lip to big John big John
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:28.680]  modestly with us for about 45 after that I'm going to big bad John get into the
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:33.680]  latest on Jade Helm where the mainstream media is misrepresenting what
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:37.520]  we're saying we've never said it's an imminent military takeover we've said
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:41.680]  what our own military sources have told us that it is just further acclimation
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.360]  to have troops on the streets of America not to counter ISIS or Al Qaeda but to
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:52.560]  counter citizens during a state level insurrection that means the state's
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:56.200]  taking their gold back from the Federal Reserve things like that that you now see
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:01.760]  happening I told you the new governor in Texas knows what's going on look at
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:07.240]  this headline we're training ISIS White House website contradicts Obama's
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:13.040]  speech blooper now I'm gonna ask Lord Moncton about ISIS and it being out of
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:16.400]  control and why the West allowed it to get out of control what he thinks about
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:20.560]  it in the next segment but I just wanted to mention that now the things are
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.240]  really starting to unravel with this narrative when Obama says we shouldn't
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:29.240]  be bombing them when the truth is they're really the Free Syrian Army that we
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:34.400]  helped arm I mean this is a big scandal about to break in my view but Lord
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:39.880]  Moncton was just joining us probably the chief EU critic in the world helped
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:44.240]  beef up and promote UKIP that's now one of the fastest growing parties in the
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:50.560]  world Nigel Farage is saying he believes that we're seeing the beginning of the
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:54.400]  breakup of the EU we'll get Lord Moncton's take on that but global
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:58.760]  government from the TPP to the Atlantic Treaty all of its being welded together
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:04.400]  now and the taxing authority for it the carbon tax is being pushed that's why
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.600]  they'll never give it up no matter how discredited it is so Lord Moncton you
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:14.160]  were saying before the break we can stop it you going to the alternative press
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:18.120]  literally parachuting in in Durban South Africa when they wouldn't let you in
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:22.160]  that stunt getting attention you more than anybody I know you don't want credit
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.440]  but but it's credit to humanity credit to the individual taking action
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:30.000]  undoubtedly if you didn't get the secret Texas Copenhagen undoubtedly if you
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.560]  didn't pull stunts to expose it undoubtedly if the cops didn't beat you up
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.880]  and bring attention to what was happening a lot of this stuff would have
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:41.560]  gotten through so when you say we can stop the formation of open world
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:46.440]  government I'm listening what do we do right the first thing is we're going to
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:53.200]  have to set up our own parallel freedom institutions worldwide and the most
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:59.800]  important of these is a currency if we take away their power to issue currency
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:04.880]  because we do it better than they do then we'll stop them when I gave that
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:09.680]  lecture in 1996 in the st. Andrews University I said the euro is just
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:14.560]  another me to fiat currency no assets in the bank to prop it up in fact now it
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:19.480]  has negative assets in the bank prop it up but if we were to set up our own
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:24.680]  currency people would rush to use it you can now make a currency of your own it's
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:28.320]  no longer illegal they can't stop you long as you don't print it or mint it
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:33.200]  just how is an electronic instrument of saving against which you can switch your
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.560]  credit card so you can you can spend on it just as you were spending in dollars
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:42.440]  then we can stop inflation in its tracks we can take currency away from central
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:47.080]  banks and put it back in the hands of the people and make a fortune doing it
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:50.960]  Alex that you and I could do this very well I've been studying this for some
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:56.960]  years I'm now just about ready to start that is step one which is there's got to
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:03.080]  be our own independent currency I totally agree and more transparent than
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:08.320]  Bitcoin I'm not attacking Bitcoin Bitcoin I would attack because it is
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:13.360]  simply there's no assets at the back of that that's why 78% of the value of
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:18.200]  bitcoins was wiped out just last year alone and the person who set it up
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:22.640]  committed suicide it is a nightmare because they didn't do it right what it
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:27.000]  shows is there's a huge demand for anything that isn't a government and
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.600]  imagine one based on universal liberty and freedom promoting libertarian
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:36.280]  enlightenment ideas everyone would politically support it and it was backed
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:41.240]  by something real explain this to me it would be a sensation certainly you come
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:47.400]  to me with your Mickey Mouse dollars or euros or pounds and I give you let's
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.600]  call it the talent in return and that would be simply an electronic unit of
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:57.000]  currency just like a unit in a unit fund and there would be fund managers who
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.880]  manage the fund that represents the talents I've given you so you give me
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.320]  your dollars I don't want to hold dollars because they're going to inflate
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.600]  away so what I do is I spend those dollars quick the day you give them to
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:13.400]  me buying assets that go into the fund so that the entire currency is
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:18.360]  completely self-funding and it's enormously profitable I'd be the first
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:23.720]  currency to ever do that in history that wasn't fiat or based in gold give you
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:29.840]  an example there was there was the Mark Banco in Hamburg which operated for 250
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:34.680]  years until about 1800 and that was so stable because it was based on silver
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:38.720]  it was always about a hundred and three percent this is so exciting stay there
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:41.920]  let's talk about it more Moncton when we come back long segment coming up we'll
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:48.760]  also give you his website when we return I'm Alex Jones info wars dot com we're
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:57.160]  on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:02.600]  presidential candidate Chris Christie wants Americans to blame Rand Paul for
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:06.240]  terror attacks that haven't even happened yet here is what he told Morning Joe
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.880]  viewers what Rand Paul has done to make the country weaker and more vulnerable
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:15.800]  is a terrible thing as the only guy who used the Patriot Act in this race as a
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:20.000]  former prosecutor we're going to look back on this and he should be in front
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.200]  of hearings and in front of Congress if there's another attack not the director
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:28.120]  of the FBI or the director of the CIA that's right governor Christie we
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:31.480]  shouldn't look at the FBI even though almost every terror attack on this
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:34.360]  country has happened with the help of an FBI informant or what about the
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:37.800]  statements made by agent Thomas Fuentes who said we have to keep the fear alive
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:42.040]  in order to justify budget increases and then back in 2009 former Homeland
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:45.320]  Security Secretary Tom Ridge claimed that he was pressured by members of
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:49.040]  George Bush's cabinet to raise the national terror alert level just before
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:53.200]  the 2004 presidential election no we shouldn't look at those guys that's
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:56.120]  right Christie you really have your priorities straight Rob do reporting

[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:13.320]  approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as

[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:28.320]  listening to Alex Jones bad luck when been blowing at my back I was born to
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:34.920]  bring trouble to wherever I'm at I want to just take a moment here to thank God
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:40.360]  got the number 13 for the Providence that free peoples throughout history have
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:45.200]  been given and I want to thank God for the gift of consciousness being a
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:49.080]  libelous planet I don't want listeners to think I'm a negative person there's so
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:56.680]  much good so much creativity so much beauty so much honor in this world but
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:02.680]  but good men and women tend to be very restrained and not take action almost
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:09.200]  like embarrassed to be aggressive or to give alternative ideas and we just kind
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:14.240]  of quietly sit there and have our own lives our own friends and recluse from
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:18.800]  the system if we do that we're going to lose everything because as I end of the
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:25.000]  last segment this tyranny we face is not like the Romans for all their barbarous
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:31.120]  problems conquering an area and bringing aqueducts and science and overall
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:37.160]  improving life generally you could argue that being conquered by the Romans if
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:40.280]  you were saying what's modern Switzerland today turned out to be a good
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:44.840]  thing in some cases they weren't consciously trying to destroy everything
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:49.600]  is the point they were very abusive very tyrannical I'm not endorsing Roman
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:57.120]  civilization you look at the elites we have today they instinctively are just
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:05.000]  very twisted people the ideology is anti-family anti-stability why would our
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.360]  government fund ISIS to take over the Middle East and destabilize things and
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:12.400]  kill every Christian they find and blow up every church they find I mean our
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:15.920]  government's had some problems in the past but I guarantee you Ronald Reagan
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:19.000]  wouldn't do that I guarantee you John F Kennedy wouldn't do that or Dwight D
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.520]  Eisenhower I mean I don't romanticize these people but we truly have new
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:31.760]  levels of corruption the boss hogs that ran this country LBJ as corrupt as he
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:36.880]  was would have never signed on to a TPP waving Congress's power they were
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:45.440]  territorial this was their country they were running so we have traders traders
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:48.800]  in our midst and I agree with Lord Monkton they think they've got full
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:52.360]  control now of the major nation states and it's why they're just moving at
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:58.840]  warp speed right now and their operatives are activating everywhere I know Lord
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.440]  Monkton's a Catholic I have a lot of Catholic friends I don't get into the
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:07.280]  whole Catholic or Protestant fight I'm just a Christian but this new Pope
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:12.360]  activating and and saying we need global government for you know the the carbon
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:15.760]  taxes I mean I don't know what they got on him or what's going on but that's
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:20.280]  got to be decried people are really showing which side they're on right now
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:25.160]  this is the big move and I mean there's the headline Pope Francis calls for a
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:28.560]  new system of global government to tackle climate change that's on an info
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:34.000]  wars dot com headline that's in Time Magazine Newsweek the BBC I mean Lord
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.760]  Monkton how do you square this what happened here is that Pope Francis was
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:43.920]  brought up in the communist tradition of what's called liberation theology which
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.360]  came out of the French universities like so many other bad ideas and it was
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:54.320]  taken back to Latin America by students for the priesthood who'd gone to study
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:37:01.120]  for university degrees in France and of course one of those was Pope Francis so
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:08.520]  he is an anti-capitalist through and through he realizes the power of this
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:13.760]  environmental issue in two directions one as a way of rallying his fellow
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:19.760]  communists everywhere and the other as a way of getting himself to the high
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:25.120]  table he's going to go to the UN and address the General Assembly and they're
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:30.080]  going to cheer him to the echo because of course the UN just like the EU uses
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:36.640]  the climate as an excuse to gather more powers to itself now the Pope wants to
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:43.080]  be part of that and so what he's doing is repositioning the church as an entity
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:48.640]  which no longer opposes communism now instead it opposes capitalism and this
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:53.880]  is really I think a mistake if you were going to get into politics at all you
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:58.280]  should certainly oppose communism and any other kind of totalitarianism but the
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:03.160]  Pope is now he's now come out in his true colors he's said right I am a
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:08.040]  communist I am want a world communist world government I want to be one of
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:14.320]  those in charge of it and if anyone disagrees then that's bad well we have
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:19.600]  to stand against this and we have to say with every respect to the Pope respect
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:25.320]  his office anyway that this is not the way forward communism killed a hundred
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:30.040]  million people in a lot of way it's still it could conservatively it's still
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:36.720]  killing people today the climate change thing is already killing people as well
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:41.280]  as they can't afford to heat or keep cool their homes whichever climate they
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:46.720]  live in because of absurdly high electricity prices global warming even
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:50.640]  if it were to go to the sort of levels that the extremists predict of three
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:54.560]  or four Celsius degrees by the end of this century which it won't there
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:59.440]  hasn't been any this century at all would not do very much harm what will do
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:04.640]  harm is the global government that the Pope and the UN and most governments
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:08.920]  in the world are determined to establish what we've got is the entire
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:14.880]  governing class worldwide yes ganging up against the people now here's the trick
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.760]  Alex what we've got to do is you can moan about it all you like but that
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:24.640]  won't achieve anything what we've got to do is to accept that we have
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:29.920]  ultimately the money that they depend on we have the numbers as well they don't
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:35.720]  and so what we need to start doing is increasingly taking the government of
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:41.920]  our own nation and of the world into our hands the hands of the free peoples of
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:48.520]  the world and say to our governments no we do not want Islam to become the
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:54.520]  normal political setup let it be confined to being a religion we want a
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:59.920]  democratic political setup by which the people decide what shape their
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:04.520]  government will take and not the governing class taking those decisions
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:09.040]  and this is why I was talking earlier of the idea of establishing and I want to
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:13.400]  get to that but since you raised that point the head of what you're
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:18.000]  mentioning the head of EU security came out three days ago in a speech and also
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.520]  an article and said we should have Islam as the political governing system
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:26.760]  basically so first they remove Christianity from society even though
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:31.200]  it wasn't governing it was an idea that helped guide things you know kind of
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:36.040]  like street lights at night now they're saying we should be absorbed by Islam
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:42.360]  why is there a suicidal bent by the leftist in Western civilization they
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:47.520]  rule it they've taken it over it's the engine of prosperity is there such an
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:53.840]  instinctive hatred of it that they have to execute it as some active galactic
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:58.120]  vandalism a and then be Lord understand one thing about the left which is
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:03.720]  absolutely crucial to understand and that is that the left's ambition is to
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:10.440]  keep the poor poor because the poor stupidly vote left the capitalist
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:15.960]  ambition the freedom-loving libertarians ambition is to make everybody rich so
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:20.120]  that they won't vote left that's the fundamental divide in politics the
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:25.160]  totalitarians want to keep people poor so that they can push them around but we
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:30.920]  will make people rich it always works if they just get out of our way they don't
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:34.520]  want to do that they want to run everything fingertip control the very
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:39.600]  word totalitarian means they want to troll every tiny last little detail of
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:44.120]  our lives down to the last flickering unreadable by poison-filled mercury
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:49.560]  light bulb that's how they are they cannot bear the idea of allowing people
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.960]  to take decisions for themselves and the one thing that they are frightened of
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:58.360]  is people who are independent enough to do that that's right so if we for
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:03.920]  instance set up our own currency if we set up our own parallel people's
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:07.800]  united democracies forget the united nations let's have the united
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:15.480]  democracies and let's start setting up a complete parallel set of global
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:20.960]  institutions that are governed not by the governing class but by the votes of the
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:25.880]  people who wish to participate and the left will find that very hard to take
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:29.720]  over because as long as we keep it democratic they can't stop us that's
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:33.120]  right explain a little bit about how the UN and these other bodies are
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:37.640]  totalitarian because they always put provisos in like article 30 of the UN
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:41.800]  Charter that says all these rights are null and void whenever we feel like it
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:46.480]  but let's go back to a question I didn't quite get out to you so for 30 years
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:50.000]  they've said you're wrong there's no move towards covert global socialist
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.720]  communist government for 20 years they've told me I'm wrong for 30 something
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:57.080]  years they've told Ron Paul he's wrong for 50 years they told Barry Goldwater
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:03.280]  he was wrong now this covert plan is in the headlines I had nightline here four
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:09.800]  years ago I had CBS Nightly News here two years ago I don't even take the
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:13.280]  interviews anymore because they always distort them and they look at me and I
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:17.280]  show them all these articles all these clips of world leaders Gordon Brown you
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:22.320]  name it calling for global government Herman von Roompi Bill Clinton and they
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:24.960]  looked at me and they said that's a different global government than you're
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:29.760]  talking about and then went on to say I was insane on television so how do they
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:34.320]  square there is no world government there is they Al Gore was in Congress as
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:40.000]  you knows eight years ago and said there is no move for a carbon tax and then
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:45.480]  proposed it a year later what is this tactic of of of saying two plus two
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:49.640]  equals five raising debt limit doesn't raise debt limit if we've been
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:54.840]  exposing global governments coming it's bad it's totalitarian they deny it now
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:44:00.320]  it's here how do they then not become discredited how do they just make this
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:07.600]  shift and why are they making the shift three words Ion Mihai Pacheco now he
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:13.080]  was the head of the security which was the secret police in Chausescu's
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:19.960]  communist Romania about 30 years ago now he was part of the largest directorate
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:25.320]  of the KGB which was known as the disinformation directorate the disinformation
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:31.560]  directorate that directorate had one million western communists who were not
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:35.760]  known to be communists not known to be working with the KGB who were in the
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:42.800]  west beavering away in the BBC in the CBC in the NBC in the ABC all the big TV
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:47.520]  networks all the big newspapers all the big industries all the big trade unions
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:53.200]  all the big churches they were everywhere making sure that when the moment came and
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:57.440]  the moment has now come every one of these institutions would already have
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:03.520]  been taken over by communists and let's use this word communist rather more
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:09.160]  freely than we have in the past because what it is after the McCarthy era it was
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:12.920]  kind of not fashionable to use the word communist but now that's the word we have
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:18.520]  to use these are Marxists these are people who wish to control us and we do
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:23.680]  not wish to be controlled by them they unfortunately control the overwhelming
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:27.600]  majority of the news media which is why your program exists Alex there be no
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:32.320]  need for it if the news media were doing their job so because of this
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:37.400]  extraordinary degree of control that these million agents managed to obtain
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:43.120]  and which they continued to operate even after the KGB had gone this was a sort
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:48.480]  of self-perpetuating organization effectively we on the free market end
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:53.120]  of things didn't organize we didn't organize in the same way it was more
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.880]  disinformation that they completely fell they did fall because the the engine
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:02.560]  failed but by then they'd already metastasized other cancers into us and
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:06.680]  now they're manifesting they'd already quietly taken over our major
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:11.480]  institutions the BBC is a very they are at war with families and wealth and they
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:15.480]  admit cloward and piven they want everybody poor so the commas are is
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:19.640]  considered around at their duchies white kings over us this is the new royalty
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:23.440]  this is the new french revolution that's it it's an aristocracy of
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:28.720]  blaggers it's exactly what they've been planning all along and this is a huge
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:33.680]  attack by the governing class which is now largely left-wing on the people and
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:38.400]  the people are going to have to get organized in various ways and Alex
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.000]  you're going to be a very important part of this because we're literally going
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.000]  to have to establish a resistance movement just like the French resistance
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.440]  because that's the kind of regime we're going to end up with right if this
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:53.240]  carries on already they are more and more openly and more and more frequently
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:58.880]  demanding the likes of me who dare to do scientific research and publish papers
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:03.160]  in leading scientific journals raising questions about their yes you really
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:06.640]  of global war arrested they're increasingly saying we must be tried
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:11.920]  imprisoned and executed that's right they've now changed their tone in the
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:16.560]  last month there's been five articles I've seen seriously saying shut me off
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:20.200]  the air and I'm dangerous and then ever used to talk like that I mean they're
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:24.400]  very naked now and I agree I believe they're about to make it because they
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:28.680]  think they're very near to power they think that Paris is going to do it for
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:33.560]  them and at the moment that's right because we have governments who are
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:39.000]  intellectually enfeebled only people like David Cameron he's a smooth operator
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.600]  but he doesn't really believe anything or know anything or understand because he
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:48.960]  wasn't from that generation that you and I were we had to fight the communists
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:53.240]  to eventually prevail over them he didn't have to do that so he thinks he
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:56.840]  can sit back and be part of this world government and somehow it will be a
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:00.160]  capitalist government on the night well no it won't it will be another
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:04.080]  totalitarian government somewhere between fascism and corporatism and
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:10.040]  communism and if we don't stop it it will take control over every detail of
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:14.320]  our lives already they're fiddling the data fiddling the temperature records
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:19.680]  fiddling everything so to try to pretend that what they now perfectly well know
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:23.800]  isn't happening with the climate is happening because we've already done it
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:27.280]  they don't call it warming they call it climate change promises shall come on
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:31.840]  from Paris I'm tempted to go to Paris and Greece next month to cover all this
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:35.680]  effect I'm looking at it doing it right now but thank you so much Lord Moncton
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:39.680]  give us your website it's been a pleasure go to science and policy
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:44.480]  science and public policy.org that's the best one to go to or what's up with
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:49.240]  that.com WATTS up with that.com either of those you'll find plenty of
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:53.040]  material from me on the climate question so God bless you Alex and God bless
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:57.000]  America. Thank you very much sir well he's never meant words before but that
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.600]  was his strongest words then that's not rhetoric global totalitarianism it's on
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:06.280]  fascist on top communist on the bottom because the globalists are exempt from
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:11.320]  the communist hell they'll put over the nation states diplomatic and political
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:20.000]  immunity the new royalty we are in big trouble big trouble and we're going to
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.600]  have to mobilize I mean they want revolution against the police to start
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:32.920]  a civil war communist playbook all the way. Briefly Anthony Gussiardi had a
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:37.280]  great idea today we have people beating down the walls the reviews are coming in
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:41.400]  we ordered a limited amount of brain force the ultimate brain boost formula
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:45.920]  not with GMO not with chemicals not with herbs that make you high but stuff that
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:50.400]  just gives you the chemicals your brain already needs to operate normally and I
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:56.120]  ran out of this on Friday thank God the the truck came in over the weekend and
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:00.560]  got more I take two tablets a day you can take three tablets a day brain force
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:05.440]  it's going to be sold out for it looks like four weeks it's being manufactured
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:10.680]  being produced right now here in the USA. People don't want to sign up for the
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:14.520]  list I mean they are to be emailed when it's back in they want to pre-order it
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:19.880]  phone calls beating down our doors so by the end of the show it'll be at

[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:34.640]  like what we're manufacturing will probably sell out about a week or two
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:38.280]  when it comes in but it's a catch-22 with all our other expenses we don't have
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:42.040]  the money to order a huge amount and then gamble and not be able to sell it so
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:46.480]  we have a limited amount coming in if you want to be secured your brain force

[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:23.960]  radio chips inside them called RFID the transmitter banking information to
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:27.960]  card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad guy can also get one of these
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:31.440]  readers and go around the city scanning people collecting their credit card

[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:23.080]  they saw the revolution happening here so they piggybacked a few years after and
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:28.800]  they were gonna abolish the family they were inverting everything literally
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:33.600]  crosses upside down was basically satanic they were demanding women have sex
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:38.200]  with the leaders of it they were gonna set themselves up as the new gods it was
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:43.320]  a cultic in nature the Jacobins and others and that's where all this modern
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:50.440]  system comes from it's it's it's a it's a power cult it's it's it's a devil
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:55.320]  cult and if you look at the hammer and sickle the red flag all of that comes
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:00.880]  out of it does it come from Marx and Ingalls why do you have the mega rich
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:12.360]  funding communism because they administer it offshore coming up Rob do's gonna be
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:17.600]  in the studio we're gonna play the video with Dan Badandi our reporter going to
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:24.600]  the hearings at Sandy Hook and interviewing Rob do's uncle who was
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:29.760]  former Navy SEAL former FBI agent retired works in a major security firm he
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:32.440]  said he wanted to investigate it and he's investigating it now instead he's
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:37.920]  never seen anything like it what a small world Rob do didn't even spur him to go
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:42.880]  do this he talked to colleagues in the FBI others and they said no this needs to
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:46.800]  be looked at we can't do it you go look at it
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:53.080]  the former state police officer ran one of the biggest school security firms in
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:59.240]  the country went there and investigated it and said oh my god it's not real I
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:05.360]  mean it's Wolfgang Halberg I didn't believe it was staged at first but I
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:09.240]  mean it's just the official story is not true that's what I know and they're
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:18.160]  hiding something so that's all coming up and I'm gonna get into the unprecedented
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:26.640]  illegal alien crime wave that just they get get out of jail free carts and how
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:30.320]  that ties into the other things that are happening I mean Bernie Sanders folks is
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:34.520]  now the frontrunner basically against Hillary and I don't think Bernie Sanders
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:39.960]  is an evil guy Hillary is evil but Bernie Sanders would ruin this country if
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:44.720]  he got control of it and it just shows how the Democrats are desperate for
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:48.680]  anything he'll criticize the big banks he'll criticize the bailouts but Bernie
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:54.240]  big government spending and entitlements is what got us into this buddy no do the
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:57:00.160]  math no amount of money will ever prop all this up Baba the bankers want that

[02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:27.520]  Austin Texas Alex Jones coming up the next segment I don't even know what
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:36.200]  all this just the propaganda war legitimizing criminal activity you got
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:39.400]  whites getting attacked everywhere and in the media covers it up that it's
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:43.560]  racial you got a much bigger crime wave of illegals just pouring in by the
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:48.920]  millions a lot of them criminals running from crimes they've committed raping
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:54.840]  shooting murdering and doubling down by the sheriff in San Francisco saying we
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:01:00.080]  didn't do anything wrong releasing a felon seven-time felon deported five
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:05.800]  times we need ice to get there and do their job as if and in a way that's
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:09.360]  true because ice won't do its job but then you won't turn people over to them
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:14.160]  I mean you can Google Travis County Sheriff under fire for deportations and
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:21.840]  then you read it's felons five a week on average are deported and the Democrats
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:28.200]  want a black Democrat removed and now Obama has quote scaled back immigration
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:33.600]  deportations well it already happened over a year ago there's basically almost
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:37.920]  no deportations except for super hardcore felons out of the country and then
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:45.080]  a a 4 4 4 visual optics a few thousand here and there of millions and they'll
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:52.480]  deport people that try to go in and stay here legally like I'm always
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:58.160]  talking about engineers who have family here or who have married somebody and
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:01.320]  they'll say it's a sham marriage and send them out of the country but then if
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:03.840]  you want to come here from again the biggest group of immigrants now it's not
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:08.680]  Mexicans Chinese and you come here and have your baby openly you have the baby
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:12.680]  two weeks after you arrive you you come you you get your extended stay it's in
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:16.400]  the news how they do it you have your baby it's all paid for and then if I
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:20.280]  don't want to pay for it I'm racist can I go to China and say I'm here to have my
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:25.760]  baby I want my free everything I mean it's crazy and what's really got me
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:35.640]  angry about this is the Donald the criticisms of Donald Trump that he's
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:41.240]  racist I mean I've got articles here where Hispanics don't Hispanic immigrant
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:45.360]  laborers being legal aliens working on the new Trump building don't know they
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:49.560]  want to be around him or work for him I mean that's an issue right there we
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:53.240]  should investigate Trump is he have any illegals working for him and again I'm
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:58.400]  not even against the average person that's ever want a better life the point
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:05.240]  is that the large minority of the people that are criminals or milk of the
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:12.200]  system need to be kicked out I mean if you if you can't kick them out then you
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:17.800]  don't even have a country this is chumpville we're talking about I mean I
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:23.960]  can't go to Mexico or Guatemala or Nicaragua or El Salvador or Colombia
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:30.920]  or Venezuela or Brazil or Chile let's just go south and show up and ask for
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:37.960]  free stuff they will laugh at you but you got these big banks and globalist
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:41.880]  groups that are financing I mean JP Morgan runs the food stamp program makes
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:50.900]  the money off of it takes the taxpayer money they're behind it all Donald
[02:03:50.900 --> 02:03:56.920]  Trump signature collection made in Mexico yeah and I think Donald Trump will
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:00.560]  argue yeah those are good seamstress people working in Mexico I'm all for
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:03.960]  trade I'm all for open business because they're now going after him saying he's
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:08.760]  a hypocrite making stuff in Mexico I actually buy coffee from Mexico it's
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:13.000]  the best coffee according to my palate and it helps local farmers I'm not
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:20.520]  against helping people in Mexico that's the answer but now the media is going
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:26.760]  after Trump like where was that article from that's interesting find that
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:29.960]  Huffington Post and what are they saying let me see the headline please
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:35.080]  Donald Trump gets his stuff made in Mexico by those lazy people he didn't
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:40.920]  say that he said the bad are coming up here in some cases internet reminds
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:44.360]  Donald Trump is signature collection is made in Mexico yeah that's what I'm
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:48.160]  seeing from Huffington Post and in raw story is like Hispanics are hurt the
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:52.520]  Donald Trump says they're lazy Donald Trump didn't say that I'm sick of you
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:05:00.560]  liars it's incredible it's incredible amazing following millions of concerned
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:05.080]  individuals speaking out over Monsanto's monopoly of the food supply the
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:09.160]  White House has officially announced that it will be rolling out a new GMO
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:13.360]  regulation plan that could radically change the current food supply in a
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:17.440]  recent announcement that you probably missed as it was released just before
[02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:21.440]  the 4th of July weekend on the White House website the White House finally
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:25.520]  declared that a new review on the current GMO regulation laws is being
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:30.600]  launched regulation laws that have not been changed since 1992 when biotech
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:34.920]  juggernauts did not have nearly the firm grasp on the food supply that they do
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:40.760]  today in other words the 1992 based regulations are completely outdated and
[02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:45.320]  the White House is being forced to maybe do something about it and before you
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:49.440]  say that this could never happen remember that it was activism that forced
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:53.000]  the federal government to lower water fluoridation levels for the first time

[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:58.520]  want to just mention some of the news that's coming up after we break this
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:05.960]  down we're training I sold White House website corrects Obama's speech
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:14.800]  blooper presidents embarrassing error during press briefing amended on official

[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:53.680]  article out of vanity fair is this creepy real-life secret society the key to
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:10:00.880]  true detective season two and then they mesh reality with unreality I guess
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:07.520]  Matthew McConaughey's popular TV show I don't know I don't watch it with the
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:12.200]  fact that Bohemian Grove is weird and is creepy because used to they would just
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:16.640]  deny it existed when I'd cover it 15 16 years ago and at first they said my
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:21.800]  infiltration was fake and wasn't real and then they admitted okay snuck in we
[02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:25.680]  like to arresting then I went in there with Brad Metzler's people and they
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:29.560]  arrested them I didn't stop I ran and jumped in the river and swam off so of
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:32.320]  course they did to show that at the end of the show they threatened and died
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:36.080]  everybody if they didn't refuse to show that and why because it looks super
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:39.640]  Rambo me jumping in the Russian River innovating them and swimming down the
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:44.520]  river and climbing out and climbing around when the police were trying to
[02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:48.000]  get me I mean big deal I'm a journalist going to cover what's going on in there
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.720]  I knew they'd blown our cover I told them they had moles inside their their group
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:56.800]  that the police were waiting on us I hung back and said I wouldn't go in there
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:02.040]  if I was you I was not technically on their property they came out the police
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:09.000]  to snatch him with private security and I escaped I've had like four or five
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.520]  people the last two days on the street bring that up so I guess they're re-airing
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:21.400]  that on Discovery Channel but I know a setup when I see one and it didn't take
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:28.960]  much we were shooting interviews for it at this old Gothic style theater there
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:36.920]  in Monterey of a little town and one of the people locals they had hired they
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:41.400]  were openly talking about how we're about to infiltrate it that day and one
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:44.320]  of the locals was telling me he thought it was wrong that we were exposing it
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:47.920]  that he worked there and I said hey that guy's gonna drop a dime on us if he
[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:51.040]  hadn't already done it I don't think we should sneak in today we should
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:55.480]  sneak in in the morning and I said they're still gonna be waiting now they
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:12:06.000]  said don't be a conspiracy theorist Alex the director did and the guy was
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:11.200]  wearing a hat a ball cap that said CIA and he thought it was freaking me out
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:14.920]  that he was wearing the ball cap I was just like give me a break man it's like
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:18.320]  one time David Knight went in to interview the head UT professor on a
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:24.040]  21 he adds their program and the guy like was it David Knight or was it
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:28.760]  Melissa Melton I know they told me about it that was David Knight it was
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:34.880]  Melissa turns the turns the coffee cup towards them and goes you know I know
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:47.920]  the CIA oh you mean this you mean the CIA might get us oh no we better not have
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:51.600]  whistleblowers on on Benghazi and Lieutenant colonels exposing at day
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:55.320]  one and Navy SEAL families exposing how you murdered them and and in
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:59.040]  government narcotics trafficking and child kidnapping rings oh you mean they
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:07.280]  might get us oh you mean we're gonna all get real scared now I love how these
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:15.440]  people always try to scare us even their camp followers and minions like we're
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:19.880]  like them like we don't know how dangerous this is it's just funny it's
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:23.920]  like telling some face jumper who's jumping off a 50-story building hey
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:32.240]  you know you could die doing that they always do that but at the same time I
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:36.720]  wasn't gonna have them indict me for trespassing when I didn't trespass I
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:42.400]  hung back I know state law I looked it up on the riverbank and the tributary
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:46.240]  running up in it didn't go past the no trespassing signs I know that are up on
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:52.920]  their actual property line those their reporters hadn't even gotten over the
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:57.880]  true property line and still took them to jail see that was a hoax right there
[02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:02.240]  everything's a hoax everything's a fraud you're not gonna kangaroo indict me
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:08.520]  you're gonna have to work for it so I went and jumped in the kayak and sent it
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:13.800]  the wrong direction and swam off that's pretty fun they had the police just
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:17.400]  running around looking for me oh my gosh an evil reporter of course they've
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:22.360]  arrested a lot of reporters that sneak in there a vanity fair people magazine
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:27.040]  CBS so I just think it's funny that you know I said I'd cover that a little while
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:41.200]  I kind of just covered it I guess you know snuck in and got footage nobody
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:45.440]  else did and you know it's not because I'm skilled it's because I got God with
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:50.520]  me you you Star Wars nerds got the force with you believe me in my life I got
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:53.920]  God with me doesn't mean I'm perfect doesn't mean I have all the answers but
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:59.160]  info wars has been able to break every record infiltrate every operation blow
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:04.360]  the criminal cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:08.160]  freedom and I'm so proud of that every time I get upset because I can't beat
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:12.160]  these people fully I just gotta remember that we've had a lot of victories and
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:16.720]  praise God for it I've got to be more positive I just beat myself up want to
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:21.400]  take these people down I am sick of them I am tired of them and they're going to
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:26.840]  get it politically they're stinking world governments out in the open the
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:30.240]  fact that the Saudis ran 9-11 and the FBI was ordered to stand down as out in
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:36.080]  the open everything we told you is out in the open where are the apologies from
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:40.880]  Fox News MSNBC and CNN where are the apologies from Glenn Beck where are the
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:47.920]  apologies from Rush Limbaugh where are the apologies from Sean Hannity where are
[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:56.680]  the apologies they are nowhere because everybody wants to play it safe and go
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:16:01.120]  along with the system you can't play it safe when your house is on fire you
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:10.040]  can't negotiate with it and instinctively I
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:17.800]  cannot go along with this I just can't give in I can't give up and I never will
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:25.040]  because giving into them is dying in my spirit I feel like claustrophobic or
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:30.040]  like I'm drowned or like I'm in the process of it when I even think about
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:35.080]  giving in backing off it's the only time I feel weak only time I feel soulless
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:41.520]  only time I feel dishonorable is to even entertain in my mind not that I'm
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:45.400]  thinking about selling out or going along or backing off or not pushing as
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:50.640]  hard but when my mind even entertains the idea it's like an energy field that
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:56.480]  will suck my soul out and I just the God-fearing instincts I have make me just
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:05.840]  go I go harder that's not enough you've got to fight them these people deal and
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:10.280]  kidnap kids these people put fluoride in your water to brain damage you and your
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:14.560]  family and in the vaccines these people are coming for everybody I'm not gonna
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:18.080]  wait around to be soft-killed I'm gonna wait around and watch my family die
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:23.080]  around me I'm gonna die fighting in the info war against these people and I'll
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:27.120]  tell you something they want to get a civil war going they want to be at the
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:31.760]  local level to against the police and local bureaucrats don't even know what's
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:37.280]  going on on average more inform the public but not not not informed because
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:40.320]  they know it's coming they can't believe our restraint this far but let me tell
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:45.640]  you something nobody's putting any vaccines for me and my children you want
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:50.000]  to assault me I'll defend myself and this is the point that we're now coming
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:56.080]  down to and folks you're gonna have decisions put right in front of you as
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:01.600]  the tyranny gets worse and worse and worse and worse and you're going to have
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:04.920]  to decide whether you're gonna go with the political correctness which is
[02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:09.680]  tyranny and go with the end of freedom and go with the Talitarianism and its
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:13.760]  control of language or whether you're gonna decide to start fighting you start
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:17.600]  telling people about this radio show do your own podcast do your own local

[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:43.880]  I don't care what it is the act of doing something and resisting will grow into
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:47.880]  a mission for you but you've got to make the decision to take the first steps
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:52.640]  and then Providence I guarantee you if you fight tyranny for the right reasons
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:57.680]  not to be famous not to be cool not to just have opposition to people but if
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:03.600]  you do it really want to help folks and are praying to God to guide you you'll
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:08.320]  just see suddenly cops dealing drugs you'll videotape it they'll go to prison

[02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:21.040]  powder that is easier to absorb then you may be able to gain back some strength
[02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:25.760]  muscle and speed of recovery. One World Way is a highly digestible whey protein
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:30.800]  powder that may be the perfect answer for you. My name is Errol I'm 74 years old

[02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:38.880]  taking One World Way and your trace mineral supplement I have more energy
[02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:43.280]  and recover faster from my working out. I used to take another grass-fed whey
[02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:47.600]  protein powder but now I'm getting much better results using One World Way.

[02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:07.960]  Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for
[02:24:07.960 --> 02:24:13.640]  your mind. So here are just some of the headlines on this front at infowars.com.
[02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:18.880]  Police deny brutal beating of white man by black mob was racially motivated.
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:24.680]  Report originally stated incident was anti-white attack. And if you watch the
[02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:30.160]  video this is happening all over where whites not blacks are being attacked. So
[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:34.120]  the next time the Klan even though it's rare comparatively wasn't rare back in
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:37.880]  the 50s and 60s goes out and attacks a black person we'll just say that's
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:43.520]  not racial either. But why won't they do this because it doesn't fit the narrative
[02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:49.200]  that only white people engage in racial activities. Notice down the Democratic
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:53.600]  Party everything is about what color you are or how you identify the opposite of
[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:58.760]  what Martin Luther King said. I mean just recognize how evil the White House and
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:04.720]  MSNBC are. The Washington Post is out now saying people are against Jade Helm
[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:12.040]  drills that start in about a week and run through August because we don't like a
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:17.640]  black president. No we know the military is training for domestic takeover. We're
[02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:23.200]  not saying this is the takeover we're saying we want details because they say
[02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:28.040]  they're going to simulate criminal activity. And they spend it to say the
[02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:34.320]  Americans are coming some in Texas county fear and Obama led US military
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:38.440]  invasion. Total misrepresentation of what we've been saying for three months.
[02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:44.920]  But now it's racist. And then boom if you say illegals are in a crime spree and
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:47.920]  above the law and keep getting released you're racist even though it's true.
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:52.280]  Illegal immigrant deported six times charge in felony hit-and-run a family
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:56.040]  that injured young children still in the hospital. Meanwhile the San Francisco
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:26:01.280]  sheriff defends releasing killer calls Trump an opportunist. That's the sheriff
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:06.280]  of San Francisco County that had released the five time deported seven
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:13.360]  time felon who had shot the young woman Francisco Sanchez just did it for no
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:17.960]  reason or the witnesses and then now he says he was shooting at sea lions or it
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:21.160]  was in a bag he didn't know it was a gun. I mean believe whatever made up story you
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:26.640]  want we better just let him go or we're racist. This is how to paralyze people.
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:30.880]  Now Trump says infectious diseases is pouring across the border. Well that's
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:34.320]  true. It's why you got to take all the medications when you go down south. I
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:39.600]  mean it's just crazy. It's like saying when Europeans came they didn't bring
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:46.200]  smallpox. It's just a fact. But now he claims the gun went off accidentally
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:52.560]  and then it was wrapped up. But now at Trump hotel site immigrant workers are
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:57.960]  wary of him. Well let's find out if the construction company is using his
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:09.240]  employee legals because by the way it is a crime in Mexico big time to work in
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:14.040]  Mexico without a worker permit but that's okay. They're allowed to put illegal
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:17.560]  immigrants for six months to a year hard labor. It's okay Mexico has the most
[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:21.440]  draconian immigration laws in the western hemisphere because Mexico has some
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:27.280]  brown people in it. But if America has any laws we're racist. Let's go ahead and
[02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:32.560]  go to the clip of the San Francisco County Sheriff. Pretty sick. Long before
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:37.720]  Francisco Sanchez opened fire and killed Kate Steinle on Pier 14 San Francisco
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:42.800]  Sanctuary city status has been a source of contention. Sheriff Mercury says the
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:48.920]  policy is clear. He needs a court order or a warrant. In Sanchez's case ICE only
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:54.440]  asked for detainer which the sheriff says under city law isn't good enough. Local
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:28:00.600]  governments have the right to require a legal instrument such as a court order
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:05.760]  that go on warrant. ICE has no city by city breakdown statewide in the last
[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:10.280]  13 months more than 10,000 undocumented immigrants have been released from
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:14.920]  custody in California without immigration officials being notified and the
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:19.280]  sheriff tried to turn the table on ICE saying they are the ones that need to
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:24.160]  make sure they get it right. If ICE does not provide the proper legal
[02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:29.480]  instrument they are jeopardizing also the city's ability to detain somebody.
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:35.280]  That's enough. Shut him up. That is that a Sophistic baloney. They gave them the
[02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:38.480]  instrument you were supposed to under federal and state law but you have a
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:43.720]  city law that no one will sue to reverse in 800 plus cities that you release
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:50.920]  felons, rapists, killers over and over again because they're an illegal
[02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:55.720]  immigrant. Oh you'll turn a citizen over when they're been incarcerated for a
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:59.920]  state issue if there's a federal felony for something but not if it's an illegal.
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:06.000]  And then meanwhile the media runs with hoax stories that whites are killing
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:10.520]  blacks. They're just made up and then police come out the police chief and
[02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:14.920]  denies brutal beating. We'll play some of the video now of white man by black mob
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:18.240]  was racially motivated even though they're screaming explosives attacking
[02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:23.720]  the police because folks think this is how you demonstrate now. We're gonna come
[02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:29.600]  back and play some of that the videos on info wars.com. I mean look he's
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:34.240]  obviously a white devil he probably should have been killed and then get
[02:29:34.240 --> 02:29:40.960]  the people that did it in a metal. I mean this is crazy folks that the media
[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:45.600]  this is political correctness. I mean this is how they want to cause civil war
[02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:50.920]  in this country. This is totally sick. We're on the march. The empire's on the
[02:29:50.920 --> 02:29:57.000]  run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:03.200]  Following millions of concerned individuals speaking out over Monsanto's
[02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:07.440]  monopoly of the food supply the White House has officially announced that it
[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:11.760]  will be rolling out a new GMO regulation plan that could radically change the
[02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:15.600]  current food supply. In a recent announcement that you probably missed
[02:30:15.600 --> 02:30:19.520]  as it was released just before the 4th of July weekend on the White House
[02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:24.160]  website the White House finally declared that a new review on the current GMO
[02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:28.120]  regulation laws is being launched. Regulation laws that have not been
[02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:33.040]  changed since 1992 when biotech juggernauts did not have nearly the firm
[02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:38.440]  grasp on the food supply that they do today. In other words the 1992 based
[02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:43.160]  regulations are completely outdated and the White House is being forced to maybe
[02:30:43.160 --> 02:30:47.800]  do something about it. And before you say that this could never happen remember
[02:30:47.800 --> 02:30:51.280]  that it was activism that forced the federal government to lower water
[02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:56.200]  fluoridation levels for the first time in 50 years. You can find more reports on

[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:33.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:45.440]  Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. We have been warned. We have been warned. We
[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:49.840]  have been threatened. We have been told your official channels, unofficial
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:56.920]  channels, threats, you name it, stop investigating Sandy Hook. Now, when this
[02:33:56.920 --> 02:34:00.360]  first happened a few years ago, I didn't come out of the gate saying it was a
[02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:05.360]  false flag. And I got criticized by a lot of our listeners who were smart folks
[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:09.520]  and who went and really investigated that, hey Alex, you need to look at this
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:20.400]  again. All I know is that the official story doesn't add up and that when
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:25.600]  retired state police officers and school investigation experts and school safety
[02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:32.640]  experts and others began to investigate it, they were threatened. No emergency
[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:36.520]  helicopters were sent. The ambulances came an hour and a half later and parked
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:41.440]  on the road. DHS an hour and a half later with a timestamp put up signs saying
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:44.640]  sign in here. They had porta-potties being delivered within an hour and a half.
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:50.240]  It looked like a carnival. Looked like a big PR stunt. Came out at Bloomberg a day
[02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:54.840]  before, sent an email out to his gun control groups in all 50 states saying
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:35:01.760]  prepare to roll. We're a major operation coming up. That came out in the news. We
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:05.400]  have the emails from city council back and forth and the school talking about
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:11.400]  having shut down a year before. We have the school then being demolished and the
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:18.880]  records being sealed. We have videos that look just incredibly suspicious where
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:21.400]  people are laughing and everything and they start huffing and puffing and start
[02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:26.560]  crying on TV which is pure acting method. You've got a degree Rob in theater. I
[02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:30.960]  mean this is something that even lay people notice. So I began to
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:35.640]  investigate. They had a weird anti-terrorism unit from the state nearby
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:39.600]  with men in the woods which were on video from helicopter. Then they said
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:50.240]  that didn't exist and so we'll recap some of the history of this but now your
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:56.120]  uncle John Dew Navy Seal retired FBI agent works for successful security
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:04.040]  company. I had missed this episode of the nightly news back on June 4th and then
[02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:09.120]  again last week when you did an update and then I heard you talking about it
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:12.960]  yesterday. I knew that we'd sent our reporter Dan Badandi there for days to
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:16.520]  cover the city council hearings about it and the fact that they're sealing
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:20.920]  everything and then you just said oh yes and that's why I'm trying to get my
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:26.360]  uncle to tell me more because he's been in John Gotti hearings and been involved
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:32.440]  in huge cases. A pretty prominent FBI agent before he retired and in his words
[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:36.840]  he said he's seen the most secretive mafia stuff ever and he's never seen
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:40.720]  people more clothes-lipped. He's never seen something where it basically
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:47.480]  stinks and we'll use his words but the headline here is retired FBI agent
[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:52.360]  investigating Sandy Hook. I mean that was just amazing to me that so much goes
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:56.120]  on around here that I miss some of what's happening. Next time a former Navy
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:01.000]  Seal FBI agent, I don't care what your uncle is investigating something
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.840]  like this, we want to hear about it. I want to try to get him on. I know he's
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:07.240]  gonna get heat probably and they'll probably try to threaten him but really
[02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:12.240]  kudos to him. I mean you told me that he went and investigated it because other
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:16.360]  insiders said you need to go look at this. I guess people currently in the FBI
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:22.200]  aren't allowed to but man the fix is in so Rob do tell us about your uncle tell
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:25.440]  us about all this. I wish we'd gotten more than a two-minute interview with him
[02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:28.800]  with Badandi. Badandi did a great job. I just wish I'd have known about this. I
[02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:34.320]  would have gone up there. Halibut tried to get me to go. I just am trying to
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:37.560]  launch the TV network and the new website and everything else but I mean
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:41.960]  this is just so big and the more we look at Sandy Hook I don't want to believe
[02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:46.280]  it's a false flag. I don't know if kids really got killed but you got green
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:50.800]  screen with Anderson Cooper where I was watching the video and the flowers and
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:54.040]  plants are blowing and some of them and then they blow again the same way it's
[02:37:54.040 --> 02:37:59.640]  it's it's looped and then his nose disappears. I mean it's it's fake. The
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:05.080]  whole thing is just I don't know what happened. It's kind of you see a
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:08.240]  hologram at Disney World in the haunted house you know I don't know how they do
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:12.080]  it but it's it's not real. You take your kids to see the you know the haunted
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:15.440]  house and ghosts are flying around. They're not real folks it's staged. I mean
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:19.560]  the magician grabs a rabbit out of his head. I know he's got a box under the
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:23.360]  table that he reaches in against the rabbit. I don't know what the trick is
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:29.560]  here. I got a good suspicion but when you've got Wolfgang Halbig who was the
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:36.440]  top I mean 2020 CNN I mean ran the most successful school safety course in the
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:40.800]  country got the contract for Columbine making millions of dollars a year. He
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:45.880]  believed it was real people called him he went investigated no paperwork no
[02:38:45.880 --> 02:38:53.420]  nothing it's bull and now on FBI retired agent who retired you know with
[02:38:53.420 --> 02:38:57.520]  decorations I mean do I this is just unprecedented I can't believe I missed
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:01.000]  this recap what happened we've got some of the questions from Baddandi but he
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:04.320]  told you a lot more well we'll just tell us what he said. Sure well I first got a
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:06.840]  text from Baddandi and it was this picture that they just showed and it's
[02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:12.320]  it's a Dan standing with my uncle they just shot it so it's yeah it's right
[02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:16.600]  there and I'm like why is why is Dan Baddandi standing with my uncle for you
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:20.960]  didn't even know that I didn't know he was there no idea he was there and I
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:24.000]  called I had texted Dan I said why are you with my uncle he goes oh he was at
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:28.200]  the hearing your dad's brother I was like what so I called I called up my
[02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:32.440]  uncle and I ended up talking to him I called him that night that I got the
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:35.920]  text and he's like hey let's talk tomorrow so I called him the next day I
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:39.520]  was actually at the dry cleaner picking up stuff for to go to Bilderberg and I'm
[02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:44.000]  talking to him talk to him about 15 minutes in the parking lot and he goes
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:47.400]  I go why who told you about this why'd you go up there he said this was off
[02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:50.960]  record I don't even trouble everything that I talked about he said we could
[02:39:50.960 --> 02:39:55.960]  talk okay and and so I said well how did you why what made you want to go up
[02:39:55.960 --> 02:39:59.680]  there to the hearings this is the second hearing and he said well a friend of
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:02.640]  mine told me that I should go up there and look at it it's there's some
[02:40:02.640 --> 02:40:05.720]  suspicious stuff going on and so this is after the first hearing came out
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:09.640]  where there was all kind of you could watch the the lawyer Monty Frank is his
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:13.160]  name who also has a vested interest in keeping the Sandy Hook narrative alive
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:17.920]  because he runs a team 26 he's a cycling guy and he runs this big donation firm
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:22.040]  where they they get they run around on bikes and it's all Bloomberg anti gunners
[02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:25.240]  right oh yeah he's a big anti gunner he's a big anti gun this is about making
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:32.280]  them all you know basically torch bears for the exact victims the the martyrs
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:36.480]  right and so he is the main attorney that you'll see in the videos when we go to
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:40.840]  those he's the ball-headed guy and he was he even told some people who were
[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:44.360]  subpoenaed not to show up or people didn't show up to the first hearing
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:48.720]  because he told them not to show up and how big is subpoenaing yeah how big was
[02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:52.600]  the pain it costs like $300 to freeze one of these and why would help it stop
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:56.680]  making his millions of dollars a year make his wife mad at him and do all this
[02:40:56.680 --> 02:41:01.680]  and he had government come to his house twice and threaten him to stop yeah you
[02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:04.520]  know he's only interested in the truth he actually gave money he even admitted
[02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:07.800]  that he gave money to the Sandy Hook fun in the beginning when it first happened
[02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:11.480]  because he felt so bad about it but he keeps finding all these questions all
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:15.040]  these good it's little things but it's it's following paper trails all these
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:18.840]  bureaucracies have paper trails and it just doesn't add up and that's what my
[02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:22.200]  uncle said yeah tell us everything you said he's so I said what did you think
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:26.520]  he said well I've never sat in a court proceeding like this ever in my life I
[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:30.320]  said what do you mean he goes well he goes here's you got this small town the
[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:35.240]  biggest event in their history by far and nobody knows nothing nobody remembers
[02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:38.800]  anything and there's no paperwork for anything no I just don't understand how
[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:44.080]  this is going on in this small town and what do you mean he goes well he goes
[02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:49.200]  even he goes even when we were you know going after the mob he goes at God they
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:52.920]  would remember well God he didn't say God but I remember back in the day my dad
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:56.040]  taught he was you know working on it was God yeah well one of the guys it was
[02:41:56.040 --> 02:41:59.120]  there was a lot of different mobsters they were going after back in the 80s and
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:04.960]  in 90s I guess he retired sometime in the 90s but he said you know we never had
[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:09.120]  a case where nobody knew nothing you know he said I just couldn't understand it
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:12.680]  how in this small town nobody knows anything the school board guy doesn't
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:15.720]  know anything the maintenance guy doesn't know anything the head select
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:19.560]  woman doesn't know anything stuff is being delivered and nobody knows how I
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:23.680]  got there so this town's mascot is Sergeant Schultz essentially yeah and
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:27.880]  and there you got that that checkouts that checkouts on he thought was a big
[02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:32.400]  deal he's like well what was DHS doing there so that's the big question how
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:34.360]  are they there an hour and a half after the shooting
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:37.960]  helicopter and there's a check-in sign with porta potty's being delivered right
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:40.720]  there's the check-in sign right there there's a shot of that you can see it
[02:42:40.720 --> 02:42:44.840]  it'll pop up there everybody everyone must check in and so they ask the select
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:48.520]  woman who they say runs the town essentially her name is Pat Lodro da
[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:53.720]  Lodroa and they ask her did you do you have did you pay for this sign she goes
[02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:57.080]  I know nobody paid for this sign note nothing came out of no one knows who
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:00.720]  delivered the signs to direct everyone well they ask her the porta potty's and
[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:04.320]  she goes but no rescue helicopters and the ambulance exactly but we got
[02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:08.120]  electronic signs for everybody to check in and clipboards she goes I believe it
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:11.480]  was Homeland Security so she believes Homeland Security delivered that sign
[02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:15.520]  good god so they were already on the scene right after it happened that that
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:19.280]  let's remember they ran fast and furious killing thousands of Mexicans
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:23.200]  hundreds of Americans including six law enforcement to blame the second amendment
[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:27.800]  CBS News got the memo that was a false flag killing thousands to blame the
[02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:31.480]  second amendment and martyr Mexicans and say you're racist if you don't turn your
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:36.520]  guns in so they've done it before and my gosh they've done it again going well
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:39.960]  guys actually let's play the clip from my uncle it's actually clip number two
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:43.560]  we'll play that one first it's really short Dan I want to play it but tell us
[02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:48.720]  more what he said because you told me more than that all right well he was he
[02:43:48.720 --> 02:43:54.680]  was concerned that there because he had believed in the initial story the
[02:43:54.680 --> 02:43:58.560]  official story he said well now is that this doesn't add up if you have all
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:02.120]  these people they should just be giving the paperwork and going on with their
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:05.640]  lives if they don't want you know because right now it's all being it's 101
[02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:09.520]  they're covering up he goes nobody acts like that if they're on it's like a cop
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:12.400]  pulls you over and you're busy cramming stuff under the under the sea right
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:15.360]  saying don't don't worry hold on I'm looking for my license or whatever you
[02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:20.040]  know nobody has the the proper paperwork nobody can deliver it they
[02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:24.520]  deliver videos without timestamps from police squad cars there's videos without
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:27.360]  timestamps that they give to him say these are the copies from the squad car
[02:44:27.360 --> 02:44:31.760]  yet you go online and you can see squad car video from the same squad car and
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:35.320]  it's got timecode on it so how did they give him video without timecode and he's
[02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:39.800]  viewing it at the police station this is a mega massive cover up it's crazy so
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:44.400]  you know he just basically my uncle doesn't say much he's the kind of guy
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:49.520]  that doesn't say a lot he's just he kind of you know and so Dan I don't know how
[02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:54.200]  Dan figured out he was my uncle but he went over and and talked to your
[02:44:54.200 --> 02:44:57.680]  uncle's not telling you he's up there no no no he never told me he was going up
[02:44:57.680 --> 02:45:01.320]  there I got the text from from Dan that's all I found out he was there and
[02:45:01.320 --> 02:45:05.920]  then I I texted him and then I called him the next day because he he couldn't
[02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:09.920]  talk at the time it was like probably 11 30 at night that night it was June
[02:45:09.920 --> 02:45:14.280]  well I suggest you call him and see what he thinks now see if he's been
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:17.360]  threatened or anything but please continue with what else he told you so
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:22.920]  former Navy SEAL retired FBI agent Sandy Hook doesn't add up pretty much he
[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:26.720]  said quote that's the quote doesn't add up well we could take the quote from him
[02:45:26.720 --> 02:45:30.040]  from he said he's never seen anything like this before but to you what it is
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:35.320]  so that and then that's what and to me that what he's saying is that from all
[02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:40.200]  to his experience in the years that he has worked as an FBI agent he's retired
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:45.160]  he did he went into the FBI pretty much out of out of the Navy he was a he went
[02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:49.840]  to the Navy Naval Academy he was a Navy SEAL this guy is on the up and up I've
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:55.000]  known him all my life you know very he doesn't tell you what he does in terms
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.800]  of you know when we used to go up there and visit him when he was working and he
[02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:00.880]  would just leave and come back and you know he was doing his doing case work
[02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:05.920]  or whatever but from what he told me he said that this this thing doesn't add
[02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:09.600]  up and it's the weirdest court proceeding he's ever been in in his
[02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:12.560]  entire life and he's been in a lot of court proceedings well I mean let me tell
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:16.760]  you we get more threats over this than anything I mean they yeah they're
[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:21.760]  hiding something they definitely are let's ask your opinion your gut level
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:25.840]  without getting into the personalities involves you can clearly see they're
[02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:28.840]  scared the wagons are circled they could just release all this there is no
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:33.280]  paperwork yeah there is that's what it's all so I mean I guess totally made up
[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:37.720]  with green screens everything and we've got them on green screens I mean what
[02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:41.880]  is going on here on that's how evil these people are is that they can have
[02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:46.080]  CNN involved all these people it's like a Manhattan project of the gun
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:50.120]  grabbers Alex you you have kids if your kids go on a field trip or anything my
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:53.200]  kids if they go on a field trip to the park next door we have to sign a
[02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:57.280]  permission slip okay there's no permission slips no nothing for the
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:00.640]  Sandy Hook choir to go down to the Super Bowl so there that was one of the
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:03.880]  things Wolfgang was asking for through through the school board he's like
[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:08.640]  where where's this approved there's no mention of it anywhere like hey we're
[02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:11.120]  glad our kids went to the Super Bowl let's give him a hand let's give him
[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:14.520]  some recognition and he was at a school board meeting at Sandy Hook and they
[02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:17.440]  were talking about all this this other event that happened and they're making
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:20.840]  a big deal out of it why would they not make any deal out of kids going to sing
[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:25.200]  at the Super Bowl they're being identified on but what about how for a
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:29.600]  mass shooting in in Pakistan they got photos of Sandy Hook kids they got
[02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:34.080]  photos of one of the kids yeah that it be did is just it's weirder and weirder

[02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:47.560]  you think they're gonna try cover us up or is this gonna go anywhere I really
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:52.440]  don't know I've never seen anything like this yeah and again I wish I'm glad
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:56.240]  Baddondi was there great job and I wish it would have gone on more yeah I tell
[02:48:56.240 --> 02:48:59.640]  you my uncle doesn't talk that much and look at the look on his face you know
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:03.560]  yeah he's like hmm you know and when I was talking to him he wasn't he wasn't
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:06.400]  saying a lot but he's like you know Robert this is strange I've never seen
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:10.080]  anything like it never seen anything like it and he's been in court cases it's not
[02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:13.440]  like his friend you said he also said it doesn't add up oh yeah well yeah nothing
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:17.640]  adds up it adds up what was his exact quote was I want to put up an article I
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:20.680]  would say take that from there I was sure but even though he explains that
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:24.680]  you're a reporter right you're a news director this is your uncle it's
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:28.840]  incredible for you to quote somebody go back to the memory what did he say I'll
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:32.480]  think about the exact words but from what I'm getting from what I remember
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:35.600]  okay because I was in the car driving while I was talking to him I had a
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:39.080]  earpiece understand talking to him because I wanted to get something out of
[02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:42.280]  before we did because we did the show that night on the fourth that day on the
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:45.720]  fourth and I want to talk about it I said hey I've got this short interview with
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:48.600]  you you know and you're saying it's strange it doesn't add up he's like I've
[02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:52.720]  I've never been in a court proceeding like that ever where people don't know
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:57.080]  anything and here's the news he's up there and not telling the family yeah
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:01.720]  that's it and then somehow I don't know I guess Badani probably asked him his name

[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:08.680]  news to find out how he knew yeah and I want to make a big deal out of this it's
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:11.760]  a big deal well and tomorrow there's actually the final I guess the closing
[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:14.680]  arguments they have two hearings now now they're gonna closing arguments

[02:54:20.640 --> 02:54:26.360]  television the newspaper the post Jade Helm isn't a military takeover of Texas
[02:54:26.360 --> 02:54:29.560]  now we've already been taken over by the globalists that run the federal
[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:32.600]  government we're already having our power plant shut down and they're
[02:54:32.600 --> 02:54:36.120]  declaring patriots to the enemy and that the borders are wide open and I mean
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:40.800]  we're already under a dictatorial system and yes the Army Times reports the
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:44.040]  military is training to take on Americans we're not saying the Army is the
[02:54:44.040 --> 02:54:47.960]  enemy or the Marines are the enemy we're saying we know Posse common taught us has
[02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:51.640]  been trod underfoot these military drills are about conditioning the public
[02:54:51.640 --> 02:54:56.120]  I'm gonna get more into that in a moment just briefly they came in and told me
[02:54:56.120 --> 02:55:02.120]  first we have the idea to pre-sell the new product brain force that has a
[02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:05.440]  couple things in it that are prescription in Europe that are totally natural
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:08.920]  that are known to boost the brain's capacity not in a speedy way but in a
[02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:13.840]  healthy way we order limited amount as a test everybody loved it sold out in

[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:45.680]  tv jade helm is ticking off we're going to be launching tonight an email on
[02:57:45.680 --> 02:57:52.000]  air jade helm at info wars dot com that all our reporters are going to be
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:55.680]  checking that I'm gonna be checking and when you see military activity you need
[02:57:55.680 --> 02:58:00.520]  to call us but more importantly need to videotape it this is your country you've
[02:58:00.520 --> 02:58:05.160]  done nothing wrong marcher right up and videotape the military a lot of them will
[02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:08.680]  be in plain clothes but they stick out like sore thumbs they'll be walking
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:14.120]  around with portable radios they'll be doing all sorts of stuff and they can
[02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:19.240]  easily use this not by our military but by terror group working for the globalist
[02:58:19.240 --> 02:58:24.760]  to piggyback on a drill that simulates what the attack that actually happens so
[02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:30.040]  the terrorists get caught they won't be Islamic they can then claim they're part
[02:58:30.040 --> 02:58:34.480]  of the drill so these drills are used as cover they're really upset that we're
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:39.400]  covering it for some reason we need to be on target not just here but nationwide
[02:58:39.400 --> 02:58:43.480]  during any military activity stay vigilant wanted by land to it by see
[02:58:43.480 --> 02:58:47.240]  three of by obama tyranny
[02:58:48.240 --> 02:58:52.320]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and
[02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:55.960]  sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website
[02:58:55.960 --> 02:59:00.480]  info wars dot com because the companies I've been approached by were not the
[02:59:00.480 --> 02:59:04.360]  highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I
[02:59:04.360 --> 02:59:09.040]  refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:59:09.040 --> 02:59:14.680]  about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms HD firearms dot com
[02:59:14.680 --> 02:59:18.960]  own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs special ops people their veterans
[02:59:18.960 --> 02:59:22.600]  their patriots their listeners of the radio show and they want to support the

[02:59:53.520 --> 02:59:56.040]  show
[03:00:00.960 --> 03:00:05.920]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[03:00:05.920 --> 03:00:12.360]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network I didn't
[03:00:12.360 --> 03:00:18.440]  overdrive here here's the Washington Post from July 4th on Independence Day the
[03:00:18.440 --> 03:00:22.160]  Americans are coming some in Texas County fear and Obama led US military
[03:00:22.160 --> 03:00:26.280]  invasion so again the Psyop is when there isn't a takeover when there isn't
[03:00:26.280 --> 03:00:29.640]  martial law oh we're discredited in thousands of news articles they've
[03:00:29.640 --> 03:00:33.640]  already written thousands claiming we're saying this now for a month or so they
[03:00:33.640 --> 03:00:37.360]  didn't have that many articles there was hundreds a day for weeks now they're
[03:00:37.360 --> 03:00:46.440]  back and they interview a black Bastrop City Council person Doc Jackson we're
[03:00:46.440 --> 03:00:51.040]  gonna interview him and he says that that this a red flag that our country
[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:54.160]  still has a lot of things that need to come to terms with including the anger
[03:00:54.160 --> 03:00:57.040]  and disrespect being directed at the president and they go on to say it's
[03:00:57.040 --> 03:01:02.240]  racist hate to not just love the military everywhere running around the
[03:01:02.240 --> 03:01:06.880]  streets I mean I was exposing militarization of police and drills
[03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:11.800]  when Bush was in and no one we talked to in Bastrop said it was about black
[03:01:11.800 --> 03:01:14.920]  people they don't like Obamacare your races don't want to turn your guns in
[03:01:14.920 --> 03:01:19.840]  your races they inject this into everything to say you're basically a
[03:01:19.840 --> 03:01:27.280]  heretic if you don't go along with it and the article basically says that it's
[03:01:27.280 --> 03:01:30.840]  racist and we believe in imminent invasions happening this is why mainstream
[03:01:30.840 --> 03:01:34.520]  media is in so much trouble and it's why people don't believe you because
[03:01:34.520 --> 03:01:38.120]  everyone reading this that participated knows you're a liar and everybody else
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:44.080]  that watches media and reads it knows not to believe you that's why national
[03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:47.840]  polls people don't trust Jade Helm they go too far because they don't believe
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:53.400]  anything you do anymore and that's healthy because the Pentagon admits they
[03:01:53.400 --> 03:01:58.120]  want to be ready to take out civil unrest in America and they're gearing up
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:01.480]  for it and people know we're in a recession slash depression they know
[03:02:01.480 --> 03:02:05.680]  unemployment's higher than you say they know you're a pack of liars now let's
[03:02:05.680 --> 03:02:09.600]  go to the Washington Post TV piece that's separate from this article here
[03:02:09.600 --> 03:02:13.680]  it is the US military will soon launch a mission in which it operates among the
[03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:18.040]  US public and travels from state to state in military aircraft in the
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:23.160]  exercise Texas Utah and a part of Southern California are labeled as enemy
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:27.400]  territory New Mexico isn't considered much friendlier that's the scheme for
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:33.000]  Jade Helm 15 a new special operation exercise that begins in July the Army
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:36.560]  says the size and scope of the mission set it apart for many other training
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:41.640]  exercises also setting it apart the widespread conspiracy theories that the
[03:02:41.640 --> 03:02:46.080]  United States preparing to hatch martial law that is especially so in Texas
[03:02:46.080 --> 03:02:50.640]  which was labeled as hostile in military briefing slides prepared for local
[03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:54.920]  officials Texas governor Greg Abbott even recently called for the Texas State
[03:02:54.920 --> 03:02:59.400]  Guard to monitor the mission the military has tried to tamp down speculation
[03:02:59.400 --> 03:03:03.360]  about Jade Helm but the conspiracy theories have persisted because of a
[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:08.400]  handful of websites that say not to trust the military or the media and ramp
[03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:12.280]  its speculation online this is part of the Psi out look at what they say
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:16.800]  unconventional warfare is it's going in and using deceit to try to control the
[03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:25.640]  people this Jade Helm 15 logo this has a satanic hidden meaning Helm means
[03:03:25.640 --> 03:03:33.880]  homeland eradication of local militants oh no you don't oh no you don't here we
[03:03:33.880 --> 03:03:38.720]  go again folks what do we begin to see here behind the Walmart in Texas
[03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:43.760]  Humvees this is in preparation for the financial collapse and and maybe even
[03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:47.560]  Obama not leaving office now here's what we know is true the military
[03:03:47.560 --> 03:03:52.080]  routinely launches exercises in which regions of the United States are labeled
[03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:55.720]  as hostile for the purpose of training only last few years back decades at the
[03:03:55.720 --> 03:04:00.120]  very least among them is bold alligator a naval exercise
[03:04:00.120 --> 03:04:04.160]  thousands of Marines and sale as congressman Gohmert said he was in the
[03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:08.720]  military and he's on the committee they've never done this this is new it's
[03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:12.080]  very suspicious we're not saying it's imminent they mix a bunch of folks
[03:04:12.080 --> 03:04:15.480]  speculating and the telltale signage you're hearing three-second clips from
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:19.840]  us mixed in with other people so you think it's us saying it I mean just
[03:04:19.840 --> 03:04:24.640]  another Psi up Psi ups don't work when people don't buy them anymore punk let's
[03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:29.080]  go back to punk's video the most recent version was launched in the fall and
[03:04:29.080 --> 03:04:33.200]  included amphibious landings to fight insurgent groups in the fictional
[03:04:33.200 --> 03:04:37.720]  country of garnet Georgia and part of Florida in real life then there's Robin
[03:04:37.720 --> 03:04:42.760]  Sage us special forces support fictional guerrillas and counties across North
[03:04:42.760 --> 03:04:46.120]  Carolina totally different a soldiers work to liberate the country of pine
[03:04:46.120 --> 03:04:50.560]  wind the number of 50 years millions six months from now jade helm will likely
[03:04:50.560 --> 03:04:54.440]  fade from discussion that's it for now though so that's their plan and when
[03:04:54.440 --> 03:04:58.080]  none of this bad stuff happens they'll say we're discredited it's a strong man
[03:04:58.080 --> 03:05:11.600]  they're full of BS
