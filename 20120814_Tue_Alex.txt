[00:12.080 --> 00:32.920]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.920 --> 00:40.800]  well we've got a big kahuna of a transmission for you today strap yourselves in it is the 14th
[00:40.800 --> 00:47.920]  day of August 2012 I'm Alex Jones your host and we are going to be live here for the next three
[00:47.920 --> 00:54.560]  hours at least and coming up one of our favorite guests chronicling the insanity of the collectivist
[00:54.560 --> 01:02.400]  class and the crony globalist that sit perched on top of it Lou Rockwell will be joining us
[01:02.400 --> 01:07.280]  coming up the third hour we will have open phones for the balance of the transmission
[01:07.280 --> 01:12.400]  including when Lou Rockwell is on with us so I guess the whole thing but the first two hours
[01:12.400 --> 01:20.400]  and then with Lou Rockwell as well wow yesterday we reported on the 1.4 billion rounds of 40
[01:20.400 --> 01:28.240]  caliber and other calibers purchased by the Department of Homeland Security they bought 250
[01:28.240 --> 01:33.920]  million rounds last year about five months ago they bought 450 million rounds they're buying 750
[01:33.920 --> 01:39.120]  million rounds buying up many calibers but 40 is the main one that that that was announced last
[01:39.120 --> 01:45.120]  week we reported on yesterday now our story today is the top right hand linker at least it was 10
[01:45.120 --> 01:52.400]  minutes ago at drudgereport.com national weather service in huge ammo buy the weather service
[01:52.400 --> 02:03.760]  uh is uh buying buying a whole bunch of ammo uh on top of the 1.4 billion uh just for the
[02:03.760 --> 02:13.440]  department of of Homeland Security itself so we are going to be going over that today
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.560]  and I'm going to discuss the fact that we are already under martial law
[02:18.560 --> 02:24.320]  when the IRS can take your bank account with no due process when the TSA
[02:24.960 --> 02:31.040]  can grope your wife and your children in front of you uh when drones are attacking foreign
[02:31.040 --> 02:36.480]  countries outside of international and national law when the president tells congress that the
[02:36.480 --> 02:42.800]  UN and NATO are over them when the government is publicly funding al-qaeda and saying that gun owners
[02:42.800 --> 02:47.440]  and libertarians and returning veterans are the number one threat when Obama's talking about
[02:47.440 --> 02:53.200]  signing executive orders to restrict guns and take over the internet when they're putting
[02:53.200 --> 02:59.200]  smart meters on our houses that spy on us and that can go on and on and on that's what you
[02:59.200 --> 03:06.240]  associate with a authoritarian system all over the country they're running police and military
[03:06.240 --> 03:12.960]  and dhs and combos of those checkpoints okay unless you're in a civil emergency declared by the
[03:12.960 --> 03:18.320]  governor or the president and in case you didn't know that's martial law when the governor says
[03:18.320 --> 03:22.560]  i'm declaring a state of emergency that's that's martial law boys and girls that's how they have
[03:22.560 --> 03:26.560]  the troops patrolling around an area as wall fires or whatever or people are looting a city the
[03:26.560 --> 03:30.720]  military shows up problem is they usually end up looting because they're under federal command
[03:31.600 --> 03:37.520]  that's called martial law uh they don't use that name like if somebody hits you in the head that you
[03:37.520 --> 03:41.600]  you could call it being assaulted you could call it being mugged if somebody hits you in the head
[03:41.600 --> 03:48.000]  with a tire and you know to rob you it's robbery mugging uh armed robbery assault deadly weapon
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.440]  you give it lots of names yeah i'm calling an assault with a deadly weapon with intent to rob
[03:54.880 --> 04:01.280]  intent to commit felony you could call it being mugged if you like but why debate semantics back
[04:01.280 --> 04:07.040]  and forth here so no i'm not saying martial law is coming in october late late october early
[04:07.040 --> 04:13.440]  november i'm saying we're already in it and in the news and in police sources we have you've heard
[04:13.440 --> 04:19.760]  them call in but i have them off air and where i'm talking to the cop face to face senior police

[08:56.400 --> 09:02.000]  hours and we are going to be covering massively important news lou rockwell ron paul's former
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.840]  chief of staff and of course the head of the von mies institute is going to be joining us
[09:07.840 --> 09:19.040]  coming up in the third hour today here are just some of the headlines right now at info wars
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.760]  dot com and prison planet dot com an article that paul watson and i have been working on for the last
[09:23.760 --> 09:36.160]  week is now up by alex jones and paul watson rome burned will we rome burned will we we're going
[09:36.160 --> 09:41.920]  to be reading over some of that article coming up in the next hour national weather service
[09:41.920 --> 09:47.760]  follows department of homeland securities purchase of 1.4 billion rounds of ammo in the last year
[09:47.760 --> 09:55.520]  the latest purchase 750 million rounds with its own massive purchase of firearms ammo
[09:56.640 --> 10:05.920]  the national weather service that's right 12 gauge 308 223 40 cal 9 millimeter sig
[10:06.560 --> 10:12.400]  everything they need every agency arming in a lustful hate of the people because they all
[10:12.400 --> 10:18.640]  know their collaborators working for foreign banks continuing faith deals scan your face for
[10:18.640 --> 10:25.280]  customized deals this is how the gulag prison casino works as we predicted many years ago
[10:25.840 --> 10:31.920]  and max keiser many others have broken down you will go into a store and to waive your rights
[10:31.920 --> 10:35.760]  and be face scanned to buy and sell this has always been the plan
[10:35.760 --> 10:47.600]  you will waive your rights and then because you waive your rights you will be given a discount
[10:47.600 --> 10:53.120]  that's ahead of everyone having to face scan to buy and sell that's why the british government
[10:53.120 --> 10:58.800]  is saying it's a sign of terrorism if you're not on facebook and they're now encouraging
[10:58.800 --> 11:03.520]  people on facebook to upload their friends and family on there even if they're not members
[11:03.520 --> 11:10.800]  remember what they had a facebook called his users that trusted dumb bleepers
[11:12.080 --> 11:16.720]  now you heard about new york launching this new homeland security funded system that london
[11:16.720 --> 11:21.600]  and berlin and other major cities already have its face scanning software hooked into all the
[11:21.600 --> 11:28.320]  merchants who are later given tax exemptions if they wire in but it's the tens of thousands
[11:28.320 --> 11:33.120]  of cameras government runs and the hundreds of thousands of cameras within shops and without
[11:33.120 --> 11:39.120]  running face scanning license plate reading and other classified systems infrared prints
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.760]  they're also running behavioral quack scans so they can you know basically have lots of little
[11:45.760 --> 11:49.920]  lights going off inside the command centers you know saying people are terrorist
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.640]  this is the new system so that when you go in a store those cameras hanging up in a walmart
[11:56.640 --> 12:03.120]  or a target or even the mom and pop they're all wired in live time and everyone's gonna
[12:03.120 --> 12:08.880]  want to do it because you go in and facebook recognizes and you have your little iphone
[12:08.880 --> 12:14.240]  your little digital slave tracker or your little droid it pops up with a message in fact we have
[12:14.240 --> 12:19.120]  the video we'll play in a moment with audio as they're promoting this a little message pops up
[12:19.120 --> 12:27.200]  up and says oh you're going to get a discount on that drink that jack daniels in this particular
[12:27.200 --> 12:33.680]  case and of course what's happening here is they're they're associating with party party
[12:33.680 --> 12:39.680]  get the implantable digital angel microchip six years ago and get into the topless bars
[12:39.680 --> 12:49.760]  cheaper in miami and fort waterdale and madrid and london get into the upper vip champagne lounge where
[12:51.520 --> 12:58.000]  little susie does a number on you it's really prostitution go in the private champagne area
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.400]  and close the drapes but to get into the champagne area to see little susie you've got to take a chip
[13:04.400 --> 13:11.840]  oh it's so much fun party party party party and they're not going to ask in the future
[13:13.360 --> 13:17.360]  that's why they have gun buybacks worldwide they admit it the image of people lined up
[13:17.360 --> 13:23.040]  turning guns into police and the news reporting on it like guns are illegal and billboards
[13:23.040 --> 13:28.640]  showing revolvers and handguns saying report illegal guns to create the perception that's why
[13:28.640 --> 13:32.960]  they hate it when you do open carry which is legal and lawful almost every state and city
[13:32.960 --> 13:37.760]  and county in this country except for a few crime boss driven areas like new york and chicago
[13:37.760 --> 13:42.800]  they want to convert the rest of the country to their model that's why the police used to arrest
[13:42.800 --> 13:48.240]  people for even a rifle in their car it's to create that illusion that we're not allowed to own guns
[13:48.240 --> 13:55.280]  but we're overthrowing that illusion but this technocratic grid with google now demanding
[13:55.280 --> 14:00.160]  your phone number your information your email all sync to your name if you're going to have
[14:00.160 --> 14:06.800]  any type of google account google blog youtube so they can then turn you off from the web
[14:06.800 --> 14:13.120]  if they claim you get three strikes we just had this happen with one of our videos they put a
[14:13.120 --> 14:20.640]  strike on it or put a copyright claim on it saying that my voice is not owned by me
[14:21.920 --> 14:29.120]  and claiming that some english record company now owned my voice the english record company said no
[14:29.120 --> 14:34.880]  we didn't mean for your your bots to say you owned alex jones's voice it's an error youtube
[14:34.880 --> 14:43.360]  removed the claim of their fraudulent bot and put a strike against us so proved we were right
[14:43.920 --> 14:51.760]  removed the copyright claim but then gave us a strike and we for community guidelines of deceptiveness
[14:52.880 --> 14:58.800]  and so we appealed it and instantly the message came back before that person looked at it we always
[14:58.800 --> 15:04.960]  had these overturned and said no we stand by this well i've got you now and i know you're a big
[15:04.960 --> 15:10.640]  monolithic nsa fronts you pretty much have immunity but i'm very busy launching a bunch of stuff
[15:10.640 --> 15:14.160]  right now but we know you're moving towards suspending all our big channels that reach
[15:14.160 --> 15:20.400]  hundreds of millions a year so publicly i'm letting everybody know that i'm going to have to get in
[15:20.400 --> 15:25.520]  touch with the electronic freedom you know foundation the electronic frontier foundation
[15:25.520 --> 15:29.920]  i'm going to have to get in touch with a bunch i mean i know law i know deceptive advertising
[15:29.920 --> 15:35.120]  false trade practices i mean google's in trouble stealing people's passcodes wireless snoop systems
[15:35.120 --> 15:39.840]  it's not to don't be evil front and oh their guys play ping pong all day and drink beer that's their
[15:39.840 --> 15:44.800]  pr front uh like warren buffett eating ice cream cones you know oh look i eat ice cream cone i'm
[15:44.800 --> 15:49.920]  non-threatening or all this pr where bill gates is superman wanting to save you they talk to you
[15:49.920 --> 15:56.800]  like your children you advertise it as an open community commons where if you follow these rules
[15:56.800 --> 16:01.520]  your stuff can be up there we give you the content i send people off prisonplanet.com
[16:01.520 --> 16:07.600]  and info wars.com and all my other big outlets i send it yeah there's the examiner covering it
[16:07.600 --> 16:11.440]  alex jones channel target of determination by youtube see it's it's already making the press
[16:11.440 --> 16:15.840]  because it should we should all hang together hang separate you advertise this i go follow your
[16:15.840 --> 16:22.720]  rules i say hey don't don't put a copyright claim on us my i've got to defend my voice
[16:23.360 --> 16:28.400]  and the voices of my guest suddenly we're getting copyright claims when i have joe rogan on
[16:28.400 --> 16:33.920]  that's not his intention i'm getting him with other guests suddenly they're saying they own our
[16:33.920 --> 16:41.120]  voice i say hey you don't own my voice i never signed my voice away you can only do a performance
[16:41.120 --> 16:46.640]  invite sign a contract which i haven't if they said it was a spoken word they could copyright
[16:46.640 --> 16:52.320]  and put a computer block on that speech but now they're saying no no no alex your voice
[16:52.320 --> 17:00.880]  is being brought down do you understand how big this is so i'm forced to start the wheels in motion
[17:03.440 --> 17:08.080]  and people can look at the court records i've said to sue people five times before i don't
[17:08.080 --> 17:12.720]  want to have to go perfect to suit make sure i'm going to win or be close to winning they'll go do
[17:12.720 --> 17:16.800]  it you think jesse ventura was happy to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars suing the feds
[17:18.000 --> 17:25.280]  for the tsa it you've got to do it because they're setting a precedent where they say
[17:25.280 --> 17:31.280]  you're deceptive they don't say what it is that's deceptive you get one line to respond we said
[17:32.720 --> 17:34.800]  we are not being deceptive in the video you removed
[17:34.800 --> 17:43.360]  it was a false copy right claim against us we made a video about it you remove the copyright claim
[17:43.360 --> 17:49.360]  but banned our video gave us a strike we are contesting this and they responded back within
[17:49.360 --> 17:53.680]  minutes meaning no one actually read it it was automated now saying well i actually have the
[17:53.680 --> 18:00.560]  letter right here here it is all going in the legal file but the real court is public opinion
[18:00.560 --> 18:04.160]  we're going to put google on trial i've already been doing it but we've got to really show all
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.640]  the crimes they're committing not just not you're not just acting like they're a free speech out for
[18:08.640 --> 18:13.680]  fit with with uh false advertising and then and then doing this and slandering me calling me a
[18:13.680 --> 18:22.640]  deceptive liar that's what the the the notice said your video is deceptive and a fraud and a scam
[18:23.520 --> 18:28.320]  really really i'm a fraud and i'm a scam is that why you took the copyright claim off
[18:28.320 --> 18:33.760]  that's going to look real good in court it's going to look even better in the newspapers google
[18:35.520 --> 18:38.880]  while i flail around talking about everything you've been which i'm already doing but i'm
[18:38.880 --> 18:43.920]  going to make it my business my business to come after you and go ahead and de-list as you've

[25:18.240 --> 25:24.160]  a homeless pretty job that's what they respect not our listeners but a lot of people they do i mean
[25:24.160 --> 25:29.920]  they love the sycophantic worship of tyranny because they love being passive aggressive with

[26:16.080 --> 26:24.560]  oh it's so the head of facebook likes me he's nice see that's why the stock dropped by more
[26:24.560 --> 26:29.360]  than 50 percent since it opened and was a known pump and dump that's why he dumped his stock up
[26:29.360 --> 26:36.400]  front too but they sent they sent martha stewart to prison for no reason because she's low level

[38:54.560 --> 39:02.880]  hundred for fifty dollars that means fifty cents per 48 page right now big bold white
[39:03.920 --> 39:08.320]  newsprint slash magazines like a big you know tabloid size let's be tabloid content you know it has
[39:08.320 --> 39:12.800]  that big one big page that opens tabloid style and then later i'll tell you right now we plan to
[39:12.800 --> 39:18.000]  have a monthly glossy magazine and then we're going to have a weekly newspaper that hammers out
[39:18.640 --> 39:21.280]  people are going to be able to have subscriptions to just get one every week
[39:21.280 --> 39:27.920]  uh or one every month at first or you can order for fifty dollars at cost it comes down to fifty
[39:27.920 --> 39:33.040]  cents a piece which is i want to keep it at that it looks like it's going to be a little bit above
[39:33.040 --> 39:37.680]  that because printing it's like thirty cents and after you put everything into it but hopefully
[39:37.680 --> 39:43.040]  the advertising will carry us over the edge it's up to you uh you know we build it will they come
[39:43.040 --> 39:48.560]  obviously so they're zigging to shut down print prints really dying because nobody wants to read
[39:48.560 --> 39:54.480]  establishment bills that's why even establishment online media is crumbling in front of everybody
[39:54.480 --> 39:59.280]  the only thing that's popular is is establishment stuff that uses user content like youtube
[39:59.920 --> 40:04.000]  and now they want to curtail and control that they don't let you really share videos anymore
[40:04.000 --> 40:11.680]  they're knocking sites down all over the place uh and if i hadn't filed a bunch of times with youtube
[40:11.680 --> 40:15.600]  we wouldn't have the big alex shone's channel with 230 million views that feeds all the others
[40:15.600 --> 40:18.720]  see what's happening on youtube the reason they're starting to censor us and we'll get into all the
[40:18.720 --> 40:24.480]  other news and your calls is now they've they've they've censored and curtailed and done some
[40:24.480 --> 40:30.160]  algorhythms and don't let us share our even our subscribers don't get our videos even though other
[40:30.160 --> 40:38.320]  subscription systems do so they've they've they've put some um what do they call it in formula one
[40:38.320 --> 40:45.120]  race cars the the uh call was a formula and he was a race car driver so you'll know call call
[40:45.120 --> 40:50.000]  Richard Reeves in here what's the name of the plate the repressor plate that they put in the car
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.720]  so you don't go 800 miles an hour and kill yourself so now it's so scientific that you're
[40:54.720 --> 41:00.240]  basically the cars restrict your plate there you go yeah yeah restrict your plates there you go
[41:01.200 --> 41:06.000]  they're putting restrictor plates on us i mean they can already hit a button and erase all the
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.720]  videos on youtube with my voice on them claiming that they own my voice they're trying to set the
[41:10.720 --> 41:19.200]  precedent so i challenge the companies that do this out of the blue and now eight separate times
[41:19.200 --> 41:23.680]  i've gotten them to stop trying to shut our channel down claiming they own my voice well now
[41:23.680 --> 41:28.320]  these youtube's came back and said we own your voice and we're going to shut you down because of
[41:28.320 --> 41:35.360]  that and if you try to uh block us we're going to shut you down so uh people like we'll just leave
[41:35.360 --> 41:40.000]  youtube folks our stuff is on every video site out there about half the video views in the world
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.520]  are on youtube the google took over google buys everything like microsoft buying skype they they
[41:45.520 --> 41:50.720]  buy everything because they want control they want a monopoly and so that's where the fight is
[41:52.320 --> 41:56.240]  that's where we're going to fight them we're going to expose them it's all i mean sure
[41:56.880 --> 42:02.960]  i actually had numbers pulled up on it we're getting eight percent of our traffic
[42:02.960 --> 42:14.800]  from youtube on info wars.com that is that is not a big deal in fact we did the numbers
[42:14.800 --> 42:19.440]  i had them do the numbers this morning we send more traffic to youtube than they send to us so
[42:19.440 --> 42:26.640]  let's get that straight info wars.com prisonplanet.com our gigantic websites the biggest alternative
[42:26.640 --> 42:30.960]  media sites out there other than drugs it's much bigger than us and it's a phenomenon
[42:30.960 --> 42:39.360]  we're sending youtube traffic we use youtube because they've got reliable systems that can
[42:39.360 --> 42:44.000]  be spread out there and that's where the fight is that's where the young people and others are
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.760]  that's where new audiences are but we're giving them a lot more than they give us and we've asked
[42:49.760 --> 42:55.520]  for a partner channel and been denied now imagine on the cover of dozens of magazines

[43:18.320 --> 43:23.120]  example of making your own media on and on and on and on profiles and you name it
[43:23.120 --> 43:28.960]  and websites getting over a million visitors a day over 115 radio stations stress reel
[43:28.960 --> 43:33.680]  xm 166 top ratings and cities where they put us on up against rush limbaugh
[43:34.640 --> 43:42.240]  beating him time after time and youtube does not want to give us a partner channel fine
[43:45.440 --> 43:48.400]  they have wanted to place ads on our vint channels and we've told them no
[43:48.400 --> 43:56.480]  no the point is is that they're scared of us that's why we're there we're going to continue

[44:54.560 --> 45:00.000]  watch all this because yes they've taken obama deception down three times with false claims
[45:00.640 --> 45:06.080]  they've hacked it and youtube restored it after we made a big hullabaloo you did they've done
[45:06.080 --> 45:11.280]  everything they can ladies and gentlemen we're reaching around let's be conservative i did
[45:11.280 --> 45:16.000]  another analysis last night i said seven to ten million it's more than ten million now a week
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.120]  because here's what's happening i'll get into other news i'm kind of ranting about the future of
[45:19.120 --> 45:27.840]  the web everything here's what's happening there are so many channels now carrying my daily radio
[45:27.840 --> 45:34.160]  show slash tv show three hours and so many youtube channels carrying the nightly news that
[45:34.160 --> 45:40.160]  that there's so many channels that have thousands of views per video some of them
[45:40.160 --> 45:46.000]  like 50 000 100 000 that's how i know there's some type of uh restrictor plate on this because
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.240]  most people that are subscribers are just you know quarter million subscribers i even promote
[45:50.240 --> 45:55.280]  that channel subscribers but the main feed channel we got a bunch of others they're not
[45:55.280 --> 46:00.400]  getting their videos but other channels that are carrying our stuff are getting the subscribers
[46:00.400 --> 46:04.560]  and everybody's getting them so you'll have smaller channels with say 10 000 subscribers
[46:05.200 --> 46:10.720]  getting 50 000 views per video more than we're getting so that we've gone around the restrictor
[46:10.720 --> 46:18.240]  plate so what they're doing is they're now going in and setting the precedent to ban my voice so
[46:18.240 --> 46:23.760]  i mean obviously i'm gonna have to sue google and it's it's big it's hard to fight i'm gonna i'm
[46:23.760 --> 46:30.640]  putting the feelers out to the expert lawyers right now but i mean this is for everybody listen
[46:31.520 --> 46:38.080]  eight years ago i sued the city of austin and access television and i won the director went to
[46:38.080 --> 46:42.000]  prison it went all the way up to the top of the city they shut it down time warner was not able
[46:42.000 --> 46:48.320]  to take it over and shut down access tv i i i even quit doing a show but i went and saved access
[46:48.320 --> 46:56.480]  television because it's personal folks when mafia tries to shut us up access tv where it was started
[46:56.480 --> 47:02.080]  in austin 35 plus years ago it started here in austin access tv is still on three channels on
[47:02.080 --> 47:08.960]  basic cable in austin because i sued them and i went and developed the case did it all and that
[47:08.960 --> 47:15.520]  fleshed them out that got them in fighting and i went and recorded them once i started the suit
[47:15.520 --> 47:19.840]  it caught them and i said i've got to prove you're stealing money and then they told on each other
[47:21.040 --> 47:26.480]  the point is is that we're going to get google and we're going to get facebook
[47:27.360 --> 47:33.200]  the head of facebook needs to go to prison for knowingly pumping and dumping that stock
[47:33.200 --> 47:39.440]  to a bunch of suckers that he's openly called suckers we're going to expose the crux in homeland
[47:39.440 --> 47:44.960]  security and the perverts we're going to expose the pedophile ring that goes into homeland security
[47:44.960 --> 47:50.240]  out of penn state we're going to just expose you all you're a bunch of maggot knuckle dragon
[47:50.240 --> 47:56.640]  scumbags who want to feed off us and build your empires off our energy and then throw us into the
[47:56.640 --> 48:03.840]  dirt and it ain't happening anymore now they want to get everybody on the cash flow societies they
[48:03.840 --> 48:08.880]  can charge you five dollars to use your atm like bank of america or they can track everything you're
[48:08.880 --> 48:14.720]  doing so everybody's got to go to cash even though it makes it hard for me with tax writeoffs
[48:14.720 --> 48:18.880]  and stuff i'm stopping using credit cards everybody knows i take people out to dinner or
[48:18.880 --> 48:26.240]  something around paying cash then you just turn the receipt in stop using credit cards as much as you
[48:26.240 --> 48:32.720]  can i understand sometimes you've got to use him but it's time to keep cash ladies and gentlemen
[48:32.720 --> 48:39.760]  because imagine they're coming out with face deals cameras that just mirror the pentagon system going
[48:39.760 --> 48:43.600]  in nationwide that's already tracking what you buy itself they're just rolling it out getting
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.920]  everybody used to it where these idiots are going to opt into this and say my goodness
[48:47.920 --> 48:53.120]  they just offered me 30 off on this liquor yeah because that liquor company is paying kickbacks
[48:53.120 --> 49:03.760]  to facebook that's how these programs work could be used by shops to offer discounts to customers
[49:03.760 --> 49:10.160]  system already being trialed in national shops and bars users must sign up to take part in the
[49:10.160 --> 49:16.960]  teach system what they look like yeah you opt in to let them war game and computer
[49:17.840 --> 49:22.240]  i've noticed to keep our facebook they demand our driver's license they've demanded just
[49:22.240 --> 49:26.800]  and we've done it just to stay in the enemy's operation but i'm like somebody parachuting
[49:26.800 --> 49:34.080]  in behind enemy lines you don't want to be on there folks okay you do not want to be you've
[49:34.080 --> 49:40.480]  got everybody has got to get off facebook because it is a criminal enterprise at every level for the
[49:40.480 --> 49:46.880]  globalist run by the banksters we've broken it down i mean it is absolutely horrible yes we're
[49:46.880 --> 49:58.000]  on there using it to attack them now they're going to get rid of cash this way are you hearing

[50:20.640 --> 50:24.800]  and those preachers are reading off a script that their denominational heads were given by the
[50:24.800 --> 50:30.080]  government these are not churches these are like the churches they allowed to stay in effect in the
[50:30.080 --> 50:37.040]  soviet union and they're all out there saying alex is going to go to hell i see him online

[55:07.440 --> 55:16.720]  everybody can hear me hey a dawn bro do me a favor red link Rome burned will we thanks new new uh
[55:16.720 --> 55:24.480]  speaker system we uh we have here so we're going to be going over all that I mean the magnitude
[55:26.000 --> 55:31.520]  of face scanners when you go into Biden's shell and then harassing you that's why they have
[55:31.520 --> 55:39.120]  discount cards at stores those discount cards are not there to give you a discount those
[55:39.120 --> 55:45.200]  discount cards are there those loyalty cards the discount cards are real the loyalty cards aren't
[55:45.200 --> 55:49.680]  they're there to track you and decide what people absolutely must buy so you can raise
[55:49.680 --> 55:55.520]  prices and manipulate people and sell the data now something like info wars rx that is a coupon
[55:55.520 --> 56:00.240]  card and the stores want it because they're associating in it but cards where it's only
[56:00.240 --> 56:05.280]  working at one place those are different see the info wars rx card you can put any name you want in
[56:05.280 --> 56:10.560]  there the point is it's just that card and that number you get the discount it's just accessing
[56:10.560 --> 56:16.240]  specials nothing wrong with coupons and things like that it's this stuff that tracks you ladies and

[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:25.200]  minus 60 minutes fAA documents show drones over us pose huge safety risk those have now been leaked
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.280]  out by the center for investigative reporting yeah how they've almost crashed into a bunch of
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:34.000]  passenger airliners have crashed caused highway shutdowns when i saw this drone out over the
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.160]  highway the other day everybody was slowing down and pulling off i was like what is that i guess
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:45.840]  that's the whole point of the acclimation uh we'll also get into the the paul ryan selection again
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:50.480]  they could have picked somebody worse than paul ryan but he did vote for the banker bailout no
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:55.040]  child left behind him and india a but yeah they could have picked somebody worse somebody like
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:02.000]  mitt romney could be the vp oh but he'll be the president i forgot for a semi auto bands
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.280]  government run health care carbon taxes abortion i'm just i'm supposed to just be happier than a
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:13.440]  see here's my concern obama if he tried another term would get impeached over fast and furious
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:18.320]  and a bunch of other issues and you'd have tea party you know type conservatives that are better
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:24.560]  than obviously obama get in there but when you watch when romney gets in everything's going
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.440]  to get blamed on him now the globalist agenda it'll all just keep moving forward and the republicans
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:35.040]  will probably lose the house of the senator something and then you'll have you know romney
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.960]  will work with the democrats we're going to be in deep trouble just mark my words
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:44.720]  mitt romney gets in there suddenly people aren't going to be concerned about attacks on the second
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:50.640]  amendment open borders it'll be like oh but at least he's not nancy polosi that's what democrats
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:55.520]  do it's like all obama's torture and in secret arrest and corruption and banker bailouts as well
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:02.000]  and shutting down at one third of our power plans but you know that's all right at least he's not
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.560]  george w bush these guys are puppet frontman what's your take on that we're going to come back
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:12.800]  take a bunch of your phone calls and get into a ton of other news but um

[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.520]  day for everybody on youtube but i don't know how long as they try to ban our channel i mean
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:58.800]  i can only fight them so long um just be up to you but again if they censor my channels they're
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.800]  going to get all the other channels carrying it and and that was the good news i was covering
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:07.040]  last hour even though there's certain censors trying to shut us down everybody else is posting
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:13.040]  it now and the show is so hot in the free market of youtube even with the restrictor plates they're
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:19.280]  putting in that we're just totally dominating i did this morning about 30 minutes with a calculator
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:28.960]  just counting yesterday's videos and the channels carrying them and just adding up 15 or so channels
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:40.480]  that carry our stuff it was massive compared to our channel but again it's very exciting i mean
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:47.840]  it we're i say 10 million it's i've done the math it's it's it's way more than that and i can't even
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:52.480]  count up all these channels that's gotta have the system really worried and i'm glad they are because

[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:22.000]  money manager and granhardt who in november of 2011 made the decision to cease operations of
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.800]  a brokerage firm and return funds a bunch of other people did that too they had a tyco and others
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:35.520]  to her customers citing systematic problems with the entire financial industry has issued a new

[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:47.440]  accounts you remember three or four years ago a whole bunch well accelerating last year a whole
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.520]  bunch of big money managers worldwide said i'm done i'm out including george soros
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.040]  guys it's over i know that many of you are still
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:04.560]  caloring and normalcy bias unable to build the reality unable to face the world as it is but
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:09.680]  you have got to snap out of it the marketplace is destroyed you cannot be in these markets
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:15.920]  all legal protections are now officially gone and the article goes over the court rulings
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:21.360]  so uh we're going to be breaking that down and tying it in with are the u.s government and big
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:25.840]  banks quality preparing for an imminent financial collapse now again we're already in a control
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:32.240]  collapse we're already in a recession leading into depression they've been given us cook numbers
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:37.600]  government is gearing up with checkpoints everywhere in 1.4 billion rounds of ammo total
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:43.600]  and uh national weather service buying ammo that's top story at dredgerport.com our report from
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:50.480]  info wars.com and drones launching everywhere and military buildups and face scanning cameras
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:56.000]  going up to buy and sell everywhere i mean this is all happening black boxes going in the cars
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.080]  the globalist engineered a fraud to consolidate control and bring us into it
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.800]  and that's why we've got two key articles at info wars.com today and in info wars we've gotten
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:13.360]  to where we can handle a million and a half two million people hitting the side on peak days but
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:20.000]  today is particularly big so the site is a bit slow we're just getting bombarded with traffic we
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.040]  may have to turn the comments off because that's uh the point is is that info wars is up if you see
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.680]  it go down go to prison planet that's why we got prison planet it's a backup not really a mirror
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:34.720]  because it's got some news that info wars doesn't have but a brief history of false flag attacks
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:41.200]  or why government loves state sponsored terror big article by curtain ammo ahead of the season
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.280]  when they could stage terror attacks i'm just telling you we're in the prime zone rum burned
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:52.960]  will we and alex jones paul watson article key uh national weather service follows dhs in huge
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:12:02.480]  ammo purchase face deals scans your face to customize deals that's just some of the reports
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:08.960]  that are up on the site is dhs preparing for civil unrest with massive ammo order they admit they are
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.600]  i mean they've got local police department's nationwide training with the military for it
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:19.680]  i mean this isn't just some plan like rex 84 they're putting hundreds of billions into this this is
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:24.640]  government is digging in like world war three is about to start and mike they're menacing the
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.200]  russians the chinese and again i'm not saying the russians and chinese are good they're big corrupt
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:37.360]  governments as well we're run by crazy bankers we'd already been in giant wars if top generals
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:44.960]  hadn't refused and admirals over and over again all right i said i'd go to your phone calls it is
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:53.520]  just wall to wall craziness i'm going to get into all this and a lot more uh today again info wars
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.240]  is still up but curtain ammo cannot even post new articles right now we're locked out of it so he's

[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:30.320]  people that want to take over and just basically wipe us all out one thing i want to discuss with
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:38.480]  you about is this have you been to the website called the coming attack dot com no there there's
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:45.760]  a there's an article on there where before the november 12 before the november 2012 election
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:53.680]  obama is going to stage a false flag assassination attempt against himself to incite racial wars
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:59.120]  so dhs can uh basically go with him to a report so he can declare martial law
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:06.880]  indefinitely shutting down the november 12 2000 election it's all up there on coming the
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:12.240]  coming attack dot com no i know i mean we yeah i'm i'm looking at it we are our whistleblower
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:19.760]  broke that news uh months ago that his dhs source uh was saying that
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:26.000]  that and i do remember that but listen here's the deal and i appreciate your your your question
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.920]  do you have any other questions uh yeah the thing that you were just talking about earlier about
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.920]  russia and china also on that same website it shows that uh it talks about russia and china
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:45.120]  they basically making a super pack and basically attacking the united states after obama declares
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:52.160]  martial law yeah no i appreciate your call uh one source in dhs saying that does not make world war
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:15:00.560]  three and giant false flag attack um you know i've had hagman and others on that are breaking that
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:07.680]  down the preparations are all happening there's already massive crises happening you've got all
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:14.160]  these white house advisors saying that they want a staged event to be blamed on their political
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:20.560]  enemies but we're always looking for them to call it martial law when the tsa is sticking their
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:25.520]  hands down you and your wife and your children's pants that's martial law when big mega banks
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:30.800]  can get unlimited trillions from congress that's tyranny when the president tells congress that
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:38.400]  the un in nato is in command of the president and not congress in in in in in the area of war
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:46.960]  that's martial law that's dictatorship when the dhs can ship guns into mexico and get caught and
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:54.720]  not get in trouble that's tyranny i mean there are so many countless examples of this that just go on
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:01.840]  and on and on and then you know we have sources that end up being confirmed in mainstream british
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:06.320]  news that they were telling the security guards we will have a terror attack well they always tell
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.360]  them that just to expect it and we go okay you're saying this but i don't think they'll be an attack
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:15.440]  i said i didn't and it's like alec you said they're being attacked and then now we've got all these
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:19.920]  dhs people saying they're told something big and late october early november that doesn't mean it's
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:24.160]  going to happen but yeah they're telling police departments this it's come out in the news they're
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.640]  saying look for something big and late october early november we've had police call in and
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:33.760]  break down crying wild tanks are rolling around major cities like st louis and they're being told
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:40.240]  this in the briefings but it doesn't mean it's going to happen just like the white house got caught
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:45.840]  under bush putting out fake terror alerts they admitted later for political gain it doesn't
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:51.200]  just saying there's going to be the attack is a form of stage terror so it doesn't mean this
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:56.320]  is going to happen because i guarantee you if we expose this and back it off and then there isn't
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:01.840]  a terror attack because you expose it i expose it others expose it then it'll be oh you said
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:07.600]  there'd be a terror attack in late october early november no i said they're gearing up for civil
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:12.320]  unrest nationwide and telling the banks get ready for collapse and that's all in the news
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:17.840]  and they've got regular army and marines rolling around all over the country running real check
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:22.560]  points and they're rolling tsa out on the highways and they're doing all of this and
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:29.200]  they're telling you the nsa is spying on you without warrants that's illegal but they say
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:35.360]  they're doing it under an emergency they they use any crisis they can real or manufactured to take
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:43.440]  our rights so that's the answer to your question i um you know i had the folks on from the northeast
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:48.560]  intelligence group they're interesting he's a private detective has a pretty good record he has
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:55.680]  a dhs source told him that and then a whole system got built up around that around his source saying
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:01.600]  he'd been told that look i've got the army manuals everybody always focuses for whatever reason on
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:08.480]  one source instead of dhs manuals preparing for civil unrest gun confiscation
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.520]  coordinating of cities arrest of political dissidents
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:21.760]  reeducation camps the army is publicly this stuff is public we write articles with links
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:27.200]  to army dot mill with reeducation camps gun confiscation and no one wants to talk about
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:34.400]  it or cover it but somebody says hey um i have a dhs source that said obama's planning a false
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:40.800]  flag around the election and it's katie bar the door that's all i ever hear about when the real
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:51.680]  meat and potatoes 100 are on your plate no debating this is already a tyranny it's criminal
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.040]  to train the military to arrest citizens and put us in reeducation camps
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:01.920]  it's illegal to train the military for gun confiscation nationwide this latest army
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.320]  scenario where they're going to have to fight the tea party insurrection that's going to link up
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:14.800]  they predict this is a war game prospectus i'll find my knob here for my audio changed everything
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:21.360]  around here you know that's what we're talking about here and it's just so frustrating i mean
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:27.920]  i'm glad to call her called in about that it's just that we have the civilian inmate labor camp
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:34.560]  program we have we have the emergency centers establishment act admitting all the camps how
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.120]  they're set up and no one ever wants to touch it people just want to say i think this is a camp i
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:43.360]  think that's a camp i mean what do you mean they got the end i say listen to everybody

[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:17.360]  everybody keeps looking for some big event and that certainly could happen
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:24.960]  the point is government is gearing up with our tax money to oppress us and to start wars with other
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:33.760]  countries meanwhile the washington free beacon is reporting silent running russian attack
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:41.920]  submarines sailed in gulf of mexico undetected for weeks u.s official say and it goes over
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:48.640]  this report yeah i mean the globalists are so busy trying to dominate the united states i mean
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:57.920]  obama is shutting down right now one third roughly of the u.s power plants a foreign enemy
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:01.760]  with with b-52 bombers couldn't do that
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:09.040]  they're shipping our jobs overseas they're globalists ladies and gentlemen
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:13.280]  once they bankrupt this country they get to take control of it posing as the saviors
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:18.480]  it is elementary and if you think a asset stripping globalists like mit romney's going to save you
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:26.320]  good now obama is so radical he might stage something and stay in that's what happens once
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:31.360]  his system gets so corrupt it allows different parts of the power structure to go for everything
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:41.040]  so anything's possible now at a gut level i'm less scared of mit romney and hall ryan
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:49.200]  but my gut also tells me if obama stays in office stuff's going to get so bad
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:53.440]  it's going to bring it to a head you know sometimes you got to have a bad fever to get well
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:26:01.520]  not just get mit romney who's kind of obama light in there and will only make conservatives and
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.760]  libertarians go back to sleep kathleen in ohio you're on the air welcome
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:16.000]  uh yes hello alex hello i i just wanted to mention about cyber space and just a personal
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:24.800]  experience i had about it being shut down incrementally um we have d uh we have dsl service and
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:31.360]  you know for about three years i've been getting these letters from our provider at&t saying switch
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:39.280]  to the fiber optics switch to uverse and etc etc but i only have an internet and a landline so i
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:45.600]  didn't need the tv and the cable and all that and it was almost double what i pay but then last weekend
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:52.560]  our dsl signal went out for three days and we took the modem over to the at&t people and they
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:59.760]  pretty much convinced us to switch to this uverse this more i don't know exactly i have a i i actually
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:05.520]  sure it's television everything over one system but they gave us a price just for the internet
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:12.320]  service and the telephone and um i just as i was talking to the gentleman there i said you know i
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:20.960]  i do research online i'm i'm a music um teacher and i write music i post youtube videos with my
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:29.520]  music videos and what i've noticed uh in the last you know since probably 2008 2009 although it was
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:37.840]  probably happening before then is that the internet is becoming completely dumbed down and he said well
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:45.040]  well if you're a public internet user and and i thought and i never heard that before public
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:49.360]  internet and i said what what do you mean by that and he said well you know if you're part of a
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:57.200]  business or a corporation or part of a university they have very very highly sensitive and highly
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:03.760]  organized router systems that will let you delve deep into information but for a public
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:10.960]  person like yourself you really don't need to know too many things and i said well well but wait
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:17.520]  a minute what who's who's to decide that and he said well it's not a need to know basis yeah well
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:23.440]  that that person um under cyber security which they're already phasing in even mainstream news
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:29.520]  admits it's the putin model of censorship internet id so they can ban you from the web tax you trace
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:36.720]  you all of that they're getting even small level ip people into cyber security programs and give them
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:42.080]  a little card and the power trip that they get on and so i want to tell everybody who you know the
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:47.120]  cops all of you that have access at the higher level to all this data and get to spy on everybody
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:52.240]  you're dehumanizing yourself but yes uh they've tried to hire all the dentists my dad knows to
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:56.960]  spy on their patients they're trying to i mean they're they're hiring spies everywhere like we're
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.800]  doing something wrong you know they're doing something wrong they're the criminals in the
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:06.560]  system so they want to watch us to try to suppress us from ever getting control of our country back
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:13.360]  but yes this is the power trip of the people that are on the internet too as they call it they're
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:19.680]  going to start shutting down the old web and only letting establishment types on the quote new internet
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:27.840]  and that's always been their plan and they've stated that and uh i mean most people preachers you

[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:11.920]  to cease operations of her large brokerage firm and return funds and george soros and a bunch of
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:17.040]  others have done that too to her customers citing systematic problems within the entire
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:22.640]  financial industry has issued a new warning about the stability of us banks and the safety of
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:29.120]  individual deposit accounts the warning stemming from a recent federal appeals court ruling
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:34.720]  surrounded customer funds lost during the o7 collapse of chicago futures broker sentinel
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:39.120]  indicating that individuals who lose deposit funds because the financial institutions and
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:43.520]  properly manage the money even if those funds are supposed to be segregated from other
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:48.720]  operations of the firm are essentially left with no recourse in the firm goes belly up according to
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:56.800]  the court and it goes on to break down that a misallocation of customer funds is not on its
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:02.560]  own sufficient to rule a matter of law sentinel acted with actual intent to hinder delay or
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:08.960]  defraud its customers and this is what you've seen with mf global she goes on to say guys it's over
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:15.120]  i know that many of you are still towering and normalcy bias unable to deal with reality unable
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:20.560]  to face the world as it is but you have got to snap out of it the marketplace is destroyed you
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:26.160]  cannot be in these markets all legal protections are now officially gone yeah these companies
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:30.000]  if you're in the stock market and the brokerage business they can just take your money that you
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.160]  put in the account you know your pile of chips anytime they want they go you know what doesn't
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:39.440]  matter you're winning the poker game just give me all those chips or a franco behind you is going
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.720]  to break your thumbs but franco didn't need to break your thumbs to get your chips you're like
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:50.960]  i paid for these chips my money i put in the you can you know if i lose the bet you get what's out
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:57.200]  there on the table but they take your money and it's going to be the same thing with the banks
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.480]  and again i'm not trying to destroy confidence i've seen the math the globalists are gearing up for
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:08.720]  a police state takeover they don't deny that while imploding the world economy and while making all
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:14.560]  these preparations for total control and having our government sign on to their derivatives that
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:21.280]  are impossible to pay back you see instead of just letting the globalists go under we're letting
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:26.480]  them hold this hostage and and i don't know what we do about this i don't know what we do but i'm
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:31.680]  not here waiting for martial law even though the police and military i talked to say it's going to
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:39.040]  happen something big we're getting we're telling us get ready to protect city hall in the rich
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:45.200]  neighborhoods in in late october early november i don't i don't know what that is do they think
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:50.160]  people are going to riot of obama loses i don't think that's the case but you know the justice
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:58.800]  department they got caught down there with the trayvon martin thing trying to stir up local
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:02.560]  groups turned out they were provocaturing it they want us fighting with each other
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:09.360]  could it be race war stuff could it be the new war with iran the stuff in syria i mean there's
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:16.000]  a lot of crazy stuff going on right now the people that run our country are in a proxy war
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:24.320]  through nato and al qaeda with the russians right now in syria my point is they told the big banks
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.800]  over the weekend make preparations for the government not to help you during collapse you're
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:34.880]  going to have to fend for yourselves you got the government buying 1.4 billion rounds of ammo in the

[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:44.720]  by the on top of that by the national weather service
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:54.880]  now theirs is a lot more modest compared to 1.4 billion by the other departments but
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:00.480]  this new solicitation is for 16 000 rounds of 40 smith and wesson jacket at hollow point
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:10.240]  illegal to use in war i should add a further 6000 rounds of smith and wesson jhp will be sent to
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:15.520]  wall new jersey with another 24 000 rounds of the same bullets heading to weather station in st
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:21.600]  petersburg florida yeah the the national weather service needs 24 000 rounds of ammo at one office
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:26.560]  and it just goes in mentioning all of the uh departments i mean they are gearing up for
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:30.640]  out and out war with us because they work for the foreign bankers

[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:28.720]  health in this country if we want to defeat the globalist we have to understand they're using
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:34.560]  medical tyranny against us but to get us into that globalist controlled system they want to make us
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:40.160]  unhealthy the globalist spike our water with sodium fluoride and they admit it causes massive
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:46.880]  increases in bone cancer brain damage and reduced iqs the gmo crops have all been directly linked
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:53.600]  to reduced fertility deformities in mammals across the board the globalists in these school
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:42:00.640]  lunch programs feed children absolute garbage fast food is full of chemical additives things like
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:07.520]  silicone we are all under attack because when we're operating from a healthy position of good
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:15.840]  food natural food clean water and the nutrients and trace elements we need our minds will be on fire
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:21.280]  the powerful creative human destiny will be unleashed now i want to tell you a very important
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:27.840]  story going back about a year and a half ago i began to learn from friends like teta anderson
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:33.200]  about the incredible health effects of young jevity products and i started promoting him
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:37.920]  some because i've seen his weight loss his health all the things that happened for him
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:42.800]  and by the way things like beyond tangy tangerine and polymers plus are not even
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:47.760]  advertised for weight loss it's just that when you take it you are getting the minerals and
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:54.480]  vitamins you need from an original plant form and so you're full because the main crops that are
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:43:01.840]  grown on these debilitated plate out soils are not giving you the minerals and vitamins you need
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:07.200]  so you eat and you eat and you eat and get raw calories that pack on weight and that burn out
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:12.960]  your different glands and cause things like diabetes when you finally start getting the
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:17.680]  minerals and vitamins and trace elements you need it is incredible now i've only stuck my
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:24.320]  toe in the water and lost a little over 40 pounds and i'm still big erin dykes who you know has
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:30.320]  been working here for six years at info wars dot com lost 92 pounds we're going to show you
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:35.360]  some before and afters he began to hear the guest on my show a year and a half ago he began to do
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:42.080]  his own research and he implemented the information that young jevity and info wars team dot com is
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:49.040]  promoting and had dramatic results and that's why i'm telling our listeners and viewers you need
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:55.600]  to go to info wars team dot com and try just the essential fatty acids the beyond tangy tangerine
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:01.440]  and the pollen burst plus and i believe you'll be blown away by the dramatic results that i've had
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:07.440]  and erin said erin break down what happened your story i've been overweight in my life for far too
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:13.120]  long years ago i lost a lot of weight more than 50 pounds but it came right back i wasn't able to
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:18.720]  keep it off more recently i've worked really hard with diet and exercise to try to lose weight but
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:23.120]  i just didn't get the results it just didn't happen and i wasn't able to stay motivated long
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:27.760]  enough to reach my goals then i saw what you were doing with info wars team dot com and the great
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:32.720]  products tangy tangerine kind of the base one to start with i wasn't even trying to lose weight
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:37.120]  but i got it because i wanted to feel better energy i wanted that nutrition didn't even understand
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:42.720]  how that could kick start my own weight loss goals but the products did that for me i found myself
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:47.920]  suddenly losing weight more energetic wanting to exercise wanting to eat the right foods and they
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:52.320]  don't even advertise it as weight loss they don't but it but but but pharmacist ben kukes explains
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:55.200]  that's what happens if you're overweight because you're no longer hungry because you're getting
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:59.600]  what you need it was a perfect storm because it was giving my body the nutrients it needs it it gave
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:05.120]  my body the things it needs to seek out first which made me not have to crave after other things
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:11.040]  that i don't need that don't even provide nutrition and what's crazy is this is not advertised as
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:16.480]  weight loss the company never even promoted it we just discovered it's the ultimate weight loss
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:21.840]  tool not only is it incredible that the info wars team dot com products were hidden in blame view
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:25.600]  but that there's no teleprompters here you know erin you want to endorse these products because
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:29.600]  everybody on air has seen the amazing transformation they've seen me lose quite a bit of weight but
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:35.200]  i haven't totally committed to it like you have and we're here just telling people the effects
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:40.240]  that it's had for us and by the way just a week and a half ago i said you know what i want to lose
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:46.400]  the next 40 pounds because doctors have told me i need to lose 80 pounds i have a hernia it's not a
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:51.120]  hyenal hernia it's it's in my belly button and they told me they said you need to lose about
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:56.960]  80 pounds you'll have to have surgery and i've lost 40 i need to go the rest of the way so week
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:01.920]  and a half ago i said you know what i'm not used to just taking pills all day taking vitamins all
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:06.720]  day drinking drinks all day yeah i do one tangy tangerine one polymers today a couple of essential
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:14.240]  fatty acids not now i'm doing the whole regimen and i've lost seven pounds in a week and a half i'd
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:19.040]  lost 42 i quit doing it because i've never been in the habit of doing this gained a few pounds back
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:23.520]  and now raised seven pounds a week and a half we're going to see what happens here with alex
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:29.280]  jones folks because i'm fully committing i'm taking it all i'm doing it now breaking this down it's
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:34.640]  not just the weight loss it's also energy it's so many other things erin it's like this alex our
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:39.440]  world's become centralized the people who have taken over the food supply have tried to give us
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:44.240]  fillers so they can go for you know the greatest number of people being fed these junk foods and
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:49.520]  everything else when you take this nutrition you're giving your body the little codes the little
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:54.880]  fats the little signals it needs and when the body gets that it responds to it right away that's why
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:47:00.000]  it works it's really just feeding it in the formula you need so then you're not seeking out food you
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  don't really need and it makes things like emotional eating a lot less likely as well and i found
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.160]  pizza cravings and things like that went away when i took the essential fats when i had the
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:14.960]  tangy tangerine you have that base nutrition so you're not always looking for nutrition and foods
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:19.440]  where you're really not going to find it anyway in many cases i think organic foods and stuff like
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:24.400]  that's really important as well but this was a total transformation when i was already eating
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:29.840]  organic foods already trying to work out and already trying to change my life but this really
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:36.160]  let it happen when people actually try this they are blown away when they find out that when you
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:42.320]  start taking their proprietary formulation of essential fatty acids that blows the competition
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:48.080]  away when you start taking beyond tangy tangerine and polymers plus and the other key longevity
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:56.640]  products it is incredible but you've got to continue taking it but the body is so starved
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:02.320]  for nutrition by design by the globalist i mean they've engineered this so that we become these
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:07.280]  these self-propelled stomachs always seeking food because we're looking for the vitamins
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:14.560]  the minerals the trace elements this has the mighty 90 in it the human body needs 90 vitamins
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:21.760]  minerals and trace elements to work in fusion together and the system knows this so i challenge
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:28.080]  you check out the incredible products at mfallwarsteam.com use them and if you don't see incredible
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:34.320]  effects i will be shocked because everyone i talked to who has used these is sold on them
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:39.440]  you've seen the effects on alex jones you've seen the effects on aaron dykes the system
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:46.560]  knows about high nutrient diets they've done studies where mice and other rodents can live
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:53.280]  twice as long or even longer in some cases when they're given super high nutrient diets
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:59.920]  but it is not available in most of the foods out there we've actually been lied to for decades in
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:04.880]  our lives maybe our whole lifetimes for a lot of people because we're told to eat a certain way
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:10.480]  we're convinced by television and other advertisements of how to live our life it's all wrong and when
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:14.880]  you just read about the nutrition you realize how powerful it is you realize this is what we're
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:20.160]  meant to take that's the stuff you find in tangy tangerine and young jevvie products and it was so
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:26.000]  easy that's the most incredible part it was so easy to lose weight and regain health for myself
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.680]  barely without trying just for taking the products we're here promoting what we believe in what we've

[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:20.560]  your calls and news but i started promoting these a year and a half ago and thought they were good
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:25.840]  vitamins and stuff but saw what aaron had happened but my mother had happened so now i'm fully behind
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:32.240]  it as you know and here are my essential fatty acids i'm going to take two of these now and again
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:40.880]  you're hungry just take their proprietary blend of that with the rabble rouser the uh
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:44.880]  polymers mix would be on tangy tangerine and i'm good

[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:37.120]  the headline be erin dykes info warrior loses 92 pounds with vitamins and mineral secret vitamin
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:42.560]  vitamin and mineral secret or seek you know the secrets because it is the secret they don't want
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:49.200]  you to know vitamin and mineral secret you know uh key to weight loss i mean i think that's the
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:56.080]  headline and it's all hiding there in plain view all right i'm done ranting about it we produced
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:01.680]  that video we wanted to do the before and after shots i mean i'm still a little bit chubby folks

[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:10.080]  pounds you should look a little chubby not really standing up but sitting down yeah i've still got
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:16.320]  a bit of a belly no i lost 40 pounds 40 plus gained about 10 back just because i forget to take the
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:22.320]  stuff i already just said that in the video didn't i the point is it really works info wars team

[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:38.000]  to some of the other big top stories dealing with election 2012 and more uh tray in south carolina
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:44.480]  thanks for holding her on the air hey alex how you doing um i wanted to touch on a couple things uh
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:51.760]  uh mainly right now it's something i noticed but in the past few days it's i don't really watch too
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:57.920]  much television but um when i do i guess after you're awake it's so easy to catch everything yeah
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:04.000]  it's cartoon level brainwashing all anti-fan i mean it would be like a movie made 50 years ago
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:08.400]  of people watching tv in a future police state this is what the tv would look like
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:15.040]  and that's that's exactly what i wanted to touch on um i guess after you're awake and you can see
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:21.280]  it it's so blatant that they're what they're putting out there for you and it's it's really
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:27.040]  disgusting um i'd i'd actually a fellow info warrior that's right across the street from me
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:34.560]  and we hang out quite often and he showed me this movie and i mean this this is basically a blueprint
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:41.120]  of what you talk about of how the cia works and uses patsies but um and the messages in this movie
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:46.800]  are just ridiculous if you if you're awake and you can see past everything and it's a movie called
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:52.720]  rampage and it came out back in 2009 and i don't i don't know if you've seen it but if you have you
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:54:00.320]  instantly be just you know i mean don't found it at what they're putting in this movie yeah and all
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:05.280]  these young people they're trying to hire the cias basically tripling its size right now they're
[01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:10.400]  being picked to be patsies and idiots and morons and useful idiots and you have the criminals on
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:16.720]  top laughing at all the patsies below them i mean it's all a big joke it's all about compartmentalization
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:22.640]  it's all about using patriots who go on these dangerous missions and get killed if you want to
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:30.720]  know how they set people up watch mark walberg's the shooter that film is so accurate compared
[01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:35.120]  to real events and things that have happened that i've i think i've even told the producer
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:40.320]  when i saw that a few years ago i uh i want to get the producer of that film on if we can
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:46.400]  i bet money they're a listener because you know some films have propaganda in them and we who are
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:50.160]  awake see them and think oh they're warning people no no no they're targeting people that
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:57.520]  are unconscious and conditioning them but some films like the shooter oh that's made by patriots
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:04.880]  that that is one of the only wholesome good message films i have ever seen in modern history
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:09.680]  out of hollywood in fact guys look up who produced that i want to give them kudos right here i should
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:16.160]  be some evil person i i forget but uh but listen i've met with a lot of big hollywood people and
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:22.480]  they say look we're awake we know what's going on we can't get our stuff through the through the uh
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:28.160]  you know big uh production companies if we don't play ball it doesn't matter how good the script
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:32.800]  is how many actors are lined up for it and then the department of defense comes in and demands
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:37.440]  stuff be putting things even if their stuff isn't being used what type of things are in the movie
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:47.520]  well um basically it's attacking uh i guess a guy guy he makes rant on youtube and he's talking
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:55.200]  about how basically what's wrong with our world and the ego has been taken over and his best friend
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:56:02.240]  has been ordering you know supplies you know swat gear basically and the plot of the movie is
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:07.280]  this guy just randomly goes out and just starts killing people on the street i mean for no apparent
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:12.960]  reason yeah we'll see humans humans when they're unconscious are social animals and and they know
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:18.880]  this i mean if you showed famous people jumping off cliffs other people would go do it immediately
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:24.320]  uh if you have i mean they tell women it's sexy you get abortions some women like to get pregnant
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:29.360]  and have abortions believe it or not you can look that because it's so cool to do it uh it's like
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:36.080]  some gay men like to get hiv because they're called bug chasers even rolling stone has talked about it
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:41.040]  where they'll go out and try to find someone who has hiv and in a weird religious ceremony they
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:46.320]  describe it you know like a religious ceremony they go give me the give me the bug make me cool
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:51.920]  uh they have arms legs chopped off to be trendy i'm not joking that mutilation is getting real
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:57.200]  popular so yeah they have lots of movies with mass shooters who are mentally ill people see that and
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:02.320]  then go out and become mass shooters go ahead and that's that's yeah exactly what we were pointing
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:07.120]  out while watching the movie i was telling my friend that he's he's well awake and listens to
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:12.880]  your show too but at the very end of the movie like i said they he basically set up his best
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:19.360]  friend to be the patsy and he does get away this is the actual shooter and it two years later after
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:24.960]  the fact of all that happening his message he posted the video after he gets away and he posted
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:29.440]  the video at the end of the movie and the end of the like the message at the end of the movie
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:35.520]  is talking about he basically says there are too many people on this world and you know we
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:40.880]  need to depopulate and that's why what's going on sir it's everywhere it's everywhere i appreciate
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:51.280]  your call uh great points uh and tony is that how you pronounce it anton facula suddenly can't
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:58.080]  read anything anton facula attended west virgin university in morgan's town west virginia on
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:02.800]  atlantic scholarship or basketball he studied electrical engineering are you sure this is the
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:13.600]  director of that movie anton facula so he just came out of nowhere and made this film well no
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:18.160]  wonder i don't know how i got it made i bet mark walberg's a patriot i can just tell you about real
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:22.160]  he's a great director as well and again i don't want to meet famous people just because they're
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:27.360]  famous i want to meet with mark walberg because he's a great director he's made some really good
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:31.680]  movies and a great actor and he's obviously a patriot and i guess he liked it so he let a
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:37.360]  director who didn't really know and do it so there you go anton facula did uh shoot her

[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:31.680]  get to you i appreciate you holding go ahead uh you're on the air john hey alex how you doing
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:36.480]  good hey i was watching uh ken bernard's documentary on the civil war the other day
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:41.600]  day and in the in the documentary they talked about the two economies the union economy and
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:45.200]  the confederate economy and they said the union economy was strong because the green bag dollar
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:50.240]  was backed by gold they said the confederate money their economy there was all printed out of
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:55.920]  sand air they said pretty soon inflation took off in the confederacy and uh and the riots broke
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:00.720]  out into major cities and they said jeff davis had the uh the divert troops from the war to put
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:07.680]  down the riots in the cities jefferson davis yep and uh now we have that same money and the banks
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:11.520]  have signed us on to hundreds of times what we owe but we're not supposed to be upset about that
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:17.520]  we're in a free country just let the tsa fondle you basically we got confederate money in our
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:23.440]  wallets right now stuff them back in it yep and uh and the globalists are creeping towards the
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:28.400]  exits but we're not supposed to point that out john that's fair mongering and you gotta remember
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.000]  there's a reason they're getting ready now is because the reason they had to put down the
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.760]  riots back then they know what's coming that's why they got the all the the military everything
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:42.080]  all geared up ready to go that's right brother and only exposing them will make them not accelerate
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:47.200]  the implosion uh the question is is it too late for even the globalists to stop what they've put
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:54.160]  in motion great points merlin um hello mr pendragon good to have you on the show with us from
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:03:01.920]  washington welcome uh yes i say i was listened to your guest yesterday yes on taxes yes sir
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:10.400]  and um and anyway i didn't i didn't have an opportunity to uh ask my question but i was
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:18.160]  i was concerned about social security uh where does uh where does the social security money
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:24.160]  go to um that we pay in uh it's gone that they it goes into the general fund they have i o u's
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:31.520]  and another fund just digital money but they spend it all faster than it comes in now it's
[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:37.760]  is it spent the same way as taxes or uh actually the social security money does end up getting
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:43.840]  spent on uh government function strangely enough at least part of it the the the income tax portion
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:48.400]  though all goes to interest on the debt because the bankers get interest for the right of us
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:53.760]  just to have fiat currency so it's even worse than a fiat currency it's a debt based for every
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:04:01.600]  dollar that's created we go into debt to the banksters hmm so i guess there's not much we can
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:08.720]  do about it right now right well sir exposing a fraud will bring it down um we're in a lot of
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:14.240]  trouble we're morally bankrupt um we've been taken over they've set up a paramilitary group
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:19.520]  against us but we're trying to wake up those enforcers um not because we can't beat them
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:24.720]  militarily that's part of the globalist plan we don't want to have a civil war in this country
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:29.520]  we want to try to turn things around what do you say well that's that's for sure i'm part of the
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:36.880]  baby boom generation and i'm i'm concerned about uh you know social security for that's what this
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:42.080]  implosion is all about is is making sure you don't get the money you paid in and uh they're gonna
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:48.160]  you're gonna end up getting your money it's just gonna be devalued that's the problem if we continue
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:52.880]  on this course because we're not bankrupt because of social security we're bankrupt because of the
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:58.080]  globalist and their Ponzi schemes and their derivatives but if we keep on this course you're
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:08.240]  gonna not get anything if you want an american company with american products made by americans

[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:23.040]  weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity

[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:34.960]  and we are back live ladies and gentlemen our story is on the right hand side a top story of
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:42.000]  drudgereport.com keep saying right hand side it's on the left hand side of drudgereport.com
[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:49.040]  and it deals with the fact of the national weather service in huge ammo purchase
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:09:00.080]  now i talked about the fact that noah controls the fisheries office of law enforcement
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:04.800]  and we've had guests on about how they're harassing surfers on the west coast and telling people they
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:10.720]  can't have jet skis in the water now and all the rest of it for the marine mammals and they're
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:15.760]  harassing people with boats you name it so i said hey i bet it's going to them they're sitting
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:23.600]  up to the west coast the east coast this is on top of the 1.4 billion rounds of ammo
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:32.720]  that the federal government has purchased last year 250 million last year 450 million five
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:43.040]  months ago 750 million last week but as usual they're countering us and listen to this the
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:49.600]  washington post national weather service ammunition solicitation triggers confusion
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:56.960]  and we're going to go to our guest noah says there was a clerical error in the fed biz ops
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:03.440]  announcement stating that the national weather service requested ammunition the solicitation
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:09.920]  actually originated from noah fisheries office of law enforcement yeah 15 to 25 000 rounds per
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:16.080]  office that's listed there not the national weather service see bottom of post for more details
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:19.840]  yeah but it's under the national weather service it's not a clerical error they've always got to
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:24.880]  play a game to change the subject there's 1.4 billion rounds this is on top of that
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:30.480]  original post whether forecasting or preparing for war the national weather service
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:39.360]  seeks to buy 4600 or 46 000 rounds of ammunition for semi-automatic pistol says fed biz website
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:45.920]  in a solicitation head scratcher of explosive proportions well no it's not that the irs just
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:50.400]  created a huge swat team info wars the website of libertarian talk show host hey they actually got
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:56.480]  it right alex jones because usually if there's a republican in i'm a hardcore communist the news
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:01.840]  says because i don't like the republicans or if there's a democrat in i'm a right-wing extremist
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:07.280]  no i'm just a constitutionalist libertarian freedom lover he goes on info wars the website of
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:11.600]  libertarian talk show host alex jones says the ammunition being ordered is designed to cause
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:19.280]  maximum organ damage and it goes on to quote us so again now the national weather service is
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:23.920]  responding to the washington post and drudge report picking up our story uh that's a good
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:30.160]  place to start with lou rockwell of lou rockwell dot com author researcher runs the very popular
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:36.000]  lou rockwell dot com they have an article out about licensing of gardens and lemonade stands
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.560]  in this great free nation we live in and he's an american libertarian political commentator
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:44.880]  activist proponent of the austrian school of economics and chair of the louis van miis institute
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:52.560]  he was also ron paul's congressional chief of staff and he joins us right now to break all of
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:57.120]  this down some of the news stories on the site today blaming guns and other inanimate objects
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:03.920]  80 million zombies wrecking the Arab world promoting crime in schools get your money out now ron paul's
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:10.880]  defense is against the state religion the ghost of joe mccarthy paul ryan's principles saying no
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:17.760]  to government loyalty of the crown of self-control who killed the limbaugh the limberg baby they wreak
[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:21.200]  havoc on your health that's a few good articles ought to ask him what those are all about even though
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:26.240]  i've read a couple of them today and link to them at info wars dot com he he joins us now uh looking
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:34.480]  at this uh lou what do you make of uh checkpoints everywhere tsa on the highways everywhere warrantless
[02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:41.200]  checkpoints uh tsa grabbing people's laptops and downloading the contents police doing it the general
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:47.680]  unfolding police state drones all over the place i videotaped one last week in austin flying around
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:56.560]  surveilling things uh and 1.4 billion i keep saying million 1.4 billion rounds of ammunition
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:02.160]  purchased in the last year i looked it up that's about 10 times what dhs purchased in previous
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:08.960]  years uh what are they getting ready for blue rockwell well alex of course that's what is that
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:15.600]  more than four bullets per person in this country they they're worried uh they're worried about
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:21.200]  insurrection because as the the government as the government keeps getting more and more
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:25.920]  controlling whether you use your talk about everything from the fisheries to the highways
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:32.560]  to schools homes businesses churches uh charities uh they're taking more and more control and of
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:37.280]  course as the government gets bigger it gets worse it gets morally worse and the people who rise to
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:42.880]  the top of the government are become even worse they become even more monstrous and so they want
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:47.840]  more and more control this is what they live for they love uh take doing this to people they love
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:51.920]  crushing people they love killing people it's why they love wars so much besides all the money that
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:57.280]  may so they they're they but they also get more paranoid they're constantly afraid that you know
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:00.800]  they're sort of like fleas on a dog and they're always afraid that maybe the dog's going to
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:07.440]  scratch them off so they arm themselves and they have you know all these armored swat teams every
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:13.760]  government agency has got armored swat teams as you so correctly point out uh so the government
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:18.080]  is our enemy i mean i think that's what we have to realize these people are not getting all these
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:23.760]  bullets to quote unquote defend us or protect us or the rest of the myths that they put out in
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:30.320]  washington uh it's to hurt us if we don't obey so that's what they're afraid of uh and then and
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:35.200]  they're going to continue to turn the screws um so this is of course what we all fight about
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:40.480]  this is what you fight against every day me too and uh so many other americans are not
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:45.600]  willing to put up with this stuff that bothers the people in government and uh they turn to
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:51.600]  violence whenever we think of whenever we think of the one they love you use the word tool you
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:56.880]  know they always talk about their tool kit they want another tool uh the tool is the gun uh so
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:02.560]  that's their one and only tool uh whether you refuse to pay or maybe forget to pay your library
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:07.440]  fine and then you sufficiently resist paying the library fine they claim to write to kill you over
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:12.480]  not paying your library fine and of course everything else that they look at any document the government
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:18.560]  has you sign it's menacing it's predatory uh they threaten to put you in jail over anything
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:23.920]  this is a very nasty institute they behave like the mafia because they are the biggest mafia well
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:28.800]  don't criticize it at least the mafia gives us products that people want to buy voluntarily
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:34.640]  i think the government's far worse than the mafia uh far more nasty far more vicious murdered
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:38.640]  infinitely more people than the mafia i guess you're right no you're right government killed
[02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:45.440]  or the university of hawaii study 262 million people in the 20th century not counting military
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:49.840]  deaths or deaths by military i mean that's more than anything i mean government's more deadly
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:54.240]  than cancer well you know people we think i was thinking dick cheney showed this but they're all
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:59.600]  like this they like killing people you know they like sending in the predator drones obama must
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:04.880]  enjoy that maybe he does it over his uh serial in the morning signs the death order gets a kick
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:10.080]  out of it people the people who rise to the top in government like killing other people
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:14.560]  that's a you know it's a tough thing for the normal person of course would never in a million
[02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:19.680]  years want to kill anybody else but the people who rise to the top of government are killers
[02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:24.160]  they're looters uh they're very bad people of course that's what our founding fathers said and we tried
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:29.040]  to follow their system and it wasn't perfect but it created more wealth than any other nation ever had
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:32.720]  four percent of the world's population we had more than half the wealth
[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:38.000]  now as the liberty goes out the door like oxygen our prosperity is going out i want to pull back
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.960]  and look at the big picture and then i want to get into paul ryan ron paul a whole bunch of articles
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:50.160]  drones with lou rockwell uh the icon from lou rockwell dot com but first i want to go to the fact
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:55.760]  we have an article out at info wars dot com today rome burned will we by the way lou rockwell dot
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:59.440]  com is always welcome to carry in of our stuff if you want we'd be honored but i want to get
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:03.440]  your take on this i know you've written and talked about this the parallels to the united
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:10.720]  states empire and rome uh give us your own historical and economically studied perspective
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:15.680]  on rome burned will we well you know there of course and this is something that the
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:20.480]  you mentioned the founding fathers they were very very aware of the in many ways sought to emulate
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:25.600]  the heroes of republican rome and were very much concerned about what happened when they
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:32.400]  went to develop into a vicious empire so yeah i mean it it there are parallels and not that
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:41.120]  they aren't exact but uh with empire comes corruption comes destruction comes economic destruction
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:46.640]  comes poverty and comes the fall so it happened to the british it happened to the romans it
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:51.040]  happened to the egyptians the assyrians the babeloneans of being go down the list of all the
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:56.560]  various empires and they typically go out as ron paul always points out for economic reasons not so
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:01.920]  much they lose militarily first they lose economically then they lose militarily so here we
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:08.000]  have the u.s which uh you know despite all the wars it wages uh is not very good at them uh it
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:14.160]  has like a gigantic world war two style military they can handle the guys with ak-47s in afghanistan
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:19.360]  who've got you know no drones no planes no tanks you know none of the equipment none of the
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:24.240]  electronic surveillance equipment and so forth yet they can't beat them so this is i think a
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:30.000]  a thing a sign of things to come uh romney uh and obama i think we're going to give us more
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:34.960]  at more wars probably i think romney worse than obama in the in the foreign policy area
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:41.360]  hard as that is to believe uh and of course paul ryan too um so yeah we headed down and when
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:47.840]  rome fell uh you know there was a very long period of de-civilization took a long time to build back
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:54.480]  up uh also happened when trade collapsed in the whole mediterranean world because of the
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:19:00.000]  fighting the fights between the muslims and the christians you know uh so things go on for a very
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:04.800]  long time it took a long time to rebuild uh we have to hope that we're not going to end up in that
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:09.840]  sort of situation but already of course we're poorer really if you look at things with an unjaundiced
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:15.360]  eye and pay no attention to government propaganda the average american family is no better off today
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:21.600]  than they were in the early 1970s in real terms when and that was when nixon took us off the
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:27.120]  remnants of the gold standard gave us the full fiat money paper money uh you know baloney money
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:31.920]  system that we are suffering under the whole world suffers under today and is probably going to
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:36.080]  bring us all down today or in the near future blue rock well stay there i want to come back
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:41.600]  and look at the world financial crisis and banks are told get ready for collapse government can't

[02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:31.760]  you're hearing is that of well me alex jones he's with us for the rest of the hour at lube
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:36.240]  i want to cover the waterfront with you and pick your brain and i want to get into the republican
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:42.720]  democratic field this year uh ron paul where all that's going uh paul ryan obviously romney picked
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:48.880]  the wrong paul but i don't blame him for not picking uh rand because rand's a lot better than uh than
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:55.360]  paul ryan so we know why that happened but getting back to the issue of the world economy right now
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:25:00.960]  from the perspective of an economist who heads up the von mis institute where are things going
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:06.480]  and how can the very people that got us into this crisis get us out of it when their answer
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:11.520]  is give them more power and more corporate welfare alex as you mentioned i'm not an economist although
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:17.040]  i think about economics and and write about it and read about it um but i think we can i think you
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:23.200]  know you know when your listeners know the serious trouble um they keep claiming they're patching up
[02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:29.440]  the euro and in uh in the euro zone it's not actually happening so maybe they're going to just
[02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:33.200]  continue maybe they're if the germans let them and i fear the germans are going to let them
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:39.920]  they're going to just print unlimited number of euros to buy the the uh useless bonds of the
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:44.320]  countries that have issued them to the big banks because of course as with all economic troubles
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:48.640]  these days the big banks are in back of what's happening in europe because it's not they're
[02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:53.120]  not bailing out greece they're not bailing out italy or spain they're bailing out the big banks
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:58.320]  that hold the bonds of these countries and the so-called technocratic prime ministers that have
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:03.920]  been installed in italy and greece and uh probably in other countries too and at the european central
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:09.760]  bank these people typically come from goldman sacks so this is the these are the sorts of uh
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:14.320]  people who are in back of this they want the people of europe to be further impoverished
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:19.840]  so the banks can live it up same thing happens in our own country of course we we live in also
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:26.080]  in the bankocracy so they can keep printing up fed prints up all this prints up trillions
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:32.960]  but this does have an effect when you know it's it's made us all poorer already how much poorer
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:38.960]  are we going to be uh how much of a police state and a military state and a uh a military hunter
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:42.880]  whatever there whatever the government is in washington i'm not exactly sure of what it is
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:47.600]  certainly is not anything like uh was talked about by thomas jefferson sure and let me just
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:52.400]  stop you to be specific i knew that you're not technically an economist but you had up a group
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:56.720]  that's made up of a bunch of economists i mean i mean you wouldn't call ron paul an economist
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:01.840]  but he writes books about it and studies it he's a lay economist it's like i could go out and be a
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:05.920]  preacher people call me the preacher but i didn't go to seminary to be a preacher though i did sit
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:11.360]  through a lot of sunday school my point is you had up a group that is a consortium of economists
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:16.800]  correct yes of course that's right okay so so i mean my point is i see you as a real economist i
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:21.760]  mean it's like i i don't have a degree in shooting but with a good rifle i can shoot bullseye at 500
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:27.040]  yards pretty easy so i'm not officially a sharpshooter but i am but but i mean just getting back to
[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:32.160]  that you are heavily into economics and you you you consult with a bunch of economists so i wanted
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:38.080]  your pulse on that well there's trouble i mean we're not the the the pulse is a little bit
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:42.480]  harder to feel these days because of what the government is doing we have you know in the
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:47.920]  u.s. government and the u.s. government is is uh has got its clones in britain and in europe and
[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:51.360]  so many other countries in the rest of the world the u.s. government is the biggest
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:57.200]  richest most powerful government ever to exist in the history of humankind and there's never been
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:03.440]  anything like this before so we are really in new territory uh and new territory of disaster i'm
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:08.640]  afraid i i noticed that jim rogers the other days thought that there was a collapse coming after
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:13.200]  the november elections because of all the money printing that's going on both in europe and in
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:18.960]  asia and uh in the united states of course too so i don't know so i don't know what the timing is
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:23.760]  but they are they are undermining they're but like a they're like a bunch of termites they're
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:28.240]  eating out the foundation of the house when the house is going to collapse i don't know but if the
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:33.600]  termites aren't stopped we can be sure the house is going to collapse so and then when the collapse
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:39.200]  does start to happen as it's already started they pose a savior so how do you stop them from
[02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:46.640]  turning us into a pure third world uh despotic system from the implosion that they've created
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:52.320]  well you know that's that's a great question i think the first thing we have to do is educate
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:57.360]  ourselves we all have to know some economics i would recommend something like henry haslitz
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:02.800]  economics in one lesson which was published in the late 1940s but it's just as fresh today as it
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:08.240]  was then and if you learn some economics it enabled you to see through the government lies
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:11.920]  you can see through the smoke screen that they try to generate to cover their crimes
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:16.640]  so you can understand so everybody needs to understand some economics first of all
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:22.880]  then we need to you know to resist we need to withdraw our consent we need to talk about what's
[02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:28.800]  going on we need to listen to shows like yours we need to read all the right books and uh
[02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:34.320]  mentally resist actually mentally resisting uh is you know i i would say by the way don't vote
[02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:39.120]  is one thing you can do they're very anxious that we vote they want that mandate from us they don't
[02:29:39.120 --> 02:29:44.400]  care who you vote for uh ultimately and this been the course there are interest groups tell
[02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:49.520]  us stay there explain that let's get into this current election on the quick break we'll be right
[02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:59.600]  back we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:52.880]  has now been leaked um a group did for a request and got some other bit more of it's come out how
[02:34:52.880 --> 02:34:58.560]  dangerous it is i want to get into the election and and and the two-party system and the rest of
[02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:02.640]  this loo and where you see things going and other other issues i know you're hot to talk about but
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:08.800]  first off what what is this obsession with supersonic cruise missiles i guess it's about
[02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:17.360]  military domination but this this you know 1.4 billion rounds of ammo against us the uh f a a
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:21.760]  saying yeah 30 000 drones and they're starting to arm them is this all part of government
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:27.040]  wanting big giant marble buildings to make us feel small and drones and letting us know we're
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:34.160]  being watched and face scanning cameras and and and and tsa abusing us what is all that about
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:39.360]  just the simple act of domination because they seem to think it's scaring people i don't see
[02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:44.720]  that happening i see it upsetting people and that's why they're getting politically involved
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:49.440]  exposing the system that's why they're out buying guns at record numbers what would you
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:53.760]  say the mood of the country is right now and why is government obsessed with all these armaments
[02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:58.640]  well i think it's true that people are getting upset they ought to be upset uh even hitler
[02:35:58.640 --> 02:36:04.000]  installing didn't make you know be able to feel of people's uh children and wives and so forth in
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.560]  the airport i mean this is you know most people just accept this or at least they go along with
[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:13.600]  it maybe they don't see any other way out but i think there is increasing resistance people are
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:18.320]  angry they should be angry and as you say of course people are buying every time there's a
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:24.000]  one of these incidents like in the batman shooting or whatever as vast increases in gun sales
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:28.160]  uh people want to be armed they want to have a gun in their home and of course they should
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:34.240]  they should they should be armed uh it's a great thing to have uh law-abiding good people armed
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:38.880]  and as we know it cuts down crime rates private crime doesn't affect government crime of course
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:43.920]  but it does cut down private crime which is a which is a wonderful benefit but yeah the government
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:48.640]  wants us all to feel you only have to go to i don't recommend going to washington but if you do
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:53.600]  go to washington dc take a look at the buildings they absolutely are all built to make use feel
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:59.360]  small and and make you impressed and uh uh in all the power and glory of the government
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:05.200]  so all this stuff uh has to because they also has to do with fearing the people but they want
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:12.080]  they want to make us scared of them they want to make us scared of uh phony foreign enemies
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:20.080]  and they want to make us obey they want us to uh uh be rubbed to be pushed down to uh be make all
[02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:26.160]  the peons realize that you know or they think they in hope uh will bow down to the government
[02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:30.080]  love the government worship the government fear the government give us you know give it all our
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:35.520]  money give it our children for its wars and and so well sure there's so many progressives
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:40.800]  who are well-meaning people but they've never really run a business talking to them they always
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:45.760]  come out of academia come out of government they're disconnected from the real world and how
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:51.440]  stuff really works and they always have these grand utopian views but all they ever deliver
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:58.960]  is hell on earth history shows that and we repeat it over and over again let me get into this subject
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:03.040]  and then into election 2012 and the point you're chomping at the bit to cover paul or ian and the
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:08.880]  rest of it and that's false flag staged events i know everything isn't staged but a lot of things
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:14.480]  have been staged like gulf of tonkin operation age acts gladio north woods the list goes on and on
[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:18.880]  or at least in many cases they use crises you know they don't want they don't want those to go to
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:23.120]  waste as the white house chief of staff or rama manual said former chief of staff now mayor of
[02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:29.840]  chicago but now we see the spectacle of al qaeda flags over libya al qaeda flags over rebel herald
[02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:36.480]  areas of syria we see that cfr fellow writing for them last week saying we need al qaeda that's a
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:44.160]  quote they're heroes they're doing a great job so the tsa needs to abuse my family and take
[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:51.840]  them into a private rape room if i want to fly but al qaeda is good at libya and syria and nato's
[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:57.840]  working with the criminals out of saudi arabia and then on top of that i had larry prad on a few
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:03.520]  weeks ago and he said look if the obama criminals would stage fast and furious that's killed thousands
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:10.080]  why wouldn't they stage the batman shooting when you've got reports of multiple gunmen multiple
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:16.400]  gas mask the cover-ups the government psychiatrist i mean we know they do stuff like this show so
[02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:22.000]  what do you say about false flag terror and our so-called government publicly running al qaeda
[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:26.640]  well you know as as as you know all governments especially police states
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:34.960]  employ asia provocateurs they seek to they they they cause crimes they cause terrorist incidents
[02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:42.320]  in order to to get the public all hept up and also maybe to expose people that they fear themselves
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:46.880]  who who knows about that but they did their main thing is to control their own public their own
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:52.880]  their own cash cows their own taxpayers that's the people they are really concerned about controlling
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:57.360]  so yeah they they of course they run false flags that we can't we can't sometimes know whether
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:02.320]  things are false flags and obviously we can't tell what's coming but is this government
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:07.520]  or any big government capable of false flag operations of course there's you know if they
[02:40:07.520 --> 02:40:12.880]  don't do something evil it's either because they haven't thought about it or because um
[02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:17.280]  they think it's not prudent for themselves at the time they never have the reaction oh gosh we
[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:23.200]  can't do that it's wrong that never passes the mind of anybody in washington and do the exception
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:28.240]  over and over i hate to think of ron paul as being part of washington but obviously ron paul and a
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:34.080]  handful of other guys are there are good guys but most of them you know so fast and furious was a
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:38.720]  you know was a false flag thing i think it also had to do with the fact that the cia runs the you
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:43.280]  know the international drug trade bingo that that actually came out in a few papers as you know
[02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:48.880]  because you're so informed that they were shipping drugs back it wasn't just guns in it was basically
[02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:53.920]  an iran contra part two and of course they're also destroying mexico i mean ever since george bush
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:59.520]  force them the mexicans who of course are in effect a colony of the us force them to have a drug war
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:05.360]  down there they've been more than 50 000 people killed her you horrendous damage to a mexican
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:12.560]  society and uh it's all of you of course being uh either staged or run or at least cooperated with
[02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:19.360]  by the dea and the cia why doesn't the mexican why doesn't the mexican kleptocracy kick out the
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:24.880]  the big banks that that run them well because they're all making money they're also afraid
[02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:28.720]  right they're afraid of being killed because certainly the u.s. government doesn't hesitate
[02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:32.880]  to assassinate people we're now having that openly talked about and maybe that's a good thing that
[02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:38.160]  they are openly talking about it but they've done this you know for forever if if somebody is too
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:44.160]  much trouble they'll kill them uh so yeah the washington post even the operating table or shoot
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:48.640]  down their helicopter or their plane mysteriously has something wrong with the fuel line and it
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:53.840]  goes down this this stuff happens all the time the government is a bunch of killers so we always
[02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:57.760]  have to remember that doesn't doesn't mean that every incident bad incident is because of the
[02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:03.280]  government because of course they're also hugely incompetent thank goodness uh but the in terms of
[02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:09.360]  things that are there's nothing morally beyond them so false flags this horrendous damage that
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:13.840]  they're doing to the mexicans fast and furious all this stuff of course there's a million and one
[02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:18.800]  of these things who knows what else they're planning these are bad people uh you know they're
[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:24.240]  these don't give me the flag and and the pledge of allegiance and all that so these are bad people
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:29.120]  the government are they're they're bad people well they're also maniacs i mean i couldn't imagine
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:36.640]  putting my employees stuff in the bathroom over and over again and then calling an employee up
[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:44.880]  and saying get in here and give me sexual favors right now or only hiring people that were my sexual
[02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:50.720]  persuasion as we now see coming out in these lawsuits it just really shows a disconnect
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:55.040]  but we see this in every culture in every history with the power man they're look at
[02:42:55.040 --> 02:43:00.400]  caligula marrying his horse what do you make the big scandal with big with big sis well of course
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:05.120]  this is this is a great peek into the government and they're plenty by the way of decent people
[02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:10.000]  in the government they just don't rise to the top the people who rise to the top whether it's
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:15.840]  at the dhs order you know they're not they're not concerned with security with our security or the
[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:21.440]  rest of the lies they tell they're concerned with the sex power and money so those are the three
[02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:26.080]  things that motivate the the power elite and the and the people in the government the people at
[02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:31.360]  the top of the government so this is not just dhs this is the whole government this stuff happens
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:37.360]  in the pentagon it happens in the cia it happens at the f a a good on the whole the whole alphabet
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:41.520]  from hell the all these are like this so how wonderful we're having this pointed out about
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:47.440]  the dhs maybe it will have to the scales fall from people's eyes about the nature of this thing
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:52.800]  and it's great to look look up by the way the headquarters of dhs it's it looks like something
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:58.000]  out of Mordor and it's the former saint elizabeth hospital where political prisoners have been
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:02.640]  held and they converted it into their headquarters it's a very scary it's of course intended to be
[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:07.680]  scary like every whether the the way they paint the cop cars these days the way they dress the
[02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:14.320]  cops everything is intended to scare you uh when i'm thinking of cops and dress there was a great
[02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:19.760]  period in one time in menlo park california where uh a bunch of liberals got in power and they had
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:25.600]  the cops dress in gray slacks blue blazers with a city patch on their on their on their pocket
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:31.280]  it the whole nature of cop civilian interaction changed all of a sudden they weren't marching
[02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:36.400]  around like i'm occupying force and it was a great it was a great development the cop union
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:41.760]  goes very much against it conservatives got back in uh and they succeeded in repealing this and
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:46.880]  putting everybody back into military like uniform well there's one problem too when they standardize
[02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:52.240]  it and make it a military uniform and now the cops are calling us civilians they're civilians too
[02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:58.720]  you don't want them to be military militaries and occupying army this is all 101 uh lou rockwell
[02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:04.720]  let's look at this election so many people know that mitt romney was for gun bans and abortion
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:12.880]  and open borders and globalism and carbon taxes and banker bailouts uh paul ryan banker bailouts
[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:19.120]  no child left behind i mean the list literally goes on and on but he he was held up as a conservative
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:24.560]  savior by rush limbaugh uh for his plan to cut welfare of the general you know poor people
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:29.040]  which is fine with me because it just makes them dependent and and screws up the economy but
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:34.480]  what about cutting military spending like ron paul has said and and and and people are like oh no
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:39.440]  you've got to just worship paul ryan well i was told i i needed to worship obama and he was going
[02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:45.280]  to fix things and now we're hearing about ryan mania i mean is there no end to this our main
[02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:51.520]  line conservatives as stupid as obama supporters sure they they're stupid uh a lot of them are
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:57.040]  are just wrong too they believe they worship the military they worship the police they worship
[02:45:57.040 --> 02:46:01.840]  the national security state they love drones they love all this stuff so you know if you think of
[02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:06.480]  the tea party there's a bunch of them who are ron paulians but there's also a bunch of them who
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:11.520]  were you know sarah paleonites rush limbaugh it's and so forth who believe in the whole regime
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:16.400]  and so they they applaud the wars they applaud the killing they love that stuff and they think it'll
[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:20.160]  never happen because they think they'll never be arrested they'll never be tortured they'll never
[02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:28.320]  be tasered good luck to them but um so you know it's it's a uh uh they they are stupid or they're
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:34.000]  wrong uh they're ill educated they don't understand the nature of politics they don't understand history
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:38.640]  they don't understand economics and so they're yeah and they also just buy into rhetoric it's
[02:46:38.640 --> 02:46:43.440]  it's how stupid are people i think of this one that when there's an always the rhetoric for a new
[02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:49.600]  war um and of course we're we're running a war against syria right now allied with al-qaeda
[02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:53.920]  which of course was created by the u.s. government to go up against the russians and afghanistan
[02:46:53.920 --> 02:46:58.400]  it's when the u.s. employed a sum of inladen and all those guys so they're bad they're good they're
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:04.560]  bad the good you know this is the the old switcheroo to keep everybody off balance um but paul ryan
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:09.520]  anybody all you have to do is look at his record he voted for every rotten thing that's ever gone
[02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:13.120]  through the congress if the republicans were supporting the supporting and of course the
[02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:17.280]  republicans did support all the rotten stuff whether it's the bank bailouts they said no child
[02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:26.720]  left behind medicare part d uh the uh uh permanency of the patriot act the ndaa soma syspa i mean all
[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:32.320]  all these horrendous internet control laws and so forth this guy is for the expansion of the dhs
[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:38.000]  he's for more war he's for bigger and bigger military spending and by the way his so-called
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:45.440]  cuts in domestic spending consists in lowering the projected increases so uh uh it it's all a
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:51.360]  trick he's a phony uh your listeners of course understand this that all these people are phonies
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:58.080]  so we see the sheeple uh cheering on romney who uh looks to me like he belongs in a nazi party
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:05.760]  uniform right fascism and left fascism with obama right fascism that's our choice and
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:11.680]  we have another fascist in paul ryan so the fact that he uses tricky rhetoric that he uses libertarian
[02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:18.400]  or iron randy and rhetoric to disguise his devotion to the total central state and the global empire
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:23.680]  well it's just another political trick so i'd urge people if anybody's thinking this is a good guy
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:28.880]  or of course they're portraying him as as an iran paul there is only one ron paul and this is
[02:48:28.880 --> 02:48:34.960]  of course the phony ron paul this is the uh this is the uh the devil dressed up as ron paul this guy
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:41.600]  is a very bad guy he's a total neocon he's controlled by all the bad forces and his wife
[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:46.240]  by the way also was a lobbyist for the for big pharma before she married him so this is a connected
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:51.760]  family and they've done very well it's recently came out that that he when he was briefed by
[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:58.080]  bernanke right at the beginning of the of the banking crisis he sold his stocks that he knew
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:03.360]  was going to get where they've been briefed we're going to go down wakoma and city bank in particular
[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:07.600]  any bottle of stock in goldman sacks which he'd been told was going to go up so of course this
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:15.680]  is the way these guys get rich he's he's a very powerful guy he's a complete phony he's a he's
[02:49:15.680 --> 02:49:22.080]  just the he's a very bad guy who else would romney pick romney romney is a very bad guy well yeah
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:28.400]  talk about phony for your concentration camps everything these are very bad men well no romney
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:34.080]  old biden and obama sure sure i mean i mean romney will do stuff like call on his neighbors
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:39.280]  that are smoking pot call the police but then come in and take over companies and strip them
[02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:44.720]  and destroy them and then prance around all day i've noticed really evil people will have this
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:50.480]  act that they're mr goody two shoes i mean look the whole sand dusky thing look at that look at
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:55.200]  how these universities basically become little governments and then now the head of penn state
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:50:00.000]  has been sent off to work at homeland security so now if you cover up for pedophile rings you
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:04.960]  get you don't go to jail you go to homeland security well of course there was a cover up
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:11.440]  that's why louie free was sent in to cover it cover it up um the governor of pennsylvania the
[02:50:11.440 --> 02:50:15.680]  republican governor of pennsylvania when he was attorney he was attorney general when a lot of
[02:50:15.680 --> 02:50:21.520]  this stuff was first being talked about why didn't he do anything and then he was personally pressing
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:25.920]  right when this old scandal blew up for three million dollars to be given to the sand dusky
[02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:30.800]  foundation by the state of pennsylvania why why was he doing that how come that queen so there's
[02:50:30.800 --> 02:50:35.760]  a million questions that are not being asked louie free was a famous cover up artist and a creep
[02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:39.840]  for the government sent in to cover it this is the way they operate of course they cover for the
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:45.520]  power elite and step on the regular people no exactly it's even coming out in major papers now
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:51.040]  that it's what we thought it was a pedophile ring pimping kids out to these degenerates
[02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:56.000]  i want to look at obama himself the warmonger when we come back with lou rockwell of lou rockwell

[02:54:37.280 --> 02:54:42.480]  that's a saturday night live joke if you just joined us all right final second with lou rockwell
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:50.320]  lou you know we've talked about the republicans but what about obama i mean where is the so-called
[02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:55.360]  left that are bad on a lot of things but at least for anti-war torture now they're kind of like
[02:54:55.360 --> 02:55:02.160]  hey torture people drones murder death al-qaeda kill everybody al-qaeda is good we love war it's
[02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:06.720]  our president he's tough and i see democratic leaders brag and say and see we're warmongers
[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:12.240]  we're tough how do what is it about decadent affected people that they think murder and death
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:17.840]  is cool and powerful well first of all of course political parties are about lying that's the
[02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:21.600]  government is about lying and the political parties that are part of the government are about
[02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:26.560]  lying so republicans pretend to be for lower spending for example but of course when they're
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:32.320]  in power they're spending goes way up democrats pretend to be pro-peace and although i must say
[02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:37.360]  i was shocked enough few of them actually turned out to be pro-peace and you're exactly right they're
[02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:43.840]  all fanatically if the if their guys in the white house they're fanatically for the worst war crimes
[02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:50.000]  they endorse them they cheer them on and again people who are in government and the political
[02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:53.760]  parties by the way are part of the government they're not separate from the government it's why
[02:55:53.760 --> 02:55:57.920]  for example it's impossible to take over a political party from the outside talk about you know take
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:03.600]  over the department of justice while you're at it you can't do it you can just refuse to be part of
[02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:08.720]  it but you can't actually take them over and like cancer they're programmed to totally take over so
[02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:14.160]  how long until they fully implode everything and start trying to use their 1.4 billion bullet
[02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:20.400]  saw us well i think that again i started to say this before but the government is so big
[02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:25.280]  that it's out of control even internally the bureaucracy the problems of bureaucracy living
[02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:30.960]  on mesas wrote about this in his great little book uh on bureaucracy many years ago but the
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:34.880]  problems of bureaucracy and there's never been a bureaucracy like the u.s government so they're
[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:41.920]  becoming more and more trouble uh but more and more troubled too i i was thinking like a like a
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:47.360]  blind vicious dog so if you happen to get in their jaws or you're stepped on or whatever you're dead
[02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:54.000]  but uh you don't have to be oh that's a good way to describe it with them it is like a giant blind
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:57:01.360]  kujo uh and and it is stumbling around foaming but it could just implode at any time i've noticed
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:07.440]  that historically now that's right governments have come down in the past uh as our government
[02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:12.400]  becomes bankrupt the government is bankrupt and it's trying to bankrupt us too of course at the
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:17.680]  same time and as its own troops and this happens when empires start to come down so our troops
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:23.840]  don't obey it so um i'd like to think that if american troops are ordered to shoot american
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:28.320]  citizens they would actually refuse to do it you know i can't even keep my fingers crossed if that's
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:33.520]  the case but i think i think the government can't be sure of them they can't be sure of us they
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:37.680]  can't be sure of anything it's why they're all scared they're actually scared of us and that's
[02:57:37.680 --> 02:57:42.640]  good that's good pre preening themselves in their uniforms and they're so strong and so wonderful
[02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:50.960]  and they're actually a little casper milk toast albeit with vampire teeth that's funny image
[02:57:50.960 --> 02:57:56.960]  casper milk toast albeit with vampire teeth no no i agree with you but but they're dangerous because
[02:57:56.960 --> 02:58:01.760]  they're cornered rats but we actually have the initiative they know that in their own bureaucracy
[02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:07.200]  is starting to fall apart and a lot of military and police are waking up it may end up be if they
[02:58:07.200 --> 02:58:13.440]  call for martial law it might be their waterloo like romania with chelchescu well it could be and
[02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:18.320]  i think they are they are very worried about us they're worried about their own people and they
[02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:23.520]  shouldn't be worried so it's an entirely illegitimate operation that lives off lies and theft and
[02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:29.760]  killing and so forth and uh uh governments have come down it is in danger of imploding i should
[02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:34.240]  say in danger from their standpoint of imploding it would be a great day for us of course exactly
[02:58:34.240 --> 02:58:39.520]  lou rockwell thank you so much casper milk toast thank you with vampire teeth that's obama
[02:58:39.520 --> 02:58:57.520]  ha ha not for thank you for listening to not for rato we'll see you tonight seven o'clock folks live.com today
