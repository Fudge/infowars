[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  Another world. Another time. In the age of wonder. Another world. Another time. His life was green and good. Until the truth cracked.
[00:26.000 --> 00:40.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[00:40.000 --> 01:00.000]  The Info War has achieved liftoffs. We'll be in orbit soon. Targeting enemy globalist lives with even more firepower. We've only just begun in the beta testing of the Resistance and hacking the globalist propaganda system.
[01:00.000 --> 01:10.000]  Directing the narrative back into the reality zone. I am your host, Alex Jones, coming up. James O'Keefe of the Veritas Project or Project Veritas.
[01:10.000 --> 01:22.000]  Then, Harry Dent in studio on what's really happening in the economy and more. House Dems push assault weapons ban. It's all coming up. German court lets off Sharia police patrol in German city.
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.000]  They're actually allowed to be vigilantes. They're not allowed to demonstrate against them, but they're allowed to do whatever they want.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  Because they're the new shocktrips of the Socialist. The friends of women.
[01:34.000 --> 01:47.000]  But first, let's go back to the chipmunk. Excuse me, the giant gopher-like creature. One of those big gophers called, I don't mean that to be goofy how he looks, but he looks like one of those giant burrowing rodents.
[01:47.000 --> 02:03.000]  Is it a woodchuck? Capybara? Is it a, what's that other one called? Groundhog. I mean, Chris Christie is an open borders anti-gun chump.
[02:03.000 --> 02:13.000]  And he's up here saying, I would call up and threaten Vladimir Putin. You don't fly planes in there. A sovereign nation's been invaded by the West for five years.
[02:13.000 --> 02:21.000]  Maybe he's in Nutria. All this stuff's going on. And the response of Governor Kasich and Governor Christie is punch the Russians in the nose.
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  That's a quote from Kasich and call it Putin and threatening will blow your planes up.
[02:26.000 --> 02:34.000]  They know you've already blown up Ukraine and put fascist in and overthrew the elected government and blown up the power and bombed the power plants.
[02:34.000 --> 02:43.000]  And all trade into Crimea will be shut off next week. The hijacked leaders of Ukraine just said today.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  I mean, believe me, Russia gives speeches saying, never since World War II we've been under this attack. We're encircled.
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  We've got the nuclear forces ready. We believe they may head us first. They're dangerous neocons who are psychotic.
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  The bunkers are being built for the public. Prepare. We just want to keep Russia from collapsing. We're trying our best.
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.000]  And meanwhile, our guys are bloody nose, body bags, kill the Roskies.
[03:06.000 --> 03:15.000]  I mean, Hitler didn't shoot his mouth off like that. It's just so unmanly. It's so even warlords who were tough stuff don't act like this.
[03:15.000 --> 03:21.000]  I mean, this is real Third World General stuff, you know, with 14 stars on their little pelts.
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  These guys are a bunch of neocon chicken, nut, neck, cowards. Let's go back to Rand Paul's devastating response.
[03:28.000 --> 03:38.000]  Governor Christie, if the U.S. imposed a no-fly zone over Syria and a Russian plane encroached and invaded that no-fly zone,
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  would you be prepared to shoot down that Russian plane and risk war with Russia?
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  Not only would we be prepared to do it, I would do it. A no-fly zone means a no-fly zone. Wolf, that's what it means.
[03:49.000 --> 03:58.000]  See, maybe because I'm from New Jersey, I just have this kind of plane-language hangout, but I would not talk to Vladimir Putin.
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.000]  In fact, I would talk to Vladimir Putin a lot. And I would say to him, listen, Mr. President, there's no-fly zone in Syria.
[04:04.000 --> 04:12.000]  You fly in, it applies to you. And yes, we would shoot down the planes of Russian pilots if, in fact, they were stupid enough to think that this president
[04:12.000 --> 04:20.000]  was the same feckless weakling that the president we have in the Oval Office is right now.
[04:20.000 --> 04:28.000]  Senator Paul. Senator Paul, I want you to respond to what we just heard from Governor Christie.
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.000]  If there was a no-fly zone, you say that potentially could lead to World War III. Why?
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  Well, I think if you're in favor of World War III, you have your candidate. You know, here's the thing.
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  Come back with the rest of his response. Let's pack it up to Wolf Blitzer.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  The admitted Israeli Mossad operative, I'm not against Israelis or anybody. I just want you to know that
[04:49.000 --> 05:13.000]  you're CIA and then you've got the former head of the big Israel pack and a known agent, Wolf Blitzer, up there.
[05:19.000 --> 05:32.000]  We also will take a look back on stories and video reports we've covered in the past and how they relate to current news,

[07:55.000 --> 08:16.000]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[08:25.000 --> 08:37.000]  Huma Abedin, the admitted Muslim Brotherhood Mole, but over here she can dress in fancy dresses and hang out with Hillary Clinton and the same hotel room.
[08:37.000 --> 08:51.000]  They're really good friends and that's fine. But the potential first lady, the woman who could potentially be the shadow first lady, got caught by James O'Keeffe Undercover Reporter and some pretty serious stuff.
[08:51.000 --> 08:57.000]  And then of course O'Keeffe got some other big breaking undercover news and then he's a little under the weather today so he's going to do 20 minutes with us.
[08:57.000 --> 09:06.000]  He's going to come back in the new year with something potentially, and I know what it is, but I'm not going to say I appreciate him sharing it with us in confidence, as big as Acorn or bigger.
[09:06.000 --> 09:13.000]  Okay, and this is a guy that has helped blow up corrupt organizations that were getting up to $4 billion a year in taxpayer money.
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.000]  He's like the Patriot Death Star to the New World Order. And of course they don't see his praises, they arrest him, they try to indict him.
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  He is a true 21st century polar bear. I'm not kissing his butt, folks. I don't do that for very many guests.
[09:25.000 --> 09:32.000]  But James O'Keeffe, I'm a big fan of him and he's a best-selling author as well. You can find out more at projectveritas.com.
[09:32.000 --> 09:43.000]  If you're not supporting them, you're basically aiding and abetting the globalist. I mean, I'm done talking. Let's go to a clip of this undercover report with Hillary Clinton's girl. Here it is.
[09:43.000 --> 09:52.000]  When we were able to catch the vice-chairwoman after her speech, she made it clear that Hillary is all in favor of allowing Syrian refugees into the country.
[09:52.000 --> 10:09.000]  Thank you so much for addressing the Syrian refugee crisis, because honestly, the glomaphobia is rampant and you have to promise me, like, if Hillary is elected president, she's going to do everything she can to let these Syrians in because the Republicans are doing everything they can to ban them.
[10:09.000 --> 10:18.000]  Oh, and by the way, it's not just Republicans. There are some Democrats who are here to meet me, to have leadership on this. It cannot turn these people away.
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.000]  And I think the Syrian people know that Hillary is the answer for them, too. You know? I think they know.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  We're going to be isolated in this country and we're turning everybody away.
[10:30.000 --> 10:37.000]  That kind of talk is music to the ears of the Syrian men we met in Athens, Greece, recently.
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  You guys must really hate Hillary Clinton.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  No, we don't hate Hillary Clinton.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  You like her?
[10:44.000 --> 10:59.000]  They say politics makes strange bedfellows. I guess they are right. Here we found Syrian refugees looking to get to northern Europe or to the United States by any means possible, suggesting even using fake passports.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  And they are unabashed Hillary supporters.
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.000]  You know, we need to travel to Germany. How are you going to do that?
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.000]  Maybe by a plane, by a fake passport.
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  We like Hillary Clinton if she has action to finish Syria.
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  Oh, what about now? Do you like her?
[11:19.000 --> 11:20.000]  Who?
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  Do you like her now, though? Like what she's done so far?
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  I believe maybe she can do something.
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  Smile.
[11:27.000 --> 11:34.000]  Because voting ID laws are so lax in so many states, these Syrian refugees might just be able to vote for Hillary.
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  If, as she supports, they can get into the United States.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  And this is the political plan.
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  And then make them a protected group that can whine and complain and go around and bully people with Sharia law.
[11:44.000 --> 11:49.000]  German court lets off Sharia police patrol in major German city.
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  That's BBC today.
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  They can just run around to whatever they want.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  And again, folks, the reason James O'Keeffe is so amazing.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  He's gone through so much. He's built such an organization.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  He keeps really wounding the globalist grievously and their agendas.
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  And he's a model for everybody else with investigative journalists that undercover stuff.
[12:10.000 --> 12:16.000]  I mean, I was around before James O'Keeffe doing some similar things, but not with the skill, the focus, the dedication.
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  He is somebody I learned from.
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.000]  And the reason I brag about it is we don't give patriots enough kudos
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  because we need to understand the success we're all having.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  That we're bigger than the mainstream media.
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  I get 20 million viewers or listeners a week now, conservatively.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  In fact, it's grown.
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  Think about that. Think about what we're all doing together.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  We are becoming the majority. People are waking up.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  All right, James, I know you're under the weathers.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  We'll just keep you to 30 after. Appreciate you coming on.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  I tell you, you really got my heart racing with the news.
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  You were relayed to the producer earlier.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  Can't wait till you break that.
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  Break into this and then get into your other big kudos that you and your crew have been carrying out.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  Yes, thank you, Alex. And thank you for the compliments.
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  I'm very impressed by what you built.
[12:57.000 --> 13:04.000]  Like I told you last time, I love the work you've done about 10 years ago, going to the DMV in Texas and forcing those people,
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  showing them 11 different forms of ID and then they still want to take your blood.
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  So that was an inspiration to me early on. So thank you very much.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  Thank you, brother.
[13:12.000 --> 13:18.000]  Yeah, this whole thing we did on the on the Syrians, we went to Greece and we interviewed a lot of these.
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.000]  So called refugees and illegal immigrants coming into Greece.
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.000]  And some of these guys were talking to us about how much it costs to get a fake passport to get into the United States.
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.000]  One of them says $3,000, 3,000 euro to get a fake passport.
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  And what they told us they were doing, these are people we interviewed on the street with hidden cameras.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  These are the exact same types of people that went on to France and committed the bombings.
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.000]  And they all love Hillary Clinton. And that's what our hidden camera expose is showed.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  And in terms of Huma, we do go to the fundraisers with hidden cameras for Hillary Clinton.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  That's when we interviewed Huma.
[13:55.000 --> 14:02.000]  We also have people right now, I'm happy to say this to you, working for Hillary Clinton that are working for Project Veritas.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  And we have built kind of like how they have their intelligence agencies.
[14:07.000 --> 14:15.000]  We've built our own kind of intelligence journalistic operation and we have a number of these undercover people reporting back to us throughout 2016.
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  So in terms of the Syrian stuff, it's pretty straightforward.
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  I mean, these guys are blatant about their plans to come to the United States.
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  They're telling us how much money it costs to buy the fake passports and they all love Hillary Clinton.
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  Shouldn't she be congressionally investigated, Hillary's girl, for being so blatant about this?
[14:33.000 --> 14:40.000]  And look, I'm a libertarian, so I don't get into bashing lesbians and bisexuals and people as long as they don't promote it to kids.
[14:40.000 --> 14:47.000]  But I mean, obviously it's well known that she's hooked up with Hillary that Hillary has seen more tail than a toilet seat, quote, Bill Clinton.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  And so she should just be honest about it. Is this going to be the first lady?
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  I mean, shouldn't Hillary's potential first lady be investigated further?
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  And by the way, talk about courage, James.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  You know, messing with Hillary's girl, she might really come after you.
[15:01.000 --> 15:10.000]  Well, we did, Alex, we did launch a story back in September where we actually caught one of Hillary's attorneys in Nevada saying,
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  just break the laws, just break the rules on voter registration.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  We caught this on tape and this attorney, Christina Gupana, is her name.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  She just completely disappeared.
[15:19.000 --> 15:26.000]  I mean, we could not find, I don't think she works there anymore and nobody knows where she went.
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  So it's kind of a mafia-like tactics that we have discovered in the Hillary campaign.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  In terms of fear, you know, Alex, you know, we built an organization.
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  We have 100,000 people that we distribute to.
[15:38.000 --> 15:48.000]  So I think Hillary's got to be careful about retaliating against people like me or people like you because all it does is sort of waking up the beast.
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.000]  The people, the audience that we have, I think that the last thing Hillary wants to do is engage.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  I agree.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  They don't want to make us martyrs and that's what really freaks them out.
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.000]  She admits she's losing the info war to Congress three years ago, as you know.
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  What do you expect them to do next?
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.000]  I'm going to get into your other big coup with this attorney general.
[16:06.000 --> 16:07.000]  I mean, they are getting mad.
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  They are talking to all the think tanks openly saying,
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  what do we do to shut down the libertarian patriot movement?
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  How do we censor these folks?
[16:14.000 --> 16:18.000]  Matt Drudge, as you know, has been told by Major Supreme Court Justice that they're coming for us.
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.000]  Him, you, myself and others next year.
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  I saw the interview do with Matt Drudge, but phenomenal scoop, by the way.
[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  I mean, I agree with Matt Drudge.
[16:28.000 --> 16:36.000]  I mean, you're going to have to, this is a courageous fight and we have Project Veritas is going where no one else has ever gone before.
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  We're building our own journalistic kind of intelligence gathering operation.
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  We're putting people behind enemy lines with hidden cameras.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  We're going to candidate events, the fundraisers.
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  We have people working for campaigns that are reporting back to us.
[16:51.000 --> 16:54.000]  How do you, how do they not shut you down?
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  Maybe they will, but we're going to give it the best shot in 2016.
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.000]  And they've tried to put me in jail before you know that.
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.000]  I've been on your program to discuss this, but I think we're kind of like the Death Star.
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.000]  At this point, if they shoot into us, it only makes us bigger and bolder and batter.
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.000]  And when I was, when I was one person, one man, I mean, they can shut down one guy,
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  but they cannot shut down an army of exposers and investigators.
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.000]  And that's what we need to do.
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.000]  We need to build the army.
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  If your audience is interested in becoming a videographer reporter, contact projectveritas.com and we will equip you.
[17:27.000 --> 17:28.000]  We will mobilize you.
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.000]  We will deploy you.
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.000]  They are unable to shut down more than one man.
[17:33.000 --> 17:34.000]  Absolutely.
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  And I intend to try to get even more reporters on staff and also get auxiliaries around the country as well because we're not in competition.
[17:40.000 --> 17:48.000]  We are fighting for the life of this country. And I use the Death Star analogy because of the firepower blowing up some of their biggest on the ground frauds like Acron.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  I mean, that was a devastatingly evil organization.
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  You guys literally destroyed it with the truth or they destroyed themselves.
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.000]  But flipping back to the Star Wars analogy, it's more like you've got a hundred thousand X-wings in your group.
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  And so do we that they can't hit us all.
[18:02.000 --> 18:09.000]  They can't get us all because we're just all over the place because they didn't, they didn't see a small one man or one woman fighter as a threat.
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  And they just can't defeat us if we take action. It's over.
[18:13.000 --> 18:14.000]  They're deterred.
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  Yeah, one thing that we found like with Acorn, Acorn rebranded itself.
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  Your audience knows that Acorn was shut down.
[18:19.000 --> 18:25.000]  President Obama signed legislation to defund Acorn six years ago after our expose.
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  Acorn has turned into a bunch of subgroups like organizing for America.
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  And a lot of these groups are scared.
[18:31.000 --> 18:37.000]  They're petrified that there are going to be people like us going in there with cameras exposing it.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  And they're ultimately deterred.
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  They're deterred from doing the fraud.
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  But what happens is they take the fraud and they go behind closed doors.
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  It makes it tougher to uncover.
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.000]  So we actually, at Veritas, we have to increase our sophistication.
[18:50.000 --> 18:59.000]  And Alex, I want to come on your show in January because we have a huge story coming out about the topic is education in the country.
[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  And it's a topic that your audience is going to want to hear about.
[19:03.000 --> 19:08.000]  We had to build online aliases. We had to go way behind closed doors,
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  build relationships with a lot of these federal officials over months.
[19:11.000 --> 19:16.000]  This is what we have to do to expose them because they take their fraud deeper and deeper and deeper.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  They don't do it in the open anymore.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  So we've got to go behind closed doors.
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  Well, you are using intelligence agency tactics when you use good-looking women and stuff.
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  And you've got people pulling their wedding rings off and spilling their guts.
[19:27.000 --> 19:33.000]  I mean, you're doing some stuff that they would use against the mob or whatever the CIA would use.
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.000]  I've really got to hand it to you, just the innovation, the boldness.
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.000]  But I guess, let me guess, as they've persecuted you more and you've just become more successful,
[19:43.000 --> 19:48.000]  has that made you more aggressive, their attempts at intimidation?
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  I think it's just made us smarter.
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  They say, what doesn't jail you make you smarter?
[19:53.000 --> 19:58.000]  But I do really believe in the deaths, you know, you say the X-Wing, the Death Star analogy like Eric Holder.
[19:58.000 --> 20:04.000]  You know, we got offered Eric Holder's ballot because there's no photo ID so you can get offered ballots.
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.000]  And after that happened, Holder did not come after us.
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  Instead, he kind of backed off.
[20:09.000 --> 20:14.000]  So I think applying the tactics of Saul Linsky, personalizing the target, learning from intelligence agencies,
[20:14.000 --> 20:22.000]  we actually hired a former CIA case officer to teach us about the tactics that they do
[20:22.000 --> 20:27.000]  and learning these techniques and using them to investigate and expose fraud.
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  I think it's made us bolder. I think it's made us learn more.
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  Yes, see, I didn't know that you'd been trained by former CIA, but that's clear.
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  What you guys are doing is really aggressive and it is the model, folks.
[20:38.000 --> 20:41.000]  Everybody's got to get your book that breaks all this down.
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.000]  I mean, I've told my crew this, we need to do this as well.
[20:44.000 --> 20:49.000]  I've kind of not cracked the whip because it's such a sophisticated thing you're doing.
[20:49.000 --> 20:52.000]  But overall, it's just about doing it, you get better and better.
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.000]  Let's shift gears before we get to your final story and let you go here in about five minutes.
[20:55.000 --> 21:00.000]  Let's talk about, again, James O'Keefe, projectveritas.com joining us,
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  breaking one of the biggest stories ever early next year.
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  He says he'll join us as soon as that comes out.
[21:05.000 --> 21:06.000]  What about the culture war?
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  I mean, we know so many prominent Hollywood people who've been silent their whole lives,
[21:10.000 --> 21:18.000]  like Kurt Russell this week, coming out and saying, I'm pro-guine and here's why so eloquently.
[21:18.000 --> 21:23.000]  But I don't know what the system's going to do as everybody really turns on political correctness.
[21:23.000 --> 21:28.000]  I mean, even South Park is, this has got to be really, really worrying them.
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.000]  Well, I mean, one of the things that in terms of the culture wars, the Good Wife on CBS,
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  I don't know if people watched that show, but it's all the investigations I do,
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.000]  they mentioned our work about two weeks ago on The Good Wife.
[21:41.000 --> 21:48.000]  On CBS, the screenwriter, they said, they did a whole show about undercover videos on planned parenthood
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.000]  and abortion things, and they brought my name up and said, this is disgusting.
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.000]  This is like James O'Keefe.
[21:53.000 --> 21:57.000]  I must have gotten 200 text messages in the course of two minutes,
[21:57.000 --> 22:01.000]  all people I've never even talked to in years, suddenly paying attention.
[22:01.000 --> 22:04.000]  So we've got to somehow take our work and make it mainstream.
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  We've got to force people to pay attention to what we do.
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  Now on the subject of guns, now what we did, and this is something that we're going to continue doing,
[22:10.000 --> 22:11.000]  I think it's very important.
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  The Attorney General of Maryland, we went undercover and we met this guy.
[22:16.000 --> 22:17.000]  Yes, he took his wedding ring off.
[22:17.000 --> 22:18.000]  This guy's married.
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  He was supposed to be a taxpayer-funded conference.
[22:21.000 --> 22:27.000]  He tries to, he starts hitting on my female undercover reporter and divulging all this information and saying,
[22:27.000 --> 22:28.000]  now here's the truth.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  I really want to ban all guns.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  I want to ban all guns.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  I don't want you to tell anybody I said that.
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  I want that to be off the record.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  This is the deputy attorney general of Maryland saying this.
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.000]  So I'm going to continue to do that.
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.000]  Usually I don't say this publicly, but I'm going to try to catch all these officials in all these states.
[22:47.000 --> 22:51.000]  What exactly do they intend to do about the Second Amendment?
[22:51.000 --> 22:54.000]  And for some reason, I don't know why they don't shoot a shot from the rooftops.
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  If they want to ban all guns, let's hear it.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  That's one of the things that I'm going to be doing.
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.000]  That's what we did in Maryland.
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  Got this guy in hot water.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  He takes off his wedding ring.
[23:03.000 --> 23:08.000]  He starts hitting on our undercover reporter telling her exactly what he intends to do with your gun rights.
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  With your gun rights in the state of Maryland.
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  And that's how you pick up Democrat, weirdo, socialist women who we thought she was.
[23:14.000 --> 23:15.000]  As you tell them, I want to destroy America.
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.000]  I want the guns.
[23:16.000 --> 23:17.000]  I'm a tyrant. I'm filth.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  They just go, oh my gosh, let's go.
[23:19.000 --> 23:22.000]  But sadly enough, that's not who they were dealing with.
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  After you're gone, I'm going to come back and play a clip of that video.
[23:25.000 --> 23:30.000]  Maryland attorney general's office sex guns and egregious ethical violations.
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.000]  Just one of the latest bombshell videos that you released just last week.
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.000]  Now, speaking of, you go after Acre and they're getting three to five billion a year.
[23:39.000 --> 23:43.000]  You're going to multiple offices where they're like, you got underage prostitutes?
[23:43.000 --> 23:44.000]  No big deal.
[23:44.000 --> 23:50.000]  I mean, just showing the incredible seediness and mafioso behavior of these organizations.
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.000]  But as you said, they then just break into battleground, Texas and metastasize.
[23:55.000 --> 24:04.000]  Speaking of Kurt Russell, it reminds me of the thing where you chop off one part of it and it just grows tentacles and ends up running away.
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  Now, still, that ends up hurting it.
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  But how do you track down every piece of it?
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.000]  How does Kurt Russell take this out and flamethrow it?
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  How do we deal with this, James O'Keeffe?
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.000]  I haven't seen that one in a couple years.
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  I think that the price of liberty...
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  Oh, that's Hillary on screen.
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  We're showing some of Hillary on the campaign troll right now.
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  Kurt Russell's dealing with it.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  I think the price of liberty, Alex, is eternal vigilance.
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.000]  A lot of people I speak with think, James, they're just going to metamorphose into something else.
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  They're going to change into something else.
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  Look, you've got to keep going.
[24:41.000 --> 24:49.000]  If something is effective, if something takes an organization down or exposes the truth, you've got to keep exposing it.
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  Acorn's going to turn into different subgroups.
[24:51.000 --> 24:52.000]  They've lost their federal funding.
[24:52.000 --> 24:59.000]  And if we catch one government official and they lose their job, which is what's going to happen in January again,
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  we call them scouts.
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  If we can get one person to lose their job, then we need to do that 100 times.
[25:05.000 --> 25:14.000]  And I guarantee you that after the 100th person loses their job, maybe our people in Congress...
[25:14.000 --> 25:21.000]  Maybe our people in Congress take the system and reform the system instead of firing every federal workforce.
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.000]  And that's my goal.
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  Just get as many as possible on tape until they actually reform the system.
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  I agree with you. Then we have to hunt down every piece of it and then prosecute them for the crimes they've committed.
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.000]  So, I mean, isn't local government states taking action?
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  Isn't that our current Russell on the ground with the flamethrower?
[25:37.000 --> 25:44.000]  Alex, I don't believe that our current court system or our current political leadership is going to solve the problems our country faces.
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  I think this is a movement-driven thing.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  I think it's a people-driven thing.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  It's a bottom-up thing.
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.000]  I do not look to courts or to Congress to actually solve the problem.
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  But you've got to outrage the people.
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  That's happening right now in our politics.
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  It's happening with some of the support that Donald Trump and Ted Cruz has.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  People are very frustrated.
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.000]  So, I think we've got to feed people information, allow them to be outraged about what's happening.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  And if the groups change and they turn into a different...
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  I'm laughing at what you have on the screen there.
[26:16.000 --> 26:23.000]  If they turn into different alien forms and they're organizing for America and snake heads, just keep going after them.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  That's what you do.
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  I mean, Kurt Russell knows how to take them out.
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  We can learn a few things from the CIA and Kurt Russell.
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  I encourage your audience.
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  I know that we don't like Saul Linsky and we don't like some of the CIA tactics.
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  But we should also learn from some of the things they do.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  Well, real days, the CIA used this against mass murdering communists and it's all very fair of its applied right.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  You know, it's the new stuff that's dirty, funding ISIS and stuff, proxy wars.
[26:53.000 --> 27:01.000]  It's good to legally and lawfully be an investigative journalist, infiltrate, you know, use sex operatives as long as they're not offering sex for info.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  And just let these guys spill their guts.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  These are enemies of the Republic in my view.
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  And we've got to take the gloves off.
[27:07.000 --> 27:08.000]  We are at war.
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.000]  We are at war and we don't take prisoners.
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.000]  Now, we're journalists, so we're not funding ISIS and doing some of the dirty things you mentioned.
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  But this is a war for the sake of our country.
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  And that's why I'm building what I'm building.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  I'm building stuff I can't even talk to you about.
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  But I am very excited to come on your program in January.
[27:27.000 --> 27:34.000]  I want you to be one of the first people to have this story about our education system or federal education system.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  It's going to be bombshell.
[27:35.000 --> 27:44.000]  And I just encourage everyone to have hope and to know that, you know, things are turning around and just be part of this movement for accountability.
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  And by the way, I'd have you on five, six years ago when you weren't as positive.
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  I mean, I wasn't as positive and there's a lot of bad stuff happening.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  But at the same time, people are really waking up.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  It's not that they're even conservative.
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  I mean, I'm a libertarian.
[27:55.000 --> 28:01.000]  We just really realized, man, the Democrats rotted into something really scary that's metastasizing.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  And they're really out to destroy the two-party system and really take over.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  And they're working with a bunch of neocons and rhinos and it's time to take the gloves off.
[28:10.000 --> 28:18.000]  And you and your book and project veritas.com, in my view, James O'Keefe, again, is the model, the cutting edge of how to counter these people.
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.000]  And in closing, I mean, when I see stuff like these folks infiltrating the abortion clinics and others, and then I talk to these folks,
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  they are using you and in our model, but especially you and others as the way to do it.
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.000]  And I know those are just more X-wings out there to attack the Death Star.
[28:33.000 --> 28:40.000]  It's got to give you a good feeling to know that we're all in this together. More people are coming to the floor.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  And that means it makes us even harder to beat.
[28:42.000 --> 28:49.000]  Yeah. I mean, David DeLyden, who did the story on Center for Medical Progress, you know, I met him a couple years ago in Sacramento.
[28:49.000 --> 29:01.000]  And I mean, it took him, by the way, three years of commitment to infiltrate Planned Parenthood and expose what was happening with selling fetal tissue.
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  That's a lot of commitment, three years on one issue, and that's what it's going to take.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  It's going to take a couple brave people in it.
[29:07.000 --> 29:15.000]  And if federal officials, if government officials are lying, feeling cheating from the taxpayer, we will make you an unwilling internet sensation.
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.000]  We will make you famous.
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  Well done. Well done.
[29:19.000 --> 29:23.000]  Well, projectveritas.com James O'Keefe, you're awesome. Have a wonderful Christmas.
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.000]  And we look forward to in a few weeks when you break the bombshell to have you back with us. Thank you, sir.
[29:27.000 --> 29:28.000]  Thank you.
[29:28.000 --> 29:35.000]  Folks, put his book back on screen for TV viewers. If we can, it's available at projectveritas.com and bookstores all over the place.
[29:35.000 --> 29:42.000]  You want the model, it's breakthrough, our guerrilla war to expose fraud and save democracy or this republic.
[29:42.000 --> 29:58.000]  James O'Keefe, it's a blueprint for victory. He's a true info warrior. Stay with us.
[29:58.000 --> 30:02.000]  Thanks to the Federal Reserve System, America's economy is in a terminal decline.
[30:02.000 --> 30:08.000]  And according to economic expert Michael Snyder, here's eight facts that reveal just how bad the economy really is.
[30:08.000 --> 30:13.000]  Number one, majority of all American workers bring home less than $30,000 a year in wages.
[30:13.000 --> 30:18.000]  Number two, the poorest 40% of all Americans now spend most of their incomes just on food and housing.
[30:18.000 --> 30:24.000]  Number three, at least 50% of Americans who rent their homes spend more than a third of their incomes on the rent.
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.000]  Number four, incomes keep declining for a large majority of the US population.
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  Number five, the price of ground beef has more than doubled since 2009.
[30:32.000 --> 30:38.000]  Number six, the rate of home ownership in the US has been declining for at least seven years in a row.
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  It's now the lowest that has been in 20 years.
[30:40.000 --> 30:47.000]  Number seven, almost half of all Americans are not saving their money and it's been estimated that 62% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[30:47.000 --> 30:52.000]  Number eight, one third of all Americans with student loans are currently behind on their student loan debt.

[33:16.000 --> 33:23.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[33:23.000 --> 33:28.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:28.000 --> 33:31.000]  Well, we had Matt Drudge about a month ago in studio.
[33:31.000 --> 33:35.000]  He only does an interview every three, four years, and I thought that got me excited.
[33:35.000 --> 33:41.000]  But I'm telling you, Donald Trump is our guest, ladies and gentlemen, for the next 30 minutes or so.
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.000]  And obviously, he is a maverick. He's an original. He tells it like it is.
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  Doesn't read off a teleprompter. Neither do I. He's self-made.
[33:49.000 --> 33:54.000]  This whole media operation that reaches 20 million people a week worldwide, conservatively self-made.
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.000]  That's why I'm so excited. And he joins us from Trump Tower in New York City.
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.000]  He is the leading 2016 Republican presidential contender.
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.000]  Donald Trump, again, joins us. And I've got so many questions.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  But first off, Donald, thank you for joining us.
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  Thank you, Alex. Great. Great to be with you.
[34:13.000 --> 34:16.000]  I've got so many questions, but you are vindicated.
[34:16.000 --> 34:24.000]  This has got to be the 50th time the last six months on the radical Muslim celebrating, not just in New Jersey, but New York, Palestine, all over.
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.000]  What do you have to say? They're still attacking you, though we've got Dan Rather on video.
[34:29.000 --> 34:34.000]  We've got New York Post. We've got Washington Post. We've got, I mean, what's going on here?
[34:34.000 --> 34:42.000]  Well, I took a lot of heat and I was very strong on it and I held my line and then all of a sudden, you know, hundreds of people were calling up my office.
[34:42.000 --> 34:48.000]  I was the other day in Sarasota, Florida and people are online and we had 12,000 people, which is fantastic.
[34:48.000 --> 34:54.000]  And the people were saying, many of the people from New Jersey, four or five people said, Mr. Trump, I saw it myself.
[34:54.000 --> 34:59.000]  I was there. They talked about Patterson, but they said, I saw it myself, Mr. Trump, I was there.
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  So many people have called in and on Twitter at real Donald Trump, they're all tweeting.
[35:04.000 --> 35:10.000]  So I knew it happened and I held my line and people wanted me to apologize and we can't do that.
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  People like you and I can't do that so easily.
[35:12.000 --> 35:20.000]  Now, we can do it if we're wrong, Alex, you apologize. I'd apologize if I was wrong, but they were celebrating and they were celebrating the fall of the World Trade Center.
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  I think that's disgraceful.
[35:22.000 --> 35:35.000]  It is. And that same week you were reporting on that fact, we had two different international football games, soccer games with the Turkish fans and others during the moment of silence for the dead people in Paris,
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  chanting Allah Akbar and booing. So did that not happen too?
[35:39.000 --> 35:45.000]  Well, that happened and everybody saw it. That was a week ago and the players were out on the field and they couldn't believe it.
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  They were embarrassed. They didn't know what to do. The coach and the managers, they all apologized, but it happened.
[35:49.000 --> 35:56.000]  Look, we have to deal with reality. And you know, it all started because I said, we need surveillance. We need proper surveillance.
[35:56.000 --> 36:03.000]  We have people that truly are evil and they're coming from some place and you know sort of where they're coming from, at least the vicinity.
[36:03.000 --> 36:13.000]  And I said, we need proper surveillance, whether it's a mosque or anyplace else, we have to be surveilled and we have to see what's coming at us because we're not going to have a country anymore.
[36:13.000 --> 36:19.000]  Between the weak borders that we have, the pathetic and weak borders where politicians are afraid to do anything about it.
[36:19.000 --> 36:29.000]  Between all of what's happening with radical, you know, you look at what's going on, you have a president that doesn't even want to talk about, you know, the radical Muslim stuff.
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.000]  He doesn't want to mention the word. He doesn't want to say it.
[36:32.000 --> 36:40.000]  But you look at what's happening where we have a president that's over there celebrating global warming and trying to get everybody excited about global warming.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  Like that's our number one problem. He considers that to be our number one problem.
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.000]  And our number one problem is what's going on where they want to blow up our cities and they want to blow up our country.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  That's our number one problem.
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  And then our number two problem is crippled America, your number one New York Times bestseller.
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  We're going to talk about that in a few minutes, but let's continue with the number one problem.
[36:59.000 --> 37:09.000]  And I agree with you. It's now in mainstream news, Associated Press and others are reporting that it's a secret deal with Turkey, with the Germans,
[37:09.000 --> 37:14.000]  with Merkel, the admitted socialist to bring in millions of radical Islamists.
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  They admit almost all of them are Sunni that basically invaded Syria.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  They're getting their butt kicked by the Russians.
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  So now they want to flee up to the north into Turkey.
[37:23.000 --> 37:30.000]  You said months ago bomb the oil of ISIS and the mainstream media laugh because you said the sky was blue again.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  Now the Pentagon says that's the right thing to do.
[37:33.000 --> 37:39.000]  And now you've come out saying, quote, it looks like that Turkey is on the side of ISIS.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  Close quote.
[37:41.000 --> 37:50.000]  Well, the next day the Russians released satellite photos documenting that there are literally thousands of trucks coming up to the border at these huge terminals
[37:50.000 --> 37:56.000]  connected to Irgun, the president's son, making billions of dollars total off of this.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  Again, you're in trouble for saying the sky is blue.
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  Well, I was right about that. I was right in saying in a book that I wrote, you covered it really nicely.
[38:04.000 --> 38:05.000]  I appreciate it.
[38:05.000 --> 38:10.000]  But I wrote a very political book years ago in the year 2000, The America We Deserve.
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  And I said to that book that we better be careful with this guy named Osama bin Laden.
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.000]  I mean, I really study this stuff.
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  I really find it very interesting.
[38:17.000 --> 38:23.000]  And even though I'm a businessman, I find it, I've always said, I've always been involved in politics.
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  I said, we better be careful with Osama bin Laden.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  There's a guy named Osama bin Laden.
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  Nobody really knew who he was, but he was nasty.
[38:29.000 --> 38:33.000]  He was saying really nasty things about our country and what he wants to do to it.
[38:33.000 --> 38:38.000]  And I wrote in the book 2000, two years before the World Trade Center came down, I talked about Osama bin Laden.
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  You better take him out.
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  I said, he's going to crawl under a rock. You better take him out.
[38:42.000 --> 38:48.000]  And now people are seeing that the saying, you know, Trump predicted Osama bin Laden, which actually is true.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  And then two years later, a year and a half later, he knocked down the World Trade Center.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  And I talked about terrorism and that that was before terrorism as we know it today.
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.000]  I said, we better be careful. That's going to happen. It's going to be a big thing. And it certainly is a big thing.
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  So with the oil, and I'm glad you brought it up.
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.000]  But as you know, for three years, I've been saying, you better take out the oil because if you don't take the oil, it's going to be a problem.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  So we shouldn't have been in Iraq.
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.000]  But once we got there, the way we came out was horrible.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  And I said, take the oil. Then we didn't take the oil.
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  So ISIS got the oil.
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  And as you know, Iran is getting the oil because Iran is going to take over all of Iraq.
[39:23.000 --> 39:32.000]  You know, we made one of the worst deals in the history of our world when we gave them $150 billion and virtually we gave them keys to nuclear weapons.
[39:32.000 --> 39:33.000]  One of the most.
[39:33.000 --> 39:39.000]  Mr. Trump, I hate to interrupt you. You are the leading presidential front runner with the Republicans gaining a huge lead as you don't back down.
[39:39.000 --> 39:45.000]  But I've got to just back you up again because the more I research what you've actually said and done, it's amazing.
[39:45.000 --> 39:55.000]  You were the only leading American figure who openly said, do not go to war in Iraq. They had almost what 90% votes in Congress for it by partisan.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  You said, don't do it. Iran will take over.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  You said, I mean, look, you can say that today and everybody can say that.
[40:01.000 --> 40:09.000]  But you said that in 2001, 2002, 2003, when it was very unpopular because you've done your research and had good advisors.
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  How did you know that when almost no one else did?
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  Well, first of all, I'm the most militaristic person there is. I'm going to build the military.
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  If I win, I'm going to make our military so strong, so powerful that nobody's going to mess with us.
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.000]  We're going to take care of our vets and all of that.
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.000]  But I have to tell you, you have to know if you're going to go to war, you have to do it properly and you have to know what to do.
[40:27.000 --> 40:33.000]  I view it as this. Iran and Iraq were the same in terms of strength and they had constantly fighting.
[40:33.000 --> 40:39.000]  That's all they do is they fight, right? They go to war all the time and they'd move 10 feet left, 10 feet right, 10 feet left.
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  Then they'd rest and then they started again four years later.
[40:42.000 --> 40:45.000]  This has been gone on forever.
[40:45.000 --> 40:52.000]  And this is the way it is. I said, if you take out Iran or if you take out Iraq, either one, you're going to destabilize the Middle East.
[40:52.000 --> 40:58.000]  Well, we took out Iraq. And by the way, Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world.
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  People don't even know that. So we gave like incredible.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  We took out Iraq. I said, you're going to destabilize.
[41:03.000 --> 41:12.000]  Well, and I said, and you'll know this, and you know this, and I appreciate what you just said, then Iran is going to come in and Iran is going to take over Iraq.
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  And they're just taking it over right now. As we speak, they're taking it over.
[41:16.000 --> 41:24.000]  Iran is running Iraq and very soon will be virtually going to be totally running Iraq, especially after all of the deal we just made, which is the worst.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  So I said, keep the oil.
[41:26.000 --> 41:33.000]  And I said, if you're going to leave, you shouldn't have gone in, but they should have left soldiers behind like 20,000 or a certain number of soldiers.
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  But if you're going to leave, take the oil. And I've said it.
[41:36.000 --> 41:42.000]  Then they left. They didn't take the oil. So ISIS got the oil. Iran is getting the oil. Everybody's getting everything but us.
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  So we lost thousands of soldiers. We spent $2 trillion in Iraq.
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  We have wounded warriors who I love all over the place. And what do we get out of it?
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  We had nothing. We had nothing.
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.000]  No, the French and the Germans are getting the oil and the Iranians are getting the oil.
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.000]  And you know who the number one customer for the oil is? Guess what? China.
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.000]  That's right.
[42:00.000 --> 42:06.000]  How smart is China? They are smartest on every level militarily. They are smartest on trade like we're losing.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  We have a $450 billion trade deficit with China.
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  Let me ask you this. You're a top business guy, you know, on your own from nothing.
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.000]  How did China get 97% of rare earth minerals in the world?
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  How is the United States or nobody else even trying to get rare earth minerals?
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  When it's what goes in the smart phones, the computers, trillions is made a year.
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  How did we just give them the global market in that? That's crazy.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  Well, what a lot of people don't know, Afghanistan.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  Now, Afghanistan is a place we can go in because, you know, you have Pakistan and you have nuclear weapons.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  A lot of things going on there. But we go into Afghanistan.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  We're fighting, you know, tremendous mountains and ridges. We're fighting on one side.
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  And, you know, who's got their excavators on the other side? China is looking out all the minerals.
[42:49.000 --> 42:54.000]  You know, Afghanistan, nobody knew this. Afghanistan is rich with minerals, not oil, but minerals.
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  Lithium, everything.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  And China is taking out all the minerals. And here we are fighting.
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.000]  We have trillions, we have about like a trillion dollars in Afghanistan and we get nothing out of it.
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  And we're going to end up leaving and keeping a couple of thousand soldiers there and this and that.
[43:07.000 --> 43:10.000]  We get nothing. China is taking out the minerals.
[43:10.000 --> 43:18.000]  They're the buyers, the big buyers at very, very low prices of, as you know, of the oil in Iraq and probably in Syria.
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  But China is a big buyer of the oil. But one thing with the oil, because you've covered it,
[43:23.000 --> 43:29.000]  for three years I've been saying, hit the oil because ISIS is getting strong and they're no JV, as the president said.
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.000]  And they're certainly not contained. But I said, hit the oil and hit them hard.
[43:33.000 --> 43:38.000]  And they left at me. And they would put generals on television saying, no, that strategy wouldn't work.
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.000]  Well, after Paris, they started hitting the oil and it does work.
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  The problem is we've given them a two-year edge. They have billions of dollars.
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.000]  The Russians started hitting the oil for one month and ISIS is already rolling over.
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.000]  So Putin is following your strategy. You know Vladimir Putin well.
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  It was just two years ago, Alex. That's the only problem.
[43:55.000 --> 44:01.000]  Donald Trump joins us live. Can you speak to, as president, what your relationship would be with foreign leaders
[44:01.000 --> 44:07.000]  and what you know about Vladimir Putin? Because all I know is, why are we starting a fight with Russia when they're not doing anything to us?
[44:07.000 --> 44:12.000]  Right. Well, number one, and just to finish on the other way, I say hit the oil, but we should keep the oil.
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.000]  In other words, we should keep. We'll get ExxonMobil. They'll go in. We'll get other of our oil companies.
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.000]  We'll get some of the great oil companies. We bid it out. We should keep the oil.
[44:20.000 --> 44:23.000]  You know, in the old days to the victor belong to spoils, right? We don't have that.
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  We go in. We fight a war and we leave. We get nothing except we get death and we get deficit. That's all we get.
[44:29.000 --> 44:33.000]  I think I get along great with people. I mean, I will probably get along well with him.
[44:33.000 --> 44:39.000]  And if I don't, somebody else will. And who knows? You know, he's a difficult cookie. He's tough and he's smart.
[44:39.000 --> 44:46.000]  I was on the show 60 minutes with him recently, not together. I mean, they did him and they profiled me at the same show, which was there.
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.000]  We were stablemates, right? But I think I'd get along very well with him. I think it's too fine.
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.000]  Look, here's the thing. We lose with every country, and yet we don't get along with any countries.
[44:55.000 --> 45:00.000]  China is killing us. Everybody's killing us. China is just beating us to a pulp and trade.
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.000]  Japan, Mexico is killing us. And yet we don't get along with anybody.
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.000]  With me, they're not going to get so rich. Believe me, they're not going to get so rich at all.
[45:08.000 --> 45:12.000]  We're going to take back our jobs. We're going to take back our manufacturing. We take back our base.
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.000]  But they'll like us more than they do now. Sort of amazing.
[45:16.000 --> 45:20.000]  Well, Donald Trump, let me say this. My audience, I'd say 90% support you.
[45:20.000 --> 45:26.000]  Okay. And you definitely have shown your knowledge of geopolitical systems.
[45:26.000 --> 45:31.000]  Hillary and others have been demonizing you for saying radical Muslims celebrated on 9-11.
[45:31.000 --> 45:37.000]  But she got caught a few years ago claiming that she got shot at in Bosnia in the air on the ground.
[45:37.000 --> 45:42.000]  They have video that all none of it happened. She admits she lied. If you did that, you'd be done.
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.000]  But you wouldn't do something like that. You don't steal glory from our veterans.
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.000]  But they demonize you for made up scandals every day, trying to see what'll stick.
[45:50.000 --> 45:55.000]  And you got Hillary involved in Benghazi. You've got them involved in everything.
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  And people love you for tough talk. Is it not time for impeachment hearings against Obama?
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  I mean, what do we do politically to really try to prosecute Hillary Clinton?
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.000]  Well, you remember this. The best thing that we have going with Obama is he's got a year left.
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.000]  Okay. Because, you know, by the time you do the hearings and everything, I don't...
[46:13.000 --> 46:14.000]  So don't make him a martyr.
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  In a way, you'll make him a martyr. But I don't even say that.
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.000]  You know, one of the things that I'm the most disappointed in Republicans because they go to Washington.
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  They're going to do all this stuff. They're going to impeach Obama. They're going to end Obamacare,
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.000]  which has to be ended. I don't know if you've seen the premiums.
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  It's killing everything.
[46:30.000 --> 46:38.000]  55%. It's going to implode anyway. In 2017, Obamacare blows up. It's over.
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  I mean, it's over. And everybody knows it. And they're doing big stories.
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.000]  Even the ones that were for it are saying, uh-oh, this isn't working.
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  Well, the premiums are a disaster.
[46:46.000 --> 46:50.000]  And if you look at anything having to do with Obamacare right now, it's over.
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  But the problem with the Republicans is they'll try and fix it.
[46:54.000 --> 47:00.000]  They'll try, instead of get rid of it, and we can come up with a phenomenal plan that's much better for the people.
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.000]  The people are getting killed with that.
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.000]  So there's so many things to do, Alex. We will do such a good job.
[47:06.000 --> 47:09.000]  There's so many fronts. A number will win on trade.
[47:09.000 --> 47:12.000]  We're going to strengthen our military. We're going to take care of our vets.
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.000]  We're going to get rid of Obamacare. We're going to do so many things.
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.000]  There's so many things that can be done, but we have to use our good people.
[47:18.000 --> 47:23.000]  You know, everybody running against me in terms of even the Republican side, and Hillary certainly,
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.000]  they're all controlled by their donors and their special interests and the lobbyists.
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.000]  I'm putting up my own money. I'm funding my own campaign.
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.000]  Nobody's going to control me. I'm going to do what's right for you and for the American people.
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.000]  Listen, I get it. I mean, you are a true Maverick. I understand.
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  You made tens of millions of dollars. You've hired tens of thousands of people.
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  I mean, I would imagine that as you've gotten older, correct me if I'm wrong,
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  because I know you talked about wanting to serve America decades ago.
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.000]  Really, all it comes down to is wanting to have a free country for your children and grandchildren.
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  And that's where I want to come to this point next, because I know you're smart, sir.
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  And I know that you also, though, you don't dumb your message down, but you keep it at a mid-level,
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  so the general public and the establishment as well can get it.
[48:04.000 --> 48:12.000]  But let's get down to brass tacks. I routinely talk to the top generals, special forces,
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.000]  Pentagon currently, out of the Pentagon, CIA, as I know you do, and we'll just leave it at that.
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.000]  There are a lot of people in this government and also retired who don't want to destroy the country.
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.000]  They really know that we've reached the crossroads where the country's done as a third-world nation within a few more years.
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  Forget Donald Trump in four years if this happens. We're done.
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  I mean, we're talking about resurrecting the dead here.
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.000]  We could turn it around right now. As you've said properly, you're dead on, sir. You're right.
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.000]  We could turn it around. All the actuaries, all the numbers show it, but it's got to happen the next few years,
[48:40.000 --> 48:44.000]  and we're done. And there are globalists that want to have a world government,
[48:44.000 --> 48:49.000]  a system run by select crony capitalists using socialism at the grassroots to make people dependent.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  And I've talked to not just high-level folks that have been in government that are on your team,
[48:53.000 --> 48:59.000]  but separately high-level people in government currently that say there's an internal war going on
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.000]  and that you're a manifestation of that. I don't want to get anything inside baseball with you,
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  but I already know the inside baseball.
[49:05.000 --> 49:10.000]  I know now from top people that you actually are for real and you understand you're in danger
[49:10.000 --> 49:16.000]  and you understand what you're doing is epic. It's George Washington level and you understand that office.
[49:16.000 --> 49:21.000]  So I want to tell you right now, can you speak about the war for the soul of this country that's happening right now
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.000]  and really tell people what's happening and commit to people that you won't Ross Perot under death threats
[49:26.000 --> 49:31.000]  and step down when you're in the lead two months from the election?
[49:31.000 --> 49:37.000]  Okay, so let me just tell you, Alex, as you know, I'm leading in every pole nationally in every pole state.
[49:37.000 --> 49:41.000]  I'm leading in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, the SEC, Texas.
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  I'm leading in Texas, which I love. I love Texas.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  You know, we were there. Mark Cuban called up. He said, do you want to use the arena?
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  I used it. We filled it up in three or four days, 20,000 people in Mobile, Alabama.
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.000]  We had 35,000 people. We had 20,000 in Oklahoma.
[49:55.000 --> 50:01.000]  I'm so into this and I'm not into it. You know, I could do other things that I would enjoy doing, to be honest with you.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  No, you're doing a dangerous mission. We understand that.
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.000]  It's not an easy thing, but the key is make America great again. We can make America great again.
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.000]  But if you have to suffer through four more or eight more years of what's gone on in the past and, you know, what's going,
[50:13.000 --> 50:21.000]  it's just we're being eaten away. It's just eat. It's eating away at our country and we can make, in my opinion,
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  we can make America greater than ever before, but we have to get going. It has to happen. We have to get going.
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  And, you know, when you look at the vision, I said, Iraq, you agreed with me on Iraq.
[50:31.000 --> 50:37.000]  I said, hit the oil. I said a lot of things that turned out to be true, 100% true.
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  And I'm giving credit. I'm giving credit by some people. Some people refuse to acknowledge it.
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.000]  You know, they refuse to say.
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  No, you've been, you've been, you've been absolutely on target.
[50:44.000 --> 50:49.000]  So what I'm asking is, though, can you speak to the crossroads we're at right now, though, because you've talked about it.
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.000]  Are we at a crossroads to decide whether this country is done or whether we go to the next level?
[50:53.000 --> 51:00.000]  Well, I think this, I think that it's, sadly, I think that if we don't get it right this time, I think this is going to be the most important election our country's ever had.
[51:00.000 --> 51:05.000]  I mean, you'd have to say George Washington was right there, you know, the couple of pretty important elections, right?
[51:05.000 --> 51:11.000]  But this is certainly in the last, in the modern era, this is the most important election election our country's ever had.
[51:11.000 --> 51:18.000]  If we don't get it right, if we put another one of these people in like Hillary, I mean, she, she's so corrupt.
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  And she shouldn't even be allowed to run.
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  And frankly, her greatest legacy, she was a horrible secretary of state.
[51:25.000 --> 51:30.000]  If she's, if she runs, I think her greatest legacy will be that she got out of the email scandal.
[51:30.000 --> 51:31.000]  That's what I think.
[51:31.000 --> 51:41.000]  It'll be one of the greatest jobs I've ever seen of getting out of a scandal because General Petraeus and many others, I mean, their lives have been destroyed for doing 5% of what she did.
[51:41.000 --> 51:42.000]  That's right.
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.000]  She shouldn't be allowed to run.
[51:43.000 --> 51:50.000]  But, you know, the recent Fox poll that just came down two days ago has been beating her head to head, which is very interesting and very good.
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  And beating her soundly head to head.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  But we have to get it right.
[51:54.000 --> 51:57.000]  Our country can be absolutely, we can turn it around.
[51:57.000 --> 52:07.000]  But I would agree with you if we don't get it right this time, I'm not sure if you go another four or eight years with the insanity and the stupidity of these leaders.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  I'm not sure you're going to be able to turn it around anymore.
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  I think it could be.
[52:10.000 --> 52:18.000]  Right. Donald Trump, the man in the arena, his new book, we're going to talk about the moment, is exposing the fact this country is being sabotaged by design.
[52:18.000 --> 52:21.000]  Specifically, I don't want to bring up detractors.
[52:21.000 --> 52:28.000]  And it's a question I had early on that I did more research and I understand that you really do want to save this country where your children and grandchildren live.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  But let's expand on this.
[52:30.000 --> 52:35.000]  There are certain pundits out there saying you played golf with Bill Clinton.
[52:35.000 --> 52:41.000]  And so you had to do business in New York, so you said nice things about Hillary.
[52:41.000 --> 52:44.000]  I get teeping your enemies closer when you're not in politics.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  I get it. I understand.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  I think that's what you did.
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  But tell us specifically, and I don't think this now.
[52:49.000 --> 52:50.000]  I've seen it.
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  I know you're for real.
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.000]  You wouldn't be saying the things you're doing.
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  They're scared of you.
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  The whole system's coming out against you.
[52:54.000 --> 53:05.000]  But promise us that you're not going to drop out at the key moment, keeping all the other Republicans out of view, and then Hillary races to the head, or Jeb Bush does.
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  Because as you know, folks are claiming you're a Clinton operative.
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  You know, I've never heard that.
[53:10.000 --> 53:15.000]  I've heard it actually a few months ago, but I've hit her harder than anybody times 10 if you look at it.
[53:15.000 --> 53:16.000]  You have. You have.
[53:16.000 --> 53:17.000]  I was a businessman.
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  And I've only been a politician for five months.
[53:19.000 --> 53:22.000]  I hate to use the term because, you know, you're a statesman.
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  But I've just been doing this for a very short period of time.
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.000]  I was establishment.
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  You know, I was like a guy like you would say Trump is total establishment.
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  And I was a big donor to a lot of different Republicans.
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  But over the years, I've given to Democrats.
[53:35.000 --> 53:36.000]  I've given to Republicans.
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  I've given everybody because I had an obligation.
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  I was a businessman.
[53:39.000 --> 53:42.000]  One of the magazines recently called me a world-class businessman.
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  The truth is, I did.
[53:43.000 --> 53:51.000]  I built an unbelievable company, a tremendous assets, tremendous, not only that iconic assets, very little debt, tremendous cash flow.
[53:51.000 --> 53:52.000]  It's a great company.
[53:52.000 --> 53:56.000]  And by the way, people now see how good when I did the filing, everyone said, oh, I'll never file, I'll never file.
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  It's almost 100 pages long and it's an unbelievable company.
[54:00.000 --> 54:05.000]  So I built it, which, by the way, the reason I say that, that's the kind of thinking our country needs.
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  But I got along great with Clinton.
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  I got along great with Harry Reid.
[54:09.000 --> 54:14.000]  I get along great with everybody because when I needed them, I didn't want to have argument.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  I didn't want to have somebody say, well, Clinton doesn't want it to happen.
[54:16.000 --> 54:17.000]  You're not a loser.
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  You don't get in mindless fights.
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  You move forward with your agenda.
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.000]  But now you see America in trouble and you're, hey, that's all sidelined now.
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  Donald Trump's not working for Donald Trump.
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.000]  He wants to work for America.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  Yeah.
[54:28.000 --> 54:31.000]  As a businessman, you could have even functioned if you don't get along.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  Example, in New York City, it's 95% Democrat.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  I mean, if I didn't get along with the Democrats, I wouldn't have one.
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.000]  Well, I'll tell you, I mean, you did want the vice president, you know, a position that's come out decades ago behind the scenes.
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  I mean, I know you're a Republican.
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.000]  What about libertarianism?
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  What's your view of libertarianism?
[54:47.000 --> 54:52.000]  And then I want to ask you, who's your favorite president and who do you think your running mate might be?
[54:52.000 --> 54:53.000]  Folks think it's Ted Cruz.
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  Well, I think that libertarianism is sort of interesting.
[54:56.000 --> 55:01.000]  There are certain things that I really like about it, but, you know, keeping government out as much as possible.
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  We need government for protection.
[55:03.000 --> 55:04.000]  We have to protect.
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.000]  When you look at these maniacs in the Middle East that want to destroy us.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  And, you know, the problem we have today, Alex, is the weaponry.
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  If this were 100 years ago, I'd say forget about them.
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  Let them keep fighting.
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.000]  They've been fighting all their lives.
[55:14.000 --> 55:15.000]  Let them keep fighting each other.
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.000]  Who cares?
[55:16.000 --> 55:22.000]  But the weaponry is so powerful and they hate us so much that we have to now protect.
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  So that's a big part of government.
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  So there's a certain common sense to certain elements.
[55:26.000 --> 55:31.000]  And I did very well with the libertarians, frankly, you know, because they sort of get it and they get me.
[55:31.000 --> 55:36.000]  But we need bigger strength than I think the libertarians really want.
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.000]  And we need it.
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  And we have to have it.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  We have to have it.
[55:39.000 --> 55:40.000]  If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  If we don't have borders, we're not going to have a country.
[55:42.000 --> 55:47.000]  As far as running mate, it's too soon to say I actually respect a couple of people that are on the stage.
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  Some of them have absolutely no respect for there.
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.000]  I mean, I think they're not very good at all at what they do.
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  You look at what's going on.
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.000]  But I have respect for a number of people that are on the stage with me.
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.000]  I have respect for a lot of people that are throughout this country, you know, political people.
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  I'll pick somebody I think that can really be a great vice president.
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.000]  Ultimately has to be a great president because that's, you know, 90% of that function is, you know,
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  if something bad happens, they got to be a good president.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  You have to view it from that standpoint.
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  And my favorite president in the more or less modern era would be Ronald Reagan.
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  I've always liked him.
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  I helped him.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  And by the way, he was a Democrat.
[56:22.000 --> 56:23.000]  A lot of people don't know.
[56:23.000 --> 56:24.000]  He was.
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.000]  Some of a liberal Democrat, Alex, as you know, and he became a somewhat conservative,
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  I wouldn't say the most conservative, but a somewhat conservative Republican.
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  But he wanted to make America great.
[56:33.000 --> 56:34.000]  And he really did.
[56:34.000 --> 56:35.000]  He wanted to make.
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  He had actually, let's make America great.
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.000]  That was his and mine is make America great again.
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.000]  So there's a little bit of a difference.
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.000]  But my son, my son, you know, finally sold me on being a bigger supporter of yours.
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  And I liked you.
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.000]  Love Americana.
[56:47.000 --> 56:48.000]  You're pure Americana.
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.000]  But I'm still, you know, was research, but my 13 year old son's really smart.
[56:51.000 --> 56:52.000]  There's a lot of research.
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.000]  He, he watches all the debates.
[56:53.000 --> 56:54.000]  He just really loves you.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  He is on cloud nine that you're here.
[56:56.000 --> 56:57.000]  Rex Jones.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  And it was his question, you know, which president was your favorite?
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  But all time, all time.
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  Who's your favorite?
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  Well, all time.
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  I'd say Ronald Reagan.
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.000]  Short term.
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.000]  I would say, well, you know, you look at Lincoln, you look at Washington, you have to go with
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  they were there.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  The classics, right?
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  Alex, you know, you think in terms of the great classics, you have to go with the
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  Lincoln's and the Washington's.
[57:18.000 --> 57:19.000]  I agree.
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  The man's man.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  George Washington was badass.
[57:21.000 --> 57:22.000]  Yeah.
[57:22.000 --> 57:23.000]  That's what they say.
[57:23.000 --> 57:24.000]  I mean, that's what they say.
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  He said, they say he never told a lie.
[57:26.000 --> 57:27.000]  Let's hope that's true.
[57:27.000 --> 57:28.000]  Okay.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  But George Washington was pretty good.
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.000]  But we had some look, we had some great presidents and we had some good presidents on the other
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  side too, in all fairness, but we will hopefully be right at the top of that list.
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  We're going to make the country so strong and we're going to make it financially secure.
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  We can owe $21 trillion because it's going to be that.
[57:45.000 --> 57:46.000]  That's my final question.
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.000]  What type of an elite wants to clower and pivot and bankrupt the country so socialists
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  can run in and we all get handouts?
[57:52.000 --> 57:53.000]  What type of an elite is that?
[57:53.000 --> 57:54.000]  I mean, you've been around these people.
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  Are they mentally ill, Donald Trump?
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  Well, we have to make our country rich again.
[57:58.000 --> 58:04.000]  The other day I said to a woman, she came up to Mr. Trump at a big rally where we had
[58:04.000 --> 58:09.000]  14,000 people and at the end she just sees me and I'm signing autographs and stuff and
[58:09.000 --> 58:14.000]  she said, Mr. Trump, I'm voting for you 100%, but are you this whole concept of making it
[58:14.000 --> 58:15.000]  rich?
[58:15.000 --> 58:16.000]  It sounds so crass.
[58:16.000 --> 58:17.000]  I said, you know what?
[58:17.000 --> 58:20.000]  It might sound crass, but if we don't make our nation rich again, if we don't take back
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.000]  our jobs from all these other countries that are ripping us and if we don't take back our
[58:24.000 --> 58:29.000]  jobs and if we don't, you know, balance up our budget, at least get it damn close and
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  soon, we're not going to have a nation anymore.
[58:31.000 --> 58:32.000]  We're a third world country.
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  Donald Trump, you know, I know you've got to go.
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.000]  60-second break.
[58:35.000 --> 58:36.000]  I want to come back for just three minutes.

[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  And when we're under attack, our enemy media will tell us we're not.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  That's right.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  This Republic is under serious attack.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  You ever wanted to see how America and the West itself would fall?
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  How it would be deliberately crashed into the ashes of history?
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  You now have front row seats.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  The most dangerous place to be, though, is the West.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  The West is under serious attack.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  The West is under serious attack.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  The West is under serious attack.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  The West is under serious attack.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  The most dangerous place to be, though, is in the bleachers.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  The only chance we've got is getting on the field.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  Paul, I know you're churning out reports, analysis, you name it.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  You were reporting on the afternoon the guys' name.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  Michael Savage was reporting on it, Welett-Daly, on his show, hours before.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  I'm going to get Michael Savage on.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  I guide Michael Savage off and get his take on this.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  The attack is happening.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  They want to use the attack with one hand to take our freedoms and take our guns,
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  but on the other side, bring in the jihadis.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.680]  just too rich that you know he just went and got his bride Saudi Arabia and came
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.800]  back and the clerics have called for a jihad on America it's happening it's
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:51.360]  happening in Europe and it is a real radical attack but it is a false flag
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.360]  in that evidence is emerging they brought these people in they knew what
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.280]  they were going to do they're allowing them to attack us so somehow we've got
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.760]  to explain that not to our listeners but to the rest of the population that look
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.240]  a false flag doesn't just mean the government did it all but if the
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:10.440]  government brings them in then that's still a false flag right Paul well you
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:15.320]  remember Obama said why is everyone worried about Syrian orphans and
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:20.800]  mothers this accomplice in this attack this woman went and dumped her what
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.280]  six months old baby on a grandma before she went on this rampage so it's not
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.680]  whether their mothers or what a lot of these Islamic terrorists are women
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.760]  they're called black widows it's a known phenomenon Obama just said I mean look
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.720]  in Israel all the stabbings Obama just said a couple days ago again ISIS no
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:42.040]  threat in America yeah and the other the other thing is political correctness
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:46.360]  remember the Bryce William shooting of the TV reporters on air that was
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:51.280]  motivated by him alleging they made you know racist comments towards him now we
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:56.760]  have in this case the neighbors of this shooter Farouk who said they didn't
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.000]  report into authorities because they were afraid they'd be called racist
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.320]  because it was racial profiling even though they were seeing these package
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.520]  deliveries over and over again these odd deliveries other neighbors reported
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:12.440]  three to four Middle Easters Middle Easterners recently moved into the area
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.760]  CVS reported more neighbors who said they didn't say anything because they
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:21.720]  didn't want to racially profile these people so again the concerns of
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.760]  political correctness have been put above genuine rational security concerns
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:30.800]  and it's it's wound up with 14 people dead just as it did with the Bryce
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.600]  William situation start being jihad attacks in the West every week Paul and
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.640]  I've been saying this for months it's happening they I think they've jumped the
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.680]  shark I think they've gone too far doubling down and saying there's no such
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:47.640]  thing as Islamic terror they're not going to get away with this
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:52.440]  well obviously it can be defeated by waffling on about climate change in
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.360]  front of the UN your president is actually now saying that on a weekly
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:00.720]  basis that's how ludicrous it's become and then the other thing was Trump and
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.920]  these other Republicans Ted Cruz tweeted out you know all our prayers are with
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:09.040]  the victims of the San Bernardino attack and then the left and the media and the
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.520]  New York Daily News said prayer for the victims is not going to fix this only
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.880]  complete gun control is going to fix this so they actually basically crapped
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:21.440]  upon everyone who just said this is really terrible I'm praying for the
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.720]  victims to push their gun control agenda as soon as it came out it wasn't a
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:31.240]  white Christian conservative that all collapsed again so you know this has
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:34.440]  been really embarrassing for the left and it proves they will exploit
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:39.160]  feverishly anything before the bodies are called to push this radical gun
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.600]  control because they have this irrational hatred of freedom and a
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:47.320]  rational hatred of the Republic and the irrational hatred of the family they
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:52.560]  really are a sick cult of scum who want total global power and want to carbon
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.520]  taxes Paul continue the great work at info wars.com and prison planet.com
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:01.440]  we'll be back despite all the status rhetoric that gun control works here's
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.680]  five reasons why it won't number one California has many of the most
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.680]  restrictive gun laws in the country yet those laws did absolutely nothing to
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:12.280]  stop the San Bernardino shooting number two Paris France also has some of the
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.600]  most restrictive gun laws in the world but those laws also did nothing to stop
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.600]  November 13th ISIS attacks number three it's estimated that someone in
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.720]  Chicago is shot every 2.8 hours despite the city's strict gun laws number four
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:29.840]  Mexico also has restrictive gun laws just like Chicago yet over 160,000 people
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.680]  have been murdered in the country's drug war since 2007 the only people who are
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.280]  actually stopping the Mexican cartels are private citizens who are openly
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:41.240]  defined Mexico's gun laws to form self-defense malicious number five
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:45.000]  president Obama has been arming and funding ISIS link Syrian rebels for
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.080]  quite some time in fact Obama approved the rearming of these so-called moderate
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:53.120]  rebels on October 1st the same day he called for gun control in response to
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:56.320]  the community college shooting up in Oregon you can find out more at info

[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:07.480]  most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be

[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:23.880]  we're down to the second hour until about 40 after so we've got a really amazing
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:27.200]  guest extremely informative and and also in this day and age there's a lot of
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:31.920]  courage to engage in the First Amendment John Coleman meteorologist the
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:35.280]  original National Weatherman on Good Morning America the founder of the
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:38.280]  Weather Channel we're talking to him in a moment but obviously everybody's
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:46.480]  focused on the dead the 14 dead in San Bernardino and just minutes ago during
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.400]  the break I was watching CNN and their supposed coverage of a live press
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:53.800]  conference of the FBI and others and they're getting up they're saying too
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:09:00.080]  early to say it's terrorism don't say it's terror okay they the police now say
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:06.000]  they had a bomb factory at their house basically suicide vest tactical gear go
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.080]  pros to videotape the killing that Jihadis do you know they said for four
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:15.720]  years the Fort Hood shooter Major Hassan was not Jihad of course he talked to the
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.120]  head of Al Qaeda said he was gonna do it it was a Jihad they've now admitted
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:23.640]  that the attack on the Marine Corps were a recruiting center and those killed
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:27.720]  they said oh no this isn't Islamic terror of course it was they couldn't say
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:33.240]  that about Paris though they tried or Charlie Hebdo of the rest of it so this
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:37.120]  is happening this guy had brought his bride into the country NBC News is saying
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:41.480]  maybe maybe he was triggered by the Christmas party in a Christmas tree we
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.400]  even have a clip of that coming up after our guest leaves us but this is sick
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:54.360]  folks this is getting sicker and sicker and sicker by the minute that when we
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.440]  get attacked by these folks there's such political correctness that even
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.480]  neighbors have admitted well we didn't want to report because they were Islamic
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:05.800]  that we saw suspicious things going on well they've now been killed in a hail
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:10.960]  of gunfire with the police obviously in a chase yesterday and the answer by the
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:15.680]  control left is we the people should turn our guns in so we can be safe from
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:24.680]  the Jihadis that they're now reporting somehow got police issued weapons so to
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:27.480]  get this straight for the mainstream media I'm not saying the government did
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:31.920]  this and it's a false flag I'm saying the Obama administration letting this guy
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:35.960]  come in with his radicalized wife protecting people Hollande opening the
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:41.320]  French borders all of this they are directly connected to allowing this to
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:46.120]  happen and are aiding and abetting it we now have the Detroit police chief coming
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.560]  out today and saying armed citizens deter terrorist attacks in Detroit police
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:54.440]  chief says and the head of Interpol said where they have gun control in Kenya he
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.000]  said we should arm the Kenyans that's how we answer these terrorist attacks
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.720]  against Jihadis now shifting gears to John Coleman founder of the weather
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:09.440]  channel on cable television Coleman was also the original weather caster on the
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.840]  ABC network morning program good morning America for many years he was a full
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.960]  professional member of the American Meteorological Society is meteorologist
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.840]  obviously and was once honored as broadcast meteorologist the year Coleman
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:26.360]  had a 61-year career in television extending from the campaign of from
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:32.440]  Champaign Illinois to Milwaukee Chicago New York City and Coleman has become a
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:36.320]  very active in his efforts to counter the global warming climate change frenzy
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.120]  his studies of the climate data convinced him that there is no significant
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:44.720]  man-made global warming and his beloved science meteorology has been hijacked by
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.840]  a cadre of politicians environmentalist and the scientists who they
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.880]  generously fund to provide scientific papers supporting their failed theory and
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:58.040]  boy has that really been proven true now with hide the decline climate gate it's
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:01.720]  about a global tax and as Vladimir Putin said it's about shutting down
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:06.000]  industrial nations and letting other nations operate China can operate India
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:12.160]  can operate but we can't John Coleman blog dot com is his website sir thank
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:15.880]  you so much for coming on with us and your your tireless work you know now
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:20.400]  they call for arresting people in Europe who question man-made climate change
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:25.240]  just now climate change not warming and they're even talking about it in America
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.840]  going after people for their speech they're doing an investigation as you
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:35.240]  know I would imagine in New York State this Alex a great risk I have my
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:40.160]  Christmas tree up in my living room here in San Diego just a hundred miles from
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:47.600]  San Bernardino history and is it gonna stimulate someone to attack me I think
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:53.840]  not because for the most part we're peaceful you're right we certainly have
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:59.920]  some strange and awful people among us and those events such as happening in
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:05.920]  San Bernardino touch our hearts believe me and keep us alert because we know
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:11.080]  that any day something can happen absolutely it is a sick testament that
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:14.200]  you have to you know we make a comment about having an offensive evil
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:20.080]  beautiful Christmas tree in fact I want to say you're quite nice my wife and I
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.520]  decorated that yesterday and enjoyed it a lot but but she made me turn off the
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:28.480]  San Bernardino February so we're decorating and I think she was right
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:34.240]  about that enjoy Christmas as much as you can now while I'm enjoying Christmas
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:42.360]  over in Paris they are a hundred eighty five nations can you imagine 40,000
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:49.960]  people gathered all over bad science a totally false premise and just mean
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:55.000]  nothing I want to show you the man who passed away about five days ago Maurice
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:01.040]  strong Maurice is the man behind this you ever heard of him Alex I have but a
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:05.280]  lot of folks have it tell us all about him well Maurice was a son of an oil
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:10.720]  Baron in Canada interestingly enough but the other side of him was he was a
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:15.800]  one-world Chinese guy he joined the United Nations as an undersecretary and
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:20.960]  he wanted us to have a one-world government and when he saw how Al Gore
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.480]  was succeeding with climate change then global warming in the United States he
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:33.200]  snapped onto that and he threw the first international Earth Day in Stockholm
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:40.160]  action 72 and out of that was able to grow the United Nations intergovernmental
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:45.600]  panel on climate change so that big meeting in Paris are we strong started
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:53.720]  it he was the man he made it happen and he was his and if you look at interviews
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:59.080]  with him he said that he was looking for a way to create one-world government that
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:06.240]  was his plan and by using global warming he was going to tax the rich nations of
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:13.000]  the world to pay the poor nations of the world and create this one equal nation
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.480]  of the world the world global government so Maurice strong this was his
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:24.560]  life's work well he passed away four days before this giant event began in
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:29.800]  Paris but he had already been retired because he got caught with his hands in
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:36.400]  the cookie jar during the oil for food thing following the war in Afghanistan
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:41.400]  when he suddenly a check for about nine hundred thousand dollars to him from the
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:48.680]  UN showed up and he said oh yeah and retired to Shanghai or Beijing I've seen
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:54.840]  both and that's where he passed away in the last few days so he created this
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:59.840]  great United Nations global warming frenzy and now we have a hundred and
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:06.160]  eighty five nations of negotiating and negotiations as usual have run into a
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:13.600]  snag because the rich nations who have to pour the pay the the poor nations are
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.520]  holding backs a little and the poor they want some money from the poor nations
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.040]  the poor nations have waited a minute you give us the money guys so we'll see how
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:28.600]  this whole thing comes out in Paris in any case it's all because of so-called
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:32.920]  global warming well did you know there hasn't been any global warming of any
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:39.720]  significance in almost 20 years so there are young people now 19 years old
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:45.320]  married having children maybe in the military college graduates 19 years old
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:50.800]  and during their lifetimes the earth is not really warm that is an amazing
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:56.680]  amazing thing there's those little ups and downs in that chart see them there
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:03.040]  of that warming but that warming is is that those those ups and downs are a
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:09.480]  tenth of a degree that's not degrees that's even hundreds of a degree so now
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:14.800]  we have such political silliness that if the temperature peaks up just a little
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:19.920]  bit right let's say two hundredths of a degree suddenly they start screaming
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:26.320]  that is the warmest it ever was well that's sheer and total nonsense first of
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:32.160]  all think about when I was a kid I'm 81 years old when I was a kid a thermometer
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:37.840]  was a little stick of wood with a little tube of mercury attached to it and the
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:42.720]  best you could possibly read the temperature was within one or two degrees
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:49.560]  I mean its accuracy was pretty questionable and now they're telling us we
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:54.200]  have records because of hundreds of a degree you got to be kidding if you're
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:58.200]  looking at the pattern over let's say the last thousand years temperatures have
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:02.600]  gone up and down we had the medieval warm period we have the little ice age
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:07.640]  and you see that little squiggle on the extreme right-hand side of your screen
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:13.440]  the last little red squiggle on this chart that's the warming of the 20th
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:19.960]  century and of the 21st century it is nothing it is insignificant and it is
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:23.800]  far less than the medieval warm period and they're telling us is the warmest
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:29.200]  earth has ever been you know why that is they've manipulated the data it's an
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:33.680]  amazing thing and we even caught them with the Copenhagen documents we even
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.600]  caught them with the hide-the-decline emails but they are so committed to
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:42.720]  this that they just continue to move forward well they do whatever they can
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:50.000]  it's it's a screaming outrage this is our federal government Noah the
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.640]  national of the service at his national data climate center down in
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:19:00.160]  Charleston South Carolina they these people have manipulated the temperatures
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:06.080]  four times and in the process they have made the past cooler so the president
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.960]  is comparatively warmer only by degree or two but enough for them to scream and
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.920]  holler about global warming now the whole thing Alex is blamed on what
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:21.160]  the bedrock do you know to you got it right friend I know you're very well
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:27.000]  informed man by the way oh my wife and I visited both Austin and San Antonio last
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.280]  year wonderful beautiful cities a great place to live but if you look at the
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:40.360]  long-term temperatures and CO2 of planet Earth as determined by the ice cores
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:46.480]  dug near and then article in the South Pole you find that the CO2 has been up
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:51.400]  and down and it tends to follow temperatures not vice versa over CO2
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.960]  doesn't drive the temperatures up the temperatures cause the CO2. Sure and in
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:00.520]  Al Gore's film this was found in British court for those that don't know that he
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:04.800]  had flipped basically where he has temperature following CO2 and I
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.080]  understand that you're a top meteorologist John Coleman founder of the
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:12.400]  weather channel John Coleman blog.com a lot of my listeners are informed they
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.720]  know you all about you what you've done your tireless work and I want to get
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:20.400]  into the more of the science with you but specifically though back to Maury
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:25.960]  Strong the David Rockefeller the UN if they can tax carbon they can track all
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:31.160]  human activity they can selectively pick winners and losers general electric
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:36.840]  by Obama was given as you know 2000 plus waivers to operate coal power plants
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:41.520]  the last seven years their competitors weren't they had to shut down so this is
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.000]  all about raw power and and what you explained earlier so key they're making
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.920]  a bunch of money and getting power out of this it's not like they're well
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:53.840]  meaning misguided idiot liberals who want to save the earth and are just
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:59.560]  worried about CO2 this is their way of taxing and controlling the entire
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:05.240]  carbon cycle and they're trying to ram through these global treaties to do it
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:09.000]  and I really think you know the diabolical nature of that needs to be
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.440]  exposed well I'm shocked when Al Gore is put on television and no one calls him
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:22.240]  to task when he screams about tons and tons of carbons viewing into the
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:29.560]  atmosphere that's your nonsense what we are emitting is yes tons and tons of
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:36.840]  carbon dioxide and odorless tasteless invisible gas that is essential to life
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:41.880]  and it's a trace I've been in the atmosphere forever and man has contributed
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:47.920]  just a tiny amount to it and it's still less than one half of one percent well
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:51.840]  sir you're the expert on this but I've had astrophysicist on I've had historians
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:56.400]  on during the warmer periods going back over hundreds of thousands of years
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:01.320]  it's a boom time for plants animals humans we see the booms and civilization
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:07.720]  during these warming periods and also CO2 has been much higher in our history
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:12.000]  and is associated with higher oxygen levels plants growing better better
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.360]  health I mean is it the earth if you look back over the last thousand years
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:21.480]  from ice core samples actually in a CO2 starved position isn't CO2 a tiny trace
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:27.920]  cash absolutely and yes we desperately need more not less here in southern
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:32.520]  California where I live they prompt CO2 and large quantities into the green
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:37.280]  houses in order to make the flowers grow fast you know we supply all those
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:41.960]  flowers for the whole nation your Christmas and Thanksgiving buffet is all
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:48.200]  from greenhouses here loaded with carbon dioxide CO2 I have a friend who is a
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:54.080]  great submariner and set many records in his submarining days and he tells me
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:23:00.240]  that on their subs they took the CO2 up to five thousand parts per million no
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:05.840]  problem they did it all the time and they thrived on my friend Craig it's so
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:12.520]  over in the Phoenix area he uses CO2 to prove the plants grow faster he grows
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:18.800]  plants with low CO2 and high CO2 and those with high CO2 the trees grow feet
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:23.200]  higher than those that don't have it and since we have been putting a little
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:28.680]  more CO2 into the atmosphere crops grow better there's more food for the world's
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:34.920]  core or our plants grow better and the plants put off more oxygen too the earth
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:43.760]  is 20% greener Alex it's amazing it is amazing so what are we gonna do about
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:51.640]  this great need for more CO2 in the earth we're gonna keep growing using our
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:57.080]  fossil fuels understand CO2 comes from the exhaustive fossil fuels burn so our
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:02.400]  jet aircraft our cars and trucks all cause it now they have taxed CO2 already
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:07.200]  particularly here in California but to some extent nationally US CO2 is down
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:12.240]  10% in the last decade as you know the average American family is now paying
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:20.160]  more than $1,200 a year more for their food products for their energy for
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:25.160]  everything and that's a lot of money for a poor family and under the plans of the
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:30.760]  Obama administration that's going to go up to about $4,500 a year for that
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:35.440]  family of four now the kids don't get their parents they can't get on the
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:39.040]  internet the kids don't get their health care they can't go to summer camp they
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:43.160]  don't get your clothes that up you know it's serious matter it's a very serious
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:47.960]  matter it's an impoverishment Cloward and Piven sickening plan they literally
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:51.280]  are turning the lights off they're literally turning the oxygen supply of
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:56.880]  the plants off CO2 the equivalent I mean this is something you'd imagine Lex
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:02.280]  Luther to do in the 1950s comic book and I wonder where did Maury Strong cook
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:05.880]  this up because first it was global freezing then it was gonna be warming
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:09.840]  and you and others just prove that so now it's changed period and they get on
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.960]  the news when it's hot or it's cold and say it's our fault
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:19.760]  by the way I covered the ice age coming story for ABC I was their science
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:24.760]  reporter I remember when Time Magazine had that picture of New York City under
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:31.440]  all that ice yes sir I covered that story for ABC interviewed the scientists
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:36.560]  behind it and those same scientists have not seen their mind and our global
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:41.760]  warming nuts it is an amazing turn of events but isn't the real danger we
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.760]  study real sunspots cyclical systems that we could be entering a mini cooling
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:53.200]  period well a many one yes and within a couple thousand years we'll all be gone
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:57.720]  but our ancestors will be around we'll have to cope with the beginning of the
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:03.520]  next I say because they have come on a regular basis about every 20,000 years
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:06.440]  through the history of Earth and now you're a top meteorologist I want you to
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:10.000]  walk through this but folks understand there's not just 365 days around the
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  sign there's not just the four seasons that's the cyclical yearly cyclical
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.560]  system but they will but exactly we know there are larger seasons larger
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:24.000]  cycles please continue have John Coleman well one of those larger cycles
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.360]  is caused by the tilt of the earth on its axis but our solar system is quite
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:32.520]  imperfect and our earth is quite imperfect and the earth actually tilts you
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:38.360]  know about 17 degrees on its axis and when it tilts more or less that has a
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:43.640]  huge impact on the weather and maybe the reason behind the beginning of ice ages
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:51.280]  but there's also a astrophysicist named sevens one in Norway I may be getting
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:55.880]  his name slightly wrong there you got it but he's a heck of a man and he has a
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.720]  theory that is caused by cosmic rays coming in elsewhere from the universe
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:04.760]  and activating our atmosphere a very interesting theory that I've been
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:10.680]  studying the truth is of course we don't know for sure what causes ice age but I'm
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:17.200]  happy to say that we are so civilized today that when the next ice age comes I
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:22.200]  think man will be able to cope with it by putting up reflectors to reflect more
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:27.800]  sunlight into the earth and deter the ice age I mean our great scientific
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:32.720]  enterprise will be able to geoengineer it's not the politicians it's the
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:36.600]  scientists to make the earth a great place well what about this hoax I mean I
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:39.920]  just saw a public letter where tens of thousands of scientists just signed
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:43.760]  saying global warming is a fraud this is all a fraud they get on the news and say
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:50.200]  all scientists agree that global warming is real pay Al Gore tax money or the
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:54.320]  earth will die I mean they literally say that it's so ridiculous yeah that
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:28:02.400]  was totally manipulated that 97% figures widely used but there are 30,000 31,000
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.760]  to be exact scientists so far who have signed the Oregon petition and that
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:12.160]  petition states clearly what I state with all my heart and was great study
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:18.400]  and great scientific knowledge there is no significant man-made global warming
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:23.640]  now there hasn't been in the past and there is no reason to fear any in the
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:29.800]  future that petition signed by thousands of scientists is an example that
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:37.000]  there's not 97% of science but Alex it's the power of money our government is
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  now giving four billion dollars a year to researchers who will support global
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:50.240]  warming and zero dollars to researchers who will counteract and I should add
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:53.560]  that that's their new tactic with gun control they're funding billions I
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:57.680]  professor lot on a few weeks ago to now fund all this fake data on guns I mean
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:01.760]  they really are cooking the books yeah and this is the same thing going on with
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:06.240]  global warming well let's think about this that four billion dollars so far
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:11.560]  they've had about 10,000 research projects they have funded every time a
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:18.680]  scientist does a research project he has a publicist who puts out a press
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:23.640]  release when he starts I mean you know that so-and-so so-and-so the bees are all
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:27.160]  dying from the global warming or whatever and then he puts out a couple of
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:30.680]  press releases while he's working it and is when he's done he puts out more
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:38.680]  well the media compels up those press releases so day in day out we're day
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:41.440]  lose with propaganda stay there John Coleman I'm gonna come back and talk
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:44.520]  about how we fight this and how you woke up to all this I mean you've been
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.680]  fighting this for decades you've been vindicated as well stay with us I'm
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:58.280]  on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:02.560]  man-made climate change is largely a myth promoted by politicians to scare
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:05.760]  the public into accepting a vast expansion of government to supposedly
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:09.160]  stop global warming global warming is a manufactured problem played up by the
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:12.600]  government to instigate a public reaction in this case fear the government
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:16.480]  then exploits to offer a predetermined solution the strategy now known as the
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:19.680]  Hegelian dialectic has been used successfully by politicians for
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:22.920]  millennia to expand government which can only grow at the expense of individual
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:26.920]  liberties the Bush administration uses strategy successfully in 2003 when it
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:30.520]  gained enough public support for the invasion of Iraq I claim the country had
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:33.880]  weapons of mass destruction and the war ultimately expanded the military
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:37.520]  industrial complex in America's merging police state today global warming is
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:41.160]  used as a boogeyman because allows the UN to use government-funded scientists to
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:44.440]  scare the public into believing that may make climate change it's too big of a
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:47.480]  threat for their country to handle alone and thus it's can only be defeated
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:50.800]  through the expansion of the UN at the expense of their nation's sovereignty the

[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:20.000]  johns I remember growing up watching John Coleman on good morning America
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.360]  remember when he started the weather channel and it was you know the top
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:28.760]  rated things for for so long then I got to say it's declined quite a bit since
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.640]  he left just from what I've seen in the news and then you tune into it and it's
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.600]  all this propaganda about the global warming is going to get you and oh my
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:41.400]  gosh we have a dust storm it's global warming turning it all into the same
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:46.680]  scam it's so sad and the same mainstream media is telling us this isn't an
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:50.840]  Islamic radical attack in California and they're trying to blame conservatives
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:57.960]  I mean these are just really sick sick people and the mainstream media is
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:02.240]  committing suicide it really is committing suicide it's like we had
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:07.680]  Donald Trump on yesterday and there are over 2,000 articles we go to Google
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:12.400]  news click news type and Alex Jones Donald Trump and it's just all this
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:17.200]  made-up stuff stuff I never said Donald Trump goes on a show that denies the
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:22.280]  moon landings I say the moon landings were real I talk about the 28 pages
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:27.400]  Saudi Arabia to congressional hearings that our government knew and they go
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:30.720]  look he's a truth or all this other stuff well yeah I mean I want the truth
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:34.200]  about our government covering up Islamic terror to come out but they
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:38.920]  misrepresented they claim all sorts of other weird stuff this is how they
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:42.760]  deceive Donald Trump called for five million dollars if he was to go to see
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.960]  an end debate to be given to wounded warrior program the headline said Donald
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:50.400]  Trump must be paid five million dollars said nothing about him wanting to give
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:55.200]  the money away that's how they misrepresent and the reason I bring
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.160]  this up is John Coleman you've been through a lot of demonization for
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:01.640]  telling the truth about man-made little warming I've seen them misrepresent
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:05.840]  what you say where they go oil companies fund these people no oil companies
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:10.800]  funded me I mean it really is frustrating to see how disingenuous they
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.760]  are but isn't that I mean isn't that the reason that mainstream media isn't such
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:20.320]  decline is that people know that they engage in so many dirty tricks and then
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:25.520]  now they only seem to be doubling down and getting more deceptive about the
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:30.000]  things they say and do instead of watching the mainstream media yesterday
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:37.920]  Alex I watched your program with Donald Trump and Lord Mountain program I had no
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:42.640]  need turn on my television said did I wow I'm flattered sir I didn't know your
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:48.280]  reviewer thank you mainstream media is in decline because now scientists
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:54.440]  technology has made it possible for you to reach thousands millions of people
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:36:00.360]  via the internet and go right around television and that's why it's in this
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:06.000]  huge decline they have a big big problem and it's the technology it's the work
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.120]  of scientists that makes it possible and it's the work of scientists that is
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:16.760]  going to solve this so-called global warming problem is going to end our age
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:21.600]  of fossil fuels now fossil fuels have fueled this country for about close to
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:29.360]  200 years now however in this great 21st century it will not be long before
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:35.480]  you begin to hear about graphene and graphene will solve the problem in 30
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:41.960]  years I'll be dead but you'll be an old man but in 30 years we won't need
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:47.440]  fossil fuels anymore we'll be turning them off because science has brought in
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:54.280]  the new wave of technology and these are great things that happen now you ask
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:59.960]  before the break about how I got into this whole global warming thing yes I'm
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:06.160]  excited about science and what it can do but then I had covered that ice age thing
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:11.880]  so I heard about Al Gore being elected to the U.S. Senate after he wrote a book
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:17.320]  about climate change and I said to the man who works for me a man named Joe
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:23.200]  DeLeo who's a certified consulting meteorologist of great reputation and he
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:29.080]  was he worked with me as my scientist helper when I was doing good morning
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:33.160]  America and then went with me to the weather channel I said to Joe I said
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:38.000]  what's this all about I'm very skeptical because I was I saw this whole ice age
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.240]  thing and he said let's research it and we began to research and the more and
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:47.880]  more we research in the early ages of computers before the internet was easy
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:55.000]  we finally came to the real facts that how it all happened and what started Al
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:00.160]  Gore and I'm speaking you today from San Diego and just a few miles from me is
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:05.440]  where the modern problem began at the Scripps Oceanographic Institution and
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:11.920]  there a man named Roger Ravel and a man named Tom Seuss I came up with a study
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:18.160]  that said yes global warming was being caused by carbon dioxide it was a small
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:24.800]  study wasn't a big deal but it started something back in the smog the smoggy
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:29.440]  50s but we've cleaned up the atmosphere hugely since then with great
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:36.080]  technology and science but never mind that started something and Roger Ravel
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:40.080]  then went to Harvard he left to the Scripps Ocean Graphic Institute in
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:44.640]  anger went to Harvard and started the Center for Population Studies but he
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:50.160]  talked about this problem with carbon dioxide in his class and the front row
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:57.920]  of his very first class who was the freshman student Al Gore and Al Gore
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:03.440]  gobbled on to this and made it the meaning of his life now a few years
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:08.560]  later Ravel realized that the global warming wasn't happening and tried to
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:14.960]  take it back but Al Gore was already in the Senate and beginning to spend tens
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:20.200]  of millions of dollars on science to support this this awful theory to make
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.360]  himself the savior of the world I mean if you're writing the script I could see
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:27.920]  why they did it if you you write a screenplay where you're the hero and so
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:34.800]  here we were and so I learned that how wrong this was and how honorable it was
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:39.200]  as a great scientist that made Ravel that he come back and say my theory was
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:44.240]  wrong it take that's the sign of a great scientist when he can realize his theory
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:49.880]  is wrong and safe so because now we're entrapped by all these scientists who are
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:54.600]  receiving these tens of millions of dollars a year for their institutions to
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:40:00.240]  study global warming all these scientists receiving that money and if
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:05.600]  they do what Ravel did and said wait a minute it's not really happening if they
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:10.280]  were to do that their money would be cut off their mortgages they couldn't send
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:15.640]  their kids to college their wives would need them so they just stick with it so
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:19.240]  they're bought and paid for they become political prostitutes John Coleman
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:23.520]  founder the weather channel one the national meteorologist the year award
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:28.520]  during his career John Coleman blog comm such a big fan of what you've done
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.880]  over the years we've got about four or five minutes left I want to invite you
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:34.720]  back up for a full hour very very soon sir when there's not all this horrible
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:39.160]  shooting news and jihadi wave attack a news and of the rest of it but but this
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:42.960]  really is front and center with this global government open treaty openly
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:48.360]  admitting world government they've really emerged I want to ask you as a smart
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:51.760]  businessman as a guy that started one of the most successful cable networks out
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:57.520]  there one of the first to do it just as a savvy person looking at the gestalt
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:01.040]  all the different pieces because I really respect your view and want to know it
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:07.920]  well in your gut is this thing have so much inertia that it'll still roll over
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:13.080]  us even though it's a proven fraud or is the tide turning against it in your gut
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:16.720]  if we all work hard and you work hard and we expose what's happening and we
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:21.440]  tell the truth where does this end up going because I mean we know it's
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:25.240]  criminal we know it's dastardly we know it's a fraud we know it's anti science
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:29.480]  we know it's going to be used to restrict other sciences that they call
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.200]  disruptive we know they're blocking real clean energy and only funding
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:37.760]  themselves with sickening boondoggles to their friends they want at the UN and
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:43.640]  more a strong zone words a new dark age to control the population that's really
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:48.360]  the end game of this like the communists used to keep people poor so so how do we
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:53.040]  have the new renaissance defeat these people and do you think we can defeat
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:56.560]  them in your gut if this was a football game and you're looking into the future
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:59.520]  we're in the second quarter in your gut where do you think we're going to be in
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:06.040]  the fourth quarter I think it will fade away I don't think we'll win I don't
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:10.560]  think they'll win I think the bathroom will continue I was in freeze here Lord
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:15.200]  Mockton said we have turned the tide yesterday but I wish I could agree with
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:21.160]  him but I can't but Alex it's not going to be the public debate it's not going
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:27.240]  to be politics that settles the fight it's going to be science and that's what
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:33.040]  I was telling you that science is going to produce a new way to our our
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:40.200]  civilization that is so sensational that we will turn off our use of CO2 and when
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:47.840]  we turn off our fossil fuel the whole thing is over it's over we're not
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:53.120]  producing any more CO2 they don't have a basis to complain their whole right
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:59.080]  best dies I can hardly wait but I don't think I'll live that long but I think
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:03.840]  it's about 30 years away when we have a totally new power regime for our
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:11.320]  civilization based on graphene that will just wipe out the whole argument and in
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:16.000]  the debate so you believe we'll transcend by technology and development as
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.800]  the last Renaissance did those that are attending a stagnate society into these
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:25.200]  new classes systems that the Liberals are pushing well I think that's really an
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:29.400]  exciting worldview and I tend to agree with you overall and the battle is up
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:34.080]  to us but speak specifically about the innovative technology that you were just
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:37.840]  mentioning that a lot of the viewers and even myself aren't up to speed on I
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:40.920]  mean I know what it is but I'd like to hear from you who is obviously an
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:46.640]  expert by the way go to YouTube and you'll find my report on graphene that's
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:54.920]  g r a p h e n e graphene invented by two French scientists one of the Nobel
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:44:02.360]  Peace Prize Nobel Science Prize in 2009 and more than 30 patents have been
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:09.600]  issued for graphing products at this point and it is the most powerful the
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:15.680]  hardest best conductor most amazing substance ever created by man it can
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:21.760]  substitute for the steel and the aluminum and our vehicles and yet this we
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:26.920]  will be able to build a paint with it if you paint a car with it it will produce
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:32.800]  enough power power that car forever incredible wait a minute need a battery
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:38.800]  graphing batteries there's a patent been issued for graphing batteries now we
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:43.600]  still can't produce graphing inexpensively in quantity there's several
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:51.120]  companies working to do that when they do the world really changes you plastic
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:57.120]  was the substance of the 20th century graphene will be the substance of the
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:03.840]  21st century and it will end the global warming debate and it will it will power
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:11.360]  this civilization into things that we only dream about today well I agree with
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.400]  you and there are so many other technologies being developed that many
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:18.680]  of us don't even know about yet that could leapfrog pass this I mean it's
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:22.280]  really is amazing and that's what I've been told by high-level people in the
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:27.560]  CIA in the FBI in foreign governments is there's a fight between elites that
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:31.000]  want to stagnate development and keep it for themselves and elites that want to
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.760]  give it to the people but at the end of the day as you said the true elite is
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:39.120]  the scientific mind of innovation and it's really hard to hold that down sir go
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:44.000]  ahead I don't know that they're the elite because money is so powerful that's
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:50.120]  where the money is and politics is controlling the money yes but science
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:58.040]  has to overcome that and is not easy but it's science has ruled the world if you
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:04.800]  look at it civilizations countries empires come and go even rocks have a
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:10.760]  lifetime but science has always taken us to the next level and so I'm confident
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:15.200]  that science will win the battle and global warming by making it totally
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:19.000]  unimportant that's why they want us to forget about science in school now and
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.040]  make it all about infighting and racial garbage when what unifies this is
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:28.960]  innovation is discovery and so much more wow John Coleman blog calm I am so
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:33.520]  thankful you came on I've tried to get you on for years and I must have not
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:36.360]  been reaching out the right place but I'm very honored that you tuned into the
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:39.760]  show and we really appreciate you coming on sir and the minute or two we have
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:44.160]  left any other key points you would like to relay to the viewers and listeners
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:49.600]  out there well I think the key point that I will make it is science that has
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:54.480]  made this program possible it is science that has made many others like it
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:47:01.720]  possible the mainstream media of which I was a key player for 60 years used to
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:06.880]  when I started we had like two TV stations people could watch one newspaper
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:13.360]  they could read there was no internet at all and I have watched as cable came and
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:19.360]  brought additional channels and spread out the power and that helped but then
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:25.520]  came the internet and now we have digital television which is growing in
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:32.840]  leaps and bounds and I think this will this opens up communications the
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:36.560]  Facebook is just a small thing I'm trying to develop something called my
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:41.800]  like my world which involves both video and a Facebook like content and Twitter
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:47.280]  that would just tear the world apart because everybody would become a
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:52.600]  communicator and that's the way it ought to be Wow well Mr. Coleman promised me
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:55.520]  that you will come back in the next few months with us again storage it's really
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:00.800]  been a treat my pleasure Alex thank you Wow I tell you what an innovator what a
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.720]  broadcaster what a fighter he was there at the beginning when they were rolling
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:08.400]  this fraud out and he sent around with other scientists other meteorologists
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:11.720]  going this doesn't sound right they just said we were gonna be freezing to death
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:14.960]  and we didn't give them all the power let's look into this and so from the
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:19.520]  beginning he's just been going come on guys Al Gore is gonna save us we're gonna
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:24.120]  pay him tax money the guy that says he invented the internet the internet was
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:28.720]  invented back in the 60s by British and US scientists wasn't vented by Al Gore
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:34.520]  had nothing to do with it then he went well I was in the Senate in the late 80s
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:39.200]  when we gave the internet some funding I saw this bumper sticker on somebody's
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:44.240]  car I think it was quoting Oliver Wendell Holmes or something but it said
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:50.320]  I like paying taxes because I like civilization and that's kind of the
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:56.000]  proto-fraud idea of what Obama said if you got a business you didn't build that
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:02.160]  somebody else did that so I mean obviously some type of government some
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:07.600]  type of centralized system some type of law has helped build civilization but in
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:12.000]  latter phases it becomes very oppressive and destructive historically and then
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  it destroys civilization but it is the human mind and human free will and
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  markets that innovates so I like free market cuz I like choice and I like
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.480]  civilization the collectives say if somebody commits a crime with a gun you
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:35.200]  lose your second amendment because you're all collectively bad no I'm not
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:38.560]  racist because there's some other white guy that's racist or of a black guy's
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:42.840]  racist some other black person isn't racist I judge people by the character
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:47.520]  of their conduct and their deeds and who they are I listen to Jimmy Hendry's
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:52.960]  cuz I like his singing and his guitar not cuz he's black the same thing I
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:57.480]  judge people by who they are and that's common sense let's get back to it we're
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:00.480]  gonna break I'm gonna come back with a bunch of Donald Trump clips and then
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:03.040]  jacari Jackson's gonna be on the ground down at one of the Christmas trees
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:06.280]  downtown to ask folks you know do you think that this trigger the jihadi should
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:08.960]  we take the Christmas trees down and should Christmas be restricted there's

[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:36.880]  the local government level of the police to then bring in tyranny we're
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:48.840]  exposing the false flag but I have never seen a more sickeningly illustrated
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:59.840]  example of just oxymoronic treason as the European governments and our
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:03.720]  government bringing in radical jihadists that continue to attack us and the
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:09.600]  media trying to spin the fact that it's because they saw a Christmas tree or
[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:16.120]  it's not jihad or trying to blame the right wing or patriots and then
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.040]  politically correct neighbors not reporting them to police they're
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:23.360]  admitting this because they were Muslims and they didn't want to be
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:28.400]  politically incorrect and then Obama arming these very groups the Middle East
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:34.800]  to commit wholesale carnage against the Libyans the Syrians the Egyptians the
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:41.360]  Iraqis I mean I just have never seen our government be such bad guys before and
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:48.280]  it's certainly not been perfect but man this is low down and then kid Daniels
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:52.720]  just walked in with this story and I just gulped it's up on info wars calm
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:56:01.080]  right now I've told them red link this sucker right now this is such a big deal
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:08.080]  Obama arms ISIS link militants without background checks Wow just like that
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:12.040]  plane last week from Mexico with 140 people and then their passports weren't
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:15.360]  even looked at it's like the migrants are being brought in they're just being
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:20.200]  dispersed is this like sleeper cells or something is this worse than I thought I
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.280]  mean something's going on here I've told everybody that I've been dreading
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:26.680]  December everybody else I've talked to it just feels it's building up to this
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:31.680]  month now we're here and you got stuff with Russia going on and economic
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:36.040]  craziness look at this article this needs to be our top story red linked on
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:46.840]  info wars calm Obama arms ISIS link militants without background checks gun
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:49.520]  control advocates want to enact universal background checks for guns
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:52.120]  that's registration response to San Bernardino shootings even though
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:55.040]  President Obama wasn't performing stringent background checks on ISIS
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:59.880]  linked moderate rebels he was arming in Syria and now he's letting him come in
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:03.920]  without background checks that we need to add that kit the demand for more gun
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:07.440]  control is also strange considering that the shooting occurred in California I
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:10.360]  think that already has some of the strongest gun laws the nation in
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:13.720]  California we have tough gun laws I don't know how these weapons involved in
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:17.800]  shooting got where they were we'll find out said Barbara Boxer said the Senate
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:25.000]  floor and the people well we have these gun laws but look at this we have 56
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.040]  percent reduction in gun violence is 93 and migrating state because we have
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:34.600]  taken action no boxer gun ownership went up so criminals are scared and now
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:38.320]  all we've got your weird cross-dressing crazies and your jihadies attacking us
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:43.560]  I mean literally I mean always do it in gun-free zones like you know this

[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:59.640]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:17.840]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:27.000]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:33.080]  the right wing has produced tyrants in the past the left wing has as well but
[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:38.000]  as Lord Monkton points on going back to China thousands of years ago you have
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:43.680]  the libertarians and the totalitarians and that's openly there what they taught
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:48.440]  the totalitarians and the libertarians or the whole Confucius movement versus
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:55.800]  the you know pro-imperials oppressing the population and you sit here and you
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:00.200]  watch classic authoritarian totalitarians run around lecturing everyone
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:03.960]  screaming that they want to arrest you you have to understand I have to actually
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:10.200]  water down what I say because I can't even believe it I can't even believe they
[02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:14.800]  had multiple newspapers and TV stations say that the Christians deserve to die
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:18.920]  when these Muslims killed them because Christianity is hateful I mean New York
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:25.200]  Daily News had a major headline with that and when you come to grips with what
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:29.440]  hateful weird freaks these people are and they have they have scientific
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:32.840]  studies in Canada and the UK the environmentalists are six times more
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:39.200]  likely to rob or steal or to lie but they're more likely to say they're
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:43.080]  making donations and Lord Monkton you got four minutes left on this point but I
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:47.360]  think you're hitting it on the head there that these are not liberals these
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:53.040]  are not Thomas Jefferson's that we're talking about these people are a cult
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:57.880]  of stunted mentally ill people and their con artist controllers we must start
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:02.560]  taking back the language the so-called Democratic Party are not Democrats we
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:05.880]  must call them what they are the totalitarians the so-called liberals
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:10.360]  are not liberal we must call them what they are which is totalitarian the so
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:13.920]  called radicals are not radical we must call them what they are communist
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:18.800]  totalitarians let us no longer allow them to steal our language to make
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:23.440]  themselves seem fragrant when in fact they stink it's high time that we got
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:28.320]  tough on these people and your audience here can help Alex you can look up the
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:34.200]  story about how Patrick Moore has has complained to the FBI about a nasty
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:38.800]  attempt a failed attempt that which has backfired very badly on Greenpeace this
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:44.840]  this hate-filled organization to entrap professor will happen just before he was
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:49.480]  due to give testimony in the US Congress an excellent testimony he gave to and
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:54.960]  you too can look up the story and if you think that Patrick Moore was right to
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:59.960]  put in a complaint to the FBI then get on to the FBI website click to the link
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:05.240]  that allows you to make a complaint and add your voice to his just tell the FBI
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:10.800]  that it is not acceptable that people should go around intimidating witnesses
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:15.920]  due to appear before Congress the Greenpeace has behaved illegally under
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:20.360]  the Rico Statute and the wire fraud statute also by setting up a bogus
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:25.560]  company in in the in the Beirut souk and pretending to operate from there and
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:29.560]  pretending to entrap people like Harper of course is so honest they
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:33.480]  absolutely failed but of course they still spun it as though they had caught
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:38.240]  him out taking money from hated fossil fuel companies even if he had taken
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:42.480]  money from them which he didn't and he made it quite plain that he didn't he
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:45.960]  still wouldn't have been doing anything wrong he's a very honorable man and he
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:49.440]  always makes it plain but they admit that almost all the big fossil fuel
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:54.040]  companies support the global warming fraud they do indeed Exxon Mobil is one
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:57.600]  of the largest subsidizers of the I'm still waiting for my check from the old
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:01.400]  companies I haven't ever gotten one I'm still waiting for mine hasn't come this
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:06.840]  week at all and the problem is this Alex that these companies are themselves now
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:11.840]  in danger of being dragged into what has become and the word you've just used is
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:16.880]  the correct word a global fraud and one of the things that we on the
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:22.280]  questioning side of the debate have decided to do here at Le Bourget is to
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:30.400]  establish our own fraud investigation team under the aegis of the Independent
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:33.680]  Committee on Geoethics which is a committee of very eminent professors
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:38.080]  from around the world and one by one we're going to start investigating yes
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:42.840]  do it project Veritas does Lord Moncton when this conference is over next week
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:46.280]  we want to get a final update from you when you're back there in Scotland or

[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:05.920]  do you prefer Barack Obama or George W Bush well if you haven't figured it out
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:10.720]  by now these guys are corporate spokesmen they're not leaders I mean they
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:15.440]  both started illegal wars hell they both tortured people they bailed out
[02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:20.440]  criminal corporations and they spied on you they both violated the constitution
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:25.280]  and they even committed war crimes so what's it gonna take I mean what will it
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:30.520]  take to finally wake you up think about it if Joseph Stalin ran for president as

[02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:47.200]  choice between the two parties is a myth because in reality it is a two-party

[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:38.960]  broadcasting all over the country on over a hundred to seventy AM and FM
[02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:43.520]  stations global shortwave satellite but really what's scary to the
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:47.800]  establishment is over a million people with the podcast every day two or three
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:51.840]  million people on one youtube channel a day millions a day on facebook mentions
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:56.360]  millions and millions more on other platforms we're talking 20 million
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:00.920]  people a week worldwide about 10 million of them in north america about half our
[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:07.960]  audience and it's growing exponentially so I'm not bragging about info wars I'm
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:12.720]  putting out the good news that the more hardcore we get the more we put our
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:17.360]  reporters out there on the ground the more the establishment freaks out and
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:20.800]  tries to misrepresent what we've said what we've done what we stand for and
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:24.320]  they do that to everybody else who's a libertarian or a constitutional as they
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:27.400]  do to tucker carlsson they do it to world and daily they do it to mad drudge
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:31.640]  they do it to donald trump and it's not the donald trump's perfect but and it
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:35.840]  could be seen as extreme because we're a free open society that hey until we get
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:39.440]  a handle on things and until they're vetting people's visas then until
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:45.120]  congress acts to at least look at who's coming in we will block every single
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:49.760]  muslim coming into this country well they only had that we will block every
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:54.320]  single muslim coming in the country turns out that's what jimmy carter did he
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:57.640]  kicked all the iranians out basically and wouldn't let him come in during that
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:02.840]  whole situation that's what countries do you can't go to Saudi arabia and preach
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:06.480]  the gospel of Christ you'll be imprisoned if you're lucky sometimes
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:12.480]  executed so it's all about misrepresentation but their hoaxes don't
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:15.840]  work anymore for two days they said there wasn't any islamic terror in san
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:22.800]  bernadino california that doesn't work anymore now joining us until about 50
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:27.200]  after is tucker carlsson the 20 year plus media veteran with a wide variety of
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:32.760]  experience in journalism currently at fox news carlsson has also been cnn msnbc
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:37.640]  pbs you name it gq magazine but really what he's best on for my view is the
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:43.280]  hard-hitting news exposing both sides of the police state everything from black
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:48.720]  lives matter the private fellow reserve you name it daily caller dot com which
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:52.760]  is a mainstay when you see links at info wars dot com or places like drug
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:57.440]  report dot com there's so much to cover trump where the dinosaur media is are
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:00.720]  they really on their last legs and i know you're on fox i wouldn't call it
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:04.880]  dinosaur media because it's at least somewhat conservative and so it has a
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:10.000]  big audience but the others don't have audiences their facades i mean i can
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.760]  turn on a facebook mentions at home and get a million a half viewers anytime i
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:18.240]  want their biggest show doesn't have a half million so when does the zombie
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:22.720]  finally fall down and die or can it not die because it's already dead tucker
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:27.720]  carlsson i've never heard it put that way but i love it i mean you're you're
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:32.360]  watching it die now and you're in your watching donald trump benefit from its
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:36.960]  death i mean the in my view the worst thing about trump is the media reaction
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:43.400]  to him which is so hyperventilating and self-righteous it's merely an excuse for
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:47.800]  reporters to explain that they're morally superior to donald trump you know
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:52.320]  he's a bad person they're great people it's a it's a vehicle for their vanity
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:56.680]  and self-aggrandizement it's it's disgusting and you know there are things
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:00.920]  about trump that i don't agree with and there are certainly things about his
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:05.320]  rhetoric that i think ought to be more precise that he'll explain better but
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:09.800]  none of that really compares an emotional impact to the feeling i get
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:13.640]  watching the press whine about him and declare him dangerous every time i hear
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:19.160]  that i feel like sending him money i agree with you what about uh what about
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:25.000]  senator uh leslie graham i mean excuse me lindsay graham the beauty queen he is
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  up there just saying it's race-pating xenophobic religious bigot let's watch
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.040]  that clip from the communist news network
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:35.080]  well i want to talk to the trump supporters for a minute i don't know
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:39.480]  who you are and i don't know why you like this guy i think what you like about him
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:42.680]  he appears to be strong when the rest of us are weak
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:46.280]  he's a very successful businessman he's gonna make everything great
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:49.720]  he's gonna take all the problems of the world and put them in a box
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:54.200]  and make your life better that's what he's selling here's what you're buying
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:58.680]  he's a race-pating xenophobic religious bigot
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:02.520]  he doesn't represent my party he doesn't represent the values
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:05.640]  that the men and women who wear the uniform are fighting for i've been in
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:08.840]  the air force for 33 years i have retired this june
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:12.920]  he's the isleman of the year by the way just got back from iraq a week ago that's
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:15.960]  enough hillary we played the clip last hour also says
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:18.680]  he's playing right in the hands of isis last time i checked he didn't run the
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:21.880]  state department that helped build up isis we have the former head of defense
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:25.480]  intelligence himself saying that tugger let
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:28.920]  let yourself talk jump in here where do you see all this going
[02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:31.720]  well i mean linsey graham is the one who doesn't represent
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:36.200]  obviously the views of the republican party look at the numbers i mean that
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:41.240]  you know i don't dislike linsey graham as a person but he has no constituency
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:45.240]  and he has it strikes me no deep knowledge of the region he's the one
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:48.200]  who's forever telling us we need to arm this or that group about
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:51.800]  which he knows nothing he's not an arabic speaker and if he's always
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:54.440]  telling us this is a group of freedom fighters and your son needs to go fight
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:58.600]  on their behalf etc etc it's every bit in fact it's more reckless than anything
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:02.360]  donald trump has ever said here's the real reason people like trump's
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:06.680]  recent statement on stopping islamic immigration or putting a pause on it
[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:10.680]  the message is really clear donald trump i i would be shocked if donald trump
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:13.880]  awoken middle of the night seating with hatred toward muslims i don't know but
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:17.240]  i doubt it he does i think donald donald trump is really worried that we're
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:20.200]  going to see more terror attacks in the country and you look at europe
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:24.280]  and its inability over 70 years to integrate and assimilate large muslim
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:28.120]  populations and it does make you wonder like what are you you know we don't
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:32.360]  want to be sweden or belgium or france so what steps we need to take in order to
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:35.480]  not become them that's a totally reasonable and
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:38.520]  rational conclusion to reach out maybe you don't think that
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:42.600]  stopping on muslim immigration is the answer but but at least the question
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:45.640]  is an essential question and only trump seems to be asking it
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:49.480]  why is that well it's an extreme statement but it's extreme
[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:53.880]  to have 80 percent being military h-men 80 plus percent fake passports
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:57.800]  the mainly these are sunni invaders into syria that's all admitted who
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:01.080]  who got their butt kicked they're now going into turkey going into europe
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:04.920]  and in just a month or so ago trump said hey we've got to let these poor
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:09.000]  refugees in we've got to take them his own constituents said hey a lot of
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:13.240]  merterist he got informed and then he changed his mind
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:16.120]  he knows there's going to be more terror attacks after paris and now san
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:19.400]  bernadino that's right and they're taking him out of context he he doesn't
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:22.920]  dislike anybody well exactly and again you have to
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:26.280]  compare the recklessness of trump and sometimes he is reckless
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:29.160]  with the recklessness of the people who now run everything and
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:31.800]  lindsay gramm is a perfect representative of that group right
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:35.560]  after the parents paris terror attacks lindsay gramm was not only calling for
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:37.880]  more syrian immigration into the united states
[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:41.320]  but saying anyone who opposed it was so how a nativist or a bigot or a bad
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:43.960]  person or immoral or on the wrong side of god
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:48.200]  really i mean there's no room for debate on this i mean ask yourself the
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:52.440]  question does any adult really believe that germany will be improved
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:55.720]  by a million refugees from syria and surrounding
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:15:57.960]  countries pakistan because they're not just syrians
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:01.160]  i don't think anybody really believes that and yet time magazine just gave
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:05.080]  angola marple the person of the euro award and it is effective on award
[02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:07.960]  to congratulate her for doing that what's the effect of that kind of
[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:11.560]  immigration it makes the people in power feel virtuous they can feel like
[02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:14.280]  good people but they don't have to deal with any of the consequences of it they
[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:16.120]  don't send their children to public school
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:19.400]  they don't they're not competing for jobs at these people they're surrounded by
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:23.160]  armed bodyguards that taxpayers pay for there's really no downside for them but
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:26.840]  there's a massive downside for everybody else they are out of touch
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:29.640]  they really don't care about the effect of their policies on the people they're
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:33.080]  supposed to be representing and we really ought to be outraged about that
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:35.880]  and i'm hardly like some wild-eyed populace i think i'm pretty reasonable
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:38.840]  in mainstream but it's worth being mad about that matter
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:42.760]  indeed than you are than people are at donald trump like sure who's really at
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:45.880]  fault here well let's take huma abadino i notice you
[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:49.320]  have a picture behind you uh of her on your wall with that ringling brothers
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:52.680]  and actually does look like her uh hillary clinton special friend i don't
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:56.440]  care if hillary has special friends i'm a libertarian like you are but if this
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:17:00.280]  was trump or a conservative we know there'd be a spotlight on it
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:03.560]  and then her whole background she seems to just get away with everything
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:07.240]  that i think that also sticks in people's craw that these democrats and
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:11.320]  establishment republicans are above the law they don't get reviewed they don't
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:14.440]  get looked at and then hillary's little hippo
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:17.880]  she can do whatever she wants and you know stay in the same hotel room or
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:20.920]  whatever i mean this should be looked into and then drudge and you and others
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:23.880]  get criticized for investigating hillary's health
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:27.960]  investing investigating her taste in women i mean isn't all of this open
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:31.720]  game huma abadino let's just assess the public record
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:35.000]  okay that's enough and i'm willing to give everyone a pass on their private
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.800]  lives why do you have a picture of her on your wall
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:41.560]  sorry go ahead it's from the 40s it predates even huma
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:44.680]  uh but she said on an email two days ago in which she
[02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:49.960]  called donald trump quote a racist for opposing islamic immigration as if
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:53.320]  islam is a race rather than a religion it's not a
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:57.560]  racial ethnic category that's insane now that is exactly the kind
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:01.160]  of language of rhetoric that divides people that makes people hate each other
[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:03.480]  that which the population into a greater frenzy
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:07.560]  again that's every bit as irresponsible as anything donald trump has suggested
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:10.920]  and unlike donald trump she's actually in a position of
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:15.400]  of power i mean huma abadine was a was a federal official a state department
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:18.120]  official up until pretty recently a clinton
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:20.520]  administration i mean a rather an obama administration
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:24.520]  official and yet she can send an email like that out and nobody cares you know
[02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:29.080]  it's it's fine it's just a reaction he's dangerous no wonder she's upset
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:34.280]  it is all of this the trump phenomenon is a reaction against that and i tell
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:36.920]  people who are upset a lot of republicans in washington as you know
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:39.240]  are horrified by trump they hate him more than they hate obama
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:42.920]  he's a direct threat to their power and i always say to them there's a reason
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:46.680]  he's here and that's because you have been a bad steward of this party
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:49.560]  the president has been a bad steward of the federal government a lot of the
[02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:52.280]  business community have been bad stewards of the economy
[02:18:52.280 --> 02:18:55.960]  the people running things haven't done a very good job so it shouldn't surprise
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:59.320]  you that someone like donald trump arrives on the scene and gets really
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:02.840]  popular by telling the truth about your failures like why is that shocking
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:07.480]  tucker carlson's our guest fox news fox news dot com daily color dot com
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:11.000]  that's got to be the quote of the last week or so the most crystallized boiled
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:14.360]  down truth that last 20 seconds that's it they don't
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:18.520]  dislike him because he's a bigot or he's hateful they hate him because he'll win
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:21.560]  he's not part of their power structure they've been caught working with the
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:25.480]  democrats and he represents the tea party the libertarians
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:30.120]  taking over the grand old party and kicking uh you know these weasels
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:33.800]  out of toad hall who have invaded and taken over
[02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:36.760]  and he is a bellwether of that and they're panicking
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:40.600]  what's so funny is there in a lather this morning about the idea that he
[02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:44.520]  might run third party here's a news slash he already is running third party
[02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:48.280]  he's already broken with republican orthodoxy on economics he's attacked
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:50.920]  the hedge fund people he's broken with them on foreign policy
[02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:53.800]  he's pointed out the iraq war was a disaster that's not allowed but he did
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:57.160]  it anyway he's being attacked by the head of the rnc
[02:19:57.160 --> 02:20:00.440]  he's hated by donors he's hated by lobbyists he's hated by the entire
[02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:03.080]  washington establishment and the other candidates
[02:20:03.080 --> 02:20:06.760]  or some of them say they won't vote for him he's actually not he's not running
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:09.880]  as a republican here's a newsflash and maybe that's why he's succeeding
[02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:13.720]  because the and again i've always kind of voted republican because i don't see
[02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:17.960]  the choice but the truth is the republican coalition for 40 years has
[02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:21.240]  been a combination of libertarian economic policy
[02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:25.240]  and neoconservative foreign policy and neither one has worked for a lot of
[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:27.480]  people in the middle of the country that's just the truth
[02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:30.760]  okay and it's not delivering and if we don't watch out we're going to get a
[02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:34.840]  bernie sanders or a hillary we can't stand it and so the republicans i think
[02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:38.920]  ought to back off reassess what's happening really try to talk to trump
[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:42.440]  bring him in then he would listen to them but now that i know some of the inside
[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:45.880]  baseball three or four months ago i wasn't sure about trump a month ago i
[02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:48.760]  wasn't but now that like you said going after the
[02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:52.920]  hedge fund boys that's the top of the pyramid that's the too big to fails
[02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:58.360]  he is really showing the fact that he's going after the establishment and now
[02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:01.240]  threatening them to go third party if they don't stop
[02:21:01.240 --> 02:21:05.160]  demonizing him and shrilly trying to outdo msnbc
[02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:08.920]  i mean lindsay graham and all these republicans and i hate to say it even
[02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:12.200]  some people i've supported are trying to sound more like democrats than anybody
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:15.880]  ever heard they're not going to win like that i mean how stupid are they don't
[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:19.880]  they get the mainstream media is the last group you want endorsing you
[02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:23.400]  exactly but trump is radical because he's not tied to anyone
[02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:27.080]  so take for example carried interest it's a loophole in the tax code that allows
[02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:30.200]  some people in the in the finance business a hedge fund
[02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:33.880]  managers among others to take their income as investment
[02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:37.160]  dividends in other words they pay half the tax that the rest of us wage earners
[02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:40.920]  pay now this is obviously wrong they won't even defend it in public i'm not
[02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:45.000]  i'm pro capitalist and i'm opposed to it it's indefensible and yet seven years
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:48.600]  under the obama administration a supposedly radical left-wing
[02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:52.440]  redistribution administration they've allowed this to remain in the tax code
[02:21:52.440 --> 02:21:55.480]  they've never gone after it for seven years okay
[02:21:55.480 --> 02:21:59.880]  it took donald trump to stand up a billionaire obviously a beneficiary of
[02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:03.240]  capitalism say this is totally unfair you can't be tax exempt when
[02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:06.680]  when when housewives and and working mothers and people are paying
[02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:10.920]  20 tax you can't be tax exempt bozos there's not gonna be an economy if you
[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:15.720]  keep setting the playing field where it's crooked exactly but i think people
[02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:19.720]  underestimate how radical it is for the republican frontrunner to say this or
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:24.360]  even to make an obvious point you know he's not attacking our soldiers or
[02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:27.880]  even bush or cheney he's just pointing out what the iraq war didn't go that
[02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:31.720]  well and would you do it again of course not that's a stupid question even to
[02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:35.800]  ask and yet he was the only one in the republican field who would say
[02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:39.240]  something that obvious that's right overall he's a true
[02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:42.040]  a true maverick let me ask you this thing
[02:22:42.040 --> 02:22:44.280]  i mean in your gut you're not making predictions sir tucker but you're a
[02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:47.320]  smart political analyst you made a lot of accurate predictions
[02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:50.680]  what do you think just in your gut is going to end up happening with trump
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:53.960]  where is this going because just as a spectator
[02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:58.600]  just from that position this is fantastical for the news cycle i mean
[02:22:58.600 --> 02:23:02.040]  every five minutes it's something new where is this going
[02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:05.560]  it's the media full employment act it's unbelievable i have been usually right
[02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:08.760]  in my predictions not because i'm so smart because it's pretty easy to predict
[02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:11.400]  what's going to happen in american politics it always has been
[02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:14.520]  i'll be honest with you i don't know what's going to happen my only prediction
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:17.880]  is this if he wins the florida primary which is
[02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:21.240]  far more important than any other it's a state you can't become president without
[02:23:21.240 --> 02:23:23.480]  winning it's far more representative of the
[02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:26.360]  country than iowa or new hampshire if he wins that
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:29.480]  in a state where jeb was the governor and marco rubio
[02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:34.040]  is a sitting senator how can you deny him the nomination if he wins that's when
[02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:36.600]  you'll know in march the florida primary if
[02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:40.360]  trump is still in and wins that he will be the nominee
[02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:43.880]  well he's now gone on national television instead it's not about their religion
[02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:48.600]  it is about safety and in his full speech he said they're not vetting him
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:51.160]  they're not checking him that's why we got to do it for a limited time till it's
[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:54.680]  fixed he let them take him out of context but no way
[02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:57.800]  people then get mad at him then they find out what he really said then they
[02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:01.480]  get madder at the controlled media i mean even i when i first saw the headline
[02:24:01.480 --> 02:24:05.240]  a few days ago a day and a half ago thought oh he's crazy and then you find
[02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:09.000]  out what he really said it just reminds you how much
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.480]  they will spend and deceive now remember since we mentioned this
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:14.760]  here's trump a couple months ago saying we've got to take the refugees
[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:16.600]  because of what they've been through so here's
[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:18.920]  here's donald trump before he has the facts
[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:22.200]  shooting his mouth off saying we got to take the refugees then he goes to the
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:26.200]  extreme of saying you know we can't take them till it's fixed here it is
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:31.000]  look from a humanitarian standpoint i'd love to help but we have our own problems
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.480]  we have so many problems that we have to solve
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:36.600]  you have over there the gulf states tremendously wealthy
[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:40.280]  you have five okay i thought they found it that's the walk back
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:44.120]  a week later that's him going on i think that's fox news
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:48.680]  uh walking it back he yeah on hannity there's another one where he gives a
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:50.520]  speech where he says quote we've got to take him
[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:54.200]  the quote is uh go ahead tucker sorry well it's just not surprising
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:57.640]  americans are compassionate people and their their first instinct is always to
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:24:59.560]  help i mean you're walking through mid-teminent
[02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:02.040]  and a japanese tourist with no english says where's
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:05.480]  time square 20 people rush to help him and that's just kind of who we are
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:08.920]  so it's not surprising that anybody asked that question from a dead sleep would
[02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:12.680]  say yeah of course we should help them the the question is not is that your
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:15.240]  instinct the question is knowing all the facts and watching what happened in
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:18.600]  paris and watching the failure to assimilate of these large muslim
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:22.200]  populations in europe do you still think it's a good idea then and here's my
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:25.880]  question is trump's position more reckless and crazy
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:29.400]  than the mainstream position which is despite all the evidence let's just
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:32.760]  invite thousands of syrians right from the battlefield to come to america at
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:37.960]  taxpayer expense literally flown over on american aircraft at your expense to go
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:41.480]  on welfare is which which one of these positions
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:44.520]  is nuttier and i don't know again i'm not endorsing
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:47.720]  trump for president hardly there are a lot of things about trump i don't like
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:51.400]  but on the merits trump's position is less crazy
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:55.160]  than that position that position is just flat out anti-american and by the way
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:58.760]  the constitution does not require us to commit suicide there's no amendment
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:01.800]  it's not a suicide pact in fact i did find the one of the articles front page
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:04.920]  magazine it was from one of the debates we'll put it on screen for folks
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:09.160]  we have the actual quote for tv viewers for radio listeners i'll read it out
[02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:13.400]  trump rubio bush we should take in syrian refugees trump quote on a
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:17.000]  humanitarian basis something does have to be done
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:22.360]  so there he was before all these people got shot and blown up in in in europe
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:25.480]  and the united states and what is obama thinking tucker let me ask you this
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:28.440]  question if you bring in hundreds of thousands of these people
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:31.960]  who are mainly sunnis from war zones a lot of them soldiers a lot of them ices
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:35.080]  almost you know it keeps coming out you bring millions into europe
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:38.680]  don't they know there's going to be more attacks how will they politically get
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:41.560]  away with this and why would they want to do this it's so
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:44.520]  destructive well they they get away with it politically
[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:47.400]  because they changed the composition of the electorate over time and that's
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:51.480]  exactly as you know what's happened since 1965 when immigration law changed to
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:54.680]  favor people from outside of europe and there are probably some good things
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:57.240]  about that there are also some bad things about it which we never mentioned we
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:26:59.880]  lie about and pretend it's all good because we get better restaurants and
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:03.960]  chief servants but the truth is it was a massive boon for the democratic party
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:06.600]  because the overwhelming majority of those immigrants in the last 50 years have
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:11.080]  become democrats and state democrats but it has made the country less cohesive
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:13.640]  and more divided and there have been all kinds of other
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:16.760]  unattractive effects of it it's affected our education system
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:20.040]  it's affected our economy in ways that are bad and really troubling over the
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:24.440]  long term i mean but from a democratic point of view if if you're david plough
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:28.120]  planning out you know how to win the white house unto the generations for the
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:33.880]  next nine cycles your first your go-to position is more immigration from the
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:37.560]  third world because that means more democratic voters and i know
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:39.960]  i always give people the benefit of the doubt on motive i don't know what
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:43.480]  motivates people most of the time and i tried not to pretend that i do but on
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:47.160]  this specific subject i mean talk to these guys a lot well they admit it see
[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:50.280]  immigration as a way to change the demographics of the country in a way
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:53.080]  that helps them that's just well yeah i mean if you take third world
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:56.600]  populations and you know they work hard they get a job the american dream they're
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:59.320]  great you indoctrinate them into socialist
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:03.640]  chip on the shoulder uh you know trigger word garbage
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:06.840]  where they can't see a christmas tree or they fall down literally crying
[02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:10.200]  no not halloween don't let them have a party
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:13.320]  and then they you know the Yale professors have stepped down now
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:16.760]  they're creating a freakazoid cult yeah what about the political correctness i
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:20.040]  mean i love trump because he's the opposite of that
[02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:23.640]  well he is the problem with the political correctness on campus and it's not
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:27.320]  just on campus but it starts there is that it's really an attack on
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:30.120]  speech i understand i've got a minority view
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:34.120]  on politics my views are not popular with most people i don't pretend they are
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:37.080]  i'm way out by myself i get it and it doesn't bother me
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:40.840]  the only thing the line that the left crosses that makes me worried
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:44.520]  really upset is when they try to prevent me from expressing my views when they
[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:48.680]  equate opinions they disagree with with violence and that's exactly what
[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:52.200]  trigger warnings are all about that's exactly what safe spaces are all about
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:55.320]  that's exactly why loretta lynch the attorney general said the other day if
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:58.040]  you criticize islam in a way we don't like we'll prosecute
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:01.400]  these are all attacks on freedom of expression on speech constitutionally
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:04.040]  protected speech they don't believe in the first
[02:29:04.040 --> 02:29:07.960]  amendment and the polls show this a strikingly large percentage of democrats
[02:29:07.960 --> 02:29:11.080]  when asked to say yes there'll be limits to the first amendment and those
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:13.960]  limits begin when you start offending protected groups
[02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:17.800]  that's scary none of us want to live in a country where we can't say what we
[02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:20.440]  believe is true period
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:23.720]  tucker carlson's our guest for one more segment i've been asking a lot of the
[02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:27.640]  questions but in the first half of this next segment it's 18 minutes long
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:30.680]  i'm gonna let him bring up whatever topics he wants because i want to hear
[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:34.280]  what he's focused on what he sees coming up then i've got some other questions
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:38.040]  i want to go over with him what's going on with putin talking about using nukes
[02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:41.160]  now on isis i know that's just rhetoric but wow
[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:44.360]  what does he make of what's happening in turkey and other things straight ahead
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:48.120]  tucker carlson the daily caller dot com
[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:51.960]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:51.960 --> 02:29:56.760]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:02.360]  hamtramik michigan is experiencing culture shock after becoming the first
[02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:06.440]  majority muslim city in the u.s. for example business owners routinely
[02:30:06.440 --> 02:30:10.120]  advertise their products in arabic and they can't obtain liquor licenses within
[02:30:10.120 --> 02:30:14.040]  500 feet of a mosque but besides this cultural shift hamtramik
[02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:18.200]  also serves as a microcosm of america's economy hamtramik was the home of a
[02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:22.120]  chrysler automobile plant back during the muscle car era of the 60s and early
[02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:24.760]  70s everything from plinth barracudas the dodge
[02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:28.200]  charges were built at the hamtramik plant but now the plant is closed down just
[02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:31.880]  like america's manufacturing base when the u.s. dollar was chosen as the
[02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:34.280]  international medium of exchange decades ago
[02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:37.880]  u.s. still had a strong manufacturing base but now it does it and the only
[02:30:37.880 --> 02:30:41.400]  reason why we're still able to maintain a trade deficit is due to global demand
[02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:44.600]  for the dollar but eventually other countries will stop accepting dollars
[02:30:44.600 --> 02:30:47.640]  for their products because we barely manufacture anything anymore
[02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:51.000]  when that happens the u.s. economy will close down just like the hamtramik
[02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:54.440]  automobile plant did so many years ago this is kit daniels and visit info

[02:33:13.160 --> 02:33:21.320]  to turkey it is a big idea a new world order how is it that this organization
[02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:25.720]  is so well funded so organized lamik state linked militants have gained a

[02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:40.920]  and of course he was on to the teeth by nato a world in which there is the very
[02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:45.000]  real prospect of a new world order the russians say they're negotiating with
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:48.760]  north korea to hold joint military exercises kim jong-un and
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:53.000]  vladimir putin teaming up creating an ominous alliance against the united

[02:33:56.520 --> 02:33:59.800]  is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal that the u.s. government
[02:33:59.800 --> 02:34:04.040]  is negotiating with iran saudi arabi is apparently prepared to allow israeli
[02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:07.320]  jets into its airspace to conduct attacks on iran
[02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:12.920]  we have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order i set up a
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:17.560]  foundation in ukraine and play that an important part in
[02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:21.400]  events now ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of an international
[02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:24.840]  monetary fund aid package where we have broker the deal
[02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:31.720]  to transition power in ukraine gladimir putin is on the move
[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:36.360]  only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:41.160]  measure of the opportunities presented by this new
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:44.840]  and involving world order is known as the builder
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:57.480]  group could their objective be world domination
[02:34:57.480 --> 02:35:00.760]  you are listening to the alex jones show i'm alex jones we've added the fourth
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:04.280]  hour of the broadcast anthony gets yard he's hosting the day with dr group
[02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:08.040]  in studio they'll be opening the phones up as well
[02:35:08.040 --> 02:35:10.920]  and then of course we'll be back tonight seven o'clock central info wars
[02:35:10.920 --> 02:35:13.800]  not only news back tomorrow with a weekday broadcast as well
[02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:17.080]  tucker carlson of the daily caller dot com one of the founders of one of the
[02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:20.440]  owners of it joins us i could say one of the main
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:24.120]  pundits and analysts too on fox news and even though fox news has millions of
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:26.680]  viewers an hour i really just think it's a bigger deal to have your own
[02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:30.040]  successful news organization that has journals all over the country
[02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:34.120]  and all over the world because the dinosaur media and fox will be the
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:37.960]  last to go really is on its way out and i don't know what
[02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:42.520]  the establishment is going to do in the wake of that i just see how arrogant
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:45.640]  and delusional even mainstream reporters are
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:50.600]  to this day i mean obama's average youtube video gets like five thousand now
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:54.360]  uh when some you know kid reporting from middle nowhere gets five million
[02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:58.040]  and it's not just five million ones or twice or ten times or 20 times
[02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:04.120]  it's consistently now for new media and i'm a well-known libertarian conspiracy
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:07.080]  theorists call it whatever you want i don't believe a word these people say
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:11.960]  and they also take out of context what we do talk about but it hasn't worked
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:15.080]  and so before tucker gets into topics that i know are near and dear to his heart
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:19.000]  because i want to hear these wildcards i want to ask him though i don't think we
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:23.080]  can really underestimate because i think i did i mean i i didn't support mccain
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:26.440]  or obama and i think that was a mistake even though mccain's horrible i
[02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:30.360]  underestimated obama but i mean i look at the average
[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:33.720]  democrat now with these men on the streets we do in austin and in california
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:38.440]  you know we're not in the beltway and i mean these democrats nine out of ten say
[02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:42.120]  we go for obama we're going to put gun owners in forced labor camps
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:46.520]  and uh we're going to execute them i mean and they say yeah i'm sick of these
[02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:49.240]  gun owners we're like so you want to put them in prison and
[02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:52.920]  so next time we go out we want to kill them yeah let's kill them
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:56.680]  uh i mean look at people saying kill trump these are mainline people
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:37:00.040]  saying go ices kill trump and they're not even radical muslims
[02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:03.800]  it just seems like it's now more like a dumbed-down power cult
[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:07.560]  like the nazis or the soviets i don't know how to describe them but
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:11.160]  these aren't the democrats i grew up around who you'd agree with on a bunch
[02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:13.640]  of points and you know disagree with some
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:17.480]  these are like deranged crazy people in my view do you agree with that or what
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:20.920]  would you call them or what are they mutating into
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:24.280]  you know it's a great question all the attention is on how the republican
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:27.480]  party has changed and it's more extreme and no it has changed in a lot of ways
[02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:29.720]  but not as much as the democratic party has changed
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:33.560]  the democratic party from our light i were about the same edge for our lifetimes
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:36.920]  was the party of kind of the faculty lounge
[02:37:36.920 --> 02:37:41.400]  affluent white intellectuals on college campuses of course of minority voters
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:44.760]  and of the poor but it was also the party of like the working man they always
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:47.320]  claimed that and they were right actually the average wage earner was a
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:49.160]  democrat because he thought the party was on his side
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:52.520]  it is no longer that the democratic party is the party of left-wing
[02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:56.520]  intellectuals and of people who are wholly dependent on government we need
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:37:59.800]  government help and so of course democratic parties are a natural home
[02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:03.320]  there's nobody in the middle they don't represent normal people anymore so it's
[02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:07.000]  a game it's a game it's a game it's completely isn't so
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:13.320]  without the leavening effect of normal people with jobs and families and you
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:16.280]  know and maybe a week of deer hunting every fall
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:20.360]  they have no reference points for what's normal and the authoritarian impulse
[02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:23.640]  which has always been on the left because the left believes the politics is the
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:27.240]  way to improve the world and human nature itself so they take politics much
[02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:31.240]  more seriously than the right does for sure that authoritarian impulse is has
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:35.080]  nothing to hold it back that's right they it's in full flower and the gun issue i
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:38.120]  don't even talk about it much on the air because it makes me too emotional
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:41.000]  and i become tongue-tied because it makes me so angry but i'll just make the
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.400]  obvious point i know your viewers agree with but
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:46.520]  they're not even pretending that gun control will make the country safer
[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:49.800]  because it demonstrably won't or prevent terrorism that's absurd they don't even
[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:53.320]  try they're basically just saying that anybody with a gun or certain
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:56.920]  kinds of guns is prima facie evil which is to say they're part of
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:00.120]  another culture one that we're not a part of that needs to be stamped out and
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:02.840]  destroyed and let's just go ahead and use this
[02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:07.080]  national crisis to hurt these people i mean that's kind of their their open
[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:09.800]  pits are not even pretending anymore it's really ominous
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:13.320]  very well said i couldn't say it that good that crystallized again
[02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:16.200]  which is really your skill at just boiling down this
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:19.640]  they are a cult of totalitarian intellectuals
[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:23.320]  who want total power see everyone else is an enemy
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:27.000]  uh they have radicalized their party which is radicalized the republican
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:30.520]  party but they are the real drivers of that then they have this giant
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:35.240]  constituency that don't work who are scared and programmed by the lies
[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:39.400]  that the intellectual left is telling them so it's a giant gang
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:43.560]  run by a control freak cult waging war on the family
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:48.200]  language the individual uh it's it's it's a nightmare scenario
[02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:52.600]  i think that is true and the most lasting damage they will do though
[02:39:52.600 --> 02:39:57.240]  is introducing a hard kind of ethnic politics into american life
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:40:01.160]  where their appeals are explicitly racial republicans are white they hate
[02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:02.920]  you they don't understand you they're
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:05.640]  unreasonably racist this is the president's point and almost every
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:09.000]  address he gives the real threat is bigotry here at home
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:12.120]  it scares the hell out of people there are a lot of non-white voters who i
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:15.400]  think are open-minded who know they're not being served by the democratic party
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:18.920]  who might be willing to look elsewhere but they can't understandably they
[02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:22.200]  can't because they've been told for generations that the republican party
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:24.360]  hates them because of the way they look
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:27.400]  and once you think somebody hates you you're not open to appeals from that
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:29.960]  person or that group anymore you shut down
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:34.040]  right and so they've created really they've been instrumental in creating
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:37.800]  a really tough kind of ethnic politics that doesn't go away
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:41.160]  these wounds linger and the one thing you don't want in your country is ethnic
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:44.200]  politics because it's not resolvable if you and i disagree on an issue
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:47.160]  issues come and go you know they're resolved
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:50.520]  our ethnicity is immutable it doesn't change and so if we hate each other
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:53.640]  because of our ethnic differences our children will hate each other because
[02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:56.600]  of their ethnic differences this is the story of world history
[02:40:56.600 --> 02:40:59.080]  it's the story of the tower of babel of the broken
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:02.600]  coalition strategy where everyone's so divided and conquered
[02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:05.800]  you can never agree about a second amendment or private property right
[02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:10.120]  or sovereignty or anything because you're just too obsessed over your
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:13.640]  identity politics exactly and that man you don't even
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:16.520]  it's a very effective way to mobilize voters by the way if you have a candidate
[02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:20.040]  like hillary who doesn't have a very impressive record to run on she's not
[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:22.760]  going to be running on her tenure as secretary of state or her
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:25.880]  years as senator from new york i mean there's nothing to talk about so she's
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:29.800]  going to be running on ethnic politics identity politics entirely i'm a woman
[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:32.920]  my opponent is not you're mad at your ex-husband vote for me or it's time to
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:36.200]  give a woman a shot and they're the white party
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:39.800]  you resent them they have things that are rightfully yours
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:43.880]  vote for me boy that works i mean it'll probably get her elected
[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:47.320]  or it could get her elected in any case but it will have
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:50.920]  effects that our grandchildren will be living with and that are very unhappy
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:53.800]  and very dangerous they shouldn't do that i've seen these news articles where
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:56.040]  it'll show like 20 30 40 women depending on the
[02:41:56.040 --> 02:41:59.880]  article it'll say the women of hillary or the women press of hillary right and
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:04.280]  they admit it's ideology they do whatever she says because she's a woman
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:08.120]  and they're kind of advertising out in the open that they've gotten rid of any
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:12.280]  you know real journalistic integrity and i think a lot of this is because the
[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:16.440]  republicans back when my grandfather was becoming a republican you know the
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:21.400]  first in the family's history in in texas he come back from world war two
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:24.440]  he thought it was wrong that black people are being discriminated against
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:28.040]  right he became a republican ran for office and he's texas won
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:31.000]  the family got mad at him but accepted it but the point was
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:34.120]  the republicans passed the civil rights act in the late fifties
[02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:37.800]  their eisenhower sending in the troops to integrate the schools
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:41.880]  uh the republicans have the moral high ground and then they start losing
[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:46.040]  elections so they do the southern strategy flip start acting like democrats
[02:42:46.040 --> 02:42:48.520]  in the south the democrats flip and then
[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:52.280]  start doing minority politics they're the original party of the clan
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:55.160]  the republicans played that game for a decade
[02:42:55.160 --> 02:42:59.400]  got branded got set up and now we're dealing with
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:03.960]  the most sinister sneaky and i've been around some high level democrats before
[02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:06.840]  years ago and they're really racist cold-blooded
[02:43:06.840 --> 02:43:09.880]  weirdo criminals at the top and i've got to say that they're
[02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:13.880]  they're the mafia and and the sad little democrats
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:16.760]  just don't know who's leading them around mother knows i mean i'm ranting
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:20.040]  but can you speak to the party of the clan of the democrats
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:24.360]  again the key difference between the left and right is the left means it if you
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:27.240]  talk to the average staff on a republican campaign he'll say
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:29.880]  i really hope my candidate wins he's better than the other guy but if he
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:32.760]  loses i'll become a lobbyist to play golf or move to a mortal beach or whatever
[02:43:32.760 --> 02:43:35.000]  life will continue i'll get on with the business of my
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.040]  life which is not inherently political if you talk to the average democratic
[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:41.880]  consultant he'll say my guy is the best guy ever to run the
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:45.080]  other guy is evil everything hangs in the balance this will not be a
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:48.600]  constitutional republic if we lose like they invest meaning in politics that
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:51.080]  republicans can't even comprehend because for your average
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:54.040]  conservative or libertarian or even garden variety republican politics is
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:57.480]  something you do in order to create space to do the things that really matter
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:00.520]  like get married have children have a business go to church
[02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:03.800]  it's what makes that possible for democrats it's an end in itself so of
[02:44:03.800 --> 02:44:06.840]  course they're willing to do things that republicans
[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:10.200]  wouldn't even conceive of doing they're they're always going to be the guy who
[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:13.880]  cares more about something is always going to be better at doing it
[02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:16.600]  and that's why democrats have an inherent advantage they're only
[02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:19.080]  disadvantages the average person doesn't agree with them
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:22.920]  but really over time that doesn't matter because they just imported new people
[02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:25.960]  who do agree with that was my next question do you agree that we've reached
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:28.840]  a crossroads and that the republicans have been doing
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:31.800]  some of the right things going out and running quote minority candidates because
[02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:35.240]  i don't have your black ispanic white just don't take my guns keep my taxes
[02:44:35.240 --> 02:44:37.400]  love you had green skin i'd vote for you for president
[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:40.600]  you know if you weren't supporting tyranny i mean
[02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:44.440]  do you think we're in danger of having a one party system
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:48.840]  the democrats on the national level we are not on the state level i mean there
[02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:51.480]  are plenty of states i mean republicans have done great
[02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:54.760]  and maybe not that it's really mattered but they've done great in the last
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:58.280]  three cycles in the states they have more governorships and they've had in
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:00.200]  generations they have more state houses
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:03.480]  and they have obviously a big majority in congress biggest in 70 years
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:07.960]  etc etc but for a national election a presidential election the math is such
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:10.920]  that's gonna be very difficult and most republicans know this on a gut level
[02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:14.520]  to win after this cycle simply because the demographics are just so very
[02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:17.000]  different much more different than people understand
[02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.960]  the average person i'm included lives in a neighborhood that kind of looks like
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:22.600]  the neighborhood you grew up in same kind of people
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:26.440]  but that's not america once you get outside of your own little bubble and
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:29.160]  see the country you see that it's totally different and by the way
[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:32.680]  that's not all bad not all changes every all changes a mixed blessing some of
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:35.640]  it is good but from a political point of view it is
[02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:40.120]  absolutely death for the republicans that was the plan from day one
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:43.080]  they ignored it or didn't know about it and now they're they're staring down
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:47.560]  the barrel of elections they can't win and the consequences obviously the
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:51.160]  consequences are that the things that we've taken for granted i mean the
[02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:53.960]  core things we took for granted the right to bear arms the right to speak
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:57.560]  freely the right to disagree with the majority the right to assemble the
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:00.840]  right to privacy things that we thought were constitutionally guaranteed
[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:04.120]  suddenly nobody cares that's right and now you can see
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:06.760]  so phase and now the democrats know they're just a
[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:11.160]  an election or two away from total domination right you see the criminal
[02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:15.880]  energy the crazed eyes the we're gonna arrest you we're gonna kill you
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:19.000]  we're gonna take your guns i mean you're i mean it really is
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:23.560]  brown shirt energy i'm seeing and man it's really frightening
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:27.480]  well it's power worship and in the end all power worship looks the same you
[02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:31.240]  can dress it up as bolshevism or islamism or whatever
[02:46:31.240 --> 02:46:35.640]  you want to call it but it's always the same it's you will do
[02:46:35.640 --> 02:46:38.920]  my bidding you will act out my will or you will be crushed
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:42.280]  and by the way all of this here's okay the my
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:46.680]  my core belief is that the islamist movement is a reaction
[02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:50.520]  against massive changes in the world economy so
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:54.840]  it had an agrarian world that was totally overturned by the industrial
[02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:58.440]  revolution it displaced a lot of people you had a lot of anxiety and out of
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:01.160]  that you've got bolshevism you got worldwide communism which lasted for
[02:47:01.160 --> 02:47:04.200]  70 years that ended we have another massive change
[02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:07.160]  going from an industrial economy to a digital economy people are completely
[02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:10.200]  freaked out and they're seeking solace in nations that haven't been able to
[02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:13.560]  compete in the digital economy mostly the middle east
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:17.240]  and in africa they're taking solace in islamism this
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:23.400]  is not just a religious movement it's a reaction against radical global change
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:26.600]  and that makes that's meaningful because it makes it
[02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:31.720]  so much more dangerous this could pop up anywhere it's a way for people who are
[02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:35.800]  not succeeding in this new world to say yes my life has meaning
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:39.400]  i'm going to strike out against people who are succeeding who i'm envious of
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:42.120]  who i think are responsible are responsible for my failure
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:45.080]  i mean this is a big thing you didn't think about this in terms of
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:51.320]  the cold war 1952 this is an existential threat to the western way of life
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:55.720]  i really believe that tucker carlson thank you so much for the time in the
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:47:58.840]  minute we've got left any other points that we
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:02.520]  should know about that you're looking at that are on the radar screen
[02:48:02.520 --> 02:48:06.920]  the only thing i would say is i recently changed my view on guns
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:13.160]  and i think the lever action 357 38 is this single flattish shooting nicest
[02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:16.520]  gun i've ever owned and i have a lot of different rifles up in main
[02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:20.760]  i have my own shooting range this gun is fantastic you can deer hunt with it in
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:24.600]  the 357 the ammo is literally cheaper 38 is literally
[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:28.200]  cheaper than high-end 22s right now it's just a terrific gun it's often
[02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:31.160]  overlooked because people think it's so old-fashioned and i gotta have a black
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:35.960]  gun i gotta have an m4 which gun is that it's a rossy
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:40.120]  lever action 357 i got one of those it's not rossy but those are great
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:43.960]  you can even shoot wild hogs with us you can and it's totally cheap it's like
[02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:48.520]  400 bucks it's flat shooting it no recoil it's just a
[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:52.520]  fantastic rifle and the ammo is going to be the last to be banned i'm totally
[02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:55.320]  convinced of course you don't stock in rossy
[02:48:55.320 --> 02:49:01.000]  yes i wish i did i wish i did rossy has some nice hand guns and shot guns and
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.720]  rifle very inexpensive i love them i probably got

[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:28.040]  war on christmas meme and uh showed the marines at ewo jima
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:31.320]  hoisting up a christmas tree and we said come and take it

[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:47.480]  dark age they're trying to bring in and then runner up is kenneth webb
[02:50:47.480 --> 02:50:51.160]  who of course has changed the channel and has much more documentaries posted i
[02:50:51.160 --> 02:50:55.000]  think there's like 40 million views of my documentaries on his channel
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:59.400]  just another channel out there that has our videos with like 40 million views
[02:50:59.400 --> 02:51:03.560]  again just letting you know we are the media we are dominant now we're
[02:51:03.560 --> 02:51:08.600]  bigger than cnn and msnbc combined can you think about that
[02:51:08.600 --> 02:51:12.520]  we just got three or four shows we're only here five hours a day
[02:51:12.520 --> 02:51:18.040]  and we are clearly now bigger than cnn domestically and msnbc
[02:51:18.040 --> 02:51:22.120]  we are bigger than any one fox show with two three four million viewers their
[02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:26.360]  top shows but look at how arrogant bill o'reilly is up there
[02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:30.040]  but i love that fact and in a year we'll be bigger than fox
[02:51:30.040 --> 02:51:35.000]  i mean that's why the system is panicking folks that's why
[02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:38.360]  these things are happening because we're just a bellwether info wars is just
[02:51:38.360 --> 02:51:41.400]  one little one little organization out there
[02:51:41.400 --> 02:51:46.760]  that is indicative of the establishment in freefall right now
[02:51:46.760 --> 02:51:50.600]  now let's go ahead and go to the winner uh this
[02:51:50.600 --> 02:51:54.520]  video will be posted info wars dot com in the next few minutes of your radio
[02:51:54.520 --> 02:51:59.080]  listeners you can see it for yourself uh at your leisure but the winner
[02:51:59.080 --> 02:52:05.080]  of the obama uh oval office speech analysis contest we'll come up with a
[02:52:05.080 --> 02:52:07.560]  better name i think i forget the exact name of the contest
[02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:10.520]  because i'm just doing these so quick now but to hear it
[02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:14.600]  hi it's rooper today's episode is brought to you by bugs and killers and
[02:52:14.600 --> 02:52:17.560]  also
[02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:21.800]  this is my analysis of president obama's san bernadino speech i will start off
[02:52:21.800 --> 02:52:25.640]  with the speech's most blatant contradiction so far we have no evidence
[02:52:25.640 --> 02:52:29.240]  that the killers were directed by a terrorist organization overseas
[02:52:29.240 --> 02:52:32.680]  or that they were part of a broader conspiracy here at home we see
[02:52:32.680 --> 02:52:36.760]  growing efforts by terrorists to poison the minds of people like
[02:52:36.760 --> 02:52:40.600]  the boston marathon bombers and the san bernadino killers
[02:52:40.600 --> 02:52:46.120]  okay so which is it there is or isn't an influence from overseas but it is clear
[02:52:46.120 --> 02:52:49.640]  that the two of them have had gone down the dark path of radicalization
[02:52:49.640 --> 02:52:53.080]  and where is this exactly i'm on the internet all the time i've never seen
[02:52:53.080 --> 02:52:56.440]  anything like that of you in the next few clips he's actually reminding us
[02:52:56.440 --> 02:52:59.720]  that he is in charge of the military as commander-in-chief i have no greater
[02:52:59.720 --> 02:53:03.000]  responsibility than the security of the american people wait a minute that
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.560]  sounds a little familiar in the process we've hardened our
[02:53:05.560 --> 02:53:09.000]  defenses from airports to financial centers to other
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:12.600]  critical infrastructure intelligence and law enforcement agencies
[02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:15.960]  have disrupted countless plots here and overseas
[02:53:15.960 --> 02:53:19.720]  and worked around the clock to keep us safe oh yeah i know where i've heard
[02:53:19.720 --> 02:53:23.480]  that before oh what's that guy's name um
[02:53:23.480 --> 02:53:27.640]  george bush we will destroy isle and any other organization that tries to
[02:53:27.640 --> 02:53:31.000]  harm us as far as i'm concerned this is a george
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:36.280]  bush speech first our military will continue to hunt down terrorist plotters
[02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:40.360]  in any country where it is necessary and that right there is a very george bush
[02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:45.000]  like declaration of war on everybody terrorists turned to less complicated
[02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:48.280]  acts of violence like the mass shootings that are all too common
[02:53:48.280 --> 02:53:51.480]  in our society what he's saying is they've got the airports locked down but
[02:53:51.480 --> 02:53:55.480]  they're still coming for you at the mall it is this type of attack that we saw
[02:53:55.480 --> 02:53:59.880]  at fort hood in 2009 all right i guess we can call that a terrorist attack now
[02:53:59.880 --> 02:54:04.120]  and since the day i took this office i have authorized u.s forces
[02:54:04.120 --> 02:54:09.240]  to take out terrorists abroad take that you confused anti-war obama supporters
[02:54:09.240 --> 02:54:13.160]  our closest allies including france germany and the united kingdom together
[02:54:13.160 --> 02:54:16.760]  with 65 countries that have joined an american-led coalition so we've got a
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:21.080]  65 country coalition and a declaration of war on everybody
[02:54:21.080 --> 02:54:24.440]  can we just go ahead and call this world war three yet we will continue to
[02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:28.520]  provide training and equipment to tens of thousands of iraqi and syrian forces
[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:31.640]  i got a better idea why don't you try providing people here with training and
[02:54:31.640 --> 02:54:34.680]  equipment to begin with congress should act to make sure
[02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:38.040]  no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun
[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:42.680]  really how is the no-fly list now not the no-gun list i think we should add a
[02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:47.080]  third random thing to the list like tacos hey man you want to go get
[02:54:47.080 --> 02:54:49.800]  mexican food oh man you know i can't i'm on the no-taco
[02:54:49.800 --> 02:54:53.080]  we should put in place stronger screening for those who come to america
[02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:56.040]  without a visa raise your hand if you didn't know you could do that so that we
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:54:59.800]  can take a hard look at whether they've traveled to war zones i'll just ask them
[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:02.760]  i'm sure they'll tell you now even though earlier this week some guy was like
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:07.320]  this guy is such a pussy i don't remember george bush
[02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:11.240]  doing he's actually asking for a declaration of war if congress believes
[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:16.120]  as i do that we are at war with isaac it should go ahead and vote to
[02:55:16.120 --> 02:55:19.720]  authorize the continued use of military force against these terrorists we
[02:55:19.720 --> 02:55:23.400]  should not be drawn once more into a long and costly
[02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:26.920]  ground war that is code for they're going to spend a lot of money on
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:30.680]  technology and they are going to bomb the crap out of some people then i
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:34.280]  can't help but feel like he's proselytizing for islam a bit we cannot
[02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:38.520]  turn against one another by letting this fight be defined
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:42.440]  as a war between america and islam including millions of patriotic muslim
[02:55:42.440 --> 02:55:45.720]  americans for the vast majority of terrorist victims around the world
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:49.720]  are muslim we must enlist muslim communities rather than push them away
[02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:53.400]  that's cool but can christians buddhists and hindus get a shout out to
[02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:56.680]  separation of church and state let's not forget that freedom
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:00.840]  is more powerful than fear that we have always met challenges whether war or
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:04.440]  depression natural disasters or terrorist attacks
[02:56:04.440 --> 02:56:08.200]  by coming together i have no doubt that america will prevail
[02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:11.720]  so it's blatantly obvious to me that this speech is about
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:17.080]  using the no fly list as a no gun list and it's also a speech about obama
[02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:21.240]  getting ready to use the military in a more massive way than he ever has
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:25.000]  i will always refer to this speech as obama's george bush speech he is
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.800]  evoking his power as commander-in-chief however it's being done
[02:56:27.800 --> 02:56:30.840]  so in such a manner because of his constituency
[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:33.800]  all right ladies and gentlemen thank you for watching episode 60 of hyatt's
[02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:37.240]  rupert which is also a submission to info wars

[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:05.320]  people um old people people who are disabled they pushed one guy in the
[03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:08.200]  street who you know this guy can uh can bear you know
[03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:11.800]  his trouble walking and i mean it's just amazing how these people just
[03:01:11.800 --> 03:01:15.480]  totally did not like the fact that we were out exercising our right to free
[03:01:15.480 --> 03:01:18.680]  speech we didn't bother them when they were putting up their signs they started
[03:01:18.680 --> 03:01:22.200]  making homemade signs we didn't say anything to them but then they started
[03:01:22.200 --> 03:01:26.280]  launching into us grabbing microphones they ripped a microphone out of alex
[03:01:26.280 --> 03:01:29.640]  jones's hand and then proceeded to run away but just
[03:01:29.640 --> 03:01:33.880]  distasteful tactics and is of course something like this a shooting
[03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:37.400]  at a planned parenthood clinic is distasteful and
[03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:41.560]  we definitely don't uh agree with that here at info wars and hopefully nobody
[03:01:41.560 --> 03:01:45.160]  is seriously hurt but it appears that the gumma may be barricaded inside and
[03:01:45.160 --> 03:01:47.960]  we'll be bringing you more information about this
[03:01:47.960 --> 03:01:52.360]  uh now amongst all this other black friday madness i'm going to get into some
[03:01:52.360 --> 03:01:55.880]  articles about weaponized drones especially ground
[03:01:55.880 --> 03:02:00.280]  drones uh china has unveiled armed attack robots armed with guns and
[03:02:00.280 --> 03:02:04.200]  grenades and this is nothing new we've seen this in the united states
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:08.200]  um the army is testing remote controlled weapons towers
[03:02:08.200 --> 03:02:12.760]  so all these uh devices being built are going to have their own
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:16.840]  type of uh command system which will either you know it's going to look at
[03:02:16.840 --> 03:02:19.960]  things or if you don't have the right biometric if you don't have the right
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:24.280]  walk if they perceive any type of threat they may open fire on you
[03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:28.600]  whether you're uh you know whether you need to be open fire on or not so that
[03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:31.640]  is really concerning and that just brings to mind
[03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:35.720]  these terminator robot scenarios that we've seen movies about and just this
[03:02:35.720 --> 03:02:39.160]  is the beginning of it we're now seeing like uh i guess this is the first
[03:02:39.160 --> 03:02:43.480]  inning of this robot situation we're in i'm going to be playing a report also
[03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:48.520]  from john bound why celebrating black friday means you're a complete idiot

[03:08:26.760 --> 03:08:30.440]  and uh or what you're not thankful for maybe it's the intruding government
[03:08:30.440 --> 03:08:33.080]  that wants to control every aspect of your life
[03:08:33.080 --> 03:08:37.320]  and tax the bejesus out of you in the process i've got a caller from paris
[03:08:37.320 --> 03:08:40.040]  i'm going to go to right after we play this video so
[03:08:40.040 --> 03:08:44.120]  stay tight i think it's why lead in paris wants to talk about the paris attacks
[03:08:44.120 --> 03:08:47.960]  stay stay on the line with us buddy we will be with you right after this report
[03:08:47.960 --> 03:08:52.840]  i'm going to roll some videos from some black friday deals there they are
[03:08:52.840 --> 03:08:55.960]  opening the floodgates and everybody's mobbing in
[03:08:55.960 --> 03:08:59.400]  to get their free goodies we have a report coming up from john bound black
[03:08:59.400 --> 03:09:02.200]  friday is now unofficially a global holiday phenomenon the day after
[03:09:02.200 --> 03:09:05.080]  thanksgiving that harkens the beginning of the month long
[03:09:05.080 --> 03:09:08.520]  celebration of consumerism regardless of the fact that americans can't even
[03:09:08.520 --> 03:09:12.120]  afford the holiday system 62 have less than a thousand
[03:09:12.120 --> 03:09:16.200]  in savings and 21 don't have any savings at all
[03:09:16.200 --> 03:09:19.480]  and for instance the megasol sucking walmart chains deliver chinese goods to
[03:09:19.480 --> 03:09:22.440]  the most depleted american population while slave wage
[03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:25.640]  walmart employees are subsidized by our tax dollars
[03:09:25.640 --> 03:09:28.840]  and uh he talks about the history of this as well how it goes back to the 19th
[03:09:28.840 --> 03:09:31.960]  century gold swindling conspiracy so we're
[03:09:31.960 --> 03:09:35.160]  going to get into all that and he ends it with of course
[03:09:35.160 --> 03:09:38.600]  merry christmas zombies because there they are right there looking for their
[03:09:38.600 --> 03:09:44.120]  free goods our cheap goods i mean this is just crazy what we've become and how
[03:09:44.120 --> 03:09:48.280]  this is all just meant to condition us to buy these
[03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:51.640]  products that have a little or no significance in your life
[03:09:51.640 --> 03:09:57.480]  overall so that is uh you can watch more that just type in black friday madness
[03:09:57.480 --> 03:10:00.440]  in youtube and you can find other people that have put up videos so let's go now
[03:10:00.440 --> 03:10:07.720]  to john bounds reporting we're going to go to our caller from paris
[03:10:07.720 --> 03:10:13.000]  black friday is now unofficially a global holiday phenomenon the day after
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:15.880]  thanksgiving that harkens the beginning of the month-long
[03:10:15.880 --> 03:10:20.520]  celebration of consumerism regardless of the fact that most americans can't even
[03:10:20.520 --> 03:10:24.520]  afford the holiday season 62 of americans have
[03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:28.680]  less than a thousand dollars in savings and 21 percent
[03:10:28.680 --> 03:10:31.800]  don't have savings at all sales expected to reach
[03:10:31.800 --> 03:10:38.040]  80 billion dollars in the u.s we made it the average american spending close to
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:41.720]  400 dollars throughout the holiday weekend while the mega soul sucking
[03:10:41.720 --> 03:10:45.880]  walmart chains deliver chinese goods to most of the depleted american
[03:10:45.880 --> 03:10:49.400]  population while slave wage walmart employees are
[03:10:49.400 --> 03:10:54.680]  subsidized by our tax dollars allowing the scrooge walton family to rip out the
[03:10:54.680 --> 03:10:57.800]  heart of america and crush small business
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:11:02.040]  the irony is that black friday stems from a 19th century
[03:11:02.040 --> 03:11:06.920]  gold swindling conspiracy and now in the name of almighty consumerism
[03:11:06.920 --> 03:11:10.120]  americans are being swindled out of their last dimes
[03:11:10.120 --> 03:11:16.600]  ethics and common sense i'm a handy consumer and you know
[03:11:16.600 --> 03:11:20.840]  i'm concerned about what my children consume
[03:11:20.840 --> 03:11:24.360]  i'd like to consume the barrel of a 12 day shop head right now if i could thank
[03:11:24.360 --> 03:11:29.080]  you because i'm gonna help black friday is a complete scam
[03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:33.080]  based around the manifestly provable hoax that consumers are getting
[03:11:33.080 --> 03:11:37.080]  huge discounts on products that would normally be more expensive
[03:11:37.080 --> 03:11:42.040]  at any other time of year in reality stores enjoy higher profit margins
[03:11:42.040 --> 03:11:46.360]  during the holiday period because retailers artificially inflate prices
[03:11:46.360 --> 03:11:50.040]  of goods in the months before black friday in
[03:11:50.040 --> 03:11:53.960]  order to make the subsequent discounts look good in comparison
[03:11:53.960 --> 03:11:58.280]  as the wall street journal highlights the idea of black friday discounts is a
[03:11:58.280 --> 03:12:01.560]  complete hoax achieved via the process of price
[03:12:01.560 --> 03:12:06.040]  massaging throughout the rest of the year the scam also relies on shoppers
[03:12:06.040 --> 03:12:08.600]  impulse buying another product that has a 98
[03:12:08.600 --> 03:12:12.760]  percent markup value so even if the first item represents a
[03:12:12.760 --> 03:12:17.480]  genuine discount the vastly inflated price of the impulse purchase
[03:12:17.480 --> 03:12:22.440]  more than makes up for it in many cases the supposedly great deals that people
[03:12:22.440 --> 03:12:26.840]  will sacrifice endless hours of their time camping outside stores to take
[03:12:26.840 --> 03:12:30.440]  advantage of are already available online
[03:12:30.440 --> 03:12:34.600]  anyway and can be found for even cheaper in january
[03:12:34.600 --> 03:12:38.440]  but hey nothing says christmas like braving the cold on
[03:12:38.440 --> 03:12:42.840]  thanksgiving night to rip a vegetable steamer out of the hands of an innocent
[03:12:42.840 --> 03:12:53.640]  little kid
[03:12:53.640 --> 03:12:57.080]  what is behind the horrifying phenomenon of
[03:12:57.080 --> 03:13:02.120]  black friday and other extreme consumerist
[03:13:02.120 --> 03:13:08.840]  riots what is behind it is the madness of a lost society people that believe in
[03:13:08.840 --> 03:13:13.080]  hype people that believe in mainstream media lies
[03:13:13.080 --> 03:13:16.120]  folks that don't know that black friday is one of the worst days of the year to
[03:13:16.120 --> 03:13:20.040]  go out and find sales these are the same type of crowds that believe in
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:24.040]  obama cure and thought that it would really be a free ride
[03:13:24.040 --> 03:13:29.080]  or who go and buy lottery tickets that's their future business plan
[03:13:29.080 --> 03:13:33.480]  that's their retirement plan these are born suckers
[03:13:33.480 --> 03:13:36.600]  and statistically there are more and more of them
[03:13:36.600 --> 03:13:47.000]  mary christmas zombies john bound for info wars dot com
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:51.400]  and of course we ended that report with the evil racist misogynist saying of
[03:13:51.400 --> 03:13:54.680]  mary christmas which i think is another report we're going to go out and do
[03:13:54.680 --> 03:13:57.720]  talk to people about do they say mary christmas do they say happy holidays
[03:13:57.720 --> 03:14:01.320]  do they say happy kwanzaa do they say happy hanukah what do they say
[03:14:01.320 --> 03:14:04.600]  and if they're if someone approaches them with something that's not of their
[03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:09.480]  faith do they freak out and recoil and basically melt in a pool of their own
[03:14:09.480 --> 03:14:13.160]  ooze it just really makes you wonder all the
[03:14:13.160 --> 03:14:18.440]  political correctness we're going on and being enveloped by and crushed by

[03:15:39.880 --> 03:15:43.320]  percent certain like i've i've been following this and i'm 100 percent
[03:15:43.320 --> 03:15:46.360]  certain that paul joseph watson is leading an
[03:15:46.360 --> 03:15:49.800]  anti-islam propaganda he lost the side verses out of their
[03:15:49.800 --> 03:15:52.520]  context and just rob just please go and check the
[03:15:52.520 --> 03:15:57.000]  translation of the word islam just check check it out it means peace and it means
[03:15:57.000 --> 03:16:00.280]  submission to god so i don't know what what is making him
[03:16:00.280 --> 03:16:05.000]  i mean what is making alex letting him do this uh i would love to hear an answer
[03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:07.880]  from you because i know that you could speak on behalf of alex
[03:16:07.880 --> 03:16:12.760]  thank you well i cannot speak on behalf of alex alex speaks on behalf of
[03:16:12.760 --> 03:16:16.200]  himself and i will say this about islam somebody
[03:16:16.200 --> 03:16:20.440]  sent me a video and it was made in 2014 you guys might even be able to pull it
[03:16:20.440 --> 03:16:25.080]  up but it was in norway and it's it's at a muslim
[03:16:25.080 --> 03:16:27.400]  i don't i don't know if it's a prayer meeting or get together whatever they're
[03:16:27.400 --> 03:16:30.440]  having it was a room full of people who claim to be muslims
[03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:33.800]  and they're being led by a guy and he says you know how many of you are
[03:16:33.800 --> 03:16:36.760]  moderate consider yourselves moderate muslims and
[03:16:36.760 --> 03:16:40.600]  90 of them raise their hands and then he talks about the the punishments that
[03:16:40.600 --> 03:16:44.680]  are listed in the quran he talks about stoning cutting off limbs
[03:16:44.680 --> 03:16:48.440]  uh how many people believe in those and they raise their hands
[03:16:48.440 --> 03:16:52.200]  everyone he goes to see you know people always complain that when we have these
[03:16:52.200 --> 03:16:55.400]  talks that we were bringing up extremist and radicals
[03:16:55.400 --> 03:16:58.360]  and he goes these people aren't extremist and radical
[03:16:58.360 --> 03:17:01.560]  and so that's what he's saying that their religion
[03:17:01.560 --> 03:17:05.480]  believes in i i tweeted that out if yeah there's actually the uh the video right
[03:17:05.480 --> 03:17:08.680]  there what's the title of that video
[03:17:08.680 --> 03:17:13.720]  yeah the moderate muslim and it is i guess took place in 2014
[03:17:13.720 --> 03:17:19.960]  and i'm i'm i like to value people and look at people based on their actions
[03:17:19.960 --> 03:17:23.960]  and somewhat their words i know a lot of people say stuff
[03:17:23.960 --> 03:17:27.400]  either that they don't mean or you know in the heat of the moment but actions
[03:17:27.400 --> 03:17:31.320]  is really what i really you know judge people on so
[03:17:31.320 --> 03:17:35.640]  when people like the islamic state are throwing people
[03:17:35.640 --> 03:17:40.760]  off roofs for their sexual orientation i think that's wrong and i don't think
[03:17:40.760 --> 03:17:43.320]  we should be doing that i don't think anybody should be doing that i think we
[03:17:43.320 --> 03:17:47.880]  should all be working together to make the species of man
[03:17:47.880 --> 03:17:52.120]  as good as it can be and really launching ourselves
[03:17:52.120 --> 03:17:57.640]  in two areas like better technologies uh free energy even you know that's the
[03:17:57.640 --> 03:17:59.560]  areas that i think we should be working towards
[03:17:59.560 --> 03:18:03.320]  not about knitting each other over our religious beliefs
[03:18:03.320 --> 03:18:07.480]  and um so but i don't speak for alex i don't speak for paul joseph watson
[03:18:07.480 --> 03:18:10.440]  but when i see videos like that the moderate muslim and these people are
[03:18:10.440 --> 03:18:14.840]  saying you know they believe in stoning they believe in and death for adultery
[03:18:14.840 --> 03:18:18.040]  um you know i don't agree with that at all
[03:18:18.040 --> 03:18:21.880]  and uh so that's i guess that's where i stand on that thanks for calling
[03:18:21.880 --> 03:18:27.560]  while lead in paris uh next we have a dog leg in idao let's talk about fukushima

[03:24:16.200 --> 03:24:21.720]  Fukushima and the radioactive fallout and I guess the seawater that you're
[03:24:21.720 --> 03:24:25.560]  using to cool down the the meltdown rods are it's just
[03:24:25.560 --> 03:24:29.240]  being poured back into the ocean it's leaking we've seen the plumes we've
[03:24:29.240 --> 03:24:31.480]  seen the animations of the plumes we had a caller
[03:24:31.480 --> 03:24:35.560]  dog leg from Idaho was talking about a man named Dana Dernford
[03:24:35.560 --> 03:24:41.880]  and I did a quick search here's an update from 2015 of August 2000 200
[03:24:41.880 --> 03:24:44.520]  kilometers of Canadian Pacific coastline dead zone
[03:24:44.520 --> 03:24:47.720]  devoid of 99% of all life almost all tidal
[03:24:47.720 --> 03:24:52.840]  zone species missing entirely and a dog leg I'm going to let you finish up so
[03:24:52.840 --> 03:24:56.360]  this guy is being harassed by by other scientists are claiming he's
[03:24:56.360 --> 03:25:00.840]  threatening them well these so-called scientists
[03:25:00.840 --> 03:25:03.560]  they've been downplaying this you know huge cover-up
[03:25:03.560 --> 03:25:08.040]  we don't know this and they've you know kind of selectly
[03:25:08.040 --> 03:25:11.880]  taking some things he said online and use that to pretty much shut down his
[03:25:11.880 --> 03:25:14.760]  whole side and making take down everything
[03:25:14.760 --> 03:25:18.280]  and he's facing some pretty serious charges now
[03:25:18.280 --> 03:25:20.840]  well that's a problem with Canada can't it but if you don't say the right
[03:25:20.840 --> 03:25:23.320]  things in Canada they will throw the book at you and they'll
[03:25:23.320 --> 03:25:26.840]  allow other people to attack you if they don't like what you say
[03:25:26.840 --> 03:25:30.680]  as we just had the guest earlier the lawyer for the man who's
[03:25:30.680 --> 03:25:35.400]  just disagree with some feminists on Facebook and now he's being slammed
[03:25:35.400 --> 03:25:39.480]  and looking at jail time and fines I mean it's ridiculous what's going on
[03:25:39.480 --> 03:25:43.000]  with not being able to present two sides of an opinion why can't
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:46.360]  people disagree with other people and we still
[03:25:46.360 --> 03:25:50.920]  you know get along and not have to to do all this nonsense
[03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:54.200]  oh yes many many issues they're they're trying to shut down speech about

[03:26:00.840 --> 03:26:04.760]  Li Obama told was uh was Fukushima when he got on tv
[03:26:04.760 --> 03:26:07.880]  his family had already been flown to the southern hemisphere and
[03:26:07.880 --> 03:26:11.720]  he got on tv and told us it was all safe and he'd keep us informed
[03:26:11.720 --> 03:26:16.200]  and then himself and secretary to the energy secretary
[03:26:16.200 --> 03:26:24.120]  and the GE CEO what's his name
[03:26:24.120 --> 03:26:27.800]  they all flew down there right afterwards right after he gave that speech and
[03:26:27.800 --> 03:26:30.360]  you know stayed in the southern hemisphere till he got the all clear
[03:26:30.360 --> 03:26:34.680]  see you later everything's fine we'll be back yeah exactly it's just
[03:26:34.680 --> 03:26:38.680]  it's just crazy and the thing with radiation is you don't know if it affects
[03:26:38.680 --> 03:26:42.040]  you unless you're wearing you know one of those little dosometers
[03:26:42.040 --> 03:26:46.680]  um are you you're next to a you know some sort of counter that could
[03:26:46.680 --> 03:26:49.160]  measure the radiation that you're being affected with you're not going to know
[03:26:49.160 --> 03:26:52.600]  if that stuff's affecting you till five ten years down the road when all
[03:26:52.600 --> 03:26:55.080]  the sudden you're you know inundated with cancer
[03:26:55.080 --> 03:26:58.360]  clusters we we found a report uh was Josh Owens and Liam
[03:26:58.360 --> 03:27:01.960]  McAdoo who went to St. Louis and met with people who were living in these
[03:27:01.960 --> 03:27:04.760]  areas where they've been storing nuclear waste
[03:27:04.760 --> 03:27:08.760]  um next to a stream just open air and these kids were playing in the creek
[03:27:08.760 --> 03:27:12.200]  and everyone around them in their neighborhoods is winding up with cancer
[03:27:12.200 --> 03:27:15.560]  they're having autoimmune disorders so radiation is
[03:27:15.560 --> 03:27:19.160]  serious and if Fukushima you know is really dumping
[03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:22.920]  millions of gallons of toxic radiation water in
[03:27:22.920 --> 03:27:27.560]  to our our our Pacific Ocean and it's the currents are carrying it this way
[03:27:27.560 --> 03:27:30.440]  they're carrying it to Canada they're carrying it to the coast of Alaska
[03:27:30.440 --> 03:27:35.000]  they're carrying it to our west coast and if we're not straight with the people
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:38.440]  about how dangerous this really is we're we're doing everybody a disservice and
[03:27:38.440 --> 03:27:41.480]  that's why we sent a group of reporters out there when we were seeing high

[03:29:59.000 --> 03:30:02.520]  police departments across the country are now using
[03:30:02.520 --> 03:30:06.280]  an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays
[03:30:06.280 --> 03:30:11.000]  which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages
[03:30:11.000 --> 03:30:16.520]  without warrants the technology comes courtesy of the fbi
[03:30:16.520 --> 03:30:20.840]  who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure
[03:30:20.840 --> 03:30:25.400]  agreements forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology
[03:30:25.400 --> 03:30:29.560]  needless to say this is a direct violation of our fourth amendment
[03:30:29.560 --> 03:30:33.480]  and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying
[03:30:33.480 --> 03:30:37.160]  where we now know that police are collecting information on
[03:30:37.160 --> 03:30:40.840]  thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected

[03:33:34.920 --> 03:33:39.320]  on the fact that most black friday sales are a scam
[03:33:39.320 --> 03:33:43.720]  companies simply raise prices the week before and then lower them the week of
[03:33:43.720 --> 03:33:48.120]  normal prices and and some stores do give better deals on black friday
[03:33:48.120 --> 03:33:52.200]  but it's one of the worst days of the year to shop and this is just a classic
[03:33:52.200 --> 03:33:56.760]  example of how people get screwed over because of lack of knowledge
[03:33:56.760 --> 03:34:00.440]  because they're not informed but by going to info wars store dot com

[03:34:35.480 --> 03:34:40.120]  whatever fighting over toilet paper but then you're

[03:38:04.840 --> 03:38:10.040]  helping keep helping keep the beer gut at bay especially as you get up in in my
[03:38:10.040 --> 03:38:12.760]  age i want to do a quick update of what's going on in
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:16.920]  colorado apparently the government has they say he shot multiple people
[03:38:16.920 --> 03:38:20.200]  including at least three police officers this is out of the independent
[03:38:20.200 --> 03:38:23.800]  and he's barricaded himself inside the planned parenthood clinic
[03:38:23.800 --> 03:38:27.880]  the last check 15 minutes ago he was still inside the
[03:38:27.880 --> 03:38:31.320]  i'm sure there's going to be a giant swat team build up and they're going to
[03:38:31.320 --> 03:38:35.400]  launch in and hopefully no one else gets hurt in this
[03:38:35.400 --> 03:38:40.680]  and i just can't wait to see how this story unravels i mean this is
[03:38:40.680 --> 03:38:44.040]  obviously sickening for somebody to go on a shooting rampage
[03:38:44.040 --> 03:38:47.960]  especially when we really had planned parenthood up against the ropes
[03:38:47.960 --> 03:38:51.720]  exposing them non-violently through video through their
[03:38:51.720 --> 03:38:55.560]  own words destroying planned parenthood and what they stand for just showing
[03:38:55.560 --> 03:38:58.600]  them as baby part merchants that's what these people are
[03:38:58.600 --> 03:39:02.120]  now we have the hillary clinton free speech contest
[03:39:02.120 --> 03:39:05.640]  and i want to play this is a short video i'm going to play it's a
[03:39:05.640 --> 03:39:09.960]  actually 31 seconds long but it just goes that how short you can make a video
[03:39:09.960 --> 03:39:12.920]  to make a point and then i'm going to show you some that are in the longer
[03:39:12.920 --> 03:39:16.040]  five minute range because five minutes is the cutoff for that but let's go to
[03:39:16.040 --> 03:39:22.360]  this first one hillary clinton i think i am american info wars dot com

[03:39:44.920 --> 03:39:49.080]  there it is that's how quick quickly you can make a point and it's not about
[03:39:49.080 --> 03:39:52.600]  either winning or losing the contest it's about making these videos and putting
[03:39:52.600 --> 03:39:55.560]  them out on youtube and having other people
[03:39:55.560 --> 03:39:59.560]  click on them and start d programming because that's what we have to do

[03:42:35.560 --> 03:42:40.360]  our fbi chief has said we can't vet these people properly so
[03:42:40.360 --> 03:42:43.960]  it it's a it's a crazy situation that we're dealing with now and it's a
[03:42:43.960 --> 03:42:47.960]  situation that we help start why with all this regime change and going into
[03:42:47.960 --> 03:42:50.520]  different countries and bombing the heck out of them so
[03:42:50.520 --> 03:42:54.680]  we definitely are responsible for people wanting to leave their countries right
[03:42:54.680 --> 03:42:57.080]  now whether it's uh it's because of these wars or
[03:42:57.080 --> 03:43:00.760]  not they're definitely using the excuse of our bombing activities
[03:43:00.760 --> 03:43:05.880]  to jump ship and go into other places and ices is definitely taking advantage
[03:43:05.880 --> 03:43:09.720]  of that let's go to our uh i don't know if this will be our final caller but for
[03:43:09.720 --> 03:43:12.840]  a little bit this is douglas in california transition
[03:43:12.840 --> 03:43:17.240]  from sheeple to awake did you just recently go through that transition
[03:43:17.240 --> 03:43:21.480]  no it's it's been a four-year unbelievable awakening
[03:43:21.480 --> 03:43:27.320]  from cnn work your job do what you're told believe everything you're fed
[03:43:27.320 --> 03:43:31.240]  and get in line to who's alex stones what
[03:43:31.240 --> 03:43:35.080]  wait and then you have that that deep sense of
[03:43:35.080 --> 03:43:39.960]  oh no the sphere that that you can't control in other words you're going i've
[03:43:39.960 --> 03:43:44.760]  been lied to i've i've been what what this can't be real
[03:43:44.760 --> 03:43:48.040]  i'm telling everyone out there i didn't even know i ended up
[03:43:48.040 --> 03:43:51.800]  on this list that the government has called the office of foreign asset
[03:43:51.800 --> 03:43:55.000]  control by mistake because my name was
[03:43:55.000 --> 03:43:59.080]  douglas i have been fighting in court for four years
[03:43:59.080 --> 03:44:03.160]  to have my assets unlocked to actually work
[03:44:03.160 --> 03:44:07.240]  to be able to work legally in united states because my middle name was douglas
[03:44:07.240 --> 03:44:10.600]  and i'm i'm on the internet so i know who's ever listening
[03:44:10.600 --> 03:44:13.400]  who they can always do a search for people that are on this olfactory list
[03:44:13.400 --> 03:44:18.200]  you'll see my name there and just recently just recently the supreme
[03:44:18.200 --> 03:44:21.880]  court took up my court case only because i got on my hands and knees
[03:44:21.880 --> 03:44:26.520]  i started looking for god seeking god with all my heart with all my soul
[03:44:26.520 --> 03:44:29.560]  and that's what some it's going to take to get through these evil times
[03:44:29.560 --> 03:44:32.280]  where you don't fight it we don't fight against flesh and blood we fight against
[03:44:32.280 --> 03:44:35.800]  principalities and powers these people they may not even know what they're
[03:44:35.800 --> 03:44:40.120]  doing but it's putting god first in our life over other things
[03:44:40.120 --> 03:44:44.600]  that's how you know i'd like to kind of you know wake people up
[03:44:44.600 --> 03:44:48.200]  you've got to be awake because there's so many schemes going out on out there
[03:44:48.200 --> 03:44:50.600]  our government i don't know what it's all about
[03:44:50.600 --> 03:44:53.480]  but i know one thing that there is a living god
[03:44:53.480 --> 03:44:57.720]  jesus is christ you know and uh even in the surah i read the quran

[03:45:11.560 --> 03:45:15.560]  they had the book of truth and like men do
[03:45:15.560 --> 03:45:19.640]  they change things okay and that's what's happened
[03:45:19.640 --> 03:45:24.280]  we need to get back to the bible yeah they change things to suit themselves

[03:46:25.960 --> 03:46:29.640]  video now oh my god the right-wing nut job conspiracy
[03:46:29.640 --> 03:46:33.560]  theorist alex jones from info wars dot com is such a racist sexist
[03:46:33.560 --> 03:46:37.240]  homophobic bigoted republican you've probably seen his lunatic conspiracy
[03:46:37.240 --> 03:46:41.640]  theories exposed by various reputable media outlets such as salon raw story
[03:46:41.640 --> 03:46:45.800]  media matters or msnbc but his latest stunt has taken things way too far he
[03:46:45.800 --> 03:46:49.480]  just announced a contest to get his cult minion followers to create hateful
[03:46:49.480 --> 03:46:53.080]  intolerant youtube videos making fun of the next president of the united
[03:46:53.080 --> 03:46:56.520]  states hillary rodham clinton just because the hillary campaign threatened
[03:46:56.520 --> 03:46:58.920]  the laugh factory for making jokes about miss clinton
[03:46:58.920 --> 03:47:01.960]  doesn't give him the right to criticize her what makes him think he can invade
[03:47:01.960 --> 03:47:05.960]  her safe space with his disgusting hate speech anyway alex jones and info wars
[03:47:05.960 --> 03:47:09.400]  are totally irrelevant they're just a vocal minority if you google top
[03:47:09.400 --> 03:47:12.200]  political websites and click on the first link they're only the seventh
[03:47:12.200 --> 03:47:15.240]  biggest website on the list with 13 million unique visitors to their
[03:47:15.240 --> 03:47:17.320]  website per month but look at who is above them
[03:47:17.320 --> 03:47:21.480]  huff poe number one in salon number six hashtag winning what can info wars and
[03:47:21.480 --> 03:47:24.760]  their fringe followers possibly say about hillary anyway that she's too good
[03:47:24.760 --> 03:47:28.520]  of a role model too beautiful that her hair is too fabulous or that she's too
[03:47:28.520 --> 03:47:30.760]  inspirational she's never done anything wrong
[03:47:30.760 --> 03:47:34.680]  so i have a message for you mr alex jones men of the venomous hate you spew
[03:47:34.680 --> 03:47:37.800]  toward hillary will phase her at all she will just laugh it off with her
[03:47:37.800 --> 03:47:42.360]  contagious majestic laugh doesn't she sound like an angel
[03:47:42.360 --> 03:47:46.040]  i can't wait to see the hate and lies that these info warriors come up with
[03:47:46.040 --> 03:47:49.320]  they will probably try to say that she can't even keep her man satisfied
[03:47:49.320 --> 03:47:52.760]  because her husband bill clinton cheated on her all the time with tons of women
[03:47:52.760 --> 03:47:56.120]  she's stood by her man and viciously attacked and ridiculed all the women
[03:47:56.120 --> 03:47:59.480]  who came forward about bill's aggressive sexual abuse did you call her a
[03:47:59.480 --> 03:48:03.960]  narcissistic loony tomb i am not going to comment on what i did or did not say
[03:48:03.960 --> 03:48:07.720]  isn't she just a strong independent woman just look at her recent tweet about
[03:48:07.720 --> 03:48:10.920]  the sexual abuse of women she totally cares about the rape victims
[03:48:10.920 --> 03:48:14.440]  like when she defended a child rape as she knew was guilty in 1975 and laughed
[03:48:14.440 --> 03:48:18.440]  about it mrs clinton seems to admit she knew the defendant was guilty the whole
[03:48:18.440 --> 03:48:21.720]  monica lewinsky scandal was just a right-wing conspiracy theory hillary
[03:48:21.720 --> 03:48:26.040]  clinton totally debunked it this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been
[03:48:26.040 --> 03:48:29.640]  conspiring against my husband god i hate the stupid mouth-breathing knuckle
[03:48:29.640 --> 03:48:33.000]  dragging republicans they're always trying to say hillary and bill clinton's
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:36.280]  foundation took millions of dollars for private jets and that the foundation is
[03:48:36.280 --> 03:48:38.520]  full of monsanto and giant corporate connections
[03:48:38.520 --> 03:48:41.640]  foxnews says the clinton foundation only gave a small percentage of money to
[03:48:41.640 --> 03:48:44.440]  charity but we all know foxnews is nothing more than right-wing
[03:48:44.440 --> 03:48:47.640]  propaganda sponsored by the cock brothers critics claim that the speech as
[03:48:47.640 --> 03:48:50.280]  hillary gave to the big banks for millions of dollars were an advanced
[03:48:50.280 --> 03:48:54.040]  auction of stolen goods but hillary is so wise and experienced she deserves that
[03:48:54.040 --> 03:48:57.960]  much money for her speeches all right that is awesome there that's from no
[03:48:57.960 --> 03:49:02.680]  more news you can watch the rest of that i'm going to get the writers to post
[03:49:02.680 --> 03:49:07.560]  that one up along with a couple others we have another one of a young lady
[03:49:07.560 --> 03:49:12.360]  jenna marbles who actually embodies hillary clinton and and i'll play that
[03:49:12.360 --> 03:49:15.880]  one in a second here i think we got a little bit a little bit of time left
[03:49:15.880 --> 03:49:19.080]  what time we go out to break uh yeah

[03:54:23.800 --> 03:54:30.280]  we think that black friday has a racist connotation
[03:54:30.280 --> 03:54:34.280]  not really honestly yeah the thing about that i never really thought about it
[03:54:34.280 --> 03:54:37.640]  in that way with racist connotations um i can see
[03:54:37.640 --> 03:54:43.800]  how it could be um definitely offensive to people i i don't know where my
[03:54:43.800 --> 03:54:47.880]  opinion stands on it as far as that goes
[03:54:47.880 --> 03:54:53.160]  sorry i'm just kidding i'm not familiar with the historical uh connotations of
[03:54:53.160 --> 03:54:56.760]  black friday so i'm not sure if that question
[03:54:56.760 --> 03:54:59.960]  even applies or not like it could it could not but i just don't know
[03:54:59.960 --> 03:55:02.600]  i don't even know what the beginning of black what is like the beginnings of
[03:55:02.600 --> 03:55:06.760]  black friday what is like the origin of it well no one really knows but there
[03:55:06.760 --> 03:55:10.040]  are a lot of things that people are alleging and it's kind of like a black
[03:55:10.040 --> 03:55:13.880]  lives matter uh concern with this they that it had
[03:55:13.880 --> 03:55:16.600]  something to do with slavery and that they would sell their slaves at a
[03:55:16.600 --> 03:55:19.880]  discount in order to you know get the plantations
[03:55:19.880 --> 03:55:25.080]  filled with workers for the harsh winter i think i did hear that before
[03:55:25.080 --> 03:55:31.240]  but i mean now they do it for discount items every year this people kind of
[03:55:31.240 --> 03:55:35.960]  they get a little bit offended by it and so really i didn't even know the idea
[03:55:35.960 --> 03:55:39.160]  okay the problem is who is being offended like is it like
[03:55:39.160 --> 03:55:42.680]  the non-black community or is the black community because if black community is
[03:55:42.680 --> 03:55:45.880]  offended then i would be more for changing it than if like someone who
[03:55:45.880 --> 03:55:48.760]  wasn't black was offended you know because they're the only ones who get
[03:55:48.760 --> 03:55:50.920]  to decide whether or not something has offensive
[03:55:50.920 --> 03:55:53.880]  connotations to them because they're the community has lived through the
[03:55:53.880 --> 03:55:56.520]  historical implications do you think we should
[03:55:56.520 --> 03:55:59.720]  rename black friday
[03:56:00.280 --> 03:56:07.880]  no no why is that have you checked your privilege
[03:56:07.880 --> 03:56:11.320]  well actually i'm gonna reverse that statement now that i actually thought
[03:56:11.320 --> 03:56:13.880]  it through i could see where racism would come up
[03:56:13.880 --> 03:56:19.240]  there should definitely be a new name for it um i'm not sure but any ideas well
[03:56:19.240 --> 03:56:23.640]  something that would be more color neutral or i mean i wouldn't go color
[03:56:23.640 --> 03:56:27.080]  then since that's still like race implied i guess
[03:56:27.080 --> 03:56:30.440]  no if people agree with that opinion then yeah of course it's
[03:56:30.440 --> 03:56:34.440]  it's not right but what would they change it to the only ideas
[03:56:34.440 --> 03:56:39.320]  african-american friday okay that's a good potential you gotta have something
[03:56:39.320 --> 03:56:43.080]  that has a ring to it yeah that's the thing you can't think of anything
[03:56:43.080 --> 03:56:46.600]  that has a ring to it at least they didn't use the n word
[03:56:46.600 --> 03:57:16.440]  the annual walmart brawl how about that
[03:57:17.560 --> 03:57:22.360]  so now some massive crowds of zombies pouring into a walmart and a man crying
[03:57:22.360 --> 03:57:24.840]  he didn't get his uh didn't get his black friday gift
[03:57:24.840 --> 03:57:28.040]  everybody go it sounds like an awful way to spend a day
[03:57:28.040 --> 03:57:31.000]  getting beat up maybe they call it black friday because you have to be like a
[03:57:31.000 --> 03:57:36.040]  black belt in karate to you know that could be it discount day
[03:57:36.040 --> 03:57:40.840]  don't kill each other day please that's not for me to decide that's for the
[03:57:40.840 --> 03:57:43.640]  community to decide what is and isn't offensive to them and what's in a
[03:57:43.640 --> 03:57:50.120]  suitable replacement racist or not racist not racist
[03:57:50.120 --> 03:57:53.560]  i think people would have to speak up and if people were to say something
[03:57:53.560 --> 03:57:56.280]  if it was something that was heard by the population i think people would
[03:57:56.280 --> 03:57:58.840]  sympathize with it if it was something that they felt
[03:57:58.840 --> 03:58:02.600]  was racist so even if it's not necessarily
[03:58:02.600 --> 03:58:06.680]  true though i see a lot on college campuses right now a lot of things are
[03:58:06.680 --> 03:58:10.200]  happening because of the way people feel because they're offended because it's
[03:58:10.200 --> 03:58:13.640]  all right you can watch the rest of that at info wars dot com or check out the
