[00:00.000 --> 00:11.140]  Live from the Infowars.com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your
[00:11.140 --> 00:26.020]  host Paul Joseph Watson. We're live it is May 26 2017 is the Alex Jones show live I'm Paul Joseph
[00:26.020 --> 00:31.580]  Watson Alex will be coming in at the halfway stage of the broadcast so be sure to stay tuned in
[00:31.580 --> 00:36.300]  for that for the moment though we got a huge raft of news we also have a special guest coming up at
[00:36.300 --> 00:42.300]  the bottom of the hour he is Gad sad who's been on before he's an evolutionary behavioral scientist
[00:42.300 --> 00:47.980]  to talk about the Manchester attack to talk about Islam if it can be reformed to talk about a
[00:47.980 --> 00:54.660]  bill in Canada which will basically make it a crime to disrespect someone's gender pronoun we're
[00:54.660 --> 01:00.260]  going to talk about all that with Gad sad coming up at the bottom of the hour from the moment
[01:00.260 --> 01:03.900]  our ton of news obviously we're still talking about the Manchester attack we're talking about
[01:03.900 --> 01:14.460]  Greg Gianforte in Montana who won political office two days after body slamming a reporter how much
[01:14.460 --> 01:22.140]  does that illustrate how despised the media is by conservatives they didn't care this is absolutely
[01:22.140 --> 01:27.500]  hilarious now we don't advocate violence we've never advocated violence against anybody but you
[01:27.500 --> 01:34.980]  know why didn't Gianforte just call the guardian reporter whom he body slammed a nappy then the
[01:34.980 --> 01:38.820]  media would have applauded him for the assault right I mean that's what they've been doing for
[01:38.820 --> 01:44.220]  the past six months you had Trump supporters you had Richard Spencer again don't agree with his
[01:44.220 --> 01:50.700]  politics but he was assaulted and the media venerated it they legitimized it the left lost
[01:50.700 --> 01:56.780]  their right to complain about violence when they did nothing to decry the violence against Trump
[01:56.780 --> 02:03.340]  supporters for the past 18 months you remember we had little girls being pepper sprayed by anti
[02:03.340 --> 02:10.420]  Trump zealots during those rallies the media said absolutely nothing in opposition to that in fact
[02:10.420 --> 02:16.540]  they went further they blamed Donald Trump himself so that's the environment that the left and the
[02:16.540 --> 02:23.460]  media created so don't come at me don't come at me with your but her over Gianforte because he
[02:23.460 --> 02:29.740]  body slammed this guardian reporter again not advocating it but look at what happened ABC News
[02:29.740 --> 02:35.100]  reports Greg Gianforte wins Montana special election a day after being charged with assault
[02:35.100 --> 02:40.740]  just 24 hours after being charged with assault for allegedly again there's no video of it but
[02:40.740 --> 02:45.940]  this audio allegedly body slamming a reporter in his Bozeman campaign office Republican Greg
[02:45.940 --> 02:52.340]  Gianforte on Thursday defeated Democratic opponent Rob Quist to win the special election for the US
[02:52.340 --> 03:00.580]  House seat in Montana and how the the the the but her over it today is absolutely monumental on
[03:00.580 --> 03:07.540]  behalf of the left the saltiness is unparalleled but again doesn't this exemplify the fact that
[03:07.540 --> 03:15.300]  the left's ideas are so so unpopular that somebody can win political office two days after body
[03:15.300 --> 03:21.620]  slamming a journalist conservatives despise the media so much they hate the media so much
[03:21.620 --> 03:27.620]  they're perfectly willing to overlook that and vote for him anyway so after this happened the
[03:27.620 --> 03:31.620]  left they were pretty confident that they could overturn this election result it looked like
[03:31.620 --> 03:36.860]  Gianforte was going to win then this incident happened you had eyewitnesses come out saying
[03:36.860 --> 03:42.020]  that he grabbed the guardian reporter by the neck they then kind of changed their story around so
[03:42.020 --> 03:47.380]  nobody was really sure about what happened he admitted that he assaulted this guardian reporter
[03:47.380 --> 03:52.340]  Ben Jacobs you know he gave a press conference talking about it they expected that it would
[03:52.340 --> 03:58.500]  reverse the election result it didn't absolutely on many levels hilarious I mean let's be honest
[03:58.500 --> 04:03.780]  the left has lost its right to complain about about violence you've lost the moral high ground
[04:03.780 --> 04:09.140]  you don't have it so you don't have the the right to whine and bitch when it happens to you
[04:09.140 --> 04:14.340]  when it happens to people on the left again we distance ourselves from any kind of violence
[04:14.340 --> 04:19.860]  from the beginning but you don't have the right to whine about it we had this puncher Nazi narrative
[04:19.860 --> 04:28.020]  for the past six months the media venerating violent assaults on Trump supporters hate crimes
[04:28.020 --> 04:33.860]  committed by anti-trump people blamed on Trump supporters and yet the retraction was always
[04:33.860 --> 04:38.980]  either in the back of the newspaper or they just never talked about it again you know they'll report
[04:38.980 --> 04:44.580]  the big story about swastikas being painted on you know dormitory walls or whatever when it
[04:44.580 --> 04:49.460]  comes out that the people painting those swastikas are actually doing it to try and frame Trump
[04:49.460 --> 04:54.340]  supporters you never hear the retraction we'll be back with the Alex Jones show live breaking
[04:54.340 --> 05:03.540]  news at info wars dot com more tragedy in Chicago which is living up to its nickname
[05:03.540 --> 05:09.620]  shirac 14 shot in four hours one fatally a 16 year old boy shot in the head one of the boys was
[05:09.620 --> 05:14.180]  14 he was walking down the street when someone opened fire and hit him in the chest there were
[05:14.180 --> 05:19.380]  also at least six other shootings in Chicago in the same time span recall that president Trump said
[05:19.380 --> 05:24.100]  if Chicago can't fix this problem he will step in while i am not sure what the solution to this is
[05:24.100 --> 05:29.380]  perhaps legalization of certain drugs or not indoctrinating the youth into the gang culture
[05:29.380 --> 05:34.740]  returning industry and manufacturing to cities to produce jobs but what's certainly not working
[05:34.740 --> 05:40.900]  is democrat leadership and the anti-gun policies of the mayor of chicago rama manual while we see
[05:40.900 --> 05:46.980]  great cities like baltimore chicago parts of los angeles st louis detroit deteriorate into
[05:46.980 --> 05:51.940]  violence and dilapidation are we finally going to see great americans rise up to leadership roles
[05:51.940 --> 05:55.860]  to return these once great american cities to their glory let's hope with the next round of

[08:12.500 --> 08:23.620]  and now your host paul joseph watson
[08:26.580 --> 08:30.980]  we're live it's the alex jones shown of course world leaders world leaders are meeting in
[08:30.980 --> 08:37.380]  sicily today it's the g7 now what's interesting about that is of course the boats from libya
[08:37.380 --> 08:43.940]  arriving there in sicily in italy it's complete bedlam on the streets of sicily gang warfare
[08:43.940 --> 08:50.500]  between mafia groups and african migrant group groups it's absolutely insane the mayor there
[08:50.500 --> 08:55.220]  or one of the mares is happy about it he says that it's now like the middle east it's now like bayreau
[08:55.220 --> 09:00.420]  or istanbul and that's a good thing even though it's a european town but of course what happened
[09:00.420 --> 09:07.460]  during the g7 this is a headline migrant boats banned from sicily during g7 over security fears so
[09:07.460 --> 09:12.820]  they have these waves of boats arriving every day hundreds and hundreds of people 200 000 people a
[09:12.820 --> 09:20.020]  year arriving in italy half of them immediately disappear only 2.65 percent of them are actually
[09:20.020 --> 09:25.700]  given refugee asylum status the rest on but again they just disappear into the background
[09:25.700 --> 09:33.620]  and you have a huge security threat because isis in some cases is paying the fee for these migrants
[09:33.620 --> 09:39.300]  to then pay the people smugglers to get them onto these boats now it's not as if they're struggling
[09:39.300 --> 09:45.540]  across the sea across the Mediterranean to get to italy no they only have to get 12 miles off the
[09:45.540 --> 09:52.660]  coast of libya they then send out a distress call to these george soros funded NGO boats who come
[09:52.660 --> 09:57.620]  and pick them up it's like a taxi service and again people who have worked for some of these
[09:58.260 --> 10:03.700]  organizations even leftists who support this who give up their time to ensure it happens
[10:03.700 --> 10:08.100]  have admitted that when these people are coming in they just barge their way past women and
[10:08.100 --> 10:14.500]  children the few that are coming in and they demand immediate asylum some of them have beheading
[10:14.500 --> 10:21.220]  videos on their phones isis flags they're basically islamists or jihadists we've seen the reports
[10:21.220 --> 10:27.460]  they're getting paid by isis you pledge loyalty to us you be one of our fighters on the ground in
[10:27.460 --> 10:34.020]  europe will pay the 1500 euros that it cost them to pay the people smugglers to get into the boat
[10:34.020 --> 10:41.620]  in the first place absolutely huge insane security threat these NGOs should be prosecuted
[10:41.620 --> 10:46.260]  they are being prosecuted at least there's an investigation that could lead to that in italy
[10:46.260 --> 10:52.580]  oh but what happened for the couple of days when the g7 leaders are in town oh they banned the boats
[10:52.580 --> 10:59.540]  coming in so again the policy they created they don't want to be faced with the reality of it
[10:59.540 --> 11:02.980]  oh but they're going to inflict it on everyone else aren't they living down there in southern
[11:02.980 --> 11:08.740]  italy oh yeah but just while they're in town the political elite those boats aren't going to be
[11:08.740 --> 11:15.380]  coming in well what does that tell you about the entire crisis the article reads boats containing
[11:15.380 --> 11:21.060]  migrants picked up in the Mediterranean will be banned from docking in Sicily during the g7 meeting
[11:21.060 --> 11:28.500]  over fears for world leaders security oh yeah we care about their security don't care about european
[11:28.500 --> 11:33.940]  security do we because the very moment they friggin leave those boats are going to be coming
[11:33.940 --> 11:39.540]  straight back in the ban will begin on monday so it already began a few days ago as leaders
[11:39.540 --> 11:45.540]  including the pro open borders angela merkel will get together to discuss economic policy at san
[11:45.540 --> 11:52.580]  dominico palace hotel on the island the security crackdown was ordered by police chief franco gabrielli
[11:52.580 --> 11:57.380]  who said italian security services needed concrete plan to guarantee the security of the heads of state
[11:57.380 --> 12:02.260]  and government that will be on the island so those boats aren't going to be coming in just
[12:02.260 --> 12:08.820]  for the week that the g7 leaders are in town and that tells you everything doesn't it if it's such a
[12:08.820 --> 12:16.820]  big security threat why are the boats coming in at all 200 000 people a year some of them with ices
[12:17.380 --> 12:23.300]  sympathy some of them actually ices members ices has bragged in its own manifesto about how they're
[12:23.300 --> 12:30.180]  going to exploit the refugee crisis to infiltrate fighters into the west look what happened in
[12:30.180 --> 12:38.020]  manchester on monday night the guy's father the bomber's father was a libian refugee the uk gave him
[12:38.020 --> 12:46.500]  asylum he gave the uk a suicide bomber son oh gee thanks he was actually fighting the father and son
[12:46.500 --> 12:53.300]  were fighting for an al-qaeda group just a few years ago in libya they were fighting alongside
[12:53.300 --> 12:59.140]  al-qaeda and yet they're allowed to come back and forth in and out of the uk he's allowed to go to
[12:59.140 --> 13:04.740]  libya to syria for terror training absolutely no checks whatsoever despite the fact he was under
[13:04.740 --> 13:11.860]  surveillance and again lifg they were members of lifg this is a group who's fought alongside al-qaeda
[13:11.860 --> 13:18.900]  basically an al-qaeda offshoot they killed us troops in iraq and these are the kind of people
[13:18.900 --> 13:24.980]  we're allowing not just into the country we're giving them refugee status oh but when the g7
[13:24.980 --> 13:30.820]  are in town temporary ban on that because we care about their security don't care about the security
[13:30.820 --> 13:37.700]  of italyans or europeans doesn't that tell you everything now if you saw the video yesterday
[13:37.700 --> 13:43.620]  and we can play it now donald trump was met with some very strange reactions from the other world
[13:43.620 --> 13:50.020]  leaders and you can see here where he meets macron the ultimate sissy manler who married his grandmother
[13:50.020 --> 13:56.580]  macron goes towards trump you would expect him to shake trump's hand first doesn't oh look who he
[13:56.580 --> 14:04.180]  goes straight to angela merkel well imagine my shock then he continues to ignore trump and talks
[14:04.180 --> 14:12.420]  to these other nobodies oh look at trump's response basically yanks his hand away treats him like
[14:12.420 --> 14:19.300]  like the manlet that he is absolutely hilarious it was obviously a blank by macron he goes to
[14:19.300 --> 14:24.740]  merkel then he goes for these other two nobodies before he even acknowledges the president of
[14:24.740 --> 14:30.100]  the united states obviously deliberate and i think there was a later handshake between the two
[14:30.660 --> 14:36.980]  that was just as vigorous so trump's definitely trying to show him whose boss of course the left
[14:36.980 --> 14:42.580]  all wind about it and said oh my god this is so ridiculous this is so bullying of course trump
[14:42.580 --> 14:48.020]  supporters absolutely loved it as they do whenever he does this kind of thing there's another video of
[14:48.020 --> 14:53.460]  him pushing montanegro's prime minister out of the way if we can roll that at least that's how the
[14:53.460 --> 14:59.540]  media reported it didn't really push him out of the way just brushed him aside basically so that's
[14:59.540 --> 15:05.620]  that's what's going on at the g7 but again don't worry because justin trudeau is showing off his
[15:05.620 --> 15:11.060]  fancy socks to angela merkel a c trump pushing the prime minister of montanegro out of the way
[15:11.620 --> 15:16.740]  but if you go on my twitter page you can see an image of justin trudeau showing off his fancy
[15:16.740 --> 15:23.300]  globalist socks to angela merkel so they're all basically trying to impress her macron tried to
[15:23.300 --> 15:28.980]  impress her the queen of open board as the woman who's almost destroyed germany's culture at this
[15:28.980 --> 15:34.020]  point they're all trying to bow and roll over and have their bellies tickled by her even at the
[15:34.020 --> 15:39.220]  expense of ignoring the president of the united states that tells you absolutely everything
[15:39.220 --> 15:45.540]  about their attitude but trump's response was welcome he's certainly not going to be bowing down to
[15:45.540 --> 15:52.260]  the saudi princes or angela merkel anytime soon there's another photo on my twitter page if you
[15:52.260 --> 15:57.860]  want to pull it up it's him showing off his fancy globalist g7 socks to angela merkel
[15:57.860 --> 16:02.260]  that's what justin trudeau is doing so all the little man looks like trudeau and macron will
[16:02.260 --> 16:08.260]  be getting along just fine while trump shows him who's boss there's that image of trudeau
[16:08.820 --> 16:14.900]  talking to world leaders about his socks i'm sure that was a time well spent so that's what's
[16:14.900 --> 16:22.900]  going on at the g7 meanwhile back in merkelland woman shows injuries after being beaten by migrants
[16:22.900 --> 16:30.020]  this is the video that went viral on facebook a couple of days ago over 500 000 views and it explains
[16:30.020 --> 16:36.580]  how a woman is covered in bruises she shows off the bruises she thanks sardonically angela merkel
[16:36.580 --> 16:42.180]  for allowing this cultural enrichment to impact her in such a such a wonderful way basically what
[16:42.180 --> 16:47.620]  happened migrants called her a bitch she got up in their face presumably and said i'm not a bitch
[16:47.620 --> 16:53.700]  and then they proceeded to beat the holy hell out of her now the response to this on facebook
[16:53.700 --> 16:58.580]  and i went and checked this today if you translate the comments many of the comments in response to
[16:58.580 --> 17:04.980]  images of this woman being beaten huge welts on her face bruises everywhere the response was
[17:05.700 --> 17:11.700]  she's racist for complaining about it yeah that's right she's racist for complaining about being
[17:11.700 --> 17:17.860]  beaten up by migrants just take the beating and be tolerant okay just take the beating
[17:17.860 --> 17:23.940]  reminds me of the uh interview with a woman in paris a couple of months ago with tim pool and
[17:23.940 --> 17:30.660]  she basically said yeah i know these migrants run down the street and harass me and grab my breasts
[17:30.660 --> 17:36.020]  i know it's sexual assault but we have to be tolerant we have to be tolerant no you don't have
[17:36.020 --> 17:42.500]  to be tolerant of being groped and assaulted jesus christ but just go and read the comments in this
[17:42.500 --> 17:50.340]  facebook post calling her a racist for complaining about being beaten by these migrants simply because
[17:50.340 --> 17:57.700]  she refused to be called a bitch by them absolutely incredible now in this article you can also see
[17:57.700 --> 18:03.700]  if you scroll down a little bit of course we talked about wnd being banned by twitter yesterday
[18:03.700 --> 18:10.740]  for talking about the seth rich story twitter is now outright banning entire accounts in certain
[18:10.740 --> 18:15.860]  countries there you see it this account has been withheld in germany and france basically a twitter
[18:15.860 --> 18:20.900]  account where this individual this woman talks about what's going on in germany talks about the
[18:20.900 --> 18:27.540]  cultural enrichment sexual assaults the rapes the harassment that account is now banned in germany
[18:27.540 --> 18:32.420]  nobody can see it this is just off the back of another story which i'm going to get onto in a
[18:32.420 --> 18:39.940]  second where the eu is now talking about forcing quote hate speech videos off the internet now
[18:39.940 --> 18:45.860]  people say well who cares i don't use twitter just delete your twitter account no that's not a solution
[18:46.580 --> 18:52.260]  social media the better or worse is now basically the internet when it comes to news it is the
[18:52.260 --> 18:58.180]  internet we have been segregated into these social ghettos so you have to get out on the battleground

[28:05.860 --> 28:13.380]  completely buried i went on cnn sky news bbc this is buried at the bottom of their website like it's
[28:13.380 --> 28:20.660]  nothing children among dozens killed as mass gunman ambush convoy of egyptian coptic christians
[28:20.660 --> 28:26.180]  gunman opened fire on two buses and a truck carrying coptic christians in minna egypt on
[28:26.180 --> 28:33.380]  friday killing at least 26 including children some 26 people were also injured in the attack
[28:33.380 --> 28:39.700]  so more dead than those who tragically died in manchester they're not even talking about this
[28:39.700 --> 28:46.900]  this is buried on every mainstream media website christians are being persecuted and slaughtered
[28:46.900 --> 28:54.260]  around the world while our media continues to lecture us about islamophobia let that sink in
[28:54.980 --> 29:01.460]  26 christians slaughtered just the latest example they're talking about multiple eight to nine gunmen
[29:01.460 --> 29:05.940]  okay are they going to say this is another lone wolf attack maybe it's just someone with mental
[29:05.940 --> 29:12.340]  health issues no this is another targeted slaughter of christians because of their faith
[29:12.340 --> 29:19.220]  it's happening in egypt it's happening in syria it's happening in iraq where what is it hundreds of
[29:19.220 --> 29:24.340]  thousands of christians have left in the last 10 years it's basically a war on christianity
[29:24.340 --> 29:29.140]  they don't want to talk about it they want to keep the narrative to islamophobia and now it
[29:29.140 --> 29:36.180]  turns out the actual manchester bomber was motivated by grievances over islamophobia
[29:36.180 --> 29:41.300]  mirroring the exact same rhetoric as the left we're going to come back in the next segment
[29:41.300 --> 29:46.500]  talk about that and a whole lot more with gadstad on the alex jones show live don't go away
[29:48.900 --> 29:55.620]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.660 --> 30:05.300]  university of maryland president wallis low has announced his plans to launch anti-hate initiatives
[30:05.300 --> 30:09.540]  for campus an affirmative action plan and an attempt to do more to quell hate his plan includes
[30:09.540 --> 30:14.180]  establishing a hate bias and campus safety task force a rapid response team allocating hundreds
[30:14.180 --> 30:18.340]  of thousands of dollars to the office of diversity to help these efforts a new annual report on all
[30:18.340 --> 30:22.740]  campus hate bias incidents and appointing a council to prohibit hate bias symbols or actions in any
[30:22.740 --> 30:25.860]  venue then hopefully when you're finished with daycare you can be ready for the real world what
[30:25.860 --> 30:30.180]  do you want to do when you grow up johnny i want to be a campus diversity chief of the hate bias
[30:30.180 --> 30:34.820]  department now this is in response to a stabbing on campus where chris or bansky a 22 year old white
[30:34.820 --> 30:38.980]  man stabbed to death a 23 year old black student which is being looked at as a hate crime mainly
[30:38.980 --> 30:43.060]  because the facebook group the alt rike nation which are bansky had joined i'd like him to look
[30:43.060 --> 30:47.140]  into any pharmaceuticals the psycho was taking while this is a tragic event the aftermath is part of
[30:47.140 --> 30:51.780]  an ongoing trend on college campuses to redesign and reshape higher education into kindergarten
[30:51.780 --> 30:55.620]  telling everyone how to get along be careful what you do and say on social media as it may be held
[30:55.620 --> 31:02.740]  against you for info wars dot com this is oan shroyer the reason info wars life has five star

[33:32.020 --> 33:38.260]  once again by the always insightful gad sad he is professor of marketing evolutionary behavioral
[33:38.260 --> 33:44.340]  scientists and an author in his own right the youtube channel is youtube.com slash gad sad that's
[33:44.340 --> 33:50.980]  two a's in sad and twitter.com forward slash gad sad gad welcome back great to be with you paul thank
[33:50.980 --> 33:58.100]  you for having me now obviously this week has been huge in terms of terrorist attacks today 26
[33:58.100 --> 34:02.740]  christians slaughtered in egypt i was talking about it just before the break mainstream media is
[34:02.740 --> 34:06.580]  basically buried it they're not really interested in that we have christians being slaughtered
[34:06.580 --> 34:11.860]  across the middle east being persecuted driven out of course we had the manchester bombing
[34:11.860 --> 34:16.980]  and in the aftermath of that we heard the same narrative and it's this you know we must unite
[34:16.980 --> 34:22.340]  against hatred gad i think you know when they say we must unite against hatred and that's the only
[34:22.340 --> 34:27.700]  response they have and then a week later everybody forgets about it and we move on nothing happens
[34:27.700 --> 34:33.380]  more people die do you think when they say unite against hatred they're not talking about uniting
[34:33.380 --> 34:39.140]  against the hatred implicit within islamism they're talking about uniting against basically us
[34:39.140 --> 34:44.100]  conservatives or anyone who speaks out about islam i mean that's the that's the sense i get
[34:44.100 --> 34:49.940]  when they use that kind of rhetoric do you agree indeed i mean i think you covered it on your own
[34:49.940 --> 34:58.260]  channel the professor dr katie perry came out with a very brilliant strategy for we just need to
[34:58.260 --> 35:03.220]  unite we need to hug it out we need to band together no more borders no more walls and the
[35:03.220 --> 35:08.980]  problems will be resolved if only i knew that when my family were escaping persecution in lebanon
[35:08.980 --> 35:14.100]  we could have hugged it out and we could have remained and be roots do you think for a second
[35:14.100 --> 35:20.900]  they consider the fact that people who are willing to you know behead children burn people alive in
[35:20.900 --> 35:27.220]  cages that they're not really influenced by the word love and the word unite no matter no matter
[35:27.220 --> 35:31.780]  how many times you say it no matter how many candles you like no matter how many hashtags
[35:31.780 --> 35:37.700]  you tweet out no matter how many a facebook profile picture pictures you change the barbarians of
[35:37.700 --> 35:43.540]  isis i don't think that really affects them do you know i don't i call this by the way
[35:43.540 --> 35:50.660]  ostrich parasitic syndrome which is a type of mental virus that causes people to reject data
[35:50.660 --> 35:57.780]  to reject evidence to reject logic reason and then simply utter out endless useless suicidal
[35:57.780 --> 36:06.180]  platitudes it's it's grotesque and frankly i respect the extremist islamist more than i do
[36:06.180 --> 36:13.700]  the westerners that grant them coverage i still struggle to grasp it do you think somewhere in
[36:13.700 --> 36:19.460]  the back of their minds these people who after every single terror attack say let's let's worry
[36:19.460 --> 36:24.820]  about islamophobia right that should be the main concern is people saying mean things to muslims on
[36:24.820 --> 36:31.220]  public transport that should be the main concern after an islamist has just slaughtered 22 23 people
[36:31.220 --> 36:35.300]  mainly young girls do you think the kind of people who say that no when they're back in the back of
[36:35.300 --> 36:41.540]  their mind they must know surely or is the stock home syndrome so deep do they surely not know
[36:41.540 --> 36:47.460]  that capitulating showing weakness to a bully only encourages a bully surely they must know
[36:47.460 --> 36:52.980]  that at some level i think there's both types there are some who in the deep recesses of the
[36:52.980 --> 36:58.500]  privacy of their minds know that they are just saying empty platitudes that they don't believe
[36:58.500 --> 37:03.060]  themselves but i think there are other folks who've been so parasitized by these progressive
[37:03.060 --> 37:09.060]  platitudes that they genuinely believe that ultimately if these things are happening we
[37:09.060 --> 37:14.100]  probably did something to deserve this and so they self-flagellate you know in their white
[37:14.100 --> 37:19.140]  western guilt and they truly believe that they are to blame it's a cancer and we need to eradicate it
[37:20.820 --> 37:25.380]  and again when we talk about political correctness people just think i mean that you've heard it
[37:25.380 --> 37:30.100]  before oh that's just being mean to people you know being politically correct is just being
[37:30.100 --> 37:36.340]  nice to people well when you have gad you know 1400 girls trafficked in rather infasexual abuse
[37:36.340 --> 37:41.700]  by pakistani rape gangs and the local council the local government does nothing about it
[37:41.700 --> 37:47.220]  specifically because of political correctness because they don't want to be called racist
[37:47.220 --> 37:53.620]  then that's when political correctness becomes harmful and we saw it again prior to this manchester
[37:53.620 --> 37:59.620]  bombing gad the guy was hanging an ices flag from his house and his neighbors just thought that was
[37:59.620 --> 38:06.100]  perfectly normal he was out in the street loudly chanting islamic prayer he'd been radicalized
[38:06.100 --> 38:13.300]  his dad was a terrorist and he was given refugee status in the country but again the neighbors saw
[38:13.300 --> 38:17.700]  these signs we saw it the same situation in san Bernardino you know they were moving into the
[38:17.700 --> 38:22.500]  apartment receiving suspicious packages neighbors said it was suspicious but they said we didn't
[38:22.500 --> 38:28.980]  want to report it because we might be seen as bigoted or racist and we saw that again prior
[38:28.980 --> 38:34.260]  to the manchester bombing so gad i mean political correctness is no longer just about being nice
[38:34.260 --> 38:40.420]  to people it's actually it actually represents a harmful threat in these kind of situations right
[38:41.060 --> 38:48.660]  i've actually analogized political correctness to the spiders wasps so the spider wasp stings a
[38:48.660 --> 38:56.260]  much larger spider rendering it's zombified it then drags it into its burrow lays eggs on it
[38:56.260 --> 39:02.500]  and then the offspring feed on it in vivo right and that's exactly what political correctness
[39:02.500 --> 39:09.940]  is it's the spider wasps sting that zombifies our ability to think rationally and critically
[39:09.940 --> 39:18.340]  and we are slowly led to the abyss of infinite darkness quietly and without any fight in us
[39:18.340 --> 39:24.980]  it's it's it's horrifying by the way i just to speak about the point regarding you know the the
[39:24.980 --> 39:32.660]  endless obfuscation that westerners come up with i've actually listed the number of excuses that
[39:32.660 --> 39:38.260]  people have offered as quote root causes and frankly if you read that list you would think
[39:38.260 --> 39:45.380]  it's satire that i'm coming up with beard bullying caused this toxic masculinity caused this lack of
[39:45.380 --> 39:53.780]  art exposure they weren't exposed to enough high art uh solar panels uh you know carbon emissions
[39:53.780 --> 40:00.020]  i mean it's just endless right and when you look at this you say is it possible that a functioning
[40:00.020 --> 40:06.420]  human being can actually utter such stupidity in all seriousness and i guess i regret to say that
[40:06.420 --> 40:12.180]  the answer is yes no they will come up with any excuse i mean we've always made the point you
[40:12.180 --> 40:16.420]  know don't interfere don't overthrow secular governments in Syria and libya and that's the
[40:16.420 --> 40:21.700]  only point which has some validity when they talk about socioeconomic status of terrorists
[40:21.700 --> 40:27.140]  if you actually look at many of them across the world many of them are doctors their phd's
[40:27.140 --> 40:32.740]  these people aren't vagrants they're not bombs in many cases they're well educated and quite
[40:32.740 --> 40:38.100]  wealthy for the for the countries in which they live so again that that's been completely dismantled
[40:38.100 --> 40:44.420]  the other aspect gad is i think that they use this whole islamophobia thing as a kind of human
[40:44.420 --> 40:50.340]  shield because of course the leftist argument on open borders and mass immigration is completely
[40:50.340 --> 40:55.380]  bankrupt they can't defend it anymore at this point it's clearly wrong it's clearly harmful
[40:55.380 --> 41:01.940]  so they use the the muslims the brown people whoever as kind of huge rhetorical human shields for
[41:01.940 --> 41:07.300]  their argument so then when you attack uh open border immigration policies they can just claim
[41:07.300 --> 41:12.500]  you're attacking muslims so of course that means they don't have to defend their argument if they're
[41:12.500 --> 41:18.180]  holding up the the poor oppressed muslim as the human shields so it's kind of a way of deflecting
[41:18.180 --> 41:23.460]  the fact that they have no argument yeah i hear you i've actually compared it to i don't know if
[41:23.460 --> 41:30.260]  you know the the myth of the noble savage uh the john jack who show our argument where you know the
[41:30.260 --> 41:36.900]  argument is that in the natural state uh people are noble and then came along the western man
[41:36.900 --> 41:42.820]  the white man that caused all this right around the world well in a sense what the current westerners
[41:42.820 --> 41:49.300]  are doing it are doing is reviving the smith of the noble savage right the brown people the brown
[41:49.300 --> 41:55.780]  muslim people the others are noble are kind are peaceful it is ultimately us who are to blame
[41:56.420 --> 42:01.140]  again it's grotesque it's a mind virus and we have to win this battle of ideas otherwise
[42:01.140 --> 42:07.940]  we will lose uh when we take a long-term view we will lose no i was thinking earlier about a
[42:07.940 --> 42:12.900]  term to describe this this attitude which you just described it is the noble savage it's like they
[42:12.900 --> 42:20.740]  had some justification to massacre to maim hundreds of people in manchester when in reality this bomber
[42:20.740 --> 42:26.260]  was just a thug and a loser he was a gang member the guy who he grew up with who was his best friend
[42:26.260 --> 42:31.540]  was a gang rapist so this idea that they're somehow noble in this greater cause for a la
[42:31.540 --> 42:36.820]  complete bs a lot of them are complete losers and thugs it's like i agree with trump when he calls
[42:36.820 --> 42:42.260]  them losers because that then takes away the left's opportunity to make the argument that it's all
[42:42.260 --> 42:46.820]  about western foreign policy or that they have some kind of legitimate grievance no they're
[42:46.820 --> 42:52.580]  losers but to that i mean there's a headline out of the independent today martin hett's parents
[42:52.580 --> 42:59.940]  say they only feel sorry for manchester suicide bomber so you've got parents of children who died
[42:59.940 --> 43:04.740]  in that attack saying that they feel sorry they don't feel anger they don't want anything done
[43:04.740 --> 43:11.380]  about it presumably they feel sorry for the guy who killed their child i mean what level of stock
[43:11.380 --> 43:16.500]  com syndrome do you have to be under to come out with statements like that well this reminds me
[43:16.500 --> 43:20.980]  although i think your example is even more grotesque because it deals with children who have died
[43:20.980 --> 43:25.620]  it reminds me of the case of the norwegian i think journalists who had been sodomized
[43:25.620 --> 43:32.820]  by i think a somali migrant and then when the somali migrant was going to be in prison and then
[43:32.820 --> 43:40.820]  deported to somalia the guy felt guilty right so the guy who had been raped and sodomized
[43:40.820 --> 43:47.860]  could not muster enough anger against his rapist instead he felt bad that this poor guy was going
[43:47.860 --> 43:53.860]  to be mistreated in somalia it's unbelievable you can't make that stuff up now there was another
[43:53.860 --> 43:59.300]  story things out of germany where a woman got raped by a migrant in a train carriage on an
[43:59.300 --> 44:04.500]  overnight train and she said she didn't report it to police because she thought that might be racist
[44:04.500 --> 44:09.620]  you know they've had a hard time in iraq or syria or wherever so you have to be tolerant you have to
[44:09.620 --> 44:14.660]  be understanding and we see the same thing with verbal and sexual assault on the streets many
[44:14.660 --> 44:22.020]  women think that tolerance is accepting being sexually molested by these migrants absolutely
[44:22.020 --> 44:27.220]  insane want to move on though god you talked about um you tweeted about the hijab uh quite a few
[44:27.220 --> 44:32.260]  times i was on your twitter account earlier hustler magazine is now glamorizing the hijab
[44:32.260 --> 44:38.260]  you know we have actual feminists in iran and other countries being thrown in prison for removing
[44:38.260 --> 44:44.500]  their hijabs the early arab muslim feminist group the earliest arab muslim feminist group the egyptian
[44:44.500 --> 44:51.060]  feminist union this is a hundred years ago they removed their veils in protest so the very first
[44:51.060 --> 44:57.540]  actual arab muslim feminist groups decried the veil how in the hell did they turn the hijab i'm
[44:57.540 --> 45:02.900]  talking about leftists and cultural institutions in general how in the hell did they turn the hijab
[45:02.900 --> 45:11.060]  into a symbol of women's rights so i think it comes from the western feminist idea that the male
[45:11.060 --> 45:17.700]  gaze is a form of visual rape right so if you stare at a woman and you sexually objectify her
[45:17.700 --> 45:24.180]  you sexually desire her you are effectively effectively visually raping her and so any
[45:24.180 --> 45:30.260]  accoutrement any sartorial decision that you take that reduces the male gaze ultimately is a good
[45:30.260 --> 45:36.020]  thing so the burqa which by definition can't have any male gaze i can't see anything other than a
[45:36.020 --> 45:42.580]  black tent is liberating whereas the bikini is patriarchal oppression again it's part of the
[45:42.580 --> 45:48.980]  same confluence of mind viruses that have completely parasitized the western mind it's unbelievable
[45:50.260 --> 45:55.940]  but again you know logically it's the ultimate capitulation to a patriarchal system a damaging
[45:55.940 --> 46:01.220]  harmful one which is islam which is being imported into the west and it's the whole point isn't it
[46:01.220 --> 46:06.340]  about you know for years we had feminists and people on the left whining about rape culture
[46:06.340 --> 46:12.100]  based on completely fraudulent statistics about one in five women being raped on college campuses
[46:12.100 --> 46:17.460]  that argument was eviscerated then along came hundreds of thousands of migrants who imported
[46:17.460 --> 46:23.860]  an actual rape culture into europe and they're absolutely silent on it in fact god i think
[46:23.860 --> 46:28.580]  i think it was after the cologne incident you know the mass molestation the feminist the local
[46:28.580 --> 46:35.380]  feminist went out to the migrant camp and gave out roses to the migrants after some of them had
[46:35.380 --> 46:40.820]  been involved in this mass molestation which again you know it's it's the ostrich effect you talked
[46:40.820 --> 46:48.100]  about they would rather be raped or even die than be called a racist i mean people just
[46:48.100 --> 46:53.460]  can't grasp that kind of mindset but that's what's happening right yeah i think in sweden that wasn't
[46:53.460 --> 47:00.180]  of the swedish and swedish police who came up with this einstein uh decision of having a bracelet
[47:00.180 --> 47:06.660]  on women that says no this is my body you can't touch me and they were very surprised when apparently
[47:06.660 --> 47:13.700]  the migrant men were not moved by this powerful feminist symbol and they still attacked the women
[47:13.700 --> 47:20.820]  surprising isn't it well in finland they had a we played the video they had a woman using the force
[47:20.820 --> 47:26.340]  and it was she was holding her arms out to her to a potential rapist and you know just encourage
[47:26.340 --> 47:31.780]  encouraging him not to rape her by using some kind of invisible force field yeah i don't i don't
[47:31.780 --> 47:36.500]  think that had worked that great in the in the migrant suburbs of rinkaby or stockoma or anywhere
[47:36.500 --> 47:42.180]  like that but you did post something which was um fairly positive i think on on your facebook page
[47:42.180 --> 47:49.220]  where you talked about how the quote battle of ideas will be won can we rely on muslims within
[47:49.220 --> 47:55.380]  the muslim community to reform islam given that those who have tried who have become x muslims
[47:55.380 --> 48:00.100]  you know and met with death threats censorship and violence where is this reform gonna come from
[48:00.100 --> 48:08.100]  i know i've i've spoken quite openly about my pessimism regarding any reform initiative i think
[48:08.100 --> 48:12.500]  ultimately what's going to have to happen is that the west is going to have to realize that there
[48:12.500 --> 48:17.460]  are inherent elements of islam not all of it there are some spiritual parts that are perfectly
[48:18.500 --> 48:23.780]  livable if i can put it that way but there are other parts that are simply there is no way to
[48:23.780 --> 48:29.220]  slice them and dice them in any way and reinterpret them or reanalyze them so that they become
[48:29.220 --> 48:37.220]  palatable to our western values and in that case those particular passages i suspect down the line
[48:37.220 --> 48:44.660]  some legal scholars will deem them to be seditious to our western values and somehow find a way to
[48:44.660 --> 48:49.860]  consider them incitement to hate and abandon i really don't see look we're going to solve this
[48:49.860 --> 48:55.860]  problem either peacefully or violently i still hold out hope that we will do so peacefully but
[48:55.860 --> 49:01.060]  there is no way to do so peacefully while rearranging the deaths on the titanic while the titanic
[49:01.060 --> 49:06.820]  is sinking while reform is ultimately a losing battle we have to recognize that there are elements
[49:06.820 --> 49:11.300]  on islam that cannot be reformed and then the next step is to decide what to do with that what can
[49:11.300 --> 49:18.180]  we do about that and of course one thing is to admit that there isn't a karan version 2.0 the
[49:18.180 --> 49:23.540]  radicals as they call them are reading the exact same damn book as everybody else as the moderate
[49:23.540 --> 49:28.260]  muslims as the nominal muslims but we have this idea that they're somehow inspired by something
[49:28.260 --> 49:32.980]  completely different gad when they're reading the exact same book and people say oh islam the
[49:32.980 --> 49:38.180]  karan is about peace i mean if you kill if you kill one person you kill the world well yeah but
[49:38.180 --> 49:44.100]  then somewhere else it says kill all the infidels that's the same book being read by isis there's
[49:44.100 --> 49:51.540]  not a version 2.0 and not only that the the early the passage that says all the peace stuff has
[49:51.540 --> 49:56.500]  from a doctrinal perspective has actually been abrogated has been nullified so if there's a
[49:56.500 --> 50:02.500]  passage that says be peaceful and then another one that says don't be peaceful if the later one
[50:02.500 --> 50:07.700]  comes then it supersedes the earlier one so it's not as though there's a contradiction
[50:07.700 --> 50:13.940]  from a doctrinal perspective all of that peaceful mech and stuff has been abrogated and so you're
[50:13.940 --> 50:20.740]  exactly right there is no set of codes that we could go to called radical islam or islamism or
[50:20.740 --> 50:27.780]  jihadism or militant extremism it's all contained in the same set of sources it's the koran it's
[50:27.780 --> 50:33.860]  the hadith and it's the syrah the biography of muhammad that's it and it's the same thing with
[50:33.860 --> 50:40.420]  ramadan the later teaching overall the previous teaching so the original teaching said that islam
[50:40.420 --> 50:45.620]  muslims had to be peaceful during ramadan they couldn't attack anybody it was later superseded
[50:45.620 --> 50:51.380]  by a teaching which said the exact opposite that that is the perfect time to be deceptive
[50:51.380 --> 50:56.340]  and to launch attacks and lo and behold today we have isis ordering people to launch more attacks
[50:56.340 --> 51:01.300]  during ramadan we'll be back with gads out on the alexiom show live stages anglers campers and

[55:32.740 --> 55:39.540]  bill c16 which i think we'll dip into that after the next break g7 happening in sicily they've got
[55:39.540 --> 55:46.340]  the boats coming in from libya i talked about this earlier where the ngo ships go to 12 miles off the
[55:46.340 --> 55:52.180]  coast of libya basically it's a taxi service they bring these migrants who most of them aren't from
[55:52.180 --> 55:57.460]  libya they're definitely not from syria there's no black people in syria they're not they don't
[55:57.460 --> 56:02.260]  you don't get black syrians but of course nobody asked that question it's still framed as the syrian
[56:02.260 --> 56:08.900]  refugee crisis you've got 200 000 africans arriving in italy every single year half of them just go
[56:08.900 --> 56:16.740]  missing but gad they've suspended the g7 the migrant boats arriving in sicily for the duration of the
[56:16.740 --> 56:21.860]  g7 conference what i mean what does it say about the political class that they don't want to be
[56:21.860 --> 56:27.620]  faced with the reality of their own policies while they inflict them on everyone else apparently they
[56:27.620 --> 56:33.380]  can't handle the cultural enrichment that might turn their way and others should be culturally
[56:33.380 --> 56:38.980]  enriched they're already sufficiently hardy and culturally enriched i i can't think of any other
[56:38.980 --> 56:45.620]  reason other than that right i mean it's absolutely incredible that they this i mean merkel they're
[56:45.620 --> 56:51.140]  all bowing down to her did you see a macron where and we played the video earlier we can roll it again
[56:51.140 --> 56:56.900]  macron walks up to trump obviously you know it's trump's first appearance at one of these kind of
[56:56.900 --> 57:01.940]  international conferences he's at the front of the queue he's the new president of the united
[57:01.940 --> 57:09.060]  states leader of the free world macron completely blanks him goes to angela merkel blanks him again
[57:09.060 --> 57:14.420]  shakes hands with these other two basically nobody's in comparison to trump and only at the end does he
[57:14.420 --> 57:19.540]  actually acknowledge donald trump do you think oh i mean have you seen the video no i just watched
[57:19.540 --> 57:26.580]  it now while you're playing it uh look uh posturing as part of the non-verbal communications that many
[57:26.580 --> 57:31.460]  animals engage in including humans so i think you're probably right that there was a bit of
[57:31.460 --> 57:37.620]  signaling that was going on there uh but that's to be expected given uh the reality of the european
[57:37.620 --> 57:43.700]  progressive mind right well exactly i mean we had the election of macron just a few weeks ago and
[57:43.700 --> 57:48.420]  he's already proving to be the the little manlet that everybody thought he was now we're coming
[57:48.420 --> 57:53.700]  up on a break again gad we're going to get into this bill c16 this is a bill and by the way we've
[57:53.700 --> 57:58.740]  got a video coming up which will play after we've finished here with gad where they send a basically
[57:58.740 --> 58:05.940]  a 300 pound drag queen who looks like a clown into a school and this individual is teaching
[58:05.940 --> 58:12.260]  four-year-olds about quote gender fluidity you will not believe this video that we're going to play
[58:12.260 --> 58:17.060]  in the next hour absolutely incredible but after the break we're going to get into this with gad
[58:17.060 --> 58:22.500]  sad because then is now a bill pending in canada which and we're going to drill into the details
[58:22.500 --> 58:29.220]  may make it a crime to disrespect somebody's gender pronoun absolutely incredible going to

[1:02:11.300 --> 1:02:18.980]  kids about touching his hips drag queen story hour is fantastic because uh it addresses all of these
[1:02:18.980 --> 1:02:28.580]  issues of gender fluidity and self acceptance really you're getting self acceptance lessons from a
[1:02:28.580 --> 1:02:35.620]  guy who dresses up like a woman are you freaking kidding me that guy can't even accept the fact
[1:02:35.620 --> 1:02:40.020]  that he might have a few bolts loose in his head why doesn't he go get a shrink why doesn't he go
[1:02:40.020 --> 1:02:47.300]  seek medical attention instead this guy can't accept who he is so he dresses up like something else
[1:02:47.300 --> 1:02:55.060]  to mask the deeper problem that's hidden below that he is just a freaking lunatic
[1:02:55.700 --> 1:03:02.820]  and then also gender fluidity negative there's only two genders do you get it everyone thinks
[1:03:02.820 --> 1:03:07.620]  that this girl is a boy because she's a little bit of a tomboy it's a man baby those are people
[1:03:07.620 --> 1:03:14.580]  who think that gay people are sinful or evil or you know bad to begin with um so you know we're
[1:03:14.580 --> 1:03:18.500]  sort of just starting from such different places that it's kind of irrelevant whoa so now we have
[1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:25.140]  a drag queen giving advice about sexuality at a school with very young impressionable minds all
[1:03:25.140 --> 1:03:32.340]  around them sir man whatever you are are you a doctor so no you're not you're a dude who dresses up
[1:03:32.340 --> 1:03:39.220]  like a clown and you go and tell people stories for some reason about sexuality and for some reason
[1:03:39.220 --> 1:03:44.340]  these parents are stupid enough to let you come in and doctor name brainwash these kids
[1:03:44.340 --> 1:03:49.780]  you have no medical background you have no medical history and you have no idea of the side effects
[1:03:49.780 --> 1:03:55.780]  of things like that you don't need to teach those kids those types of things it is proven
[1:03:55.780 --> 1:04:04.980]  with science that some of the most worst things you can do is to have gay sex why std's aides all
[1:04:04.980 --> 1:04:09.620]  kinds of crap now if you're an adult and you're a consenting adult and you decide you want to go
[1:04:09.620 --> 1:04:16.020]  that route then by all means whatever but don't put that in our little children's heads i don't
[1:04:16.020 --> 1:04:21.940]  find this okay i think this is sick and disturbing that this kind of thing would be allowed into a
[1:04:21.940 --> 1:04:29.380]  school like this great so much energy did you like it yeah you know that's what i'm looking for
[1:04:30.020 --> 1:04:36.180]  in all of our outings is to present different ways of being in the world and make that fun

[1:08:16.420 --> 1:08:24.260]  are you like me now are you like me now we're live on the alex joneshow talking to professor
[1:08:24.260 --> 1:08:30.900]  gad sad that is gad s aad you can find him on youtube under that name and twitter also
[1:08:31.540 --> 1:08:36.580]  gad you heard the clip you saw the clip before the break i mean when i was in school i didn't
[1:08:36.580 --> 1:08:43.540]  even have sexual thoughts or think about anything like that until the age of you know 9 10 11
[1:08:43.540 --> 1:08:51.220]  they're teaching four-year-old kids via this fat clownish drag queen about gender fluidity
[1:08:51.220 --> 1:08:58.420]  in what crazy world is that a good idea well i think it comes from the wrong view of the human
[1:08:58.420 --> 1:09:04.020]  mind as a empty slate right it's called the tabula rasa premise which basically says we're born
[1:09:04.020 --> 1:09:09.540]  with no biological blueprints no biological imperatives and its socialization that then
[1:09:09.540 --> 1:09:15.140]  causes us to take the particular trajectories that we do in life and so if you subscribe to
[1:09:15.140 --> 1:09:20.180]  that particular view of the human mind then hey i gotta get i gotta get the brainwashing started
[1:09:20.180 --> 1:09:25.860]  early uh because the mind is empty there are no biological imperatives and so let me start
[1:09:26.660 --> 1:09:32.180]  inculcating all this uh political ideologies all this activism into these young gullible children
[1:09:32.180 --> 1:09:39.140]  it's grotesque it's the same argument they use for feminists some of them want to have sports
[1:09:39.140 --> 1:09:44.820]  mixed gender because they claim that for example women aren't as good at at soccer as men because
[1:09:44.820 --> 1:09:52.100]  they didn't grow up playing soccer and it wasn't socialized into them no bone mass uh stamina
[1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:56.900]  muscle mass all different there are two genders there are biological differences that's why men
[1:09:56.900 --> 1:10:03.140]  in general are better at sports it's biological i want to ask you about bill c 16 though because
[1:10:03.140 --> 1:10:08.820]  uh you recently testified in front of the senate in canada about this it would quote add gender
[1:10:08.820 --> 1:10:14.820]  expression or identity as a protected ground to the canadian human rights act and also to the
[1:10:14.820 --> 1:10:21.060]  criminal code provisions dealing with hate propaganda incitement to genocide and aggravating
[1:10:21.060 --> 1:10:25.940]  factors in sentencing gad what exactly is the scope of this are we talking about people possibly
[1:10:25.940 --> 1:10:33.140]  being arrested or fined for not using the right pronoun so i tried to exactly contextualize the
[1:10:33.140 --> 1:10:39.060]  difficulties with this bill in terms of how vaguely worded it is by looking at what i do in my
[1:10:39.060 --> 1:10:44.900]  life which is i'm a professor who teaches about evolutionary psychology about innate sex differences
[1:10:44.900 --> 1:10:52.340]  and how these manifest themselves in all sorts of ways now harvard university's uh lgbtq office came
[1:10:52.340 --> 1:10:59.620]  out with a pamphlet that basically said and i'm quoting that it is transphobic systemic violence
[1:10:59.620 --> 1:11:06.020]  right they weren't this wasn't a metaphor it is system it's a systemic violence to promulgate
[1:11:06.020 --> 1:11:12.740]  the notion of fixed binaries and biological essentialism fixed binaries is male female
[1:11:12.740 --> 1:11:18.340]  biological essentialism is to resort to some biological argument to explain some something
[1:11:18.340 --> 1:11:25.060]  that deals with human affairs so by that definition anything that i teach in my courses would be
[1:11:25.060 --> 1:11:31.460]  transphobic systemic violence right so for example if i explain how the process of sexual selection
[1:11:32.020 --> 1:11:37.780]  results in uh you know evolve differences between the two sexes well someone could come along and
[1:11:37.780 --> 1:11:42.500]  say but i am a non-gendered person i'm a non-binary person you didn't include me in your class
[1:11:42.500 --> 1:11:47.540]  material and therefore you're being prejudicial you're being biased when i try to raise all these
[1:11:47.540 --> 1:11:52.660]  all these concerns with the senators they scoffed and laughed and so on and then one person actually
[1:11:52.660 --> 1:11:59.860]  accused me of being pro genocide for simply offering possible you know warning signals
[1:11:59.860 --> 1:12:06.180]  regarding how badly phrased the bill was it was simply astonishing that in the 21st century
[1:12:06.180 --> 1:12:11.140]  a scientist had to go in front of the canadian senate to argue that there is such a thing as
[1:12:11.140 --> 1:12:16.900]  male and female when it comes to a sexually reproducing species it's unbelievable and we
[1:12:16.900 --> 1:12:23.220]  saw the bill nye for the past a couple of weeks ago where they actually censored part of his original
[1:12:23.220 --> 1:12:29.540]  1996 show which was basically someone just talking about chromosomes and how there are two biological
[1:12:29.540 --> 1:12:34.900]  genders they actually censored that from the netflix version now he's on netflix talking about how
[1:12:34.900 --> 1:12:41.380]  it's all fluid calls himself the science guy absolutely absurd and also you talked about
[1:12:41.380 --> 1:12:47.780]  this new redefinition you having a different opinion to them is now not just oh you're a
[1:12:47.780 --> 1:12:54.340]  Nazi you're you you're hateful it's actual violence you know god i mean do words just
[1:12:54.340 --> 1:13:00.740]  sprout fists and start punching people in the face now how do words and opinions translate into violence
[1:13:01.700 --> 1:13:05.460]  i think it's part of what i call collective munchhausen right munchhausen is when you
[1:13:05.460 --> 1:13:12.180]  feign an illness or an injury so that you can garner sympathy and empathy empathy well this whole
[1:13:12.180 --> 1:13:19.220]  victimology ethos that is that the root of all of this social justice warrior activism is ultimately
[1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:26.580]  rooted in this collective munchhausen where where i you know i i use the following example in my
[1:13:26.580 --> 1:13:33.060]  opening remarks at the canadian senate right vene de cap said i think therefore i am the new motto is
[1:13:33.060 --> 1:13:41.460]  i'm a victim therefore i am right i don't exist unless i could you know provide a victimology
[1:13:41.460 --> 1:13:47.780]  narrative that defines me and that's the problem right is that these guys operate within a currency
[1:13:47.780 --> 1:13:54.900]  of victimhood and that has to stop and some are more victimized than others some are more
[1:13:54.900 --> 1:13:59.300]  equal than others if you're a white straight male you're at the bottom of that lead table
[1:13:59.300 --> 1:14:04.260]  of course it's the oppression olympics gad we're coming towards the end of this just tell people

[1:14:38.500 --> 1:14:44.180]  insightful chat as per usual let's dip back into the news right now though because russia
[1:14:44.820 --> 1:14:49.860]  is warning its citizens against traveling to britain due to another terrorist atrocity being
[1:14:49.860 --> 1:14:55.700]  inevitable maybe the russians were behind the attack as louise mensch suggested that yet probably
[1:14:55.700 --> 1:15:00.340]  happened russia has warned its citizens against visiting britain due to the threat of inevitable
[1:15:00.340 --> 1:15:04.740]  new terrorist attacks bladimir putin's government issued the travel advice after the uk raised its
[1:15:04.740 --> 1:15:09.140]  threat level to critical the maximum possible following the manchester bombing of course the
[1:15:09.140 --> 1:15:15.140]  reaction to the manchester bombing has been to put more men with guns on the street like that is
[1:15:15.140 --> 1:15:20.980]  going to do anything whatsoever to address the root of the violent ideology that caused this attack
[1:15:20.980 --> 1:15:26.820]  and all the others like it okay turning britain into a police state isn't going to stop terrorism
[1:15:27.540 --> 1:15:32.580]  they're all going to disappear in two weeks people will have forgotten about this attack
[1:15:32.580 --> 1:15:38.660]  in two weeks like they forgot about the west minster attack in one week so putting men with
[1:15:38.660 --> 1:15:45.140]  guns on the street for an extra week completely completely pathetic response not going to do
[1:15:45.140 --> 1:15:50.500]  anything if they want to attack they'll attack it's about not letting them in the frigging country in
[1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:57.300]  the first place his dad was a terrorist his dad was a member of an al-qaeda group and they gave him
[1:15:57.300 --> 1:16:03.940]  sanctuary in the uk absolutely incredible we have this headline out of info was yesterday
[1:16:04.740 --> 1:16:11.060]  manchester bomber motivated by anger over islamophobia well what do you know so it turns out one of
[1:16:11.060 --> 1:16:17.220]  his gang member friends you know he really grew up with some sterling individuals but again he's
[1:16:17.220 --> 1:16:23.300]  the martyr now he's a loser in a thug one of his friends was basically killed in a gangland attack
[1:16:23.300 --> 1:16:30.020]  he was run over with a car murdered stabbed to death at the funeral of his friend he vowed
[1:16:30.020 --> 1:16:35.460]  revenge because he claimed that this was about the quote ill treatment of muslims in britain
[1:16:35.460 --> 1:16:40.420]  so by the sounds of it it was probably a you know a black gang that was having a turf war with a
[1:16:40.420 --> 1:16:46.180]  muslim gang his friend got killed he said this is a hate crime and vowed revenge
[1:16:46.180 --> 1:16:51.940]  so his revenge wasn't against the other gang it was against 12 year old girls at a frigging pop
[1:16:51.940 --> 1:16:58.340]  concert but again he's not a noble savage that's what they try to do with this whole islamophobia
[1:16:58.340 --> 1:17:03.380]  thing oh maybe his grievance was justified maybe because we're bombing libya and syria
[1:17:03.380 --> 1:17:08.340]  and again we've opposed that from the start and that is related don't support jihadists don't
[1:17:08.340 --> 1:17:14.820]  overthrow secular governments but that doesn't give legitimacy to anything this guy was a loser
[1:17:14.820 --> 1:17:20.740]  and a thug but again it's the same narrative embraced by the left immediately after the attack
[1:17:20.740 --> 1:17:26.020]  when they come out with this whole vigil and hashtags and pray for whatever crap talking
[1:17:26.020 --> 1:17:32.340]  about uniting against hate they're not uniting against the real source of hate that's causing
[1:17:32.340 --> 1:17:38.980]  these attacks they're uniting against the hate which in their eyes is anyone who dares to call out
[1:17:38.980 --> 1:17:45.940]  the real ideology behind these attacks they're uniting against us here's another headline terror
[1:17:45.940 --> 1:17:52.820]  expert political correctness to blame for manchester bomber not being reported so he was heard loudly
[1:17:52.820 --> 1:17:57.780]  chanting islamic prayers in the street didn't raise the alarms of any of the neighbors they
[1:17:57.780 --> 1:18:03.380]  thought that was perfectly normal behavior for an islamic ghetto in manchester he was flying an
[1:18:03.380 --> 1:18:10.660]  isis flag from his house he was already on a watch list nobody reported it because again just like
[1:18:10.660 --> 1:18:18.020]  sam bernadino it might have been politically incorrect to do so suspicious behavior behavior
[1:18:18.020 --> 1:18:22.100]  witnessed over and over again just like sam bernadino where they were taken in the packages
[1:18:22.660 --> 1:18:31.140]  same case scenario we're not going to report it because we might be racist he supported isis showed
[1:18:31.140 --> 1:18:37.460]  pro isis sympathies at his local mosque in fact we've got a video clip i think we'll probably play it
[1:18:37.460 --> 1:18:44.420]  in the next segment but they gave out leaflets at the local mosque which decried western values
[1:18:45.060 --> 1:18:50.900]  he was radicalized in these mosques there were four mosques alone in the walley range area of
[1:18:50.900 --> 1:18:57.780]  manchester just in that one tiny area this is the source of the problem radicalization in mosques
[1:18:57.780 --> 1:19:03.060]  they need government people sitting in if these mosques have been identified as sources as sources
[1:19:03.060 --> 1:19:09.780]  of radicalization you need government people sitting in listening to every sermon every lecture
[1:19:10.740 --> 1:19:16.100]  that's how you root out this radicalization in prison it's also a massive problem people get
[1:19:16.100 --> 1:19:21.780]  thrown into prisons controlled by muslim gangs so as not to get beat up they have to join the
[1:19:21.780 --> 1:19:28.420]  muslim gang become a muslim okay put the people behind that in solitary confinement these are
[1:19:28.420 --> 1:19:34.420]  actual solutions which could prevent terrorism we're not even allowed to talk about it people are
[1:19:34.420 --> 1:19:42.820]  more outraged over katie hopkins's frigging tweets you can't even talk about any possible solutions
[1:19:42.820 --> 1:19:49.460]  anybody who tries to talk about solutions is denigrated is smeared as a basically a thought
[1:19:49.460 --> 1:19:54.820]  criminal a hate criminal this is the situation in the united kingdom today this is why these attacks

[1:26:39.060 --> 1:26:46.020]  news stories professor says terrorist attacks are a part of life do nothing this is out of turning
[1:26:46.020 --> 1:26:51.060]  point news a professor at the university of st andrew's in britain has issued a statement
[1:26:51.060 --> 1:26:55.540]  after the isis suicide bombing and he basically says quote the attack in manchester is not the
[1:26:55.540 --> 1:27:00.740]  first and not will be the last it won't be the last what the last decade and a half have shown
[1:27:00.740 --> 1:27:06.420]  is that these events are now part of life just get used to it and do nothing after all that's
[1:27:06.420 --> 1:27:10.740]  what macron said isn't it that's what city can't the mayor of london said if you live in a big
[1:27:10.740 --> 1:27:16.340]  city just get used to your kids being blown up no that's capitulation that's submission there are
[1:27:16.340 --> 1:27:23.300]  actual hard concrete measures you can take to lessen the risk of this one is just not letting
[1:27:23.300 --> 1:27:29.780]  in anybody unvetted from all corners of the globe how about that how novel is that but but no we
[1:27:29.780 --> 1:27:36.100]  have 200 000 migrants from these african countries arriving every single year just to italy alone
[1:27:36.100 --> 1:27:42.740]  some of them radicalized by isis you see what happened in manchester the father was a member
[1:27:42.740 --> 1:27:48.740]  of the terrorist group that killed us troops that overthrew gadafi aligned with these other
[1:27:48.740 --> 1:27:55.220]  al-qaeda affiliates a libyan islamic fighting group they give him refugee status he has children
[1:27:55.220 --> 1:28:00.900]  one of whom is the suicide bomber in manchester that's what these kind of policies lead to yet
[1:28:00.900 --> 1:28:10.020]  another example of it absolutely incredible doctor quits profession after urging minorities to rape
[1:28:10.020 --> 1:28:16.260]  front national voters to create half breeds what a pleasant individual he sounds like this is over
[1:28:16.260 --> 1:28:22.740]  in france of course a doctor who called for ethnic minorities to rape female front national voters
[1:28:22.740 --> 1:28:29.220]  that's marina lapin's party so to bring friends multicolored multicolored descendants those are
[1:28:29.220 --> 1:28:35.860]  his words and quote kill right wing poison in the egg has quit work after a ruling by the order of
[1:28:35.860 --> 1:28:41.780]  physicians so he's basically whining about the fact that he's being forced to quit after literally
[1:28:41.780 --> 1:28:47.140]  calling for women in france to be raped because that that's progressive now you should be able to
[1:28:47.140 --> 1:28:53.140]  say that but he's in frothing whining but her over at the fact that he's had to quit well good
[1:28:53.140 --> 1:28:59.140]  you can't call for women to be raped and expect that not to be any consequences for that absolutely
[1:28:59.140 --> 1:29:07.380]  incredible former navy seal tells katie perry go to hell this is call higby who told pop singer
[1:29:07.380 --> 1:29:11.540]  katie perry to go to hell for thursday for comment she made in favor of open borders after the
[1:29:11.540 --> 1:29:16.980]  manchester suicide bombing interesting now that people are trying to get me to meet katie perry
[1:29:16.980 --> 1:29:23.620]  in london saying that she's aware of my videos and has seen my videos and maybe we're able to
[1:29:23.620 --> 1:29:28.980]  red pill her probably not going to happen given the video that i just made about katie perry but now
[1:29:28.980 --> 1:29:36.020]  we have a former navy seal calling her out for her open border idiocy that's going to wrap it up for

[1:33:31.540 --> 1:33:36.900]  instructor host several television shows on history channel discovery channel cbs news you name it
[1:33:37.700 --> 1:33:43.140]  and he's got tactical insider dot com he's also involved investigating with a group of a current
[1:33:43.140 --> 1:33:49.380]  former law enforcement military multinationally the giant child kidnapping sex trafficking rings
[1:33:49.380 --> 1:33:56.180]  that are out there and so anybody who's watching today on this friday global transmission can
[1:33:56.180 --> 1:34:04.420]  simply search engine un child sex trafficking child murders haiti about a month after craig soyer was
[1:34:04.420 --> 1:34:10.580]  on with us about three months ago it broke on the associated press a year long investigation of
[1:34:10.580 --> 1:34:17.380]  thousands of children raped thousands trafficked out of the country and hundreds dead you can go
[1:34:17.380 --> 1:34:23.780]  read those reports for yourself un sex trafficking haiti associated press so that's one of the subjects
[1:34:23.780 --> 1:34:29.380]  we're going to get into in a later segment today but i wanted to talk to craig about that because
[1:34:29.380 --> 1:34:38.260]  it just goes to the whole mindset of these elites and why those of us that aren't like them are kind
[1:34:38.260 --> 1:34:44.340]  of like blind we don't we don't have avenue into that mindset we don't think like that
[1:34:45.300 --> 1:34:49.940]  and so we're really have a blind spot to it so so how do you respond to that it's the same thing
[1:34:49.940 --> 1:34:56.740]  with islam you can argue islam needs a reformation well maybe al qaeda and isis is a reformation
[1:34:56.740 --> 1:35:00.420]  because i've read the quran it's getting back to what mohammed actually did now here's the deal i
[1:35:00.420 --> 1:35:04.260]  know there's some nice muslims and i know there's alawites and curds and all the rest of it and i
[1:35:04.260 --> 1:35:09.300]  don't want to have war with them i don't want to kill them but that said i can't sit here and watch
[1:35:09.300 --> 1:35:14.500]  manchester 22 girls blown up and killed another 50 something injured and then see the pop singer
[1:35:14.500 --> 1:35:19.620]  call for more open borders and talk about how she hopes her fans effing die that's a quote
[1:35:22.260 --> 1:35:27.540]  and you've got these elitist hollywood people with arm guards and walls and but they don't want you
[1:35:27.540 --> 1:35:32.580]  and i to have guns and then they say have open borders to unvetted countries the six countries
[1:35:32.580 --> 1:35:37.620]  trumps blocked are the ones that they have the sharia law where the local mosque basically hands
[1:35:37.620 --> 1:35:46.100]  out the passports syria is falling to these people but libya and sadan and samalia it's already
[1:35:46.100 --> 1:35:52.420]  falling to it this is crazy so i wanted to get correct soya's take on what happened in manchester
[1:35:52.420 --> 1:35:58.820]  i talked to a green beret about two months ago off record and he said look the next place to be hit
[1:35:58.820 --> 1:36:02.660]  will be england that's where the jihadis are really targeting because they're trying to leave the eu
[1:36:02.660 --> 1:36:06.980]  the jihadis see the eu is kind of their own deal their ally with merkel and others we've seen more
[1:36:06.980 --> 1:36:11.540]  truck attacks more shootings and then they say oh we can't believe this is happening when they were
[1:36:11.540 --> 1:36:15.860]  letting them go back and forth to libya and then back and forth into the country so i wanted to
[1:36:15.860 --> 1:36:20.020]  ask the question because craig hasn't just been a navy seal and all the rest it was also a federal
[1:36:20.020 --> 1:36:27.700]  officer and works many of those modes as well so i wanted to ask him from his sources out there
[1:36:28.260 --> 1:36:33.940]  where he thinks we're currently in this battle with orthodox radical mainline islam and what he
[1:36:33.940 --> 1:36:42.340]  thinks of from his visit that happened last week the middle east well um hi alex wolf uh i do
[1:36:44.580 --> 1:36:48.580]  there's a lot of different ways to look at this what i look at it as the big picture you know
[1:36:48.580 --> 1:36:53.220]  they're talking about uh what's going on over there in england right now with the with the latest
[1:36:53.220 --> 1:36:57.700]  bombing in manchester and who's behind it and how it was done and all the down in the weeds
[1:36:58.580 --> 1:37:03.460]  part of it what i look at is is more of the big picture from the counterterrorism and the federal
[1:37:03.460 --> 1:37:12.580]  law enforcement background is that look i know that the british mi5 mi6 and sas can can solve this
[1:37:12.580 --> 1:37:20.420]  problem given um the freedom to do their jobs so why are they why are their hands tied and why is
[1:37:20.420 --> 1:37:26.900]  this being allowed to happen in the first place why is the stage being set for radical islamists
[1:37:26.900 --> 1:37:34.580]  to to to blow up concerts schools and and the like why is it being allowed when uh the the people
[1:37:34.580 --> 1:37:40.260]  and the professionals across europe know how to handle it why is it not being allowed to be dealt
[1:37:40.260 --> 1:37:46.100]  with and it's this whole political correctness lie that's really got everybody's hands tied so i
[1:37:46.100 --> 1:37:51.300]  say look man people are going to have to get fed up to the point to where they're going to demand
[1:37:51.300 --> 1:37:57.540]  and effective action be taken by their their governments no more as long as there is only
[1:37:57.540 --> 1:38:02.500]  this soft response to terror terrorists we're going to win they're going to get what they want
[1:38:02.500 --> 1:38:06.580]  they're going to bomb the living daylights out of everybody every day all day until they until
[1:38:06.580 --> 1:38:14.900]  nobody's left until uh effective action is taken it's got to be effective and uh those techniques
[1:38:14.900 --> 1:38:20.980]  and tactics are known we we know what it takes to defeat uh terrorism and uh my question is right
[1:38:20.980 --> 1:38:26.580]  now why is that not happening it's it's it's a political problem it's a collective problem it's
[1:38:26.580 --> 1:38:32.180]  a lack of will to win and i think until we address that there's no point in getting down in the weeds
[1:38:32.180 --> 1:38:38.100]  and all the other um my new ship points of yeah exactly so i totally agree with you we don't want
[1:38:38.100 --> 1:38:41.700]  to blend the military and the police because they're they're their hands are tied but you look at
[1:38:41.700 --> 1:38:47.300]  stockholm sweden you look at uh brussels belgium you look at berlin germany or cologne you look
[1:38:47.300 --> 1:38:53.060]  at paris france burning buildings every night cars people being raped killed just crazy town
[1:38:53.060 --> 1:38:58.340]  and inability to address it or do anything and then we learn time and time again the security
[1:38:58.340 --> 1:39:04.420]  services actually know what's going on known by police known by mi-5 known by mi-6 known by the
[1:39:04.420 --> 1:39:09.940]  fbi uh take sam bernadino fbi agents tried to bust them when they went to pakistan and to uh
[1:39:10.820 --> 1:39:14.900]  Saudi arabia and then they were criminally investigated for civil rights violations
[1:39:14.900 --> 1:39:20.180]  a year and a half before they go and shoot up their company party uh at the christmas tree i mean
[1:39:20.180 --> 1:39:24.900]  it's crazy it's it's it's like beyond being paralyzed and of course you've been a federal
[1:39:24.900 --> 1:39:30.180]  officer you've dealt with this encounter terrorism uh what is the general field then about where this
[1:39:30.180 --> 1:39:34.420]  is going to go because clearly it's getting worse clearly they're bringing more refugees here
[1:39:34.420 --> 1:39:40.820]  most of military age men what is the establishment thinking well that's the question of the rank
[1:39:40.820 --> 1:39:45.300]  and file the people that actually have the skills in the background to make a difference are frustrated
[1:39:45.300 --> 1:39:51.620]  there they're they cannot have a their optimal effect without backing from their politicians so
[1:39:51.620 --> 1:39:55.220]  whether it be in the united states and what we just suffered in the last eight years of being
[1:39:55.220 --> 1:40:00.820]  scolded every time we were bombed as did not to pay attention to who did the bombing and not dare
[1:40:00.820 --> 1:40:06.340]  say it you know now now we're watching kind of the same thing uh over in england and it's it's
[1:40:06.340 --> 1:40:11.620]  heartbreaking to see the victims needless victims they should not have suffered this attack um
[1:40:12.260 --> 1:40:18.580]  it's known how to prevent this and the the will is just obviously not there to prevent it uh the
[1:40:18.580 --> 1:40:24.740]  politicians want to play these games and uh lives are at stake national security is at stake so it
[1:40:24.740 --> 1:40:29.620]  really is just going to matter it's going to boil down to the people getting so fed up to where
[1:40:29.620 --> 1:40:34.580]  they're not willing to to play this soft politically correct game anymore that allows terrorism
[1:40:34.580 --> 1:40:38.180]  terrorists to win they're going to have to get fed up and say okay now let's let's get back to
[1:40:38.180 --> 1:40:43.140]  doing what works and let's put a stop to this so our children could go to school uh without being
[1:40:43.140 --> 1:40:47.140]  blown up and by the way what would work i mean if you've got mosque in libya where our government
[1:40:47.140 --> 1:40:51.380]  helped it be a felt state to put the jihadis in and you've got these mosques openly teaching kill
[1:40:51.380 --> 1:40:55.700]  everybody uh and people are saying let's kill people let's coverable well you've got the evidence
[1:40:55.700 --> 1:41:00.180]  of planning terror and and planning mass murder right there just lock their asses up and then you've
[1:41:00.180 --> 1:41:04.260]  got these mosques in the middle east where they're openly saying it well that's fine you just openly
[1:41:04.260 --> 1:41:09.220]  called for this i mean you just got arrested right it just boils down to enforcing the law
[1:41:09.220 --> 1:41:15.860]  and good faith alex it's really that simple uh all of these countries have the laws on the books
[1:41:15.860 --> 1:41:20.580]  if they would only enforce them could clean this right up let me ask you this what is it
[1:41:20.580 --> 1:41:24.660]  sure sure i mean it's not like sometimes and i've been against many of our wars i'm not against our
[1:41:24.660 --> 1:41:29.860]  troops or our country but i'm against some of the wars but once the war is going on a missile
[1:41:29.860 --> 1:41:34.580]  goes the wrong direction kills the people we apologize is terrible a lot of times pay reparations
[1:41:34.580 --> 1:41:39.860]  that's good but the muslims we apologize we kill people on accident third letter annison
[1:41:39.860 --> 1:41:44.980]  but then they won't apologize just their general mosque when they go blow up a bunch of teenage
[1:41:44.980 --> 1:41:51.380]  girls why do the islamists tend to target women children it's like they never seem to go after
[1:41:51.380 --> 1:41:56.260]  combatants they never seem to go after men they're always going after women and children i mean is
[1:41:56.260 --> 1:42:01.140]  that just because they're cowards or what's because don't they know how bad that makes them look well
[1:42:01.140 --> 1:42:06.740]  president trump trump called it right they are cowards and yes that is why it's easier to kill
[1:42:06.740 --> 1:42:11.940]  the innocent and the helpless and the defenseless so that's why nobody respects them and that's why
[1:42:11.940 --> 1:42:18.580]  they they will lose yeah um i think we all need to just just start telling the truth again and
[1:42:18.580 --> 1:42:25.060]  towing around and pretending to uh uh have more compassion for a hostile group uh that they're
[1:42:25.060 --> 1:42:29.460]  coming against our our countries then then we really believe inside it's time to just stand up and
[1:42:29.460 --> 1:42:34.740]  and call it what it is uh we don't like terrorism we don't like the the violence and and we don't
[1:42:34.740 --> 1:42:38.980]  we don't condone it we don't stand for it we should not tolerate it any further and so it's
[1:42:38.980 --> 1:42:43.940]  just a matter of can you imagine being a 20-something-year-old guy and we were and they're sure they let
[1:42:43.940 --> 1:42:47.140]  him in the back and now we know he had help a sophisticated device it's usually muslims in
[1:42:47.140 --> 1:42:50.980]  england running security i've been there many times it's like bizarre they're they're at the
[1:42:50.980 --> 1:42:54.180]  airport asking you if you're planning something you're like give me a break you're wearing a job
[1:42:54.180 --> 1:42:59.540]  lady and imagine you're out a bunch of teenage girls and you walk in and then you're proud to
[1:42:59.540 --> 1:43:05.220]  blow them up i mean that i'm sorry that is the most mentally ill warped logic i've ever heard of
[1:43:05.780 --> 1:43:16.740]  yeah yeah well it's evil anytime you anytime mankind intentionally does harm to the the innocent
[1:43:16.740 --> 1:43:22.180]  and helpless that's evil there's no other way uh to describe it it has a hunger for it doesn't
[1:43:22.180 --> 1:43:27.700]  it justify it yeah it's it's it's you're right it's a depraved and a sick mind that does that
[1:43:28.420 --> 1:43:35.140]  and we should not allow it any further it's not a legitimate outlook it's not it's no way to run
[1:43:35.140 --> 1:43:42.500]  anything it's just it's it's just the they are the least and the weakest among us and they have
[1:43:42.500 --> 1:43:50.340]  resorted to that which is completely unacceptable to try to achieve um but their own objectives
[1:43:50.340 --> 1:43:56.660]  and uh we must not allow it of course trump has called them losers many times we're going to play
[1:43:56.660 --> 1:44:00.500]  a clip of that in a moment and i don't want to just sit here and bash them all day because islam's
[1:44:00.500 --> 1:44:06.100]  a threat orthodox islam's a threat but isn't it creg the bigger threat a political class in europe
[1:44:06.100 --> 1:44:09.540]  and the united states that is allied with it because it's more than just stock comes in
[1:44:09.540 --> 1:44:15.620]  rum in the public capitulating our elites have have basically been bought off uh by the power
[1:44:15.620 --> 1:44:19.380]  structure and one day after our president throws the gauntlet down and says listen
[1:44:19.380 --> 1:44:25.220]  stop killing us we're going to wipe you out they attack the next day yeah yeah well i i agree with
[1:44:25.220 --> 1:44:33.060]  you i don't think um folks like uh merkel over in germany are as foolish as they appear by by just
[1:44:33.060 --> 1:44:38.660]  massively importing terrorists and then you know acting surprised when things start blowing up i
[1:44:38.660 --> 1:44:44.260]  don't think anybody's that stupid i i do believe and have seen behind the scenes that they are corrupt
[1:44:44.260 --> 1:44:50.740]  they are uh in league with globalists that that buy them off and promise them a political power
[1:44:50.740 --> 1:44:57.460]  in favors and uh we we've got uh a segment unfortunately of our society that uh that that
[1:44:57.460 --> 1:45:04.980]  seek their own personal benefit uh over the the the best interest of their citizens so they're
[1:45:04.980 --> 1:45:11.220]  their traders they betray their own people and they pretend uh that somehow mass importing
[1:45:11.220 --> 1:45:16.260]  terrorists can can in any way shape or form be a good idea well sure your father was a well-known
[1:45:16.260 --> 1:45:20.340]  pastor here in texas and i don't just say this because i mean i grew up christian and i was i
[1:45:20.340 --> 1:45:23.860]  love god but i kind of got sick of hearing about it all day for my family because i got older i
[1:45:23.860 --> 1:45:28.980]  learned it really is evil we're facing and you look at katie perry and all her satanic rituals on
[1:45:28.980 --> 1:45:35.300]  tv and then her saying open borders bring them in you know they they're allied with it because
[1:45:35.300 --> 1:45:41.140]  they get off on the evil it's a perversion they enjoy flaunting it and allying with it because
[1:45:41.140 --> 1:45:46.820]  spiritually they're one with it because they are fundamentally losers here's president trump

[1:46:53.940 --> 1:46:59.380]  our politicians in a lot of cases our elected officials are not representing us they're not
[1:46:59.380 --> 1:47:04.180]  looking out for our best interest and we have to be more assertive thank god we've gotten president
[1:47:04.180 --> 1:47:09.060]  trump i do believe that uh that the tide has changed here in the united states because of that

[1:54:35.700 --> 1:54:40.260]  south rich who did the killing everything and you hear this stuff makes you sick for your country
[1:54:40.260 --> 1:54:44.980]  the democrats know full well what they've done and trump knows what's going on he knows about the
[1:54:44.980 --> 1:54:49.380]  illegal spying on the american people the deep state is a bunch of multinationals there i don't
[1:54:49.380 --> 1:54:53.700]  want to keep bashing muslims but it's in the news they've like put a bunch of islamist groups in
[1:54:53.700 --> 1:54:59.140]  charge of the congressional laptops and computers they're spying on them that way i mean it's like
[1:54:59.140 --> 1:55:04.980]  i can't believe we're this penetrated and i wanted to ask craig soyer in the short segment
[1:55:04.980 --> 1:55:08.580]  another segment coming up in a moment just briefly from his law enforcement sources as a federal
[1:55:08.580 --> 1:55:13.620]  officer former navy seal and some of the most elite rips out there tv host you name it from his
[1:55:13.620 --> 1:55:18.580]  sources what's happening currently to trump uh because man they are out to get him and we know
[1:55:18.580 --> 1:55:24.260]  they admit he's got this fifth column inside of all the agencies just totally ignoring uh the
[1:55:24.260 --> 1:55:32.340]  reforms he's trying to bring in yeah well he's got a lot of deep state leftovers uh from the
[1:55:32.340 --> 1:55:39.140]  obama administration and previous who are out to undo everything he's trying to do for we the people
[1:55:39.140 --> 1:55:45.380]  so uh we there are basically uh parasites that are out for power within our different levels
[1:55:45.380 --> 1:55:50.020]  of our government who just want to um build whatever power that they've got there they never
[1:55:50.020 --> 1:55:54.420]  want to give it up so it's not like they go and serve for a while in government and then go and
[1:55:54.420 --> 1:55:59.380]  assimilate back into the the society they they're there to stay and they don't want to be uprooted
[1:55:59.380 --> 1:56:05.540]  just like a tick on a dog so uh there are those who are creating a logjam for anything positive
[1:56:05.540 --> 1:56:10.500]  that the president trump tries to do so just as an example for law enforcement a lot of my friends
[1:56:10.500 --> 1:56:15.380]  in the federal law enforcement are frustrated they are good patriotic decent hardworking americans
[1:56:15.380 --> 1:56:21.540]  who who can fix so many of these things that we're facing but their hands are tied because uh
[1:56:21.540 --> 1:56:26.500]  several officials up and down their chain of command within the the doj are corrupt and they
[1:56:26.500 --> 1:56:32.260]  will not act in good faith and they will they will you know help the clintons and and others you
[1:56:32.260 --> 1:56:37.220]  know hide a lot of the facts and and and thwart a lot of the investigation so how do we stop saboteurs
[1:56:38.340 --> 1:56:43.460]  well how we stop them what i might what i would love to tell the president as he needs to to
[1:56:43.460 --> 1:56:49.460]  grab a hold of his doj and and the directors of the different agencies and say look my commander's
[1:56:49.460 --> 1:56:55.540]  intent to you sir is to to purge and clean out your your agency of all subversives we're we're
[1:56:55.540 --> 1:57:00.740]  going to get back to serving the american people in good faith and you are to carry out the charter
[1:57:00.740 --> 1:57:07.460]  of your your agency uh from the beginning and and you let me know if you've got any problems if you
[1:57:07.460 --> 1:57:12.420]  need more assistance but your your personal task is to get rid of those who are creating the logjam
[1:57:12.420 --> 1:57:17.620]  who are against our constitution or against our people who we know are corrupt fire them get rid
[1:57:17.620 --> 1:57:21.620]  of them and if they're they're worse than that prosecute and look how they leak all this stuff
[1:57:21.620 --> 1:57:26.900]  that isn't even real they use secrecy to leak fake stuff then they leak the manchester info
[1:57:26.900 --> 1:57:33.940]  and then blame trump when they're the ones leaking yeah yeah well all the false accusations are just
[1:57:33.940 --> 1:57:42.420]  an um a a tactic to tie up uh the president and and his supporters in defending him so he
[1:57:42.420 --> 1:57:48.180]  by the way there as you know democratic memos admit the intense just tie him up yeah yeah yeah
[1:57:48.180 --> 1:57:52.820]  they just want to tie him up just like a boxer you know you um well i don't want to get to a
[1:57:52.820 --> 1:57:57.620]  fighting tactics but uh yeah they're they're looking to tie him up and busy him what he needs to be
[1:57:57.620 --> 1:58:03.460]  busy doing is supporting his doj and his doj needs to be at warp speed arresting and perp walk in
[1:58:03.460 --> 1:58:09.140]  these comebacks who are his worst antagonists we the people really deserve more justice than
[1:58:09.140 --> 1:58:14.660]  we're seeing and it needs to be ramped up uh big time big time they need to start uh prosecuting
[1:58:14.660 --> 1:58:19.140]  his needs back i want to come back and talk about the latest on investigations into the whole

[2:01:54.260 --> 2:02:00.420]  groups of subversives and anti-american and globalists they all seem to to be tied into this
[2:02:00.420 --> 2:02:07.140]  this whole uh like you call it a subculture of pedophilia and child rape it's just horrible but
[2:02:07.780 --> 2:02:12.660]  i wish i could say it's surprising but you know birds of a feather if you will
[2:02:13.940 --> 2:02:21.460]  it's how i see it so again i just think it really has to do with uh regaining control
[2:02:21.460 --> 2:02:26.900]  of our country we've got a pro-american president again i say man while we've got the football
[2:02:26.900 --> 2:02:31.940]  let's move it as far upfield and you know he's good by how they're attacking i mean oh yeah yeah
[2:02:31.940 --> 2:02:36.180]  yeah look at their desperation to shut him up and you know they're they're trying to say it throw
[2:02:36.180 --> 2:02:42.900]  impeachment out for every which kind of uh bs excuse so yeah man he's he's under their skin
[2:02:42.900 --> 2:02:47.460]  and he's a he's a real threat because he just apparently intends to act in good faith for
[2:02:47.460 --> 2:02:52.100]  we the people so man shame on us if we do not all rally around i was about to say he's not perfect
[2:02:52.100 --> 2:02:56.500]  but he literally is acting in good faith yeah exactly i mean who needs to be perfect i mean
[2:02:56.500 --> 2:03:03.060]  the guy's trying to trying to uphold the constitution and re-establish the the wealth and freedom under
[2:03:03.060 --> 2:03:09.460]  a 360 assault yeah yeah from all sides look at how you and i we're not we're not victims we're
[2:03:09.460 --> 2:03:14.580]  conquerors we weren't with christ help we're not whining but the attacks were under are insane
[2:03:14.580 --> 2:03:21.140]  you imagine trump well oh yeah yeah and look at those like media matters you know we got scumbags
[2:03:21.140 --> 2:03:26.580]  that are that are doing the will of of evil doers like sorrows and they're attacking you they're
[2:03:26.580 --> 2:03:32.660]  attacking uh sean hennedy they're attacking any decent patriotic american uh that dares to still
[2:03:32.660 --> 2:03:37.620]  stand up and and tell the truth and and uh you know the the far left media are full of scumbags
[2:03:37.620 --> 2:03:41.780]  who are lying to the american public and saying you know hillary clinton's just a nice person who's
[2:03:41.780 --> 2:03:47.060]  some maybe just misunderstood i mean they're just denying all of the the truth that we're watching
[2:03:47.060 --> 2:03:53.700]  with our own two eyes we have to stand up and rally around folks like you sean hennedy uh the president
[2:03:54.340 --> 2:04:00.580]  the truth tellers and and unite to fight back these subversives who will continue attacking
[2:04:00.580 --> 2:04:07.140]  until we stop them and we must unite together and actively stop them it's time well we're
[2:04:07.140 --> 2:04:10.900]  going to continue to watch things as they unfold this is a great time in history it's very positive
[2:04:10.900 --> 2:04:15.780]  it's very negative best of times worst of times but craig i'm glad you're there tackle insider.com
[2:04:15.780 --> 2:04:19.780]  i'm going to be launching more radio shows more tv shows very very soon i'd like to offer you a
[2:04:19.780 --> 2:04:25.380]  slot uh either once a week or five days a week whatever you want as our tactical advisor here
[2:04:25.380 --> 2:04:28.820]  because we got a lot of radio affiliates out there that are ready to pick up shows we're
[2:04:28.820 --> 2:04:32.020]  going to launch so that's the next level my friend so we'll be talking to you very soon craig
[2:04:32.580 --> 2:04:37.700]  outstanding thank you so much alex i appreciate it thank you all right yeah craig's big tv host
[2:04:37.700 --> 2:04:41.620]  we've got a lot going but he's he's bucking the whole system despite the fact he's getting attacked
[2:04:41.620 --> 2:04:46.900]  behind the scenes because there's no future if good men don't stand up as thomas jefferson said
[2:04:46.900 --> 2:04:51.700]  we'll be back ladies and gentlemen on the other side as i break down some big science news
[2:04:51.700 --> 2:04:55.060]  info wars dot com spread that link today it's under attack

[2:07:44.980 --> 2:07:49.060]  i'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older more expensive filters that
[2:07:49.060 --> 2:07:54.660]  didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then for war store
[2:07:54.660 --> 2:08:10.740]  dot com if you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow i hear people talking about
[2:08:10.740 --> 2:08:20.260]  about the way we have to live here in this country harping on wars we fight and griping about the
[2:08:20.260 --> 2:08:28.660]  way things don't be i don't mind them i don't mind them switching sides and standing up things
[2:08:28.660 --> 2:08:34.900]  they believe in and moving to north korea when they're running down my country man they're walking
[2:08:34.900 --> 2:08:42.340]  on the fight inside me yeah you're walking yeah walking on the fight inside all right let me get
[2:08:42.340 --> 2:08:53.620]  into some personal issues here with viewers when i cover how hydrofluorosalic acid eats holes in
[2:08:53.620 --> 2:09:02.340]  people's brains or how acid forms of fluoride are bad for your brain the media makes big jokes
[2:09:02.340 --> 2:09:08.500]  about it and says oh that guy is a crazy person we've all seen the 1964 film dr strange love
[2:09:09.060 --> 2:09:15.780]  for jack t ripper the general launches nuclear war aka kurtis lemay against
[2:09:18.100 --> 2:09:25.060]  the soviet union to protect our precious bodily fluids we've all seen the jokes the problem is
[2:09:25.060 --> 2:09:32.180]  if you just search engine harvard study fluoride causing massive iq reductions fluoride causing
[2:09:32.180 --> 2:09:40.580]  bone cancer fluoride causing breast cancer fluoride causing all these other crises
[2:09:43.780 --> 2:09:49.380]  it makes you angry i'm not up here on some metaphysical high horse like i've got all the
[2:09:49.380 --> 2:09:59.940]  answers but i i am a new sound and so if i read 20 years ago major studies about fluoride killing
[2:09:59.940 --> 2:10:09.780]  people and then i read modern studies saying the same thing and then i see
[2:10:11.860 --> 2:10:20.500]  steven cobert making fun of me at least six seven times in the last month on fluoride alone
[2:10:22.900 --> 2:10:26.420]  it makes me ask what's really going on here doesn't steven cobert have kids
[2:10:26.420 --> 2:10:31.540]  can he read a harvard study so let me in the time i have here about nine minutes
[2:10:33.300 --> 2:10:39.860]  go over something a lot bigger than fluoride a lot bigger than the lead narsnik a lot bigger than
[2:10:39.860 --> 2:10:46.340]  solar flares and radiation giving you skin cancer i'm going to break something down that is
[2:10:46.340 --> 2:10:56.100]  in tens of thousands of research documents peer reviewed studies and medical reports
[2:10:57.300 --> 2:11:01.300]  and the best way to just direct you towards the rabbit hole because i can only point out the
[2:11:01.300 --> 2:11:05.300]  rabbit hole for you you kind of you'll see it for yourself if you want to because you're already
[2:11:05.300 --> 2:11:09.620]  down the rabbit hole whether you admit it or not you should consciously go ahead and admit
[2:11:09.620 --> 2:11:17.060]  you're in the rabbit hole now let's go ahead and look at this
[2:11:18.660 --> 2:11:22.180]  this is a story from info wars dot com on may 16th last week
[2:11:24.420 --> 2:11:30.740]  scientists fearful of ecological risks sparked by gmo micro algae micro algae
[2:11:32.660 --> 2:11:37.380]  that's basically just plants that live in the ocean slash fungus that live in the oceans
[2:11:37.380 --> 2:11:43.380]  they're all closely related and then it goes over the research for the university california
[2:11:43.380 --> 2:11:49.860]  in san diego that bacteria other funguses don't slow this down
[2:11:52.340 --> 2:12:01.700]  if this algae slash fungus doesn't get light it doesn't care and they say you know
[2:12:01.700 --> 2:12:07.540]  no we're kind of worried because something like this could turn out being the andromeda string
[2:12:08.100 --> 2:12:14.340]  the michael criton book written back in the 70s made into a movie where a intergalactic algae slash
[2:12:14.980 --> 2:12:20.340]  fungus type creature that's in between those two scientists have always worried about something
[2:12:20.340 --> 2:12:26.340]  in between an algae and a fungus and that's what this is that if it got here and it didn't
[2:12:26.340 --> 2:12:31.300]  have any known enemies it would just suddenly grow and take everything over in fact most
[2:12:31.300 --> 2:12:36.420]  elites are actually worried about something just like this and this is just one company
[2:12:37.380 --> 2:12:39.700]  we know of that's doing this through a university study
[2:12:45.140 --> 2:12:48.580]  and then i think about how i've talked about algae
[2:12:51.300 --> 2:12:58.980]  single cell plants in water or growing on top of rocks and funguses and all the rest of it
[2:12:58.980 --> 2:13:05.460]  closely related i think about the vox story a few months ago i watched alex jones give his
[2:13:05.460 --> 2:13:11.140]  viewers health advice here's what i learned there's a fungus epidemic in info wars
[2:13:13.780 --> 2:13:19.860]  has just the supplements to stop it now by the way we had an introductory anti fungus
[2:13:21.540 --> 2:13:27.060]  probiotic it was so popular sold out in three days even before this ever came out we can't even get
[2:13:27.060 --> 2:13:31.300]  the pure ingredients right now so it's been sold out for three months but that doesn't matter
[2:13:31.300 --> 2:13:35.540]  i'm not doing this to sell you a supplement the point is i came up with supplements with top
[2:13:35.540 --> 2:13:41.780]  scientists because i'm concerned about countering this because i personally get sick from it my
[2:13:41.780 --> 2:13:47.300]  children get sick from it and the medical doctors i talked to say the dogs the cats the bats
[2:13:47.300 --> 2:13:57.540]  the frogs the fish are dying from weird genetically engineered funguses and and and algae's already
[2:13:59.300 --> 2:14:04.020]  and i'm about to show you not me saying what scientists told me a big stack of mainstream news
[2:14:04.020 --> 2:14:14.020]  saying it and that's what's crazy is that this is all going on and i'm here on the radio and tv
[2:14:14.020 --> 2:14:19.220]  having scientists on talking about it like most of the bats in the u.s have died because of these
[2:14:19.220 --> 2:14:27.060]  weird funguses that never showed up before that eat their lungs and brains i know four or five people
[2:14:27.060 --> 2:14:31.700]  well who've had brain surgeries or who've had family that have died because suddenly fungus
[2:14:31.700 --> 2:14:36.340]  goes up their nose gets in their brain they have a brain tumor and they cut in and it's a fungus
[2:14:36.340 --> 2:14:44.580]  slash algae growing in their brain by the way we're we've been sold out of that for months
[2:14:44.580 --> 2:14:50.660]  and i'm not even saying our uh product that targets fungus and stuff in the gut will even
[2:14:50.660 --> 2:14:55.940]  help you if it's in the rest of your body the point is 99% of our coverage is just reporting
[2:14:55.940 --> 2:15:00.820]  in what's happening of course we come up with a product that i take myself hoping to counter it
[2:15:00.820 --> 2:15:08.900]  but but see they won't address the real crisis they just want to make a joke out of well let me
[2:15:08.900 --> 2:15:15.060]  tell you something i love texas my family's been here since like 1829 both sides the fungus and
[2:15:15.060 --> 2:15:19.220]  the algae and the allergies are so bad my grandmother just died this year she hadn't had allergies
[2:15:19.220 --> 2:15:24.100]  she was 85 years old i never had allergies till a few years ago almost everybody i know can't breathe
[2:15:24.100 --> 2:15:28.820]  they got doctor clinics with lines around the block not knowing what to do because of this crisis
[2:15:28.820 --> 2:15:31.540]  i want to breathe i don't want to be sick
[2:15:36.260 --> 2:15:41.300]  but let's get into the actual science attacking fungal infection
[2:15:43.380 --> 2:15:50.820]  one of the world's major killers science daily a lot of these autoimmune diseases a lot of folks
[2:15:50.820 --> 2:16:00.660]  dying crows disease you name it fungus fungus algae algae fungus algae that's science today let's
[2:16:00.660 --> 2:16:03.460]  make sure you know let's call the studies right there and again
[2:16:06.900 --> 2:16:15.380]  they're now genetically engineering funguses that are part bacteria that's animal
[2:16:15.380 --> 2:16:22.660]  and they're engineering algae's that are part funguses and part bacteria that's what these are
[2:16:24.420 --> 2:16:30.340]  that nothing kills do you know that's what cancer is you know we in our own bodies have cancer
[2:16:30.340 --> 2:16:34.900]  it's when cells stop dying and keep replicating then they stop following the regular code of the
[2:16:34.900 --> 2:16:44.100]  colony organism that we are and our different organs and systems that work together fail
[2:16:45.940 --> 2:16:50.980]  this isn't about being black or white or hispanic or older young or northern or southern or from
[2:16:50.980 --> 2:16:57.700]  chile or from japan this is about top scientists i just showed you the article major university
[2:16:57.700 --> 2:17:04.340]  saying we're creating new organisms i should have started this whole piece today alien organisms
[2:17:04.340 --> 2:17:11.060]  have been created on earth aliens are now loose upon the planet aliens are now among us and are
[2:17:11.060 --> 2:17:18.260]  killing millions of us a year then people would listen you see because i'm informed
[2:17:21.060 --> 2:17:28.980]  it's not sexy but if i laid it out like science fiction then it would be oh incredibly amazing
[2:17:28.980 --> 2:17:37.620]  so they've created salmon that are three times the size of regular salmon that are part asparagus
[2:17:37.620 --> 2:17:45.460]  and part grasshopper and they live twice as long and attack and kill the other fish okay what's that
[2:17:45.460 --> 2:17:51.540]  going to do we don't know but we know long term mutations happen when they change something
[2:17:51.540 --> 2:17:58.580]  genetics main course when they change the main genetic direction of a creature they can do it
[2:17:58.580 --> 2:18:04.980]  one generation but second third fourth it degenerates because you can splice stuff the way you want
[2:18:04.980 --> 2:18:15.140]  it once but it unravels the second third so i don't know what's going to happen i just know
[2:18:15.140 --> 2:18:20.420]  that all the real scientists point out it's already wreaking havoc and causing genetic problems
[2:18:20.420 --> 2:18:26.180]  and causing allergies and causing us because we're already so bombarded by new artificial alien
[2:18:26.180 --> 2:18:32.180]  species a plant an animal and fungus that we a fungus is a cross between animal and plant
[2:18:32.180 --> 2:18:33.780]  we don't know what to do
[2:18:37.540 --> 2:18:42.900]  and we're dying and we're getting cancer because our autoimmune system gives up and then now
[2:18:42.900 --> 2:18:48.100]  since your autoimmune system turns off the regular cell replication that becomes mutated
[2:18:48.100 --> 2:18:53.220]  doesn't get cut off your body gives up you die cancer is your body giving up
[2:18:53.220 --> 2:18:59.380]  and we come back i've got the stack of news articles right here all mainstream science
[2:18:59.380 --> 2:19:06.260]  journals about how mutated fungus and mutated algae and mutated fungus analogy crossed with
[2:19:06.260 --> 2:19:12.740]  animal dna because again fungus is basically between a plant and animal they're now splicing
[2:19:12.740 --> 2:19:16.980]  those all around god knows this is the basic building blocks of everything
[2:19:16.980 --> 2:19:24.900]  and with primitive genetic engineering limited we're already having crises
[2:19:24.900 --> 2:19:27.700]  can you imagine an animal i just love my children
[2:19:30.980 --> 2:19:36.740]  i just love my children and don't want to be sick and they call me a horrible person

[2:24:20.980 --> 2:24:27.220]  people i look back at them and i say i'm worried about the entire species i'm worried about humans
[2:24:27.220 --> 2:24:32.340]  and the planet itself our spaceship i'm a real environmentalist the fake environmentalists admit
[2:24:32.340 --> 2:24:37.540]  they just want full control of human development and i say we ought to be worried about humanity
[2:24:37.540 --> 2:24:43.780]  itself making it the future not just one group of humans that you want to save
[2:24:43.780 --> 2:24:50.020]  and you see that choice set up where humanity will never make get out of this
[2:24:51.140 --> 2:24:56.980]  by ourselves as some gay group or some straight group or some black group or some white group
[2:24:57.540 --> 2:25:02.260]  we're being divided and conquered systematically that doesn't mean i don't come out and expose
[2:25:02.260 --> 2:25:07.940]  some racist mexican group saying they're the supreme god nation and la raza kill all the white
[2:25:07.940 --> 2:25:14.100]  people or that i'm not gonna go criticize some white supremacist groups saying the exact same crap but
[2:25:14.100 --> 2:25:21.620]  that's all the diversion islam itself and its modern permutation is a diversion the planet
[2:25:21.620 --> 2:25:26.500]  as we know it is being genetically irrevocably altered our atmosphere is being altered
[2:25:28.340 --> 2:25:34.100]  and i don't believe in space aliens our elites are acting like they are that's all i know
[2:25:34.100 --> 2:25:39.060]  scientifically they're altering the atmosphere scientifically they're waging war against the
[2:25:39.060 --> 2:25:46.980]  main biosphere of the planet and i can sit back and look at it and say this isn't human there's no
[2:25:46.980 --> 2:25:50.580]  way the elites would just be doing this on their own this is too sophisticated
[2:25:54.020 --> 2:25:58.580]  but notice the media doesn't attack me and say alex shows belief in space aliens because i'm
[2:25:58.580 --> 2:26:04.500]  hitting just the root science that what the elites are doing is anti-human anti-planet
[2:26:04.500 --> 2:26:11.220]  anti-earth this earth is its own genetic system its own genetic history we're together as this
[2:26:11.220 --> 2:26:15.540]  planet doesn't mean we don't fight each other and kill each other and have our own problems
[2:26:16.100 --> 2:26:19.700]  but at the end of the day we ought to respect each other because we all come from the same place
[2:26:19.700 --> 2:26:32.340]  we have a shared experience and the genetic flora and fauna the bacteria the fungus and the algae
[2:26:32.340 --> 2:26:39.940]  is all being altered and it's being religiously released like the movie alien covenant you know
[2:26:39.940 --> 2:26:44.420]  you'll see that cheesy movie and it's like they're going in genetically engineering planets
[2:26:44.420 --> 2:26:53.060]  monsanto spent billions making brazil take gmo corn and now it's spreading into all their corn
[2:26:53.060 --> 2:26:57.780]  and infecting everything and causing health problems because it's a takeover there's some
[2:26:57.780 --> 2:27:02.740]  larger plan you study this thing you're not dealing with your average bureaucrat
[2:27:02.740 --> 2:27:12.980]  and so many areas of the united states are going to have to be evacuated
[2:27:14.660 --> 2:27:18.660]  we're the big testing ground but already the fungus and the algae is in the atmosphere
[2:27:19.300 --> 2:27:24.100]  where science supposed to be and it's already raining down the elites are already racing
[2:27:24.980 --> 2:27:31.620]  not from war i've learned but to rural areas in the pacific and and the southern hemisphere
[2:27:31.620 --> 2:27:36.340]  to get away from what's in the air and then you go see a movie like inner stellar and there's all
[2:27:36.340 --> 2:27:41.700]  this fungus and stuff in the and the atmosphere it's killing everything and i'm like oh my god
[2:27:41.700 --> 2:27:45.940]  in the real world the fungus is already killing most of the crops but don't worry monsanto has
[2:27:45.940 --> 2:27:52.660]  a genetically engineered crop that can live in fungus and i'm just like oh my god the people
[2:27:52.660 --> 2:27:59.300]  didn't cook this up it's that's why it's almost a joke to have megan kelly's producer here and
[2:27:59.300 --> 2:28:04.660]  like wanting to be big on tv or wanting to be famous all i want is the planet up to get destroyed
[2:28:06.980 --> 2:28:12.980]  i mean it's just it's everywhere with the trees in my yard are dying they have fungus on it i mean
[2:28:17.860 --> 2:28:22.260]  i don't know what's going on but it's not good folks i mean look at these science blog first
[2:28:22.260 --> 2:28:28.180]  systematic study of deadly antibiotic resistant fungus reported oh yeah fungus in humans identify
[2:28:28.180 --> 2:28:32.820]  with the first time as key factor in crone's disease told you that 10 years ago science daily
[2:28:32.820 --> 2:28:38.420]  new drug candidate found for deadly fungal lung infections on visit these cops when i was in clave
[2:28:38.420 --> 2:28:42.900]  when a couple of them were dead or dying from just going into one crack house with fungus
[2:28:42.900 --> 2:28:47.700]  fungus induced neurological diseases and underestimated risk to animals and humans
[2:28:49.220 --> 2:28:54.660]  just like coal miners will get killed by the silicate dust this is beyond that is genetic
[2:28:54.660 --> 2:29:04.100]  fungy read about it national bio and agro defense facility toxic mold weapons of mass destruction
[2:29:04.100 --> 2:29:09.140]  now weaponized it's all raining down from the atmosphere i mean i don't know man i don't know
[2:29:09.140 --> 2:29:18.660]  man all i know is whoa everybody whoa it's getting bad we're gonna go to break and come back because
[2:29:18.660 --> 2:29:26.580]  millie weaver months ago with our researchers and with gavin exposed four chain later confirmed it
[2:29:26.580 --> 2:29:31.940]  there was professors running around assaulting people at berkeley with these clubs these maces
[2:29:31.940 --> 2:29:36.100]  trying to kill them basically in my view and and it's now been confirmed one of these guys has
[2:29:36.100 --> 2:29:42.580]  been indicted arrested but she's coming up with the whole breakdown effect let me let me just come
[2:29:42.580 --> 2:29:55.060]  back and introduce her this is important stay with us fires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[2:30:34.020 --> 2:30:40.500]  him after they released a list of companies that advertised during hannity show prominent twitter
[2:30:40.500 --> 2:30:48.340]  icon mark dice then went to twitter and said us a a your boycotting hannity to please a few liberal
[2:30:48.340 --> 2:30:54.420]  trolls so now we're going to boycott your company because we think you're garbage this is millie

[2:32:10.100 --> 2:32:15.300]  sacrifice that's what this holiday and remembrance is all about is those that made the ultimate
[2:32:15.300 --> 2:32:20.260]  sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world this group of specials for 2017

[2:33:07.140 --> 2:33:17.860]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:33:22.420 --> 2:33:25.700]  all right my friends millie weaver's butt coming here and break down the
[2:33:26.500 --> 2:33:31.380]  professor there at berkeley that's been indicted for reportedly assaulting someone with a
[2:33:31.380 --> 2:33:38.340]  weapon i guess they call it a bike lock but it's equivalent of three four pound
[2:33:38.340 --> 2:33:44.740]  big piece of steel you can swing and like a trudgeon or a mace and kill somebody with
[2:33:44.740 --> 2:33:49.300]  and it was first info wars i'm proud of millie that identified it was professors and others
[2:33:49.300 --> 2:33:54.260]  that were bailing people out and that it was professors and others that were reportedly
[2:33:54.260 --> 2:34:01.220]  swinging the weapons and again in my view trying to kill people so that's coming up but
[2:34:01.220 --> 2:34:07.460]  very briefly here i want to just point out that we have memorial day specials some of these items
[2:34:07.460 --> 2:34:14.900]  like colloidal silver and knockout are the biggest specials we've ever offered 65 percent off on

[2:34:49.380 --> 2:34:57.060]  this today i didn't do it i'm going to say it now i am not a consumerist i don't enjoy shopping
[2:34:58.260 --> 2:35:02.740]  it's kind of fun to go shop for hamburger meat or steaks or chicken i mean i i like shopping
[2:35:02.740 --> 2:35:07.220]  for food other stuff i don't like i'm not a guy that just gets off on buying things and feels
[2:35:07.220 --> 2:35:12.580]  fulfilled but when i buy something i know the globalists don't like me to have like a firearm
[2:35:12.580 --> 2:35:17.780]  or i go out and i do things that i know are human empowering and build new economies then i feel good
[2:35:17.780 --> 2:35:24.500]  so i love to use the money i have to build better economies to go buy raw milk from amish each week
[2:35:24.500 --> 2:35:29.620]  or go to the farmers market and buy stuff from family farmers that's less expensive with no middle
[2:35:29.620 --> 2:35:35.140]  man in the grocery store and is better quality i love going and eating dinner at a mom and pop
[2:35:36.500 --> 2:35:42.260]  restaurant the food's usually better anyways in a chain it's that same basic common sense so there's
[2:35:42.260 --> 2:35:48.820]  a good consumerism when you use consumerism to vote with your dollars to vote with your actions
[2:35:48.820 --> 2:35:53.700]  and build a better world i don't think i'm stating some big secret here i think everybody
[2:35:53.700 --> 2:36:02.820]  knows what i'm saying is just common sense veritas and that said paul watson was mainly paid i'll
[2:36:02.820 --> 2:36:08.020]  give you some inside baseball off of the youtube channel we set up for him years ago and off the
[2:36:08.020 --> 2:36:14.020]  funding he got from that i gave him some other funding but we're not wealthy years so london's
[2:36:14.020 --> 2:36:18.820]  an expensive place to live and he's got a few crew members under him uh so it was hard for paul
[2:36:18.820 --> 2:36:24.100]  to pay his bills i'm going to give you some private info and then the last year they said well
[2:36:24.100 --> 2:36:29.380]  you're a libertarian right-winger we're going to demonetize your channel about 80 or so it's more
[2:36:29.380 --> 2:36:35.620]  than 70 and so i was having to try to dick around even be able to pay paul so he could you know still
[2:36:35.620 --> 2:36:42.500]  work here and he said you know alex i've never done this but because i'm under attack and we're
[2:36:42.500 --> 2:36:46.420]  under attack i guess i'll go ahead and become commercial i'm from northern england we're not
[2:36:46.420 --> 2:36:51.060]  really commercial we're you know pretty low key as everybody knows because i'm ready to do what
[2:36:51.060 --> 2:36:55.140]  you've asked me to do i'm ready to be commercial because i i see they're trying to shut us down
[2:36:55.140 --> 2:37:02.500]  and i said paul what do you want to do and he said um they hate this image of me like five years ago
[2:37:02.500 --> 2:37:07.060]  my hair was longer because it looks kind of trendy kind of like a russell brand and he
[2:37:07.060 --> 2:37:11.620]  is like russell brand he's a little tall like russell brand and he said they hate this image
[2:37:11.620 --> 2:37:17.060]  they want it banned they want it shut down it's a sepia image of him with long hair kind of smiling
[2:37:18.500 --> 2:37:24.900]  and he said let's say conservatism is the new counterculture a nice soft gray high quality
[2:37:24.900 --> 2:37:33.060]  shirt this is paul's idea with info wars dot com on the back so you can meet black minded people
[2:37:33.060 --> 2:37:39.460]  it's a unisex shirt great for men and women it's that soft you know mixed fabric and i said okay paul
[2:37:39.460 --> 2:37:44.980]  will do that i quietly said to the crew i said paul's a really successful guy and i said people
[2:37:44.980 --> 2:37:48.980]  are gonna buy a t-shirt like that you guess what it's our best-selling t-shirt for three months
[2:37:48.980 --> 2:37:55.620]  running and we brought in as much revenue as we've lost from youtube so the lord give us the lord
[2:37:55.620 --> 2:38:06.020]  take us away you know he gets a hundred million views or more every few months on our platforms
[2:38:06.020 --> 2:38:10.580]  and they they they took that away they said you know we're not going to let you have money because
[2:38:10.580 --> 2:38:15.780]  you're pro britain you're pro sovereignty you're anti radical islam we're going to destroy you
[2:38:15.780 --> 2:38:20.420]  but guess what didn't work because now we are making back that same amount of money in fact it
[2:38:20.420 --> 2:38:25.380]  may even be more now that i'm plugging it with conservatism is the new counterculture paul
[2:38:25.380 --> 2:38:32.420]  watson with the triggering image of him on the front and info wars dot com on the back and i
[2:38:32.420 --> 2:38:36.660]  personally kind of came with a shirt design because uh it's this it's this it's the same
[2:38:36.660 --> 2:38:44.980]  manufacturer here that i go with by the way made in the usa i should add that's this acrylic slash
[2:38:44.980 --> 2:38:50.260]  cotton that is so smooth it's unisex it's so comfortable and that's how you fund the operation
[2:38:50.260 --> 2:38:55.220]  and also let them know we will adapt we will overcome you try to shut us down we'll we'll
[2:38:55.220 --> 2:38:59.060]  fund ourselves some other way and then finally in closing because we got millie we were coming up
[2:38:59.060 --> 2:39:04.900]  with a big report paul wanted his face just to trigger them this is an anti-commercial guy somebody
[2:39:04.900 --> 2:39:08.900]  i could even get on air for the first 10 years he worked with me some guy that hates being on
[2:39:08.900 --> 2:39:12.180]  air somebody that hates being commercial but they tried to destroy and they tried to you know
[2:39:12.180 --> 2:39:16.180]  make him bankrupt so he's like i'm ready to fight back and you're fighting back two listeners
[2:39:16.180 --> 2:39:22.260]  and it's emboldening paul to not back down we have the uh ceramic conservatism is the
[2:39:22.260 --> 2:39:27.780]  new counterculture paul watson cup and we have this other beauty conservatism is the new counter
[2:39:27.780 --> 2:39:35.300]  culture uh as well so we've got both these great coffee slash tea mugs available at infowarstore.com
[2:39:35.300 --> 2:39:41.140]  and we've got the new paul joseph watson t-shirt and when you purchase these
[2:39:41.700 --> 2:39:46.260]  it makes everything we're doing possible here so again it is a fight for free speech
[2:39:46.260 --> 2:39:50.500]  thank you for everything you do without you we would not be here info wars is an extension
[2:39:50.500 --> 2:39:56.180]  of your will against tyranny and the great crew that puts up with all my idiosyncratic behaviors
[2:39:57.060 --> 2:40:03.460]  understands that i am in the zeitgeist i am in the nuclear reactor let me tell you spiritually
[2:40:03.460 --> 2:40:09.540]  so uh and i'm not complaining i asked for this but uh it's it's it's it's very interesting i'll
[2:40:09.540 --> 2:40:15.300]  just leave it at that but it's better than me and a slave and so i wouldn't quit this for anything
[2:40:15.300 --> 2:40:24.260]  i just want victory now so much that it's all encompassing it's all controlling and i'm just
[2:40:24.260 --> 2:40:29.780]  begging you to keep doing what you're doing if you're your prayers i need your psychic support
[2:40:29.780 --> 2:40:35.940]  more than the monetary but everybody else needs the the the information there's a war
[2:40:35.940 --> 2:40:40.180]  they're pulling out heaven and earth to stop us it is such an act of resistance when you
[2:40:40.180 --> 2:40:45.060]  spread info wars.com articles or you spread our videos you spread a periscope video or a facebook
[2:40:45.060 --> 2:40:50.260]  video or a youtube video now let me end this now because millie i asked her to come here and host
[2:40:50.260 --> 2:40:53.460]  things maybe she'll go a little bit the next hour but i want her to be able to talk about what
[2:40:53.460 --> 2:40:58.500]  happened to her and what's happening and uh just what's unfolding but again thank you all for your
[2:40:58.500 --> 2:41:04.980]  support now back to uh millie weaver here live in studio i'm millie weaver and i will be taking
[2:41:04.980 --> 2:41:10.660]  you guys through the rest of this hour then at the bottom of the hour i will be joined by mike
[2:41:10.660 --> 2:41:17.860]  cernovich who will be taking you guys through that last final hour well the bike lock attacker has
[2:41:17.860 --> 2:41:25.700]  been arrested and charged with felony assault and this supposed attacker he himself was a former
[2:41:25.700 --> 2:41:33.460]  professor now this completely vindicates the report that i did the unmasking the antifa back a couple
[2:41:33.460 --> 2:41:40.820]  of months ago and it's pretty amazing to see how on forechan and poll how these internet slews
[2:41:40.820 --> 2:41:46.820]  actually tracked this person down and used some of that information about these professors that are
[2:41:46.820 --> 2:41:54.020]  bailing out antifa in order to identify this professor now i want to take you guys through
[2:41:54.020 --> 2:41:59.700]  this report but we'll get to that in a minute because there's some really interesting detailed
[2:41:59.700 --> 2:42:06.740]  information of just how bad it really and truly is where we have these universities that are that
[2:42:06.740 --> 2:42:14.740]  are completely dominated by liberal professors there are more marxist professors even at universities
[2:42:14.740 --> 2:42:20.900]  then there are liberal professors it's getting out of control it's pretty disturbing so i'm going to
[2:42:20.900 --> 2:42:27.380]  take you guys through this report we're going to be rolling it and it's pretty amazing the information
[2:42:27.380 --> 2:42:34.260]  here but before that i want to just say this professor's name is eric clanton and he was 28
[2:42:34.260 --> 2:42:42.820]  he was a former california state university professor of philosophy and this man who swung
[2:42:42.820 --> 2:42:50.020]  and hit somebody with a bike lock was a professor so let's go ahead and roll this clip guys so let's
[2:42:50.020 --> 2:42:57.940]  start where i started the local anti fascist group revolutionary student fronts facebook page
[2:42:58.660 --> 2:43:04.500]  the first post i noticed was that which discussed the recent march for trump and austin where a group
[2:43:04.500 --> 2:43:12.900]  of anti fascists went to in an attempt to shut it down which resulted in an anti fascist journalist
[2:43:12.900 --> 2:43:19.860]  kit o'connell's arrest they had a fundraiser page where they were asking for donations for their
[2:43:19.860 --> 2:43:27.620]  arrested comrade the money will go to support kits hospital bill replacement glasses missed work and
[2:43:27.620 --> 2:43:35.300]  other medical expenses as well as legal fees said the post they even raised two thousand dollars
[2:43:35.300 --> 2:43:44.420]  so my next question was who were these donors funding the anti fascists the donor page had names
[2:43:44.420 --> 2:43:52.660]  of the donors and their contributions so the next question to answer was who exactly were these people
[2:43:53.460 --> 2:44:01.220]  many were fellow college students but the most shocking finding of all was that some were professors
[2:44:01.220 --> 2:44:10.580]  yes university professors so why would a university professor be donating money to an arrested
[2:44:10.580 --> 2:44:18.420]  individual that's a member of the extremist group anti fascists that is known for rioting vandalism
[2:44:18.420 --> 2:44:26.660]  and attacking donald trump supporters now the trail led me to the universities in this article it
[2:44:26.660 --> 2:44:33.220]  talked about how students that took specific social justice studies received twenty eight hundred
[2:44:33.220 --> 2:44:41.300]  dollars in scholarships and they even gained special privileges which gained them access to use
[2:44:41.300 --> 2:44:49.940]  a special computer lab cameras and radio equipment why would universities be giving scholarships
[2:44:49.940 --> 2:44:57.620]  and special privileges to students that took social justice studies programs so the next logical
[2:44:57.620 --> 2:45:04.580]  thought was to look into these social justice programs and i decided the university of texas
[2:45:04.580 --> 2:45:12.740]  would be a good start i found the human rights and social justice program upon reading the program
[2:45:12.740 --> 2:45:20.100]  summary it seemed pretty mild although one sentence stuck out finally through the connecting
[2:45:20.100 --> 2:45:26.740]  experience component of the program students will have the opportunity to complement their
[2:45:26.740 --> 2:45:33.940]  coursework with hands-on experience in an organization working on human rights and social justice
[2:45:33.940 --> 2:45:42.020]  concerns then i found the link to the human rights and social justice faculty panel it had a long
[2:45:42.020 --> 2:45:49.060]  list of professors that each had a summary of their coursework expertise what began to become
[2:45:49.060 --> 2:45:55.540]  apparent upon simply reading their own description of what they taught is that these professors
[2:45:55.540 --> 2:46:02.500]  shared some pretty extreme left ideologies and with a simple youtube search you could find these
[2:46:02.500 --> 2:46:10.340]  professors giving lectures where you could hear their leftist extremist ideologies some even verging
[2:46:10.340 --> 2:46:17.620]  on marxism here i want to ask what may seem like a simple and even obvious question where does
[2:46:17.620 --> 2:46:25.540]  racism come from from what roots does racism arise and i think that question also a simple answer it
[2:46:25.540 --> 2:46:32.660]  comes from white supremacy the idea that non-white people are inherently inferior in intellectual
[2:46:32.660 --> 2:46:40.900]  or moral terms from white folks let me start with a clear statement on my own position on these two
[2:46:40.900 --> 2:46:49.140]  cults i'm speaking of first of all i am anti-capitalist without hesitation the sense of the word
[2:46:49.140 --> 2:46:54.100]  way i'm using this term cult what i'm really arguing is that capitalism can never be anything
[2:46:54.100 --> 2:47:01.780]  but a cult capitalism is not only not only a cult but essentially at this point quite clearly a
[2:47:01.780 --> 2:47:08.260]  kind of death cult the conclusions you would draw on crucial issues if you consulted god's word if
[2:47:08.260 --> 2:47:13.140]  you consulted the design of nature and what your senses and understanding of the world empirically
[2:47:13.140 --> 2:47:19.300]  could convey to you or if you step back and look as our founding fathers did at what kind of republican
[2:47:19.300 --> 2:47:27.140]  principles the basic opinions of mankind demanded that the law of god the law of nature and uh and
[2:47:27.140 --> 2:47:32.020]  the laws of republican government the the faria republican government were all aligned this all
[2:47:32.020 --> 2:47:39.700]  comes apart in the debate over slavery the conversions of them collapsed and even the
[2:47:39.700 --> 2:47:47.060]  sources of authority themselves became inherently incoherent i think you as teachers when you're
[2:47:47.060 --> 2:47:54.420]  teaching especially the expository literature of the civil war period can use these three
[2:47:55.060 --> 2:48:01.060]  sources of authority to sort of get your students inside some of these texts to ask them what are
[2:48:01.060 --> 2:48:10.660]  these writers basing their uh arguments on then i looked at kvrx the austin ut college radio station
[2:48:10.660 --> 2:48:17.860]  and lo and behold the students running the radio were affiliating without spoken antifa members
[2:48:18.580 --> 2:48:25.540]  i even came across a uc berkeley college radio interview with a professor it's important to
[2:48:25.540 --> 2:48:32.820]  know that the interview is about a book that this professor published about fascism just before the
[2:48:32.820 --> 2:48:43.060]  uc berkeley riots broke out where anti-fascist shut down a mylo-unopolis event trump became sort of
[2:48:43.060 --> 2:48:52.340]  leader of the wingnut tea party branch of berthard and from there he gained a significant right-wing
[2:48:52.340 --> 2:49:03.060]  reactionary following which he was able to parlay into his presidential bid and through that
[2:49:03.060 --> 2:49:12.420]  campaign he became kind of a figurehead for a lot of nazis and traditionalists and old schools
[2:49:12.420 --> 2:49:21.300]  southern neo-confederates and so it was through that coalition if you will of fascists that
[2:49:21.300 --> 2:49:29.300]  trump was able to really compete for presidency and eventually win more recently warnings of a
[2:49:29.300 --> 2:49:36.340]  creeping fascism have returned i don't know who's doing that um if we consider the left's embrace
[2:49:36.340 --> 2:49:43.460]  of equality as its defining characteristic fascism remains decisively on the right obviously he needs
[2:49:43.460 --> 2:49:49.780]  to be opposed on every level and obviously he's um he's not only benefiting from the rise of fascism
[2:49:49.780 --> 2:49:55.460]  he's facilitating it can we make the call that the alt right is fascist yeah absolutely that is a
[2:49:55.460 --> 2:50:02.020]  fascist movement and it has to be opposed physically and ideologically and this professor talked about
[2:50:02.020 --> 2:50:09.220]  alex jones and in so misrepresented alex's political beliefs in order to create a false
[2:50:09.220 --> 2:50:16.580]  dichotomy what they did along with like alex jones and people like that is create this alt
[2:50:16.580 --> 2:50:24.100]  universe where globalization was a creation of the left globalization was the economic
[2:50:24.100 --> 2:50:30.180]  expression of an ideology that they referred to as globalism which is created by cultural
[2:50:30.180 --> 2:50:36.900]  marxists and jews who are trying to deracinate the people of europe and white people in the united
[2:50:36.900 --> 2:50:44.100]  states what can be drawn from this interview is that we have a few professors that are trying to
[2:50:44.100 --> 2:50:50.980]  rewrite history in order to falsely associate fascism with donald trump and his supporters

[2:54:39.460 --> 2:54:45.700]  to watch the entire video report of that i mean it really goes down deep into what's going on at
[2:54:45.700 --> 2:54:51.780]  these universities now it is pretty hard to even believe that there would be liberal professors
[2:54:51.780 --> 2:54:58.020]  and marxist professors out there indoctrinating the youth but when you go to these antifa rallies
[2:54:58.020 --> 2:55:03.380]  where they have these writers and and they're you know coming there to beat trump supporters
[2:55:03.380 --> 2:55:09.460]  it becomes pretty evident when you see that the vast majority of these antifa there are young
[2:55:09.460 --> 2:55:15.540]  college aged people and then they tend to have older people there who i mean it becomes pretty
[2:55:15.540 --> 2:55:21.540]  obvious who these older people are i mean they're university professors and it just reminds me of this
[2:55:21.540 --> 2:55:28.420]  case where we saw that girl moldy locks the girl who was punched in the face at this the
[2:55:28.420 --> 2:55:34.100]  berkeley protest but you know she came there looking for a fight and she had made posts about it
[2:55:34.100 --> 2:55:40.580]  so this girl moldy locks i mean she was a beautiful young lady uh looked like your you know daddy's
[2:55:40.580 --> 2:55:48.180]  princess how does daddy's princess turn into the devil's mistress well she's being sent to these
[2:55:48.180 --> 2:55:55.380]  liberal universities where even in california some of these universities have started you know
[2:55:55.380 --> 2:56:02.340]  dismantling their libraries and essentially turning them into digital virgin versions which
[2:56:02.340 --> 2:56:08.900]  you know that does not sound like a good idea when you have this monopoly on speech at these
[2:56:08.900 --> 2:56:14.340]  universities and it tends to be coming from the liberal side you know not too long ago i spoke
[2:56:14.340 --> 2:56:21.220]  with a man named professor ellis who is a black law professor and had the most amazing credentials
[2:56:21.220 --> 2:56:27.540]  you could ever see he was so qualified but he would go and interview at these universities
[2:56:27.540 --> 2:56:32.900]  and they would turn him down no they did not turn him down because of the color of his skin they
[2:56:32.900 --> 2:56:40.180]  turned him down because he was ideologically different from them he was a conservative and so
[2:56:40.180 --> 2:56:47.380]  they actually were discriminating him based on his ideology so he actually made a manifesto
[2:56:47.380 --> 2:56:54.900]  called ideological racism within universities about how these universities are only hiring
[2:56:54.900 --> 2:57:01.620]  liberal teachers you know there's a problem when these liberal universities you know these liberal
[2:57:01.620 --> 2:57:08.420]  professors outnumber conservative professors 12 to 1 so people are sending their kids there
[2:57:08.420 --> 2:57:15.380]  not realizing that these professors are very extreme leftists a lot of them are marxists
[2:57:16.260 --> 2:57:22.420]  12 percent or six 12 between 12 and 16 percent were considered to be marxist professors so it's
[2:57:22.420 --> 2:57:29.700]  no wonder that young people young millennials and generation z are more likely to view communism
[2:57:29.700 --> 2:57:36.900]  and socialism in a favorable light now they had studies that came out and these were from the
[2:57:36.900 --> 2:57:43.860]  communist memorial foundations you know victims of communism who had done these these studies these
[2:57:43.860 --> 2:57:50.740]  surveys and they found that overwhelmingly millennials and generation z had a favorable
[2:57:50.740 --> 2:57:58.100]  view of communism and of socialism and they greatly underestimated the number of deaths
[2:57:58.100 --> 2:58:06.100]  that can be attributed to communism it's pretty disturbing and so now justice has prevailed
[2:58:06.100 --> 2:58:13.300]  this bike lock attacker is being charged two felony accounts he could be facing a lot of jail
[2:58:13.300 --> 2:58:19.540]  time but this really should not be surprising when you know you go out and decide you're
[2:58:19.540 --> 2:58:24.180]  going to whack somebody over the head with a bike lock this is what can be expected and
[2:58:24.180 --> 2:58:29.060]  anything else would just be being oblivious to the fact that you're going to get caught you're
[2:58:29.060 --> 2:58:35.060]  going to go to jail if you try to go out and attack people that are exercising their right

[3:00:07.140 --> 3:00:24.980]  i'm millie weaver joined here by mike cernovich and we're going to be talking about professors
[3:00:24.980 --> 3:00:30.660]  and how some of these professors are even under threat at these universities i mean
[3:00:30.660 --> 3:00:36.420]  these sjw's are so hysterical if they catch any bit of wind that these professors don't
[3:00:36.420 --> 3:00:42.420]  share their exact same beliefs well you know they're going to do anything they can to run
[3:00:42.420 --> 3:00:49.060]  these professors off so um i wanted to go ahead and talk to mike cernovich so hello mike how are
[3:00:49.060 --> 3:00:53.780]  you doing today hey great always great to see you millie yeah what i think is hilarious is
[3:00:53.780 --> 3:00:59.620]  they're liberal professors who are now actually getting that jackfruit on their throat that all
[3:00:59.620 --> 3:01:05.060]  of us have felt for all of these years it isn't enough to go after right wingers or conservatives
[3:01:05.060 --> 3:01:12.500]  or centrists the professor actually is a leftist he's a he's an avowed anti-racist and even he
[3:01:13.060 --> 3:01:20.660]  is feeling the wrath of the mob wow i mean that's pretty alarming when you have the mob rule mentality
[3:01:20.660 --> 3:01:27.140]  where they think that they can just bully and use aggression to essentially scare people off like we
[3:01:27.140 --> 3:01:34.900]  have seen with an colter yeah and what they got before was interesting there was a apparently a
[3:01:34.900 --> 3:01:40.420]  holiday i don't know if we called a holiday or an event what people want to call it but it was white
[3:01:40.420 --> 3:01:45.460]  people were told to stay off a campus by the administration you can't make this kind of stuff
[3:01:45.460 --> 3:01:52.260]  up the email has actually been leaked and the the producers back there have the emails where
[3:01:52.260 --> 3:01:59.060]  they said white people cannot come to campus today as a way of honoring people of color so this
[3:01:59.060 --> 3:02:03.700]  professor Weinstein said wait wait wait wait a minute he thought he misunderstood what he was
[3:02:03.700 --> 3:02:11.060]  reading he said if white people want to voluntarily remain off campus for a day as a show of solidarity
[3:02:11.060 --> 3:02:16.260]  with people of color hey that's great for them but if the administration is telling white people
[3:02:16.260 --> 3:02:23.060]  they're not welcome that is actually racism that is actually oppression that's what got him in trouble
[3:02:23.060 --> 3:02:29.060]  is he stood up against the idea that white people should be barred from campus for one day and that
[3:02:29.060 --> 3:02:35.620]  set the the outrage mob the issue of the outrage mob out of control now what gets really worse
[3:02:36.660 --> 3:02:42.260]  is he has been advised by the police department breaking news today he cannot come on campus he
[3:02:42.260 --> 3:02:48.820]  and his wife are both in physical danger the violence from the left but god help anybody on
[3:02:48.820 --> 3:02:53.700]  you know this is something wow yeah because you know millie you've covered these left-wing groups
[3:02:53.700 --> 3:02:59.860]  you've been at trump rallies in your experience who is the first to be violent people on the right
[3:02:59.860 --> 3:03:05.540]  or in the middle or people on the it is without a doubt always the people with the antifa the people
[3:03:05.540 --> 3:03:11.620]  on the left they get hysterical and they can't control themselves they're emotionally volatile so
[3:03:11.620 --> 3:03:16.740]  they lash out and it doesn't surprise me that we're seeing the campus then say oh well you have to
[3:03:16.740 --> 3:03:22.340]  stay off campus for your own safety because we're afraid of these people coming and hurting you
[3:03:22.340 --> 3:03:30.340]  that's the exact same line or jargon that we heard with ann colter and how the campus cancelled her
[3:03:30.340 --> 3:03:37.060]  speech yeah that's actually a justification is the way they censor us is it's illegal and
[3:03:37.060 --> 3:03:42.340]  unconstitutional to say that we can't come on to a state university and they say oh well you're
[3:03:42.340 --> 3:03:47.860]  in danger so you can't come to campus and even if we say we still want to go they'll say no no no
[3:03:47.860 --> 3:03:53.940]  you can't but they never actually arrest any of the wrongdoers who are criminals so for example
[3:03:53.940 --> 3:03:59.460]  this um what was his name canter he was the berkeley bike lock professor he took a a bike
[3:03:59.460 --> 3:04:06.580]  eric canton yeah so he actually got arrested but not for what he did at berkeley he got arrested
[3:04:06.580 --> 3:04:11.540]  for something else he's such a dodgy character he apparently had a gun he was committing a felony in
[3:04:11.540 --> 3:04:17.860]  it and we're still investigating that story these are the kind of people yeah exactly two felony
[3:04:17.860 --> 3:04:23.300]  charges so he's an antifa guy but he wasn't arrested for what he did at berkeley to my
[3:04:23.300 --> 3:04:28.660]  understanding maybe that's changed in his breaking news he was arrested for completely unrelated
[3:04:28.660 --> 3:04:34.180]  crimes these people on the left are violent criminals it can't be denied anymore these people
[3:04:34.180 --> 3:04:38.260]  are scary people so uh we're going to leave here in a minute but what's your take i mean you live
[3:04:38.260 --> 3:04:42.580]  and breathe with these people for a long time should people be worried about them i think that
[3:04:42.580 --> 3:04:46.660]  people should be worried about the censorship and the indoctrination that we're seeing at
[3:04:46.660 --> 3:04:52.420]  universities that should be the number one concern without a doubt well stay tuned guys because
[3:04:52.420 --> 3:04:56.900]  mike sternovich is going to be carrying you guys through this last and final hour and i will be
[3:04:56.900 --> 3:05:05.220]  saying goodbye to you guys us a a the financial services company which caters to military members

[3:08:18.100 --> 3:08:25.540]  a lot of news going on today it has been a wild day so the question i guess on everybody's mind
[3:08:25.540 --> 3:08:33.940]  is is it okay to punch a journalist and you know we just about political violence i do not support
[3:08:33.940 --> 3:08:38.420]  violence against people you don't agree with i certainly know that mr jones and the info wars
[3:08:38.420 --> 3:08:45.940]  people we believe in free speech we try to debate people but whenever we try to hold a debate or
[3:08:45.940 --> 3:08:51.620]  talk or have a civil discussion millie weaver has done a great job on that oh and has done a great
[3:08:51.620 --> 3:08:56.020]  job on that there's been so much great coverage info wars about the violence coming from the left
[3:08:56.020 --> 3:09:04.500]  end of tifa whenever we try to have an event left wing thugs and savages and then tifa come in
[3:09:05.220 --> 3:09:11.460]  crash it they attack us they pepper spray people they hit women they smash people with two by four
[3:09:11.460 --> 3:09:18.580]  is a baseball pass the media has said hey we don't care man because everybody that is to the right of
[3:09:18.580 --> 3:09:25.300]  car marks is a nazi and they've even said it's okay to punch a nazi this is what they've been saying
[3:09:25.300 --> 3:09:31.620]  the media has normalized political violence and i warned people in the media because i don't hate
[3:09:31.620 --> 3:09:36.340]  every journalist actually i think there is about 10 percent of journalists who really want to do the
[3:09:36.340 --> 3:09:41.140]  right thing and then the other 90 percent are the who given those 10 percent of bad name
[3:09:41.140 --> 3:09:48.660]  and but i've warned people i said look if you normalize political violence then the issue
[3:09:48.660 --> 3:09:55.300]  is going to be who can do it better who can be more violent you guys should probably say something
[3:09:55.300 --> 3:10:02.580]  about this as a matter of fact i went into the white house press briefing room and i confronted
[3:10:02.580 --> 3:10:08.180]  the entire white house press corps and i said why will no one in the media disavow political
[3:10:08.180 --> 3:10:14.980]  violence on the left why will you not disavow in tifa the violence had gotten so bad that a fellow
[3:10:14.980 --> 3:10:20.660]  by the name of base thick man had to go in to protect people who wanted to have free speech
[3:10:20.660 --> 3:10:25.780]  there was a fight i actually wrote about this there was a fight that had broken out in an open
[3:10:25.780 --> 3:10:32.420]  field in berkeley because in tifa would come in just exactly in tifa would come in and then people
[3:10:32.420 --> 3:10:37.540]  on the right had to come in too and it became like a full on civil war in the fields of berkeley
[3:10:37.540 --> 3:10:42.980]  and i said i really want the media to speak out against this i really want people on the left
[3:10:42.980 --> 3:10:48.820]  to say you know what you're right the violence has been going on to trump supporters the violence
[3:10:48.820 --> 3:10:53.380]  has been happening to people on the right this has gone on for too long we need to do a special on
[3:10:53.380 --> 3:10:58.980]  it we need to disavow this we need to end this the media loves it though it when when a trump
[3:10:58.980 --> 3:11:05.220]  supporter is attacked the media embraces it and in fact they do inspire and incite violence against
[3:11:05.220 --> 3:11:11.060]  trump supporters by calling us all nazis so what the media had done is twofold they go well
[3:11:12.020 --> 3:11:18.420]  is it okay to punch a nazi is it okay to punch a nazi now most people would say well sure because
[3:11:18.420 --> 3:11:23.780]  you have this idea of a nazi is a terrible person from world war two and in fact they were terrible
[3:11:23.780 --> 3:11:29.860]  people but the trick the media played was then they defined everybody as a nazi anybody that
[3:11:29.860 --> 3:11:35.700]  doesn't follow mainstream orthodoxy anybody doing real news is a nazi and they kind of snuck that
[3:11:35.700 --> 3:11:40.500]  one in there but i warned people i said once you start telling people it's okay to punch
[3:11:41.460 --> 3:11:47.700]  those you disagree with then the media people are going to get punched and i warned them i warned
[3:11:47.700 --> 3:11:54.180]  people i said guys let's do a debate i'd offered a hundred thousand dollars to charity if keith
[3:11:54.180 --> 3:12:00.980]  oberman would debate real alex jones this is how hungry we are those of us who are moderates people
[3:12:00.980 --> 3:12:06.740]  like me and for wars we're actually political moderates compared to the far left that you can't
[3:12:06.740 --> 3:12:11.140]  even call us right wingers anymore we are all moderate people because the far left they want
[3:12:11.140 --> 3:12:16.100]  to take away everybody's guns they want to enslave people they want open borders they want terrorism
[3:12:16.100 --> 3:12:22.180]  everywhere so i said i will donate a hundred thousand dollars to charity if keith oberman
[3:12:22.180 --> 3:12:28.660]  will debate real alex jones in an open forum with a moderator a neutral moderator alex jones was
[3:12:28.660 --> 3:12:35.300]  of course fully on board he wanted to do the debate so you got money for charity a hundred thousand
[3:12:35.300 --> 3:12:41.060]  dollars for charity open debate they won't debate us in an open field though because they cannot win
[3:12:41.060 --> 3:12:47.780]  the war of ideas the only way they can defeat us is by blacklisting us by censoring us by attacking
[3:12:47.780 --> 3:12:53.380]  our advertisers by delegitimizing people by lying about people by spreading fake news about people
[3:12:54.580 --> 3:13:03.300]  so again this is all leading to what happened in montana so a candidate for congress put his hands
[3:13:03.300 --> 3:13:12.580]  on a reporter and you know what happened the media freaked out but i said i go you know what
[3:13:12.580 --> 3:13:19.940]  that won't cost him even one vote and in fact not only did it not cost him a vote he raised a hundred
[3:13:19.940 --> 3:13:27.300]  thousand dollars in 24 hours people were glad that he punched the media he raised a hundred
[3:13:27.300 --> 3:13:32.340]  thousand dollars and 24 hours in campaign contributions people actually said they came
[3:13:32.340 --> 3:13:39.060]  out to vote for him not in spite of him putting his hands on a fake news journalist but because of it
[3:13:39.060 --> 3:13:45.140]  you would think this would be a wake-up call you would think the media would say we are done
[3:13:45.700 --> 3:13:51.060]  with the violence we are sorry we apologize for inciting violence against Trump supporters
[3:13:51.060 --> 3:13:57.780]  we apologize for saying it is okay to hit people you don't agree with we are we were wrong and we're
[3:13:57.780 --> 3:14:03.940]  now going to do an expose on antifa and the political violence coming from the left that
[3:14:03.940 --> 3:14:10.340]  is happening to people on the right but of course not of course not humorous or as the bible says
[3:14:10.340 --> 3:14:17.940]  as a good book says pride cometh before a fall pride cometh before a fall the media is too proud
[3:14:17.940 --> 3:14:23.780]  to admit hey maybe we contributed this cultural violence maybe this is our fault maybe we need
[3:14:23.780 --> 3:14:30.260]  to ratchet down the rhetoric maybe we need to stop dehumanizing people maybe we need to stop calling
[3:14:30.260 --> 3:14:36.900]  everybody nazis maybe we need to stop lying about people maybe we need to cover the violence that
[3:14:36.900 --> 3:14:42.900]  is happening to trump supporters maybe a little bit of humility no they're doubling down this proves
[3:14:42.900 --> 3:14:48.420]  that trump is a bad guy his people are fascist and that this is an assault on the free press
[3:14:48.420 --> 3:14:52.260]  they're doubling down on that narrative rather than showing the little contrition
[3:14:53.300 --> 3:14:59.540]  and a little bit of self-awareness so i predicted over a year ago that political
[3:14:59.540 --> 3:15:04.500]  violence would become normalized it would become more common and i predicted that people on the
[3:15:04.500 --> 3:15:10.020]  right would do it better than people on the left and that is another point that is being
[3:15:10.020 --> 3:15:14.900]  messed by the media this is a point being missed this is not a threat because i don't want i want
[3:15:14.900 --> 3:15:21.860]  to debate again show me anybody on the left who has ever offered a hundred thousand dollars for
[3:15:21.860 --> 3:15:28.100]  charity to debate me alex shown's big name we could raise a lot of money for charity we could
[3:15:28.100 --> 3:15:32.820]  live stream it have a super chat go and contract i bet you we could raise a million dollars if we
[3:15:32.820 --> 3:15:38.740]  had a big like a wrestlemania wow this is a great idea i wish i was here right now we could just
[3:15:38.740 --> 3:15:46.260]  brainstorm off each other i envision a a major like a major ufc event a major boxing match
[3:15:46.260 --> 3:15:54.340]  promoted by cnn co-co promoted by info wars maybe get bright for our daily call or cernovich media
[3:15:54.340 --> 3:15:59.460]  get all of us in a room and we could have like an undercard lean to a main event
[3:15:59.460 --> 3:16:08.180]  so the left they could have keith oberman bill mire sam harris jake taper brian selter all
[3:16:08.180 --> 3:16:13.380]  these guys on the left could come in like a big battle royal and then we could have people on
[3:16:13.380 --> 3:16:22.420]  the right alex jones paul joseph watson milley cernovich stefan malin you we could have you know
[3:16:22.420 --> 3:16:26.980]  we could have five ten people on each side and then it would all lead up god this would be
[3:16:26.980 --> 3:16:31.300]  where is alex right now when you need him this would be an amazing amazing event we could cut
[3:16:31.300 --> 3:16:36.340]  up a promo for it i bet you we do a million for charity i would put up a hundred thousand of my
[3:16:36.340 --> 3:16:41.300]  own money from cernovich media i would put up a hundred thousand dollars to see this event happen
[3:16:41.300 --> 3:16:48.260]  for charity it would be the battle royale the left versus the right who has the better ideas
[3:16:48.260 --> 3:16:55.460]  who can engage in free speech with the most tenacity the most ferocity who has the better
[3:16:55.460 --> 3:17:00.820]  arguments who's more logical who's more cogent we would millions of people would watch this we
[3:17:00.820 --> 3:17:10.580]  could air it on every network air live on cnn air live on nbc abc fox news msnbc air live on
[3:17:10.580 --> 3:17:17.460]  everybody's social media on everybody's youtube crowdfund donations live streaming had all money
[3:17:17.460 --> 3:17:24.180]  would go to charity why isn't this happening we could raise at least a million dollars for charity
[3:17:25.620 --> 3:17:30.900]  well i'll tell you why i'll tell you why they can't be decent in argument they can't win that's
[3:17:30.900 --> 3:17:37.220]  why they won't show up and debate us that is why they the media sends their little nazi soldiers
[3:17:37.220 --> 3:17:42.660]  a little antifa thugs to come and disrupt our events because if they actually met with us
[3:17:42.660 --> 3:17:48.260]  one-on-one and raised millions of dollars for charity they would be trounced because the left
[3:17:48.260 --> 3:17:52.900]  is intellectually morally and spiritually bankrupt the left are the architects of terrorists
[3:17:53.940 --> 3:17:59.220]  they create it they want terrorism against us that's why they'll never debate us instead what
[3:17:59.220 --> 3:18:04.180]  do they want to do well they want to get shawna handi's advertisers pulled they're right they
[3:18:04.180 --> 3:18:09.540]  write hit pieces every time every time alex and i do a show together george seros pays people to
[3:18:09.540 --> 3:18:14.180]  monitor it and you know i think it's a great service by the way i don't mean for i think it's
[3:18:14.180 --> 3:18:20.900]  hilarious that george seros that's a dream job think about that the job that george seros pays
[3:18:20.900 --> 3:18:28.020]  people do is to watch everything that we do download the videos and transcribe it and then
[3:18:28.020 --> 3:18:34.020]  write articles about it that is a dream how could i can i have that job can i get paid to watch
[3:18:34.020 --> 3:18:38.500]  info wars dot com and to transcribe what i'm reading to write about these articles on these
[3:18:38.500 --> 3:18:43.460]  amazing people on the right who are doing real journalism and actually standing up to power
[3:18:43.460 --> 3:18:49.460]  elite in the deep state that would be a dream job to me why can't i need to apply for george seros
[3:18:49.460 --> 3:18:55.380]  if you're watching i know you are david brock i know you guys are watching hit me up maybe you
[3:18:55.380 --> 3:18:59.780]  know maybe we can have a win-win i'll tell you in advance what i'm going to do and then you can
[3:18:59.780 --> 3:19:05.220]  donate my salary to charity but again they don't want to open debate they want to just same thing
[3:19:05.220 --> 3:19:09.860]  they're going after shawna haney's advertisers they want to get us kicked off of youtube they want
[3:19:09.860 --> 3:19:16.660]  to get us kicked off of social media they can't win in open debate and of course that is why you

[3:24:12.020 --> 3:24:19.540]  Gervits just hosting the fourth hour for real Alex Jones and today again like Alex will tell you
[3:24:19.540 --> 3:24:26.260]  we're not bragging we just want to let you know where you can find the real news let's do a fly
[3:24:26.260 --> 3:24:34.100]  back to lead up to this amazing video climax and spectacular even though comically I do not wish
[3:24:34.660 --> 3:24:40.020]  poor health on anyone I do not wish Parkinson's disease on Hillary Clinton or anyone that is very
[3:24:40.020 --> 3:24:46.740]  very bad so that is bad energy I don't wish an honor but let's do a flashback I believe the
[3:24:46.740 --> 3:24:54.100]  article was published by the Washington Post September 6th 2016 can we just stop talking
[3:24:54.100 --> 3:25:00.660]  about Hillary Clinton's health now so as you know the Alex Jones show info warriors had been
[3:25:00.660 --> 3:25:06.820]  receiving legitimate sources of information who said that Hillary Clinton's health had been so bad
[3:25:06.820 --> 3:25:12.980]  that the Secret Service had a step stool put up for her in the van so Alex and his people were
[3:25:12.980 --> 3:25:19.380]  getting this kind of intel I was too they had said her actually she has a step stool going on
[3:25:19.380 --> 3:25:24.340]  to get into the the big SUV or whatever you call the big suburban and then what they would they would
[3:25:24.340 --> 3:25:30.340]  start to do is rather than have Hillary Clinton enter and exit the vehicle facing the camera
[3:25:30.340 --> 3:25:36.660]  she would walk behind a car and get in that way where cameras around the site so we kept hearing
[3:25:36.660 --> 3:25:43.140]  that something was really wrong and we began to talk about her health she would have coffee
[3:25:43.140 --> 3:25:48.340]  fits the media would call them allergies and then we would go and fact check the media and say well
[3:25:48.340 --> 3:25:56.340]  wait a minute when she gave that talk she actually was having no allergies there was no pollen
[3:25:56.340 --> 3:26:01.220]  there was no ragweed there were no allergies in the air so when you would actually fact check the
[3:26:01.220 --> 3:26:08.100]  media you would find out there were no allergies it was made allergen safe so I kept pushing that
[3:26:08.100 --> 3:26:15.780]  story hard Paul Joseph Watson pushed it hard Alex Jones all the info wars team pushed it hard
[3:26:15.780 --> 3:26:22.100]  we were called fake news oh my god you're fake news they wrote about me to this day when they write
[3:26:22.100 --> 3:26:26.740]  about me and they want to try to attack me they say my service has spread conspiracy theories
[3:26:26.740 --> 3:26:33.860]  about Hillary Clinton's help they can't quit talking about it so on september 6 2016 the
[3:26:33.860 --> 3:26:37.060]  washington post and all the fake news media said you're not allowed to talk to her health
[3:26:37.940 --> 3:26:43.620]  and then of course we had that fateful day where a hero citizen journalist captured Hillary Clinton
[3:26:43.620 --> 3:26:50.900]  having a seizure as she was walking into her SUV so why are we talking about this now info
[3:26:50.900 --> 3:26:57.380]  war is vindicated because today and they're gonna have that clip ready for you today Hillary Clinton
[3:26:57.380 --> 3:27:03.460]  why giving a graduation speech had another coughing fit so let's go ahead and watch that clip if we
[3:27:03.460 --> 3:27:15.060]  have it you know four years ago maybe a little more or less for some of you man i've got to get a
[3:27:15.060 --> 3:27:35.860]  losange i told the trustees i was sitting with after hearing Tala's speech i didn't think i could
[3:27:35.860 --> 3:27:46.580]  get through it so we'll blame allergy instead of emotion but you know you arrived at this campus
[3:27:55.460 --> 3:28:02.020]  you you arrived from all over you joined students from 49 states and 58 countries
[3:28:02.020 --> 3:28:12.020]  now maybe you felt like you belong there you go i've been vindicated again now again i don't
[3:28:12.020 --> 3:28:16.580]  wish and i know a lot of people would disagree because people believe well she does belong
[3:28:16.580 --> 3:28:22.180]  in prison it isn't people believing it she does belong in prison she's a criminal she is the most
[3:28:22.180 --> 3:28:28.740]  wanted trader in american history worse than benedict on but that said she does have Parkinson's
[3:28:28.740 --> 3:28:35.060]  or some kind of condition so what medical experts will tell you about Parkinson's is people think
[3:28:35.060 --> 3:28:41.140]  of Parkinson's very stereotypically they understand the tremors that people have but they don't
[3:28:41.140 --> 3:28:46.900]  understand too that neurologically it affects your throat so your throat will actually close up
[3:28:46.900 --> 3:28:52.020]  when you're a Parkinson's patient so very sad condition that is again why i do believe Hillary
[3:28:52.020 --> 3:28:56.820]  Clinton belongs in prison but medically i don't wish this on anybody because it is horrific and
[3:28:56.820 --> 3:29:02.260]  i know people who have suffered and you never want to wish a serious medical condition on anybody
[3:29:02.260 --> 3:29:07.220]  that's not it's not good god doesn't approve that nobody should want to do that i'm just telling
[3:29:07.220 --> 3:29:12.020]  you the facts i'm not gloating about it so what happens is neurologically your throat starts to
[3:29:12.020 --> 3:29:18.660]  close up and then you can only drink special water that has a higher viscosity otherwise you can choke
[3:29:18.660 --> 3:29:23.940]  on water so that's why Hillary Clinton can't even drink water out of an normal water bottle
[3:29:23.940 --> 3:29:31.460]  so what's the message here the real news who had this health story first info wars.com did
[3:29:31.460 --> 3:29:36.980]  Mike Sermish did Paul Joseph Watson did we had it on the internet the media actually told us we
[3:29:36.980 --> 3:29:42.500]  couldn't talk about it this is why you cannot listen to the fake news media when they tell us
[3:29:42.500 --> 3:29:51.620]  they can't talk about something they know that it's true we're on the march the empires on the run
[3:29:51.620 --> 3:29:55.300]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:30:00.020 --> 3:30:06.820]  USAA the financial services company which caters to military members and their families is the
[3:30:06.820 --> 3:30:12.900]  latest company to pull their advertising from Sean Hannity's show following a string of ad

[3:30:32.820 --> 3:30:39.620]  campaign against him after they released a list of companies that advertised during Hannity's show
[3:30:39.620 --> 3:30:46.740]  prominent twitter icon Mark Dice then went to twitter and said USAA your boycotting Hannity to

[3:34:33.860 --> 3:34:38.900]  christianity you can't make this stuff up there's a new video out there a new video game out there
[3:34:38.900 --> 3:34:43.780]  called far cry five and we're going to let off the clip here in a minute where what they want to do
[3:34:43.780 --> 3:34:51.140]  is attack christians as being some kind of cultists as being some kind of members and the promo trailer
[3:34:51.140 --> 3:34:58.180]  they make everybody the whole plot of the game is that christians have taken over in montana
[3:34:58.180 --> 3:35:03.780]  these bad evil christians if you're a christian you're probably in a cult you're killing people
[3:35:03.780 --> 3:35:09.860]  they show people at a table with wolves and knives and they have a guy tied up the whole attack
[3:35:10.500 --> 3:35:16.180]  on christianity and christians in america is coming from every level the mainstream media
[3:35:16.180 --> 3:35:34.660]  hollywood and now for video games so let's go ahead and watch this clip and then we'll talk about it
[3:35:46.500 --> 3:35:50.660]  you
[3:36:00.660 --> 3:36:06.740]  you hear that right amazing grace playing in the background peaceful music the video game world
[3:36:06.740 --> 3:36:11.380]  and the video game industry is controlled by the far left by the social justice lawyers
[3:36:11.380 --> 3:36:19.220]  they are now directly attacking christians i don't see christians going into concerts where
[3:36:19.220 --> 3:36:24.900]  little girls are and blowing things up i don't see christians committing terrorist acts i
[3:36:24.900 --> 3:36:30.820]  don't see christians and christianity endorsing terrorism i don't see christians trying to impose
[3:36:31.540 --> 3:36:37.620]  their hardcore christian laws on other people but that is what is actually happening so that
[3:36:37.620 --> 3:36:42.260]  is what the media is trying to say is true about christians and christianity even in the video game
[3:36:42.260 --> 3:36:49.140]  world but let's compare these leaflets that we're seeing outside of a mosque let's see what is actually
[3:36:49.140 --> 3:36:54.740]  going on in the real world because again i respect everybody's religion i believe religion is a good
[3:36:54.740 --> 3:37:01.220]  thing for people judaism christianity there are many good muslims out there i don't like this
[3:37:01.220 --> 3:37:07.460]  divisiveness about everybody's religion if people practice it peacefully and if they control the
[3:37:07.460 --> 3:37:13.620]  violent people but as journalists we do have to tell the truth and the truth is that far cry five
[3:37:13.620 --> 3:37:19.620]  video is propaganda from the left is pro George Soros probably backed that probably funded by
[3:37:19.620 --> 3:37:25.540]  soros and the media matters pipes they're probably funding that kind of propaganda that isn't the
[3:37:25.540 --> 3:37:30.660]  reality though christians are not doing this kind of stuff now let's look at these leaflets that we
[3:37:30.660 --> 3:37:37.940]  find in a mosque let's compare this is direct from didgeridoo mosque this is a leaflet that i was
[3:37:37.940 --> 3:37:44.420]  given on an open day and this says living in a society in which people have accepted western
[3:37:44.420 --> 3:37:52.260]  lifestyle as their way of life brings immorality at every step modesty shame and honor have no
[3:37:52.260 --> 3:37:59.060]  place in western civilization that is direct from didgeridoo mosque all right and that was given
[3:37:59.060 --> 3:38:05.620]  in a very expensive package with dvds all i can say is i have been an attendee of didgeridoo mosque
[3:38:05.620 --> 3:38:12.900]  for 30 years or so and didgeridoo mosque is a is a is a mosque that opens its doors to non-muslims
[3:38:12.900 --> 3:38:18.900]  every week on a sunday it's a very multicultural community it's it's a it's a mosque that invites
[3:38:18.900 --> 3:38:24.500]  women in men in people of all faiths and all nationalities and where that where that's come
[3:38:24.500 --> 3:38:30.180]  from i don't know that's absolutely correct and that was given to me on a sunday on an open day
[3:38:32.180 --> 3:38:36.580]  tm biscuits very very nice yeah all right very very nice people it's not an official i have
[3:38:36.580 --> 3:38:45.940]  i have also i think two lines taken out of context about didgeridoo mosque is unfair all right
[3:38:45.940 --> 3:38:51.380]  how is that out of context hold on how is talking about british well we need civilization yes
[3:38:51.380 --> 3:38:56.020]  you may have context well we don't know who handed it to you or who wrote it that's the point
[3:38:58.900 --> 3:39:03.620]  i know but it's a charity leaflet that's given out officially from didgeridoo mosque all right
[3:39:03.620 --> 3:39:09.460]  you made the point thank you all right what more do you want so this kind of stuff and this is why
[3:39:09.460 --> 3:39:15.780]  the media divides people this kind of stuff to me is very conflicting for me because i do know
[3:39:15.780 --> 3:39:21.780]  very very very many muslims who are opposed to this stuff and they have spoken out about it and they
[3:39:21.780 --> 3:39:28.900]  think it's gone completely crazy but there's a large segment of muslims who do endorse terrorism
[3:39:28.900 --> 3:39:34.980]  they don't say anything they don't report on the people who are radicalized you can't get the
[3:39:34.980 --> 3:39:41.460]  truth about islam and muslims so for example that woman who said that the mosque is open on sunday
[3:39:41.460 --> 3:39:48.420]  and women are welcome are women allowed to be with the men though famously there was a trudeau
[3:39:49.220 --> 3:39:53.780]  the canadian prime minister trudeau who claims he's a feminist and is really against the patriarchy
[3:39:53.780 --> 3:39:57.940]  and we really have to do something about these oppressive white christians there's a great picture
[3:39:57.940 --> 3:40:05.460]  of how trudeau went to a mosque in canada and his female staffers had to go into a separate entrance
[3:40:05.460 --> 3:40:12.580]  and they weren't allowed to sit with the men they were segregated by gender it isn't christians who
[3:40:12.580 --> 3:40:17.700]  are doing this gender segregation so on the one hand you have people like trudeau you have all
[3:40:17.700 --> 3:40:23.700]  these university professors you have all these media people and they claim look at these lunatic
[3:40:23.700 --> 3:40:28.260]  christians i mean that really is what that far cry thing is look at these lunatic christians
[3:40:28.260 --> 3:40:34.500]  can you imagine the outrage if there is a big video game about mos terrorists and mosques
[3:40:34.500 --> 3:40:38.660]  that's how you know the left is in an issue banker let's just imagine as a thought experiment
[3:40:39.700 --> 3:40:46.500]  let's imagine there was a video game funded by a major corporation where they had they told the
[3:40:46.500 --> 3:40:51.620]  truth story about the orlando shooter they told the truth story about the terrorists and brossel
[3:40:51.620 --> 3:40:59.700]  they told the truth story about the shooters in paris in fact the munich attack niece paris and now
[3:40:59.700 --> 3:41:05.620]  the manchester attack and they had a mosque and in their promotion they had mos going on there
[3:41:06.180 --> 3:41:13.060]  and they were talking about muslims being radicalized and sharing propaganda what would the media do
[3:41:13.060 --> 3:41:18.580]  with something like this would that video game ever be allowed on the shelves but there's a
[3:41:18.580 --> 3:41:27.380]  bigger question if there were a picture of muhammad hanging behind me would i be would i be killed
[3:41:27.380 --> 3:41:36.740]  if i posted a picture behind me of christians mocking them defacing them i obviously wouldn't
[3:41:36.740 --> 3:41:41.860]  do this because that would be wrong and i don't believe in mocking anybody's religion and i certainly
[3:41:41.860 --> 3:41:47.460]  wouldn't do it to the great christians listening here but if i did my life would not be in danger
[3:41:48.020 --> 3:41:52.740]  if christians would not come and try to kill me there's and this is proof this is empirically
[3:41:52.740 --> 3:41:59.220]  proven there have been all kinds of vile vile things like piss christ where they put a crucifix
[3:41:59.220 --> 3:42:05.780]  of jesus and uran funded by taxpayers by the way that isn't even art it's just vulgar it's actually
[3:42:05.780 --> 3:42:12.340]  funded by taxpayers christians aren't going to go in there and murder anybody blow anything up
[3:42:13.060 --> 3:42:18.180]  charlie hebdo right those of you listening and you remember the charlie hebdo murders
[3:42:18.180 --> 3:42:24.980]  there was this satirical newspaper in france that made fun of everybody they ridiculed catholics
[3:42:25.540 --> 3:42:32.660]  jews christians protestants muslims and the most vile vulgar ways again ways that i don't approve
[3:42:32.660 --> 3:42:39.140]  of they would make um carcatures of jewish people carcatures of the virgin mary engaged in all kinds
[3:42:39.140 --> 3:42:44.180]  of vulgar acts completely degenerate and i didn't i don't even think artistically valuable it's
[3:42:44.180 --> 3:42:49.220]  complete degeneracy but they had a right to do this and they had every right to do this well then
[3:42:49.220 --> 3:42:57.060]  what happened is they didn't satire on mohammed the prophet mohammed what happened next ak47's
[3:42:57.060 --> 3:43:02.340]  murders everywhere now what happened on social media the charlie hebdo murders i think were two
[3:43:02.340 --> 3:43:10.020]  or three years ago everybody on social media i stand with charlie hebdo more hashtags jesus charlie
[3:43:10.020 --> 3:43:17.540]  everything on social media hashtag campaigns standing up against it but they wouldn't name
[3:43:17.540 --> 3:43:25.300]  who did it they wouldn't identify the enemy they wouldn't say this is caused by radical islamic
[3:43:25.300 --> 3:43:30.660]  terrorism and if they did they would be fired but they had a hashtag so we have now had how
[3:43:30.660 --> 3:43:35.860]  many terrorist attacks have there been since charlie hebdo i think there's been one at least
[3:43:35.860 --> 3:43:41.540]  every month in europe i lost track of them i was actually trying to keep track of them but you can't
[3:43:41.540 --> 3:43:47.700]  keep track of all the terrorist attacks coming from again radical islamic terror so far cry five
[3:43:47.700 --> 3:43:52.980]  in the hollywood and media entertainment establishment they won't dare criticize islam in
[3:43:52.980 --> 3:43:58.260]  fact they do the opposite i don't know do we have that katie perry clip so katie perry had come in so
[3:43:58.900 --> 3:44:04.180]  here's what you have coming from hollywood if you believe in god and jesus and you and you believe
[3:44:04.180 --> 3:44:10.580]  in easter and christ christmas and christianity you're some evil cultist who's probably a cannibal
[3:44:11.460 --> 3:44:17.700]  but if you are part of a religion where there's terrorist attacks all over the world actually
[3:44:17.700 --> 3:44:23.940]  every day there was martial law declared in the philippines you can't even criticize it so let's
[3:44:23.940 --> 3:44:29.140]  try to load up that kate perry clip if we have that so great clip and it really is a great contrast
[3:44:29.140 --> 3:44:34.980]  between what the media is saying versus what we have the greatest thing we can do is just
[3:44:34.980 --> 3:44:42.340]  unite and love on each other and like no barriers no borders like it we're we all need to just coexist
[3:44:46.100 --> 3:44:49.620]  what a joke you watch this stuff and you're just thinking
[3:44:49.620 --> 3:44:54.340]  what a joke and of course the navy seal had a great reaction to that video i think
[3:44:54.340 --> 3:45:02.660]  i think if you want to you are if you come to america you're american and nothing else and
[3:45:02.660 --> 3:45:07.300]  american foremost and i think that what what this is is we don't have people who respect
[3:45:07.300 --> 3:45:11.300]  the culture of the united states of america i mean you you have people like katie perry for
[3:45:11.300 --> 3:45:15.780]  instance i mean this this woman has said oh we need to give them hugs hug it out hug it out go
[3:45:15.780 --> 3:45:20.820]  to hell katie perry hold it you know oh yeah hold a uh one of your concerts in syria and see how
[3:45:20.820 --> 3:45:25.140]  that goes she is not i mean these people fundamentally don't understand what is going on here but
[3:45:25.140 --> 3:45:28.260]  you don't think she's coming from a bad place you just think they don't get the threats oh i
[3:45:28.260 --> 3:45:32.180]  think that i think they're just completely benign and they don't understand any of this
[3:45:32.180 --> 3:45:36.100]  and they don't want to understand too and that's why i like i'm so strong against these celebrities
[3:45:36.100 --> 3:45:40.260]  who speak out say oh well we can fight this through love or you know it's it's not really violent
[3:45:40.260 --> 3:45:44.900]  they don't mean it we're putting the political correctness of of you know the islamic culture
[3:45:44.900 --> 3:45:48.820]  over our lives of our citizens and we need to stop that immediately quickly i want to ask
[3:45:48.820 --> 3:45:57.220]  me hey man i believe in free speech again leaving we can all leave this back by the way to the very
[3:45:57.220 --> 3:46:03.540]  first segment we did on that liberal professor who is an avowed anti-racist professor weinstein
[3:46:03.540 --> 3:46:11.620]  he's a liberal professor avowed anti-racist who wants to coexist and the far left in america
[3:46:11.620 --> 3:46:17.380]  won't let us coexist and that is why the far left is actually using radical islamic terrorism
[3:46:17.380 --> 3:46:22.900]  as a weapon to attack the right and that is why the media is using radical islamic terrorism
[3:46:22.900 --> 3:46:26.820]  to silence the people that they disagree with and that's why they won't tell the truth about it
[3:46:26.820 --> 3:46:32.660]  so i mean let's just let's just think about it i love the idea of coexistence that is what free
[3:46:32.660 --> 3:46:38.660]  speech is fundamentally about free speech is all about hey you can make fun of each other in fact
[3:46:38.660 --> 3:46:44.260]  comedy central made fun of me i went and did a talk with them and i knew they were going to edit me
[3:46:44.260 --> 3:46:50.100]  and they edited me completely out of context but in a very funny way and a lot of left-wingers go oh
[3:46:50.100 --> 3:46:54.420]  comedy central they really got certain which good and i thought what are you talking about i believe
[3:46:54.420 --> 3:47:00.500]  in free speech i believe in jokes i'm happy for comedy central to to make fun of me i think that
[3:47:00.500 --> 3:47:06.820]  that is what we need is free speech it's the left that opposes free speech it is radical islam
[3:47:06.820 --> 3:47:12.980]  that opposes free speech the terrorism again it isn't happening from christians so i believe far cry
[3:47:12.980 --> 3:47:19.780]  five has the right to do a video game making christians trying to make christians look terrible
[3:47:19.780 --> 3:47:24.420]  i think that that's awful i think it's disgusting i think it's christian phobic i think it goes
[3:47:24.420 --> 3:47:31.220]  against western values i think it's vile and i know that it's propaganda designed to create
[3:47:31.220 --> 3:47:36.820]  violence against christians that said they have a free speech right to do it where is the free
[3:47:36.820 --> 3:47:43.140]  speech right to do a video game from far cry five about muslims where they're being radicalized in
[3:47:43.140 --> 3:47:48.740]  the mosque where the terrorism coming from a mosque that would never be allowed you and again you would
[3:47:48.740 --> 3:47:53.460]  not only be attacked by the government and the you and the e you would actually be arrested that's
[3:47:53.460 --> 3:47:59.620]  actually a great point to think about is if you were in the e you or the uk and you did a video
[3:47:59.620 --> 3:48:06.420]  game like far cry five but you made it about islam you would go to prison katie hopkins i believe is
[3:48:06.420 --> 3:48:11.860]  her name there's a british commentator who was on twitter and said enough of this terrorism
[3:48:12.420 --> 3:48:17.140]  we need to stand up against this what is going on she was reported to the police and the police
[3:48:17.140 --> 3:48:22.020]  department said we're investigating it at first i thought it was a hoax right i said i can't believe
[3:48:22.020 --> 3:48:30.820]  this no so i think her name is katie kate hopkins on twitter criticized islam they reported her to
[3:48:30.820 --> 3:48:37.460]  police on twitter the police account on twitter said we are investigating her that really does say
[3:48:37.460 --> 3:48:43.060]  it all they're more worried about mean tweets on twitter which and by the way her tweet wasn't
[3:48:43.060 --> 3:48:48.500]  even mean she wasn't even saying islam's or savages or animals or anything it was just saying hey we
[3:48:48.500 --> 3:48:55.700]  need to talk about this we need to have an open conversation about this right jail you go to jail
[3:48:55.700 --> 3:48:59.860]  so if you're in europe there is no free speech in the e you there is no free speech in the uk
[3:48:59.860 --> 3:49:05.060]  if you did far cry five a video game like that yes the kitty hopkins though looks like she lost
[3:49:05.060 --> 3:49:12.100]  her job too is that so maybe she's off her network and everything right so not only is she losing her
[3:49:12.100 --> 3:49:21.620]  job she's also losing her uh freedom potentially she might go to prison she might go to prison
[3:49:22.180 --> 3:49:26.660]  over a tweet that could have been worded a little bit differently right she could have used
[3:49:26.660 --> 3:49:30.580]  people have to be careful how they work things and realize the cultural context of what they're
[3:49:30.580 --> 3:49:35.940]  saying and that's part about being in the media it's been conscientious but she could have she
[3:49:35.940 --> 3:49:42.260]  could go to jail so why can't you do a video game like far cry five in america or the uk
[3:49:42.260 --> 3:49:47.140]  because if you did it in the uk the e you'd go to prison because it'd be hate speech if you did it
[3:49:47.140 --> 3:49:54.020]  in the us you you legally might be allowed to do it but your offices would be firebomb if you did a
[3:49:54.020 --> 3:50:01.460]  video game with a picture of muhammad in a mosque talking about radical islamic terrorism your offices
[3:50:01.460 --> 3:50:08.740]  would be fire bombed by muslims and that's what's the truth so what's the answer i don't know that's
[3:50:08.740 --> 3:50:14.740]  what we have to think about my view is the answer is free speech my view is that religions cannot
[3:50:14.740 --> 3:50:19.620]  coexist in a culture that doesn't allow free speech that's why the first amendment has the
[3:50:19.620 --> 3:50:25.140]  establishment of religion clause and the free speech clause because if you do establish a religion
[3:50:25.700 --> 3:50:31.060]  you cannot free speech the only way religions can coexist is if we can criticize each other critique
[3:50:31.060 --> 3:50:36.580]  each other mock each other and we have to just let people do the vile caricature how else can
[3:50:36.580 --> 3:50:43.220]  free speech exist it's a war store dot com free speech exists because it takes money to fund these

[3:54:20.980 --> 3:54:24.420]  those of you who are wondering how to find me you can go to twitter.com forward slash
[3:54:24.420 --> 3:54:30.900]  sternovich so much going on we have of course a reminiscent i think that we've talked a lot
[3:54:30.900 --> 3:54:36.020]  about the seth rich case and i wanted to talk about it just a little bit more because there's a lot
[3:54:36.020 --> 3:54:40.980]  of fake news about my role in the investigation and of course they always lie about us when they
[3:54:40.980 --> 3:54:45.460]  can't the number one thing i've noticed about the seth rich case is the media is telling us we can't
[3:54:45.460 --> 3:54:52.180]  we can't talk about it well that sounds awful lot like hillary's health the last time the fake news
[3:54:52.180 --> 3:54:57.700]  media told us we couldn't talk about a subject it was hillary's health they said you guys cannot
[3:54:57.700 --> 3:55:02.420]  talk about it she's perfectly healthy and then of course she had a seizure on 9 11 and then today
[3:55:02.420 --> 3:55:09.140]  she had another coughing fit why does the media care so much about debunking which they're not
[3:55:09.140 --> 3:55:13.940]  doing why do they care so much about debunking the seth rich case hey there's a few people
[3:55:13.940 --> 3:55:20.420]  if i spent my time debunking all the nonsense about me and alex jones that george sorris
[3:55:20.420 --> 3:55:24.420]  funds every day i couldn't get any work done i don't care that there are a bunch of people
[3:55:24.420 --> 3:55:28.660]  lying about me on the internet every day of my life i don't have time to go mess with that
[3:55:28.660 --> 3:55:34.340]  so why is the media creating a narrative to shut this story down now i'm going to be clear about
[3:55:34.340 --> 3:55:42.900]  what my position is i do not know if seth rich was the source of the dnc leaks but i also do not
[3:55:42.900 --> 3:55:50.820]  believe that the russians had any involvement with that the the ai t guy could have provided
[3:55:50.820 --> 3:55:57.060]  the kind of emails that wiki leaks had in the leaks so why is it that the media is freaking
[3:55:57.060 --> 3:56:03.620]  out so much we because we're investigating what we found through our investigation is that told
[3:56:03.620 --> 3:56:10.500]  there's been total police incompetency and that the dnc rushed in to help the family and there's
[3:56:10.500 --> 3:56:15.860]  been no competent investigation and this is why i know there is some kind of cover what cover up
[3:56:15.860 --> 3:56:22.660]  with the seth rich murder imagine something happened god forbid to an info wars person right
[3:56:22.660 --> 3:56:28.660]  i can tell you what would happen there would be a 24 hour hotline there would be a tip line
[3:56:28.660 --> 3:56:36.740]  alex would be offered reward money it would be a full 9 11 style kind of emergency what is going on
[3:56:36.740 --> 3:56:41.940]  what happened five investigators would be hired there would be actually what is going on a full
[3:56:41.940 --> 3:56:49.700]  investigation seth rich was a dnc staffer the dnc is a multi-billion dollar corporation
[3:56:49.700 --> 3:56:56.180]  they bring in all the money from all the big donors warren bucket facebook zuckerberg they bring
[3:56:56.180 --> 3:57:04.100]  in all the money from sorrows where was the hotline where was the investigator isn't that
[3:57:04.100 --> 3:57:10.500]  interesting that the dnc did not hire a private investigator they did not set up a billboard they
[3:57:10.500 --> 3:57:15.220]  did not offer a tip line they didn't put billboards up in the neighborhoods where was murdered they
[3:57:15.220 --> 3:57:20.980]  didn't send people out right away to investigate they didn't look for any camera footage has anyone
[3:57:20.980 --> 3:57:30.420]  here seen a photo picture of the suspect cameras everywhere there are cameras everywhere because
[3:57:30.420 --> 3:57:36.020]  we live in this orwellian world in dc big brother style surveillance state in dc i haven't seen a
[3:57:36.020 --> 3:57:43.060]  sketch of the suspect why not why isn't there a billboard up why weren't the rewards offered no
[3:57:43.060 --> 3:57:50.660]  no no the dnc didn't hire anybody to investigate the murder to find the murderer oj simpson did a
[3:57:50.660 --> 3:57:56.180]  better job pretending to look for the real killer than the dnc did to look for the killer seth rich
[3:57:56.180 --> 3:58:03.460]  instead all the dnc did was they go oh hey we're gonna give you a pr damage control person so all
[3:58:03.460 --> 3:58:09.540]  the dnc cared about was covering it up doing damage control sending some public relations
[3:58:09.540 --> 3:58:14.500]  black who doesn't care about the seth rich family he only cares about the dnc and their reputation
[3:58:14.500 --> 3:58:20.900]  and there was no investigation ever done to me that's intriguing again i'm not saying seth rich
[3:58:20.900 --> 3:58:25.060]  was the source of the wiki leaks because i don't know and as a lawyer and a journalist i look for
[3:58:25.060 --> 3:58:30.340]  the avenues i don't say what i i don't make up stories like the fake news media there are more
[3:58:30.340 --> 3:58:34.900]  questions than answers we're going to keep looking and the fake news media cannot stop us
[3:58:34.900 --> 3:58:50.820]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
