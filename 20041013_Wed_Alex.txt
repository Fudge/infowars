[00:00.000 --> 00:29.920]  Hello, it is October 13th, 2004, and I am your host,
[00:29.920 --> 00:35.520]  Alex Jones, and tonight we are going to air that third part of some of it which we didn't
[00:35.520 --> 00:42.840]  get a chance to play last night of a national British documentary on Sky Television News,
[00:42.840 --> 00:48.640]  the British affiliate of Fox, basically, Corporation of News Corp.
[00:48.640 --> 00:56.520]  Where they try to basically discredit conspiracy theories about the Illuminati.
[00:56.520 --> 01:00.400]  So we are going to finish up by playing about 10-15 minutes of this, then I am going to
[01:00.400 --> 01:07.600]  come back with some very important news concerning a US senator evacuating from the US capital
[01:07.600 --> 01:12.080]  saying he was given intelligence that there would be a big attack on the capital and that
[01:12.080 --> 01:19.480]  he cannot in conscience leave himself as other senators are leaving and at the same time
[01:19.480 --> 01:24.120]  then leave his staff there.
[01:24.120 --> 01:28.840]  That and a bunch of other news, some of the latest developments of the national ID card
[01:28.840 --> 01:34.280]  are coming up in about 15 minutes after we air the last 15 minutes of this hour long
[01:34.280 --> 01:38.520]  special that aired on national British television.
[01:38.520 --> 01:45.040]  Then I am going to air about 15 minutes of an hour long special that I was also in concerning
[01:45.040 --> 01:50.640]  9-11 which is really a propaganda piece.
[01:50.640 --> 01:55.600]  It starts out fair and then tries to discredit basically those that are exposing 9-11 and
[01:55.600 --> 01:57.560]  government involvement.
[01:57.560 --> 02:00.680]  So that is coming up as well tonight.
[02:00.680 --> 02:08.000]  So a lot of news and two different segments from national British television concerning
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.120]  the Illuminati, the controllers of course of the 9-11 attacks.
[02:13.120 --> 02:21.160]  And coming up next week with our two live TV shows I will play several other segments
[02:21.160 --> 02:29.200]  and finish up this British 9-11 film that has not been seen yet here in the United States.
[02:29.200 --> 02:37.640]  So that is coming up, stay with us, we will be back in just a few minutes after we conclude
[02:37.640 --> 02:41.680]  this Illuminati piece that just aired in England a few weeks ago and then we will get into
[02:41.680 --> 02:45.480]  the news that is really important that affects us all.
[02:45.480 --> 02:48.880]  So please call your friends and family, tell them to tune in, this is information you do
[02:48.880 --> 02:49.880]  not want to miss.
[02:49.880 --> 02:54.720]  We will go ahead and roll now the piece about the Illuminati, we will come back and comment
[02:54.720 --> 02:55.720]  on it.
[02:55.720 --> 02:57.440]  So again, please stay with us.
[02:57.440 --> 03:06.320]  My search for the illusive Illuminati is proving far more complex than I had hoped, but occasionally
[03:06.320 --> 03:14.320]  I told, we are allowed glimpses of them through their secret, sometimes satanic signs.
[03:14.320 --> 03:21.760]  Make no mistake about it, these men believe that ritual, hand signs, symbols bring power
[03:21.760 --> 03:28.760]  and when you get to that stage I believe you become demon possessed.
[03:28.760 --> 03:38.200]  And these demonic signs and symbols of the Illuminati are all around us, especially it
[03:38.200 --> 03:47.600]  seems in downtown Austin.
[03:47.600 --> 03:52.080]  I have been told that this building holds a kind of special significance for the Illuminati
[03:52.080 --> 03:57.240]  because the Illuminati apparently worship owls and they say this building looks a bit
[03:57.240 --> 04:05.800]  like an owl.
[04:05.800 --> 04:09.880]  I'll be honest, I can't really see it myself, but I'm not getting much of an owl vibe from
[04:09.880 --> 04:16.520]  this.
[04:16.520 --> 04:27.300]  The owl that I can't see is Molek again, named after an ancient Middle Eastern god.
[04:27.300 --> 04:28.800]  So what is this building?
[04:28.800 --> 04:33.560]  Well it's a new building in Austin, it's the Frost Bank building, but the two circles
[04:33.560 --> 04:37.640]  on each side of the beak and then the crown, that's the crest of the owl's horns, it's
[04:37.640 --> 04:43.120]  got the eyes, it's got the beak, it's an owl and it's kind of like the Illuminati mascot,
[04:43.120 --> 04:44.120]  one of their mascots.
[04:44.120 --> 04:46.840]  One of them bones is one, the other is the owl.
[04:46.840 --> 04:51.840]  The Illuminati come out of the secret mystery architecture schools, so they use architecture
[04:51.840 --> 04:57.560]  as a way to communicate their views, so basically this is a giant idol to Molek.
[04:57.560 --> 04:59.560]  Rick this is an idol.
[04:59.560 --> 05:02.840]  And so this is kind of how they communicate to us, it's hidden in plain view if it is
[05:02.840 --> 05:03.840]  hidden at all.
[05:03.840 --> 05:08.360]  And is it, I mean in a way, from what I've kind of learned this far about the Illuminati,
[05:08.360 --> 05:12.320]  it's kind of quite fitting that it's a hidden thing that is amongst us.
[05:12.320 --> 05:20.840]  Even amongst us, that's what they love, because the profane can't see it because we're unconscious.
[05:20.840 --> 05:21.840]  But why owls?
[05:21.840 --> 05:23.400]  Well I mean, that's kind of why.
[05:23.400 --> 05:27.360]  Well we always hear that oh it's the god of wisdom, going back to the Greeks.
[05:27.360 --> 05:34.080]  The owl also sees in the dark, he's all seen, but whereas his prey is blind in the night,
[05:34.080 --> 05:38.760]  so it's the king of the night, so it's kind of like a double meaning, whereas the all
[05:38.760 --> 05:43.240]  seeing eye, the illuminated one, it only illuminates for those that are part of it, it's an owl.
[05:43.240 --> 05:47.240]  But also, they can rotate their hands, they see behind them.
[05:47.240 --> 05:49.240]  That's right.
[05:49.240 --> 05:52.480]  Not that one, I don't mean the building.
[05:52.480 --> 05:55.640]  Always noticed in every city, the biggest buildings are the bank buildings towering
[05:55.640 --> 05:56.640]  above us.
[05:56.640 --> 06:02.920]  And now around the country, buildings are being affixed with owl effigies, there's others
[06:02.920 --> 06:07.360]  around the nation.
[06:07.360 --> 06:21.400]  So these are their monuments.
[06:21.400 --> 06:26.880]  Now that Alex has pointed out that it looks like an owl this building, it is quite difficult
[06:26.880 --> 06:27.880]  not to see an owl.
[06:27.880 --> 06:32.040]  I mean, certainly from this angle, it is owl-like.
[06:32.040 --> 06:37.040]  And around, you know, from face on, it's just the building, but it does seem that Austin
[06:37.040 --> 06:47.400]  is dominated by this big owl.
[06:47.400 --> 06:53.880]  As well as the owl, there's another symbol favored by the Illuminati.
[06:53.880 --> 06:58.320]  And this symbol also goes back to ancient times.
[06:58.320 --> 07:02.400]  The Illuminati operates in a pyramidal power structure.
[07:02.400 --> 07:10.400]  That's why the Illuminati symbol is the pyramid, a tiny enlightened elite at a giant dumb-down
[07:10.400 --> 07:14.720]  mass beneath them.
[07:14.720 --> 07:20.680]  And that Illuminati symbol, the pyramid, appears on that great American symbol, the dollar
[07:20.680 --> 07:21.680]  bill.
[07:21.680 --> 07:29.920]  We're going to be looking today at our one dollar bill, our one dollar bill.
[07:29.920 --> 07:36.440]  It has two very odd seals on it, and it's very interesting that the Illuminati had a
[07:36.440 --> 07:41.480]  great hand to play in choosing those seals.
[07:41.480 --> 07:44.440]  Here's your United States one dollar bill.
[07:44.440 --> 07:52.240]  On the back, you can clearly see the all-seeing eye of knowledge from the pyramid.
[07:52.240 --> 07:57.960]  And I suspect this represents the Illuminati at the top of the pyramid, and then all of
[07:57.960 --> 08:02.280]  the poor, ignorant folks making up the bulk of the structure.
[08:02.280 --> 08:06.600]  You've got the Latin inscription that says Norbus ordo ciclorum.
[08:06.600 --> 08:10.600]  Ciclorum means the material world, the secular world, that's where the word secular comes
[08:10.600 --> 08:11.600]  from.
[08:11.600 --> 08:16.280]  And Norbus is new and ordo is the globe of the world, so you could translate this as
[08:16.280 --> 08:20.320]  the new world order.
[08:20.320 --> 08:23.960]  And the people who are behind it are the people who control the money and we're back to the
[08:23.960 --> 08:25.120]  Illuminati.
[08:25.120 --> 08:31.680]  There's lots of occult stuff on here, and the end game of the Illuminati, their favorite
[08:31.680 --> 08:35.960]  thing is to hide everything in plain view so that we're conditioned to accept our slavery.
[08:35.960 --> 08:38.680]  They're all seeing eyes, they're pyramids.
[08:38.680 --> 08:42.760]  Apparently they get power from this, and it's also how they communicate with their own esoteric
[08:42.760 --> 08:43.760]  language with each other.
[08:43.760 --> 08:47.720]  So that's what you're saying about, you know, these clues are everywhere, like the giant
[08:47.720 --> 08:50.680]  owl tower in the middle of Austin.
[08:50.680 --> 08:51.680]  Yes.
[08:51.680 --> 08:56.840]  Well, I think I've got the hang of the owl, but now I'm intrigued by this new world order
[08:56.840 --> 08:59.680]  concept that's on the dollar bill.
[08:59.680 --> 09:06.360]  Could you explain to me the difference between the Illuminati and the new world order?
[09:06.360 --> 09:11.320]  Okay, well, the Illuminati, let's say, is the head and the brain, and then when I punch
[09:11.320 --> 09:13.520]  you in the face, that's the new world order.
[09:13.520 --> 09:16.960]  The new world order is what the Illuminati is building.
[09:16.960 --> 09:21.400]  It's their goal, it's their thrust, and the Illuminati is the creator, and their goal
[09:21.400 --> 09:30.080]  is the new world order, world government, global governance, world tyranny.
[09:30.080 --> 09:35.440]  What if they do achieve their goal of total globalization?
[09:35.440 --> 09:44.600]  What is our guarantee that some new Hitler, like Tarrant, won't gain control?
[09:44.600 --> 09:51.240]  And I'm told that's precisely what the Illuminati has in store for us.
[09:51.240 --> 09:54.800]  The mission of the Illuminati is what the mission of any elite has been throughout history,
[09:54.800 --> 09:59.960]  to maintain power and control, and to do that, they've got to dumb down and completely enslave
[09:59.960 --> 10:10.200]  the population, and if the population would become just half as informed about the history
[10:10.200 --> 10:15.840]  of the new world order and the Illuminati controllers as they are about football or baseball or
[10:15.840 --> 10:21.320]  basketball, then we'd be a much freer and happier society, and my mission is to wake
[10:21.320 --> 10:23.320]  people up.
[10:23.320 --> 10:30.840]  Governor Perry, from time to time, we return here to engage in the First Amendment and
[10:30.840 --> 10:35.440]  to expose your Illuminati activities, being a servant of Bush and the Skull and Bones
[10:35.440 --> 10:37.280]  Cabal in the new world order.
[10:37.280 --> 10:41.680]  It's an information warfare tool to expose corruption and evil, and what the Illuminati
[10:41.680 --> 10:42.680]  is up to.
[10:42.680 --> 10:44.960]  Why do you Illuminati thugs think you're gods?
[10:44.960 --> 10:48.960]  I'll never understand, but I'm here to tell you you're not my god.
[10:48.960 --> 10:50.280]  Are you allowed to do this?
[10:50.280 --> 10:52.600]  Well, they'd like to say we aren't, but we have a First Amendment.
[10:52.600 --> 10:56.400]  Yes, I've done this many times, so you're invoking the free speech.
[10:56.400 --> 10:57.400]  That's right.
[10:57.400 --> 10:58.400]  It's a very loud free speech.
[10:58.400 --> 11:02.760]  More and more people are waking up with the corruption that is government, the organized
[11:02.760 --> 11:06.440]  crime syndicate that is the new world order.
[11:06.440 --> 11:11.200]  You need to stop ensliving us, and you need to stop serving your Illuminati globalist
[11:11.200 --> 11:14.200]  masters, Governor.
[11:14.200 --> 11:20.480]  I really, really hope he's in.
[11:20.480 --> 11:24.600]  But are Alex Jones' protests in vain?
[11:24.600 --> 11:28.800]  Are the fears of the conspiracy theorists legitimate?
[11:28.800 --> 11:32.920]  Are we already inside the new world order?
[11:32.920 --> 11:39.560]  The Illuminati doctrine seemed to be getting a tighter and tighter chokehold on the world,
[11:39.560 --> 11:44.440]  but yet on the other hand, there is a backlash and there is a resistance.
[11:44.440 --> 11:51.200]  So I see it as kind of a race as to who's going to get control first, the people who
[11:51.200 --> 11:59.400]  would tyrannize their fellow man or the people of Goodheart who would like to see true freedom
[11:59.400 --> 12:03.040]  and democracy.
[12:03.040 --> 12:07.720]  We're already inside the new world order, and their end game is a world population
[12:07.720 --> 12:13.400]  of only about 250 to 500 million people living in a big brother society.
[12:13.400 --> 12:23.160]  Every action, every motion, everything we do, tracked and traced.
[12:23.160 --> 12:26.160]  We see now the technological capability.
[12:26.160 --> 12:32.440]  Listen, these guys, the Illuminati today, they have a capability that Adolf Hitler and Joseph
[12:32.440 --> 12:35.360]  Stalin didn't have.
[12:35.360 --> 12:41.280]  I've dedicated the rest of my life to exposure of this knowledge, because I think it's evil.
[12:41.280 --> 12:47.760]  They are going to force drug in a brave new world type scenario, almost the entire population.
[12:47.760 --> 12:54.920]  It's the ultimate power trip, completely out of control, and humanity has got to wake
[12:54.920 --> 12:59.400]  up to this elite, face the facts of history, and it's got to be done now.
[12:59.400 --> 13:03.720]  And I hope people will rally to this cry and stand up against the new world order and the
[13:03.720 --> 13:10.160]  Illuminati masters that have built it.
[13:10.160 --> 13:14.680]  But just how much have I learned about the Illuminati on my journey?
[13:14.680 --> 13:22.240]  Well, amongst other things, they really control everything of significance throughout the
[13:22.240 --> 13:23.680]  entire world.
[13:23.680 --> 13:30.920]  And these men funded Adolf Hitler, and they give members questionnaires, you know, would
[13:30.920 --> 13:33.760]  you kill, would you steal?
[13:33.760 --> 13:36.880]  But I still have many questions.
[13:36.880 --> 13:42.440]  I mean, does the fact that Mr. A never turned up in Hartford mean the Illuminati don't exist?
[13:42.440 --> 13:47.720]  Or does it mean they do exist because they got to Mr. A with their blood-curdling forfeits?
[13:47.720 --> 13:49.680]  And just think of all the other things I've been told.
[13:49.680 --> 13:54.480]  They have antenna rays that monitor all electronic signals.
[13:54.480 --> 13:58.280]  And it's got the eyes, it's got the beak, it's an owl.
[13:58.280 --> 14:06.360]  And they have names like Magog in God, and they collect body parts and do strange rituals
[14:06.360 --> 14:08.880]  at coffins.
[14:08.880 --> 14:11.000]  Isn't it all too far-fetched?
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.520]  Just all too unbelievable.
[14:16.520 --> 14:22.280]  The Illuminati just couldn't exist.
[14:22.280 --> 14:23.280]  Could it?
[14:23.280 --> 14:41.960]  Hello, my friends, again, thank you for joining us.
[14:41.960 --> 14:48.920]  Mr. A, from that piece, they did that interview with Mr. A about two months ago.
[14:48.920 --> 14:52.800]  He goes out to this town in London and claims he's going to let him meet the Illuminati,
[14:52.800 --> 14:56.000]  but then the Illuminati doesn't show up, so everything's discredited.
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.120]  They can't discredit anything we said in the film, so they go, as I said, and manufacture
[15:02.120 --> 15:08.040]  this staged event with an individual I called an actor last night because they can't discredit
[15:08.040 --> 15:09.040]  the facts.
[15:09.040 --> 15:13.200]  They bring in somebody to then not have something show up to discredit that.
[15:13.200 --> 15:18.000]  Then I talked to my webmaster, Paul Watson, today on the telephone.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.040]  He said, Alex, you were out of town last Friday, you went with your family to the beach.
[15:22.040 --> 15:27.840]  You didn't see what I posted on PrisonPlanet.com, and I said, no, Paul, I didn't.
[15:27.840 --> 15:41.240]  Well, we happen to have the big local mainstream 200-year established newspaper, and they have
[15:41.240 --> 15:50.160]  Mr. A, Tim Aixon, in the article, the guy you saw in that car who couldn't bring you
[15:50.160 --> 15:56.240]  the Illuminati, and he said, I'm the Illuminati, and he took them and showed them secret tunnels
[15:56.240 --> 16:00.640]  underneath the castle under the judges' chambers and all of the city, and then the Illuminati
[16:00.640 --> 16:04.760]  came forward, and it's in the paper, it's a six-page article, and said, yes, this is
[16:04.760 --> 16:09.760]  where it was based originally, which is actually true that a lot of it got set up in Germany
[16:09.760 --> 16:15.080]  and then moved to England, and he just says, I'm a member of the Illuminati, so when he's
[16:15.080 --> 16:22.640]  not discrediting us by not showing up and not producing Mr. A, it turns out that he
[16:22.640 --> 16:28.360]  and his twin brother are Mr. A. In fact, Mike, come in here and give folks a close shot of
[16:28.360 --> 16:34.760]  this, and if you go to PrisonPlanet.com and click on last Friday, what today's the 13th,
[16:34.760 --> 16:41.800]  and it's Wednesday, so back on the 8th or 9th, you can click on one of the top stories
[16:41.800 --> 16:46.120]  at PrisonPlanet.com that I wasn't even aware of, and I was here saying this was obviously
[16:46.120 --> 16:52.360]  a stage deal, and here he is in the local newspaper going, yes, we're the Illuminati,
[16:52.360 --> 16:57.400]  and the paper laughed at him, so he took them and showed them the underground chambers
[16:57.400 --> 17:00.160]  where they do the rituals and the rest of it, and they talked to local officials, and
[17:00.160 --> 17:04.640]  they said, well, yes, it's a talent secret that we have an Illuminati base here, and
[17:04.640 --> 17:09.960]  they showed them all of the areas, so you just saw in the film, made a few months ago,
[17:09.960 --> 17:15.880]  which released a few weeks ago, that Mr. A. didn't show up, so the Illuminati doesn't
[17:15.880 --> 17:22.360]  exist, and we're all a bunch of cooks, and then all of a sudden, this guy is in the paper
[17:22.360 --> 17:26.520]  saying, no, I'm a member of the Illuminati, and they laugh at him, so he takes them and
[17:26.520 --> 17:30.080]  shows them all the secret passages, and then the mayor and everybody else pops out and
[17:30.080 --> 17:32.840]  says, yes, it's all true, ha, ha, ha.
[17:32.840 --> 17:38.760]  So you go to PrisonPlanet.com and you click on last Friday's edition, there's a calendar
[17:38.760 --> 17:45.720]  there, you can go read this article, or just type in the secrets of underground Hartford
[17:45.720 --> 17:50.040]  into a major search engine like Google, the secrets of underground Hartford, and the
[17:50.040 --> 17:56.080]  direction link, I believe it's the second link, will pop up for you.
[17:56.080 --> 18:01.120]  Again, I didn't know this last night, I just got this documentary a few days ago, watched
[18:01.120 --> 18:07.200]  it, and here's this guy, again, we're talking about government documents, world history,
[18:07.200 --> 18:13.120]  the encyclopedia, skull and bones, real things, I snuck into Bohemian Grove, they produced
[18:13.120 --> 18:18.680]  this five hour special, one of the hour shows here in prime time in England, on the biggest
[18:18.680 --> 18:23.440]  network in England, Sky Television, is there an Illuminati, and they go, oh, well, it's
[18:23.440 --> 18:30.360]  kind of discredited because we went and met with a guy in Hartford, England, and he said
[18:30.360 --> 18:37.440]  we were going to meet with the Illuminati, and then they didn't show up, and then a week
[18:37.440 --> 18:43.040]  or so after it comes out on National British Television, it says the secrets of underground
[18:43.040 --> 18:47.640]  Hartford, a secret labyrinth of tunnels under Hartford streets have been revealed to the
[18:47.640 --> 18:52.080]  Mercury, members of the Knights Templar Secret Society, which still has members in the town,
[18:52.080 --> 18:56.840]  have spoken for the first time about the underground lair used by their forebearers almost 1,000
[18:56.840 --> 19:02.960]  years ago, and then they go and they show the whole thing, and they've got all the public
[19:02.960 --> 19:08.240]  officials admitting it, emanating from the dungeons of Hartford Castle, from Four Street
[19:08.240 --> 19:13.720]  to passages run like a warrant of the ancient county town and stretch from blue coats to
[19:13.720 --> 19:18.320]  county hall according to the group, and they went and did an inspection of it, today many
[19:18.320 --> 19:21.880]  of the entrances to the subterranean passages have been bricked up, but according to the
[19:21.880 --> 19:26.880]  modern-day Knights, some are still in use and may even be booby-trapped. Too fantastic
[19:26.880 --> 19:34.440]  to be true, reporter Raymond Brown investigates at a secret location in the town, Tim Ackerson
[19:34.440 --> 19:38.960]  declared, we are now prepared to reveal a secret we feel the people of Hartford should
[19:38.960 --> 19:44.520]  be made aware of, there is an extensive labyrinth right under our feet. Then it goes on to say
[19:44.520 --> 19:51.520]  in a Sky Television news piece, this guy didn't reveal that he was Illuminati, but now he's
[19:51.520 --> 19:57.880]  willing to tell us. So regardless, we're talking about facts, we're talking about history,
[19:57.880 --> 20:02.160]  we're talking about global mafias that work through secret societies, and they admit
[20:02.160 --> 20:06.520]  the Italian mob, that La Cosa Nostra has rituals and is a secret society, well the
[20:06.520 --> 20:17.520]  big wasp mob is too. White Anglo-Saxon Protestant mafia, wasp mafia, and it goes through all
[20:17.520 --> 20:24.720]  this. So instead of discrediting one thing, I said, or Tex Mar said, or Jim Mar said,
[20:24.720 --> 20:31.360]  or Galen Ross said, former NSA officer, Galen Ross, former Air Force officer, Space and
[20:31.360 --> 20:37.040]  Aeronautics professor, Tex Mar's, Jim Mar's award-winning journalist, instead of discrediting
[20:37.040 --> 20:41.520]  what we say, which they can't do, they go out and have a staged deal with somebody who
[20:41.520 --> 20:46.680]  claims to be a member of Illuminati and has town elders vouching for him, he goes out
[20:46.680 --> 20:53.680]  and acts like it doesn't exist and makes people look stupid. And I said that instinctively,
[20:53.680 --> 21:02.240]  looking at that guy and what they did. So that's the type of propaganda that we're dealing
[21:02.240 --> 21:14.880]  with that we're facing here. And I suggest you go read this lengthy article at prisonplanet.com.
[21:14.880 --> 21:23.480]  Now let's talk about some things that we can absolutely totally 100% prove. A couple
[21:23.480 --> 21:30.760]  weeks ago they come out and admit that the hepatitis B shot, almost quadruples, 3.7 times,
[21:30.760 --> 21:36.520]  increases your chance of getting muscular sclerosis. Since they started giving the meningitis
[21:36.520 --> 21:47.400]  shot, people who take it, deaths of meningitis have increased 17.6%. They've been caught
[21:47.400 --> 21:53.000]  putting the AIDS virus, HIV virus, in shots in Africa and Asia. That's mainstream news,
[21:53.000 --> 21:58.880]  nobel laureates are now exposing it. But I don't want to spend all night on this, I've
[21:58.880 --> 22:03.400]  got a bunch of other important news I want to cover. But before we get to all the other
[22:03.400 --> 22:12.960]  news, here is the San Francisco Chronicle. And the San Francisco Chronicle is carrying
[22:12.960 --> 22:25.040]  on their website an associated press article, grand jury investigating flu vaccine failure.
[22:25.040 --> 22:33.440]  Now let's go over this. I could spend an hour on this, but I'm going to spend about two
[22:33.440 --> 22:43.040]  minutes on it. About three weeks ago, independent laboratories in the United States and England
[22:43.040 --> 22:49.320]  tested this company's flu vaccine. They wondered why the more flu vaccines we take, the more
[22:49.320 --> 23:02.080]  flu deaths we have. They tested vaccine and it had live super flu virus in it. And so
[23:02.080 --> 23:12.480]  I went on radio and TV and I said, the current flu vaccine they're shipping to you is contaminated.
[23:12.480 --> 23:18.040]  But by the time it made it to the statesman and the Dallas Morning News and all the other
[23:18.040 --> 23:25.440]  papers and local radio and TV I've watched and listened to, it was, gee, only half the
[23:25.440 --> 23:31.760]  flu vaccine we need was made. Boy, you better run out and get your shot like it's some
[23:31.760 --> 23:36.240]  Christmas toy that's in demand that people are lining up to get. They create this false
[23:36.240 --> 23:42.720]  fad that God, you got to have it. And publicly, admittedly, it's because all the flu vaccine
[23:42.720 --> 23:48.400]  made by the company that supplies half the US population admittedly was putting live
[23:48.400 --> 24:00.200]  flu virus in the vaccines, giving you a souped up flu. And now England is in the grips of
[24:00.200 --> 24:04.400]  a deadly flu epidemic and people are dying by the tens of thousands. 40,000 people die
[24:04.400 --> 24:08.720]  on average a year in the US from the flu vaccine. By the way, this same company last year contaminated
[24:08.720 --> 24:12.480]  the flu vaccine because I happen to have a memory and save these articles and go back
[24:12.480 --> 24:16.760]  and look at it. But they know you're not paying attention. Oh, you know all the football and
[24:16.760 --> 24:21.040]  basketball players and who they are and how much money they make and what the score was
[24:21.040 --> 24:29.680]  in the 1985 Super Bowl. But oh, you can't have a memory when it comes to deadly flu vaccines.
[24:29.680 --> 24:37.520]  They're adding other stuff to it, by the way. And in this San Francisco Chronicle article,
[24:37.520 --> 24:47.800]  they admit that the vaccines made in Liverpool plant were contaminated with live flu virus.
[24:47.800 --> 24:52.400]  This is October 12. Now, this was admitted a few weeks ago, but this is the only mainstream
[24:52.400 --> 24:58.080]  news article I could find. This Associated Press article posted in the San Francisco
[24:58.080 --> 25:05.640]  Chronicle that admitted that it was because it was contaminated with live flu virus. When
[25:05.640 --> 25:14.800]  you hear about it, it's oh my God, there's a shortage. We better go out and get our shots.
[25:14.800 --> 25:27.600]  And the exception to the rule is when vaccines are not contaminated. Bill Gates, Prince Philip,
[25:27.600 --> 25:39.240]  Ted Turner, the names go on and on, give billions of dollars of their own money to, quote, ensure
[25:39.240 --> 25:45.760]  that the third world populations get their shots. And when independent groups test it,
[25:45.760 --> 25:53.760]  they find hormones to sterilize women, add it to the pathogen, live AIDS virus, cancer
[25:53.760 --> 26:00.960]  viruses, you name it. That's just a fact, folks. So you go ahead and you go take your
[26:00.960 --> 26:06.440]  vaccines. Remember that CBS piece a few weeks ago we played locally, a national piece, they
[26:06.440 --> 26:09.880]  are locally, where they said the government now says mercury is actually good for your
[26:09.880 --> 26:13.560]  child's brain. Go ahead and take your shots. Yeah, we haven't taken the mercury out like
[26:13.560 --> 26:21.680]  we said we would. We actually increased it. Mercury is nutritious for you. Then they find
[26:21.680 --> 26:27.520]  gullible doctors in town to go out who feel good about their profession, and we're not
[26:27.520 --> 26:32.040]  doing wrong. The AMA says it's good to tell you how great all this is. I'm just going
[26:32.040 --> 26:40.680]  off the scientists, the epidemiologists, and the admissions. You got a bunch of eugenics
[26:40.680 --> 26:48.760]  control freaks running this country. They trained Hitler, folks, Margaret Singer. And
[26:48.760 --> 26:58.680]  it's happening. Now, I can't spend all night on vaccines. You better check it out for yourself.
[26:58.680 --> 27:03.040]  You better spend some time and research this. And you better remember that there is no law
[27:03.040 --> 27:07.960]  that you've got to take a vaccine, but every TV station and every newspaper in this country
[27:07.960 --> 27:12.400]  that I looked at before school started said it's the law, you've got to take these shots
[27:12.400 --> 27:18.120]  when there is no law. And for the regulation, there is a waiver in every principal and every
[27:18.120 --> 27:22.160]  nurse's drawer, and your children didn't have to take it, but they made you go to a sports
[27:22.160 --> 27:26.840]  stadium under threat of being kicked out of school and then being arrested for truancy
[27:26.840 --> 27:31.520]  and take their shots. Boy, they sure care about you, don't they? You better find out
[27:31.520 --> 27:41.680]  what's in those. We know what's in them. Now, I want to go through some other news quickly,
[27:41.680 --> 27:48.360]  and then I want to. There was a five-night, five-hour special aired in National British
[27:48.360 --> 27:53.400]  TV. The last two nights, we've aired it here and analyzed part one. They did a hour-long
[27:53.400 --> 27:59.200]  9-11 piece that, again, starts fair, but then tries to discredit, and I meant it as well.
[27:59.200 --> 28:02.840]  Tonight we're going to air about 15 minutes of it, and then next week on the next two
[28:02.840 --> 28:07.600]  live shows, we'll air another 30 minutes of it, and then we'll be done with that in
[28:07.600 --> 28:11.640]  a week or two, airing clips of it and analyzing it. So that's coming up in a few minutes as
[28:11.640 --> 28:18.880]  well, so please stay with us. Again, I want to say hi to all the PrisonPlanet.tv folks
[28:18.880 --> 28:24.840]  out there, and thank them for all the great stuff they do, and how they support freedom.
[28:24.840 --> 28:31.160]  We're going to go to that in a few minutes. I could spend hours on this next article.
[28:31.160 --> 28:43.000]  This is out of the Associated Press, and this is on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[28:43.000 --> 28:54.200]  Associated Press Dayton closes Washington office over safety concerns. Now, we turn
[28:54.200 --> 29:02.720]  these live shows in. They air five years from now. They air months from now. We don't pull
[29:02.720 --> 29:07.040]  our old tapes out because we believe in our track record, and we like it when you watch
[29:07.040 --> 29:11.800]  a show we did years ago, and then you're watching it now come true when you watch it many years
[29:11.800 --> 29:20.120]  from now. Just like on the July 25th, 2001 broadcast, I did two and a half hours. Back
[29:20.120 --> 29:24.680]  then we had a two and a half hour show on one night. I did two and a half hours saying
[29:24.680 --> 29:28.480]  call the White House. Bin Laden works for Bush. They're going to attack the World Trade
[29:28.480 --> 29:32.400]  Centers, and Bin Laden is going to take the blame. Call Bush. Tell them don't do it. That
[29:32.400 --> 29:38.640]  happened to air again as a rebroadcast on September 11th in the afternoon. We got some
[29:38.640 --> 29:43.480]  real hate calls that time. They thought I was just now blaming them. No, I did it two
[29:43.480 --> 29:51.160]  months before. I don't make many predictions, and I'm not going to give you a prediction
[29:51.160 --> 29:58.720]  this evening. I'm just going to give you a prime projection. Let me first say that I
[29:58.720 --> 30:06.480]  do not say that the government is going to blow up the U.S. Capitol and the District
[30:06.480 --> 30:11.880]  of Columbia. Let's be clear about that. I am not saying they're going to capture Bin
[30:11.880 --> 30:21.920]  Laden. I am not saying they're going to blow up the Capitol. They are saying it. Are they
[30:21.920 --> 30:28.760]  going to do it? I don't know. What I've said about Bin Laden is what I was told two and
[30:28.760 --> 30:36.480]  a half years ago. I rarely go to these media parties. I went to one of these events, and
[30:36.480 --> 30:43.680]  I saw a drunken White House official right after 9-11 who said, Alex, we all watch your
[30:43.680 --> 30:47.440]  show. Bush has been in the local newspaper saying he watches the show when he was governor.
[30:47.440 --> 30:53.760]  But this other White House official says, we watch the show, hiccuping, and he said,
[30:53.760 --> 30:58.640]  we've got Bin Laden on ice. We're going to roll him out right before the election. Then
[30:58.640 --> 31:04.440]  a former CIA analyst tells me this a few months later. This is two and a half years ago. Now
[31:04.440 --> 31:10.080]  in the last 10 months, Madeline Albright, former Secretary of State, Senator Grassley,
[31:10.080 --> 31:18.800]  a Republican, Theresa Hines, Kerry, all these big wigs have said Bin Laden is dead on ice.
[31:18.800 --> 31:24.040]  They're going to roll him out before the election. Well, now we're less than three weeks away.
[31:24.040 --> 31:28.960]  I don't know if they're going to roll Bin Laden now. I just know that I reported first
[31:28.960 --> 31:34.240]  that the White House people were talking about this two and a half years ago, and I said
[31:34.240 --> 31:38.920]  this could be disinfo in the news article we released about it that's on the website
[31:38.920 --> 31:46.880]  and on the shows we did. I don't know. I don't know what's going to happen. I just know I
[31:46.880 --> 31:51.640]  was told this and later this came out over and over again. But you heard it here first.
[31:51.640 --> 32:06.760]  I have no idea. Well, the same thing goes for this next article. Understand that three
[32:06.760 --> 32:13.200]  months ago, U.S. News and World Report, we posted that on the website, had the headline
[32:13.200 --> 32:20.040]  that the Capitol will be destroyed before the election and that there will be coast
[32:20.040 --> 32:30.240]  to coast massive attacks in the month of October. I did not say this. U.S. News and World Report
[32:30.240 --> 32:39.080]  quite respected said that a White House source told them this. Then a week later, Ridge came
[32:39.080 --> 32:45.800]  out and said, well, the Capitol is a target will probably be attacked. And then we had
[32:45.800 --> 32:50.560]  all these reports going back two years ago of the FBI and CIA saying we've been ordered
[32:50.560 --> 32:59.360]  to issue fake terror alerts. We've been ordered to come out and issue stuff to quote create
[32:59.360 --> 33:04.680]  hysteria. And then now major universities like Cornell put out psychological studies
[33:04.680 --> 33:09.000]  showing that approval ratings for the police state go up when they put out terror alerts
[33:09.000 --> 33:19.640]  common sense. I don't know if they're planning to blow up the Capitol. I just know the White
[33:19.640 --> 33:30.560]  House says it will happen. I tend to take that a little bit serious. Unnamed White House
[33:30.560 --> 33:37.280]  sources say the Capitol will be destroyed. There will be coast to coast attacks with
[33:37.280 --> 33:42.280]  the added caveat. What they said was there will be a huge attack, either the Capitol
[33:42.280 --> 33:51.280]  or coast to coast attacks will happen. Now, Gary Hart, the head of the CFR Fairmongering
[33:51.280 --> 33:55.880]  Commission Heart Rubin Commission said that Denver, Dallas and Cleveland would be attacked
[33:55.880 --> 34:01.200]  a year ago. It didn't happen. Will it happen? I don't know. They're now putting out fear
[34:01.200 --> 34:14.080]  about missing suitcase nukes. The globalist set off one suitcase nuk. They will be able
[34:14.080 --> 34:19.680]  to radically re-engineer our entire society through the fear they get unless we expose
[34:19.680 --> 34:23.920]  who has motive behind these attacks and then giving up our liberties doesn't keep us safe
[34:23.920 --> 34:34.320]  and they let the borders wide open. All of this is going on. Then we show you the secret
[34:34.320 --> 34:42.840]  documents about a month ago of a police officer who's also in the Texas State Guard, former
[34:42.840 --> 34:48.560]  regular Army, and we show the document where it says they're planning for roundups, mass
[34:48.560 --> 34:58.280]  arrest, martial law. A week later, the statesman does a front page article about it. Femal
[34:58.280 --> 35:02.320]  workers, homeland security workers who I know personally and others who've emailed me and
[35:02.320 --> 35:07.160]  written to me who are separate say that they've been told it is going to happen. It will happen.
[35:07.160 --> 35:12.440]  Give up all your rights and that they know the government's behind all this. I don't
[35:12.440 --> 35:17.960]  know if they're going to do this by exposing the planned stage capture of Ben Lawton who
[35:17.960 --> 35:23.920]  really died of natural causes. They may not pull that. By exposing that they plan to blow
[35:23.920 --> 35:30.880]  up the capital, they may not do it. I hope they don't do it. All I know is is they're
[35:30.880 --> 35:35.760]  training our government for martial law and have openly introduced us into the culture
[35:35.760 --> 35:40.360]  through Michelle Malkin and Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and all these people who
[35:40.360 --> 35:45.680]  say how good it is every day. Think how incredible and how well in that is that openly now they
[35:45.680 --> 35:52.160]  discuss all of this.
[35:52.160 --> 35:57.320]  So now let me read this final article and we'll go to this video clip. Dayton closes
[35:57.320 --> 36:05.240]  Washington office over safety concerns. This is today. Associated Press. Minnesota Senator
[36:05.240 --> 36:13.240]  Mark Dayton closed his office in DC citing security concerns. He says a top secret intelligence
[36:13.240 --> 36:23.200]  report made him fear for his staff safety. And he goes on to say if we had any information
[36:23.200 --> 36:28.560]  I would be forced to release it. He says particularly since I'm not going to be here in Washington
[36:28.560 --> 36:36.960]  to share the risk. I think it's immoral for me to leave them behind my staff knowing what
[36:36.960 --> 36:42.440]  I know and not being here with them. And he said that the leader of the Senate, Mr. Frisk
[36:42.440 --> 36:49.000]  told him that the capitals a big terror attack and it's probably going to get attacked and
[36:49.000 --> 36:55.400]  that they're not telling their staff and that a bunch of senators have been leaving town.
[36:55.400 --> 36:59.680]  Well this is exactly what was in US News and World Report three months ago. This is the
[36:59.680 --> 37:07.120]  exact type of crap we're talking about. So whether it's real or not physically terrorism
[37:07.120 --> 37:13.440]  in the old definition is an action to scare populations or individuals whether real or
[37:13.440 --> 37:21.000]  promulgated. The threat or the use of force to coerce a population to follow your political
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.680]  aims. They're telling us it's going to happen. They're gearing up for martial law. They're
[37:25.680 --> 37:30.360]  training the police and constabulary how to take over. They may not pull it this year.
[37:30.360 --> 37:34.680]  It may be next year or 10 years from now. The point is they're gearing up the infrastructure
[37:34.680 --> 37:44.920]  and they're issuing these fake terror alerts. They've been caught doing in the past. Dayton
[37:44.920 --> 37:50.880]  says he's asked Majority Leader Frisk to call a meeting of all senators to discuss the situation
[37:50.880 --> 37:58.200]  but Frisk has not done so. I take this step out of extreme but necessary precaution to
[37:58.200 --> 38:02.920]  protect the lives and safety of my Senate staff and my Minnesota constituents who might
[38:02.920 --> 38:07.400]  otherwise visit my office. In the next few weeks, Dayton said, I feel compelled to do
[38:07.400 --> 38:13.400]  so because I will not be here in Washington to share in what I consider to be an unacceptable
[38:13.400 --> 38:18.680]  greater risk to their safety. He went on to say that he will not enter his office or DC
[38:18.680 --> 38:25.480]  until at least after November 2nd. We were told months ago the martial law grid is from
[38:25.480 --> 38:31.680]  October 1st until January 1st and I've got this for mainstream news but before it was
[38:31.680 --> 38:37.000]  in mainstream news, I had it from FEMA, from Homeland Security, from State Police, from
[38:37.000 --> 38:46.160]  Police, from State Guard, from National Guard, from Special Forces Officers. So when you're
[38:46.160 --> 38:51.000]  watching this in a year from now, they haven't shut down access TV as they're trying to do
[38:51.000 --> 38:58.080]  and this hasn't happened. Thank God because we exposed it. We exposed it whether it was
[38:58.080 --> 39:06.120]  a fake terror alert like all the others based on 12 or 4-year-old intelligence or whether
[39:06.120 --> 39:12.640]  it was real, we'll never know. Or you may be watching this after a nuke goes off in
[39:12.640 --> 39:21.400]  Washington, DC. There's another caveat to this and that's that the government elements
[39:21.400 --> 39:26.560]  of it launched a weaponized anthrax attack on the Capitol, shut down most of the office
[39:26.560 --> 39:31.000]  buildings, had security in there interrogating senators when they passed the first Patriot
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.480]  Act. They could be using this as a climate of fear to get them to pass the new Super
[39:35.480 --> 39:43.600]  Patriot Act that even has a national ID card in it, you'll have to have to have a job.
[39:43.600 --> 39:47.360]  That they claims to stop illegal aliens but the illegal aliens are given a waiver in the
[39:47.360 --> 39:56.760]  bill and don't even have to do what citizens have to do. So here is the first 15 minutes
[39:56.760 --> 40:02.200]  or so of this British documentary, part 2, about 9-11. We'll air it, come back, I'll
[40:02.200 --> 40:07.040]  comment on it for 5 minutes, we'll decipher it and then we'll cover a few other articles
[40:07.040 --> 40:10.800]  and wrap up the show. The next week I'll air a couple more parts of this and finish
[40:10.800 --> 40:16.280]  it up. We're also now gotten where I was on CMT talking about the history of the militias.
[40:16.280 --> 40:22.040]  We'll be airing that too in the next few weeks and analyzing it, critiquing it. Let's go
[40:22.040 --> 40:28.520]  ahead and go to that tape and we'll be right back. So again, please stay with us, infowars.com,
[40:28.520 --> 40:36.080]  prisonplanet.com. We've also relaunched infowars.net. So here it is, September the 11th, 2001, the
[40:36.080 --> 40:44.800]  world watched as nearly 3,000 people were killed. Yet three years on, millions claimed
[40:44.800 --> 40:52.160]  there's another story, that the US government conspired to make 9-11 happen. I don't believe
[40:52.160 --> 41:02.080]  anybody believes this act of terrorism was carried out solely by Arab terrorists. We
[41:02.080 --> 41:09.000]  really believe that this government was involved in this complicity of 9-11. They've got blood
[41:09.000 --> 41:17.040]  on their hands. This film is about the 9-11 conspiracy theories. Fact or fiction, the
[41:17.040 --> 41:37.760]  questions they pose have revealed some extraordinary truths.
[41:37.760 --> 41:44.320]  Ben Mariani lost her husband, Luis Neal Mariani, on 9-11. But she doesn't blame Al Qaeda or
[41:44.320 --> 41:50.960]  Osama Bin Laden. On the morning of the attacks, she and her husband were taking different
[41:50.960 --> 41:56.600]  flights from Boston's Logan Airport to her daughter's wedding in Los Angeles. He kissed
[41:56.600 --> 42:03.120]  me then and he says, I love you honey, I'll see you, three minutes after your plane arrives,
[42:03.120 --> 42:14.760]  and I said, OK, OK, and he disappeared. And he was gone.
[42:14.760 --> 42:20.560]  As she changed planes in Chicago, Ellen Mariani's connecting flight was grounded, so she phoned
[42:20.560 --> 42:26.560]  her daughter. She was, where are you? And I said, what's the matter with you? She said,
[42:26.560 --> 42:31.480]  no, where are you? Are you all right? And I said, I'm at the terminal in Chicago. Something's
[42:31.480 --> 42:36.640]  wrong with my plane, so it's not coming in, go over to Neal's United Airlines terminal
[42:36.640 --> 42:40.840]  and pick him up. She said, no, no, no, there's something wrong with Neal's plane. So I hung
[42:40.840 --> 42:47.960]  up on her and I said to somebody, would you go find out what she's talking about? And
[42:47.960 --> 42:54.840]  he said, and he couldn't talk. What happened? What is going on? What did you find out? And
[42:54.840 --> 42:58.320]  he said, your husband's plane crashed.
[42:58.320 --> 43:14.800]  Louis Neal Mariani was on United Flight 175. He and 55 other passengers were killed instantly.
[43:14.800 --> 43:23.720]  Well, at first, I believed it was terrorists. And then I also thought, wait a minute, what's
[43:23.720 --> 43:28.680]  happened to our defense system? That was the first thing that hit me. And that's when
[43:28.680 --> 43:35.400]  I started to really feel that there was a question there. I want to know how my husband
[43:35.400 --> 43:40.680]  died and why he died and why he wasn't protected.
[43:40.680 --> 43:47.400]  Ellen Mariani contacted me and she said, I need a lawyer with guts because I want one
[43:47.400 --> 43:52.160]  thing. And I said, what's that? She said, not the money they've been offering because
[43:52.160 --> 43:55.520]  that's to shut me up. I want the truth.
[43:55.520 --> 44:00.120]  Ellen Mariani is going to court because she believes her husband is a victim of the biggest
[44:00.120 --> 44:04.600]  government conspiracy in US history. And she's not alone.
[44:04.600 --> 44:12.120]  When I see the images of 9-11, it raises a question in my mind. Is this event which
[44:12.120 --> 44:20.560]  became the basis for this famous worldwide war on terror, was it itself the ultimate
[44:20.560 --> 44:26.760]  act of terrorism, a state terrorism in modern times?
[44:26.760 --> 44:31.840]  The thousands of images from 9-11 also started a process of questioning that has created
[44:31.840 --> 44:37.800]  some remarkable assertions. A worldwide distrust of government motives has been given expression
[44:37.800 --> 44:42.480]  on the internet and credibility in books and newspapers.
[44:42.480 --> 44:46.440]  Millions now believe that a corrupt clique in the Bush administration, together with
[44:46.440 --> 44:51.640]  some of America's allies abroad, conspired to ensure the attacks happened.
[44:51.640 --> 44:58.680]  It is a very horrendous thought for me as an American to think that my own government might
[44:58.680 --> 45:06.440]  have carried out this kind of attack. And yet the story that we have been given by the
[45:06.440 --> 45:17.800]  White House, by the Pentagon, by the FBI and now by the 9-11 Commission does not make sense.
[45:17.800 --> 45:22.520]  David Ray Griffin is a respected theology professor, but his latest book chronicles
[45:22.520 --> 45:26.840]  the conspiracy theories that have grown up around 9-11.
[45:26.840 --> 45:33.680]  The basic question that has been raised by skeptics of the official theory about 9-11
[45:33.680 --> 45:41.640]  is whether the attacks were permitted or indeed even engineered by the Bush administration
[45:41.640 --> 45:47.240]  in order to carry out an agenda that it already had on the books.
[45:47.240 --> 45:51.920]  And here is that agenda, the military mission statement of a right-wing think tank, the
[45:51.920 --> 45:57.400]  project for the new American Century. Written a year before 9-11, it's supported by key
[45:57.400 --> 46:00.400]  members of the current Bush administration.
[46:00.400 --> 46:09.960]  The drafting was supervised by Cheney, by Donald Rumsfeldt, by Paul Wolfervitz, by
[46:09.960 --> 46:15.440]  Jeb Bush, who is the president's younger brother, and by Lewis Libby, who is Cheney's
[46:15.440 --> 46:24.640]  chief of staff. This is about control over Middle East oil. It indicates that America
[46:24.640 --> 46:31.560]  is aiming for global leadership, both military and economically, and what it says I think
[46:31.560 --> 46:39.760]  is chilling. It says if we are going to transform America into tomorrow's dominant force, that's
[46:39.760 --> 46:48.880]  their phrase, then it's going to be a long process unless there is a catastrophic and
[46:48.880 --> 46:55.440]  catalyzing event, dash like Pearl Harbor.
[46:55.440 --> 46:58.960]  Former British government minister Michael Meacher believes the U.S. government could
[46:58.960 --> 47:04.680]  have stopped 9-11 if it adhered to the numerous intelligence warnings.
[47:04.680 --> 47:08.600]  It is certainly not part of my thinking about this that the American government planned
[47:08.600 --> 47:13.280]  this. I think that is going far too far, but they certainly failed to take necessary efforts
[47:13.280 --> 47:19.840]  to prevent it. If 9-11 hadn't happened, are we to believe that the Bush administration
[47:19.840 --> 47:25.680]  would have been able to launch the war in Iraq and Afghanistan? I very much doubt it.
[47:25.680 --> 47:32.240]  Through the tears of sadness, I see an opportunity. You know, making a mistake about it, this
[47:32.240 --> 47:43.260]  nation is sad. But we're also tough and resolute. And now is an opportunity to do generation
[47:43.260 --> 47:50.480]  goals of favor by coming together and flipping terrorism.
[47:50.480 --> 47:55.680]  Ellen Mariani has become a hero to those who feel that the U.S. government let 9-11 happen
[47:55.680 --> 48:02.040]  or even planned it. Using anti-racketeering laws passed in the 70s to combat the mafia,
[48:02.040 --> 48:05.760]  she's taking the Bush administration to court.
[48:05.760 --> 48:10.440]  It's our position that there's a mob in the White House. Now, we know this is serious
[48:10.440 --> 48:16.200]  allegations. And it's very hard for the American public to want to accept the fact that their
[48:16.200 --> 48:22.520]  government would be involved in something as outrageous as this, the murdering of people.
[48:22.520 --> 48:28.480]  But we allege that the Bush administration had foreknowledge. They failed to warn. They
[48:28.480 --> 48:32.920]  failed to prevent. And since then, there's been a massive cover-up.
[48:32.920 --> 48:37.120]  Ellen Mariani's legal case centers on the first of the conspiracy theories that swirled
[48:37.120 --> 48:43.840]  around 9-11, that the president and his co-conspirators stood down American air defenses to let the
[48:43.840 --> 48:49.360]  attacks happen. How else could four hijacked planes fly unchallenged in American airspace
[48:49.360 --> 48:52.840]  for an hour and 47 minutes?
[48:52.840 --> 49:01.680]  67 times in the year before 9-11-01, planes were off course. And fighter jets responded.
[49:01.680 --> 49:10.640]  So where were the fighter jets on 9-11? It's more than incompetence. It's criminal.
[49:10.640 --> 49:16.840]  Where were they that day? My husband was four years in the air force. Where were his people?
[49:16.840 --> 49:26.000]  He protected our country. And when it came down to 9-11-01, nobody was protecting him.
[49:26.000 --> 49:35.720]  Do I feel that the government deliberately did this in our country where our loved ones
[49:35.720 --> 49:43.800]  were killed? Yes.
[49:43.800 --> 49:48.360]  Three years on, the failures of the Federal Aviation Administration and NORAD, the North
[49:48.360 --> 49:57.760]  Atlantic Air Defense, make millions of people suspect conspiracy.
[49:57.760 --> 50:04.000]  For some mysterious reason that day, everything broke down, the communication between the
[50:04.000 --> 50:11.920]  FAA and NORAD. And then NORAD responded very slowly. And then the fighter pilots responded
[50:11.920 --> 50:21.600]  very slowly. And you had all of these coincidences of great incompetence that day.
[50:21.600 --> 50:30.520]  The conspiracy theory is that it was stand-down. If a stand-down order were given, it probably
[50:30.520 --> 50:36.320]  would have to come from at least as high as the vice president.
[50:36.320 --> 50:42.280]  I am not a conspiracy theorist. It's very easy for a case like this to believe in a conspiracy.
[50:42.280 --> 50:47.960]  My instinct is to resist that and to look at the facts and find a more plausible, perhaps
[50:47.960 --> 50:55.680]  a more prosaic explanation. But it is pretty difficult. Given that this protocol existed,
[50:55.680 --> 51:00.520]  whereby fighter aircraft are put into the air as soon as commercial airliners go off-course
[51:00.520 --> 51:04.800]  to any significant degree, how can that not have happened?
[51:04.800 --> 51:11.120]  In November 2002, the Independent 9-11 Commission was established to take on the stand-down
[51:11.120 --> 51:18.480]  question and others. Five Democrats and five Republicans, including John Layman, Ronald
[51:18.480 --> 51:23.880]  Reagan's former Navy secretary, filed their final report this summer.
[51:23.880 --> 51:32.000]  We set out from the beginning to do our best to make these kinds of urban myths much more
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.480]  difficult by doing everything in the open.
[51:34.480 --> 51:37.280]  Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth?
[51:37.280 --> 51:40.120]  We had 19 days of public hearings.
[51:40.120 --> 51:42.800]  Thank you very much.
[51:42.800 --> 51:49.640]  Every rumor that circulated on the World Wide Web, we have examined, and they've been pouring
[51:49.640 --> 51:55.560]  in from the very beginning. And many of them have proved very useful leads, and we've run
[51:55.560 --> 51:57.560]  them all to ground.
[51:57.560 --> 52:02.400]  In the process, the Commission has uncovered disturbing evidence of just how vulnerable
[52:02.400 --> 52:09.440]  America was to attack on 9-11. Intelligence warnings about al-Qaeda were ignored. Lax airport
[52:09.440 --> 52:16.280]  security let armed hijackers board planes. Air traffic and defense systems were totally
[52:16.280 --> 52:23.120]  unprepared for suicide attacks using passenger planes as guided missiles. The following exchange
[52:23.120 --> 52:27.520]  took place between Boston Air Traffic Control and the military as the first plane approached
[52:27.520 --> 52:28.520]  Manhattan.
[52:28.520 --> 52:34.680]  Hi, Boston Center, TNU. We have a problem here. We have a hijack aircraft headed towards
[52:34.680 --> 52:40.000]  New York, and we need you guys to, we need someone to scramble some of the 16s or something
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  up there to help us out.
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  Is this real world or exercise?
[52:43.000 --> 52:52.920]  No, this is not an exercise, not a test.
[52:52.920 --> 52:59.920]  Defense agencies assumed the hijackers would want to survive, but they were wrong.
[52:59.920 --> 53:07.720]  A later exchange is between two controllers running New York's airspace as the second
[53:07.720 --> 53:09.720]  plane veered off course.
[53:09.720 --> 53:25.040]  Get somebody to keep the closing, but it looks like he's going into one of the small airpots
[53:25.040 --> 53:26.040]  down there.
[53:26.040 --> 53:27.040]  Do you know who he is?
[53:27.040 --> 53:28.040]  We just, we just, we don't know who he is. We're just picking him up now.
[53:28.040 --> 53:29.040]  All right, head shot, man. It looks like another one.
[53:29.040 --> 53:30.040]  All right.
[53:30.040 --> 53:43.800]  Even after the third plane hit the Pentagon, senior air traffic managers faltered.
[53:43.800 --> 53:44.800]  Do we want to think about scrambling aircraft?
[53:44.800 --> 53:45.800]  Oh, God, I don't know.
[53:45.800 --> 53:46.800]  That's a decision somebody's going to have to make probably in the next 10 minutes.
[53:46.800 --> 53:47.800]  You know, everybody just left the room.
[53:47.800 --> 54:06.920]  The chaos within air traffic control and the US air defenses went from top to bottom, but
[54:06.920 --> 54:09.920]  the commission found no evidence of a stand down order.
[54:09.920 --> 54:15.520]  However, by investigating the questions asked by the conspiracy theorists, the commission
[54:15.520 --> 54:23.200]  exposed something the politicians would have preferred to remain secret.
[54:23.200 --> 54:28.040]  In the years after the end of the Cold War, the air defenses guarding America's capital
[54:28.040 --> 54:31.400]  and financial center had been dismantled.
[54:31.400 --> 54:37.600]  There was a great feeling when the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War was over that
[54:37.600 --> 54:39.520]  would be a great peace dividend.
[54:39.520 --> 54:45.960]  So the very existence of the North Atlantic Air Defense Command was called into question
[54:45.960 --> 54:48.280]  because where would the threat come from?
[54:48.280 --> 54:53.440]  No one thought as they were struggling in the Pentagon to keep some semblance of air
[54:53.440 --> 54:59.360]  defense to justify it on the basis of kamikaze type threats within the United States.
[54:59.360 --> 55:04.160]  It was outward looking, not looking in to deal with a threat that was already in the United
[55:04.160 --> 55:12.960]  States.
[55:12.960 --> 55:19.720]  The system had been turned off and only a very few bases with a very few airplanes left
[55:19.720 --> 55:21.520]  on standby to do this mission.
[55:21.520 --> 55:28.720]  There was no chance that any of those aircraft could have been shot down.
[55:28.720 --> 55:35.320]  Now how do I counter those 15 minutes of lies and then they bring me into the mix and we'll
[55:35.320 --> 55:36.320]  air that next week.
[55:36.320 --> 55:37.800]  You can watch that here.

[55:49.200 --> 55:56.200]  Look, I should have had notes in here for all of this, this is incredible.
[55:56.200 --> 56:01.120]  They'd never heard of a plan to fly hijacked jets into buildings and have dozens of articles
[56:01.120 --> 56:03.440]  mainstream news before 9-11.
[56:03.440 --> 56:09.960]  On the morning of 9-11, the CIA admittedly was running a drill of flying hijacked jets
[56:09.960 --> 56:13.000]  into the World Trade Center in Pentagon.
[56:13.000 --> 56:18.760]  Now I got this from Stanley Hilton, Bob Dole's former chief of staff, months before it even
[56:18.760 --> 56:21.720]  came out in the Associated Press in 2002.
[56:21.720 --> 56:25.680]  He said I've deposed high level military officers, I'm suing Bush for government involvement
[56:25.680 --> 56:29.880]  in 9-11 and they said that the reason they stood down is they were told it was an exercise.
[56:29.880 --> 56:32.520]  You notice that clip they played of an air traffic controller?
[56:32.520 --> 56:35.200]  He said is this real world or an exercise?
[56:35.200 --> 56:38.700]  And then while we're going to launch jets, the second plane said everybody just walked
[56:38.700 --> 56:40.200]  out of the room.
[56:40.200 --> 56:44.680]  Dick Cheney was in control at the bunker that's now been admitted and they said is the order
[56:44.680 --> 56:45.680]  still standing?
[56:45.680 --> 56:48.080]  He said yes for a stand down.
[56:48.080 --> 56:50.600]  They were running five drills that morning.
[56:50.600 --> 56:56.360]  They ran a drill of hijacked jets in November of 2000 flying into the Pentagon and CIA and
[56:56.360 --> 56:57.440]  World Trade Center.
[56:57.440 --> 57:05.080]  They ran a drill six weeks before so their story they never heard of such a plan is ridiculous.
[57:05.080 --> 57:07.560]  And they call it the Independent 9-11 Commission.
[57:07.560 --> 57:11.840]  You just saw British television say it's independent.
[57:11.840 --> 57:15.960]  It was appointed by George Bush.
[57:15.960 --> 57:23.960]  Bill Frisk is in business with the Carl Hall group and the Bin Laden family.
[57:23.960 --> 57:29.560]  Chairman Key is in business with these people.
[57:29.560 --> 57:32.840]  The head of the committee, the head staffer, wrote a book with Connolly Siris.
[57:32.840 --> 57:36.400]  If no one knew this was going on, why did Mayor Willie Brown get a call from Connolly
[57:36.400 --> 57:40.400]  Siris, National Security Advisor the night before saying don't fly to that meeting in
[57:40.400 --> 57:42.840]  DC tomorrow morning?
[57:42.840 --> 57:44.200]  In New York tomorrow morning.
[57:44.200 --> 57:47.400]  Why did the Joint Chiefs of Staff get told about the flight to New York that morning?
[57:47.400 --> 57:49.160]  They told Newsweek that.
[57:49.160 --> 57:51.480]  They stood down because they were told it's a drill.
[57:51.480 --> 57:55.880]  Then you ask well then how they get those Arabs to fly planes into buildings?
[57:55.880 --> 58:02.600]  Those Arabs were part of a three-year, we now have the documents, Stanley Hilton has them,
[58:02.600 --> 58:09.200]  were part of a three-year drill practicing what to do if hijackers hijacked jets and
[58:09.200 --> 58:10.360]  flew them into buildings.
[58:10.360 --> 58:16.160]  They were CIA agents, officers, assets.
[58:16.160 --> 58:20.200]  Their homes, their cars, their credit cards were paid for by the U.S. government.
[58:20.200 --> 58:21.600]  That's admitted.
[58:21.600 --> 58:26.080]  They were trained at U.S. military bases, then created their phony ledger of trying to fly
[58:26.080 --> 58:30.920]  sestans at different private schools the year before 9-11.
[58:30.920 --> 58:35.400]  Remember actor James Woods a week before 9-11 was on a flight with these five guys who he
[58:35.400 --> 58:37.520]  said were simulating a hijacking?
[58:37.520 --> 58:41.400]  Then he got off the plane and called the FBI and they came and said shut your mouth, it's
[58:41.400 --> 58:44.120]  national security Mr. Woods.
[58:44.120 --> 58:52.320]  So these Arabs who were at a topless bar the night before think they're part of a drill.
[58:52.320 --> 58:53.640]  Those are the names we know.
[58:53.640 --> 58:57.240]  At least nine of the 19 have now been found to be still alive, but the others were admitted
[58:57.240 --> 58:58.960]  intelligence officers.
[58:58.960 --> 59:04.240]  They're on board thinking it's a drill, nerve gas is released, this is from our sources.
[59:04.240 --> 59:08.200]  They kill everybody on board, then they remote control those planes into buildings.
[59:08.200 --> 59:12.800]  We have the official U.S. government plan called Operation Northwoods where they describe
[59:12.800 --> 59:19.560]  how to do this from decades ago, declassified.
[59:19.560 --> 59:21.280]  Now I'm sorry if you can't face that.
[59:21.280 --> 59:25.440]  They showed British environment minister number three guy in the Blair government saying oh
[59:25.440 --> 59:31.560]  Operation PNAC, I don't think they were involved, but they let it happen because PNAC says we
[59:31.560 --> 59:37.160]  need a catalyzing Pearl Harbor helpful event, folks they carried this sound like Hitler
[59:37.160 --> 59:42.720]  in the Reichstag, like Nero in Rome, like the USS Maine, like the USS Liberty.
[59:42.720 --> 59:44.520]  The Gulf of Tonkin never happened.
[59:44.520 --> 59:46.680]  That's now admitted to have been fake.
[59:46.680 --> 59:48.800]  They just claimed an attack happened that didn't happen.
[59:48.800 --> 59:50.880]  Now they actually carry them out.
[59:50.880 --> 59:52.840]  That is the facts.
[59:52.840 --> 59:58.080]  And next week we will air the rest of it and really dissect it in the next two live shows
[59:58.080 --> 59:59.080]  we do.
[59:59.080 --> 01:00:07.600]  And again, the websites are infowars.com, they are prisonplanet.com, they are infowars.net.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:13.240]  And just God bless you all, get out there and fight the new world order and expose this
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:32.400]  to another colony.
