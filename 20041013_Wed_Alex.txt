[00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:49.846]  Hello, it is October 13, 2004, and I am your host Alex Jones, and tonight we're going to air that third part, some of it which we didn't get a chance to play last night, of a national British documentary on Sky Television News, the British affiliate of Fox, basically, a corporation of News Corp, where they try to basically
[00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:56.436]  Discredit conspiracy theories about the Illuminati.
[00:00:56.436 --> 00:01:00.077]  So we're going to finish up by playing about 10-15 minutes of this.
[00:01:00.077 --> 00:01:04.778]  Then I'm going to come back with some very important news concerning a U.S.
[00:01:04.778 --> 00:01:06.779]  Senator evacuating from the U.S.
[00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:19.743]  Capitol saying he was given intelligence that there would be a big attack on the Capitol and that he cannot in conscience leave himself as other Senators are leaving and at the same time then
[00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:23.919]  Leave his staff there.
[00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:26.060]  That and a bunch of other news.
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:38.123]  Some of the latest developments of the National ID Card are coming up in about 15 minutes after we air the last 15 minutes of this hour-long special that aired on National British Television.
[00:01:38.123 --> 00:01:49.365]  Then, I'm going to air about 15 minutes of an hour-long special that I was also in concerning 9-11, which is really a propaganda piece
[00:01:50.613 --> 00:01:57.475]  It starts out fair and then tries to discredit basically those who are exposing 9-1-1 and government involvement.
[00:01:57.475 --> 00:02:00.596]  So that is coming up as well tonight.
[00:02:00.596 --> 00:02:12.999]  So a lot of news and two different segments from national British television concerning the Illuminati, the controllers, of course, of the 9-11 attacks.
[00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:18.561]  And coming up next week with our two live TV shows, I will play
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:29.127]  Several other segments and finish up this British 9-11 film that has not been seen yet here in the United States.
[00:02:29.127 --> 00:02:31.269]  So that's coming up.
[00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.870]  Stay with us.
[00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:41.217]  We'll be back in just a few minutes after we conclude this Illuminati piece that just aired in England a few weeks ago.
[00:02:41.217 --> 00:02:45.401]  Then we'll get into the news that's really important that affects us all.
[00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:46.962]  So please call your friends and family.
[00:02:46.962 --> 00:02:48.103]  Tell them to tune in.
[00:02:48.103 --> 00:02:49.544]  This is information you do not want to miss.
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.824]  We'll go ahead and roll now the piece about the Illuminati.
[00:02:53.824 --> 00:02:55.406]  We'll come back and comment on it.
[00:02:55.406 --> 00:02:57.388]  So again, please stay with us.
[00:02:57.388 --> 00:03:05.597]  My search for the elusive Illuminati is proving far more complex than I'd hoped.
[00:03:05.597 --> 00:03:11.444]  But occasionally, I'm told, we are allowed glimpses of them through their secret, sometimes satanic, signs.
[00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:22.185]  Make no mistake about it, these men believe that ritual, hand signs, symbols, bring power.
[00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:28.630]  And when you get to that stage, I believe you become demon possessed.
[00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:37.657]  And these demonic signs and symbols of the Illuminati are all around us.
[00:03:37.657 --> 00:03:40.119]  Especially, it seems, in downtown Austin.
[00:03:47.591 --> 00:04:05.806]  I've been told that this building holds a kind of special significance for the Illuminati, because the Illuminati apparently worship owls, and they say this building looks a bit like an owl.
[00:04:05.806 --> 00:04:10.050]  I'll be honest, I can't really see it myself, but I'm not getting much of an owl vibe from this.
[00:04:16.468 --> 00:04:27.216]  The owl that I can't see is Molech again, named after an ancient Middle Eastern god.
[00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:29.698]  So, what is this building?
[00:04:29.698 --> 00:04:30.879]  Well, it's a new building in Austin.
[00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.901]  It's the Frost Bank Building.
[00:04:32.901 --> 00:04:37.564]  The two circles on each side of the beak and then the crown, that's the crest of the owl's horns.
[00:04:37.564 --> 00:04:38.305]  It's got the eyes.
[00:04:38.305 --> 00:04:39.366]  It's got the beak.
[00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:40.547]  It's an owl.
[00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:43.749]  And it's kind of like the Illuminati mascot, one of their mascots.
[00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.310]  The skull and bones is one.
[00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.131]  The other is the owl.
[00:04:46.775 --> 00:04:50.782]  The Illuminati come out of kind of the secret mystery architecture schools.
[00:04:50.782 --> 00:04:53.787]  So they use architecture as a way to communicate their views.
[00:04:53.787 --> 00:04:56.231]  So basically this is a giant idol to Moloch.
[00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:58.728]  Rick, this is an idol.
[00:04:58.728 --> 00:04:59.409]  Yes.
[00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.250]  And so this is kind of how they communicate to us.
[00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.892]  It's hidden in plain view, if it is hidden at all.
[00:05:03.892 --> 00:05:12.058]  And is it, I mean, in a way, from what I've kind of learned this far about the Illuminati, it's kind of quite fitting that it's a hidden thing that is amongst us.
[00:05:12.058 --> 00:05:12.939]  Hidden amongst us.
[00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:13.920]  That's what they love.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.782]  Because the profane can't see it because we're unconscious.
[00:05:18.677 --> 00:05:21.739]  But why owls?
[00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:23.321]  What, I mean, that's kind of wild.
[00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:27.264]  Well, we always hear that, oh, it's the god of wisdom, going back to the Greeks.
[00:05:27.264 --> 00:05:30.106]  The owl also sees in the dark.
[00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:31.427]  He's all-seeing.
[00:05:31.427 --> 00:05:35.129]  But whereas his prey is blind in the night, so it's the king of the night.
[00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:42.515]  So it's kind of like a double meaning, whereas the all-seeing eye, the illuminated one, it only illuminates for those that are part of it.
[00:05:42.515 --> 00:05:43.156]  It's an owl.
[00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:45.958]  But also, they can rotate their heads.
[00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:46.278]  Can't they?
[00:05:46.278 --> 00:05:47.139]  They see behind them.
[00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:47.559]  That's right.
[00:05:49.178 --> 00:05:49.979]  Not that one.
[00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.001]  I don't mean the building.
[00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:56.485]  You know, always notice in every city, the biggest buildings are the bank buildings, towering above us.
[00:05:56.485 --> 00:06:02.510]  And now around the country, buildings are being affixed with owl effigies.
[00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.295]  There's others around the nation.
[00:06:07.295 --> 00:06:08.516]  So these are their monuments.
[00:06:21.331 --> 00:06:28.596]  Now that Alex has pointed out that it looks like an owl, this building, it is quite difficult not to see an owl.
[00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:31.919]  I mean, certainly from this angle, it is owl-like.
[00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.941]  From round the... you know, from face on, it's just a building.
[00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:47.350]  But... but it does seem that Austin is dominated by this... big owl.
[00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.733]  As well as the owl, there's another symbol favoured by the Illuminati.
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.242]  And this symbol also goes back to ancient times.
[00:06:58.242 --> 00:07:02.204]  The Illuminati operates in a pyramidal power structure.
[00:07:02.204 --> 00:07:05.825]  That's why the Illuminati symbol is the pyramid.
[00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:14.589]  A tiny enlightened elite and a giant dumbed-down mass beneath them.
[00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:20.892]  And that Illuminati symbol, the pyramid, appears on that great American symbol, the dollar bill.
[00:07:22.216 --> 00:07:27.059]  We're going to be looking today at our $1 bill.
[00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:29.880]  Our $1 bill!
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.462]  It has two very odd seals on it.
[00:07:33.462 --> 00:07:41.366]  And it's very interesting that the Illuminati had a great hand to play in choosing those seals.
[00:07:41.366 --> 00:07:44.427]  Here's your United States $1 bill.
[00:07:44.427 --> 00:07:51.271]  On the back, you can clearly see the all-seeing eye of knowledge from the pyramid.
[00:07:52.023 --> 00:08:02.147]  And I suspect this represents the Illuminati at the top of the pyramid and then all of the poor ignorant folks making up the bulk of the structure.
[00:08:02.147 --> 00:08:06.569]  You've got the Latin inscription that says, Norvus Ordo Seclorum.
[00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.290]  Seclorum means the material world, the secular world.
[00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.491]  That's where the word secular comes from.
[00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:14.193]  And Novus is new and Ordo is the globe of the world.
[00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:17.374]  So you could translate this as the new world order.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:27.506]  And the people who are behind it are the people who control the money, and we're back to the Illuminati.
[00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:29.327]  There's lots of occult stuff on here.
[00:08:29.327 --> 00:08:35.852]  And the endgame of the Illuminati, their favorite thing is to hide everything in plain view so that we're conditioned to accept our slavery.
[00:08:35.852 --> 00:08:36.953]  They're all seeing eyes.
[00:08:36.953 --> 00:08:38.554]  They're pyramids.
[00:08:38.554 --> 00:08:40.175]  They believe they get power from this.
[00:08:40.175 --> 00:08:44.158]  And it's also how they communicate with their own esoteric language with each other.
[00:08:44.158 --> 00:08:47.101]  So that's what you're saying about, you know, these clues are everywhere.
[00:08:47.101 --> 00:08:49.683]  Like the giant Owl Tower in the middle of Austin.
[00:08:49.683 --> 00:08:49.883]  Yes.
[00:08:52.628 --> 00:08:54.949]  Well, I think I've got the hang of the owl.
[00:08:54.949 --> 00:09:01.571]  But now I'm intrigued by this New World Order concept that's on the dollar bill.
[00:09:01.571 --> 00:09:06.553]  Could you explain to me the difference between the Illuminati and the New World Order?
[00:09:06.553 --> 00:09:07.133]  Okay.
[00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:10.674]  Well, the Illuminati, let's say, is the head and the brain.
[00:09:10.674 --> 00:09:13.515]  And then when I punch you in the face, that's the New World Order.
[00:09:13.515 --> 00:09:16.456]  The New World Order is what the Illuminati is building.
[00:09:16.932 --> 00:09:29.981]  It's their goal, it's their thrust, and the Illuminati is the creator, and their goal is the new world order, world government, global governance, world tyranny.
[00:09:29.981 --> 00:09:35.405]  What if they do achieve their goal of total globalization?
[00:09:35.405 --> 00:09:44.391]  What is our guarantee that some new Hitler-like tyrant won't gain control?
[00:09:44.391 --> 00:09:45.312]  And, I'm told,
[00:09:45.993 --> 00:09:51.237]  That's precisely what the Illuminati has in store for us.
[00:09:51.237 --> 00:09:56.761]  The mission of the Illuminati is what the mission of any elite has been throughout history, to maintain power and control.
[00:09:56.761 --> 00:10:05.428]  And to do that, they've got to dumb down and completely enslave the population.
[00:10:05.428 --> 00:10:08.771]  And if the population would become just half as informed,
[00:10:09.517 --> 00:10:19.949]  About the history of the New World Order and the Illuminati controllers as they are about football or baseball or basketball, then we'd be a much freer and happier society.
[00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:25.094]  And my mission is to wake people up.
[00:10:25.094 --> 00:10:29.840]  Governor Perry, from time to time we return here to engage in the First Amendment.
[00:10:30.777 --> 00:10:37.221]  And to expose your Illuminati activities, being a servant of Bush and the Skull and Bones Cabal and the New World Order.
[00:10:37.221 --> 00:10:42.584]  It's an information warfare tool to expose corruption and evil, and what the Illuminati's up to.
[00:10:42.584 --> 00:10:46.807]  Why do you Illuminati thugs think you're gods I'll never understand?
[00:10:46.807 --> 00:10:48.988]  But I'm here to tell you you're not my god!
[00:10:48.988 --> 00:10:50.129]  Are you allowed to do this?
[00:10:50.797 --> 00:10:52.598]  Well, they'd like to say we aren't, but we have a First Amendment.
[00:10:52.598 --> 00:10:53.618]  Yes, I've done this many times.
[00:10:53.618 --> 00:10:56.259]  So you're invoking the free speech?
[00:10:56.259 --> 00:10:56.780]  That's right.
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.580]  Just very loud free speech.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.022]  More and more people are waking up to the corruption that is government.
[00:11:02.022 --> 00:11:06.344]  The organized crime syndicate that is the New World Order!
[00:11:06.344 --> 00:11:14.307]  You need to stop enslaving us, and you need to stop serving your Illuminati globalist masters, Governor!
[00:11:14.307 --> 00:11:16.628]  I really, really hope he's in.
[00:11:20.359 --> 00:11:24.520]  But are Alex Jones's protests in vain?
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.702]  Are the fears of the conspiracy theorists legitimate?
[00:11:28.702 --> 00:11:32.863]  Are we already inside the New World Order?
[00:11:32.863 --> 00:11:44.507]  The Illuminati doctrine seemed to be getting a tighter and tighter chokehold on the world, but yet on the other hand there is a backlash and there is a resistance, so
[00:11:45.592 --> 00:11:50.699]  I see it as kind of a race as to who's going to get control first.
[00:11:50.699 --> 00:12:00.232]  The people who would tyrannize their fellow man or the people of good heart who would like to see true freedom and democracy.
[00:12:02.895 --> 00:12:13.241]  We're already inside the New World Order, and their endgame is a world population of only about 250 to 500 million people living in a Big Brother society.
[00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:16.023]  Every action, every motion, everything we do, tracked and traced.
[00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:26.802]  We see now the technological capability.
[00:12:26.802 --> 00:12:35.465]  Listen, these guys, the Illuminati today, they have a capability that Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin didn't have.
[00:12:35.465 --> 00:12:41.187]  I've dedicated the rest of my life to exposure of this knowledge, because I think it's evil.
[00:12:41.187 --> 00:12:46.569]  They are going to force drug in a Brave New World type scenario, almost the entire population.
[00:12:50.319 --> 00:12:59.324]  It's the ultimate power trip, completely out of control, and humanity has got to wake up to this elite, face the facts of history, and it's got to be done now.
[00:12:59.324 --> 00:13:10.070]  And I hope people will rally to this cry and stand up against the New World Order and the Illuminati masters that have built it.
[00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:15.574]  So just how much have I learned about the Illuminati on my journey?
[00:13:15.574 --> 00:13:16.974]  Well, amongst other things...
[00:13:18.513 --> 00:13:21.195]  And... And... But I still have many questions.
[00:13:21.195 --> 00:13:25.678]  I mean, does the fact that Mr. A never turned up in Hartford mean the Illuminati don't exist?
[00:13:25.678 --> 00:13:30.582]  Or does it mean they do exist because they got to Mr. A with their blood-curdling forfeits?
[00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:49.653]  And just think of all the other things I've been told.
[00:13:49.653 --> 00:13:54.337]  They have antenna arrays that monitor all electronic signals.
[00:13:54.337 --> 00:13:58.060]  And, it's got the eyes, it's got the beak, it's an owl!
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:03.024]  And, they have names like Magog, and God.
[00:14:03.024 --> 00:14:08.749]  And, they collect body parts and do strange rituals in their coffins.
[00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:10.871]  Isn't it all too far-fetched?
[00:14:10.871 --> 00:14:12.272]  Just all too unbelievable?
[00:14:16.474 --> 00:14:18.634]  The Illuminati just couldn't exist.
[00:14:18.634 --> 00:14:19.675]  Could it?
[00:14:19.675 --> 00:14:20.295]  Hello, my friends.
[00:14:20.295 --> 00:14:22.475]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:14:22.475 --> 00:14:36.638]  Mr. A from that piece,
[00:14:45.854 --> 00:14:48.876]  I did that interview with Mr. A about two months ago.
[00:14:48.876 --> 00:14:55.942]  He goes out to this town in London and claims he's gonna let him meet the Illuminati, but then the Illuminati doesn't show up, so everything's discredited.
[00:14:55.942 --> 00:15:07.191]  They can't discredit anything we said in the film, so they go, as I said, and manufacture this staged event with an individual I called an actor last night.
[00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:13.116]  Because they can't discredit the facts, they bring in somebody to then not have something show up to discredit that.
[00:15:13.116 --> 00:15:15.278]  Then I talked to my webmaster, Paul Watson,
[00:15:16.252 --> 00:15:19.873]  Today, on the telephone, he said, Alex, you were out of town last Friday.
[00:15:19.873 --> 00:15:21.934]  You went with your family to the beach.
[00:15:21.934 --> 00:15:25.395]  You didn't see what I posted on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:15:25.395 --> 00:15:28.856]  And I said, no, Paul, I didn't.
[00:15:28.856 --> 00:15:41.239]  Well, we happen to have the big, local, mainstream, 200-year established newspaper, and they have Mr. A., Tim
[00:15:45.692 --> 00:16:13.176]  Egson in the article, the guy you saw in that car who couldn't bring you the Illuminati, and he said, I'm the Illuminati, and he took them and showed them secret tunnels underneath the castle into the judges chambers and all of the city, and then the Illuminati came forward, and it's in the paper, it's a six-page article, and said, yes, this is where it was based originally, which is actually true that a lot of it got set up in Germany and then moved to England, and he just says, I'm a member of the Illuminati.
[00:16:13.826 --> 00:16:30.074]  So, when he's not discrediting us by not showing up and not producing Mr. A, it turns out that he and his twin brother are Mr. A. In fact, Mike, come in here and give folks a close shot of this.
[00:16:30.074 --> 00:16:38.518]  And if you go to PrisonPlanet.com and click on last Friday, well, today's the 13th and it's Wednesday, so back on the 8th or 9th.
[00:16:40.184 --> 00:16:44.707]  You can click on one of the top stories at PrisonPlanet.com that I wasn't even aware of.
[00:16:44.707 --> 00:16:47.889]  And I was here saying this was obviously a staged deal.
[00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:52.292]  And here he is in the local newspaper going, yes, we're the Illuminati.
[00:16:52.292 --> 00:16:54.553]  And the paper laughed at him.
[00:16:54.553 --> 00:16:58.896]  So he took them and showed them the underground chambers where they do the rituals and the rest of it.
[00:16:58.896 --> 00:17:03.679]  And they talked to local officials and they said, well, yes, it's a town secret that we have an Illuminati base here.
[00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:06.300]  And they showed them all of the areas.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.822]  So you just saw in the film made a few months ago
[00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:32.761]  Just released a few weeks ago that Mr. A didn't show up so the Illuminati doesn't exist and we're all a bunch of kooks and then all the sudden this guy is in the paper saying no I'm a member of the Illuminati and they laugh at him so he takes them and shows them all the secret passages and then the mayor and everybody else pops out and says yes it's all true ha ha ha.
[00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:35.622]  So you go to PrisonPlanet.com and you click on
[00:17:36.452 --> 00:17:37.853]  Last Friday's edition.
[00:17:37.853 --> 00:17:39.274]  There's a calendar there.
[00:17:39.274 --> 00:17:48.039]  You can go read this article or just type in the secrets of underground Hartford into a major search engine like Google.
[00:17:48.039 --> 00:17:57.024]  The secrets of underground Hartford and a direct link, I believe it's the second link, will pop up for you.
[00:17:57.024 --> 00:17:59.066]  Again, I didn't know this last night.
[00:17:59.066 --> 00:18:02.988]  I just got this documentary a few days ago, watched it, and here's this guy
[00:18:03.906 --> 00:18:10.688]  Again, we're talking about government documents, world history, the encyclopedia, skull and bones, real things.
[00:18:10.688 --> 00:18:12.629]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[00:18:12.629 --> 00:18:21.471]  They produced this five-hour special, one of the hour shows, during prime time in England, on the biggest network in England, Sky Television.
[00:18:21.471 --> 00:18:22.472]  Is there an Illuminati?
[00:18:22.472 --> 00:18:32.875]  And they go, oh, well, it's kind of discredited, because we went and met with a guy in Hartford, England, and he said we were going to meet with the Illuminati, and then they didn't show up.
[00:18:33.877 --> 00:18:48.480]  And then, a week or so after it comes out on national British television, it says, the secrets of underground Hartford, a secret labyrinth of tunnels under Hartford streets, have been revealed to the Mercury.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:59.202]  Members of the Knights Templar Secret Society, which still has members in the town, have spoken for the first time about the underground lair used by their forebearers almost 1,000 years ago.
[00:18:59.202 --> 00:19:02.163]  And then they go and they show the whole thing.
[00:19:02.163 --> 00:19:03.703]  And they've got all the public officials admitting it.
[00:19:04.344 --> 00:19:17.914]  emanating from the dungeons of Hartford Castle from 4th Street to passages run like a warren into the ancient county town and stretch from Bluecoats to County Hall, according to the group, and they went and did an inspection of it.
[00:19:17.914 --> 00:19:25.900]  Today, many of the entrances to the subterranean passages have been bricked up, but according to the modern-day Knights, some are still in use and may even be booby-trapped.
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:32.325]  Too fantastic to be true, reporter Raymond Brown investigates at a secret location in the town, Tim
[00:19:33.817 --> 00:19:39.719]  Akerson declared, we are now prepared to reveal a secret we feel the people of Harvard should be made aware of.
[00:19:39.719 --> 00:19:43.720]  There is an extensive labyrinth right under our feet.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:52.243]  Then it goes on to say in a Sky Television news piece, this guy didn't reveal that he was Illuminati, but now he's willing to tell us.
[00:19:53.326 --> 00:20:01.709]  So regardless, we're talking about facts, we're talking about history, we're talking about global mafias that work through secret societies.
[00:20:01.709 --> 00:20:06.291]  And they admit the Italian mob, the Glucosa Nostra, has rituals and is a secret society.
[00:20:06.291 --> 00:20:11.453]  Well, the big WASP mob is too.
[00:20:11.453 --> 00:20:14.955]  White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Mafia.
[00:20:14.955 --> 00:20:16.715]  WASP Mafia.
[00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:17.716]  And it goes through all this.
[00:20:19.162 --> 00:20:45.397]  Instead of discrediting one thing I said, or Tex Mars said, or Jim Mars said, or Galen Ross said, former NSA officer Galen Ross, former Air Force officer, space and aeronautics professor Tex Mars, Jim Mars, award-winning journalist, instead of discrediting what we say, which they can't do, they go out and have a staged deal with somebody who claims to be a member of the Illuminati, and has town elders vouching for him,
[00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:51.843]  He goes out and acts like it doesn't exist and makes people look stupid.
[00:20:51.843 --> 00:20:59.106]  And I said that instinctively, looking at that guy and what they did.
[00:20:59.106 --> 00:21:04.709]  So, that's the type of propaganda that we're dealing with, that we're facing here.
[00:21:04.709 --> 00:21:14.833]  And I suggest you go read this lengthy article at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:14.833 --> 00:21:14.993]  Now,
[00:21:15.743 --> 00:21:20.505]  Let's talk about some things that we can absolutely, totally, 100% prove.
[00:21:20.505 --> 00:21:35.251]  A couple weeks ago, they come out and admit that the hepatitis B shot almost quadruples, 3.7 times, increases your chance of getting muscular sclerosis.
[00:21:35.251 --> 00:21:40.633]  Since they started giving the meningitis shot, people who take it, deaths of meningitis have increased 17.6%.
[00:21:46.863 --> 00:21:51.726]  They've been caught putting the AIDS virus, HIV virus, in shots in Africa and Asia.
[00:21:51.726 --> 00:21:52.947]  That's mainstream news.
[00:21:52.947 --> 00:21:57.370]  Nobel laureates are now exposing it.
[00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.690]  But I don't want to spend all night on this.
[00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.472]  I've got a bunch of other important news I want to cover.
[00:22:01.472 --> 00:22:09.977]  But before we get to all the other news, here is the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:22:09.977 --> 00:22:15.901]  And the San Francisco Chronicle is carrying, on their website, an Associated Press article.
[00:22:17.794 --> 00:22:24.976]  Grand Jury Investigating Flu Vaccine Failure.
[00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:31.357]  Now, let's go over this.
[00:22:31.357 --> 00:22:36.598]  I could spend an hour on this, but I'm going to spend about two minutes on it.
[00:22:36.598 --> 00:22:44.920]  About three weeks ago, independent laboratories in the United States and England tested this company's flu vaccine.
[00:22:46.388 --> 00:22:52.312]  They wondered why the more flu vaccines we take the more flu deaths we have.
[00:22:52.312 --> 00:23:01.857]  They tested vaccine and it had live super flu virus in it.
[00:23:01.857 --> 00:23:12.404]  And so I went on radio and TV and I said the current flu vaccine they're shipping to you is contaminated.
[00:23:12.404 --> 00:23:14.305]  But by the time it made it to the statesman
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:28.191]  And the Dallas Morning News and all the other papers, and local radio and TV I've watched and listened to, it was, gee, only half the flu vaccine we need was made.
[00:23:28.191 --> 00:23:35.377]  Boy, you better run out and get your shot like it's, you know, some Christmas toy that's in demand that people are lining up to get.
[00:23:35.377 --> 00:23:37.699]  They create this false fad that, God, you gotta have it.
[00:23:38.743 --> 00:23:45.065]  And publicly, admittedly, it's because all the flu vaccine made by the company that supplies half the U.S.
[00:23:45.065 --> 00:23:53.648]  population, admittedly, was putting live flu virus in the vaccines.
[00:23:53.648 --> 00:23:55.809]  Giving you a souped up flu.
[00:23:58.524 --> 00:24:04.047]  And now England is in the grips of a deadly flu epidemic and people are dying by the tens of thousands.
[00:24:04.047 --> 00:24:05.367]  40,000 people die on average a year in the U.S.
[00:24:05.367 --> 00:24:06.228]  from the flu vaccine.
[00:24:06.228 --> 00:24:13.851]  By the way, this same company last year contaminated the flu vaccine because I happen to have a memory and save these articles and go back and look at it.
[00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:15.572]  But they know you're not paying attention.
[00:24:15.572 --> 00:24:26.057]  Oh, you know all the football and basketball players and who they are and how much money they make and what the score was in the 1985 Super Bowl, but oh, you can't have a memory when it comes to deadly flu vaccines.
[00:24:29.548 --> 00:24:33.070]  They're adding other stuff to it, by the way.
[00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:47.717]  And in this San Francisco Chronicle article, they admit that the vaccines made in Liverpool Plant were contaminated with live flu virus.
[00:24:47.717 --> 00:24:49.178]  This is October 12th.
[00:24:49.178 --> 00:24:58.543]  Now, this was admitted a few weeks ago, but this is the only mainstream news article I could find, this Associated Press article posted in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:24:59.528 --> 00:25:05.489]  That admitted that it was because it was contaminated with live flu virus.
[00:25:05.489 --> 00:25:14.731]  When you hear about it, it's oh my god there's a shortage we better go out and get our shots.
[00:25:14.731 --> 00:25:23.613]  And the exception to the rule is when vaccines are not contaminated.
[00:25:23.613 --> 00:25:28.114]  Bill Gates, Prince Philip, Ted Turner,
[00:25:29.568 --> 00:25:32.530]  The names go on and on.
[00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:44.180]  Give billions of dollars of their own money to, quote, ensure that the third world populations get their shots.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:57.031]  And when independent groups test it, they find hormones to sterilize women, added to the pathogen, live AIDS virus, cancer viruses, you name it.
[00:25:57.031 --> 00:25:58.332]  That's just a fact, folks.
[00:25:59.398 --> 00:26:02.039]  So you go ahead and you go take your vaccines.
[00:26:02.039 --> 00:26:10.824]  Remember that CBS piece a few weeks ago we played locally, a national piece, they aired locally, where they said the government now says mercury is actually good for your child's brain.
[00:26:10.824 --> 00:26:12.064]  Go ahead and take your shots.
[00:26:12.064 --> 00:26:14.566]  Yeah, we haven't taken the mercury out like we said we would.
[00:26:14.566 --> 00:26:16.026]  We actually increased it.
[00:26:16.026 --> 00:26:20.689]  Mercury is nutritious for you.
[00:26:20.689 --> 00:26:23.170]  Then they find gullible doctors in town
[00:26:24.457 --> 00:26:31.562]  To go out, who feel good about their profession, and we're not doing wrong, the AMA says it's good, to tell you how great all this is.
[00:26:31.562 --> 00:26:38.227]  I'm just going off the scientists, the epidemiologists, and the admissions.
[00:26:38.227 --> 00:26:44.632]  You got a bunch of eugenics control freaks running this country.
[00:26:44.632 --> 00:26:46.193]  They trained Hitler, folks.
[00:26:46.193 --> 00:26:47.954]  Margaret Singer.
[00:26:47.954 --> 00:26:50.656]  And, it's happening.
[00:26:50.656 --> 00:26:50.816]  Now,
[00:26:55.601 --> 00:26:57.422]  I can't spend all night on vaccines.
[00:26:57.422 --> 00:26:58.622]  You better check it out for yourself.
[00:26:58.622 --> 00:27:00.522]  You better spend some time and research this.
[00:27:00.522 --> 00:27:11.165]  And you better remember that there is no law that you've got to take a vaccine, but every TV station and every newspaper in this country that I looked at before school started said it's the law.
[00:27:11.165 --> 00:27:13.486]  You've got to take these shots when there is no law.
[00:27:14.193 --> 00:27:28.582]  And for the regulation, there is a waiver in every principal and every nurse's drawer, and your children didn't have to take it, but they made you go to a sports stadium under threat of being kicked out of school and then being arrested for truancy and take their shots.
[00:27:28.582 --> 00:27:30.803]  Boy, they sure care about you, don't they?
[00:27:30.803 --> 00:27:33.264]  You better find out what's in those.
[00:27:33.264 --> 00:27:37.547]  We know what's in them.
[00:27:37.547 --> 00:27:42.450]  Now, I want to go through some other news quickly, and then I want to
[00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:47.771]  There was a five-night, five-hour special aired on National British TV.
[00:27:47.771 --> 00:27:52.292]  The last two nights, we've aired it here and analyzed part one.
[00:27:52.292 --> 00:27:57.372]  They did an hour-long 9-11 piece that again starts fair, but then tries to discredit.
[00:27:57.372 --> 00:27:58.913]  And I'm in it as well.
[00:27:58.913 --> 00:28:01.473]  Tonight, we're going to air about 15 minutes of it.
[00:28:01.473 --> 00:28:06.194]  And then next week, on the next two live shows, we'll air another 30 minutes of it.
[00:28:06.194 --> 00:28:10.295]  And then we'll be done with that in a week or two, airing clips of it and analyzing it.
[00:28:10.295 --> 00:28:12.755]  So that's coming up in a few minutes as well, so please stay with us.
[00:28:15.506 --> 00:28:24.715]  And again, I want to say hi to all the PrisonPlanet.tv folks out there and thank them for all the great stuff they do and how they support freedom.
[00:28:24.715 --> 00:28:28.678]  We're going to go to that in a few minutes.
[00:28:28.678 --> 00:28:31.041]  I could spend hours on this next article.
[00:28:31.041 --> 00:28:40.389]  This is out of the Associated Press and this is on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com
[00:28:43.024 --> 00:28:51.950]  Associated Press, Dayton closes Washington office over safety concerns.
[00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:57.874]  Now, we turn these live shows in, they air five years from now.
[00:28:57.874 --> 00:29:02.096]  They air months from now.
[00:29:02.096 --> 00:29:12.163]  We don't pull our old tapes out because we believe in our track record and we like it when you watch a show we did years ago and then you're watching it now come true when you watch it many years from now.
[00:29:13.522 --> 00:29:18.827]  Just like on the July 25th 2001 broadcast.
[00:29:18.827 --> 00:29:19.988]  I did two and a half hours.
[00:29:19.988 --> 00:29:23.611]  Back then we had a two and a half hour show on one night.
[00:29:23.611 --> 00:29:25.672]  I did two and a half hours saying call the White House.
[00:29:25.672 --> 00:29:27.274]  Bin Laden works for Bush.
[00:29:27.274 --> 00:29:30.677]  They're going to attack the World Trade Centers and Bin Laden's going to take the blame.
[00:29:30.677 --> 00:29:31.217]  Call Bush.
[00:29:31.217 --> 00:29:32.238]  Tell them don't do it.
[00:29:32.238 --> 00:29:38.143]  That happened to air again as a rebroadcast on September 11th in the afternoon.
[00:29:38.143 --> 00:29:39.924]  We got some real hate calls that time.
[00:29:39.924 --> 00:29:41.786]  They thought I was just now blaming them.
[00:29:42.719 --> 00:29:44.920]  No, I did it two months before.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.261]  I don't make many predictions.
[00:29:48.261 --> 00:29:51.943]  And I'm not going to give you a prediction this evening.
[00:29:51.943 --> 00:29:56.845]  I'm just going to give you a prime projection.
[00:29:56.845 --> 00:30:05.029]  Let me first say that I do not say that the government is going to blow up the U.S.
[00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:08.190]  Capitol and the District of Columbia.
[00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.011]  Let's be clear about that.
[00:30:10.011 --> 00:30:12.212]  I am not saying they're going to capture bin Laden.
[00:30:13.087 --> 00:30:18.869]  I am not saying they're going to blow up the Capitol.
[00:30:18.869 --> 00:30:21.730]  They are saying it.
[00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:23.070]  Are they going to do it?
[00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:26.491]  I don't know.
[00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:30.112]  What I've said about Bin Laden is what I was told two and a half years ago.
[00:30:30.112 --> 00:30:33.794]  I rarely go to these media parties.
[00:30:33.794 --> 00:30:40.796]  I went to one of these events, and I saw a drunken White House official, right after 9-11,
[00:30:41.952 --> 00:30:44.133]  Who said, Alex, we all watch your show.
[00:30:44.133 --> 00:30:47.355]  And Bush has been in the local newspaper saying he watches the show when he was governor.
[00:30:47.355 --> 00:30:51.257]  But this other White House official says, we watch the show.
[00:30:51.257 --> 00:30:52.277]  Hiccuping.
[00:30:52.277 --> 00:30:55.379]  And he said, we got Bin Laden on ice.
[00:30:55.379 --> 00:30:58.260]  We're going to roll him out right before the election.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.142]  Then a former CIA analyst tells me this a few months later.
[00:31:02.142 --> 00:31:04.364]  This is two and a half years ago.
[00:31:04.364 --> 00:31:10.707]  Now in the last ten months, Madeleine Albright, former Secretary of State, Senator Grassley, a Republican,
[00:31:12.307 --> 00:31:18.671]  Theresa Hines, Kerry, all these bigwigs have said Bin Laden is dead on ice.
[00:31:18.671 --> 00:31:20.412]  They're going to roll him out before the election.
[00:31:20.412 --> 00:31:24.134]  Well now we're less than three weeks away.
[00:31:24.134 --> 00:31:26.516]  I don't know if they're going to roll Bin Laden out.
[00:31:26.516 --> 00:31:38.143]  I just know that I reported first that the White House people were talking about this two and a half years ago and I said this could be disinfo in the news article we released about it.
[00:31:38.143 --> 00:31:40.225]  It's on the website and on the shows we did.
[00:31:40.225 --> 00:31:40.665]  I don't know.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.401]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:31:46.401 --> 00:31:49.762]  I just know I was told this, and later this came out over and over again.
[00:31:49.762 --> 00:31:51.562]  But you heard it here first.
[00:31:51.562 --> 00:31:51.782]  Why?
[00:31:51.782 --> 00:31:55.043]  I have no idea.
[00:31:55.043 --> 00:32:02.085]  Well, the same thing goes for this next article.
[00:32:02.085 --> 00:32:08.086]  Understand that three months ago, U.S.
[00:32:08.086 --> 00:32:10.867]  News and World Report, and we posted that on the website,
[00:32:12.193 --> 00:32:26.503]  Have the headline that the Capitol will be destroyed before the election and that there will be coast-to-coast massive attacks in the month of October.
[00:32:26.503 --> 00:32:28.885]  I did not say this.
[00:32:28.885 --> 00:32:29.265]  U.S.
[00:32:29.265 --> 00:32:34.649]  News & World Report, quite respected, said that a White House source told them this.
[00:32:37.796 --> 00:32:45.302]  Then a week later, Ridge came out and said, well, the Capitol is a target, will probably be attacked.
[00:32:45.302 --> 00:32:52.107]  And then we had all these reports going back two years ago of the FBI and CIA saying, we've been ordered to issue fake terror alerts.
[00:32:52.107 --> 00:32:56.731]  We've been ordered to come out and
[00:32:57.768 --> 00:33:00.409]  Issue stuff to, quote, create hysteria.
[00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:09.173]  And then now, major universities like Cornell put out psychological studies showing that approval ratings for the police state go up when they put out terror alerts.
[00:33:09.173 --> 00:33:15.776]  Common sense.
[00:33:15.776 --> 00:33:18.998]  I don't know if they're planning to blow up the Capitol.
[00:33:18.998 --> 00:33:24.600]  I just know the White House says it will happen.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.321]  I tend to take that a little bit serious.
[00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:33.562]  Unnamed White House sources say the Capitol will be destroyed.
[00:33:33.562 --> 00:33:37.163]  There will be coast-to-coast attacks.
[00:33:37.163 --> 00:33:46.625]  With the added caveat, what they said was there will be a huge attack, either the Capitol or coast-to-coast attacks.
[00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:48.866]  Will happen.
[00:33:48.866 --> 00:33:56.447]  Now Gary Hart, the head of the CFR Fairmongering Commission, Hart-Rubin Commission, said that Denver, Dallas, and Cleveland would be attacked a year ago.
[00:33:56.447 --> 00:33:57.508]  It didn't happen.
[00:33:57.508 --> 00:33:58.288]  Will it happen?
[00:33:58.288 --> 00:33:58.728]  I don't know.
[00:34:00.154 --> 00:34:04.497]  They're now putting out fear about missing suitcase nukes.
[00:34:04.497 --> 00:34:18.508]  If the globalists set off one suitcase nuke, they will be able to radically re-engineer our entire society through the fear they get.
[00:34:18.508 --> 00:34:25.233]  Unless we expose who has motive behind these attacks, and then giving up our liberties doesn't keep us safe, and they want the borders wide open.
[00:34:31.485 --> 00:34:33.146]  So all of this is going on.
[00:34:33.146 --> 00:34:50.856]  Then we show you the secret documents about a month ago of a police officer who's also in the Texas State Guard, former regular Army, and we show the document where it says they're planning for roundups, mass arrest, martial law.
[00:34:50.856 --> 00:34:54.798]  A week later, the statesman does a front page article about it.
[00:34:57.708 --> 00:35:12.196]  FEMA workers, Homeland Security workers, who I know personally, and others who've emailed me and written to me, who are separate, say that they've been told it is going to happen, it will happen, give up all your rights, and that they know the government's behind all this.
[00:35:12.196 --> 00:35:14.017]  I don't know if they're going to do this.
[00:35:14.017 --> 00:35:21.622]  By exposing the planned staged capture of bin Laden, who really died of natural causes, they may not pull that.
[00:35:21.622 --> 00:35:25.824]  By exposing that they plan to blow up the Capitol, they may not do it.
[00:35:26.656 --> 00:35:29.819]  I hope they don't do it.
[00:35:29.819 --> 00:35:42.088]  All I know is they're training our government for martial law and have openly introduced this into the culture through Michelle Malkin and Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and all these people who say how good it is every day.
[00:35:42.088 --> 00:35:52.096]  Think how incredible and Orwellian that is that openly now they discuss all of this.
[00:35:52.096 --> 00:35:54.698]  So now let me read this final article and we'll go to this video clip.
[00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:59.570]  Dayton closes Washington office over safety concerns.
[00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:00.530]  This is today.
[00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:04.212]  Associated Press.
[00:36:04.212 --> 00:36:09.893]  Minnesota Senator Mark Dayton closed his office in D.C.
[00:36:09.893 --> 00:36:11.374]  citing security concerns.
[00:36:11.374 --> 00:36:17.076]  He says a top secret intelligence report made him fear for his staff's safety.
[00:36:17.076 --> 00:36:24.578]  And he goes on to say, if we had any information, I would be forced to release it.
[00:36:25.177 --> 00:36:39.869]  He says, particularly since I'm not going to be here in Washington to share the risk, I think it's immoral for me to leave them behind, my staff, knowing what I know and not being here with them.
[00:36:39.869 --> 00:36:52.880]  And he said that the leader of the Senate, Mr. Frisk, told him that the Capitol's a big terror attack and it's probably going to get attacked and that they're not telling their staff and that a bunch of senators have been leaving town.
[00:36:55.262 --> 00:36:57.404]  Well, this is exactly what was in U.S.
[00:36:57.404 --> 00:36:59.346]  News & World Report three months ago.
[00:36:59.346 --> 00:37:02.389]  This is the exact type of crap we're talking about.
[00:37:02.389 --> 00:37:14.200]  So whether it's real or not, physically, terrorism in the old definition is an action to scare populations or individuals, whether real or promulgated.
[00:37:15.316 --> 00:37:21.740]  The threat or the use of force to coerce a population to follow your political aims.
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.881]  They're telling us it's going to happen.
[00:37:23.881 --> 00:37:25.602]  They're gearing up for martial law.
[00:37:25.602 --> 00:37:29.064]  They're training the police and constabulary how to take over.
[00:37:29.064 --> 00:37:30.325]  They may not pull it this year.
[00:37:30.325 --> 00:37:32.406]  It may be next year or ten years from now.
[00:37:32.406 --> 00:37:38.810]  The point is they're gearing up the infrastructure and they're issuing these fake terror alerts they've been caught doing in the past.
[00:37:44.688 --> 00:37:52.115]  Dayton says he's asked Majority Leader Frisk to call a meeting of all senators to discuss the situation, but Frisk has not done so.
[00:37:54.793 --> 00:38:06.658]  I take this step out of extreme but necessary precaution to protect the lives and safety of my Senate staff and my Minnesota constituents who might otherwise visit my office in the next few weeks, Dayton said.
[00:38:06.658 --> 00:38:15.482]  I feel compelled to do so because I will not be here in Washington to share in what I consider to be an unacceptable greater risk to their safety.
[00:38:15.482 --> 00:38:18.803]  He went on to say that he will not enter his office or D.C.
[00:38:18.803 --> 00:38:20.664]  until at least after November 2nd.
[00:38:22.808 --> 00:38:28.933]  We were told months ago the martial law grid is from October 1st until January 1st.
[00:38:28.933 --> 00:38:45.828]  And I've got this for mainstream news, but before it was in mainstream news, I had it from FEMA, from Homeland Security, from State Police, from Police, from State Guard, from National Guard, from Special Forces officers.
[00:38:45.828 --> 00:38:50.152]  So when you're watching this in a year from now, they haven't shut down access TV as they're trying to do,
[00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.852]  And this hasn't happened, thank God!
[00:38:54.852 --> 00:38:56.933]  Because we exposed it.
[00:38:56.933 --> 00:39:08.879]  We exposed it, whether it was a fake terror alert, like all the others, you know, based on twelve or four-year-old intelligence, or whether it was real, we'll never know.
[00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:13.482]  Or you may be watching this after a nuke goes off in Washington, D.C.
[00:39:17.366 --> 00:39:31.535]  There's another caveat to this, and that's that the government elements of it launched a weaponized anthrax attack on the Capitol, shut down most of the office buildings, had security in there interrogating senators when they passed the first Patriot Act.
[00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:40.241]  They could be using this as a climate of fear to get them to pass the new super Patriot Act that even has a national ID card in it you'll have to have to have a job.
[00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:50.314]  That they claim to stop illegal aliens, but the illegal aliens are given a waiver in the bill and don't even have to do what citizens have to do.
[00:39:50.314 --> 00:40:01.061]  So, here is the first 15 minutes or so of this British documentary, Part 2, about 9-11.
[00:40:01.061 --> 00:40:04.983]  We'll air it, come back, I'll comment on it for five minutes, we'll decipher it,
[00:40:05.526 --> 00:40:08.128]  And then we'll cover a few other articles and we'll wrap up the show.
[00:40:08.128 --> 00:40:11.530]  Then next week I'll air a couple more parts of this and finish it up.
[00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:16.353]  We're also now gotten where I was on CMT talking about the history of the militias.
[00:40:16.353 --> 00:40:21.796]  We'll be airing that too in the next few weeks and analyzing it, critiquing it.
[00:40:21.796 --> 00:40:25.859]  Let's go ahead and go to that tape and we'll be right back.
[00:40:25.859 --> 00:40:27.460]  So again, please stay with us.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.722]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:40:29.722 --> 00:40:31.523]  We've also relaunched Infowars.net.
[00:40:32.483 --> 00:40:33.124]  So here it is.
[00:40:33.124 --> 00:40:36.046]  September the 11th, 2001.
[00:40:36.046 --> 00:40:42.512]  The world watched as nearly 3,000 people were killed.
[00:40:42.512 --> 00:40:46.475]  Yet three years on, millions claim there's another story.
[00:40:46.475 --> 00:40:47.196]  That the U.S.
[00:40:47.196 --> 00:40:51.600]  government conspired to make 9-11 happen.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:59.947]  I don't believe anybody believes this act of terrorism was carried out solely by Arab terrorists.
[00:41:01.807 --> 00:41:07.389]  We really believe that this government was involved in this complicity of 9-11.
[00:41:07.389 --> 00:41:11.550]  They've got blood on their hands.
[00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:15.551]  This film is about the 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[00:41:15.551 --> 00:41:20.192]  Fact or fiction, the questions they pose have revealed some extraordinary truths.
[00:41:37.637 --> 00:41:42.480]  Ellen Mariani lost her husband, Louis Neil Mariani, on 9-11.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:47.864]  But she doesn't blame Al-Qaeda or Osama Bin Laden.
[00:41:47.864 --> 00:41:56.110]  On the morning of the attacks, she and her husband were taking different flights from Boston's Logan Airport to her daughter's wedding in Los Angeles.
[00:41:56.110 --> 00:42:04.836]  He kissed me then, and he says, I love you, honey, I'll see you three minutes after your plane arrives, mine arrives.
[00:42:04.836 --> 00:42:05.897]  And I said, OK, OK.
[00:42:06.852 --> 00:42:09.394]  Um, and he disappeared.
[00:42:09.394 --> 00:42:14.719]  And he was gone.
[00:42:14.719 --> 00:42:19.944]  As she changed planes in Chicago, Ellen Mariani's connecting flight was grounded.
[00:42:19.944 --> 00:42:21.986]  So she phoned her daughter.
[00:42:21.986 --> 00:42:23.828]  She was, where are you?
[00:42:24.645 --> 00:42:26.146]  And I said, what's the matter with you?
[00:42:26.146 --> 00:42:27.427]  She said, no, where are you?
[00:42:27.427 --> 00:42:28.608]  Are you all right?
[00:42:28.608 --> 00:42:31.250]  And I said, I'm at the terminal in Chicago.
[00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.431]  Something's wrong with my plane, so it's not coming in.
[00:42:33.431 --> 00:42:37.754]  Go over to Neil's United Airline Terminal and pick him up.
[00:42:37.754 --> 00:42:40.456]  She said, no, no, no, there's something wrong with Neil's plane.
[00:42:40.456 --> 00:42:46.381]  So I hung up on her and I said to somebody, would you go find out what she's talking about?
[00:42:46.381 --> 00:42:48.622]  And he stared at me.
[00:42:48.622 --> 00:42:51.064]  He couldn't talk.
[00:42:51.064 --> 00:42:51.604]  What happened?
[00:42:51.604 --> 00:42:52.645]  What's going on?
[00:42:52.645 --> 00:42:53.566]  What did you find out?
[00:42:54.702 --> 00:42:58.283]  And he said your husband's plane crashed.
[00:42:58.283 --> 00:43:07.626]  Louis Neil Mariani was on United Flight 175.
[00:43:07.626 --> 00:43:18.109]  He and 55 other passengers were killed instantly.
[00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:20.130]  Well, at first, I believed it was terrorists.
[00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:25.875]  And then I also thought, wait a minute, what's happened to our defense system?
[00:43:25.875 --> 00:43:28.156]  That was the first thing that hit me.
[00:43:28.156 --> 00:43:34.101]  And that's when I started to really feel that there was a question there.
[00:43:34.101 --> 00:43:37.184]  I want to know how my husband died and why he died.
[00:43:37.184 --> 00:43:40.706]  And why he wasn't protected.
[00:43:40.706 --> 00:43:47.732]  Ellen Mariani contacted me and she said, I need a lawyer with guts because I want one thing.
[00:43:48.758 --> 00:43:49.619]  And I said, what's that?
[00:43:49.619 --> 00:43:53.642]  She said, not the money they've been offering, because that's to shut me up.
[00:43:53.642 --> 00:43:55.384]  I want the truth.
[00:43:55.384 --> 00:44:02.870]  Ellen Mariani is going to court because she believes her husband is a victim of the biggest government conspiracy in US history.
[00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.491]  And she's not alone.
[00:44:04.491 --> 00:44:16.782]  When I see the images of 9-11, it raises the question in my mind, is this event, which became the basis for this famous worldwide war on terror,
[00:44:17.552 --> 00:44:26.715]  Was it itself the ultimate act of terrorism, of state terrorism, in modern times?
[00:44:26.715 --> 00:44:34.278]  The thousands of images from 9-11 also started a process of questioning that has created some remarkable assertions.
[00:44:34.278 --> 00:44:40.960]  A worldwide distrust of government motives has been given expression on the internet and credibility in books and newspapers.
[00:44:42.159 --> 00:44:52.949]  Millions now believe that a corrupt clique in the Bush administration, together with some of America's allies abroad, conspired to ensure the attacks happened.
[00:44:52.949 --> 00:45:01.677]  It is a very horrendous thought for me as an American to think that my own government might have carried out this kind of attack.
[00:45:02.947 --> 00:45:17.735]  And yet the story that we have been given by the White House, by the Pentagon, by the FBI, and now by the 9-11 Commission, does not make sense.
[00:45:17.735 --> 00:45:24.958]  David Ray Griffin is a respected theology professor, but his latest book chronicles the conspiracy theories that have grown up around 9-11.
[00:45:24.958 --> 00:45:30.141]  The basic question that has been raised by skeptics of the
[00:45:30.965 --> 00:45:47.193]  The official theory about 9-11 is whether the attacks were permitted or indeed even engineered by the Bush administration in order to carry out an agenda that it already had on the books.
[00:45:47.193 --> 00:45:48.934]  And here is that agenda.
[00:45:48.934 --> 00:45:54.597]  The military mission statement of a right-wing think tank, the Project for the New American Century.
[00:45:54.597 --> 00:45:59.379]  Written a year before 9-11, it's supported by key members of the current Bush administration.
[00:46:00.402 --> 00:46:19.074]  The drafting was supervised by Cheney, by Donald Rumsfeld, by Paul Wolfowitz, by Jeb Bush, who's the President's younger brother, and by Lewis Levy, who's Cheney's Chief of Staff.
[00:46:19.074 --> 00:46:21.236]  This is about control over Middle East oil.
[00:46:22.194 --> 00:46:33.737]  It indicates that America is aiming for global leadership, both military and economically, and what it says, I think, is chilling.
[00:46:33.737 --> 00:46:40.539]  It says, if we are going to transform America into tomorrow's dominant force, that's their phrase,
[00:46:41.371 --> 00:46:55.279]  Then it's going to be a long process, unless there is a catastrophic and catalyzing event, dash like Pearl Harbor.
[00:46:55.279 --> 00:47:02.963]  Former British government minister Michael Meacher believes the US government could have stopped 9-11, if it had heeded the numerous intelligence warnings.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:09.302]  It is certainly not part of my thinking about this that the American government planned this.
[00:47:09.302 --> 00:47:10.802]  I think that is going far too far.
[00:47:10.802 --> 00:47:15.504]  But they certainly failed to take necessary efforts to prevent it.
[00:47:15.504 --> 00:47:23.787]  If 9-11 hadn't happened, are we to believe that the Bush administration would have been able to launch the war in Iraq and Afghanistan?
[00:47:23.787 --> 00:47:26.969]  I very much doubt it.
[00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:31.210]  Through the tears of sadness, I see an opportunity.
[00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:32.991]  Make no mistake about it, this nation is sad.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.502]  But we're also tough and resolute.
[00:47:38.502 --> 00:47:50.468]  And now's an opportunity to do generations a favour by coming together and whipping terrorism.
[00:47:50.468 --> 00:47:57.952]  Ellen Mariani has become a hero to those who feel that the US government let 9-11 happen, or even planned it.
[00:47:57.952 --> 00:48:04.035]  Using anti-racketeering laws passed in the 70s to combat the mafia, she's taking the Bush administration to court.
[00:48:05.663 --> 00:48:08.886]  It's our position that there's a mob in the White House.
[00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:22.357]  Now, we know this is serious allegations, and it's very hard for the American public to want to accept the fact that their government would be involved in something as outrageous as this, the murdering of people.
[00:48:22.357 --> 00:48:31.424]  But we allege that the Bush administration had foreknowledge, they failed to warn, they failed to prevent, and since then there's been a massive cover-up.
[00:48:32.887 --> 00:48:38.472]  Ellen Mariani's legal case centers on the first of the conspiracy theories that swirl around 9-11.
[00:48:38.472 --> 00:48:45.359]  That the President and his co-conspirators stood down American air defenses to let the attacks happen.
[00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:53.407]  How else could four hijacked planes fly unchallenged in American airspace for an hour and 47 minutes?
[00:48:53.407 --> 00:48:55.409]  67 times in the year before 9-11-01,
[00:48:57.395 --> 00:49:01.596]  Planes were off course and fighter jets responded.
[00:49:01.596 --> 00:49:04.976]  So where were the fighter jets on 9-11?
[00:49:04.976 --> 00:49:06.797]  It's more than incompetence.
[00:49:06.797 --> 00:49:10.518]  It's criminal.
[00:49:10.518 --> 00:49:12.278]  Where were they that day?
[00:49:12.278 --> 00:49:14.638]  My husband was four years in the Air Force.
[00:49:14.638 --> 00:49:16.779]  Where were his people?
[00:49:16.779 --> 00:49:18.839]  He protected our country.
[00:49:18.839 --> 00:49:20.819]  And when it came down to 9-11, 2001, nobody was protecting him.
[00:49:25.914 --> 00:49:41.208]  Do I feel that the government deliberately did this in our country where our loved ones were killed?
[00:49:41.208 --> 00:49:43.630]  Yes.
[00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:52.218]  Three years on, the failures of the Federal Aviation Administration and NORAD, the North Atlantic Air Defense, make millions of people suspect conspiracy.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:02.723]  For some mysterious reason that day, everything broke down.
[00:50:02.723 --> 00:50:05.925]  The communication between the FAA and NORAD.
[00:50:05.925 --> 00:50:09.087]  And then NORAD responded very slowly.
[00:50:09.087 --> 00:50:13.570]  And then the fighter pilots responded very slowly.
[00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:21.575]  And you had all of these coincidences of great incompetence that day.
[00:50:21.575 --> 00:50:23.176]  The conspiracy theory.
[00:50:24.034 --> 00:50:26.175]  Is that it was stand-down.
[00:50:26.175 --> 00:50:36.418]  If a stand-down order were given, it probably would have to come from at least as high as the Vice President.
[00:50:36.418 --> 00:50:38.739]  I am not a conspiracy theorist.
[00:50:38.739 --> 00:50:42.240]  It's very easy in a case like this to believe in a conspiracy.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:50.162]  My instinct is to resist that and to look at the facts and find a more plausible, perhaps a more prosaic explanation.
[00:50:50.162 --> 00:50:51.663]  But it is pretty difficult.
[00:50:52.735 --> 00:51:03.685]  Given that this protocol existed whereby fighter aircraft are put into the air as soon as commercial airliners go off course to any significant degree, how can that not have happened?
[00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:14.454]  In November 2002, the Independent 9-11 Commission was established to take on the stand-down question and others.
[00:51:14.454 --> 00:51:22.437]  Five Democrats and five Republicans, including John Layman, Ronald Reagan's former Navy Secretary, filed their final report this summer.
[00:51:23.777 --> 00:51:34.324]  We set out from the beginning to do our best to make these kinds of urban myths much more difficult by doing everything in the open.
[00:51:34.324 --> 00:51:37.186]  Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth?
[00:51:37.186 --> 00:51:39.648]  We had 19 days of public hearings.
[00:51:39.648 --> 00:51:41.068]  I do.
[00:51:41.068 --> 00:51:42.609]  Thank you very much.
[00:51:42.609 --> 00:51:50.895]  Every rumor that circulated on the World Wide Web we have examined and they've been pouring in from the very beginning.
[00:51:51.611 --> 00:51:57.813]  And many of them have proved very useful leads, and we've run them all to ground.
[00:51:57.813 --> 00:52:05.435]  In the process, the Commission has uncovered disturbing evidence of just how vulnerable America was to attack on 9-11.
[00:52:05.435 --> 00:52:08.676]  Intelligence warnings about Al-Qaeda were ignored.
[00:52:08.676 --> 00:52:14.077]  Lacks airport security let armed hijackers board planes.
[00:52:14.077 --> 00:52:20.599]  Air traffic and defense systems were totally unprepared for suicide attacks using passenger planes as guided missiles.
[00:52:22.122 --> 00:52:28.028]  The following exchange took place between Boston Air Traffic Control and the military as the first plane approached Manhattan.
[00:52:28.028 --> 00:52:31.291]  Alright, Boston Center, TMU.
[00:52:31.291 --> 00:52:32.713]  We have a problem here.
[00:52:32.713 --> 00:52:36.196]  We have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New York.
[00:52:36.196 --> 00:52:42.142]  And we need you guys to... We need someone to scramble some F-16s or something up there to help us out.
[00:52:42.142 --> 00:52:43.543]  Is this real world or exercise?
[00:52:43.543 --> 00:52:45.025]  No, this is not an exercise manifest.
[00:52:52.623 --> 00:52:56.764]  America's defenses assumed the hijackers would want to survive, but they were wrong.
[00:52:56.764 --> 00:53:03.426]  Oh, shit!
[00:53:03.426 --> 00:53:10.728]  A later exchange is between two controllers running New York's airspace as the second plane veered off course.
[00:53:10.728 --> 00:53:15.470]  We've got somebody who keeps crossing, but it looks like he's going into one of the small airports down there, so we're trying to bring him up.
[00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:17.330]  Do you know who he is?
[00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:18.971]  We just, we just, we don't know who he is.
[00:53:18.971 --> 00:53:20.031]  We're just picking him up now.
[00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:21.272]  All right, heads up, man.
[00:53:21.272 --> 00:53:22.372]  It looks like another one.
[00:53:39.176 --> 00:53:43.639]  Even after the third plane hit the Pentagon, senior air traffic managers faltered.
[00:53:43.639 --> 00:53:48.282]  Do we want to think about scrambling aircraft?
[00:53:48.282 --> 00:53:51.044]  Oh, God, I don't know.
[00:53:51.044 --> 00:53:57.349]  That's a decision somebody's going to have to make probably in the next ten minutes.
[00:53:57.349 --> 00:54:01.472]  You know, everybody just left the room.
[00:54:01.472 --> 00:54:05.955]  The chaos within air traffic control and the US air defences went from top to bottom.
[00:54:06.744 --> 00:54:10.105]  But the Commission found no evidence of a stand-down order.
[00:54:10.105 --> 00:54:23.148]  However, by investigating the questions asked by the conspiracy theorists, the Commission exposed something the politicians would have preferred to remain secret.
[00:54:23.148 --> 00:54:31.251]  In the years after the end of the Cold War, the air defenses guarding America's capital and financial center had been dismantled.
[00:54:31.251 --> 00:54:35.952]  There was a great feeling when the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War was over,
[00:54:36.818 --> 00:54:39.399]  That would be a great peace dividend.
[00:54:39.399 --> 00:54:48.202]  So the very existence of the North Atlantic Air Defense Command was called into question because where would the threat come from?
[00:54:48.202 --> 00:54:59.307]  No one thought, as they were struggling in the Pentagon to keep some semblance of air defense, to justify it on the basis of kamikaze type threats within the United States.
[00:54:59.307 --> 00:55:04.589]  It was outward looking, not looking in to deal with a threat that was already in the United States.
[00:55:12.904 --> 00:55:22.687]  The system had been turned off and only a very few bases with a very few airplanes left on standby to do this mission.
[00:55:22.687 --> 00:55:28.669]  There was no chance that any of those aircraft could have been shot down.
[00:55:28.669 --> 00:55:33.311]  Now, how do I counter those 15 minutes of lies?
[00:55:33.311 --> 00:55:36.372]  And then they bring me into the mix and we'll air that next week.
[00:55:36.372 --> 00:55:37.812]  You can watch that here.
[00:55:37.812 --> 00:55:40.713]  New Showtimes, Tuesdays, 7 to 8 p.m.
[00:55:40.713 --> 00:55:41.174]  Channel 10.
[00:55:41.174 --> 00:55:42.434]  And of course,
[00:55:43.534 --> 00:55:50.380]  Wednesdays, 8 to 9 p.m., Channel 10, the show you're watching right now, or at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.903]  Look, I should have had notes in here for all of this.
[00:55:53.903 --> 00:55:56.185]  This is incredible.
[00:55:56.185 --> 00:55:59.248]  They'd never heard of a plan to fly hijacked jets into buildings?
[00:55:59.248 --> 00:56:03.431]  I mean, I have dozens of articles, mainstream news, before 9-11.
[00:56:03.431 --> 00:56:11.578]  On the morning of 9-11, the CIA, admittedly, was running a drill of flying hijacked jets into the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[00:56:12.952 --> 00:56:21.694]  Now, I got this from Stanley Hilton, Bob Dole's former Chief of Staff, months before it even came out in the Associated Press in 2002.
[00:56:21.694 --> 00:56:23.814]  He said, I've deposed high-level military officers.
[00:56:23.814 --> 00:56:26.655]  I'm suing Bush for government involvement in 9-11.
[00:56:26.655 --> 00:56:30.155]  And they've said that the reason they stood down is they were told it was an exercise.
[00:56:30.155 --> 00:56:32.516]  Notice that clip they played of an air traffic controller?
[00:56:32.516 --> 00:56:35.136]  He said, is this real world or an exercise?
[00:56:35.136 --> 00:56:36.756]  And then, what, are we going to launch jets?
[00:56:36.756 --> 00:56:37.977]  A second plane set?
[00:56:37.977 --> 00:56:39.317]  Everybody just walked out of the room.
[00:56:40.026 --> 00:56:42.627]  Dick Cheney was in control at the bunker.
[00:56:42.627 --> 00:56:43.988]  That's now been admitted.
[00:56:43.988 --> 00:56:45.348]  And they said, does the order still stand?
[00:56:45.348 --> 00:56:48.049]  He said, yes, for a stand-down.
[00:56:48.049 --> 00:56:50.590]  They were running five drills that morning.
[00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:57.433]  They ran a drill of hijacked jets in November of 2000, flying into the Pentagon and CIA and World Trade Center.
[00:56:57.433 --> 00:56:59.354]  They ran a drill six weeks before.
[00:56:59.354 --> 00:57:05.057]  So their story that they never heard of such a plan is ridiculous.
[00:57:05.057 --> 00:57:07.518]  And they call it the Independent 9-11 Commission.
[00:57:07.518 --> 00:57:08.278]  You just saw
[00:57:09.503 --> 00:57:11.844]  British television says it's independent.
[00:57:11.844 --> 00:57:15.905]  It was appointed by George Bush.
[00:57:15.905 --> 00:57:23.687]  Bill Frisk is in business with the Carlisle Group and the Bin Laden family.
[00:57:23.687 --> 00:57:26.388]  Chairman Key is in business with these people.
[00:57:29.542 --> 00:57:32.823]  The head of the committee, the head staffer, wrote a book with Connelisa Rice.
[00:57:32.823 --> 00:57:40.766]  If no one knew this was going on, why did Mayor Willie Brown get a call from Connelisa Rice, National Security Advisor, the night before saying, don't fly to that meeting in D.C.
[00:57:40.766 --> 00:57:42.826]  tomorrow morning?
[00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:44.127]  In New York tomorrow morning?
[00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:47.388]  Why did the Joint Chiefs of Staff get told not to fly to New York that morning?
[00:57:47.388 --> 00:57:49.128]  They told Newsweek that.
[00:57:49.128 --> 00:57:51.409]  They stood down because they were told it's a drill.
[00:57:51.409 --> 00:57:54.430]  Then you ask, well then how'd they get those Arabs to fly planes into buildings?
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:58:10.333]  Those Arabs were part of a three-year, we now have the documents, Stanley Hilton has them, were part of a three-year drill practicing what to do if hijackers hijacked jets and flew them into buildings.
[00:58:10.333 --> 00:58:16.078]  They were CIA agents, officers, assets.
[00:58:16.078 --> 00:58:20.041]  Their homes, their cars, their credit cards were paid for by the US government.
[00:58:20.041 --> 00:58:20.722]  That's admitted.
[00:58:21.593 --> 00:58:22.753]  They were trained at U.S.
[00:58:22.753 --> 00:58:29.795]  military bases, then created their phony ledger of trying to fly Cessnas at different private schools the year before 9-11.
[00:58:29.795 --> 00:58:37.457]  Remember actor James Woods, a week before 9-11, was on a flight with these five guys who he said were simulating a hijacking?
[00:58:37.457 --> 00:58:44.058]  And he got off the plane and called the FBI and they came and said, shut your mouth, it's national security, Mr. Woods.
[00:58:44.058 --> 00:58:48.219]  So these Arabs, who were at a topless bar the night before, think they're part of a drill.
[00:58:52.165 --> 00:58:53.605]  Those are the names we know.
[00:58:53.605 --> 00:58:58.827]  At least 9 of the 19 have now been found to be still alive, but the others were admitted intelligence officers.
[00:58:58.827 --> 00:59:00.728]  They're on board thinking it's a drill.
[00:59:00.728 --> 00:59:02.148]  Nerve gas is released.
[00:59:02.148 --> 00:59:04.189]  This is from our sources.
[00:59:04.189 --> 00:59:08.150]  They kill everybody on board, then they remote control those planes into buildings.
[00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:09.250]  We have the official U.S.
[00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:15.212]  government plan, called Operation Northwoods, where they describe how to do this from decades ago.
[00:59:15.212 --> 00:59:15.872]  Declassify.
[00:59:19.477 --> 00:59:21.218]  Now, I'm sorry if you can't face that.
[00:59:21.218 --> 00:59:27.020]  They showed British environment minister, number three guy in the Blair government, saying, oh, Operation PNAC.
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:29.521]  I don't think they were involved, but they let it happen.
[00:59:29.521 --> 00:59:35.063]  Because PNAC says we need a catalyzing Pearl Harbor helpful event.
[00:59:35.063 --> 00:59:36.703]  Folks, they carried this out.
[00:59:36.703 --> 00:59:42.646]  Like Hitler and the Reichstag, like Nero and Rome, like the USS Maine, like the USS Liberty.
[00:59:42.646 --> 00:59:44.306]  The Gulf of Tonkin never happened.
[00:59:44.306 --> 00:59:45.947]  That's now admitted to have been fake.
[00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:48.731]  They just claimed an attack that didn't happen.
[00:59:48.731 --> 00:59:50.651]  Now they actually carry them out.
[00:59:50.651 --> 00:59:52.672]  That is the facts.
[00:59:52.672 --> 00:59:59.194]  And next week, we will air the rest of it and really dissect it in the next two live shows we do.
[00:59:59.194 --> 01:00:02.255]  And again, the websites are InfoWars.com.
[01:00:02.255 --> 01:00:04.716]  They are PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:04.716 --> 01:00:07.457]  They are InfoWars.net.
[01:00:07.457 --> 01:00:09.658]  And just God bless you all.
[01:00:09.658 --> 01:00:12.439]  Get out there and fight the New World Order.
[01:00:12.439 --> 01:00:13.479]  And expose this tyranny.
