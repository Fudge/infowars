[00:00.000 --> 00:13.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.080 --> 00:33.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.960 --> 00:42.200]  it is Tuesday the 14th day already of October 2014 I'm your host Alex Jones
[00:42.200 --> 00:46.560]  the editor-in-chief of World Affairs briefs all Scousers and Giants to talk
[00:46.560 --> 00:51.760]  about geopolitical affairs the Ebola outbreak and the most survivable safe
[00:51.760 --> 00:56.720]  areas during a pandemic here in the United States and other parts of the
[00:56.720 --> 01:03.560]  world when you're in a car wreck once it starts at least in the big car wrecks
[01:03.560 --> 01:07.960]  I've been in unfortunately things go into slow motion they really do you see
[01:07.960 --> 01:11.320]  that movies you read about that if you've been lucky enough or blessed
[01:11.320 --> 01:14.880]  enough not to be in a really bad car wreck or train wreck or plane crash or
[01:14.880 --> 01:20.320]  something like that then it's just Hollywood but if you've lived it it's
[01:20.320 --> 01:27.560]  real Joe Biggs talked about me in Iraq and being in a huge IED that blew the
[01:27.560 --> 01:31.080]  back wheels of their armored vehicle hundreds of yards behind them seeing
[01:31.080 --> 01:40.320]  pieces of paper and dust drifting past his face in slow motion and that's what
[01:40.320 --> 01:46.600]  this is like seeing the clearly this morning I was reading over the news and
[01:46.600 --> 01:52.840]  watching seeing in to track what they were putting out and it clicked a hundred
[01:52.840 --> 01:57.400]  percent this is scripted now does that mean they released the Ebola to begin
[01:57.400 --> 02:00.760]  with I don't know they have a history of doing stuff like that so they're prime
[02:00.760 --> 02:08.720]  suspects what I do know is the response is scripted it is a stand-down and we
[02:08.720 --> 02:15.680]  said this a lot already but it really clicked that we are in the hands of a
[02:15.680 --> 02:20.640]  criminal bureaucracy that sees control of Western governments and major fortune
[02:20.640 --> 02:27.120]  100 corporations that for whatever reason is bringing Ebola here and letting
[02:27.120 --> 02:35.400]  Ebola spread and the question we have to ask ourselves is what are we going to do
[02:35.400 --> 02:39.640]  about it are we going to sit here while they fly more people in than have Ebola
[02:39.640 --> 02:45.320]  and while they allow collapsing collapsing not my words the president
[02:45.320 --> 02:52.680]  Liberia's words collapsing countries collapse into the United States because
[02:52.680 --> 02:59.440]  other nations won't take them other nations in Europe and the Middle East and
[02:59.440 --> 03:04.640]  Asia Latin America is allowing the flights in and the head of Southcom as you
[03:04.640 --> 03:10.960]  know last Monday over a week ago now eight days ago we played the clip here
[03:10.960 --> 03:13.600]  came out and said that they think it'll probably get into Central and South
[03:13.600 --> 03:18.680]  America and if it does there's gonna be a giant influx to come up here so the
[03:18.680 --> 03:25.120]  United States is a big flashing neon sign out front the diner saying hey
[03:25.120 --> 03:30.080]  you're feeling bad you think you got Ebola well get on an airplane and come
[03:30.080 --> 03:36.280]  here and vomit and project blood out your rear end and everything else projectile
[03:36.280 --> 03:42.200]  diarrhea all up and down the hallways of these hospitals and then the hospital
[03:42.200 --> 03:46.760]  workers and the emergency workers and the police and everybody trying to
[03:46.760 --> 03:52.040]  contain it they can all get it well that's a great idea just like it's a
[03:52.040 --> 03:55.720]  great idea to shut down most our power plants and double our power prices just
[03:55.720 --> 03:58.880]  like it's a good idea to say that dads aren't good and break up families with
[03:58.880 --> 04:03.320]  tax incentives just like it's a great idea to give little kids 50 something
[04:03.320 --> 04:07.040]  vaccines by the time they're two years old and see an epidemic of neurological
[04:07.040 --> 04:11.240]  disorders no it's a horrible idea from the perspective of we the people but
[04:11.240 --> 04:16.280]  it's a great idea from the perspective of the eugenicist that might as well be
[04:16.280 --> 04:20.560]  humanoid aliens from a distant star system here running our government
[04:20.560 --> 04:24.800]  setting up a soft kill program to dumb us down and then kill us I mean they might
[04:24.800 --> 04:30.440]  as well be vampires or something from Planet X they're not there they're
[04:30.440 --> 04:37.440]  psychopathic sociopathic guilds working together in just a big criminal swarm
[04:37.440 --> 04:41.880]  it's not even really totally coordinated they just all work kind of in the same
[04:41.880 --> 04:47.000]  parasitic way and you can just see the fall of civilization mass mental illness
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.040]  spreading like wildfire diseases spreading everywhere I mean we are a
[04:51.040 --> 04:55.880]  judged country like like Pharaoh I was thinking about that this morning and
[04:55.880 --> 05:01.280]  and then the judgments that came upon Egypt after consulting top doctors

[08:17.920 --> 08:35.880]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. An even bigger issue than the virus Ebola
[08:35.880 --> 08:43.160]  itself now spreading across the world because standard containment procedures
[08:43.160 --> 08:47.240]  were default turned off now that they tried to put them in place and they
[08:47.240 --> 08:55.880]  failed they were turned off there was a stand down just like on 9-11 and there
[08:55.880 --> 08:59.720]  has been a stand down here and the establishment thinks that we're so
[08:59.720 --> 09:05.920]  stupid maybe they're right that they're going to get away with this as you know
[09:05.920 --> 09:12.080]  over the weekend we learned that a nurse at the Presbyterian Hospital in
[09:12.080 --> 09:17.640]  Dallas where the first Ebola victim patient zero died last Wednesday he
[09:17.640 --> 09:23.440]  really died on Tuesday they told us about it on Wednesday had contracted it
[09:23.440 --> 09:28.280]  and that at least 70 healthcare workers came in contact with him not to
[09:28.280 --> 09:31.640]  mention him vomiting all over the apartment vomiting all over the street
[09:31.640 --> 09:36.880]  his children still being sent to school I'm gonna say this again when they knew
[09:36.880 --> 09:45.520]  he had Ebola say that slowly when they knew he had Ebola at least one of the
[09:45.520 --> 09:49.040]  children was still sent to school your child's got the flu or a cold they say
[09:49.040 --> 09:56.160]  don't go but oh this time send him and now Ebola outbreak UN health worker dies
[09:56.160 --> 10:02.080]  in German Hospital we have a healthcare worker contracting it from someone they
[10:02.080 --> 10:06.960]  brought in in Spain last week and remember this has a 21-day 22-day
[10:06.960 --> 10:13.880]  incubation period may have mutated more to even go longer and so we'll really
[10:13.880 --> 10:21.000]  start finding out how many people he infected in about a week because he
[10:21.000 --> 10:28.720]  infects him a few weeks ago 14 days 21 days pops out in another six seven eight
[10:28.720 --> 10:32.440]  days we should have a count down here from my guesstimations dead reckoning
[10:32.440 --> 10:38.440]  six seven days get out of calendar because you print me off a September
[10:38.440 --> 10:41.800]  October calendar and then some of the dates of when he came in when he went
[10:41.800 --> 10:44.440]  to the hospital was two weeks ago he went to the hospital two and a half weeks
[10:44.440 --> 10:49.680]  ago gets checked in the hospital a week and a half ago dies last Wednesday so
[10:49.680 --> 10:54.120]  we're talking two and a half weeks or so yeah I mean we're talking four five six
[10:54.120 --> 10:59.160]  seven days but then they'll probably cover that up and just let those people
[10:59.160 --> 11:03.400]  continue to spread it no attempt to track down who was on the airplane he was
[11:03.400 --> 11:09.040]  with or check them no attempt no attempt now to quarantine the other 70 medical
[11:09.040 --> 11:13.080]  workers they're gonna let them spread it and then you know what that means it
[11:13.080 --> 11:19.760]  means that it goes viral and not viral like your video goes viral for your rock
[11:19.760 --> 11:27.080]  band or your hip-hop group the bad kind of viral hundreds of people exposed to
[11:27.080 --> 11:34.560]  him including children now out there spreading it and you know the bad thing
[11:34.560 --> 11:40.160]  about Ebola most diseases that are in animals aren't in humans they don't
[11:40.160 --> 11:45.360]  cross the zoological bridge as it's called
[11:45.360 --> 11:52.720]  well Ebola can be carried by your dog or by your cat or pretty much anything else
[11:52.720 --> 11:59.120]  warm-blooded you've got so that's another little added goodie to it all is
[11:59.120 --> 12:03.480]  that your your animals can give it to stray animals and then it's in the
[12:03.480 --> 12:07.680]  population like it is in Africa where it's in the monkeys and the fruit bats
[12:07.680 --> 12:14.360]  and then it's quasi airborne because the bats fly over and urinate and defecate
[12:14.360 --> 12:22.640]  in the air and the virus lives in that and then you inhale it and you know the
[12:22.640 --> 12:31.680]  compassionate thing to do is going to be bringing the children of Latin America
[12:31.680 --> 12:35.800]  when it starts spreading in Latin America in ideal condition South Com is
[12:35.800 --> 12:41.640]  saying to come here over the open border and to show up at the hospitals for the
[12:41.640 --> 12:45.400]  healthcare and then I saw the headline last week weeks after I'd pointed this
[12:45.400 --> 12:48.240]  out it's just common sense because I just point that out people don't think
[12:48.240 --> 12:53.960]  that I'm just extrapolating and it's not actually happening there was a
[12:53.960 --> 13:00.040]  headline Ebola in America good for Obamacare because it shows a federal
[13:00.040 --> 13:04.160]  response and a federal crisis and only the feds can organize against it yeah
[13:04.160 --> 13:08.760]  don't let a good crisis go to waste gee you got seven African countries it was
[13:08.760 --> 13:13.740]  four than five and six now seven that have Ebola in them and Spain and the
[13:13.740 --> 13:18.080]  US and looks like they're covering cases up in Australia and other areas but
[13:18.080 --> 13:22.400]  but let's just say eight countries right now no no nine countries seven
[13:22.400 --> 13:32.400]  African one European one North American so so you've got nine nine countries that
[13:32.400 --> 13:38.920]  we know have it and it's all during the flu season with compromised immune
[13:38.920 --> 13:45.760]  systems and it's clearly mutated over 300 times in the last six months that's
[13:45.760 --> 13:50.280]  the CDC and World Health Organization's own number 326 times I think was the
[13:50.280 --> 13:58.600]  last mutation before a big olah in years past a large Ebola or
[13:58.600 --> 14:04.840]  obola outbreak would be six people 15 people 21 people that was the previous
[14:04.840 --> 14:08.680]  big one now it's clearly tens of thousands they're covering up the
[14:08.680 --> 14:14.280]  numbers still claiming you know that's only 3,000 that have died it's hundreds
[14:14.280 --> 14:17.360]  of thousands if not millions that have now been in contact with it and
[14:17.360 --> 14:23.720]  contracted it and it's spreading and you don't block people out of those
[14:23.720 --> 14:28.240]  countries day one like the British and the French and others did almost two
[14:28.240 --> 14:33.800]  months ago and then you advertise you're going to leave the flights open so
[14:33.800 --> 14:40.840]  that middle-class and wealthy Nigerians who've got it and other folks from
[14:40.840 --> 14:50.480]  Africa Sierra Leone can then come over here that is a guaranteed recipe to
[14:50.480 --> 14:55.120]  spread Ebola and now it spread and remember Geraldo Rivera said how dare
[14:55.120 --> 15:00.480]  you claim immigrants could bring Ebola it's impossible how dare you say that
[15:00.480 --> 15:04.880]  fish live in the ocean it's preposterous how dare you not support
[15:04.880 --> 15:11.760]  Obama's gun control agenda or your racist just do whatever we say even if it
[15:11.760 --> 15:19.040]  flies in the face of common sense but now South com admits they think Ebola
[15:19.040 --> 15:24.240]  will probably come across the border now a second person has gotten in the US
[15:24.240 --> 15:33.160]  from patient zero so the first person is supposedly officially contracted and the
[15:33.160 --> 15:38.800]  World Health Organization is predicting 10,000 new Ebola cases per week we've
[15:38.800 --> 15:43.600]  got an LA bus driver quarantined after passenger yells I have Ebola so you have
[15:43.600 --> 15:49.000]  lots of schizophrenics and attention whores running around declaring that
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.880]  they have Ebola I think you could get trendies to sign a petition that we're
[15:54.880 --> 15:58.080]  going to do this here in Austin and we're going to do it down on the border
[15:58.080 --> 16:08.080]  and and you you have to phrase it right Obama our gracious dear leader wants us
[16:08.080 --> 16:13.080]  to help the world and as the CDC chief has said leaving the borders open letting
[16:13.080 --> 16:19.800]  the flights come in is the way to fight all Ebola so shouldn't we all sign a
[16:19.800 --> 16:25.760]  petition to bring the Ebola patients not just US citizens but of the world to the
[16:25.760 --> 16:31.560]  United States and to not make them feel ostracized put them in schools with our
[16:31.560 --> 16:37.560]  children and I think the average trendy will sign it because self-destruction
[16:37.560 --> 16:44.560]  is their religion failure and collapse is their God now let's go over some of
[16:44.560 --> 16:50.040]  these headlines Kurt Nemo wrote a story for mfallwars.com with video Dallas nurse

[17:13.920 --> 17:18.280]  it that's what a lot of other top scientists are saying we of course have
[17:18.280 --> 17:22.480]  been criticized for publishing those reports linked to the CDC we've been
[17:22.480 --> 17:26.680]  attacked by the mainstream media for actually reporting facts which is a
[17:26.680 --> 17:31.040]  badge of honor please keep throwing me in that briar patch most US hospitals

[17:56.480 --> 18:01.840]  could they use as I predicted before this happened a bio weapon release as the

[18:52.880 --> 18:57.720]  with Ebola ensuring it spreads I told you months ago that's what they do
[18:57.720 --> 19:02.480]  because whatever the most evil evil out-of-control policy is to make the
[19:02.480 --> 19:06.840]  crisis as bad as possible this political class will do it it's how they
[19:06.840 --> 19:13.680]  operate it's what their mindset is so there's some of those headlines let me

[19:37.240 --> 19:40.400]  now it's going to give the UN and the federal government and all these
[19:40.400 --> 19:45.160]  central agencies more power when they openly say they want to reduce world

[24:19.840 --> 24:28.600]  inner info wars.com and prisonplanet.com the panic that is going to ensue out of
[24:28.600 --> 24:35.360]  Ebola being allowed to come to this country and spread is clearly engineered
[24:35.360 --> 24:39.640]  clearly contrived so Obama can put executive orders in shutting down more
[24:39.640 --> 24:43.600]  power plants going after the Second Amendment putting our troops under
[24:43.600 --> 24:49.320]  NATO command outside Congress launching more wars to support ISIS that's in the
[24:49.320 --> 24:54.760]  news today Turkish air strikes hit Kurds not ISIS Turkey wants ISIS to
[24:54.760 --> 24:58.480]  conquer Syria yeah they armed him to begin with North Korean leader has
[24:58.480 --> 25:03.520]  reappeared in public that's some of the news that's coming up but the United
[25:03.520 --> 25:07.840]  States and the whole world is sitting on top of a derivatives and a devalued
[25:07.840 --> 25:12.240]  currency bubble and I've always said they could use a global pandemic
[25:12.240 --> 25:18.240]  outbreak whether real or manufactured or exacerbated or a large regional war as
[25:18.240 --> 25:24.240]  the political cover to implode the world economy
[25:26.920 --> 25:37.440]  at this point statistically maybe 200 300 people have come in contact with
[25:37.440 --> 25:43.640]  patient zero as they become infectious let's say half of them become infectious
[25:43.640 --> 25:47.520]  that's a high number but let's just say half of them become infectious that's a
[25:47.520 --> 25:53.440]  hundred hundred to fifty people if they don't get instantly quarantined or allowed
[25:53.440 --> 25:58.560]  to run around and spread it then you're talking 300 400 500 that end up
[25:58.560 --> 26:01.520]  getting it and then thousands and then tens of thousands and then hundreds of
[26:01.520 --> 26:05.520]  thousands and then millions and if it gets to the tens of thousands that end
[26:05.520 --> 26:09.800]  up having Ebola with the way this country's been trained to panic and hide
[26:09.800 --> 26:14.200]  under the table if the media shows us some have been lied in sock puppet on TV
[26:14.200 --> 26:26.400]  it will bring industry and schools and commerce to a standstill of panic and the
[26:26.400 --> 26:31.680]  CDC will roll out Obamacare who would have thought federalization of health
[26:31.680 --> 26:36.560]  care would have helped coordinate it and bring the epidemic under control that's
[26:36.560 --> 26:41.760]  the type of quote she'll hear because if they put real operations into place that
[26:41.760 --> 26:45.480]  they should have done on a micro scale on a large scale it will end up stopping
[26:45.480 --> 26:50.560]  it and now they've set up the model of medical tyranny and Obama's expanded
[26:50.560 --> 26:56.840]  executive order about disappearing anyone with a respiratory illness that's why
[26:56.840 --> 27:02.560]  they have the headline out today that is so incredibly important in Bloomberg
[27:02.560 --> 27:13.040]  where top scientists and others are very very very very upset and are saying you
[27:13.040 --> 27:18.400]  should have had separate medical facilities to hold Ebola patients you
[27:18.400 --> 27:22.000]  should have never brought Ebola patients here to begin with and the medical
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.560]  workers have to be in full spacesuits and you have bio shield government level
[27:27.560 --> 27:31.640]  four facilities and so now they're saying they're going to take people to
[27:31.640 --> 27:37.360]  level four facilities and build camps around them but they had to first let
[27:37.360 --> 27:43.520]  it get going see and so it's in the news oh the CDC didn't follow its protocol by
[27:43.520 --> 27:47.640]  accident but now they are and they're re looking at it and they're building these
[27:47.640 --> 27:52.920]  emergency centers for you oh but they're going to keep the flights coming in to
[27:52.920 --> 27:59.840]  prime the pump as Africa large areas of Africa collapses with people piling on
[27:59.840 --> 28:06.600]  to the aircraft to come here until it gets out of hand and they're going to
[28:06.600 --> 28:09.640]  have checkpoints with cops with thermometers digital thermometers
[28:09.640 --> 28:13.360]  scanning your faces the cops are going to be in masks if they're going to be
[28:13.360 --> 28:17.800]  getting it all because the criminals that run our government brought it here and
[28:17.800 --> 28:21.800]  you're going to have the media saying people were down on Obama at first but
[28:21.800 --> 28:25.960]  his response to it he looked like a great leader look at him in a hazmat suit
[28:25.960 --> 28:32.000]  visiting people at the Ebola camp in New Jersey he's got a lot of courage well
[28:32.000 --> 28:40.880]  it's his dedication Sally back to you I mean you can see the whole stinking
[28:40.880 --> 28:46.560]  rollout of this scripted event and it makes me want to throw up
[28:49.440 --> 28:59.360]  truly truly insane that they would allow this to get to that point and only
[28:59.360 --> 29:12.080]  now come out and talk about putting in the default procedures but if they would
[29:12.080 --> 29:17.920]  have put the default procedures two months ago like Europe did and like the
[29:17.920 --> 29:22.040]  Arab countries did this wouldn't have happened and we couldn't have had this
[29:22.040 --> 29:28.720]  non-citizen from Nigeria with a fever vomiting flying back to the US to try to
[29:28.720 --> 29:32.200]  go to the hospital to get treatment and our healthcare system is so helplessly
[29:32.200 --> 29:37.600]  broken I've had him try this with my kids before they've got a bacteria or I
[29:37.600 --> 29:43.600]  mean they've got a virus and they try to get antibiotics for a for a bacteria
[29:43.600 --> 29:46.720]  when they have a virus they don't even test them to see if you have a virus or
[29:46.720 --> 29:51.040]  a bacteria they just give you antibiotics and then Jesse Jackson says it's racist
[29:51.040 --> 29:56.200]  no it's our screwed up Alex Jones and the GCN radio I'm gonna find that
[29:56.200 --> 30:00.800]  Bloomberg article here and come back with that because I can't find it using

[33:00.360 --> 33:11.960]  We are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[33:11.960 --> 33:23.560]  network. I'm going to be very candid and frank with you I don't want to sound to be
[33:23.560 --> 33:29.160]  honest with you because I'm always honest with the audience but sometimes I
[33:29.160 --> 33:37.120]  hold back the full truth because I don't want to be alarmist but I am so angry
[33:37.120 --> 33:45.240]  right now that I am beyond even physically showing it I am so sick of our
[33:45.240 --> 33:49.920]  criminal government I am so sick of the criminal special interest that would
[33:49.920 --> 33:55.760]  burn the country down if it gave them more power and I am so sick of the
[33:55.760 --> 33:59.720]  compartmentalization where you can't even really hate the average big
[33:59.720 --> 34:04.320]  corporation or the average police officer or the average bureaucrat because
[34:04.320 --> 34:09.440]  they're just compartmentalized and no less than we do. They're not part of it
[34:09.440 --> 34:17.320]  it's how big and complex the world is allows these con artists and these
[34:17.320 --> 34:24.480]  crisis creators these wreckers these vultures to literally sabotage and screw
[34:24.480 --> 34:31.040]  our society over. Thirty years ago if there was an FAA air traffic disaster
[34:31.040 --> 34:35.600]  people were fired and then it happened again they would fire the head of the
[34:35.600 --> 34:40.920]  FAA. In third world countries if a dam broke and killed people they would fire
[34:40.920 --> 34:49.640]  the head of the dam and sometimes arrest them. Now when there's melamine and the
[34:49.640 --> 34:53.360]  milk in the US nobody gets in trouble they execute people in China for that
[34:53.360 --> 35:01.680]  when our government screws up on purpose in Katrina and orders a stand down and a
[35:01.680 --> 35:06.720]  bunch of people die FEMA got double the funding the next year in Congress for
[35:06.720 --> 35:13.720]  disaster relief what does that incentivize screwing up and then I see
[35:13.720 --> 35:17.680]  all the Bill and Melinda Gates Monsanto preparation like chickens with their
[35:17.680 --> 35:22.680]  heads cut off the last two years on Ebola and Ebola vaccines that are really
[35:22.680 --> 35:31.560]  live virus nanotech super science stuff. From eugenicists that run Planned
[35:31.560 --> 35:35.920]  Parenthood and fund all the big gun control groups and openly say they
[35:35.920 --> 35:40.440]  want to break up the family hardcore psychopath exterminist beyond anything
[35:40.440 --> 35:49.000]  you'll ever see in a movie or read in a book they make Hitler look unsophisticated
[35:49.000 --> 35:56.160]  and then I mean I make a statement like that and I think of all the data to
[35:56.160 --> 36:02.400]  prove it and it makes my head spin it's my head swim the Rockefellers that run
[36:02.400 --> 36:09.280]  the big tax-free foundations and run that whole program since 1906 and run the
[36:09.280 --> 36:14.000]  Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett Foundation on record funded the
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.800]  entire Nazi movement the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute everything they run modern
[36:17.800 --> 36:22.240]  education they founded the UN gave them the property for it they run every
[36:22.240 --> 36:27.600]  North American Union every Asia Pac Union group they run everything along with
[36:27.600 --> 36:34.400]  the British and Dutch Royal families and the Rothschilds and they are flaming
[36:34.400 --> 36:38.880]  crazy people now they would argue no we're in control and run the show and
[36:38.880 --> 36:43.200]  we work 15 hours a day to do it and it's actually true I mean I guess we've
[36:43.200 --> 36:46.760]  gotten to the point just seating and all of them going okay you can bring a
[36:46.760 --> 36:51.080]  bowl in you can forcibly inoculate you can come out with aerosolized vaccines
[36:51.080 --> 36:55.280]  and vaccines and food we can't escape and we can see them hurting everybody and
[36:55.280 --> 36:59.800]  and no one stands up to you so maybe it is survival of the fittest maybe social
[36:59.800 --> 37:09.040]  Darwinism is true it's a cult with these people David Rockefeller I've had top
[37:09.040 --> 37:17.120]  scientists on people this happened to would in the 70s and 60s and things just
[37:17.120 --> 37:21.200]  show up at a university wouldn't even be Harvard or Princeton or MIT show up
[37:21.200 --> 37:26.280]  there too and we just show up in the lunch line to recruit you know the the
[37:26.280 --> 37:32.160]  top 20 year old scientists but they're obsessed with test scores and who's the
[37:32.160 --> 37:36.480]  smartest and and then they recruit them into this cult and they even tried to
[37:36.480 --> 37:40.080]  recruit my dad it wasn't David Rockefeller but it was the head of the
[37:40.080 --> 37:46.280]  botany department into this literal eugenics cult and I'm here telling you
[37:46.280 --> 37:51.680]  this this is not a game do you understand how evil these people are so I
[37:51.680 --> 37:55.440]  don't know if they released this Ebola I know it's mutating like it's ever done
[37:55.440 --> 38:01.840]  before appears a big owing airborne and it kills 70% of people who get treatment
[38:01.840 --> 38:09.120]  in the West now and more than that in Africa and let me tell you everybody
[38:09.120 --> 38:12.520]  thinks they're gonna live forever you think you're invincible I buried three
[38:12.520 --> 38:16.840]  family members in the last 12 months killed by this mystery respiratory crap
[38:16.840 --> 38:27.400]  it's just common mutated staph bacteria in these hospitals you go to the hospital
[38:27.400 --> 38:30.960]  visit somebody you get it you die family comes to see you they all get it they
[38:30.960 --> 38:35.560]  start dying and because it was a real plague and the hospital doctors said
[38:35.560 --> 38:38.880]  they'd never seen death like this and it was all over the country nothing in the
[38:38.880 --> 38:42.640]  news except a few local papers saying a lot of deaths and the hospitals are
[38:42.640 --> 38:45.800]  overtaxed because when it's a real crisis they don't tell you it's a real
[38:45.800 --> 38:50.680]  crisis and when it's not a real crisis they tell you it is by default and we're
[38:50.680 --> 38:57.120]  watching in slow motion like a car wreck or like watching a kid strapped down by
[38:57.120 --> 39:02.920]  Ted Bundy have their fingernails torn out slowly we are sitting here watching
[39:02.920 --> 39:07.480]  the government bringing in watching the borders being wide open watching the
[39:07.480 --> 39:12.160]  giant population being targeted by a tiny psycho elite who believe they're
[39:12.160 --> 39:16.160]  preparing to sweep the earth of the human disease all their movies all their
[39:16.160 --> 39:21.080]  TV shows all their programs lauding the world without humans life after humans
[39:21.080 --> 39:30.920]  all these preparations I don't think
[39:33.880 --> 39:37.760]  that this will probably even be the big one as I've said for over a decade on
[39:37.760 --> 39:43.920]  air on this subject I know how they work I said they would do medium-sized and
[39:43.920 --> 39:47.320]  smaller bio releases that kill thousands or hundreds of thousands in the
[39:47.320 --> 39:50.400]  West millions in Africa because that's where they've already gotten away with
[39:50.400 --> 39:57.800]  you know 45% of some African countries having HIV they go check the sexual
[39:57.800 --> 40:01.560]  organs of the young girls they've never had sex and then they try to trace it
[40:01.560 --> 40:05.240]  right back to the vaccines even BBC had to admit that it's probably six seven
[40:05.240 --> 40:09.920]  years ago they're giving it to them so where they got air superiority where
[40:09.920 --> 40:14.040]  they control the media where they've got the people under their control oh it's
[40:14.040 --> 40:18.880]  just a bunch of Africans kind of a deep-seated liberal racism they can get
[40:18.880 --> 40:27.200]  away with giving 45% of the country HIV and killing them but they'll have it
[40:27.200 --> 40:33.320]  rolled out as I predicted with an Ebola or a SARS or a superflu that kills
[40:33.320 --> 40:37.000]  tens of thousands at first then hundreds of thousands the next season then a
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.040]  medical tyranny is put in place everyone accepts the government's the boss
[40:41.040 --> 40:44.320]  they're in control we've got to have total quarantine total forced
[40:44.320 --> 40:49.080]  inoculation or you don't want to happen what happened in 2015 do you the
[40:49.080 --> 40:53.600]  winner of 2015 you know where it's spread all over the world and killed
[40:53.600 --> 40:57.000]  millions I mean you don't want that to happen again you take your bill of
[40:57.000 --> 41:02.360]  lindigates shot Alex Jones and the public's not sophisticated enough to
[41:02.360 --> 41:05.880]  know they were behind the vaccine behind the testing centers in the country
[41:05.880 --> 41:09.880]  where it began to go viral and spread and mutate and go from three days of 21
[41:09.880 --> 41:15.320]  days so it can spread further and farther before it's identifiable but I may be
[41:15.320 --> 41:23.160]  wrong it could go airborne this year and then 70% of the people that get it
[41:23.160 --> 41:25.480]  will die
[41:27.280 --> 41:32.520]  we're talking potentially about billions of dead people and now they've got
[41:32.520 --> 41:36.200]  the armored vehicles in place the checkpoints the surveillance all of it I
[41:36.200 --> 41:41.080]  kept telling you for years really about 17 years on the eugenics and 10 years
[41:41.080 --> 41:45.360]  deeply on it first few years I wasn't that learned it in these things I knew
[41:45.360 --> 41:50.840]  a lot about it but nothing like I do now that once they got their grid in place
[41:50.840 --> 41:57.560]  once this system was in place it would be the death of us all you've got world
[41:57.560 --> 42:03.040]  leaders Prince Charles Prince Philip Queen Beatrix Ted Turner David Rockefeller
[42:03.040 --> 42:09.840]  senator Rockefeller all of them talking about I want to kill everybody and
[42:09.840 --> 42:12.480]  before you idiot trolls out there watching make jokes about me starting
[42:12.480 --> 42:16.000]  to break down listen I got three kids and all you stupid trolls who think you
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.720]  have a death wish you you won't really have a death wish when you're flopping
[42:18.720 --> 42:22.080]  around with blood spraying out both ends let me tell you something the new
[42:22.080 --> 42:27.480]  world order wants us all dead and this could be it I told you Homeland Security
[42:27.480 --> 42:31.040]  wasn't for Al Qaeda I told you it was for the Tea Party and gun owners and
[42:31.040 --> 42:35.720]  veterans and people that won't roll over to whatever it is they got planned and
[42:35.720 --> 42:40.360]  you got dr. Pianca that gets these world awards and at the time headed up the
[42:40.360 --> 42:44.760]  UT biology department coming out saying it's coming soon the airborne Ebola I'm
[42:44.760 --> 42:49.560]  sad for my family but it must be done 90 plus percent will die I am ready it is
[42:49.560 --> 42:53.960]  coming and 90 plus percent of the people at the Texas Academy of Sciences in
[42:53.960 --> 43:00.680]  Houston stood and cried in up to five-minute standing ovations when he
[43:00.680 --> 43:05.840]  projected a wall of red skulls and said the mass death is coming young women
[43:05.840 --> 43:09.480]  graduate students ran and threw themselves at him like he was Elvis
[43:09.480 --> 43:21.400]  Presley or the Beatles if my dad was in the top 125 test scores across the board
[43:21.400 --> 43:27.080]  in Texas and then they took the top six or seven out of that and brought him in
[43:27.080 --> 43:30.360]  a room at the University of Texas and said well there's really a world
[43:30.360 --> 43:34.640]  government we're forming a eugenics operation and it's not like Hitler did
[43:34.640 --> 43:38.160]  it it's going to be for the betterment of humanity of course my dad ended up
[43:38.160 --> 43:42.600]  meeting my mom getting married going the quicker out to medical school got he was
[43:42.600 --> 43:48.840]  never in all of it but then he wondered why all over and over again the CIA would
[43:48.840 --> 43:52.080]  show up we want you to work with us we want you to work with us we want you
[43:52.080 --> 43:56.920]  to work with us it was only because he had been fingered early on but he's not
[43:56.920 --> 44:02.360]  nothing that special out of Texas every year they're pulling hundreds of people
[44:02.360 --> 44:07.200]  for this kind of stuff they've got a huge army in on it you understand that
[44:07.200 --> 44:11.640]  brought into it when they're 18 years old they brought my dad in when he was a
[44:11.640 --> 44:15.240]  junior in high school he was already in a summer program at UT when they brought
[44:15.240 --> 44:22.200]  him in little Davy Jones you understand how widespread is this this is the real
[44:22.200 --> 44:29.960]  world boys and girls this is the real planet this is where we live and they
[44:29.960 --> 44:32.760]  wouldn't be doing this if they didn't think they could get away with it now I
[44:32.760 --> 44:38.400]  want to be clear Ebola has only come with patient zero we know infected one
[44:38.400 --> 44:42.680]  nurse in Dallas another nurse in Spain we're going to Joe Biggs here a minute
[44:42.680 --> 44:51.200]  on the Texas border we know that but it obviously they were around a lot of other
[44:51.200 --> 44:54.200]  people I think it's fair to say it's going to be more cases and they did this
[44:54.200 --> 44:56.880]  deliberately let it spread that guy should have been locked up in a level
[44:56.880 --> 45:02.800]  five containment day one level four here it is Bloomberg detected Ebola hospital
[45:02.800 --> 45:07.760]  or dedicated Ebola hospital sought after nurses infection US and local health
[45:07.760 --> 45:10.760]  officials want to set up dedicated hospitals in each state for Ebola
[45:10.760 --> 45:14.840]  patients part of the new emphasis on safety and health care workers after a
[45:14.840 --> 45:17.720]  nurse caring for an infected patient Dallas tested positive of the virus
[45:17.720 --> 45:22.560]  folks that the CDC goes on to say they're rethinking its existing infection
[45:22.560 --> 45:26.760]  control no they turned off the default which we've been telling you for months
[45:26.760 --> 45:31.120]  we told you when they brought in people with Ebola it was gonna spread from them
[45:31.120 --> 45:38.480]  and it is now see it was on purpose they study this they're the experts they
[45:38.480 --> 45:43.560]  knew the our government wants Ebola spreading in America and they think
[45:43.560 --> 45:49.600]  here's the big one that they're gonna get away with it cops firefighters EMTs
[45:49.600 --> 45:54.680]  medical workers you're going to be the front lines of getting this so remember
[45:54.680 --> 45:59.240]  what your loyalty to this suicidal system did when you get it and your kids
[45:59.240 --> 46:02.960]  get it I'm sorry for your kids I'll probably be blame for trying to stop it
[46:02.960 --> 46:07.400]  I'm sure how it works I understand so just remember this is what giving into the
[46:07.400 --> 46:11.800]  new world order does this is what living in fantasy land does okay and for the
[46:11.800 --> 46:16.040]  general public hope you enjoy it hope you enjoy all of it because if we don't
[46:16.040 --> 46:19.640]  put massive pressure on them now to immediately lock up everybody who's
[46:19.640 --> 46:22.720]  come in contact with these patients we're talking thousands of people have to
[46:22.720 --> 46:25.800]  be locked up now no they're gonna let that spread and it's gonna be millions
[46:25.800 --> 46:29.600]  they want it to get to a critical mass then they're gonna clamp down and it's
[46:29.600 --> 46:34.840]  gonna be hell now let's go to Joe Biggs down there with Josh Owens I want to be
[46:34.840 --> 46:39.520]  clear folks the border region is not even the place that's a hot zone the
[46:39.520 --> 46:45.880]  entire of America is hospitals are the hot zones clinics are the hot zones not
[46:45.880 --> 46:51.440]  the border we're down on the border where people would come across who have it to
[46:51.440 --> 46:57.840]  go to the hospital that's where the real hot zone is ladies and gentlemen Joe
[46:57.840 --> 47:00.160]  Biggs what are you seeing down there what's your take on what you've just
[47:00.160 --> 47:05.360]  heard me talk about Joe Biggs info wars.com I'm at a Andalusia Park in
[47:05.360 --> 47:09.400]  Mission Texas now right behind me is the Rio Grande as you can see and just
[47:09.400 --> 47:13.840]  across the water that's Mexico right there of we're at the park yes we're
[47:13.840 --> 47:18.960]  yesterday we were harassed by police for being here and right now if Josh pans
[47:18.960 --> 47:22.760]  around you can see there's a police officer who's followed us over here to
[47:22.760 --> 47:26.440]  keep an eye on us we're obviously media we're sitting here filming and they are
[47:26.440 --> 47:29.840]  following us meanwhile tons of other vehicles are coming through and no
[47:29.840 --> 47:33.440]  cops are bothering them whatsoever it's just us the journalists out here that's
[47:33.440 --> 47:36.920]  because they've got just like in Ferguson the police it's not looters are
[47:36.920 --> 47:40.240]  that are the problem it's it's press that are nonviolent everywhere they're
[47:40.240 --> 47:43.160]  being programmed that we're the enemy yeah because we're the ones want to
[47:43.160 --> 47:46.680]  expose the truth what's really going on they hate that they don't like that we're
[47:46.680 --> 47:51.440]  the the outlet for the truth for the the entire people to see they hate every
[47:51.440 --> 47:55.760]  single bit of that absolutely tell us what else you've seen well yesterday I
[47:55.760 --> 47:59.720]  took Josh to a couple spots that you know I've been out here to McCallen quite
[47:59.720 --> 48:03.200]  a few times over the months and you know over the past few months we've been
[48:03.200 --> 48:06.920]  reporting how there's just been nobody wide open areas we got out there
[48:06.920 --> 48:11.800]  yesterday there was army out there air force yeah there was a soldier on each
[48:11.800 --> 48:17.320]  Humvee on top with binoculars looking helicopters in the air the park here
[48:17.320 --> 48:23.080]  where I'm at there's I would say maybe 20 30 police vehicles boats set up
[48:23.080 --> 48:27.440]  helicopters are flying by every now and then they've dev definitely amped up
[48:27.440 --> 48:32.160]  their security and I don't know if this is for the cry about you know with what
[48:32.160 --> 48:36.800]  Governor Perry did trying to call in the National Guard or is this because of
[48:36.800 --> 48:41.920]  what General Kelly said over the week talking about how the Ebola virus had
[48:41.920 --> 48:45.560]  come into Central America and then essentially start spreading through there
[48:45.560 --> 48:49.200]  and then pushing all the patients who know they've been in contact with
[48:49.200 --> 48:52.280]  somebody and are scared and want to try to live so they're going to come into
[48:52.280 --> 48:57.160]  America so who knows at this point but they've definitely amped up security and
[48:57.160 --> 49:02.200]  it's not easy to move around here as much anymore well that's good because
[49:02.200 --> 49:04.880]  you're supposed to have the feds on the border that's the only place they're
[49:04.880 --> 49:07.800]  supposed to be you're supposed to have the army on the border now are those
[49:07.800 --> 49:12.280]  big army or National Guard you saw the army I saw was National Guard because
[49:12.280 --> 49:15.340]  they had that little arrowhead patch with a T so I think that's the Texas
[49:15.340 --> 49:20.080]  National Guard but the air force I'm not sure why they would be out here the
[49:20.080 --> 49:22.840]  well what type of aircraft for they probably run an infrared or what do
[49:22.840 --> 49:26.840]  you think they just had a Humvee was something some kind of device on top
[49:26.840 --> 49:29.920]  so I'm not sure maybe some kind of listening device that's all I could
[49:29.920 --> 49:33.920]  you know come do a well great job on that try to get up there and interview
[49:33.920 --> 49:38.200]  some of those folks or try to talk to their public affairs person yeah I try
[49:38.200 --> 49:42.000]  to talk to some of them yesterday they said as we couldn't talk to them we
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.520]  couldn't film them so I mean they didn't want us to be around them anywhere
[49:45.520 --> 49:49.840]  well by the way you they can't tell you that you can't film them I mean they
[49:49.840 --> 49:54.720]  can refuse an interview but they can't tell you not to film them yeah did we
[49:54.720 --> 49:58.760]  get footage of them yes good job let's get those reports out well you heard me
[49:58.760 --> 50:03.000]  ranting earlier and you were on air a month ago saying the same thing when
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.000]  you were down on the border the default was to put them in special level for
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.600]  emergency facilities they have under bio shield 36 locations they already are
[50:12.600 --> 50:18.160]  set up for this it was never put a bowl of patients in the mainline Atlanta
[50:18.160 --> 50:23.840]  hospital or the mainline Dallas hospital with people untrained to deal with it of
[50:23.840 --> 50:28.520]  course it was going to give healthcare workers the disease so now they're
[50:28.520 --> 50:33.000]  letting them fly in as reportedly people are coming off airplane vomiting in
[50:33.000 --> 50:37.080]  Boston New York you name it out of Africa people are on strike now we're
[50:37.080 --> 50:44.720]  into week two as airline workers freak out who knows how many Ebola victims
[50:44.720 --> 50:48.880]  that are carrying the diseases vectors are already in the US Joe what do you
[50:48.880 --> 50:52.120]  think's really going on here well you got to think though when this influx of a
[50:52.120 --> 50:55.720]  the quote-unquote children were coming across the borders what we start
[50:55.720 --> 50:59.440]  building along the borders Alex all these different facilities a housing now
[50:59.440 --> 51:05.000]  we have that same facility that a Don kit and John bound and I filmed when
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.640]  they were putting it up and getting ready to bring in it's still there I
[51:07.640 --> 51:10.960]  drove by it this morning I saw it yesterday it's fenced in they still
[51:10.960 --> 51:16.200]  have the FEMA bus in there there's not as many of the smaller whole
[51:16.200 --> 51:19.560]  insecurity buses but they're still got something going on in there and it's
[51:19.560 --> 51:23.240]  secretive and it's shut off so that's definitely a spot where they could be
[51:23.240 --> 51:26.920]  doing something like that disappearing people and putting them in there well
[51:26.920 --> 51:30.160]  that's what the border patrol from two different sources have told us one on
[51:30.160 --> 51:35.520]  record as this has been going on for months and again it'd be one thing if
[51:35.520 --> 51:38.000]  they were quarantining people they should be public about it so it's not
[51:38.000 --> 51:43.160]  secret detainment but then they would have default shut down the flights if
[51:43.160 --> 51:47.000]  they shut down the flights recording teaming people day one and grabbing
[51:47.000 --> 51:50.480]  folks at the border I'd say well it's sad but has to happen this is a very
[51:50.480 --> 51:55.960]  deadly disease but instead they're leaving it open while running what looks
[51:55.960 --> 52:02.320]  like a training op on the border to me it's mind blown because you know all
[52:02.320 --> 52:06.840]  these other countries have nipped it in the bud already months ago stopped those
[52:06.840 --> 52:10.840]  flights from West Africa so the American people still are blind to the fact that
[52:10.840 --> 52:14.480]  this is a planned event you know our government's left the borders wide open
[52:14.480 --> 52:18.400]  down here where we're at now and they've left the air completely open they're
[52:18.400 --> 52:21.480]  letting the planes fly into our airspace from West Africa they're
[52:21.480 --> 52:25.720]  allowing this to happen to create this huge outbreak this pandemic and like you
[52:25.720 --> 52:28.840]  said once it gets to a certain point that's when they enact those FEMA
[52:28.840 --> 52:32.200]  camps that's when they start detaining people every time you have a cough you
[52:32.200 --> 52:34.600]  look like you have some kind of respiratory illness then President
[52:34.600 --> 52:38.480]  Obama's executive order comes into play then you start being detained and next
[52:38.480 --> 52:41.840]  thing you know everybody's getting scooped up by the bus loads and ushered
[52:41.840 --> 52:46.800]  off to some camp I think the verdict is clear I'm gonna open the phones up in
[52:46.800 --> 52:51.120]  the third hour after Joel Scalzen leaves us but I there's no other way to look at
[52:51.120 --> 52:56.560]  it the government is run by criminals they have allowed people to come in to
[52:56.560 --> 53:00.400]  create a big crisis so they can have political distractions from all of
[53:00.400 --> 53:04.680]  Obama's scandals and bring in medical tyranny and a precedent for forced
[53:04.680 --> 53:09.040]  inoculation with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that's what this is
[53:09.040 --> 53:13.080]  that's how you bring down a country that's how you bring in tyranny they
[53:13.080 --> 53:16.680]  used al-Qaeda that they funded and helped protect to bring in the police
[53:16.680 --> 53:20.440]  state now they're gonna use the police state on the Ebola that they protect it
[53:20.440 --> 53:24.160]  as well meet the new boss same as the old boss job well they're using this as a
[53:24.160 --> 53:28.200]  way to to push the flu shot just two days ago in Fox on that judge Janine
[53:28.200 --> 53:34.000]  show Justice she had on a doctor from New York City and he said you know it
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.040]  right now he's like there's a huge scare because everybody that has a coffee
[53:37.040 --> 53:40.280]  automatically get quarantined brought into a hospital and everyone's in a panic
[53:40.280 --> 53:44.960]  and uh Janine or judge any she goes well what are we gonna do to stop that how
[53:44.960 --> 53:49.120]  do we how do we stop the confusion and he said well everybody needs to go get
[53:49.120 --> 53:52.400]  their flu shot everyone needs to get the flu shot everyone needs to get he said
[53:52.400 --> 53:56.560]  like three times so this is another way to push a vaccine exactly he said this
[53:56.560 --> 53:59.680]  is how we determine now he's like if everyone gets a flu shot then you're
[53:59.680 --> 54:02.600]  not gonna get the flu so the people that have flu like symptoms we're gonna
[54:02.600 --> 54:06.440]  already know probably have a bowl and that's how we stop by the way let's walk
[54:06.440 --> 54:10.600]  through that fraud for new listeners look it up for yourself the flu shot that
[54:10.600 --> 54:16.160]  they have predicted the year before that predict the mutation has never picked
[54:16.160 --> 54:21.600]  the the right mutation and on record lowers your immune system by 50% for
[54:21.600 --> 54:25.800]  at least one year when you take it against other viral pathogens if you
[54:25.800 --> 54:29.440]  don't believe me just type into Google flu shot lowers viral immunity
[54:29.440 --> 54:36.240]  University of Ottawa studies University of Texas studies Harvard Medical Center
[54:36.240 --> 54:41.000]  studies okay folks it lowers your immunity so would you want to take a
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.240]  flu shot if it lowers your immunity to other viruses for at least a 12 month
[54:45.240 --> 54:48.960]  period Joe well this is the thing though I've been out of the army almost two
[54:48.960 --> 54:53.400]  years now not once have I gotten the flu when I was an army and I was lined up
[54:53.400 --> 54:58.160]  like cattle and forced to take the flu vaccine or the spray I got the flu so
[54:58.160 --> 55:02.440]  many times I would get the flu horribly one to two days later then I would
[55:02.440 --> 55:06.080]  finally get out of it and by then I've missed a week of work and lost weight
[55:06.080 --> 55:10.000]  then I would get it again mysteriously and then the then the military is like
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.360]  why do you keep getting sick you got the flu show why do you keep getting sick
[55:12.360 --> 55:15.120]  we're gonna give you an article 15 you're trying to malinger you're trying
[55:15.120 --> 55:18.440]  to get out of work and I'm like no this flu shot makes you sick why can't you
[55:18.440 --> 55:22.000]  guys see that meanwhile the guys who are telling me that aren't even getting the
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.440]  flu shot the higher-ranking people don't get it on record they force it on the
[55:26.440 --> 55:31.960]  lowest the younger soldiers so it's completely total BS I mean that thing
[55:31.960 --> 55:36.280]  don't take it I don't know any general enlisted that are for vaccines because of
[55:36.280 --> 55:39.120]  all the nightmares they've been through that's why the military so awake they
[55:39.120 --> 55:42.400]  have been used as guinea pigs they've been given the anthrax shot all of it
[55:42.400 --> 55:45.160]  it's disgusting Joe we're gonna go to break I want to come back and get five
[55:45.160 --> 55:49.720]  minutes with Josh and then great job get out there finish your reports and then
[55:49.720 --> 55:53.480]  do that now on the street and then come back to Austin the former Staff Sergeant

[56:03.440 --> 56:06.160]  spreading in Central and South America thank you Joe we're gonna go to break
[56:06.160 --> 56:10.480]  here and come back and get Josh Owens take as well he's the camera guy but
[56:10.480 --> 56:14.840]  he's a great reporter in his own right I want to get his view on this before we
[56:14.840 --> 56:19.080]  go any further you know what I'm personally doing from my research for
[56:19.080 --> 56:24.260]  myself and my family I went home early from work yesterday and I went to a
[56:24.260 --> 56:27.440]  local community pool with my kids because it was sunny and I got him two
[56:27.440 --> 56:32.640]  hours of sun I left early I got him early I went and I got him son all the
[56:32.640 --> 56:36.080]  major studies all of its son is so important that's why stuff spreads so
[56:36.080 --> 56:38.960]  bad during the winter because the different chemicals and different
[56:38.960 --> 56:42.600]  hormones and different vitamins that don't get released in your body and
[56:42.600 --> 56:47.640]  don't get produced in your body you know it's not just vitamin D without son so
[56:47.640 --> 56:51.380]  son is numeral uno can't live with it can't live without it yeah it ends up
[56:51.380 --> 56:54.560]  giving you skin cancer later and you know but that's just part of it you're
[56:54.560 --> 56:57.800]  meant to get sun folks that's why white people that are from the north have white
[56:57.800 --> 57:01.120]  skin to get more of it because you need it if you're by the equator you got black
[57:01.120 --> 57:05.840]  skin because you don't need more of it comprende folks especially white people
[57:05.840 --> 57:10.080]  need sun and then you got black folks with sunscreen and stuff the studies on
[57:10.080 --> 57:14.480]  them it's even worse when they don't get it so you want to get cancer you want to
[57:14.480 --> 57:19.760]  get sick bottom line don't get sign vitamin B12 vitamin D that's what I'm

[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:43.160]  planet dot com is down on the Texas border right on the Rio Grande with Joe
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:49.320]  Biggs give us your take Josh on what you've witnessed down there well
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:54.240]  yesterday when we were out here we saw that the security like Joe said was
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.640]  has been amped up and we were in Arizona when we were in California all along the
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.200]  border where we've been we haven't seen I mean basically the border has been wide
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:06.840]  open not to say that the border isn't still wide open but just in this area in
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:11.760]  McAllen where it's been open before there seems to be heightened security
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.000]  heightened border patrol heightened police and as people can see the video
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.880]  we posted yesterday we were pulled over just for simply driving around and
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:26.840]  shooting video which is sad because it's not surprising to us at least it's not
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:32.560]  surprising to me because it happens all the time but if you really step back and
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.880]  look at it it's pretty ridiculous when you're driving through a park you're
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.080]  driving through a public place even if it's not a public place you're in an
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.840]  area trying to report what's going on and that I mean there are plenty of
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.560]  other people driving around here they're not getting pulled over they're not
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.560]  getting followed we still have this cop right right over here in front of me
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.320]  that's still sitting there just watching us and I mean obviously we're being
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:57.920]  criminals by standing here talking I mean it's pretty ridiculous and I
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.120]  believe I don't see how anyone could disagree with how ridiculous there is a
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.080]  war on the press everywhere and the police are being ordered whether it's
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:09.880]  New York City or McAllen Texas it doesn't matter look what happened in
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.320]  Ferguson where we were even there especially at first you know more
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.400]  pro-police we're against looting and rioting and then they would attack
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:23.000]  jacari attack Joe attack you attack Al Jazeera and then now they've got folks
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.320]  in st. Louis running around looting you know racially motivated it's really
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.400]  spiraling out of control and we're not even sending reporters because we'll
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:35.440]  just be attacked by the crowd and by the police and it's like in America the
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.920]  most horrible thing in the world is the press I mean it's just incredible yeah
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.000]  it's sad when you come to expect it every trip we go on you come to expect
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.800]  to just be harassed and like you're saying with all the nurses being
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:52.240]  concerned about Ebola my mom is a phlebotomist near the CDC in Atlanta
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:57.000]  she's you know maybe 45 minutes outside of Atlanta and she's concerned and you
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.800]  know they are I guess forced to get the flu vaccine at the office they can
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:07.360]  choose not to but you know they're almost chastised but from living I don't
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.000]  wear a mask all the time which is a great idea I wear a mask all the time
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.520]  working at one of those sick hospitals with all those deadly bugs in them I
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.480]  would much rather wear a mask and then have thimerosal mercury metals shot into
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:23.080]  my body which is going to give me the flu everyone I know that gets the flu
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:27.120]  has gotten the flu shot my mother my mother was used to be a triathlete like
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.080]  15 20 years ago and almost killed her to get the flu shot there's a reason nobody
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:35.800]  likes vaccines because you take it you get deathly ill exactly and like you've
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:42.320]  said we'll see what happens I mean it seems like if this if if Ebola keeps
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.400]  spreading and more and more people keep getting it which it seems like is
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:50.960]  highly likely because they they they're quarantine quarantining some people but
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.840]  it seems like other people it's almost like like the press conference we were
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.840]  out in Dallas it was just well you know it's not a big deal someone has to
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.320]  basically vomit into an open wound for you to get Ebola which everyone knows
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.000]  is total BS and is not true at all because these nurses who are wearing the
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.640]  proper safety gear are still getting Ebola and I'm sure that that they're I
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.360]  mean I don't this isn't a fact but it's just what I believe is that at some
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.360]  point they're being pressured to come out and say oh well I accidentally touched
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:24.920]  my face you know I broke protocol it's my fault when in all honesty they're
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:31.400]  trying to keep to make it seem as though Ebola is this look somebody puts
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:36.160]  rags with all the blood and stuff some of it gets aerosolized it goes out the
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.400]  door somebody breathes it that's what's happening and that's not even technically
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.200]  airborne it's in a particulate but the question is will the virus give the
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.200]  point of actually being airborne and that's what nurses are now asking will
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.440]  play that video coming up and talk to the expert on strategic relocation safe
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:59.560]  places in the U.S. Joel Scowzen I'm Alex Jones your host in full wars.com

[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:07.360]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:27.160]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.360]  well the UN has different numbers four hundred thousand one point four million
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:35.040]  German virologist said I think five million people will end up getting a
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:41.120]  Ebola whatever the case really is the defaults of not letting people fly in
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.640]  from West African countries of not putting Ebola patients in regular
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.000]  hospitals all of that has been ignored I believe so they can let it start to
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.520]  spread to create a big crisis to then try to force a vaccine that happens to
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:05.240]  come out in December a whole new polio hysteria my grandmother Benny Hammond
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:12.880]  polio in the early 1950s my mother was like four years old one month after she
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:18.920]  took the polio vaccine so there you go boys and girls and it's on record that a
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:23.000]  lot of people got polio from the vaccine nowadays they give the vaccine and they
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:29.240]  call it paralysis not polio just like Guillaume beret from the H1N1 shot so
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:33.000]  it's a whole social engineering agenda it's not that I don't believe that the
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.320]  science of inoculation isn't real isn't valid doesn't work in some cases but
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:40.720]  there's always side effects there's a cost-benefit analysis they get up on the
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.560]  news and say no side effects safe and effective it's the law take shots to go
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:50.240]  to school there is no law they lie about it and so I'm very very suspicious this
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:57.680]  was shot off Dallas television it's up on info wars.com and the headline was
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:04.120]  Steve Watson is Dallas nurse Isabola airborne now let's play that clip and
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:32.080]  then we will now that's Fox forb the lady that caught this Anna was a nurse and
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:40.280]  was wearing full gear now we have a nurses as of last week in Spain who got
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.680]  it again the default from the CDC as you put them in level four facilities in
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:49.840]  government facilities now they're in Bloomberg today dedicated Ebola hospital
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.800]  sought after nurses infection and they're saying oh the CDC is looking at
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:11:00.120]  putting them now at one of the 36 or more bio shield government labs yeah
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:05.920]  that's already the default so why did they ignore this to have plausible
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.960]  deniability is this just a primer for another controlled outbreak later
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.080]  because they tend to do these in tests they're scientists that they want to
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:18.600]  study the effect remember we have a government with thousands of declassified
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:25.000]  tests on poor blacks poor whites Appalachia kids to skeaky blacks troops
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.480]  pregnant wives of GIs oh here's some vitamin pills really uranium plutonium
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:35.440]  strontium just to quote see what it do to the babies we had 36,000 Nazis after
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:39.520]  World War two brought over here on the rat line did not just run NASA not just
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:44.880]  run the intelligence agencies but run it all so you have this the scientific
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:51.960]  dictatorship in the west of eugenesis for my research just pure devils and then
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.200]  you've got them competing with other power blocks as Joe Scalzen has said and
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.240]  Joe Scalzen joins us editor-in-chief of World Affairs brief best-selling
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:05.560]  author undoubtedly and we've had a lot of other top relocation and survival
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:10.400]  on and I want to get Wesley Rawls on by the way as soon as he wants to come on
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:17.280]  because he just wrote a book about a bio outbreak and worldwide collapse what
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:21.160]  timing I think that came out last year maybe earlier this year but Joe
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.040]  Scalzen's written the nonfiction book strategic relocation North American
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.440]  guy to save places third edition but he's lived all over the world this has
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:33.880]  maps of the safest places country by country region by region so powerful
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:38.440]  two years ago we made a film with him that augments it and updates the book
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:42.720]  strategic relocation Joe Scalzen it tells the safest places to live and how
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:48.200]  to secure your home both the book and the film discounted I produce the film
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:54.080]  are available at infowarstore.com and if you already have the book or the
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:58.200]  video you should re-watch it again he of course is the worldwide best-seller of
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.760]  the secure home than a number one best-seller for decades there's I think
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:06.760]  a third edition now we carry that just came out so it's all available at
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:16.400]  infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139 and your purchase supports the broadcast what
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:21.320]  we're doing here so I want to look at big picture first what he thinks is going
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:28.400]  on with the Sibola with its history clearly they want to create panic they
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.520]  didn't want to until it was spreading they don't want to let a good crisis go
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:37.320]  to waste clearly it's mutated I don't know if it's airborne but it it chest
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:43.080]  age it incubates for 21 days not three so allows it to spread now can bats fly
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.200]  over in Africa use the bathroom and then you breathe it that's probably the main
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:51.600]  reason it's spreading it's clearly becoming stronger it was a weak virus
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:58.000]  outside the body very strong inside the body with a 70% morbidity morbidity
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.440]  rate so Joel Scousen joins us about 15 minutes into the next hour then we'll
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:07.800]  have open phones Joel what's your breakdown on what's happening well it's
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:13.920]  going to be with you again Alex I think the jury is out still on a lot of a
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.960]  number of issues that you've brought up there are clearly clear possibilities
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:24.960]  that the United States has tinkered with the Ebola you know there's no reason to
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:29.640]  have a CDC patent on a particular strain of Ebola unless you're planning on
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:35.160]  weaponizing it or worse you want to make sure that the powers that be have a
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:43.560]  proven vaccine so that they're protected no bio weapons are very indiscriminate
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:47.520]  in who they pick and so unless you're guaranteed that you have a level of
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:54.080]  protection you don't let a bio weapon out in the world I'm not sure this is it
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:15:01.720]  in particular it may be a preliminary to something bigger further on really to
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:07.240]  be a good bio weapon it's got to be airborne and I think it's pretty clear
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:12.440]  that unless this mutation occurs that Ebola is not yet airborne except for
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:18.600]  the fact that micro droplets whether through a sneeze or a cough or even a
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:25.480]  laugh from an Ebola infect in person does become airborne it isn't to the same
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:30.960]  extent that other viruses like the flu are we're merely breathing around and
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:35.760]  it lingers in the air can infect somebody but still it's clear that this is
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:42.120]  contaminating other people who have not had real direct contact but it is more
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:47.040]  difficult in the sense that so far the 48 people they've been monitoring in
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:53.520]  Dallas don't have signs of Ebola yet the deputy sheriffs that thought he had
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:58.600]  Ebola turned out to be the flu he has not been contaminated but several others
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.800]  are who as you have pointed out were in full protective suits to me this
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:07.440]  indicates that this is of course extremely dangerous once it gets inside
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:12.600]  of you I'm not sure that all of their medical protocols are really all that
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.480]  effective they talked about the Dallas hospital putting him on kidney
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:23.240]  dialysis and ventilation but you know there are other treatments in the
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:26.680]  alternative field that are so much more effective than those one of those is
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:32.800]  where you have an external body purifier you know almost like a heart lung
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.120]  machine basically you take the blood out of body put it through an ultraviolet
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:40.120]  light in a machine and then they put it right back into the body that's what all
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:44.200]  the rich people do this is a regular monthly treatment and it really works
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:50.400]  you know I had a daughter with MSRA a real tough staff affection and she took
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.520]  a couple of these treatments and it cleared right up when nothing in
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:59.800]  antibiotics and the typical medical establishment would do it so what I'm
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:05.040]  worried about ultimately is that they are going to use this Ebola scare right
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:12.120]  now to justify some mandatory or preparatory for mandatory vaccines and
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.200]  as you know the when you start doing vaccines in a mass produced where you
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:23.120]  get lots of infections lots of side effects and it's very difficult to
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:27.880]  maintain a purity when you're developing a vaccine in a mass thing I think that
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:32.280]  for the elite they probably have some very carefully sterilized vaccines that
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.120]  they can take with some safety well just to back you up it came out during the
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:39.920]  age one and one that the German elite and even the top brass as well as the
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.800]  British and the Chinese had quote a clean vaccine made in limited lots for
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:49.960]  them yeah and I think that's real and very possible I mean clearly as you said
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:55.880]  the vaccine immunology is a proven technology but it has been a disaster in
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:01.200]  terms of mass vaccination of people and clearly the adjuvants that are put in
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:04.440]  there and the preservatives the mercury and the other things in there are
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:10.440]  damaging to people especially young children you know I think anybody who
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:15.000]  survives and inoculation does so because their immune system is tough enough to
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.240]  fight it but you start giving this stuff to children and young people and babies
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.760]  worst of all who don't have a developed immune system and I think that's
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:28.480]  criminal in its in its difficulty I'm not sure Alex if this is going to turn
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:35.120]  into a worldwide panic I personally my gut feeling is it's not but it's going
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:38.680]  to get bad enough that it's going to engage a great deal of government
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:42.640]  propaganda a great deal of government mandatory action and get people
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:49.040]  conditioned for obeying those orders and so as I've said a long time you know
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.000]  if there was ever a need for people to prepare in advance for strategic
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.160]  relocation whether it's even for a friend you've got to get out of big
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:02.920]  cities you've got to do self-quarantine if these things are coming to pass you
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:07.160]  can't go to church you can't send your kids to school and you don't go into a
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:11.640]  big office building because you know the amount of contamination that you can
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:18.200]  get there is significant you know people have to watch this carefully you
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:23.240]  don't bail out of your job just because of the potential but when people start
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:28.120]  to show up ill in the community and there's a chance that it could be near
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.360]  an office you're going to have to establish a policy of taking a leave of
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:37.120]  absence hoping that your employer will understand but you've got to get rural
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:41.240]  and very rural that's right those cows and stay there I want because you're

[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:57.280]  airborne Ebola outbreak would look like and the type of disruption it would

[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:19.280]  short segment long segment coming up where we'll get into a lot of issues with
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:25.200]  Joel Scousen but Joel I forgot to ask one question before we get into what a
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:31.240]  real mutated Ebola let's just say it happens naturally would look like and
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:34.360]  and how the powers that be would try to respond to that we know who they've been
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:38.360]  testing it for 30 years manipulating it trying to create cures for
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:43.600]  themselves we know a lot of cures get warehoused we know that they create a lot
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:47.160]  of secret vaccines for themselves again that was in the news five six years ago
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:52.440]  with the H1N1 that the headline if you type into Google was something like you
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:58.280]  know German elite or top government officials in Germany have clean vaccine
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:01.800]  and that they have their own little special vaccines we know that goes on
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:08.880]  but why would the CDC bring people in and have Ebola for the first time ever
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.680]  and then put them in regular hospitals why would they send this guy's kids to
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:18.120]  school for a few days why would they not clean out the ambulance why would they
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:23.680]  not follow the containment that is already federal law and federal policy
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:30.400]  why would they ignore the default well it's a tough question I do think there's
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:36.240]  a great deal of inertia in the medical establishment everybody thinks they have
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:40.600]  protocols at Dallas for these types of things they are as strict as the CDC
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:44.760]  protocols or at Emory Hospital for example one of the top in the nation
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:53.200]  but a lot of these things happen and people are scrambling I mean for example
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:58.520]  the the first hospital that Duncan showed up at and his symptoms weren't high enough
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:01.680]  you know I think Duncan came into the country absolutely knowing he had Ebola
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:06.560]  he quit his job without telling anybody he was leaving that indicated that there
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:11.000]  was some ulterior motive there and getting to the United States I think he
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.880]  checks himself into the hospital there and his symptoms weren't developed
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:18.520]  enough to get a conclusive diagnosis even though he was eager to tell them
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:22.720]  that I'd come from Liberia should have been a warning signal but I think we're
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:26.600]  dealing with people who haven't got into this they've been given some general
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.720]  instructions if there's a pandemic but when it comes right down to you and
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:34.000]  you're facing with something there's a little bit of denial people aren't up to
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.680]  speed it takes one of these big mistakes in order to get people on notice so it's
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:43.240]  more of a learned helplessness that the system has engineered into Americans to
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:48.440]  be totally unself sufficient totally spectator based that people are just
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:52.880]  blindsided and totally dependent and trusting on the medical establishment
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.440]  that is the biggest mistake people can make is to trust the medical
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:59.640]  establishment that they know what they're doing they have a built-in
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:04.440]  hostility towards natural cures and and while I'm the first to admit that these
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:09.240]  things are really tough bugs and that I'm not saying that a natural cure once
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:13.400]  you get fully developed or Ebola is going to save you but it certainly will
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:18.120]  help you know make your immune system stronger if you prepare and there's lots
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:22.480]  of inner information on the internet here's a here's an issue that we need
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:26.920]  to really discuss though Alex is about the mutated forms that happen it's very
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:32.840]  difficult to experimentally change Ebola into something that's bio weaponized
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:38.000]  except by introducing it to massive populations and letting each of those
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.720]  unique immune systems deal with the virus and wait till the virus mutates
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:48.360]  itself and that may be one of the prime things that's happened here is trying to
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:53.480]  get a mutated form by allowing this to spread widely among the population
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:58.040]  exactly that's what a lot of experts are saying is that oh no what if bad actors
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:02.520]  or terrorists get a hold of any of these people and get a mutated virus well the
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:07.520]  CDC and the UN are in there with tens of thousands of patients getting blood
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:12.240]  samples and you know those are being sent off to the bio weapons labs that's
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:15.840]  right now here's what happens though remember that if you're going to do a
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.240]  bio weapon and you're going to protect yourself as the elite with a special
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.800]  vaccine you really have to wait to get to that mutated form and they haven't
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:27.520]  got there yet they haven't got to the totally airborne and once they get to
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:31.920]  the airborne form Ebola they've got to then develop a vaccine specifically for
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:35.120]  that so you see if you're going to put something out now and you're going to
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.960]  expect it to mutate to be a more bio weapon effective thing this isn't the
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:45.320]  time to do it I think that's why I'm saying I'm not very confident this is
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:49.840]  going to turn into the worldwide pandemic because it is so far very
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.520]  difficult to transmit well Joel I agree with you because I've just studied the
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:57.320]  modus operandi of the scientific technocracy that's my word for them I
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:01.800]  want to get your word for them is they do test things incrementally and then
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:06.920]  build up like their false flags get bigger and more complex each time they
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:12.680]  like to try to organize things they're very OCD yes and I'll agree Alex and I
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:16.440]  think we're in this process of testing and probing it's just like chemtrails
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:19.880]  chemtrails are very real but they keep changing the pattern changing the
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:24.080]  chemicals they're trying to do something and not necessarily succeeding
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:28.200]  that's why they gave up on harp it wasn't interacting and augmenting the
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:31.920]  effect as previously desired that doesn't mean they're gonna stop
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:36.000]  chemtrailing and it doesn't mean they're gonna stop experimenting with bio
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.080]  weapons but as I say this is a progressive threat to us that won't
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:45.720]  happen until they're fully protected all right world affairs brief calm get the

[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:35.080]  deindustrializing the nation we really are an occupied country and only
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:39.520]  realizing that do we ever have a chance to begin to retake the nation via the
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:46.680]  states but as Joel Scowzen has said globalism is so evil so scientific so
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:51.720]  manipulative that our weakness is its strength our decadence is its power and
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:58.400]  I'm certainly on some high horse here and so everyone should start thinking
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:03.520]  about ways to survive in a collapsed society and we're going to talk about
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:07.320]  that coming up with Joel we're not being doom and gloom here it's hard to
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:12.840]  sustain a civilization this complex to begin with that's not debated by any
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:19.920]  anthropologist sociologist social planner city planner economist the more
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:26.640]  complex the more fragile you add to that the artificiality of agenda 21 an
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:35.480]  artificial scarcity to consolidate power by these groups the West not having 2.1
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:39.200]  children that will cause a collapse in and of itself you've got to have 2.1
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.080]  people for every two people that are already alive to just have social
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:48.360]  security and the social safety network work they're not going that direction
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:54.440]  they're going into a command in their words command destruction model and the
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:58.440]  way they've engineered society I see it as a bio weapon released down the road
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:03.400]  or them allowing something to develop and then opening the door a 12 monkey
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:09.520]  scenario as one of the main tools they might pull instead of a nuclear war
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:15.920]  with Russia because all the preparations are being made for that so Joel if you
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:22.240]  would go through your view looking at the US first but then other parts of the
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:27.560]  world of what would happen if real airborne Ebola went viral in West
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:33.360]  Africa you know let's say three years from now or if this was to mutate and go
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.440]  airborne what you would expect to see we're already seeing panicking with only
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:41.840]  two people in the US known to have had it one dead one alive what would happen
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:47.320]  if thousands started to get it what would happen if it went airborne and what
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:53.840]  would someone who was prepared do versus someone who wasn't prepared well the
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:59.480]  first thing it would happen you would have mandatory quarantine happening and
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:05.080]  even before a mass vaccination it takes them a certain time to gear up if in
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:09.200]  fact I show up with millions of doses of vaccine in advance and you know it was
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:14.640]  planned there has to be a period of time for them to develop a vaccine and to go
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:19.800]  forward with it if it's real but in any case mass quarantine is the major
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:24.680]  problem that you face because as this sheriff's deputy he came in down with
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.600]  some flu symptoms and he got labeled potentially Ebola and put into quarantine
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:33.720]  had this happened in a mass quarantine situation where a lot of people are
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:38.080]  coming down sick with it and you happen to have the flu or a cold or fever or
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:41.640]  something and get tagged and put into a mass quarantine you're going to get the
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:47.160]  Ebola because you're put into a quarantine with other people and just like the
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:50.520]  Superdome during Katrina you're not going to have the kind of facilities I
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:55.800]  don't care what the CDC says you can't have extremely controlled medical
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:00.440]  protocols in mass quarantine situations it simply overwhelms the medical
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:05.000]  system even in Liberia you know they're already out of hospital beds and how do
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.560]  you build more facilities to handle the exponential increase in clients so what
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:17.680]  happens is you have to carefully watch this at the first hand going to be mass
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:23.200]  quarantine you have to get out of dodge you have to then implement your
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:27.600]  strategic relocation plans to get out into the rural areas it's going to be in
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:31.840]  the urban areas where those mass quarantines occur you just don't want to
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.240]  have the risk of being in one of those dragnets once it starts to go airborne
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:42.520]  it will map rapidly multiply they're talking now about two to one meaning
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:46.080]  it's doubling for every patient infects two more well that's really quite a
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:51.120]  slow infection rate compared to the Spanish flu when it was 10 and sometimes
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:56.920]  20 to one now it never gets to the whole population at least 30% of the
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:01.440]  population at least from historical statistics has a tough enough immune
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:07.360]  system that they won't get sick even and didn't during the Spanish flu as tough
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:12.760]  as that was and probably won't get a Ebola even if it's airborne the airborne
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:17.320]  strains are always a little bit weaker than the contact contact strains so
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:21.840]  even though they spread more rapidly they're a little bit weaker form and so
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:26.400]  probably going to be more survivable but clearly you don't want to get into the
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.560]  arms of government you don't want to go into a FEMA camp you don't want to go
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:34.840]  into a medical camp or quarantine if you can afford it now if you do get Ebola
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:39.000]  real Ebola you want to do self-quarantine and you keep yourself away from
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.360]  your family you have to have provisions for that as well so that you don't
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:50.400]  infect other people joe though entertain me for a moment what would an airborne
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:57.160]  outbreak look like what would that do to this civilization it depends on how
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:04.960]  fast it replicates itself among other people if it's a thing where one student
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:09.640]  comes in and all of a sudden half of the school is down with the illness and then
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:13.720]  the next week the rest of the school is down with the illness that's going to be
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:18.320]  mass panic I mean people are going to be leaving the city in droves they're
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:22.000]  going to be without any preparations they're going to be doing a strategic
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:27.080]  relocation and that's what would happen in a mass panic situation it would be the
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:31.120]  same thing happening as an EMP strike when you don't have electricity or food
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:36.280]  services it could be devastating now typically it doesn't happen that
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:42.480]  rapidly typically it grows slowly enough in other words it starts with one and
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:47.120]  three then one and five and then one and ten in terms of multiples and at the
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:51.080]  point it gets to one and ten the government is starting to put in mass
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:56.000]  quarantines and camps and other things I think they'd love to do that to have
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.840]  the excuse to build camps that can be used for other purposes in some future
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:06.960]  time once the infection wears itself out but it's really impossible to tell but
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.840]  I accept to say according to the speed I predict that it would at least get to
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:17.040]  the point where the government would do mass people control and containment
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:21.560]  control strategies which is devastating to your liberty devastating to your
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:25.440]  rights and that does give you time however to see the handwriting on the
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:28.920]  wall and say I'm getting out of town now before I get stuck in one of those
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:34.320]  quarantine camps well my gut my instinct is and I do have a little place out in
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.520]  the country but is to get even further out in the country but I'm here in Austin
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:44.360]  Texas trying to put on a defense of what's left of freedom but at the same
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:50.200]  time we need to divide our our energies into fighting to restore the republic
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:56.120]  fighting to warn people worldwide but also preparing ourselves because if
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:00.280]  folks that are aware of this information aren't somewhat prepared then
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:05.360]  we're not going to be around at the end of this when the UN and others come in
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:09.360]  and try to take control of society but if we do have groups spread out in the
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:13.320]  countryside in other areas those will end up being areas of stability into the
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:18.320]  future as you've said Joel well that's right Alex you know I've spoken to a lot
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:21.640]  of people around the nation like you have and the thing that worries me about
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:27.040]  our own constitutional conservative group is you get people talking about the
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:30.200]  positivism we're going to restore the Constitution we're going to beat this
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:33.960]  when we get rid of Obama we're going to win this and this I'm going to win
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:39.360]  mentality is antithetical towards preparation they just aren't preparing
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:43.240]  the most one of the most ill-prepared groups are those that think that they're
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:47.040]  going to win this battle politically now I'm not saying whether or not we are I
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:51.960]  think it's frankly given the power of the globalist and the conspiracy that I
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:56.040]  see I think it's unlikely that we're going to win as a nation doesn't mean
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:00.720]  that Lord won't provide pockets of liberty for us but we've got to survive
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:05.880]  the nuclear war that's coming we've got to survive the pandemic that's coming if
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:09.960]  you haven't prepared well in advance these are preparations that you can't
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:14.000]  just do on the fly it takes significant preparation in advance to do that and
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  like you I'm afraid as I say as we prepare to fight for liberty we still
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.160]  have to prepare you know the kind of preparations that you and I have to do
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:28.000]  Alex in order to maintain a lifeline I mean I'm preparing to be able through
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.280]  electronic or even radio means to transmit my writing a brief if I have
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:38.720]  to go into seclusion and have people who can then transmit that and I think
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:44.160]  everyone who's got a mission in life or is a target in life like you and I are
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:48.720]  have to prepare to be able to keep being effective even when you're kind of on
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:52.440]  having to be underground I want to shift gears before we look at geopolitical
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:43:00.080]  issues into further afield not just the global crime syndicate the globalist the
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:06.200]  Anglo-American system but the Russian power block the Chinese power block and
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:10.480]  some of the other sub crime syndicates out there or you look at a billion
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:15.280]  300 million Chinese that's a giant laboratory right there of different
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:20.000]  mutations we could see something naturally obviously mutate and I don't
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:26.200]  know how the establishment would deal with that but who else is out there that
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:31.680]  you're worried about who else might want to create some type of bio weapon well
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:36.880]  I really think there are only three major predator centers there's the Anglo-American
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:41.040]  globalist there's Russia and their China and and they are Russian China are
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:45.760]  temporarily temporarily aligned in order to take down the West and then they
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:51.680]  intend to tackle each other they all have very active bio weapon programs none
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:56.160]  of them seem to be experimenting on their own people however this seems to be
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:01.840]  only endemic to the unprincipled Anglo-American globalist and of course
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:06.960]  they pick on the Filipinos as they did with that abortifical doped vaccine that
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:10.840]  they get gave women in the Philippines they pick on the Africans they feel
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:17.600]  those are dispensable and so I think that's still preliminary the fact that
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:22.840]  they are picking on these what they consider dispensable low-life populations
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:29.080]  indicates that they aren't yet ready to attack at least pandemic wise the major
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:34.320]  ones but I really don't see any other predator forms out there I don't think
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:38.720]  in fact even the mafia these small criminal elements most of those have
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:42.880]  some ties to governments that keep them in power sure that's what Brazinski's
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:46.000]  written a bunch of books on that that they really allow the big syndicates to
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.920]  operate and then launder their money for the big banks that's even come out in
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:52.720]  Bloomberg hundreds of billions a year being laundered through Bank of America
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:58.960]  Wells Fargo and the like let me bring up this issue how do you describe the most
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:04.280]  dominant power group the Anglo-Americans how do you describe their mindset their
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:09.520]  vision from their writings from your uncle's writings Cleon Scalzen from your
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:12.960]  deep research because if you're a new listener Joel Scalzen is extremely well
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.720]  read I am extremely well read I learned stuff from him all the time so he really
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:20.200]  does know what he's talking about a lot of gravitas so I want to get your view
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:26.400]  from my research at the top they really are a scientific eugenics based cult
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:29.640]  believing that they're going to become God and merge with the machines in the
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:35.240]  colonized space and that through this transcendence to this super sapien that
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:40.280]  that the rest of us are profane and must be destroyed and die so it's almost like
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:44.120]  a counterfeit of what God does saying he'll test us on the planet and you know
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:48.280]  get his elect well they're saying we'll do it right here right now and that's
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.400]  really who they are and what they're setting up and I wanted to ask you how
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:55.840]  many people do you think they've recruited into their cult because it's
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:59.720]  well known that David Rockefeller and others personally would go around to get
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:03.480]  the people with the highest test scores in college and recruit them into their
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:06.880]  organizations my dad had some of the highest test scores across the board in
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:10.040]  Texas and they tried to recruit him it wasn't David Rockefeller but was the
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:13.680]  head of the body department okay and that's why my dad would read John Burt
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:17.960]  Society stuff and knew how accurate it was was because you know he was politically
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:23.480]  active conservative top of his class you know and so they tried to recruit him
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:27.400]  or he was a junior in high school were point blank with him about some of the
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:32.120]  larger ideas and you're gonna be part of the scientific elite and eugenics is
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:36.240]  bad with Hitler but ours is a good eugenics I mean the fact that even my
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:40.560]  dad was attempted to be brought into this it must just be massive how many
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:45.520]  people are part of the conspiracy and what is it who are they well you know
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:49.440]  the brain trust that they bring in they always keep at lower levels I don't know
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:53.000]  anybody and ever the scientific community within these that ever gets
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.860]  higher than second level and the second level by me and people like Henry
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:02.080]  Kissinger Brzezinski, Berent Scowcroft, Sandy Berger, Strobtal, but those
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:06.880]  national security advisors who manage and run run presidents and call the shots
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:12.600]  Henry Kissinger may well have moved into you know top areas like top echelons
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:17.320]  like David Rockefeller but clearly I don't see them at the tiest level as
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:23.720]  running this on a scientific basis and trying to manage the world themselves
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:29.480]  everything that the globalists tend to do is counter to anything that the most
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:34.160]  wealthy elite would normally do what bring a nuclear strike against your own
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:39.360]  nation destroying the very power base of your money no one in the right mind who
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:48.560]  has solely the motivation to power greed wine women's song and numerous locations
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:52.560]  around the world to vacation would do that to themselves I think these people
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:56.480]  the only thing that really explains their motive is as you said they are
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:01.360]  trying to escape the judgments of God they've made a pact with Satan and I
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:06.880]  think that it's revelatory from dark spiritual forces to these higher elite
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.040]  probably less than a hundred at the most that understand that sedent satanic
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:15.680]  connection but you know this has a generational effect it's been going on
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:22.560]  for centuries as you know Alex and then there's no man who can project 200 years
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:27.840]  in advance a plan so diabolical as the globalist have done and expected to be
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:31.200]  followed through the mafia can't handle something through two generations let
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:35.520]  alone three not speaking of you know two centuries and so it has to be
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:41.600]  revelatory it has to be guided and you know I think that there is not only the
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:46.560]  motivation of immunity that's given to people and certainly Bill Clinton acted
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:51.280]  in the presidency of his as if he had total immunity and and so to me and so
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:56.560]  does Barack Obama for that matter so that's how I think the thing operates
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:02.640]  it operates on a a satanic revelatory basis promising them that if you help
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:07.680]  me become the god of this world I'll protect you not only in this earth from
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:13.480]  immunity but in the life to come from the judgments of God and that's of course
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:19.040]  the Faustian story and at Bohemian Grove the entire ritual that I caught on
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:23.880]  video also skull and bones has been caught it's all about escaping judgment
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:28.320]  and when I was standing with over a thousand wealthy men movie stars bank
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:34.080]  heads a former vice presidents you name it were there they were more
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:38.320]  religiously in rapture than anything I've ever seen go into a Baptist church as a
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:42.680]  kid I mean they were really believed they were being given atonement and
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:46.960]  shielding from what they've done on this earth and they say that the high
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:52.040]  priest that was Walter Cronkite at the time he's now dead literally says this
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:55.880]  the whole rituals on video folks in my film dark secrets inside Bohemian
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:00.200]  Grove it's been on HBO it's been on trio channel it's been on Sundance film
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:06.440]  channel I mean this is real and for somebody like me I was kind of giggling
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:10.000]  a little bit and they looked at me like they wanted to kill me it was they were
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:17.240]  so serious Joel well that's incredible I think you did the world a great service
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:21.680]  by infiltrating the Bohemian Grove will be forever grateful but I think it's
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:27.280]  important to realize that very few people could handle that kind of a knowledge
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:32.720]  that this is satanic and its orientation people get very heavy very corrupted and
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:37.400]  higher up they'll do anything to maintain their position they also know that
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:41.400]  people get eliminated when they get cold feet and they start to talk and so
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:46.280]  that's also keeps them in in line but most people are brought in just like the
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:49.800]  scientific community to do mind control experience they're told there's some
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:54.400]  beneficial aspect oh yeah in justifies the means stay there Joel scowls and

[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.200]  spiritual nature of this I grew up in the richest county in Texas outside Dallas
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:02.520]  it was richest county in Texas at the time rock wall and I ended up knowing
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:06.720]  some of the kids of billionaires real billionaires who didn't show it off a
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:12.720]  bunch and if you scratched them you found serious occultism and I don't mean
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:19.600]  eastern stuff or New Age you know front door stuff I mean Luciferianism and I
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:24.560]  ran to that quite a bit and I don't run into that a lot in Austin it's more New
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:29.760]  Agey but when you talk about skull and bones bohemian grove you know about
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:35.080]  world leaders in rapture doing mock human sacrifices and believing that it
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:38.880]  atones them and that some goddess that they're praying to is going to remove
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:43.160]  their sins and protect them from what they've done and they put it on the body
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:48.320]  of this child that they're killing and burning just like they did in Leviticus
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:52.280]  they say give not your children the fires of Molek they really are at the
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:56.880]  bottom of the rabbit hole it really is a satanic conspiracy a few minutes on
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:02.400]  that in your research into it well you know there is some of that that is
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:07.360]  attributed just to satanic inspiration that talks to people's minds you know
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:12.080]  that drives them to suicide and dark thoughts and another weird type of things
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:17.480]  but at the higher levels the Faustian pack really is real I mean Satan does
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:21.920]  reveal himself to certain people who are susceptible who leave them I mean this
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:24.400]  doesn't happen to anybody who's just trying to do the right thing you've got
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:28.920]  to actually be actively seeking power you've got to be seeking to get ahead in
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:34.640]  the world you know in my opinion you take several of these and there's been
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:38.920]  several big books written on this about the New Age cults and relationship to
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:43.680]  the rock stars and who became rock stars and the dark agenda behind it and there
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:48.640]  seems to be a revelatory agenda there that you know if you tie into my system
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:54.320]  I will make you famous I'll drive into your mind you know melodies that will
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:59.400]  become popular then we'll make you a star and it happens you take Andrew Lloyd
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:04.680]  Weber's Phantom of the Opera it's filled with satanic dark dreams and
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:09.600]  there and they make Satan basically the image of the hero trying to get
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:15.640]  recognition making him the victim of discrimination and you know it just if
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:20.760]  there's ever a revelatory image of Satan trying to make it in this world to
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:25.400]  dethrone God and to become the hero it's the theme in the Phantom of the Opera
[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:31.600]  and I can't help but think when I look at the fact that many of those musical
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:36.600]  themes in the opera have been stolen from other pieces of music before and the
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:40.600]  rest hold on hold on this is powerful Joel Scousins our guest he's gonna stay
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:43.600]  with us see see how long he can stay in the next hour and take off see how long

[02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:32.240]  Alex Jones when you turn on I'll be honest with you even 10 years ago I'm a
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:36.520]  Christian but I didn't believe this was as widespread as it is even though I'd
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:43.480]  run into it as a teenager when you turn on MTV or the NFL and it's a full-on
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:49.680]  Egyptian ritual or satanic ritual when you say it's satanic they say oh you're a
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:53.480]  conspiracy terrorist and they're teaching it in school and the UN and
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:57.800]  others are persecuting Christians worldwide and bending over backwards
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:02.800]  even when it hurts their own interest to wipe them out and then you've got the
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:07.240]  infiltration of the major churches by the state I think that's the most
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:11.120]  powerful testament out there Joel Scowzen of world affairs brief calm is
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:17.920]  that the world is persecuting real Christianity anywhere it's found why is
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:25.360]  that well I think there is both a direct sanitized a satanic agenda a
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:29.320]  revelatory agenda to the globalist persecuting Christians they view that
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:36.040]  as the enemy and and then there's that inspirational view that even people who
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:40.280]  aren't directly involved you know get dark-side inspiration the more you get
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:44.000]  involved with sin and alternative lifestyles and things that go against
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.560]  God commandments the more susceptible do you become to those those types of
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:53.440]  inspirations and so obviously a lot of these people who are involved in a dark
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:02:01.280]  or new age or satanic agenda don't absolutely know it's satanic they've
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:04.760]  already dumbed down their conscience they're filled with chronic bad
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:10.760]  judgment and what speaks to their mind is often satanic inspiration so they get
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:14.120]  down a path and it's very hard to come back it's amazing to read some of the
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:17.960]  books on the new age conspiracy and how people get trapped into that and the
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:22.960]  few that have come out of that have given some very good descriptions of how
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:28.120]  you slowly get down into that area and it's hard to come back and of course you
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:33.560]  know mind-altering drugs Prozac and others which dulls the divine center of
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:39.080]  conscience it has a great deal of effect in helping American people or youth
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:44.720]  especially who are on these drugs get tied in with some alternate inspiration
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:50.880]  that is not good well the Bible talks about how the the magicians the occultists
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:55.560]  would use pharmacia to open themselves up to this and you look at how the system
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:03:00.520]  pushes these drugs that are in the hallucinogenic family on the public the
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:04.040]  general public is under a trance I don't know how we break them out of it
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:11.000]  John yeah it's it's tough one of the things obviously you don't get in public
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.720]  schools is discipline you don't get any reminders about the workings of
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:19.080]  conscience those are the only salvation morally in the nation unfortunately as
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:24.120]  you pointed out our churches have become so soft soft peddling the gospel soft
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:30.000]  peddling politics everything is feel-good social networking and and
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:35.960]  friendship in in our Christian societies we really need to alert and train youth
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:39.440]  from the youth up about the working subconscious and I'm talking about the
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:43.080]  two major signals the nervous feelings when something's not quite right that's
[02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:47.640]  telling you to pull out do something different or the pushing feelings the
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:51.480]  promptings to do something especially when you don't feel like it you know if
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:54.880]  I had known those two signals and been able to really relate to them as a
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:58.680]  teenager I would have got better grades wouldn't got into trouble you know with
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:03.560]  my peers it's amazing how every time I made a mistake in my youth I had a
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:06.840]  warning in conscience before and I can go back and remember that I had a
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:13.720]  warning that's what we need to train our youth in it's not just catechism it's
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:18.480]  not memorizing a systematic way to be good it's listening to the voice of
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:23.520]  conscience tying into that divine source and that voice is never wrong I
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:28.200]  realize in my life now that I'm always bucking against that voice and the more
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:32.000]  I just go with it I mean that's the answer right there how could people
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.640]  ignore something that powerful that's always right well it's interesting
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:42.160]  because it is a still small voice as the Bible says it's not a shouting
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:47.720]  screaming way it's a tiny whisper and it's so easy to disregard and that's why
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:51.560]  it also takes a great deal of self-control stay there incredible a
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:55.560]  short segment long segment coming up I'm gonna talk about that still voice that

[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:13.680]  indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of
[02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:17.560]  pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:21.640]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42

[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:36.920]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my

[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:32.880]  going to give the number out he's agreed to stay with us through the entire hour
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:37.040]  we'll start taking your phone calls actually in the next segment your
[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:41.120]  specific question or comment directed at Joel Scalzen that's the topic that
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:47.560]  we're covering it is a huge topic of preparedness Ebola satanism being at
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:56.240]  the heart of this this craven energy of destructiveness in the world system why
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:00.880]  have so many elites done things that are self-destructive in the end well even
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:05.960]  if you don't believe in a physical god or a physical devil the elite does and so
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:12.640]  through humans capacity to build things and to manifest things it's real whether
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:17.520]  you believe it's real or not because it's going on in the world and I can
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:22.120]  not tell you in my deep research over 20 plus years 20 years on air or like 25
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:29.080]  years of research that the bottom of the rabbit hole every time you could call it
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:37.880]  a they live conspiracy whatever the elites believe that they are channeling
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:43.440]  off-world intelligences and it fits the entity we read about in the Bible and
[02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:47.200]  quite frankly it pops up in a lot of other cultures as well but most those
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:50.880]  cultures end up following it and it always says build a pyramid and throw
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:57.040]  kids into a fiery pit I mean what is that some genetic anomaly that whether it
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:01.880]  was Druids or whether it was Aztecs or other Meso-Americans in the Mayan
[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:05.880]  culture or whether it was ancient Chinese culture they find human sacrifices
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:13.040]  or they find human sacrifice all over Africa what is going on here what is
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:18.680]  manifesting but notice the world doesn't want you to discuss that and you know
[02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:24.480]  Joel is a former Marine Corps officer fighter pilot Vietnam best-selling
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:30.600]  author he's a very conservative guy in his own right but he's saying at the
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:35.680]  bottom of the rabbit hole is this satanic conspiracy and the atheists get so mad
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:40.480]  when you raise that well listen I'm sorry as an anthropologist if I was an
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:47.480]  anthropologist or a sociologist there aren't really any atheist leaders it
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:51.000]  turns out linen was incredibly superstitious and into astrology and
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:56.800]  the occult Stalin was Hitler was obsessed with it and believe he was
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:02.080]  conjuring Norse gods to give him power I mean that's in the main line
[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:07.640]  literature they were doing human sacrifice at the SS castle I mean just
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:13.840]  bizarre stuff look at the black uniforms the death of the every culture ends up
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:17.120]  doing this and Joel I want you to spend some time because we never really do
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:21.200]  this on what is at the bottom of the rabbit hole and how we pull the curtain
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:24.920]  back because do you get my point that even if somebody doesn't believe in this
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:31.440]  as sociologists or anthropologists we can research the fact that elites are
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:38.360]  obsessed with dark gods that demand blood and that destroy civilizations why
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:48.760]  is that well it goes back to kind of the poison that Satan puts out upon the
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:53.800]  earth to protect himself just as if we find in the media you are not allowed
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:59.120]  to bring up the subject conspiracy even nominally conservative organization like
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:04.680]  Fox News O'Reilly Hannity will come out and crucify you if you mentioned
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:08.600]  consumer or they even hint you're heading in that direction which to me shows
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:13.080]  that they're on the other side they're not just rhino republicans they're
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:17.880]  actually on the other side masquerading as conservatives but in the same sense
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:24.240]  you look at the psychological profession psychiatrists cannot possibly help you
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:29.640]  in any great degree with mental problems because they are taught to deny the
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:35.840]  two most primal things that have to do with errant mental behavior they deny
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:41.240]  a session of your interaction with conscience they'll never ask you you
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:44.480]  know what kind of signals you get for conscience how you're interacting with
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:48.800]  it they don't believe in conscience they don't believe in divine inspiration or
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:52.880]  even satanic inspiration and also they don't believe in the innateness of the
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:57.480]  soul and what I mean by that is that we each come to earth with innate
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:03.040]  proclivities built in hardwired not genetically not biologically it's a
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:09.320]  spiritual thing it comes from the spirit that comes from before we live my
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:14.080]  mother had 10 children every one of us children had a different spirit same
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:20.240]  parents same environment same biology same DNA completely different children
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:26.240]  that's innateness and when you don't address people's innate set points and
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:30.560]  some people are resistant naturally to the spirit of the Lord to the voice of
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:35.360]  conscience some people are innately attracted to evil and that can only be
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:40.320]  explained by you know spiritual proclivities that they picked up in
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:45.360]  the in their own you know creative process I happen to think that God after
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:49.360]  creating spirits you know there's a lot of free market things up there you're
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:54.280]  allowed to see what's going on in earth you get influenced by things and that's
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:59.480]  why Patton thought he was at Thermopolis he was at the Greek battles he believed
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:04.200]  in or he thought maybe reincarnation explained that but in fact I think the
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:09.120]  spiritual innateness that we come to earth with you know just like you you
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:13.840]  have a passion Alex for liberty and that's just not learned in school that's
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:19.120]  not where I picked it up it's it's not born I mean it's not learned in school
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:25.040]  it's we're inbred with some of those and not equally so I think to understand
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:29.520]  ourselves our society we have to get down to the basics and too often the
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:33.280]  solutions we have whether they're political solutions or religious solutions
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:39.760]  are mechanistic they're checklists and that just doesn't hack it you've got to
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:43.720]  tie into the source of truth and as I was telling it's a very still small voice
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:47.160]  you have to have a great deal of self-control to listen to that voice
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:52.200]  not only to concentrate but you know if you fill your life with raucous music
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:59.160]  loud hyperactivity and you can't I had to teach my kids for example to kind of
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:04.320]  just slow down in life take it easy so that you could hear the voice of the
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:08.480]  Lord when it was prompting you and you had enough time to react to it well
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:11.160]  that's what I was gonna say I noticed that when I get calm and go out in the
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:16.920]  countryside then I feel really moral and good and have clarity but working and
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:22.160]  living in the city and running around it's when I get sped up and crazed that
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:27.320]  I even catch myself having really evil thoughts and acting vicious and really
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:31.760]  turning into like a Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde I mean I've experienced it myself and
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:37.080]  that's why the whole system is about speeding us up confusing us getting us
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:42.320]  angry not never letting us slow down and that's what rock music is all about I
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:49.040]  don't care if it's got great melodies or a great beat the point is it's too hyper
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:55.720]  it's too all-consuming and it literally drives away any ability to perceive the
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:16:01.520]  spirit of God in your life and I'm not talking about religious things 99% of
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:06.440]  all that I get from God daily is about my temporal I've bought this is right
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:11.080]  this is wrong or when I'm going through you know I get hundreds of emails a day
[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:15.040]  from various sources around the world and I have to sift through that I can
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:20.080]  sense when I'm reading a story that's not quite right yeah that's right or this
[02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:24.840]  needs more research check that out you know you just get help you feel that I'm
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:29.720]  sure as you go through the news it's that's the Lord helping us determine
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:33.840]  truth and evil and when you cut out that voice when you tell that voice I don't
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:36.400]  want to hear that voice about weight control I don't want to hear it about
[02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:41.440]  exercise I don't want to hear that about discipline to my children we basically
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:45.800]  telling the Lord to get lost and there's a penalty to be paid for that I think he
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:50.480]  penalizes us in terms of the amount of truth that we get when we continue to
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:59.480]  tell him to get lost wow it's it's so incredibly huge I guess the 60s terms
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:06.160]  would be heavy but I was downtown this week looking at the big buildings looking
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:10.800]  at the people looking at helicopters flying around and then a drone flew by
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:14.240]  the drones are just all over the place now in Austin you little toy drone
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:19.720]  smaller drone and it was the fantasticness of consciousness and being
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:25.760]  alive on this planet and then you see full grown men only caring about Sports
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:31.480]  Center or only caring about you know partying and I'm not on some high horse
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:36.520]  myself either it's just that you really see how the whole world the
[02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:41.920]  manufactured world is meant to blind us from the real world going around in
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:46.440]  front of us that's so fantastical that if we ever just slowed down for a minute
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:52.200]  it's awe-inspiring that we're alive and conscious in the middle of all this of
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:56.480]  course we're spiritual of course there's something much bigger and the whole
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:01.760]  system is telling us no there is nothing bigger because it doesn't want us to
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:05.000]  question and say there could be a conspiracy or question and say there
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.080]  could be more we're being told no only what the world gives you that's all
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:14.280]  that's real you know I get a chance fortunately to get away from the
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:19.160]  computer two or three times a day when I go out in the country to and fly around
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:23.840]  the country to analyze people's property and help them in strategic
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:27.920]  relocation and it's amazing how refreshing that is I'm supposed to be
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:32.240]  working and I do work hard sometimes 14 hours a day with people and they're
[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:36.760]  constantly bombarding me with questions and you know give me the answers to these
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:42.640]  but you know I still when I'm out in the country I come back refreshed and I
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:47.360]  know you feel that that way too Alex but it's incredible how we have to break
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:52.440]  this urbanization mold that the society is trying to push upon us and realize
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:57.160]  that you need to get out at the end of the day into a more tranquil environment
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:01.920]  well the Bible says the city's the place where you find the evil and there is no
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:05.760]  doubt that it's just unnatural and then you've got an unnatural system working
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:10.080]  through that unnatural template to try to break our basic human programming the
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:15.120]  attack on men on the family on women on children it's so predatory and I don't
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:18.720]  see how other folks can't see that it's predatory not that I've got all the

[02:23:59.560 --> 02:24:19.280]  12 Scouts is our guest I'm your host Alex Jones there's a lot of breaking news
[02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:23.440]  on infowars.com black conservative leaders says Obama could declare
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:28.200]  martial law cancelled 2016 elections they don't need to the bureaucracy's
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:31.640]  already cancelled the Bill of Rights and Constitution Ebola camps Fox
[02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:36.360]  analysts calls for quarantine camps in every city and now Bloomberg has a bunch
[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:39.840]  of medical officials basically calling for the same thing Dallas nurse with
[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:45.640]  video ask is Ebola airborne now most of us hospitals cannot safely handle Ebola
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:51.080]  patients sick passengers on Boston flight prompt Ebola scare has Matt Cruz on
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:57.680]  scene 70 hospital staffers cared for Ebola patient Ebola outbreak UN worker dies
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:03.000]  in German hospital Ferguson protesters hold surprise rally at upscale plaza
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:08.280]  shopping mall harass shoppers and said they want them to be uncomfortable this
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:12.080]  is becoming very racial ladies and gentlemen and again I'm against the
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:16.640]  Cook less Klan being racist and I've protested them I'm also against other
[02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:20.280]  groups being racist towards white people and that's kind of the idea that like
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:24.920]  the only form of inequity or evil in the world is from a white person when
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:28.440]  that's just ridiculous people act pretty much the same everywhere there's
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:32.040]  different cultural variances but it's just to say that someone's inherently
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:35.240]  evil because they're black or inherently because they're white it's just
[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:39.520]  asinine and it's really getting bad a lot of really unsavory elements have
[02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:44.800]  gotten involved in the whole Ferguson situation now and the police have acted
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:50.760]  out of control as well but now they're getting shot so this is becoming an
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:55.480]  really a destabilizing effect and Joel we're gonna go to phone calls from John
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:26:01.960]  in Oklahoma listening on KZ LS and Joe and JD and Mark and Rick but I want to
[02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:04.840]  start going to them at the start of the next segment because this is a short
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:08.680]  segment so we don't get cut off by a break you write a lot about this in
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:13.840]  strategic relocation the book you talk about it a lot in the film the way the
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:18.480]  establishment has created Balkanization and exacerbated cultural and racial
[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:22.880]  differences and it really seems like this is getting worse than ever what's
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:27.960]  your current take on that you know there's a lot of talk about and hype
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:32.000]  about ice is coming over the border and creating terrorist attacks and I
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:35.840]  predicted that there will be no such attacks any more than there's been any
[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:42.600]  other attacks for the last well forever even since 9-11 and that's because this
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:45.840]  is controlled terror we're dealing with you know we got a wide open border with
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:50.640]  Mexico what's to stop real terrorists from buying a ticket to Mexico and coming
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:56.040]  across the border and blowing themselves up in a in a shopping mall the fact is
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:27:00.400]  that the American people would react very decisively and require that border
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:04.280]  be shut down tighter than a drum and that's why they don't let the terrorists
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:08.560]  come across and it proves that they are controlled and that's why I'm saying the
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:12.760]  real purpose of that open border is this multicultural agenda the increased
[02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:17.640]  crime the increased stress and to overwhelm conservative voting patterns in
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:22.760]  this country with the democratic socialist leaning voting patterns of
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:27.000]  uneducated Mexicans that come across and by the way blue state brags and openly
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:31.240]  admits that I mean they say we will get your guns within 10 years and the
[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:35.840]  Democrats organize around race while telling everybody else they can't I
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:40.280]  would organize around liberty and freedom but as you said these are third
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:45.920]  world countries have never been free this country's in trouble well and the
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:48.920]  judges are upholding this shows that there's a conspiracy that goes clear
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:52.800]  into the judicial department because literally every judge where you take
[02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:58.800]  these cases to court to protest democratic registration or to enforce
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:02.920]  voter ID even the judges are knocking down voter ID as if that's something
[02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:07.080]  unconscionable against the 14th amendment against people's rights what to
[02:28:07.080 --> 02:28:10.720]  require identification that you're an eligible voter what could be more
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:15.240]  patriotic what could be more American than that but literally we have 100% of
[02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:19.400]  judges voting down those voter ID laws which shows that they're under the
[02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:24.920]  democratic agenda well it's actually a globalist agenda the they do the same
[02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:30.600]  thing under Republicans but the Democrats with a cutting edge though yes
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:34.680]  they are now it's it's telling though that they get some things done more than
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:39.320]  than others you know this rumor about Obama gonna stay in office and they're
[02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:42.840]  not going to be election in the future because he's going to take control and
[02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:46.920]  been going around for years but it's bogus Obama's a puppet he's controlled by
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:51.680]  the globalist and they know that there's a ground swell of reaction against
[02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:55.680]  Obama they're not so stupid as to keep Obama in power they're going to give us
[02:28:55.680 --> 02:29:00.200]  a controlled Republican next time around I'm predicting that not only will
[02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:05.160]  Hillary Clinton run but she will be defeated I think the powers that be
[02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:09.000]  really like to have a compliant puppet as president not someone like Hillary
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:13.520]  who really will try to run the presidency but I think they really want to
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:17.360]  give relief to the country a false relief in the form of a controlled
[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:21.280]  Republican of course they're trying to shove Chris Christie at us there's
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:26.360]  another it's the shades of what happened when they want to finish your your U.S.
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:31.040]  a political view when we come back we'll go right to calls but you can see them
[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:33.840]  also organized with the Republican leadership a Democratic leadership
[02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:38.520]  destroy the real libertarian constitutional Tea Party movement and you
[02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:43.040]  see Rand Paul being demonized as well we'll get Joe Scowze's take on election

[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:47.080]  hurting innocent people I just don't like bullies and the New World Order
[02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:52.360]  Luciferian trash are just cosmic con artists that's what my grandfather would
[02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:57.040]  always call he go you know Satan's a con artist a cosmic con artist who's conned
[02:34:57.040 --> 02:35:01.560]  all his people and he's gonna save them so that's the thing people that they
[02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:05.760]  don't think the devil's gonna lose folks and meanwhile they want to convince you
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:09.400]  it doesn't even exist so you're not even in the ballgame they win by default I
[02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:13.200]  don't want to go off and start preaching we're gonna go back to Joel to finish
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:16.480]  up his 2016 points and we're gonna go right to your phone calls again John
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:21.560]  Oklahoma listing on KZ LS will be first here in just a moment but first off we
[02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:26.200]  have the proprietary super nascent iodine that doesn't have the alcohol or
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:30.120]  other fillers that taste so horrible turns bright blue on paper not black or
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:35.400]  red because it's real iodine from the 99.999 crystals from multi-million
[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:40.360]  year-old ancient crystal deposits you know seven to twelve thousand feet
[02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:45.160]  under the ground it literally when we manufacture it on a hot plate it's
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:48.880]  manufactured in a big facility but if you put a crystal in a petri dish or a
[02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:54.040]  beaker and heat it up past 90 degrees it turns into purple gas this just goes
[02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:59.240]  through your body and basically your whole body operates on it the globalists
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:02.120]  are obsessed with it they don't want you to know about it it's changed my life
[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:08.920]  health wise was done for my thyroid my blood my energy detoxing immune system
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:14.040]  and we've never done this because it's our best seller but Anthony had the idea
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:18.200]  he said listen let's make it even more affordable it's double the strength half
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:21.120]  the cost of leading competitors that aren't even the real nascent iodine

[02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:41.080]  to start thinking about the stuff start out with the book the video mold around
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:43.920]  your brain and just think about it that's what I've been doing and I made a
[02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:49.440]  lot of preparations some solar a well a wall the firearms not because I'm living
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:53.960]  in fear but because I'm trying to live prepared like all my ancestors did
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:58.120]  everybody canned food everybody knew how to be self-sufficient or you were a
[02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:03.080]  loser now almost no one knows how well you can at least have water filtration
[02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:07.560]  and food and know how to defend it because the plan is to incrementally
[02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:12.520]  collapse the society the plan is to force you into the cities for a reason
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:15.800]  now going back to Joel and I want to get to calls again thank you for spending
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:19.880]  so much time with us Joel the website's world affairs brief.com he's the editor
[02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:24.840]  in chief there finishing up on what you see in 2016 then I want to go to calls
[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:29.720]  well they always start out trying to give us a phony Republican like they
[02:38:29.720 --> 02:38:34.920]  started out with Rudolph Giuliani a cross-dresser globalist involved in 9-11
[02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:40.280]  the conservatives would have none of them and so they resurrected McCain in 2008
[02:38:40.280 --> 02:38:44.680]  just out of nowhere in order to stop Mitt Romney from getting into the
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:51.480]  position six Democratic newspapers endorsing John McCain and then of course
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:57.680]  in 2008 they couldn't stop Mitt Romney so they had to pull about 8 million to
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:01.520]  10 million votes in order to defeat him I mean here's a guy who was bending over
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:06.400]  backwards to please the establishment ignorant about conspiracy and yet they
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:10.000]  still didn't want him in the White House because he they didn't have dirt on him
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:13.240]  they didn't they couldn't control him that's the same thing that's going to
[02:39:13.240 --> 02:39:17.360]  happen to Rand Paul coming up they can't allow him to be into the White House no
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:21.240]  matter how much he bends over backwards to say Republicans need to reach out to
[02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:24.600]  Hispanics and to blacks and to every other minorities really trying to
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:29.160]  compromise to get ahead so that he can avoid what happened to his father it
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:34.360]  won't do any good that got his phones tapped they know he's real well that's
[02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:39.000]  right but what I'm saying is is that he's not gonna get in he's gonna be the
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:43.520]  man to beat I predict but the fact that Mitt Romney is surging back into
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:49.680]  Poverty shows that nobody's enthused about Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio yet we're
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:56.480]  gonna see a litany or a progression of them throwing us prospective candidates
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:00.040]  with push-pulling you know it's just like in the last election they had five
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:04.400]  people coming up one after another whether it was Santorum or Newt Gingrich
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:08.480]  or the rest that they said oh suddenly surging 40 percenters in the poll it was
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:12.920]  falsified when they would collapse in the next primary they'd surge another
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:16.840]  person like Herman Cain he would collapse they'd surge Santorum again
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:21.720]  we're gonna see that same thing again they'll keep trying candidates until
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:26.560]  they find somebody that will stick with the community to beat Hillary Clinton
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:33.520]  what would they do if Iran Paul really got in well boy I'll tell you that would
[02:40:33.520 --> 02:40:37.200]  be tough I don't think that's even a possibility just because they control
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:40.640]  votes at the national level now state votes are counted at the national level
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:44.840]  and they can simply eliminate as many millions of votes as they want
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:48.600]  electronically that's right DNS has been merged into another shadowy group all
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:52.920]  secretive they do compile them all at the federal level and nobody can trace it
[02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:57.680]  but I think if you had somebody like Rand Paul who's very strong-minded who
[02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:01.520]  is trying to compromise but he would be a pretty strong libertarian president
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:06.080]  once he's in they'd have to assassinate him probably to control him because
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:12.320]  otherwise it's it's quite difficult yeah I've known Rand Paul since 1996 he is
[02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:18.360]  for real he is compromising on a lot of fronts but he's pro-second amendment
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:23.600]  pro-sovereignty he's done a lot of good things what do you think of these Texas
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:30.520]  senator Ted Cruz well Ted Cruz has said a lot of things you know his wife is
[02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:37.240]  tied to you know some of the big banks Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs I I don't
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:42.040]  think he has enough gravitas he's certainly not savvy enough about the
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:49.240]  conspiracy to really do us some damage or do some damage to them but he is a
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:54.520]  force to be contended with Mike Lee's also a heavy a lightweight I'm sorry a
[02:41:54.520 --> 02:41:58.200]  lightweight his father Rex Lee the solicitor general was a pretty good
[02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:03.280]  compromiser pretty bad compromiser in terms of not doing not sustaining the
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:06.120]  Constitution when he was solicitor general sure but he was good at
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:10.640]  compromising which is bad I get your point yeah I think we focus so much on
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:14.120]  presidential runs though what about taking back counties and cities that's
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:18.440]  where I've seen where we can have a real effect look at Gen 21 just by people
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:22.480]  realizing there's a conspiracy it's turned a lot of it back yeah I'm in
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:25.720]  complete agreement I'm I really don't think they're gonna let us control the
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:30.640]  national election ever again nor congressional elections except by a flu
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:35.440]  care there but it's at the local level both local legislators and county
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:41.040]  commissioners where we can sustain constitutional sheriffs that's another
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:44.720]  area that we really need to make sure we get principled sheriffs into office
[02:42:44.720 --> 02:42:48.560]  there they're the last line of defense towards protecting our rights and you
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:52.040]  and I are gonna need those someday when the SWAT team show up of our doors we
[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:55.720]  need friends to be able to call a sheriff to say back off feds you don't
[02:42:55.720 --> 02:42:59.280]  have jurisdiction here well we're seeing that more and more even in big cities in
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:04.400]  Texas where the county sheriffs and judges are saying we're not gonna go
[02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:07.360]  along with the gun confiscation and have ordered the sheriff's department to
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:11.720]  resist it that's not radical that's default position that would stop all
[02:43:11.720 --> 02:43:18.520]  this I want to go to calls one final point in my gut or my spirit I feel like
[02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:23.120]  if we educated enough people about the true nature of the conspiracy which is
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:28.720]  so public now where you know the Warren Buffett and Ted Turner and Bill Gates
[02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:33.360]  all get caught meets meeting secretly to discuss life extension technology and
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:38.520]  world population reduction ABC news London Guardian five years ago a few
[02:43:38.520 --> 02:43:42.080]  months ago Peter Thiel the billionaire Builder burger says I want to live
[02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:45.040]  forever there it is Peter Thiel the billionaire tech entrepreneur on a
[02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:49.480]  mission to cheat death when you get to the bottom of the rabbit hole they all
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:53.160]  believe they're gonna transcend humanity that it's about to happen they're gonna
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:59.440]  accept a robot computer takeover I mean I say this fiction based but it's like
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:04.960]  aliens from the fourth dimension are speaking to these people convincing
[02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:09.600]  them to build a technological kill grid that will reduce the world population
[02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:13.000]  and they're telling them they're going to get eternal life out of it that
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:19.720]  sounds like a science fiction plot from a horror movie or something and now
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:22.840]  they're very public about it 15 years ago when I was reading their internal
[02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:26.840]  writings or more scholarly documents that's all they talked about but now
[02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:32.000]  Joel they're so public about it's the end of humanity it's an evolution
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:35.480]  we're going to transcend we're gonna get rid of almost everybody and only a
[02:44:35.480 --> 02:44:39.320]  tiny group will live forever and you've now got kind of the scientific elite for
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:43.080]  the first time embracing through revelation of the method the
[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:47.840]  externalization of the hierarchy and actually saying we want to join you and
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:52.200]  live forever so I'm seeing a decompartmentalization from the top level
[02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:58.000]  into the mid-level and into pop culture even if it's at a subconscious level why
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:02.120]  do you think they're being so public now about their master plan well I think
[02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:05.320]  they're they're confident now I mean the mere fact that they've kept up on the
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:10.240]  CFR website the speech by James Jones admitting to conspiracy admitting that
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:14.360]  he gets daily marching orders as the National Security Advisor from Henry
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:17.880]  Kissinger and Associates they keep it right up on the website is still there
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:22.840]  he said I get my daily marching orders from the CFR and Henry Kissinger that's
[02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:26.960]  right passed down through Brent Scorcroft and Sandy Berger his associates I mean
[02:45:26.960 --> 02:45:31.320]  right there in public and they haven't removed it and of course no media ever
[02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:34.120]  made an issue of that no media talked about it but the conspiracy is very
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:40.120]  confident that they can beat us now and so what we've really got to do is can you
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:44.160]  know you are absolutely right the only way to save this nation is not through
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:48.400]  restoring the Constitution I'll tell you why I'm a constitutionalist so was my
[02:45:48.400 --> 02:45:52.380]  uncle Cleone Scousen but look the lawyers themselves say hey I don't care if you
[02:45:52.380 --> 02:45:56.920]  restore the Constitution we know how to interpret that you can't restore or the
[02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:00.360]  does already there they just simply disregard they won't defend it they've
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:06.480]  had a revolution against us that's right and so only preaching and giving
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:10.200]  credible evidence about conspiracy and thank God we've got so much evidence in
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:14.240]  9-11 to actually button down the case that's why that's the big no no never
[02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:18.680]  say that they could be bad never say investigate them never explain their
[02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:22.840]  master plan they want to bring out their master plan in their words and sell it
[02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:27.840]  they don't want us beating them to the past that's right and so we are reaching
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:30.920]  a lot of people you're reaching a tremendous amount of people Alex and
[02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:35.640]  I'll tell you I I have people almost every day call up and say I saw you on a
[02:46:35.640 --> 02:46:40.360]  video with Alex Jones I mean that video has had so much play around the world
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:45.120]  it's incredible Alex and we'll have to do another one sometime we need to do it
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:48.800]  we need to do it I really enjoyed being in studio with your great staff well
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:52.360]  you're awesome we love having you here and going out to dinner as well another
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:55.760]  question because we got to go to calls I've been hogging the time is why do they
[02:46:55.760 --> 02:46:59.760]  let us live and operate I mean you're playing crash use and you survived a
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:03.160]  miracle even mainstream news said I don't you probably don't think that was a
[02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:06.560]  setup might have been I've had him openly threatened me and openly attacked
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:11.400]  me physically before but I mean I think God is in control I think that's the
[02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:15.280]  reason we're still alive Joel yeah you know we're losing most of the battles
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:18.960]  the powers I mean we're gaining some but the powers the be are corrupting more
[02:47:18.960 --> 02:47:24.920]  but I think even though God can't overwhelm a nation that perhaps deserves
[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:28.480]  some tribulation to come at least he can protect those of us who are trying to
[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:33.720]  fight for liberty and I feel the protection of the Lord yeah that's it and
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:37.480]  I don't feel like I deserve it it's very humbling let's talk to John in
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:42.960]  Oklahoma listening on 1640 in Oklahoma City go ahead John yeah thank you very
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:48.000]  much Alex Joe you had a really responsive note with me when you said
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:53.120]  that people should now be looking for some kind of refuge outside the city
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:59.560]  because for about the two next two years I've been talking to people in this
[02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:05.320]  city of Enid Oklahoma who are good churchgoers very nice likeable people
[02:48:05.320 --> 02:48:10.760]  that they should put the pool together their resources with two or three other
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:16.080]  families and go out into the way out outside the city and start looking for
[02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:21.760]  abandoned farms to reactivate and because it's going to take about a year
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:28.120]  to reconstruct and add solar panels and and windmills and stock them up with
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:34.160]  freeze-dried food for a couple of years and and mega vitamin therapy you know
[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:39.040]  supplements I should say and all kinds of things necessary for them to survive
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:44.520]  at least a couple three years without reentering society so to speak or what's
[02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:47.080]  left of it and let me throw that out because we're gonna skip this network
[02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:51.040]  break the elites themselves we didn't get into that but that's even in mainstream
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:54.640]  news but Joel told me about a decade ago they're all building armored redoubts
[02:48:54.640 --> 02:48:58.160]  are leaving the country are building fortresses in the Ozarks they're
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:02.240]  digging in as well while telling us we shouldn't be dug in do you have a
[02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:08.440]  specific question for Joel Scalzen yeah I understand are you in real estate Joe
[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:15.560]  no but I do have an associate Todd Savage that runs strategic relocation
[02:49:15.560 --> 02:49:20.520]  dot-com which is a survival realty site I highly recommend people go there to try
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:26.240]  to find real good preparedness what Joel does is he's an expert in not just in
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:31.480]  the US but all over the world on safer areas to live in the pluses and minuses
[02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:38.280]  of those areas but I don't actually find specific property people I consult with
[02:49:38.280 --> 02:49:42.600]  them I will give them opinions if they find property you want me to analyze it
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:47.000]  but I don't have time to actually go out alright thank you so much John please
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  spread the word there in Oklahoma City about the broadcast great to hear from
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:53.480]  you another great affiliate out there let's go ahead and talk to Joe in
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:59.280]  California you're on the air go ahead good afternoon Alex and Joel kind of
[02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:03.200]  envy those who do have an escape plan my finances I kind of prevent that but
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:07.920]  that's not really the point of my call here I actually just kind of wanted to
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:12.200]  gather your thoughts about last year's repealment of the Smith-Mundt Act that
[02:50:12.200 --> 02:50:16.760]  is the law that prevented the state department from disseminating internally
[02:50:16.760 --> 02:50:21.200]  authorized news stories to the general public and I think it's because of that
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:26.000]  why we're seeing a lot of hype in Ferguson and a lot of hype and you know
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:30.960]  regarding ISIS maybe a little bit regarding Ebola but I think that's
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:36.280]  kind of a factor to consider well I know that they repealed laws to engage in
[02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:42.560]  domestic propaganda but that was already going on but explain it to me like I'm
[02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:47.160]  five years old I don't quite get your point okay well what I'm noticing is
[02:50:47.160 --> 02:50:53.480]  that um sorry how was the State Department not issuing its internal
[02:50:53.480 --> 02:50:58.600]  propaganda cause something in Ferguson well what I'm meaning is that it's
[02:50:58.600 --> 02:51:03.040]  because of that is that now you I'm been seeing certain you know just the way the
[02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:07.600]  news is being disseminated about it it's really kind of you know really one
[02:51:07.600 --> 02:51:12.800]  cited and oh yeah I mean they've got the CIA and the Pentagon on record and they
[02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:16.160]  had to hide it in plain view where the military would rebel so the best way they
[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:19.960]  hide this evil is just to do it out in the open like it's no big deal that they
[02:51:19.960 --> 02:51:23.600]  are engaging in psyops and deception and that they're quote gonna target
[02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:28.840]  alternative media with infighting cognitive infiltration setting people up
[02:51:28.840 --> 02:51:35.880]  disinfo stories you know FBI informants making stuff up about you I mean they
[02:51:35.880 --> 02:51:40.360]  are out in force now they're definitely putting their people on the street to come
[02:51:40.360 --> 02:51:46.120]  after folks go scows in your comment on that well I don't see any actual effect
[02:51:46.120 --> 02:51:50.480]  of that legislation because the State Department has been corrupt for many
[02:51:50.480 --> 02:51:55.000]  many years prior to that and never would tell us the truth anyway the media has
[02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:59.360]  also been controlled for decades I really see that there's been a seamless
[02:51:59.360 --> 02:52:03.480]  disinformation pattern that's only continuing not that there's been any
[02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:07.920]  particular cause and effect from that particular legislation legislative
[02:52:07.920 --> 02:52:12.320]  change yep interesting though callers thank you for calling Mark in Oregon
[02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:17.560]  you're on the air with Joel Scowson yes good afternoon Alex and Joel thanks for
[02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:23.120]  all your great work goes without saying but thank you anyway Alex you've
[02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:28.120]  mentioned in recent weeks about a laboratory where there were pigs and
[02:52:28.120 --> 02:52:32.720]  sheep that were kept in two different locations and the laboratory I believe
[02:52:32.720 --> 02:52:39.760]  or they were sharing the same space but one of these creatures are types of
[02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:46.560]  creature what either the pigs or the sheep spread the Ebola to the other group
[02:52:46.560 --> 02:52:50.720]  yeah that was in Africa I forget which country it's mainstream news years ago
[02:52:50.720 --> 02:52:57.120]  and it was it was in 2012 there was a CDC report on it it spread from monkeys to
[02:52:57.120 --> 02:53:02.320]  pigs and they had another study where it spread from pigs or something else
[02:53:02.320 --> 02:53:05.920]  but they believe that was just in in you know the pigs sneezing or the monkey
[02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:13.040]  sneezing and then it drifts over it's not truly truly airborne if you go to
[02:53:13.040 --> 02:53:19.480]  1990 go into their archives of public broadcasting systems PBS we've played the
[02:53:19.480 --> 02:53:23.680]  clip where it went airborne monkey to monkey in a facility but it was not a
[02:53:23.680 --> 02:53:28.680]  type of Ebola humans can get but yes I'm aware of that Nova special we've
[02:53:28.680 --> 02:53:33.920]  back you that club up guys is that the point you're getting to actually from
[02:53:33.920 --> 02:53:38.880]  there all the way up to the president Alex and Joe the lady the nurse that
[02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:45.920]  treated mr. Duncan contracted Ebola with full precaution so by process of
[02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:51.120]  elimination I don't think it's being very likely I think it being definite
[02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:54.960]  that she caught it through her breathing because that was the only inlet in that
[02:53:54.960 --> 02:54:02.200]  room from the man's condition you could get on the face mask and then she goes
[02:54:02.200 --> 02:54:07.560]  in another room and takes it off with her hands or touches it now let's go to
[02:54:07.560 --> 02:54:12.360]  Joel Scouse and get his take on this Joel yeah there the reason that that has
[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:17.560]  to be true the break in the protocol is that it clearly isn't just physical
[02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:23.000]  contact but certainly if you have his micro drops on your mask and you put
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:27.920]  your hand up to take the mask off and or even touch your gloves as you're taking
[02:54:27.920 --> 02:54:32.560]  your gloves off and then touch your mouth etc you can contract the virus but
[02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:36.440]  we know at least so far from the other people that have been incubated that it
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:41.400]  isn't being transferred very easily simply by being in the same room I think
[02:54:41.400 --> 02:54:45.320]  it has to be micro droplets either through laughing or spitting but it's
[02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:49.200]  more transferable in the CDC's been saying that someone needs to vomit right
[02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:53.280]  on an open wound to get it that's that's just over the top absolutely true
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:57.520]  thank you caller good to hear from you Rick in Texas here on the air with Alex
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:02.040]  Jones and Joel Scouse and thanks for calling how are you doing Alex good
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:07.760]  brother listen Joe I don't Alex you probably won't remember but Joe you
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:16.600]  might back in 67 68 the Rolling Stones came out with a album called Satanic
[02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:22.320]  Majesty's Request and there was a song that they did called Symphony of the
[02:55:22.320 --> 02:55:27.680]  Devil now back in those days and that psychedelic rock thing that was going
[02:55:27.680 --> 02:55:32.640]  on and I remember because I was right in the middle of it you gave your soul up
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:39.840]  and what you did on acid you listen to these albums and I mean the Beatles
[02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:47.520]  there was socket crystal blue persuasion all these groups back then you would get
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:53.600]  a reward and when you gave your soul up I never did I couldn't do it by the way
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:57.360]  John Lennon began to criticize it and say it was a satanic conspiracy I've
[02:55:57.360 --> 02:56:00.080]  heard the recordings ought to play him here I mean they're out there and that's
[02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:03.080]  when they went and killed him from my view is when he started you know turning
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:07.520]  against him but definitely out there that's going on I mean most the rock and
[02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:10.520]  roll music I don't think that's what's going on but definitely some of those
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:13.520]  groups are on record saying that's what they were doing let me get Joe Scousen's
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:18.680]  take on that no I completely agree with the color their Rolling Stones have had
[02:56:18.680 --> 02:56:23.160]  considerable documentation about the satanic you know cult connection but
[02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:26.720]  almost any of the great whether it's from the Bee Gees or the Beatles you know
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:34.680]  have had their boost from some unknown source that really ties in there and it's
[02:56:34.680 --> 02:56:38.720]  not very obvious you can't prove these things by ordinary biographies but the
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:43.080]  people who knew them and were close to them have been able to document that
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:48.320]  something happened once they made a pact and and went forward and rocketed
[02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:52.480]  success and part of it of course comes from the satanic inspiration and in
[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:58.120]  driving both words and music satanic inspiration ladies and gentlemen that's
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:02.200]  what we're talking about Rick thank you JD in New Mexico you're on the air go
[02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:07.960]  ahead thanks for the time Alex I actually have a question aimed to Joel
[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:13.080]  but I would love to get an answer from you as well Alex I'm a believer of the
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:19.480]  post-tribulation rapture I was wondering how he he feels it if we're in the
[02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:25.960]  tribulation as of right now I actually do not I think the tribulation becomes
[02:57:25.960 --> 02:57:31.200]  much more horrific later on probably after this nuclear preemptive strike on
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:35.360]  American military we get us into a global new world order and the globalists
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:39.000]  give an order that we need to lock up those people who believe that we were
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:43.760]  responsible for this war responsible for 9-11 lock up conspiracy believers I
[02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:48.800]  think constitutional conservatives and conspiracy believers will be the Jews of
[02:57:48.800 --> 02:57:53.320]  World War three and that's where the real serious tribulation against real
[02:57:53.320 --> 02:57:58.040]  fundamentalist Christians who believe in truth take place powerfully said because
[02:57:58.040 --> 02:58:01.960]  all the real preparation not just here but worldwide is not for radical Islam
[02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:06.920]  they're funding that it is to go after people that will not you know endorse
[02:58:06.920 --> 02:58:12.440]  abortion and endorse death and shine on to Satan and I think the Savior has to
[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:17.280]  come really to save the world that is almost totally under the grip of Satan
[02:58:17.280 --> 02:58:21.120]  except in pockets of resistance which are probably crying day and night for
[02:58:21.120 --> 02:58:26.000]  deliverance yeah does that answer your question caller do you believe that's
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:31.440]  the rapture is going to be post tribulation yes I do yeah five-year-old
[02:58:31.440 --> 02:58:35.640]  could read the Bible I mean I'm sorry and see it says that I mean it the beast
[02:58:35.640 --> 02:58:40.120]  wages war on the saints and overcomes them I mean it's right there that there's
[02:58:40.120 --> 02:58:43.600]  a war and you get persecuted all these churches are state run that tell you
[02:58:43.600 --> 02:58:47.360]  gonna be teleported out of here folks you already done two hours let's put
[02:58:47.360 --> 02:58:53.040]  bookends on it five more stay with us from the water table to our soils to the
[02:58:53.040 --> 02:58:57.720]  atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[02:58:57.720 --> 02:59:01.760]  but it's not just the air outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have
[02:59:01.760 --> 02:59:05.520]  two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and

[03:00:13.840 --> 03:00:21.360]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[03:00:21.360 --> 03:00:25.760]  Alex Jones for those that don't know there's been congressional hearings
[03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:29.720]  about it the 70s and 80s I grew up in Dallas around a bunch of the famous
[03:00:29.720 --> 03:00:35.400]  televangelist hung out with their kids they were just all incredibly wild
[03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:40.360]  almost all of them still joke about a preacher's daughter the wildest one in
[03:00:40.360 --> 03:00:44.160]  the town I mean some famous ones household names you know those people are
[03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:49.200]  and it was all just completely fake and my parents were Christians and they
[03:00:49.200 --> 03:00:53.080]  weren't you know Pharisee type saying how great they were but they loved God and
[03:00:53.080 --> 03:00:56.520]  and you know we get a tear in their eye when praying they were just to abhorred
[03:00:56.520 --> 03:01:01.480]  these people that lived in and around us in the in the community we lived in and
[03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:06.400]  when you look at the churches today in the last 200 years teaching this post
[03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:10.760]  tribute this this pre-tribulation rapture it's not in the Bible anybody
[03:01:10.760 --> 03:01:16.400]  could read Daniel or Ezekiel or Revelation and see that the devil sets up a
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:21.000]  world government says pledge to it and goes around killing people and then when
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:24.920]  Christ defeats the Antichrist then the dead in Christ rise then the that's
[03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:29.320]  what then there's a thousand-year reign with the with God's people the people
[03:01:29.320 --> 03:01:34.200]  that went through it who were so alive the dead are risen their spirits to them
[03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:37.680]  be with God a five-year-old could read that and it shows the grand illusion
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:41.280]  because you can't have this happen unless the churches have been taken over
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:46.680]  and believe that that they're not gonna have to go through anything look at what
[03:01:46.680 --> 03:01:49.640]  happened to Christ and all the disciples in the Old Testament how they were
[03:01:49.640 --> 03:01:53.520]  persecuted Joel I'm ranting I wanted you to put bookends on this because even if
[03:01:53.520 --> 03:01:56.680]  you were an anthropologist or sociologist or psychologist let's say we
[03:01:56.680 --> 03:02:00.720]  don't believe in God hypothetically the elite do world governments forming just
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:05.440]  as the Bible said it would ten kingdoms three regions all of it and but the
[03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:09.360]  Christians all think oh thank God it's getting bad we're gonna be teleported up
[03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:13.800]  like to the star deck of the enterprise any minute what are they gonna think when
[03:02:13.800 --> 03:02:16.920]  when the chips start rolling out in the world government I mean what are they
[03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:22.200]  gonna do when they keep thinking they're gonna get raptured Joel Scousen well
[03:02:22.200 --> 03:02:27.240]  you know I think Satan realizes that he can't actually destroy people's innate
[03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:31.520]  inborn feeling that there is a God and their attraction to Christianity so he
[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:36.360]  has to corrupt it in the process and he does so by what I call soft doctrine in
[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:40.680]  other words you preach to people that Christ love is totally unconditional
[03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:45.280]  what I do he loves us and loves Satan as much as anyone else and you know
[03:02:45.280 --> 03:02:48.920]  personally I think that God can only love that which is good and true he can
[03:02:48.920 --> 03:02:54.360]  have an outstretched arm calling to those in charity to repent and giving them
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:59.080]  opportunities and sending them messages in conscience to try to bring them but
[03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:04.440]  you know he does love the pure in heart as the Savior said and and that's where
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:10.120]  his true love is but you know they also teach the doctrine that you know you've
[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:12.880]  had a born-again experience you don't have to do anything else you don't have
[03:03:12.880 --> 03:03:15.920]  to follow the promptings of the spirit you don't have to follow the commandments
[03:03:15.920 --> 03:03:21.920]  you're just saved and while there is grace that grace is that continual flow of
[03:03:21.920 --> 03:03:25.720]  revelation to us of inspiration to try to keep us on track and we are
[03:03:25.720 --> 03:03:31.600]  responsible to to listen to those promptings I've had this nightmare you
[03:03:31.600 --> 03:03:35.320]  know of getting on the other side someday and reaching the Savior and wanting
[03:03:35.320 --> 03:03:39.000]  to embrace him and having put out his arm and say now wait a minute before you
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:43.960]  say you love me you have to explain why you told me to get lost 150,000 times
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:49.240]  and you know we say is in the biblical scripture wherein did I ask did you
[03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:53.400]  appear to me and wherein did you ask me to do something and it was in your
[03:03:53.400 --> 03:03:58.000]  conscience it with those hundreds of thousands of little messages and that's
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:01.000]  my message you know and I think this has been a great show today Alex we've
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:05.160]  talked about something you know we don't normally hear on this subject on the
[03:04:05.160 --> 03:04:10.720]  radio but it's the core of what people need to do to survive in the last days
[03:04:10.720 --> 03:04:14.880]  yes strategic relocation is important securing your home is important having a
[03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:18.240]  safe room is important but if you don't have good judgment if you aren't
[03:04:18.240 --> 03:04:22.560]  listening to the promptings warning you when the knock is coming next week to
[03:04:22.560 --> 03:04:28.960]  your door to be able to get out safely then I think it will be for naught I
[03:04:28.960 --> 03:04:35.680]  just as the evil rises I can feel my relationship to God getting stronger and
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:41.120]  I'm just once you have that a sermon you're like ashamed because you realize
[03:04:41.120 --> 03:04:44.680]  how evil you are and I look at other people who just for totally worldly
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:48.000]  care less I just feel sorry for them Joel because they have no idea what's
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:51.960]  coming how real this all is Joel scowls and world affairs brief calm thank you
[03:04:51.960 --> 03:04:56.120]  so much for joining this very powerful interview thank you Alex I've enjoyed it
[03:04:56.120 --> 03:05:18.280]  all right folks not only is tonight's seven
