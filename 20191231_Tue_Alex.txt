[00:00.000 --> 00:05.160]  Look at that.
[00:05.160 --> 00:12.640]  Y'all gonna keep riding here, Yuri.
[00:12.640 --> 00:16.040]  Yuh-uh...
[00:16.040 --> 00:39.640]  Two weeks ago, I was standing in one of the bays of a warehouse at the InfoWars News Center
[00:39.640 --> 00:48.880]  in Austin, Texas, and I was watching the armored vehicle roll out into the sun and knowing
[00:48.880 --> 00:55.080]  that Owen Schreuer and more of our crew were about to get on airplanes and fly to the East
[00:55.080 --> 01:02.200]  Coast to meet it and to engage the globalist at Point Blank Range.
[01:02.200 --> 01:08.760]  And that trip was fabulously successful.
[01:08.760 --> 01:16.440]  Imagine if we had crews, five or six crews, everywhere Trump goes, everywhere the leftist
[01:16.440 --> 01:20.960]  Democrat candidates go, taking over the media events, they can't help it all because of
[01:20.960 --> 01:29.920]  one little innovation, like an armored vehicle with mounted bullhorns blasting out.
[01:29.920 --> 01:35.520]  Taking control of narratives, all because we simply took action.
[01:35.520 --> 01:40.760]  That's you taking action that did that, and it cannot be stressed enough what the listeners
[01:40.760 --> 01:42.760]  and viewers of this broadcast have done.
[01:42.760 --> 01:46.000]  You have changed the world for the better.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.400]  All right, I've told you in the last few months that I'm going to really shake the broadcast
[01:50.400 --> 01:57.000]  up into 2020, and we're going to be in the streets a lot more, obviously, in the next
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.240]  307 days.
[02:01.240 --> 02:07.320]  President Trump is surrounded by yes men and liars and traitors, and as Cicero warned 2,000
[02:07.320 --> 02:11.880]  plus years ago, an enemy that comes to the gate openly attacking is easily defeated.
[02:11.880 --> 02:21.720]  It's the traitor within that is the plague.
[02:21.720 --> 02:27.400]  And we understand just how evil and just how corrupt and just how committed to evil.
[02:27.400 --> 02:31.080]  The globalists, their minions are, but a lot of people are still naive to that.
[02:31.080 --> 02:32.080]  They're awake.
[02:32.080 --> 02:37.720]  They know they're being lied to, but they haven't really gotten their bearings yet.
[02:37.720 --> 02:43.520]  People are ready to be fully awoken, but we have to be there to do it, and that's why
[02:43.520 --> 02:50.440]  they've taken the incredibly bold, dangerous gamble and implemented the technocracy, the
[02:50.440 --> 02:57.440]  Chinese social score system early against the West.
[02:57.440 --> 03:01.640]  And it's blown up in their face across Europe, across the UK and here as well.
[03:01.640 --> 03:13.440]  So yes, ladies and gentlemen, we're having some devastating victories together.
[03:13.440 --> 03:17.080]  But the fight is joined.
[03:17.080 --> 03:22.360]  So I am going to go to your phone calls at 20 after, and I'm going to take phone calls
[03:22.360 --> 03:27.320]  throughout the broadcast, but I'm going to front load it with calls and then intersperse
[03:27.320 --> 03:33.040]  different pieces of news at the start of each segment, then take calls, then cover news,
[03:33.040 --> 03:34.520]  then take calls.
[03:34.520 --> 03:41.840]  And I'm going to have a more disciplined broadcast because 20 years ago I was more disciplined
[03:41.840 --> 03:42.840]  actually.
[03:42.840 --> 03:46.640]  15 years ago I was more disciplined, and I've gotten very undisciplined.
[03:46.640 --> 03:51.720]  It's good radio and it's important things get covered, and we break a lot of new ground
[03:51.720 --> 03:57.480]  and it's a game-changing transmission, the most hated broadcast in the world by evil.
[03:57.480 --> 04:04.000]  That's really a fact, but because of that responsibility, we must go to the next level.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.280]  Everyone can feel it.
[04:08.280 --> 04:15.640]  Everyone can see it, and it's just something that we've absolutely got to do and we are
[04:15.640 --> 04:16.640]  going to do it.
[04:16.640 --> 04:23.640]  We're going to rise to the occasion, but I do intend to open the phones up and we come
[04:23.640 --> 04:26.640]  back in the next segment and plunge into it.
[04:26.640 --> 04:32.920]  Okay, let's just wait the 60 seconds of this break, and then when I come back I'll get
[04:32.920 --> 04:45.200]  into the terrorist storming the U.S. Embassy in Iraq and seeing and calling them protesters,
[04:45.200 --> 04:49.320]  and the latest move against the Second Amendment, the latest CHICOM move against the Second
[04:49.320 --> 04:51.880]  Amendment, and so much more.
[04:51.880 --> 04:59.800]  We'll be right back on this final transmission of the year 2019, stay with us.
[04:59.800 --> 05:07.200]  I spend a lot of time reminding the Info Wars family of listeners and viewers that without
[05:07.200 --> 05:10.720]  you we won't be on the air, and I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[05:10.720 --> 05:14.880]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing
[05:14.880 --> 05:19.160]  the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres, but something I should
[05:19.160 --> 05:25.520]  spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[05:25.520 --> 05:28.800]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air
[05:28.800 --> 05:33.600]  filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find
[05:33.600 --> 05:34.600]  out there.
[05:34.600 --> 05:40.400]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[05:40.400 --> 05:44.280]  So it's not a burden to support Info Wars.
[05:44.280 --> 05:51.360]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes
[05:51.360 --> 05:54.920]  your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[05:54.920 --> 06:22.640]  So visit InfoWarsStore.com today.
[06:22.640 --> 06:24.480]  Hard to believe, but here we are.
[06:24.480 --> 06:31.640]  You've survived this far into the twilight of the twilight, the Gutturdama Rang, the
[06:31.640 --> 06:41.440]  battle of the gods, the last waning hours, minutes, and seconds down to the milliseconds
[06:41.440 --> 06:51.880]  of the year, 2019, and all over the news, we're being told that it is the dawn of a
[06:51.880 --> 06:56.320]  new decade.
[06:56.320 --> 07:04.720]  That's not true, and I know you know that, but the fact that it was a debate in 1999,
[07:04.720 --> 07:14.120]  the media couldn't wait to say that we ended the second thousand years since Christ's
[07:14.120 --> 07:23.760]  death and resurrection, as we mark it from Christ's birth, and they were so excited about
[07:23.760 --> 07:30.880]  saying that we were into a new millennia, not just a new century, that they told everyone
[07:30.880 --> 07:40.560]  that the year 2000, the start of that was the end of the 20th century and the second
[07:40.560 --> 07:45.560]  millennia after Christ, and the common calendar.
[07:45.560 --> 07:54.360]  Just absolutely not true, like saying men can have babies, they cannot.
[07:54.360 --> 07:58.080]  Now with all these genetically engineered artificial wombs that are really just human
[07:58.080 --> 08:03.120]  wombs outside of a woman, can they rig something up and grow some shriveled, poor human in
[08:03.120 --> 08:07.880]  there and roll it out and stick that in a man and say, oh, a man had a baby.
[08:07.880 --> 08:10.360]  Yeah, they can pretty much already do that.
[08:10.360 --> 08:19.320]  But that man didn't have a baby, a genetic Frankenstein was created, and a human soul
[08:19.320 --> 08:30.480]  was abused and tortured by mad scientist hell bent on playing God.
[08:30.480 --> 08:33.800]  Most people do makeup and hair before they go on air.
[08:33.800 --> 08:37.800]  I tend to forget about it and do it once I get on air.
[08:37.800 --> 08:38.800]  No makeup.
[08:38.800 --> 08:44.400]  I spent about five seconds calling my hair, which is evident side issue of your radio
[08:44.400 --> 08:48.400]  listening like what the hell's this guy talking about your TV or you get it, I'm like flyaway
[08:48.400 --> 08:49.400]  hair sticking up.
[08:49.400 --> 08:53.840]  Don't want that to become a distraction, do we five might just in the new year shave
[08:53.840 --> 08:54.840]  the head.
[08:54.840 --> 08:56.960]  My wife doesn't want me to she says, oh, no, your hair.
[08:56.960 --> 08:57.960]  I like it.
[08:57.960 --> 08:58.960]  Leave it.
[08:58.960 --> 08:59.960]  I don't know.
[08:59.960 --> 09:00.960]  I think in 2020.
[09:00.960 --> 09:05.440]  This this hair is going by by gotta give it up.
[09:05.440 --> 09:11.440]  Care less, can't wait to not mess with it.
[09:11.440 --> 09:12.440]  I'm digressing.
[09:12.440 --> 09:15.680]  Let me break down what's coming up today.
[09:15.680 --> 09:18.800]  And we'll watch these developments as they unfold.
[09:18.800 --> 09:23.280]  But I do want to shake things up, do things a little bit different.
[09:23.280 --> 09:30.920]  And so I want to go to your calls pretty much first on the embassy being overrun and attacked
[09:30.920 --> 09:36.760]  and what's behind that dangerous that is and the history of that and the different players
[09:36.760 --> 09:37.760]  that are involved.
[09:37.760 --> 09:39.400]  You're going to get a breakdown here.
[09:39.400 --> 09:41.920]  Believe me, you're not going to get pretty much anywhere else and it's going to be dead
[09:41.920 --> 09:49.120]  on dead on us embassy attacking Baghdad pro Iran mob death to America diplomats in safe
[09:49.120 --> 09:50.120]  room.
[09:50.120 --> 09:58.720]  Trump Tehran will pay that stretch report.com's accurate headline and here are the headlines
[09:58.720 --> 10:05.600]  from CNN that tells us America was never great will never be that great.
[10:05.600 --> 10:08.280]  Protesters try to storm the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
[10:08.280 --> 10:09.800]  Well, they're not protesters.
[10:09.800 --> 10:13.520]  They're terrorists that reportedly have injured and killed people and are burning down buildings
[10:13.520 --> 10:20.800]  and trying to take hostages till they got shot with tear gas and bean bag project calls
[10:20.800 --> 10:23.080]  and rubber bullets.
[10:23.080 --> 10:30.480]  That's U.S. soil I treaty people assaulting just like 1979 with the takeover of the U.S.
[10:30.480 --> 10:31.640]  Embassy in Tehran.
[10:31.640 --> 10:36.080]  We're going to be getting to that.
[10:36.080 --> 10:56.320]  It's currently going on and the takeover of the U.S. Embassy 1979 in Tehran, Iran.
[10:56.320 --> 11:02.440]  Continuing here's the Washington Post protesters chant death to America break into U.S. Embassy
[11:02.440 --> 11:05.600]  compound in Baghdad.
[11:05.600 --> 11:11.000]  So I guess if I went down to a federal building and broke into it and beat people up and aimed
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.400]  guns at them and then burned something down, I'll just go, oh, I'm a protester.
[11:14.400 --> 11:19.840]  Of course, I'd get shot dead and I should be unless I was storming the building, you
[11:19.840 --> 11:25.360]  know, to save kidnapped kids or something.
[11:25.360 --> 11:33.400]  People with battering rams wearing Hezbollah outfits, Hezbollah flags and the U.S. contractors,
[11:33.400 --> 11:41.160]  SOCs, the group that has a contract were ordered to stand down by the ambassador.
[11:41.160 --> 11:42.160]  And why is that?
[11:42.160 --> 11:45.920]  Oh, they're saying it's an Iranian trap to get us to shoot people so they can cause
[11:45.920 --> 11:48.240]  a civil war in Iraq.
[11:48.240 --> 11:56.880]  Well, when you attack an embassy like that, the default is defended or you end up with
[11:56.880 --> 12:06.640]  a bunch of people who are hostages with Iran trying the same thing again, like they did
[12:06.640 --> 12:10.480]  in 1979 in Tehran, Iran.
[12:10.480 --> 12:15.960]  And all you do is you go to YouTube, there it is, your TV viewer, and we can show you
[12:15.960 --> 12:28.040]  what happened back in 1979 and 1980 and that whole crazy situation, but it was a takeover
[12:28.040 --> 12:40.360]  by terrorists and they got a bunch of hostages and that's what they just tried to do again.
[12:40.360 --> 12:42.960]  There's another CNN headline.
[12:42.960 --> 12:50.160]  Others attack U.S. embassy in Baghdad after airstrike.
[12:50.160 --> 12:53.840]  The airstrikes were on Iranian forces engaged in military operations who were trying to
[12:53.840 --> 12:57.040]  take over Iraq, which isn't controlled by Iran.
[12:57.040 --> 12:59.120]  They've been trying to take it over for a long time.
[12:59.120 --> 13:03.520]  They had a seven-year war, eight-year war back in the 1980s.
[13:03.520 --> 13:06.440]  So Iran is the aggressor in all of this.
[13:06.440 --> 13:14.360]  Trump says Iran will be held fully responsible for attack on the U.S. embassy in Iraq.
[13:14.360 --> 13:16.360]  Iraqis attack U.S. embassy in Baghdad.
[13:16.360 --> 13:23.440]  Soldiers come under siege as Hezbollah supporters storm complex.
[13:23.440 --> 13:25.320]  Daily Mail got it right.
[13:25.320 --> 13:27.720]  Militiamen breach U.S. embassy in Baghdad.
[13:27.720 --> 13:29.520]  Trump blames Iran.
[13:29.520 --> 13:30.520]  Blames Iran.
[13:30.520 --> 13:31.520]  That's AP.
[13:31.520 --> 13:36.440]  That's a more accurate headline, though, but they won't even back the president when the
[13:36.440 --> 13:44.240]  people say, we're with Hezbollah, we block Iran, and Iran is openly phonening it.
[13:44.240 --> 13:49.720]  Our media is so anti-American they won't even agree with the president that the sky is blue.
[13:49.720 --> 13:53.200]  Violent protest erupt around U.S. embassy in Baghdad after U.S. airstrike.
[13:53.200 --> 13:54.200]  Reuters.
[13:54.200 --> 13:58.320]  Is U.S. embassy attacking Baghdad part of an Iran trap?
[13:58.320 --> 14:12.600]  A toll-free number to join us to discuss this, and so much more is 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX.
[14:12.600 --> 14:16.760]  And I do want to give first-time callers a chance in the first round to get on them.
[14:16.760 --> 14:17.760]  We'll take calls from everybody.
[14:17.760 --> 14:20.560]  And any callers yesterday that were left on hold, we got your number.
[14:20.560 --> 14:21.760]  We're able to call you back.
[14:21.760 --> 14:23.360]  We'll get you lined up first.
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.280]  As I promised we would do, I think I see some now popping up on the board, so that is all
[14:27.280 --> 14:28.280]  coming up.
[14:28.280 --> 14:32.920]  It's obviously not just this issue, though it's a big one.
[14:32.920 --> 14:38.880]  That's one way of the deep stake to try to derail Trump is another 1979-1980 hostage crisis
[14:38.880 --> 14:39.880]  with Iran.
[14:39.880 --> 14:42.200]  Iran is trying to repeat that, obviously.
[14:42.200 --> 14:44.760]  They're working with elements in the deep state.
[14:44.760 --> 14:50.320]  John Kerry, George Soros, Hillary Obama, to have shadow policy and to derail what Trump's
[14:50.320 --> 14:51.320]  been doing.
[14:51.320 --> 14:52.760]  They've admitted that.
[14:52.760 --> 14:55.920]  You talk about treason, that's it.
[14:55.920 --> 14:59.360]  And there was just some footage for TV viewers of what happened back in the 79.
[14:59.360 --> 15:00.800]  Let's keep rolling that.
[15:00.800 --> 15:06.720]  So they're trying this again, and if Trump wants to stop it, he has to beef up security
[15:06.720 --> 15:10.920]  at these embassies, especially the big green zone that's heavily fortified.
[15:10.920 --> 15:16.280]  And he has to give orders that if someone breaches it, you kill them.
[15:16.280 --> 15:19.760]  And if someone is organizing and approaching saying they're going to breach it with a battering
[15:19.760 --> 15:22.360]  ram, you light them up.
[15:22.360 --> 15:30.040]  But again, the head ambassador and others have evacuated, leaving others there to be
[15:30.040 --> 15:33.680]  hostages, and this all needs to be investigated.
[15:33.680 --> 15:38.720]  Who gave the order to let the terrorists breach the facility and set it on fire?
[15:38.720 --> 15:42.240]  So our media could call them loving protesters, kind of like when Al-Baghdadi got killed,
[15:42.240 --> 15:48.000]  they called him a austere religious leader, a man of goodness.
[15:48.000 --> 15:54.320]  So it's all coming up, the latest on the Chai comms, that's huge news.
[15:54.320 --> 15:58.000]  It's up on drugsreport.com, your phone calls, and so much more.
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.240]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[16:03.240 --> 16:07.480]  backup system but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[16:07.480 --> 16:09.280]  important message you'll ever hear.
[16:09.280 --> 16:13.160]  Bill Hyde, here I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on
[16:13.160 --> 16:17.760]  our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[16:17.760 --> 16:18.760]  off the grid.
[16:18.760 --> 16:22.400]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here, right on the
[16:22.400 --> 16:24.160]  east bank of the Mississippi.
[16:24.160 --> 16:28.120]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location,
[16:28.120 --> 16:31.720]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[16:31.720 --> 16:36.080]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[16:36.080 --> 16:41.720]  So here's what you should do right now, check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[16:41.720 --> 16:47.080]  That's myownpowergrid.com, over a thousand dollars in great off the grid gear and a ton
[16:47.080 --> 16:48.080]  of bonuses too.
[16:48.080 --> 16:52.320]  And the best part, you're not going to pay 750 or 500 dollars, 300 or even 200.

[19:05.360 --> 19:10.200]  I've been on the air so long that I take it for granted now when we break some massive
[19:10.200 --> 19:16.680]  story that changes the whole world and that really does great things for the future of
[19:16.680 --> 19:20.080]  not just our children, but our children's children.
[19:20.080 --> 19:22.000]  Info wars really has changed history.
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.200]  And that's why I need to pull back and ask the listeners, because I know you're a lot
[19:25.200 --> 19:29.200]  like me, to really think about a world without info wars.
[19:29.200 --> 19:33.680]  Because I can tell you right now, if people don't really step to the plate and really
[19:33.680 --> 19:38.280]  financially support our broadcast going into 2020, we're not going to be on the air in
[19:38.280 --> 19:39.920]  a year or so.

[20:33.600 --> 20:35.600]  We've got it.
[20:35.600 --> 20:37.600]  We've got it.

[20:39.600 --> 20:41.600]  We've got it.
[20:41.600 --> 20:43.600]  We've got it.
[20:43.600 --> 21:00.600]  We've got it.
[21:00.600 --> 21:07.600]  We've got it.
[21:07.600 --> 21:13.360]  St. Louis and just the great job he did in front of Congress pulling that off perfectly and all the rest of the great work
[21:13.360 --> 21:15.360]  He's doing our other reporters. You know
[21:16.200 --> 21:18.200]  I'm a fan of our crew
[21:19.400 --> 21:24.500]  I've met like Michael Jordan and all these other top Hollywood people and
[21:25.280 --> 21:28.040]  They're interesting and they've definitely got something about them, but I
[21:28.680 --> 21:31.380]  See like Owen Schreuer walking on the hall and I go, that's Owen Schreuer
[21:31.560 --> 21:34.200]  That's somebody fighting for my future my children's future
[21:34.200 --> 21:40.800]  That's the guy that has a will not to care what the global is due to him or be de-platformed or be lied about or be demonized
[21:40.800 --> 21:44.720]  And he just gets stronger in the face of it. That's the spirit
[21:46.720 --> 21:48.720]  Because the quote
[21:48.960 --> 21:50.960]  Roy Batty from Blade Runner
[21:51.240 --> 21:55.000]  It better get it better get it up or I'm gonna have to kill you
[21:56.040 --> 21:58.040]  Look at that
[21:59.800 --> 22:01.800]  Get it up or I'm gonna have to kill you
[22:01.800 --> 22:03.800]  Yeah, it's a good quote
[22:04.360 --> 22:06.960]  I don't know other good quotes in that movie, but let me
[22:08.120 --> 22:10.120]  Get back to what I was saying
[22:10.200 --> 22:13.000]  We're taking your calls right now and then
[22:15.320 --> 22:19.240]  Into the hour I'm gonna start the second I come in live
[22:20.520 --> 22:24.320]  The second I come in like a horse out of the gates and
[22:25.160 --> 22:28.600]  I'm going to cover what's really going on
[22:28.600 --> 22:32.040]  From the fluid situation and the different
[22:33.080 --> 22:40.560]  factions in our government and in the Iranian government and in the Middle East and how dangerous this attack on the embassy is and what it
[22:40.960 --> 22:48.560]  Signifies in the new year on how the globalists are gonna try to test and then derail Trump because they're billing it as his new Benghazi or
[22:49.240 --> 22:51.240]  His new Bay of Pigs
[22:51.440 --> 22:57.120]  But really what it is is a rerun of 1979 by the deep state to
[22:57.120 --> 22:59.120]  embarrass Jimmy Carter
[23:00.440 --> 23:02.440]  So that is all
[23:03.520 --> 23:04.760]  Coming up today
[23:04.760 --> 23:07.760]  I also shot a special report right before I went live on that
[23:08.160 --> 23:13.720]  That'll be posted on info wars.com has a lot of documentation and it in four clean minutes
[23:14.160 --> 23:16.280]  So that'll be on info wars.com soon
[23:17.720 --> 23:19.720]  Also, wow
[23:20.840 --> 23:25.000]  I had one of the reporters walk up and say hey, what do you want to call the article we put out every day?
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.360]  with a headline about the live feed of the show and what the main
[23:31.040 --> 23:37.440]  Topic is what the top story is and it really is the chai-kong takeover of the planet
[23:40.080 --> 23:41.120]  And
[23:41.120 --> 23:42.880]  I'm not for abortion
[23:42.880 --> 23:50.120]  But I am for metaphysical abortion of horrible monstrosities like baby Grendel rolling out from between his serpent mother's legs
[23:50.760 --> 23:53.440]  so I would like to kill Grendel in utero and
[23:53.440 --> 23:58.960]  and Trump got in and patriots are getting elected all the world in about the eight month and
[24:00.520 --> 24:05.960]  So Grendel's mommy has gone ahead and decided to push Grendel out and
[24:07.680 --> 24:10.080]  Grendel is getting up on his hind legs right now
[24:10.280 --> 24:15.200]  We really need Beowulf to rip his arm out by the socket and strangling like right now
[24:15.200 --> 24:22.920]  We need Beowulf right now to do a number on Grendel and then do a number on
[24:25.600 --> 24:31.480]  Grendel's mommy who is the globalist that have created this monstrosity so
[24:33.440 --> 24:39.600]  Here are those headlines that I'm gonna hit at the middle and I'm gonna do this of the second hour and I'm gonna do it
[24:39.600 --> 24:45.480]  Chinese state media gun ownership out of control in the US calls for our guns to be taken
[24:46.280 --> 24:48.280]  That's Breitbart
[24:48.280 --> 24:53.320]  Here's a big story Michael Snyder from end of the American Dream blog. It's posted up on dredger4.com
[24:53.880 --> 24:58.560]  The takeover China is building enormous self-sustaining
[24:59.320 --> 25:04.760]  Chinese cities all over the African continent will explain why that's so important
[25:05.760 --> 25:07.760]  because you're hearing that
[25:07.760 --> 25:10.000]  Globalism is dead in 2020
[25:11.920 --> 25:16.960]  Not so fast it's damaged it's exposed, but it was always meant to metastasize
[25:18.560 --> 25:20.560]  Into the takeover
[25:21.120 --> 25:28.240]  So if you want to know about that, I'm gonna lay it out bottom the next hour and the economic sabotage the globalists are engaged in to make sure that we never
[25:29.480 --> 25:31.480]  Are able
[25:31.480 --> 25:35.880]  To stop it, but if you're aware of this operation, it's very easy to be
[25:36.680 --> 25:42.680]  But you've got to admit how horrible it is to beat it and most people go. Hey, let's be in a stage of denial here
[25:43.440 --> 25:46.680]  Unless just convince ourselves. Everything's really gonna be okay. It's not that bad
[25:47.520 --> 25:55.680]  That's not being optimistic. That's not being realistic facing just how bad it is is what allows you to deal with it and defeat it
[25:56.680 --> 25:58.680]  hiding bad news
[25:58.680 --> 26:02.080]  It's not a good thing to do. Let's get out ahead of it because we can fix it
[26:03.200 --> 26:04.240]  easily
[26:04.240 --> 26:06.240]  but you've got to admit
[26:06.240 --> 26:08.240]  yourself the full
[26:08.760 --> 26:10.760]  Magnitude
[26:10.760 --> 26:12.760]  so that's coming up and
[26:12.840 --> 26:17.800]  The handover of the internet to the chai cons and all of it. How do we kill Grendel and
[26:18.600 --> 26:22.400]  Save the Chinese people who are the main blood source of this thing
[26:23.080 --> 26:25.560]  But it's gotta be done really really
[26:25.560 --> 26:28.400]  fast can't wait much longer
[26:29.080 --> 26:31.080]  to cut it off
[26:38.080 --> 26:43.360]  And it's that debate within globalism that's allowed us to drive a wedge into their own system and defeat them
[26:43.360 --> 26:46.160]  So it's it's it's a big deal. We're gonna cover that and
[26:46.720 --> 26:52.120]  the history of government protecting mass shooters and then hyping up mass shootings and the admissions that it's causing
[26:52.120 --> 26:55.680]  Mass shootings the way the media hypes it and what's coming in 2020 in my view as well
[26:55.680 --> 27:00.520]  But your calls though throughout the broadcast and it's probably been a couple years as I've gone to calls by this segment
[27:00.520 --> 27:03.520]  But I'm doing it right now. Jeff in Canada
[27:04.240 --> 27:08.160]  Jeff in Canada is our first caller. Thank you sir for joining us. Go ahead
[27:09.640 --> 27:11.640]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call
[27:12.160 --> 27:18.640]  Two things. I think the the first thing and most important thing is a personal relationship with Jesus second thing
[27:18.640 --> 27:24.040]  is the free speech issue is the hinge for every other issue and
[27:24.040 --> 27:28.720]  You were talking a couple shows ago about how do we wake up Trump to the fact that he
[27:29.240 --> 27:35.040]  He's the one that has to make this initiative. We can talk about it all day, but we're the frog is boiling, right?
[27:35.040 --> 27:37.040]  Or it was about to boil. So
[27:37.680 --> 27:39.680]  Here's what I was thinking
[27:39.920 --> 27:45.280]  What would it look like if Trump would look out into one of his rallies and he said
[27:45.280 --> 27:51.920]  Trump would look out into one of his rallies and he saw hundreds or thousands of people with duct tape on their mouth
[27:52.160 --> 27:57.480]  With I was censored for what looking at infowars. I was censored for
[27:58.200 --> 28:01.320]  Talking about vaccines. I was censored for whatever and
[28:02.200 --> 28:06.560]  What I'm seeing and I'll submit this to you. I'm not just a just an idea
[28:07.240 --> 28:15.080]  What about the the armored vehicle showing up at a Trump rally early when the big lines are out and go out hand out duck tape and
[28:15.080 --> 28:17.760]  talk to people about the essential
[28:18.840 --> 28:21.440]  fact that that free speech is going and
[28:22.120 --> 28:27.480]  Do a silent protest at a Trump rally with people putting duck tape over their mouth? Jeff
[28:27.480 --> 28:29.640]  How would you like to fly to Austin and?
[28:30.680 --> 28:36.280]  Get hired as a contractor for the next 300 days to run that operation because that that that's we actually
[28:36.880 --> 28:43.040]  talked about that a few weeks ago how to go mobilize the fans the patriots to not take over a Trump rally
[28:43.040 --> 28:49.840]  But to go in with a strong message and we actually debated like handing out t-shirts that said something like that
[28:49.840 --> 28:53.120]  But the duck tape over the mouth is even better stay right there
[28:53.640 --> 28:56.760]  That's why 2020 is the year of awakening
[28:58.000 --> 29:03.640]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain the hottest financial sector without all the speculation
[29:03.640 --> 29:11.320]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin seen on programs broadcast on Fox business news
[29:11.320 --> 29:16.280]  Blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace
[29:16.520 --> 29:24.480]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets
[29:24.880 --> 29:32.920]  Non-security IPO or note blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment

[33:19.120 --> 33:21.120]  307 days out
[33:22.080 --> 33:24.080]  We're live
[33:24.080 --> 33:31.040]  Talking about these incredible trends and how do we become part of the solution not just cannon fodder to be overrun by other men and women's
[33:32.320 --> 33:35.760]  Ideas of how we should live our lives, but clearly in this new year
[33:36.400 --> 33:40.360]  We're gonna face the full wrath of the globalist with false flags wars
[33:40.360 --> 33:46.520]  They try to start attempts to sabotage the economy attempts to trigger race wars and their supporters
[33:46.520 --> 33:49.880]  Who have been completely brainwashed and put into a trance?
[33:50.480 --> 33:54.480]  Are going to become what can only be described as
[33:55.280 --> 34:02.200]  Rabbit who knew that Cronenberg's film would become a documentary in 2020
[34:02.200 --> 34:18.560]  Therapists in the u.s. Say they are seeing increasing numbers of patients with what they call Donald Trump anxiety disorder
[34:18.800 --> 34:22.720]  Trump anxiety disorder Trump derangement syndrome
[34:22.720 --> 34:31.160]  Trump derangement syndrome is clinically real. It doesn't merely affect individuals
[34:31.360 --> 34:38.120]  But entire political parties rendering them unrecognizable one minute. They're perfectly normal the next
[34:43.040 --> 34:46.240]  The veneer of civilization is evaporating quickly
[34:46.240 --> 34:54.400]  Families and culture are collapsing and godless leftist are behaving just like zombies of modern
[34:58.480 --> 35:00.480]  You can't trust your mother
[35:03.080 --> 35:05.080]  Your best friend

[35:14.400 --> 35:22.000]  Doctors are seeing patients suffering from Trump anxiety disorder a number of people are manifesting what I would post
[35:22.000 --> 35:34.320]  Trumpmatic stress disorder an overpowering fear that president Trump represents the end of the world
[35:34.960 --> 35:37.880]  Pray it doesn't happen to you
[35:37.880 --> 36:05.720]  I would thank you for everything
[36:05.720 --> 36:08.480]  You've done for the info war, but I know you're like me
[36:08.480 --> 36:13.920]  You don't want my thanks you want victory over the globalist in these devil worship and child molesters
[36:13.920 --> 36:16.440]  And you want them off your back and off your children's back
[36:16.440 --> 36:20.320]  And you know what I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team

[37:44.660 --> 37:48.180]  Spend all their time trying to silence you and they have you accept that
[37:48.180 --> 37:53.340]  Disempowerment instead of going wait a minute. They're trying to silence me. I'll just fight back in the third dimension
[37:54.020 --> 37:59.180]  I'll go to leftist rallies. I'll go to Trump rallies. I'll go to sporting events. I'll go to church
[37:59.180 --> 38:01.760]  I'll go everywhere and I'll have my voice heard

[38:20.740 --> 38:25.780]  Okay, I said I'm taking a lot of calls today and I am now Jeff in Canada is
[38:26.780 --> 38:28.780]  a very polite
[38:29.060 --> 38:31.060]  very humble man and
[38:31.860 --> 38:33.300]  Then
[38:33.300 --> 38:35.660]  By the grace of God it's its providence
[38:36.780 --> 38:39.220]  We had had a very similar idea a
[38:39.220 --> 38:45.820]  Month ago, and then again a few weeks ago in meetings. We're having another one of these meetings today
[38:47.020 --> 38:52.860]  And it's like juggling things. I'm not complaining. It's just trying to get the money into fun things trying to hire people
[38:53.540 --> 38:55.540]  Trying to train them
[38:55.740 --> 38:59.820]  Trying to deploy people trying to get out around the country and
[39:01.060 --> 39:07.500]  Then looking at Trump not acting against the censorship and the racketeering and the election meddling that
[39:07.500 --> 39:09.500]  Professor
[39:11.220 --> 39:13.220]  Robert
[39:13.380 --> 39:18.020]  Epstein has exposed his 20-something little life just died the other day very mysteriously I should have but
[39:19.740 --> 39:24.100]  That they're already fixing the 2018 election and now this one with 307 days out and
[39:24.740 --> 39:28.740]  So Trump needs to do something. Well, how do we go to the Trump events and
[39:28.740 --> 39:37.420]  And not disrupt them or the media can spin what we say or take it out of context
[39:40.420 --> 39:42.300]  But
[39:42.300 --> 39:44.300]  Habit where it's so
[39:44.660 --> 39:50.860]  Powerful and so illustrative that there's no way it can be ignored and it's what the caller just said we're going back to him
[39:52.740 --> 39:54.740]  Today
[39:54.740 --> 40:02.460]  I'm going to soon as I get off the air have meetings about our reporters in the streets around the country a big map on the wall
[40:02.460 --> 40:05.220]  The dates listed who we've got what we can do
[40:06.260 --> 40:08.260]  the fact that I'm trying to
[40:08.660 --> 40:11.300]  Get other talk show hosts other people I know men
[40:13.820 --> 40:20.100]  To go with their own mic flag, but we'll pay for it and just report all these things and most of them and I call are scared
[40:20.100 --> 40:23.980]  I'm not going to name names, but they're scared to
[40:24.860 --> 40:26.860]  Actually go cover these events
[40:28.260 --> 40:36.580]  People think it's a virtue to hide they think it's a virtue to oh the safest thing to do is just report on it from a bunker
[40:36.580 --> 40:49.580]  Well men were like that back in 1776 we'd still be under the British Empire right now
[40:53.860 --> 40:58.420]  But all men aren't like that it's just it finding out who people are organizing them
[40:58.420 --> 41:02.460]  We don't get to do an eight-week boot camp here and keep people up for three days and find out who they really are
[41:02.460 --> 41:06.340]  You know that's why the military does that you got to do that really find out who somebody is
[41:08.100 --> 41:12.940]  But I'm trying as hard as I can and I just thank God for Owen Schreuer and the rest is crew we've got
[41:15.660 --> 41:18.140]  But yes, we need to come up with a
[41:20.100 --> 41:23.500]  Bumper sticker that covers the average size mouth. I guess that's about
[41:24.660 --> 41:30.180]  Four inches long for an image is long about two inches high that has what looks like duct tape
[41:30.180 --> 41:35.980]  Image because you try to actually cut it off the duct tape that sticks too hard and we'll come an issue and we should know
[41:35.980 --> 41:39.140]  You need bumper stickers mass produced that look like duct tape have the duct tape pattern
[41:42.020 --> 41:46.180]  That have messages on them like info wars calm or
[41:47.700 --> 41:50.100]  Stop censorship or silenced or
[41:51.860 --> 41:55.820]  Stop force vaccinations. We're gonna have a bunch of these will come up with like ten different
[41:55.820 --> 41:59.900]  Messages and then I'm gonna have my crew
[42:00.980 --> 42:03.420]  And a lot of the big Trump events we'd be at all of them
[42:03.420 --> 42:08.140]  We had the money and the people and at Democrat events and you know what volunteers can call here
[42:08.340 --> 42:11.500]  I'll answer the damn phones and if you say I want
[42:12.860 --> 42:16.260]  500 stickers and you pledge to go hand those out at Trump rallies or
[42:17.420 --> 42:18.700]  Wherever
[42:18.700 --> 42:23.020]  We'll we're just expending all the money. We've got I'm spending everything. I've got extra
[42:23.020 --> 42:25.900]  Just boom with enjoyment by the way
[42:28.700 --> 42:31.140]  To really really take action and
[42:31.620 --> 42:35.860]  Get this out. So I'm gonna come back to you Jeff and then I'll get to the calls and I'll get to the news and
[42:36.380 --> 42:40.020]  But but but your call is so huge. This is the answer
[42:40.660 --> 42:44.220]  Here ladies and gentlemen, this is the answer is
[42:44.860 --> 42:50.380]  Everyone with the silence at the Trump events and and and probably half the Trump supporters are info warriors
[42:50.380 --> 42:54.620]  If you'll just wear these part of the time inside it will take the events over and force this issue
[42:54.620 --> 43:00.060]  This is so critical and it's about us exercising our power Andy in Florida. Thank you Andy go ahead
[43:00.060 --> 43:04.820]  Hey Alex, I love you man. We love you before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand
[43:04.820 --> 43:07.620]  I gotta talk about one of your product a little bit about me. I'm
[43:07.980 --> 43:13.260]  245 pounds I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short
[43:13.260 --> 43:16.260]  I used to have a problem with Adderall. I do have ADHD
[43:16.260 --> 43:21.860]  But you know, I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties, you know, I kind of got a little out of hand and you know
[43:21.860 --> 43:23.700]  I listen you religiously in my truck every day
[43:23.700 --> 43:28.300]  So I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche this product changed my life
[43:28.300 --> 43:30.100]  But turbo force really changed my life
[43:30.100 --> 43:34.460]  He was dead no longer take Adderall and I get by literally the 13 hours a day
[43:34.460 --> 43:39.020]  I work on a half of a packet of your turbo for and if you take a half a packet
[43:39.020 --> 43:43.020]  That's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money versus you know a monster
[43:43.020 --> 43:47.740]  Which is what 499 and I you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo forces
[43:47.740 --> 43:51.020]  And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it. We're really proud of turbo force

[44:02.500 --> 44:08.140]  I don't have to tell you that 2020 is gonna be maker to break it not just for info or is not just for America
[44:08.140 --> 44:09.100]  But the whole world
[44:09.100 --> 44:14.860]  We are in a battle between the forces of globalism that want a post-human world and those that want a pro-human world
[44:14.860 --> 44:20.020]  We're in a fight between Satan and Christ and it's being played out amongst us mortals
[44:20.340 --> 44:25.060]  But it's being directed from on high and I'm just telling the listeners this broadcast
[44:25.660 --> 44:27.660]  Without you
[44:27.740 --> 44:29.020]  We're gonna lose this fight

[45:06.940 --> 45:11.260]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy week
[45:11.260 --> 45:16.460]  I don't I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go turbo force is my favorite and all the info wars products are down
[45:16.460 --> 45:18.820]  To take control your life take control your health

[45:22.820 --> 45:24.820]  Nobody wakes up in the morning

[45:38.340 --> 45:41.020]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said tape. You're such a good guy
[45:41.020 --> 45:45.700]  How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me
[45:45.700 --> 45:48.780]  I woke up and thought you know what? Okay. I want to take control of my life

[46:03.020 --> 46:08.940]  It's really strong. I shouldn't do this because all work and no playmates jack a really aggressive boy and the coffee has to
[46:08.940 --> 46:12.940]  But wake up America coffee there by loves highest rated in the Chiapas Mountains

[46:56.580 --> 46:58.580]  Anyways, it's all at info more store.com
[47:01.620 --> 47:04.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:04.500 --> 47:19.980]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[47:19.980 --> 47:35.140]  We now take to the central Texas comments in the heart of the resistance
[47:36.540 --> 47:42.620]  You know, I said at the start of the show the millisecond I go live at the last segment of this hour
[47:42.940 --> 47:44.940]  I'm gonna get into how huge
[47:44.940 --> 47:51.180]  This Iran takeover of the embassy attempted takeover is the media calling it protesters. It's so critical and it is
[47:51.180 --> 47:53.180]  Now I'm gonna give all the angles of it and take her call
[47:54.700 --> 47:59.180]  Well, I'm gonna have to give to that in a couple minutes because I know
[48:00.700 --> 48:07.340]  That when I go to a caller like Jeff and he said what he said I knew the second he said it it was definitely
[48:08.060 --> 48:10.060]  I knew the second he said it
[48:10.060 --> 48:14.940]  I've been given my orders because you see here's the secret
[48:16.940 --> 48:23.260]  This is the central Texas command center and as Texas goes the nation goes and the globalist
[48:23.660 --> 48:30.060]  It's in the Financial Times of London. It's in Durst Spiegel. They're like, don't worry the Communist Chinese are like, don't worry
[48:31.340 --> 48:38.980]  We've cut the resources off to the Midwest and the only state still standing that could prop up the US is Texas and
[48:38.980 --> 48:45.060]  And soon we'll be in political control of that. I have articles where the Chinese government is bragging about getting our guns
[48:45.700 --> 48:47.700]  and taking down the mythical Texans
[48:48.740 --> 48:53.860]  And it is kind of funny that Texas is the main resistance right now to the globalist and there's resistance everywhere, but
[48:54.820 --> 48:57.940]  They are literally bragging how they've hurt the Midwest
[48:58.260 --> 49:05.220]  How they've hurt the southwest and how the coastal cities are a bunch of brainwashed zombies. It's very very scary very very sad
[49:05.220 --> 49:11.460]  And they're bragging that when they get Texas and Beto and that whole hype
[49:13.620 --> 49:16.420]  He was like a gas giant he got real bigger than imploded but
[49:17.780 --> 49:21.220]  That star power of the hype of a roar
[49:23.300 --> 49:29.300]  Turn most of the judgeships in the tech in Texas blue. I mean he almost beat Ted Cruz
[49:29.300 --> 49:33.620]  California used to be redder than Texas
[49:37.140 --> 49:41.300]  And so we have to go with the messages that we think are most important
[49:42.020 --> 49:44.980]  Because when you go to a Trump rally the president's there the media is there
[49:45.860 --> 49:48.340]  And you need to wear the sticker on your mouth
[49:49.540 --> 49:53.540]  We'll come out with 10 of them. I'll I mean I'll have them done in a couple weeks. I'll have them rush delivered
[49:53.540 --> 50:00.580]  And we'll have it where it's a censorship stop censorship
[50:04.740 --> 50:06.740]  You know every order
[50:07.140 --> 50:09.140]  at infowarstore.com
[50:09.620 --> 50:11.620]  has a whole bunch
[50:11.700 --> 50:13.700]  A bumper stickers on it
[50:13.700 --> 50:17.780]  That's say Alex Jones lives in full wars.com defend your country in four wars.com
[50:18.260 --> 50:22.100]  I am 1776 honk of epsi didn't kill himself in four wars.com
[50:22.100 --> 50:25.220]  These little mini stickers people love you can stick up all over
[50:27.220 --> 50:33.620]  You've got sticker packs at cost at infowarstore.com to get them out, but you know what that's all important, but
[50:36.820 --> 50:38.820]  We're gonna print stickers
[50:40.260 --> 50:44.820]  That you can just stick on your mouth when you see the media or stick on the mouth when you go into the Trump rally
[50:46.100 --> 50:48.580]  Take them off when you want to yell and cheer have a couple of them
[50:48.580 --> 50:50.580]  And then
[50:53.940 --> 50:57.780]  People will understand why suddenly you hear stop the censorship
[50:59.700 --> 51:01.700]  info wars.com
[51:01.860 --> 51:07.620]  We're not going and yelling bill clinton's a rapist that totally derailed them with their fake claim that trump was a rapist
[51:08.740 --> 51:12.900]  Hundreds of you did that it changed the whole narrative. It's one of the reasons trump got in you game changed
[51:13.860 --> 51:16.260]  Well, this time we'll have our people there
[51:16.260 --> 51:19.140]  I'll hire extra folks to go up and down the lines
[51:20.020 --> 51:25.540]  And you'll see the armored vehicle at these events go to it. Um, we're gonna put a number out today
[51:26.260 --> 51:29.460]  Let's put a hotline on me like a thousand calls have to go through all the other calls, but
[51:31.060 --> 51:35.620]  Send us an email at show tips at info wars.com say I pledge to hand out a hundred stickers
[51:35.860 --> 51:37.860]  I pledge to hand out a thousand stickers
[51:38.820 --> 51:41.300]  And we'll just pay whatever it takes
[51:41.300 --> 51:47.460]  You know what? I just believe you whoever goes to show tips at info wars.com and ask for stickers. Give us your address
[51:47.700 --> 51:50.420]  We'll call through those. We'll send you those. I'm not gonna wait
[51:51.780 --> 51:57.220]  Now I'll man the damn thing myself. I'll I'll box it up. I'll do it because I'm not gonna let destiny
[51:57.860 --> 52:00.900]  Go past us and we need to go take over those trump events
[52:02.900 --> 52:05.700]  And demand that conservative ink be removed
[52:05.700 --> 52:11.300]  And that the neocon never trumpers be removed and that the people that got trump elected be
[52:11.860 --> 52:16.580]  Defended by their president that the bill of rights be defended. That is a serious solution
[52:19.060 --> 52:23.060]  And then when trump pauses info wars.com
[52:24.100 --> 52:28.820]  You'll save info wars.com because that's a rallying cry and assemble the media hates
[52:28.820 --> 52:36.740]  They've tried to silence it. You'll inject that in and we'll cause a whole nother debate about all of that
[52:37.540 --> 52:41.380]  And there's other things we can do but I've you know, we talked about this last week on air and this week
[52:42.260 --> 52:44.100]  on sunday
[52:44.100 --> 52:48.420]  I said, I don't really want to go take over trump events and have the media spin it
[52:49.300 --> 52:52.660]  And have people not understand what we're doing because I'm not against trump, but I'm saying
[52:52.660 --> 53:00.740]  Pardon the signs pardon roger stone. Those are going to be stickers and he could get a signs out a song is dying. That's in the news today
[53:02.900 --> 53:04.900]  Years and years and years of solitary confinement
[53:06.900 --> 53:11.700]  Trump told him I don't care who released should have a fat naked guy in his mother's basement or the russians
[53:11.700 --> 53:15.700]  It doesn't matter. It's her emails. It's her crimes release them. I totally agree with that
[53:15.700 --> 53:22.340]  Well, now you're not helping a sign. So
[53:22.580 --> 53:24.580]  We're gonna have a whole bunch of these
[53:25.540 --> 53:32.500]  Hell we're gonna have 20 messages. In fact, send your ideas to show tips at info wars.com of what you think ought to be on the stickers
[53:34.020 --> 53:37.460]  And then you can just come and choose what you want or we'll give you a big little
[53:38.260 --> 53:40.740]  Bags full of 50 of them a hundred of them a thousand of them
[53:40.740 --> 53:45.940]  Whatever you want and then go to your church go to events go to your schools go to trump events
[53:45.940 --> 53:50.980]  Go to democrat events and hand these out to cause a debate and a discussion about what's happening
[53:51.060 --> 53:55.940]  It's it's one of the best ideas. I've heard a long long time jeff in canada other points you'd like to add
[53:58.340 --> 54:00.340]  Hey, thanks alex
[54:00.500 --> 54:02.500]  You know, I think there's uh
[54:02.740 --> 54:06.740]  A truth that you guys are the tip of the spear you guys are the best. I mean that's that's just the way it is
[54:06.740 --> 54:12.180]  You're sir. Hold on a second. You just gave the order to the central texas command center
[54:12.260 --> 54:19.300]  You are this information hub. You had the idea most of the time it's you I was driving around in 2015
[54:20.340 --> 54:22.900]  And saw a homemade sign in a yard
[54:23.860 --> 54:25.860]  That said hillary for prison
[54:26.340 --> 54:30.740]  2016 and I went with that idea and it was a third of the shirts at the r&c
[54:30.740 --> 54:36.900]  So that was again, you understand that the orders come from you. That's why trump always wanting to hear what his
[54:37.460 --> 54:41.140]  Supporters and always getting notes and demanding the secret service get all the stuff
[54:41.140 --> 54:43.620]  They give them and he puts it in a box on the plane and reads it
[54:43.700 --> 54:51.700]  He knows where the power comes from the ethos is you you with a soil it comes from you it comes from us
[54:52.740 --> 54:55.780]  Does it come from hollywood and all the trash and all the you know
[54:55.780 --> 55:01.380]  Globalist richie rich women and their fur coats and their plastic surgery it comes from the people
[55:02.740 --> 55:05.860]  So again, you're giving the orders here. Jeff go ahead
[55:07.220 --> 55:09.060]  Well praise god for us
[55:09.060 --> 55:11.460]  Say it. Jeff say I am the tip of the spear
[55:11.620 --> 55:15.220]  Jeff in canada is the tip of the spear and you're going to see your idea
[55:15.780 --> 55:20.260]  Manifest on the street and how big it is is up to the rest of these people
[55:20.260 --> 55:27.940]  That are the tip of the spear. I don't sit her and tell you all day that it's you to kiss your ass and make you feel important
[55:28.020 --> 55:32.180]  You are everything. I'm getting on my knees right now. I'm trying to give me a microphone
[55:32.980 --> 55:39.220]  I'm serious. I love my kids and I love god and I hate the death and I don't do anything to stop these people
[55:39.460 --> 55:45.300]  So I'm on my knees the lectures. I'm on my knees the viewers. I am on my knees
[55:45.940 --> 55:47.940]  Asking you to take action
[55:47.940 --> 55:55.140]  I am on my knees to you. You have the answers. You have the will. You have the strength. You have everything
[55:57.860 --> 56:02.580]  I don't want to sit here and watch us overrun by these zombies and their controllers
[56:04.020 --> 56:06.020]  So you heard Jeff say, oh, you are the tip of the spear
[56:07.060 --> 56:08.740]  Oh Jeff
[56:08.740 --> 56:10.420]  You're the tip of the spear
[56:10.420 --> 56:13.780]  It's like in beaver vendetta. You gotta find that scene when he's talking to the inspector
[56:15.060 --> 56:17.060]  V meets with the inspector. I'm sure it's the name of it
[56:17.060 --> 56:19.060]  He says to him
[56:19.380 --> 56:21.380]  Well, if you knew all this for 20 years
[56:21.780 --> 56:23.780]  Why didn't you do something?
[56:24.580 --> 56:28.420]  And he says I was waiting for you inspector. I was waiting for you
[56:30.020 --> 56:33.300]  Sorry Jeff go ahead. I love you to death Jeff. What else should we do Jeff?
[56:35.300 --> 56:38.420]  Well, Alex, I think uh by saying that that
[56:39.140 --> 56:44.180]  Info wars is the tip of the spear and it's all the people. It's all the patriots all the people like minds and hearts
[56:44.180 --> 56:51.780]  You know, I think it's gonna be uh the first domino like yellow vest is spread around the world. Yes
[56:52.820 --> 56:54.820]  And if this is done properly
[56:54.820 --> 56:59.620]  With the info wars being the booster rocket to take it into the stratosphere
[57:00.100 --> 57:05.540]  I think you're gonna see the censored people around the world picking this up with homemade duct tape
[57:05.620 --> 57:10.980]  And and it's gonna be a message that it's gonna speak a thousand words every time somebody sees it retweets it
[57:10.980 --> 57:14.420]  It sends it out and it's gonna push the narrative into
[57:15.140 --> 57:17.140]  Uh into the public sphere
[57:17.460 --> 57:23.780]  Perfectly said perfectly executed. We are the booster rocket. I've always felt that and known that that that my work
[57:24.260 --> 57:29.380]  Is to trigger and is to trigger the waves that'll defeat the globalists and we've already done it
[57:29.860 --> 57:31.220]  We've done it together
[57:31.220 --> 57:35.540]  We've already hit the zeitgeist over and over again because we are literally given the mandate
[57:35.540 --> 57:42.260]  Not of the tricoms, but of god almighty. We have the providence the whole world knows it and they can't stand it
[57:42.980 --> 57:46.740]  And all of our ancestors are applying all the power and force we need
[57:47.700 --> 57:56.980]  Well, there goes christmas 2019 and we're plunging into 2020 as we speak and as 2019
[57:58.020 --> 58:01.460]  Collapses into dust and the baby of 2020 is born

[1:00:18.180 --> 1:00:21.220]  Our revolution christa bird
[1:00:22.980 --> 1:00:26.740]  Some would make him play that song from christa bird coming up next segment this is
[1:00:27.700 --> 1:00:29.700]  What's his fellow's name the cross
[1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:33.700]  Was a solution. I can't remember time all blurs. I've had him on the show
[1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:38.420]  Just crazy so many great patriots steve boss
[1:00:40.260 --> 1:00:42.260]  That on the air a long time
[1:00:42.260 --> 1:00:47.540]  We're going right back to your phone calls, but let's just listen to part of this. Thank god for the renegades
[1:00:48.500 --> 1:00:50.500]  for you
[1:00:51.620 --> 1:00:54.740]  Far ahead of their time
[1:00:56.660 --> 1:00:58.660]  Without the renegades
[1:01:01.380 --> 1:01:06.500]  Lord knows where we be when it comes to heroes
[1:01:07.060 --> 1:01:09.060]  The gates of mine
[1:01:09.060 --> 1:01:11.060]  You
[1:01:14.900 --> 1:01:19.300]  Railed against the crown another rag tag man declaring independence
[1:01:30.420 --> 1:01:33.620]  They laid their bodies down on a bloody war
[1:01:33.620 --> 1:01:35.620]  They laid their bodies down
[1:01:36.980 --> 1:01:39.620]  On a bloody war the strength of all their blood
[1:01:40.420 --> 1:01:42.420]  It's physically
[1:01:42.580 --> 1:01:44.580]  And spiritually in you now
[1:01:45.620 --> 1:01:47.620]  The commitment the sacrifice
[1:01:48.420 --> 1:01:49.620]  The focus
[1:01:49.620 --> 1:01:51.380]  The spirit
[1:01:51.380 --> 1:01:53.860]  And the enemy fears that spirit above all
[1:01:54.820 --> 1:01:56.820]  Because that spirit is life
[1:01:58.340 --> 1:01:59.700]  Part of life
[1:01:59.700 --> 1:02:01.700]  You'd be willing to die for it
[1:02:01.700 --> 1:02:05.460]  Because from the sacrifice comes the strongest soil
[1:02:06.980 --> 1:02:11.860]  Make and try to make us forget that birthright and try to make us forget what's in that soil
[1:02:12.980 --> 1:02:16.740]  We must take from the soil what god has given us through our ancestors
[1:02:17.860 --> 1:02:21.940]  We must take it in our hands and feel the light in our soul
[1:02:23.780 --> 1:02:26.820]  And it comes to heroes renegades of mine
[1:02:28.820 --> 1:02:30.820]  And without the renegades
[1:02:30.820 --> 1:02:32.820]  Where will we be today?
[1:02:33.220 --> 1:02:37.060]  Ask yourself that question and then ask yourself who are the renegades
[1:02:37.940 --> 1:02:39.940]  In the world today
[1:02:40.740 --> 1:02:42.740]  You are those renegades
[1:02:43.780 --> 1:02:45.780]  Where are the renegades
[1:02:49.620 --> 1:02:52.260]  Who are the renegades in the world today?
[1:02:53.540 --> 1:02:55.540]  Thank god
[1:02:56.580 --> 1:02:58.580]  And the lives they lead
[1:02:58.580 --> 1:03:00.580]  The lives they lead
[1:03:00.580 --> 1:03:02.580]  All ahead of
[1:03:03.300 --> 1:03:05.300]  Their time
[1:03:08.260 --> 1:03:11.140]  Those that came before us could envision the future
[1:03:12.660 --> 1:03:14.340]  They envisioned it
[1:03:14.340 --> 1:03:16.340]  They built it
[1:03:16.340 --> 1:03:20.100]  We won't even live to see the things our sacrifices bring
[1:03:21.060 --> 1:03:23.060]  But know this
[1:03:23.380 --> 1:03:26.020]  The enemy has not even but run
[1:03:26.020 --> 1:03:33.460]  To force us to tap the resources of our ancestors that god gave us and the strength that they paid forward
[1:03:34.100 --> 1:03:41.940]  The spiritual dimensional well like a giant underground aquifer of pure energy waiting for us to access it
[1:03:42.660 --> 1:03:49.700]  And the enemies of god do not have that birthright. They cannot access their ancestors. They can access nothing but destruction
[1:03:50.580 --> 1:03:53.700]  And they believe their god will finally make them pure
[1:03:53.700 --> 1:03:57.940]  When all they do is produce death and sickness and ugliness
[1:03:57.940 --> 1:04:03.380]  They are cursed from the foundations of the earth to serving their master
[1:04:04.260 --> 1:04:06.660]  They are of their father the devil
[1:04:08.260 --> 1:04:15.460]  And nothing can save them because they have chosen to follow their father
[1:04:17.940 --> 1:04:20.340]  All right, no more preaching when I go to break
[1:04:20.340 --> 1:04:22.900]  I'm going to take 30 minutes of calls non-stop
[1:04:23.540 --> 1:04:26.980]  Then I'm going to cover the Iran and then I'm going to cover the chai-kong takeover
[1:04:27.540 --> 1:04:32.180]  It's all important, but you can feel the energy going into 2020
[1:04:34.580 --> 1:04:37.140]  You can feel god's wrath
[1:04:38.980 --> 1:04:40.980]  Being poured out
[1:04:40.980 --> 1:04:43.940]  Under the planet and the fear that anyone fears
[1:04:44.740 --> 1:04:46.740]  Should not be the devil
[1:04:46.740 --> 1:04:48.740]  The fear should not
[1:04:48.740 --> 1:04:53.700]  Be aligning yourself with god. We'll be back on the other side. Stay with us

[1:06:26.980 --> 1:06:30.260]  I can hear someone knocking on the door
[1:06:32.260 --> 1:06:36.900]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet
[1:06:36.900 --> 1:06:40.740]  And they whisper the word revolution
[1:06:42.820 --> 1:06:46.900]  There are men coming down from the valleys
[1:06:48.580 --> 1:06:52.180]  There are tall ships flying off the coast
[1:06:54.260 --> 1:07:02.100]  And they carry the light in the dark of the night like a whisper in the wind
[1:07:02.100 --> 1:07:04.100]  Revolution
[1:07:05.700 --> 1:07:09.700]  Bring my gun and a hand for the silver
[1:07:11.540 --> 1:07:15.060]  By the sea we will gather for the fight
[1:07:17.380 --> 1:07:28.100]  It's been so many years so many tears we have lost once before now we'll sell the store
[1:07:28.100 --> 1:07:36.100]  When our cannons will roar, revolution
[1:07:36.100 --> 1:07:46.100]  Yeah
[1:07:52.660 --> 1:07:56.100]  Watch and wait, get ready for the sign
[1:07:56.100 --> 1:08:00.020]  There are many here among us now who have not seen the light
[1:08:00.020 --> 1:08:10.020]  We must send the word to all the people in the land go to every hill and mountain for the time is not hand to light a fire
[1:08:12.820 --> 1:08:16.420]  Lighting fires in the minds of men and women everywhere
[1:08:17.860 --> 1:08:23.460]  Lighting the fires that have already engulfed the globalist on every continent
[1:08:23.460 --> 1:08:31.460]  The life force is now being initiated, the resistance to the enemy has now begun
[1:08:33.460 --> 1:08:37.460]  There's nothing they can do except for a longer destruction
[1:08:43.460 --> 1:08:51.460]  Light of fire, we have lit the fire and people came from all over the world to find what lit that fire
[1:08:51.460 --> 1:08:55.460]  Some have come to steal the fire and to hide the fire
[1:08:55.460 --> 1:09:03.460]  We have come to release the fire, the Promethean fire, the fire give them to us by our creator
[1:09:03.460 --> 1:09:11.460]  The fire we must use against the enemy or be destroyed and our children enslaved, never
[1:09:11.460 --> 1:09:19.460]  They planted their synchronic flag on our children and called us, hoping they're going to have their way with them
[1:09:19.460 --> 1:09:23.460]  They have only summoned their destruction and they know it
[1:09:23.460 --> 1:09:27.460]  They are prepared for hell and the abyss
[1:09:29.460 --> 1:09:31.460]  They will take it
[1:09:31.460 --> 1:09:33.460]  But God will direct it
[1:09:33.460 --> 1:09:41.460]  And all these great men that serve evil will be torn down and will beg for redemption in the end
[1:09:41.460 --> 1:09:45.460]  But it will fall on deaf ears
[1:09:45.460 --> 1:09:49.460]  Pretty good your phone calls and I'm going to cut back now on the ranting I said
[1:09:49.460 --> 1:09:55.460]  But I haven't done that quite yet here on this final transmission of 2019
[1:09:55.460 --> 1:10:03.460]  Let's go right now to a liberal in New York that disagrees, liberal
[1:10:03.460 --> 1:10:05.460]  You're on the air, welcome
[1:10:05.460 --> 1:10:09.460]  Hey afternoon Alex, this is liberal from New York
[1:10:09.460 --> 1:10:15.460]  It was once upon a time Alex when you were totally anti-war, I listened to you for years and years and years
[1:10:15.460 --> 1:10:21.460]  But in the past two occurrences, the one where the US port was attacked in the streets of Hormuz
[1:10:21.460 --> 1:10:29.460]  And now this embassy attack, you have taken a default position which is one of striking Iran
[1:10:29.460 --> 1:10:35.460]  Now I think this makes absolutely no sense, this is an alignment with what the globalists want
[1:10:35.460 --> 1:10:43.460]  Two, in addition to all of this, you keep pushing or positing the fact that Trump is an anti-war president
[1:10:43.460 --> 1:10:47.460]  He just re-signed the National Defense Authorization Act
[1:10:47.460 --> 1:10:53.460]  In addition to the patriot act, this guy is nothing but a war president
[1:10:53.460 --> 1:11:03.460]  When will you come to grips, tell your audience this and have them really push him to really accelerate the removal of troops from these foreign countries
[1:11:03.460 --> 1:11:05.460]  When Alex?
[1:11:05.460 --> 1:11:11.460]  Well, rarely does somebody call in the disagrees that actually raise a serious point and this is a serious point
[1:11:11.460 --> 1:11:15.460]  People say, why do you have an armored vehicle? That's a police state
[1:11:15.460 --> 1:11:22.460]  No, police state is not having due process and a surveillance state that's been used against Trump and all the rest of it
[1:11:22.460 --> 1:11:30.460]  An armored vehicle is a tool of defense and it also grabs all the attention and it's something different so that we can get our message out
[1:11:30.460 --> 1:11:36.460]  When they've been trying to shut us down and silence us and the left has mobs that attack people, it's defensive
[1:11:36.460 --> 1:11:41.460]  So a shield is not a weapon of war, it is a weapon of defense
[1:11:41.460 --> 1:11:46.460]  Now, let's go to your point about Trump. He's legitimately cutting the troops back in Afghanistan
[1:11:46.460 --> 1:11:52.460]  He's legitimately pulling almost all the troops out and bucking the Pentagon and others in what's happening in Syria
[1:11:52.460 --> 1:11:57.460]  He's trying to end the Arab Spring, launch by the deep state to destabilize the Middle East, North Africa
[1:11:57.460 --> 1:12:04.460]  And that whole project launched by Kerry, Obama, and Hilary to kill Qaddafi and all those serious war crimes and Benghazi and the rest of it
[1:12:04.460 --> 1:12:11.460]  Iran, on its own, is expansionist with its form of Islam, Shia, as you know
[1:12:11.460 --> 1:12:18.460]  And you've got Saudi Arabia that's been expansionist and Trump has gone in and said, any more funny stuff from Saudi Arabia, we're going to remove you
[1:12:18.460 --> 1:12:27.460]  And the House of Saud has saluted and from what I've seen backed off their al-Qaeda and ISIS operations
[1:12:27.460 --> 1:12:30.460]  And the al-Qaeda ISIS arm has been arrested
[1:12:30.460 --> 1:12:39.460]  Now, we'll see how long that stays. Trump has a stabilization program, not the globalist program of destabilization program
[1:12:39.460 --> 1:12:42.460]  Or the strategy of tension and all the rest of it
[1:12:42.460 --> 1:12:50.460]  Now, we'll see how that goes, but the strategy of patience with North Korea, the strategy of patience with radical Islam expanding, that's over
[1:12:50.460 --> 1:12:56.460]  Because the globalists are allied with it to put the worst forms of Islam in, to destroy borders with Europe, to flood Europe
[1:12:56.460 --> 1:13:02.460]  Trump's going to make deals with Turkey to stop the flooding. I mean, he's really doing a stabilization program that's very pragmatic
[1:13:02.460 --> 1:13:09.460]  And what I would be doing from my own research of geopolitical systems, which obviously aren't perfect, nothing is
[1:13:09.460 --> 1:13:12.460]  The world is fluid for all people
[1:13:12.460 --> 1:13:17.460]  And so, when an embassy gets attacked, that's not for war
[1:13:17.460 --> 1:13:21.460]  When you have an agreement, you pay for it, it's your base
[1:13:21.460 --> 1:13:26.460]  And then it gets attacked by a bunch of militia, trying to kill people and burning things down
[1:13:26.460 --> 1:13:33.460]  To put up with that will allow US hostages to be taken, and then Trump will look weak, and it'll be used by him and the deep state
[1:13:33.460 --> 1:13:40.460]  That's why Tehran made a move, the deep state is telling Iran not to work with Trump that he'll be gone soon, they've been giving him inside intel
[1:13:40.460 --> 1:13:43.460]  On how to block Trump, how to get Trump into an escalation or a trap
[1:13:43.460 --> 1:13:47.460]  Trump's done a great job not taking the bait, and I don't want war with Iran
[1:13:47.460 --> 1:13:54.460]  I said, when Iran is in Iraq trying to take over, trying to cause another civil war, we need to try to stop it
[1:13:54.460 --> 1:14:00.460]  Or Trump needs to have a televised rest of the nation say we're totally pulling out and let everybody kill each other over there
[1:14:00.460 --> 1:14:08.460]  But he's going for the middle road of just stabilizing with limited casualties, and then trying to pull us out as much as we can to face the real issue of the Chai comms
[1:14:08.460 --> 1:14:17.460]  And so to say that if, listen, you come to my house, you're trying to batter the door down and burn my house down, I'm going to shoot you dead in the hammer, I don't mean you but whoever's doing it
[1:14:17.460 --> 1:14:25.460]  You're going to see a shotgun, I'm going to say back off, you keep trying to burn my house down or break into it, I'm going to pull the trigger into your chest, or anybody else that doesn't
[1:14:25.460 --> 1:14:31.460]  I think you do the same to me, so that's not war, that's called defense, and so that's what I said
[1:14:31.460 --> 1:14:40.460]  Okay, and Alex, I understand all of that, but my question is, and I'm looking at this from the perspective of September 11, September 11 took place
[1:14:40.460 --> 1:14:51.460]  George Bush and they illegally invaded Iraq, invaded Afghanistan, they haven't pulled the troops out, you see a continuation, and what happens when-
[1:14:51.460 --> 1:14:56.460]  You see the Pentagon releasing documents admitting the whole thing was a fraud, that's Trump, go ahead
[1:14:56.460 --> 1:15:13.460]  So hold on, an empire in decline, what happens with their military? They are usually shipped overseas fighting on ending wars, totally broken, destroyed, they leave the homeland unattended, and this is what we are seeing here
[1:15:13.460 --> 1:15:17.460]  The United States is being used as a muscle of the globalist
[1:15:17.460 --> 1:15:18.460]  I agree
[1:15:18.460 --> 1:15:27.460]  The army is being destroyed and Trump has not started pulling the troops, instead what has he done? He has signed the National Defense Authority
[1:15:27.460 --> 1:15:33.460]  Stay there, let's come back, you're making great points, wow, a person that disagrees, who's smart, actually, we agree
[1:15:33.460 --> 1:15:49.460]  Yeah, I think he's oversimplifying what I've said, but let's talk about this with liberal, and then we're going to go to Luke and everybody else that's patiently holding on this final live transmission of the Alex Jones show, 2019
[1:15:49.460 --> 1:16:04.460]  Our destroyer is coming up after we're done today with The War Room, I was co-host or putting him in prison
[1:16:19.460 --> 1:16:33.460]  Use to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets, not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month
[1:16:33.460 --> 1:16:46.460]  Don't miss this one, stake your claim today, call 800-600-3388, that's 800-600-3388, these valuable lease contracts won't last long, call now 800-600-3388

[1:16:49.460 --> 1:16:55.460]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners, consult with financial professionals before purchasing, not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document
[1:16:55.460 --> 1:17:03.460]  I'm here with Scott Yousiam, founder of OMG Tax, tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS
[1:17:03.460 --> 1:17:15.460]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnish funds, sometimes in the same day, we even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise
[1:17:15.460 --> 1:17:17.460]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[1:17:17.460 --> 1:17:30.460]  Oh, can I ever? We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS, guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government
[1:17:30.460 --> 1:17:40.460]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax saving consultation
[1:17:40.460 --> 1:17:56.460]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112-800-486-8112, that's 800-486-8112
[1:17:56.460 --> 1:18:12.460]  It was about three and a half months ago and I said on air, I'm going to religiously take my supplements. I'd always taken them in the past, but I forget like everybody else to stay on the regimen. Well, I've done it and I've lost 39 pounds in less than four months and my life is so amazing
[1:18:12.460 --> 1:18:29.460]  And I still have cake and ice cream and pie just like I did before. I'm exercising the same amount, but my body has the trace elements and the key things it needs like the clean iodine and X2 and X3 and I take a good energy booster like turbo force and brain force for my brain
[1:18:29.460 --> 1:18:37.460]  And I take the fish oil and I take the turmeric and I take the knockout and I use the good toothpaste fluoride free that's got the tea tree oil and so much more at infowarslife.com
[1:18:37.460 --> 1:18:49.460]  2020 is dawning, we have big sales, total clearance right now, no excuse for you to go to the store and get these great products and experience them for yourself and fund the info war, a total 360 win going into 2020
[1:18:49.460 --> 1:19:10.460]  That's why it's more important than ever to keep in force on the air and only you can do that by getting great products at infowarslife.com
[1:19:10.460 --> 1:19:24.460]  I use the super blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into your gums. It is by far the best product I've ever used in my life. I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now.
[1:19:24.460 --> 1:19:33.460]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and the back surgery and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life. So I just want to get that out of the way.
[1:19:33.460 --> 1:19:44.460]  Support this man, everything that he exposed, nobody knew about Bohemian Grove, nobody knew about Epstein, nobody knew about Bilderberg, nobody called 9-11 before it happened. In July 2001, go look it up yourself.
[1:19:44.460 --> 1:20:07.460]  Well, we try our best, sir. They definitely want us off the air without you or not here, but yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[1:20:07.460 --> 1:20:17.460]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:17.460 --> 1:20:23.460]  You know, I read Zbigniew Brzezinski's grand chess board back when he came out with it, I think in 1998.
[1:20:23.460 --> 1:20:44.460]  And I've read more CFR white papers than I'd like to admit. Boy, it's time I'll never get back. It's all just a bunch of decline of the West, give China the whole world, lay out a red carpet, pay for it all.
[1:20:44.460 --> 1:20:54.460]  Every deal one-sided, no taxes for the Chai comms, everything for Europeans in the U.S., no coal for us, everything for China.
[1:20:54.460 --> 1:21:01.460]  You don't just think China got 98% of rare earth mineral control in the last 30 years by accident.
[1:21:01.460 --> 1:21:17.460]  Western governments don't let their companies or people extract minerals. The last lead smelting plant in the U.S. closed five years ago.
[1:21:17.460 --> 1:21:24.460]  They have thousands in China. It has nothing to do with toxin. It has to do with not being able to operate.
[1:21:24.460 --> 1:21:32.460]  China as a national policy has no controls. Their rivers set on fire. They dump almost all the trash in the ocean.
[1:21:32.460 --> 1:21:39.460]  But we're told that we can't have plastic in America because it's our fault it's in the ocean when the Chai comms dump theirs in the ocean.
[1:21:39.460 --> 1:21:43.460]  Most of ours gets recycled. It's all hoaxes.
[1:21:43.460 --> 1:21:56.460]  But if we can't have plastic and we're a world exporter, leading exporter of it, we will be hamstrung. It's all military attacks.
[1:21:56.460 --> 1:22:01.460]  So I'm against the globalists launching all these wars.
[1:22:01.460 --> 1:22:06.460]  Trump is pragmatically trying to get us out of them. What he's doing in the military industrial complex is, let's have innovation.
[1:22:06.460 --> 1:22:12.460]  Let's have space force that's already there. Let's advance these technologies. Let's roll out the hidden stuff.
[1:22:12.460 --> 1:22:16.460]  Let's have total dominance where nobody can even challenge us.
[1:22:16.460 --> 1:22:19.460]  But let's not have our troops being fed into meat grinders.
[1:22:19.460 --> 1:22:27.460]  Trump's been very clear about where he stands and how is the deep state going to say no to that when they're making record money?
[1:22:27.460 --> 1:22:30.460]  Well, they still are. Goldman Sachs has made the biggest amount of money it's ever made.
[1:22:30.460 --> 1:22:39.460]  It's openly trying to stop Trump and giving all its money to the Democrats. Nothing to Trump. They really hate him because he isn't part of their club.
[1:22:39.460 --> 1:22:45.460]  And he's pragmatically making the decisions and they cannot stand it because normally these big boards get together.
[1:22:45.460 --> 1:22:56.460]  They make decisions and those boards go to other boards. They make decisions. They tweak it. They create consensus and the consensus is move everything to China.
[1:22:56.460 --> 1:23:06.460]  Use that as economic warfare so that it's the new global dominant empire and the UN adopts its system of internet censorship and social control.
[1:23:06.460 --> 1:23:16.460]  And it's all official now. And so I agree with the caller that we're seeing this meant to sap us as here's a microcosm.
[1:23:16.460 --> 1:23:27.460]  It costs us over $100 billion a year to be in Afghanistan. China extracts something over $500 billion worth of rare as minerals alone in the last 20 years out of Afghanistan.
[1:23:27.460 --> 1:23:34.460]  They pay nothing militarily for security. We pay for their security and then we don't get the minerals.
[1:23:34.460 --> 1:23:41.460]  It looks like we don't get the oil out of Iraq. China and Japan get that. Those are all globalist deals.
[1:23:41.460 --> 1:23:50.460]  And Trump says screw your deals. And I don't want that oil. I don't want to make them give us the rare as minerals.
[1:23:50.460 --> 1:23:57.460]  I want them to beg us to come in and provide security and then our companies get it because everything's taxpayer subsidized the end.
[1:23:57.460 --> 1:24:04.460]  We're just with chronic capitalism. We're just propping up the communist dictatorship of China and letting them break all the rules.
[1:24:04.460 --> 1:24:26.460]  And then we get deindustrialization and then they ship enough fentanyl to kill the whole planet here every year because our so-called elites hate our existence because we're Christian.
[1:24:26.460 --> 1:24:33.460]  We're not a Christian nation anymore, but it could spring up again. They want that beaten. And that's why all this is happening.
[1:24:33.460 --> 1:24:40.460]  So I said I'd take calls and tell these reports, but the caller brings up a really big point. So go ahead and finish your point liberal in New York.
[1:24:40.460 --> 1:24:49.460]  So Alex, I woke up this morning thinking about what the war on terror has created for the world and how it has impacted the United States specifically.
[1:24:49.460 --> 1:24:59.460]  So on one hand, when you speak about Europe and the invasion of all these people from the Middle East into Europe, that was caused by the war.
[1:24:59.460 --> 1:25:11.460]  Yeah, that was the plan. That was the plan. Exactly. But in addition to that, you speak, you say you talk about the culture of the United States that has drastically changed since 9 11.
[1:25:11.460 --> 1:25:20.460]  We no longer have our civil liberties. And this is what I'm speaking about with regards to Trump. Why is it that he is renewing the Patriot Act?
[1:25:20.460 --> 1:25:33.460]  If we are supposedly going back to being great again, where we revere the Constitution and our freedoms of speech and things of that nature, why is it that he's reenacting these bills?
[1:25:33.460 --> 1:25:35.460]  Can you explain that to me?
[1:25:35.460 --> 1:25:42.460]  I totally agree with you. Let me finish this piece of chicken that I'm letting you talk, which I've learned to make myself be quiet.
[1:25:42.460 --> 1:25:46.460]  I should eat while you talk, so I want to interrupt. Finish your point and I'll answer that.
[1:25:46.460 --> 1:25:54.460]  Well, that's just it. When it comes to wars, there are so many different expedients when you have a war.
[1:25:54.460 --> 1:26:01.460]  And one of it is to mainly change the culture, not of the place that you've invaded, but the place that's doing the invasion.
[1:26:01.460 --> 1:26:07.460]  So people in North America, in the United States, they believe that they had this Constitution.
[1:26:07.460 --> 1:26:12.460]  They were walled around by this Constitution, but that has been eroded because...
[1:26:12.460 --> 1:26:14.460]  Sir, you know what? Listen, you've done your research.
[1:26:14.460 --> 1:26:24.460]  You've classified that the left and the big foundations through the CIA launched Vietnam on purpose, lost it on purpose to create the fake counterculture movement.
[1:26:24.460 --> 1:26:31.460]  That's now the authoritarians running the country. The CIA put the LSD out, all the drugs, absolutely.
[1:26:31.460 --> 1:26:35.460]  And now you see the aftermath of that are demoralized nation later.
[1:26:35.460 --> 1:26:45.460]  So I agree with you, and here's Trump, who they use the Patriot Act and the Defense Authorization Act on as a candidate and then as president.
[1:26:45.460 --> 1:26:55.460]  And then here he is reauthorizing it. That is a absolutely very fair point, and you see the FISA court now saying they may not even work with the FBI anymore.
[1:26:55.460 --> 1:27:01.460]  But we're seeing the total surveillance, and now it's out of the closet. It's out in the open. It's the elephant in the room.
[1:27:01.460 --> 1:27:03.460]  And the big question is, what are we going to do about it? Very, very well said.
[1:27:03.460 --> 1:27:07.460]  So let me, in closing, what does Trump need to do? What do we need to do?
[1:27:07.460 --> 1:27:11.460]  Because you're the boss. You're the boss. You're the boss liberal, and you're not really a liberal.
[1:27:11.460 --> 1:27:16.460]  I wouldn't call you that, but that's a smart name, but let's go to you. You've done your research. What does Trump need to do in 30 seconds?
[1:27:16.460 --> 1:27:18.460]  What do we need to do?
[1:27:18.460 --> 1:27:24.460]  Trump needs to get, well, as you said, create this fireside chat or whatever.
[1:27:24.460 --> 1:27:29.460]  Explain to the country that these illegal wars that we are pulling these troops out now.
[1:27:29.460 --> 1:27:34.460]  You have given them cover with respect to the actions of his support, and it's not listening to them.
[1:27:34.460 --> 1:27:45.460]  If that is the case, Alex, you fire all of them. You pull the troops out. You reassign or reallocate the monies that you've assigned to go overseas
[1:27:45.460 --> 1:27:51.460]  to rebuild and infrastructure in the United States, create job programs. This is what people need.
[1:27:51.460 --> 1:27:58.460]  I totally agree. I totally agree with you. And look, he said take Brennan's security clearance. They didn't do it.
[1:27:58.460 --> 1:28:05.460]  He said leave Afghanistan. They didn't do it. I mean, the truth is he surrounded it. And I'm not saying that it's not his fault,
[1:28:05.460 --> 1:28:09.460]  but how does he stop it? What does he do when he's surrounded?
[1:28:09.460 --> 1:28:16.460]  So Alex, here's what. When Obama was in power and everything illegal that was done under him was assigned to him.
[1:28:16.460 --> 1:28:23.460]  It's the same with Trump. It's the same respect. Everything done illegally under him will be assigned to him.
[1:28:23.460 --> 1:28:28.460]  He has to take the reins. No, Alex. Not in 2020 after the election.
[1:28:28.460 --> 1:28:33.460]  No, no, I agree with you. Gut level, you think Trump's for real?
[1:28:33.460 --> 1:28:42.460]  Gut level. No, Alex. I think that he's just a part of the tyranny still going on, if I'm seen from administration.
[1:28:42.460 --> 1:28:47.460]  Hey, liberal, great points. Great points. In fact, get his number and info. I'd like to have him be part of the new show.
[1:28:47.460 --> 1:28:51.460]  We're going to be doing more calls straight ahead. I promise we'll get to all the news. I said I would. I'm going to your calls.
[1:28:51.460 --> 1:28:54.460]  I'm going to your calls. They're powerful, powerful listeners.
[1:29:21.460 --> 1:29:25.460]  That's black rifle real estate dot com.
[1:29:52.460 --> 1:29:58.460]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup.
[1:29:58.460 --> 1:30:05.460]  A second cup of the day. It's really strong. I shouldn't do this because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive boy.
[1:30:05.460 --> 1:30:10.460]  The coffee has to wake up America coffee there by loves highest rated in the Chiapas Mountains.
[1:30:10.460 --> 1:30:13.460]  It's beyond Mexican coffee beyond Guatemala coffee. It's the best coffee in the world.
[1:30:13.460 --> 1:30:16.460]  It's right on the border between the two countries in those rainforests.
[1:30:16.460 --> 1:30:21.460]  It's hand selected. It's beyond organic. Wildcrafted. Wake up America coffee. People are blown away by how good it is.
[1:30:21.460 --> 1:30:25.460]  Same stuff sold in Whole Foods under another name for $30 for the same size container.
[1:30:25.460 --> 1:30:28.460]  Yes, folks, we've been selling it 10 years. Never raised the price.
[1:30:28.460 --> 1:30:35.460]  $19.95 is that big old bag. 99% reviews, 598 reviews, 4.9 stars on third party sites.

[1:30:43.460 --> 1:30:51.460]  15 days, nine months. Patriot blend medium roast only has a 98% out of 814 reviews.
[1:30:51.460 --> 1:30:53.460]  It's not as popular.
[1:30:53.460 --> 1:30:56.460]  Anyways, it's all at infowarsstore.com.
[1:30:56.460 --> 1:31:00.460]  You want to break some globalist ribs. You want to crush some skulls politically.
[1:31:00.460 --> 1:31:03.460]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually.
[1:31:03.460 --> 1:31:08.460]  There's nowhere you can spend money. There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[1:31:08.460 --> 1:31:12.460]  In a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[1:31:12.460 --> 1:31:17.460]  Your bang for your buck, fear, gets you great products at great prices
[1:31:17.460 --> 1:31:23.460]  that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[1:31:23.460 --> 1:31:29.460]  And so it's very simple. If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy,
[1:31:29.460 --> 1:31:32.460]  which God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort.
[1:31:32.460 --> 1:31:34.460]  110% God will finish the move.
[1:31:34.460 --> 1:31:38.460]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[1:31:38.460 --> 1:31:42.460]  I want to attack. I want to go after the globalist. And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:31:42.460 --> 1:31:46.460]  that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together,
[1:31:46.460 --> 1:31:48.460]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[1:31:48.460 --> 1:31:53.460]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family.
[1:31:53.460 --> 1:31:56.460]  Because we're in this together, infowarsstore.com.
[1:31:58.460 --> 1:32:01.460]  A little less than four months ago, I made the announcement on air.
[1:32:01.460 --> 1:32:07.460]  I said, hey, I have a tendency to take the high quality supplements from FoursLife for a while
[1:32:07.460 --> 1:32:11.460]  and get great results. And then slowly I stop using them.
[1:32:11.460 --> 1:32:13.460]  I forget to religiously take them.
[1:32:13.460 --> 1:32:17.460]  I'm going to religiously take the supplements for the next few months.
[1:32:17.460 --> 1:32:21.460]  And I've lost almost 40 pounds now. Everybody can see it on air.
[1:32:21.460 --> 1:32:25.460]  My energy is off the charts. Everything is amazing.
[1:32:25.460 --> 1:32:29.460]  And it's because I am taking the InfowarsLife products, the Krill Oil.
[1:32:29.460 --> 1:32:34.460]  I'm taking the X2 and the X3. I'm taking the Brain Force Plus.
[1:32:34.460 --> 1:32:38.460]  When I work out, when I have to work really late, I'm taking half a pack of Turbo Force.
[1:32:38.460 --> 1:32:44.460]  It is clean energy. It is really making my whole life so much more enjoyable.
[1:32:44.460 --> 1:32:47.460]  It's making the shows more focused. I've got more energy.
[1:32:47.460 --> 1:32:51.460]  We have huge sales going right now for the new year at InfowarsLife.com.
[1:32:51.460 --> 1:33:06.460]  A big clearance sale. Take advantage of it all at InfowarsLife.com.
[1:33:21.460 --> 1:33:37.460]  You can face it. You can hear it. You can hear it. You want to make it.
[1:33:37.460 --> 1:33:42.460]  Two competing transmissions. Two different messages.
[1:33:42.460 --> 1:33:46.460]  Now scientifically proven to be transmitting.
[1:33:46.460 --> 1:33:51.460]  It's not just transmissions that guide the ducks and the butterflies
[1:33:51.460 --> 1:33:55.460]  and the hummingbirds from Canada down to South America.
[1:33:55.460 --> 1:34:01.460]  It's not just magnetic because the spectrum is so much bigger.
[1:34:01.460 --> 1:34:07.460]  But there's free will in the universe. And you either belong to Satan or you belong to God.
[1:34:07.460 --> 1:34:12.460]  And Satan will trick you and lie to you. God will just be straight up front.
[1:34:12.460 --> 1:34:17.460]  But I get it. A lot of people are scared of God.
[1:34:17.460 --> 1:34:25.460]  I'm scared. It's pretty awesome when you know God's and see everything.
[1:34:25.460 --> 1:34:29.460]  Looks right through your cells, right down to the tiny atoms.
[1:34:29.460 --> 1:34:35.460]  It's not like that with the devil, is it? Because the devil is not omnipresent.
[1:34:35.460 --> 1:34:43.460]  The devil's old. The devil was created, given free will and rebelled.
[1:34:43.460 --> 1:34:49.460]  But not the same species. Not the same as us. Not as powerful as us.
[1:34:49.460 --> 1:34:56.460]  But an 80-year-old man might not be able to get out of bed,
[1:34:56.460 --> 1:35:02.460]  but he's stronger than an embryo who doesn't even know who it is yet.
[1:35:02.460 --> 1:35:11.460]  And that's all this is. As above so below.
[1:35:11.460 --> 1:35:15.460]  You've got the globalists to keep the secrets that they've learned from the people
[1:35:15.460 --> 1:35:20.460]  and use the public's ignorance against them. And then call themselves gods.
[1:35:20.460 --> 1:35:25.460]  You really think Ray Kurzweil says, I'll just step on the public like a bug once I'm an AI God.
[1:35:25.460 --> 1:35:33.460]  That's not like an AI God to you, like a God. Like, oh, I'll step on everybody once I'm a God.
[1:35:33.460 --> 1:35:43.460]  Sounds like a crazy control freak idiot who's a loser.
[1:35:43.460 --> 1:35:49.460]  So somebody like that ever experienced real power or even the ability to envision real power.
[1:35:49.460 --> 1:35:54.460]  They would be humbled in the presence of the real power of God.
[1:35:54.460 --> 1:35:59.460]  But instead, he doesn't believe in God. He says he will be a God.
[1:35:59.460 --> 1:36:07.460]  But only once we've overwritten the planet and merged with a plan he has, it's a plan.
[1:36:07.460 --> 1:36:10.460]  He thinks he came up with it. He used to kill everybody.
[1:36:10.460 --> 1:36:14.460]  And once we've killed everybody and gotten rid of the scourge of humans, why he'll be a God?
[1:36:14.460 --> 1:36:18.460]  He just had this idea himself. He doesn't know where it came from.
[1:36:18.460 --> 1:36:24.460]  You really believe that? All these people are going, oh, I'm an environmentalist.
[1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:27.460]  Humans are bad. We've got to replace them as soon as possible.
[1:36:27.460 --> 1:36:36.460]  NBC News, Wired Magazine, AP, Reuters, New York Times, your schoolchildren are being taught this.
[1:36:36.460 --> 1:36:39.460]  As they make this world ugly and then offer you some new world that's going to be better.
[1:36:39.460 --> 1:36:47.460]  But of course, you know it's not. Everything they give us only makes us stupider, more alone, more ugly, more depressed.
[1:36:47.460 --> 1:36:53.460]  Well then, why does anybody go with this plan? Because they're never shown the alternative.
[1:36:53.460 --> 1:37:08.460]  And that's what the artificial cities and the smart systems and the Times Square matrixes are for, is to keep you within their projection.
[1:37:08.460 --> 1:37:13.460]  And Times Square projects up forests. It's not real forests. It's the image of the forest.
[1:37:13.460 --> 1:37:23.460]  It doesn't have the wavelength, the spirit of the forest. It doesn't have the energy of the forest resonating with the space time continuum.
[1:37:23.460 --> 1:37:28.460]  A huge pipe organ which God plays.
[1:37:28.460 --> 1:37:36.460]  Does it know anything about the symphony?
[1:37:36.460 --> 1:37:41.460]  We're going to your phone calls. I am doing a good job taking the calls. I think these are excellent callers.
[1:37:41.460 --> 1:37:44.460]  But I can't do 10, 15 minutes with these callers no matter how good you are.
[1:37:44.460 --> 1:37:50.460]  These are incredible callers. I'm sure you're just as good, but we got to only get people a minute or two and we'll never get to everybody.
[1:37:50.460 --> 1:37:58.460]  And I'm doing all four hours today. Mike Adams is on tomorrow.
[1:37:58.460 --> 1:38:04.460]  He's got huge snows.
[1:38:04.460 --> 1:38:10.460]  But I do want to just have this effort thought because I tend to get busy and then not focus on it.
[1:38:10.460 --> 1:38:22.460]  If you'll simply buy the products in forest store.com, we will then have the symbols of energy, the money to have the reporters and have the crew and come up with the information and come up with the resistance that's proven.
[1:38:22.460 --> 1:38:29.460]  We've got lightning in a bottle. You've got lightning in a bottle. The callers calling in the Intel, the ideas, the interfacing.
[1:38:29.460 --> 1:38:36.460]  We're not getting it from CFR Globalist Central Party Committee boardrooms. We're getting it from you.
[1:38:36.460 --> 1:38:45.460]  Correct. That's real power. Humans interfacing, two together on earth, making it so God makes it so in heaven.
[1:38:45.460 --> 1:38:50.460]  This is the real magic right here. What we built, what you built.
[1:38:50.460 --> 1:38:57.460]  So I'm going to tell you, don't do yourself a favor. Do yourself an essential.
[1:38:57.460 --> 1:39:03.460]  Commit to spend a portion of the money you're going to spend at these big box stores with InfoWars.
[1:39:03.460 --> 1:39:12.460]  And again, you don't just have a commitment. You have a proven timeline of the fact that I am savagely committed to taking on the globalist.
[1:39:12.460 --> 1:39:23.460]  I am obsessed. I am driven. I am beyond committed. I am totally turned over to fight these people.
[1:39:23.460 --> 1:39:30.460]  There's no discussion. There's no debate. There's no hesitation. There's no nothing except wishing I had more energy and more will.
[1:39:30.460 --> 1:39:34.460]  And God's been providing it. And let me tell you, it's spectacular.
[1:39:34.460 --> 1:39:39.460]  These stupid Satanists and people have no idea what God's got in store for people that can handle knowledge and strength.
[1:39:39.460 --> 1:39:45.460]  But now my discernment is just, it's amazing. I can't even decipher most of it or understand it.
[1:39:45.460 --> 1:39:48.460]  It's next level, but I'm starting to figure it out.
[1:39:48.460 --> 1:39:56.460]  But I literally, like Neo, can see the matrix now. And the enemy can't even see it. It just knows it's there.
[1:39:56.460 --> 1:40:06.460]  And ladies and gentlemen, when this wall gets pulled off our eyes, because humans at this level can't handle it, the ear is not heard, the eye is not seen.
[1:40:06.460 --> 1:40:14.460]  Now, when you get, I'm not going to tell an hour on this, but I got to find ourselves.
[1:40:14.460 --> 1:40:22.460]  My wife has hip pain because she's played tennis for 25, 30 years. She's a good tennis player.
[1:40:22.460 --> 1:40:28.460]  And from hopping around her, her right hip hurts. And she's going to have surgery.
[1:40:28.460 --> 1:40:33.460]  And I said, listen, take bodies, my tumor for me. She says, listen, I got to take seven of the whole foods tumor.
[1:40:33.460 --> 1:40:37.460]  And it does give me some relief. Advil doesn't work anymore. Pain pills. I don't like them.
[1:40:37.460 --> 1:40:43.460]  And I said, look, just take this. And she looks at it. She goes, well, this isn't even as strong as this whole foods tumor.
[1:40:43.460 --> 1:40:50.460]  It was these big solid tablets. And I said, honey, the way the government, the FDA works is you just, if it's an extract and a concentrate, you just call it tumor.
[1:40:50.460 --> 1:40:57.460]  This is a 95% curcuminoid. I said most brands are three to 5%. The top brands are 75%.
[1:40:57.460 --> 1:41:02.460]  And that's only a few companies do that. We went to one of the top producers and said, I want the strongest one on the market.
[1:41:02.460 --> 1:41:07.460]  We believe this is the strongest on the market. 95% curcuminoid.
[1:41:07.460 --> 1:41:17.460]  She takes two of these and gets the effect that seven horse pills give her of the brand that cost as much as whole foods, the top of the line.
[1:41:17.460 --> 1:41:22.460]  I mean, these are horse pills she was taking. These pills are half the size. They're still big.
[1:41:22.460 --> 1:41:27.460]  So that's just one of the things in there. There's a bunch of other ingredients that supercharge it.
[1:41:27.460 --> 1:41:33.460]  That's an example of these products. End of year sale, 75% off.
[1:41:33.460 --> 1:41:38.460]  Up to 75% off plus free shipping.
[1:41:38.460 --> 1:41:45.460]  Double Patriot points. And look, I won't be able to offer deals where it's always stuff's always on sale next year.
[1:41:45.460 --> 1:41:50.460]  Because we've been selling out of inventory, able to fund ourselves, and then we're going to not be able to.
[1:41:50.460 --> 1:41:53.460]  I mean, our biggest sales will be 40% in the future.
[1:41:53.460 --> 1:41:59.460]  Because we don't have a bunch of extra markup in these products, and I'm not going to dumb down the quality of them to have more markup.
[1:41:59.460 --> 1:42:08.460]  I'm not doing that. And so the tooth whitening toothpaste, the others are gels, tea tree oil,
[1:42:08.460 --> 1:42:15.460]  cloyal silver, iodide, no fluoride. People love it. It's concentrated. It doesn't have fillers. A lot of folks love it. It's got like a 99% review rate.
[1:42:15.460 --> 1:42:18.460]  I like it a lot. It works really good.
[1:42:18.460 --> 1:42:26.460]  This whitening gel that also remineralizes the teeth has the silver, the nano silver patented.
[1:42:26.460 --> 1:42:32.460]  And it's just people are completely blown away. It's got 100% reviews right now. Get it.

[1:43:01.460 --> 1:43:05.460]  I'd always taken them in the past, but I forget like everybody else to stay on the regiment.

[1:43:28.460 --> 1:43:33.460]  And I take the fish oil and I take the turmeric and I take the knockout and I use the good toothpaste.

[1:47:19.460 --> 1:47:27.460]  You won't break me you won't make me because I'll fight you under blood red skies.
[1:47:27.460 --> 1:47:44.460]  Listen a little bit of this from one of your calls as we begin to enter 2020 the year of the awakening.
[1:47:44.460 --> 1:47:50.460]  Look at this article right here.
[1:47:50.460 --> 1:47:55.460]  Kerry admits to meeting Iranian officials over nuclear deal.
[1:47:55.460 --> 1:48:00.460]  They are behind the scenes working with Iran.
[1:48:00.460 --> 1:48:14.460]  That's why I'm telling them we need a strong hand now.
[1:48:14.460 --> 1:48:24.460]  You won't take me under blood red skies because we'll fight you.
[1:48:24.460 --> 1:48:32.460]  All right now I'm going to do it I'm not getting to the Iran news and the huge China news that are so critical and I'm totally prepared for that are massive.
[1:48:32.460 --> 1:48:37.460]  They're totally critical until I've taken at least the 15 calls that are on the board right now.
[1:48:37.460 --> 1:48:43.460]  That means Derek and Mike and Danny and Dave and Luke and Jason and Patriot and Gary and Eric.
[1:48:43.460 --> 1:48:46.460]  So who's been holding the longest right now and I'm going right to you.
[1:48:46.460 --> 1:48:53.460]  I guess that would be Eric in Washington you're on the air thank you for holding go ahead.
[1:48:53.460 --> 1:48:54.460]  Alex.
[1:48:54.460 --> 1:48:56.460]  Yes sir.
[1:48:56.460 --> 1:49:00.460]  Wow so long time listener.
[1:49:00.460 --> 1:49:02.460]  First time caller.
[1:49:02.460 --> 1:49:04.460]  Welcome sir thank you for holding.
[1:49:04.460 --> 1:49:07.460]  Oh yeah no problem so.
[1:49:07.460 --> 1:49:14.460]  Man you've done a lot you know for me in my life you know.
[1:49:14.460 --> 1:49:25.460]  You made a quote a long time ago not really a quote but you gave me an analogy and it stuck with me.
[1:49:25.460 --> 1:49:28.460]  Sorry I'm nervous man I haven't talked to me and I haven't.
[1:49:28.460 --> 1:49:35.460]  Well I'm nervous too there's a lot of stuff on the line right now brother.
[1:49:35.460 --> 1:49:40.460]  Everybody seems to be you know either awake or asleep.
[1:49:40.460 --> 1:49:44.460]  And it's detrimental right now you know what's going on.
[1:49:44.460 --> 1:49:54.460]  You made an analogy about chickens in a rooster's in a hen house how you know their ancestors.
[1:49:54.460 --> 1:50:04.460]  And what happened you know in their life stuck with them and when the farmers or whatever would show pictures of.
[1:50:04.460 --> 1:50:15.460]  You know a triangle or a circle or a square on you know the roof of the building they wouldn't you know they wouldn't react to it but.
[1:50:15.460 --> 1:50:30.460]  You show a picture of a hawk instinctually they know to run and guard themselves and defend themselves and you know everybody seems to be asleep right now or awake and I can't understand why.
[1:50:30.460 --> 1:50:39.460]  Because they show you art types you should fear so much on TV that then people see murders child molestation kidnapping.
[1:50:39.460 --> 1:50:48.460]  They get basically numb to it so when the real things going on they're not upset anymore because that wasn't really an analogy.
[1:50:48.460 --> 1:50:55.460]  And I probably butchered it but I should do a whole report on it epigenetics and different ways of studying.
[1:50:55.460 --> 1:51:04.460]  Instincts and you know Carl Jung's views on it I think are very very accurate in that why he was obsessed with doing rituals when he was a little kid and didn't know where they came from and.
[1:51:04.460 --> 1:51:11.460]  Then it turned out it was actually ancient Nordic stuff that his ancestors had done that was you know part of interfacing and part of understanding the universe.
[1:51:11.460 --> 1:51:21.460]  That then become as you notice later models of how they find out scientifically the universe really works because knowledge is imprinted on us at the cellular level.
[1:51:21.460 --> 1:51:32.460]  And just like you have compacted data with computers where they can send the encyclopedia Britannica on some of the size of an atom right now used to it would take you know a whole building to hold it.
[1:51:32.460 --> 1:51:43.460]  And it's just that exponential growth of knowledge well that's already on ourselves and so they've done generational studies with chickens indoors with a roof and a warehouse.
[1:51:43.460 --> 1:51:57.460]  You can look up these studies and you can have six seventh 20 generations of chickens that do it with chickens and rats and things just you can get the generations quickly and you know breed them quickly and see how long instincts follow.
[1:51:57.460 --> 1:51:59.460]  The instincts basically don't go away.
[1:51:59.460 --> 1:52:10.460]  So if you project on the roof that looks like a sky a triangle or a circle they don't run and you can play you know the calls of other prey birds they don't run.
[1:52:10.460 --> 1:52:14.460]  But you shoot up to say a red tail hawk.
[1:52:14.460 --> 1:52:23.460]  And it does it scream or whatever or without the screen they see that they run for the coups like bloody murder.
[1:52:23.460 --> 1:52:26.460]  Because I mean they know they've got to get in a hole in the wall.
[1:52:26.460 --> 1:52:28.460]  They got to get a hole in a tree.
[1:52:28.460 --> 1:52:30.460]  They had to get in the coop or they're dead.
[1:52:30.460 --> 1:52:33.460]  And so I'm just simply saying that's why children.
[1:52:33.460 --> 1:52:45.460]  Everyone has children especially at night fear going in or out of the door especially they've got good instincts like a two year old's not scared of you know all sorts of but all sudden at night by a door coming out of the door at night they're like I don't know the door.
[1:52:45.460 --> 1:52:47.460]  They get up close to you they look around the door.
[1:52:47.460 --> 1:52:54.460]  Well for all of our development where's the big cat going to be or something else or another bad human waiting at an entrance.
[1:52:54.460 --> 1:52:57.460]  That's where you wait for a meal like a little fish coming out of the coral.
[1:52:57.460 --> 1:53:02.460]  It kind of comes out to the edge about to go out it looks it goes back in it looks it goes back in.
[1:53:02.460 --> 1:53:12.460]  So yeah it's animal cognition there's a lot of this thinking chickens a review of cognition emotion behavior and domestic chicken there's a lot of these studies so the globalists know all this.
[1:53:12.460 --> 1:53:14.460]  So you hit on something bigger.
[1:53:14.460 --> 1:53:20.460]  They show you constant murder constant death you know video games where you kill a thousand people per game.
[1:53:20.460 --> 1:53:24.460]  Now you're not a psychotic or a murderer so you're not going to make you want to go kill people.
[1:53:24.460 --> 1:53:39.460]  But if you actually see real blood and death you're not going to care as much because the Pentagon developed the first video games to even the Marines on average 30 40% of the time up close would not kill somebody even if they were trying to kill them.
[1:53:39.460 --> 1:53:52.460]  They would shoot at them and miss and do things the army the numbers even higher but as soon as they got video games the original inventor of doom that was actually a video game for the Pentagon that is instinctive shooting so you don't think about it.
[1:53:52.460 --> 1:53:54.460]  You just shoot.
[1:53:54.460 --> 1:53:55.460]  Okay.
[1:53:55.460 --> 1:53:58.460]  And because most people don't have a really height and killer instinct.
[1:53:58.460 --> 1:54:00.460]  Most people like hold back like it's not.
[1:54:00.460 --> 1:54:02.460]  I mean seriously I have a killer instinct.
[1:54:02.460 --> 1:54:08.460]  So my problem is when I've gotten in fights if somebody hurts me I just I basically kill them because I'm not holding back my body.
[1:54:08.460 --> 1:54:15.460]  I mean if I karate chops my in the neck they're you know they're they're as soft against and breathing pipes crushed in because my brain says kill.
[1:54:15.460 --> 1:54:27.460]  And that's why they train the military when you're firing guns to say kill kill die mother die die not just the cadence the bullets you have to will kill kill kill it so your brain kill kill I'm not going to miss die die die.
[1:54:27.460 --> 1:54:29.460]  And so that's what it's all about.
[1:54:29.460 --> 1:54:31.460]  See what I'm sure I'm going.
[1:54:31.460 --> 1:54:33.460]  I know I'm not the only one.
[1:54:33.460 --> 1:54:40.460]  How can everybody be blinded to the sexualizing of our kids.
[1:54:40.460 --> 1:54:46.460]  It's the same thing they're programming us to show big fat evil men sharking out going.
[1:54:46.460 --> 1:54:56.460]  They train them all over the world you go why do they and the women all look at these are these are Satan calls and then they have their events they bring the kids and then the guy sharks out and goes.
[1:54:56.460 --> 1:55:08.460]  And they put the kid on the lap because again that is the most basic instinct that a man in a demon cloud saying I'm here as a priest to indoctrinate your children and to groom them.
[1:55:08.460 --> 1:55:22.460]  They actually say I am here to groom them in a holy art that they're actually in a satanic ceremony publicly externalizing the method and showing you your most instinctive thing is a man dressed up like a woman shaking their ass and your kids face is an enemy.
[1:55:22.460 --> 1:55:33.460]  And so they instinctively show you the hawk flying over and then tell you it's normal so you learn to freeze when the hawk comes the children just like that they admitted that.
[1:55:33.460 --> 1:55:46.460]  It's not the fault of the TSA workers it's Congress and the engineers doing it that the grooming of children the touching of kids kids being taken from their parents by strangers being touched and patted down literally makes them ready for pedophiles.
[1:55:46.460 --> 1:56:00.460]  So all this is perks testing all this is grooming all this is preparation all this is destroying your children's instincts to run from a stranger a man in a clown outfit making the face they make when they enter in her dungeons.
[1:56:00.460 --> 1:56:03.460]  I'm here to groom your children.
[1:56:03.460 --> 1:56:25.460]  They have signs of St. Ketamine rape drug with convicted murderers that have killed people with children little children little boys dresses girls that dance at Pito bars in front of everyone just just absolutely showing you what they're going to do we've captured your children their arms and we're going to destroy them and there's nothing you can do.
[1:56:25.460 --> 1:56:30.460]  More thing Alex so obviously we're in a reprieve.
[1:56:30.460 --> 1:56:45.460]  My instincts that hasn't worked on me here's the thing if you become aware of what they're doing and explain to your brain what they're doing and you decide to resist it see you then you don't adapt and submit you then you adapt and overcome we're not going to submit we're going to overcome you understand.
[1:56:45.460 --> 1:56:57.460]  They think they're maniacs they're going to find out what the real thing is all these Satanists try to have mimics and counterfeits of things you don't think God's people have a rage a thousand times more powerful than them.
[1:56:57.460 --> 1:57:03.460]  We can take out a hundred of their best people one man focused and that's where this is all going these people are pathetic losers.
[1:57:03.460 --> 1:57:20.460]  So we're obviously we got a short time of reprieve right here with President Trump to get right with with God and Jehovah and whatever your name for God is this is our short time our reprieve.
[1:57:20.460 --> 1:57:34.460]  It's obviously spiritual. What happens when President Trump is gone and out of office. What what goes on from from there.
[1:57:34.460 --> 1:57:54.460]  Incredibly good question God bless you Eric another incredible call the callers are just the best ever we're going to come right back and answer that question quickly my own view that will take more calls straight away our number three straight away.
[1:57:54.460 --> 1:58:09.460]  The fuel is paramount and that's my allegory turbo force is vitamins minerals amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy that lasts for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[1:58:09.460 --> 1:58:17.460]  Some people get 15 hours out of some people get about eight hours but people take this people taking sports people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high.

[2:00:06.460 --> 2:00:10.460]  The spirit.
[2:00:10.460 --> 2:00:27.460]  It's pathetic and weak but many are falling to it now in 2020 the numbers of the undead.
[2:00:27.460 --> 2:00:41.460]  Therapists in the U.S. say they are seeing increasing numbers of patients with what they call Donald Trump anxiety disorder Trump anxiety disorder Trump derangement syndrome.
[2:00:41.460 --> 2:00:58.460]  Trump derangement syndrome is clinically real doesn't merely affect individuals but entire political parties rendering them unrecognizable one minute they're perfectly normal.
[2:00:58.460 --> 2:01:12.460]  The veneer of civilization is evaporating quickly families and culture are collapsing and Godless leftist are behaving just like zombies of modern law.
[2:01:12.460 --> 2:01:17.460]  You can't trust your mother.
[2:01:17.460 --> 2:01:22.460]  Your best friend.
[2:01:22.460 --> 2:01:32.460]  For his clients it started the morning after the election doctors are seeing patients suffering from Trump anxiety disorder.
[2:01:32.460 --> 2:01:38.460]  A number of people are manifesting what I would post Trumpmatic stress disorder.
[2:01:38.460 --> 2:01:48.460]  An overpowering fear that President Trump represents the end of the world.
[2:01:48.460 --> 2:01:55.460]  Pray it doesn't happen to you.
[2:01:55.460 --> 2:02:24.460]  How white male.
[2:02:24.460 --> 2:02:27.460]  John Carpenter is Halloween.
[2:02:27.460 --> 2:02:29.460]  Now not just a movie.
[2:02:29.460 --> 2:02:31.460]  David Cronenberg's rabbit.
[2:02:31.460 --> 2:02:36.460]  Now Democrats and leftist in 2020.
[2:02:36.460 --> 2:02:43.460]  All right the caller brought up an incredibly important question and I will ask.
[2:02:43.460 --> 2:02:52.460]  The listeners to add that Luke and Jason and Chase and Gary and Derek and Mike and Danny and everybody we're going to go to Dave and others.
[2:02:52.460 --> 2:03:01.460]  We shouldn't make all this about Trump because they assassinate the Trump they set him up they frame him then the whole liberty movement and anti-globalism is tied to Trump.
[2:03:01.460 --> 2:03:05.460]  We already have populism exploding anti-globalism exploding.
[2:03:05.460 --> 2:03:07.460]  Trump's great.
[2:03:07.460 --> 2:03:15.460]  And we should support Trump and boy they've tried to take him out we need to stay on him know to do the right thing and put pressure on him because he's being precious from other sides you got to keep reminding.
[2:03:15.460 --> 2:03:18.460]  That's one thing about Trump is he's got a lot going on.
[2:03:18.460 --> 2:03:26.460]  I try to get stuff done all the time and I'm nothing compared to Trump busy wise and you know you think oh I'm glad one of his callers remind me of stuff that I was already thinking.
[2:03:26.460 --> 2:03:29.460]  That's why I love taking your calls like Trump loves talking to the public as well.
[2:03:29.460 --> 2:03:31.460]  So let him hear from you go bullhorning.
[2:03:31.460 --> 2:03:40.460]  Take the kids go to DC just get out of your shell and you walk right up and bullhorn real loud right into there and Mr. President this is what we want for 10 minutes.
[2:03:40.460 --> 2:03:42.460]  It'll always end up getting on the news.
[2:03:42.460 --> 2:03:44.460]  I mean it's right there.
[2:03:44.460 --> 2:03:52.460]  But if you don't they're coming for us in our homes and our churches and our businesses they're not going to leave us alone.
[2:03:52.460 --> 2:03:59.460]  Believe me I don't like doing this all the time except I do I make the decision to fight it so now I'm going hog wild.
[2:03:59.460 --> 2:04:03.460]  It's like playing football and I was never that good with football player.
[2:04:03.460 --> 2:04:09.460]  I was good enough when I was a freshman they put me on varsity and I got run over a bunch they were like see how good this guy gets but.
[2:04:09.460 --> 2:04:16.460]  If you're not having fun going 110% you need to get off the field because I'm not saying get out there and be perfect.
[2:04:16.460 --> 2:04:18.460]  I mean enjoy it.
[2:04:18.460 --> 2:04:20.460]  I enjoy going into a crowd of Antifa.
[2:04:20.460 --> 2:04:23.460]  They're totally freaked out and can't believe we'll go in there.
[2:04:23.460 --> 2:04:26.460]  Security people are freaked out but you know what we got to do this.
[2:04:26.460 --> 2:04:31.460]  I enjoy it when they lie about me and attack me because it means I'm in their head.
[2:04:31.460 --> 2:04:36.460]  They're literally freaked out.
[2:04:36.460 --> 2:04:39.460]  What's the term?
[2:04:39.460 --> 2:04:41.460]  You know I'm written space inside their head.
[2:04:41.460 --> 2:04:43.460]  That's where I want to be.
[2:04:43.460 --> 2:04:50.460]  I want the globals looking over their shoulder because they know our audience of activists are not the foundation of Impal Wars.
[2:04:50.460 --> 2:04:51.460]  They're the foundation.
[2:04:51.460 --> 2:04:52.460]  They're the walls.
[2:04:52.460 --> 2:04:53.460]  They're the roof.
[2:04:53.460 --> 2:04:54.460]  They're the superstructure.
[2:04:54.460 --> 2:04:57.460]  They're the furniture.
[2:04:57.460 --> 2:04:59.460]  They're the whole nine yards.
[2:04:59.460 --> 2:05:01.460]  Yes.
[2:05:01.460 --> 2:05:06.460]  Old friends are forgotten 2020 and old friends are not forgotten.

[2:06:12.460 --> 2:06:22.460]  Okay I've got nine stacks of news I prepared with three or four other stacks that are all just insane but I'm not covering any of these till at least this board of callers is off.
[2:06:22.460 --> 2:06:27.460]  I'm gonna take more 8777892539877789 hours.
[2:06:27.460 --> 2:06:30.460]  Smart camera data leak.
[2:06:30.460 --> 2:06:35.460]  Exposed personal data of 2.4 million users that that's all done on purpose.
[2:06:35.460 --> 2:06:39.460]  We're gonna look at all of that.
[2:06:39.460 --> 2:06:48.460]  Trump blames Iran at the protest or storm U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
[2:06:48.460 --> 2:06:52.460]  Paul Watts has got a new report the stupidest time in human history.
[2:06:52.460 --> 2:06:59.460]  Like water water everywhere on a drop to drink rhyme of the ancient mariner.
[2:06:59.460 --> 2:07:03.460]  We'll go to Luke we're gonna go to Mike Luke thank you for holding your awesome.
[2:07:03.460 --> 2:07:14.460]  The final transmission of info wars are my show in 2019 thanks for calling as your army veteran and says that info wars is vindicated please please tell us more.
[2:07:14.460 --> 2:07:16.460]  Absolutely Alex.
[2:07:16.460 --> 2:07:30.460]  So first reason I wanted to call is let the callers know that info wars is totally on in their Intel I just recently got out of military was part of the special operations community.
[2:07:30.460 --> 2:07:41.460]  And we were getting ready to invade North Korea and you were right on with your timelines I was listening to you the entire time and I was just blown away that.
[2:07:41.460 --> 2:07:49.460]  Like I don't know where you were getting your intel from but when I was listening to you it was like I was hearing and I was hearing.
[2:07:49.460 --> 2:07:56.460]  Other information privileged information that I thought was totally top secret but somehow you got it out.
[2:07:56.460 --> 2:08:08.460]  Anyway and so it wouldn't surprise me if all these different international entities are are listening to you constantly for what's going on in the world.
[2:08:08.460 --> 2:08:15.460]  But my brother he recently almost got he was almost murdered out in Vegas with that shooter.
[2:08:15.460 --> 2:08:24.460]  And I wanted to hear what if there's ever been any intel from you guys I know that you when I was listening to you back when that happened there was a lot of stuff that you had.
[2:08:24.460 --> 2:08:33.460]  You'd gotten a lot of tips and different things that had happened and I wanted to hear if there's anything that that actually came from that what what's going on with the I know they're trying to take our guns.
[2:08:33.460 --> 2:08:41.460]  I want to know what what's going on with the the whole investigation out in Vegas.
[2:08:41.460 --> 2:08:43.460]  Well we know what happened in Vegas.
[2:08:43.460 --> 2:08:54.460]  The Saudi Arabians were having a military Air Force will joint services convention.
[2:08:54.460 --> 2:09:10.460]  There were more than 10,000 Saudi nationals in the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, and they use that to bring in some al-Qaeda slash ISIS al-Nusra types to embarrass Trump and create a mass shooting.
[2:09:10.460 --> 2:09:14.460]  That would then be blamed on Trump and the American gun owner community.
[2:09:14.460 --> 2:09:23.460]  They had the brother who was working for deep state he wasn't in the CIA but he was contracting with with NATO.
[2:09:23.460 --> 2:09:27.460]  He'd been involved reportedly flying guns down during fast and furious.
[2:09:27.460 --> 2:09:29.460]  It wasn't just guns out of gun shops.
[2:09:29.460 --> 2:09:31.460]  The ATF was tracking that was a cover.
[2:09:31.460 --> 2:09:50.460]  It was weapons being shipped by Obama into Mexico to the cartels and then being shipped into the Middle East for the invasion of Libya and then Syria and the attempted complete overthrow of what happened in other areas like Kenya and Egypt.
[2:09:50.460 --> 2:10:05.460]  And so those weapons were brought into there and he had been involved in that and so he thought he was making a weapons deal and that's why it happened on the floors owned by the crown prince.
[2:10:05.460 --> 2:10:13.460]  And then that's why you saw Trump going to Saudi Arabia and a third of the royal family arrested a bunch of them secretly executed hung up.
[2:10:13.460 --> 2:10:14.460]  I'm not defending all this is what happened.
[2:10:14.460 --> 2:10:21.460]  You know they took over the fancy hotels and literally tortured thousands of them to find out who was involved in the coup.
[2:10:21.460 --> 2:10:25.460]  And then Trump said we're going to basically overthrow the House of Saud if you don't stop this.
[2:10:25.460 --> 2:10:31.460]  The House of Saud said oh we promise it's an attempt on us as well and then there's been a total regime change of those groups out of there.
[2:10:31.460 --> 2:10:34.460]  That's why you've seen a lot of Al Qaeda and ISIS stop their operations.
[2:10:34.460 --> 2:10:41.460]  Why you've seen their support and now we were able to get rid of al-Baghdadi and the rest of them because Trump said we're not funding radical Islam anymore.
[2:10:41.460 --> 2:10:45.460]  We're not blowing the doors off Europe. We're not going to flood Turkey with them. We're done.
[2:10:45.460 --> 2:10:47.460]  We're not doing all this crazy destabilization crap.
[2:10:47.460 --> 2:10:56.460]  That's why they call him incompetent and crazy is because he doesn't like to destabilize things from a sick globalist strategy of tension position.
[2:10:56.460 --> 2:11:02.460]  And so that's why they're so mad at Trump.
[2:11:02.460 --> 2:11:04.460]  And so that's why they said we don't know what happened in Vegas.
[2:11:04.460 --> 2:11:08.460]  So that's why people saw Middle Eastern men shooting people in other hotels.
[2:11:08.460 --> 2:11:14.460]  That's why there were dead bodies all over the place because the Saudi terrorists went crazy.
[2:11:14.460 --> 2:11:21.460]  But they didn't have a way getting past diplomatic security other than a few diplomats to get into the country with enough weapons.
[2:11:21.460 --> 2:11:25.460]  They didn't want weapons that could be traced back to the group in Saudi Arabia.
[2:11:25.460 --> 2:11:29.460]  And of course it was working with deep state, you know, the same crowd trying to embarrass Trump.
[2:11:29.460 --> 2:11:33.460]  The same ones trying to get the Iranians to attack the U.S. to get Trump into an embarrassing situation.
[2:11:33.460 --> 2:11:45.460]  The same group that just tried to take hostages. I know that's Shiites, but at that level, the Shiites and some arms of the Wahhabist Sunni are working with the Kerry Clinton Obama deep state.
[2:11:45.460 --> 2:11:59.460]  That's all admitted to again try to destabilize things, keep us in the Middle East and embarrass Trump just like the Bay of Pigs or just like the hostage crisis in 1979, 1980 with Jimmy Carter.
[2:11:59.460 --> 2:12:10.460]  And so they've got all these multiple paths going, but despite the stand down being ordered, the Iraqi military came in and stopped things even though SOC was ordered to stand down.
[2:12:10.460 --> 2:12:16.460]  They weren't able to get the hostages they wanted to start that whole fiasco with Trump and make him look weak.
[2:12:16.460 --> 2:12:21.460]  And so now that's why I said Trump's got to massively increase security at those embassies or leave them.
[2:12:21.460 --> 2:12:32.460]  And the green zone, as you know, is a giant armored mini city within Baghdad and they've got to give the normal orders that somebody crosses the line with a battering ram or a weapon or trying to knock down the walls.
[2:12:32.460 --> 2:12:36.460]  You kill them. And because it's not a war, you're stopping a war by doing that.
[2:12:36.460 --> 2:12:43.460]  So that's what I see going on. And you won't ever really hear what really happened with Saudi Arabia because you saw what Trump did.
[2:12:43.460 --> 2:12:49.460]  He went in there and took it over and killed thousands of people.
[2:12:49.460 --> 2:12:55.460]  Alex, all roads lead back to Saudi Arabia.
[2:12:55.460 --> 2:13:00.460]  Well, without getting into the stuff you saw or heard that was classified, give us your as a view, your citizen on that.
[2:13:00.460 --> 2:13:02.460]  Say that again.
[2:13:02.460 --> 2:13:05.460]  Give us as a citizen your view on that statement.
[2:13:05.460 --> 2:13:16.460]  So being in the military, I had a, all my superiors had top 25 books you should read.
[2:13:16.460 --> 2:13:22.460]  Guess how many soldiers actually read those books about zero to none with the exception of yours truly.
[2:13:22.460 --> 2:13:32.460]  And after going through all those different books and going through what what is really going on in the Middle East, all roads lead back to Saudi Arabia.
[2:13:32.460 --> 2:13:43.460]  And if you go into the deals that we made in the early late 70s after OPEC, we made a big deal with Saudi Arabia.
[2:13:43.460 --> 2:13:54.460]  And the whole idea was that we were going to use that deal to take over the resources and continually pull all those resources out of Saudi Arabia.
[2:13:54.460 --> 2:13:57.460]  And we were in the exchange was we were going to give them technology.
[2:13:57.460 --> 2:14:09.460]  But we what we didn't count on was that that Saudi Arabia was sitting on the biggest oil cash known to man and that we were going to still be pulling oil out of out of there 50 years later.
[2:14:09.460 --> 2:14:26.460]  And so then it's gotten to the point where it's hand and glove that the Saudis and the United States are so indistinguishable from one another because we've been doing business with each other for so long that now the United States is the Saudi Arabians attack dog in the Middle East.
[2:14:26.460 --> 2:14:39.460]  Literally anybody that is a against the House of Saud's agenda, those are the people that are going to be our next enemy.
[2:14:39.460 --> 2:14:41.460]  And that's why we're going after Iran.
[2:14:41.460 --> 2:14:47.460]  It's because it's not because of all these different, you know, Iran is a threat or whatever.
[2:14:47.460 --> 2:14:50.460]  It's because Saudi Arabia sees Iran as a threat.
[2:14:50.460 --> 2:15:00.460]  Well, I mean, I agree with you and then Israel usually gets the blame for being against Iran. They are as well. But I think Saudi Arabia, even more than Israel is who's pushing for confrontation.
[2:15:00.460 --> 2:15:01.460]  Exactly.
[2:15:01.460 --> 2:15:04.460]  All roads lead back to Saudi Arabia.
[2:15:04.460 --> 2:15:10.460]  So in 30 seconds, in 30 seconds, sir, what do you think Trump should do policy wise?
[2:15:10.460 --> 2:15:26.460]  I think that he should get off the old oil understanding, move into a new technology where we leave the dependency model of oil and we move into we release the technology that we already have existing.
[2:15:26.460 --> 2:15:37.460]  It's a hundred year old technology, Alex. Let's get rid of oil. Let's move into the future. Let's do what the United States is known for, which is innovating.
[2:15:37.460 --> 2:15:43.460]  Beautifully said. Wow. Look, thank you. These are the best calls we've ever had and more of them on the other side.
[2:15:43.460 --> 2:16:11.460]  There's just no way to cut these colors off. I'm like doing one color per segment, but it's dynamite. Stay with us.
[2:16:13.460 --> 2:16:33.460]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.

[2:17:54.460 --> 2:18:05.460]  In the year 2020, crazed leftists are literally crawling out of their political graves and attacking Americans that dare not submit to their bullying.
[2:18:05.460 --> 2:18:16.460]  2020 is here and despite all the globalist efforts, thanks to you the listeners and viewers, Info Wars is still on the air in 2020.

[2:18:48.460 --> 2:18:54.460]  Into the year 2020, 2020 and InfoWarsLife.com. Take action now.
[2:18:54.460 --> 2:18:59.460]  A little less than four months ago, I made the announcement on air.
[2:18:59.460 --> 2:19:09.460]  I said, hey, I have a tendency to take the high quality supplements from InfoWarsLife for a while, get great results and then slowly I stop using them.
[2:19:09.460 --> 2:19:18.460]  I forget to religiously take them. I'm going to religiously take the supplements for the next few months and I've lost almost 40 pounds now.
[2:19:18.460 --> 2:19:23.460]  Everybody can see it on air. My energy is off the charts. Everything is amazing.
[2:19:23.460 --> 2:19:30.460]  And it's because I am taking the InfoWarsLife products, the Krill Oil. I'm taking the X2 and the X3.
[2:19:30.460 --> 2:19:34.460]  I'm taking the Brain Force Plus when I work out, when I have to work really late.
[2:19:34.460 --> 2:19:42.460]  I'm taking half a pack of Turbo Force. It is clean energy. It is really making my whole life so much more enjoyable.
[2:19:42.460 --> 2:19:45.460]  It's making the shows more focused. I've got more energy.
[2:19:45.460 --> 2:19:49.460]  We have huge sales going right now for the new year at InfoWarsLife.com.
[2:19:49.460 --> 2:20:05.460]  A big clearance sale. Take advantage of it all at InfoWarsLife.com.
[2:20:19.460 --> 2:20:26.460]  Another world. Another time.
[2:20:26.460 --> 2:20:33.460]  I never got to a screen and pod until the first day or I haven't gotten to it yet.
[2:20:33.460 --> 2:20:37.460]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[2:20:37.460 --> 2:20:43.460]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:43.460 --> 2:20:54.460]  And that's the big V-craft line over New York. And of course, those are U.S. spacecraft.
[2:20:54.460 --> 2:21:03.460]  And you heard the caller earlier talking about how we need to just come out with the technology we've got.
[2:21:03.460 --> 2:21:15.460]  The Air Force and others have had little leaks on purpose for foreign governments to know about in the past, but they've got anti-matter weapons, anti-matter extraction.
[2:21:15.460 --> 2:21:19.460]  And we're lucky we haven't blown ourselves up. I mean, this is really Atlantis-type stuff.
[2:21:19.460 --> 2:21:26.460]  So whether Atlantis was real or not, they got some secret technology that blew up the continent.
[2:21:26.460 --> 2:21:34.460]  Or whether the theoretical of Atlantis is possible, well, we now know it is.
[2:21:34.460 --> 2:21:40.460]  So that's what's going on. And we need to let the public know about this.
[2:21:40.460 --> 2:21:44.460]  The public needs to demand to know about these type of things.
[2:21:44.460 --> 2:21:49.460]  And that you're seeing right there is a hologram projection.
[2:21:49.460 --> 2:21:56.460]  Now, I really know a lot about this stuff just from real research and a few other things.
[2:21:56.460 --> 2:22:00.460]  But I never really get into it because there's so many other big things to deal with.
[2:22:00.460 --> 2:22:03.460]  But remember, a few months ago I was going to play it. It was on the news.
[2:22:03.460 --> 2:22:08.460]  Maybe dig around the computer to see if we have it. It's Iranians Fire at UFO.
[2:22:08.460 --> 2:22:17.460]  And clearly, it's a hologram. And so on a clear night, all it takes is a few aircraft that can be at 50,000 feet or it can be drones doing it.
[2:22:17.460 --> 2:22:24.460]  They can project a hologram. And the Iranians are going crazy with just hundreds of machine guns firing at it.
[2:22:24.460 --> 2:22:26.460]  It's pretty spectacular with their tracers.
[2:22:26.460 --> 2:22:32.460]  So a lot of what you see is holograms.
[2:22:32.460 --> 2:22:41.460]  But the really high-up stuff is blimps that they're using with a lot of different arrays and surveillance grids on them.
[2:22:41.460 --> 2:22:45.460]  And then there are obviously a lot of other satellites and things up in space.
[2:22:45.460 --> 2:22:50.460]  And Trump wants to start bringing all this out and show America the superiority while we still have it
[2:22:50.460 --> 2:22:55.460]  and then innovate and not transfer it to China and others and build the new economies going forward.
[2:22:55.460 --> 2:23:00.460]  The globalists want a post-industrial world where we get iPhones that spy on us and stuff like that.
[2:23:00.460 --> 2:23:06.460]  But that's the only real innovation and electric cars that take more carbon to operate than regular gas cars.
[2:23:06.460 --> 2:23:15.460]  There's footage of the Iranians firing at clearly what is a hologram when you slow it down and watch the HD video.
[2:23:15.460 --> 2:23:19.460]  That gives new meaning to cat-chasing a red laser.
[2:23:19.460 --> 2:23:22.460]  Oh man, it's hilarious.
[2:23:22.460 --> 2:23:30.460]  In fact, turn up the audio. It's fun to hear them talking in the background in Persian.
[2:23:30.460 --> 2:23:37.460]  That's clearly a hologram.
[2:23:37.460 --> 2:23:40.460]  And they're just like, oh, we can't seem to hit it.
[2:23:40.460 --> 2:23:43.460]  Can we now show a cat-chasing a red laser?
[2:23:43.460 --> 2:23:49.460]  It's the same concept.
[2:23:49.460 --> 2:23:55.460]  And of course, ABC News will probably repurpose that and claim it's Trump shooting down Kurdish airlines or something.
[2:23:55.460 --> 2:24:01.460]  Like ABC News said he was blowing up cities. Enough of me! Enough of me!
[2:24:01.460 --> 2:24:05.460]  By the way, this is set for a radio TV format with 15 minutes of ads an hour. That's the standard.
[2:24:05.460 --> 2:24:07.460]  But I am going to start a new show soon.
[2:24:07.460 --> 2:24:16.460]  There's hours a day at least with basically only commercials at the middle and start of the hour on top of this show in 2020.
[2:24:16.460 --> 2:24:19.460]  So that'll be announced in about two weeks.
[2:24:19.460 --> 2:24:22.460]  There you can see the cat-chasing, the UFO.
[2:24:22.460 --> 2:24:29.460]  Now, it doesn't know that that's a red laser. Its concept and all of its instincts and development is that if it sees something, it must be real.
[2:24:29.460 --> 2:24:35.460]  There you go. And you can see the same concept for the Iranians or anybody else for that matter.
[2:24:35.460 --> 2:24:43.460]  Because technology, to someone that doesn't know what it is, is magic and is indistinguishable, as Arthur C. Clarke once said.
[2:24:43.460 --> 2:24:46.460]  All projections of light.
[2:24:46.460 --> 2:24:50.460]  All right, let's go ahead and take another ring of dinghy.
[2:24:50.460 --> 2:24:54.460]  Mike in New Jersey, thank you. You're awesome for holding.
[2:24:54.460 --> 2:24:58.460]  We appreciate you. What are your predictions for 2020, my friend?
[2:24:58.460 --> 2:25:01.460]  Hey, Alex, how you doing? Happy New Year. God bless you.
[2:25:01.460 --> 2:25:02.460]  Thank you.
[2:25:02.460 --> 2:25:06.460]  Third-time caller. I've been a long-time listener. I've spent thousands of dollars on the products.
[2:25:06.460 --> 2:25:10.460]  Well, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. And let me tell you, it's important, so thank you.
[2:25:10.460 --> 2:25:15.460]  Let me tell you, I'm on board. I'm listening every single day. I don't miss the day.
[2:25:15.460 --> 2:25:19.460]  So don't ever feel alone, brother, because I am on board listening to you every single day.
[2:25:19.460 --> 2:25:24.460]  I just bought the shirt with your laser eyes saying, don't dare listen to Alex Jones.
[2:25:24.460 --> 2:25:29.460]  And me and my daughter are going to try the whitening toothpaste, so that should be coming in the mail.
[2:25:29.460 --> 2:25:30.460]  Thank you, brother.
[2:25:30.460 --> 2:25:34.460]  Thank you. God bless you. So anyways, thanks for taking my call.
[2:25:34.460 --> 2:25:47.460]  What happened was maybe about a week ago, I was listening to the rebroadcast and you let the doors, riders on the storm, just play on the intro.
[2:25:47.460 --> 2:25:54.460]  And you kind of were analyzing the lyrics. And I'm a big doors fan, so I was like thinking about some of the other lyrics.
[2:25:54.460 --> 2:26:05.460]  And I had kind of a hindsight 2020 moment where I was thinking, you know, look at how Jim, back even in the 60s, was talking about the danger of TV.
[2:26:05.460 --> 2:26:16.460]  Like he says, I'm sick of dour faces staring at me from the TV tower. And he says, you know, she's got the world locked up inside a plastic box.
[2:26:16.460 --> 2:26:20.460]  You know, so he was 20th Century Fox.
[2:26:20.460 --> 2:26:24.460]  She's a 20th Century Fox, right? So he was already talking about.
[2:26:24.460 --> 2:26:28.460]  She don't waste time with elemental talk.
[2:26:28.460 --> 2:26:39.460]  That's right. That's right. And that's, you know, in that whole, that whole idea got me thinking about how we got this mess in a spiritual sense.
[2:26:39.460 --> 2:26:54.460]  So, you know, what I think has taken place over the last 50, 60 years in this country is we replaced God and Jesus Christ with a TV media God that was set up by Satan and that TV.
[2:26:54.460 --> 2:26:58.460]  And it got us hooked with gun smoke and all this stuff that seemed good. That's the worm on the hook.
[2:26:58.460 --> 2:27:03.460]  And then now it's like, by the way, we're going to teach your children how to die.
[2:27:03.460 --> 2:27:07.460]  And now it's hit the clown reasons with the TV.
[2:27:07.460 --> 2:27:19.460]  Basically, the way I look at it is we kind of that we deserve what we're getting right now, because if you look at the Bible, I mean, the TV, we have a symbol of an angler fish, a really scary deep sea fish.
[2:27:19.460 --> 2:27:27.460]  And the light on the end of its of its wand is a little TV. And then you zoom in and a little children are up close watching it.
[2:27:27.460 --> 2:27:30.460]  And that's the perfect allegory.
[2:27:30.460 --> 2:27:39.460]  Yeah. And like you're like your caller was talking about earlier with the chickens and the hawk, you know, like, you know, basically, we just get desensitized and just allow evil.
[2:27:39.460 --> 2:27:44.460]  Hey, guys, get Hillary off the screen. Don't just be randomly putting Hillary up on screen. Come on, crew.
[2:27:44.460 --> 2:27:48.460]  I was just screwed up. Just randomly put Hillary on screen.
[2:27:48.460 --> 2:27:59.460]  Maybe I'm going to get our incited from this call. But anyway, I was just thinking, you know, in terms of this being a spiritual war, my point was was thinking about Jim, you know, is like even going all the way back to
[2:27:59.460 --> 2:28:11.460]  then we were replacing Jesus and Christian values in this country with this new media God that was ushering in this new era of godlessness.
[2:28:11.460 --> 2:28:24.460]  And if you look in the Bible, like if you read the books of kings, you can see that every time that the Israelites disobeyed God, he always allowed like the Philistines or some other enemy to just rise up against them and start attacking them.
[2:28:24.460 --> 2:28:27.460]  That's right. Every time they threw God out the window, they got enslaved.
[2:28:27.460 --> 2:28:36.460]  And that's what's happening with us. And so you were saying, hey, you know, tell us what you think is going to happen going forward.
[2:28:36.460 --> 2:28:42.460]  And like the other caller was saying, what's going to happen when Trump's out of office? Well, I think you made a good point.
[2:28:42.460 --> 2:28:46.460]  We got to stop putting so much emphasis on Donald Trump. I love Donald Trump.
[2:28:46.460 --> 2:28:50.460]  Stay there. Stay there. We're going to come back and have you finish. And then I'm going to get to everybody. We're getting everybody here.
[2:28:50.460 --> 2:28:53.460]  And we're going to get covered in the news, but I'm doing the fourth hour.
[2:28:53.460 --> 2:28:59.460]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[2:28:59.460 --> 2:29:08.460]  I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[2:29:08.460 --> 2:29:13.460]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:13.460 --> 2:29:21.460]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[2:29:21.460 --> 2:29:28.460]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[2:29:28.460 --> 2:29:33.460]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[2:29:33.460 --> 2:29:51.460]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse. Get clean. Call now and learn more.
[2:29:51.460 --> 2:30:00.460]  I've got a problem that I want to confess to the listeners and viewers.
[2:30:00.460 --> 2:30:09.460]  I've been on the air so long that I take it for granted now when we break some massive story that changes the whole world
[2:30:09.460 --> 2:30:15.460]  and that really does great things for the future of not just our children, but our children's children.
[2:30:15.460 --> 2:30:21.460]  Infowars really has changed history. And that's why I need to pull back and ask the listeners, because I know you're a lot like me,
[2:30:21.460 --> 2:30:25.460]  to really think about a world without infowars.
[2:30:25.460 --> 2:30:31.460]  Because I can tell you right now, if people don't really step up to the plate and really financially support our broadcast,
[2:30:31.460 --> 2:30:35.460]  going into 2020, we're not going to be on the air in a year or so.
[2:30:35.460 --> 2:30:43.460]  If you do support us, we're not just going to stay on the air, but we are going to expand in ways that are going to blow you away.
[2:30:43.460 --> 2:30:46.460]  I've never let you down. You've never let me down.
[2:30:46.460 --> 2:30:56.460]  Step up to the plate now, go to infowarsstore.com, buy great products and fund our operation and watch us make history together again.
[2:30:56.460 --> 2:31:02.460]  We're closing out the year 2019. I don't have to tell you that 2020 is going to be a maker to break it.
[2:31:02.460 --> 2:31:05.460]  Not just for Infowars, not just for America, but the whole world.
[2:31:05.460 --> 2:31:11.460]  We are in a battle between the forces of globalism that want to post-human world and those that want to pro-human world.
[2:31:11.460 --> 2:31:19.460]  We're in a fight between Satan and Christ, and it's being played out amongst us mortals, but it's being directed from on high.
[2:31:19.460 --> 2:31:25.460]  And I'm just telling the listeners this broadcast, without you, we're going to lose this fight.
[2:31:25.460 --> 2:31:30.460]  I need all of you to realize how important you are and how important Infowars is and what we've done together.
[2:31:30.460 --> 2:31:36.460]  And to just take stock and take measure at the end of the year and think about what you're going to do.
[2:31:36.460 --> 2:31:42.460]  Whether supporting Infowars or buying products from us or starting your own show, just whatever you do, take action now.
[2:31:42.460 --> 2:31:49.460]  History is happening. Please do your Christmas shopping. Please do your New Year shopping at InfowarsTour.com.
[2:31:49.460 --> 2:31:54.460]  We've got the best products. You're only helping the globalists if you don't do it. Thank you.
[2:31:54.460 --> 2:32:00.460]  It's too late to order Christmas presents in most areas of the United States for your friends and your family.
[2:32:00.460 --> 2:32:08.460]  But it's not too late to do it for yourself and to keep the Infowar on the air and stronger than ever.
[2:32:08.460 --> 2:32:15.460]  Everybody who watches the show can see that I've lost almost 40 pounds. I'm more focused. I'm the best I've ever been.
[2:32:15.460 --> 2:32:21.460]  And you know why that is? I said four months ago, I'm going to religiously take all the products, because I've never taken all of them.
[2:32:21.460 --> 2:32:32.460]  And then I always forget to take them and I see my stamina, my energy, everything plunge. When I do take the products, the X2, the X3, the bodies,
[2:32:32.460 --> 2:32:40.460]  and all the other great products, like the bone broth, you name it, my life is so much better than probiotics, the MycoZX, it's incredible.
[2:32:40.460 --> 2:32:49.460]  These things have changed my life. They've changed so many others. But it's a total 360 win because it funds the Infowar so you can't lose unless you don't take action.
[2:32:49.460 --> 2:32:54.460]  Step to the plate, give yourself a gift of health, infowarslife.com. Take action.
[2:33:19.460 --> 2:33:25.460]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:33:49.460 --> 2:34:01.460]  In this world we're thrown, like a dog without a bone and a actor out of law, riders on the storm.
[2:34:01.460 --> 2:34:12.460]  There's a killer on the road, his brain is squirming like a toad.
[2:34:12.460 --> 2:34:29.460]  Take a long holiday, let your children play. If you give this man a ride, sweet memory will die, killer on the road.
[2:34:42.460 --> 2:34:52.460]  Take a long holiday, let your children play. If you give this man a ride, sweet memory will die, killer on the road.
[2:35:12.460 --> 2:35:32.460]  Take him by the hand, make him understand. The world on you depends on life, oh never end, God, I love your man.
[2:35:42.460 --> 2:35:52.460]  Take a long holiday, let your children play.
[2:36:12.460 --> 2:36:16.460]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel building ready.
[2:36:16.460 --> 2:36:26.460]  Take a long holiday, let your children play.
[2:36:26.460 --> 2:36:36.460]  Take a long holiday, let your children play.
[2:36:36.460 --> 2:36:46.460]  Take a long holiday, let your children play.
[2:37:06.460 --> 2:37:16.460]  Take a long holiday, let your children play.
[2:37:16.460 --> 2:37:26.460]  Take a long holiday, let your children play.
[2:37:26.460 --> 2:37:36.460]  Take a long holiday, let your children play.
[2:37:56.460 --> 2:38:06.460]  Well, you know, King Solomon in Ecclesiastes, he says nothing has happened under the sun that didn't already happen thousands and thousands of years ago.
[2:38:06.460 --> 2:38:10.460]  So, in my opinion, the way to see what's going to happen going forward.
[2:38:10.460 --> 2:38:16.460]  Well, you just had the big secret, and you have to really have the research to understand it, but like what are the dinosaur bones and all that.
[2:38:16.460 --> 2:38:22.460]  And it talks about the days of Noah. Adam is a reboot itself from another creation, obviously.
[2:38:22.460 --> 2:38:28.460]  And so it's not like the Bible is competing with science. Modern science is a total false projection.
[2:38:28.460 --> 2:38:32.460]  But it doesn't mean preachers interpreting the Bible 200 years ago are accurate either.
[2:38:32.460 --> 2:38:39.460]  But now in the modern world, seeing it repeat, now we really know what the Bible is saying, because now it all makes even more sense.
[2:38:39.460 --> 2:38:43.460]  Because as you're saying, there have been clearly other human civilizations.
[2:38:43.460 --> 2:38:51.460]  Plato wrote about Atlantis, and now they had flying machines and how it blew up from this big white, white thing that gave it their power.
[2:38:51.460 --> 2:38:56.460]  He had just read about it. Everything else, they've dug up and found civilizations and things he talked about.
[2:38:56.460 --> 2:39:01.460]  He was writing a real history book. Well, I mean, is that what you're getting at?
[2:39:01.460 --> 2:39:05.460]  Well, yeah, I'm kind of going off like what the Bible said.
[2:39:05.460 --> 2:39:08.460]  And, you know, so I'm a Christian. I read the Bible every day.
[2:39:08.460 --> 2:39:15.460]  So when I'm looking forward to see what's going to happen, what my spirit is telling me is that we are in the midst of a revival.
[2:39:15.460 --> 2:39:20.460]  I was born in the year of our Lord, 1975, so I'm 44 years old right now.
[2:39:20.460 --> 2:39:29.460]  And what I've seen in my lifetime, I grew up in Southern California, has just been a regression from California was so awesome to just horrible.
[2:39:29.460 --> 2:39:31.460]  And I had to leave and now I live in Jersey.
[2:39:31.460 --> 2:39:42.460]  And, you know, what I think is going to happen is people like you and me, Alex and our generation, we're tired of being mesmerized by the media and promiscuity and drug addiction.
[2:39:42.460 --> 2:39:46.460]  No, I agree. There's going to be a giant maxing out and a pulling away.
[2:39:46.460 --> 2:39:56.460]  And that's why they got a social credit score to try to make us submit to them and worship their beast, worship the image of the beast that is the screen.
[2:39:56.460 --> 2:39:59.460]  But we are, but we're rejecting it worldwide.
[2:39:59.460 --> 2:40:04.460]  And so what I think is happening right now, what we're going to see is a move back to Christ.
[2:40:04.460 --> 2:40:09.460]  And God is going to rise up champion for us.
[2:40:09.460 --> 2:40:14.460]  Like if you look at the story of Gideon, 30 men defeated an army of over a million guys.
[2:40:14.460 --> 2:40:16.460]  So, you know, God can do anything.
[2:40:16.460 --> 2:40:18.460]  Nothing's impossible with him.
[2:40:18.460 --> 2:40:24.460]  If we turn back to Christ and there's a global movement, then that's going to be the way forward.
[2:40:24.460 --> 2:40:25.460]  Not all rest.
[2:40:25.460 --> 2:40:26.460]  Oh, I 100% agree.
[2:40:26.460 --> 2:40:34.460]  But the devil has then targeted all the churches and most of them are just prosperity, gospel, glitter bugs, not doing anything.
[2:40:34.460 --> 2:40:36.460]  Oh, the churches are dead in America.
[2:40:36.460 --> 2:40:44.460]  Unfortunately and sadly, too many materialistic preachers that only care about money and being on TV and being famous.
[2:40:44.460 --> 2:40:46.460]  But see, that's a revival is going to happen.
[2:40:46.460 --> 2:40:47.460]  Well, I want to be clear.
[2:40:47.460 --> 2:40:55.460]  You know, the Bible says, you know, if you really been doing the right for God for a long time in your generations, you'll end up having wealth because God gives us to bend you over the planet.
[2:40:55.460 --> 2:40:59.460]  But what's bad is they won't expose the attacks on the family.
[2:40:59.460 --> 2:41:00.460]  They won't fight abortion.
[2:41:00.460 --> 2:41:04.460]  They won't defend the Second Amendment and faith without works is dead.
[2:41:04.460 --> 2:41:07.460]  My problem with the glitter bug preachers is they just saw her body.
[2:41:07.460 --> 2:41:08.460]  Just be happy.
[2:41:08.460 --> 2:41:09.460]  Love Jesus.
[2:41:09.460 --> 2:41:10.460]  Everything's fine.
[2:41:10.460 --> 2:41:14.460]  We're about to be raptured out when we're supposed to be the salt of the earth out there confronting these devils.
[2:41:14.460 --> 2:41:17.460]  Instead, they're just giving the planet over to Satan.
[2:41:17.460 --> 2:41:20.460]  And that's my big problem with the glitter bug preachers.
[2:41:20.460 --> 2:41:22.460]  Well, they're not sincere with God.
[2:41:22.460 --> 2:41:23.460]  That's the problem.
[2:41:23.460 --> 2:41:30.460]  When we have, I mean, you can take one look at some of these evangelical preachers and they look and act like demons.
[2:41:30.460 --> 2:41:35.460]  I mean, when I look at some of these guys, I go, my God, can people not see that's a demon walking around?
[2:41:35.460 --> 2:41:41.460]  I mean, some of the most demonic acting and looking people I've seen are popular TV preachers.
[2:41:41.460 --> 2:41:48.460]  And again, that's done on purpose so that people with discernment go, oh, this must be bad to try to trick you to turn away from God.
[2:41:48.460 --> 2:41:50.460]  That's the devil's greatest trick.
[2:41:50.460 --> 2:41:55.460]  Well, you know, I've talked with a lot of atheists and they always go, oh, I don't want to go to the church.
[2:41:55.460 --> 2:41:56.460]  Look at those dorky guys.
[2:41:56.460 --> 2:41:57.460]  I don't want anything to do with them.
[2:41:57.460 --> 2:42:02.460]  And so they reject Christ because the people that they see on TV are so appalling.
[2:42:02.460 --> 2:42:04.460]  And that's, that's, I mean, they look like the most.
[2:42:04.460 --> 2:42:08.460]  Those preachers are lit up like narcissistic loans.
[2:42:08.460 --> 2:42:15.460]  I mean, anybody can sit there and radiate fake confidence and wild eyedness and go like, let me try to act like one of those preachers.
[2:42:15.460 --> 2:42:18.460]  No, I mean, it's just like, what?
[2:42:18.460 --> 2:42:20.460]  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[2:42:20.460 --> 2:42:21.460]  I mean, wow.
[2:42:21.460 --> 2:42:23.460]  Got to jump with one more point on that.
[2:42:23.460 --> 2:42:31.460]  So if you look at what happened when Babylon came and took over Jerusalem and stuck it and took all the, all the people in Jerusalem into captivity in Babylon,
[2:42:31.460 --> 2:42:39.460]  all of the people that were supposed to be the, the, the priests and the church, they were all practicing idolatry.
[2:42:39.460 --> 2:42:41.460]  So that's kind of what's going on in America.
[2:42:41.460 --> 2:42:42.460]  Oh, yeah.
[2:42:42.460 --> 2:42:48.460]  That's why some of these people that are really anti-Semitic, they're always like, look, the Jews practice devil worship with the occult.
[2:42:48.460 --> 2:42:50.460]  Well, of course, there's some Jewish groups that do that.
[2:42:50.460 --> 2:42:57.460]  They were captured taking to Babylon and that's a little less than four months ago.
[2:42:57.460 --> 2:42:58.460]  I made the announcement on air.
[2:42:58.460 --> 2:43:08.460]  I said, Hey, I have a tendency to take the high quality supplements from fours life for a while, get great results and then slowly I stop using them.
[2:43:08.460 --> 2:43:10.460]  I forget to religiously take them.
[2:43:10.460 --> 2:43:16.460]  I'm going to religiously take the supplements for the next few months and I've lost almost 40 pounds.
[2:43:16.460 --> 2:43:18.460]  Now everybody can see it on air.
[2:43:18.460 --> 2:43:20.460]  My energy is off the charts.
[2:43:20.460 --> 2:43:22.460]  Everything is amazing.
[2:43:22.460 --> 2:43:26.460]  And it's because I am taking the info wars life products, the krill oil.
[2:43:26.460 --> 2:43:28.460]  I'm taking the X2 and the X3.
[2:43:28.460 --> 2:43:35.460]  I'm taking the brain force plus when I work out, when I have to work really late, I'm taking half a pack of turbo force.
[2:43:35.460 --> 2:43:37.460]  It is clean energy.
[2:43:37.460 --> 2:43:41.460]  It is really making my whole life so much more enjoyable.
[2:43:41.460 --> 2:43:43.460]  It's making the shows more focused.
[2:43:43.460 --> 2:43:44.460]  I've got more energy.
[2:43:44.460 --> 2:43:48.460]  We have huge sales going right now for the new year at infowarslife.com.
[2:43:48.460 --> 2:43:49.460]  A big clearance sale.

[2:43:53.460 --> 2:43:54.460]  Andy in Florida.
[2:43:54.460 --> 2:43:55.460]  Thank you, Andy.
[2:43:55.460 --> 2:43:56.460]  Go ahead.
[2:43:56.460 --> 2:43:57.460]  Hey, Alex.
[2:43:57.460 --> 2:43:58.460]  I love you, man.
[2:43:58.460 --> 2:43:59.460]  We love you.
[2:43:59.460 --> 2:44:02.460]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic on hand, I got to talk about one of your product.
[2:44:02.460 --> 2:44:03.460]  A little bit about me.
[2:44:03.460 --> 2:44:04.460]  I'm 245 pounds.
[2:44:04.460 --> 2:44:08.460]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short.
[2:44:08.460 --> 2:44:10.460]  I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[2:44:10.460 --> 2:44:15.460]  I do have ADHD, but I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties.
[2:44:15.460 --> 2:44:19.460]  I kind of got a little out of hand and I listen to you religiously in my truck every day.
[2:44:19.460 --> 2:44:22.460]  So I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche.
[2:44:22.460 --> 2:44:25.460]  This product changed my life, but turbo force really changed my life.
[2:44:25.460 --> 2:44:30.460]  It was a day I'd no longer take Adderall and I get by literally 13 hours a day I work
[2:44:30.460 --> 2:44:33.460]  on a half of a packet of your turbo force.
[2:44:33.460 --> 2:44:37.460]  And if you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money
[2:44:37.460 --> 2:44:40.460]  versus, you know, a monster, which is what, $4.99.
[2:44:40.460 --> 2:44:43.460]  And, you know, I just had to call and tell you guys how great turbo force is.
[2:44:43.460 --> 2:44:45.460]  And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[2:44:45.460 --> 2:44:46.460]  We're really proud of turbo force.
[2:44:46.460 --> 2:44:47.460]  So thank you, sir.

[2:44:59.460 --> 2:45:02.460]  I shouldn't do this because all work and no playmates.

[2:47:49.940 --> 2:47:56.940]  Well, I mean, really, I don't even really try to use it because it's scary.
[2:47:56.940 --> 2:48:00.940]  But I just know that type of stuff.
[2:48:00.940 --> 2:48:02.940]  And I'm never really wrong.
[2:48:02.940 --> 2:48:04.940]  Sometimes plans change.
[2:48:04.940 --> 2:48:07.940]  The future changes because we're allowed to change the future.
[2:48:07.940 --> 2:48:09.940]  God has given us that power.
[2:48:09.940 --> 2:48:14.940]  But God can show us what's coming in the future as possible futures.
[2:48:14.940 --> 2:48:21.940]  So it doesn't actually have to end the way we've been told unless we do certain things.
[2:48:21.940 --> 2:48:23.940]  And that could send the deeper mysteries.
[2:48:23.940 --> 2:48:28.940]  Now, most of it is I could watch the globalist all freaked out.
[2:48:28.940 --> 2:48:36.940]  Watch the media defending Kim Jong-un and praising North Korea and attacking Trump when Trump first got in.
[2:48:36.940 --> 2:48:40.940]  So the decision was, OK, we'll get ready to go in there unless he makes a peace deal.
[2:48:40.940 --> 2:48:48.940]  He tried to renege, but at least that made Kim Jong-un back off from trying to start a war to embarrass Trump.
[2:48:48.940 --> 2:48:55.940]  And that was being done through the deep state, through China, telling North Korea, go ahead and do this to test Trump.
[2:48:55.940 --> 2:48:59.940]  And so Trump said, fine, you keep firing missiles at Japan.
[2:48:59.940 --> 2:49:01.940]  You keep threatening to attack people.
[2:49:01.940 --> 2:49:04.940]  You keep threatening to level soul will come after you.
[2:49:04.940 --> 2:49:05.940]  And they were ready and they built up.
[2:49:05.940 --> 2:49:06.940]  And I mean, I have military context.
[2:49:06.940 --> 2:49:07.940]  That was obvious.
[2:49:07.940 --> 2:49:13.940]  You could see how Michael Moore was saying, oh, this is going to embarrass Trump.
[2:49:13.940 --> 2:49:15.940]  Something big is coming when he was president elect.
[2:49:15.940 --> 2:49:26.940]  They did all that to the strategy of tension, threatening to destroy our world just to try to make sure an American president got embarrassed.
[2:49:26.940 --> 2:49:31.940]  But better people at the Pentagon, a lot of other places and Congress, the Republicans said, we're not doing this.
[2:49:31.940 --> 2:49:36.940]  And, you know, the deep state getting crazy is the reason it's not being listened to now.
[2:49:36.940 --> 2:49:42.940]  A bunch of weirdo bureaucrats, most have never been in the military trying to start wars because they think that makes them powerful.
[2:49:42.940 --> 2:49:44.940]  It's crazy.
[2:49:44.940 --> 2:49:47.940]  That's part of what I was going to get into with the whole embassy thing and all the rest of it.
[2:49:47.940 --> 2:49:49.940]  But I'm taking calls because they're so informative.
[2:49:49.940 --> 2:49:56.940]  But I will get to that early in the next hour once we're finished with some of these calls.
[2:49:56.940 --> 2:49:59.940]  But it's a very, very scary point to be at right now.
[2:49:59.940 --> 2:50:01.940]  And they're trying to restart the Korea crisis.
[2:50:01.940 --> 2:50:04.940]  They're trying to restart this Iran crisis.
[2:50:04.940 --> 2:50:08.940]  And you better believe the deep states of manipulating Saudi Arabia and Iran.
[2:50:08.940 --> 2:50:14.940]  They don't control those countries, but they've got factions in there they're working with.
[2:50:14.940 --> 2:50:19.940]  But Trump is getting more power in the presidency and is becoming more and more the president.
[2:50:19.940 --> 2:50:23.940]  So that's why we better start seeing him deliver.
[2:50:23.940 --> 2:50:24.940]  He goes on many fronts.
[2:50:24.940 --> 2:50:28.940]  He's not delivering.
[2:50:28.940 --> 2:50:30.940]  Yes, he's a lot better than Hillary Clinton.
[2:50:30.940 --> 2:50:35.940]  Thank God for him, but you've heard the callers.
[2:50:35.940 --> 2:50:38.940]  They've raised a lot of serious issues and it's us raising issues.
[2:50:38.940 --> 2:50:41.940]  It's you raising issues that caused the awakening that got Trump in.
[2:50:41.940 --> 2:50:44.940]  We have to continue past Trump and not make it about Trump.
[2:50:44.940 --> 2:50:47.940]  Make it about the issues.
[2:50:47.940 --> 2:50:50.940]  All right, who's been holding the longest here and I'll go to them.
[2:50:50.940 --> 2:50:54.940]  Chase the Patriot, our frequent caller and fellow talk show host.
[2:50:54.940 --> 2:50:55.940]  Go ahead.
[2:50:55.940 --> 2:50:56.940]  Thanks for holding.
[2:50:56.940 --> 2:50:57.940]  Hey, Alex.
[2:50:57.940 --> 2:50:58.940]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:50:58.940 --> 2:51:02.940]  It's a great thing still here in info wars for about a year and a half.
[2:51:02.940 --> 2:51:08.940]  Now they've been throwing everything, including the kitchen sink at you and you're still on the air still getting the message out there.
[2:51:08.940 --> 2:51:10.940]  So just congratulations to that, brother.
[2:51:10.940 --> 2:51:11.940]  Well, thanks.
[2:51:11.940 --> 2:51:16.940]  You know, I learned something yesterday that I'm not a liberty to talk about, but I'm going to have to talk about it.
[2:51:16.940 --> 2:51:20.940]  And it's not because we're victims, but we are the victims of criminal activity.
[2:51:20.940 --> 2:51:33.940]  And these people are so arrogant that I'm dealing with judges in some of the cases that the deep states put against us that that have said in front of people.
[2:51:33.940 --> 2:51:36.940]  That they're railroading me no matter what I do.
[2:51:36.940 --> 2:51:38.940]  Well, that's that's that's not just an ethical.
[2:51:38.940 --> 2:51:39.940]  That's criminal.
[2:51:39.940 --> 2:51:41.940]  And we've got the affidavits and stuff.
[2:51:41.940 --> 2:51:44.940]  So I mean, it's these people just think they're allowed to do whatever they want.
[2:51:44.940 --> 2:51:46.940]  Look what they're doing to Trump in Congress.
[2:51:46.940 --> 2:51:48.940]  I mean, this is just lawless craziness.
[2:51:48.940 --> 2:51:49.940]  Sorry, go ahead.
[2:51:49.940 --> 2:51:50.940]  Well, yeah.
[2:51:50.940 --> 2:51:55.940]  And on that point, it's a good thing over 160 federal judges he's been able to put in.
[2:51:55.940 --> 2:51:58.940]  So that impact will be long in, you know, in the future.
[2:51:58.940 --> 2:52:08.940]  But what I wanted to talk about what they're doing to you and what we've seen the UN try to do with the Internet over the last couple of days, turning over control to China and Russia and different aspects.
[2:52:08.940 --> 2:52:18.940]  And also, more importantly, is this next year, I think the big story is going to be the deep fake videos because they can manipulate and make any kind of information.
[2:52:18.940 --> 2:52:20.940]  Say whatever they want and when they do.
[2:52:20.940 --> 2:52:24.940]  And that's why they're putting out so deep fake so they can certify what's real and what's not.
[2:52:24.940 --> 2:52:25.940]  They can put out false.
[2:52:25.940 --> 2:52:26.940]  Say it's real.
[2:52:26.940 --> 2:52:29.940]  When real comes out on them, they can say it's false.
[2:52:29.940 --> 2:52:30.940]  Exactly right.
[2:52:30.940 --> 2:52:36.940]  But the thing that I'm more concerned of is the big event, whatever the big event they want to make, they're going to be able to control.
[2:52:36.940 --> 2:52:42.940]  Maybe it's, you know, last year we had the test of the emergency broadcast system to every single cell phone.
[2:52:42.940 --> 2:52:48.940]  And if they have some kind of technology, I always go back to war of the world with only the radio.
[2:52:48.940 --> 2:52:52.940]  They were able to convince the entire public of a of an alien invasion.
[2:52:52.940 --> 2:52:58.940]  For instance, well, what could they do today with CGI technology and deep fake videos and the Internet?
[2:52:58.940 --> 2:53:06.940]  People are running out shooting water towers because they had three legs like the tripod alien craft from Mars.
[2:53:06.940 --> 2:53:14.940]  Yeah, exactly right. I mean, they have everyone from Adam Schiff on there and everyone from the media matter.
[2:53:14.940 --> 2:53:18.940]  Everything openly caught putting out fake transcripts.
[2:53:18.940 --> 2:53:20.940]  Don't get in trouble.
[2:53:20.940 --> 2:53:21.940]  Exactly right.
[2:53:21.940 --> 2:53:22.940]  So what is the big event?
[2:53:22.940 --> 2:53:27.940]  What is it when they try to unite the world under their global government, the new world order?
[2:53:27.940 --> 2:53:34.940]  That's what I'm fearful of because they're trying to control information and then they're trying to manipulate it to whatever they want it.
[2:53:34.940 --> 2:53:40.940]  I totally agree. What is their trick up their sleeve against the Liberty movement worldwide and against nationalists and people like Trump?
[2:53:40.940 --> 2:53:44.940]  What would they pull? Great point, sir. Thank you for holding. God bless you.
[2:53:44.940 --> 2:53:46.940]  Okay, let's go to the caller here.
[2:53:46.940 --> 2:53:52.940]  Let's talk to Jason in North Carolina. Jason, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:53:52.940 --> 2:54:03.940]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, there's thank you for having me on, sir. You know, there's there's no doubt that the corporate social media intelligence complex is up to its, you know,
[2:54:03.940 --> 2:54:07.940]  old shenanigans, which it has been for for decades.
[2:54:07.940 --> 2:54:14.940]  But I've been listener since 08. And I remember the first time I heard you. You were on George Norris show.
[2:54:14.940 --> 2:54:21.940]  At least I think it was Norris back then and a subprime mortgage back derivative thing had just blown up.
[2:54:21.940 --> 2:54:32.940]  And I remember listening to you and I've listened to you every day since and I just want to thank you and tell you that you're an unalloyed patriot and an unalloyed Liberty.
[2:54:32.940 --> 2:54:46.940]  So, brother, I want to thank you because without you guys, I'm not on the air. And what's scary is info wars really on a lot of our big victories can be traced back as the reason we've had success.
[2:54:46.940 --> 2:54:57.940]  So that's why info wars are so precious. And it's why their dirty tricks to shut us down must be dealt with. And that's why funding is so critical to not just do what people see on the surface,
[2:54:57.940 --> 2:55:12.940]  but other things. So if they're successful shutting info wars down, legally lawfully 100%, there are other vehicles and other things where I can still be on the air separate from their attacks.
[2:55:12.940 --> 2:55:26.940]  And so without getting too much into the plan, they're not shutting crap down. It's just that I'm on top of things having to work with others and other folks so that it's not even Alex Jones
[2:55:26.940 --> 2:55:42.940]  to build whole new systems. Because, you know, that's that's what you got to do in a war is they think they're attacking the ship. They sink the ship. All of a sudden over the horizon, three more come cruising over, updated, fully loaded, ready for the attack.
[2:55:42.940 --> 2:55:51.940]  And we just blow the bugles and it's going to absolutely. I mean, use the Star Wars analogy. It's like they blow up one Death Star and like two more come swinging around the side of the planet.
[2:55:51.940 --> 2:56:05.940]  I could be too happy at that point. Well, sir, we, you know, it's a scary time. And, you know, there's no doubt I'm a coward. I have spoken to people a lot, you know, over the years.
[2:56:05.940 --> 2:56:19.940]  If you don't mind, I'll make it quick, but I'll tell you what I've been doing. I try to find some more common ground with people because everything is so hostile and divisive at this point in the history of our country and our society in the world that
[2:56:19.940 --> 2:56:29.940]  talking to people is a delicate process now. I mean, you can't just talk about things anymore. So I'll tell you two things that I say and then I'll hang up and listen to your thoughts.
[2:56:29.940 --> 2:56:41.940]  I usually start off by saying, you know, we're the US is $23 trillion in debt, roughly. At least that's what they admit to. I mean, you know, the real numbers probably classified.
[2:56:41.940 --> 2:56:57.940]  And, you know, I say we got there with career bureaucrats who've been there for good chunks of their adult lives, calling themselves public servants, but in reality, enriching themselves in the district of corruption and collusion.
[2:56:57.940 --> 2:57:08.940]  We clearly need term limits than most people. They don't disagree with that, no matter what their political bent is, they don't disagree. And it's a good way to segue into real discussion.
[2:57:08.940 --> 2:57:27.940]  The other thing I say is, you know, as far as the climate goes, which is a very sensitive topic, and I say, listen, they've detonated, you know, the equivalent of at least 30,000 Hiroshima's in the atmosphere over the last 40 years that they admit to.
[2:57:27.940 --> 2:57:33.940]  And I also say to them, I said, you know, the Chinese, when they had the Olympics, they're in Beijing. They didn't want it.
[2:57:33.940 --> 2:57:40.940]  Hold on. Hour number four is only two minutes away. I'm going to write back to you, Jason, and everybody else. And then I'm getting to those reports. Stay with us.
[2:58:03.940 --> 2:58:14.940]  The writers, the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper. There is no top, there is no bottom. We are a family in this fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:58:14.940 --> 2:58:24.940]  And the stakes have never been higher. That's what the globalists want to take us out of the game. Only you keep M4 Wars in the game. You are the M4 War.
[2:58:24.940 --> 2:58:37.940]  And now this Christmas and come up to the end of the year is the time to spend your money at m4warstore.com to fund us into this next critical year of 2020 while getting great products that make your life and your family's life a lot better.

[2:59:18.940 --> 2:59:28.940]  You see, we have to make the effort. 110% God will finish the move. And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack. I want to attack. I want to go after the globalists.
[2:59:28.940 --> 2:59:40.940]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game. I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family.
[2:59:40.940 --> 3:00:03.940]  Because we're in this together. m4warstore.com.
[3:00:10.940 --> 3:00:23.940]  And man, every caller has been like as good a caller as we get during a week. It's just been platinum callers today.
[3:00:23.940 --> 3:00:32.940]  And we're going to continue that into the new year. And we're going to have shows there that I do five days a week where we're going to take calls.
[3:00:32.940 --> 3:00:45.940]  And on top of this syndicated radio TV show over TV stations radio stations pick us up. There's going to be at least for radio 1415 minutes of ads for TV. It's about 10 minutes.
[3:00:45.940 --> 3:00:48.940]  And but I'm going to do some there just for the internet.
[3:00:48.940 --> 3:00:51.940]  Also be available and satellite stations want them.
[3:00:51.940 --> 3:00:58.940]  And I mean, I'm going to go up to about five to six hours of broadcast today in 2020.
[3:00:58.940 --> 3:01:04.940]  On the ground, I mean, we're just a lot of times to we have the money to do stuff.
[3:01:04.940 --> 3:01:09.940]  But then it's spending the time to find where to spend it.
[3:01:09.940 --> 3:01:15.940]  And, you know, do you have the people that will go out and actually take action. So this is such a critical 307 days right now.
[3:01:15.940 --> 3:01:19.940]  And then just even after that's going to be critical such an amazing time to be alive right now.
[3:01:19.940 --> 3:01:22.940]  And here we are in 2019 together.
[3:01:22.940 --> 3:01:28.940]  So, Jason, you were finishing up. Go ahead and finish up.
[3:01:28.940 --> 3:01:37.940]  Yes. So, you know, I say to people, I'm like, you know, the Chinese when they had the Olympics, they didn't want it to rain on the day of the opening ceremonies.
[3:01:37.940 --> 3:01:46.940]  And I remember reading an article about that at the time and they went into some detail, not a lot about how they made sure that it didn't rain that day.
[3:01:46.940 --> 3:01:48.940]  You know, you're talking about thousands.
[3:01:48.940 --> 3:01:52.940]  Yeah, they go on the news and say Alex Jones is insane. Everybody's insane. There's no chemtrailing.
[3:01:52.940 --> 3:01:57.940]  Then you turn on C-SPAN. They're giving total details of the CIA of how they control the weather.
[3:01:57.940 --> 3:01:59.940]  And yeah, exactly.
[3:01:59.940 --> 3:02:05.940]  Yeah. And, you know, I'll tell you, I really do because you're not bringing anything up but a real story.
[3:02:05.940 --> 3:02:15.940]  And I'll tell you, even some very, you know, close minded people on this topic, I can see them look at me and say, really?
[3:02:15.940 --> 3:02:22.940]  Well, yeah, I mean, they were doing that back then. I mean, if they can do that, what's going on with the rest of the weather?
[3:02:22.940 --> 3:02:29.940]  I mean, if they can modify the climate to their liking, you know, on one day, what else is going on?
[3:02:29.940 --> 3:02:35.940]  What's going on in the atmosphere? Again, you combine that with all the nuclear testing and the harps and the spraying.
[3:02:35.940 --> 3:02:40.940]  I mean, sir, to me it's a no-brainer, but thank you for having me on, Alex.
[3:02:40.940 --> 3:02:51.940]  Well, thank you, brother. And I think it's different strokes for different folks for the old saying that different people make the world go round.
[3:02:51.940 --> 3:02:55.940]  I agree that the kind and general approach is great with a lot of people.
[3:02:55.940 --> 3:03:00.940]  They'll kind of agree with you at the minute, but then move on just because they're not really conscious.
[3:03:00.940 --> 3:03:08.940]  I think talking to people about their consciousness and about how studies show more and more people are at a near daydreaming state,
[3:03:08.940 --> 3:03:14.940]  whether they're not really awake, I think that's really, really important to do.
[3:03:14.940 --> 3:03:23.940]  And that's what I try to do as much as I can is just get people out of the trance state and kind of hit them with a 2x4.
[3:03:23.940 --> 3:03:29.940]  And just point out, hey, you're being conned, you're being manipulated, and that's not a victimization.
[3:03:29.940 --> 3:03:35.940]  That's not to say you're a loser. Wouldn't you like to know about the real world going on?
[3:03:35.940 --> 3:03:39.940]  And wouldn't that be empowering? And, you know, you're not supposed to know this.
[3:03:39.940 --> 3:03:43.940]  They're trying to keep you from stuff. Don't you want to know what you're not supposed to know about?
[3:03:43.940 --> 3:03:45.940]  And a lot of people have this selfishness.
[3:03:45.940 --> 3:03:50.940]  They think, well, if I don't know what I don't care, I'm having a better life.
[3:03:50.940 --> 3:03:54.940]  And that's really a very, very evil position to be in.
[3:03:54.940 --> 3:03:57.940]  And statistically, those are not very happy people.
[3:03:57.940 --> 3:04:03.940]  They get neurological disorders at a higher rate than other people, and their selfishness kills them.
[3:04:03.940 --> 3:04:07.940]  So laziness and selfishness kills you. It kills you.
[3:04:07.940 --> 3:04:14.940]  And so that's my message to people is when they're smart ass, jackasses, and mentally lazy,
[3:04:14.940 --> 3:04:18.940]  I get right in their face like a drill sergeant, and I tell them how the cow ate the cabbage.
[3:04:18.940 --> 3:04:22.940]  But as you said, it's also good to do it from the smooth position.
[3:04:22.940 --> 3:04:27.940]  And I don't think that's cowardly. I think however God leads you to do something the way you should do it.
[3:04:27.940 --> 3:04:33.940]  As for me, full frontal assault, because I want to get people out of the trance.
[3:04:33.940 --> 3:04:38.940]  So I'm kind of special option around doing things.
[3:04:38.940 --> 3:04:44.940]  You know, sure, I might get a lot done with some people, but I want the big spectacle of the full-on assault of the globalist.
[3:04:44.940 --> 3:04:58.940]  And then if I beat them great, if I get blown up the process, well, that makes a big light in the sky for everybody to come to the fight.
[3:04:58.940 --> 3:05:04.940]  Well, here we are in the year 2020. And old friends are not forgotten.
[3:05:04.940 --> 3:05:08.940]  You the patriots have kept him for wars on the air. Thank you so much.
[3:05:08.940 --> 3:05:15.940]  I don't want the globalist to win for my children's future, for your children's future, but also I just personally don't want them to be able to shut us down.
[3:05:15.940 --> 3:05:18.940]  And thanks to you spreading the word and buying the products, we are able to stay on air.

[3:05:45.940 --> 3:06:02.940]  But whatever you do, remember, 2020 is a critical year, so everybody get the word out and fight for freedom.
[3:06:02.940 --> 3:06:12.940]  Live, raw and unfiltered. It's the Alex Jones Show.
[3:06:12.940 --> 3:06:19.940]  Okay, I promise to really try to give you my view on the situation with the embassy being attacked.
[3:06:19.940 --> 3:06:21.940]  It's such a big deal in my view.
[3:06:21.940 --> 3:06:27.940]  And on the gun grabbing and on the season of false flags and how I know they're going to hit us because they've already hit us that way.
[3:06:27.940 --> 3:06:31.940]  And they're now pheromoning out the message.
[3:06:31.940 --> 3:06:35.940]  So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to take calls at the bottom of the hour that I'm going to stop there.
[3:06:35.940 --> 3:06:44.940]  The number to join us is 877-789-2539. 877-789-2539. We got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten callers on the line.
[3:06:44.940 --> 3:06:47.940]  I'm going to try to get to at least all of those.
[3:06:47.940 --> 3:06:53.940]  And then if more are on the line, I will take those when I'm done covering those topics here in the fourth hour.
[3:06:53.940 --> 3:07:00.940]  Again, thank you all for joining us. Please don't forget that the biggest sales of our history are going on right now.
[3:07:00.940 --> 3:07:03.940]  And when these are over, we'll never have them as big again.
[3:07:03.940 --> 3:07:06.940]  Unless I guess we're totally having to shut down this operation.
[3:07:06.940 --> 3:07:15.940]  Because I'm selling out of even our best sellers and inventory so that I don't have inventory tax, which is the state of Texas has.
[3:07:15.940 --> 3:07:19.940]  It's called a franchise tax. There's also a federal tax. It's a lot of money we don't have.
[3:07:19.940 --> 3:07:22.940]  So we're trying to sell out of almost everything here at the end of the year.
[3:07:22.940 --> 3:07:30.940]  We've done a pretty good job, but a lot of these items that are just super, super low and a lot of them are going to sell out for months until new items come in.
[3:07:30.940 --> 3:07:33.940]  And then the biggest sale we're going to have off is 40%.
[3:07:33.940 --> 3:07:41.940]  Because when I offer 50% off on the new toothpaste, the whitening toothpaste, I mean, we're not making any money.
[3:07:41.940 --> 3:07:43.940]  We're making like 7% on it or something.
[3:07:43.940 --> 3:07:47.940]  When I offer super blue at 50% off, we're making like $2.
[3:07:47.940 --> 3:07:49.940]  And we're selling a ton of it.
[3:07:49.940 --> 3:07:56.940]  I mean, hey, 500 tubes of toothpaste today, but at sale, you're making like $3,000 or something.
[3:07:56.940 --> 3:08:00.940]  And that does not pay for infrastructure and crew and all the rest of it.
[3:08:00.940 --> 3:08:03.940]  So I'm not bitching. I didn't come to this as a business model.
[3:08:03.940 --> 3:08:05.940]  I'm like, hey, fluoride toothpaste is really bad for people.
[3:08:05.940 --> 3:08:07.940]  Coitle, silver iodine and tea tree oil is great.
[3:08:07.940 --> 3:08:10.940]  My dad's a dentist and we can go out and get top firms to make it.
[3:08:10.940 --> 3:08:22.940]  But if I scaled up to millions of tubes that I can get toothpaste made high quality for a buck of tube, you know, the stuff they make is like 20 cents of tubes, total crap in it.
[3:08:22.940 --> 3:08:32.940]  But for us at scalability, selling tens of thousands of tubes, you know, it's costing us three, four bucks, five bucks, depending on the toothpaste, six bucks a tube because it doesn't have fillers and crap in it.
[3:08:32.940 --> 3:08:37.940]  And then we're selling it to you, you know, for 1995 that we're discounting it normally to like $12.
[3:08:37.940 --> 3:08:42.940]  And, you know, you're making five bucks, six bucks, it doesn't pay for things.
[3:08:42.940 --> 3:08:47.940]  And then if you discount to 50%, you're making two, three bucks, it just doesn't float the boat.
[3:08:47.940 --> 3:08:54.940]  And I'm not bitching at you. It's just we can't go below 40% at our best sales next year when new stuff comes in.
[3:08:54.940 --> 3:09:00.940]  So the 50 to 75% off the store wide free shipping with double patriot points.
[3:09:00.940 --> 3:09:05.940]  I've never really done marketing. I just sell things that I know are great than I like.
[3:09:05.940 --> 3:09:16.940]  And I had marketers come through and people explained to me and folks like Dr. Group and they said, listen, when you always discount stuff 30, 40%, then you do 50% and then you do free shipping all the time.
[3:09:16.940 --> 3:09:22.940]  You're not Amazon with the scalability. You look, you're making all this money, but you're not keeping any of it to paper things.
[3:09:22.940 --> 3:09:33.940]  You have these huge numbers of oaths, $30 million of products sold, but you can't operate on $10 million with this infrastructure held a bandwidth millions a year.
[3:09:33.940 --> 3:09:44.940]  And so great job, folks. You're buying a ton of toothpaste. You're buying a lot of stuff, but we cannot continue to sell stuff where it's only making 20, 30%.
[3:09:44.940 --> 3:09:50.940]  We've got to sell it where it's making 100%, which is normally a low markup to operate.
[3:09:50.940 --> 3:09:53.940]  And I know people that own businesses understand that.
[3:09:53.940 --> 3:09:57.940]  So I would take advantage of this sale right now and stock up on things.
[3:09:57.940 --> 3:10:02.940]  And please, products you really like, sign up for auto ship, this will tip the sun off, share it with friends and family.
[3:10:02.940 --> 3:10:06.940]  Please get them to use it. Please get them to be listeners. And I want to thank you all.
[3:10:06.940 --> 3:10:08.940]  I'm not bishing at you. I want to thank you.
[3:10:08.940 --> 3:10:14.940]  I'm just telling you that I don't want after the election to lay off a bunch of our crew because there's bigger fights coming after that.
[3:10:14.940 --> 3:10:16.940]  I want to keep him full wars in the game.
[3:10:16.940 --> 3:10:23.940]  And again, with all the attacks we're under and things that are going on that I won't spend time on, extra money is critical.
[3:10:23.940 --> 3:10:27.940]  And so I'm doing a lot of things to make sure that happens.
[3:10:27.940 --> 3:10:32.940]  We're not going to go anywhere. It's just I want to be effective. I want to see our reporters on the ground.
[3:10:32.940 --> 3:10:37.940]  I want to see those big game changers that trigger other people to take action continuing.
[3:10:37.940 --> 3:10:44.940]  So take advantage of the big sales right now in full war store.com or triple A two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[3:10:44.940 --> 3:10:46.940]  Plus, they're amazing products you really need.
[3:10:46.940 --> 3:10:52.940]  All right, up next is Danny and Oregon.
[3:10:52.940 --> 3:10:55.940]  Danny, thanks for holding.
[3:10:55.940 --> 3:10:57.940]  Hey, Alex. Good to talk to you, man.
[3:10:57.940 --> 3:10:58.940]  Good to talk to you, brother.
[3:10:58.940 --> 3:11:01.940]  It's been a heck of a time trying to get a hold of you, man.
[3:11:01.940 --> 3:11:03.940]  Well, you're here, brother. Here it is.
[3:11:03.940 --> 3:11:07.940]  Forces of evil did not want me to get all the have been trying for weeks.
[3:11:07.940 --> 3:11:16.940]  So just want to say before I get into the point I wanted to make that I just recently got the eight pack power stack.
[3:11:16.940 --> 3:11:17.940]  Yes.
[3:11:17.940 --> 3:11:22.940]  And, you know, I was, I was on anti-depressants.
[3:11:22.940 --> 3:11:24.940]  You know, I'd always been really against that stuff.
[3:11:24.940 --> 3:11:30.940]  And I got to a really low point and, you know, I let him convince me that, hey, you know, it's worth a shot.
[3:11:30.940 --> 3:11:38.940]  And, you know, I decided when I got the eight pack power stack that I was going to drop the anti-depressants.
[3:11:38.940 --> 3:11:42.940]  Just trust in the, you know, natural formulas.
[3:11:42.940 --> 3:11:45.940]  And I'll be honest for about two or three days.
[3:11:45.940 --> 3:11:47.940]  You know, I felt really tired.
[3:11:47.940 --> 3:11:48.940]  My head hurt a lot.
[3:11:48.940 --> 3:11:55.940]  But once I got through that, about two or three days felt just tremendously better.
[3:11:55.940 --> 3:11:58.940]  You know, just a miracle.
[3:11:58.940 --> 3:12:02.940]  So I want to thank you for that and let anybody listen, we'll get to your point.
[3:12:02.940 --> 3:12:04.940]  But sir, this is important to elaborate on this.
[3:12:04.940 --> 3:12:08.940]  I don't know how the physiology and how the metabolic things completely work.
[3:12:08.940 --> 3:12:17.940]  But that's what Dr. Group, when he was promoting iodine to me eight, nine years ago, and then we came out with the cleanest best iodine out there from Deep Earth Crystals X2.
[3:12:17.940 --> 3:12:24.940]  He explained, he said, listen, when you haven't had enough iodine, your body uses the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine bromide for that whole family.
[3:12:24.940 --> 3:12:31.940]  And about two, three weeks into it, you're going to feel really toxic, really sluggish for four or five days on average.
[3:12:31.940 --> 3:12:34.940]  And he described what happened to my guts, what happened to my skin.
[3:12:34.940 --> 3:12:35.940]  It all happened.
[3:12:35.940 --> 3:12:37.940]  All this stuff started coming out.
[3:12:37.940 --> 3:12:42.940]  Let's just say, like in Ace Ventura, when he comes out of the bathroom, he's like, you know, don't go in there.
[3:12:42.940 --> 3:12:43.940]  That happened about three weeks in.
[3:12:43.940 --> 3:12:45.940]  Like he said, I felt like crap for almost a week.
[3:12:45.940 --> 3:12:55.940]  Then it was like when I've carried my kids on my shoulders up a big long, like Mount Benel, fly to stairs, you know, 200, 300 steps.
[3:12:55.940 --> 3:12:58.940]  When you take them off your shoulders, you feel like you're flying.
[3:12:58.940 --> 3:13:06.940]  And that was the feeling once I just got that key element, pushing the bad ones out and getting into my glands.
[3:13:06.940 --> 3:13:07.940]  It was incredible.
[3:13:07.940 --> 3:13:08.940]  So yes, exactly.
[3:13:08.940 --> 3:13:17.940]  The first time I drank a bunch of spirulina when I was in college, I was in good shape, then I felt horrible for a day or two, then felt great after.
[3:13:17.940 --> 3:13:25.940]  Because it's got so many vitamins and minerals that you never really had that actually get into your blood because it's brought in there, you know, via a biological vehicle.
[3:13:25.940 --> 3:13:26.940]  So I say, I don't know about the science.
[3:13:26.940 --> 3:13:31.940]  I know quite a bit about it, but not as much as scientists themselves actually studying the very mechanisms.
[3:13:31.940 --> 3:13:33.940]  But I know the general systems of how it works.
[3:13:33.940 --> 3:13:39.940]  But absolutely, eight pack power stack is 13 pills to take in the morning and the evening that covers everything.
[3:13:39.940 --> 3:13:45.940]  And yeah, when your body is using toxic things in its metabolic actions, because it'll use whatever it has.
[3:13:45.940 --> 3:13:51.940]  Then when that good stuff comes in and pushes it out, that's why I've warned people that these products aren't fillers.
[3:13:51.940 --> 3:13:52.940]  These aren't jokes.
[3:13:52.940 --> 3:13:54.940]  X2, X3, eight pack power stack.
[3:13:54.940 --> 3:13:56.940]  These are not games.
[3:13:56.940 --> 3:14:03.940]  So describe how long it took and what happened and what it felt like for us and then we'll hold you over to your political stuff.
[3:14:03.940 --> 3:14:11.940]  But I want to be able to hear this because this is exactly what happens with real things that people need.
[3:14:11.940 --> 3:14:12.940]  Well, sure.
[3:14:12.940 --> 3:14:24.940]  So, you know, it only took, I mean, I want to say, you know, when I got to the point where I was literally down to not having any of the antidepressants in my system anymore.
[3:14:24.940 --> 3:14:26.940]  That was when it really took a couple of days.
[3:14:26.940 --> 3:14:31.940]  But, you know, of course, you know, that stuff is very dangerous.
[3:14:31.940 --> 3:14:33.940]  You know, I'm sad that I was ever on it.
[3:14:33.940 --> 3:14:36.940]  I'm glad that I'm getting off of it or I'm off of it now.
[3:14:36.940 --> 3:14:38.940]  Oh, the side effects are just unbelievable.
[3:14:38.940 --> 3:14:40.940]  Unbelievable of the antidepressants.
[3:14:40.940 --> 3:14:42.940]  I've been cold turkey.
[3:14:42.940 --> 3:14:43.940]  It's very dangerous.
[3:14:43.940 --> 3:14:49.940]  So, you know, I tapered myself down pretty quickly and I just added in the eight pack power stack.
[3:14:49.940 --> 3:14:53.940]  I take the X2 and X3 kind of interchange them.
[3:14:53.940 --> 3:15:01.940]  You know, every other couple of days just to get the different formulas and different types of iodine, you know, formulas in my system.
[3:15:01.940 --> 3:15:07.940]  I've got the toothpaste, you know, the company whitening toothpaste cutting out all fluoride.
[3:15:07.940 --> 3:15:14.940]  And, you know, the combination just trying to make it much of a healthy turn in my life.
[3:15:14.940 --> 3:15:17.940]  And I work out every day all at once.
[3:15:17.940 --> 3:15:25.940]  You know, to me, it's always the fastest way to get turn things around if you're addicted to something or you're on some kind of.
[3:15:25.940 --> 3:15:28.940]  So, you're saying it was probably going off the antidepressants that made you feel like crap.
[3:15:28.940 --> 3:15:36.940]  I was just saying when I finally got really good vitamins and minerals and good elements into me that I hadn't had, I went through a detoxing phase.
[3:15:36.940 --> 3:15:42.940]  But it sounded like what you're saying is it was that you were going off of those and then it was the eight pack power stack.
[3:15:42.940 --> 3:15:44.940]  Other things that helped you transition off.
[3:15:44.940 --> 3:15:48.940]  Are you saying that you felt a lot better once you did do that?
[3:15:48.940 --> 3:15:51.940]  Yeah, I mean, it was a good couple of days.
[3:15:51.940 --> 3:15:52.940]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:52.940 --> 3:15:56.940]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:56.940 --> 3:15:57.940]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:15:57.940 --> 3:16:00.940]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:00.940 --> 3:16:06.940]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:06.940 --> 3:16:07.940]  I can help you too.

[3:18:49.940 --> 3:19:18.940]  We're fighting to win and we are winning. Thanks to you.
[3:19:19.940 --> 3:19:21.940]  I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[3:19:21.940 --> 3:19:26.940]  I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[3:19:26.940 --> 3:19:29.940]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[3:19:29.940 --> 3:19:31.940]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me.
[3:19:31.940 --> 3:19:34.940]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[3:19:34.940 --> 3:19:36.940]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[3:19:36.940 --> 3:19:38.940]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me.
[3:19:38.940 --> 3:19:41.940]  I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[3:19:41.940 --> 3:19:44.940]  I want to take control of my health. And that's why you need to go to infowars.com.
[3:19:44.940 --> 3:19:46.940]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[3:19:46.940 --> 3:19:49.940]  Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the turbo force.
[3:19:49.940 --> 3:19:54.940]  Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good.
[3:19:54.940 --> 3:20:18.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:18.940 --> 3:20:36.940]  The sun no longer sets me free. Listen to the songs of the Satanists.
[3:20:36.940 --> 3:20:40.940]  Well, guess what? The sun sets me free.
[3:20:40.940 --> 3:20:48.940]  Now, I'm not a sun worshiper, but I sure see God's handiwork in that big old ball of fire.
[3:20:48.940 --> 3:20:52.940]  It gives us life on this planet.
[3:20:52.940 --> 3:21:00.940]  The dark doesn't scare me. And the sun, it does set me free.
[3:21:00.940 --> 3:21:05.940]  Snowblind, I'm not saying Ozzy Osbourne's actually a devil worshiper. He's not.
[3:21:05.940 --> 3:21:09.940]  All those guys get ordered to do all that Satanism crap, try to make money,
[3:21:09.940 --> 3:21:11.940]  and then later they go back to God.
[3:21:11.940 --> 3:21:15.940]  Most people at Metallica are Christians. Dave Mustaine's a Christian and Megadeth.
[3:21:15.940 --> 3:21:20.940]  Almost all those guys are like scared to death of Satanism because they've been around it and they've seen it.
[3:21:20.940 --> 3:21:29.940]  But it's the producers and the bosses above them. Oh, our devil worshippers, let me tell you.
[3:21:29.940 --> 3:21:32.940]  It's like Mark Dice has told the story here on air and it's true story.
[3:21:32.940 --> 3:21:36.940]  I know the production company. They tried to hire me as well.
[3:21:36.940 --> 3:21:46.940]  They called them in. They said, you've got the show, Big National Show, with a famous rock star.
[3:21:46.940 --> 3:21:51.940]  I think Mark's even said the rock band. It was Motley Crue.
[3:21:51.940 --> 3:21:54.940]  About 10 years ago, they said, we just want you to pledge yourself to Lucifer.
[3:21:54.940 --> 3:22:03.940]  It wasn't Motley Crue doing this. It was the producer at the arguably the largest reality TV show production network.
[3:22:03.940 --> 3:22:08.940]  Let's just say I was actually on a show with them. I was actually paid by them,
[3:22:08.940 --> 3:22:11.940]  but they didn't ask me to pledge myself to Lucifer or anything.
[3:22:11.940 --> 3:22:15.940]  But they did want me to get into some cookie stuff and then be the host of the show.
[3:22:15.940 --> 3:22:18.940]  I'll just say it was when Ventura wasn't going to do it anymore.
[3:22:18.940 --> 3:22:23.940]  They wanted me to do it, but be like kind of like Joe Rogan did a series that was kind of making fun of Kim Trails and all that.
[3:22:23.940 --> 3:22:27.940]  That's when Joe kind of changed over when he did that big series.
[3:22:27.940 --> 3:22:29.940]  That was a different production company, though.
[3:22:29.940 --> 3:22:35.940]  But it was the same company. But yeah, folks from that called old Mark Dyson and said,
[3:22:35.940 --> 3:22:38.940]  just want you to pledge yourself to Lucifer.
[3:22:38.940 --> 3:22:44.940]  In fact, a lot of those folks are so arrogant. They never even said keep it secret.
[3:22:44.940 --> 3:22:49.940]  Maybe I should just tell people more on there.
[3:22:49.940 --> 3:22:51.940]  Pretty amazing.
[3:22:51.940 --> 3:22:55.940]  Okay, let's go back to your calls.
[3:22:55.940 --> 3:23:00.940]  Danny, what else was it you were going to add, my friend?
[3:23:00.940 --> 3:23:02.940]  Hey, thanks for coming back to me, Alex.
[3:23:02.940 --> 3:23:06.940]  So, yeah, I, you know, I, like I said, I've been trying to get a hold of you for weeks.
[3:23:06.940 --> 3:23:09.940]  And I feel like, you know, it's just persistence.
[3:23:09.940 --> 3:23:12.940]  I think the devil is really trying to put all of us down.
[3:23:12.940 --> 3:23:14.940]  Well, you're on the air now, brother.
[3:23:14.940 --> 3:23:25.940]  Okay. So, you know, I just wanted to say that I would love to go to bat for you and for Encore Wars.
[3:23:25.940 --> 3:23:27.940]  I live in Portland now.
[3:23:27.940 --> 3:23:30.940]  But I, you know, I'm getting ready to, you know, move out of the city.
[3:23:30.940 --> 3:23:33.940]  I feel like a lot being called out of Gomorrah.
[3:23:33.940 --> 3:23:36.940]  Yeah, just don't look back.
[3:23:36.940 --> 3:23:39.940]  I don't want to look back. Yeah.
[3:23:39.940 --> 3:23:44.940]  So, you know, I'd put my two weeks in and head back to Austin today if you guys want me to.
[3:23:44.940 --> 3:23:49.940]  You know, I got offered, you know, I have a degree in public relations.
[3:23:49.940 --> 3:23:52.940]  And I currently am a service department manager.
[3:23:52.940 --> 3:23:54.940]  I work on computers.
[3:23:54.940 --> 3:23:58.940]  I've got a lot of different skills, but I've been trying to get together.
[3:23:58.940 --> 3:24:01.940]  Well, have you sent a resume or an example to jobs at Encore Wars?
[3:24:01.940 --> 3:24:06.940]  Oh, I have. I think I got it in within about 10 minutes of the day you announced it.
[3:24:06.940 --> 3:24:10.940]  Well, brother, we will look at it and I, and I appreciate it.
[3:24:10.940 --> 3:24:16.940]  If you don't have three examples of your work as video work, explain that in there and then say what it is you think you could do.
[3:24:16.940 --> 3:24:21.940]  Because that's the way Rob do screams people out as if they don't follow the way he said bring it in.
[3:24:21.940 --> 3:24:25.940]  But yes, everybody should send your resumes, whatever you're good at, let us know.
[3:24:25.940 --> 3:24:29.940]  We don't have a lot of money to deal with, but we're trying to hire more people.
[3:24:29.940 --> 3:24:32.940]  And that's what it comes down to.
[3:24:32.940 --> 3:24:34.940]  So thank you very much.
[3:24:34.940 --> 3:24:38.940]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Jeremy who disagrees.
[3:24:38.940 --> 3:24:41.940]  Jeremy, thank you calling from California.
[3:24:41.940 --> 3:24:51.940]  Yeah, hey man, I've been listening to you for quite some time and it's a remarkable day when you and John Bolton are on the same page with regard to what's going on in Iraq.
[3:24:51.940 --> 3:25:03.940]  And, you know, it's like, I mean, Alex, what does Trump have to do to get you to, you know, maybe get indignant mad at him?
[3:25:03.940 --> 3:25:07.940]  I mean, this is the same playbook that's been going on for a long time.
[3:25:07.940 --> 3:25:11.940]  He's been a massing troops in that region for this entire year.
[3:25:11.940 --> 3:25:14.940]  Now they're hitting critical math.
[3:25:14.940 --> 3:25:17.940]  They're looking for an excuse to go in and hit Iran.
[3:25:17.940 --> 3:25:19.940]  Kushner is their link to Israel.
[3:25:19.940 --> 3:25:22.940]  I mean, come on, man, what's it going to show?
[3:25:22.940 --> 3:25:25.940]  It's okay for Iran to overrun and attack our embassy.
[3:25:25.940 --> 3:25:29.940]  Well, go ahead and repeat mainstream media talking point.
[3:25:29.940 --> 3:25:31.940]  You're doing exactly what.
[3:25:31.940 --> 3:25:33.940]  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you okay?
[3:25:33.940 --> 3:25:36.940]  So you're saying that's fake video, CG, deep fake?
[3:25:36.940 --> 3:25:37.940]  How do you know?
[3:25:37.940 --> 3:25:39.940]  Why don't you talk to Syrian girl?
[3:25:39.940 --> 3:25:41.940]  She's got a completely different take from the region than you do.
[3:25:41.940 --> 3:25:43.940]  Well, I mean, here, don't get mad at me.
[3:25:43.940 --> 3:25:44.940]  I do have fake.
[3:25:44.940 --> 3:25:47.940]  Let's get Syrian girl on in the next few days.
[3:25:47.940 --> 3:25:48.940]  That's a great idea.
[3:25:48.940 --> 3:25:50.940]  We have Syrian girl on.
[3:25:50.940 --> 3:25:52.940]  I don't know why we haven't gotten her on in a while.
[3:25:52.940 --> 3:25:53.940]  We need to get her on.
[3:25:53.940 --> 3:25:56.940]  And that's a great idea.
[3:25:56.940 --> 3:26:00.940]  But when an embassy gets attacked, we need to defend it.
[3:26:00.940 --> 3:26:02.940]  We need to defend it.
[3:26:02.940 --> 3:26:04.940]  I don't call that war.
[3:26:04.940 --> 3:26:08.940]  And if they were able to capture and kidnap any of our personnel,
[3:26:08.940 --> 3:26:11.940]  then we'd have the same thing as 1979.
[3:26:11.940 --> 3:26:13.940]  And that would start a war with Iran.
[3:26:13.940 --> 3:26:14.940]  So let me ask you this.
[3:26:14.940 --> 3:26:16.940]  And I'm being serious.
[3:26:16.940 --> 3:26:18.940]  Are you saying nobody attacked the embassy?
[3:26:18.940 --> 3:26:20.940]  Heck, no, I'm not saying that.
[3:26:20.940 --> 3:26:26.940]  What I am saying is that maybe Pompeo announcing that it was actually the U.S.
[3:26:26.940 --> 3:26:29.940]  that hit these guys over the last couple of days.
[3:26:29.940 --> 3:26:32.940]  People have maybe hit critical mass and say, you know what?
[3:26:32.940 --> 3:26:33.940]  You came in here.
[3:26:33.940 --> 3:26:37.940]  Well, I ran has been in a bunch of wars with Iraq.
[3:26:37.940 --> 3:26:42.940]  And the sea ice and cities are trying to take over and Trump and we've said no more war.
[3:26:42.940 --> 3:26:44.940]  We're trying to end that policy.
[3:26:44.940 --> 3:26:46.940]  We're not trying to start a Middle Eastern war.
[3:26:46.940 --> 3:26:49.940]  A sectarian civil war like Obama was.
[3:26:49.940 --> 3:26:56.940]  And so I legitimately do think Trump is trying to have legitimate policy.
[3:26:56.940 --> 3:26:58.940]  I think he could be lied into a war.
[3:26:58.940 --> 3:27:03.940]  It looks more like they're trying to get people captured to embarrass him like Jimmy Carter.
[3:27:03.940 --> 3:27:04.940]  What do you think?
[3:27:04.940 --> 3:27:08.940]  I think that he has surrounded himself with neocon ink.
[3:27:08.940 --> 3:27:09.940]  I mean, come on.
[3:27:09.940 --> 3:27:11.940]  Look at who his national security advisor is.
[3:27:11.940 --> 3:27:12.940]  Look at who it was.
[3:27:12.940 --> 3:27:16.940]  Look at who his secretary of state is and was.
[3:27:16.940 --> 3:27:20.940]  Look at what their what their outlook has been and look at work.
[3:27:20.940 --> 3:27:22.940]  Look at where Trump has put all his emphasis.
[3:27:22.940 --> 3:27:25.940]  Dude, we're being set up.
[3:27:25.940 --> 3:27:29.940]  Iran has been on the list for quite some time before Trump.
[3:27:29.940 --> 3:27:32.940]  But Trump is doing everything right now.
[3:27:32.940 --> 3:27:35.940]  There's no difference between him and a George W. Bush.
[3:27:35.940 --> 3:27:36.940]  Well, here's what Trump just said.
[3:27:36.940 --> 3:27:39.940]  Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many.
[3:27:39.940 --> 3:27:41.940]  We strongly responded and always will.
[3:27:41.940 --> 3:27:43.940]  Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S.
[3:27:43.940 --> 3:27:44.940]  Embassy in Iraq.
[3:27:44.940 --> 3:27:46.940]  They will be held fully responsible in addition.
[3:27:46.940 --> 3:27:49.940]  We expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the embassy.
[3:27:49.940 --> 3:27:52.940]  And so notified.
[3:27:52.940 --> 3:27:56.940]  Trump came out the day after 9 11 and said he thought there were bombs in the
[3:27:56.940 --> 3:27:57.940]  buildings.
[3:27:57.940 --> 3:28:00.940]  And he said that it looked like a controlled demolition.
[3:28:00.940 --> 3:28:03.940]  And he's well known to tell people privately that he thinks it was a big
[3:28:03.940 --> 3:28:06.940]  setup.
[3:28:06.940 --> 3:28:08.940]  You judge a tree by fruits.
[3:28:08.940 --> 3:28:11.940]  I don't think it's 9 11.
[3:28:11.940 --> 3:28:13.940]  Here to have the embassy attack.
[3:28:13.940 --> 3:28:15.940]  The main embassy.
[3:28:15.940 --> 3:28:17.940]  By Iran and by Hezbollah back groups.
[3:28:17.940 --> 3:28:19.940]  And I think that's a bad thing.
[3:28:19.940 --> 3:28:23.940]  I think Iran should not be testing the United States.
[3:28:23.940 --> 3:28:27.940]  Because Iran is running proxy wars overseas.
[3:28:27.940 --> 3:28:29.940]  I keep holding over college.
[3:28:29.940 --> 3:28:35.940]  Come back and tell me, Jeremy, how you think I'm echoing what John Bolton is
[3:28:35.940 --> 3:28:37.940]  saying.
[3:28:37.940 --> 3:28:41.940]  Because listen, I'm against starting offensive wars.
[3:28:41.940 --> 3:28:45.940]  But Iran is its own kettle of fish.
[3:28:45.940 --> 3:28:48.940]  And it's running around like it's the boss in the Middle East.
[3:28:48.940 --> 3:28:50.940]  OK.
[3:29:18.940 --> 3:29:21.940]  I'm going to tell you how much I feel.
[3:29:21.940 --> 3:29:24.940]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[3:29:24.940 --> 3:29:28.940]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product
[3:29:28.940 --> 3:29:32.940]  as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[3:30:53.940 --> 3:30:57.940]  A little less than four months ago, I made the announcement on air.
[3:30:57.940 --> 3:31:01.940]  I said, hey, I have a tendency to take the high quality supplements from
[3:31:01.940 --> 3:31:07.940]  Infowarslife for a while, get great results and then slowly I stop using them.
[3:31:07.940 --> 3:31:09.940]  I forget to religiously take them.
[3:31:09.940 --> 3:31:13.940]  I'm going to religiously take the supplements for the next few months
[3:31:13.940 --> 3:31:16.940]  and I've lost almost 40 pounds now.
[3:31:16.940 --> 3:31:17.940]  Everybody can see it on air.
[3:31:17.940 --> 3:31:19.940]  My energy is off the charts.
[3:31:19.940 --> 3:31:21.940]  Everything is amazing.
[3:31:21.940 --> 3:31:25.940]  And it's because I am taking the Infowarslife products, the krill oil.
[3:31:25.940 --> 3:31:27.940]  I'm taking the X2 and the X3.
[3:31:27.940 --> 3:31:32.940]  I'm taking the brain force plus when I work out, when I have to work really late.
[3:31:32.940 --> 3:31:34.940]  I'm taking half a pack of turbo force.
[3:31:34.940 --> 3:31:36.940]  It is clean energy.
[3:31:36.940 --> 3:31:40.940]  It is really making my whole life so much more enjoyable.
[3:31:40.940 --> 3:31:42.940]  It's making the shows more focused.
[3:31:42.940 --> 3:31:43.940]  We've got more energy.
[3:31:43.940 --> 3:31:47.940]  We have huge sales going right now for the new year at infowarslife.com.
[3:31:47.940 --> 3:31:48.940]  A big clearance sale.
[3:31:48.940 --> 3:32:13.940]  Take advantage of it all at infowarslife.com.
[3:32:13.940 --> 3:32:18.940]  It is by far the best product I've ever used in my life.
[3:32:18.940 --> 3:32:20.940]  I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now.
[3:32:20.940 --> 3:32:23.940]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery.
[3:32:23.940 --> 3:32:26.940]  And that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy
[3:32:26.940 --> 3:32:28.940]  or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[3:32:28.940 --> 3:32:29.940]  So I just want to get that out of the way.
[3:32:29.940 --> 3:32:30.940]  Support this man.
[3:32:30.940 --> 3:32:32.940]  Everything that he exposed.
[3:32:32.940 --> 3:32:33.940]  Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[3:32:33.940 --> 3:32:34.940]  Nobody knew about Epstein.
[3:32:34.940 --> 3:32:35.940]  Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[3:32:35.940 --> 3:32:37.940]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened.
[3:32:37.940 --> 3:32:40.940]  In July 2001, go look it up yourself.
[3:32:40.940 --> 3:32:43.940]  Well, we try our best, sir.
[3:32:43.940 --> 3:32:44.940]  They definitely want us off the air without you or not here.
[3:32:44.940 --> 3:32:45.940]  But yeah, these are all great products.
[3:32:45.940 --> 3:32:46.940]  So thank you, sir.
[3:32:46.940 --> 3:33:15.940]  I would thank you for everything.
[3:33:15.940 --> 3:33:18.940]  Thank you for everything you've done for the info war.
[3:33:18.940 --> 3:33:19.940]  But I know you're like me.
[3:33:19.940 --> 3:33:21.940]  You don't want my thanks.
[3:33:21.940 --> 3:33:24.940]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters.
[3:33:24.940 --> 3:33:27.940]  And you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[3:33:27.940 --> 3:33:28.940]  And you know what?
[3:33:28.940 --> 3:33:29.940]  I'm the same way.
[3:33:29.940 --> 3:33:31.940]  And that's why we're on the same damn team.
[3:33:31.940 --> 3:33:34.940]  And it's why info wars has been delivering time and time again
[3:33:34.940 --> 3:33:40.940]  when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist.
[3:33:40.940 --> 3:33:44.940]  Because I'm committed to a future for humanity.
[3:33:44.940 --> 3:33:46.940]  And I know you are as well.
[3:33:46.940 --> 3:33:49.940]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the info war.
[3:33:49.940 --> 3:33:54.940]  And I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[3:33:54.940 --> 3:33:57.940]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family and for the great crew at info wars.
[3:33:57.940 --> 3:34:00.940]  I want to thank you all because you are the info war.
[3:34:00.940 --> 3:34:02.940]  And you know that's not just words.
[3:34:02.940 --> 3:34:03.940]  That's reality.
[3:34:03.940 --> 3:34:05.940]  You have made history.
[3:34:05.940 --> 3:34:07.940]  We have made history together.
[3:34:07.940 --> 3:34:11.940]  Infowars.com only has power because of you.
[3:34:11.940 --> 3:34:16.940]  And I suggest you use it.
[3:34:16.940 --> 3:34:21.940]  Two segments left in my final broadcast of 2019.
[3:34:21.940 --> 3:34:25.940]  I'll try to go live some tonight at info wars.com.
[3:34:25.940 --> 3:34:29.940]  The live feed and ringing the new year everybody because it is a big deal 2020.
[3:34:29.940 --> 3:34:31.940]  It's not the end of the decade.
[3:34:31.940 --> 3:34:33.940]  It's the last year of the decade starting.
[3:34:33.940 --> 3:34:36.940]  But it's this this war on knowledge, the war on calendars.
[3:34:36.940 --> 3:34:41.940]  It's an obsession of the Illuminati Jacobins when you study them.
[3:34:41.940 --> 3:34:45.940]  They're obsessed with changing calendars and changing language and ending the family.
[3:34:45.940 --> 3:34:47.940]  The French Revolution was about that.
[3:34:47.940 --> 3:34:55.940]  And any real historian will tell you what the left hand path comes out of that and is a cultic.
[3:34:55.940 --> 3:34:59.940]  We're literally fighting devil worshipers.
[3:34:59.940 --> 3:35:02.940]  And I want to explain that to atheists out there.
[3:35:02.940 --> 3:35:09.940]  If you're really an atheist, because you don't believe in invisible things and you really don't like big fake churches.
[3:35:09.940 --> 3:35:12.940]  I get you 100% and I don't dislike you.
[3:35:12.940 --> 3:35:14.940]  I don't think you're a bad person.
[3:35:14.940 --> 3:35:16.940]  I totally understand.
[3:35:16.940 --> 3:35:21.940]  But you know the people up above you that teach it are devil worshipers.
[3:35:21.940 --> 3:35:23.940]  You don't understand they drink blood, right?
[3:35:23.940 --> 3:35:28.940]  I mean, I've seen it with my own two eyes.
[3:35:28.940 --> 3:35:32.940]  When I was 12, 13, 14, 15 years old.
[3:35:32.940 --> 3:35:34.940]  Okay.
[3:35:34.940 --> 3:35:38.940]  And it was so freaky that I wouldn't even tell my parents about it.
[3:35:38.940 --> 3:35:40.940]  And I would just try to get away from it.
[3:35:40.940 --> 3:35:42.940]  And it's like at the end of the lost boys.
[3:35:42.940 --> 3:35:48.940]  They're just like the grandpa shows up and it's like, man, I tell you this town's always had too many vampires in it.
[3:35:48.940 --> 3:35:52.940]  And they're not physically living forever, but it's vampires.
[3:35:52.940 --> 3:35:53.940]  Okay.
[3:35:53.940 --> 3:35:57.940]  And anybody that knows anything knows that.
[3:35:57.940 --> 3:36:00.940]  And I'm just here to tell you that I've seen it.
[3:36:00.940 --> 3:36:06.940]  I don't need to read about it in crime reports or FBI files.
[3:36:06.940 --> 3:36:08.940]  And they're trying to take over.
[3:36:08.940 --> 3:36:10.940]  And that's what's in the finders.
[3:36:10.940 --> 3:36:11.940]  Thousands of pages.
[3:36:11.940 --> 3:36:19.940]  The FBI released about two months ago is how Satanist were actively trying to take over towns all over the country.
[3:36:19.940 --> 3:36:25.940]  So you see the old Hollywood movies in the 50s and 60s and 70s where, you know, one of them was shot in central Texas.
[3:36:25.940 --> 3:36:28.940]  I think it's like called running from the devil or it's a really good old movie.
[3:36:28.940 --> 3:36:29.940]  I forget the exact name.
[3:36:29.940 --> 3:36:31.940]  Race with the devil's name.
[3:36:31.940 --> 3:36:32.940]  I've looked that up guys.
[3:36:32.940 --> 3:36:38.940]  And it's shot outside Austin and they go over a hill at night and they see a human sacrifice.
[3:36:38.940 --> 3:36:41.940]  They see a woman being willingly killed.
[3:36:41.940 --> 3:36:47.940]  And then the, you know, the devil works for seeing him and the whole rest of the movies them running through the hill country from the devil.
[3:36:47.940 --> 3:36:56.940]  Worspers. I tell you right now, there's real devil worse person out there in the hill country and top Democrats go out there and they kill people.
[3:36:56.940 --> 3:36:59.940]  I know people that have been there.
[3:36:59.940 --> 3:37:02.940]  I know women that have been there.
[3:37:02.940 --> 3:37:05.940]  And I didn't just hear this from some crazy woman.
[3:37:05.940 --> 3:37:14.940]  I heard this from a woman 20 years ago and I met another woman told me the same damn story and you wouldn't be told it unless you'd been there.
[3:37:14.940 --> 3:37:16.940]  Believe me.
[3:37:16.940 --> 3:37:19.940]  It'll curl your hair.
[3:37:19.940 --> 3:37:26.940]  Especially when you turn on TV and get to see some of the rock bands up there doing interviews.
[3:37:26.940 --> 3:37:29.940]  And that's just where I live here.
[3:37:29.940 --> 3:37:35.940]  You couldn't shake a stick where I grew up in Dallas without running into the devil worse person.
[3:37:35.940 --> 3:37:37.940]  And KKK. Oh my God.
[3:37:37.940 --> 3:37:41.940]  Let me tell you real KKK and run around in white hoods.
[3:37:41.940 --> 3:37:45.940]  No.
[3:37:45.940 --> 3:37:50.940]  And they're into controlling people based on race colliding blacks and whites together.
[3:37:50.940 --> 3:37:52.940]  It's not these people are evil man.
[3:37:52.940 --> 3:37:54.940]  I tell you.
[3:37:54.940 --> 3:37:56.940]  So I'm going to stop.
[3:37:56.940 --> 3:37:57.940]  I'm going to stop right there.
[3:37:57.940 --> 3:38:01.940]  It's just that I harp on this because the spiritual battle is so clear.
[3:38:01.940 --> 3:38:04.940]  It's out in the open now and people better make a decision.
[3:38:04.940 --> 3:38:06.940]  That's all I'm saying.
[3:38:06.940 --> 3:38:10.940]  But if you're an atheist, you're like, oh, well, sure.
[3:38:10.940 --> 3:38:15.940]  From an anthropological view, there's devil worshipers, but I'm telling you that's their operating system.
[3:38:15.940 --> 3:38:22.940]  So whether you believe in the ethereal Satan or not, it's a real manifestation through people.
[3:38:22.940 --> 3:38:24.940]  Whatever the hell it is, it's real.
[3:38:24.940 --> 3:38:29.940]  And like I said, you know, the media doesn't even do it anymore when I bring up some of these things.
[3:38:29.940 --> 3:38:30.940]  They never attacked me for what I really said.
[3:38:30.940 --> 3:38:33.940]  They always make stuff up.
[3:38:33.940 --> 3:38:35.940]  And they know I'm not B.S.
[3:38:35.940 --> 3:38:51.940]  I saw some stuff with these these devil worshipers were pulling that unless they were spraying hallucinogens into the room and had, you know, holograms or something.
[3:38:51.940 --> 3:38:53.940]  And maybe that's what was going on.
[3:38:53.940 --> 3:38:57.940]  But there's a lot of stuff going on.
[3:38:57.940 --> 3:39:02.940]  I mean, I've seen some stuff right out of a movie repeatedly.
[3:39:02.940 --> 3:39:04.940]  And I wasn't on drugs when I saw it.
[3:39:04.940 --> 3:39:06.940]  So I'm just going to leave it at that.
[3:39:06.940 --> 3:39:11.940]  Someday I might get into it, but let's just say this.
[3:39:11.940 --> 3:39:17.940]  I don't have fun going and seeing movies like it and going and seeing that stuff because that's all allegories.
[3:39:17.940 --> 3:39:19.940]  Stephen King has been led into these groups, obviously.
[3:39:19.940 --> 3:39:25.940]  And these are showing you what these towns are like and how people serve these people and what's really going on.
[3:39:25.940 --> 3:39:27.940]  And it needs to be resisted because they're hurting innocent people.
[3:39:27.940 --> 3:39:29.940]  They're targeting children.
[3:39:29.940 --> 3:39:31.940]  All right, let's go back.
[3:39:31.940 --> 3:39:33.940]  Jeremy, we could debate this all day.
[3:39:33.940 --> 3:39:36.940]  They're sitting in U.S. Special Forces into Iraq.
[3:39:36.940 --> 3:39:38.940]  There's an escalation there.
[3:39:38.940 --> 3:39:42.940]  The Shiites are throwing their weight around all over Iraq, trying to take it over.
[3:39:42.940 --> 3:39:45.940]  Trump's trying to stop a civil war between Shiites and Sunnis.
[3:39:45.940 --> 3:39:47.940]  He's got to deal with Saudi Arabia.
[3:39:47.940 --> 3:39:49.940]  I know we fetishize Israel.
[3:39:49.940 --> 3:39:51.940]  Oh, Israel doesn't like Iran, too.
[3:39:51.940 --> 3:39:52.940]  They're not going to go away.
[3:39:52.940 --> 3:39:54.940]  They've got hundreds of nuclear weapons.
[3:39:54.940 --> 3:40:01.940]  Trump is legitimately trying to stop a giant war, in my view, while trying to deal with the Chai comms that are the real threat.
[3:40:01.940 --> 3:40:05.940]  And the globalists are trying to stir things up in the Middle East to embarrass Trump.
[3:40:05.940 --> 3:40:07.940]  Now, that's my educated view on this.
[3:40:07.940 --> 3:40:10.940]  That's me as a pragmatist, not just supporting the president.
[3:40:10.940 --> 3:40:12.940]  I see what he's up against.
[3:40:12.940 --> 3:40:13.940]  What do you think?
[3:40:13.940 --> 3:40:14.940]  I don't know.
[3:40:14.940 --> 3:40:19.940]  I think the word picture you just drew is great.
[3:40:19.940 --> 3:40:20.940]  It sounds great.
[3:40:20.940 --> 3:40:25.940]  The problem is, though, is that that doesn't appear to be the case.
[3:40:25.940 --> 3:40:29.940]  It appears that we're actually being led to be the fool.
[3:40:29.940 --> 3:40:32.940]  Once again, we're going to be sold a bill of good.
[3:40:32.940 --> 3:40:45.940]  We're now, we're air striking in Iraq because of a contractor, essentially a hired merc, a blackwater guy, somebody that you actually would have said back before your relationship with Eric Prince that you would have said, hey, these guys are.
[3:40:45.940 --> 3:40:47.940]  I don't have a relationship with Eric Prince.
[3:40:47.940 --> 3:40:51.940]  Eric Prince has frontier services and works with the Chai comms.
[3:40:51.940 --> 3:40:59.940]  I know he helped expose some of the pedophile rings and I only gave credit to where some of that information came from.
[3:40:59.940 --> 3:41:02.940]  Well, OK, you've made it sound like there's a little bit more than that.
[3:41:02.940 --> 3:41:05.940]  No, I know.
[3:41:05.940 --> 3:41:07.940]  Well, you just misunderstood.
[3:41:07.940 --> 3:41:08.940]  All right, I.
[3:41:08.940 --> 3:41:11.940]  Sir, if I do anything, it's.
[3:41:11.940 --> 3:41:12.940]  Sorry, I had a tooth break off.
[3:41:12.940 --> 3:41:14.940]  It's like a spike cut in my tongue.
[3:41:14.940 --> 3:41:15.940]  It's literally bleeding right now.
[3:41:15.940 --> 3:41:16.940]  It broke last night.
[3:41:16.940 --> 3:41:17.940]  It's just something I'm dealing with.
[3:41:17.940 --> 3:41:20.940]  That's why I keep having a list.
[3:41:20.940 --> 3:41:24.940]  Sir, if I do anything, it's just throw it all out there.
[3:41:24.940 --> 3:41:26.940]  I don't get good stuff from big contacts.
[3:41:26.940 --> 3:41:28.940]  I'm not involved in spooky groups.
[3:41:28.940 --> 3:41:31.940]  And those groups don't know anything.
[3:41:31.940 --> 3:41:33.940]  Most of those groups are all compartmentalized.
[3:41:33.940 --> 3:41:36.940]  Some of the most brainwashed people are in these intelligence agencies.
[3:41:36.940 --> 3:41:39.940]  I'm just a private individual doing research.
[3:41:39.940 --> 3:41:40.940]  OK.
[3:41:40.940 --> 3:41:47.940]  OK, but listen, so you and I, you would agree that the Saudis and the Israelis have it in for Iran.
[3:41:47.940 --> 3:41:48.940]  Would you not?
[3:41:48.940 --> 3:41:52.940]  Yes, but just because Israel has some problems and the Saudi Arabians have problems,
[3:41:52.940 --> 3:41:56.940]  does it mean that we're all kissy face with Iran and they're a bunch of little sweetsies?
[3:41:56.940 --> 3:42:00.940]  Right, but you would also agree that our relationship with the Saudis,
[3:42:00.940 --> 3:42:03.940]  which there's been some stuff where we've been like, hey, Trump,
[3:42:03.940 --> 3:42:06.940]  seriously, you're going to keep this relationship tight.
[3:42:06.940 --> 3:42:07.940]  He has.
[3:42:07.940 --> 3:42:08.940]  He keeps it going.
[3:42:08.940 --> 3:42:16.940]  He's because the salt because they chopped up some some operative of the other Saudi group.
[3:42:16.940 --> 3:42:19.940]  Right, we're not even getting into that.
[3:42:19.940 --> 3:42:25.940]  Just dude, they just come in and there's all sorts of stuff they've infiltrated and they influence
[3:42:25.940 --> 3:42:28.940]  and the way that they have orchestrated things in the region.
[3:42:28.940 --> 3:42:29.940]  We're almost OK.
[3:42:29.940 --> 3:42:33.940]  So what is letting the Iranians attack the embassy do?
[3:42:33.940 --> 3:42:35.940]  OK, so what does it do?
[3:42:35.940 --> 3:42:39.940]  It allows it gives a gateway to start some action.
[3:42:39.940 --> 3:42:42.940]  So yeah, but I'm saying the Iranians are really starting stuff.
[3:42:42.940 --> 3:42:44.940]  So we have to ask, why are they doing that?
[3:42:44.940 --> 3:42:49.940]  Because they're working with the other set of diplomats from the deep state to actually embarrass Trump.
[3:42:49.940 --> 3:42:51.940]  And that's where the smart money is.
[3:42:51.940 --> 3:43:03.940]  Well, here we are in the year 2020 and old friends are not forgotten.
[3:43:03.940 --> 3:43:06.940]  You the patriots have kept him for us on the air.
[3:43:06.940 --> 3:43:07.940]  Thank you so much.
[3:43:07.940 --> 3:43:11.940]  I don't want the globalist to win for my children's future, for your children's future.
[3:43:11.940 --> 3:43:14.940]  I just personally don't want them to be able to shut us down.
[3:43:14.940 --> 3:43:16.940]  And thanks to you spread the word by the products.
[3:43:16.940 --> 3:43:17.940]  We are able to stay on air.
[3:43:17.940 --> 3:43:25.940]  We have huge end of Christmas into the year sales, the biggest ever clearance sales of the 75% off reshipping double patriot points.
[3:43:25.940 --> 3:43:27.940]  The new year is here.
[3:43:27.940 --> 3:43:29.940]  It's a great way to get healthy and fund the M4.

[3:43:50.940 --> 3:44:02.940]  In the year 2020, crazed leftists are literally crawling out of their political graves and attacking Americans that dare not submit to their bullying.
[3:44:02.940 --> 3:44:13.940]  2020 is here and despite all the globalist efforts, thanks to you, the listeners and viewers, M4 Wars is still on the air in 2020.

[3:44:43.940 --> 3:44:45.940]  m4warslife.com.
[3:44:45.940 --> 3:44:47.940]  End of the year 2020.
[3:44:47.940 --> 3:44:49.940]  2020 at m4warslife.com.
[3:44:49.940 --> 3:44:51.940]  Take action now.
[3:44:52.940 --> 3:44:56.940]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the globalist?
[3:44:56.940 --> 3:44:59.940]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[3:44:59.940 --> 3:45:02.940]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[3:45:02.940 --> 3:45:04.940]  And that's my allegory.
[3:45:04.940 --> 3:45:15.940]  Turboforce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[3:45:15.940 --> 3:45:17.940]  Some people get 15 hours out of this, some people get about 8 hours.
[3:45:17.940 --> 3:45:23.940]  But people take this, people are taking sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not hype.
[3:45:23.940 --> 3:45:28.940]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts.
[3:45:28.940 --> 3:45:29.940]  You can call us whatever you want.
[3:45:29.940 --> 3:45:32.940]  It's a total solution, all around the best you're going to find.
[3:45:32.940 --> 3:45:35.940]  Turboforce, without you, we don't roll.
[3:45:35.940 --> 3:45:37.940]  With you, we search forward together.
[3:45:37.940 --> 3:45:39.940]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[3:45:39.940 --> 3:45:42.940]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[3:45:42.940 --> 3:45:45.940]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind?
[3:45:45.940 --> 3:45:47.940]  It's a win-win, 360 together.
[3:45:47.940 --> 3:45:51.940]  m4warslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[3:45:51.940 --> 3:45:55.940]  Well, there goes Christmas 2019.
[3:45:55.940 --> 3:45:59.940]  And we're plunging into 2020 as we speak.
[3:45:59.940 --> 3:46:11.940]  And as 2019 collapses into dust and the baby of 2020 is born, now is the time to realize how critical this year is for all of our futures.
[3:46:11.940 --> 3:46:14.940]  And listen, keep taking action, keep spreading the word.
[3:46:14.940 --> 3:46:15.940]  That's vital.
[3:46:15.940 --> 3:46:20.940]  But making yourself healthy, making yourself more focused and centered
[3:46:20.940 --> 3:46:22.940]  is critical to all of this.
[3:46:22.940 --> 3:46:25.940]  And that's why the products at m4warslife are so special.
[3:46:25.940 --> 3:46:26.940]  So Christmas is gone.
[3:46:26.940 --> 3:46:28.940]  Christmas is over, basically.
[3:46:28.940 --> 3:46:34.940]  But you can give yourself the gift of Christmas year-round at m4warsstore.com and m4warslife.com.

[3:46:46.940 --> 3:46:52.940]  So take action today for yourself and your family and get the great products at m4warslife.com.
[3:46:55.940 --> 3:46:58.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:46:58.940 --> 3:47:19.940]  All right, I was already going to basically start the broadcast with this today.
[3:47:19.940 --> 3:47:25.940]  And then we had the embassy attack by the Hezbollah Iranian-backed militia.
[3:47:25.940 --> 3:47:28.940]  And that whole crisis is blowing up.
[3:47:28.940 --> 3:47:31.940]  And it's that the left is planning to try to trigger a civil war here
[3:47:31.940 --> 3:47:34.940]  and call the United Nations into the country.
[3:47:34.940 --> 3:47:40.940]  The globalists have positioned the UN as the world government, China as the muscle, both economically.
[3:47:40.940 --> 3:47:43.940]  This is a new story going up on m4wars.com.
[3:47:43.940 --> 3:47:47.940]  As we speak, Tom Pappert just called me with it.
[3:47:47.940 --> 3:47:56.940]  I am booked right now to come on with, of course, Owen Schreuer.
[3:47:56.940 --> 3:47:58.940]  And I'm going to continue on.
[3:47:58.940 --> 3:48:02.940]  I'm going to be on with Owen as well coming up in the four o'clock hour.
[3:48:02.940 --> 3:48:05.940]  It's the last live broadcast of the year and so much is breaking.
[3:48:05.940 --> 3:48:12.940]  And I literally have a mobile dentist coming here to just cut this tooth off.
[3:48:12.940 --> 3:48:14.940]  I just had to do this real quick.
[3:48:14.940 --> 3:48:17.940]  Because this tooth imploded and cracked and it's making me bleed.
[3:48:17.940 --> 3:48:18.940]  Nice guy to deal with it.
[3:48:18.940 --> 3:48:24.940]  So as soon as I've got that handle, I'm going to be back on the air here because this is ultra massive.
[3:48:24.940 --> 3:48:29.940]  This is going up on m4wars.com right now, nationalfile.com.
[3:48:29.940 --> 3:48:42.940]  This is official New York UN office recruits, paramilitary troops for disarmament and reintegration of U.S. civilians.
[3:48:42.940 --> 3:48:47.940]  Now, guys, print me in 4wars.com as the prefix when you search it.
[3:48:47.940 --> 3:48:49.940]  This is for listeners too.
[3:48:49.940 --> 3:48:58.940]  And type in Obama military document, army document, reeducation camps.
[3:48:58.940 --> 3:49:03.940]  It actually was in a 2010 document where Obama told the army,
[3:49:03.940 --> 3:49:07.940]  prepare to process Americans into reeducation camps.
[3:49:07.940 --> 3:49:10.940]  That's not me calling a reeducation camp.
[3:49:10.940 --> 3:49:14.940]  It was a term used by the Pentagon in Obama's order,
[3:49:14.940 --> 3:49:18.940]  basically from the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment.
[3:49:18.940 --> 3:49:26.940]  And it talks about that's right out of the weathermen and Larry Grathwald and the reeducation camps.
[3:49:26.940 --> 3:49:33.940]  So in the 4 o'clock hour, I'm going to be over there with Owen,
[3:49:33.940 --> 3:49:34.940]  breaking all this down.
[3:49:34.940 --> 3:49:35.940]  He'll have the first hour.
[3:49:35.940 --> 3:49:36.940]  I want to call Tom Pappert.
[3:49:36.940 --> 3:49:40.940]  I'll just call myself right now while I'm on air until we get him set up that way.
[3:49:40.940 --> 3:49:43.940]  Boom, make sure he's on.
[3:49:43.940 --> 3:49:45.940]  Do I call him?
[3:49:45.940 --> 3:49:47.940]  This is so massive, but we knew this was coming.
[3:49:47.940 --> 3:49:49.940]  See, they just got to get it out in the open.
[3:49:49.940 --> 3:49:52.940]  Also, print me the articles about Strong Cities Initiative,
[3:49:52.940 --> 3:49:56.940]  UN to control U.S. police forces.
[3:49:56.940 --> 3:50:03.940]  This is all part of the conditioning for during the Civil War they start, then the UN comes in.
[3:50:03.940 --> 3:50:06.940]  Hey, Tom, I got you live on air. I wanted to make sure this happened.
[3:50:06.940 --> 3:50:10.940]  Owen Schreuer is live with the war room coming up.
[3:50:10.940 --> 3:50:16.940]  I want to co-host because I was already going to make this my main show today, the UN Chai Con Takeover.
[3:50:16.940 --> 3:50:20.940]  And then I got diverted off into this embassy situation and never got to it,
[3:50:20.940 --> 3:50:22.940]  but I promised to cover it so that way I'll keep the promise.
[3:50:22.940 --> 3:50:29.940]  Can you come on with Owen in about 30 minutes and then I'm going to come on right after that?
[3:50:29.940 --> 3:50:31.940]  Absolutely, Alex. We'll be there.
[3:50:31.940 --> 3:50:34.940]  Just tell listeners real quick a little bit about this massive story.
[3:50:34.940 --> 3:50:38.940]  This is from the UN. This isn't a theory. It's not something we're just saying.
[3:50:38.940 --> 3:50:41.940]  This is openly the UN recruiting troops for America.
[3:50:41.940 --> 3:50:46.940]  They're now having events in places like Utah, kicking citizens out off the streets,
[3:50:46.940 --> 3:50:49.940]  saying we own and control this now. We are sovereign.
[3:50:49.940 --> 3:50:51.940]  I mean, this is what they do all over the world.
[3:50:51.940 --> 3:50:55.940]  They've joined with the Chai Cons and the Internet Takeover. It's just incredible.
[3:50:55.940 --> 3:50:59.940]  Well, Alex, it's baffling how up front they're being with this.
[3:50:59.940 --> 3:51:05.940]  This literally comes from a UN recruitment website where they're trying to hire employees.
[3:51:05.940 --> 3:51:08.940]  And of course, it's been up since November. Nobody has noticed this.
[3:51:08.940 --> 3:51:13.940]  We find it and it says that they're hiring people with a paramilitary background
[3:51:13.940 --> 3:51:17.940]  for peacekeeping operations in UN member states.
[3:51:17.940 --> 3:51:22.940]  Of course, that means 103 countries, including the United States of America, but it gets better.
[3:51:22.940 --> 3:51:27.940]  These people will be stationed in the New York office of the United Nations.
[3:51:27.940 --> 3:51:31.940]  So this is completely up front, completely out where everybody can see it.
[3:51:31.940 --> 3:51:35.940]  You go to their website. It tells you exactly what the peacekeeping forces do.
[3:51:35.940 --> 3:51:38.940]  There is absolutely no way that they can try to hide what this is.
[3:51:38.940 --> 3:51:42.940]  And again, Alex, as you know, they do this all. They're so arrogant at this point.
[3:51:42.940 --> 3:51:48.940]  They do it in plain sight of every single person who could just go to the website and read what they're planning.
[3:51:48.940 --> 3:51:52.940]  And of course, you integrate this in with the Strong Cities Initiative.
[3:51:52.940 --> 3:52:00.940]  You integrate this in with what Obama was trying, with the UN suing over us having borders at all.
[3:52:00.940 --> 3:52:04.940]  This is a big, big piece of the puzzle. Very, very important.
[3:52:04.940 --> 3:52:07.940]  Again, if we don't act like it's a big deal, no one else is alerted.
[3:52:07.940 --> 3:52:12.940]  So so many times, if I go, oh, this video is important, people go watch it, if I go, oh, this is huge, people care.
[3:52:12.940 --> 3:52:16.940]  They just want to keep putting this out slowly and conditioning us.
[3:52:16.940 --> 3:52:19.940]  But this ties into the tricom takeover and everything else.
[3:52:19.940 --> 3:52:22.940]  So you'll be on the war room with Owen Stroyer at band.video.
[3:52:22.940 --> 3:52:25.940]  And at infowars.com.forge.show at about 30 minutes.
[3:52:25.940 --> 3:52:35.940]  He takes over in about eight, nine minutes at three o'clock Central Standard Time, infowars.com.forge.show, newswars.com.forge.show.
[3:52:35.940 --> 3:52:38.940]  That URL is in the censored as much on Twitter and Facebook and places.
[3:52:38.940 --> 3:52:43.940]  So folks, without you, this information will not get out.
[3:52:43.940 --> 3:52:48.940]  So we're going to be breaking it all down here, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:52:48.940 --> 3:52:53.940]  I'm going to just continue on here tonight as well on the war room with Owen Stroyer.
[3:52:53.940 --> 3:52:59.940]  That's Tom Papert of National File, and he's going to be co-hosting with us coming up with the war room.
[3:52:59.940 --> 3:53:00.940]  Thank you, Tom.
[3:53:00.940 --> 3:53:03.940]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:53:03.940 --> 3:53:06.940]  Okay, look, I tried to get to everybody.
[3:53:06.940 --> 3:53:07.940]  I didn't even get to all this news.
[3:53:07.940 --> 3:53:13.940]  We took so many calls, but let's just try to jam a few of these in, but everybody's just got a 30 seconds, 40 seconds or so.
[3:53:13.940 --> 3:53:17.940]  Mark in New York, thanks for holding her on the air.
[3:53:17.940 --> 3:53:18.940]  Not a problem.
[3:53:18.940 --> 3:53:19.940]  How are you doing today, Mr. Jones?
[3:53:19.940 --> 3:53:20.940]  Good, brother.
[3:53:20.940 --> 3:53:24.940]  I just wanted to say real quick, I know what you guys are talking about.
[3:53:24.940 --> 3:53:27.940]  I've been a long time listener for seven years.
[3:53:27.940 --> 3:53:30.940]  I'm definitely a diehard Trump fan.
[3:53:30.940 --> 3:53:35.940]  Even before most of them became Trump fans, but people need to keep in mind that it's all biblical.
[3:53:35.940 --> 3:53:40.940]  Once the New World Order comes to fruition, the only reason why it hasn't come to fruition yet is because of Mr. Trump.
[3:53:40.940 --> 3:53:48.940]  And it's biblical. It's biblical for the one-year-old government to rise up. It has to happen.
[3:53:48.940 --> 3:53:54.940]  No, I agree, but we've got to warn people so they don't then submit to it and take on its religion.
[3:53:54.940 --> 3:53:55.940]  Absolutely.
[3:53:55.940 --> 3:54:00.940]  And with Barack Obama, people forget that he bought 12 guillotines.
[3:54:00.940 --> 3:54:01.940]  And he bought 12 guillotines.
[3:54:01.940 --> 3:54:04.940]  What was that, like five years ago, four years ago?
[3:54:04.940 --> 3:54:08.940]  And the government, the US government bought up all the ammo then.
[3:54:08.940 --> 3:54:12.940]  It wasn't like 2014, 2013, something around then.
[3:54:12.940 --> 3:54:13.940]  They're going to be using that.
[3:54:13.940 --> 3:54:15.940]  People sleep on the left.
[3:54:15.940 --> 3:54:20.940]  And I mean, there are foot soldiers and Tifa and the snowflakes out there.
[3:54:20.940 --> 3:54:22.940]  Those are their pawns.
[3:54:22.940 --> 3:54:25.940]  I mean, there's bigger pieces on the board that they're going to use for foot soldiers.
[3:54:25.940 --> 3:54:30.940]  People forget about all the gangs that come across the borders, the local gangs in the neighborhood.
[3:54:30.940 --> 3:54:33.940]  That's right. Everything is just desensitized.
[3:54:33.940 --> 3:54:38.940]  This break us down, flood us with fentanyl, kill millions of us and then cause a race war.
[3:54:38.940 --> 3:54:41.940]  And then the UN is invited in by the Democrats.
[3:54:41.940 --> 3:54:45.940]  And they have a permanent civil war in the United States declaring to buy that resist terrorist.
[3:54:45.940 --> 3:54:48.940]  And then we're in a civil war, which is what the Chai comms of the EU want.
[3:54:48.940 --> 3:54:50.940]  That's their plan to bring down America.
[3:54:50.940 --> 3:54:51.940]  Thank you so much, Mark.
[3:54:51.940 --> 3:54:56.940]  The Chai comms are in the news today saying this army, American people stories up on info wars.com,
[3:54:56.940 --> 3:55:02.940]  Chinese state media, gun ownership out of control in the US, take our guns.
[3:55:02.940 --> 3:55:04.940]  Let's go ahead and go to Aaron in Kentucky.
[3:55:04.940 --> 3:55:06.940]  Aaron, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[3:55:06.940 --> 3:55:07.940]  Yeah, Alex.
[3:55:07.940 --> 3:55:14.940]  The reason that are the way that we're going to continue this movement after Trump has gone is the first reason that we're going to.
[3:55:14.940 --> 3:55:19.940]  You've been driving for 20 years because it's not ideals about liberty.
[3:55:19.940 --> 3:55:20.940]  It's a people.
[3:55:20.940 --> 3:55:21.940]  It's not about a person.
[3:55:21.940 --> 3:55:30.940]  We're grateful that Trump is a guy that spearheading this right now and giving us a platform to help to expose the fake news, the fake media that's out there.
[3:55:30.940 --> 3:55:33.940]  He's also helped to expose the deep state.
[3:55:33.940 --> 3:55:35.940]  Years ago, people are talking about the Illuminati.
[3:55:35.940 --> 3:55:38.940]  They were talking about the free nation to take over the government.
[3:55:38.940 --> 3:55:45.940]  But right now, the deep state, which is the same thing as all of those secret societies, the permanent bureaucracy.
[3:55:45.940 --> 3:55:46.940]  Absolutely.
[3:55:46.940 --> 3:55:48.940]  And it's now on the news every day.
[3:55:48.940 --> 3:55:52.940]  It's part of our daily talk because there's no going back for the globalists.
[3:55:52.940 --> 3:55:55.940]  They have been grievously wounded.
[3:55:55.940 --> 3:56:07.940]  Absolutely, because once you have somebody like this that's helping it to ignite a movement like this and people have had a taste of freedom and they realize in their wake now, there's nothing that's going to be able to stop them from this.
[3:56:07.940 --> 3:56:09.940]  I hear you're out of town, Aaron.
[3:56:09.940 --> 3:56:12.940]  Thank you for holding your awesome wild in Wisconsin.
[3:56:12.940 --> 3:56:15.940]  You say how far down the rabbit hole are we?
[3:56:15.940 --> 3:56:17.940]  It's going to get exponentially crazy.
[3:56:17.940 --> 3:56:19.940]  We're at the bottom of the rabbit hole already.
[3:56:19.940 --> 3:56:21.940]  It's just how much will we be able to see?
[3:56:21.940 --> 3:56:23.940]  How much light will there be in the darkness?
[3:56:23.940 --> 3:56:25.940]  Anything?
[3:56:25.940 --> 3:56:29.940]  What do I think, personally, is I think we haven't even dipped our toes into it.
[3:56:29.940 --> 3:56:32.940]  I think it's a layered fractal.
[3:56:32.940 --> 3:56:35.940]  And though it may seem we get deeper, we know less and less.
[3:56:35.940 --> 3:56:38.940]  We're actually very shallow still.
[3:56:38.940 --> 3:56:48.940]  I think as we progress, you know, we have major chapters transitioning from the 90s to the 2000 odds with September 11.
[3:56:48.940 --> 3:56:53.940]  Then now in the 2010s, you know, you've been very correct.
[3:56:53.940 --> 3:56:56.940]  You know what? Let's do this wild and you're not going to hold.
[3:56:56.940 --> 3:56:58.940]  I'm going to go talk to Owen and say, hey, please go to their call.
[3:56:58.940 --> 3:57:02.940]  Second segment, Wild Andre and Derek, we're going to your calls.
[3:57:02.940 --> 3:57:05.940]  I'll be back in one hour in there with Owen.
[3:57:05.940 --> 3:57:11.940]  And then Mike Adams is hosting part of the show tomorrow and I'll be here for part of the show tomorrow as well.
[3:57:11.940 --> 3:57:19.940]  So live New Year's Day show, but Owen Schreuer at infowars.com.
[3:57:19.940 --> 3:57:24.940]  He's about to take over with Tom Pappert and let's transfer those calls over to the other studio.
[3:57:24.940 --> 3:57:26.940]  Wild, stay there.
[3:57:26.940 --> 3:57:28.940]  I want to hear your view on the rabbit hole.
[3:57:28.940 --> 3:57:29.940]  All these callers have been amazing.
[3:57:29.940 --> 3:57:34.940]  We must get to every caller, Andre, Wild, Derek, infowars.com.
[3:57:34.940 --> 3:57:37.940]  Everybody watching and listening, tell everyone you know, tune in now.
[3:57:37.940 --> 3:57:39.940]  That's how we create a chain reaction.
[3:57:39.940 --> 3:57:41.940]  God bless you all.
