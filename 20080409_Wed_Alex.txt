[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.472]  Well, we've got some celebrating to do, my friends.
[00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:32.501]  Some celebrating to do.
[00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:56.819]  9-11 truth, the exposure globally, not just in the United States or North America, of the black-off attacks meant to herald the fourth Reich of a neo-fascist system, is becoming common knowledge everywhere and the paradigm of false flag staged terror or self-inflicted wounds is falling apart right now.
[00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:59.101]  The Jesse Ventura story that broke here
[00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:04.451]  Last week, during a break, I don't even know if we've aired that yet.
[00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:09.733]  I know Aaron's taking the full hour and 20-minute interview and putting it together for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.114]  We've only put out some selects.
[00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:19.037]  I don't believe it's out yet, where during the break I'm talking to Ventura, 50 minutes into the interview, and he goes, hey, Alex, we can talk about 9-11.
[00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:19.937]  I'm ready now.
[00:01:19.937 --> 00:01:23.078]  I want to go ahead and do it on your show.
[00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:26.700]  And so on my show, I didn't even ask him to,
[00:01:28.234 --> 00:01:33.898]  Kind of like I had Willie Nelson on, and I had Willie on for quite a while.
[00:01:33.898 --> 00:01:38.562]  We were in the interview, and we were in a break, and he goes, hey, let's get into the hardcore stuff.
[00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:41.244]  Because it's like, I don't even want to get these guys in the spotlight.
[00:01:41.244 --> 00:01:42.825]  I'm not even pushing them there.
[00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:49.130]  If they want to go public, but they say, gently, gently, catchy monkey, is an old saying my dad had.
[00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.712]  And I guess that's the case.
[00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:53.114]  It's kind of like a stray cat or dog.
[00:01:53.114 --> 00:01:54.675]  You're trying to get it to come over to you so you can pet it.
[00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:55.916]  Just ignore it, and it'll come over.
[00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:57.377]  But if you try to pet it, it won't.
[00:01:58.746 --> 00:02:04.767]  But, uh, all these people saying the government killed Kennedy, the government's behind the attacks.
[00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:14.229]  Rick Linklater, Bruce Willis, Jesse Ventura, Rosie O'Donnell, best actress, Oscar winner this year.
[00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.350]  Charlie Sheen, of course, started it all with big celebrities going public.
[00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.850]  He really will be remembered in history.
[00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.671]  They don't remember the second group to reverse the country east to west.
[00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:23.671]  They remember Lewis and Clark.
[00:02:24.642 --> 00:02:30.565]  And it's not just that they're celebrities, it's that they have a lot to lose, and that we are a celebrity-driven society.
[00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:32.586]  And so that's why people resonated with Charlie Sheen.
[00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:35.707]  Now, I'm so busy, I hardly ever even call Charlie anymore.
[00:02:35.707 --> 00:02:37.668]  I call him about once a month, he calls me about once a month.
[00:02:37.668 --> 00:02:43.050]  I need to just get that man on the phone and say, Charlie, it's time for you to come on the air now.
[00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.012]  Because he really is owed so much of the credit for what's happening now.
[00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:51.754]  But the next level, a governor, Jesse Ventura, doing this in a very forceful way,
[00:02:53.146 --> 00:03:14.618]  And now people are looking into it, and they're finding out that all these CIA section chiefs, and Ronald Reagan's chief CIA briefer, and Bob Baird, Bill Christensen, of course, Ray McGovern, saying it's an inside job, and all the evidence shows inside job, and we've got
[00:03:15.467 --> 00:03:24.434]  Number three in the Blair government, Meecher, years ago going public, and two different German, former German Defense Ministers, one Parliamentary, one National Defense Chief.
[00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:26.376]  Another head of the Parliament in Germany's gone public.
[00:03:26.376 --> 00:03:28.798]  He went public six months after it happened, before von Bülow.
[00:03:28.798 --> 00:03:30.219]  Never gonna get that guy on.
[00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.060]  Had von Bülow on, not the other fellow.
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.462]  We're getting von Bülow back on, by the way.
[00:03:34.462 --> 00:03:40.087]  All of this happening, all of this going on, and
[00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:53.174]  It's just mind-blowing to have high-level people in the Japanese Parliament and the former Italian President and the official lie is and has collapsed.
[00:03:53.174 --> 00:04:10.500]  And all we need is examples of this, not just exposing government terror, taking that tool away from them, which is their ace in the hole, neutralizing their key head guard, but at the same time showing that the people
[00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:20.954]  That the people can affect change, that we do have power, that the New World Order is not invincible, that it's a house of cards.
[00:04:20.954 --> 00:04:29.319]  And back to the card analogy, you know, during the Renaissance in about 1650, the former highest was the King of Spades.
[00:04:31.198 --> 00:04:41.505]  But the people in France going into the 1700s said, no, we're going to make the lowest card the number one card, the Ace of Spades, symbolizing the people and revolution.
[00:04:41.505 --> 00:04:44.507]  So we've taken their Ace of Spades away of government sponsored terror.
[00:04:44.507 --> 00:04:51.392]  We've taken it for ourselves and we're playing the card saying, no, the lowest card is the top card, the Ace of Spades.
[00:04:51.392 --> 00:04:54.254]  And we're playing it and we're hurting them bad.
[00:04:54.254 --> 00:04:59.378]  It is a big idea, a new world order in the near future.
[00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:03.363]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:03.363 --> 00:05:06.186]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:06.186 --> 00:05:08.989]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:08.989 --> 00:05:12.172]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:12.172 --> 00:05:19.501]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:22.506 --> 00:05:27.950]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.832]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:34.394]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:34.394 --> 00:05:35.575]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:35.575 --> 00:05:36.355]  They're not after money.
[00:05:36.355 --> 00:05:37.616]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:37.616 --> 00:05:38.597]  They're after power.
[00:05:38.597 --> 00:05:39.758]  That's what they're after.
[00:05:39.758 --> 00:05:44.501]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:48.463]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:48.463 --> 00:05:51.265]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:05:51.265 --> 00:05:52.326]  You have been warned.
[00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:55.112]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:05:55.112 --> 00:05:57.116]  of the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:05:57.515 --> 00:06:00.558]  Allison's Natural Antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:06:00.558 --> 00:06:01.319]  is a real thing.
[00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:08.325]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer from fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:06:08.325 --> 00:06:19.336]  Allison molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills fleshy bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:22.579]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies of
[00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.919]  I think so.
[00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:53.420]  Fact.
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:59.466]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:06:59.466 --> 00:07:03.810]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:11.537]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:07:11.537 --> 00:07:12.298]  The solution.
[00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:16.262]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:25.650]  The LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:33.857]  Detoxification works with the LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.
[00:07:33.857 --> 00:07:38.381]  For mental clarity, restored vitality, a stronger immune system, clear skin,
[00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:41.464]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:14.369]  We are now doing four hours live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:18.473]  The first three here on GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.473 --> 00:08:19.234]  From 11 a.m.
[00:08:19.234 --> 00:08:20.695]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:20.695 --> 00:08:26.641]  And for the next few weeks, the fourth hour is only on the internet at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:26.641 --> 00:08:32.046]  We have tens of thousands of people tuning in each and every millisecond there on the streams.
[00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:48.202]  If we combine all of our streams that are even registered by Shoutcast, we are number one, not just in talk, but overall, much of the time of every music station, other network, you name it, and only a portion of our streams are tracked by Shoutcast.
[00:08:48.202 --> 00:08:51.985]  We also have Windows streams for people that like Windows configurations.
[00:08:53.387 --> 00:08:56.209]  And it's an actual, I'm told, Windows configuration.
[00:08:56.209 --> 00:09:02.892]  Other people have Windows players, but their player has a patch that just flips over, is how it's been described to me.
[00:09:02.892 --> 00:09:06.013]  We actually have a Windows player.
[00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:15.078]  But I almost want to take it down, because so many tens of thousands listen to that now, that they don't listen to the other streams, and then that drives down our ranking.
[00:09:15.078 --> 00:09:17.779]  But we're still number one, even with that.
[00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:20.400]  And if it makes it easier for people to listen, that's the point.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.141]  And I don't care about just having a ranking.
[00:09:23.206 --> 00:09:33.971]  When your video is in the top ten for the last six months of Google Video and routinely number one, and many times multiple films I've made are in the top few films, people are watching it.
[00:09:33.971 --> 00:09:35.972]  That's where they go to do their viewing.
[00:09:35.972 --> 00:09:38.813]  When you're in the number one slot, people see it.
[00:09:38.813 --> 00:09:45.696]  And Shoutcast has tens of millions of listeners that tune in every day just to listen to streams there on the site.
[00:09:45.696 --> 00:09:52.499]  And so to be number one and talk, that's just one of our streams is number one and talk, and then to be overall number one is so important.
[00:09:53.268 --> 00:09:57.769]  And yes, I just said that all my films are for free on the internet.
[00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:58.849]  All of them.
[00:09:58.849 --> 00:10:02.350]  We could have them all taken down if we wanted to, but we don't.
[00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.071]  We don't do that.
[00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:12.253]  I could have the people selling my videos on eBay shut down right now, but I don't do it.
[00:10:12.253 --> 00:10:13.093]  And why?
[00:10:13.093 --> 00:10:16.934]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, the mission is waking the people up.
[00:10:16.934 --> 00:10:21.055]  The mission is bringing the perpetrators of 9-11 to justice.
[00:10:21.055 --> 00:10:22.155]  The mission is
[00:10:23.476 --> 00:10:30.082]  Stopping government-sponsored terror, stopping the New World Order from coming into fruition.
[00:10:30.082 --> 00:10:33.245]  And so that's why you can get all of my films for free.
[00:10:33.245 --> 00:10:40.412]  Now, I've turned down a national distribution deal by one of the biggest movie houses out there.
[00:10:40.412 --> 00:10:43.174]  I'm not going to say the name.
[00:10:43.174 --> 00:10:46.197]  Because I wouldn't be able to put my films out for free if I did that.
[00:10:47.265 --> 00:10:51.249]  And I have turned down $100,000 advances and things in the past.
[00:10:51.249 --> 00:10:58.016]  I haven't just turned down million-dollar deals to go be on international, national, biggest radio networks out there.
[00:10:58.016 --> 00:11:01.280]  Did that seven years ago, almost eight years ago.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:07.687]  And I'm not tooting my horn here, but if you actually count the cost and look at the facts, it's not a decision.
[00:11:07.687 --> 00:11:09.889]  It's not even a moral thing.
[00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:12.506]  We don't have a choice.
[00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:14.606]  We have to fight 110%.
[00:11:14.606 --> 00:11:17.827]  We can't compromise with this information.
[00:11:17.827 --> 00:11:26.230]  We have to do everything we can and follow the path that leads towards the defeat of the New World Order and no other path.
[00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:36.273]  My personal safety, my personal future, fame, fortune, none of that enters into the equation when we deal with survival of the species against a criminal elite
[00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:46.528]  Who are carrying out predatory actions against the human population and engaging in parasitic predator activities against free humanity.
[00:11:46.528 --> 00:11:47.510]  That must be met 110%.
[00:11:50.183 --> 00:12:06.709]  It is the individual self-sacrifice that will save humanity in the future and give our future progeny and us currently and our children, don't even have to wait to the future, some chance of survival and of moving forward to the next level of human development.
[00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:18.434]  If not, we'll be locked in a technocratic dark age, a nightmare grid designed to exterminate the vast majority of us, the commoners, and to seat the elite firmly
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:35.653]  At the throne of impenetrable despotism, a scientific dictatorship, a scientific system of dehumanization, securing their monopoly of power forever.
[00:12:35.653 --> 00:12:47.402]  That said, I do want to challenge all of the listeners to go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:12:49.938 --> 00:12:54.179]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv and see all of my films in super high quality.
[00:12:54.179 --> 00:12:56.100]  Download them in better quality.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:01.182]  Stream, download them in better quality to DVDs and CDs and discs and give them to people.
[00:13:01.182 --> 00:13:14.046]  Also, view them in high quality, not the murky, watery, blotchy stuff you find on the free internet sites, which is good as a shock troop to wake up those that don't know.
[00:13:15.175 --> 00:13:22.441]  But it also then funds our operation here when you are members of PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:13:22.441 --> 00:13:25.364]  That is so important.
[00:13:25.364 --> 00:13:26.625]  Fifteen cents a day.
[00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:30.327]  And what else do you get with PrisonPlanet.TV?
[00:13:30.327 --> 00:13:39.575]  You get all of my films, my weekly TV report in studio, my weekly in-studio interviews, my Sunday radio show videotape with documents and videos added,
[00:13:40.776 --> 00:13:42.197]  Trey does a great job putting that together.
[00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:44.238]  Aaron puts together some of the other shows.
[00:13:44.238 --> 00:13:45.159]  It's a fabulous job.
[00:13:45.159 --> 00:13:54.024]  Now we have the one-hour overdrive show after the broadcast that will be on Genesis in the next few weeks.
[00:13:54.024 --> 00:14:07.511]  It could already be on there, but by choice I'm waiting to let other people get out of the way and for their own self-interest and
[00:14:10.276 --> 00:14:13.017]  The show again goes to three o'clock now.
[00:14:13.017 --> 00:14:18.560]  Now yesterday I went to 5.30 Central.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.901]  So I did a five and a half hour radio show yesterday.
[00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:25.503]  I did two hours and 30 minutes extra.
[00:14:25.503 --> 00:14:34.747]  I did a simulcast with National British Radio for 45 minutes in the second hour of overdrive in hour number four.
[00:14:34.747 --> 00:14:37.488]  Excuse me, hour number five.
[00:14:37.488 --> 00:14:38.549]  I went into hour number six.
[00:14:39.729 --> 00:14:47.752]  and uh... we also took the gloves off again yesterday a little bit more so that's basically what's happening here
[00:14:48.863 --> 00:14:54.387]  And you can see the video of that and see the document cam and the guest cam, two-camera shoot.
[00:14:54.387 --> 00:15:05.175]  It's actually a four-camera shoot, but two cameras on me, a camera on my guest, a document cam, a video feed, play DVDs, play computer files, play YouTube videos, whatever we want here.
[00:15:05.175 --> 00:15:14.181]  And then we stream that, mix that together, and stream that to you in 64-bit, super high quality, down to you with the video.
[00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:15.662]  Then we're uploading that.
[00:15:16.852 --> 00:15:21.520]  ThePrisonPlanet.tv, what, last night within two hours of the show being over?
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:29.573]  It automatically encodes and then posts to a new live link there for members so you can watch the live overdrive show taped
[00:15:30.282 --> 00:15:49.478]  It's like a DVR on demand when you get home or when you go into work at night and you're a security guard or you're a professor, you want it on the background, whatever, fast forward, pause, rewind, blow stuff up, whatever you want, you can do it with the postings we're doing each and every day of the live transmission.
[00:15:49.478 --> 00:15:52.261]  Now, the family is complaining because I normally run home about 4.
[00:15:53.567 --> 00:16:02.893]  You know, get off the air at 2, do some work until about 4, run home for 4 or 5 hours, put the kids to sleep at 8, 9 o'clock, come back to work until midnight, 1, 2 in the morning.
[00:16:02.893 --> 00:16:11.899]  And lately I've just been showing up at 6, 7, and then leaving at 8 or 9, or then being tired and not going back to work, so I have to cut it off at 3.
[00:16:11.899 --> 00:16:15.021]  But sometimes I will overdrive.
[00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:20.625]  And, or sometimes I'll say, okay, I'm off at 3, but now we're going to give you an hour-long sneak peek of a film I'm making.
[00:16:22.583 --> 00:16:26.024]  Or, uh, you know, here's an interview I did with somebody on video three years ago.
[00:16:26.024 --> 00:16:29.245]  Or here's the extra stuff with Ben Livingston, the father of weather weapons.
[00:16:29.245 --> 00:16:33.246]  We're just gonna play this for you now.
[00:16:33.246 --> 00:16:34.706]  That's the type of stuff we've got in queue.
[00:16:34.706 --> 00:16:43.368]  The type of stuff, I mean, we've got hundreds of hours of things nobody's ever seen that are just excellent because I was trying to craft it and put it together and put documents to it and put it on the web or put it out in films.
[00:16:43.368 --> 00:16:45.989]  Not now, we're just gonna throw it at you.
[00:16:45.989 --> 00:16:51.450]  Like yesterday, we aired a 25-minute interview with Japanese TV where we videotaped their interview with me.
[00:16:53.875 --> 00:16:59.536]  So, that's the type of stuff you're going to get with a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, or with your exclusive membership.
[00:16:59.536 --> 00:17:03.317]  Again, you can watch all the films, the audio, read my book, Paul Lawson's book.
[00:17:03.317 --> 00:17:05.118]  Fifteen cents a day, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:17:05.118 --> 00:17:19.481]  If you haven't gotten a membership, or let's say you had one three years ago, and you watched the films that were on it, and you know, the 500 pieces of media, and you let your subscription elapse and end, and now, I want you to know we've got two CDNs, two different companies,
[00:17:21.775 --> 00:17:26.159]  We've got two big companies, what, Limelight and Mirror Image.
[00:17:26.159 --> 00:17:29.482]  And then I've got seven servers of my own.
[00:17:29.482 --> 00:17:30.323]  It's seven, isn't it?
[00:17:30.323 --> 00:17:32.705]  I'm looking out the window at the engineers.
[00:17:32.705 --> 00:17:35.908]  Seven servers and then two big CDNs.
[00:17:35.908 --> 00:17:40.052]  And so, man, it's just, if you've got it, it's at four times T1 speed.
[00:17:40.052 --> 00:17:41.253]  I mean, if you've got the connections.
[00:17:42.323 --> 00:17:45.446]  Or if you've got dial-up, we've got low-quality ones there for you.
[00:17:45.446 --> 00:17:48.368]  Or you can still dial in by dial-up and take a day to download it.
[00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:52.091]  But with a four times T1 speed, you can download an hour-long program in about two minutes.
[00:17:52.091 --> 00:17:55.573]  Or you can stream-download it with Flash while you're watching.
[00:17:55.573 --> 00:17:58.356]  And we're just going to keep upgrading and upgrading and upgrading and upgrading.
[00:17:58.356 --> 00:18:03.219]  And I will tell you, in the next six months, we're going to find the talent and people that we believe have the info.
[00:18:03.219 --> 00:18:07.663]  We're going to set them up with studios around the country, and we're going to have TV feeds for you.
[00:18:07.663 --> 00:18:10.725]  I believe a morning show, my show, and then an evening news program.
[00:18:12.435 --> 00:18:15.437]  So that's on the cooker too for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:18:15.437 --> 00:18:19.900]  Monday was the fourth anniversary of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:28.545]  Or get the high quality DVDs and books and videos and everything we carry and the films I've made in the InfoWars.com store.
[00:18:28.545 --> 00:18:33.628]  Go to InfoWars.com and when you purchase the DVDs, the books, we buy better computers, we buy better cameras.
[00:18:34.632 --> 00:18:40.556]  We see them as weapons, and we just marvel over the new Vulcan death cannons we buy.
[00:18:40.556 --> 00:18:43.138]  That's basically what the A-10 Warthogs got.
[00:18:43.138 --> 00:18:56.387]  When we buy a new digital camera, or a new computer, or sign a contract for a new super high-powered CDN, that's like a giant particle beam weapon we're going to aim right at the New World Order's eyeball, and we just throw the throttle down to full power and go, YES!
[00:18:56.387 --> 00:18:57.928]  And just start firing on them!
[00:18:57.928 --> 00:18:58.449]  Ha ha!
[00:18:59.378 --> 00:19:00.419]  I mean, that's what it is.
[00:19:00.419 --> 00:19:05.584]  The capital comes in here, ladies and gentlemen, and then we just pour it right back into the info war.
[00:19:05.584 --> 00:19:24.781]  Just the more power you give us, the more energy you give us, the more you feed into our cyclotronic converters, the more we fire out as you, the population, then pick up that information and then like diodes or dynamos or relays, you up the power and just continue upping the power, upping the
[00:19:27.308 --> 00:19:37.657]  Resonant information warfare as the New World Order quakes in their boots as more and more people find out it's okay to stand up and speak out and expose the tyranny.
[00:19:37.657 --> 00:19:41.320]  I'm gonna come back and briefly get into the huge victories we're having for 9-11 Truth.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.403]  Daniel Sinjada joining us today to pop in with his views on what's happening.
[00:19:45.403 --> 00:19:49.607]  We got the Watson Brothers joining us from England with incredible news I haven't even gotten into.
[00:19:49.607 --> 00:19:53.130]  It's just an ultra-massive important revolutionary transmission!
[00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:57.611]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:57.611 --> 00:20:07.080]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:14.166]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:14.887 --> 00:20:20.869]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:31.653]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:32.253 --> 00:20:32.853]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:32.853 --> 00:20:33.814]  A new world order.
[00:20:33.814 --> 00:20:35.155]  In the near future.
[00:21:00.194 --> 00:21:03.256]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:03.256 --> 00:21:06.078]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:06.078 --> 00:21:08.861]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:12.063]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:19.368]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:22.409 --> 00:21:27.833]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:27.833 --> 00:21:31.695]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:31.695 --> 00:21:34.277]  The Old America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:34.277 --> 00:21:35.438]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:35.438 --> 00:21:36.238]  They're not after money.
[00:21:36.238 --> 00:21:37.519]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:37.519 --> 00:21:38.500]  They're after power.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.641]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:21:39.641 --> 00:21:48.366]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:48.366 --> 00:21:51.168]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:21:51.168 --> 00:21:52.209]  You have been warned.
[00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:56.372]  Some day, cancer, diabetes, and poor health may disrupt your life.
[00:21:56.372 --> 00:21:59.335]  Are you going to be the one in four who gets cancer in their lifetime?
[00:21:59.335 --> 00:22:03.298]  Well, now you can set aside your worries and offset that chance with Alka-Vita.
[00:22:03.298 --> 00:22:10.164]  Alka-Vita is a pure elemental liquid silicon that is high in oxygen and highly alkaline to help balance our acidic lifestyles.
[00:22:10.164 --> 00:22:16.550]  Fast food and unhealthy habits contribute to excess acid and undesirable effects that lay foundations of disease and poor health.
[00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.772]  Do you remember the old saying, an apple a day keeps the doctor away?
[00:22:19.772 --> 00:22:21.373]  Those words of wisdom are true.
[00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:29.098]  Your body heals itself when eating well, rather than fighting the effects of chemicals like corn syrup, sugar, preservatives, and other unpronounceable ingredients.
[00:22:29.098 --> 00:22:38.384]  Your body is the best pharmacy in the world, and with Alka-Vita, it can help your body naturally neutralize excess body acid, and help hydrate your body, promoting the energized, healthier you.

[00:22:57.456 --> 00:22:59.617]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:22:59.617 --> 00:23:01.517]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:23:01.517 --> 00:23:02.998]  The late great USA.
[00:23:02.998 --> 00:23:04.778]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:23:04.778 --> 00:23:11.800]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:24:03.843 --> 00:24:12.650]  Daniel Sonjata, star of Rescue Me and a lot of other TV programs, movies, you name it, will be popping in on the next segment.
[00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.352]  Then the Watson brothers are going to join us.
[00:24:15.352 --> 00:24:21.977]  This is the huge, huge news.
[00:24:21.977 --> 00:24:28.021]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:24:28.021 --> 00:24:29.002]  This is huge.
[00:24:29.002 --> 00:24:32.545]  Chinese paramilitary thugs policed London Torch rally.
[00:24:33.752 --> 00:24:49.361]  It has been confirmed that in Paris, in London, and in many other European major cities as the torch comes through, there are hundreds of paramilitary police, the same units used to suppress and arrest political dissidents in China, and the British police, with them,
[00:24:50.226 --> 00:25:06.732]  Manhandle, beat, attack, slam British citizens, French citizens, and if there's any free Tibet signs, this is confirmed by mainstream French news, and there's photos of all this and video, they run up and grab the Tibetan signs away, French police with Chinese murdering thugs.
[00:25:06.732 --> 00:25:12.054]  Communists, these are the folks that take you and kill you if you speak out against the government in China.
[00:25:12.054 --> 00:25:15.335]  And now they're allowed to come to France and England.
[00:25:16.661 --> 00:25:19.162]  And they are allowed to do whatever they want.
[00:25:19.162 --> 00:25:23.983]  Now, Paul has put together a big laundry list of examples.
[00:25:23.983 --> 00:25:33.925]  In fact, he wrote this story this morning, and I called up and said, Paul, add all the other stuff, the other articles we've done, about Ukrainian troops that just showed up in Northern England and suddenly started searching everybody.
[00:25:33.925 --> 00:25:36.265]  And they said, yeah, the Ukrainian troops are here.
[00:25:36.265 --> 00:25:40.446]  Notice every time there's a flood, the Mexican troops come in and they make a big PR stunt.
[00:25:40.446 --> 00:25:44.507]  Or we get attacked on 9-11 and there's Norwegian AWACS and F-16s.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:51.962]  It's any precedent they can set, or the police exchange programs, or the deal signed to use Canadian and Mexican troops in the U.S.
[00:25:51.962 --> 00:25:55.764]  during, quote, disasters, or to fight terrorists.
[00:25:55.764 --> 00:26:13.671]  I mean, the unthinkable is happening, but who would have imagined if we'd have said a month ago, oh yes, in Europe and in England, there will be Mexican paramilitary police brought over from China, and they will, with the police, will physically attack British citizens and French citizens.
[00:26:13.671 --> 00:26:14.911]  And that's the country's confirmed.
[00:26:16.098 --> 00:26:21.381]  I'm looking at video and photos of this right now.
[00:26:21.381 --> 00:26:24.563]  I just can't believe it.
[00:26:24.563 --> 00:26:28.505]  Even I can't believe that they're really doing it.
[00:26:28.505 --> 00:26:32.467]  That this is really being manifest.
[00:26:32.467 --> 00:26:37.349]  That it's not the stuff of talk now.
[00:26:37.349 --> 00:26:40.031]  It's not hypothetical.
[00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:42.692]  And it's all done by design.
[00:26:42.692 --> 00:26:43.793]  This is meant by the
[00:26:44.654 --> 00:27:04.760]  Social psychologists, by the behavioral psychologists, that are engineering our society to make this an unreal world, a bizarre world, where they're ordered that when Tibetan protesters, about 50 of them, peacefully show up in front of the UN, it's on video.
[00:27:05.433 --> 00:27:08.435]  The police run over and start screaming, we're going to kill you.
[00:27:08.435 --> 00:27:09.756]  That's a quote on video.
[00:27:09.756 --> 00:27:21.304]  They pull out metal batons, the retractable, extendable type, and start beating them to bloody pulp, saying, this is an unauthorized demonstration.
[00:27:21.304 --> 00:27:22.464]  I mean, this is Russia.
[00:27:22.464 --> 00:27:23.605]  This is China.
[00:27:23.605 --> 00:27:27.568]  Now, some cops haven't been converted over to the new tyranny, so they leave you alone.
[00:27:28.419 --> 00:27:37.405]  Like in Austin, Texas, because they've lost dozens and dozens of lawsuits arresting people back in the late 90s and 2000 for standing on the street corner with signs.
[00:27:37.405 --> 00:27:43.048]  They just lost another case last month where they arrested somebody at the State Supreme Court.
[00:27:43.048 --> 00:27:49.332]  But at least, because we've had so many lawsuits against them, we still have some good courts in a few spots, they've backed off here.
[00:27:49.332 --> 00:27:52.754]  But New York, you demonstrate without a permit, they come out and they arrest you.
[00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:53.735]  But if you're Tibetans,
[00:27:56.019 --> 00:28:05.609]  They extend metal batons in New York City, and I mean full power, police, big men, full power with metal batons.
[00:28:05.609 --> 00:28:08.552]  Long extent, I mean, it's like a sword, it's got so much power.
[00:28:10.197 --> 00:28:15.041]  I actually had to do some stunts in Scanner Darkly, even though I'm not a really certified stuntman.
[00:28:15.041 --> 00:28:21.607]  These big football players basically jabbed me with it, and then I had to hit my knees, and I got all bloody, because I had to do like 10 takes, dragging me.
[00:28:21.607 --> 00:28:26.932]  And I weighed a lot, so they would rip my skin, and they'd pick me up under the suit, and the suit all got ripped up, and clothes everywhere.
[00:28:27.612 --> 00:28:30.834]  It's rotoscoped afterwards with the film, so you don't see all that.
[00:28:30.834 --> 00:28:32.955]  But I mean, just being jabbed, because they wanted it to be real.
[00:28:32.955 --> 00:28:37.858]  They said, go ahead and give him somewhat of a jab, so he knows when to, you know, act like he's been hit by juice.
[00:28:37.858 --> 00:28:40.079]  And just, somebody barely hit me with 1 Hertz.
[00:28:40.079 --> 00:28:42.961]  These are metal, retractable.
[00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:43.841]  It's like an antenna.
[00:28:43.841 --> 00:28:46.163]  You can cut somebody to pieces with the old-fashioned metal antennas.
[00:28:47.768 --> 00:28:49.789]  And, I mean, this cop shirt is full power.
[00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:50.529]  Wham!
[00:28:50.529 --> 00:28:50.909]  Wham!
[00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:53.530]  As they lay on the ground begging, AHHHH!
[00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:54.451]  PLEASE!
[00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:55.871]  NOOOO!
[00:28:55.871 --> 00:28:56.852]  We ought to play the audio of that.
[00:28:56.852 --> 00:28:57.752]  I think we've played it before.
[00:28:57.752 --> 00:29:00.393]  And just, yeah, savage hate!
[00:29:00.393 --> 00:29:01.534]  Death to America!
[00:29:01.534 --> 00:29:03.574]  Death to the First Amendment!
[00:29:03.574 --> 00:29:04.855]  We hate our country!
[00:29:04.855 --> 00:29:08.816]  We are with the Chinese murderers!
[00:29:08.816 --> 00:29:10.777]  And then there's all this disinfo everywhere.
[00:29:10.777 --> 00:29:14.959]  Where, I mean, I was in Whole Foods last night buying some medicine for one of my children.
[00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:20.443]  And there was, like, two different magazine covers that said, you know, China's not dangerous.
[00:29:20.443 --> 00:29:21.364]  China's good.
[00:29:21.364 --> 00:29:23.205]  China's helpful.
[00:29:23.205 --> 00:29:24.166]  China's wonderful.
[00:29:24.166 --> 00:29:26.228]  Yeah, they just killed 60 million people.
[00:29:26.228 --> 00:29:29.691]  They just take Falun Gong dissidents who are totally peaceful and harvest their organs.
[00:29:32.304 --> 00:29:36.225]  But don't worry, now they're gonna come to America and England!
[00:29:36.225 --> 00:29:42.287]  Now they're gonna beat you in the head with clubs and knock your teeth out with savage pleasure!
[00:29:42.287 --> 00:29:44.168]  And you're gonna thank the government!
[00:29:44.168 --> 00:29:45.548]  We're on the march.
[00:29:45.548 --> 00:29:48.089]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:31:56.883 --> 00:32:00.625]  Have you noticed how every type of gadget these days requires some specific type of battery?

[00:32:47.717 --> 00:32:49.338]  Ooh, she don't want me, so that might be the end.
[00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:28.931]  Maybe.
[00:33:28.931 --> 00:33:35.956]  I'm afraid the truth of 9-11 is coming out and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
[00:33:35.956 --> 00:33:37.497]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:33:37.497 --> 00:33:41.019]  The terrorist will be exposed.
[00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:43.320]  You didn't believe me.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:52.946]  Years ago when I told you that we could defeat tyranny, that we have power, their biggest lie
[00:33:56.158 --> 00:33:59.039]  That they can't be beaten, they're invincible.
[00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:03.780]  Their biggest lie is that you don't have power.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.661]  My friends, we are made in the image of the creator of the universe.
[00:34:07.661 --> 00:34:13.603]  What humans envision, they later construct and build.
[00:34:13.603 --> 00:34:19.765]  That's why the elite poison our water and our vaccines and our food and their own documents to dumb us down.
[00:34:19.765 --> 00:34:23.786]  That's why they engineered AIDS as a bio-weapon to kill the third world.
[00:34:26.408 --> 00:34:29.291]  Because they're jealous and they hate people that have life force.
[00:34:29.291 --> 00:34:33.054]  They hate humanity.
[00:34:33.054 --> 00:34:34.495]  And they're gonna be defeated.
[00:34:34.495 --> 00:34:37.477]  I want to play about a two-minute clip of Jesse Ventura last night on Fox News.
[00:34:37.477 --> 00:34:38.778]  You talk about a breakthrough.
[00:34:38.778 --> 00:34:40.900]  He came on this show.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:45.224]  He came on this show and he said during a break, I want to go ahead and go public on 9-11.
[00:34:45.224 --> 00:34:49.988]  And he came on and he dropped the bomb on this show without me even asking him.
[00:34:49.988 --> 00:34:51.569]  That's fate!
[00:34:51.569 --> 00:34:54.732]  It's fate that he came on this show first to start his book tour.
[00:34:56.149 --> 00:35:01.351]  And then now it's all over the place, hundreds of talk shows, all over television.
[00:35:01.351 --> 00:35:07.373]  They are panicking, ladies and gentlemen, because it makes it safe for more and more people to speak up and step up.
[00:35:07.373 --> 00:35:16.316]  We're about to go to Daniel Sanjata, who just a few weeks ago said, called in and said, we've gotta, Alex, I just feel it in my gut, we've gotta push now, harder than ever, push this over the edge.
[00:35:16.966 --> 00:35:20.128]  To stop the attack on Iran, to stop further staged events.
[00:35:20.128 --> 00:35:21.468]  He could feel it in his guts.
[00:35:21.468 --> 00:35:22.969]  Can't you feel it in your soul?
[00:35:22.969 --> 00:35:32.294]  Go ahead and roll Ventura with that sniveling coward, that fake conservative, Sean Hannity, who just had to basically grovel.
[00:35:32.294 --> 00:35:39.158]  And for the first time ever, just had to sit there looking guilty and looking weak because they're beginning to capitulate.
[00:35:39.158 --> 00:35:41.999]  They're beginning to realize that they can't stop us!
[00:35:41.999 --> 00:35:42.800]  Here's the clap!
[00:35:43.722 --> 00:35:52.851]  The one thing that I read in the book that I just totally found just alien to me is this idea that you believe in 9-11 conspiracies.
[00:35:52.851 --> 00:35:55.653]  Well, let me tell it to you this way.
[00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:59.897]  Why is it that when you ask any question about 9-11 you're immediately attacked?
[00:35:59.977 --> 00:36:00.738]  I'm not attacking you.
[00:36:00.738 --> 00:36:02.419]  You're not, but no, I'm speaking in general.
[00:36:02.419 --> 00:36:05.661]  I'm not saying you guys, but I've watched people get attacked.
[00:36:05.661 --> 00:36:07.422]  People have their credibility attacked.
[00:36:07.422 --> 00:36:12.785]  My problem is I look at it and I go, how can two planes knock down three buildings?
[00:36:12.785 --> 00:36:13.386]  Pretty easy.
[00:36:13.386 --> 00:36:16.788]  It's a big, it's a, those are, yeah, 757, 747.
[00:36:16.788 --> 00:36:19.190]  But there were three buildings that went down.
[00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.391]  Well, there was a lot of fire and there was a lot of damage.
[00:36:21.411 --> 00:36:24.092]  Well, first of all, jet fuel blew up at the start.
[00:36:24.092 --> 00:36:25.892]  Jet fuel is four-fifths.
[00:36:25.892 --> 00:36:27.052]  And I don't want to stay on this.
[00:36:27.052 --> 00:36:28.713]  I'd rather talk other things.
[00:36:28.713 --> 00:36:30.613]  But jet fuel is four-fifths kerosene.
[00:36:30.613 --> 00:36:31.854]  It doesn't burn hot.
[00:36:31.854 --> 00:36:36.195]  So using the analogy that it could melt the metal, then propane burns hotter.
[00:36:36.195 --> 00:36:40.336]  So if you turn on your camp stove for three hours, shouldn't it melt the grates?
[00:36:40.336 --> 00:36:41.336]  But it doesn't, does it?
[00:36:41.576 --> 00:36:47.019]  I want to take one issue with Rosa, and I just question Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:36:47.019 --> 00:36:48.280]  Stop right there.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.341]  See the psychological warfare op?
[00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:54.883]  They know that she's a polarizing figure, so they say you're doing a Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:36:54.883 --> 00:36:56.604]  He can't refute any facts.
[00:36:56.604 --> 00:37:00.426]  He just brings up someone who's unpopular with about half the public.
[00:37:00.426 --> 00:37:02.628]  So he tries to make it a left-right paradigm right there.
[00:37:02.628 --> 00:37:02.988]  Continue.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.901]  Rosie O'Donnell on here.
[00:37:04.901 --> 00:37:06.641]  And I do, you know, wait a minute.
[00:37:06.641 --> 00:37:07.862]  That's Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:37:07.862 --> 00:37:09.483]  Well, I know a little bit.
[00:37:09.483 --> 00:37:11.984]  How can they fall at the rate of gravity?
[00:37:11.984 --> 00:37:13.485]  They fell at the rate of gravity in powder.
[00:37:13.485 --> 00:37:14.285]  I'm not an engineer.
[00:37:14.285 --> 00:37:15.406]  They blew into powder.
[00:37:15.406 --> 00:37:18.207]  But if it were true, a lot of engineers would have come out before that.
[00:37:18.207 --> 00:37:19.848]  Stop right there!
[00:37:19.848 --> 00:37:21.469]  Implying that engineers hadn't come out.
[00:37:21.469 --> 00:37:21.909]  Not.
[00:37:21.909 --> 00:37:32.655]  Hundreds of engineers, hundreds of architects, scores of physicists, demolitions experts from all over the world, defense ministers, former presidents of major countries,
[00:37:33.562 --> 00:37:35.263]  Again, all lies, all deception.
[00:37:35.263 --> 00:37:36.164]  We're proving this right now.
[00:37:36.164 --> 00:37:37.085]  We're about to go to Sunjata.
[00:37:37.085 --> 00:37:38.426]  Here we go.
[00:37:38.426 --> 00:37:40.448]  Before that, I want to take an issue with one thing.
[00:37:40.448 --> 00:37:43.370]  You actually had a talk show for a small period of time.
[00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:44.431]  They fired you.
[00:37:44.431 --> 00:37:44.911]  No, no, no.
[00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:48.354]  They took me off the air for three years and bought my silence.
[00:37:48.354 --> 00:37:49.175]  Stop right there.
[00:37:49.175 --> 00:37:50.055]  Another attack.
[00:37:50.055 --> 00:37:51.296]  Saying, oh, you're a loser.
[00:37:51.296 --> 00:37:52.597]  Oh, you were taken off the air.
[00:37:52.597 --> 00:37:54.259]  You're disreputable.
[00:37:54.259 --> 00:37:55.179]  See how they try that?
[00:37:55.179 --> 00:38:01.805]  No, Ventura wouldn't be muzzled about being anti-war, just like MSNBC's number one show was.
[00:38:02.699 --> 00:38:14.233]  With another former talk show host, and he was number one, and then they fired him, and then Ventura came on and got high ratings, and they canned him, so here they are spinning that too.
[00:38:14.233 --> 00:38:15.555]  Just every little trick in the book.
[00:38:15.555 --> 00:38:18.518]  Hannity has a formula, and he's just going down a formula.
[00:38:18.518 --> 00:38:18.799]  Here we go.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:29.109]  Talking about Fox and CNN and MSNBC, he said, all the stories come from upstairs, even though the host pretend it's them.
[00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:37.417]  You know, people need to understand, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and the rest of them, they're not these individual rogues setting their own agendas.
[00:38:37.417 --> 00:38:39.799]  These guys will deny it and say they have artistic freedom.
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.181]  You're really going to call me a liar?
[00:38:42.181 --> 00:38:47.943]  I'm telling you... So in other words, you chose to talk about Anna Nicole Smith for a month and a half?
[00:38:47.943 --> 00:38:53.246]  We'll play more later.
[00:38:53.246 --> 00:38:55.226]  I don't want to make Daniel sit there and hold him.
[00:38:55.226 --> 00:38:57.527]  We've only got about 15-20 minutes with him.
[00:38:57.527 --> 00:39:00.569]  Daniel Sinjada is really getting involved in 9-11 Truth.
[00:39:00.569 --> 00:39:04.450]  He's encouraging students all over the country to
[00:39:06.619 --> 00:39:09.202]  Join Student Scholars 9-11 Truth.
[00:39:09.202 --> 00:39:12.385]  We have that press release up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:39:13.622 --> 00:39:14.062]  He is.
[00:39:14.062 --> 00:39:18.965]  He went out to support Luke and others, talking to Rosie O'Donnell a few days ago.
[00:39:18.965 --> 00:39:23.408]  That's up on JonesReport.com and WeAreChanged.org right now.
[00:39:23.408 --> 00:39:24.969]  He's really taking action.
[00:39:24.969 --> 00:39:26.810]  Daniel, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:27.611]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:39:27.611 --> 00:39:29.212]  It's always a pleasure to be on your show, man.
[00:39:29.212 --> 00:39:33.894]  I just want to say, I love... I just saw that Ventura clip today, and I agree with you.
[00:39:33.894 --> 00:39:35.916]  Something is bubbling to the surface.
[00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:41.799]  I mean, he just had them totally with their pants down when he exposed the... Oh, he just chose to talk about Anna Nicole Smith for a month.
[00:39:41.799 --> 00:39:42.880]  You see, they had nothing to say.
[00:39:43.543 --> 00:39:45.609]  They're transparently foolish at this point.
[00:39:45.609 --> 00:39:47.675]  I'm telling you, Ventura is very cunning.
[00:39:49.855 --> 00:39:56.977]  Oh, that was one of the most intelligent handlings of the press, especially while addressing the sensitive topic.
[00:39:56.977 --> 00:39:57.537]  Oh, I agree!
[00:39:57.537 --> 00:40:00.538]  In fact, I was thinking that this morning when I saw it, and last night when I saw it.
[00:40:00.538 --> 00:40:08.300]  That ought to be textbook for everybody, how he was totally zen, commanding, thinking, and I know the place he was at.
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:13.862]  Everything was like in slow motion for him, so he could just sit there and with judo, destroy Hannity.
[00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.407]  Oh, and that's exactly what he did.
[00:40:16.407 --> 00:40:17.107]  And you know what, Alex?
[00:40:17.107 --> 00:40:24.994]  We have the opportunity before us to have so many more incidences of that type of thing happen on mainstream media.
[00:40:24.994 --> 00:40:28.357]  And one of the things I'm advocating right now is this thing called the Week of Truth.
[00:40:28.357 --> 00:40:42.269]  What happened recently, and for those of you who are callers that don't know, is that a lot of the leaders of various 9-11 truth groups and initiatives, like Richard Gage, David Ray Griffin, Kevin Ryan,
[00:40:43.355 --> 00:40:46.638]  Stephen Jones, Paul Craig Roberts, Peter Phillips, Dylan Avery.
[00:40:46.638 --> 00:40:48.080]  I'm just running a list of names.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.984]  Bob McElveen, Luke Rutkowski from We Are Change, Jack Blood.
[00:40:51.984 --> 00:41:05.898]  We hope we have your support with this too, Alex, but so many leaders of the 9-11 Truth Community have come together and are all supporting this Week of Truth initiative, which is to drive a book called The Shell Game, written by Steve Alton.
[00:41:06.445 --> 00:41:08.826]  Into the top ten of the New York Times Best Sellers list.
[00:41:08.826 --> 00:41:14.489]  Yeah, just to be clear, Daniel, I do support this, but we need to get this word out outside the show.
[00:41:14.489 --> 00:41:21.192]  It's actually been beaten half to death on all the Patriot-type shows at nauseam.
[00:41:21.192 --> 00:41:33.618]  So yes, the listeners know about that plan, and then he says that when he gets on national shows, what he is going to do is then talk about how 9-11 is an inside job, which he has been doing, and I am supporting that, and we've had him on.
[00:41:33.618 --> 00:41:35.459]  I'm not saying it's not a good strategia,
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:52.316]  But see how just having Ventura on and getting him to talk about it, that is now supernova, and I think that is one of the agendas, a multifaceted agenda, needs to be pushed, brought into talk shows, gotten out to people, because now it is out there breaking, because I've done this over and over again.
[00:41:52.896 --> 00:41:58.517]  And then expanding on it, I have found that films, just like he said, watch loose change, well the final cut's now out.
[00:41:58.517 --> 00:42:07.719]  Films are the general vehicle that wake most people up, plus the enemy, when they find out that that's the agenda, the word goes out and then they won't have him on the shows.
[00:42:07.719 --> 00:42:14.600]  So I think if that is the strategy, that strategy, everybody needs to be quiet about that strategy, because they do listen to these shows.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.882]  And again, I'm not up here trying to be the schoolmaster or anything, but I am the master of this.
[00:42:22.819 --> 00:42:23.359]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:42:23.359 --> 00:42:25.881]  I mean, I hear what you're saying, Alex, and you may very well be right.
[00:42:25.881 --> 00:42:29.204]  I don't know much about strategy when it comes to planning these types of actions.
[00:42:29.204 --> 00:42:31.966]  I just, my emotion wants to throw myself into it wholeheartedly.
[00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:33.047]  Well, that is the strategy.
[00:42:33.047 --> 00:42:35.228]  You've thrown yourself into it wholeheartedly.
[00:42:35.228 --> 00:42:39.191]  Tell us about when the Week of Change is coming up.
[00:42:39.191 --> 00:42:45.756]  Okay, it's going to be, it's between the 16th and the 22nd of April, down in about six days.
[00:42:45.756 --> 00:42:49.119]  It's the Week of Truth, and if people want to find out about it, it's weekoftruth.org.
[00:42:50.474 --> 00:42:53.895]  Uh, www.weekoftruth.org, where all the details are laid out.
[00:42:53.895 --> 00:42:54.475]  Okay.
[00:42:54.475 --> 00:43:01.418]  And basically, you know, hopefully, Steve is a man of his word, and when he gets a microphone in his face, he'll say, why don't you interview Alex Jones?
[00:43:01.418 --> 00:43:02.698]  Why don't you interview Richard Gage?
[00:43:02.698 --> 00:43:04.339]  Why don't you interview David Ray Griffin?
[00:43:04.339 --> 00:43:08.200]  Yeah, that's all fantastic, and I think that's great, and it's a great plan.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:12.722]  And as long as we hatch lots of plans like this, fire lots of torpedoes at the enemy,
[00:43:14.142 --> 00:43:17.225]  You know, supership, their flagship.
[00:43:17.225 --> 00:43:18.666]  Then we know torpedoes will hit.
[00:43:18.666 --> 00:43:20.768]  All of them may not hit.
[00:43:20.768 --> 00:43:32.217]  But right now, I'm doing everything I can to quietly reach out to celebrities I know who haven't gone public, who I've known for years, know that 9-11's an inside job, and a lot of them are listening right now.
[00:43:32.217 --> 00:43:34.599]  I'm asking them to go ahead and go public.
[00:43:34.599 --> 00:43:35.680]  That's the key.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.302]  And again, all of these plans are great.
[00:43:37.302 --> 00:43:41.265]  It's good to have lots of operations going, because the enemy can't react or deal with all of them.
[00:43:42.074 --> 00:43:44.955]  You call it leaderless resistance?
[00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:45.895]  Yes.
[00:43:45.895 --> 00:43:47.296]  Yes, I agree.
[00:43:47.296 --> 00:43:48.376]  I absolutely agree.
[00:43:48.376 --> 00:43:54.638]  I do think that it's important for us all, though, in our various pursuits, to keep in mind the overarching imperative of 9-11 truth.
[00:43:54.638 --> 00:44:07.101]  And when we have something that we can all actively participate in as a group with focused intent, the power of that is the differences, you know, like the power of a finger versus the power of a fist.
[00:44:07.577 --> 00:44:10.059]  You know, sometimes we have the opportunity before us to activate.
[00:44:10.059 --> 00:44:13.521]  Yeah, but I mean, you think this Ventura thing is big at all, or?
[00:44:13.521 --> 00:44:14.462]  Oh, it's huge!
[00:44:14.462 --> 00:44:15.722]  I think that's huge.
[00:44:15.722 --> 00:44:16.623]  I'm saying what I'm saying.
[00:44:16.623 --> 00:44:30.472]  So I'm saying that's happening right now, that's happening right now, breaching their main defenses, and so I'm saying wherever you fire at one of their capital ships, and it starts exploding, intensify firepower.
[00:44:31.218 --> 00:44:52.214]  And if you can have major, and I see this as a war, flagship attacks, and sink flagships, that panics and demoralizes the enemy, and the enemy is now being demoralized, and now we smell blood, and that invigorates our forces to further ravage with rapine against them in the Info War.
[00:44:52.214 --> 00:44:58.099]  So Daniel Sinjada, just like when you called in a few weeks ago to the Sunday Show, you were all fired up saying, we just got to all intensify our efforts,
[00:44:58.499 --> 00:45:05.737]  I mean, are you not feeling really excited right now to see what's happening and see this burgeoning awakening that's taking place?
[00:45:06.374 --> 00:45:09.495]  Yes, it fills me with, absolutely, it gives me hope.
[00:45:09.495 --> 00:45:21.800]  It makes me really feel like, especially now considering the critical time juncture that we find ourselves in, I mean, you know, I'm just, sometimes I want to see what the enemy is doing, so I'll look at Fox News, I guess, just to torture myself for a little bit.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:27.803]  Just the other day, I saw them run story after story about homegrown terror plots, suitcase nukes.
[00:45:27.803 --> 00:45:31.364]  I mean, they are definitely trying to prime the pump and get the public mind ready.
[00:45:31.724 --> 00:45:32.284]  For something.
[00:45:32.284 --> 00:45:38.988]  I don't want to spread paranoia and fear, but I'm trying to communicate the seriousness of the time in which we find ourselves.
[00:45:38.988 --> 00:45:49.694]  And so yes, Ventura coming out, Luce Che, Endgame, Week of Truth, all of these things, again it's a leaderless resistance, but wherever you can put your efforts,
[00:45:50.894 --> 00:45:54.796]  People need to just be active and be engaged because this is a very critical time.
[00:45:54.796 --> 00:45:56.876]  No, no, exactly!
[00:45:56.876 --> 00:46:11.381]  That's my point today, Daniel, is that we owe you and so many others a great debt of gratitude because, you know, it isn't just that you've got a popular TV show or you're in a lot of other TV programs, and it isn't just that Charlie Sheen's got the number one sitcom, and it isn't just that
[00:46:13.448 --> 00:46:35.535]  that the italian president should we ask it but especially with with actors and with actresses it's that is that you know you're gonna be attacked you know they're gonna go after you you know that it is a celebrity obsessed culture and you're doing it as a sacrifice uh... because you know overall with your career you pretty much only stand to lose and so you're risking a lot and people c
[00:46:37.601 --> 00:46:43.527]  Uh, you throwing, you know, all of it on the table, going in for broke, going in all the way, and they resonate with that courage.
[00:46:43.527 --> 00:46:55.637]  And now, with a former governor, and Jesse Ventura, who's very popular, and they had a Larry King poll, you know, 80 plus percent saying, you know, they'd support him for president, with what he was saying on that show about America's a fascist tyranny.
[00:46:55.637 --> 00:47:01.623]  Uh, he's saying on shows, you know, we have the right to rise up with arms against the government, if they try to put us in FEMA camps.
[00:47:02.083 --> 00:47:05.707]  I mean, my point is, who else is going to come out in the next week, the next month?
[00:47:05.707 --> 00:47:18.440]  I mean, we're now already on the wave, on the crest of the wave, moving forward right now, and we are witnessing history, and we are witnessing destiny, and good rising up against evil.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.082]  I wanted to get your response to that statement.
[00:47:20.732 --> 00:47:22.173]  I mean, what can I say, Alex?
[00:47:22.173 --> 00:47:23.453]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:47:23.453 --> 00:47:24.493]  That's what we're seeing.
[00:47:24.493 --> 00:47:26.754]  The House of Cards is definitely beginning to tumble.
[00:47:26.754 --> 00:47:41.380]  When you have people like Jesse Ventura coming on, giving an interview that well, and getting that much information out there on that big of a public platform, hopefully people on his level of visibility will follow that example and start coming out.
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:48.202]  The people that you are insinuating listen to your show, that you know that 9-11 is an inside job, the more people come out and direct
[00:47:48.755 --> 00:47:53.937]  People's attention, you know, towards things that, you know, towards this particular issue that matters.
[00:47:53.937 --> 00:47:57.138]  I mean, yeah, you know, the House of Cards is troubling.
[00:47:57.138 --> 00:48:02.220]  Well, this is like Nixon saying, I'm not a crook, or Clinton, I didn't sleep with that woman, how dare you?
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:05.821]  I mean, people see the guilt, the way they behave, the way they tried to cover Rob.
[00:48:06.713 --> 00:48:08.793]  Uh, just like Ventura talked about.
[00:48:08.793 --> 00:48:10.654]  Oh, you're going, you're going Rosie O'Donnell on me.
[00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:14.795]  That's his best response to the scientific stuff that Jesse Ventura just said.
[00:48:14.795 --> 00:48:15.495]  Oh my God.
[00:48:15.495 --> 00:48:21.876]  And Ventura also talked about, when he was on the Stupid Opie and Andy Show, you know, that, hey, why is the government act so suspicious?
[00:48:21.876 --> 00:48:23.017]  Why do they hide things?
[00:48:23.017 --> 00:48:26.657]  Boy, they sure got a lot of power out of this.
[00:48:26.657 --> 00:48:27.878]  Hmm.
[00:48:27.878 --> 00:48:29.018]  Yeah.
[00:48:29.018 --> 00:48:29.678]  Makes a lot of sense.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:39.709]  You know, I mean, at this point, it's obvious, or it should be obvious to any rational observer what the situation is, and they're obviously hiding something.
[00:48:39.709 --> 00:48:42.812]  I mean, hey, look, we can draw all kinds of conclusions, but
[00:48:43.821 --> 00:48:49.046]  One of the main points is that we have what is necessary to demand a reinvestigation.
[00:48:49.046 --> 00:48:49.686]  We have that.
[00:48:49.686 --> 00:48:52.269]  All we need is a form from which to do it, you know?
[00:48:52.269 --> 00:49:04.119]  And once people know that this topic is being debated by credible experts, that lots of people are shouting this stuff from the rooftops, and they just haven't been told about it on mainstream media news sources, people are going to be upset.
[00:49:04.119 --> 00:49:06.661]  They're going to inform themselves, and then what will they do then?
[00:49:06.661 --> 00:49:07.702]  How will they stop it then?
[00:49:07.702 --> 00:49:09.804]  It'll truly be a movement of the people, all of the people.
[00:49:10.194 --> 00:49:13.382]  Well, they've been trying to minimize it or put it in a political corner.
[00:49:14.131 --> 00:49:34.601]  But now with politicians and people being confronted everywhere by We Are Change and 9-11 Truth and other groups, and with more and more high-profile engineers and presidents and defense ministers, I mean, I keep repeating that, and then now all these big actors and Academy Award-winning best actresses, and I mean, it's really starting to panic them.
[00:49:34.601 --> 00:49:39.504]  And just like Tricky Dick, who was in trouble for much smaller things, you know, they finally went down.
[00:49:39.504 --> 00:49:41.104]  It finally came out.
[00:49:41.104 --> 00:49:41.945]  And I guarantee you,
[00:49:42.825 --> 00:49:49.088]  In the White House, in the Pentagon, over in England, and other countries that were involved.
[00:49:49.088 --> 00:49:52.970]  They know now, and they understand, they're in a lot of trouble.
[00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:57.092]  And you're right, you bring up Fox, I track what they're reporting on as well.
[00:49:57.092 --> 00:50:00.213]  We're going to be nuked, there's white Al Qaeda everywhere.
[00:50:00.213 --> 00:50:03.055]  See, by doing that, they can now target everyone.
[00:50:03.055 --> 00:50:06.616]  They want to shift it away from Arabs, as we always said, like Hitler did.
[00:50:06.616 --> 00:50:07.917]  He beta tested on Jews.
[00:50:08.437 --> 00:50:16.680]  But by the time he was done, once the public accepted discriminating against them and oppressing them and seizing what they had, then they moved it on to everybody.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:20.382]  Or if the SS captain on your block wanted your wife, he'd have you sent away.
[00:50:20.382 --> 00:50:22.883]  Didn't matter if you were quote a good German.
[00:50:22.883 --> 00:50:25.044]  And had gone along with all the other evils.
[00:50:25.044 --> 00:50:25.384]  And so...
[00:50:26.124 --> 00:50:28.065]  They are now pulling out the stop singers.
[00:50:28.065 --> 00:50:30.687]  White Al-Qaeda, blonde-haired blue eyes, they're everywhere.
[00:50:30.687 --> 00:50:32.829]  Watch everyone, your neighbor's Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:35.711]  And it's becoming completely comic book.
[00:50:35.711 --> 00:50:37.632]  Daniel Sanjada, one more segment with you, my friend.
[00:50:37.632 --> 00:50:46.338]  I want to talk about your ideas for moving forward and just getting everybody else to put their full weight against the info war today.
[00:50:46.338 --> 00:50:49.320]  Just everything in the info war to drive over the enemy.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.743]  It's like we're all on a battering ram together, ramming it at the gates.
[00:50:54.150 --> 00:51:07.301]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:07.301 --> 00:51:18.369]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:51:18.369 --> 00:51:20.611]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose
[00:51:21.772 --> 00:51:23.533]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:51:23.533 --> 00:51:29.658]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:52:28.743 --> 00:52:32.386]  And brings funguses, viruses, and bacterial levels down and to a halt.

[00:52:41.554 --> 00:52:45.358]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the US?
[00:52:45.618 --> 00:52:48.140]  This product is also great for pets and animals.

[00:52:53.884 --> 00:52:55.945]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:52:55.945 --> 00:52:59.227]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:52:59.227 --> 00:53:04.191]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:53:04.191 --> 00:53:07.093]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:53:07.093 --> 00:53:11.876]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[00:53:12.156 --> 00:53:14.138]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:53:14.138 --> 00:53:20.144]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:53:20.144 --> 00:53:22.266]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[00:53:22.266 --> 00:53:26.550]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:31.134]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong
[00:53:31.334 --> 00:53:37.956]  That they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[00:53:37.956 --> 00:53:43.257]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[00:53:43.257 --> 00:53:46.518]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[00:53:46.518 --> 00:53:47.118]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:53:47.118 --> 00:53:48.698]  That's 888-USE-SFR1 today!
[00:53:58.906 --> 00:54:01.027]  I hear the train a-comin'.
[00:54:01.027 --> 00:54:03.287]  It's rollin' around a bit.
[00:54:03.287 --> 00:54:06.008]  And I ain't seen the sunshine since.
[00:54:06.008 --> 00:54:07.608]  I don't know when.
[00:54:07.608 --> 00:54:10.409]  I'm stuck in Folsom Prison.
[00:54:10.409 --> 00:54:16.190]  And time keeps draggin' on.
[00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:18.611]  But that train keeps rollin'.
[00:54:18.611 --> 00:54:21.532]  Daniel Sinjad, I gotta get him up for a full hour in the near future.
[00:54:21.532 --> 00:54:22.552]  He's busy, I'm busy.
[00:54:23.622 --> 00:54:25.083]  I appreciate him coming on on short notice.
[00:54:25.083 --> 00:54:26.804]  He's got work to do today.
[00:54:26.804 --> 00:54:40.233]  Daniel, let me in the next few weeks get you up for a full hour to take phone calls and it's just great getting to meet you in New York and great getting to know you and I just I appreciate your courage and everybody else's courage.
[00:54:40.233 --> 00:54:44.296]  He's very prominent for standing up in the three or four minutes we've got left in this hour.
[00:54:44.296 --> 00:54:46.858]  What else?
[00:54:46.858 --> 00:54:47.959]  To the listeners.
[00:54:47.959 --> 00:54:49.720]  Question Alex, I'm sorry I lost you for a second.
[00:54:50.772 --> 00:54:52.353]  Yeah, my ISDN line's cutting out.
[00:54:52.353 --> 00:54:54.514]  Daniel, can you hear me?
[00:54:54.514 --> 00:54:56.315]  Yes, I can.
[00:54:56.315 --> 00:54:56.775]  Yes, I can.
[00:54:56.775 --> 00:54:58.116]  Okay, good, Daniel.
[00:54:58.116 --> 00:54:58.737]  Yes.
[00:54:58.737 --> 00:54:59.757]  Okay, good.
[00:54:59.757 --> 00:55:02.679]  What do you think is most important right now for people to know?
[00:55:02.679 --> 00:55:09.102]  Well, I mean, I think that I want to, you know, we were talking offline there, and I think what we were talking about is more people coming out.
[00:55:09.102 --> 00:55:18.688]  And I think that I would just like to put out the invitation again to all of the celebrities or high-profile individuals, you know, who listen to this show, who have not yet come out.
[00:55:19.484 --> 00:55:21.445]  You know, use Alex's show as your platform.
[00:55:21.445 --> 00:55:24.046]  You know, Jesse decided to come out on Alex's show first.
[00:55:24.046 --> 00:55:26.427]  Charlie Sheen came out on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:55:26.427 --> 00:55:34.690]  You know, those of you who are fans of what Alex does and admire him for his patriotism and speaking out about 9-11 truth, why don't you follow his example?
[00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:35.890]  Come on his show.
[00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:36.851]  Do the same.
[00:55:36.851 --> 00:55:41.672]  You know, at this point, you know, at this point, you have no other choice.
[00:55:41.672 --> 00:55:44.333]  If you're an activist, if you're an artist, you have to be an activist.
[00:55:44.333 --> 00:55:46.614]  You know, or you have to betray, or you have to sell out.
[00:55:46.614 --> 00:55:48.475]  You know, or you're betraying your moral conscience.
[00:55:48.971 --> 00:56:04.249]  The only reason this show is a good place to do it is because in the alternative media we are the biggest and we're able and we know how to force it to break into the mainstream and to basically puncture the control grid that they put around it.
[00:56:04.249 --> 00:56:05.070]  Right.
[00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:05.250]  Right.
[00:56:05.871 --> 00:56:07.592]  And you know what, let me qualify that last statement.
[00:56:07.592 --> 00:56:09.313]  You know, I guess that sounded accusatory.
[00:56:09.313 --> 00:56:12.775]  I don't want to judge people who haven't come out, who have a lot to lose.
[00:56:12.775 --> 00:56:16.518]  Because admittedly, I don't have that much to lose, so it might be a little bit easier for me.
[00:56:16.518 --> 00:56:17.719]  I don't have millions.
[00:56:17.719 --> 00:56:18.319]  I don't have a lot.
[00:56:18.319 --> 00:56:21.981]  You know, I don't have a huge family and all that kind of stuff to look out for.
[00:56:21.981 --> 00:56:24.323]  So, you know, who am I to say when people should come out?
[00:56:24.323 --> 00:56:30.807]  When I said selling out, I guess what I mean is, for myself, I would have felt like I was selling out on my moral conscience to not speak out.
[00:56:31.107 --> 00:56:37.198]  Well, I mean... ...and you're choosing to remain silent, you have to feel something similar to that, so please, please come forward.
[00:56:37.198 --> 00:56:37.519]  That's all.
[00:56:38.274 --> 00:56:45.255]  Sure, and when you realize that you do have a lot to lose coming out, but you have a lot more to lose if you don't come out.
[00:56:45.255 --> 00:56:59.278]  I mean, these are serious people that'll blow up buildings and kill 3,000 people and stage fake wars and lie about hundreds of major issues and set up police state grids and sign torture memos saying, torture small children.
[00:56:59.278 --> 00:57:07.100]  And then now more memos have come out saying, we don't even care about the Fourth Amendment, showing that when they now claim, oh, the Fourth Amendment lets us spy on you without warrants,
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:09.862]  That they knew that they were lying.
[00:57:09.862 --> 00:57:11.644]  I mean, these are criminals!
[00:57:11.644 --> 00:57:14.086]  Yeah, and you're responsible for what you know.
[00:57:14.086 --> 00:57:16.068]  Once you know, you have to speak out.
[00:57:16.068 --> 00:57:22.453]  Especially if you have a microphone in front of you and a platform upon which millions of people will hear what you have to say.
[00:57:22.453 --> 00:57:25.496]  So, you're right, Alex.
[00:57:25.496 --> 00:57:34.104]  Well, Daniel, I hope I can have you up for a full hour in the near future, and I really appreciate... And I really appreciate all the hard work you're doing, Daniel.
[00:57:34.801 --> 00:57:37.504]  Alright, thank you so much, Alex, and hopefully I'll talk to you soon, my friend.
[00:57:37.504 --> 00:57:38.406]  Be well.
[00:57:38.406 --> 00:57:38.986]  You bet, Daniel.
[00:57:38.986 --> 00:57:39.767]  Just stay there one moment.
[00:57:39.767 --> 00:57:46.455]  I want to tell you one last thing before we end this hour and we go out of break here in just a moment.
[00:57:46.455 --> 00:57:48.358]  Okay, shifting gears, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:49.364 --> 00:57:50.664]  Sorry about some of the cutouts there.
[00:57:50.664 --> 00:57:56.526]  We're having a lot of problems with my connections from Texas to Minnesota, and we're trying to work through that, so we apologize to the listeners and affiliates.
[00:57:56.526 --> 00:58:02.268]  And we're sounding a little bit broken up and choppy there with Daniel, and I apologize to him, kind of breaking up my flow and his flow.
[00:58:02.268 --> 00:58:04.888]  But that's just what happens with technology and long-distance things.
[00:58:04.888 --> 00:58:07.189]  We're going to start the next hour with the Watson brothers.
[00:58:07.189 --> 00:58:09.950]  We're going to go ahead and get them online now.
[00:58:10.786 --> 00:58:14.508]  In England, Chinese paramilitary thugs police London Torch Rally.
[00:58:14.508 --> 00:58:15.988]  They're doing it all over Europe.
[00:58:15.988 --> 00:58:19.470]  This is a major escalation in the New World Order's operations.
[00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:20.890]  That is coming up.
[00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:31.535]  All right, that was an interview with Daniel Senjata, one of the stars of Rescue Me and many other TV programs, who's bravely been saying we've got to intensify our efforts.
[00:58:31.535 --> 00:58:34.896]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:34.896 --> 00:58:36.177]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:39.731 --> 00:58:44.556]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:44.556 --> 00:58:45.977]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:45.977 --> 00:58:48.779]  A new world order.
[00:58:48.779 --> 00:58:53.684]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:53.684 --> 00:58:56.507]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:56.507 --> 00:58:58.669]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:59.295 --> 00:59:02.482]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:02.482 --> 00:59:09.798]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:12.833 --> 00:59:18.257]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:18.257 --> 00:59:21.659]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:42.773 --> 00:59:46.559]  Yeah.
[00:59:46.559 --> 00:59:48.982]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.982 --> 00:59:51.726]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.433 --> 01:00:00.194]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:00.194 --> 01:00:01.775]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.775 --> 01:00:03.337]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.337 --> 01:00:07.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.603]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.729 --> 01:00:32.390]  Don't start the revolution without me.
[01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:35.372]  Former Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura, your first appearance.
[01:00:35.372 --> 01:00:35.772]  How are you?
[01:00:35.772 --> 01:00:36.172]  Thank you.
[01:00:36.172 --> 01:00:36.913]  I'm doing great.
[01:00:36.913 --> 01:00:37.633]  Hi, Alan.
[01:00:37.633 --> 01:00:38.453]  Nice to see you.
[01:00:38.453 --> 01:00:39.234]  Nice to be here.
[01:00:39.234 --> 01:00:43.656]  All I want in politics, now when Republicans are right, I support them.
[01:00:43.656 --> 01:00:46.238]  When they're wrong, I fiercely oppose them.
[01:00:46.238 --> 01:00:50.860]  I probably disagree with John McCain maybe 35-40% of the time now.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:55.723]  When President Bush, who I like a lot, and you don't, when I disagree... I did.
[01:00:55.723 --> 01:00:56.603]  I know you did.
[01:00:56.603 --> 01:00:57.224]  Because you're right.
[01:00:57.224 --> 01:00:58.885]  But when he's wrong, I disagree with him.
[01:00:59.745 --> 01:01:01.547]  I want everyone to be that honest.
[01:01:01.547 --> 01:01:02.328]  I agree with you.
[01:01:02.328 --> 01:01:03.049]  Okay, good.
[01:01:03.049 --> 01:01:04.170]  Let's start the revolution.
[01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:04.890]  There we go.
[01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:05.531]  I'm ready.
[01:01:05.531 --> 01:01:06.472]  Lower taxes?
[01:01:06.472 --> 01:01:06.953]  Yep.
[01:01:06.953 --> 01:01:08.454]  Less government intervention in our lives?
[01:01:08.454 --> 01:01:08.854]  Yep.
[01:01:08.854 --> 01:01:10.156]  Individual responsibility?
[01:01:10.156 --> 01:01:10.576]  Yep.
[01:01:10.576 --> 01:01:12.878]  Secure our borders?
[01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:13.739]  No.
[01:01:13.739 --> 01:01:15.801]  Keep them wide open so enemies can come in?
[01:01:15.801 --> 01:01:17.123]  No.
[01:01:17.123 --> 01:01:17.924]  Enemies come in.
[01:01:18.824 --> 01:01:24.887]  Uh, I don't get the fact that the supposed enemies came in from Canada, so we're fencing off Mexico?
[01:01:24.887 --> 01:01:26.888]  Well, don't our enemies... How do we manage that?
[01:01:26.888 --> 01:01:28.529]  Shouldn't we be fencing off Canada?
[01:01:28.529 --> 01:01:29.610]  Well, both.
[01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:30.150]  Both?
[01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.350]  Yeah.
[01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:32.631]  I don't want to live in East Berlin, Sean.
[01:01:32.631 --> 01:01:33.532]  I don't either.
[01:01:33.532 --> 01:01:34.532]  I don't want to live in East Berlin.
[01:01:34.532 --> 01:01:37.734]  But I don't want to live in a country where enemies can cross over at will either.
[01:01:37.734 --> 01:01:38.914]  Well, I look at it this way.
[01:01:38.914 --> 01:01:41.956]  We're losing our rights because of the Patriot Act.
[01:01:41.956 --> 01:01:45.978]  I would rather, and as I say in my book and I'm so crass to say, give me liberty or give
[01:01:46.438 --> 01:01:47.159]  I'm with you.
[01:01:47.159 --> 01:01:53.446]  I would rather take my chances with terrorism than to lose my individual rights, which are vanishing every day.
[01:01:53.446 --> 01:02:00.254]  You told a story in the book about you and Senator McCain that you would have run with him in 2000 if he left the Republican Party.
[01:02:00.254 --> 01:02:00.694]  Yep.
[01:02:00.694 --> 01:02:04.939]  If he had quit the Republican Party and ran as an independent, I told him I would have joined him.
[01:02:04.939 --> 01:02:06.501]  I do not feel that way today.
[01:02:07.042 --> 01:02:16.155]  The one thing that I read in the book that I just totally found just alien to me is this idea that you believe in 9-11 conspiracies.
[01:02:16.155 --> 01:02:18.979]  Well, let me tell it to you this way.
[01:02:18.979 --> 01:02:23.245]  Why is it that when you ask any question about 9-11 you're immediately attacked?
[01:02:23.305 --> 01:02:24.066]  I'm not attacking you.
[01:02:24.066 --> 01:02:25.747]  You're not, but no, I'm speaking in general.
[01:02:25.747 --> 01:02:30.750]  I'm not saying you guys, but I've watched people get attacked, people have their credibility attacked.
[01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:36.094]  My problem is, I look at it and I go, how can two planes knock down three buildings?
[01:02:36.094 --> 01:02:36.715]  Pretty easy.
[01:02:36.715 --> 01:02:38.236]  It's a big, it's a, those are, it's 757.
[01:02:40.077 --> 01:02:42.499]  But there were three buildings that went down.
[01:02:42.499 --> 01:02:44.922]  Well, there was a lot of fire, and there was a lot of damage.
[01:02:44.922 --> 01:02:47.424]  Well, first of all, jet fuel blew up at the start.
[01:02:47.424 --> 01:02:50.387]  Jet fuel is four-fifths, and I don't want to stay on this.
[01:02:50.387 --> 01:02:51.728]  I'd rather talk other things.
[01:02:51.728 --> 01:02:52.049]  Yeah.
[01:02:52.049 --> 01:02:53.930]  But jet fuel is four-fifths kerosene.
[01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:55.172]  It doesn't burn hot.
[01:02:55.172 --> 01:02:59.536]  So using the analogy that it could melt the metal, then propane burns hotter.
[01:02:59.536 --> 01:03:03.680]  So if you turn on your camp stove for three hours, shouldn't it melt the grates?
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.681]  But it doesn't, does it?
[01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:06.522]  I want to take one issue with... It doesn't.
[01:03:06.522 --> 01:03:09.563]  I want to... And I just question... He's still a Rosie O'Donnell on the air.
[01:03:09.563 --> 01:03:11.084]  And I do... You know, wait a minute.
[01:03:11.084 --> 01:03:12.425]  I do... That's Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:03:12.425 --> 01:03:14.045]  Well, I know a little bit.
[01:03:14.045 --> 01:03:16.667]  How can they fall at the rate of gravity?
[01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:18.027]  They fell at the rate of gravity in powder.
[01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:18.848]  I'm not an engineer.
[01:03:18.848 --> 01:03:19.968]  They blew into powder.
[01:03:19.968 --> 01:03:22.670]  But if it were true, a lot of engineers would have come out before that.
[01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:24.310]  I want to take an issue with one thing.
[01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:27.272]  You actually had a talk show for a small period of time.
[01:03:27.272 --> 01:03:27.912]  They fired you.
[01:03:27.912 --> 01:03:28.112]  No, no, no.
[01:03:28.112 --> 01:03:28.793]  They took me off the air.
[01:03:28.793 --> 01:03:29.653]  They took you off the air.
[01:03:29.653 --> 01:03:31.814]  They paid me for three years and bought my silence.
[01:03:31.914 --> 01:03:42.144]  You said, talking about Fox and CNN and MSNBC, you said, all the stories come from upstairs, even though the host pretend it's them.
[01:03:42.144 --> 01:03:50.452]  You know, people need to understand, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and the rest of them, they're not these individual rogues setting their own agendas.
[01:03:50.452 --> 01:03:52.834]  These guys will deny it and say they have artistic freedom.
[01:03:54.216 --> 01:03:56.278]  Wait a minute.
[01:03:56.278 --> 01:04:04.485]  So in other words, you chose to talk about Anna Nicole Smith for a month and a half?
[01:04:04.485 --> 01:04:06.327]  Let me follow up on this 9-11 thing for a second.
[01:04:06.327 --> 01:04:07.729]  Did the government know ahead of time?
[01:04:07.729 --> 01:04:08.589]  I don't know.
[01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:12.653]  I'm just simply questioning the fact that it doesn't add up to me.
[01:04:12.653 --> 01:04:14.896]  And I do know a little about demolition.
[01:04:14.896 --> 01:04:16.717]  I was a member of the underwater demolition team.
[01:04:17.458 --> 01:04:20.939]  The government somehow knew where they had to tip off, and who do you think knew?
[01:04:20.939 --> 01:04:21.959]  I don't know.
[01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:37.962]  I really don't know, and I can't place blame, but I have a hard problem accepting the fact that never before in history has a steel-structured building fallen to the ground at the rate of gravity, and why would the main core beams not been intact?
[01:04:37.962 --> 01:04:38.983]  How did they go down?
[01:04:38.983 --> 01:04:40.003]  There's a lot to cover here in the book.
[01:04:40.003 --> 01:04:41.263]  We have a little moment left.
[01:04:41.263 --> 01:04:45.124]  Corporate America and religious fanatics have teamed up, and because of that, we're on the brink of faction.
[01:04:51.246 --> 01:04:53.247]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:04:53.247 --> 01:04:56.850]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:59.012]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:04:59.012 --> 01:05:02.394]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:05:02.394 --> 01:05:08.178]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:05:08.178 --> 01:05:12.101]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:17.664]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:20.746]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:05:38.877 --> 01:05:41.740]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:43.803]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:43.803 --> 01:05:45.805]  Burn the info bombs to disk.

[01:05:49.749 --> 01:05:50.510]  PrisonPlanet.tv

[01:06:18.865 --> 01:06:20.026]  And here's the best part.

[01:06:53.106 --> 01:06:59.191]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:06:59.191 --> 01:07:05.136]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[01:07:05.136 --> 01:07:09.299]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[01:07:09.299 --> 01:07:14.183]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:07:14.443 --> 01:07:22.945]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[01:07:50.818 --> 01:07:56.243]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:56.243 --> 01:07:58.525]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:01.135 --> 01:08:06.257]  We are accelerating towards the new fourth hour of the radio show, commercial free for the time being.
[01:08:06.257 --> 01:08:10.279]  Next few weeks we'll be on the GCN radio network on the satellites.
[01:08:10.279 --> 01:08:11.760]  Affiliates are clamoring for it.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:15.101]  We're happy to supply it to you and very thankful that you want to pick it up.
[01:08:15.101 --> 01:08:17.983]  We're also working on getting global shortwave in the fourth hour.
[01:08:17.983 --> 01:08:23.825]  Yesterday I did five and a half hours, but I've got to control myself and not do that too often in the future.
[01:08:23.825 --> 01:08:29.988]  But occasionally I think I will go into super overdrive, super sudden death overtime radio.
[01:08:31.927 --> 01:08:37.189]  Yes, we have had so much happen here.
[01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:42.390]  We have had Willie Nelson go public on this show.
[01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:45.631]  We've had Michael Meacher go public on this show.
[01:08:45.631 --> 01:08:49.632]  We've had Bill Christensen go public on this show.
[01:08:49.632 --> 01:08:53.353]  We've had Charlie Sheen.
[01:08:53.353 --> 01:08:55.854]  Of course, we've had Jesse Ventura.
[01:08:55.854 --> 01:08:57.674]  And it's really been amazing.
[01:08:57.674 --> 01:09:00.275]  In some cases they contact us, in other cases we contact them.
[01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:05.571]  And we've just been the first to have him on over and over and over again.
[01:09:05.571 --> 01:09:14.053]  And it's, I mean, I've got a great producer, Trey Kincaid, and I think you've noticed the guests have gotten even better in the last year.
[01:09:14.053 --> 01:09:19.875]  But we're just upping the game, upping the game, upping the game, but a lot of this just falls right in our lap.
[01:09:19.875 --> 01:09:29.999]  I mean, I'm doing a screening of Endgame, and walks behind the counter, it's Willie Nelson, and he shakes my hand and says, I appreciate the work you're doing, I've been watching you for ten years at least,
[01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:45.391]  I gave him, oh, we'll see this new film, you know, I gave him a couple of the others, and then I gave him a card and said, I'd like to have you on sometime, and the phone rings, and Trey answers it, and it's Willie Nelson, wanting to talk to Alex Jones, wants to come on the show about 9-11.
[01:09:45.391 --> 01:09:50.833]  I mean, it's incredible that this is happening, so we should be really excited about it.
[01:09:50.833 --> 01:09:59.055]  I just can't believe this is all happening on my show, and I'm all for the other organized, you know, PR campaigns that are going on out there.
[01:09:59.969 --> 01:10:11.451]  But so often, it's the unorganized or the, you know, the daring blow that's done in the heat of combat in the Info War that really strikes at the heart of the dragon.
[01:10:11.451 --> 01:10:15.872]  And films are the mode of communication.
[01:10:15.872 --> 01:10:17.772]  People are not readers today.
[01:10:17.772 --> 01:10:19.792]  Now, I've written a book about 9-11 and the police state.
[01:10:19.792 --> 01:10:22.413]  Paul Watson's written a book about government-sponsored terror.
[01:10:22.413 --> 01:10:26.874]  You can watch those and read those books at PrisonPlanet.tv as e-books.
[01:10:26.874 --> 01:10:27.714]  His book's out of print.
[01:10:27.714 --> 01:10:28.714]  Mine's almost out of print.
[01:10:29.761 --> 01:10:33.864]  That I wrote back in 2002, but, uh, so I'm not poo-pooing books.
[01:10:33.864 --> 01:10:37.267]  I'm just saying, film is the new medium.
[01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:38.328]  Film.
[01:10:38.328 --> 01:10:40.910]  I mean, a best-selling book sells 20,000, 30,000 copies.
[01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:45.634]  100,000 copies, you know, max, if it's a political book.
[01:10:45.634 --> 01:10:52.259]  But you can make a film like Loose Change, second edition, that's been seen more than 100 million times, that we can track.
[01:10:52.259 --> 01:10:57.864]  Or you put up a... Endgame, and in six months, it's had more than 20 million views that we know about.
[01:10:58.433 --> 01:11:02.975]  That's 20 million people that have seen Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:11:02.975 --> 01:11:08.057]  So all I'm saying is, articles are great, short articles, pointing people at films.
[01:11:08.057 --> 01:11:10.238]  As long as we're talking about strategia and everything.
[01:11:10.238 --> 01:11:17.041]  It's like I'm the general who has won so many battles, and had so many victories, and been on the front lines so long,
[01:11:17.621 --> 01:11:31.807]  And I never try to sit up here and tell everyone what to do, but then when other people come to me and tell me what I should do, I reserve to say, well, I believe this is the best course in this particular fight.
[01:11:31.807 --> 01:11:33.948]  But hey, what do I know?
[01:11:33.948 --> 01:11:37.949]  Opinions are as plentiful as sparrows in the wood.
[01:11:37.949 --> 01:11:40.531]  That's a nice way of saying it.
[01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:42.291]  So don't listen to me.
[01:11:42.291 --> 01:11:44.272]  Just go with what you believe.
[01:11:44.272 --> 01:11:46.413]  In fact, it's good to hit in every different angle out there.
[01:11:47.387 --> 01:11:49.128]  Okay.
[01:11:49.128 --> 01:12:07.855]  With us until close to the end of this hour are Steve Watson from London, deep in the heart of London, in the heart of Britannia, and his brother, Paul Watson, who is up in Sheffield, and he joins us from the north of England.
[01:12:07.855 --> 01:12:15.098]  Ladies and gentlemen, I do not have words to describe how huge, how serious, how massive, what a big deal this is.
[01:12:16.133 --> 01:12:17.675]  And this story needs to go big.
[01:12:17.675 --> 01:12:19.336]  People need to know about this.
[01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:20.598]  This needs to be reversed.
[01:12:20.598 --> 01:12:26.864]  They're trying to set precedents with Mexican troops during Katrina and Dutch troops in AWACS and F-16s after 9-11 in the U.S.
[01:12:26.864 --> 01:12:26.944]  and
[01:12:30.498 --> 01:12:38.280]  We've had other troops from the Ukraine and other places running around England, pulling people over, pointing guns at them.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.540]  Did become a big controversy in England.
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:42.620]  I've been to urban warfare drills.
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:50.702]  We've gotten footage all over the country where the Marines train with foreign troops and have role players saying, I'm an American, please don't put me in a camp.
[01:12:50.702 --> 01:12:54.403]  And where the foreign troops practice taking Americans to camps.
[01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:56.523]  Then, in about 2002, the U.S.
[01:12:56.523 --> 01:13:00.204]  signed an agreement with Canada and Mexico to jointly police, to quote, fight terror.
[01:13:01.061 --> 01:13:07.303]  Then they get everybody trained with foreign troops, fighting fires and things like that, or running soup lines.
[01:13:07.303 --> 01:13:14.145]  But if you read the documents with NORTHCOM, they want to use foreign mercs, because foreigners will generally shoot at somebody who they don't speak the same language as.
[01:13:14.145 --> 01:13:18.066]  You know, the British brought Hessians in here twice, from 1776 through 1814.
[01:13:22.913 --> 01:13:24.857]  And so this is the norm in war.
[01:13:24.857 --> 01:13:26.861]  The Vatican, of course, had the Swiss.
[01:13:26.861 --> 01:13:31.189]  The Swiss were neutral, but they sold their armies, and they were some of the most feared.
[01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:32.712]  I mean, this just happens over and over again.
[01:13:34.167 --> 01:13:39.452]  We have our own police beating up in New York an unauthorized peaceful Tibetan demonstration in front of the U.N.
[01:13:39.452 --> 01:13:42.734]  with metal batons, blood everywhere, them begging for their lives.
[01:13:42.734 --> 01:13:45.617]  And the news just said, you know, basically this is a good thing.
[01:13:45.617 --> 01:13:46.177]  They deserve it.
[01:13:46.177 --> 01:13:47.498]  It's unauthorized.
[01:13:47.498 --> 01:13:54.604]  Now in France, it's mainstream news reports that they run up, grab Tibetan headbands off the crowd.
[01:13:54.604 --> 01:13:58.788]  No free Tibet signs are allowed in Paris.
[01:13:58.788 --> 01:13:59.669]  And they don't use
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:12.317]  Parisian police, they are there to back up and they stand behind as secret police from China, the secret political commissariat, that's who they officially are.
[01:14:13.653 --> 01:14:16.516]  In sweatsuits, viciously attack people.
[01:14:16.516 --> 01:14:19.979]  Karate chopping, slamming, choking, and they go to jail.
[01:14:19.979 --> 01:14:21.660]  They attack you and then hand you.
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:29.367]  The foreign Chinese communists who take people to their deaths and take their organs and they inject people with chemicals and murder them or paralyze them.
[01:14:29.367 --> 01:14:34.091]  I mean, it's just the Falun Gong's covered it, the Epoch Times, the photos, the admissions.
[01:14:34.631 --> 01:14:38.693]  They publicly execute people at sports stadiums every week for speaking out politically.
[01:14:38.693 --> 01:14:40.614]  They machine-gun teenagers.
[01:14:40.614 --> 01:14:42.775]  I mean, there's photos of it in endgame.
[01:14:42.775 --> 01:14:44.896]  Just little girls' heads blown off.
[01:14:44.896 --> 01:14:46.737]  I mean, with their brains all over the ground.
[01:14:46.737 --> 01:14:49.798]  I mean, this is who is coming!
[01:14:49.798 --> 01:14:52.680]  I'll never forget, four years ago, people were calling.
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:53.900]  They go, tune into News 8 now.
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:55.981]  It's going to re-air, because they air everything every 24 hours.
[01:14:55.981 --> 01:14:58.803]  You know, every hour for 24 hours.
[01:14:58.803 --> 01:15:02.224]  It's a local Time Warner News channel we have.
[01:15:02.224 --> 01:15:03.865]  Only one of five cities in the country that have it.
[01:15:05.279 --> 01:15:16.385]  And it was all about, oh, 20-something Japanese police are going to be able to arrest people in Austin, and 24 Austin police are going to Japan to be able to arrest in Japan, in Tokyo.
[01:15:16.385 --> 01:15:20.947]  And they've had this since the 60s, this exchange program, but now it's going hot.
[01:15:20.947 --> 01:15:24.029]  And this is a major precedent-setting case.
[01:15:24.029 --> 01:15:27.591]  Headline, Chinese paramilitary thugs police London torch rally.
[01:15:27.591 --> 01:15:33.014]  Outrage after British government allowed members of China's internal security force to manhandle protesters.
[01:15:34.182 --> 01:15:36.824]  And they go and single people out.
[01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:37.945]  They do not allow.
[01:15:37.945 --> 01:15:39.927]  This has been put on Chinese TV.
[01:15:39.927 --> 01:15:44.030]  They do not allow signs for Tibet.
[01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:45.251]  This is unprecedented.
[01:15:45.251 --> 01:15:46.773]  This is Europe-wide.
[01:15:46.773 --> 01:15:48.774]  Paul Watson, Steve Watson.
[01:15:48.774 --> 01:15:49.855]  Who wants to go first here?
[01:15:49.855 --> 01:15:51.557]  I appreciate you coming on.
[01:15:51.557 --> 01:15:51.937]  Hello, Alex.
[01:15:51.937 --> 01:15:53.658]  This is Paul.
[01:15:53.658 --> 01:15:54.319]  Paul, Steve.
[01:15:54.319 --> 01:15:55.340]  Hello, Steve.
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:55.880]  Hello, Alex.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:56.421]  How are you doing?
[01:15:56.421 --> 01:15:58.943]  We haven't had you on, my friend, in a while, just as Brits.
[01:15:59.778 --> 01:16:03.839]  You've always been fiercely independent, now domesticated just like us here in the U.S.
[01:16:03.839 --> 01:16:07.020]  What is it like to see this happening?
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:26.607]  Well, my first impression of it when I saw these, um, so-called guardians of the Olympic torch, um, assaulting and manhandling protesters and barking orders at everybody, I mean, it appeared to me just from the video that, you know, they were in charge.
[01:16:26.607 --> 01:16:27.547]  The British police.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:31.122]  We're basically taking orders from them, from what I could see.
[01:16:31.122 --> 01:16:36.345]  And I was thinking, like everybody else, who on earth are these people?
[01:16:36.345 --> 01:16:45.690]  Then it comes out today that they're the creme de la creme of the Chinese paramilitary police.
[01:16:45.690 --> 01:16:57.056]  I told you that story earlier, Alex, that I was in Shanghai last summer and we were walking down the street and then I suddenly saw these guys who were a foot taller than everyone else.
[01:16:57.856 --> 01:17:05.281]  Frog marching down the street, you know, in a military parade, basically, wearing bulky camo gear.
[01:17:05.281 --> 01:17:09.244]  So I'm thinking, you know, this is Shanghai, not Beijing.
[01:17:09.244 --> 01:17:16.629]  It's supposed to be the business capital of China, not the military and government capital, which is what Beijing is.
[01:17:16.629 --> 01:17:23.453]  So I said to my girlfriend, why are the military soldiers frog marching down the street?
[01:17:23.453 --> 01:17:24.814]  And she said, oh, they're not military.
[01:17:24.814 --> 01:17:25.915]  They're just regular police.
[01:17:27.395 --> 01:17:27.615]  I think?
[01:17:47.631 --> 01:17:58.756]  And then in the US, peaceful 50 Tibetans with people speaking English, and the police walk up and say, quote, I'm going to kill you, that's a quote, this is unauthorized, pull out metal batons and begin savaging men and women.
[01:18:15.911 --> 01:18:18.272]  I mean, we have reached pit of hell level!
[01:18:18.272 --> 01:18:28.118]  Do you understand you cowardly, uh, weak people that have, you know, turned into such slime out there listening to support this government?
[01:18:28.118 --> 01:18:29.539]  This is land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:18:29.539 --> 01:18:30.600]  Look at England!
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.361]  It's all turning into sass!
[01:18:32.361 --> 01:18:35.483]  Go ahead.
[01:18:35.483 --> 01:18:37.844]  Steve, what is this like for you?
[01:18:37.844 --> 01:18:40.186]  Well, it's surreal, isn't it?
[01:18:40.186 --> 01:18:41.987]  I mean, if you
[01:18:43.396 --> 01:18:45.758]  Take a look at these men walking around.
[01:18:45.758 --> 01:18:47.239]  Look at how they're dressed.
[01:18:47.239 --> 01:18:57.207]  I mean, they're dressed in, sort of, shiny blue tracksuits with white baseball caps.
[01:18:57.207 --> 01:19:06.154]  I mean, you'd think that they were, you know, part of the official Olympic Committee, but they're not.
[01:19:06.154 --> 01:19:12.579]  They're basically soldiers, Chinese soldiers, walking around on British soil.
[01:19:13.564 --> 01:19:16.165]  You know, manhandling protesters.
[01:19:16.165 --> 01:19:25.010]  And the other thing to be said is... I got an email yesterday from somebody who's at the protest.
[01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:27.951]  Stay there, I want to hear about this breaking news with Steve Wanson.
[01:19:27.951 --> 01:19:29.672]  This is a big deal!
[01:19:32.842 --> 01:19:38.346]  Ladies and gentlemen, you will have Chinese troops in America line you and your family up and gun you down and throw you in pits.
[01:19:38.346 --> 01:19:39.567]  I'm not joking.
[01:19:39.567 --> 01:19:41.088]  How many times have I told you that?
[01:19:41.088 --> 01:19:44.110]  How many times did I tell you Rush Limbaugh would endorse Hillary?
[01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:46.472]  I told you five years ago.
[01:19:46.472 --> 01:19:47.953]  They plan to use him.
[01:19:47.953 --> 01:19:52.056]  In fact, in official US government maps, large areas of the US will be policed by him.
[01:19:52.056 --> 01:19:52.877]  It's a big idea.
[01:19:54.013 --> 01:19:55.774]  A New World Order.
[01:19:55.774 --> 01:20:00.676]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:20:00.676 --> 01:20:03.518]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:03.518 --> 01:20:06.299]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:20:06.299 --> 01:20:09.480]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:16.804]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:19.825 --> 01:20:25.268]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:25.268 --> 01:20:29.149]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:31.711]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:20:31.711 --> 01:20:32.871]  Most people have no idea.
[01:20:32.871 --> 01:20:33.651]  They're not after money.
[01:20:33.651 --> 01:20:34.932]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:34.932 --> 01:20:35.932]  They're after power.
[01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:37.073]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[01:20:37.073 --> 01:20:41.255]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:20:41.815 --> 01:20:42.296]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:20:53.792 --> 01:20:55.933]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[01:20:55.933 --> 01:20:59.656]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[01:20:59.656 --> 01:21:04.979]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[01:21:04.979 --> 01:21:07.481]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[01:21:07.481 --> 01:21:13.805]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[01:21:13.805 --> 01:21:17.447]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[01:21:18.408 --> 01:21:22.629]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:28.470]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:37.192]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.

[01:22:55.544 --> 01:22:59.427]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[01:22:59.427 --> 01:23:09.113]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than if heated, the Champion Juicer is the best way to get your nutrients your body craves.
[01:23:09.113 --> 01:23:13.516]  The Champion Juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.

[01:23:17.338 --> 01:23:27.646]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness, but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable, life-threatening diseases.
[01:23:27.646 --> 01:23:32.750]  Juicing with the Champion Juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:35.452]  Put the Champion Juicer to work for you and your family.

[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:04.421]  You know I love Ellen Elsham.
[01:24:04.421 --> 01:24:06.202]  It reminds me of so much of my dead family.
[01:24:06.202 --> 01:24:06.522]  From
[01:24:33.542 --> 01:24:39.865]  Northeastern Texas, right where East Texas meets Central meets North.
[01:24:39.865 --> 01:24:50.530]  My dad's family's from right in the same area, and it's that same voice, it's that same look in the eyes, just a certain brand of Texan.
[01:24:50.530 --> 01:24:56.292]  Most people I knew that talked like Willie Nelson, acted like him, looked like him, all dead.
[01:25:01.974 --> 01:25:03.035]  What an icon, man.
[01:25:03.035 --> 01:25:09.138]  I hope he doesn't go when he's 84 like, uh, Tarleton Heston.
[01:25:09.138 --> 01:25:10.819]  Oh, man, we got Kevin Booth joining us.
[01:25:10.819 --> 01:25:15.182]  His film aired on Showtime, uh, the big expanded edition with a lot of my footage and stuff is out.
[01:25:15.182 --> 01:25:16.923]  We've got it in stock, just came in.
[01:25:16.923 --> 01:25:18.904]  You can order it at InfoWars.com.
[01:25:18.904 --> 01:25:21.966]  That's coming up in the third hour and fourth hour today.
[01:25:21.966 --> 01:25:24.107]  Um, going back to Steve.
[01:25:24.107 --> 01:25:25.548]  Steve, uh, you're in London.
[01:25:25.548 --> 01:25:26.909]  You had friends that read the protest.
[01:25:26.909 --> 01:25:29.971]  Tell us what they saw, not just what's been on the news.
[01:25:29.971 --> 01:25:31.632]  Yeah, well, I got an email yesterday
[01:25:32.499 --> 01:25:43.108]  Monday from somebody who was at the protest, who basically said to me, he didn't, he's not, he wasn't a protester, he was simply there to document it.
[01:25:43.108 --> 01:25:54.157]  He didn't, doesn't have any, you know, particularly strong leanings towards the Free Tibet Movement, but just wanted to be there to document the experience, really.
[01:25:54.157 --> 01:26:01.183]  And he said that he was just sort of walking around filming, and came across a scene where
[01:26:01.678 --> 01:26:12.602]  A protester had been pinned to the ground by three police, and so he started filming it with his camera, and as he approached it, it was about 30 metres away, and moved closer in.
[01:26:12.602 --> 01:26:24.847]  The police picked up on the fact that he was filming, and basically just forgot about the protesters that they were pinning down, and went after him because he was filming it.
[01:26:24.847 --> 01:26:30.949]  He'd also been filming the Tibetan flags, there's an enormous amount of Tibetan flags there,
[01:26:31.647 --> 01:26:35.390]  And basically they got hold of him.
[01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:37.612]  He didn't resist.
[01:26:37.612 --> 01:26:43.216]  They punched him in the back, shoved him to the ground, and put a knee on his neck.
[01:26:43.216 --> 01:26:46.759]  Now is this the communist Chinese death forces?
[01:26:46.759 --> 01:26:47.379]  And that's what they are.
[01:26:47.379 --> 01:26:49.581]  They go around killing people all day.
[01:26:49.581 --> 01:26:52.363]  In fact, I've talked to a lot of folks in China.
[01:26:53.457 --> 01:26:55.338]  Well, you hear all kinds of horror stories.
[01:26:55.338 --> 01:26:56.998]  I mean, what I've noticed is the media is
[01:27:22.077 --> 01:27:28.769]  Not giving a platform to the real issues that they call them anti-Chinese protesters.
[01:27:29.415 --> 01:27:33.778]  I mean, they're not protesting against Chinese people or the country, it's the government.
[01:27:33.778 --> 01:27:54.413]  Well, are Falun Gong, who live in China, and who are killed for their religious beliefs, who are peaceful and do nothing, I mean, I guess they're anti-Chinese too, and it was just like you're against the government carrying out 9-11, now you're anti-America when they're destroying America, but going back to you, Steve, were these communist Chinese doing this, or their British servants?
[01:27:54.413 --> 01:27:58.736]  These were the British servants, but I mean... And they took his footage!
[01:27:59.693 --> 01:28:00.554]  That's the point.
[01:28:00.554 --> 01:28:06.838]  He was filming the flags and they deleted all the photos and the video that he was taking.
[01:28:06.838 --> 01:28:07.498]  Arts criminals!
[01:28:07.498 --> 01:28:09.039]  Well, look, that's how it starts.
[01:28:09.039 --> 01:28:16.945]  If you're talking to more than three people in London now, or have a video camera, they'll walk up, even when I was being quiet, and they'll say, Give me your ID, sir.
[01:28:16.945 --> 01:28:17.745]  Well, you guys were there.
[01:28:17.745 --> 01:28:19.166]  Turn your camera off.
[01:28:19.166 --> 01:28:20.467]  I'm putting you in a database.
[01:28:20.467 --> 01:28:21.828]  It's only for your safety.
[01:28:21.828 --> 01:28:23.429]  It's all intimidation.
[01:28:23.429 --> 01:28:26.131]  Man, we're in fascism, Steve!
[01:28:26.131 --> 01:28:26.952]  Well, that's right.
[01:28:28.266 --> 01:28:31.948]  This particular person was also asked for ID and didn't have any.
[01:28:31.948 --> 01:28:32.949]  Cops are such criminals.
[01:28:32.949 --> 01:28:35.530]  There isn't a law to carry ID.
[01:28:35.530 --> 01:28:38.052]  So, you know, you don't have to carry it, so he didn't have any.
[01:28:38.052 --> 01:28:46.316]  So, basically, they decided to make him the victim of their... Well, look, he has to sue them.
[01:28:46.316 --> 01:28:47.477]  I know they're being ordered to do it.
[01:28:48.228 --> 01:28:54.872]  But man, and the cops in England now, they would walk up to you and look at you with hate and pleasure as they violated freedom.
[01:28:54.872 --> 01:28:57.433]  Steve, Paul, why do they hate your freedom so much?
[01:28:57.433 --> 01:29:00.315]  I mean, why do they revel in destroying any freedom?
[01:29:01.423 --> 01:29:02.864]  Why do the British police?
[01:29:02.864 --> 01:29:04.485]  Well, that's what they've been trained to do.
[01:29:04.485 --> 01:29:12.629]  I mean, shortly after you were there in 2005, they passed a law that basically outlawed protests in Britain.
[01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:17.972]  You have to get government permission to protest against the government, which is, in effect, an outlaw.
[01:29:17.972 --> 01:29:19.493]  You have to get a permit to do it.
[01:29:20.387 --> 01:29:35.196]  I mean, there's comments on my article on InfoWars about how police would, you know, people would boo the Olympic torture procession and then they'd be assigned an individual police officer just to watch them and make sure they didn't do anything.
[01:29:35.196 --> 01:29:36.176]  That's right!
[01:29:36.176 --> 01:29:37.037]  How dare you boo!
[01:29:37.037 --> 01:29:39.678]  Now look, we're one step away from being sent to gulags.
[01:29:39.678 --> 01:29:41.520]  I'm not joking.
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:42.900]  We're on the march.
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:45.442]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.442 --> 01:29:48.123]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:54.461]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:29:54.461 --> 01:29:59.982]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:29:59.982 --> 01:30:05.683]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:05.683 --> 01:30:07.183]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:07.183 --> 01:30:16.185]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:30:16.505 --> 01:30:18.346]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[01:30:18.346 --> 01:30:22.548]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:30:22.548 --> 01:30:27.570]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[01:30:51.434 --> 01:31:00.362]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:31:00.362 --> 01:31:05.507]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:31:05.507 --> 01:31:16.637]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:31:17.017 --> 01:31:22.801]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:31:22.801 --> 01:31:29.066]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:31:29.066 --> 01:31:30.106]  What about you?

[01:32:00.730 --> 01:32:03.992]  The whole country's on a bus with a crazy driver.
[01:32:03.992 --> 01:32:07.655]  If the passengers can't get hold of the wheel, we're all gonna go over the cliff.
[01:32:07.655 --> 01:32:12.297]  GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties, a movie the government does not want you to see.

[01:32:14.919 --> 01:32:17.861]  Domestic spying, wiretapping, government chipping and more.
[01:32:17.961 --> 01:32:21.084]  The government's gonna know where everybody's ass is every minute of the day and night.

[01:33:12.512 --> 01:33:14.713]  I am a Midwest farmer.
[01:33:14.713 --> 01:33:17.414]  I make a living off the land.
[01:33:17.414 --> 01:33:19.594]  I ride a John Deere tractor.
[01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:21.255]  I'm a liberated man.
[01:33:21.255 --> 01:33:26.817]  But the rain, it hasn't fallen since the middle of July.
[01:33:26.817 --> 01:33:29.718]  And if it don't come soon, my crops will die.
[01:33:29.718 --> 01:33:36.140]  The bankman says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do.
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:39.881]  He tells me that he's coming, but the clouds are coming too.
[01:33:44.115 --> 01:34:00.758]  In front of everyone, the CBC, French TV, Canadian, we've got links to all of it here in the story, are reporting that people try to wear headbands and the Chinese police come out and rip them off of you.
[01:34:00.758 --> 01:34:03.759]  They come up and attack people with Tibetan flags.
[01:34:03.759 --> 01:34:07.440]  British police come up and get in the face of anyone.
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:08.520]  I mean this is just
[01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:10.671]  In your face!
[01:34:10.671 --> 01:34:28.877]  Everything we were taught about the Nazis, everything we were taught about the communists under Lenin and Stalin, and the war stuff under Khrushchev, and communist China today is still doing all the horrors that were carried out in the past by past grand champions of evil.
[01:34:28.877 --> 01:34:32.378]  And they could have had British police thug everybody, but that isn't enough.
[01:34:32.378 --> 01:34:32.818]  They could have had
[01:34:33.402 --> 01:34:34.944]  Paris police do this.
[01:34:34.944 --> 01:34:35.764]  That would be bad enough.
[01:34:35.764 --> 01:34:36.105]  No, no, no.
[01:34:36.105 --> 01:34:38.307]  They've got to have, and I've watched the videos.
[01:34:38.307 --> 01:34:40.148]  It's incredible in the photos.
[01:34:40.148 --> 01:34:43.832]  I mean, they are commanding.
[01:34:43.832 --> 01:34:55.062]  Gentlemen, is this not just us being brought into the modern New World Order system, where foreign paramilitary political officers, political police, sit there and just feed on the public?
[01:34:55.965 --> 01:34:58.346]  Oh yeah, it's globalisation.
[01:34:58.346 --> 01:35:07.149]  I mean, if you're going to have globalisation, you've got to have globalised security and policing operations.
[01:35:07.149 --> 01:35:16.532]  That's what happened in Scotland in 2003, I think it was, where you had the French and Ukrainian soldiers pulling people out of their cars at checkpoints.
[01:35:16.532 --> 01:35:18.473]  They were part of a NATO operation.
[01:35:18.473 --> 01:35:23.935]  So it's all about a globalised security force of having foreign troops in the country.
[01:35:24.694 --> 01:35:33.572]  You know, these paramilitary police that were shoving protesters around in London, it's from the same unit that's
[01:35:34.170 --> 01:35:39.314]  Been shooting people in Lhasa, in different areas in Tibet, and killing people.
[01:35:39.314 --> 01:35:50.623]  And now photos have come out of flatback trucks handing out robes, the reddish brown and orange robes, to the Chinese military.
[01:35:50.623 --> 01:35:58.870]  And it's been confirmed, even the British government's admitted, they're dressing up like monks, and then they can machine gun the peaceful people.
[01:35:58.870 --> 01:36:01.252]  Yeah, we had an article a couple of weeks ago that
[01:36:02.316 --> 01:36:02.477]  Sure.
[01:36:15.982 --> 01:36:20.343]  He's a security official from the same unit that was in London.
[01:36:20.343 --> 01:36:35.368]  So the reports were true that they were instigating some of the... Because, I mean, people were confused saying, why are these Tibetans attacking other Han Chinese ethnic groups and attacking their own businesses, setting fire to places?
[01:36:35.368 --> 01:36:39.950]  A lot of that was obviously copycat, but from the evidence it was started by
[01:36:42.672 --> 01:36:49.579]  That's right, they were doing mass arrests ahead of the Olympics of the entire leadership, or who they believed didn't agree with the government.
[01:36:49.579 --> 01:36:51.581]  Same thing our government's making lists for here.
[01:36:51.581 --> 01:36:55.465]  And so when they do that here, it'll be the same MO.
[01:36:55.465 --> 01:36:58.548]  They will have people dressed up, as I've always said, like militia people.
[01:36:59.348 --> 01:37:09.854]  It'll be school buses, folks, because they had Bin Laden run-offs in Serbia against the Serbs, and then when the Serbs fight back, then they say, oh look, they're attacking innocent people.
[01:37:09.854 --> 01:37:13.175]  Well, it'll be the reverse here, but the similar first step.
[01:37:13.175 --> 01:37:16.497]  You'll have them bombing buildings, killing cops, attacking schools.
[01:37:17.277 --> 01:37:22.399]  Uh, they'll even, quote, kill the terrorists and have maybe even me dressed up, you know, in a uniform.
[01:37:22.399 --> 01:37:24.760]  It'll be me bloody on television.
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:35.883]  Uh, and all they do is grab me at my house the night before, uh, and then they go shoot up a school bus, and then they shoot Alex Jones, and then they drag me out and have me bloody laying on the ground, and that's how they do it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:35.883 --> 01:37:42.546]  And they don't think they don't have special ops ready to machine gun up school buses because they believe M justifies the means.
[01:37:42.546 --> 01:37:43.426]  They're brainwashed,
[01:37:44.523 --> 01:38:00.543]  Uh, mainly Christian Zionists in this country, uh, who believe that it's a holy war against the Muslims, and they have to do this to make Jesus come, and so they gotta kill a few hundred kids in school buses, and I say that because the CIA did it in Italy to blame it on the Communists, and they did it in Kosovo.
[01:38:00.543 --> 01:38:01.564]  It's one of their favorites.
[01:38:01.564 --> 01:38:02.846]  It's their fave, you could say.
[01:38:03.626 --> 01:38:14.573]  And they're kind of asymmetrical, low-intensity combat, to machine gun or blow up a bus, and then they'll go kill somebody and throw them out on the road, or grab a patsy who's mentally ill and put them out.
[01:38:14.573 --> 01:38:29.003]  And when they machine gun a bus full of your kids, and then say it's domestic Al-Qaeda, and people that talk about freedom are now Al-Qaeda, as they're now saying, as they've said all over the news, people that think the government did 9-11, we're really terrorists with Al-Qaeda.
[01:38:29.563 --> 01:38:32.827]  Well, going back to the Chinese paramilitaries, you know today that they're in San Francisco, the same group.
[01:38:50.646 --> 01:38:52.907]  I'm marching downtown San Francisco.
[01:38:52.907 --> 01:38:53.867]  See, we need more articles.
[01:38:53.867 --> 01:38:55.467]  I saw that and I'm so upset I forgot.
[01:38:55.467 --> 01:38:56.248]  That's right.
[01:38:56.248 --> 01:39:00.029]  Foreign Chinese secret police are in San Francisco.
[01:39:00.029 --> 01:39:00.889]  Alert!
[01:39:00.889 --> 01:39:02.290]  In fact, where is the procession?
[01:39:02.290 --> 01:39:03.650]  We've got to get video.
[01:39:03.650 --> 01:39:12.653]  I demand that Info Warriors go mobile and go out there and get us video and see if the San Francisco cops are under global control and see if they... Go ahead, sorry.
[01:39:12.653 --> 01:39:14.253]  Well, I can tell you where the procession is.
[01:39:14.253 --> 01:39:16.074]  I've got it here in front of me.
[01:39:16.074 --> 01:39:19.495]  It's starting this afternoon at 1pm.
[01:39:19.495 --> 01:39:20.275]  It goes from
[01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:32.177]  McCovey Cove, northbound to 3rd Street, and we'll eventually end up in the Justin Herman Plaza for a concluding ceremony.
[01:39:32.177 --> 01:39:37.505]  So any listeners that know that area, if they could get down there and get some footage of that.
[01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:39.071]  That'd be good.
[01:39:39.071 --> 01:39:42.914]  This is the highest priority as we fight the terrorist forces.
[01:39:42.914 --> 01:39:44.356]  This just in, confirmed.
[01:39:44.356 --> 01:39:46.357]  We got it and we're confirming it right now.
[01:39:46.357 --> 01:39:52.423]  Paul Harvey News today reported international troops will protect the Olympic torch today in San Francisco.
[01:39:52.423 --> 01:39:53.844]  That was Harvey's report this morning.
[01:39:53.844 --> 01:39:54.605]  Let's try to pull it.
[01:39:54.605 --> 01:39:55.446]  John, Google that.
[01:39:56.859 --> 01:40:03.444]  Again, international troops, this is a quote, will protect the Olympic torch today, and we have mainstream news, Steve has it.
[01:40:03.444 --> 01:40:14.913]  Steve, give us your sources on the fact that international forces in the U.S., quote, protecting their occultic torch that Hitler modernized, he drew up the rings,
[01:40:15.791 --> 01:40:20.056]  Headline, Chinese paramilitary secret police to protect Nazi ceremony.
[01:40:20.056 --> 01:40:21.838]  You couldn't make it up!
[01:40:21.838 --> 01:40:23.119]  It's insane!
[01:40:23.119 --> 01:40:24.801]  ZX9 emergency!
[01:40:24.801 --> 01:40:26.363]  Red-level emergency!
[01:40:26.363 --> 01:40:36.554]  Our country is being conditioned to foreign troops in mass conditioning exercises, just like they used the Super Bowl to condition you to get rid of posse comitatus, which they now announce they've gotten rid of.
[01:40:36.554 --> 01:40:37.655]  Steve, give us more info.
[01:40:38.871 --> 01:40:42.194]  Well, I've just read it on a sort of local Fox page.
[01:40:42.194 --> 01:40:49.982]  It just says, The Olympic Torch makes its only US appearance today with a ceremonial run through the streets of San Francisco.
[01:40:49.982 --> 01:40:55.147]  It will be protected by a squad of Chinese security officers known as Flame Attendants.
[01:40:56.041 --> 01:40:58.204]  The guards wear bright blue tracksuits.
[01:40:58.204 --> 01:41:03.169]  They've succeeded in keeping human rights protesters from grabbing the torch at other appearances.
[01:41:03.169 --> 01:41:04.791]  Treason!
[01:41:04.791 --> 01:41:06.473]  Treason!
[01:41:06.473 --> 01:41:08.916]  Treason!
[01:41:08.916 --> 01:41:09.877]  I'm sick of it!
[01:41:11.082 --> 01:41:24.185]  Yeah, it was the same guys that were in London, but you know the Australian Prime Minister himself came out today and banned China from deploying its own security during the torch relay in Canberra.
[01:41:24.185 --> 01:41:25.545]  Men, I want reports!
[01:41:25.545 --> 01:41:27.866]  I want total coverage on InfoWars!
[01:41:27.866 --> 01:41:30.026]  I want total coverage on Jones Report!
[01:41:30.026 --> 01:41:32.007]  I want total coverage on Prison Planet!
[01:41:32.007 --> 01:41:33.247]  This is all we're covering!
[01:41:33.627 --> 01:41:44.175]  Now, I've got the American Drug War coming on, and this nexuses in to how they built their police state grid off of fighting the crises they created controlling the narcotics being shipped in.
[01:41:44.175 --> 01:41:45.776]  But I'm not kidding, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:47.438 --> 01:41:58.186]  Large areas of the country, the entire Pacific Coast area, and this is in my films, this is in the official newspaper articles from the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.
[01:41:58.186 --> 01:42:00.388]  Bernadine Smith put them together in huge binders.
[01:42:00.388 --> 01:42:01.589]  I've got one in storage.
[01:42:01.589 --> 01:42:10.355]  It's a huge binder that weighs like 15 pounds, twice the size of a Dallas phone book, just with mainstream news articles from all the major papers admitting it.
[01:42:10.355 --> 01:42:15.539]  It's in the State Department Plan 7277, and it says the entire West Coast
[01:42:16.359 --> 01:42:24.165]  Uh, all the way from Idaho, uh, down to Arizona and Nevada, over to California, back up, uh, to the coast.
[01:42:24.165 --> 01:42:34.952]  That entire, let me see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 state area is to be patrolled by Chinese troops, and notice where they came under international treaty agreements!
[01:42:34.952 --> 01:42:36.473]  It's the West Coast!
[01:42:36.473 --> 01:42:38.414]  Emergency, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:42:38.414 --> 01:42:44.998]  These bastards, these pieces of, oh my, I just can't, you know what, if we don't get mad about this, there's nothing that's gonna make us mad.
[01:42:46.542 --> 01:42:49.003]  Both of you, tell me what you think about this!
[01:42:49.003 --> 01:42:59.148]  Well, I'm not surprised that the Labour Party let them in, whereas Australia is banning them, especially in London, because you know who runs London?
[01:42:59.148 --> 01:43:11.694]  He's known as Red Ken, Ken Livingstone, and it recently came out that he was, or his aides, were a member of a secret Marxist cell that, quote, plotted to turn London into a socialist city-state.
[01:43:12.768 --> 01:43:22.386]  So this is the guy who's running London at the moment, so it's no surprise that the government let them in on, you know, visitor visas when they're actually paramilitary police.
[01:43:25.786 --> 01:43:28.908]  Ladies and gentlemen, I feel like a moment of silence for this country.
[01:43:28.908 --> 01:43:38.113]  Do you understand I have videotaped personally troops training to take your children away from you and put you on your knees and blow your head off?
[01:43:38.113 --> 01:43:40.334]  It's in Police State 2000.
[01:43:40.334 --> 01:43:41.995]  Paul has links to it.
[01:43:41.995 --> 01:43:48.918]  They train to put you on your knees and stick a muzzle to the back of the American people's head!
[01:43:48.918 --> 01:43:53.620]  And they plan to use these evil communist murderers on us!
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:54.601]  I am sick of it!
[01:43:57.307 --> 01:44:06.893]  I'm sorry guys, I'm just so- I wish I was in San Francisco right now because, you know, I'd go down there and videotape it and one of those dirty murdering pieces of trash put their hands on me.
[01:44:06.893 --> 01:44:13.737]  I guarantee you the cops would probably get me down on the ground, take their gun out, and just- no, they'd probably taser me till I died, and the news would say I deserved it!
[01:44:13.737 --> 01:44:14.938]  This country's gone!
[01:44:14.938 --> 01:44:16.239]  It's run by nothing but filth!
[01:44:17.848 --> 01:44:26.575]  Let me tell you, all the cops and all of you that serve, they're going to take your pension funds, you're going to die of Alzheimer's from all the shots they've shot you up with, they hate you, so you go ahead and serve the evil.
[01:44:26.575 --> 01:44:29.378]  YOU GO AHEAD AND SERVE THEM, YOU PIECES OF FILTH!
[01:44:29.378 --> 01:44:31.459]  Look, you guys go ahead and talk, I'm going to take a break.
[01:44:31.459 --> 01:44:35.823]  I'm serious, you've got the next five minutes, just talk about whatever you want.
[01:44:35.823 --> 01:44:44.550]  Well, I mean, we've talked about precedents for, you know, globalization and exchange of policing and troop deployment between countries.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:45:09.227]  They used the 2006 Soccer World Cup in Germany to ship German police over to, and these were uniformed police, to patrol British streets and go and bust British citizens who were potential troublemakers planning on travelling to the Soccer World Cup in Germany.
[01:45:09.227 --> 01:45:13.688]  So you had German police in Britain carrying out operations against British citizens
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:26.787]  And Germany's Interior Minister changed their country's constitution before the World Cup to allow internal troop deployments for quote, security reasons.
[01:45:26.787 --> 01:45:40.275]  So that's another example where they use one of these global sporting events to ram through some of this conditioning to accept foreign troops and changing their own constitution and things like that.
[01:45:40.275 --> 01:45:42.076]  Well, also as well you've got
[01:45:43.303 --> 01:46:08.793]  In four years time you've got the Olympics in London and it's been it's been debated by the government it's come out that the government is is considering having shipping in FBI agents and Israeli police security services to police the Olympics in London because as they say the prime targets are
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:10.000]  U.S.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.243]  and Israeli athletes for any would-be terrorists.
[01:46:14.243 --> 01:46:21.048]  So they're actually considering bringing in Israeli troops to police the streets of London.
[01:46:21.048 --> 01:46:27.352]  And, of course, the excuse for that is the Olympic Games.
[01:46:27.352 --> 01:46:28.373]  So there's another example.
[01:46:29.986 --> 01:46:41.714]  Well, also guys, remember how during the World Cup they'd have British troops and police in Germany, and then in England they'd have the Germans, and then in Italy they'd have Germans.
[01:46:41.714 --> 01:46:43.835]  I mean, this, we're all being trained!
[01:46:43.835 --> 01:46:45.656]  Go ahead.
[01:46:45.656 --> 01:46:48.138]  Well, yeah, that's what I was talking about.
[01:46:48.138 --> 01:46:54.742]  I mean, it's always just a big surveillance and police state showcase.
[01:46:54.742 --> 01:46:55.343]  I mean, it's like the
[01:46:56.115 --> 01:47:01.438]  Going to Superbowl every year, they talk about, you know, they're scanning the crowd to pick out criminals and stuff.
[01:47:01.438 --> 01:47:03.218]  It's just a big showcase.
[01:47:03.218 --> 01:47:07.921]  In Beijing, they're bugging people's hotel rooms and stuff that visit.
[01:47:07.921 --> 01:47:14.104]  You know, they've got surveillance cameras and systems that can record conversations on the street.
[01:47:14.104 --> 01:47:20.767]  So it's always a big beta test for the nice little tracking and control programs that they want to
[01:47:21.924 --> 01:47:22.904]  And you've got the U.S.
[01:47:22.904 --> 01:47:27.045]  State Department earlier this year issued warnings about how anybody traveling to Beijing for the Olympics
[01:47:50.439 --> 01:47:53.543]  Should expect their hotels to be bugged.
[01:47:53.543 --> 01:48:01.433]  Should expect everywhere they go to be tracked by the police, because that's just the way they do it in China.
[01:48:01.433 --> 01:48:06.520]  Which is the way they do it in America as well, but nobody noticed the pot calling the kettle black.
[01:48:09.778 --> 01:48:12.399]  Well, both sides point at each other when they're all under U.N.
[01:48:12.399 --> 01:48:14.420]  agreements running the exact same operation.
[01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:16.820]  It's all international standards.
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:23.663]  China is a darling because they signed the agreements with the eugenicists in 75 to black-op their population.
[01:48:23.663 --> 01:48:26.684]  To poison them, to sterilize them, to kill their babies.
[01:48:26.684 --> 01:48:29.865]  And that's why they are the darling, they are the god force.
[01:48:29.865 --> 01:48:34.626]  They are the imperial army of death that will serve the bankers.
[01:48:34.626 --> 01:48:36.427]  You want to see your new god?
[01:48:36.427 --> 01:48:38.027]  It is a Chinese soldier.
[01:48:38.027 --> 01:48:38.968]  And I'm not kidding.
[01:48:38.968 --> 01:48:39.348]  Go ahead.
[01:48:40.405 --> 01:48:51.614]  And again, these same paramilitary troops have been killing farmers who have uprisings in the rural areas of China when the troops come and force them off their land.
[01:48:51.614 --> 01:48:56.478]  Which is to emphasize the fact that Chinese citizens are the victims of this government.
[01:48:56.478 --> 01:49:01.242]  There's comments on my articles saying, you know, I hate China, I'm never going to visit.
[01:49:01.852 --> 01:49:03.813]  I mean, you've got to separate the two.
[01:49:03.813 --> 01:49:05.153]  This is the government, this is not the people.
[01:49:05.153 --> 01:49:06.414]  The people are the people as well.
[01:49:06.414 --> 01:49:08.555]  Oh, their people absolutely hate it!
[01:49:08.555 --> 01:49:11.796]  The media makes it that issue of all Chinese.
[01:49:11.796 --> 01:49:13.756]  They go, all the Chinese are for this.
[01:49:13.756 --> 01:49:18.698]  And then that makes you hate Chinese when the Chinese hate the tyranny they're under as well.
[01:49:18.698 --> 01:49:25.701]  And our dirty, filthy, wicked government in 1949, now declassified, put that murdering sack of
[01:49:26.221 --> 01:49:29.224]  Crap, excuse me folks, I'm just really angry.
[01:49:29.224 --> 01:49:31.205]  Mao Zedong, and you know why I say that?
[01:49:31.205 --> 01:49:43.676]  He demanded to have sex, this is mainstream admitted, with three women a day, and he demanded that he never wash, and he liked to... I'm not even gonna say it, folks, just these people are pit of hell worms.
[01:49:43.676 --> 01:49:45.397]  What is it you don't understand?
[01:49:45.397 --> 01:49:51.202]  Psychopaths get control of governments, and then they set up a wonderland so they can have their way with us.
[01:49:51.202 --> 01:49:51.703]  Go ahead, men.
[01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:56.782]  And you know what happened in Tibet, how they destroyed Tibet?
[01:49:56.782 --> 01:50:07.890]  I mean, by no means was it a paradise before the Chinese invaded, but when they did invade, since, you know, the 50s, they've killed over a million.
[01:50:07.890 --> 01:50:13.334]  But what they did was encourage Chinese people to emigrate into Tibet.
[01:50:13.334 --> 01:50:19.138]  So now you've got a situation where there's six million Tibetans, but there's 7.5 million ethnic Chinese.
[01:50:19.815 --> 01:50:23.576]  And the consequence was that it completely destroyed the economy.
[01:50:23.576 --> 01:50:31.059]  Inflation went through the roof, and that's how they gained... Which is what the globalists are doing with Mexico and Latin America.
[01:50:31.059 --> 01:50:32.260]  Right.
[01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:32.860]  Stay there, men.

[01:50:40.663 --> 01:50:48.306]  Chinese security in America, Chinese troops in America, ruling the slaves, the pathetic scum that we have become.
[01:50:51.573 --> 01:51:04.718]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.

[01:51:51.499 --> 01:51:57.601]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:51:57.601 --> 01:52:02.923]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:52:02.923 --> 01:52:09.306]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[01:52:09.326 --> 01:52:09.706]  I think so.

[01:53:57.306 --> 01:54:16.696]  I want to be peaceful, but I'm tired of all these dirty bureaucrats and the big banks that control them, and all their taxes to take our money and make us slaves, and all the ways they poison us, and their dirty communist and fascist command-and-control systems, and I want them to know that they're gonna be defeated!
[01:54:16.696 --> 01:54:24.000]  I hate this government, and I hate everybody that runs it, and I hate the communist Chinese, and I hate all the trash!

[01:54:34.067 --> 01:54:36.609]  But I want you to wake up everybody you can!
[01:54:36.609 --> 01:54:39.010]  I know what they're planning!
[01:54:39.010 --> 01:54:41.592]  I've known their plan for a long time!
[01:54:41.592 --> 01:54:43.834]  I've seen right through them from the start!
[01:54:45.875 --> 01:54:52.560]  And everything they do only confirms to me that they're planning to wage war against us!
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:54.281]  Don't forget what you used to be!
[01:54:54.281 --> 01:54:56.403]  We used to be men!
[01:54:56.403 --> 01:54:59.105]  Let's get fired up!
[01:54:59.105 --> 01:55:07.391]  I've told you this many times, but you're not supposed to get mad about stupid football and things that don't matter.
[01:55:07.391 --> 01:55:13.235]  You're supposed to get angry about your country being overrun by a bunch of enemies!
[01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:23.154]  You're supposed to get angry about tyranny, that rage, that power you've got.
[01:55:23.154 --> 01:55:25.715]  Just meant to defend your family.
[01:55:25.715 --> 01:55:29.136]  And let me tell you, this is the enemy!
[01:55:29.136 --> 01:55:30.777]  The enemy runs our government!
[01:55:30.777 --> 01:55:31.497]  The enemy!
[01:55:31.497 --> 01:55:34.859]  They're the enemy!
[01:55:34.859 --> 01:55:36.779]  How dare them!
[01:55:36.779 --> 01:55:37.720]  How dare them!
[01:55:39.133 --> 01:55:46.697]  How dare them say that in FBI manuals that people that talk about the Constitution are terrorists and the Founding Fathers were bad!
[01:55:46.697 --> 01:55:48.358]  You are the terrorist!
[01:55:48.358 --> 01:55:53.420]  You are the enemy!
[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:57.302]  I'm gonna back Kevin Booth up to the bottom in the next hour and we'll have him into the fourth hour.
[01:55:57.302 --> 01:55:59.223]  I'm gonna let these guys on for about five, six more minutes.
[01:55:59.223 --> 01:55:59.883]  I appreciate them.
[01:55:59.883 --> 01:56:00.804]  I'm sorry I've blown up.
[01:56:02.779 --> 01:56:21.056]  I'm going to try to be more intellectual about this, but we're going to take 20 minutes of calls, 30 minutes of calls next hour, both at 1-800-259-9231, but also on my phone number system here where I can air calls, and we'll get that numbered out in a moment, but specifically only on this!
[01:56:21.056 --> 01:56:22.438]  Okay?
[01:56:22.438 --> 01:56:23.619]  Here's AP right now.
[01:56:24.787 --> 01:56:29.789]  Saying members were picked from special police units of the People's Armed Police, China's internal security force.
[01:56:29.789 --> 01:56:32.190]  Those are the torturers, the murderers, the scum.
[01:56:32.190 --> 01:56:40.554]  The requirements for the job to be tall, handsome, mighty, and exceptional physical condition, similar to that of professional athletes, the state-run Chinese news service said.
[01:56:40.554 --> 01:56:49.518]  And this right now, and it shows video of them tackling and choking people, and attacking and arresting Europeans.
[01:56:51.221 --> 01:56:52.602]  Good God!
[01:56:52.602 --> 01:56:54.083]  Good God!
[01:56:54.083 --> 01:56:55.243]  What have we turned into?
[01:56:55.243 --> 01:57:01.527]  They're just showing it to you, seeing what you'll do, testing you right now!
[01:57:01.527 --> 01:57:03.528]  Steve, Paul, are you pissed off?
[01:57:03.528 --> 01:57:04.928]  Are you angry like I am?
[01:57:04.928 --> 01:57:08.490]  And do you agree that this is a test, a conditioning mechanism?
[01:57:08.490 --> 01:57:09.811]  Yeah, I'm outraged.
[01:57:09.811 --> 01:57:19.176]  The thing that worries me about it is that Olympic torch, which, let's face it, has just become a symbol of outright tyranny.
[01:57:19.176 --> 01:57:20.437]  It should be extinguished now.
[01:57:21.351 --> 01:57:24.834]  He's going to go through Tibet on June 19th.
[01:57:24.834 --> 01:57:31.300]  Chinese government's got 250,000 hardcore PLA killers stationed in that area.
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:33.782]  And I mean, people are going to die.
[01:57:33.782 --> 01:57:36.184]  There's going to be massive riots.
[01:57:36.184 --> 01:57:42.309]  So they need to cancel this ridiculous procession now to save any more grief.
[01:57:42.309 --> 01:57:47.333]  They won't cancel it because it's not about the Olympic torch, is it?
[01:57:47.333 --> 01:57:48.975]  The Olympic torch is just a tool.
[01:57:52.682 --> 01:57:56.124]  Well, it's ancient Greek eugenics.
[01:57:56.124 --> 01:58:03.450]  They would have a huge eugenics contest to see who the superman, or who was closer to the gods, who was half-god, like Hercules.
[01:58:03.450 --> 01:58:08.093]  And they would pick their Herculean for the year.
[01:58:08.093 --> 01:58:12.416]  And then Hitler picked up on it and drew the circles and the rings and all the rest of it.
[01:58:12.416 --> 01:58:16.639]  And now we have it, and now we worship it, and it is now a celebration.
[01:58:16.639 --> 01:58:18.020]  The real Olympics is happening now.
[01:58:19.628 --> 01:58:29.514]  It's about the police and the corrupt military and foreign troops dominating Europe, stomping all over the Tibetans, stomping all over San Francisco, punching Americans right in the face.
[01:58:29.514 --> 01:58:36.258]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:41.822 --> 01:58:43.143]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:44.289 --> 01:58:46.050]  A New World Order.
[01:58:46.050 --> 01:58:50.553]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:58:50.553 --> 01:58:53.774]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:53.774 --> 01:58:56.556]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:58:56.556 --> 01:58:59.738]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.738 --> 01:59:07.062]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:10.096 --> 01:59:15.541]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[01:59:21.987 --> 01:59:23.148]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:23.148 --> 01:59:23.949]  They're not after money.
[01:59:23.949 --> 01:59:25.210]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:25.210 --> 01:59:26.211]  They're after power.
[01:59:26.211 --> 01:59:27.352]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:59:36.057 --> 01:59:36.817]  Endgame.
[01:59:36.817 --> 01:59:38.858]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:59:38.858 --> 01:59:44.039]  You have been warned.
[01:59:44.039 --> 01:59:46.420]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:49.201]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:55.589 --> 01:59:57.350]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:58.951]  You want answers?
[01:59:58.951 --> 02:00:00.492]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:00.492 --> 02:00:04.675]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.675 --> 02:00:08.738]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.514 --> 02:00:17.722]  Kevin Booth's gonna be with us for 30 minutes in this hour, and then the full fourth hour with his new film, American Drug War, that Nexus is in.
[02:00:17.722 --> 02:00:19.804]  It was just on Showtime.
[02:00:19.804 --> 02:00:22.287]  It just came out on DVD with three hours of extras.
[02:00:22.287 --> 02:00:24.830]  It's really like five films.
[02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:27.453]  It's $24.95 at Infowars.com.
[02:00:27.453 --> 02:00:28.975]  That's your attack pattern right there.
[02:00:28.975 --> 02:00:29.616]  Get that film.
[02:00:29.616 --> 02:00:30.417]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:00:31.648 --> 02:00:35.611]  In closing, guys, I appreciate you coming on from England and Sheffield.
[02:00:35.611 --> 02:00:48.120]  You've talked to personal friends, not just the newscast, admitting Chinese paramilitary secret police, the folks that execute people, take them to their deaths, for political speech, beating people up in England, on video, on the news, in France.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:50.002]  Now they're in San Francisco marching today.
[02:00:52.196 --> 02:00:59.301]  We have got to get all of our listeners in San Francisco to peacefully go out there and videotape these terrorists.
[02:00:59.301 --> 02:01:02.203]  Steve, and then for two minutes, then Paul for two minutes in closing.
[02:01:04.901 --> 02:01:09.484]  What galls me is the media is framing it all as a sovereignty issue, which it's not.
[02:01:09.484 --> 02:01:17.429]  It's about complete abuse of human rights and killing over a million Tibetans, you know, and turning parts of their country into gulags.
[02:01:17.429 --> 02:01:18.970]  That's what it's about.
[02:01:18.970 --> 02:01:27.816]  But Steve was saying to me earlier that he heard a BBC radio discussion where they were starting to defend the Chinese.
[02:01:27.816 --> 02:01:29.797]  Maybe he can tell you about that.
[02:01:29.797 --> 02:01:30.958]  Well, yeah, basically.
[02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:37.284]  What we were saying before, they weren't separating the Chinese people from the Chinese government.
[02:01:37.284 --> 02:01:44.989]  And the debate this morning, the big debate on the BBC was, is there too much China bashing going on now?
[02:01:44.989 --> 02:01:47.170]  China, you know, it's looking after its people.
[02:01:47.170 --> 02:01:51.193]  Maybe we should stop getting on the back of the Chinese.
[02:01:51.193 --> 02:01:55.695]  But, you know, that's just framing the debate when it's not about us.
[02:01:55.695 --> 02:01:57.417]  Well, just as Hitler used the 36 Olympics
[02:01:58.686 --> 02:02:08.193]  To make, you know, all the systems of Nazi Germany become rockstar popular even in the US and England and worldwide.
[02:02:08.193 --> 02:02:16.439]  I went to the grocery store last night, the Whole Foods, and there were two big magazines separate with big red flags and communist stars on the front.
[02:02:16.439 --> 02:02:17.640]  I was too busy trying to get home.
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:19.181]  I should have bought them and talked about them.
[02:02:19.181 --> 02:02:22.083]  But two magazines saying, get off China's back, China's good.
[02:02:22.083 --> 02:02:25.005]  I mean, this is all about training us that their system's good.
[02:02:26.175 --> 02:02:37.982]  Ernest, I mean it, these Olympic officials look absolutely ridiculous when they say, no, the torch procession's going to continue, we're not going to cancel it because the Olympics is not political.
[02:02:37.982 --> 02:02:40.304]  It's always been political.
[02:02:40.304 --> 02:02:45.007]  It makes them look absolutely ridiculous when they say that.
[02:02:45.007 --> 02:02:53.952]  And then you've got the media asking pointless questions like, are the Olympics being used as a tool just purely to attack China?
[02:02:53.952 --> 02:02:55.073]  Well, yeah, they are because
[02:02:55.583 --> 02:03:05.287]  China's an oppressive, tyrannical regime, and you know, protesters are going to use anything like that to attack it.
[02:03:05.287 --> 02:03:15.831]  Well, I went into histrionics because it, it, it, I am, every time I think I can't be any more freaked out, we knew this was coming, we knew this would happen.
[02:03:15.831 --> 02:03:17.272]  The Olympics are totally wicked.
[02:03:17.272 --> 02:03:18.192]  I'm boycotting them.
[02:03:18.192 --> 02:03:20.033]  I'm not watching any of it.
[02:03:20.033 --> 02:03:21.353]  Everyone else should boycott it.
[02:03:21.353 --> 02:03:22.834]  Watch none of it.
[02:03:22.834 --> 02:03:25.275]  If you see a newscast about it, turn it off.
[02:03:26.681 --> 02:03:28.282]  Uh, buy none of it.
[02:03:28.282 --> 02:03:31.165]  Uh, let the sponsors that are sponsoring it know you're boycotting them.
[02:03:31.165 --> 02:03:32.907]  I'm serious.
[02:03:32.907 --> 02:03:40.213]  Because they're doing all this on purpose, the social engineers, the behavioral psychologists.
[02:03:40.213 --> 02:03:46.178]  There is no doubt, all the continuing coverage will be at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:03:46.178 --> 02:03:50.182]  Guys, I'm just sorry that you have to watch your own Britons being beat up by Chinese secret police.
[02:03:50.182 --> 02:03:51.543]  I mean, these are literal death police.
[02:03:53.231 --> 02:03:56.753]  And I bet money they're going to beat up people in San Francisco.
[02:03:56.753 --> 02:03:58.294]  It's a setup.
[02:03:58.294 --> 02:04:06.500]  They come over to peaceful people, grab their signs, grab their placards, foreign troops violating free speech in England, and I guarantee it's going on in the U.S.
[02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:08.581]  because our cops do it every day.
[02:04:08.581 --> 02:04:12.124]  I mean, did you ever think you'd live to see this, Steve and Paul?
[02:04:12.124 --> 02:04:14.545]  Well, it doesn't surprise me, really.
[02:04:14.545 --> 02:04:21.530]  I just hope that other countries will follow the example of the Australians and, you know, kick these thugs out of the country because they shouldn't be there.
[02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:22.511]  It's completely illegal.
[02:04:23.363 --> 02:04:25.445]  I want the listeners to go completely ape.
[02:04:25.445 --> 02:04:30.628]  The best article that gives people the full spectrum analysis of this long-term plan.
[02:04:30.628 --> 02:04:33.951]  They've got plans for Czechoslovakian troops in the Midwest.
[02:04:33.951 --> 02:04:38.995]  They've got plans for British, Dutch, Israeli on the East Coast.
[02:04:38.995 --> 02:04:42.917]  They plan to use Latin American from Florida to Texas, Mexican troops.
[02:04:42.917 --> 02:04:44.519]  It's all now official!
[02:04:44.519 --> 02:04:46.120]  We will be ruled by foreign mercs!
[02:04:48.311 --> 02:04:50.313]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:04:50.313 --> 02:04:53.917]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:04:53.917 --> 02:04:56.080]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:59.463]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:04:59.463 --> 02:05:05.249]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:05:05.249 --> 02:05:09.174]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:08:57.724 --> 02:08:58.825]  Thanks for the call.
[02:08:58.825 --> 02:08:59.545]  Gotta let you go.
[02:08:59.545 --> 02:09:02.427]  Again, I never do this.
[02:09:02.427 --> 02:09:09.491]  I'm talking about trying... Look, you can call back tomorrow or later in the fourth hour today on any subject you want, okay?
[02:09:09.491 --> 02:09:10.892]  And I'm not being mean, sir.
[02:09:11.906 --> 02:09:13.267]  Police.
[02:09:13.267 --> 02:09:21.674]  Right now in San Francisco, there are Chinese paramilitary secret police, the ones that torture and kill and murder people.
[02:09:21.674 --> 02:09:23.335]  They've beaten up Britons.
[02:09:23.335 --> 02:09:26.197]  They've beaten up French, Parisians.
[02:09:26.197 --> 02:09:33.703]  They are here, I guarantee you, they're slugging and punching and grabbing people's bandanas and pro-Tibet signs.
[02:09:33.703 --> 02:09:35.345]  They are enemies!
[02:09:35.345 --> 02:09:39.428]  Enemy troops are in America, violating our First Amendment.
[02:09:40.686 --> 02:09:42.347]  And they're violating posse comitatus.
[02:09:42.347 --> 02:09:43.907]  They're violating every canon.
[02:09:43.907 --> 02:09:45.508]  Get them out!
[02:09:45.508 --> 02:09:53.610]  Scum with diplomatic immunity are having their way with us right now, and I want them out of here!
[02:09:53.610 --> 02:09:54.571]  Who's up next here?
[02:09:54.571 --> 02:09:55.651]  Nate in New York City.
[02:09:55.651 --> 02:09:56.291]  You're on the air.
[02:09:56.291 --> 02:09:58.312]  Hey, Jones.
[02:09:58.312 --> 02:10:00.893]  Nate Evans in New York with RearChange.
[02:10:00.893 --> 02:10:01.333]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:01.333 --> 02:10:02.893]  Well, hey, good to hear from you, Nate.
[02:10:02.893 --> 02:10:03.474]  Good to hear from you.
[02:10:03.474 --> 02:10:07.675]  I don't know if you knew, but like about two and a half weeks ago, I went down to a Tibet rally.
[02:10:08.567 --> 02:10:13.772]  And I was standing out of the barricades and they didn't like that so they handcuffed me and took me down to the precinct.
[02:10:13.772 --> 02:10:19.238]  I heard you got arrested for videotaping and I'm good friends with Nate and he's working on the new 9-11 film with us.
[02:10:19.238 --> 02:10:24.063]  And Nate does special effects for some of the big TV studios in New York.
[02:10:24.063 --> 02:10:25.544]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:10:25.544 --> 02:10:27.546]  Okay, well I heard you got arrested from the folks at the office.
[02:10:27.546 --> 02:10:29.328]  I heard you got put in handcuffs.
[02:10:29.328 --> 02:10:30.049]  Yeah, I did.
[02:10:30.049 --> 02:10:31.370]  That's an arrest, my friend.
[02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:32.351]  That's an arrest, my friend.
[02:10:33.163 --> 02:10:41.310]  Yeah, it was because I had the cameras, because, um, I first said I didn't want to go in the barricade, and they said it was a problem because I was standing there, and they never answered my question.
[02:10:41.310 --> 02:10:45.253]  I said I could walk around if the problem is me not being in the barricade, because there's no law.
[02:10:45.253 --> 02:10:48.236]  So they put me in cuffs after they find out I have no ID.
[02:10:48.236 --> 02:10:50.157]  Because I don't care about an ID.
[02:10:50.157 --> 02:10:52.279]  In fact, I fly without an ID.
[02:10:52.279 --> 02:10:54.241]  Don't ask how I do it, but I do it.
[02:10:54.241 --> 02:10:59.245]  And, uh, they pretty much said they were going to put me in jail for that, and they were going to be nice to me and let me, just give me a summons.
[02:11:00.658 --> 02:11:02.001]  And then, oh yeah, and the Tibetans.
[02:11:02.001 --> 02:11:03.344]  So you were arrested.
[02:11:04.538 --> 02:11:05.738]  Um, they were going to put me in prison.
[02:11:05.738 --> 02:11:07.679]  They put me in for an hour.
[02:11:07.679 --> 02:11:09.419]  Okay, so you were arrested.
[02:11:09.419 --> 02:11:11.760]  I just want to make sure I was getting things straight there.
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:16.081]  Uh, Nate, now this is a separate Tibetan deal from them with the big metal poles.
[02:11:16.081 --> 02:11:17.562]  The police saying it was unauthorized.
[02:11:17.562 --> 02:11:20.723]  So in America now, oh, you're poor Tibetan's being exterminated.
[02:11:20.723 --> 02:11:22.183]  Oh, you want to stand in front of the UN?
[02:11:22.183 --> 02:11:25.564]  We're going to beat you bloody as you scream and beg peacefully.
[02:11:25.564 --> 02:11:27.765]  I mean, it's all over, folks.
[02:11:27.765 --> 02:11:29.485]  The country is gone.
[02:11:29.485 --> 02:11:32.146]  If we don't recognize how deep it's sunk, we'll never get it back.
[02:11:33.954 --> 02:11:34.595]  Anything else, Nate?
[02:11:34.595 --> 02:11:37.696]  What do you think about the foreign troops?
[02:11:37.696 --> 02:11:41.019]  Uh, well... You know, I'm not surprised anymore.
[02:11:41.019 --> 02:11:44.501]  Everything... Everything that I'm seeing is pretty much what I've already read.
[02:11:44.501 --> 02:11:49.284]  So, uh, I'm gonna be... Actually, I'll be more surprised when things start turning around.
[02:11:49.284 --> 02:11:51.285]  Because people are just so blind.
[02:11:51.285 --> 02:11:55.308]  That... That'll be surprising to me more than being surprised at the stuff happening.
[02:11:55.308 --> 02:11:57.129]  Because I'm sure you kind of agree to that.
[02:11:57.129 --> 02:11:59.731]  When you start seeing changes, that's the surprise for me.
[02:11:59.731 --> 02:12:00.451]  Absolutely, Nate.
[02:12:00.451 --> 02:12:02.032]  Great hearing from you and the great work you do.
[02:12:02.032 --> 02:12:02.713]  Thank you for everything.
[02:12:02.713 --> 02:12:03.333]  Wonderful person.
[02:12:03.615 --> 02:12:05.056]  Gotta meet his brother here in Austin.
[02:12:05.056 --> 02:12:06.037]  His brother lives in Austin.
[02:12:06.037 --> 02:12:09.900]  Meg came down to visit him a few weeks ago, and we got to go out to dinner with him.
[02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:13.243]  Uh, who's up next here?
[02:12:13.243 --> 02:12:14.664]  Michelle in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:12:14.664 --> 02:12:16.406]  Worldwide transmission.
[02:12:16.406 --> 02:12:17.487]  Yes, sir.
[02:12:17.487 --> 02:12:24.373]  Mr. Jones, I am a 51-year-old RN, and I'm a catastrophic nurse case manager, and I have the great honor.
[02:12:24.373 --> 02:12:28.276]  I turned 51 on Sunday, and I found your site on Sunday.
[02:12:28.826 --> 02:12:36.772]  I have listened to streaming and radio to coast-to-coast for 15 years, did not know you, found you through them.
[02:12:36.772 --> 02:12:47.801]  I spent, from that moment, any waking moment, even typing reports, whatever I'm doing, I have watched everything I can find that's in your website.
[02:12:47.801 --> 02:12:53.586]  And I'm calling you to tell you what I see clinically, okay?
[02:12:53.586 --> 02:12:58.410]  And you're saying, get off your ass, do something, don't just sit there and watch this.
[02:12:59.127 --> 02:13:00.428]  And I'm like, what the hell can I do?
[02:13:00.428 --> 02:13:01.468]  You know, you open your mouth.
[02:13:01.468 --> 02:13:04.650]  In my world, I open my mouth up and I am crazy.
[02:13:04.650 --> 02:13:05.411]  Alright?
[02:13:05.411 --> 02:13:06.111]  I can't.
[02:13:06.111 --> 02:13:07.812]  I mean, it just doesn't work.
[02:13:07.812 --> 02:13:10.773]  Yeah, you don't like Chinese troops beating you in the street.
[02:13:10.773 --> 02:13:14.355]  I can hand cards out and say, just go here, go here, because I cannot open my mouth.
[02:13:14.355 --> 02:13:16.176]  No, that's a very effective thing to say.
[02:13:16.176 --> 02:13:17.297]  Hey, here's a film.
[02:13:17.297 --> 02:13:18.058]  What do you think of it?
[02:13:18.058 --> 02:13:19.158]  It's controversial.
[02:13:19.158 --> 02:13:20.099]  They don't even do it.
[02:13:20.099 --> 02:13:22.400]  I had a colonel, a friend of mine.
[02:13:23.010 --> 02:13:29.552]  Watch two seconds of it and call me up and tell me you were an insane person and I'm crazy and he's really worried about my mental health.
[02:13:29.552 --> 02:13:30.512]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:13:30.512 --> 02:13:35.553]  My background is I created a psychiatric institute with my ex-husband.
[02:13:35.553 --> 02:13:37.514]  So I am my core training is psychiatry.
[02:13:37.514 --> 02:13:41.395]  Well, I'd be crazy if I wasn't freaking out!
[02:13:41.395 --> 02:13:42.275]  That's right.
[02:13:42.275 --> 02:13:42.895]  You're right.
[02:13:42.895 --> 02:13:47.816]  But what you're talking about, the basis of what is happening in society, is absolutely correct.
[02:13:47.816 --> 02:13:48.516]  It's psychology 101.
[02:13:48.516 --> 02:13:48.696]  It is.
[02:13:48.696 --> 02:13:49.136]  But I, sir,
[02:13:51.522 --> 02:13:52.883]  You, I, what can I do?
[02:13:52.883 --> 02:13:53.963]  You know, what can I do?
[02:13:53.963 --> 02:13:55.264]  This is, this is what I'm gonna do.
[02:13:55.264 --> 02:14:00.527]  First of all, I thank you because that's the biggest birthday present I have gotten and I don't even know remember.
[02:14:00.527 --> 02:14:02.108]  Biggest present.
[02:14:02.108 --> 02:14:03.969]  To meet you and see this.
[02:14:03.969 --> 02:14:04.670]  Biggest present.
[02:14:04.670 --> 02:14:05.250]  Thank you so much.
[02:14:05.250 --> 02:14:06.811]  Well, you're awesome and I appreciate your call.
[02:14:06.811 --> 02:14:08.792]  Call me back when we have more time someday.
[02:14:08.792 --> 02:14:10.753]  I'm not trying to be mean to the great callers.
[02:14:10.753 --> 02:14:12.034]  Right now, I'm flipping out.
[02:14:12.034 --> 02:14:14.596]  There are Chinese secret death troops.
[02:14:14.596 --> 02:14:16.057]  These are death troops.
[02:14:16.057 --> 02:14:16.637]  That's what they do.
[02:14:17.375 --> 02:14:20.236]  They go take a woman who's had more than one child, and they drown the baby.
[02:14:20.236 --> 02:14:20.977]  That's what they do.
[02:14:20.977 --> 02:14:21.777]  It's admitted.
[02:14:21.777 --> 02:14:25.618]  They go and they take an old man who's fallen gone, and they take his organs.
[02:14:25.618 --> 02:14:26.699]  Or they torture him to death.
[02:14:26.699 --> 02:14:27.559]  They rape women.
[02:14:27.559 --> 02:14:28.680]  They rule.
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:35.142]  They are the blackest, most evil Nazis, commies, whatever you want to call them, you could imagine.
[02:14:35.142 --> 02:14:37.884]  They have more blood than anyone on their hands.
[02:14:37.884 --> 02:14:41.945]  They're the longest standing black sunshine death.
[02:14:41.945 --> 02:14:45.887]  I mean, they are the wickedness of the wickedness, and they are here.
[02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:48.951]  And again, these things start small.
[02:14:48.951 --> 02:14:51.373]  This is a test by the enemy right now.
[02:14:51.373 --> 02:14:57.657]  I see it exactly where it is and my hackles go up like a dog that sees somebody sneaking into the perimeter.
[02:14:57.657 --> 02:15:01.159]  You know, with their back low in a stealth mode with a big pike in their hand.
[02:15:01.159 --> 02:15:03.601]  And I know it's the enemy and I'm going crazy!
[02:15:03.601 --> 02:15:04.842]  I'm barking!
[02:15:04.842 --> 02:15:06.143]  I mean, I'm growling and snapping.
[02:15:06.143 --> 02:15:10.085]  I'm on the chain and I'm just... I was trying to warn people desperately.
[02:15:10.085 --> 02:15:11.006]  I know what they plan.
[02:15:11.006 --> 02:15:13.588]  I've videotaped our own troops trying to kill us!
[02:15:15.347 --> 02:15:16.568]  God Almighty!
[02:15:16.568 --> 02:15:22.831]  The dumb cops serve the system when the system puts poison in their water!
[02:15:22.831 --> 02:15:25.673]  Jay in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[02:15:25.673 --> 02:15:26.633]  Hi, Alex.
[02:15:26.633 --> 02:15:31.195]  I just really want to personally thank you for all the ammunition that you've given me over the years.
[02:15:31.195 --> 02:15:32.536]  I've never called you.
[02:15:32.536 --> 02:15:36.478]  I've been handing out 9-11 DVDs since the one-year anniversary.
[02:15:36.478 --> 02:15:38.019]  I know Linda Honeycutt.
[02:15:38.019 --> 02:15:40.761]  I drove her around for the first month, but nobody funded us.
[02:15:40.761 --> 02:15:43.302]  I had to get in a truck and go driving to support my family.
[02:15:43.911 --> 02:15:49.295]  I just wanted to comment on this part about Sean Hannity saying that Al-Qaeda are all around us.
[02:15:49.295 --> 02:15:55.440]  If our government created Al-Qaeda and the people that attacked us on 9-11 is Al-Qaeda, that is a true statement.
[02:15:55.982 --> 02:15:57.462]  Al-Qaeda is all around us.
[02:15:57.462 --> 02:15:58.603]  They're in Fox News.
[02:15:58.603 --> 02:15:59.523]  They're in CNN.
[02:15:59.523 --> 02:16:02.564]  They're anybody that's ever tried to cover this up.
[02:16:02.564 --> 02:16:03.724]  That's the incredible thing.
[02:16:03.724 --> 02:16:05.905]  They are Al-Qaeda.
[02:16:05.905 --> 02:16:07.745]  They are Al-Cieda.
[02:16:07.745 --> 02:16:09.746]  And they say Al-Qaeda attacked to get your freedom.
[02:16:09.746 --> 02:16:11.706]  It's all a sick lawyer joke.
[02:16:11.706 --> 02:16:13.647]  They love to hide it in plain view.
[02:16:13.647 --> 02:16:14.867]  And it's true.
[02:16:14.867 --> 02:16:18.548]  They are Al-Qaeda and they are attacking and they are all around us.
[02:16:18.548 --> 02:16:21.369]  Yeah, well I've handed out over 7,000 DVDs.
[02:16:21.369 --> 02:16:24.390]  I've got an 8-hour DVD with Freedom to Fascism.
[02:16:25.482 --> 02:16:31.488]  Uh, um, uh, Loose Change, 9-11 Mysteries, 9-11 Eyewitness, Hoboken TV, and Terror Storm.
[02:16:31.488 --> 02:16:33.830]  I've handed out over 7,000 of those DVDs.
[02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:36.252]  I drive around in my truck and I talk to everybody.
[02:16:36.252 --> 02:16:37.053]  They call me crazy.
[02:16:37.053 --> 02:16:39.194]  That's right, and nothing can stop you.
[02:16:39.194 --> 02:16:40.696]  If we all do this, it's over!
[02:16:41.685 --> 02:16:45.206]  Let me just say hi to my friends in this movement, man.
[02:16:45.206 --> 02:16:46.586]  I know you guys miss me.
[02:16:46.586 --> 02:16:47.447]  A lot of people miss me.
[02:17:05.060 --> 02:17:06.601]  I'm going to take a call off my system.
[02:17:06.601 --> 02:17:08.742]  Let's go ahead and talk to Allison in Austin.
[02:17:08.742 --> 02:17:13.604]  Do you care about foreign death troops marching all over the West, beating up whoever they want?
[02:17:13.604 --> 02:17:14.725]  I do, I do.
[02:17:14.725 --> 02:17:20.908]  I've been informed by some troopers that I know that there's over 20,000 Chinese troops
[02:17:22.694 --> 02:17:25.175]  Training off the coast of Baja, California.
[02:17:25.175 --> 02:17:31.978]  Yeah, that's right, and our government gave them former bases all over the Caribbean, and they've moved in a huge troop.
[02:17:31.978 --> 02:17:33.639]  I mean, just tens of thousands of troops.
[02:17:33.639 --> 02:17:35.640]  Our government gave them the Panama Canal.
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:40.122]  They are to rule with an iron rod over the scum of America.
[02:17:40.122 --> 02:17:45.865]  And, you know, my father always tells me, you need to start learning Chinese, because that's what's going to be coming home at night.
[02:17:47.633 --> 02:17:49.154]  That's right, that's part of the larger plan.
[02:17:49.154 --> 02:17:59.276]  There's 40 million, I said 30 in the film, there's 40 million more young Chinese men than women, and they're told, your women are in America, you will rule them.
[02:17:59.276 --> 02:18:02.937]  I'm not kidding, you can't make, and you say, you're being told this by state troopers.
[02:18:02.937 --> 02:18:04.097]  See, they know.
[02:18:04.097 --> 02:18:06.098]  They're let in on this.
[02:18:06.098 --> 02:18:15.180]  And you watch, most of them will go along with it and will serve it, just to be in power, and just like in England, and just like in France, and just like in San Francisco, they will be commanded by them.
[02:18:15.180 --> 02:18:15.500]  Go ahead.
[02:18:16.869 --> 02:18:19.350]  I mean, what, why aren't we doing, what can we do?
[02:18:19.350 --> 02:18:20.791]  Because we're scum!
[02:18:20.791 --> 02:18:21.911]  We're scum!
[02:18:21.911 --> 02:18:23.712]  We killed 50 million babies!
[02:18:23.712 --> 02:18:24.913]  We're scum!
[02:18:24.913 --> 02:18:25.793]  We're filth!
[02:18:25.793 --> 02:18:27.134]  We're trash!
[02:18:27.134 --> 02:18:27.974]  No, that's why!
[02:18:27.974 --> 02:18:33.256]  Only weak scum would let this happen!
[02:18:33.256 --> 02:18:35.177]  Me freaking out is normal!
[02:18:35.177 --> 02:18:36.778]  I can't handle it anymore!
[02:18:36.778 --> 02:18:38.358]  I can't!
[02:18:38.358 --> 02:18:39.879]  I'm pissed off, man!
[02:18:39.879 --> 02:18:41.780]  I'm yelling and screaming so I don't get violent!
[02:18:42.517 --> 02:18:46.319]  They're the ones who put their babies in the street when they're girls and whatnot.
[02:18:46.319 --> 02:18:47.180]  Oh, Jesus.
[02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:48.400]  Oh, Jesus.
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:50.742]  But we're the scum.
[02:18:50.742 --> 02:18:52.223]  I'm confused.
[02:18:52.223 --> 02:18:55.765]  So, so, so you've got family that are state troopers that are telling you this?
[02:18:55.765 --> 02:18:56.365]  Well, no, no, no.
[02:18:56.365 --> 02:18:57.666]  Like a trooper.
[02:18:57.666 --> 02:18:59.147]  Like an army guy.
[02:18:59.147 --> 02:19:00.928]  No, some random guy in a store.
[02:19:00.928 --> 02:19:02.008]  Okay.
[02:19:02.008 --> 02:19:04.650]  But it was in an army surplus store and he just started talking about it.
[02:19:04.650 --> 02:19:06.671]  He's worried.
[02:19:06.671 --> 02:19:07.371]  It's all over.
[02:19:07.371 --> 02:19:08.452]  This is the scum.
[02:19:09.212 --> 02:19:11.213]  How long do you think we have?
[02:19:11.213 --> 02:19:11.654]  Years.
[02:19:11.654 --> 02:19:16.777]  They're just going to slowly keep doing it and keep, oh, the foreign officer's here as a liaison.
[02:19:16.777 --> 02:19:19.279]  Oh, he's helping with the security.
[02:19:19.279 --> 02:19:23.022]  It's just like they have Marines out and call it a drill and suddenly they're pulling real families over.
[02:19:23.022 --> 02:19:29.586]  Or the Ukrainians in Scotland just putting guns to people's heads.
[02:19:29.586 --> 02:19:30.667]  It's in BBC.
[02:19:30.667 --> 02:19:31.968]  We have all the articles.
[02:19:31.968 --> 02:19:36.051]  It's all scientific, behavioral psychology, enemy attack.
[02:19:38.567 --> 02:19:39.308]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:39.308 --> 02:19:40.529]  And somehow I'm immune to it.
[02:19:40.529 --> 02:19:48.617]  It just drives me crazy, though.
[02:19:48.617 --> 02:19:50.038]  It is a big idea.
[02:19:50.038 --> 02:19:52.861]  A new world order.
[02:19:52.861 --> 02:19:57.085]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:19:57.085 --> 02:20:00.588]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:20:00.588 --> 02:20:02.751]  Put their objective being world domination.
[02:20:03.373 --> 02:20:06.539]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:20:06.539 --> 02:20:13.871]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:20:16.909 --> 02:20:22.333]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:20:22.333 --> 02:20:26.215]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:20:26.215 --> 02:20:28.777]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:20:28.777 --> 02:20:29.938]  Most people have no idea.
[02:20:29.938 --> 02:20:30.738]  They're not after money.
[02:20:30.738 --> 02:20:32.019]  They have all the money they need.
[02:20:32.019 --> 02:20:32.800]  They're after power.
[02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:34.141]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:21:13.757 --> 02:21:16.939]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies,

[02:23:53.036 --> 02:23:55.278]  Everything they said they'd do, they're doing.
[02:23:55.278 --> 02:23:58.942]  They made a list, they're checking it twice, they're doing it all incrementally.
[02:23:58.942 --> 02:24:01.904]  You ever notice what we talk about happens?
[02:24:01.904 --> 02:24:03.366]  That's why I'm so angry!

[02:24:17.259 --> 02:24:18.620]  You gotta tell them!
[02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:20.341]  Well, this is the real world!
[02:24:20.341 --> 02:24:27.987]  This new world order's made out of people, out of our blood!
[02:24:27.987 --> 02:24:28.828]  I'm normal.
[02:24:28.828 --> 02:24:33.191]  It's abnormal if you're not flipping out, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:33.191 --> 02:24:34.092]  You've been acclimated.
[02:24:34.798 --> 02:24:35.598]  I know we've got a lot of lines.
[02:24:35.598 --> 02:24:36.899]  We've got Kevin coming up.

[02:24:48.064 --> 02:24:48.605]  Get out there.
[02:24:48.605 --> 02:24:49.085]  Get out there.
[02:24:49.085 --> 02:24:49.865]  Get out there.
[02:24:49.865 --> 02:24:51.086]  In fact, call Steve, guys.
[02:24:51.086 --> 02:24:52.867]  He had a map of exactly where they're at.
[02:24:52.867 --> 02:24:54.828]  I need to put that up on the web, live time.
[02:24:54.828 --> 02:24:57.649]  In San Francisco, the enemy CHICOMS.
[02:24:57.649 --> 02:25:00.390]  Let's go ahead and talk to Linda in Texas.
[02:25:00.390 --> 02:25:01.371]  You're on the air.
[02:25:01.371 --> 02:25:03.852]  Then we'll go to Sam, Paul, Archangel, others.
[02:25:03.852 --> 02:25:04.132]  Go ahead.
[02:25:05.185 --> 02:25:34.707]  Hi Alex, a few years ago our Congress voted whether or not to give China most favored nation trade status and here in Austin we have a large Tibetan community so many of the people marching that day were Tibetans and we were able to beat Congressman Lloyd Doggett in the plaza on his way back from lunch and confront him and we begged and pleaded that he vote against giving China most favored nation trade status.
[02:25:35.410 --> 02:25:56.520]  And the Tibetan people that stood there with a translator beseeching him, and then I yelling at him, failed to convince him the next day, and he voted to give China most favored nation trade status, even though I had reminded him that China had invaded Tibet, had killed millions of Tibetans.
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:58.841]  Let me ask you, what do you think about the foreign troops?
[02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:01.681]  About the foreign troops now?
[02:26:01.681 --> 02:26:10.687]  Are you outraged by having chi-coms that have already beat up Brits and beat up French, now in San Francisco, having their way, commanding the police, ruling?
[02:26:10.687 --> 02:26:19.392]  I'm totally outraged and I want to say to Congress dogget, I told you so, and I agree with you that we should boycott all of these... All of it!
[02:26:19.392 --> 02:26:20.573]  Thank you for the call, gotta go.
[02:26:20.573 --> 02:26:23.455]  Call Congress, call everybody, call the talk shows,
[02:26:24.781 --> 02:26:26.603]  I'm gonna call coast-to-coast AM after the show.
[02:26:26.603 --> 02:26:28.204]  I want to go on their night during their news segment.
[02:26:28.204 --> 02:26:29.445]  I never call them to go on the show.
[02:26:29.445 --> 02:26:30.106]  They always call me.
[02:26:30.106 --> 02:26:33.209]  I'm telling them I need to get on the air and talk about this because they got 16 million listeners.
[02:26:33.209 --> 02:26:36.452]  We got to tell everybody, ladies and gentlemen, this is a BIG DEAL!
[02:26:36.452 --> 02:26:38.974]  In fact, I don't want to wait.
[02:26:38.974 --> 02:26:41.176]  Where's George's number?
[02:26:41.176 --> 02:26:43.579]  I've got to have to call it during the next break.
[02:26:43.579 --> 02:26:44.419]  God, I'm home, man.
[02:26:44.419 --> 02:26:44.960]  I'm mad.
[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:45.621]  I'm so mad.
[02:26:45.621 --> 02:26:47.883]  Archangel in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[02:26:47.883 --> 02:26:48.663]  You're on the air.
[02:26:48.663 --> 02:26:49.084]  How you doing?
[02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:50.750]  I'm not mad.
[02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:51.251]  Me too.
[02:26:51.251 --> 02:26:58.014]  You're not going to like what I have to say, but I'm part of the underground militia up here, and as far as I'm concerned, it's already time to go to war.
[02:26:58.014 --> 02:27:05.457]  So, we here in Pennsylvania, when the first foreign troops come in here for anything, we're actually going to take them out.
[02:27:05.457 --> 02:27:10.219]  So, I know you're dead set against that, but I think the time's long past.
[02:27:10.219 --> 02:27:17.562]  It's time for America, for Americans to stand up and take the country back, and waiting for them to come to disarm us and come to our homes is going to be too late.
[02:27:19.221 --> 02:27:20.743]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[02:27:20.743 --> 02:27:27.069]  You know, we need to continue the video of them beating up Americans, other people, Brits.
[02:27:27.069 --> 02:27:28.811]  That will wake up the population to them.
[02:27:28.811 --> 02:27:30.913]  We need to try to fix it politically.
[02:27:30.913 --> 02:27:35.438]  I think you should submit to Chinese troops and let them take you and your family and let them rape your children and kill you.
[02:27:36.432 --> 02:27:38.213]  Okay, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:27:38.213 --> 02:27:41.736]  No, obviously, ladies and gentlemen, Lessington and Concord's coming.
[02:27:41.736 --> 02:27:42.676]  They want to start the fight.
[02:27:42.676 --> 02:27:43.397]  They're going to push it.
[02:27:43.397 --> 02:27:44.498]  They're not going to stop.
[02:27:44.498 --> 02:27:49.561]  They mean for the first waves of police and military to be chewed up by us, and then they're going to use foreign troops.
[02:27:49.561 --> 02:27:51.582]  Get Shattered Union ready for folks.
[02:27:51.582 --> 02:27:52.183]  Get it queued up.
[02:27:52.183 --> 02:27:54.925]  John's doing a fabulous job.
[02:27:54.925 --> 02:27:57.006]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:27:57.006 --> 02:28:01.449]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sam in Virginia.
[02:28:01.449 --> 02:28:02.150]  Hello, Alex.
[02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.510]  Hello!
[02:28:03.484 --> 02:28:10.868]  Hey, yes, I'm outraged about the truth, too, and I've been glad to join you in the fight.
[02:28:10.868 --> 02:28:20.234]  When our primaries came up, I was out there voting for Ron Paul, passing out his literature about exposing a lot of this stuff.
[02:28:20.234 --> 02:28:29.239]  But the most important thing I've emailed out for people, and all this is spelled out, Stop the North American Union by Danny G. Peterson, PhD.
[02:28:30.977 --> 02:28:38.899]  Well let me be clear, let me be clear.
[02:28:38.899 --> 02:28:42.739]  They've signed deals to use Canadian and Mexican troops against the American people for insurrection.
[02:28:42.739 --> 02:28:45.100]  Bush has gotten rid of Posse Comitatus.
[02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:47.420]  Since the 60s they've been training Chinese troops for this.
[02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:48.820]  I didn't just say this today.
[02:28:48.820 --> 02:28:51.141]  This is meant as a test.
[02:28:51.141 --> 02:28:54.221]  First they put troops in the Super Bowl, then they put them on the streets.
[02:28:54.221 --> 02:28:57.242]  Then they put foreign troops in events, then they put them on the streets.
[02:28:57.242 --> 02:28:58.522]  This is done on purpose.
[02:28:58.522 --> 02:28:58.842]  Go ahead.
[02:29:00.208 --> 02:29:01.669]  Yes, sir.
[02:29:01.669 --> 02:29:14.502]  Anyway, I came to know about Granny Warriors because I put out info wanting to find out about, you know, the 3rd of March in Washington, D.C., April the 15th.
[02:29:14.502 --> 02:29:15.342]  Sure, what about them?
[02:29:15.342 --> 02:29:18.585]  I mean, I got my listeners to send them money for the recount in New Hampshire.
[02:29:18.585 --> 02:29:19.827]  Can I do more?
[02:29:19.827 --> 02:29:20.387]  What can we do?
[02:29:20.387 --> 02:29:25.312]  Well, I wish you could come, but other than that,
[02:29:26.178 --> 02:29:26.278]  Yeah.
[02:29:26.278 --> 02:29:27.818]  I think people are waking up.
[02:29:27.818 --> 02:29:34.821]  Yeah, well I'll let Davey have the show and do the rest of his stuff there, but I hear you, I'm promoting it and that won't be enough for people to understand because I'm bad!
[02:29:34.821 --> 02:29:38.842]  I'm evil!
[02:29:38.842 --> 02:29:40.242]  We're on the march.
[02:29:40.242 --> 02:29:42.783]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:42.783 --> 02:29:45.484]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:48.345 --> 02:29:54.168]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:29:54.168 --> 02:29:59.611]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:29:59.611 --> 02:30:04.974]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:30:04.974 --> 02:30:10.877]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:30:10.877 --> 02:30:15.159]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life,
[02:30:15.359 --> 02:30:17.101]  Most people are overly acidic.
[02:30:17.101 --> 02:30:20.905]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:30:20.905 --> 02:30:25.710]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:30:25.710 --> 02:30:26.771]  Do your part.
[02:30:26.771 --> 02:30:29.394]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[02:30:29.394 --> 02:30:35.520]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[02:30:35.820 --> 02:30:38.586]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.

[02:30:45.059 --> 02:30:47.064]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[02:30:48.092 --> 02:30:51.554]  Yes, there is an In-Dash AM-FM shortwave radio.
[02:30:51.554 --> 02:30:59.919]  For limited time and in limited numbers, the Sony GT-160S AM-FM shortwave radio and CD player is available only at the Power Hour.

[02:31:31.847 --> 02:31:35.009]  These radios are not available anywhere else and for a limited time.
[02:31:35.009 --> 02:31:36.170]  So call now, dial 877-817-9829.

[02:31:47.939 --> 02:31:58.365]  USCivilFlags.org is here to help Americans remember as well as our leaders that every man and woman is sovereign and that we're all endowed by our Creator with life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:31:58.365 --> 02:32:07.110]  The Sovereign Civil Flag is available at USCivilFlags.org and is a symbol of our desire to return America to the dreams that our forefathers envisioned.
[02:32:07.370 --> 02:32:12.916]  Show your support for a return to traditional moral values by flying one of these great flags today!
[02:32:12.916 --> 02:32:17.021]  Standard flags are 3 by 5 feet with miniature flags also available.
[02:32:17.021 --> 02:32:22.227]  USCivilFlags.org also carries a large inventory of Ron Paul related gear including DVDs,
[02:32:22.227 --> 02:32:22.707]  We're good to go.
[02:32:49.710 --> 02:32:53.213]  Following a disputed election and a tie vote, the U.S.
[02:32:53.213 --> 02:32:56.296]  Congress installs the most unpopular president in U.S.
[02:32:56.296 --> 02:33:02.141]  history as David Jefferson Adams becomes the 44th President of the United States.
[02:33:02.141 --> 02:33:09.988]  Shortly after the election, increased unrest, rioting, and a growing number of militias have given rise to ever-increasing domestic terrorism.
[02:33:11.983 --> 02:33:19.690]  In response, the President invokes the Homeland Security Act and declares martial law on the West Coast and other areas of the country.
[02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:29.059]  Though highly contested, a Supreme Court ruling sidesteps the electoral process, disqualifying popular presidential candidates from several states.
[02:33:29.059 --> 02:33:35.986]  Public outrage explodes when a sham election leads to incumbent David Adams accepting a second term in office.
[02:33:38.191 --> 02:33:42.152]  During the 57th Inauguration Day Ceremonies, Washington D.C.
[02:33:42.152 --> 02:33:47.674]  is struck by a low-yield nuclear weapon, killing David Adams and most of the U.S.
[02:33:47.674 --> 02:33:50.155]  Congress.
[02:33:50.155 --> 02:33:52.616]  The destruction of Washington D.C.
[02:33:52.616 --> 02:33:57.218]  effectively breaks the chain of succession, sending the nation into chaos.
[02:33:57.218 --> 02:34:02.500]  In an emergency boat, the European Union deploys peacekeepers in the greater D.C.
[02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:04.921]  area to secure international interest.
[02:34:06.377 --> 02:34:14.605]  With separatist sentiment rising, California's governor declares home rule and secedes from the union.
[02:34:14.605 --> 02:34:23.654]  Texas follows quickly and declares sovereignty, taking neighboring states with them and forming the Republic of Texas.
[02:34:23.654 --> 02:34:29.880]  Now, the once United States of America lie in ruin.
[02:34:31.684 --> 02:34:41.816]  The time for words has passed, and a second American Civil War now erupts as seven factions wage war across the land.
[02:34:41.816 --> 02:34:51.247]  They battle one another to reclaim a nation, to restore peace, to rebuild this shattered union.
[02:35:06.778 --> 02:35:15.161]  Foreign Chinese troops beating up British on national TV, beating up French, grabbing Tibetans, not allowing people to have signs against them.
[02:35:15.161 --> 02:35:20.342]  Now in San Francisco, ruling, commanding the police, having their way with American citizens.
[02:35:20.342 --> 02:35:23.783]  It's not enough to have our own police violating the First Amendment.
[02:35:23.783 --> 02:35:29.605]  They've got to have foreign chi-com secret police murderers doing it.
[02:35:29.605 --> 02:35:31.266]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:35:34.767 --> 02:35:37.668]  We are live!
[02:35:37.668 --> 02:35:42.010]  About 25 minutes left in this third hour of transmission.
[02:35:42.010 --> 02:35:49.654]  But we will be live into a new fourth hour at InfoWars.com and blasting out over the network here.
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:56.604]  Kevin Booth is going to be with us for about five minutes from his award-winning film, video streaming it over the radio show.
[02:35:56.604 --> 02:36:01.027]  When this hour ends, we'll come back for 55 minutes with Kevin playing audio clips from the film.
[02:36:01.027 --> 02:36:04.570]  We're selling it at InfoWars.com and I hope you get it.
[02:36:04.570 --> 02:36:08.833]  Kevin used to live in Austin, good friends of mine, obviously Bill Hicks' producer.
[02:36:09.645 --> 02:36:13.289]  And I made a few films like Martial Law with Kevin, a good friend of mine.
[02:36:13.289 --> 02:36:16.893]  And Kevin has worked four-plus years on American Drug War.
[02:36:16.893 --> 02:36:18.255]  It is a masterpiece.
[02:36:18.255 --> 02:36:23.721]  The DVD has three hours of extra bonus footage on it.
[02:36:23.721 --> 02:36:25.243]  And I'll be showing folks
[02:36:26.047 --> 02:36:31.009]  Screenshots of that with our video cam when the fourth hour, which is also a video cast, starts.
[02:36:31.009 --> 02:36:37.692]  PrisonPlanet.tv subscribers can watch the video cam on me, the document cam, the video clips we're going to play.
[02:36:37.692 --> 02:36:44.235]  But for everybody else, you get the audio for free at InfoWars.com or obviously off your stations that pick it up.
[02:36:44.235 --> 02:36:47.977]  Kevin Booth, thank you for coming on 30 minutes late.
[02:36:47.977 --> 02:36:51.478]  Your issue is so important, but we've got an hour and a half still.
[02:36:51.478 --> 02:36:52.519]  I knew you'd be okay with it.
[02:36:56.533 --> 02:36:59.954]  Troops beating up British and French, now they're here in America.
[02:36:59.954 --> 02:37:01.394]  Have you heard about this?
[02:37:01.394 --> 02:37:02.774]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[02:37:02.774 --> 02:37:07.015]  I even have a cousin that was just over in Tibet recently protesting.
[02:37:07.015 --> 02:37:08.796]  So, definitely well aware of it.
[02:37:08.796 --> 02:37:25.179]  You know, I think one of the things that's important to talk about, you know, to kind of transition into this segment, is how the drug war, and not even so much about preparing the American people for the war on terror, but preparing our military and our police forces
[02:37:26.119 --> 02:37:30.282]  And for the last 30 years, they've all been fed this, like, drugs are bad, drugs are bad.
[02:37:30.282 --> 02:37:31.083]  Well, let's just stop.
[02:37:31.083 --> 02:37:35.206]  Let's just stop and first talk about your film, how big it is, how many awards it got.
[02:37:35.206 --> 02:37:37.327]  I want people to know this is a major film.
[02:37:37.327 --> 02:37:40.369]  It aired on Showtime, critically acclaimed.
[02:37:40.369 --> 02:37:40.629]  Right.
[02:37:40.629 --> 02:37:45.453]  It's going to be playing on and off the first month on Showtime in the month of March.
[02:37:45.453 --> 02:37:48.035]  I believe they played it like 50 times.
[02:37:48.035 --> 02:37:50.216]  And it was crazy.
[02:37:50.216 --> 02:37:53.619]  Like, every time I turned on the TV, it was playing on some other Showtime channel.
[02:37:54.537 --> 02:37:56.679]  Pretty sure a lot of people saw it.
[02:37:56.679 --> 02:38:00.542]  Oh yeah, I was at the gym and I heard people talking about it last week.
[02:38:00.542 --> 02:38:05.166]  Yeah, and it'll be playing on and off for two years, actually, through Showtime.
[02:38:05.166 --> 02:38:09.089]  Man, you're having a big effect, Kev, when I'm at the gym and hearing people talk about it.
[02:38:09.089 --> 02:38:09.670]  Oh yeah, I know.
[02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:17.756]  So far, everybody that's in it has, you know, been bombarded by phone calls and emails, one of which is a little upsetting.
[02:38:17.756 --> 02:38:19.638]  I don't know if you know this, but Pelican Studio
[02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:23.391]  Yeah, I've been trying to get a hold of him.
[02:38:23.391 --> 02:38:26.052]  They didn't like him being in the film and exposing government drug dealing.
[02:38:26.052 --> 02:38:31.475]  Yeah, when they were handcuffing him, they said bye on TV last night.
[02:38:31.475 --> 02:38:36.417]  Let's be clear, uh, uh... Army sniper...
[02:38:37.276 --> 02:38:45.340]  Police officer, border patrol agent, head DEA agent in Latin America, exposed, Alopongo drug dealing, put it in your film, and they went and arrested him right after it aired.
[02:38:45.340 --> 02:38:48.062]  They said, hey punk, that's your free country, go ahead.
[02:38:48.062 --> 02:38:54.305]  Yeah, but now they made it for some little gun charge, but now he's facing five years in federal prison.
[02:38:54.305 --> 02:38:56.046]  Hey, can you try to get him on in the next few days?
[02:38:56.046 --> 02:38:58.847]  I keep calling his cell phone, and I can't ever get a hold of him.
[02:38:58.847 --> 02:38:59.267]  Where is he?
[02:38:59.267 --> 02:39:04.530]  He's around, you know, he occasionally answers my phone calls.
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:09.561]  Yeah, we've been trying and I pretty much brought Selly to the audience here.
[02:39:09.561 --> 02:39:12.182]  Years ago, like 10 years ago, we need to get a hold of Selly.
[02:39:12.182 --> 02:39:13.863]  I had my producer set him up.
[02:39:13.863 --> 02:39:26.347]  Yeah, he called me last night because Bill Maher, Esai Morales, a famous actor, mentioned American Drug War on the Bill Maher Show Friday night.
[02:39:27.466 --> 02:39:30.427]  And of course, Bill Maher shot it down as conspiracy theory.
[02:39:30.427 --> 02:39:32.187]  Yeah, I met Morales when I was out in L.A.
[02:39:32.187 --> 02:39:34.008]  He's on board.
[02:39:34.008 --> 02:39:47.812]  Yeah, I'd like to get him a DVD, but then Bill O'Reilly picked up on the story and called Morales the pinhead of the day, or whatever, and played the clip of Morales talking about American drug war, and that was just two nights ago.
[02:39:48.669 --> 02:39:50.590]  So, Selly, tell me about that.
[02:39:50.590 --> 02:39:51.850]  Poor Selly.
[02:39:51.850 --> 02:39:53.151]  So much is going on.
[02:39:53.151 --> 02:40:03.295]  How obvious is it that weeks after it starts airing every day, they come and raid him, claiming he had a clip that was too big or something when he's been in the military, police, everything.
[02:40:03.295 --> 02:40:05.376]  Yeah.
[02:40:05.376 --> 02:40:07.296]  It's just a country of evil, man.
[02:40:07.296 --> 02:40:08.217]  It's all over.
[02:40:08.217 --> 02:40:10.137]  Yeah, and the drug war.
[02:40:10.137 --> 02:40:13.919]  What's important with how we've got to this day is that the drug war has
[02:40:14.662 --> 02:40:42.508]  really dumbed down our police and our military, not that they're dumb people, they're smart people, they're just trying to do the right thing, but the people higher up in the government have been very brilliant on desensitizing everybody with the concept of drugs being evil, you know, for 30 plus years, especially starting with Nixon, and now that they've kind of just flipped the game on everybody and said, oh, now it's terror, and they've replaced drugs with terror, and it's really
[02:40:43.174 --> 02:40:50.040]  The same exact agenda, but now everybody's just... And the real terror is the guys in armored vehicles with black masks running checkpoints.
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:54.624]  Right, and the drug war really, you know, starts back to what's the first thing that they need to do?
[02:40:54.624 --> 02:41:04.513]  Well, the government needs to basically tell everybody that this herb that's grown naturally here for thousands of years, the herb that had been used medicinally
[02:41:05.239 --> 02:41:07.640]  You know, without causing cancer for thousands of years.
[02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:12.541]  They're bad for you, but you've got to buy things that are only made in laboratories.
[02:41:12.541 --> 02:41:13.602]  And let's go through that first.
[02:41:13.602 --> 02:41:14.622]  You go through the numbers.
[02:41:14.622 --> 02:41:17.683]  The hundreds of thousands that die from prescription drugs.
[02:41:17.683 --> 02:41:19.283]  No one dies from pot.
[02:41:19.283 --> 02:41:21.624]  Hundreds of thousands die from alcohol.
[02:41:21.624 --> 02:41:24.765]  And then you get into all of it, and then you've got three hours of extras.
[02:41:25.525 --> 02:41:29.309]  And, you know, let's go ahead now and just play a clip here.
[02:41:29.309 --> 02:41:38.517]  This is General Barry McCaffrey years ago where I confronted him in Austin when his head guy got caught
[02:41:40.354 --> 02:41:43.415]  Uh, engaging in all of these different activities.
[02:41:43.415 --> 02:41:46.297]  In fact, John, do you have that, uh, General McCaffrey clip?
[02:41:46.297 --> 02:41:46.937]  I forgot.
[02:41:46.937 --> 02:41:48.078]  Okay, let's go ahead and roll.
[02:41:48.078 --> 02:41:59.943]  This is where I'm confronting, uh, General Barry McCaffrey, uh, in Austin, Texas, when his head commander was caught shipping in masses of heroin and cocaine from Reuters, and he used a psych warfare op, and starts talking about babies.
[02:41:59.943 --> 02:42:00.603]  The baby.
[02:42:00.603 --> 02:42:01.643]  The baby.
[02:42:01.643 --> 02:42:03.184]  I mean, very skilled.
[02:42:03.184 --> 02:42:06.746]  They all go for baseline instinct buttons they push.
[02:42:06.746 --> 02:42:07.046]  Here it is.
[02:42:08.155 --> 02:42:12.218]  In 1999, I confronted Bill Clinton's drug czar.
[02:42:12.218 --> 02:42:20.823]  Bill Clinton had told the American people that he was going to cut back on the size of the drug war and was going to stop putting non-violent offenders behind bars.
[02:42:20.823 --> 02:42:22.764]  He did the exact opposite.
[02:42:22.764 --> 02:42:33.831]  He hired McCaffrey, who went out there and began brutally attacking the American people and federally funding SWAT teams to kick down thousands of doors a month in search of narcotics.
[02:42:34.881 --> 02:42:46.011]  McCaffrey wasn't pleased that his head of anti-narcotics operations for all of Latin America got caught shipping in heroin and cocaine to New York.
[02:42:46.011 --> 02:42:49.013]  When I confronted him, he tried to brush it off.
[02:42:49.013 --> 02:42:53.717]  General McCaffrey, Alex Jones from KJFK Radio in Austin, Texas.
[02:42:53.717 --> 02:42:58.662]  I fully agree with you on the scourge of narcotics and their destructive consequences on the human brain.
[02:42:59.799 --> 02:43:09.906]  But something I find interesting is the massive evidence coming out in the past of our own government and other international organizations involvement in drug smuggling.
[02:43:11.067 --> 02:43:14.568]  Two days ago, you called Columbia an emergency situation.
[02:43:14.568 --> 02:43:16.629]  You're calling for a billion dollars and more funding.
[02:43:16.629 --> 02:43:20.771]  Well, you're head of counter-narcotics and drug operations in Columbia.
[02:43:20.771 --> 02:43:24.432]  His wife was just caught shipping in masses of cocaine into the United States.
[02:43:24.432 --> 02:43:25.773]  This is from the Washington Post, sir.
[02:43:25.773 --> 02:43:28.594]  I also have Reuters right here on it.
[02:43:28.594 --> 02:43:29.715]  Yes, that's my question.
[02:43:29.715 --> 02:43:33.996]  I just wanted to state my facts because, you know, we're in this world where you ask a serious question, you're a kook.
[02:43:33.996 --> 02:43:35.537]  Let's talk about the drug running of this government.
[02:43:40.329 --> 02:43:47.471]  Okay, I can't hear any more of this.
[02:43:47.471 --> 02:43:47.971]  Go ahead.
[02:44:11.874 --> 02:44:14.155]  Your comments, Kevin.
[02:44:14.155 --> 02:44:16.375]  Oh, you know, it's just so classic.
[02:44:16.375 --> 02:44:33.701]  You know, we had to skip over this thing, but yeah, they're just such pros, like, flipping it as if, as if, like, this one child that had been addicted to heroin and had to have his arm cut off, well, that somehow justifies what they did for some weird reason.
[02:44:33.701 --> 02:44:35.881]  You know, you're supposed to forget about the question.
[02:44:35.881 --> 02:44:39.362]  I mean, you know, they're pros.
[02:44:39.362 --> 02:44:41.443]  I mean, one of my favorite quotes in the film is this,
[02:44:42.150 --> 02:44:53.458]  This woman, Calvina Faye, who's with the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, and she's, you know, one of the, you know, mad mother types and all that, and she's like really outspoken pro-drug war.
[02:44:53.458 --> 02:45:02.765]  And, you know, her whole thing when they're talking about the legalization of medical marijuana, she's like going, you know, she's like going, of course it works!
[02:45:02.765 --> 02:45:06.467]  You know, of course, that's what medicines do, but does it do anything for you in the end?
[02:45:06.467 --> 02:45:08.449]  It's like this, it's just like this logic
[02:45:09.477 --> 02:45:18.366]  And it's okay to be on a bunch of Prozac and go to a psychotic break and shoot a bunch of people, or the 300 plus thousand dime of drug interactions every year, but marijuana with nothing?
[02:45:18.366 --> 02:45:19.627]  We gotta get it!
[02:45:19.627 --> 02:45:25.814]  Well, and not only that, but their logic is, is like, well, you let people have medical marijuana, they're just gonna get high off of it.
[02:45:25.814 --> 02:45:26.935]  Well, I've got news for you.
[02:45:26.935 --> 02:45:30.639]  I can walk into a pharmacy and get high off of everything that they sell there.
[02:45:31.502 --> 02:45:32.063]  You know?
[02:45:32.063 --> 02:45:33.884]  I mean, it all gets you high.
[02:45:33.884 --> 02:45:40.030]  Well, the point is, you talk about in the film, and it is very well done, very poignant, how alcohol killed basically both your parents.
[02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:41.030]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:57.485]  No, I mean, it's just outrageous to me that here in California, I can walk into the Ralph's grocery store with a shopping cart, I can fill it with Jack Daniels and tequila and Marlboro cigarettes and a big giant prescription of Prozac, and I can walk out and I can have enough
[02:45:58.138 --> 02:46:02.059]  Drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes could probably kill a hundred people.
[02:46:02.059 --> 02:46:04.259]  That's legal.
[02:46:04.259 --> 02:46:09.901]  But a friend of mine gets arrested for growing a couple of marijuana plants, goes to a prison work camp.
[02:46:09.901 --> 02:46:10.941]  Well, that's what it's all about.
[02:46:10.941 --> 02:46:18.943]  And then the big drug cartels, just like Tony Montana says in Scarface, and they did years of research to make that film, you know, that's where he says it's the banks.
[02:46:18.943 --> 02:46:19.463]  They're the ones.
[02:46:19.463 --> 02:46:21.143]  They've been running it a thousand years.
[02:46:21.143 --> 02:46:22.864]  They'll be running it a thousand years from now.
[02:46:22.864 --> 02:46:24.464]  He's got to go launder his money with them.
[02:46:25.598 --> 02:46:27.039]  And that's the small time.
[02:46:27.039 --> 02:46:32.161]  Most of the drugs are directly brought in by the government, and then they own the private prisons.
[02:46:32.161 --> 02:46:33.321]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[02:46:33.321 --> 02:46:33.861]  Absolutely.
[02:46:33.861 --> 02:46:37.843]  Now, you got Tommy Chong in the film talking about how he smoked pot with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:46:37.843 --> 02:46:39.183]  You got everything in this movie, man.
[02:46:39.183 --> 02:46:40.744]  This is quite a film, Kevin.
[02:46:40.744 --> 02:46:41.164]  Thank you.
[02:46:41.164 --> 02:46:42.225]  Appreciate it.
[02:46:42.225 --> 02:46:45.906]  You have done well.
[02:46:45.906 --> 02:46:48.307]  But for a green card, I'm gonna carve him up real nice.
[02:46:49.300 --> 02:46:50.561]  Yeah, he gave me a green card.
[02:46:50.561 --> 02:46:52.422]  I'm calling him up real nice.
[02:46:52.422 --> 02:46:53.142]  Hey, fly!
[02:46:53.142 --> 02:46:53.762]  Look at Pelican!
[02:46:53.762 --> 02:46:55.183]  Fly, Pelican!
[02:46:55.183 --> 02:47:02.627]  You know, I don't know if you saw that 60 Minutes piece a while back, where they were talking about this Bayer drug.
[02:47:02.627 --> 02:47:06.148]  I'm not going to pronounce it right, but Tyrodol or Teradol or something like that.
[02:47:06.148 --> 02:47:06.689]  Oh, yeah.
[02:47:06.689 --> 02:47:08.649]  This drug that they give people during heart surgery.
[02:47:08.649 --> 02:47:11.911]  It's proven to kill thousands of people a month.
[02:47:12.688 --> 02:47:16.230]  And they've known it, and the FDA has known it, and Bayer has known it.
[02:47:16.230 --> 02:47:18.691]  Well, look, Bayer is the eugenics front.
[02:47:18.691 --> 02:47:30.136]  Millions, hundreds of thousands of Americans alone died when they knew for a decade that every shot of Factor VIII had AIDS in it and hepatitis, and their internal memos came out where they just said, sell it all and keep letting AIDS be in it.
[02:47:30.136 --> 02:47:40.041]  So, you know, I mean, but like you were talking earlier, I mean, this is, you know, I think one of, like, the bigger jobs right now is we've got to wake up the police.
[02:47:40.041 --> 02:47:41.662]  You know, we've got to wake up, you know,
[02:47:42.392 --> 02:47:50.377]  It's one thing, you know, preaching to the choir, but the next level is to start, you know, getting people who are in charge one by one.
[02:47:50.377 --> 02:48:02.724]  And that's what's so interesting about drugs or the topic of marijuana, especially, is because when you get a policeman alone and you talk to him about marijuana, they're always going to go like, I know it's not that bad.
[02:48:02.724 --> 02:48:03.464]  You know what I mean?
[02:48:03.464 --> 02:48:06.026]  Just like, well, just between me and you, I know it's not that bad.
[02:48:06.658 --> 02:48:10.160]  And then you put them all back in their pack and they're like, you know, arrest them, get them.
[02:48:10.160 --> 02:48:15.044]  Well, the cops I've known are pot smoking, beer drinking, party animals.
[02:48:15.044 --> 02:48:15.884]  Of course they are.
[02:48:15.884 --> 02:48:22.248]  I mean, look at your average DEA agent, you know, is like a classic thug.
[02:48:22.248 --> 02:48:22.829]  You know?
[02:48:22.829 --> 02:48:23.409]  God love them.
[02:48:26.069 --> 02:48:27.110]  It's all over.
[02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:28.811]  Look, they did this scientifically.
[02:48:28.811 --> 02:48:30.531]  They built the police state.
[02:48:30.531 --> 02:48:36.094]  They even passed laws at the state level, lobbied by the feds, where states can't give the forfeiture money to the cops.
[02:48:36.094 --> 02:48:40.416]  But then if they give it to the feds, they get 85% back, which made them federal minions.
[02:48:41.716 --> 02:48:46.021]  And I mean, I've pulled up to a checkpoint where they're pulling everybody out of their car and they go, we want to search for drugs.
[02:48:46.021 --> 02:48:46.942]  I start laughing at them.
[02:48:46.942 --> 02:48:49.405]  I'm like, I don't use the crap you ship in!
[02:48:49.405 --> 02:48:50.446]  Leave me alone, man!
[02:48:50.446 --> 02:48:51.487]  Yeah.
[02:48:51.487 --> 02:48:53.029]  I'm just, I'm just tired of it!
[02:48:53.029 --> 02:48:54.450]  And talking about the Chinese, thank you.
[02:48:54.450 --> 02:49:00.477]  I'm sure you probably have spoken about this, but the fact that the Forest Service is buying Chinese drones
[02:49:02.075 --> 02:49:06.858]  Um, they're going to be, you know, I guess flying around probably searching for pot growth.
[02:49:06.858 --> 02:49:08.699]  Oh no, no, no, that was in the news a couple weeks ago.
[02:49:08.699 --> 02:49:15.443]  They said all over the country, Forest Service, cities, pilotless drones, 24-7, flying around looking for pot.
[02:49:15.443 --> 02:49:16.464]  And remember the case in Austin?
[02:49:16.464 --> 02:49:17.805]  I should have given this to you for the film.
[02:49:17.805 --> 02:49:21.327]  The lady who had the bloodweed that's in every yard in Texas in the summer?
[02:49:21.327 --> 02:49:21.567]  Yeah.
[02:49:21.567 --> 02:49:27.951]  And they SWAT teamed her and then kicked the dog and attacked her and then they, she had a renter in a house behind her and they took out a playboy and made fun of him.
[02:49:28.647 --> 02:49:30.268]  It's so crazy.
[02:49:30.268 --> 02:49:33.351]  I happen to forget that there's a plant that grows that looks just like pot.
[02:49:33.351 --> 02:49:35.152]  I mean, I've seen it ever since I was a little kid.
[02:49:35.152 --> 02:49:36.233]  See, they love the blood.
[02:49:36.233 --> 02:49:37.174]  They love the bloodweed.
[02:49:37.174 --> 02:49:38.955]  That's their excuse to go on the property.
[02:49:38.955 --> 02:49:39.976]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[02:49:39.976 --> 02:49:41.858]  That's a good point.
[02:49:41.858 --> 02:49:45.661]  But, you know, this drone thing here in Southern California, just the other day, it's crazy.
[02:49:45.661 --> 02:49:51.786]  I mean, we get buzzed by helicopters here all the time, and you'll, you know, always just be standing around.
[02:49:51.786 --> 02:49:53.307]  You'll see a helicopter
[02:49:53.823 --> 02:49:56.965]  Meanwhile, my house gets broken into, my car gets stolen, and the Austin cops won't even come out.
[02:49:56.965 --> 02:49:57.225]  Yep.
[02:49:57.225 --> 02:49:57.965]  Yep, that's classic.
[02:49:57.965 --> 02:49:58.486]  That's classic.
[02:49:58.486 --> 02:49:58.786]  Have you seen...
[02:50:19.505 --> 02:50:23.368]  He seemed like what Bill O'Reilly was like saying about to Snoop Dogg on his show.
[02:50:23.368 --> 02:50:32.394]  I've been watching some more Bill O'Reilly clips on YouTube, but he was just basically Bill O'Reilly's on there telling everybody that they belong in prison and that they need to build more prisons.
[02:50:32.394 --> 02:50:34.495]  We got more people in prison than any other country.
[02:50:34.495 --> 02:50:34.935]  Yeah.
[02:50:34.935 --> 02:50:37.557]  Land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[02:50:37.557 --> 02:50:38.878]  We want scum, we got it.
[02:50:38.878 --> 02:50:41.139]  And I'm sorry folks, we have to admit what we've turned into.
[02:50:41.139 --> 02:50:43.261]  We'll be right back here on the Scum Channel.
[02:50:48.979 --> 02:50:50.400]  It is a big idea.
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:53.222]  A New World Order.
[02:50:53.222 --> 02:50:58.104]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:58.104 --> 02:51:00.946]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:00.946 --> 02:51:03.728]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:51:03.728 --> 02:51:06.910]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:06.910 --> 02:51:14.214]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:17.250 --> 02:51:22.691]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:22.691 --> 02:51:26.572]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:26.572 --> 02:51:29.133]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:51:29.133 --> 02:51:30.293]  Most people have no idea.
[02:51:30.293 --> 02:51:31.073]  They're not after money.
[02:51:31.073 --> 02:51:32.353]  They have all the money they need.
[02:51:32.353 --> 02:51:33.334]  They're after power.
[02:51:33.334 --> 02:51:34.494]  That's what happens here.
[02:51:34.494 --> 02:51:38.955]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:54:11.589 --> 02:54:15.672]  We're gonna talk about who's in the film, break down how the drug war really works, how we can stop it.
[02:54:15.672 --> 02:54:17.453]  Most people now know that it's a fraud.
[02:54:17.453 --> 02:54:18.234]  They don't understand.
[02:54:18.234 --> 02:54:20.115]  The government really does bring it in.
[02:54:20.115 --> 02:54:21.316]  The banks really do launder it.
[02:54:21.316 --> 02:54:24.498]  It's so sick!

[02:55:07.386 --> 02:55:10.928]  The top death squad people are beating people up in England, France.
[02:55:10.928 --> 02:55:12.068]  They're in the U.S.
[02:55:12.068 --> 02:55:13.249]  right now in San Francisco.
[02:55:13.249 --> 02:55:18.352]  We've got people going on the ground to get video and see if the police attack them there, if you videotape them.
[02:55:18.352 --> 02:55:23.394]  I mean this is all mainstream news, continual coverage at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:55:23.394 --> 02:55:26.856]  We're again very honored to have Kevin with us right now.
[02:55:26.856 --> 02:55:27.917]  In fact, the
[02:55:28.954 --> 02:55:36.859]  Document Cam is live, as you can see, and we're also rolling the intro to his new film, The Last White Hope, American Drug War.
[02:55:36.859 --> 02:55:41.242]  We're going to play five minutes of the intro, then we're going to play the audio later of the trailer.
[02:55:41.242 --> 02:55:46.346]  We're going to play some other clips from the film coming up, and that's going to start in about four minutes.
[02:55:46.346 --> 02:55:52.870]  Before I do that, a few sponsors that we need to mention because they make this transmission possible.

[02:56:00.861 --> 02:56:01.902]  I would look like Jabba the Hutt.
[02:56:01.902 --> 02:56:06.346]  I've lost 20 pounds now in about a month.
[02:56:06.346 --> 02:56:07.567]  It's incredible.
[02:56:07.567 --> 02:56:10.889]  Aloe, but it's working out as nutrition, but aloe is part of it.

[02:56:48.266 --> 02:56:49.467]  I don't know if it's going to happen.
[02:56:49.467 --> 02:56:51.889]  The point is, the government hoards and stores food.
[02:56:51.889 --> 02:56:52.730]  We should too.
[02:56:52.730 --> 02:56:53.370]  It's high quality.
