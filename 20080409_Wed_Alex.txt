[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:25.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:25.000 --> 00:32.000]  Well, we've got some celebrating to do, my friends. Some celebrating to do.
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.000]  9-Eleven Truth, the exposure globally, not just in the United States or North America,
[00:37.000 --> 00:46.000]  of the black-off attacks meant to herald the fourth rike of a neo-fascist system,
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.000]  is becoming common knowledge everywhere, and the paradigm of false flags staged terror
[00:52.000 --> 00:58.000]  or self-inflicted wounds is falling apart right now. The Jesse Ventura story that
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  broke here last week during a break, I don't even know if we've aired that yet.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  I know Aaron's taking the full hour and 20-minute interview and putting it together
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.000]  for PrisonPlanet.tv members. We've only put out some selects. I don't believe it's out yet,
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.000]  where during the break, I'm talking to Ventura, 50 minutes into the interview,
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  and he goes, hey, Alex, we can talk about 9-Eleven. I'm ready now.
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  I want to go ahead and do it on your show.
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.000]  And so on my show, I didn't even ask him to.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  Kind of like I had Willie Nelson on, and I had Willie on for quite a while.
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  We were in the interview, and we were in a break, and he goes, hey, let's get into the hard-core stuff,
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  because it's like, I don't even want to get these guys in the spotlight.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  I'm not even pushing them there. If they want to go public,
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  but they say gently, gently, catchy monkey, as an old saying my dad had,
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  and I guess that's the case. It's kind of like a stray cat or dog.
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.000]  You're trying to get it to come over to you, so you can pet it, just ignore it,
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  and it'll come over, but if you try to pet it, it won't.
[01:58.000 --> 02:04.000]  But all these people saying the government killed Kennedy, the government's behind the attacks,
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  Rick Linkletter, Bruce Willis, Jesse Ventura,
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  Rosie O'Donnell, the best actress, Oscar winner this year,
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  Charlie Sheen, of course, started it all with big celebrities going public.
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.000]  He really will be remembered in history.
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  They don't remember the second group to reverse the country east to west.
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  They remember Lewis and Clark, and it's not just that they're celebrities.
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  It's that they have a lot to lose, and that we are a celebrity-driven society,
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  and so that's what people resonated with Charlie Sheen.
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.000]  I'm so busy, I hardly ever even called Charlie anymore.
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  I call him about once a month. He calls me about once a month.
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  I need to just get that man on the phone and say, Charlie, it's time for you to come on the air now,
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  because he really is owed so much of the credit for what's happening now.
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  But the next level, a governor, Jesse Ventura, doing this in a very forceful way,
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.000]  and now people are looking into it, and they're finding out that all these CIA section chiefs,
[02:57.000 --> 03:07.000]  and Ronald Reagan's chief CIA briefer, and Bob Baerb, Bill Christiansen,
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.000]  of course, Ray McGovern, saying it's an inside job, and all the evidence shows inside job,
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.000]  and we've got number three in the Blair government, Meacher, years ago going public,
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.000]  and two different German, former German defense ministers, one parliamentary, one national defense chief,
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  another head of the parliament in Germany, he's gone public, he went public six months after it happened,
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.000]  and before Vambulo, never could get that guy on, had Vambulo on, not the other fellow,
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  we're getting Vambulo back on, by the way.
[03:34.000 --> 03:44.000]  All of this happening, all of this going on, and it's just mind-blowing to have high-level people
[03:44.000 --> 03:53.000]  in the Japanese parliament, and the former Italian president, and the official lie is and has collapsed,
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  and all we need is examples of this, not just exposing government terror,
[03:57.000 --> 04:05.000]  taking that tool away from them, which is the race of the whole, neutralizing their key headcard,
[04:05.000 --> 04:16.000]  but at the same time, showing that the people, that the people can affect change,
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  that we do have power, that the new order is not invincible, that it's a house of cards,
[04:21.000 --> 04:31.000]  and back to the card analogy, during the Renaissance in about 1650, the former highest was the King of Spades,
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  but the people in France, going into the 1700s, said, no, we're going to make the lowest card,
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  the number one card, the Ace of Spades, symbolizing the people and revolution,
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.000]  so we've taken their Ace of Spades away of government-sponsored terror,
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  we've taken it for ourselves, and we're playing the card saying, no, the lowest card is the top card,
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.000]  the Ace of Spades, and we're playing it, and we're hurting them bad.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[05:03.000 --> 05:09.000]  It's known as the Builderburg, but their objective being world domination.
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[05:15.000 --> 05:22.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  Builderburg is making great progress toward a world economy.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need, they're after power.

[06:52.000 --> 06:53.000]  Fact.
[06:53.000 --> 06:59.000]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[07:03.000 --> 07:11.000]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live is unable to remove all toxins.
[07:11.000 --> 07:12.000]  The solution.

[07:53.000 --> 08:10.000]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:10.000 --> 08:20.000]  We are now doing four hours live, ladies and gentlemen. The first three here on the GCN Radio Network from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m.
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  And for the next few weeks, the fourth hour is only on the Internet at infowars.com.
[08:26.000 --> 08:33.000]  We have tens of thousands of people tuning in each and every millisecond there on the streams.
[08:33.000 --> 08:48.000]  If we can bind all of our streams that are even registered by ShoutCast, we are number one, not just in talk, but overall much of the time of every music station, other network, you name it, and only a portion of our streams are tracked by ShoutCast.
[08:48.000 --> 08:56.000]  We also have Windows streams for people that like Windows configurations, and it's an actual, I'm told, Windows configuration.
[08:56.000 --> 09:05.000]  Other people have Windows players, but their player has a patch that just flips over is how it's been described to me. We actually have a Windows player.
[09:05.000 --> 09:15.000]  But I almost want to take it down because so many tens of thousands listen to that now that they don't listen to the other streams, and then that drives down our ranking.
[09:15.000 --> 09:23.000]  But we're still number one even with that, and if it makes it easier for people to listen, that's the point, and I don't care about just having a ranking.
[09:23.000 --> 09:34.000]  When your video is in the top ten for the last six months of Google Video and routinely number one, and many times multiple films I've made are in the top few films, people are watching it.
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  That's where they go to do their viewing.
[09:36.000 --> 09:45.000]  When you're in the number one slot, people see it, and ShoutCast has tens of millions of listeners that tune in every day just to listen to streams there on the site.
[09:45.000 --> 09:53.000]  And so to be number one and talk, that's just one of our streams is number one and talk, and then to be overall number one is so important.
[09:53.000 --> 10:02.000]  And yes, I just said that all my films are for free on the internet. All of them. We can have them all taken down if we wanted to, but we don't.
[10:02.000 --> 10:12.000]  We don't do that. I could have the people selling my videos on eBay shut down right now, but I don't do it.
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  And why? Because, ladies and gentlemen, the mission is waking the people up.
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.000]  The mission is bringing the perpetrators of 9-11 to justice.
[10:21.000 --> 10:30.000]  The mission is stopping government sponsored terror, stopping the New World Order from coming into fruition.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  And so that's why you can get all of my films for free.
[10:33.000 --> 10:40.000]  Now, I've turned down a national distribution deal by one of the biggest movie houses out there.
[10:40.000 --> 10:47.000]  I'm not going to say the name because I wouldn't be able to put my films out for free if I did that.
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  And I have turned down $100,000 advances in things in the past.
[10:51.000 --> 10:58.000]  I haven't just turned down a million dollar deals to go be on international, national, biggest radio networks out there.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  I did that seven years ago, almost eight years ago.
[11:01.000 --> 11:08.000]  And I'm not tooting my horn here. If you actually count the cost and look at the facts, it's not a decision.
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  It's not even a moral thing. We don't have a choice. We have to fight 110%.
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.000]  We can't compromise with this information.
[11:18.000 --> 11:26.000]  We have to do everything we can and follow the path that leads towards the defeat of the New World Order and no other path.
[11:26.000 --> 11:32.000]  My personal safety, my personal future, fame, fortune, none of that enters into the equation.
[11:32.000 --> 11:41.000]  When we deal with survival of the species against a criminal elite who are carrying out predatory actions against the human population
[11:41.000 --> 11:49.000]  and engaging in parasitic predator activities against free humanity, that must be met 110%.
[11:49.000 --> 11:59.000]  It is the individual self-sacrifice that will save humanity in the future and give our future progeny and us currently and our children.
[11:59.000 --> 12:06.000]  We don't even have to wait for the future. Some chance of survival and of moving forward to the next level of human development.
[12:06.000 --> 12:16.000]  If not, we'll be locked in a technocratic dark age, a nightmare grid designed to exterminate the vast majority of us, the commoners,
[12:16.000 --> 12:31.000]  and to seat the elite firmly at the throne of impenetrable despotism, a scientific dictatorship, a scientific system of dehumanization,
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.000]  securing their monopoly of power forever.
[12:35.000 --> 12:49.000]  That said, I do want to challenge all of the listeners to go to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[12:49.000 --> 12:57.000]  Go to prisonplanet.tv and see all of my films in super high quality, download them in better quality, stream download them in better quality
[12:57.000 --> 13:08.000]  to DVDs and CDs and discs and give them to people, also view them in high quality, not the murky, watery, blotchy stuff you find on the free internet sites,
[13:08.000 --> 13:22.000]  which is good as a shock troop to wake up those that don't know, but it also then funds our operation here when you are members of prisonplanet.tv.
[13:22.000 --> 13:30.000]  That is so important. 15 cents a day. And what else do you get with prisonplanet.tv?
[13:30.000 --> 13:40.000]  You get all of my films, my weekly TV report in studio, my weekly in studio interviews, my Sunday radio show videotape with documents and videos added.
[13:40.000 --> 13:46.000]  Trade has a great job putting that together. Aaron puts together some of the other shows. It was a fabulous job.
[13:46.000 --> 13:53.000]  Now we have the one hour overdrive show after the broadcast that will be on Genesis in the next few weeks.
[13:53.000 --> 14:06.000]  It could already be on there, but by choice I'm waiting to let other people get out of the way and for their own self interest.
[14:06.000 --> 14:18.000]  And the show is again goes to three o'clock now. Now yesterday I went to 5.30 central.
[14:18.000 --> 14:25.000]  So I did a five and a half hour radio show yesterday. I did two hours and 30 minutes extra.
[14:25.000 --> 14:36.000]  I did a simulcast with National British Radio for 45 minutes in the second hour of overdrive in hour number four.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  Excuse me, hour number five. I went into hour number six.
[14:39.000 --> 14:45.000]  And we also took the gloves off again yesterday a little bit more.
[14:45.000 --> 14:55.000]  And so that's basically what's happening here. And you can see the video of that and see the document cam and the guest cam, two camera shoot.
[14:55.000 --> 15:05.000]  It's actually a four camera shoot, but two cameras on me, a camera on my guest, a document cam, a video feed, play DVDs, play computer files, play YouTube videos, whatever we want here.
[15:05.000 --> 15:14.000]  And then we stream that, mix that together and stream that to you in 64 bit super high quality down to you with the video.
[15:14.000 --> 15:21.000]  Then we're uploading that to prisonplanet.tv what last night within two hours of the show being over.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  It automatically end codes and then post to a new live link there for members.
[15:26.000 --> 15:37.000]  So you can watch the live overdrive show taped like a DVR on demand when you get home or when you go into work at night and your security guard or your professor you want it on the background.
[15:37.000 --> 15:49.000]  Whatever, fast forward, pause, rewind, blow stuff up, whatever you want, you can do it with the postings we're doing each and every day of the live transmission.
[15:49.000 --> 16:02.000]  Now the family is complaining because I normally run home about four, you know, get off the air to do some work till about four, run home for four or five hours, put the kids to sleep at eight, nine o'clock, come back to work till midnight one, two in the morning.
[16:02.000 --> 16:09.000]  And lately I've just been showing up at six, seven and then leaving at eight or nine or then being tired and not going back to work.
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  So I have to cut it off at three.
[16:11.000 --> 16:21.000]  But sometimes I will overdrive and or sometimes I'll say, okay, I'm off at three, but now we're going to give you an hour long sneak peek of a film I'm making.
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  Or, you know, here's an interview I did with somebody on video three years ago.
[16:25.000 --> 16:33.000]  Or here's the extra stuff with Ben Livingston, the father of weather weapons. We're just going to play this for you now.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  That's the type of stuff we've gotten to the top of some and we've got hundreds of hours of things.
[16:36.000 --> 16:43.000]  Nobody's ever seen that are just excellent because I was trying to craft it and put together and put documents to it and put it on the web or put it out in films.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  Not now. We're just going to throw it at you.
[16:45.000 --> 16:53.000]  Like yesterday we had a 25 minute interview with Japanese TV where we videotaped their interview with me.
[16:53.000 --> 16:59.000]  So that's the type of stuff you're going to get with a prisonplanet.tv membership or with your exclusive membership.
[16:59.000 --> 17:05.000]  You can watch all the films, the audio, read my book Paul Lawson's book, 15 cents a day prisonplanet.tv.
[17:05.000 --> 17:14.000]  If you haven't gotten a membership or let's say you had one three years ago and you watched the films that were on it and you know, the 500 pieces of media and you let your subscription elapsed and end.
[17:14.000 --> 17:26.000]  And now, once you know, we got two CDNs, two different companies. We got two big companies, what Limelight and Mirror Image.
[17:26.000 --> 17:32.000]  And then I've got seven servers of my own. It's seven, isn't it? I'm looking out the window at the engineers.
[17:32.000 --> 17:40.000]  Seven servers and then two big CDNs. And so, man, it's just, if you've got it, it's at four times T1 speed.
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.000]  I mean, if you've got the connections or if you've got dial-up, we've got low quality ones there for you.
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  Or you can still dial in by dial-up and take a day to download it.
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.000]  But with a four times T1 speed, you can download it down a long program in about two minutes.
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.000]  Or you can stream download it with Flash while you're watching.
[17:55.000 --> 17:58.000]  And we're just going to keep upgrading and upgrading and upgrading and upgrading and upgrading.
[17:58.000 --> 18:03.000]  And I will tell you, in the next six months, we're going to find the talent and people that we believe have the info.
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.000]  We're going to set them up with studios around the country and we're going to have TV feeds for you.
[18:07.000 --> 18:12.000]  I believe a morning show, my show, and then an evening news program.
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  So that's on the cooker, too, for PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  Monday was the fourth anniversary of PrisonPlanet.TV.
[18:19.000 --> 18:28.000]  Or get the high quality DVDs and books and videos and everything we carry in the films I've made in the infowars.com store.
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  Go to infowars.com and when you purchase the DVDs, the books, we buy better computers.
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  We buy better cameras. We see them as weapons.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  And we just marvel over the new, you know, Vulcan death cannons we buy.
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  And that's basically, you know, what the A-10 war dogs got.
[18:43.000 --> 18:49.000]  When we buy a new digital camera or a new computer or sign a contract for a new super high powered CDN.
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  That's like a giant particle beam weapon.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  We're going to aim right at the New World Order's eyeball.
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  And we just throw the throttle down in full power and go, yes!
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  And just start firing on them. Ha-ha!
[18:59.000 --> 19:02.000]  I mean, that's what it is. The capital comes in here, ladies and gentlemen.
[19:02.000 --> 19:05.000]  And then we just pour it right back into the info war.
[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  Just the more power you give us, the more energy you give us,
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.000]  the more you feed into our cyclotronic converters,
[19:11.000 --> 19:17.000]  the more we fire out as you, the population, then pick up that information
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000]  and then like diodes or dynamos or relays, you up the power
[19:22.000 --> 19:30.000]  and just continue upping the power, upping the resonant information warfare
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  as the New World Order quakes in their boots,
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000]  as more and more people find out it's okay to stand up and speak out and expose the tyranny.
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  I'm going to come back and briefly get into the huge victories we're having for 9-Eleven Truth.
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  Daniel Sinjata joining us today to pop in with his views on what's happening.
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  We've got the Watson brothers joining us from England with incredible news.
[19:48.000 --> 20:03.000]  I haven't even gotten into it. It's just an ultra-massive, important, revolutionary transmission.
[20:21.000 --> 20:24.000]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation,
[20:24.000 --> 20:28.000]  we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size
[20:28.000 --> 20:32.000]  without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[20:32.000 --> 20:35.000]  Laser technology at its best.
[20:35.000 --> 20:41.000]  For more information call 702-953-0267
[20:41.000 --> 20:49.000]  or visit www.lasemedinc.com
[20:49.000 --> 20:54.000]  Call 702-953-0267
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  It is a big idea. A New World Order.
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[21:12.000 --> 21:15.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[21:15.000 --> 21:22.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.000]  Order in-game on DVD at www.prisonplanet.com

[21:48.000 --> 21:53.000]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  Someday, cancer, diabetes and poor health may disrupt your life.
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  Are you going to be the one and four who gets cancer in their lifetime?
[21:59.000 --> 22:03.000]  Well, now you can set aside your worries and offset that chance with Alcavita.

[22:07.000 --> 22:10.000]  and is highly alkaline to help balance our acidic lifestyles.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  Fast food and unhealthy habits contribute to excess acid
[22:13.000 --> 22:17.000]  and the undesirable effects that lay foundations of disease and poor health.
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  Do you remember the old saying, an apple a day keeps the doctor away.
[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  Those words of wisdom are true. Your body heals itself when eating well.
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.000]  Rather than fighting the effects of chemicals like corn syrup, sugar, preservatives
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  and other unpronounceable ingredients, your body is the best pharmacy in the world
[22:31.000 --> 22:36.000]  and with Alcavita, it can help your body naturally neutralize excess body acid

[24:03.000 --> 24:09.000]  Daniel Sinjata, a star rescuing me in a lot of the TV programs, movies, you name it
[24:09.000 --> 24:15.000]  they're pumping in on the next segment. Then the Watson brothers are going to join us.
[24:15.000 --> 24:21.000]  This is the huge, huge news.
[24:21.000 --> 24:27.000]  It's up on www.prisonplanet.com right now.
[24:27.000 --> 24:33.000]  This is huge. Chinese paramilitary thugs policed London torch rally.
[24:33.000 --> 24:38.000]  It has been confirmed that in Paris, in London and in many other European major cities
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.000]  where the torch comes through, there are hundreds of paramilitary police
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.000]  the same units used to suppress and arrest political dissidents in China
[24:47.000 --> 24:54.000]  and the British police with them manhandle, beat, attack, slam British citizens, French citizens
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  and if there's any free Tibet signs, this is confirmed by mainstream French news
[24:58.000 --> 25:03.000]  and there's photos of all this and video, they run up and grab the Tibetan signs away
[25:03.000 --> 25:09.000]  French police with Chinese murdering thugs communist. These are the folks that take you
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.000]  and kill you if you speak out against the government in China
[25:12.000 --> 25:19.000]  and now they're allowed to come to France and England and they are allowed to do whatever they want.
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.000]  Now, Paul has put together a big laundry list of examples.
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  In fact, he wrote the story this morning and I called up and said, Paul, add all the other stuff
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  the other articles we've done about Ukrainian troops that just showed up in northern England
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.000]  and suddenly started searching everybody and they said, yeah, the Ukrainian troops are here
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  notice every time there's a flood, the Mexican troops come in and they make a big PR stunt
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  or we get attacked on 9-11 and there's Norwegian AWACS and F-16s
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  it's any precedent they can set or the police exchange programs
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.000]  or the deal signed to use Canadian and Mexican troops in the U.S. during, quote, disastrous or defied terrorist
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  I mean, the unthinkable is happening but who would have imagined if we'd have said a month ago
[25:59.000 --> 26:06.000]  oh yes, in Europe and in England, there will be a Mexican paramilitary police brought over from China
[26:06.000 --> 26:13.000]  and they will, with the police, will physically attack British citizens and French citizens
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  and that's the country's confirmed.
[26:15.000 --> 26:20.000]  I'm looking at video and photos of this right now.
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.000]  I just can't believe it.
[26:24.000 --> 26:32.000]  Even I can't believe that they're really doing it, that this is really being manifest,
[26:32.000 --> 26:39.000]  that it's not the stuff of talk now, it's not hypothetical
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  and it's all done by design.
[26:42.000 --> 26:50.000]  This is meant by the social psychologists, by the behavioral psychologists
[26:50.000 --> 26:57.000]  that are engineering our society to make this an unreal world, a bizarre world
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  where they're ordered that when Tibetan protesters, about 50 of them peacefully show up in front of the UN
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  it's on video.
[27:05.000 --> 27:10.000]  The police run over and start screaming, we're going to kill you, that's a quote, on video
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  they pull out metal batons, the retractable, extendable type
[27:13.000 --> 27:20.000]  and start beating them to bloody pulp saying this is an unauthorized demonstration.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  I mean this is Russia, this is China.
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  Now some cops haven't been converted over to the new tyranny, so they leave you alone.
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.000]  Like in Austin, Texas, because they've lost dozens and dozens of lawsuits
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.000]  arresting people back in the late 90s and 2000 for standing on the street corner with signs.
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.000]  They just lost another case last month where they arrested somebody at the state Supreme Court.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  But at least because we've had so many lawsuits against them, we still have some good courts
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  in a few spots, they've backed off here.
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  But New York, you demonstrate without a permit, they come out and they arrest you.
[27:52.000 --> 28:00.000]  But if you're Tibetans, they extend metal batons in New York City and I mean full power.
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.000]  Police, big men, full power with metal batons.
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.000]  Long extent, I mean it's like a sword, it's got so much power.
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.000]  I actually had to do some stunts in Scanner Darkly, even though I'm not a really certified stuntman.
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.000]  These big football players basically jabbed me with it and then I had to hit my knees
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  and they got all bloody because I had to do like 10 takes dragging me.
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  And I weighed a lot so they would rip my skin, they picked me up under the suit
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  and the suit all got ripped up and closed everywhere.
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  But it's rotoscoped afterwards with the film so you don't see all that.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  But I mean just being jabbed because they wanted it to be real.
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  They said go ahead and give someone a jab so he knows when to act like he's been hit by juice.
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  And just somebody barely hit me when one hurts.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  These are metal, retractable.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  It's like an antenna.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  You can cut some out of pieces with the old fashioned metal antennas.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  And I mean this copter is full power.
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.000]  Wham, wham as they lay on the ground begging.
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  Ah, please no.
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  We ought to play the audio.
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  I think we've played it before.
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.000]  And just yes, savage hate.
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  Death to America, death to the First Amendment.
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.000]  We hate the country, we are with the Chinese murderers.
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.000]  And then there's all this disinfo everywhere.
[29:11.000 --> 29:15.000]  I mean I was in Whole Foods last night buying some medicine for one of my children.
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.000]  And there was like two different magazine covers that said,
[29:18.000 --> 29:24.000]  China's not dangerous, China's good, China's helpful, China's wonderful.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  Yeah, they just killed 60 million people.
[29:26.000 --> 29:32.000]  They just take Falon Gong descendants who are totally peaceful and harvest their organs.
[29:32.000 --> 29:36.000]  But don't worry, now they're going to come to America and England.
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  Now they're going to beat you in the head with clubs
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  and knock your teeth out with savage pleasure.
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  And you're going to thank the government.
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.

[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I do not have words to describe how huge, how serious, how massive, what a big deal this is.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And this story needs to go big.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  People need to know about this.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  This needs to be reversed.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  They're trying to set precedence with Mexican troops during Katrina and Dutch troops in AWACS and F-16s after 9-11 in the U.S.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  We've had other troops from the Ukraine and other places running around England, pulling people over, pointing guns at them.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  Did become a big controversy in England.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  I've been to urban warfare drills.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  We've gotten footage all over the country where the Marines train with foreign troops and have roleplayers saying,
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  I'm an American, please don't put me in a camp.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  And were the foreign troops practiced taking Americans to camps?
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Then in about 2002, the U.S. signed an agreement with Canada and Mexico to jointly police to quote, fight terror.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  Then they get everybody trained with foreign troops fighting fires and things like that or running soup lines.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  But if you read the documents with Northcom, they want to use foreign mercs,
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  because foreigners will generally shoot at somebody who they don't speak the same language as.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  The British brought Hessians in here twice from 1776 through 1814.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  And so this is the norm in war.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  The Vatican, of course, had the Swiss.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  The Swiss were neutral, but they sold their armies and they were some of the most feared.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  I mean, this just happens over and over again.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  We have our own police beating up in New York and unauthorized peaceful Tibetan demonstration in front of the U.N.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  with metal batons, blood everywhere, them begging for their lives.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  And the news just said, you know, basically this is a good thing.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  They deserve it.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  It's unauthorized.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  Now in France, it's mainstream news reports that they run up, grab Tibetan headbands off the crowd,
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  no free Tibet signs are allowed in Paris.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  And they don't use Parisian police.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  They are there to back up and they stand behind as secret police from China, the secret political commissariat.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  That's who they officially are.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  In sweatsuits, viciously attack people, karate, chopping, slamming, choking, and they go to jail.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  They attack you and then hand you the foreign Chinese communists who take people to their deaths and take their organs
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  and they inject people with chemicals and murder them or paralyze them.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  I mean, it's just the Falun Gong's covered it, the Epoch Times, the photos, the admissions.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  They publicly execute people at sports stadiums every week for speaking out politically.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  They machine gun teenagers.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  I mean, we got, there's photos of it in the end game, just little girls' heads blown off.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  I mean, with their brains all over the ground.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  I mean, this is who is coming.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  I'll never forget four years ago, people were calling.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  They go, tune into News 8 now.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  It's going to re-air because they air everything every 24 hours, you know, every hour for 24 hours.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  It's a local Time Warner news channel we have.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  Only one of five cities in the country that have it.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  And it was all about, oh, you know, 20-something Japanese police are going to be able to arrest people in Austin
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  and 24 Austin police are going to Japan to be able to arrest in Japan, in Tokyo.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  And they've had this since the 60s, this exchange program, but now it's going hot.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  And this, this is a major precedent setting case, headline, Chinese paramilitary thugs, police, London, torch rally,
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  outrage after British government allowed members of China's internal security force to manhandle protesters.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  And they go and single people out.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  They do not allow, this has been put on Chinese TV, they do not allow signs for Tibet.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  This is unprecedented.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  This is Europe-wide.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  Paul Watson, Steve Watson.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  Who wants to go first here?
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  And I appreciate you coming on.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  Hello, Alex.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  This is Paul.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  Paul, Steve.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  Hello, Steve.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  Hello, Alex.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  How you doing?
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  We hadn't had you on my friend in a while, just as Brits, who've always been firstly independent,
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  now domesticated, just like us here in the U.S.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  What is it like to see this happening?
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  Well, my first impression of it when I saw these so-called guardians of the Olympic torch assault
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  and manhandling protesters and barking orders at everybody.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  I mean, it appeared to me just from the video that, you know, they were in charge.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  The British police were basically taking orders from them from what I could see.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  And I was thinking, like everybody else who are these people.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  Then it comes out today that they're the creme de la creme of the Chinese paramilitary police.
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  I told you that story earlier, Alex, that I was in Shanghai last summer and we were walking
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  down the street.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  And then I suddenly saw these guys who were a foot taller than everyone else, frog marching
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  down the street, you know, in a military parade, basically, wearing bulky camo gear.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  So I'm thinking, you know, this is Shanghai, not Beijing.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  It's supposed to be the business capital of China, not the military and government capital,
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  which is what Beijing is.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  So I said to my girlfriend, why are the military soldiers frog marching down the street?
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  And she said, oh, they're not military, they're just regular police.
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  And these were the same guys that were in London two days ago throwing protesters around in Britain.
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  Now again, she would know she's Chinese.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  Exactly.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  So it comes out that they're, you know, highly trained in riot control, martial arts, and
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  hand-to-hand combat.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  They've come over here on visitor visas.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  They've not said who they're working for.
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  And the labor part of the British government has just let them in.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  And they're basically in control of security for the Olympic torch procession.
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  And then in the U.S., peaceful 50 Tibetans with people speaking English and the police
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  walk up and say, quote, I'm going to kill you.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  That's a quote.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  This is unauthorized.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  Pull out metal batons and begin savaging men and women.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  I mean, we have reached pit of hell level.
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  Do you understand you cowardly, weak people that have, you know, turned into such slime
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  out there listening that support this government?
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  This is land of the free home of the brave.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  Look at England.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  It's all turning into sass.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  Go ahead.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  Steve, what is this like for you?
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  Well, it's surreal, isn't it?
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  I mean, if you take a look at these men walking around and look at how they're dressed, I mean,
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  they're dressed in sort of shiny blue track suits with white baseball caps.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  I mean, you would think that they were, you know, part of the official Olympic committee,
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  but they're not there.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  They're basically soldiers, Chinese soldiers walking around on British soil, you know,
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  manhandling protesters.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  And the other thing to be said is, I got a email yesterday from somebody who was at
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  the protest.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  Stay there.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  I want to hear about this breaking news with Steve Watson.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  This is a big deal.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you will have Chinese troops in America line you and your family
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  up and gun you down and throw you in pits.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  I'm not joking.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  How many times have I told you that?
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  How many times did I tell you Rush Limbaugh would endorse Hillary?
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  I told you five years ago.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  They plan to use him.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  In fact, in official U.S.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  government maps, large areas of the U.S.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  will be policed by him.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  It is a big idea.
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  A new world order.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:20:00.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:03.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  Put their objective being world domination.
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  of humanity is at hand.

[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  Most people have no idea.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  They're not after money.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  They have all the money they need.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  They're after power.

[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  and is the plan for America.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.

[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than have heated,
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  the champion juicer is the best way to get your nutrients or body craves.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  The champion juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  This gives you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins, and trace minerals.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness,
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable life-threatening diseases.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  Juicing with the champion juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  Put the champion juicer to work for you and your family.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  Get creative with your juicer and add a grain mill attachment to make your own healthy, fresh flower.

[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  The world's finest juicer is champion juicer.

[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  Mady's great grandchildren believed you could live to 103
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  So Cyrus Jones lived forever
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  You know I love Elaine Elsa?
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  It reminds me of so much of my dead family from north, eastern Texas,
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  right where east Texas meets central meets north.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  My dad's family's from right in the same area and it's that same voice,
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  it's that same look in the eyes, just a certain brand of Texan.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  Most people I knew that talked like Elaine Elsa and acted like him, looked like him.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  All dead.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  What an icon man, I hope he doesn't go when he's 84 like Charlton Heston.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  Oh man, we got Kevin Booth joining us, his film aired on Showtime.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  The big expanded edition with a lot of my footage and stuff is out.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  We've got it in stock, just came in.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  You can order it at InfoWars.com, that's coming up in this third hour and fourth hour today.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  Going back to Steve, Steve, you're in London, you had friends that read the protest.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  Tell us what they saw, not just what's been on the news.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  Yeah, well I got an email yesterday from somebody who was at the protest
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  who basically said to me, he wasn't a protestor, he was simply there to document it.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  He doesn't have any particularly strong leaning towards the free Tibet movement,
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  but just wanted to be there to document the experience really.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  He said that he was just walking around filming and came across a scene
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  where a protestor had been pinned to the ground by three police
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  and so he started filming it with his camera.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  As he approached it, it was about 30 meters away and moved closer in.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  The police picked up on the fact that he was filming
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  and basically just forgot about the protestors that were pinning down
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  and went after him because he was filming it.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  He'd also been filming the Tibetan flags.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  An enormous amount of Tibetan flags there.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  Basically they pinned, they got hold of him, he didn't resist.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  They punched him in the back, shoved him to the ground and put a knee on his neck.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  Now is this the communist Chinese death forces?
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  And that's what they are, they go around killing people all day.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  In fact, I've talked a lot of folks in China who've told stories about,
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  they'll take a political dissident, cut their male breast off,
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  cut their genitals off and then let them bleed to death.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  One group of cops does that and then the plainclothes paramilitary
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  and then another group comes along and arrests them for being a pervert
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  who cut their own genitals off.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  Paul, you've heard about that stuff.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  You hear all kinds of horror stories.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  What I've noticed is the media is not giving a platform to the real issues
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  that they call them anti-Chinese protesters.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  I mean, they're not protesting against Chinese people or the country as the government.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  Well, our Falong Gong who live in China and who are killed for their religious beliefs
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  who are peaceful and do nothing, I mean, I guess they're anti-Chinese too.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  Well, it's just like you're against the government carrying out 9-11,
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  now you're anti-America when they're destroying America.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  But going back to you, Steve, were these communists Chinese doing this
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  or their British servants?
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  These were the British servants, but I mean, you know.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  And they took his footage.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  That's the point.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  He was filming the flags and they deleted all the photos and the video.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  Arts criminals.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  Well, look, that's how it starts.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  If you're talking and more than three people in London now
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  or have a video camera, they'll walk up even when I was being quiet
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  and they'll say, give me your ID, sir.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  Well, you guys were there turning your camera off and putting you in a data base
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  turning for your safety.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  It's all intimidation.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  Man, we're in fascism, Steve.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  Well, that's right.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  I mean, this particular person was also asked for ID and didn't have any.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  Cops or criminals.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  There isn't a law to carry ID.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  So, you know, you don't have to carry it so you didn't have any.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  So basically they decided to make him the victim of their...
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  Well, look, he has to sue them.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  I know they're being ordered to do it.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  But man, and the cops in England now, they would walk up to you
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  and look at you with hate and pleasure as they violated freedom.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  Steve, Paul, why do they hate your freedom so much?
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  I mean, why do they revel in destroying any freedom?
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  Why did the British police?
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  Well, that's what they've been trained to do.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  I mean, shortly after you were there in 2005, they passed a law
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  that basically outlawed protest in Britain.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  You have to get government permission to protest against the government,
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  which is, in effect, an outlaw.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  You have to get a permit to do it.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  And I mean, there's comments on my article on info wars
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  about how police would, you know, people would do the Olympic torch procession
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  and then they'd be assigned an individual police officer
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  just to watch them and make sure that...
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  That's right. How dare you, boo!
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  A commissar's now looking...
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  We're one step away from being sent to gulags.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  I'm not joking.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  We're on the march.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  The empire's on the run.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[1:29:54.000 --> 1:30:00.000]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients,
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  most of which are synthetic.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  and others are absorbed into the skin.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron

[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  The government is going to know where everybody's ass is every minute of the day and night.

[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:17.000]  I am a Midwest farmer. I make a living off the land.
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  I ride a John Deere tractor. I'm a liberated man.
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  The rain hasn't fallen since the middle of July.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  And if it don't come soon, my crops will die.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  The bankman says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  He tells me that he's coming, but the clouds are coming too.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  He ain't my friend.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  In front of everyone, the CBC, French TV, Canadian,
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  we've got links to all of it here in the story, are reporting that people try to wear headbands
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  and the Chinese police come out and rip them off of you.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  They come up and attack people with Tibetan flags.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  British police come up and get in the face of anyone.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  I mean, this is just in your face, everything we were taught about the Nazis,
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  everything we were taught about the Communists under Lenin and Stalin,
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  and the worst stuff under Khrushchev.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  And Communist China today is still doing all the horrors that were carried out in past
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  by past grand champions of evil.
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  And they could have had British police thug everybody, but that isn't enough.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  They could have had Paris police do this.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  That would be bad enough. No, no, no, they've got to have, and I've watched the videos.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  It's incredible in the photos.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  I mean, they are commanding.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  Gentlemen, is this not just us being brought into the modern New World Order system?
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  We're firing paramilitary political officers, political police,
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  sit there and just feed on the public?
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  Oh, yes. It's globalization.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  If you're going to have globalization, you've got to have globalized security and policing operations.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  That's what happened in Scotland in 2003, I think it was,
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  where you had the French and Ukrainian soldiers pulling people out of their cars at checkpoints.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  They were part of the NATO operation.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  So it's all about globalized security forces of foreign troops in the country.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  Please, the paramilitary police that were shoving protesters around in London,
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  it's from the same unit that's been shooting people in last or in different areas in Tibet and killing people.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  And now photos have come out of flatback trucks handing out robes,
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  the reddish brown and orange robes to the Chinese military.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  And it's been confirmed, even the British government's admitted,
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  they're dressing up like monks and then they can machine gun the peaceful people.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  Yeah, we had an article a couple of weeks ago that showed a supposed Tibetan protest
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  that wielding this giant sword that was going around attacking people.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  But in the photos released by the Chinese state media,
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  he'd been airbrushed out of the photo,
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  and it turns out that he's a security official from the same unit that was in London.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  So the reports were true that they were instigating some of the...
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  Because I mean, people were confused saying,
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  why are these Tibetans attacking other Han Chinese ethnic groups
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  and attacking their own businesses, setting fires to places?
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  A lot of that was obviously copycat, but from the evidence,
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  it was started by the PLA and the other security...
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  That's right, they were doing mass arrest ahead of the Olympics of the entire leadership
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  or who they believed didn't agree with the government.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  Our government's making lists for here.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  And so when they do that here, it'll be the same MO.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  They will have people dressed up, as I've always said, like militia people.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  It'll be school buses, folks, because they had been lauding run-offs in Serbia against the Serbs.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  And then when the Serbs fight back, then they say,
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  oh, look, they're attacking innocent people.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  Well, it'll be the reverse here, but the similar first step.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  You'll have them bombing buildings, killing cops, attacking schools.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  They'll even, quote, kill the terrorists and have maybe even me dressed up, you know, in a uniform.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  It'll be me bloody on television.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  And all they do is grab me at my house the night before,
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  and then they go shoot up a school bus, and then they shoot Alex Jones,
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  and then they drag me out and have me bloody land on the ground.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  And that's how they do it, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  And they don't think they don't have special ops ready to machine gun up school buses
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  because they believe in justifies the means.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  They're brainwashed, mainly Christian Zionists in this country,
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  who believe that it's a holy war against the Muslims,
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  and they have to do this to make Jesus come.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  And so they got to kill a few hundred kids in school buses.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  And I say that because the CIA did it in Italy to blame it on the communists,
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  and they did it in Kosovo.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  It's one of their favorites.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  It's their fave, you could say,
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  in their kind of asymmetrical low-intensity combat to machine gun or blow up a bus,
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  and then they'll go kill somebody and throw them down the road,
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  or grab a patsy who's mentally ill and put them out.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  And when they machine gun a bus full of your kids,
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  and then say it's domestic al-Qaeda,
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  and people that talk about freedom are now al-Qaeda,
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  as they're now saying, as they've said all over the news,
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  people that think the government did 9-11,
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  we're really terrorists with al-Qaeda.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  You see, that's the Pentagon talking point.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  And it's completely...
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  And folks, I'm not joking.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  You understand? I'm not joking about this.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  Paul, Steve?
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  Steve, I want to hear what you have to say just about all of this.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  Well, going back to the Chinese paramilitaries,
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  you know today that they're in San Francisco, the same group,
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  marching downtown San Francisco.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  See, we need more articles. I saw that, and I'm so upset I forgot.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  That's right.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  Foreign Chinese secret police are in San Francisco alert.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  In fact, where is the procession?
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  We've got to get video.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  I demand that info warriors go mobile and go out there
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  and get us video and see if the San Francisco cops
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  are under global control and see if they...
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  Go ahead. Sorry.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  Well, I can tell you where the procession is.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  I've got it here in front of me.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  It's starting this afternoon at 1 p.m.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  It goes from Makovikov, northbound to 3rd Street,
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  and will eventually end up in the Justin Herman Plaza
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  for a concluding ceremony.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  So any listeners that know that area,
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  if they could get down there and get some footage of that,
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  that would be good.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  This is the highest priority as we fight the terrorist forces.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  This just in confirmed.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  We got it, and we're confirming it right now.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  Paul Harvey News Today reported international troops
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  will protect the Olympic torch today in San Francisco.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  That was Harvey's report this morning.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  Let's try to pull it. John Google that.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  Again, international troops, this is a quote,
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  will protect the Olympic torch today,
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  and we have mainstream news. Steve has it.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  Steve, give us your sources on the fact
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  that international forces in the U.S.
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  quote, protecting their Olympic torch
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  that Hitler modernized, he drew up the rings.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Headline, Chinese paramilitary secret police
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  to protect Nazi ceremony.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  You couldn't make it up. It's insane.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  ZX-9 emergency, red-level emergency.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  Our country is being conditioned to foreign troops
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  in mass conditioning exercises,
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  just like they use the Superbowl to condition you
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  to get rid of Posse commentatus,
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  which they now announce they've gotten rid of.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  Steve, give us more info.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Well, I've just read it on a sort of local Fox page.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  It just says the Olympic torch makes its only U.S. appearance today
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  with a ceremonial run through the streets of San Francisco.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  It will be protected by a squad of Chinese security officers
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  known as flame attendants.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  The guards wear bright blue tracks suits.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  They've succeeded in keeping human rights protesters
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  from grabbing the torch at other appearances.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  Trees on! Trees on! Trees on!
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  I'm sick of it!
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  Yeah, it was the same guy that we're in London,
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  but you know the Australian Prime Minister himself
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  today banned China from deploying its own security
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  during the torch relay in Canberra.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Men, I want reports, I want total coverage on Info Wars,
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  I want total coverage on Jones Report,
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  I want total coverage on President Planet.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  This is all we're covering.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  Now, I've got the American drug war coming on,
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  and this nexus is in to how they built their police state grid
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  off of fighting the crises they created, controlling
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  the narcotics being shipped in.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  But I'm not kidding, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  large areas of the country, the entire Pacific Coast area,
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  and this is in my films, this is in the official
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  newspaper articles from the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  Bernadine Smith put them together in Huge Binders,
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  I've got one in storage, that's a huge binder
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  that weighs like 15 pounds, twice the size of a Dallas
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  phone book, just with mainstream news articles
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  from all the major papers admitting it.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  It's in the State Department Plan 7277,
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  and it says the entire West Coast,
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  all the way from Idaho down to Arizona
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  and Nevada, over to California, back up to the coast,
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  that entire, let me see, one, two, three, four, five,
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  six, seven state area is to be patrolled by Chinese troops
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  and notice where they came under international treaty
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  agreements, it's the West Coast, emergency,
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  ladies and gentlemen, these bastards, these pieces of,
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  oh my, I just can't, you know what,
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  if we don't get mad about this, there's nothing
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  that's gonna make us mad.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  Watson, both of you, tell me what you think about this.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  Well, I'm not surprised that the Labour Party let them in,
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  whereas Australia is banning them, especially in London,
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  because you know who runs London,
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  he's known as Red Ken, Ken Livingstone,
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  and it recently came out that he was there,
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  or his aides were a member of a secret Marxist cell
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  that quote plotted to turn London into a socialist city state.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  So this is the guy who's running London at the moment,
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  so it's no surprise that the government let them in
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  on, you know, visits to visas when they're actually
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  paramilitary police.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I feel like a moment of silence
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  for this country.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  Do you understand I have videotaped personally,
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  trips, training to take your children away from you
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  and put you on your knees and blow your head off?
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  It's in police state 2000, Paul has links to it,
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  they train to put you on your knees and stick a muzzle
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  to the back of the American people's head,
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  and they plan to use these evil communist murderers on us.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  I am sick of it.
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  I'm sorry guys, I'm just so, I wish I was in San Francisco
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  right now because, you know, I go down there and videotaping
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  and one of those dirty murder and pieces of trash
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  put their hands on me.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  I guarantee you the cops would probably get me down on the ground,
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  take their gun out, and just, no, they'd probably taser me
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  till I died, and the news would say I deserved it.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  This country's gone, it's run by nothing but filth.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  Let me tell you, all the cops and all of you that serve it,
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  they're going to take your pension funds,
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  you're going to die of Alzheimer's from all the shots
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  they've shot you up with, they hate you,
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  so you go ahead and serve the evil.
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  You go ahead and serve them, your peace is a filth.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  Look, you guys go ahead and talk, I'm going to take a break.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  I'm sorry, you've got the next five minutes,
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  you just talk about whatever you want.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  Well, I mean, we've talked about precedence for, you know,
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  globalisation and exchange of policing and troop deployment
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  between countries.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  They used the 2006 Stocker World Cup in Germany
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  to ship German police over to,
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  and these were uniformed police to patrol British streets
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  and go and bust British citizens
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  who were potential troublemakers planning on travelling
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  to the Stocker World Cup in Germany.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  So you had German police in Britain
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  carrying out operations against British citizens,
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  and the German Interior Minister
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  changed their country's constitution before the World Cup
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  to allow internal troop deployments for, quote,
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  security reasons.
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  So that's another example where they use one of these
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  global sporting events to ram through some of this conditioning
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  to accept foreign troops and changing their own constitution
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  and things like that.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  Well, also, as well, you've got, in four years' time,
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  you've got the Olympics in London,
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  and it's been debated by the government,
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  it's come out that the government is considering having,
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  shipping in FBI agents and Israeli police security services
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  to police the Olympics in London because, as they say,
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  the prime targets are U.S. and Israeli athletes
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  for any would-be terrorists.
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  So they're actually considering bringing in Israeli troops
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  to police the streets of London,
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  and, of course, the excuse for that is the Olympic Games.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  So there's another example.
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  Well, also, guys, remember how, during the World Cup,
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  they'd have British troops and police in Germany,
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  and then in England, they'd have the Germans,
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  and then in Italy, they'd have Germans.
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  I mean, this is all being trained.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  Go ahead.
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  Well, yeah, that's what I was talking about,
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  and, I mean, it's always just a big surveillance
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  and police state showcase.
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  I mean, it's like the guy at Super Bowl every year,
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  they talk about, you know, they're scanning the crowd
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  to pick out criminals and stuff.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  It's just a big showcase.
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  In Beijing, they're bugging people's hotel rooms
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  and stuff that visit, you know.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  They've got surveillance cameras and systems
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  that can record conversations on the street.
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  So it's always a big beta test
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  for the nice little tracking and control programs
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  that they want to unfurl nationwide.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  I mean, they use every single sporting event for that purpose.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  And to train the public to live in a grid
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  with a bunch of criminals running and sucking off everybody,
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  and it hurts every one of those dumb cops
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  that's part of this is being sucked on just as much as us.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Yeah, you've got the U.S. State Department earlier.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  This year issued warnings about how anybody traveling
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  to Beijing for the Olympics should expect the hotel
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  to be bugged, should expect that everywhere they go
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  to be tracked by the police,
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  because that's just the way they do it in China.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  Which is the way they do it in America as well,
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  but nobody noticed the pot calling the kettle black.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  Yeah.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  Well, both sides point to each other
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  when they're all under U.N. agreements
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  running the exact same operation.
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  It's all international standards.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  China is a darling because they sign the agreements
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  with the eugenicists in 75 to black-op their population,
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  to poison them, to sterilize them, to kill their babies.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  And that's why they are the darling.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  They are the God force.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  They are the imperial army of death
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  that will serve the bankers.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  You want to see your new God?
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  He is a Chinese soldier, and I'm not kidding.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  Go ahead.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  And again, these same paramilitary troops
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  have been killing farmers who have uprisings
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  in the rural areas of China
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  when the troops come and force them off their land.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  And I mean, which is to emphasize the fact
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  that Chinese citizens are the victims of this government.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  I mean, there's comments on my article saying,
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  you know, I hate China. I'm never going to visit.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  I mean, you've got to separate the two.
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  This is the government. This is not the people.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  Oh, their people absolutely hate it.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  The media makes it that issue of all Chinese.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  They go, all the Chinese are for this.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  And then that makes you hate Chinese
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  when the Chinese hate the tyranny they're under as well.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  And our dirty, filthy, wicked government in 1949,
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  now declassified, put that murdering sack of crap.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  Excuse me, folks. I'm just really angry.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  Mao Zedongan, you know why I say that?
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  He demanded to have sex.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  This is mainstream admitted with three women a day,
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  and he demanded that he never wash,
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  and he liked to...
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  I'm not even going to say it, folks.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  Just these people are pit of hell worms.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  What is it you don't understand?
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  Psychopaths get control of governments,
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  and then they set up a wonderland
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  so they can have their way with us.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  Go ahead, man.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  And you know what happened in Tibet,
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  how they destroyed Tibet?
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  I mean, by no means was it a paradise
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  before the Chinese invaded,
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  but when they did invade,
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  since, you know, the 50s, they've killed over a million.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  What they did was encourage Chinese people
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  to emigrate into Tibet.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  So now you've got a situation where there's 6 million Tibetans,
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  but there's 7.5 million ethnic Chinese,
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  and the consequence was that
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  it completely destroyed the economy.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  Inflation went through the roof,
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  and that's how they gained...
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  Which is what the globalists are doing
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  with Mexico and Latin America.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  Right.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  Stay there, man.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  Final segment with you.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Well, I have continual tracking of all this
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  at prisonplanet.com.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  I've got Bloomberg.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  I've got Reuters.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  I've got Fox.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  Chinese security in America.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  Chinese troops in America.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  Ruling the slaves.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  The pathetic scum that we have become.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases,
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  to bombs in the buildings,

[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.

[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  is not liberalism or conservatism,
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  but globalism.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  Globalists are concerned with what's good
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  for the American Empire,
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  instead of what's fair for the American people.
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  is nationalism,
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  which is why you should be reading

[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  commonly known as George Orwell,
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  said the great enemy of clear language
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  is insincerity.

[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  and disinfo that pervade society.
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  Have you noticed all areas of American civics
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  have slanted into usher in the
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  One World Nation state?

[1:53:57.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  I want to be peaceful,
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  but I'm tired of all these dirty bureaucrats
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  and the big banks that control them
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  and all their taxes to take our money
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  and make us slaves.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  And all the ways they poison us
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  and their dirty communists
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  and fascist command and control systems.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  And I want them to know
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  that they're going to be defeated.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  I hate this government
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  and I hate everybody that runs it.
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  And I hate the communists, Chinese.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  And I hate all the trash.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  And I want all of you to know
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  that we're going to beat them one day.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  A lot of us aren't going to make it through this.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  A lot of us aren't going to live through it.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  This is only the beginning.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  But I want you to wake up everybody you can.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  I know what they're planning.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  I've known their plan for a long time.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  I've seen right through them from the start.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  And everything they do
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  only confirms to me
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  that they're planning to wage war against us.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  Don't forget what you used to be.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  We used to be men.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  Let's get fired up.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  I've told you this many times
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  but you're not supposed to get mad about stupid football
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  and things that don't matter.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  You're supposed to get angry
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  about your country being overrun
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  by a bunch of enemies.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  Ah!
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  You're supposed to get angry about tyranny.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  That rage, that power you've got
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  is meant to defend your family.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  And let me tell you, this is the enemy.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  The enemy runs our government.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  The enemy! They're the enemy!
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  How dare them!
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  How dare them!
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  How dare them!
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  Say that in FBI manuals
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  that people that talk about the Constitution are terrorists
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  and the founding fathers were bad.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  You are the terrorist!
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  You are the enemy!
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  Ah!
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  I'm going to back Heaven Booth up to the bottom
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  in the next hour and we'll have him into the fourth hours.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  I'm going to let these guys on for about five, six more minutes.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  I appreciate it. I'm sorry I've blown up.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  I'm going to try to be more intellectual about this
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  but we're going to take 20 minutes of calls,
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  30 minutes of calls next hour,
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  both at 1-800-259-9231
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  but also,
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  an iPhone number system here where I can air calls
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  and we'll give that number out in a moment
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  but specifically only on this.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  Okay?
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  Here's AP right now
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  and members were picked from special police units
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  of the People's Armed Police,
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  China's Internal Security Force,
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  those are the torturers, the murderers, the scum,
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  the requirements for the job to be tall, handsome,
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  mighty and exceptional physical conditions
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  similar to that of professional athletes,
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  the state-run Chinese New Service said.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  And this right now,
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  and it shows video of them tackling
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  and choking people
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  and attacking and arresting Europeans.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  Good God!
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  What have we turned into?
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  They're just showing it to you,
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  seeing what you'll do, testing you right now.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  Steve, Paul, are you angry like I am
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  and do you agree that this is a test,
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  a conditioning mechanism?
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  Yeah, I'm outraged.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  The thing that worries me about it is
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  that Olympic torch,
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  which let's face it,
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  it's just become a symbol of outright tyranny.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  It should be extinguished now.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  It's going to go through Tibet on June 19th.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  Chinese government's got 250,000
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  hardcore PLA killers
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  stationed in that area.
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  And I mean, people are going to die.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  There's going to be massive riots.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  So they need to cancel this ridiculous procession now
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  to save any more grief.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  They won't cancel it because
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  it's not about the Olympic torch, is it?
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  The Olympic torch is just a tool
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  to get media attention.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  Well, it's ancient Greek eugenics.
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  They would have the huge eugenics contestant,
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:01.000]  who the Superman, or who was closer to the gods,
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  who was half god, like Hercules,
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  and they would pick their Herculium for the year.
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  And then Hitler picked up on it
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:11.000]  and drew the circles and the rings
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  and all the rest of it, and now we have it,
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  and now we worship it, and it is now a celebration.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  The real Olympics is happening now.
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  It's about the police and the corrupt military
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  and foreign troops dominating Europe,
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  stomping all over the Tibetans,
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  stomping all over San Francisco,
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  punching Americans right in the face.
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  It is a big idea.
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  A new world order.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  by a powerful world government.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  their great dream of exterminating
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  For the first time in history,
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  the elite's plan for world government
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  is blown wide open.
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  You will learn the secret that drives
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  the entire new world order agenda.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  toward a world government.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  Most people have no idea.
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  They're not after money.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  They have all the money they need.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  They're after power.

[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  Government cover-ups.
[1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  You want answers?
[1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:00.000]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:02.000]  He's Alex Jones
[2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:04.000]  on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:06.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:08.000]  Alex Jones.
[2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:10.000]  Kevin Booth's gonna be with us
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:12.000]  for 30 minutes in this hour.
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  And then the full fourth hour
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:16.000]  of this new film, American Drug War,
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  the Nexus is In, was just on
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  Showtime. It just came out on DVD
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  with three hours of extras.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  It's really like five films.
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  It's 2495 at infowars.com.
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  That's your attack pattern right there.
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  Get that film. Get it out to everybody.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  In closing, guys,
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  I appreciate you coming on from
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  England and Sheffield. You've talked to
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  your personal friends, not just the newscast
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  admitting Chinese paramilitary secret police,
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  the folks that execute people, take them
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  to their deaths for political speech,
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  beating people up in England
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  on video, on the news, in France.
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  Now they're in San Francisco marching today.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  We have got to get
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  all of our listeners in San Francisco to
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  peacefully go out there and videotape
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  these terrorists. Steve,
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  and then for two minutes, then Paul, for two minutes
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  in closing.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  What goals means?
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  The media is framing it all as a sovereignty
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  issue, which it's not.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  It's about complete abuse of human
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  rights and killing over a million
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  Tibetans, you know, and turning
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  parts of their country into gulags.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  That's what it's about. But Steve
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  was saying to me earlier that he
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  heard a BBC radio
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  discussion where they were starting
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  to defend the Chinese.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  Maybe you can tell you about that.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  Well, yeah, basically
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  that's what we were saying before. They weren't
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  separating the Chinese people
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  from the Chinese government, and the debate
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  this morning, the big debate on the BBC
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  was, is there too
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  much China bashing going on now?
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  China, you know,
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  it's looking after its people. Maybe we should
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  stop getting on the back of the Chinese.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  But, you know,
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  that's just framing the debate
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  when it's not about...
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  Well, just as Hitler used the 36 Olympics
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  to make, you know,
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  all the systems of Nazi Germany
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  become rock star
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  popular even in the US
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  and England and worldwide,
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  I went to the grocery store last night, the whole
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  foods, and there were two big magazines
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  separate with big red flags
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  and communist stars on the front.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  I was too busy trying to get home. I should
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  have bought them and talked about them. But two magazines
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  saying, get off China's back. China's good.
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  I mean, this is all about training us
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  that their system's good.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  Dennis, I mean, these
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  Olympic officials look absolutely
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  ridiculous when they say
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  no, the torch procession's going to continue.
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  We're not going to cancel it because
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  the Olympics is not political.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  It's always been political.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  It makes them look absolutely ridiculous
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  when they say that.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  And then you've got the media
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  asking pointless questions like
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  are the Olympics being
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  used as a tool just purely
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  to attack China?
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  Well, yeah, they are because China's
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  an oppressive, tyrannical regime
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  and, you know, protesters are going to
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  use anything like that to
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  attack it.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  Well, I went
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  into histrionics because
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  every time I think I can't be any more freaked
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  out, we knew this was coming. We knew this would happen.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  The
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  Olympics are totally wicked. I'm boycotting
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  them. I'm not watching any of it.
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  Everyone else should boycott it. Watch none
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  of it. If you see a newscast
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  about it, turn it off.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  Buy none of it.
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  Let the sponsors that are sponsoring it know
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  you're boycotting them. I'm serious
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  because
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  they're doing all this on purpose. The social
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  engineers, the
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  behavioral psychologist,
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  there is no doubt all the continuing
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  coverage will be at prisonplanet.com
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  and infowars.com.
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  Guys, I'm just sorry that you have to watch your own
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  Britain's being beat up by Chinese secret police.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  I mean, these are literal death police
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  and I bet money they're going to beat up people
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  in San Francisco.
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  It's a setup.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  They come over to peaceful people, grab
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  their signs, grab their placards,
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  foreign troops violating free speech
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  in England and I guarantee it's going on
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  in the U.S. because our cops do it every day.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  I mean, did you ever think you'd live to see this,
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  Stephen Paul?
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  Well, it doesn't surprise me really.
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  I just hope that other countries
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  will follow the example of the Australians
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  and kick these thugs out of the
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  country because they shouldn't be there.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  It's completely illegal.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  I want the listeners to go completely ape.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  The best article that gives people the full
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  spectrum analysis of this long-term plan.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  They've got plans for Czechoslovakian
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  troops in the Midwest.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  They've got plans for British,
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  Dutch, Israeli on the east coast.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  They plan to use Latin American
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  from Florida to Texas,
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  Mexican troops. It's all now official.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  We will be ruled by foreign
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  mercs.
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  The forces of globalism are destroying
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  national sovereignty worldwide.
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  The first time in modern history,
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:06.000]  of the New World Order master plan.
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  and energize the people to meet this threat.

[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  paramilitary secret police, the ones that
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  torture and kill and murder people.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  They've beaten up Britons.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  They've beaten up French, Parisians.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  They are here, I guarantee
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  you, they're slugging and punching

[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  and pro-Tibet signs.
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  They are enemies.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  Many troops are in America
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  violating our First Amendment.

[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  Yes, sir. Well, hey, good to hear from you, Nate.
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  Good to hear from you.
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  I don't know if you know, but like about two and a half weeks
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  I went down to a Tibet rally
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  and I was standing out of the barricades
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  and they didn't like that so they handcuffed me
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  and took me down to the precinct.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  I heard you got arrested for videotaping
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  and I'm good friends with Nate and he's working on the new 9-11 film
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  with us and Nate does
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  special effects for some of the big TV studios
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  in New York and
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  I heard you got arrested from the folks at the office.
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  I heard you got put in handcuffs.
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  Yeah, I did.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  That's gonna arrest my friend.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  Yeah, it wasn't because I had the cameras
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  because I first said I didn't want to go in the barricade
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  and they said it was a problem because I was standing there
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  and they never answered my question.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  I said, I can walk around if the problem is me
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  not being in the barricade because there's no law.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  So they put me in cuffs
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  after they find out I have no ID
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  because I don't care about an ID.
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  In fact, I fly without an ID.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  Don't ask how I do it, but I do it.
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  And they pretty much said they were gonna put me in jail for that
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  and they were gonna be nice to me
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  and let me just give me a summons.
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  And then, oh yeah, and the Tibetans
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  So you were arrested?
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  They were gonna put me in prison.
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  They put me in for an hour.
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  Okay, so you were arrested.
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  I just want to make sure I was getting things straight there.
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  Nate, now this is a separate Tibetan deal
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  from them with the big metal poles.
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  The police saying it was unauthorized.
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  So in America now, oh, your poor Tibetans being exterminated.
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  Oh, you want to stand in front of the UN.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.000]  We're gonna beat you bloody
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  as you scream and beg peacefully.
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  I mean, it's all over, folks.
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  The country is gone.
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  If we don't recognize how deep it sunk,
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  we'll never get it back.
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  Anything else, Nate?
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  What do you think about the foreign troops?
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  Well, you know,
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  I'm not surprised anymore.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  Everything that I'm seeing is pretty much
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  what I've already read.
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  So I'm gonna be actually,
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  I'll be more surprised when things are turning around
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  because people are just so blind
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  that that'll be surprising to me more
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  than being surprised at this stuff happening.
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  I mean, you kind of agree to that
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  when you start seeing changes.
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  That's the surprise for me.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  Absolutely, Nate, great hearing from you
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  and the great work you do.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  Thank you for everything. Wonderful person.
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  Got to meet his brother here in Austin.
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  His brother lives in Austin.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  Nate came out of visiting him a few weeks ago
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  when he got to go out to dinner with him.
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  Who's up next here?
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  Michelle in Florida.
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  You're on the air. Worldwide transmission.
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  I have a great honor.
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  I turned 51 on Sunday
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  and I found your site on Sunday.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  I have listened to streaming
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  and radio to coast to coast for 15 years.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  Did not know you.
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  Found you through them.
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  I spent, from that moment,
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  any waking moment,
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  even typing reports, whatever I'm doing,
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  I have watched everything I can find
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  that's in your website.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  And I'm calling you to tell you
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  what I see clinically.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  Okay?
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  And you're saying,
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  get off your ass, do something.
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  Don't just sit there and watch this.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  And I'm like, what the hell can I do?
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  You open your mouth in my world,
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  I open my mouth up and I am crazy.
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  I can't.
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  It just doesn't work.
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  You don't like Chinese troops beating you in the street.
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  I can hand cards out and say,
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  just go here, go here, because I cannot open my mouth.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  That's a very effective thing to say,
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  here's a film, what do you think of it?
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  I had a colonel, a friend of mine,
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  watch two seconds of it
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  and call me up and told me,
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  you were an insane person and I'm crazy
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  and he's really worried about my mental health.
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  Well, let me tell you something,
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  my background is I created
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  a psychiatric institute with my ex-husband.
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  So I am my core training psychiatry.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  Well, I'd be crazy if I wasn't freaking out.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  That's right.
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  You're right.
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  But what you're talking about,
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  the basis of what is happening in society
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  in psychology 101, it is.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  But what can I do?
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  What can I do?
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  This is what I'm going to do.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  First of all, I thank you because that's the biggest
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  birthday present I have gotten
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  and I don't even know remember.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  Biggest present to meet you
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  and see this.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  Biggest present. Thank you so much.
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  Well, you're awesome and I appreciate your call.
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  Call me back. We have more time someday.
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  I'm not trying to be mean to the great callers.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  Right now, I'm flipping out.
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  That's what they do.
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  They go take a woman who's had more than one child
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  and they drown the baby. That's what they do. It's admitted.
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  They go and they take an old man who's fallen
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  gone and they take his organs.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  Or they torture him to death. They rape women.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  They rule. They are the blackest,
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  most evil Nazis,
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  Commies, whatever you want to call them,
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  you could imagine. They have more blood
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  than anyone on their hands.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  They're the longest standing black
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  sunshine death.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  I mean, they are the wickedness
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  and they are here.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  And again, these things start small.
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  This is a test by the enemy right now.
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  I see it exactly for what it is
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  and my hackles go up like a dog
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  that sees somebody sneaking into the perimeter
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  with their back low
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  and a stealth mow with a big pike
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  in their hand and I know it's the enemy
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  and I'm going crazy. I'm barking.
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  I mean, I'm growling and snapping.
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  I'm on the chain and I'm just
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  trying to warn people desperately.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  I know what they plan. I've videotaped
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  our own troops trying to kill us.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  God Almighty,
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  the dumb cop served the system
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  when the system puts poison in their water.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  Jay in Minnesota,
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  you're on the air.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  Hi, Alex. I just really want to personally
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  thank you for all the ammunition that you've
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  given me over the years. I've never called you.
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  I've been handing out 9-11 DVDs
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  since the one-year anniversary.
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  I know Linda Honeycutt.
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  I drove her around for the first month,
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  but he funded us. I had to get the truck
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  to go driving to support my family.
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  I just wanted to comment on this part
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  about Sean Hannity saying that al-Qaeda
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  are all around us.
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  If our government created al-Qaeda
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  and the people that attacked us on 9-11
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  as al-Qaeda, that is a true statement.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  Al-Qaeda is all around us.
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  They're in Fox News. They're in CNN.
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  They're anybody that's ever tried to cover this up.
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  That's the incredible thing.
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  They are al-Qaeda.
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:08.000]  They are LCI-ADA.
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:10.000]  They say al-Qaeda attacked to get your freedom.
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  It's all a sick lawyer joke.
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  They love to hide it in plain view,
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:16.000]  and it's true. They are al-Qaeda,
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  and they are attacking, and they are all around us.
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  Yeah. Well, I've handed out
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  over 7,000 DVDs.
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  I've got an 8-hour DVD with
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  Freedom to Fascism,
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  Loose Change,
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  9-11 Mysteries, 9-11
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  High Witness Hoboken TV, and Terror Storm.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:34.000]  I've handed out over 7,000 of those DVDs.
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  I drive around in my truck, and I talk to everybody.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  They call me crazy. That's right,
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  and nothing can stop you.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  If we all do this, it's over.
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  Let me just say hi to my friends
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  in this movement, man.
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  I know you guys miss me.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  We've got to jump. Have you noticed?
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  No one but Nate, and he was halfway
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  on subject, calling about the foreign trips.
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  You see how we've been conditioned?
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  I never asked you to call in on subject.
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  Every other show does. I'm sweetly asking,
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  does anybody even care?
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:04.000]  Have we fallen this far?
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  I'm going to take a call off my system.
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Allison and Austin.
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  Do you care about foreign death troops
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  marching all over the West, beating up
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  whoever they want?
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  I do. I do. I've been informed
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  by some troopers
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  that I know that there's over
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  20,000 Chinese troops
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  training off the coast of Baja, California.
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  Yeah, that's right.
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  Our government gave them former bases
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  all over the Caribbean,
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  and they've moved in a huge troop.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  I mean, just tens of thousands of troops,
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  our government gave them the Panama Canal.
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  They are to rule with an iron rod
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  over the scum America.
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  And, you know, my father always tells me,
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  you need to start learning Chinese
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  because that's just going to be coming home at night.
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:48.000]  Well, that's right.
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  That's part of the larger plan. There's 40.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  There's 40 million. I said 30 in the film.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  There's 40 million more young Chinese men
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:56.000]  than women, and they're told,
[2:17:56.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  your women are in America. You will rule them.
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:00.000]  I'm not kidding.
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  You can't make, and you say,
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  you're being told this by state troopers. See, they know.
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  They're let in on this.
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  And you watch most of them. We'll go along with it
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  and we'll serve it just to be in power
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:12.000]  and just like in England and just like in France
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  and just like in San Francisco,
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:16.000]  they will be commanded by them. Go ahead.
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  But I mean, what,
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  why don't we do it?
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  Because we're scum. We're scum.
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  We killed 50 million babies.
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  We're scum. We're filth.
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  We're trash.
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  Only weak scum
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  would let this happen.
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  Me freaking out is normal.
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:36.000]  I can't handle it anymore.
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  I can't.
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  I'm pissed off, man.
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  I'm yelling and screaming so I don't get violent.
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  They're the ones who put their babies in the street
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  when they're girls and whatnot.
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:48.000]  Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  But we're the
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  scum. I'm confused.
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  So, so, so you've got family that are state troopers
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:56.000]  that are telling you this?
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  No, no, no, like a trooper, like a, like an army guy.
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  No, some random guy in a store.
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  Okay.
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  But it's in an army surplus store and he just started talking about it.
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  He's worried.
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  It's all over. This is the scum.
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  How long do you think we have?
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  Years.
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  They're just going to slowly keep doing it and keep,
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  oh, the firing officers here is a liaison.
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  Oh, he's helping with the security.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:20.000]  It's just like they have Marines
[2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:22.000]  out and call it a drill and then suddenly
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  they're pulling real families over.
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  Or the
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  Ukrainians in Scotland
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  just putting guns to people's heads.
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  It's in BBC. We have all the articles.
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  It's all scientific, behavioral psychology,
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  enemy attack.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  And somehow I'm immune to it. It just drives me crazy, though.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  It is a big idea.
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:52.000]  A new world order
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  in the near future.
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:56.000]  Earth is dominated by a powerful
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  world government.
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  It's known as the builder bird.
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:02.000]  Is that their objective being world domination?
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:04.000]  For thousands of years
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  their dark order grew.
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:08.000]  Now as they hail the birth
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:10.000]  of the new world order, their great
[2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:12.000]  dream of exterminating
[2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:18.000]  For the first time in history,
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:20.000]  the elite's plan for world

[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  toward a world government. Most people have no idea.
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  They're after power. That's their after-easy.

[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  few years ago our congress
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  voted whether or not to give
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  china most favored nation trade
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  status and here in austin we have
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  a large
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  tibetan community so many of the people
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  marching that day were tibetans
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  and we were able to
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  beat congressman loy dogged in the
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  plaza on his way back from lunch
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  and confront him and we
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  begged and pleaded that he vote
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  against giving china
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  most favored nation trade
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  status and the tibetan people
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  that stood there with a translator
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  beseeching him and then
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  I yelling at him
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  failed to convince him the next
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  day and he voted to give
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  china most favored nation trade
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  status even though I had
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  reminded him that
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  china had invaded tibet

[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  we here in Pennsylvania
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  when the first foreign troops come in here for anything
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  we're actually gonna take them out
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  so
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  I know you're dead set against that
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  but I think the time is long past
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  it's time for America
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  for Americans to stand up and take the country back
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  and waiting for them to come to disarm us
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  to come to our homes is gonna be too late
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  all right I appreciate your call
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  you know we need to continue
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  the video of them beating up
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  and you know Americans
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  other people brett's
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  that will wake up the population too
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  then we need to try to fix it politically
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  I think you should submit to Chinese troops
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  and let them take you and your family
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  and let them rape your children and kill you
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  okay I'm being sarcastic
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  no obviously ladies and gentlemen
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  Alessington and Concord's coming
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  they want to start the fight they're gonna push it
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  they're not gonna stop they mean for the first waves of police
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  and military to be chewed up by us
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  and then they're gonna use foreign troops
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  get a pretty union ready for folks
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  get it queued up John doing a fabulous job
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  let's go ahead
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  and take another call let's go ahead
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  and talk to Sam in Virginia
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  hello Alex
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  hello
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  hey yes I'm outraged about the troops
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  too and
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  I've been glad to join you in the fight
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  it's when our
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  you know our primary came up
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  I was out there voting for Ron Paul
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  good now it's literature
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  you know about exposing a lot of this stuff
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  but the most
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  important thing I've emailed out for people
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  and all this is spelled out
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  South and North American Union by Danny and G. Peterson
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  PHD
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  Trees in the Bound
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  Government Cabal Plot North American Union
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  they talk about that in this text post
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  I downloaded it all from
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  well let me be clear let me be clear
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  they've signed deals, used Canadian and Mexican troops
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  against the American people for insurrection
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  Bush has gotten a deposit comment on this
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  I've been training Chinese troops for this
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  I didn't just say this today
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  this is meant as a test
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  first they put troops in the Super Bowl
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  then they put them on the streets
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  then they put foreign troops in events
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  then they put them on the streets
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  this is done on purpose go ahead
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  yes sir
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  anyway I
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  came to know about Granny Warrior
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  because I put out info wanting to find out about
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:12.000]  you know the
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  freedom march in Washington DC
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:16.000]  sure what about them
[2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  I mean I got my listeners to send them money for the recount
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  in New Hampshire can I do more
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  what can we do
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  well
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:26.000]  I wish you could come but other than that
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:28.000]  I don't think people are waking up
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  well I'll let Davey have the show
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  and do the rest of his stuff there but I hear you
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:34.000]  I'm promoting it and that won't be enough for people to understand
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:36.000]  because I'm bad I'm evil
[2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:40.000]  we're on the march
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  the Empire's on the run
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  doctors around the world claim that
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:52.000]  cancer and other diseases cannot live
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:54.000]  in a pH balanced alkaline environment
[2:29:54.000 --> 2:29:56.000]  but as you know most people are overly
[2:29:56.000 --> 2:29:58.000]  acidic due to stress acidic diet
[2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  and lack of exercise pH
[2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:02.000]  balance is the foundation of energy abundance
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:04.000]  and perfect health as well as prevention
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:06.000]  of disease people who alkalize
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:08.000]  the water they drink experience normalized
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:10.000]  blood sugar mental clarity and loss
[2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:12.000]  of weight it was intended for human
[2:30:12.000 --> 2:30:14.000]  beings to drink alkaline water but due
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  to modern way of life most people are
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:18.000]  overly acidic the fact is that disease
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:20.000]  simply cannot exist in an alkaline
[2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:22.000]  environment fat accumulates if a person
[2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:24.000]  consumes too much acid on a regular basis
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:26.000]  and doesn't neutralize it do your part
[2:30:26.000 --> 2:30:28.000]  alkalize and supercharge your body

[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:34.000]  salt concentrate that raises the pH
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:36.000]  of the water you drink up to the pH

[2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:48.000]  following a disputed election
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:50.000]  and a tie vote
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:52.000]  the US Congress
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:54.000]  installs the most unpopular president
[2:32:54.000 --> 2:32:56.000]  in US history
[2:32:56.000 --> 2:32:58.000]  as David Jefferson Adams
[2:32:58.000 --> 2:33:00.000]  becomes the 44th president
[2:33:00.000 --> 2:33:02.000]  of the United States
[2:33:02.000 --> 2:33:04.000]  shortly after the election
[2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:06.000]  increased unrest, rioting and a growing
[2:33:06.000 --> 2:33:08.000]  number of militias have given rise
[2:33:08.000 --> 2:33:10.000]  to ever increasing domestic terrorism
[2:33:10.000 --> 2:33:12.000]  in response
[2:33:12.000 --> 2:33:14.000]  the president invokes the homeland security act
[2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:16.000]  and declares martial law
[2:33:16.000 --> 2:33:18.000]  on the west coast and other areas of the country
[2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:20.000]  though highly contested
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:22.000]  a supreme court ruling
[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:24.000]  sidesteps the electoral process
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  disqualifying popular presidential candidates
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:28.000]  from several states
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:30.000]  public outrage explodes
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:32.000]  when a sham election leads to incumbent
[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:34.000]  David Adams accepting
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:36.000]  a second term in office
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:40.000]  during the 57th inauguration day
[2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  ceremonies, Washington DC
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  is struck by a low yield nuclear
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  weapon killing David Adams
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  and most of the US Congress
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:52.000]  the destruction of Washington DC
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:54.000]  effectively breaks the chain of succession
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:56.000]  sending the nation into chaos
[2:33:56.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  in an emergency vote
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:00.000]  the European Union deploys
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:02.000]  peacekeepers in the greater DC
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  area to secure international
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:06.000]  interests
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:08.000]  with separatist sentiment rising
[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  California's governor
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:12.000]  declares home rule
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:14.000]  and secedes from the Union
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  Texas follows quickly
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:18.000]  and declares sovereignty
[2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:20.000]  taking neighboring states with them
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  and forming the Republic of Texas
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  the once united states of America
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  lie in ruin
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  the time for words has passed
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  and the second American Civil War
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:38.000]  now erupts as seven factions
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  wage war across the land
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:44.000]  they battle one another to reclaim
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  a nation
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  to restore peace
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:50.000]  to rebuild this
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  shattered Union
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  foreign Chinese troops
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  beating up British on national TV
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  beating up French
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  grabbing Tibetans not allowing people
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  to have signs against them
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  now in San Francisco ruling commanding
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:20.000]  having their way with American citizens
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  it's not enough to have our own police
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  violating the First Amendment
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  they've got to have foreign chai comm
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  secret police murderers doing it
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:32.000]  truth is stranger than fiction
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  we are live
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:40.000]  about 25 minutes left in this third hour
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:42.000]  of transmission
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:44.000]  but we will be live into a new

[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  and blasting out over the network here
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  Kevin Booth is going to be with us
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  in about five minutes from his award winning film
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  video streaming it
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  over the radio show in this hour
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  and we'll come back for 55 minutes with Kevin
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  playing audio clips from the film
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  we're selling it at infowars.com
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  and I hope you get it
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  Kevin used to live in Austin
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  Bill Hicks is producer
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  and I made a few films like Marshall Law
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  with Kevin
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  and he has worked four plus years
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  on American drug war it is a masterpiece
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  the DVD
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  it has three hours of extra bonus
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  footage on it
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:26.000]  and I'll be showing folks
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  screenshots of that with our
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  video cam win the fourth hour
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  which is also a video cast starts

[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  the video cam on me
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  the document cam the video clips are going to play
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  but for everybody else you get the audio
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:42.000]  for free at infowars.com
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  Kevin Booth
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:46.000]  thank you for coming
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  on 30 minutes late
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  your issue is so important
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  but we got an hour and a half still
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  I knew you'd be okay with
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  these
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  troops beating up British
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  and French now they're here in America
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  have you heard about this?
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  definitely I even have a cousin that was
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:06.000]  just over in Tibet recently
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  protesting
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:10.000]  definitely well aware of it
[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  I think one of the things that's important to talk about
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  you know
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  kind of transition into this segment
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  is how the drug war
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  and not even so much about preparing
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  the American people for the war on terror
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  but preparing our military
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  and our police forces
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:28.000]  and for the last 30 years they've all been
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  said just like drugs are bad drugs are bad
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  well let's just stop let's just stop and first
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  talk about your film how big it is
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  how many awards it got
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  this is a major film it aired on
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  showtime critically acclaimed
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  right it's going to be
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  it's going to be playing on and off
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  the first month on showtime in the month of March
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  I believe they played it like 50 times
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  and
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  crazy like every time I turned on the TV
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:54.000]  it was playing on some other showtime channel
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:56.000]  so pretty sure a lot of people
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  saw it and
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  I was at the gym and I heard people talking about it last week
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  yeah and it'll be playing
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  on and off for two years actually
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  through showtime
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  in fact Kev when I'm at the gym
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  and hearing people talk about it
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  so far everybody that's in it
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:14.000]  has been bombarded
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:16.000]  by phone calls and emails
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  one of which is a little upsetting
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  I don't know if you know this but Stella Castillo
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  was arrested by
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  I've been trying to get a hold of him
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  they didn't like him being in the film and exposing
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  government drug dealing
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  when they were handcuffing him they said
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  saw you on TV last night
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  let's be clear
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  Army Sniper
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  Police Officer
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  Border Patrol Agent
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  Head DEA Agent Latin America Exposed
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  Elepango Drug Dealing put it in your film
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  and they went and arrested him right after it aired
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:48.000]  they said hey punk that's your free country go ahead
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  yeah but now they made it for
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  some little gun charge but now he's facing
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  five years in federal prison
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  hey can you try to get him on the next few days
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  I keep calling his cell phone
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:00.000]  and I can't ever get a hold of him where is he
[2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  he's around you know he's
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  occasionally answers my phone call
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  yeah we've been trying and I know
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:08.000]  I've pretty much brought Sally to the audience here
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  years ago like ten years ago
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:12.000]  we need to get a hold of Sally
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  in fact I have my producer set him up
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  he called me last night because
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:18.000]  Bill Maher
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  Eastside Morales
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  a famous actor
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  mentioned American drug war
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  on the Bill Maher show Friday night
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  and of course Bill Maher
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  shot it down as conspiracy theory
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  yeah I met Morales when I was out in LA
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  he's a he's on board
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  yeah I'd like to get him a DVD
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  but then
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  Bill O'Reilly picked up on the story
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  and called Morales the pinhead of the day
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  or whatever and played the clip
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  of Morales like talking about American
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  drug war and that was just two nights ago
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  so Sally called me to tell me about that
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  poor Sally and so much is going on
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  how obvious is it
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  that weeks after it starts airing every day
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  they come and rate him claiming
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:00.000]  he had a clip that was too big or something
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  when he's been in the military, police
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  everything
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  yeah it's just a
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  country of evil man it's all over
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  yeah and the drug war
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  what's important with how we've got to this
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:14.000]  day is that the drug war
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  has really
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:18.000]  dumbed down our police and our military
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:20.000]  not that they're dumb people, they're smart people
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  they're just trying to do the right thing
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  but the people
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  higher up in the government have been very
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:28.000]  brilliant on
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  destensitizing everybody with
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  the concept of drugs being evil
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  for 30 plus years especially
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  starting with Nixon
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  and now that they've kind of just
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  flipped the game on everybody and said
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:42.000]  now it's terror and they replaced drugs with terror
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  and it's really the same exact agenda
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  but now everybody's just
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  and the real terror is the guys in armored vehicles
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  with black masks running checkpoints
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  right and the drug war really
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  starts back to the what's the first thing
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  that they need to do well the government needs to
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  basically
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  tell everybody that this herb that's grown
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  naturally here for thousands of years
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:04.000]  the herbs that have been used
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:06.000]  medicinally
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  without causing cancer for thousands of years
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  they're bad for you but you've got to buy
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  things that are only made in a
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  laboratory and let's go through that first
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  you go through the numbers the hundreds of thousands
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  that die from prescription drugs
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  no one dies from pot
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  hundreds of thousands die from alcohol
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  I mean you get into all of it and then you've got
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  three hours of extras
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  and let's go ahead now and just play a
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  clip here
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  this is
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  General Barry McCaffrey years ago
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  where I confronted him in Austin
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  when his head guy
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  got caught
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  engaging in all of these
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  different activities in fact
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  John do you have that general McCaffrey clip
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  I forgot
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  let's go ahead and roll this is where I'm confronting
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:52.000]  General Barry McCaffrey
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  in Austin Texas when his head commander
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  was caught shipping in masses of heroin and cocaine
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  from Reuters and he used a psych warfare
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:00.000]  op and started talking about babies the baby
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  the baby
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  I mean very skilled that they all go for
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  baseline instinct buttons
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  they push here it is
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  in 1999 I confronted
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  Bill Clinton's drug czar
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  Bill Clinton had told the American people
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  that he was going to cut back on the size
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  of the drug war and was going to stop putting
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  nonviolent offenders behind bars
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  he did the exact opposite
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  he hired McCaffrey
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  who went out there and began
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  brutally attacking the American people
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  and federally funding SWAT teams
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  to kick down thousands of doors a month
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  in search of narcotics
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  McCaffrey wasn't pleased
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  that his head
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:40.000]  of anti-narcotics operations
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  for all of Latin America
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  got caught shipping in heroin
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  and cocaine to New York
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  when I confronted him he tried to brush it off
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  General McCaffrey
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:52.000]  Alex Jones from KJFK Radio
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  in Austin Texas
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:56.000]  I fully agree with you on the scourge of narcotics
[2:42:56.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  and their destructive consequences
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:00.000]  on the human brain
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:02.000]  but something I find
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:04.000]  interesting is the massive evidence
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:06.000]  coming out in the past
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  of our own government and other international
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:10.000]  organizations involved in drug smuggling
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:12.000]  in fact two days ago
[2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  you called Columbia an emergency situation
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  you're calling for a billion dollars and more funding
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:18.000]  well your head of counter
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  narcotics and drug operations
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  in Columbia his wife was just caught
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:24.000]  shipping in masses of cocaine into the United States
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  this is from the Washington Post sir
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  also have Reuters right here on it
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  yes that's my question
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:32.000]  I just wanted to state my facts because you know we're in this world
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  where you ask a serious question you're a cuck
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  let's talk about the drug running of this government
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  last time I wrote that question was the first
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:48.000]  press conference I had in Washington
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  was an older reporter
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:52.000]  and I said
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  I don't know
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:56.000]  I've been serving the country
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  for 32 years
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:00.000]  I'm not running any drugs
[2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:02.000]  the baby
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:04.000]  is 21 years old now
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:06.000]  okay I can't hear
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  any more of this
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:10.000]  go ahead
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  your comments
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:14.000]  Kevin
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  oh you know it's just so classic
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:18.000]  you know we had to skip over this thing
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:20.000]  but yeah they're just
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:22.000]  such pros like flipping it
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:24.000]  as if
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  like this one child
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  that had been addicted to heroin
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:30.000]  and had to have his arm cut off
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:32.000]  that somehow justifies what they did
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  for some weird reasons
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  you're just supposed to forget about the question
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  I mean
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  you know they're pros
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:42.000]  one of my favorite quotes in the film is
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  this woman Calvina Faye
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:46.000]  who's with the partnership for a drug free America
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  and she's one of the
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:50.000]  mad mother types and all that
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  and she's like really outspoken pro drug war
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:54.000]  and
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:56.000]  her whole thing when they're talking about the legalization
[2:44:56.000 --> 2:44:58.000]  of medical marijuana
[2:44:58.000 --> 2:45:00.000]  it's like going
[2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:02.000]  you know
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:04.000]  choose like going of course it works
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  you know of course that's what medicines do
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:08.000]  but does it do anything for you in the end
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:10.000]  it's just like this logic
[2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:12.000]  and it's okay to be on a bunch of pros
[2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  that can go to a psychotic break and shoot a bunch of people
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:16.000]  or the 300 plus thousand
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  of drug interactions every year
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  but marijuana with nothing now we gotta get it
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:22.000]  well and not only that but their logic is
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  it's like well
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:26.000]  people have medical marijuana they're just gonna get high
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:28.000]  I've got news for you I can walk into a pharmacy
[2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:30.000]  and get high off of everything that they sell there
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  you know
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  I mean it all gets you high
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  well the point is you talk about the film
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  and it is very well done, very poignant
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  how alcohol killed basically both your parents
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  yeah definitely
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  now I mean it's just outrageous to me
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:46.000]  that here in California
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  I can walk into the Ralph's grocery store
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  with a shopping cart
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:52.000]  I can fill it with Jack Daniels
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  and Tequila and Marlboro Cigarettes
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  with a giant prescription of Prozac
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  and I could walk out and I could have enough
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  drugs alcohol and cigarettes
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:02.000]  to probably kill 100 people
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:04.000]  that's legal
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  but a friend of mine gets arrested
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  for growing a couple of marijuana plants
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  goes to a prison work camp
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  well that's what it's all about and then the big drug cartels
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  just like Tony Montana says
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  in Scarface and they did years of research
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  to make that film
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  you know that's where he says it's the banks they're the ones
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  they've been running in a thousand years
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  from now he's got to go launder his money with them
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  and that's the small time
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  most of the drugs are directly brought in
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  by the government and then they own
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  the private prisons
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  yeah absolutely
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  now you got Tommy Chong in the film talking about how he smoked pot
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  with Arnold Schwarzenegger
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  you got everything in this movie man this is quite a film Kevin
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  thank you
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  you have done well
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  before a green card
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:48.000]  I'm going to carve them up real nice
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  yeah he gave me a green card
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  I'm carving them up real nice
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  hey fly look at Pelican fly Pelican
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:56.000]  you know I don't know if you
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  saw that
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:00.000]  a 60 minutes piece a while back
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:02.000]  where they were talking about this Bayer drug
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:04.000]  I'm not going to pronounce it right but
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:06.000]  Tyra doll or Tyra doll or something like that
[2:47:06.000 --> 2:47:08.000]  this drug that they give people during heart surgery
[2:47:08.000 --> 2:47:10.000]  it's proven to kill
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:12.000]  thousands of people a month
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:14.000]  and they've known it and the FDA
[2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  has known it and Bayer has known it
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:18.000]  well look Bayer is a eugenics front
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  millions hundreds of thousands
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:22.000]  of Americans alone died when they knew
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:24.000]  for a decade that every shot of factor 8
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  had AIDS in it and hepatitis
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:28.000]  and their internal memos came out where they just said sell it all
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  and keep letting AIDS be in it
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  so you know I mean
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  but like you were talking earlier I mean this is
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  you know I think one of like the bigger jobs
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  right now is we've
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  we've got to wake up the police
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  you know we've got to wake up you know
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  it's one thing we you know preaching to the choir
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  but the next level is to
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  start
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  getting people who are in charge one by one
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  and that's what's so interesting about drugs
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  or the topic of marijuana especially
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:56.000]  because when you get a policeman
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  alone
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  and you talk to them about marijuana they're always
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  going to go like I know it's not
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  that bad you know what I mean just like well just
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  between me and you I know it's not that bad
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  and then you put them all back in their pack
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  and they're like you know arrest them get them
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  well the cops I've known are the
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  are pot smoking beer drinking
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  party animals of course they are
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  I mean look here they're average DEA
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  agent you know it's like a classic
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  bug
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  you know god love them
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  but you know it's all over
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  but they need to look they did this
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  scientifically they built the police
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  state they even passed laws at the state level
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  lobby by the feds where states can't give
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  the forfeiture money to the cops
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  but then if they give it to the feds they get
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  85% back which made them federal
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  minions
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  and I've pulled up to a checkpoint where they're pulling everybody
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  out of their car and they go we want to search for drugs
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  I start laughing at them I'm like I don't use
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  the crap you ship in leave me alone
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  man yeah I'm just
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  I'm just tired of it and talking about the Chinese
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  thank you I'm sure you probably have spoken about this
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:58.000]  but the fact that the forest service
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  is buying Chinese
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  drones
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  they're going to be you know
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  I guess flying around probably searching for pot
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  grows you know no no no that was in the news
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  a couple weeks ago they said all over the country
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  forest service cities
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  pilots drones 24-7
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:16.000]  flying around looking for pot and remember the case
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  in Austin I should have given this to you for the film
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  the lady who had the blood weed that's in every
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  yard in Texas in the summer and they
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  swat teamer and then kick the dog and attack her
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  and then they she had a renter in a house
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  behind her they took out a playboy and made fun of him
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  it's so crazy
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  I happen to forget that there's a plant that grows
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  that looks just like pot I mean I've seen it
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  ever since I was a little kid
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  they love the blood they love the blood weed that's their excuse
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  to go on the property yeah that's a good point
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  that's a good point but
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  you know this drone thing here in Southern California
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  just with the other day it's crazy I mean
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  we get buzzed by helicopters
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  here all the time and you'll
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  you know always just be standing around you'll see
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  a helicopter
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  doing these like tight circles over this area and I know
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  a lot of times they've got like these cameras
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  and scopes where they're looking for growth
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  and so
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  and I was watching that just the other day like practically
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  like a little bit over my house just going
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  kind of think of all the fuel
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  and manpower that that's eating up and then just
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  they go okay they're going to replace me
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  meanwhile my house gets broken into my car gets stolen
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  and the Austin cops won't even come out
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  yep yep that's classic
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  have you seen
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  have you seen like what Bill O'Reilly was like saying about
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  to Snoop Dogg on a show
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  I've been watching some more Bill O'Reilly close on YouTube
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  but he was just basically Bill O'Reilly's on there
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  telling everybody that they belong in prison
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  and that they need to build more prisons
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  we got more people in prison than any other country
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  land of the coward, some of the slaves
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  we want scum, we got it
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  and I'm sorry folks we have to admit what we've turned into
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  we'll be right back here on the Scum Channel
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:50.000]  it is a big idea
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  a new world order
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  in the near future
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  it's known as
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  the Bilderberg
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  but their objective being world domination
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  for thousands of years
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  their dark order grew
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  now as they hail the birth
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  of the new world order
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  their great dream of exterminating
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  80% of humanity is at hand
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  for the first time in history
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  the elites plan for world government
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  is blown wide open

[2:55:45.240 --> 2:55:49.400]  to start in about four minutes. Before I do that, a few sponsors that we need to mention
[2:55:49.400 --> 2:55:55.800]  because they make this transmission possible. The first one is Aloe's. And ladies and gentlemen,
