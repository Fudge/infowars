[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.300]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.300 --> 00:30.440]  Texas Alex Jones day one of Bilderberg 2012 and it's the Alex Jones show my
[00:30.440 --> 00:34.720]  name's Paul Joseph Watson and I'll be filling in for the first half of the show
[00:34.720 --> 00:40.400]  because as you know Alex Jones and crew are live at the crime scene of Bilderberg
[00:40.400 --> 00:45.840]  2012 where the criminals are now officially arriving it's day one we're
[00:45.840 --> 00:50.040]  going to be going to Alex and crew down there at Ground Zero in Chantilly
[00:50.040 --> 00:56.060]  Virginia very shortly in fact in the next segment but as you know unprecedented
[00:56.060 --> 01:01.020]  security you know machine gun nests mainstream media photographers being
[01:01.020 --> 01:06.140]  threatened with arrest they've set up a half mile security perimeter around the
[01:06.140 --> 01:12.140]  entire hotel and it's all for over 100 of the world's most influential people
[01:12.140 --> 01:18.100]  meeting in secret with barely a whisper from the establishment media judging by
[01:18.100 --> 01:23.240]  the tweets we've actually still got activists inside the Bilderberg hotel
[01:23.240 --> 01:27.180]  of course they received the letter the ones that were able to book and actually
[01:27.180 --> 01:32.180]  have their bookings fulfilled Alex Jones wasn't he was politely informed two
[01:32.180 --> 01:36.460]  days before and he wouldn't even be able to get inside the hotel but there
[01:36.460 --> 01:40.700]  are some activists who booked rooms in the days before the conference began
[01:40.700 --> 01:46.420]  received letters saying they would be kicked out at noon on Thursday and it's
[01:46.420 --> 01:50.620]  just coming up to that time now so last we heard about an hour ago there are
[01:50.620 --> 01:55.820]  still info warriors and activists inside the Bilderberg hotel so that could get
[01:55.820 --> 02:02.420]  very interesting indeed but of course again massive media blockade but it has
[02:02.420 --> 02:07.380]  thankfully been broken in the United States by the Washington Times which
[02:07.380 --> 02:12.660]  reports today security tighter than ever at Bilderberg conference Chantilly's
[02:12.660 --> 02:17.220]  Westfields Marriott Hotel is the site of an unprecedented security crackdown as
[02:17.220 --> 02:21.060]  the world's richest and most powerful arrived for the annual Bilderberg
[02:21.060 --> 02:25.900]  conference and it talks about hundreds of demonstrators arriving obviously we're
[02:25.900 --> 02:30.620]  expecting closer to a thousand at least over the course of the weekend which is
[02:30.620 --> 02:35.700]  when most of the activists will be arriving and it talks about again the
[02:35.700 --> 02:40.700]  half-mile perimeter around the hotel all non-built Bilderberg guests kicked out
[02:40.700 --> 02:44.980]  their hotel rooms they received the letter as I said and quote a photographer
[02:44.980 --> 02:48.620]  for the Washington Times was told by law enforcement Wednesday that any attempt
[02:48.620 --> 02:53.900]  to get close to the building would result in arrest so now mainstream media
[02:53.900 --> 02:58.340]  photographers trying to cover meeting of the global elite the most influential
[02:58.340 --> 03:03.580]  people on the planet are being threatened with arrest for doing so so the
[03:03.580 --> 03:08.780]  Washington Times is covering it how about the Washington Post you know
[03:08.780 --> 03:15.460]  financiers corporate heads NATO members the cream of academia media moguls the
[03:15.460 --> 03:20.500]  most sought-after technology gurus on the planet they're all at a clandestine
[03:20.500 --> 03:26.060]  meeting in the Washington Post backyard you'd expect the post to be covering it
[03:26.060 --> 03:31.420]  wouldn't you well not a whisper not a sentence not a single word from the
[03:31.420 --> 03:35.860]  Washington Post and of course what they normally do is report on the
[03:35.860 --> 03:39.460]  conference when it's over because they don't want to alert other media or the
[03:39.460 --> 03:44.820]  big media organizations to the fact that it started that it's going on because
[03:44.820 --> 03:49.140]  they want to keep it on lockdown for as long as possible which is why most of
[03:49.140 --> 03:53.220]  the big media reports if they're forced to make them will come out on the last
[03:53.220 --> 03:58.780]  day or after the conference has actually ended and why is the Washington Post so
[03:58.780 --> 04:04.980]  reluctant to report on the the global power with 120 big wigs in their own
[04:04.980 --> 04:08.540]  backyard well it's because the publisher of the Washington Post is none other
[04:08.540 --> 04:14.580]  than Don Graham who is you guessed it a regular Bilderberg member so that's why
[04:14.580 --> 04:18.420]  this morning you're reading about Bilderberg in the Washington Times but
[04:18.420 --> 04:26.580]  not in the Washington Post and again New York Times ABC CNN BBC absolutely
[04:26.580 --> 04:33.300]  nothing imagine if 120 movie stars baseball stars from any you know genre
[04:33.300 --> 04:37.780]  entertainment politics whatever if they were meeting you would get interest and
[04:37.780 --> 04:43.300]  we've got so far nothing there's been a daily mail report which was largely
[04:43.300 --> 04:48.660]  focusing on our report about the security couple of others but the
[04:48.660 --> 04:52.460]  Washington Times is the only media outlet in the United States to break the
[04:52.460 --> 04:56.420]  Bilderberg information blockade and we're gonna be live at the scene in
[04:56.420 --> 05:00.620]  Chantilly after this break with Alex Jones and crew so stay tuned this is
[05:00.620 --> 05:03.980]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[05:03.980 --> 05:07.940]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[05:07.940 --> 05:12.180]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[05:12.180 --> 05:16.460]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[05:16.460 --> 05:20.820]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[05:20.820 --> 05:24.900]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[05:24.900 --> 05:29.460]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.460 --> 05:33.580]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.580 --> 05:37.540]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[05:37.540 --> 05:41.380]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:41.380 --> 05:44.100]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from

[08:30.540 --> 08:35.100]  info wars crew live on the scene this is the first official day of Bilderberg
[08:35.100 --> 08:40.860]  the global elite are arriving in their showford limos and of course all the
[08:40.860 --> 08:46.300]  activists there for Occupy Bilderberg are gathering at the scene we're gonna have
[08:46.300 --> 08:50.900]  Alex Jones live coming up in about five or six minutes time we're gonna hear
[08:50.900 --> 08:55.980]  some bullhorning as the Bilderberg members arrive they're gonna get a big
[08:55.980 --> 09:00.420]  Alex Jones bullhorn right in their face
[09:02.020 --> 09:06.220]  then we've got reports coming in now that the police have started to harass
[09:06.220 --> 09:11.700]  Alex Jones last year in switzerland the police were pretty good but already
[09:11.700 --> 09:16.580]  reports of police harassing Alex Jones whether that's for using a recording
[09:16.580 --> 09:42.900]  device we'll find out going live to the video now
[09:42.900 --> 10:12.100]  okay ladies and gentlemen we are here right now we are about I don't know
[10:12.100 --> 10:15.900]  500 yards away from the protest and we're driving around looking for parking
[10:15.900 --> 10:20.020]  and saw one area said don't park over here so we drove on to another area
[10:20.020 --> 10:24.300]  officer I'm live on the air and I got over here instantly police were on us
[10:24.300 --> 10:27.500]  instantly and they may be getting ready to try to set us up with the trespassing
[10:27.500 --> 10:31.580]  charge not just a notice of it so so so well doesn't matter it's fine we'll win
[10:31.580 --> 10:36.140]  and we'll win in a lawsuit so I've tried to again the sergeant people didn't
[10:36.140 --> 10:39.940]  violate our First Amendment yesterday we're pressed driving around in here
[10:39.940 --> 10:43.820]  trying to find a place to park they came over the security guard said you can't
[10:43.820 --> 10:46.980]  park over here we're getting in the car to leave and now they're blocking us in
[10:46.980 --> 10:53.860]  escalating this now again network do you hear me are we good are we good okay
[10:53.860 --> 10:56.980]  so what we're gonna do is Richard you're gonna go yeah you're gonna go park at
[10:56.980 --> 11:00.540]  that public area you're gonna get a cab and come back over here I'll have this
[11:00.540 --> 11:06.260]  unit with me I'm going to get out but once we drive out get to the park no
[11:06.260 --> 11:10.060]  it's fine but we don't want to say where that's at everybody's gonna be there yeah
[11:10.060 --> 11:13.060]  anyways we're gonna go over there I'm gonna go stand over here on the sidewalk
[11:13.060 --> 11:16.260]  and we'll meet back up with you but we can't leave while we're blocked in by
[11:16.260 --> 11:21.340]  the squad car okay so again this is just ridiculous again ladies and gentlemen
[11:21.340 --> 11:25.820]  would have been over there to do the radio show right now again they do not
[11:25.820 --> 11:29.900]  want big protest over here so obviously all these big you know military
[11:29.900 --> 11:33.540]  industrial complex things fine with your tax money posing as a private grips
[11:33.540 --> 11:36.740]  do not want his parking in the parking lots that's fine we're gonna go find
[11:36.740 --> 11:41.100]  parking lots elsewhere but in the whole continuum of this stuff now we're
[11:41.100 --> 11:43.940]  blocked in here and I guess we'll probably wait all day for the Lordship
[11:43.940 --> 11:48.220]  security officer to show up here and give us a notice that they don't want us
[11:48.220 --> 11:51.140]  on this private property when again I saw the signs over there and thought oh
[11:51.140 --> 11:54.900]  that must be their property and I saw signs I'm gonna say it again I saw
[11:54.900 --> 11:58.820]  signs over there and I thought and I said to them I said well that must be
[11:58.820 --> 12:02.300]  owned by the Marriott they don't want us here I said let's go look and try to
[12:02.300 --> 12:06.140]  find some public parking this is a big giant complex and so that's what happened
[12:06.140 --> 12:10.180]  and that's what we're here doing and no I'm not lying no no I understand but I'm
[12:10.180 --> 12:13.180]  not I told you where I know officer but you're trying but there you are twisting
[12:13.180 --> 12:16.740]  it I told you earlier before you went live I said I saw the signs over there
[12:16.740 --> 12:21.420]  saying that private property don't well it didn't even say don't park it's a
[12:21.420 --> 12:24.340]  private property I thought well they must own that they also own another
[12:24.340 --> 12:28.540]  office park so I thought we'll come look for public parking over here now now
[12:28.540 --> 12:33.700]  we've been blocked in now we've been blocked in right here in America now
[12:33.700 --> 12:37.220]  now here you go ladies and gentlemen streaming live right here and look at

[15:05.340 --> 15:09.540]  trespassing thing and try was looking around for somewhere and then you guys
[15:09.540 --> 15:15.620]  were instantly honest yeah I know it's fine it's fantastic all right Paul
[15:15.620 --> 15:23.260]  Watson how long do we got a break here think we got about five minutes okay we
[15:23.260 --> 15:26.700]  got about five minutes here that just gives us time to see the big crowd up
[15:26.700 --> 15:32.100]  there why don't you guys go ahead of me and it'll be careful don't fall over
[15:32.100 --> 15:36.660]  anything at the last minute and let's get around the corner over there and show
[15:36.660 --> 15:41.380]  that big crowd of people already massing despite the fact that this big
[15:41.380 --> 15:45.180]  military industrial complex area certainly does not want to park in here
[15:45.180 --> 15:50.140]  they figured out that four years ago we parked in these big semi-empty parking
[15:50.140 --> 15:54.620]  lots over here and again if you could show people this is where I saw the
[15:54.620 --> 15:58.060]  signs saying private property so I thought hell it's okay to park over here
[15:58.060 --> 16:02.180]  so I didn't see notices over on that side
[16:02.180 --> 16:10.500]  anyways I thought we could find something around here oh I understand oh no I
[16:10.500 --> 16:13.900]  believe you I believe you I just didn't I just didn't understand that no I
[16:13.900 --> 16:20.460]  understand I think I was lying to you officer Alex yes yes yes Watson you were
[16:20.460 --> 16:26.020]  able to be in that location back in 2008 then yes we were in this location back
[16:26.020 --> 16:30.100]  in 2008 well we're even one office park over from that location they've got
[16:30.100 --> 16:36.260]  police they had notices about how it's private property over on this one area
[16:36.260 --> 16:41.060]  so we drove hundreds of yards down to another office park and there weren't
[16:41.060 --> 16:46.740]  any signs there and again this is just ridiculous but that isn't what matters
[16:46.740 --> 16:51.740]  I've got a big notebook here from now four different sources inside Bilderberg
[16:51.740 --> 16:58.140]  I talked to Daniel Lestel and last night he had a media contact here and I'm
[16:58.140 --> 17:02.580]  just sitting out there on the deck of a hotel with Jim Tucker and that's the one
[17:02.580 --> 17:05.460]  I hadn't talked to him in years called so he's on coming up you'll be able to
[17:05.460 --> 17:11.940]  interview him again I'm carrying the mobile radio unit and the bullhorn here
[17:11.940 --> 17:15.180]  Aaron do me a favor once you get up to this point will you carry this for I'll
[17:15.180 --> 17:18.060]  just want to first start bullhorning it's like you're in the army or something

[17:30.100 --> 17:35.180]  make sure I'll hydrate are we still on everything good guys Alex have been
[17:35.180 --> 17:39.140]  seeing reports about cops saying they don't want to be filmed is that the
[17:39.140 --> 17:43.140]  case oh yeah they were just saying don't what are you just saying don't film
[17:43.140 --> 17:48.260]  him earlier to Jacobson the police officer well whatever Virginia in one
[17:48.260 --> 17:52.420]  of the states it's like Maryland and Illinois and I think 10 others where they
[17:52.420 --> 17:56.940]  arrest you for filming police and call it wiretapping in public places and most
[17:56.940 --> 18:00.460]  of them get thrown out of courts but they've got such police state-loving
[18:00.460 --> 18:10.660]  juries in places like Illinois they're going for life in prison sentences oh
[18:10.660 --> 18:16.500]  his glasses were recording and then he was asking if your glasses were recording
[18:16.500 --> 18:22.860]  well of course I mean well I've got to say these Fairfax police are about as
[18:22.860 --> 18:25.980]  nice as it gets but there's just an example though do you see the security
[18:25.980 --> 18:29.180]  guard bugging their eyes out at us because there's no real threat in this
[18:29.180 --> 18:32.340]  country except for the criminal government and so they're just looking
[18:32.340 --> 18:35.860]  for some threat they're looking for somebody who's bad and it's them it's
[18:35.860 --> 18:40.500]  the Bilderberg group ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna salute these people
[18:40.500 --> 18:44.540]  maybe you guys should cut to the feed Jacobson's on so people can hear this

[20:54.220 --> 21:00.140]  everybody that is here I want to thank all the youth for standing up against
[21:00.140 --> 21:05.660]  tyranny the Bilderberg group is extremely upset that you're here they're
[21:05.660 --> 21:09.940]  extremely upset that they're in dozens and dozens of newspapers and on
[21:09.940 --> 21:16.780]  television right now the system knows that humanity is waking up the system
[21:16.780 --> 21:24.980]  knows the system is scared of the people the system is beginning to panic and
[21:24.980 --> 21:29.780]  it's because of people like you that we will defeat this foreign criminal
[21:29.780 --> 21:34.980]  global mafia that is trying to take our society over I'm gonna throw it back to

[21:42.380 --> 21:48.660]  so are you as they begin arriving in the next few hours it's Bilderberg 2012
[21:48.660 --> 21:54.660]  Gentile Virginia the people strike back
[21:56.660 --> 22:04.860]  okay back here and Alex Jones doing what Alex Jones does best you'll notice
[22:04.860 --> 22:08.980]  there was some kind of the sniveling little mainstream media hack in there
[22:08.980 --> 22:13.780]  who tried to point the finger of accusation at Alex and all the protesters
[22:13.780 --> 22:17.380]  there as if they were getting something out of what they're doing these are
[22:17.380 --> 22:22.140]  people who have traveled hundreds of miles it's a great expense they're
[22:22.140 --> 22:26.820]  spending money on hotels they're spending money on filming equipment cameras
[22:26.820 --> 22:31.940]  camcorders iPhones they're getting two three hours sleep a night covering this
[22:31.940 --> 22:37.180]  and yet this sniveling little mainstream media hack points the finger at them
[22:37.180 --> 22:41.300]  when they should be pointing the finger at the people inside the damn hotel who
[22:41.300 --> 22:45.260]  are creating all the wars collapsing the economies and yet you know somehow
[22:45.260 --> 22:49.700]  where under the spotlight for some reason again there's a amazing we are
[22:49.700 --> 22:53.700]  change video which had just come out which is gonna be on prisonplanet.com
[22:53.700 --> 22:58.580]  in a short while and it's Laurence O'Donnell and that exchange you heard
[22:58.580 --> 23:04.180]  previously just reminded me of it again Laurence O'Donnell of MSNBC and
[23:04.180 --> 23:08.700]  basically Luke Radowski goes up to him and says what do you think about the
[23:08.700 --> 23:12.100]  Bilderberg group and O'Donnell says well I've never heard of it
[23:12.100 --> 23:15.980]  Radowski says well you know it's a meeting of the most influential people
[23:15.980 --> 23:22.580]  on the planet O'Donnell in his sneering mainstream MSNBC pathetic collapsing
[23:22.580 --> 23:28.300]  ratings arrogance comes back and says no it's not he said I have no idea what it
[23:28.300 --> 23:32.500]  is so it's not so because the fact they hasn't even heard of what the Bilderberg
[23:32.500 --> 23:37.620]  group is what it does that means it just must not exist or it just have must
[23:37.620 --> 23:43.300]  have no significance whatsoever and it's just that you know the leering
[23:43.300 --> 23:48.740]  elitism of this brain-dead teleprompter reader as he stands there he can't even
[23:48.740 --> 23:53.580]  look Luke in the face he's so high and mighty on his peanut gallery perch it's
[23:53.580 --> 23:57.780]  like you know it's beneath him to even talk to the alternative media and this
[23:57.780 --> 24:03.300]  is why you know the the meeting of the 120 of the most powerful people on the
[24:03.300 --> 24:09.420]  planet is only in one US newspaper or even news outlet full stop so far the
[24:09.420 --> 24:15.140]  Washington Times nothing in the Washington Post MSNBC nothing probably
[24:15.140 --> 24:19.620]  because they hire idiots like Laurence O'Donnell get up there and say oh just
[24:19.620 --> 24:22.860]  because I don't know anything about it that must mean it has no significance
[24:22.860 --> 24:28.060]  the just the height of arrogance and ignorance just because he's ignorant of
[24:28.060 --> 24:32.020]  it you know it doesn't exist has no influence and again you saw it there in
[24:32.020 --> 24:37.900]  that exchange going back to the hassle with the police there's already YouTube
[24:37.900 --> 24:42.500]  videos about activists getting pulled over by the police having a car search
[24:42.500 --> 24:47.700]  not even within the perimeter of the hotel just on the roads outside there's
[24:47.700 --> 24:52.940]  videos of police claiming that they can't be filmed by activists when of
[24:52.940 --> 24:57.580]  course we know that all the court cases say that that's not the case you can
[24:57.580 --> 25:02.580]  film the police it's a public area no expectation of privacy so we've got a
[25:02.580 --> 25:07.460]  lot of harassment going on and it's literally you know a few hours into the
[25:07.460 --> 25:11.780]  start of the conference talking about trespassing I remember of course last
[25:11.780 --> 25:15.300]  year in Switzerland we were just driving up the mountain road there near the
[25:15.300 --> 25:20.980]  hotel in San Maritz with Aaron Dykes we got pulled over for trespassing and we
[25:20.980 --> 25:25.260]  were just on a main road you know we had to basically pay off the cops just to
[25:25.260 --> 25:31.220]  get out there but Alex has thankfully been allowed to leave the area when they
[25:31.220 --> 25:35.820]  were just trying to find a public parking space and he's gonna have some
[25:35.820 --> 25:40.980]  more bullhorning coming up going back to the media coverage of course we've got
[25:40.980 --> 25:46.700]  the Washington Times we've got Daily Mail Canadian newspapers have basically
[25:46.700 --> 25:51.460]  gone wild for the Bilderberg group there's a there's an argument going on
[25:51.460 --> 25:56.140]  between two of their elected representatives basically a slanging
[25:56.140 --> 26:01.980]  match between Bilderberg attendee Alison Redford who is the Alberta
[26:01.980 --> 26:07.660]  Premier and her political adversary called Danielle Smith and as we reported
[26:07.660 --> 26:13.500]  yesterday Redford is this prominent global warming alarmist who's attending
[26:13.500 --> 26:18.540]  Bilderberg this year to push the UN's Agenda 21 and the post industrial
[26:18.540 --> 26:24.220]  revolution which in fact if you go to the Bilderberg meetings website this is
[26:24.220 --> 26:28.980]  now the new official website of the Bilderberg group they've actually just
[26:28.980 --> 26:34.060]  as of about half an hour ago put out their official press release now of
[26:34.060 --> 26:40.020]  course routinely this press release never gets into any details and is very
[26:40.020 --> 26:46.180]  vague in the topics that it it says the group is gonna cover and we've actually
[26:46.180 --> 26:49.860]  got that press release you probably can't show it on screen because of the
[26:49.860 --> 26:53.740]  all the different cameras we've got running they can't show screenshots but
[26:53.740 --> 26:58.420]  we've got Bilderberg 2012 discussing transatlantic relations evolution of the
[26:58.420 --> 27:03.460]  political landscape in Europe and the US austerity and growth in developed
[27:03.460 --> 27:07.740]  economies that's Agenda 21 that's reducing living standards that's a
[27:07.740 --> 27:13.540]  translation cyber security again the US and Israel caught creating all the
[27:13.540 --> 27:16.980]  viruses then calling for cyber security so they can shut down the internet
[27:16.980 --> 27:22.180]  that's another key topic of discussion energy challenges that's the post
[27:22.180 --> 27:26.260]  industrial revolution jacking up energy prices to lower people living standards
[27:26.260 --> 27:31.500]  the future of democracy well you know democracy ain't got much of a future
[27:31.500 --> 27:35.820]  with 120 people who are supposedly representing us meeting in secret making
[27:35.820 --> 27:42.140]  policy so not much future in that and Russia China and the Middle East they've
[27:42.140 --> 27:46.460]  actually this is quite unprecedented too they've already released the full list
[27:46.460 --> 27:51.260]  of participants on the official Bilderberg website I remember last year in
[27:51.260 --> 27:56.300]  Switzerland it wasn't until the second or third day in it's normally towards the
[27:56.300 --> 28:00.660]  end of the conference that they do that but I'm just going down the list here
[28:00.660 --> 28:06.780]  looking for notable names of course we've got many of the usual suspects
[28:06.780 --> 28:11.940]  Kenneth Clark of course Lord Chancellor Secretary of Justice from Britain just
[28:11.940 --> 28:19.500]  looking at the USA attendees governor of Indiana Daniel junior Mitchell sorry
[28:19.500 --> 28:24.420]  Mitchell Daniels governor of Indiana Christopher de Muth distinguished fellow
[28:24.420 --> 28:30.780]  Hudson Institute and Thomas Donilon National Security Advisor the White
[28:30.780 --> 28:37.260]  House so the White House is actually represented at the Bilderberg group of
[28:37.260 --> 28:43.660]  course back in I believe was 2009 we had an Obama representative go and visit
[28:43.660 --> 28:49.500]  with the Bilderberg group of course Obama himself and Hillary most likely did
[28:49.500 --> 28:54.820]  attend the 2008 meeting which was also in Chantilly so now we got Thomas Donilon
[28:54.820 --> 29:00.580]  National Security Advisor at the White House they're scheming with heads of
[29:00.580 --> 29:06.780]  foreign corporations academia media moguls going down the list again this is
[29:06.780 --> 29:11.500]  the official route released list on the Bilderberg website we're gonna get this
[29:11.500 --> 29:16.500]  up as soon as possible info wars.com prisonplanet.com it's of course
[29:16.500 --> 29:23.580]  Bilderberg meetings.org Niall Ferguson Lawrence A Tish Professor of History
[29:23.580 --> 29:28.980]  Harvard University Niall Ferguson of course he's a big mainstream historian
[29:28.980 --> 29:34.300]  he's at the current meeting so I'm seeing a lot of new faces on this list of
[29:34.300 --> 29:38.380]  course Donald Graham Chairman CEO Washington Post Company that's why the
[29:38.380 --> 29:41.820]  Washington Post ain't reporting on Bilderberg we're gonna continue going
[29:41.820 --> 29:46.620]  through this official list to build Bilderberg attendees 2012 Chantilly after

[34:06.780 --> 34:11.020]  realizing the globalist are incredibly dangerous the status quo means giving
[34:11.020 --> 34:15.620]  into eugenics death and world government Paul let me talk about five minutes

[34:43.060 --> 34:46.460]  it came from and stuff it's on the official build a bird website they've
[34:46.460 --> 34:49.940]  released everything so they put it out there all right good the Bilderberg
[34:49.940 --> 34:54.460]  group themselves again that didn't exist a few years ago has released the list
[34:54.460 --> 34:58.780]  themselves Paul then start going over that list but I want to post it as info
[34:58.780 --> 35:02.100]  wars.com the link to them at the bottom and then we can link to our page there
[35:02.100 --> 35:06.980]  as well I'm just directing everybody from here in Chantilly please continue
[35:06.980 --> 35:11.180]  pole Watson go over the list for people that is just now going up at info wars.com
[35:11.180 --> 35:17.860]  okay I'm going through the USA names of course Keith Alexander start over start
[35:17.860 --> 35:21.900]  over and I'll come back in five minutes okay that's Alex Jones he'll be back
[35:21.900 --> 35:25.940]  soon we're going over the official Bilderberg 2012 attendee list some
[35:25.940 --> 35:30.460]  interesting names on there and some usual suspects I'm just going through the
[35:30.460 --> 35:34.740]  list of USA attendees because there's so many they're not characterized by
[35:34.740 --> 35:39.580]  country they're characterized by name so going off the top Keith Alexander
[35:39.580 --> 35:45.700]  commander US cyber command director national security agency he's going to
[35:45.700 --> 35:50.260]  be meeting with the Microsoft chaps the Google chaps the Facebook chaps the
[35:50.260 --> 35:56.580]  LinkedIn chaps to make sure that that fusion of social networking and national
[35:56.580 --> 36:01.140]  snooping is definitely in vogue that's one of the topics actually in the
[36:01.140 --> 36:05.820]  official Bilderberg press release they're talking about cyber security once
[36:05.820 --> 36:10.260]  again after of course it was the US and Israel not only got a court release in
[36:10.260 --> 36:14.980]  the Stuxnet virus but also the new flame virus basically Israel again has come
[36:14.980 --> 36:19.140]  out and admitted they did it so while they're pushing for internet control and
[36:19.140 --> 36:23.540]  censorship of free speech because of cyber security threats they're meeting
[36:23.540 --> 36:27.820]  at Bilderberg to discuss cyber security threats they're the ones creating the
[36:27.820 --> 36:31.740]  cyber security threats you know the drill by now so going down this list
[36:31.740 --> 36:35.620]  Roger Altman ever core partners of course we've got a lot of corporate people
[36:35.620 --> 36:42.660]  there is Royal Highness Prince Philip of Belgium he's a regular attendee we got
[36:42.660 --> 36:47.740]  Nick Boll's member of Parliament Great Britain he's violating the law of course
[36:47.740 --> 36:52.140]  Tony Blair attended in 93 went on to become Prime Minister there's another
[36:52.140 --> 36:57.100]  we are change video where Luke confronts Tony Blair about the fact he lied in
[36:57.100 --> 37:01.420]  front of Parliament and claimed that he never attended Bilderberg in the video
[37:01.420 --> 37:07.020]  which is at prisonplanet.com Blair had admits he did attend Bilderberg in 1993
[37:07.020 --> 37:10.780]  so he's been caught lying to Parliament so now we got another member of
[37:10.780 --> 37:16.020]  Parliament Nick Bolls there from Britain again continuing on the Bilderberg 2012
[37:16.020 --> 37:22.060]  attendee list Mitchell Daniels Jr governor of Indiana of course we were
[37:22.060 --> 37:28.460]  looking for the potential VP pick for Mitt Romney's running mate I'm gonna have
[37:28.460 --> 37:31.620]  to check if he's a Republican or a Democrat but we're gonna look at the
[37:31.620 --> 37:36.340]  names for that Thomas Donilon as I said before National Security Advisor the
[37:36.340 --> 37:40.380]  White House so the Obama administration again has a representative at
[37:40.380 --> 37:47.500]  Bilderberg as they did back in 2009 Robert Dudley BP of course all the oil
[37:47.500 --> 37:53.220]  companies represented Goldman Sachs so Michael Evans vice chairman global head
[37:53.220 --> 37:57.540]  of growth markets Goldman Sachs of course Goldman Sachs have used their
[37:57.540 --> 38:02.940]  technocrats to basically take over the IMF and the entire European economy we've
[38:02.940 --> 38:08.900]  got the EU Titans von Rumpuy and Trichy according to Jim Tucker meeting there
[38:08.900 --> 38:13.460]  don't know if they're on this list or not but routinely some of the bigger
[38:13.460 --> 38:16.980]  names that you see attending at Bilderberg and the ones that have been
[38:16.980 --> 38:20.820]  photographed will not appear on this official list it's important to stress
[38:20.820 --> 38:25.860]  this is not an exhaustive list this is merely the people who have consented to
[38:25.860 --> 38:30.900]  appear on the list if attendees wish to opt out of the list they don't appear on
[38:30.900 --> 38:36.020]  it but they can appear at the conference because they've been photographed HSBC
[38:36.020 --> 38:42.180]  of course all the banks represented Austin Goolsbee Professor of Economics
[38:42.180 --> 38:47.340]  University of Chicago academia represented again Donald Graham Washington
[38:47.340 --> 38:51.420]  Post company that's why you're not reading about it in the Washington Post even
[38:51.420 --> 38:56.260]  though it's in their backyard because he's sworn to secrecy we've got Britt
[38:56.260 --> 39:03.340]  Harris teacher retirement system of Texas Reed Hoffman co-founder executive
[39:03.340 --> 39:09.220]  chairman linked in again that's the mesh between social media the CIA and the
[39:09.220 --> 39:14.340]  National Security Agency because of course it's a giant spying database
[39:14.340 --> 39:18.140]  that what that's what it was always intended to be we've got another
[39:18.140 --> 39:21.940]  representative from China of course last year we had a Chinese representative
[39:21.940 --> 39:27.980]  and that was abnormal we've got one again this year Yi Ping Huang professor
[39:27.980 --> 39:33.820]  economics China Center for Economic Research John Huntsman of course US
[39:33.820 --> 39:39.260]  presidential candidate dropped out quite early he his team of course
[39:39.260 --> 39:42.740]  vigorously attacked the Ron Paul campaign at every turn put out fake
[39:42.740 --> 39:48.340]  information about Ron Paul attempting to portray him as a racist John Huntsman is
[39:48.340 --> 39:54.300]  at Bilderberg 2012 so he certainly inserted himself back into the elitist
[39:54.300 --> 40:00.820]  fold after his failed presidential venture again continuing down this
[40:00.820 --> 40:07.660]  list of official Bilderberg 2012 attendees Eric Israel it's CEO LeMond
[40:07.660 --> 40:14.340]  that's the French newspaper Kenneth Jacobs chairman CEO Lazard James A.
[40:14.340 --> 40:20.420]  Johnson vice chairman Perseus LLC and of course that was the guy who back in
[40:20.420 --> 40:29.180]  2008 picked Barack Obama's running mate Joe Biden so he's there again he's
[40:29.180 --> 40:33.940]  he's always there when there's a US presidential election to be manipulated
[40:33.940 --> 40:40.460]  so James A. Johnson again Vernon Jordan senior manager Lazard he's a regular
[40:40.460 --> 40:47.020]  attendee from my knowledge continuing on the list John Kerry as I said before
[40:47.020 --> 40:52.940]  senator from Massachusetts John Kerry of course former presidential candidate
[40:52.940 --> 40:59.020]  himself back in 2004 and skull and bones member remember the skull and bones
[40:59.020 --> 41:03.340]  presidential election when he ran against George W. Bush so John Kerry
[41:03.340 --> 41:08.780]  along with Huntsman is at the 2012 Bilderberg conference Henry Kissinger of
[41:08.780 --> 41:15.340]  course on the steering committee war criminal the the the Alberta premier I
[41:15.340 --> 41:19.660]  discussed earlier gave a elitist scoffing remark when she was criticized for
[41:19.660 --> 41:23.940]  attending Bilderberg she said it was you know that her political adversary was
[41:23.940 --> 41:28.580]  not sophisticated enough to understand that this is a sophisticated confab
[41:28.580 --> 41:32.500]  that's necessary for world affairs and not very sophisticated meeting with a
[41:32.500 --> 41:38.260]  war criminal Henry Kissinger okay don't try and pass it off as that so Kissinger's
[41:38.260 --> 41:46.300]  there again Klaus Kleinfield chairman CEO Alcoa and I'm just reading out the USA
[41:46.300 --> 41:49.180]  ones I'm not even gonna get to the European ones because obviously it's a
[41:49.180 --> 41:55.540]  list of 140 odd people Henry Kravitz Colbert Kravitz Roberts he was there last
[41:55.540 --> 42:03.140]  year Marie Josie Kravitz-Odston Institute that's his wife Fred Krupp
[42:03.140 --> 42:08.220]  president environmental defense fund oh isn't that interesting now we know the
[42:08.220 --> 42:13.780]  agenda 21 and ecological sustainability is going to be on the agenda we leak
[42:13.780 --> 42:18.820]  that on I believe it was a couple of days ago and of course that's all designed
[42:18.820 --> 42:23.100]  to hijack the environmental movement the global warming the man made global
[42:23.100 --> 42:26.540]  warming mantra has largely been discredited so now they're going to shift
[42:26.540 --> 42:31.500]  it into endangered species and other environmental threats to try and push
[42:31.500 --> 42:35.580]  through that carbon tax which you pay straight to Al Gore's back pocket so
[42:35.580 --> 42:40.460]  we've got environmental defense fund president Fred Krupp represented the
[42:40.460 --> 42:46.660]  USA at Bilderberg 2012 we've got some people from Israel there Cheng Li
[42:46.660 --> 42:51.260]  director research China Center Brookings institution of course they've been
[42:51.260 --> 42:56.540]  putting out numerous reports calling for an invasion of Syria so that could very
[42:56.540 --> 43:03.500]  well be on the agenda the Dow chemical company okay now we're going back to
[43:03.500 --> 43:08.900]  Alex Jones live at Bilderberg 2012 here from the scene what I want to do is Paul
[43:08.900 --> 43:13.660]  just so I don't just sit here and house the show the entire time myself when
[43:13.660 --> 43:17.140]  we're bullhorning and things I want the eyes to fade you down occasionally and
[43:17.140 --> 43:21.420]  go back to the live feed because the guys is up they're not gonna cut into you
[43:21.420 --> 43:24.460]  when you're talking so you're gonna have to every few minutes or so remind them
[43:24.460 --> 43:28.820]  to go to the feeds everybody can see this who's watching at prison planet on
[43:28.820 --> 43:33.500]  TV on the free streams at info wars comm you stream you name it because they're
[43:33.500 --> 43:38.340]  now bringing in some of these barricades here in front of us the police now are
[43:38.340 --> 43:42.660]  being told to white glove that is a cool shirt that guys got over there where it
[43:42.660 --> 43:47.780]  shows a photographer as a target that's a great we are change shirt all of this

[44:02.380 --> 44:06.660]  cancer viruses there's a probably about 20 police out here and I said hey I bet

[44:17.620 --> 44:22.180]  cancer at 36 I'm bad for telling them they're being murdered literally it's a
[44:22.180 --> 44:28.380]  Stockholm syndrome where they love their abusers they love their abusers that is
[44:28.380 --> 44:33.060]  what is going on here Paul how much of the list have you gone through it gone
[44:33.060 --> 44:37.180]  through most of it some interesting people on that John Kerry John Huntsman
[44:37.180 --> 44:42.500]  cost usual suspects Google Microsoft the Obama White House as their national
[44:42.500 --> 44:47.140]  security advisor there so they're represented once again a lot of new
[44:47.140 --> 44:51.460]  names on it but I can the way they're acting they're probably gonna have Obama
[44:51.460 --> 45:00.100]  or Romney or somebody slinking in here one of these criminals all right
[45:00.100 --> 45:08.500]  again all right there there's the head police guy right there can you talk to

[46:02.700 --> 46:06.340]  to talk to some of the police you going right now you're streaming live here

[46:11.060 --> 46:18.780]  let's talk to him who's in charge here guys but you obviously couldn't hear
[46:18.780 --> 46:22.780]  me when I was over there I know I know but I mean I mean we're here we're
[46:22.780 --> 46:26.940]  citizens I need to talk to somebody okay well who's your commander okay who's
[46:26.940 --> 46:31.460]  your commander see there that had a secret police right there and look he's
[46:31.460 --> 46:34.780]  pushing me I don't need to be pushed I need to know who who charging who's your
[46:34.780 --> 46:44.700]  superior who's your superior who's your superior are you the superior okay do I
[46:44.700 --> 46:50.740]  need to go to the police department talk to him so I need to go over there I mean
[46:50.740 --> 46:56.660]  that's not an unreasonable request hey do you really think sodium fluoride is
[46:56.660 --> 47:04.300]  good for you well what where's the property line right here you savored
[47:04.300 --> 47:11.180]  telling me step back are you like it are you like a big wimp they got into this
[47:11.180 --> 47:18.980]  you can beat people up because the cops I met yesterday weren't like that it
[47:18.980 --> 47:21.860]  doesn't matter let me tell you something what's gonna happen to this
[47:21.860 --> 47:25.420]  country you guys are in me in a lot of trouble
[47:27.900 --> 47:32.100]  I mean can you guys just not act pathetic do you realize Hillary Clinton was
[47:32.100 --> 47:40.380]  fined $300,000 what was it 94 for this meeting this is illegal and I all I want
[47:40.380 --> 47:46.620]  to do is talk to whoever's in charge I mean that's ridiculous that's a
[47:46.620 --> 47:52.140]  reasonable request because it's wrong to be doing everything you guys can look
[47:52.140 --> 47:55.900]  at those sacks of garbage over there the worst is the security guys they are
[47:55.900 --> 47:59.460]  always think they're so good those guys are nobodies you'll never I'll never
[47:59.460 --> 48:03.300]  believe how these little nobodies think they're so powerful it's so
[48:03.300 --> 48:12.180]  incredibly pathetic I am gonna go down to that I'm gonna go down to that I am
[48:12.180 --> 48:19.460]  going down there today and again once the protest starts I mean one reason they
[48:19.460 --> 48:21.860]  probably a little more grumpy days everybody saying scumbag and stuff to
[48:21.860 --> 48:25.460]  the hotel workers driving in that's another issue folks you might just
[48:25.460 --> 48:28.820]  want to actually call the limousine scumbags because the hotel workers
[48:28.820 --> 48:34.780]  have them don't even know what's going on okay well later I am gonna go down
[48:34.780 --> 48:41.140]  there to the sheriff's department I guess that's what you guys want down there
[48:41.420 --> 48:46.340]  doesn't matter because they've militarily trained them and militaries are
[48:46.340 --> 48:50.540]  designed to fight enemies that's why we don't have peace officers anymore we
[48:50.540 --> 48:54.860]  have an occupied government we have TSA on the highways totally out of their
[48:54.860 --> 48:59.540]  jurisdiction they're hiring defrock pedophiles to have the TSA up CBS News
[48:59.540 --> 49:03.260]  because that's what it is now most these guys aren't pedophiles these are just
[49:03.260 --> 49:08.660]  military types you know that military mindset and we are the Iraqis we are
[49:08.660 --> 49:14.220]  the Russians that's just some driver getting ready to pick people up they
[49:14.220 --> 49:18.740]  will have a stupid little B in the window if we don't know that code word hey
[49:18.740 --> 49:22.500]  Adam how you doing buddy good to see you they get to meet Jim person after all
[49:22.500 --> 49:28.740]  these years absolutely I want to talk to all you guys hey watch and you still
[49:28.740 --> 49:34.740]  there on the radio live yeah we're still here watching you live Alex again for
[49:34.740 --> 49:39.140]  XM listeners on channel 166 and other systems keep listening to the radio you
[49:39.140 --> 49:42.840]  can go to info wars.com there is free video streams you can actually put
[49:42.840 --> 49:50.780]  faces to all the things that we're doing right here again I met with the police
[49:50.780 --> 49:53.980]  yesterday they were really really nice off the side if you said yeah we listen
[49:53.980 --> 49:57.540]  to show a few of them today most these police are nice but I haven't been here
[49:57.540 --> 50:01.060]  till now with protest people are yelling scumbag and stuff so I'm sure the police
[50:01.060 --> 50:03.500]  think the people are talking about them then the cops are acting tough and then
[50:03.500 --> 50:06.380]  there's always a few of them you can tell weren't too tough growing up and now
[50:06.380 --> 50:09.220]  they want to show you they're tough and of course you just point that out to them
[50:09.220 --> 50:12.620]  and they get embarrassed and it is embarrassing you know the ridiculous
[50:12.620 --> 50:16.700]  exercise of power is embarrassing I have a lot of power I have 15 million
[50:16.700 --> 50:21.180]  listeners and sometimes I misuse it it's embarrassing but you know the point is
[50:21.180 --> 50:26.180]  is that we're here confronting a global mafia in fact Paul why don't you do it

[54:25.740 --> 54:30.620]  people getting pulled over vehicle search criminal background checks run
[54:30.620 --> 54:35.820]  Alex Jones and crew tried to park in a public parking lot were kicked out
[54:35.820 --> 54:39.820]  intent tried the police tried to intimidate them and now Alex Jones is
[54:39.820 --> 54:44.780]  live on the scene with the bullhorn and he's joined by Adam Kokesh of Adam
[54:44.780 --> 54:49.340]  versus the man back there are we ever sending out this this skype feed we
[54:49.340 --> 54:54.380]  have or is that needed or should Aaron go to live feed okay that's live right
[54:54.380 --> 54:59.340]  now yes it is live right now Aaron okay fantastic great job guys okay okay
[54:59.340 --> 55:03.260]  fantastic we have double boxes up there on TV right now Adam Kokesh you got
[55:03.260 --> 55:07.380]  here about three hours before we did tell us a host of Adam versus the man
[55:07.380 --> 55:11.300]  tell us what you witnessed sure well we had kind of an uneasy standoff until
[55:11.300 --> 55:15.500]  about an hour ago where the entire crowd was out here on the sidewalk on the
[55:15.500 --> 55:20.580]  public property and the police had their checkpoint well well away from the
[55:20.580 --> 55:24.060]  cameras where you couldn't see what was going on you couldn't really see who was
[55:24.060 --> 55:28.580]  involved and one of the gentlemen here is part of the protest decided to go and
[55:28.580 --> 55:33.340]  ask for identification for the officers involved in order to report them as
[55:33.340 --> 55:38.300]  violators of the Logan Act and use that as you did as a way of simply starting a
[55:38.300 --> 55:41.940]  conversation having it in official capacity saying this is this is something
[55:41.940 --> 55:46.060]  that you are obligated to do as a as an honest member of law enforcement you
[55:46.060 --> 55:50.860]  have an obligation to identify yourself by name and badge number and what
[55:50.860 --> 55:55.180]  prompted their response that you see now where we're all pushed back and very
[55:55.180 --> 55:59.620]  okay barricaded in here was that he was completely rebuffed in all of his
[55:59.620 --> 56:04.020]  attempts they let him as they pushed the crowd of us back that were trying to
[56:04.020 --> 56:07.700]  record what was going on they allowed him to write down names and badge
[56:07.700 --> 56:11.500]  numbers but there was no official communication at all and it seems it's
[56:11.500 --> 56:14.780]  one of those really weird things like you said you can you can point out the
[56:14.780 --> 56:18.540]  psychological underpinnings of the insecurities of these officers and
[56:18.540 --> 56:23.060]  embarrass them but they are relatively disciplined and they understand even
[56:23.060 --> 56:27.460]  though they're local Fairfax County Virginia officers that this is a special
[56:27.460 --> 56:31.940]  event and you're not obligated to do your normal duties as a law enforcement
[56:31.940 --> 56:35.340]  agent and everywhere the globalists go they turn into a police state and a
[56:35.340 --> 56:38.580]  martial law drill all over the world is standardized of course and so what we
[56:38.580 --> 56:41.820]  have now is where people are being barricaded back specifically here to
[56:41.820 --> 56:45.260]  the public this is what went on in Iraq when you were there I mean the exact
[56:45.260 --> 56:49.220]  same science of controls being brought here well the drones the face scanning
[56:49.220 --> 56:53.140]  man what I would compare more to my time in Iraq was was what happens at a TSA
[56:53.140 --> 56:56.740]  checkpoint you know when we I ran exactly an entry control point at a civil
[56:56.740 --> 57:00.420]  military operation center in Fallujah and in order to let an Iraqi into our
[57:00.420 --> 57:03.380]  facility they would have to get a pat down similar to what happens at a TSA
[57:03.380 --> 57:08.860]  no no they admit at MIT developed that in Iraq for the US it's a laboratory yeah
[57:08.860 --> 57:12.100]  well I mean it's perfect and now you see here even in Virginia like I feel less
[57:12.100 --> 57:15.700]  safe than I ever I'm gonna you know I'm really tempted to move out and join you
[57:15.700 --> 57:20.100]  in Texas man at least if there's any chance of succession but you know here
[57:20.100 --> 57:24.260]  in Virginia the governor is saying that we need more drones for law enforcement
[57:24.260 --> 57:28.100]  and his justification for it is how successful they've been on the battlefield
[57:28.100 --> 57:32.020]  and what he's telling us is that he's gonna turn this into a battlefield he's
[57:32.020 --> 57:36.260]  gonna keep the police imposing the same kind of martial law that we were
[57:36.260 --> 57:40.060]  imposing in Iraq and that was my big objection it wasn't law it wasn't law in
[57:40.060 --> 57:43.900]  order it was martial law and it's the same thing here now what we have is not
[57:43.900 --> 57:47.820]  a response from law enforcement that is intended to protect and serve they won't
[57:47.820 --> 57:52.340]  even converse with people here beyond issuing orders and this is exactly the
[57:52.340 --> 57:56.180]  kind of training to dehumanize us and to humanize themselves absolutely the same
[57:56.180 --> 58:00.020]  way that we dehumanize the enemy in Iraq it's the exact same thing they're the
[58:00.020 --> 58:04.500]  Praetorian Guard especially those here but it was what's so sick about the
[58:04.500 --> 58:07.660]  modern police state is that well-intentioned officers all over the
[58:07.660 --> 58:11.660]  country are now in a position where they basically at any time get drafted into
[58:11.660 --> 58:15.380]  what really here today is very especially a manifestation of the
[58:15.380 --> 58:22.140]  Praetorian Guard. We got to move back. We're going to break folks, Bo Watson. We're going to get Daniel Essoin coming on today to
[58:22.140 --> 58:31.060]  stay with us. Infowars.com's got the list. Infowars.com. Okay that's Alex Jones live on the scene at

[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:39.180]  Prime Minister in 97 just as Bill Clinton attended Bilderberg went on to
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:44.100]  become president before him and Blair actually lied before Parliament and said
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:49.020]  that he never attended Bilderberg and yet in this confrontation which is on

[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:58.980]  Bilderberg group to get an insight into more of Bilderberg's 2012 agenda because
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:04.100]  we've got the press release on Bilderberg's official website of course we
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:07.980]  know a couple of years ago they were forced to sell their official website
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:14.180]  after pretending they didn't exist for decades and it's the usual vague reference
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:18.620]  to what they're discussing no detail whatsoever and they're talking about the
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:24.380]  political economic and societal issues like transatlantic relations again that
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:28.900]  could be anything it's so vague they do mention they're discussing cyber security
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:33.300]  as was the case last year in Switzerland austerity growth in developed
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:37.620]  economies we're gonna cover it all with author Daniel Estlin and Alex Jones on

[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:08.140]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:12.300]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.380]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:20.260]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:24.540]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:28.700]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:33.020]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:36.700]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:40.900]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:44.260]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:33.100]  obviously Friday and Saturday I'm going to be here right through the

[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:26.340]  to have you thank you for joining us I am good Daniel please tell us I talked to
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:30.140]  you yesterday you say you've got some amazing intel on Bilderberg from your
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:33.220]  source what what's what's happening in the world of Bilderberg from your
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:38.140]  perspective well I think without waiting too much time we can go into this
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:42.140]  morning's discussion Alex if you want to we'd start with that maybe talk a
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:45.260]  little bit about what they're fighting to do with the next couple of days now
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:48.860]  one of the key conclusions from this morning is that the United States wants
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:53.420]  the dollar to fall in value against the Chinese one now obviously there's not a
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:57.660]  great piece of news a lot of us who've been into this we've known about this
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:01.300]  for a long time but it's interesting the actual discussion itself and the
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:06.140]  development of how these people have this meeting about 125 individuals a lot
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:10.140]  of power amongst them and between them how they actually went about talking
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:14.180]  about this whole idea of destroying the value of the United States dollar against
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:19.380]  the Chinese one now naturally Washington won't be able to publicly say that so
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:23.620]  what they do is they do the next big thing they make it politically feasible to
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:27.740]  blame China for all the problems that have beset the United States now
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:32.540]  Washington shifts the blame when in reality what Washington wants is again
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:36.420]  according to what these people talked about a devalued dollar number two the
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:40.540]  inflation a devalued dollar will cause and number three obviously you can
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:45.660]  inflate awaits debt and obligation thing is the people are the guinea pigs and
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:50.580]  all this especially the American people your wealth our wealth is at risk the
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:55.020]  purchasing power of the United States dollar is obviously being sacrificed at
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:57.840]  the expense of everything that we've talked about right now and now
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:03.220]  bill the book is concerned with yet another Lehman type mega shock that's
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:06.420]  something else of these people talked about this morning we're not concluding
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:10.100]  they'll be talking about more about this this afternoon now one of the key
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:15.300]  discussions from this morning again dealt with a very real possibility of bank
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:20.820]  runs of the final nail in the coffin of any modern economy now remember last
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:26.340]  year Alex we witnessed a very similar conclusion when investors stampede it
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.020]  from the bonds of the weakest European countries now we've talked about this a
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:33.260]  couple of years ago if you remember about two and a half years ago we said
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.980]  this was going to happen and of course it's happening right now and much like
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:40.740]  today the first to be attacked was Greece and it will be again the weakest
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:45.460]  link in the chain then comes Spain that comes Portugal and then comes Italy and
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:49.220]  France although Italy's a very interesting case scenario a lot of people
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:53.180]  are talking about Italy going down but again according to my sources within
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:58.380]  the group Italy will never go down because I have this final institution
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:04.940]  called the Vatican which of course will sustain the entire system of Italy in
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:09.500]  place okay Daniel let me go through this again some of them did arrive last
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:13.140]  night there's some there now more arriving here in the next few hours some
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:17.220]  of their jets are coming in now here in Virginia but specifically for my sources
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:22.140]  they had wanted to implode the economy but not quick enough to wake people up
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:28.060]  give me your inside take on on that and enter things getting out of control for
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:32.460]  them or is this implosion just part of their takeover you know in my film end
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:38.980]  game six years ago we talked to you you know the discussion is you know is the
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:42.780]  the Bilderberg meeting is is up and running it started this morning some
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:46.540]  people obviously are coming such as the case of some of the participants from
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:50.300]  from overseas but again the meeting is it starts on Saturday at the end of
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:55.900]  Saturday mid-day then of course they go for their boat ride or a golf game but
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:59.540]  the point is the meeting does start this morning it did start at about 8 30 this
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:02.860]  morning and again the key point which was discussed this morning is the
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:06.260]  destruction of the United States dollar and obviously the whole thing about
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:11.020]  what's coming up is as one burger burger said this morning and I quote Europe and
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:15.900]  the United States and now on a Parisian course with a second Lehman type mega
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:21.500]  shock and the key questions asked this morning is this worse than 2008 so
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:24.980]  obviously for people who are not there at the meeting yet because I haven't quite
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:28.620]  arrived due to their personal commitments certainly missing on some very
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:32.460]  interesting information and if you remember again in 2000 ages to fill in
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:37.460]  people very quickly it was strictly individual financial institutions that
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:41.060]  were on the edge of collapse today the entire nations are on the brink the
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:45.380]  banking system is on the brink Spain is on the brink every Spanish bank
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:50.300]  basically is a junk quality and you and others said that they were planning this
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:53.940]  to take control and offer their bank of the world I know von Roompi is set to
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:59.220]  speak one of the heads of the EU on having a global bank is the solution to
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:03.780]  the crisis they created but my question simply is are they losing control or
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:09.540]  things going according to plan because from my sources it's a very difficult
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:13.180]  question to ask you see we can talk about whether they're losing control by
[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:18.140]  how much you see the whole day route is a giant trap now under the guise of
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:21.780]  saving the economy what they have done is they've transferred huge amounts of
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:25.780]  debt from the private hands from the banks and other powerful interest to the
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:30.180]  government but because the economy is continued to collapse through this
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:34.860]  entire period now this debt is absolutely unfavorable that's no way that
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:39.260]  the debt can ever be paid so the effect of this is to bankrupt the government
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:42.660]  that we can see that in Greece we're seeing it right now in Spain I live in
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:47.260]  Spain and it's Greek tragedy we're seeing around us people losing everything
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:50.900]  that they've ever earned in the last 40 50 years of hard work now the real
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:55.340]  purpose of the bailout of course is to finish the destruction of the government
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:59.620]  that this inter-alpha process began and of course inter-alpha came in right after
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:04.500]  the Bretton rules agreement was destroyed in 1971 it's the collection of banks led
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:08.340]  by some of the biggest banks such as Banco Santander in Spain who control
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:13.380]  about 70% of world's money and the whole point again as you can see it in
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:17.660]  Europe for example all the negotiations are trying to save the debt and that
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:21.100]  again some of the things they'll be talking about over the next day and a half
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:26.020]  a soul and one nation after another is falling to corporatist dictatorship and
[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:30.500]  that's the real issue here Alex you're watching the nations of the world being
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:35.700]  destroyed and being replaced by fascist dictatorship something that you've
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:40.140]  often talked about over the past few years using the same terminology I'm
[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:43.380]  using right now and again I'm calling sure they're putting the technocrats in
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:48.700]  an international global fascist or imperial dictatorship
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:52.340]  fascist technocrats now Brzezinski has said that people are waking up and
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:55.860]  they're scared do you agree that that's really what the leader saying what do
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:59.700]  you think the the Bilderberg is saying about unprecedented coverage thanks to
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:03.740]  your work and so many others work in Europe and now the US the electronic
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:08.940]  Berlin Wall falling what's your take on that Daniel you know on one hand it's
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.780]  great that we're getting so much attention especially with people such as
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:15.620]  yourself in the states working in the net working the crowds but on the other
[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:19.380]  hand again there's just simply not enough people especially when you compare it
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:24.100]  to you know such popular events as I don't know a Lady Gaga concert or a
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.500]  football championship you know Super Bowl I mean it would be great if we could
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.940]  get half a million people to come out and stand in front of the hotel and
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:34.420]  actually say no to this thing but we don't have that I don't know how many
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:38.020]  thousands of activists well they beat up protesters for sure they beat up
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:41.540]  protesters for 30 years to create a chilling effect and intimidate them at
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:44.860]  each other I absolutely understand but again the price of freedom someone has
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:49.380]  to pay you were doing it in Europe I'm doing it in Europe there's Jim talk
[01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:51.980]  there's a lot of people out there doing what they're supposed to but I
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:55.300]  fortunately again sure I really wish that there were more of us doing out
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:59.020]  there more people coming out because again I agree with you Daniel Esteline
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:02.900]  what else is that Daniel give us your website tell us the latest stuff you're
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:06.820]  working on what else are you getting from the Bilderberg 2012 what else what
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:12.580]  else is on our agenda is www.DanielSChilling.com we're actually in the
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:15.860]  midst right now we're working on a Bilderberg documentary film it's about a
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:21.140]  half a million dollar production it's being put together by a young and brave
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:25.780]  Spanish production company called Prudence Film you know if you remember
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:30.300]  way back when we had a Hollywood deal with Halsey and group who put out the
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:34.140]  terminated salvation they said that they wanted nothing to do with the Bilderberg
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:37.860]  film whatsoever due to the outside pressure you know my book was first
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:42.660]  released in Spain we had a report from the key law firm in spain basically it
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:45.540]  said 90% of the book and by the way Daniel you're not just saying that I
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:49.460]  looked into the Halsey and court cases where the outside Bilderberg connected
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:53.420]  group came in and imploded it even though it was profitable terminated
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:57.620]  salvation and took it over just so much money they made for the terminated
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:01.420]  salvation they went under because they simply didn't want this film to be made
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:06.620]  it was a hundred and twenty million dollar Hollywood mega production of
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:09.700]  Bilderberg movie now we have this production company in spain who put out
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:13.420]  half a million dollars to actually make this film by their own private funds
[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:17.500]  this documentary is being made as we speak we have two amazing people we've
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:20.860]  got Linda LaRouche we've got a lot of people from the LaRouche group we have a
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:25.420]  lot of people such as Captain Rustin Sixth the top secretary of housing with
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:29.660]  the Bush father we have my publisher Chris Milligan we have you as well so we
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:33.100]  have a lot of great people for this documentary as you will know because you
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:37.220]  are documentary maker this kind of stuff is going to be put out worldwide in
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:41.300]  English we're looking at an estimated audience of about 20 million people well
[01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:43.820]  I want to have you back home and that happens but in the time we've got down
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:47.900]  as you can stay longer than 30 I know you got to go in about 10 15 minutes that
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:50.540]  brings us to the fact that the alternative media is starting to scare the
[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:55.340]  globalist and they're openly moving towards towards censorship calling for
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:59.820]  internet IDs Bilderberg wants that what what do they plan to do with free speech
[01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:04.100]  that they're getting re-education camps in the US all this stuff's being set up
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:08.460]  it seems like they want 30,000 drones over America it seems like Bilderberg's
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:11.260]  hitting the panic button or what's happening
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:14.420]  I think it's actually much simpler than that I think all you need to do is down down the people that
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:18.140]  down that a long time ago and again what they've been able to do fortunately for us
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:22.300]  and fortunately let's get over the masses that what you see on television
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:25.980]  what you see on the front page of the New York Times Washington Post or what Dan
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:30.220]  rather has to spot out tonight this has to be the truth and everything else has
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:34.300]  to be conspiracy theory of course Bilderberg is not a conspiracy theory
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:38.460]  it's conspiracy the reality and basically what they say what Alex Jones is saying is
[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:43.100]  that and what Daniel Eschel is saying is the truth why isn't it on the front page of the
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:48.100]  New York Times why is it not in New York in Washington Post why do you not get

[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:50.180]  you bet buddy again Daniel continuing what else should we know that's
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:53.740]  important right now from your Bilderberg sources
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.780]  well again these are the things that we'll be talking about obviously over the
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:03.380]  next couple of days but you have to look at this a wide work buying of
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:07.580]  sovereign debt it's happening in Spain it's happening in Greece and Portugal and
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:11.940]  in all countries of Europe and the banks are buying it because the idea is to
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:15.180]  bankrupt nations it's not the other way around the idea is not what the what
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:18.820]  we're hearing from government is just a way to actually get fresh money to the
[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:21.660]  system again the banks are buying sovereign debt because what they're
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:25.740]  doing is that bankrupting nations the idea to destroy nation-states now you
[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:30.100]  and I have talked about this way back in 2005 about an hour ago I went back over
[01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:35.860]  solid the archives of our first interview back in 2005 and we talked
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:39.100]  about this the structure of the nation-state republics and this is
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:43.140]  exactly what we're seeing right now this is the old Venetian game and having
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:47.900]  your adversary go so far in debt to you that you control the adversity of course
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:51.700]  the banks themselves are buying debt which is worthless but many of these
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:55.900]  banks are not intended to survive but if you take the oligarch at its word the
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:59.860]  Empire says that they want to reduce the population to 1 billion people on
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:02.900]  the planet against something that you've been talking about a lot of your
[01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:07.780]  videos over the last few years which means that huge sections of the banking
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:12.980]  system in the United States in Canada and in Europe huge sections of national
[01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:18.060]  economies huge sections of the population they have got to go so this
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:23.260]  system is never coming back and this is what the bailout really is in trying to
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:31.100]  save this money which is really virtual money it does not exist this is
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:35.180]  exactly what you said in 2006 when I interviewed you for in-game you have
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:39.580]  Bilderberg sources and and and this is exactly what they're doing it's eugenics
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:43.940]  this is a controlled implosion where they pose as saviors and it's a we've
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:46.780]  got to get rid of everybody's liberties to keep things together and it's a
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:51.940]  designed controlled implosion how do we fight back against this I mean clearly
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:27:07.220]  we are getting ground on yeah this is again this is the only way to go that
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:10.740]  there's a system in Europe okay it's called a monetary system which is
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:15.260]  worthless which is based on the Venetian army system going back to the 13th or
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:19.260]  the 14th century we don't want that in the United States what a credit system
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:23.340]  which is exactly what we had going back to Hamilton and this is exactly what we
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:27.220]  have to get back in the United States and this whole movement again in America
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:32.300]  is being led by Lyndon LaRouche and thank you you get Lyndon on your side a lot
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.500]  and that's a lot of help out there for the people who are trying to fight a
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:39.500]  little bit and fight the system because again we need to educate people they
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:43.660]  have to understand why the nation states of the world are being destroyed
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:47.540]  why countries are being turned into regions and why regions are being turned
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:52.300]  into the world not government but rather one world company limited again
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:55.940]  something that you and I have talked about a lot over the years and we see it
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:59.300]  again in Greece we're seeing it in Portugal we're seeing it in Italy where
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:03.780]  another elected official by the name of Mario Monti is now the caretaker
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:08.460]  prime minister and of course all these people belong to Graeme Saxe as does the
[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:12.140]  general director of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi who was on
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:17.300]  television today in Spain talking about how we need basically to you know to
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:21.820]  deeper cuts in the system which I need this to say only destroy what little
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:27.900]  Spain has left of value Daniel again very well said we're gonna go to
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:30.660]  Brighton come back with one more segment with you but I want to start now
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:35.060]  we're seeing unprecedented calls to hand the internet over quote to the UN that
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:39.380]  just means the banksters we're seeing Congress cold sit down shut up the UN
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:44.220]  and NATO command the military world government is now out in the open this
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:48.180]  is just an incredible time why are they now revealing themselves in such a
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:51.620]  great extent well you know again they're not doing it as a world government
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:54.900]  they're doing it as a one-world company limited because again it's just much
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:58.740]  easier it's again it's very stalkers your purpose something you and I've talked
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:02.460]  about for your game game documentaries on people should go and see that
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:06.780]  documentary there's a lot of truth in that in 2006 I think you put it out you
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:11.020]  interviewed me for extensive bits for that documentary one world company
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:14.580]  limited aristocracy of purpose corporations that have a lot more power
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:17.700]  than any government on the planet you can call it you and you can call it
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:22.460]  whatever you want but as the technocrats running the world and they happen to be
[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:26.100]  eugenicists it's not just like oh we've got new owners there's some banksters
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:31.940]  they want us dead I mean cancer at record numbers autism they are they are
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:37.860]  killing us deader than a hammer final segment with Daniel Estolin I'm out here

[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:17.740]  all right we're back live now the head cop was ready to come over and talk to
[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:20.460]  me earlier I was asking him to we're gonna talk to him during the next break
[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:23.700]  about some of the stuff going on over here we think we have a provocateur and
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:27.220]  a mask throwing confetti at cars and trying to start something probably a
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:34.500]  fed it probably works for a foundation but we'll expose them as well okay so so
[01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:40.020]  we are now all out here it is Bilderberg 2012 I'll continue live
[01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:43.740]  streaming after the show is over in about an hour and a half we're gonna have a
[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:50.180]  lot of people Webster Tarpoli's here there's also Adam Kokesh Mark Dice Luke
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:54.380]  Radowski just countless great patriots Dan Dix is right here it's just gonna be
[01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:59.420]  amazing three days our final segment with Daniel Estel and Daniel Jesse
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:04.220]  Ventura's conspiracy theory that you were on the first season and and I did a
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:08.580]  great job on they got Homeland Security shutdowns one of their episodes and now
[01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:12.220]  it looks like maybe all of them I'm not at liberty to talk about it yet I happen
[01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:15.860]  to follow in the news what happened with your film it really was shut to be made
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:19.580]  by that big film company that it was you know putting out films and doing great
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:24.300]  they killed your film I mean it shows that they're afraid of things or they
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:28.500]  wouldn't be trying to kill them they wouldn't be trying to shut us down I
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:30.940]  mean there's got to be a reason they want to censor the web there's got to be
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:33.940]  a reason they want to arrest political dissidents there's got to be a reason
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:37.820]  they want to beat people up at protest to dissuade this I mean these guys are
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:41.900]  paper tigers once you identify them then they're in trouble I mean they've
[01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:45.500]  always wanted to be secret because they want to make us think that their
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:48.700]  presidents and prime ministers are where the buck stops I mean do you agree with
[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:52.900]  that statement are there cracks forming in the Bilderberg facade I've been
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:56.580]  thinking about this you know the fight it is to actually is to educate people I
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:59.380]  you've been doing a lot of that through your videos I think people have to
[01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:03.420]  understand to separate a conspiracy theory you know from a conspiracy
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:07.020]  reality conspiracies what a lot of people talk about what they're
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:11.180]  looking at or is not and the actual historical building and that will help
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:14.460]  people understand exactly how to fight them because again it's not a one-eyed
[01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:18.140]  monstrous not a Jewish was on the conspiracy you know there's no conspiracy
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:21.980]  whether a lot of people their infantile fantasies either such you know I don't
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:25.580]  care no group of people no matter how powerful they are sit around the table
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:29.740]  in a dark room holding hands staring at a crystal ball planning the world's
[01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:34.180]  future again it's there are many people who think that delivering is that it is
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:38.940]  not that it's a very important element of the oligarchal structures of the
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:44.220]  Cold War period it is a self-perpetuating system a virtual spider web
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:48.340]  with blocked political economic financial and industry interests and that
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:52.940]  in itself Alex is a pretty significant factor because what it means what it
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:57.780]  meant was that it was a vehicle through which private financier oligarchical
[01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:02.500]  interests were able to impose their policies on what is nominally sovereign
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:06.740]  governments and that's what building is and that's the role we play and if we
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:10.180]  take it anywhere beyond that we're getting into the reality of conspiracy
[01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:14.340]  views and again our job is to make sure we get as many people on the board as
[01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:18.300]  we can we've got to speak to the folks in the gallery the normal people have a
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:23.060]  normal 9 to 5 Joe jobs and these are the people who want on our side and they
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:27.740]  have to understand this is some crazy stuff but this is real it is based and
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:31.820]  steeped in history going back about a thousand years and what he knows more
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:34.860]  about this than anybody else especially when you're talking about the Venetian
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:38.540]  Black nobility so he can confirm a lot of these things and give you additional
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:43.540]  information but again that's a good point that's a good point Aaron Aaron will
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:46.180]  you take the live feed over there and go find Webster Tarpley and bring him over
[01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:50.580]  here show that when yeah bring Tarpley over for a live interview when Daniel
[01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:53.700]  leaves in about eight nine minutes that's a good idea Daniel Estolin Daniel
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:58.660]  Estolin again your books out there just type in Daniel Estolin and everybody
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:02.260]  can find your amazing work out there in the five six seven minutes we've got
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:05.860]  left with you I agree with you that it's not one group looking into a crystal
[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:10.380]  ball Goldberg is one of the top syndicate you know global crime network
[01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:13.900]  oligarch systems with these elites grow big governments to get control of
[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:17.020]  populations and wealth and then they start imploding those governments and
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:20.060]  directing that power directly into corporate interest that's why they've
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:23.780]  got mercenaries on the streets of America private drones they're getting
[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:27.540]  everybody used to this right now getting everybody prepared for this private
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:33.300]  corporate takeover that has government power on top of it but there is the
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:37.100]  occult involved Bohemian Grove sculling bones I think that's just because elites
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:41.220]  throughout history get decadent get weird get into strange stuff and I think
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:44.420]  that's where you get some of the ideas that you know it's one you know one
[01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:49.460]  lizard goblin running everything but what do you say about the weird fetishes
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:53.820]  of the elite and the propensity of Tony Blair Francois Miron so many others to
[01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:58.300]  be into the occult you don't have to be a member of the
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:03.620]  developer group to be aware there's a lot of crazy freaks out there but it's absolutely true now again if we go back
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:07.100]  historically what to you know to the beginning of both of deliberate you can
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:10.980]  actually you know make quite a straight line for about 2,000 years back going
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:14.780]  from the Roman Empire to the Byzantine Empire to the old Venetian rock
[01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:19.820]  nobility starting about the fourth crusade around 1200 1244 then you go
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:23.820]  into the the markedness to the synarchist and then into build up again
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:29.340]  between you have the the the Venetian nobility losing their stronghold and
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:33.380]  in the Adriatic and actually switching places moving to another country and
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:36.660]  that's how the English takeover was you know or England became the British
[01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:40.100]  Empire when it was taken over through the William of Orange which is again was
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:44.500]  a Venetian operation and again what Darkly knows so much about this is a
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:47.940]  wealth of information definitely get him to talk about this there's just one
[01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:51.860]  point I want to touch on before we before we end today's conversation you
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:55.020]  said something about you know the destruction of the population the
[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:57.620]  destruction of the world economy reduction of the population to one
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:01.940]  billion people have to understand is when we're talking about because again the
[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:05.740]  question it's a very logical question why would they want to destroy the world
[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:09.740]  economy won't Rockefeller and the Rothschild and all these other freaks
[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:13.620]  won't they suffer as well and the answer is no is he progress and
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:18.140]  development is directly proportional to population density which means that if
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:20.980]  you have more progress more development more money more health you have more
[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:25.060]  people on the planet and they have a small planet such as our planet Earth
[01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:29.380]  with limited natural resources if you are Rockefeller you don't want a hundred
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:32.740]  billion people on the planet because they simply won't have enough food or
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:37.700]  water so for Rockefeller and company to live you and I the great unwashed as they
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:41.660]  call us as you know we have to die one way or another which is why again we see
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:46.300]  all these phrases such as zero growth because again if you have no growth no
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:50.340]  technology no progress there's no way you can support a population
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:55.060]  based on billions of people and that's why they need to destroy the world's
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:59.220]  wealth not because they will suffer but because of the outer expense they will
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:02.820]  survive and that's something that people have to understand these are key
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:07.140]  elements which a lot of people who try to follow the movement and get into this
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:10.780]  you know build a work progress our games to build the burgers they don't seem to
[01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:13.740]  understand because these are difficult things to understand because again you
[01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:19.220]  yes yes I agree with you I agree the time we have left here I want to bring
[01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:22.380]  Paul Watson and has been patiently waiting in the wings I'm sure you've got
[01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:26.100]  some questions for Daniel Esselen has proven repeatedly he has big inside
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:29.900]  contacts very close to Bilderberg we'll just leave it at that Paul Watson from
[01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:34.180]  England tied into this international transmission worldwide what are your
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:38.180]  questions for Daniel Esselen before he has to go yeah I just wanted to ask
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:42.220]  Daniel we see a kind of shift in the makeup of Bilderberg we've got all these
[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:46.260]  social networking heads now attending the conference you know people like Peter
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:51.820]  Thiel and of course representatives of Facebook linked in and social networking
[01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:55.620]  corporations like that does that represent some kind of shift in the
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:59.460]  makeup of Bilderberg in that it's not so much kissing your Rockefeller now
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:02.820]  shifting towards the new God
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:06.420]  you know and Rockefeller is still there but they're old and hopefully he'll be dead soon
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:09.660]  but the part is that it's still a financial element which controls
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:13.700]  Bilderberg but the the social elements and the social element of control this
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:16.820]  networking means cybernetics you know whatever you want to call it
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:21.100]  transhumanism these are key elements of future because again future is not
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:25.060]  Rockefeller future is not Kissinger future is technology and how these people
[01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:29.820]  who control technology these giant corporations and people attend these
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:33.740]  meetings how through technology they'll be able to control us and there's no
[01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:37.380]  better way to do this than through social networking and we see it again with
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:40.940]  Facebook MySpace and all these other networks out there again which is
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:46.180]  guinea pigs of this giant experiment so yeah very very good question Paul well
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:50.540]  that's right the banksters they're in control through their control of
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:53.660]  fractional reserve banking that's the original key to their power and their
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:57.620]  technology of political political political control that came out of the
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:42:01.660]  Venetian area as Daniel was just pointing out but they're obsessed and think
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:05.420]  the technocracy and call themselves technocrats is going to be the key in
[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:10.740]  the future to fully govern and dominate humanity Daniel any other
[01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:15.180]  key tidbits or what can we expect in the next few days as you get more from
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:20.900]  your sources I want Bilderberg is up to the key point again aside from what we
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:25.660]  talked about nature in Afghanistan they want to talk about the practical agenda
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:30.180]  for the alliance then obviously you rather Russia key subjects on the agenda
[01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:34.180]  they want to talk about the economic and the financial threats to the alliance
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:38.860]  from these two nations the consequences of organs that's another one of the
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:43.780]  key points the influence of domestic issues on American foreign policy Japan
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:47.580]  is going to be on the agenda as well the outlook for Japanese economy of course
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:51.100]  the number one question this morning which they're discussing is will you
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:55.020]  will survive the answers obviously not and the second point is they'll be
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:58.740]  talking about the top-june the developments in Europe Europe's exit
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:03.100]  strategy and hold question mark it's not a whole Europe is being imploded is
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:07.180]  going to be being destroyed we could see it again in Spain it's happening all
[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.940]  over Europe and obviously I think Paul you will agree it's also happening in
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:18.980]  England Daniel in closing why did Bilderberg want to remain secret I mean
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:23.140]  obviously that's that's got to be a big problem for them they applied to try this
[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:27.700]  mind game with people and so that Bilderberg didn't exist this Jedi mind
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:31.660]  trick and now that that hoax has fallen and when people start discovering that
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:35.380]  there's people behind the puppet politicians that's the beginning of the
[01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:38.860]  end why did Bilderberg want to remain secret just because they're engaged in
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:46.660]  Logan act violations because they're engaged in mind so again it depends on
[01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:49.100]  how you look at it from whose point of view bill the first point of view there
[01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:52.980]  is no law is just order their order and the point is that there's a lot of people
[01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:56.580]  within the group who actually would prefer this to be an open an open meeting
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:59.940]  such as doubles for example because they feel that people attract a lot less
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:04.420]  attention but people such as Henry Kissinger for example Omega maniacs they
[01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:07.980]  wanted to be this private secret meeting which is why they you know keep
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:13.780]  harping on keeping it you know secret a lot of people within the group I don't
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:16.980]  know I think pragmatic they wanted actually to be open not up until the
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:21.460]  public or open to the international media but certainly have a Davos-like
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:25.420]  effect and we'll see exactly what will happen the next few years because I think
[01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:30.140]  if you and protesters out there keep growing in numbers they may just have to
[01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:37.220]  call it and be and turn into a more open private meeting but then politicians
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:40.860]  that don't want to be known that they're going there we'll have to admit
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:43.780]  they're going there and then they can't have behind closed doors meetings but we
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:47.260]  all know it places like Davos there's the public meetings there's really a
[01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:51.340]  little impromptu side meetings so overall on a scale of one to a hundred
[01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:55.740]  Daniel Estlin from your research 100 being Bilderberg is flying high and
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:45:00.500]  nothing resisting him and zero being total defeat of the oligarchs where are
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:04.500]  we on that scale of one to a hundred I say we're on at about 50 right now it's
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:08.380]  a tipping point either way for the future of humanity what do you say
[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:25.580]  well you know I think you know things are not going as well as we'd like for them to go but certainly not as quickly as they want them to go so yeah I think you're right on the money I think it's about 50-50 but again it's you know the time is against them because you know the longer we can withstand the onslaught the more of us will actually join the movement and wake up
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:29.380]  to the dangers of these organizations Bilderberg and others that try that on commission
[01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:34.540]  council for relations through the circle you know etc etc can actually cost and
[01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:39.660]  polls for the world I also heard from folks that said they talked to you want
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:43.140]  to confirm it that you're unable to get into the U.S. now and that's why you
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:46.660]  didn't travel here I haven't been able to for a couple of years but you know this
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:50.060]  particularly this year I didn't even bother trying I mean I might have tried and they
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:53.300]  might have said yes or no but certainly last year I tried and didn't let me in the
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:56.500]  year before either and I if you remember when I actually went to make a
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:46:01.060]  documentary the conspiracy theories of the Jesse Ventura I have to post my
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:04.100]  truth for a couple of days because they wouldn't let me on the plane that was
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:09.340]  way back in 2009 it's in my shadow master's book I explained that whole episode
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:12.660]  yeah but I mean I remember talking to Ventura when it was happening and they
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:16.700]  canceled the plane that they booked I mean this is what's happening they they
[01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:21.100]  have no fly list no gun by list no judge no jury it's this national security
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:24.820]  state it's the opposite of national security it's total insecurity the
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:29.020]  security threat is the globalist taking over our nations and destroying it it's
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:32.980]  unbelievable Daniel Eslund it was great having you on maybe I can get you up in
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:42.900]  a few weeks in the aftermath of the Bilderberg I am right in front of the
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:48.100]  Westfield's Marriott Hotel but don't even stop your car for a minute to be
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:51.300]  dropped off of the police will write you tickets it's shameful that they would
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:55.180]  be trying to white glove inspect everybody and you've got to park in a
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:58.900]  nearby park about a mile away to get here
[01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:03.700]  because I want to put it all on my webpage we're gonna try to concentrate
[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:08.980]  everybody's thinking get off work seven o'clock on Friday and seven o'clock on
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:13.900]  Saturday in the evening so everybody has a chance to get here from all over the
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:17.420]  country but we're gonna be protesting tomorrow live down here during my radio
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:21.980]  show from noon to three Eastern I'm gonna be out here tonight as well but we're
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:27.420]  gonna try to focus it all Friday night seven o'clock and Saturday night seven
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:31.660]  o'clock the itineraries up at info wars.com so is the list which they didn't
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:34.180]  put out in the past now they're starting to put it out the official Bilderberg
[01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:37.220]  attendee list that doesn't mean everybody's on it hey by the way Daniel
[01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:40.180]  just keep asking questions but we're about to go to break are there any but
[01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:45.100]  anybody on the list that isn't on the list I mean you always say that hey
[01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:48.300]  there'll be people who who are there that aren't on the list and I've been
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:52.540]  there with you at Bilderberg with long lenses documenting that there are
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:55.700]  always people there who aren't on the list and that's usually the most
[01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:59.860]  important people to know. I don't have that information yet because again it's
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:03.100]  still morning in the United States and my sources haven't gotten back to me
[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:07.500]  because I'm in Spain but as soon as I do I'll certainly let you know. All right

[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:34.700]  one from Spain we are in Virginia in front of the Bilderberg event they have
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:38.340]  been arriving a bit more about to arrive they really start arriving hot and
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:43.380]  heavy around two three o'clock that's in the next hour or so we are here live I
[01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:46.500]  tell you I'm not here live it's torture because all these great listeners come
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:49.500]  over want to shake my hand or talk to me and I'm like I'm live on the radio and
[01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:52.380]  it feels like I'm rebuffing them that's terrible but there are so many good
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:55.700]  people here looks like there's more than 200 people here now more folks are
[01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:58.780]  arriving extremely exciting Paul Watson give me your thoughts on what's
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:03.820]  happening. Well it's just amazing again the lack of press coverage I mean we had
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:08.860]  Washington Times this morning we've had a Huffington Post report but that's it
[01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:14.900]  for today and this you know this is the heads of Airbus, HSBC, major banks, John
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:19.420]  Kerry Huntsman you know former presidential candidates, EU heads, NATO
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:23.700]  heads. What about Ron Johnson? Is Senator Ron Johnson on the list? There's nothing in their backyard
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:29.500]  absolutely nothing because the public is there so again almost complete
[01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:35.700]  media blockade on the Bilderberg group apart from a few news outlets. Is Senator
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:41.620]  Ron Johnson on the list? I will check that right now because there's gonna be
[01:49:41.620 --> 01:49:46.620]  like 30, 40, 50 people that are not on the list that are in there so that's
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:52.180]  important my little bird told me he's in there and no on the list James A. Johnson
[01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:56.500]  is but there's no Ron Johnson. Hey what did the what did the head cops say his
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:03.100]  name was? Randy? Fair what he said. I said it on air I was streaming then oh it
[01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:06.940]  didn't matter we're gonna go to break here in a minute. Thank you sir God bless

[01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:15.420]  he's in charge around here he just says he's the senior police officer or what
[01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:19.220]  you call it master police officer master police officer you were nice enough to
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:23.060]  actually talk to us the commoner slaves four years ago seems like five minutes
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:27.500]  ago and we're here we're back in the kind of deja vu how four years goes by
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:32.300]  absolutely so so tell us what's going on here I see you're with the SWAT team are
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:37.980]  you gonna keep us safe yeah absolutely are you aware of who's meeting here in
[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:41.300]  the hotel yes I'm listening to your show you listen to the show too
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.500]  absolutely well around it's some other guys listen to the show I ran to five
[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:47.580]  guys who were all really nice yesterday and you know they asked us to go we left
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:51.860]  immediately but I just want to find out who's absolutely harsh as I understand
[01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:55.900]  you see somebody in the woods being you got to write them a ticket because that's
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:59.820]  the law but I mean it looks like they're looking to find people people are
[01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:02.820]  getting dropped off in like 10 seconds they're writing them tickets if they
[01:55:02.820 --> 01:55:06.380]  stop I mean would you guys normally give somebody a ticket if they stopped and
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:10.060]  there's not a lot of traffic let somebody out of the car
[01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:19.660]  Lee's not allowed Lee's being pulled back into the controls uh-oh Lee's in
[01:55:19.660 --> 01:55:25.100]  trouble he revealed he's a listener so Lee doesn't like anything Lee doesn't
[01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:29.740]  like it I bet when he saw Norman I mean mr. Panetta Leon Panetta tell him that
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:35.420]  the UN now runs the US military do you guys see that the guys inside here
[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:39.980]  openly say they run the military in our government I'm not kidding it's a
[01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:46.100]  violation of the Logan act he that guy who came over he must be in charge now
[01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:49.580]  we're beginning now we're beginning to understand what's really going on here
[01:55:49.580 --> 01:56:03.380]  uh-oh he talked to an evil American Lee got in trouble that's it Lee oh my god
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:10.380]  anyways anyways see how much these police listen to show where you listen to
[01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:14.420]  the show before we're here four years ago or that got you listening oh the
[01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:18.500]  outreach program there you go folks I talked like five of the cops the other

[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:26.500]  go back over here that's hilarious did you get all that guys did everybody see
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:30.660]  that Watson what do you think of that that's pretty funny isn't it pretty
[01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:34.280]  funny how some of them will talk to you and others just treat you like absolute
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:39.460]  scum yeah one thing no no no no the head guy ran out of the bush and he's
[01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:44.100]  endorsed Romney and there's been speculation that Mitch Daniels could be
[01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:50.060]  Romney's VP so because we had Edwards groomed back in 2004 so could Indiana

[02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:05.860]  that are here a lot of great folks here it's amazing back to Paul Watson as Alex
[02:01:05.860 --> 02:01:12.140]  Jones live in Chantilly Bilderberg 2012 we're just going through the member
[02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:16.860]  list and some of the ramifications of that I believe we got Rob do back in the
[02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:24.300]  studio Rob you there don't have Rob do yet Rob do will be coming in shortly but
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:29.820]  I'm going through the list again and as I said a while ago Mitch Daniels the
[02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:35.340]  governor of Indiana of course we had all his speculation about Marco Rubio being
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:41.340]  the potential VP pick for Mitt Romney this stemmed from a Washington post
[02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:46.940]  article written by veteran 30-year columnist Al Cayman in which he referenced
[02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:52.580]  John Edwards 2004 attendance at the Bilderberg meeting in stressor Italy
[02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:57.900]  where he gave a impressive to the Bilderberg members forum policy speech
[02:01:57.900 --> 02:02:03.220]  and even as the campaign vehicles were all being labeled with Kerry get-part
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:07.780]  stickers they in fact changed it at the last minute after Edwards Bilderberg
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:14.580]  performance and Edwards became the VP pick again in 2008 James A. Johnson who
[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:19.420]  is there right now in Chantilly attending once again he selected Barack
[02:02:19.420 --> 02:02:25.420]  Obama's running mate and of course back in 2004 John Edwards ran with John Kerry
[02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:30.380]  who again is in attendance today so there was speculation about Rubio being
[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:35.500]  the potential VP but we've actually got Mitch Daniels in attendance the governor
[02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:40.900]  of Indiana the there's a story out of the ticket from a few days ago Mitch
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:45.940]  Daniels dismisses Romney Veep talk it won't happen Indiana governor Mitch
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:49.940]  Daniels who offered a tepid endorsement of Mitt Romney only after the
[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:53.540]  Republican primaries pushed back hard against the idea that he'll be chosen
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:58.420]  as Romney's running mate and basically they've all said that Rubio said it
[02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:02.700]  number of the other potential VP candidates have said it but it's just
[02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:07.180]  interesting that Mitch Daniels is at Bilderberg because they have a history
[02:03:07.180 --> 02:03:13.500]  of having a hidden hand influence in the US presidential election so we'll wait
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:17.340]  to see what develops from that of course Rubio has already attended numerous
[02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:22.260]  foreign policy speeches in the weeks leading up to Bilderberg so we'll see
[02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:27.180]  what becomes of that again we've got the full official attendee list on
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:33.700]  prisonplanet.com we've also got sneering MSNBC anchor I'm way too lazy to
[02:03:33.700 --> 02:03:37.700]  research Bilderberg and this is a confrontation by Luke Radarski if we
[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:43.220]  are changing which he talks to Lawrence O'Donnell MSNBC host and it's just
[02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:48.060]  amazing to see the sneering arrogance of O'Donnell he doesn't even know what
[02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:52.620]  Bilderberg is when Luke tells him he says oh that can't have any importance
[02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:56.100]  because I don't know what it is because like he's so high and mighty that
[02:03:56.100 --> 02:04:00.460]  anything that doesn't enter his consciousness just doesn't exist and
[02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:05.740]  basically Luke schools him on it and O'Donnell just proves how pathetically
[02:04:05.740 --> 02:04:11.500]  ignorant he is just like the rest of the mainstream media in not only failing to
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:15.980]  cover Bilderberg but not even knowing what the organization is so again it goes
[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:21.260]  back to the fact that the Washington Post publisher is in the meeting it's a
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:25.700]  meeting of 120 global power brokers most influential people on the planet you
[02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:31.300]  know Eric Schmidt Google LinkedIn Facebook Airbus HSBC Barclays all of
[02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:38.020]  them along with US politicians and not a peep one Washington Times story broke
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:43.220]  the US media blockade and basically nothing else the Huffington Post done a
[02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:47.620]  story on it but when you're talking about you know the alphabet agency news
[02:04:47.620 --> 02:04:54.020]  agencies ABC and MSNBC absolutely nothing and it's pathetic moving out of
[02:04:54.020 --> 02:04:57.540]  break soon and we're gonna come back with more breaking Bilderberg news and

[02:08:35.820 --> 02:08:40.460]  been mooted as a potential VP for Mitt Romney and he's there meeting at
[02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:44.860]  Builderberg 2012 Builderberg has a history of grooming vice presidential
[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:48.060]  candidates and now we're going to talk to Rob Dew who's got some more
[02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:52.660]  information on Mitch Daniels governor of Indiana Rob go ahead that's right Paul
[02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:55.980]  thanks a lot and I just want to say it's a beautiful scene out there with all
[02:08:55.980 --> 02:08:59.100]  those people which I could be there but I'm happy to be right here there's
[02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:04.180]  Burmese right there anyway 87 to 90 Mitch Daniels led the right-wing
[02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:08.340]  think tank Hudson Institute which was funded by pharmaceutical giant Eli
[02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:12.780]  Lilly and company and then he left Hudson as for an executive position at
[02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:16.220]  Eli Lilly where he rose to the position of senior vice president for corporate
[02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:21.460]  strategy before leaving in 2001 here's the revolving door to head George W.
[02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:26.300]  Bush's office of management and budget okay so here's here we have a guy who's
[02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:30.980]  very unimposing looking he looks like a second-tier guy he looks like vice
[02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:34.980]  president material he kind of reminds you of Dan Quayle who comes from the same
[02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:42.260]  state and you know he's real small kind of has a comb over very unimposing but
[02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:44.860]  you know what he's gonna sneak up behind you and shoot you up with some the
[02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:49.900]  Marisol because if you don't remember one of the companies that developed the
[02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:57.380]  Marisol was Eli Lilly so there we go you can expect more vaccines if for more
[02:09:57.380 --> 02:10:02.100]  problems if you have Mitch Daniels getting in as the vice president also
[02:10:02.100 --> 02:10:04.980]  notice some other people on here some media people that need to be questioned
[02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:11.100]  Peggy Noonan author and columnist of the Wall Street Journal okay and also
[02:10:11.100 --> 02:10:18.260]  Charlie Rose okay he does all those interviews really nice and dark lights
[02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:22.100]  talking to all those people about so many problems that they have to face every
[02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:26.180]  year you know he's gonna be there so I wonder if he he will answer questions
[02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:30.860]  about Bilderberg I wonder if we even mentioned that it exists we've had
[02:10:30.860 --> 02:10:37.460]  Luke Radowski I guess we are changes issuing one confrontation an hour off
[02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:40.140]  their Facebook site and then they're gonna put it on their YouTube site so
[02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:44.060]  they're gonna be sending out all kinds of stuff it's really good to see these
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:49.780]  people pop in here's the list over here if you want to pop in on that Richard
[02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:55.060]  Pearl that's another one he's now left his government post and he's a resident
[02:10:55.060 --> 02:11:00.460]  fellow the American Enterprise Institute I thought that that was pretty
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:07.140]  interesting let's see Vernon Jordan who I think Bill Clinton even admitted that
[02:11:07.140 --> 02:11:10.300]  Vernon Jordan invited him to Bilderberg but of course they didn't talk about
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:14.860]  NAFTA or anything like that let's see who else is on this list that's
[02:11:14.860 --> 02:11:21.300]  interesting hmm I just think it's it's a definitely a who's who of the power
[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:25.860]  brokers and then every once in a while you see a media guy thrown in Paul what's
[02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:28.100]  what's your take on some of these media people there's someone here a
[02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:36.100]  journalist from LA7 TV in Italy Lily Gruber yes it's not just US media is it
[02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:39.620]  in fact well you've got the Wall Street Journal represented you've got Washington
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:45.020]  Post but then you've got a smattering of foreign media as you said LA7 TV Italy
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:49.300]  you've got Le Monde out of France so I mean they're just as complicit of course
[02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:53.900]  Bilderberg mainly takes place in Europe it only visits North America you know
[02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:58.500]  once every four years probably so a lot of the European media are complicit in
[02:11:58.500 --> 02:12:04.060]  this and again so far there's been very little there's been a Daily Mail article
[02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:09.460]  a Washington Times a Huffington Post big debate in Canada because the two
[02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:14.100]  politicians there are having a back-and-forth over $19,000 which has
[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:19.180]  changed to these people well exactly because she's she's attending in a
[02:12:19.180 --> 02:12:23.940]  private capacity but the taxpayers are paying for it that's why people are
[02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:27.780]  getting up in arms about it but I don't believe she's actually on the list which
[02:12:27.780 --> 02:12:32.860]  again I mean she put out a press release saying she would be there and she's not
[02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:36.900]  on the list although I've only scanned it briefly so again there's more people
[02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:43.540]  who were there who aren't on the list that is true here's an interesting name
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:46.980]  I'm looking up some information on him right now Fred Krupp president of the
[02:12:46.980 --> 02:12:50.780]  Environmental Defense Fund that sounds like it's got agenda 21 written all
[02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:56.820]  over it I'm gonna do some looking up on this guy and see we can find out Peter
[02:12:56.820 --> 02:13:02.140]  Mandelson of Great Britain member of the House of Lords Monday yeah well what
[02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:06.900]  can you tell us about Mandelson oh Mandelson's routinely there he's there every
[02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:10.100]  year but I can just sit down relax kind of pops back in and out of British
[02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:14.060]  politics he gets whacked down by a new scandal and keeps popping back up and
[02:13:14.060 --> 02:13:17.980]  he's always hanging out with Ross Charles on the yacht Monaco so he's an
[02:13:17.980 --> 02:13:22.300]  integral member and yeah like you said Fred Krupp Environmental Defense Fund
[02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:26.580]  which is a non-profit environmental advocacy group which we know they're
[02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:30.540]  talking about that because that's why the Canadian Premier is there to talk
[02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:34.440]  about quote ecological issues and sustainable development yeah let's
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:37.780]  talk about agenda 21 welcome back to him and I think we're gonna go through to
[02:13:37.780 --> 02:13:43.020]  Alex right now Alex is on the scene in Chantilly 3.0 Bilderberg 2012 go ahead
[02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:48.260]  Alex well I was just gonna pop in and let you guys finish your point but then
[02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:52.260]  it'd probably be a good time for me to go through the intel I've gotten for
[02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:56.700]  moles inside Bilderberg not Bilderberg members but inside Bilderberg and I
[02:13:56.700 --> 02:14:01.620]  think it'd be a good time for me to we're still live-streaming right Aaron
[02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:05.060]  fantastic we'll continue to give you shots no no that's right you take a
[02:14:05.060 --> 02:14:08.220]  break I'm just saying let's aim it up the street like that perfect great job
[02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:12.140]  we're gonna continue to be streaming out here on the street this is real
[02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:16.860]  journalism real full-spectrum resistance to the globalist couldn't do it
[02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:20.460]  without all the supporters and listeners out there you guys continue I just
[02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:24.180]  wanted to let you know coming up the next segment I've just got to collate
[02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:28.060]  this I've got so many notes here I've got that what they're really discussing
[02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:32.500]  not just the items on their agenda that I mean we've never gotten more
[02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:36.500]  information because they're so rude and so mean to the employees inside and so
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:39.780]  hateful with their advanced team and they were so mean to people four years
[02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:45.260]  ago when they were here that we're just getting amazing amazing information and
[02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:49.740]  intel on these guys and we're absolutely kicking their butt and it just
[02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:54.160]  feels so good in my heart and I feel so humbled to see all these parents out
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:57.980]  here with their children to see old people to see young people to see black
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:02.620]  people white Hispanic Asian who all just have the same light in their eyes of a
[02:15:02.620 --> 02:15:07.580]  desire for liberty and freedom and and and and humanity beginning to wake up
[02:15:07.580 --> 02:15:12.380]  and unify against these globalist because this is a life or death situation
[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:16.700]  that we're facing here we've got to defeat these people and it's so so
[02:15:16.700 --> 02:15:20.820]  amazingly important the shadow government the shadow corporate fascist
[02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:25.020]  system that uses socialism to get us dependent does not want us knowing and
[02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:29.380]  so many I ran into probably wow look at that plane with two propellers on the
[02:15:29.380 --> 02:15:32.700]  back in that weird high-tech looking to see that word with dollars there's all
[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:35.860]  these crazy aircraft going over we probably should send people out to
[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:39.300]  what's the name of the one yeah there's the menaces where they're really
[02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:42.780]  landing and also the jetway that's where it's all going but we've got listeners
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:46.980]  out there as well so it'll all get out one way or the other but to realize that
[02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:50.860]  the globalist are attacking humanity they don't just want to conquer us they
[02:15:50.860 --> 02:15:55.860]  want to dumb us down and kill us I mean it's in their own reports and oh yeah
[02:15:55.860 --> 02:16:00.380]  back to the cops I'd say 90% of the police are really good people but then
[02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:04.140]  finally I was talking like the second command and when he came over to
[02:16:04.140 --> 02:16:09.100]  Sinyama listener the head guy runs out of the bushes and runs over and goes
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:13.780]  that's it stop talking to him and I was just going man why are you guys or
[02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:17.580]  somebody stops their car for 20 seconds out here in the middle of nowhere in
[02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:20.740]  this office part to let somebody off because you only people park around
[02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:23.860]  here why are you giving them tickets I said come on you wouldn't do that to a
[02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:27.060]  regular citizen and he was about to say yeah you're right we wouldn't of course
[02:16:27.060 --> 02:16:31.460]  you saying well I wouldn't and there but so what's sick is the higher ups of
[02:16:31.460 --> 02:16:37.460]  the Fairfax County police are telling them to just absolutely hammer American
[02:16:37.460 --> 02:16:41.380]  demonstrators and the sacred first amendment people fought and died for so
[02:16:41.380 --> 02:16:45.220]  hard that most countries don't have Australia's banning free speech I mean
[02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:47.940]  I can't believe how fast this is moving the globalists are doing this
[02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:51.940]  everywhere you've got an illegal Logan act violating event you've got these
[02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:56.340]  military types and their black chargers driving in smugly looking at us on a
[02:16:56.340 --> 02:16:59.980]  power trip because they jog and lift weights know how to shoot a gun and they
[02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:03.140]  serve the dark New World Order so they're part of the winning club you're not
[02:17:03.140 --> 02:17:06.740]  part of the winning club to understand even if you're delusional you're not
[02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:11.900]  part of the New World Order to all the yuppies that say okay put poison in the
[02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:16.260]  water there's too many people they're doing it to you you idiot okay even if
[02:17:16.260 --> 02:17:19.580]  you think that's the right thing to do which it isn't and then they say
[02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:23.900]  reduced population let's say there's too many people okay which is debatable the
[02:17:23.900 --> 02:17:28.220]  globalist actual population documents memorandum 200 the State Department
[02:17:28.220 --> 02:17:33.540]  admit that if they just industrialized Latin America Asia and in Africa the
[02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:37.060]  people start having 1.3 kids like everybody else you have a population
[02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:41.420]  drop Russia's having to pay people to have kids all the industrialized world
[02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:45.260]  are dying instead the globalists keep the third world in squalor people have
[02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:49.420]  seven eight kids half of them die and they try to give them bio weapons and
[02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:53.380]  chemical weapons to dumb them down it's just evil the globalists just like to
[02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:57.780]  hurt people they like to exercise we're all power all the medical testing on the
[02:17:57.780 --> 02:18:02.100]  troops all the medical testing on foster kids I'm done they're the enemy and
[02:18:02.100 --> 02:18:04.860]  her and later I'm going over there to bullhorn them when they really start
[02:18:04.860 --> 02:18:09.860]  arriving some of them are here now to let them know in no uncertain terms that
[02:18:09.860 --> 02:18:13.260]  we understand they're murdering criminals and we see them and we're
[02:18:13.260 --> 02:18:16.780]  aware of them when they start releasing even more but powerful bio weapons
[02:18:16.780 --> 02:18:20.620]  everybody's gonna know it's them and no underground fortress is gonna keep them
[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:24.180]  safe they need to understand that we blast through their paradigm we know
[02:18:24.180 --> 02:18:28.260]  the truth by the way they're having a fake event with George Bush senior George
[02:18:28.260 --> 02:18:33.140]  W. Obama and all these globalists at the White House right now and somebody
[02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:35.940]  showed me on their iPhone I went and checked it that folks looked that up and
[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:39.260]  my crew can do that meeting at the White House today and just click Google
[02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:44.660]  NSA news and they're all meeting over there because I bet you like last year
[02:18:44.660 --> 02:18:48.780]  on the Friday and Saturday when Obama and Hillary disappeared I'll bet you with
[02:18:48.780 --> 02:18:52.900]  the level of security here at the fences the barricades the SWAT teams the
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:56.860]  the Bivwaks everything they got set up there is some big wigs there's some big

[02:19:02.820 --> 02:19:06.900]  incredibly important Rob do guys you got any comments on that well I think I
[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:10.340]  figured out why the Washington Post hasn't been covering Bilderberg because
[02:19:10.340 --> 02:19:14.300]  they are over at the White House Obama hosts former president's first ladies
[02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:18.260]  George W. Bush portrait unveiling so they're gonna have a portrait of the
[02:19:18.260 --> 02:19:22.260]  definitely either the first or second dumbest president in the history of the
[02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:27.100]  United States unveiling his portrait it's so incredibly important right what
[02:19:27.100 --> 02:19:32.340]  what the portrait let's talk about the portrait exactly that's what's important
[02:19:32.340 --> 02:19:37.220]  happening yet not not the fact that that over hundreds of the biggest mafia

[02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:22.020]  there's already now it looks like 200 people on this side of builders about a
[02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:25.620]  hundred over on the other entrance just really amazing and people could take
[02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:30.020]  time out of the slave grid to get over here and of course the local defense
[02:24:30.020 --> 02:24:33.180]  contractor businesses that have these wide open parking lots in other areas
[02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:37.620]  where we could park four years ago have got the police in there really freaking
[02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:42.220]  out on people and getting in their face so they're doing whatever they can to
[02:24:42.220 --> 02:24:46.740]  keep people out of here but most of the police I talked to now that'll actually
[02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:49.820]  talk to us our listeners and our awake and know what's going on and know there's
[02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:54.140]  a crime syndicate inside so that happened on tape earlier we lost our
[02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:58.940]  our call this are a live feed earlier yes so call them Aaron and tell them to
[02:24:58.940 --> 02:25:03.020]  call this camera and we'll go live on Skype on this one or maybe you can call
[02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:07.980]  their Skype ID that way doing some directing here behind the scenes we had
[02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:10.900]  a bunch of backup batteries but ended up leaving them on the RV but that happens
[02:25:10.900 --> 02:25:15.380]  in the fog of the info war let me start now so Paul Watson can get this and get
[02:25:15.380 --> 02:25:18.620]  reports out on it again I want to commend the whole team for working double
[02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:22.220]  time the crew back in Austin the crew here the crew in England everybody and
[02:25:22.220 --> 02:25:27.380]  all the listeners let me go over in my chicken scratch some of the some of the
[02:25:27.380 --> 02:25:35.300]  things that we're getting from our sources here Herman von Rupe is going
[02:25:35.300 --> 02:25:38.860]  to be here I don't know if he's on the list but he's going to be here from Jim
[02:25:38.860 --> 02:25:43.340]  Tucker source which is impeccable and they're trying to push a world bank that
[02:25:43.340 --> 02:25:46.420]  you pay all your carbon taxes to again we know this but that's what's on the
[02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:51.540]  agenda now how do they have the European Central Bank become basically the new
[02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:56.460]  global bank by imploding the countries but then posing as the savior always
[02:25:56.460 --> 02:26:02.140]  getting people basically deeper into the quicksand so so that is coming up
[02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:11.140]  continuing here we have reports on the front of something that they're very
[02:26:11.140 --> 02:26:15.260]  upset about is that their law of the sea treaty to give the UN that means the
[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:18.820]  bankers that run it control of the oceans to start taxing all the ships on
[02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:22.820]  the oceans including our waterways like rivers anything that touches an ocean
[02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:26.740]  so basically most the United States waterways including lakes that really
[02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:31.300]  are reservoirs or damp rivers under UN control allows foreign corporations to
[02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:34.300]  come in and loot everything while harassing the living daylights out of
[02:26:34.300 --> 02:26:37.780]  local fishermen and people in Mexico I've been on the Mexico the last few years
[02:26:37.780 --> 02:26:42.260]  no more little fishermen down by Cozumel in places they're not allowed to fish
[02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:46.740]  anymore they're that angry but big giant trawlers are allowed to go on the side
[02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:49.740]  of the shore and just scoop up whatever they want just just total slavery
[02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:54.300]  agenda 21 your country being handed over to foreign banks through fraud they
[02:26:54.300 --> 02:27:00.220]  create the fraud have you signed on to it they're very upset that their that
[02:27:00.220 --> 02:27:04.460]  their bank of the world is in trouble that their law of the sea treaty is in
[02:27:04.460 --> 02:27:09.220]  trouble even though they've had traders like the former senator from Tennessee
[02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:13.620]  out there pushing it they want to again accelerate the rollout of world
[02:27:13.620 --> 02:27:16.980]  government as the savior with three super blocks Asia Union European Union
[02:27:16.980 --> 02:27:22.500]  North American Union but integrate all those by stealth they are really worried
[02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:26.860]  about resurrecting their carbon tax so they're going to shift off of that but
[02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:31.800]  just say a carbon tax is needed to save endangered species we're now live on
[02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:35.700]  just in TV of the crew wants to be able to get that feed and put it up on our
[02:27:35.700 --> 02:27:39.580]  main page we've lost our connection to the great folks over at Ustream but we
[02:27:39.580 --> 02:27:43.540]  do have that just in TV feed for folks that are watching on prison planet TV
[02:27:43.540 --> 02:27:50.380]  that feed is back up and then we'll have more live feeds out here later today
[02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:55.540]  again bilgerberg was I right we've confirmed that as we broke two days
[02:27:55.540 --> 02:27:59.660]  ago that we have moles inside and that we learned the location so early and
[02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:02.540]  that there's so much media coverage though there's still somewhat of a blackout
[02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:08.620]  there's world net daily Washington Times a drudge report info wars and so many
[02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:13.140]  alternative media it's really having a big effect of the daily mail some of the
[02:28:13.140 --> 02:28:17.140]  European newspapers a bunch of mainline Canadian papers are saying hey why is our
[02:28:17.140 --> 02:28:21.620]  premier down there pushing carbon taxes agenda 21 so they're very very upset over
[02:28:21.620 --> 02:28:25.860]  that they want to accelerate internet IDs as Aaron Dykes noticed one of the
[02:28:25.860 --> 02:28:29.740]  head bilgerberg people a government regulator of the EU was calling for a
[02:28:29.740 --> 02:28:33.780]  few weeks ago that is confirmed a big agenda they want that people to tax the
[02:28:33.780 --> 02:28:38.020]  web selectively force people over to internet to it's highly surveilled and
[02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:42.660]  curtailed that's a big part of the plan you're getting directly from the moles
[02:28:42.660 --> 02:28:47.420]  okay integrated from four different sources Jim Tucker's mole are three
[02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:50.620]  moles and of course I should add you also know that that's the one does have
[02:28:50.620 --> 02:28:57.300]  some connections into the highest banking order again they do want a war but
[02:28:57.300 --> 02:29:02.060]  they don't know how to shell it and the military the US military keeps balking at
[02:29:02.060 --> 02:29:06.900]  it explaining that it's gonna unravel Russia threatening a nuke if any of
[02:29:06.900 --> 02:29:10.420]  these big wars start or if any more missiles are rolled into Eastern Europe
[02:29:10.420 --> 02:29:14.060]  that's got the globalist concern not that rush is good either it's all corrupt
[02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:17.900]  big governments China they're all in double deals with each other all these
[02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:22.620]  groups are interlocking but all busy stabbing each other in the back as well
[02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:26.540]  man I've been sweating so bad that a bunch of this this writing got messed up
[02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:31.420]  in my back pocket continuing here we're gonna go to break and come back we're

[02:33:20.580 --> 02:33:23.700]  guys queue up Rod Serling I think he makes a good point here I think Rod
[02:33:23.700 --> 02:33:27.700]  Serling you hated tyranny on record should be with us here at Bilderberg
[02:33:27.700 --> 02:33:32.820]  2012 so queue that up we're gonna play that here for folks and then get into
[02:33:32.820 --> 02:33:36.660]  some of their other agenda points and get Rob do's take on it after Paul Watson

[02:34:08.700 --> 02:34:22.580]  gonna go back into the agenda and the other stuff no but that's fine though
[02:34:22.580 --> 02:34:26.900]  we're gonna play it so stop the music cue it back up to the Rod Serling intro
[02:34:26.900 --> 02:34:31.260]  and because I liked it I like here we're coming into Rod Serling and we had two
[02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:35.460]  toothed tube hoppers playing which is great this is live this is awesome for
[02:34:35.460 --> 02:34:40.140]  good luck we're gonna play Rod Serling so we just stopped the computer and then
[02:34:40.140 --> 02:34:44.820]  we cue up Rod Serling and we play it so now an obsessive compulsive thing I
[02:34:44.820 --> 02:34:47.700]  absolutely must have
[02:34:48.060 --> 02:34:54.420]  oh boy walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future not a
[02:34:54.420 --> 02:35:00.540]  future that will be but one that might be this is not a new world it is simply
[02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:05.940]  an extension of what began in the old one it is patterned itself after every
[02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:09.820]  dictator who was ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of
[02:35:09.820 --> 02:35:15.700]  history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances
[02:35:15.700 --> 02:35:21.140]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like
[02:35:21.140 --> 02:35:26.940]  every one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic
[02:35:26.940 --> 02:35:30.700]  is an enemy and truth is a menace
[02:35:37.940 --> 02:35:48.660]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:35:51.260 --> 02:35:55.300]  all right that is beautiful I had to hear that I mean it's bad luck to have
[02:35:55.300 --> 02:36:00.100]  Rod Serling started and cut him off that's the only person I want to rub
[02:36:00.100 --> 02:36:03.700]  all right going back to the crew here I've got some other points I want to make
[02:36:03.700 --> 02:36:07.620]  but before I get into my other notes I haven't covered yet and there's more
[02:36:07.620 --> 02:36:12.620]  breaking Paul Watson any comments on what we're seeing and how historical this
[02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:18.300]  is Alex is completely historic is the biggest protest against Bilderberg ever
[02:36:18.300 --> 02:36:22.020]  they fear the spotlight that's what we're giving them and people don't
[02:36:22.020 --> 02:36:25.820]  understand the extent to which people go I mean you were talking to some sniveling
[02:36:25.820 --> 02:36:29.100]  mainstream media journalist earlier who was saying oh what do you get out of this
[02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:33.340]  what do we get out of this I mean people spend thousands of dollars they get two
[02:36:33.340 --> 02:36:38.300]  hours sleep and I yeah it's fun but it's damn hard work and we're doing what we
[02:36:38.300 --> 02:36:43.220]  can because the mainstream media refuses to cover it so don't put it back on us
[02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:45.980]  let's point the finger at the real criminal right what do we get out of
[02:36:45.980 --> 02:36:51.100]  this yeah it's people down here I mean I agree with you what do we got this we
[02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:54.380]  get freedom we get our second amendment we don't have drones looking through our
[02:36:54.380 --> 02:36:58.900]  back bedrooms we don't have government saying what size toilet we can have
[02:36:58.900 --> 02:37:03.780]  Mayor Bloomberg saying you can't have over a 12 ounce drink now and again the
[02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:07.300]  sugar is not good but it's the GMO that's really killing us they're like
[02:37:07.300 --> 02:37:12.180]  everybody's starting to die ban sugar ban big coax what about the mercury and
[02:37:12.180 --> 02:37:17.260]  and stuff that's in those coax ban big coffees ban salt tell us the light
[02:37:17.260 --> 02:37:20.940]  bulbs and toilets we can have home inspections they ban free speech and
[02:37:20.940 --> 02:37:26.020]  Australia 1.1 million dollar fines if you criticize the carbon tax check
[02:37:26.020 --> 02:37:29.740]  points everywhere TSA going down our pants have you looked around tyranny
[02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:34.140]  in funding and I was shocked I thought it was like Wonka or something because
[02:37:34.140 --> 02:37:36.820]  they you know like the Democrats have had really stupid questions and these
[02:37:36.820 --> 02:37:40.540]  guys are like Alex Jans you're making a lot of money off this aren't you I looked
[02:37:40.540 --> 02:37:43.820]  at a guy I said yeah we've been successful we're trying to build a
[02:37:43.820 --> 02:37:46.940]  media organization we're trying to build something to counter the globalist I
[02:37:46.940 --> 02:37:50.660]  mean I believe in what I'm saying I don't want a world government I don't want a new
[02:37:50.660 --> 02:37:54.740]  world order the Bilderberg is real and they're like oh yeah they were so powerful
[02:37:54.740 --> 02:37:59.500]  why are you like a protest and it's just it's like you're the libertarian big
[02:37:59.500 --> 02:38:05.340]  guys you're supposedly Tucker Carlson I remember Adam Kokesh with Adam versus
[02:38:05.340 --> 02:38:11.020]  the man back during the Iowa caucuses but they come up and start talking to him
[02:38:11.020 --> 02:38:15.620]  and he looks at me goes you're with Alex Jones he's he's bleeping scary and
[02:38:15.620 --> 02:38:19.900]  starts cussing and they're like no we're not with Alex Jones and he just starts
[02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:24.620]  freaking out and and blowing up and if they're still here I'll talk to them now
[02:38:24.620 --> 02:38:27.740]  I've just gotten here and they're like shoving a camera in my face and I'm like
[02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:32.380]  I'm here exposing a global mafia that openly says the UN's gonna run our
[02:38:32.380 --> 02:38:36.780]  military now the Secretary of Defense is telling Congress that the world
[02:38:36.780 --> 02:38:41.660]  government is openly being announced and there's some sniveling Tucker Carlson
[02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:48.060]  people with a feminine disgust frothing in my face with real palpable shaking
[02:38:48.060 --> 02:38:52.460]  anger and I'm like I'm mad at the Bilderberg group but not even as mad as
[02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:57.500]  you are at me you're just mad because you're a bunch of cynical establishment
[02:38:57.500 --> 02:39:02.980]  fake left-right paradigm suck ups who see libertarian freedom as a market and
[02:39:02.980 --> 02:39:07.660]  you're mad that we're bigger than you and you're obsessed with money so you're
[02:39:07.660 --> 02:39:11.740]  like I bet you're making a lot of money yeah you know what folks we do need to be
[02:39:11.740 --> 02:39:16.540]  strong we need to hire more reporters we need to to if people actually spent
[02:39:16.540 --> 02:39:19.660]  their money and bought nothing but organic and spent their money and bought
[02:39:19.660 --> 02:39:22.980]  more guns as they're doing we would defeat these people just by the checkmate
[02:39:22.980 --> 02:39:26.740]  of hundreds of millions of guns getting purchased the last 10 years I mean we are
[02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:29.980]  winning liberty is still popular that's why they want to shut down the free
[02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:34.020]  market because if people start funding liberty with their purchases and with
[02:39:34.020 --> 02:39:38.180]  their word of mouth it's over we've got people power the globalists want a
[02:39:38.180 --> 02:39:43.700]  mega monopoly over media over money over energy to shut us down so that we
[02:39:43.700 --> 02:39:47.220]  can't struggle and they're trying to get the vice grips the straight jacket on
[02:39:47.220 --> 02:39:50.740]  us now they're trying to put the chains on us but we woke up we're saying you're
[02:39:50.740 --> 02:39:53.300]  not putting those chains on me and they're like how dare you not want to
[02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:56.740]  put chains on yourself how much money are you making out of this they want to
[02:39:56.740 --> 02:40:00.740]  change the subject they're desperate they said none of this existed but the
[02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:05.100]  minute robber barons who want to be little media people like Tucker Carlson
[02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:09.380]  aren't able to co-op the Liberty Movement and aren't able to co-op Ron
[02:40:09.380 --> 02:40:14.580]  Paul as they've tried to do they fail and they fail miserably and the truth is
[02:40:14.580 --> 02:40:18.700]  the people are waking up from across the political spectrum and they know the
[02:40:18.700 --> 02:40:21.580]  truth and there's no putting the genie back in the bottle pull watch and
[02:40:21.580 --> 02:40:25.940]  continue and it's the same on the left I mean it's like Laurence O'Donnell says
[02:40:25.940 --> 02:40:29.420]  to Luke Radowski well the Bilderberg group have never heard it therefore it
[02:40:29.420 --> 02:40:32.580]  must not have any significance whatsoever just because him and his
[02:40:32.580 --> 02:40:36.340]  sneering arrogance doesn't even know what it is that must render it
[02:40:36.340 --> 02:40:40.380]  automatically obsolete so it's the same on the fake right with a you know
[02:40:40.380 --> 02:40:44.700]  conservative Tucker Carlson same on the fake left and I just applaud all the
[02:40:44.700 --> 02:40:48.100]  people who are there because they've gone through the stress the hassle they've
[02:40:48.100 --> 02:40:52.500]  spent thousands of dollars and it's a slog it's hard work I know because I did
[02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:56.740]  it last year so I applaud everyone exactly but it's not just it's not just
[02:40:56.740 --> 02:41:01.020]  it it's not just that they asked me sarcastic mean questions it was the
[02:41:01.020 --> 02:41:05.460]  demonic it's not even it's an insult to women it wasn't a feminine it was that
[02:41:05.460 --> 02:41:11.020]  it was that metro sexual type male who he's like they're demons they
[02:41:11.020 --> 02:41:15.420]  recognize that we're not demons like well get you from the gates of hell you
[02:41:15.420 --> 02:41:19.500]  know and like no wonder Tucker Carlson scared because they know we're not
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:24.660]  demons he's like he's scary because I mean you know it's like we see them we
[02:41:24.660 --> 02:41:29.620]  see you hello my little friend mama don't like cattle tails I've come here to
[02:41:29.620 --> 02:41:33.460]  do two things that's kick-ass and chew bubble gum and I'm all out of bubble
[02:41:33.460 --> 02:41:37.660]  gum yeah Alex I noticed a lot of people out there have their sunglasses on so
[02:41:37.660 --> 02:41:42.020]  they can see and we know that they live right now and I think it's deplorable
[02:41:42.020 --> 02:41:45.620]  and that was a little sugar Carlson's little turd that was out here totally
[02:41:45.620 --> 02:41:50.020]  little was a little Bilderberg bottom-feeder how many no big contracts
[02:41:50.020 --> 02:41:57.580]  was shaking with hatred was it Carlson or one of these minions
[02:41:57.580 --> 02:42:05.300]  no literally yes I'm crazy dear so many sweet children out here with their
[02:42:05.300 --> 02:42:11.180]  parents all right I'm over here doing Tucker Carlson minion imitations when
[02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:14.540]  it's ridiculous they try to get you right as you walk up and they want to
[02:42:14.540 --> 02:42:18.380]  ask you those types of questions and turn the focus on how much money you're
[02:42:18.380 --> 02:42:21.820]  making off of this yeah this is a money-making operation but you know what
[02:42:21.820 --> 02:42:25.900]  there's no corporate sponsorship going on here there's nobody above Alex Jones
[02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:30.140]  Alex Jones is where the buck stops and he's out there in the field right now
[02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:35.300]  making stuff happen exactly they want to change the subject as if ABC and MSNBC
[02:42:35.300 --> 02:42:40.180]  with the Lockheed Martin funding and General Electric again it's ridiculous I
[02:42:40.180 --> 02:42:43.820]  just laugh at them so again I haven't even last few days plugged any products

[02:45:01.100 --> 02:45:06.300]  right this is basically the civil society of the NATO alliance and it was
[02:45:06.300 --> 02:45:10.700]  started by the Nazi prince Bernhard of Holland who was an official member of
[02:45:10.700 --> 02:45:17.220]  the SA and the SS and he was joined then by others his his close friend of course
[02:45:17.220 --> 02:45:21.340]  Prince Philip of Britain the guy who wants to come back and kill people in the
[02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:26.540]  form of a of a deadly virus and over the years you get a certain amount of
[02:45:26.540 --> 02:45:32.020]  European feudal aristocracy you get bankers you get finance oligarchs
[02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:35.940]  financiers right this is the essence of the problem of the world a private
[02:45:35.940 --> 02:45:40.420]  network that controls governments that's the human condition a private
[02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:45.180]  network of bankers and of course you don't you don't want to go for the cape
[02:45:45.180 --> 02:45:49.500]  you want to go for the Matador and the Matador is the private network that

[02:49:12.900 --> 02:49:21.980]  sorry but I got a bullhorn them when they come by hey Alex I found an
[02:49:21.980 --> 02:49:27.420]  interesting name on the list from Russia really we got a Rusky on that Gary
[02:49:27.420 --> 02:49:34.860]  Kasparov the chess champion right there are you getting the bankers over here
[02:49:34.860 --> 02:49:46.860]  yes sir yeah I'll take over anyway Gary Kasparov the chess champion is also
[02:49:46.860 --> 02:49:51.700]  chairman of the United Civil Front of Russia and at first I didn't believe it
[02:49:51.700 --> 02:49:55.860]  was the chess champion and I looked it up with you know adding United Civil
[02:49:55.860 --> 02:50:01.500]  Front on there and and there he is you know he'd be in 2005 he ended his chess
[02:50:01.500 --> 02:50:06.460]  career isn't it no what was that Paul he's anti Putin given the fact they're
[02:50:06.460 --> 02:50:10.180]  talking about Russia he's a political opponent of Vladimir Putin well there
[02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:13.180]  you go that can make sense that there maybe they're positioning him to come
[02:50:13.180 --> 02:50:17.420]  in he's got name recognition to maybe come in and asked Putin at some point
[02:50:17.420 --> 02:50:22.660]  because they already they tried an invasion during a Bush's term with a
[02:50:22.660 --> 02:50:25.780]  Dick Cheney leading that I've tried the color revolution as well haven't they
[02:50:25.780 --> 02:50:31.740]  exactly and now they're picking people up for I guess spitting on portraits of
[02:50:31.740 --> 02:50:36.340]  Putin or any kind of protests now they're grabbing people and throwing them
[02:50:36.340 --> 02:50:40.860]  in jail so it's it's definitely the same old Russia that we remember back in the
[02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:47.220]  80s with the Cold War here's an interesting one Harris Britt or Britt
[02:50:47.220 --> 02:50:52.340]  Harris CIO of teacher retirement systems of Texas I wonder what they're
[02:50:52.340 --> 02:50:55.620]  planning on doing with the teacher retirement system you know everybody
[02:50:55.620 --> 02:50:58.660]  that's a teacher here that I know my wife works out of high school and
[02:50:58.660 --> 02:51:02.740]  everybody that's a teacher here they love their retirements all they talk
[02:51:02.740 --> 02:51:06.500]  about is their retirement and so this could be some way you know they're
[02:51:06.500 --> 02:51:10.260]  looking to maybe take some of that money because it's good it's very lucrative in
[02:51:10.260 --> 02:51:13.100]  fact I'm gonna look up and see how much the retirement age and like they've done
[02:51:13.100 --> 02:51:16.780]  in Europe possibly totally yeah yeah have the teachers working till they're 80
[02:51:16.780 --> 02:51:20.940]  because it's not a out in the Sun type of job and and then when they go to
[02:51:20.940 --> 02:51:25.820]  collect oh it won't be there and that's what I keep telling my wife I say you
[02:51:25.820 --> 02:51:29.620]  got to be careful be sure you diversify because it may not be there when you go
[02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:37.820]  to collect yeah completely yeah teacher retirement system of Texas a newbies on
[02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:40.780]  there from what I can see I'm gonna have to go through the whole list there are
[02:51:40.780 --> 02:51:45.060]  it's some interesting stuff I was I was surprised to see the chess champion on
[02:51:45.060 --> 02:51:50.380]  there Jessica T Matthews president of the car date and Carnegie endowment for
[02:51:50.380 --> 02:51:58.060]  international peace we know that let's see she is right there if you watch the
[02:51:58.060 --> 02:52:02.340]  the piece we did on Charlotte is or be when they first form the Carnegie
[02:52:02.340 --> 02:52:05.140]  endowment for international peace one of the first things they did was write a
[02:52:05.140 --> 02:52:08.580]  letter to Woodrow Wilson telling him not to end the war too early does that
[02:52:08.580 --> 02:52:13.900]  sound like international peace institutes always pushing war I mean with
[02:52:13.900 --> 02:52:17.500]  Brookings Institute they're represented at Bilderberg they've been pushing the
[02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:22.220]  attack on Syria that's just an example of hiding in plain sight we create
[02:52:22.220 --> 02:52:25.180]  something called the endowment for international peace yet we are pushing
[02:52:25.180 --> 02:52:29.820]  for war and we have a direct in line into the president during World War one
[02:52:29.820 --> 02:52:33.620]  telling him to continue the war not to stop it too early because we need to
[02:52:33.620 --> 02:52:36.980]  make changes in America and the changes they were talking about were changing us
[02:52:36.980 --> 02:52:41.820]  from a more of an independent nation to a collectivist nation and you can see
[02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:44.540]  that's where we're at now that's why we have Jack booted thugs everywhere in
[02:52:44.540 --> 02:52:50.460]  potbellied pedophile TSA agents groping us yeah while pastors are getting thrown
[02:52:50.460 --> 02:52:54.100]  in jail for saying spanky kids to discipline them we covered that last
[02:52:54.100 --> 02:52:57.900]  night on the Info Wars Nightly News and tonight Mike Adams will be there and
[02:52:57.900 --> 02:53:01.180]  also I guess we're gonna be going live there's looks like there's somebody
[02:53:01.180 --> 02:53:07.940]  oh taking a cab let's be one of the poor billionaires going in today let's see
[02:53:07.940 --> 02:53:12.620]  did you cover John Kerry's gonna be there yeah covered John Kerry of course
[02:53:12.620 --> 02:53:17.740]  Edwards was picked as his running mate by Bilderberg's right by Johnson and the
[02:53:17.740 --> 02:53:21.980]  Logan act by James a Johnson violate in the Logan acts we call James a Johnson
[02:53:21.980 --> 02:53:24.940]  the vice-king maker because he seems to be the one that picks out these vice
[02:53:24.940 --> 02:53:28.460]  presidents all the time and he'll probably be picking out this year's guys
[02:53:28.460 --> 02:53:34.380]  got a man just a minute okay who's who's another one oh here's another one from
[02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:39.140]  from California CEO of Palin tier technologies if you don't know from the
[02:53:39.140 --> 02:53:44.100]  Lord of the Rings the Palin tier was the all-seeing I and his name is Alexander
[02:53:44.100 --> 02:53:50.460]  Karp interesting he formed his company with people from PayPal and there was
[02:53:50.460 --> 02:53:54.820]  something else I had something up on them PayPal and Stanford computer
[02:53:54.820 --> 02:53:59.060]  scientists so these guys are definitely and they they have two products
[02:53:59.060 --> 02:54:02.460]  Palin tier government and Palin tier finance basically they're a think tank
[02:54:02.460 --> 02:54:07.900]  and they help people do things with their money mega billionaires so they're
[02:54:07.900 --> 02:54:12.180]  there either either putting people together or making their own network so
[02:54:12.180 --> 02:54:17.940]  they can you know keep their chokehold grip on on the world on the world
[02:54:17.940 --> 02:54:21.020]  economy as you can see it's imploding right now and I think they're very happy

[03:02:36.540 --> 03:02:40.100]  upset about what's going on because like I said in the past they are going to be
[03:02:40.100 --> 03:02:45.220]  exposed bigger and better than ever this time around well said Richard I think

[03:03:07.020 --> 03:03:10.660]  stupid questions and I agree with you one final point it's almost better when
[03:03:10.660 --> 03:03:13.460]  the mainstream corporate press doesn't cover it because it just further
[03:03:13.460 --> 03:03:17.780]  discredits them and everybody worldwide is seeing this and that's why the
[03:03:17.780 --> 03:03:21.900]  mainstream media that the old stream devil stream death stream media the
[03:03:21.900 --> 03:03:26.940]  cess stream media the Decepticon media the is so upset because they don't have
