[00:00.000 --> 00:15.320]  You are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals.
[00:15.320 --> 00:19.760]  Does that sound like something you are behind?
[00:19.760 --> 00:25.600]  Well, I haven't heard that, but is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing?
[00:25.600 --> 00:33.240]  Marina Abranovic is a superstar with every weird, twisted Hollywood, D.C. or New York
[00:33.240 --> 00:35.520]  lowlife.
[00:35.520 --> 00:40.040]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and jury absentee.
[00:40.040 --> 00:42.800]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[00:42.800 --> 00:48.280]  Maxwell participated with and assisted Epstein in maintaining and protecting his sex trafficking
[00:48.280 --> 00:53.160]  ring, ensuring that approximately three girls a day were made available to him.
[00:53.160 --> 01:06.480]  Trump has signed executive orders to expand the introduction of human trafficking.
[01:06.480 --> 01:07.480]  It's exploded.
[01:07.480 --> 01:11.480]  He's got the Navy and the Army involved stopping it, and they're having huge busts of small
[01:11.480 --> 01:12.480]  children kidnapped.
[01:12.480 --> 01:17.040]  Operation Cross Country led to the arrest of 120 human traffickers.
[01:17.040 --> 01:20.160]  One of the victims was just three months old.
[01:20.160 --> 01:22.160]  124 arrests.
[01:22.160 --> 01:26.400]  339 criminal arrests were made across the state.
[01:26.400 --> 01:30.040]  84 underage boys and girls forced into prostitution.
[01:30.040 --> 01:35.360]  Terrorist deputies have announced the arrest of 25 people accused of traveling to have
[01:35.360 --> 01:36.360]  sex with a child.
[01:36.360 --> 01:41.160]  Tonight, more than half a dozen accused child sexual predators are off the street.
[01:41.160 --> 01:46.600]  One trafficker was arrested after making a deal with an undercover agent to sell a three-month-old
[01:46.600 --> 01:49.480]  girl and her five-year-old sister for sex.
[01:49.480 --> 01:51.760]  Human sex trafficking of juveniles.
[01:51.760 --> 01:58.000]  I am prepared to bring the full force and weight of our government that we can do in
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.200]  order to solve this horrific problem.
[02:00.200 --> 02:05.760]  The whole Clinton system is just littered with pedophiles and Tony Podesta running full-page
[02:05.760 --> 02:08.480]  articles about how he loves art of naked children.
[02:08.480 --> 02:12.200]  They're throwing it in our face.
[02:12.200 --> 02:24.120]  It's Friday, August 21st, the year is 2020.
[02:24.120 --> 02:28.360]  We're taking the gloves off of the deep state of their satanic pedophile networks.
[02:28.360 --> 02:33.760]  That house of cards is coming down, but the enemy is striking back.
[02:33.760 --> 02:37.920]  Now that we've drugged them from the darkness into the light of high noon, they're attempting
[02:37.920 --> 02:46.200]  to collapse the world economy and create religious and race war to distract from their crimes.
[02:46.200 --> 02:47.760]  It will not work.
[02:47.760 --> 02:50.760]  It will not happen.
[02:50.760 --> 02:54.480]  I started making a film a few months ago about Bill Gates and COVID-19, and it's ending
[02:54.480 --> 02:57.800]  up being a film about the shadow network in Jeffrey Epstein, because that's where it leads
[02:57.800 --> 02:58.800]  back to.
[02:58.800 --> 03:01.040]  And of course, Bill Gates is involved.
[03:01.040 --> 03:03.560]  They're not just raping children.
[03:03.560 --> 03:05.440]  They're poisoning them with tainted vaccines.
[03:05.440 --> 03:07.720]  They're keeping them alive after they're aborted.
[03:07.720 --> 03:12.840]  It's a whole system based on murdering and killing and disease and absolutely torturing
[03:12.840 --> 03:17.280]  our most defenseless.
[03:17.280 --> 03:20.440]  And going through all these clips, I have all the clips from five years ago, four years
[03:20.440 --> 03:24.520]  ago, three years ago, when there's no such thing as pedophilia, there's no networks
[03:24.520 --> 03:29.360]  of pedophiles, there's no kids kidnapped, there's no sex slavery, and I went back and
[03:29.360 --> 03:30.640]  researched it.
[03:30.640 --> 03:38.120]  The U.N. is a giant child and kidnapped woman sex trafficking operation.
[03:38.120 --> 03:40.160]  There's a big story at NationalFile.com.
[03:40.160 --> 03:45.160]  It's also on Infowars.com, where they're making a big deal about all these shows, sexualized
[03:45.160 --> 03:46.280]  10-year-old girls.
[03:46.280 --> 03:51.120]  My God, they have programs because, you know, be tough for little boys.
[03:51.120 --> 03:57.760]  They can take it with these vampire-like men dressed up like women leading the children
[03:57.760 --> 04:04.120]  in and saying, oh, this kid's a top, that means he's pitching, and, oh, we're going
[04:04.120 --> 04:09.920]  to have 10-year-old boys having sex with other boys that call themselves women.
[04:09.920 --> 04:20.280]  Just out in the open, on TV, the dungeon keepers leading the children in drag queen story time.
[04:20.280 --> 04:25.680]  And this is their total, full, out-of-control assault.
[04:25.680 --> 04:29.000]  Now, that's a short video we just put out.
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.920]  We're going to put a longer one out that has even more of the information in it, a band
[04:32.920 --> 04:33.920]  on video.
[04:33.920 --> 04:38.400]  Roderstone's got big breaking news on why the ban indictment is so important, and a
[04:38.400 --> 04:42.120]  bunch of other breaking political news at the bottom of the hour, he's going to be joining
[04:42.120 --> 04:43.120]  us.
[04:43.120 --> 04:48.640]  And then we've got other special guests coming up today, and a ton of news, so much more
[04:48.640 --> 04:53.120]  to cover, and the whole COVID brainwashing straight jacket going on even tighter.
[04:53.120 --> 04:58.480]  It's all coming up on this live August 21st global transmission.
[04:58.480 --> 05:04.200]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government.
[05:04.200 --> 05:07.520]  But world government is only the control grid.
[05:07.520 --> 05:13.440]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods
[05:13.440 --> 05:14.440]  and attain immortality.
[05:14.440 --> 05:20.640]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based
[05:20.640 --> 05:21.640]  line forms.
[05:21.640 --> 05:24.240]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[05:24.240 --> 05:27.960]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[05:27.960 --> 05:29.840]  They are plain God.
[05:29.840 --> 05:36.600]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[05:36.600 --> 05:39.600]  to carry out this transformation.
[05:39.600 --> 05:43.960]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on
[05:43.960 --> 05:45.040]  record.
[05:45.040 --> 05:47.480]  You have been warned.
[05:47.480 --> 05:52.000]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.600]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[05:55.600 --> 06:04.160]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[06:04.160 --> 06:06.080]  What happened to Joe Biden?
[06:06.080 --> 06:10.440]  He first pointed out two years ago that over 91 for being an eloquent speaker and not being
[06:10.440 --> 06:12.600]  able to form a single sentence.
[06:12.600 --> 06:15.920]  It was the reason I was banned again from Facebook.
[06:15.920 --> 06:21.320]  They said not even a common mention can be positive.
[06:21.320 --> 06:22.920]  You will be banned as well.
[06:22.920 --> 06:30.000]  We were honored because we knew in the test of time you would become completely delirious
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.560]  and we would be proven right again and it's happened.
[06:32.560 --> 06:37.360]  Here is some of the new ads that Trump's putting out on this issue and the crime wave on this
[06:37.360 --> 06:43.480]  live Friday broadcast.
[06:43.480 --> 06:52.400]  He went, he became president, I didn't go and I'm still vice president.
[06:52.400 --> 07:01.600]  In addition to that, we have to make sure that we are in a position that we are...
[07:01.600 --> 07:03.840]  Think about it.
[07:03.840 --> 07:07.040]  Everybody is known from day one.
[07:07.040 --> 07:09.960]  How smart, how bright Hillary is.
[07:09.960 --> 07:13.960]  Everybody knows how tough she is.
[07:13.960 --> 07:23.160]  You know the rapidly rising in with, I don't know.
[07:23.160 --> 07:25.880]  So be successful.
[07:25.880 --> 07:29.120]  I sincerely hope some of you become millionaires and billionaires.
[07:29.120 --> 07:31.200]  I mean that.
[07:31.200 --> 07:33.600]  But engage.
[07:33.600 --> 07:41.760]  You know there's a during World War II where Roosevelt came up with a thing that was totally
[07:41.760 --> 08:02.680]  different than he called it, you know, Commander in Chief, it's more than just a job.
[08:02.680 --> 08:08.000]  Since taking office, President Donald Trump has rebuilt our military, repaired a broken
[08:08.000 --> 08:14.000]  V.A. and eliminated Soleimani, al-Baghdadi, ISIS, the world's deadliest terrorists brought
[08:14.000 --> 08:15.000]  to justice.
[08:15.000 --> 08:21.000]  Today, America is safer and stronger than ever because to President Trump, it's more than
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  just a job, it's a sworn duty to keep America safe.
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
[08:29.000 --> 08:38.000]  Correct their, their, their, their, their force and peaceful protesters.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.360]  The vast majority of the protesters are peaceful.
[08:41.360 --> 08:44.440]  And they're going to point people off the street to make it seem like there are problems
[08:44.440 --> 08:47.560]  going on when all that's happening are peaceful protests.
[08:47.560 --> 08:51.760]  And our peaceful protesters' ability to get out at night.
[08:51.760 --> 08:53.480]  Most of these protests have been peaceful.
[08:53.480 --> 08:55.000]  I applaud these protesters.
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  This majority of these protesters are peaceful, they have been peaceful for weeks.
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  It has continued for the most part peaceful.
[09:02.000 --> 09:03.000]  It was peaceful.
[09:03.000 --> 09:29.000]  We had a number of peaceful protests.
[09:29.000 --> 09:35.720]  Working class, middle class and rich neighborhoods and screaming, we're going to take your house,
[09:35.720 --> 09:41.000]  we're going to kill you, we're going to burn your house down.
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.720]  And it goes on and on and on.
[09:46.720 --> 09:50.960]  And there's footage of Joe Biden's supporter stealing a seven-year-old boy's mega hat and
[09:50.960 --> 09:55.480]  attacking his mother.
[09:55.480 --> 09:59.400]  Where's that footage?
[09:59.400 --> 10:04.480]  These are women attacking other women.
[10:04.480 --> 10:05.480]  Did you drop my property?
[10:05.480 --> 10:06.480]  Did you drop my property?
[10:06.480 --> 10:07.480]  Are you destroying my property?
[10:07.480 --> 10:08.480]  Yes, we are.
[10:08.480 --> 10:09.480]  You know that's a felony?
[10:09.480 --> 10:13.480]  These are women attacking a mother and her child that had pro-Trump signs.
[10:13.480 --> 10:15.480]  Get it, let him get it.
[10:15.480 --> 10:16.480]  Touch my hat.
[10:16.480 --> 10:18.480]  Now they punch her.
[10:18.480 --> 10:23.480]  We've got to have more demonstrations with Trump signs than in forward signs.
[10:23.480 --> 10:24.480]  Get your hat back, baby.
[10:24.480 --> 10:25.480]  But just attack your little girl.
[10:25.480 --> 10:26.480]  Get your hat back, baby.
[10:26.480 --> 10:27.480]  Get your hat back, baby.
[10:27.480 --> 10:28.480]  I want to give this lady a job.
[10:28.480 --> 10:29.480]  I like the fact that she's got something.
[10:29.480 --> 10:30.480]  Give me back my hat.
[10:30.480 --> 10:31.480]  Give me back my hat.
[10:31.480 --> 10:32.480]  Give me back my hat.
[10:32.480 --> 10:33.480]  These are the slaves when they were older.
[10:33.480 --> 10:34.480]  Give me back my hat.
[10:34.480 --> 10:35.480]  That mask-wearing idiot.
[10:35.480 --> 10:36.480]  Give me back my hat.
[10:36.480 --> 10:37.480]  I'm telling you right now.
[10:37.480 --> 10:38.480]  You're going to steal my property?
[10:38.480 --> 10:39.480]  I'll call you in your car and get your license plate.
[10:39.480 --> 10:40.480]  Yeah, you what?
[10:40.480 --> 10:51.480]  You slapped my kid in the head and you're going to get your job right.
[10:51.480 --> 10:56.480]  Then you're going to get them lucky if your head doesn't start bouncing off concrete.
[10:56.480 --> 10:58.480]  Don't care if they're a man or a woman.
[10:58.480 --> 11:00.480]  Taylor, these people right here are taking your hat.
[11:00.480 --> 11:02.480]  They attacked my son.
[11:02.480 --> 11:05.480]  Everybody should just beat their ass for that, man.
[11:05.480 --> 11:06.480]  I have it on video.
[11:06.480 --> 11:07.480]  Trash.
[11:07.480 --> 11:08.480]  I have it on video.
[11:08.480 --> 11:09.480]  I have it on video.
[11:09.480 --> 11:10.480]  Smack.
[11:10.480 --> 11:11.480]  I have it on video.
[11:11.480 --> 11:13.480]  That's why they attack women, though.
[11:13.480 --> 11:14.480]  Women attack women.
[11:14.480 --> 11:15.480]  Men attack women.
[11:15.480 --> 11:16.480]  Because the left are cowards.
[11:16.480 --> 11:17.480]  I'm holding on video.
[11:17.480 --> 11:19.480]  I got the whole thing on video.
[11:19.480 --> 11:22.480]  They have no empathy.
[11:22.480 --> 11:23.480]  No reality.
[11:23.480 --> 11:24.480]  I like this.
[11:24.480 --> 11:25.480]  Yeah, look at this.
[11:25.480 --> 11:26.480]  Men trying to take the back peacefully.
[11:26.480 --> 11:27.480]  She's attacking them.
[11:27.480 --> 11:28.480]  Knock her upside the head, man.
[11:28.480 --> 11:29.480]  She's in a man's world.
[11:29.480 --> 11:30.480]  You want to smoke or punch me?
[11:30.480 --> 11:31.480]  But you know people are fighting back now.
[11:31.480 --> 11:32.480]  And she throws over the fence.
[11:32.480 --> 11:33.480]  I saw you trying to punch me.
[11:33.480 --> 11:34.480]  I saw you trying to punch me.
[11:34.480 --> 11:35.480]  I wish you would.
[11:35.480 --> 11:36.480]  They will beat the girls and beat you up.
[11:36.480 --> 11:37.480]  Ask the fuck out of me.
[11:37.480 --> 11:38.480]  What the fuck is that?
[11:38.480 --> 11:53.480]  I saw you trying to punch me.
[11:53.480 --> 11:56.480]  These are the weak-minded people, folks.
[11:56.480 --> 11:57.480]  I'm not trying to hit you.
[11:57.480 --> 11:58.480]  I'm not trying to fight you.
[11:58.480 --> 11:59.480]  You're coming after me.
[11:59.480 --> 12:00.480]  I'm not afraid of you.
[12:00.480 --> 12:01.480]  I'm not afraid of you.
[12:01.480 --> 12:02.480]  I'm not afraid of you.
[12:02.480 --> 12:03.480]  I'm not afraid of you.
[12:03.480 --> 12:04.480]  What's up?
[12:04.480 --> 12:05.480]  What's up?
[12:05.480 --> 12:06.480]  She came after my song.
[12:06.480 --> 12:07.480]  I have it on video.
[12:07.480 --> 12:08.480]  She came after my son.
[12:08.480 --> 12:09.480]  What the fuck is that?
[12:09.480 --> 12:10.480]  It knows they attack a child.
[12:10.480 --> 12:12.480]  Now she's attacking again.
[12:12.480 --> 12:17.480]  And they punch them and then say they're not punching.
[12:17.480 --> 12:22.480]  The video is on infowars.com.
[12:22.480 --> 12:25.480]  This is the globalist project to collapse the country.
[12:25.480 --> 12:29.480]  And even Call of Duty has come out with a new video about it,
[12:29.480 --> 12:31.480]  pointing out that it was what the Soviets tried to do here.
[12:31.480 --> 12:34.480]  But if you understand, the globalist has already taken over Russia.
[12:34.480 --> 12:35.480]  So it's not the Russians that did it.
[12:35.480 --> 12:36.480]  And it's not about defending Russians.
[12:36.480 --> 12:40.480]  If the Russians did it, if the Russians, I'm not going to say they're not that smart,
[12:40.480 --> 12:44.480]  but if the Russians did this, I'd blame the Russians.
[12:44.480 --> 12:50.480]  It was the globalist, the proto-left, that overthrew Russia and did to them what they're
[12:50.480 --> 12:52.480]  trying to do here.
[12:52.480 --> 12:53.480]  Period.
[12:53.480 --> 12:56.480]  They couldn't get the Russians to break up their families.
[12:56.480 --> 12:59.480]  They couldn't get the Russians to do as much as they've gotten us to do.
[12:59.480 --> 13:01.480]  I'll be honest with you.
[13:01.480 --> 13:03.480]  And so the Russians have an understanding of this now.
[13:03.480 --> 13:08.480]  Why the Hollywood trash and the New World Order is so upset, because if the U.S.
[13:08.480 --> 13:11.480]  and Russia get together, like General Flynn wanted us to do against the New World Order,
[13:11.480 --> 13:15.480]  it's over for them.
[13:15.480 --> 13:19.480]  And Russia knows that as well.
[13:19.480 --> 13:26.480]  Russia actually approached, and the U.S. approached Russia back in the 60s and 70s
[13:26.480 --> 13:29.480]  about a secret nuclear strike on China.
[13:29.480 --> 13:30.480]  And Russia refused it once.
[13:30.480 --> 13:34.480]  The U.S. refused it the next time, and there was that same geopolitical strategy, like,
[13:34.480 --> 13:35.480]  China's going to be the issue.
[13:35.480 --> 13:36.480]  Let's not do this.
[13:36.480 --> 13:38.480]  Let's just annihilate the communists there.
[13:38.480 --> 13:41.480]  Russia is not really working with China.
[13:41.480 --> 13:43.480]  And, of course, that deal never came through.
[13:43.480 --> 13:45.480]  I don't want to have a nuclear strike on China.
[13:45.480 --> 13:48.480]  But people knew then China was going to be set up to take over.
[13:48.480 --> 13:50.480]  And it is.
[13:50.480 --> 13:51.480]  And so that's where we are.
[13:51.480 --> 13:54.480]  And while we're busy fighting with Russia, this whole thing's going down.
[13:54.480 --> 13:57.480]  Well, that's coming up next segment.
[13:57.480 --> 14:01.480]  And just the mask news and what's coming out of it is so incredible.
[14:01.480 --> 14:08.480]  I have seen text messages with the second most high person in government in Hawaii.
[14:08.480 --> 14:13.480]  And I'm trying to get authorization to show these, and I've confirmed that's who it's with.
[14:13.480 --> 14:17.480]  You know, we have some guests and people on the show that are big film producers and have
[14:17.480 --> 14:19.480]  lived in Hawaii, and they've talked to these folks.
[14:19.480 --> 14:22.480]  And they said, hey, you know, why are you complaining?
[14:22.480 --> 14:26.480]  We're going to start the inoculations by this year, next year.
[14:26.480 --> 14:30.480]  And if you don't have a shot, you're not leaving your house.
[14:30.480 --> 14:32.480]  They're already saying that in Australia.
[14:32.480 --> 14:33.480]  That's coming.
[14:33.480 --> 14:35.480]  So this is all you in directed, folks.
[14:35.480 --> 14:40.480]  And if they can get you to wear a mask and get you to carry a phone to be contact-traced,
[14:40.480 --> 14:43.480]  they know you'll do anything.
[14:43.480 --> 14:45.480]  And that is the forced inoculation.
[14:45.480 --> 14:50.480]  Then you'll have it on your phone that you've got it and you swipe, that you are digitally
[14:50.480 --> 14:52.480]  taking your Bill Gates shots.
[14:52.480 --> 14:56.480]  And you're going to see a good 20, 30% of the public do it.
[14:56.480 --> 14:58.480]  And they're going to tell you, you're not getting on airplanes, none of it.
[14:58.480 --> 15:05.480]  JetBlue stands by throwing the people off the plane for saying the two-year-old had to put a mask on.
[15:05.480 --> 15:07.480]  This is a corporate cult.
[15:07.480 --> 15:17.480]  And now the universities everywhere are announcing everywhere that you're going to have a phone
[15:17.480 --> 15:24.480]  with an app on it that says where you go and if you leave the college campus, you're expelled or suspended.
[15:24.480 --> 15:26.480]  And it also tells you what stores you can go to.
[15:26.480 --> 15:30.480]  And you get money credits, though, discounts for complying.
[15:30.480 --> 15:32.480]  It is the social score.
[15:32.480 --> 15:34.480]  It's all ready here.
[15:34.480 --> 15:36.480]  And it's all coming up.
[15:36.480 --> 15:43.480]  Whether you believe in the Bible or not, there's a tyrannical anti-human world government that wants to face humans out
[15:43.480 --> 15:48.480]  and is building a new AI life form that believes that will replace us in alien life form.
[15:48.480 --> 15:50.480]  That's the official cosmology of the globalist.
[15:50.480 --> 15:57.480]  And they're bringing in a system to buy and sell where you must submit to them and your orderly extermination.
[15:57.480 --> 16:00.480]  How do you contest an election in the year 2020?
[16:00.480 --> 16:07.480]  Well, you trigger race riots and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're the speaker of the House
[16:07.480 --> 16:10.480]  that you are legitimately now the president.
[16:10.480 --> 16:15.480]  You're set on CBS News and then you're going to have those blue states secede.
[16:15.480 --> 16:19.480]  Yes, that's officially called a civil war, ladies and gentlemen.
[16:19.480 --> 16:23.480]  And the Democrats are backed by the EU, Hollywood, the Chai comms and the whole globalist system.
[16:23.480 --> 16:26.480]  This is treason with a capital T.
[16:26.480 --> 16:31.480]  And our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards they won't even stand up against it and do anything
[16:31.480 --> 16:34.480]  even though our president has been exposing it.
[16:34.480 --> 16:35.480]  Here's the bottom line.
[16:35.480 --> 16:36.480]  You need storeable food.
[16:36.480 --> 16:39.480]  We've got the best quality ready to ship to you right now.
[16:39.480 --> 16:42.480]  It's a beautiful week delivery with 80 days out from the election.
[16:42.480 --> 16:46.480]  You need to get high quality storeable food right now in case they are able to pull this off.
[16:46.480 --> 16:50.480]  We're going to have a great depression war on the streets that will make a road warrior look like a cake walk.
[16:50.480 --> 16:55.480]  Your high quality storeable foods now and get ready and get prepared at infowarstore.com.
[16:55.480 --> 16:56.480]  Get prepared.
[16:59.480 --> 17:02.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[17:02.480 --> 17:04.480]  The Big Brother
[17:07.480 --> 17:08.480]  Big Brother
[17:08.480 --> 17:10.480]  Mainstream media
[17:10.480 --> 17:12.480]  Government cover ups
[17:12.480 --> 17:14.480]  You want to stop tyranny?
[17:14.480 --> 17:15.480]  Well so does he.
[17:15.480 --> 17:18.480]  Live from the info war.com studios.
[17:18.480 --> 17:20.480]  It's Alex Jones.
[17:20.480 --> 17:22.480]  And you know who else is live?
[17:22.480 --> 17:24.480]  It's President Trump in Arlington, Virginia.
[17:24.480 --> 17:29.480]  We paused it a few minutes ago because he was on fire talking about the double standard for Joe Biden.
[17:29.480 --> 17:32.840]  Biden being hide under a rock as wife goes out and speaks for him.
[17:32.840 --> 17:34.920]  Now he can't even form a single sentence.
[17:34.920 --> 17:37.360]  The decline is accelerating at this rate.
[17:37.360 --> 17:38.360]  I said this two years ago.
[17:38.360 --> 17:42.840]  I believe he won't be able to basically talk by the inauguration if he actually won.
[17:42.840 --> 17:44.000]  But that's their plan.
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.480]  So he steps down and in comes Kamala Harris.
[17:46.480 --> 17:49.040]  Here's what the president is saying as we speak.
[17:49.040 --> 17:56.360]  I will say that if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did with calling off the prosecutors
[17:56.360 --> 18:01.320]  or you're not going to get a billion dollars, and he's on tape, it's not like, oh gee, I
[18:01.320 --> 18:03.600]  mean, he's on tape.
[18:03.600 --> 18:05.240]  We wouldn't have had a chance.
[18:05.240 --> 18:06.320]  It's a disgrace.
[18:06.320 --> 18:09.120]  The double standard is a disgrace.
[18:09.120 --> 18:12.080]  And hopefully it'll be brought back to fairness.
[18:12.080 --> 18:16.320]  And remember this, they spied on my campaign and they got caught.
[18:16.320 --> 18:17.760]  They can say what they want.
[18:17.760 --> 18:24.040]  This FBI agent has just now, first one admitted, that's the beginning, hopefully, of the falling
[18:24.040 --> 18:25.480]  castle.
[18:25.480 --> 18:29.760]  But he's admitted that he forged documents.
[18:29.760 --> 18:33.240]  He changed documents, reversing them.
[18:33.240 --> 18:34.800]  And he admitted it.
[18:34.800 --> 18:39.520]  So let's see what's going to happen over the next hopefully short period of time because
[18:39.520 --> 18:41.720]  it's been unfair that we've had to wait so long.
[18:41.720 --> 18:44.480]  That was so obvious for a long time.
[18:44.480 --> 18:50.720]  And it should never be allowed to happen to another president again, that I can tell you.
[18:50.720 --> 18:51.720]  And that's for the good of the country.
[18:51.720 --> 18:57.040]  Thank you, not for me, for the good of the country.
[18:57.040 --> 19:02.680]  Within three years, we replaced NAFTA, which everybody said was impossible to do, with
[19:02.680 --> 19:07.800]  the brand new and really pro-America US MCA.
[19:07.800 --> 19:10.080]  It's a whole different ball game.
[19:10.080 --> 19:14.080]  And we don't want to lose our companies to Mexico and Canada.
[19:14.080 --> 19:17.960]  And this puts a tremendous price tag on doing that if they want to do that.
[19:17.960 --> 19:19.480]  They won't be doing that.
[19:19.480 --> 19:23.720]  In everything we do, my administration is fighting for the American people and delivering
[19:23.720 --> 19:26.240]  one victory after another.
[19:26.240 --> 19:30.480]  We have appointed more than 230 federal judges.
[19:30.480 --> 19:56.480]  We expect to be perhaps over 300 federal judges by the end of the year.
[19:56.480 --> 20:00.000]  Oh, the globalists are scared right now.
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.120]  Their child combat plan to take down the country is failing.
[20:04.120 --> 20:12.040]  And now everything we covered, like Yuri Besmanoff, I covered this guy 25 years ago,
[20:12.040 --> 20:13.040]  I was playing.
[20:13.040 --> 20:17.920]  These former high-level KGB officers, breakdown of the left, they're planning to moralize
[20:17.920 --> 20:18.920]  this.
[20:18.920 --> 20:22.920]  And we got the Saul Olensky book confirms all of it, and it's the billionaires, almost
[20:22.920 --> 20:27.880]  all of them together running it because they want to end the free market so you're a slave.
[20:27.880 --> 20:30.840]  They get all the money and then they want to bankrupt everybody so they get all your
[20:30.840 --> 20:36.120]  property and whatever's left and then most importantly, can dictate culturally what
[20:36.120 --> 20:37.120]  they want.
[20:37.120 --> 20:43.320]  And that's Netflix now showing men dressed as women leading young boys with their clothes
[20:43.320 --> 20:51.880]  off or scantily clad into sex dungeons.
[20:51.880 --> 20:55.080]  And Netflix is defending it and saying they stand by it.
[20:55.080 --> 20:59.960]  Now, people are upset about 10, 11-year-old girls twerking and a show about how they're
[20:59.960 --> 21:03.720]  sexy and sexualizing them for the Pito viewer.
[21:03.720 --> 21:07.360]  But now, oh, the little boys are even younger and they're, oh, they're being, let me bring
[21:07.360 --> 21:10.640]  this little boy into a homosexual sex dungeon.
[21:10.640 --> 21:11.640]  He's a top.
[21:11.640 --> 21:16.440]  They tell you he's going to go into this sex room on some dirty mattress and he likes
[21:16.440 --> 21:24.800]  to do the pitching with a leering demon, a man and a clown outfit, calling himself
[21:24.800 --> 21:25.800]  a woman.
[21:25.800 --> 21:33.120]  A man stealing a woman's identity to commit these crimes against God and leering and smiling
[21:33.120 --> 21:38.320]  all the way into your child's soul.
[21:38.320 --> 21:40.360]  It's only drag queen story time.
[21:40.360 --> 21:42.440]  Come on.
[21:42.440 --> 21:48.880]  Men with erections and little girls and boys bouncing on them with men sharking out like
[21:48.880 --> 21:51.840]  like like like like fiends from some nightmare.
[21:51.840 --> 21:56.840]  But here's the former KGB operative defector.
[21:56.840 --> 21:59.360]  Now call of duty black ops.
[21:59.360 --> 22:08.640]  This is the new ad and I'll narrate for radio listeners here it is.
[22:08.640 --> 22:16.120]  At the height of the Cold War, KGB defector issued a chilling warning.
[22:16.120 --> 22:17.880]  Understand what's going on around you.
[22:17.880 --> 22:25.880]  You are in the state of war and you have precious little time to save yourself.
[22:25.880 --> 22:35.240]  It lays out the plan to subvert U.S. which are Soviet dominance the arms race.
[22:35.240 --> 22:42.960]  To this day that entity whereabouts may not know to this quote operative is a slow process
[22:42.960 --> 22:46.520]  which we call active measures.
[22:46.520 --> 22:48.760]  The first state being demoralization.
[22:48.760 --> 22:54.520]  It takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize the nation.
[22:54.520 --> 22:57.680]  The next stage is destabilization.
[22:57.680 --> 23:04.760]  What matters is essentials economy, foreign relations, defense systems.
[23:04.760 --> 23:15.600]  The next stage is crisis with a violent change of power, structure and economy period of normalization.
[23:15.600 --> 23:20.120]  This is what will happen in the United States if you allow all the schmucks to put a big
[23:20.120 --> 23:22.120]  brother government in Washington DC.
[23:22.120 --> 23:24.120]  We will promise lots of things.
[23:24.120 --> 23:31.120]  Never mind whether the promises are fulfilled or not.
[23:31.120 --> 23:32.120]  Inspired by actual events.
[23:32.120 --> 23:33.120]  A planned decade of making.
[23:33.120 --> 23:34.120]  Know your history.
[23:34.120 --> 23:48.360]  So again, if you don't want to be doomed to repeat it, understand that this is coming
[23:48.360 --> 23:49.360]  out.
[23:49.360 --> 23:51.960]  They probably got it by the censors who were too old and didn't understand.
[23:51.960 --> 23:54.320]  Oh great, it's blaming Russians now.
[23:54.320 --> 23:58.200]  This is clearly showing you what's happening currently and it's the globalist hand that
[23:58.200 --> 24:02.600]  did this to Russia and then Russia would use this to exploit and overthrow other countries
[24:02.600 --> 24:06.560]  because once the country is taken down by communist, which really is just the political
[24:06.560 --> 24:11.520]  name of the illuminist, it's the system the slaves are under, it's not what it is on top,
[24:11.520 --> 24:18.640]  they then exploit the country to start the next round of the infiltration, the destabilization,
[24:18.640 --> 24:19.640]  the normalization.
[24:19.640 --> 24:21.600]  But see, here's the key.
[24:21.600 --> 24:27.440]  They never got full control here during the normalization once they take over.
[24:27.440 --> 24:31.440]  The normalization that you're a slave, the normalization you don't have food, the normalization
[24:31.440 --> 24:35.120]  you don't have water, the normalization of troops on the streets, they put the government
[24:35.120 --> 24:39.600]  into that crisis so that once they get control, it's already in place and they can blame it
[24:39.600 --> 24:40.600]  on that.
[24:40.600 --> 24:46.000]  But they never fully got to that point because there's still elements of the government and
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.200]  the population and corporations and churches and individuals, that's key, that aren't complying
[24:51.200 --> 24:52.640]  and get it.
[24:52.640 --> 25:00.960]  And so there's a civil war politically, economically, culturally about this destiny.
[25:00.960 --> 25:05.880]  Jerry Bezdemoff in New Trailer for Black Ops Cold War Information Liberation, it's posted
[25:05.880 --> 25:09.240]  on infowars.com as well.
[25:09.240 --> 25:10.760]  We'll post that trailer at band.video.
[25:10.760 --> 25:16.160]  It's important, we should run it as a promo for them, but we should also take a few minutes
[25:16.160 --> 25:20.440]  of what I've said here and put it interspersed with it so people understand and it's not
[25:20.440 --> 25:22.360]  about giving the Russians a pass.
[25:22.360 --> 25:26.480]  If you believe the Russians cooked this up, you're ignoring history on record.
[25:26.480 --> 25:32.200]  Who overthrew Russia in 1917, the Bolsheviks, where'd they come from, the United States
[25:32.200 --> 25:33.720]  and England?
[25:33.720 --> 25:34.720]  What did they do?
[25:34.720 --> 25:36.320]  How long did they take them to control Russia?
[25:36.320 --> 25:38.640]  At least five years.
[25:38.640 --> 25:40.800]  What they do once they got control of the central government?
[25:40.800 --> 25:43.560]  I'll tell you later in the second hour about it.
[25:43.560 --> 25:46.720]  First step, Roger Stone's coming up, but you got to know history or you're doing to repeat
[25:46.720 --> 25:47.720]  it.
[25:47.720 --> 25:48.720]  We know the enemy.
[25:48.720 --> 25:50.360]  We know the playbook.
[25:50.360 --> 25:52.720]  And we are going to kick their ass.
[25:52.720 --> 26:02.360]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil is known to be so good for your brain, so good
[26:02.360 --> 26:07.920]  for your heart, so good for your cells, your cardiovascular system, your lungs, your sleep.
[26:07.920 --> 26:08.920]  It's amazing.
[26:08.920 --> 26:15.840]  Well, we set out a few years ago to go out and develop with top manufacturers the strongest
[26:15.840 --> 26:20.920]  highest quality, purest fish oil out there and this blend is amazing.

[27:06.120 --> 27:11.520]  financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses and he tells people they should
[27:11.520 --> 27:16.120]  get off the grid and get prepared and have storeable food if they can.
[27:16.120 --> 27:20.760]  And now everything I've warned people about is coming true because it was all in the Rockefeller

[27:55.560 --> 28:00.880]  When the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden two years ago, they knew he had
[28:00.880 --> 28:02.840]  serious cognitive problems.
[28:02.840 --> 28:07.960]  He has always been an implicit that does what he's told by the globalist and their allied
[28:07.960 --> 28:09.480]  crime syndicates.
[28:09.480 --> 28:12.760]  Kamala Harris is even worse than does whatever she's told.
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.200]  She's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley, the Chai Combs and others.
[28:17.200 --> 28:23.680]  So she has been chosen because she's part African and now anyone that criticizes her
[28:23.680 --> 28:28.400]  will be called a racist and evil and she is now above reproach.
[28:28.400 --> 28:33.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose this monster for who she is.
[28:33.160 --> 28:38.040]  We must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people three times longer
[28:38.040 --> 28:41.640]  than white people and that the woman is a monster.
[28:41.640 --> 28:46.560]  Kamala Harris will end up being our president if they're able to steal the election and
[28:46.560 --> 28:50.480]  she is a 110% new world order puppet.
[28:50.480 --> 28:53.200]  Now more than ever, we must expose this monster.
[28:53.200 --> 28:59.480]  We must expose the globalist.
[28:59.480 --> 29:16.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[29:16.720 --> 29:23.640]  Roger Stone is about to join us with exclusive information on Steve Bannon on the campaign
[29:23.640 --> 29:24.640]  and much more.
[29:24.640 --> 29:25.640]  But here is a special report.
[29:25.640 --> 29:33.520]  It's only two minutes long, it's a banned on video where President Trump destroys the
[29:33.520 --> 29:36.360]  pedophile networks.
[29:36.360 --> 29:38.960]  It's so important here it is.
[29:38.960 --> 29:45.120]  You are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals.
[29:45.120 --> 29:49.360]  Does that sound like something you are behind?
[29:49.360 --> 29:55.480]  Well, I haven't heard that, but is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing?
[29:55.480 --> 30:03.120]  Marina Abranovic is a superstar with every weird, twisted, Hollywood, DC or New York
[30:03.120 --> 30:05.480]  lowlife.
[30:05.480 --> 30:10.160]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and jury embassy.
[30:10.160 --> 30:12.760]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[30:12.760 --> 30:18.160]  Maxwell participated with and assisted Epstein in maintaining and protecting his sex trafficking
[30:18.160 --> 30:23.040]  ring, ensuring that approximately three girls a day were made available to him.
[30:23.040 --> 30:26.160]  People think of that as an ancient art.
[30:26.160 --> 30:30.840]  There are more human smugglers right now, traffickers they call them, than at any time
[30:30.840 --> 30:32.640]  in the history of our world.
[30:32.640 --> 30:36.400]  Trump has signed executive orders to expand the introduction of human trafficking.
[30:36.400 --> 30:37.400]  It's exploded.
[30:37.400 --> 30:39.800]  He's got the Navy and the Army involved stopping it.
[30:39.800 --> 30:43.000]  And they're having huge busts of small children kidnapped.
[30:43.000 --> 30:46.960]  Operation Cross Country had led to the arrest of 120 human traffickers.
[30:46.960 --> 30:50.040]  One of the victims was just three months old.
[30:50.040 --> 30:52.040]  124 arrests.
[30:52.040 --> 30:56.480]  339 criminal arrests were made across the state.
[30:56.480 --> 30:59.840]  84 underage boys and girls forced into prostitution.
[30:59.840 --> 31:05.240]  Serves of deputies have announced the arrest of 25 people accused of traveling to have
[31:05.240 --> 31:06.240]  sex with a child.
[31:06.240 --> 31:11.040]  Tonight more than half a dozen accused child sexual predators are off the street.
[31:11.040 --> 31:16.000]  One trafficker was arrested after making a deal with an undercover agent to sell a three
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.400]  month old girl and her five year old sister for sex.
[31:19.400 --> 31:21.680]  Human sex trafficking of juveniles.
[31:21.680 --> 31:27.840]  I am prepared to bring the full force and weight of our government that we can do in
[31:27.840 --> 31:30.280]  order to solve this horrific problem.
[31:30.280 --> 31:35.320]  The whole Clinton system is just littered with pedophiles and Tony Podesta running full
[31:35.320 --> 31:38.400]  page articles about how he loves art of naked children.
[31:38.400 --> 31:46.800]  They're throwing it in our face.
[31:46.800 --> 31:53.760]  So very important short report, it's not a campaign and for Trump, it's an ad for truth
[31:53.760 --> 31:54.760]  for the children.
[31:54.760 --> 31:57.040]  Trump unleashes hell on child sex traffickers.
[31:57.040 --> 32:01.440]  We're going to add to that posting all watching this video from a few years ago, pedophiles
[32:01.440 --> 32:07.080]  rule the world, but their empire of evil is going down.
[32:07.080 --> 32:08.080]  Share that link.
[32:08.080 --> 32:12.840]  It went up late last night, 114,000 views, it needs 10 million views.
[32:12.840 --> 32:16.280]  Well, Roger Stone joins us and I appreciate it because he's a man of demand and very,
[32:16.280 --> 32:17.280]  very busy.
[32:17.280 --> 32:19.840]  I wanted to get his take on the Bannon situation.
[32:19.840 --> 32:24.800]  It's bigger than just Steve Bannon perjuring himself and saying Stone was the least connection.
[32:24.800 --> 32:28.200]  This ties into a bunch of things and what's happening.
[32:28.200 --> 32:30.600]  He's got campaign news and a lot more.
[32:30.600 --> 32:33.200]  So Roger Stone, thank you for coming on with us today.
[32:33.200 --> 32:36.600]  Alex, thank you very much for having me.
[32:36.600 --> 32:43.200]  I must say at the top that I take no delight in Steve Bannon's new problems, but they don't
[32:43.200 --> 32:51.120]  surprise me because we know definitively that he directly contradicted his testimony at
[32:51.120 --> 32:58.560]  my trial where he was Robert Mueller's top witness, his big secret witness, in his sworn
[32:58.560 --> 33:02.280]  testimony to the House Intelligence Committee.
[33:02.280 --> 33:09.360]  In fact, it was so egregious and so obvious that New York Post reported on it.
[33:09.360 --> 33:10.800]  You can't have it both ways.
[33:10.800 --> 33:15.320]  He told the House Intelligence Committee that he never spoke to me about WikiLeaks or Julian
[33:15.320 --> 33:17.960]  Assange at any time ever.
[33:17.960 --> 33:23.800]  That is the truth, by the way, and then basically on the stand, sealing my guilty verdict.
[33:23.800 --> 33:30.120]  He said, no, we spoke about it in every conversation we had in 2016, not true.
[33:30.120 --> 33:32.520]  So this does not surprise me.
[33:32.520 --> 33:39.120]  What does surprise me is that in my trial, the government had an obligation to tell us
[33:39.120 --> 33:43.880]  that Steve Bannon, their chief witness, was under federal investigation.
[33:43.880 --> 33:47.320]  Not doing so is a Brady violation.
[33:47.320 --> 33:53.840]  It's not that Bannon's federal investigation was exculpatory, but we could have used it
[33:53.840 --> 33:56.240]  to impeach his credibility.
[33:56.240 --> 34:03.440]  Did Steve try to make a deal on this criminal charge and throw me to the wolves in return?
[34:03.440 --> 34:08.400]  I'll never know, but I'm praying for him at this point.
[34:08.400 --> 34:14.840]  I point out that the ten commandments tell us that I shall not bear false witness against
[34:14.840 --> 34:20.880]  thy neighbor, and the Bible teaches us to pray for those who have trespassed against
[34:20.880 --> 34:21.880]  us.
[34:21.880 --> 34:26.400]  And vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord, and here he is, groveling, lying, working with
[34:26.400 --> 34:30.760]  the system, leaking on Trump, and now the very people, as I'm told, I talked to high
[34:30.760 --> 34:35.520]  level folks in New York yesterday morning, they said, no, this is the deep state Democrats
[34:35.520 --> 34:36.920]  trying to embarrass Trump.
[34:36.920 --> 34:40.320]  So now the deep state's doing Trump a favor against this traitor.
[34:40.320 --> 34:42.400]  It just shows there's no honor amongst thieves.
[34:42.400 --> 34:48.480]  Well, not only that, but I did learn that most of the most prominent neocons in the
[34:48.480 --> 34:56.360]  Trump administration, the most problematic ones, HR, McMaster, Rex Tillerson, Rod Rosenstein,
[34:56.360 --> 35:00.040]  these people were sponsored, yes, by Steve Bannon.
[35:00.040 --> 35:05.760]  So he talks a great game as a nationalist, but he has been crucial in placing some of
[35:05.760 --> 35:11.280]  the neocons who did, I think, real damage to the Trump administration until the president
[35:11.280 --> 35:13.280]  got wise and got rid of them.
[35:13.280 --> 35:16.040]  So look, I don't know how this unfolds.
[35:16.040 --> 35:21.160]  Remember, the Wall Street Journal has also reported that there are ongoing investigations
[35:21.160 --> 35:25.360]  into Bannon's relationship with a Chinese billionaire.
[35:25.360 --> 35:27.400]  I don't know what will come of any of that.
[35:27.400 --> 35:30.040]  I don't know if there's any wrongdoing there.
[35:30.040 --> 35:34.720]  But this, I think the story is to be continued.
[35:34.720 --> 35:42.600]  This is a big deal that he groveled to the deep state, but still they burned him as a
[35:42.600 --> 35:47.280]  cheap trick against Trump that nobody's buying to try to discredit the wall or something.
[35:47.280 --> 35:52.400]  Can you speak to that briefly and then let's shift gears into another subject I'll bring
[35:52.400 --> 35:53.400]  up in a moment.
[35:53.400 --> 35:59.200]  Yeah, I think the overriding desire here is to undermine the president, but the truth
[35:59.200 --> 36:05.280]  is, despite the fact that Bannon keeps planting these stories that he's been rehabilitated
[36:05.280 --> 36:09.640]  in the White House and that he's counseling people at the White House are essentially
[36:09.640 --> 36:13.480]  not true, or he may be speaking to people at the White House, but that doesn't mean
[36:13.480 --> 36:15.800]  he has any influence with the president.
[36:15.800 --> 36:20.840]  Let's remember, Steve Bannon referred to the Trump real estate company as an organized
[36:20.840 --> 36:23.040]  crime organization.
[36:23.040 --> 36:30.080]  He called Donald Trump Jr., who was a great patriot, a traitor, he accused him of treason,
[36:30.080 --> 36:31.080]  to be more specific.
[36:31.080 --> 36:36.520]  I don't know why anybody would want this guy back in the tent.
[36:36.520 --> 36:41.800]  He is really not to be trusted, and frankly, stealing a million dollars, which is what
[36:41.800 --> 36:47.600]  the indictment accuses him of, is far more serious than the charges fabricated and brought
[36:47.600 --> 36:54.880]  against me of lying to Congress when any misstatement I meant was immaterial, and I had no intent
[36:54.880 --> 36:59.360]  to mislead anyone because there was nothing to mislead them about.
[36:59.360 --> 37:07.320]  So it is, I guess it is karma, but just the same, I will be praying for it.
[37:07.320 --> 37:12.600]  Now Trump just gave a speech, he's still going, but 30 minutes ago he came out and he said,
[37:12.600 --> 37:17.880]  you've seen the first indictment of this FBI lawyer that on record falsified the Carter
[37:17.880 --> 37:20.480]  Page FBI field memos.
[37:20.480 --> 37:22.160]  They knew he was CIA.
[37:22.160 --> 37:24.680]  That's why when he testifies at Congress, they say, what were you doing in Russia?
[37:24.680 --> 37:25.680]  It's classified.
[37:25.680 --> 37:30.080]  He'll be arrested if he said that, violating the National Security Act, and then they continue
[37:30.080 --> 37:33.000]  to act like he's hiding something when they knew damn well he works for the U.S. government
[37:33.000 --> 37:40.720]  as a patriot, and now they are really getting scared, and Trump has telegraphed that there
[37:40.720 --> 37:44.280]  are a bunch of indictments, and we may actually see Durham take action.
[37:44.280 --> 37:50.000]  I know I talked to Steve Pachinick about his big Pentagon and CIA connections and he said
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.960]  he's surprised that Trump actually did this or could get a bar to do this, but the word
[37:54.960 --> 37:58.560]  is they're going to move against the deep state before the election, and that's what
[37:58.560 --> 37:59.760]  we're hearing now.
[37:59.760 --> 38:01.800]  What do you think of that statement if that's accurate?
[38:01.800 --> 38:07.440]  Well, first of all, Steve Pachinick is a very credible source, and he has his own sources
[38:07.440 --> 38:11.560]  as a veteran of the counterintelligence establishment.
[38:11.560 --> 38:14.440]  He knows a lot, but he's a truth teller.
[38:14.440 --> 38:21.040]  At the same time, my fear is that we scapegoat Klein Smith without ever finding out who instructed
[38:21.040 --> 38:27.960]  Klein Smith to do this, who, above him, it's not incidental that Andrew Weisman, the so-called
[38:27.960 --> 38:33.600]  pit bull of the Mueller investigation, actively urging the Department of Justice employees
[38:33.600 --> 38:39.600]  not to cooperate with any of these investigations, I believe that's obstruction of justice, has
[38:39.600 --> 38:43.600]  falsely accused many of hiding misconduct by the president.
[38:43.600 --> 38:47.200]  Oh, let's talk about the new Senate committee stuff we're hearing where they're saying
[38:47.200 --> 38:51.280]  that, you know, they have intel you were a Russian, which, like, WMDs and I, right?
[38:51.280 --> 38:55.720]  Roger Stone, straight ahead, stay with us.
[38:55.720 --> 38:57.320]  It was a sleeper product.
[38:57.320 --> 39:01.600]  It wasn't popular at first, but as people tried it, it's become one of our top five
[39:01.600 --> 39:02.600]  best sellers.
[39:02.600 --> 39:07.600]  We're talking about the eight-pack power stack, 13 different pills filled with super-nutrients,
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.480]  vitamins, minerals, and more that you take in the morning and one pack and at night.

[39:17.960 --> 39:20.760]  Shield X2 that's now back in stock.
[39:20.760 --> 39:22.960]  This has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[39:22.960 --> 39:24.400]  Now, here's the problem.
[39:24.400 --> 39:28.960]  Some of the patented ingredients that are in a pack power stack because of the shutdown
[39:28.960 --> 39:32.240]  and the lockdown are not available for us to even reorder it.
[39:32.240 --> 39:35.840]  So this could be the last shipment that we ever have.

[39:52.800 --> 39:53.800]  deal on this ever.
[39:53.800 --> 40:09.680]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[40:09.680 --> 40:23.720]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked, and threatened because we are effective.
[40:23.720 --> 40:25.720]  The great awakening is here.
[40:25.720 --> 40:32.440]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[40:32.440 --> 40:50.720]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[40:50.720 --> 41:01.680]  The New York Times, the Washington Post, or Howard Stern, of a boo you name it, they
[41:01.680 --> 41:06.840]  come out and they attack Infowars saying, Jones claims Civil War is coming and financial
[41:06.840 --> 41:12.160]  collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses and he tells people they should get off the
[41:12.160 --> 41:16.280]  grid and get prepared and have horrible food if they can.
[41:16.280 --> 41:20.920]  And now everything I have warned people about is coming true because it was all in the Rockefeller
[41:20.920 --> 41:23.600]  Foundation documents like lockstep.
[41:23.600 --> 41:26.640]  This is the corporate planetary takeover.
[41:26.640 --> 41:31.560]  So yes, I stand by what I said ten years ago, what I said a year ago, and what I said last
[41:31.560 --> 41:36.280]  week more than ever, get your high quality store of the foods at infowarstore.com.

[42:59.000 --> 43:15.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[43:15.040 --> 43:16.040]  Roger Stones, our guest.
[43:16.040 --> 43:17.040]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[43:17.040 --> 43:23.480]  Thanks for joining us on this live Friday transmission, little tidbit last weekend where
[43:23.480 --> 43:27.440]  they blocked my wife and I for being able to go down and hike on the green belt.
[43:27.440 --> 43:29.720]  I got mad and picked the very spot where we got blocked.
[43:29.720 --> 43:33.640]  It's one of the longest entrances a quarter mile down in the hot tip.
[43:33.640 --> 43:34.640]  I apologize.
[43:34.640 --> 43:35.640]  I wasn't thinking.
[43:35.640 --> 43:36.640]  I'm like a bird dog.
[43:36.640 --> 43:37.640]  I see the birds.
[43:37.640 --> 43:38.640]  I go.
[43:38.640 --> 43:39.640]  I kind of get a plan.
[43:39.640 --> 43:40.640]  I do it.
[43:40.640 --> 43:41.640]  That's part of my strength.
[43:41.640 --> 43:42.640]  It's also part of my weakness is there's not a lot of calculation going on.
[43:42.640 --> 43:44.640]  Just a lot of deep research that I make the decision.
[43:44.640 --> 43:47.880]  It's like a timer just pinging and then it's done.
[43:47.880 --> 43:52.880]  Tomorrow we're going to go and swim where Barton Springs, the creek comes in where it's
[43:52.880 --> 43:58.640]  the beautiful 70 degrees deep aquifer water.
[43:58.640 --> 44:03.080]  There's plenty of parking right down there and I told folks, I'm getting everybody food
[44:03.080 --> 44:04.080]  for at least 500.
[44:04.080 --> 44:05.880]  It's by the monkey tree.
[44:05.880 --> 44:09.000]  It's on the south side of Barton Springs and downtown Austin.
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.360]  Plenty of parking and they've tried to say that the trails are closed, but the parking
[44:13.360 --> 44:14.360]  lots are open.
[44:14.360 --> 44:15.360]  I'll see you there tomorrow.
[44:15.360 --> 44:16.360]  All right.
[44:16.360 --> 44:17.360]  Let's get back to Roger Stone.
[44:17.360 --> 44:21.560]  Somebody told me 10 years ago I'd be on air in 2020 going and we're going to go protest
[44:21.560 --> 44:23.480]  that we're allowed to go to the park.
[44:23.480 --> 44:24.480]  But that's where we are.
[44:24.480 --> 44:28.240]  If we're burning down houses and shooting police, we'd be heroes, according to left.
[44:28.240 --> 44:32.080]  Roger, this is bigger than your case and I care about you.
[44:32.080 --> 44:35.680]  And when you said three years ago and they were setting you up, you were worried.
[44:35.680 --> 44:37.600]  Two years ago, I thought you were exaggerating.
[44:37.600 --> 44:40.920]  Then they tried to get me indicted and my dad and I learned, wow, this is real.
[44:40.920 --> 44:41.920]  And so I apologize.
[44:41.920 --> 44:42.920]  You were right.
[44:42.920 --> 44:44.000]  And but it is bigger than you.
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.680]  It's about all of us, about them saying that we didn't vote for Trump.
[44:46.680 --> 44:48.180]  Russia did it.
[44:48.180 --> 44:52.240]  They're back at it again in the Senate with no evidence saying you're a Russian agent
[44:52.240 --> 44:53.240]  recycling that.
[44:53.240 --> 44:54.840]  So nip that in the bud for us.
[44:54.840 --> 44:55.840]  Yeah.
[44:55.840 --> 45:02.400]  The Senate Intelligence Committee report was released on Friday and it is the same fabricated
[45:02.400 --> 45:05.200]  recycling of the same old nonsense.
[45:05.200 --> 45:11.120]  Interestingly enough, it says that in this report that they assessed that Roger Stone
[45:11.120 --> 45:16.640]  spoke multiple times with Donald Trump regarding the release of the Wickey League's disclosure.
[45:16.640 --> 45:21.000]  That is always a word that the intelligence agencies use when they have a theory that
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.600]  they have no evidence or proof for.
[45:23.600 --> 45:30.400]  This is categorically false, but it is designed to bolster the false claim, the big lie, that
[45:30.400 --> 45:37.360]  Roger Stone traded his silence regarding misconduct by the president in conversations that were
[45:37.360 --> 45:40.920]  inappropriate in return for clemency in his case.
[45:40.920 --> 45:43.800]  There is no evidence of that whatsoever.
[45:43.800 --> 45:51.120]  You have the uncorrelated plea bargain induced testimony of Michael Cohen and Rick Gates,
[45:51.120 --> 45:53.720]  which they cannot prove because it is false.
[45:53.720 --> 45:59.120]  They both made a deal to get reduced sentences in return for those lies.
[45:59.120 --> 46:04.080]  By the way, I've passed two polygraph tests on this exact question.
[46:04.080 --> 46:11.440]  So it also says in the report, for example, Alex, that in July of 2016, I wrote a tweet
[46:11.440 --> 46:17.160]  for Donald Trump, candidate Trump, at his direction proposing some peace plan with Vladimir
[46:17.160 --> 46:18.660]  Putin.
[46:18.660 --> 46:19.660]  This is whole cloth.
[46:19.660 --> 46:26.200]  I wrote no tweets for candidate Trump whatsoever in 2016, including this one.
[46:26.200 --> 46:28.240]  Where does this information come from?
[46:28.240 --> 46:34.240]  When you look at the leadership of this committee, it is the disgrace Richard Burr who got caught
[46:34.240 --> 46:35.240]  inside or traded.
[46:35.240 --> 46:38.480]  And it comes out of the rear end of Adam Schiff.
[46:38.480 --> 46:46.200]  And well, and in that pustule from Virginia, Mark Warner, these guys, and so you have rhinos
[46:46.200 --> 46:50.320]  and hardline leftist Democrats trying to recycle the same.
[46:50.320 --> 46:51.320]  Exactly.
[46:51.320 --> 46:54.360]  I know you're talking about the Senate, but going back to the House, Schiff is still
[46:54.360 --> 46:56.680]  a central character they want us to forget about.
[46:56.680 --> 46:59.280]  Isn't he quarterbacking a lot of this?
[46:59.280 --> 47:04.440]  Thank God the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee were not rhinos, at least not all
[47:04.440 --> 47:05.440]  of them.
[47:05.440 --> 47:09.920]  They were more aggressive, and I think Chairman Nunes came to the correct conclusion.
[47:09.920 --> 47:14.280]  There was no evidence of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.
[47:14.280 --> 47:18.800]  This document that they released last week implies that there is, but there's no proof
[47:18.800 --> 47:19.800]  to it.
[47:19.800 --> 47:21.160]  It is a false narrative.
[47:21.160 --> 47:27.800]  Warner continues to imply that I had something to do with the timing of the WikiLeaks disclosures
[47:27.800 --> 47:30.320]  for which there is no evidence at all.
[47:30.320 --> 47:34.520]  Lasting the Democrats in general, Roger, they're running ads and stuff about Russia gating
[47:34.520 --> 47:35.520]  again.
[47:35.520 --> 47:36.520]  They think we're that stupid.
[47:36.520 --> 47:37.520]  I think this is a losing issue.
[47:37.520 --> 47:41.680]  I think America has rejected it, but they're such an alien force wanting to get rid of
[47:41.680 --> 47:42.680]  the country itself.
[47:42.680 --> 47:48.480]  They have to brand us as the outside pathogen because they're the ones on the Chai-Kom Dole,
[47:48.480 --> 47:54.280]  and I really like to see Trump running big ads showing how Joe Biden's bought and paid
[47:54.280 --> 47:55.280]  for by foreign power.
[47:55.280 --> 47:56.800]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[47:56.800 --> 47:57.800]  I agree.
[47:57.800 --> 48:02.080]  I think that is one of Biden's several greatest vulnerabilities.
[48:02.080 --> 48:07.320]  If you watch that snoozefest last night, the Democratic National Convention, this idea
[48:07.320 --> 48:12.920]  that the president bungled the coronavirus crisis is completely false.
[48:12.920 --> 48:19.000]  This idea that the hydrochloroquine and zinc don't work, that's false also.
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.240]  The president had the audacity to appoint to an inexpensive medication, which there's
[48:24.240 --> 48:26.240]  now more than enough of medical evidence.
[48:26.240 --> 48:30.400]  Something that actually works at 99% because he wants to fix it instead of create a problem
[48:30.400 --> 48:32.160]  and milk it for a hundred years.
[48:32.160 --> 48:38.320]  And he doesn't want the pharmaceutical companies to cash in on what is a legitimate, but probably
[48:38.320 --> 48:40.320]  overstated public health crisis.
[48:40.320 --> 48:41.320]  I totally agree.
[48:41.320 --> 48:42.400]  We only got five minutes left with you.
[48:42.400 --> 48:44.520]  You're a busy man.
[48:44.520 --> 48:45.520]  People need to support you.
[48:45.520 --> 48:50.200]  They need to get your Roger Stone still did nothing wrong because you're a signet, a standard
[48:50.200 --> 48:55.640]  of victory against their evil at your main website, and we'll give that out in a moment.
[48:55.640 --> 48:57.600]  But I'm going to ask you the questions today.
[48:57.600 --> 49:00.160]  What other stuff is on your radar you want to tell people about?
[49:00.160 --> 49:06.480]  Well, obviously, the Republican National Convention is coming up and the president and his people
[49:06.480 --> 49:10.920]  are working very hard to have a superior presentation.
[49:10.920 --> 49:14.680]  These conventions do impact the voters' attitudes.
[49:14.680 --> 49:17.880]  The president has been gaining in the polls.
[49:17.880 --> 49:20.320]  He is closing the gap.
[49:20.320 --> 49:26.400]  That gap is caused quite frankly by the collapse of the economy because of the measures the
[49:26.400 --> 49:32.120]  president had no choice but to take to protect the country in the COVID-19 crisis.
[49:32.120 --> 49:37.680]  And because of the relentless falsehoods coming from the mainstream media, at the same time,
[49:37.680 --> 49:43.840]  you have the widespread and increasing censorship of patriots, liberals, Republicans, conservatives,
[49:43.840 --> 49:47.840]  non-liberals, Trump supporters, Christians on the Internet.
[49:47.840 --> 49:53.120]  This combined factor is why the president is, I think, slightly behind in this contest.
[49:53.120 --> 49:57.840]  But Alex, I have seen no poll that shows that the president cannot recover.
[49:57.840 --> 49:58.840]  He's not behind.
[49:58.840 --> 49:59.840]  No, I agree.
[49:59.840 --> 50:02.880]  I just heard a trainwreck sound because I really respect you because you're an optimist.
[50:02.880 --> 50:04.720]  You're saying Trump's behind right now.
[50:04.720 --> 50:06.160]  I heard a record skip there.
[50:06.160 --> 50:10.520]  Let's start over with that because that makes me have a little bit of a pucker factor here.
[50:10.520 --> 50:16.080]  I think he is slightly behind, probably, nationally and in probably more than half of the swing
[50:16.080 --> 50:17.080]  states.
[50:17.080 --> 50:18.680]  But that doesn't concern me.
[50:18.680 --> 50:21.680]  He was behind at this point in 2016 as well.
[50:21.680 --> 50:25.600]  Seriously, they're going to pull the shenanigan on the post office next week to overshadow
[50:25.600 --> 50:26.600]  the convention.
[50:26.600 --> 50:28.080]  They will try to.
[50:28.080 --> 50:31.640]  Look, they will try to distract to the extent that they can.
[50:31.640 --> 50:33.320]  The president can win this contest.
[50:33.320 --> 50:35.800]  I think he will win this contest.
[50:35.800 --> 50:40.000]  He needs a more focused approach in the fall, which I think you'll see.
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.680]  But again, I am not one of those countries where the Republic is running for the high
[50:43.680 --> 50:44.680]  grass.
[50:44.680 --> 50:46.360]  I think he's slightly behind today.
[50:46.360 --> 50:47.360]  I explained why.
[50:47.360 --> 50:49.360]  But I think he can make up that ground.
[50:49.360 --> 50:54.240]  You said exactly this four years ago, but in studio with us.
[50:54.240 --> 50:55.240]  That's exactly right.
[50:55.240 --> 51:00.040]  Look, institutionally, the combination of the internet censorship and the mainstream
[51:00.040 --> 51:06.080]  media added to the ballot fraud that we expect is what's going to make this a very difficult
[51:06.080 --> 51:07.080]  race.
[51:07.080 --> 51:09.000]  There's nothing new here.
[51:09.000 --> 51:12.840]  If you didn't have those factors, if you had an honest election, Donald Trump would
[51:12.840 --> 51:14.320]  run away with this.
[51:14.320 --> 51:18.760]  But any Republican or any Trump supporter who is sitting back thinking that this will be
[51:18.760 --> 51:23.360]  a landslide because the silent majority is going to pull it out, overconfidence is one
[51:23.360 --> 51:25.960]  of our most egregious problems.
[51:25.960 --> 51:30.640]  I still find pockets of overconfidence among the president's supporters.
[51:30.640 --> 51:32.160]  I keep running into it as well.
[51:32.160 --> 51:34.160]  Let me just do a little fuel fact to it.
[51:34.160 --> 51:35.160]  And if you got to go, you got to go.
[51:35.160 --> 51:36.240]  We do five more.
[51:36.240 --> 51:37.240]  Just blink.
[51:37.240 --> 51:38.240]  Can you do five more?
[51:38.240 --> 51:39.240]  Roger?
[51:39.240 --> 51:40.760]  Actually, I have to end this segment.
[51:40.760 --> 51:41.760]  No, I know.
[51:41.760 --> 51:42.760]  You're a busy guy now.
[51:42.760 --> 51:43.760]  Wow.
[51:43.760 --> 51:44.760]  Talk about a demand.
[51:44.760 --> 51:45.760]  Sean Hannity.
[51:45.760 --> 51:46.760]  I like Sean Hannity.
[51:46.760 --> 51:48.760]  I know how he hates the president.
[51:48.760 --> 51:50.760]  They're trying to drive a wedge between Hannity and Trump.
[51:50.760 --> 51:51.760]  I think that's BS cut level.
[51:51.760 --> 51:52.760]  What do you think?
[51:52.760 --> 51:53.760]  I love Sean Hannity.
[51:53.760 --> 51:57.120]  He was very good to me in my epic fight for freedom.
[51:57.120 --> 52:00.080]  I know that he has great affection for the president.
[52:00.080 --> 52:01.080]  He's expressed it to me.
[52:01.080 --> 52:03.360]  I've never heard him say anything of the kind.
[52:03.360 --> 52:05.760]  So that's another attempted wedge operation.
[52:05.760 --> 52:09.400]  Brian Stelter is not an incredible source.
[52:09.400 --> 52:12.000]  And we don't name whoever supposedly said this.
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.440]  I happen to know that Sean Hannity has great affection and respect for the president.
[52:16.440 --> 52:18.240]  He's told me that numerous times.
[52:18.240 --> 52:19.240]  Why would he say otherwise?
[52:19.240 --> 52:22.840]  He might have said the president's crazy like a fox.
[52:22.840 --> 52:25.120]  He didn't say he's crazy.
[52:25.120 --> 52:26.120]  Absolutely not.
[52:26.120 --> 52:27.320]  Look, it's just disinformation.
[52:27.320 --> 52:30.080]  It's yet another smear attempt, remember.
[52:30.080 --> 52:32.800]  I don't believe anything CNN says.
[52:32.800 --> 52:35.440]  I don't get my news from CNN for the same reason.
[52:35.440 --> 52:36.440]  I don't agree.
[52:36.440 --> 52:37.440]  No, I agree.
[52:37.440 --> 52:42.120]  But they still try to stay relevant by just saying whopper lies and like even I have trouble
[52:42.120 --> 52:43.560]  sometimes just wanting to know.
[52:43.560 --> 52:47.040]  Roger, amazing, very exciting what's going on.
[52:47.040 --> 52:51.160]  And we're just glad that you are not in prison and they are certainly pissed about that.
[52:51.160 --> 52:52.560]  Have a great weekend, my friend.
[52:52.560 --> 52:58.200]  So I'm now back at Stone Cold Truth.com posting regularly on the latest political news.
[52:58.200 --> 53:04.880]  So folks who saw our hiatus during the gag can go back to Stone Cold Truth.com and follow
[53:04.880 --> 53:06.560]  my political analysis there.
[53:06.560 --> 53:07.560]  Many thanks.
[53:07.560 --> 53:08.560]  Thank you, Roger.
[53:08.560 --> 53:09.560]  All right.
[53:09.560 --> 53:10.560]  I had a couple more questions.
[53:10.560 --> 53:11.560]  We'll come back on next week.
[53:11.560 --> 53:12.560]  We'll get to those then.
[53:12.560 --> 53:16.280]  Speaking of plugging, if you don't get an infowars t-shirt, you're crazy.
[53:16.280 --> 53:19.500]  And we've got what I think is the official campaign shirt this year, a big bold American
[53:19.500 --> 53:22.640]  eagle with a Betsy Ross flag that it's perched on top of.
[53:22.640 --> 53:23.920]  It's not disrespect the flag.
[53:23.920 --> 53:25.720]  It's all goes together like a horse and carriage.
[53:25.720 --> 53:26.720]  It's very beautiful.
[53:26.720 --> 53:30.680]  And it's got the American flag on the arm and it's got keeping America great on the back
[53:30.680 --> 53:31.680]  infowars.com.
[53:31.680 --> 53:35.160]  That's how we fund ourselves and we've got high quality, swarble food now ready to ship
[53:35.160 --> 53:36.160]  within one to two weeks.
[53:36.160 --> 53:37.160]  They've got it.
[53:37.160 --> 53:38.160]  They just have to package it.
[53:38.160 --> 53:40.960]  And we've got so many other great products and a big sale going right now, the infowars
[53:40.960 --> 53:41.960]  store.com.

[53:42.960 --> 53:43.960]  We'll see you in the next one.
[53:43.960 --> 53:44.960]  Bye.
[53:44.960 --> 53:45.960]  Bye.
[53:45.960 --> 53:46.960]  Bye.
[53:46.960 --> 54:11.960]  Bye.
[54:16.960 --> 54:44.000]  Bye.
[54:47.580 --> 54:52.460]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil is known to be so good for your brain, so good
[54:52.460 --> 54:57.960]  for your heart, so good for your cells, your cardiovascular system, your lungs, your sleep.

[55:48.640 --> 55:51.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[56:00.600 --> 56:03.240]  Defending the Republic from enemies,
[56:03.240 --> 56:05.400]  foreign and domestic.
[56:05.400 --> 56:07.160]  It's Alex Jones.
[56:07.160 --> 56:12.840]  Let the good times roll.
[56:12.840 --> 56:14.440]  Yeah, well, the good times ain't rolling
[56:14.440 --> 56:15.400]  for the New World Order.
[56:15.400 --> 56:18.680]  I'm gonna talk about it next segment.
[56:18.680 --> 56:23.360]  Their house of cards is coming down.
[56:23.360 --> 56:24.920]  And our good times are gonna roll
[56:24.920 --> 56:27.360]  after we make it through these hard times.
[56:27.360 --> 56:30.160]  Probably take 20, 30 years.
[56:30.160 --> 56:32.160]  But after that, we're over the mountain.
[56:32.160 --> 56:33.840]  And wow, the eye's not seen,
[56:33.840 --> 56:36.480]  the ear not heard the next level.
[56:36.480 --> 56:37.600]  You think all this is amazing
[56:37.600 --> 56:39.320]  compared to somebody 1,000 years ago?
[56:39.320 --> 56:41.520]  This is just the dark side of technology.
[56:41.520 --> 56:43.280]  The evil side, imagine the real side.
[56:43.280 --> 56:45.440]  Let's go to part of this special report here.
[56:46.800 --> 56:48.680]  The UN wants your children.
[56:50.440 --> 56:54.960]  If you take one thing from my words tonight, it is this.
[56:54.960 --> 56:58.560]  If you think things cannot possibly get worse,
[56:58.560 --> 57:01.520]  trust me, they can and they will
[57:01.520 --> 57:05.160]  if we don't make a change in this election.
[57:05.160 --> 57:08.400]  If we have any hope of ending this chaos,
[57:08.400 --> 57:10.880]  we have got to vote for Joe Biden
[57:10.880 --> 57:13.800]  like our lives depend on it.
[57:13.800 --> 57:16.280]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:16.280 --> 57:18.440]  Big Mike's telling you he's gonna break your kneecaps
[57:18.440 --> 57:19.720]  if you don't do what he says.
[57:19.720 --> 57:21.880]  Major universities have just announced
[57:21.880 --> 57:23.800]  that you will not be allowed to leave campus
[57:23.800 --> 57:24.840]  and that you will all have to have
[57:24.840 --> 57:27.480]  a issued cell phone authorized
[57:27.480 --> 57:30.000]  that has a tracker app on it.
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.800]  And that if you leave for the entire semester,
[57:32.800 --> 57:34.120]  you will be expelled.
[57:34.120 --> 57:36.280]  Zero Hughes University is using an app
[57:36.280 --> 57:40.480]  called Spotter EDU to track students' locations on campus.
[57:40.480 --> 57:42.400]  Do you find it creepy that the university
[57:42.400 --> 57:44.920]  has access to your location?
[57:44.920 --> 57:46.520]  Yeah, I don't think that I would be okay
[57:46.520 --> 57:47.400]  with something like that.
[57:47.400 --> 57:49.680]  In regards to privacy and professionalism,
[57:49.680 --> 57:52.960]  I don't think it's necessary for a professor to know why I am.
[57:52.960 --> 57:55.600]  I mean, students pay a lot of money to go to school
[57:55.600 --> 57:57.760]  and if they want to not attend that class,
[57:57.760 --> 57:59.040]  I think that's their choice.
[57:59.040 --> 58:00.640]  Everywhere you go will be tracked.
[58:00.640 --> 58:01.600]  You will live in a bubble.
[58:01.600 --> 58:05.440]  Basically, you'll have a ankle bracelet, but it's a phone.
[58:05.440 --> 58:07.600]  This has been the plan, but now it's official.
[58:07.600 --> 58:08.840]  And that's what Bill Gates is saying.
[58:08.840 --> 58:09.920]  Everyone will have these.
[58:09.920 --> 58:12.160]  You will not leave your house without one.
[58:12.160 --> 58:15.080]  Also, the UN has announced, and it's now happening,
[58:15.080 --> 58:16.560]  they're gonna take your children
[58:16.560 --> 58:18.280]  while they test you and see if you have COVID.
[58:18.280 --> 58:19.640]  So it's about power.
[58:19.640 --> 58:22.440]  It's about total control.
[58:22.440 --> 58:24.640]  I am especially concerned about the well-being
[58:24.640 --> 58:26.080]  of the world's children.
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.440]  Thankfully, children have so far been largely spared
[58:30.440 --> 58:33.520]  from the most severe symptoms of the disease,
[58:33.520 --> 58:36.200]  but their lives are being totally appended.
[58:37.400 --> 58:39.160]  I appeal to families everywhere
[58:39.160 --> 58:42.760]  and leaders at all levels, protect our children.
[58:42.760 --> 58:44.360]  And it's about destroying the economy
[58:44.360 --> 58:45.520]  and vertically integrating things.
[58:45.520 --> 58:46.800]  They also say at these universities,
[58:46.800 --> 58:49.360]  you can only go to the stores, they authorize.
[58:49.360 --> 58:52.480]  And you tattle on people not wearing masks,
[58:52.480 --> 58:53.680]  that it's gonna be those that don't have
[58:53.680 --> 58:56.440]  their inoculation records on the app.
[58:56.440 --> 58:58.880]  This is the dystopian takeover.
[58:58.880 --> 59:00.680]  But humanity is fighting back
[59:00.680 --> 59:02.240]  there's major resistance to it.
[59:02.240 --> 59:05.000]  Because this is a warning for what's coming.
[59:05.000 --> 59:06.480]  It's not gonna be peaceful much longer.
[59:06.480 --> 59:08.160]  It's not gonna be raw raw, it's not gonna be speeches.
[59:08.160 --> 59:09.600]  It's not gonna be down and outside,
[59:09.600 --> 59:10.760]  it's gonna be pledge of allegiance.
[59:10.760 --> 59:12.320]  It's not gonna be waving flags.
[59:12.320 --> 59:13.600]  It's gonna be real.
[59:13.600 --> 59:16.560]  I've been in combat and I never wanted to go back again,
[59:16.560 --> 59:19.200]  but I'm telling you what, I will to save this country.
[59:19.200 --> 59:22.200]  If it has to be against our own citizens, it will happen.
[59:22.200 --> 59:23.880]  And there's a million people like me
[59:23.880 --> 59:25.240]  and you won't stop us.
[59:25.240 --> 59:28.840]  Take the masks off, quit masking and muscling your children,
[59:28.840 --> 59:31.880]  the psychological damage you're doing to them is horrible.
[59:31.880 --> 59:34.840]  I've had six friends kill themselves since it's happened.
[59:34.840 --> 59:36.600]  Veterans who lost their jobs.
[59:36.600 --> 59:38.040]  How do you feel about being complicit
[59:38.040 --> 59:39.200]  in perpetuating that?
[59:39.200 --> 59:41.400]  The greatest coats have perpetuated on the American people.
[59:41.400 --> 59:45.000]  It's one thing to know that the UN announced they want this.
[59:45.000 --> 59:48.960]  It's another thing to see them implement every step
[59:48.960 --> 59:50.720]  of what they said they would.
[59:50.720 --> 59:53.720]  In Spain and in Australia and now in New Zealand,
[59:53.720 --> 59:57.560]  they are taking children from people's homes
[59:57.560 --> 59:59.160]  who are refusing to be COVID tested
[59:59.160 --> 1:00:02.120]  when they shut down whole tower blocks.
[1:00:02.120 --> 1:00:04.320]  Showing that's the weakest point to live in
[1:00:04.320 --> 1:00:05.440]  under globalist control
[1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:07.320]  is in one of those high rises, obviously.
[1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:11.360]  The whole country has moved to alert level two
[1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:12.720]  and that is that of course,
[1:00:12.720 --> 1:00:15.440]  everyone across the country outside of Auckland,
[1:00:15.440 --> 1:00:17.800]  we're asking for social distancing.
[1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:21.000]  We're asking for those limits on mass gatherings again
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:22.800]  and we're asking everyone to keep track
[1:00:22.800 --> 1:00:24.000]  of where they have been.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.440]  But they're treading the police and locals have accepted
[1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:27.680]  and now we have the newscast,
[1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:30.000]  we have the articles that are on infowars.com
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:33.280]  where they signed on to a WHO directive
[1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:37.600]  because that's who directs the COVID hoax response
[1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:39.760]  and they are now taking children.
[1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:41.920]  They specifically mentioned children
[1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:44.760]  and they call it a benefit of the UN.
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:48.000]  Oh, a benefit because if they can train you
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.960]  to see men in uniforms taking your children away,
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:53.880]  they can do anything.
[1:00:53.880 --> 1:00:56.800]  Last Saturday, we made a splash.
[1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:01.840]  So this Saturday, we're doing it again and again.
[1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:06.160]  At 12 noon on August 22nd,
[1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:09.680]  swimming with Alex Jones will commence again
[1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:13.640]  at Barton Springs on the free side,
[1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:16.440]  right here in Austin, Texas.
[1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:19.960]  And this time, we'll have food.
[1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:22.800]  That's right, we're bringing food.
[1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:24.840]  I'm gonna pay for a professional food truck.
[1:01:24.840 --> 1:01:25.680]  Yes!
[1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:30.280]  Come out and show your resistance
[1:01:30.280 --> 1:01:32.720]  to the ridiculous orders against enjoying
[1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:34.800]  the beautiful green belt.
[1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:38.800]  Swimming with Alex Jones this Saturday
[1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:41.800]  at 12 noon at Barton Springs.
[1:01:41.800 --> 1:01:43.120]  See you there.
[1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:44.920]  If we shot at Barton Springs,
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:46.880]  we're gonna see everybody out there.
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:52.880]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[1:01:55.880 --> 1:01:56.880]  Go!
[1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:58.880]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[1:01:58.880 --> 1:01:59.880]  Go!
[1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:05.880]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:10.880]  Mondays or Fridays from 11 a.m.
[1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:11.880]  3 p.m. I'm here live.
[1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:12.880]  I'm ahead of the war with Owen Schreuer.
[1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:13.880]  He comes on after that.
[1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:15.880]  And day by night, 8 a.m. in the morning.
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:16.880]  Doing a great job.
[1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:17.880]  Band-Aid video.
[1:02:17.880 --> 1:02:19.880]  And we're on the satellites.
[1:02:19.880 --> 1:02:20.880]  We're on the shortwave.
[1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:22.880]  We're on the AM, FM, TV stations.
[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:23.880]  All of it.
[1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:25.880]  You can find it in pollwars.com.
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:27.880]  Ford slash show.
[1:02:27.880 --> 1:02:30.880]  Okay, let me just get into this right now.
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:37.880]  When I say I'm gonna be honest with you,
[1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:40.880]  it just means that I don't want to be honest with you.
[1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:45.880]  And by that, all I've got is that I tell people
[1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:46.880]  what I really think.
[1:02:46.880 --> 1:02:47.880]  If I'm joking around, I'll tell you,
[1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:48.880]  but still on the satire,
[1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:49.880]  you get the truth of what I'm doing.
[1:02:49.880 --> 1:02:51.880]  And 99% of the time, I'm being serious.
[1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:53.880]  They always take the satire out of context,
[1:02:53.880 --> 1:02:54.880]  even though I love satire.
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:55.880]  It's a good escape.
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:02:56.880]  It's fun.
[1:02:56.880 --> 1:02:59.880]  I don't do it very much because it's taken out of context,
[1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:01.880]  and I'm not sure that's a good thing.
[1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:04.880]  But man, the enemies winning and in certain ways
[1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:05.880]  are losing and others.
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:06.880]  They're always losing.
[1:03:06.880 --> 1:03:10.880]  The enemies winning and in certain ways are losing and others.
[1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:12.880]  Their whole globalist house of cards is starting to come down,
[1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:15.880]  but their plan to counter that is to implode everything
[1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:17.880]  and get us so distracted with trying to feed ourselves,
[1:03:17.880 --> 1:03:19.880]  they don't get in trouble,
[1:03:19.880 --> 1:03:21.880]  and they run off to all their armored fortresses
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:22.880]  while we kill each other.
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:25.880]  It doesn't mean we don't have real beefs with each other.
[1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:27.880]  It doesn't mean there's not racist white people,
[1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:29.880]  racist black people, racist whatever.
[1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:31.880]  It doesn't mean that there isn't real issues,
[1:03:31.880 --> 1:03:35.880]  but the big New World Order mothership is killing everybody.
[1:03:35.880 --> 1:03:37.880]  And we got to save the ship,
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:39.880]  and then later we want to be idiots and kill each other.
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:40.880]  We can do that.
[1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:45.880]  At least we're not going to blow the planet up.
[1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:46.880]  So I get it.
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:47.880]  I'm not a racist.
[1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:48.880]  I hate somebody because of what color they are.
[1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:50.880]  But I'm dealing with a racist group that doesn't like me
[1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:53.880]  because of what color I am.
[1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:54.880]  I don't like those people.
[1:03:54.880 --> 1:04:00.880]  I get angry at them, and when I'm getting attacked
[1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:01.880]  by that group of people,
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:04.880]  it's going to be white people that come to my aid.
[1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:07.880]  That's the way tribalism works, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:09.880]  and I don't want to punch those buttons
[1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:11.880]  because I punch those buttons,
[1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:14.880]  I personally will become wealthier and more successful
[1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:16.880]  for a little while,
[1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:18.880]  and then we'll all be destroyed together.
[1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:20.880]  Well, that's not when in the game.
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:25.880]  So just from a Machiavellian view, I'm human.
[1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:27.880]  So I've got a pro-human outlook,
[1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:30.880]  but what's the thing I don't want to get into?
[1:04:30.880 --> 1:04:31.880]  And I figured this out.
[1:04:31.880 --> 1:04:36.880]  I'm tempted to stop doing research before and after the show
[1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:38.880]  and just do like a six-hour show,
[1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:41.880]  but where I read it and talk about it for the first time on air.
[1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:43.880]  Because my problem is, when I get in here
[1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:44.880]  and they've got hundreds of articles in front of me,
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:46.880]  I've already seen a lot of it.
[1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:51.880]  And then it's almost like I'm a devil worshiper to look at this.
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:53.880]  I don't want to look at this.
[1:04:53.880 --> 1:04:55.880]  And I don't want to tell you, again,
[1:04:55.880 --> 1:04:56.880]  what I want to do to the people.
[1:04:56.880 --> 1:04:59.880]  You know what I want.
[1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:02.880]  I mean, we're not supposed to be around stuff like this.
[1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:04.880]  They bombard us with this.
[1:05:04.880 --> 1:05:07.880]  So I went and reviewed this morning and last night
[1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:10.880]  what they're putting on TV for kids, man.
[1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:12.880]  And I can't handle it.
[1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:14.880]  I mean, I want to start killing people.
[1:05:14.880 --> 1:05:17.880]  I'm going to be, I can't get it off the screen.
[1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:18.880]  I'm not kidding around, folks.
[1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:23.880]  I'm at my breaking point.
[1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:26.880]  Because there's a certain Satanism to this
[1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:28.880]  that they just normalize it.
[1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:30.880]  You know, it's out in the open and now we talk about it
[1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:36.880]  and they don't even get in trouble and we do.
[1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:37.880]  And that's not all.
[1:05:37.880 --> 1:05:39.880]  I went this morning.
[1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:42.880]  I got up at 4am and I saw this story at like 5am
[1:05:42.880 --> 1:05:43.880]  and I went on God.
[1:05:43.880 --> 1:05:44.880]  I remember that trailer.
[1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:47.880]  I went and watched it and then I went and looked at some others
[1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:51.880]  and I was walking down the stairs
[1:05:51.880 --> 1:05:57.880]  and I started dry heaving and throwing up on the floor.
[1:05:57.880 --> 1:05:59.880]  And I actually stumbled into a side bedroom
[1:05:59.880 --> 1:06:01.880]  and laid on the ground for about 30 minutes.
[1:06:01.880 --> 1:06:03.880]  And I'm not saying that to like get your sympathy.
[1:06:03.880 --> 1:06:04.880]  I'm not a victim.
[1:06:04.880 --> 1:06:05.880]  I'm a war.
[1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:07.880]  I can't handle these people, man.
[1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:09.880]  They got our kids.
[1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:13.880]  They're ruining their lives and they're laughing at us.
[1:06:13.880 --> 1:06:17.880]  And it's not normal to come up here and make it an outrage
[1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:20.880]  that we just talk about what they're doing.
[1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:24.880]  I can't look at it because you know what?
[1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:27.880]  We know what they did to the little kid once they took them in there
[1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:32.880]  and they show you on TV what they did.
[1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:35.880]  Adults can't handle looking at these crime videos.
[1:06:35.880 --> 1:06:42.880]  Police can't handle it and they do it out in the open.
[1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:44.880]  In fact, now I can't even, I go to that place.
[1:06:44.880 --> 1:06:47.880]  I just, I can't even do it.
[1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:48.880]  And it's not, people have been listening a long time
[1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:49.880]  to why didn't you see this thing where I go,
[1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:50.880]  I can't do the show anymore.
[1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:53.880]  This is a new thing the last year.
[1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:57.880]  And it's because I just, I know you're overloaded too.
[1:06:57.880 --> 1:06:58.880]  And that's what the enemies try to do.
[1:06:58.880 --> 1:07:00.880]  So we have to give it to God and say,
[1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:02.880]  God, I'm just going to get the information out
[1:07:02.880 --> 1:07:05.880]  and I'm not going to let myself take on the pain of this.
[1:07:05.880 --> 1:07:07.880]  But then it's a double-edged sword and God goes,
[1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:12.880]  no, you're supposed to take on the pain.
[1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:14.880]  God's like, I took on all of it.
[1:07:14.880 --> 1:07:17.880]  You can't even look at it, one little piece,
[1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:20.880]  get your ass up and stop being a wimp.
[1:07:20.880 --> 1:07:22.880]  So I'll be honest, I'm a wimp.
[1:07:22.880 --> 1:07:23.880]  But that's the process.
[1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:25.880]  And that's, you know, it is, we just,
[1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:28.880]  but then I look at people who won't even look at this
[1:07:28.880 --> 1:07:30.880]  and won't even speak out against it.
[1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:34.880]  And I hate you more than the devil worshiping pedophiles
[1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:38.880]  because you can stop it.
[1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:40.880]  But you don't.
[1:07:40.880 --> 1:07:46.880]  So I don't like what the collapse is coming
[1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:48.880]  because I know it's not going to be fun.
[1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:50.880]  But you know what, we all deserve it.
[1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:52.880]  And so all of you that have been on the fence
[1:07:52.880 --> 1:07:54.880]  that think all this Satanism is funny
[1:07:54.880 --> 1:07:56.880]  and think going along with it's funny
[1:07:56.880 --> 1:07:59.880]  and think you're powerful because you don't care.
[1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:02.880]  You think you're strong because you don't care about anybody
[1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:04.880]  and you've got your little world
[1:08:04.880 --> 1:08:05.880]  and that's all you care about.
[1:08:05.880 --> 1:08:16.880]  Your little empty plastic world is going to be destroyed.
[1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:18.880]  And you're too stupid to even know it.
[1:08:18.880 --> 1:08:20.880]  I sit there and I talk to these sociopaths
[1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:22.880]  and I explain to them, I go,
[1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:25.880]  you understand that once there's no morals
[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:27.880]  and once there's no conscience
[1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:30.880]  and once things collapse, you live in this satanic fantasy world
[1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:32.880]  where you can just crap over whoever you want
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:34.880]  and nothing ever comes back.
[1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:37.880]  Don't you understand that it comes back on you very quickly?
[1:08:37.880 --> 1:08:39.880]  But Satanists can't think.
[1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:41.880]  Two step, three step, four step, five step,
[1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:43.880]  six step, seven step, eight step
[1:08:43.880 --> 1:08:46.880]  because they don't have God.
[1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:49.880]  I have discernment because I'm tied into God.
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:52.880]  I'm not bragging about it. I've got a million steps.
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:54.880]  I can see all of it.
[1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:56.880]  And let me tell you, I don't like seeing it.
[1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:58.880]  So maybe that's why these people are like this.
[1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:01.880]  But my God, if you decide you don't want to see the truth
[1:09:01.880 --> 1:09:04.880]  and don't want to stand up, just don't be so smiley-faced
[1:09:04.880 --> 1:09:06.880]  about it like it's funny because it ain't funny.
[1:09:06.880 --> 1:09:08.880]  You want to live a few more years
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:10.880]  and drive your Porsche around
[1:09:10.880 --> 1:09:12.880]  and act cool at the country club, go ahead
[1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:14.880]  but know you're like a man eating his last meal
[1:09:14.880 --> 1:09:16.880]  going up before a firing squad
[1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:19.880]  because if you were actually self-serving
[1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:21.880]  you would want morality
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:23.880]  even if you're a sociopath
[1:09:23.880 --> 1:09:25.880]  but there's something about sociopaths
[1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:27.880]  and psychopaths who have a spirit of evil
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:29.880]  they're destroying themselves
[1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:32.880]  along with all of us
[1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:35.880]  because their selfishness
[1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:46.880]  is absolutely who they are.
[1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:48.880]  They know why they flaunt this pedophilia
[1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:50.880]  and this Satanism in front of us
[1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:52.880]  because they know people that don't like it
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:55.880]  turn away from it and just give them control the field.
[1:09:55.880 --> 1:09:57.880]  No, I'm going to look at all of it
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:09:59.880]  and I'm going to attack it all
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:02.880]  and I'm going to put the most horrible things on air.
[1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:04.880]  And when the TV stations call up and say,
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:06.880]  you can't put it on, I go, well, that's what five-year-olds are shown.
[1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:08.880]  You think I want to look at that?
[1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:10.880]  You think I want to look at that?
[1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:13.880]  You think I like that?
[1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:16.880]  What I want to do
[1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:18.880]  and you know what I want to do
[1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:20.880]  is get these people off the children
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:23.880]  and off of us, you think they just want to rape children?
[1:10:23.880 --> 1:10:25.880]  They want to rape your mind,
[1:10:25.880 --> 1:10:27.880]  they want to rape your cells,
[1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:29.880]  they want to rape your DNA,
[1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:31.880]  they want to rape your future,
[1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:33.880]  they want to rape everything
[1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:35.880]  they don't want to love people,
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:37.880]  they don't want to nurture things,
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:39.880]  they want to cut stuff down,
[1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:41.880]  they want to burn it to the ground.
[1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:43.880]  Well, good.
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:46.880]  Because all of you parasites that love death so much,
[1:10:46.880 --> 1:10:48.880]  you're going to burn
[1:10:48.880 --> 1:10:51.880]  and you're going to burn very, very slowly forever.
[1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:53.880]  And so that's why justice works that way.
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:55.880]  What you are
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:57.880]  is what you become forever.
[1:10:57.880 --> 1:10:59.880]  You burn us, you hurt us,
[1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:02.880]  you torture us, you will be that forever.
[1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:04.880]  God doesn't cast you into a lake of fire.
[1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:07.880]  You are the lake of fire.
[1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:12.880]  So you just enjoy yourselves
[1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:15.880]  all day long while you piss on everything
[1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:17.880]  because you're done.
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:22.880]  And so it's like when the police
[1:11:22.880 --> 1:11:24.880]  bust some serial killer with 20 bodies
[1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:26.880]  buried in the backyard or in the basement
[1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:28.880]  or in their walls.
[1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:30.880]  And it's disgusting and it stinks
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:32.880]  and they're looking at all of it
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:34.880]  and they've shot video of it,
[1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:36.880]  but at least the guys busted and they can do it anymore.
[1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:38.880]  It's a good thing when you find them.
[1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:40.880]  It's a good thing when you dig them up
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:42.880]  and you deliver the little kids back to their parents
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:44.880]  so they have a proper burial
[1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:46.880]  because at least they got stopped.
[1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:48.880]  So those of you that say I'm obscene
[1:11:48.880 --> 1:11:50.880]  because I cover this, no!
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:52.880]  I am here and you are here to destroy them.
[1:11:52.880 --> 1:11:54.880]  I'm going to say something right now
[1:11:54.880 --> 1:11:56.880]  that is one of the most important things I've ever said,
[1:11:56.880 --> 1:11:58.880]  so please listen very, very carefully.
[1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:00.880]  Donald Trump
[1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:02.880]  is not the reason they released COVID
[1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:04.880]  or had the lockdown.
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:06.880]  They already had this plan, the Rockefeller Foundation
[1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:08.880]  and Bill of Melinda Gates.
[1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:10.880]  It is beyond critical.
[1:12:10.880 --> 1:12:12.880]  It is life and death for you and your family
[1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:14.880]  to understand no matter where you live on the planet
[1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:16.880]  that this is a worldwide world government
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:18.880]  takeover on record
[1:12:18.880 --> 1:12:20.880]  that it's never going to end.
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:22.880]  The United Nations has admitted that.
[1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:24.880]  First it's a month, then it's six months,
[1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:26.880]  then they say okay it's two years.
[1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:28.880]  They're now saying two years.
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:30.880]  They're now saying you'll never go back to normal.
[1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:32.880]  No more gatherings, no more anything.
[1:12:32.880 --> 1:12:34.880]  Constant force inoculations
[1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:36.880]  that they admit don't even work.
[1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:38.880]  In the way they say they work,
[1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:40.880]  they change your DNA.
[1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:42.880]  This is the culling of the planet.
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:44.880]  This is the beginning
[1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:46.880]  of a straight jacket being put on you
[1:12:46.880 --> 1:12:48.880]  before you're slowly tortured to death
[1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:50.880]  and killed. Do you understand?
[1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:52.880]  It was a sleeper product.
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:54.880]  It wasn't popular at first.
[1:12:54.880 --> 1:12:56.880]  But as people tried it,
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:12:58.880]  it's become one of our top five best sellers.
[1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:00.880]  I'm talking about the eight pack power stack.
[1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:02.880]  13 different pills
[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:04.880]  filled with super nutrients,

[1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:18.880]  that's now back in stock.
[1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:20.880]  This has changed my life and so many other people's lives.

[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:24.880]  that are in eight pack power stack
[1:13:24.880 --> 1:13:26.880]  because of the shutdown

[1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:28.880]  I have critical
[1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:30.880]  microcosm news for you
[1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:32.880]  that affects Agenda 21
[1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:34.880]  Agenda 2030 and the entire planet.
[1:14:34.880 --> 1:14:36.880]  My wife
[1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:38.880]  and my wife
[1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:40.880]  and my wife
[1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:42.880]  and my wife
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:44.880]  my wife
[1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:46.880]  a few weeks ago
[1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:48.880]  tried to go on the hiking bike trail
[1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:50.880]  near our house
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:52.880]  and they had people there with clipboard
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:54.880]  saying they're not allowed to go in
[1:14:54.880 --> 1:14:56.880]  COVID-19 to the giant green belt
[1:14:56.880 --> 1:14:58.880]  that's again 98,000 acres
[1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:00.880]  just one piece of it
[1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:02.880]  with beautiful creeks and everything else.
[1:15:02.880 --> 1:15:04.880]  Well, she's so lenient
[1:15:04.880 --> 1:15:06.880]  she ignored them but she came back
[1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:08.880]  after she went with her friend for a hike
[1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:10.880]  and
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:12.880]  I called one security guy
[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:14.880]  and I called a camera guy, Gregory's
[1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:16.880]  we went over there
[1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:18.880]  and then of course the media edited it down to a minute
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:20.880]  where I was just yelling at random people
[1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:22.880]  no, see the glass window they put up
[1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:24.880]  they called seven police cars on me
[1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:26.880]  and the police say listen
[1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:28.880]  there's no ordinances, this is unenforceable
[1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:32.880]  and the cops after we turned the cameras off
[1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:34.880]  were listeners and said they agreed with us
[1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:36.880]  I don't get them in too much trouble
[1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:38.880]  but they obviously want to go after robbers
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:40.880]  and child molesters
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:42.880]  and burglars and people like that
[1:15:42.880 --> 1:15:44.880]  they don't need to be in a trail they had one of dozens
[1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:46.880]  one of hundreds actually but one of the top ten
[1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:48.880]  or so, that was the whole life
[1:15:48.880 --> 1:15:50.880]  well I said oh we're going to be out there
[1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:52.880]  this next Saturday
[1:15:52.880 --> 1:15:54.880]  we're going to march down to Swimming Barton Creek
[1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:56.880]  well we get out there it's a hundred and five
[1:15:56.880 --> 1:15:58.880]  I'm not thinking we got to march down
[1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:00.880]  that's one of the longest entrances, I apologize
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:02.880]  so then I said last weekend it was so much fun
[1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:04.880]  about 200 people showed up or more
[1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:06.880]  I said let's go to actual Barton Springs
[1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:08.880]  where it's Barton Creek empties into it
[1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:10.880]  but it's a big deep spring
[1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:12.880]  comes out like 68 degrees
[1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:14.880]  it's about 70 degrees mixed with a creek
[1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:16.880]  and then it dumps into the Colorado River
[1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:18.880]  they got paddle boarders and you know
[1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:20.880]  all the folks are already there, they rent kayaks canoes
[1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:22.880]  but there's a park that's
[1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:24.880]  paid that's just a damned up
[1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:26.880]  um
[1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:28.880]  spring
[1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:30.880]  well they'd close that and then you get reservations
[1:16:30.880 --> 1:16:32.880]  so I said we'll just go to the free part
[1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:34.880]  just south of
[1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:36.880]  Barton Springs, it's called the monkey tree
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:38.880]  and I'm going to order a food truck
[1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:40.880]  come there, well guess what
[1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:42.880]  we got a call from inside
[1:16:42.880 --> 1:16:44.880]  the park service in Austin for one of our sources
[1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:46.880]  they just filled us in
[1:16:46.880 --> 1:16:48.880]  they had a big task force meeting about this
[1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:50.880]  they're trying to get APD to come out there
[1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:52.880]  and stop us, APD is going to basically
[1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:54.880]  the word is refuse, it's unenforceable
[1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:56.880]  assignment of law, everybody's already out there
[1:16:56.880 --> 1:16:58.880]  the parks are open, they try to keep them closed
[1:16:58.880 --> 1:17:00.880]  everyone just ignored them and the police
[1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:02.880]  refused to arrest people the last six months
[1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:04.880]  going to Zilker, going everywhere
[1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:06.880]  the cops know it's BS, it's outside in the sun
[1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:08.880]  even you believe the COVID-19
[1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:10.880]  and so the cops have the same
[1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:12.880]  city council that has their proposal to burn down
[1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:14.880]  the city council
[1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:16.880]  excuse me for any slip, to blow up
[1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:18.880]  the police station
[1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:20.880]  I said we should have a lot of
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:22.880]  controlled demolition of the city council
[1:17:22.880 --> 1:17:24.880]  they said the police department isn't
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:26.880]  is it viable
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:28.880]  but seriously this is going on
[1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:30.880]  and so
[1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:32.880]  they're going to try to have the police out there
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:34.880]  as a threat to arrest you
[1:17:34.880 --> 1:17:36.880]  if you get in Barton Creek
[1:17:36.880 --> 1:17:38.880]  that comes out of the springs
[1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:40.880]  goes for about 300 yards
[1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:42.880]  and then runs into the river
[1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:44.880]  they can't stop anybody
[1:17:44.880 --> 1:17:46.880]  the police I guarantee you know it's unenforceable
[1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:48.880]  it's unlawful
[1:17:48.880 --> 1:17:50.880]  so I'll be there
[1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:52.880]  12 noon tomorrow
[1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:54.880]  I'm not going to say what restaurant has agreed
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:56.880]  to drive a truck up
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:58.880]  and deliver us 500 sandwiches
[1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:00.880]  people don't want food to come out of this
[1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:02.880]  I just want us to all have a communal event together
[1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:04.880]  this isn't like loaves and fishes
[1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:06.880]  this is just us having fun
[1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:08.880]  but this is crazy in 2020
[1:18:08.880 --> 1:18:10.880]  you've got to do this
[1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:12.880]  that
[1:18:12.880 --> 1:18:14.880]  we have to do this
[1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:16.880]  in America
[1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:18.880]  it's absolutely
[1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:20.880]  totally insane
[1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:22.880]  here's Barton Creek that comes in
[1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:24.880]  right here
[1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:26.880]  and then it goes under a spillway
[1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:28.880]  and gets diverted
[1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:30.880]  but this is the spring that's dammed up
[1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:32.880]  we're all going to meet
[1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:34.880]  right over here
[1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:36.880]  by the Pagan Grove picnic area
[1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:38.880]  and Zilker Park it's all beautiful
[1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:40.880]  they can't stop it, it's not closed
[1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:42.880]  this is not being closed
[1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:44.880]  they're just saying it's closed because we're coming
[1:18:44.880 --> 1:18:46.880]  they already reopened all this
[1:18:48.880 --> 1:18:50.880]  it's all color of law
[1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:52.880]  here's Savannah Hernandez
[1:18:52.880 --> 1:18:54.880]  as part of her report this at Band-Aid video
[1:18:54.880 --> 1:18:56.880]  tomorrow high noon
[1:18:56.880 --> 1:18:58.880]  we'll be back after the break with Savannah Hernandez
[1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:04.880]  Barton Springs tomorrow
[1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:08.880]  don't piss Savannah Hernandez off
[1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:16.880]  hey guy how'd you get in there
[1:19:16.880 --> 1:19:18.880]  they must have just put this up
[1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:20.880]  cause this was flat
[1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:22.880]  like today? this morning?
[1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:24.880]  really?
[1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:26.880]  just go under it
[1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:28.880]  okay guys so as you can see
[1:19:28.880 --> 1:19:30.880]  no one in Austin gives a dam
[1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:32.880]  about this blockade
[1:19:32.880 --> 1:19:34.880]  so I want to point something out to you guys
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:36.880]  now Alex went viral on twitter
[1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:38.880]  because he was at Barton Springs
[1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:40.880]  they wouldn't let him in apparently you now need a reservation
[1:19:40.880 --> 1:19:42.880]  but this is the free side
[1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:44.880]  of Barton Springs there's a pay side and a free side
[1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:46.880]  this is the free side
[1:19:46.880 --> 1:19:48.880]  it's just a part of nature just like Zilker Park
[1:19:48.880 --> 1:19:50.880]  it's a big ass grass field where people can go
[1:19:50.880 --> 1:19:52.880]  and this is the free side of Barton
[1:19:52.880 --> 1:19:54.880]  and you have this huge
[1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:56.880]  freaking thing here
[1:19:56.880 --> 1:19:58.880]  so I'm just gonna you know public service right now
[1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:02.880]  I'm sorry but someone's gotta do it
[1:20:04.880 --> 1:20:06.880]  is this a crime?
[1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:08.880]  oh look the lifeguards are coming oh sh**
[1:20:12.880 --> 1:20:14.880]  hey guys so we're now
[1:20:14.880 --> 1:20:16.880]  in the free side of Barton and did you guys
[1:20:16.880 --> 1:20:18.880]  see how easy that was? no face masks
[1:20:18.880 --> 1:20:20.880]  no fines, no police officers
[1:20:20.880 --> 1:20:22.880]  no one's stopping us from doing this
[1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:24.880]  why? because this is nature
[1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:26.880]  and we in Austin the people who pay
[1:20:26.880 --> 1:20:28.880]  the taxpayers who pay for all of these
[1:20:28.880 --> 1:20:30.880]  natural parks should be able to
[1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:32.880]  access them so here we are
[1:20:32.880 --> 1:20:34.880]  in Barton now and as you guys can see in front of me
[1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:36.880]  there's so many people in here
[1:20:36.880 --> 1:20:38.880]  why? because nobody
[1:20:38.880 --> 1:20:40.880]  cares about these mandates anymore
[1:20:40.880 --> 1:20:42.880]  for COVID-19 everyone knows
[1:20:42.880 --> 1:20:44.880]  it's ridiculous there's no overrun hospitals
[1:20:44.880 --> 1:20:46.880]  here in Austin people are not dying in streets
[1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:48.880]  and people should be
[1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:50.880]  able to go outside for their own
[1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:52.880]  personal health and experience nature
[1:20:56.880 --> 1:20:58.880]  you know guys I've been stuck inside of my apartment
[1:20:58.880 --> 1:21:00.880]  for the past three months because of the year after
[1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:02.880]  this full sh** locked down orders
[1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:04.880]  and it's time to rage
[1:21:10.880 --> 1:21:12.880]  America, oh America
[1:21:12.880 --> 1:21:14.880]  this is real civil disobedience
[1:21:14.880 --> 1:21:16.880]  these criminals
[1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:18.880]  are trying to block everything
[1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:20.880]  they're just at the end of the world
[1:21:20.880 --> 1:21:22.880]  and Michelle Obama
[1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:26.880]  is telling us that it's never going to end
[1:21:26.880 --> 1:21:28.880]  if we vote Trump they're doing all this
[1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:30.880]  to make us feel depressed
[1:21:30.880 --> 1:21:32.880]  to make us feel sad and then they admit they are
[1:21:32.880 --> 1:21:34.880]  action seven
[1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:36.880]  opens Barton Springs to public
[1:21:36.880 --> 1:21:38.880]  I saw Savannah do this a few days after
[1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:40.880]  I went down there to another part of it
[1:21:40.880 --> 1:21:42.880]  some desolate corner where I go hiking
[1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:44.880]  why not lead people to where I go hiking for 10 miles
[1:21:44.880 --> 1:21:46.880]  sorry this is
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:48.880]  50 yards from the parking
[1:21:48.880 --> 1:21:50.880]  100 yards max
[1:21:50.880 --> 1:21:52.880]  and there's no steep rage, no nothing
[1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:54.880]  there's plenty of rocks and stuff to break your ankles
[1:21:54.880 --> 1:21:56.880]  so you'll be safe
[1:21:56.880 --> 1:21:58.880]  but they've tried to close all of this
[1:21:58.880 --> 1:22:00.880]  and I'm not putting up with it
[1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:02.880]  and I'm going swimming the free side of Barton Springs
[1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:04.880]  has always been fun I've been going there since I was
[1:22:04.880 --> 1:22:06.880]  three years old
[1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:08.880]  and again they dammed it up
[1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:10.880]  they charged you at the park
[1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:12.880]  they don't want you to go to the free part
[1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:14.880]  what a bunch of control freaks having a big emergency meeting
[1:22:14.880 --> 1:22:16.880]  at Austin Parks and Recreation
[1:22:16.880 --> 1:22:18.880]  about how they must stop Austinites
[1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:20.880]  oh they want people to burn down the police station
[1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:22.880]  and kill people and run checkpoints
[1:22:22.880 --> 1:22:24.880]  and antifub it oh my gosh
[1:22:24.880 --> 1:22:26.880]  Austinites you don't go get in the water
[1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:30.880]  if they try to block me
[1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:32.880]  I'm not going to stop the police
[1:22:32.880 --> 1:22:34.880]  I'm going to go down and put a mask and a snorkel on
[1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:36.880]  and swim up it and come in like a navy seal
[1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:38.880]  of course navy seals can't swim most of the time
[1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:40.880]  but I can so
[1:22:40.880 --> 1:22:42.880]  that's all coming up tomorrow
[1:22:42.880 --> 1:22:44.880]  I want to see you there this is going to be fun
[1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:46.880]  fun fun fun fun
[1:22:46.880 --> 1:22:48.880]  high noon
[1:22:50.880 --> 1:22:52.880]  you can really break civilizations
[1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:54.880]  down to two types
[1:22:54.880 --> 1:22:56.880]  predatory
[1:22:56.880 --> 1:22:58.880]  and non predatory
[1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:00.880]  or oppressive conquest based
[1:23:00.880 --> 1:23:02.880]  or renaissance based
[1:23:02.880 --> 1:23:04.880]  and of course different types of civilizations
[1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:06.880]  and countries and political systems
[1:23:06.880 --> 1:23:08.880]  and history and of the present
[1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:10.880]  are mixes of the two
[1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:12.880]  but with globalism it is a
[1:23:12.880 --> 1:23:14.880]  post human
[1:23:14.880 --> 1:23:16.880]  ideology
[1:23:16.880 --> 1:23:18.880]  so it's scientifically geared
[1:23:18.880 --> 1:23:20.880]  to be oppressive
[1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:22.880]  and the rationale is social Darwinism
[1:23:22.880 --> 1:23:24.880]  that the ruling class are elites
[1:23:24.880 --> 1:23:26.880]  and because they're in power
[1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:28.880]  they have a right to rule over you
[1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:30.880]  poison you, dumb you down
[1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:32.880]  sterilize you and kill you
[1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:34.880]  so all the people wearing masks
[1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:36.880]  at the park and stuff
[1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:38.880]  are living in a total hoax and think their active
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:40.880]  submission is an act of
[1:23:40.880 --> 1:23:42.880]  working for the common good in a collective
[1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:44.880]  no it's a sign that you're a slave
[1:23:44.880 --> 1:23:46.880]  that will take the force inoculations
[1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:48.880]  federal government and Yale are studying
[1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:50.880]  the force inoculations right now
[1:23:50.880 --> 1:23:52.880]  incrementalism
[1:23:52.880 --> 1:23:54.880]  the inchworm effect
[1:23:54.880 --> 1:23:56.880]  successive approximation
[1:23:56.880 --> 1:23:58.880]  first they tell you only stay in your house for 15 days
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:00.880]  so the hospitals can stay empty
[1:24:00.880 --> 1:24:02.880]  that was all a fraud
[1:24:02.880 --> 1:24:04.880]  then wear a mask for a month
[1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:06.880]  here we are six months later
[1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:08.880]  then they start making people at colleges
[1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:10.880]  and at big corporations where
[1:24:10.880 --> 1:24:12.880]  wristbands showing that
[1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:14.880]  they've been quote contact traced
[1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:16.880]  and tested for COVID
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:18.880]  then comes the apps on your phones
[1:24:18.880 --> 1:24:20.880]  and the global social credit score
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:22.880]  now being rolled out by Virginia
[1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:24.880]  California and others it's not coming
[1:24:24.880 --> 1:24:26.880]  it's here and then the inoculations
[1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:28.880]  if you ever want to leave your house
[1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:30.880]  which amounts to force inoculations
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:32.880]  this is the medical tyranny takeover
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:34.880]  these are not classic vaccines
[1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:36.880]  that have their own problems
[1:24:36.880 --> 1:24:38.880]  these are DNA vaccines that change
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:40.880]  your DNA and are having massive
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:42.880]  serious side effects
[1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:44.880]  guaranteed this is about depopulation
[1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:46.880]  Bill Gates admits that
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:48.880]  this is an emergency resist or die
[1:24:48.880 --> 1:25:08.880]  the new world order is here
[1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:46.880]  the new world order is here
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:56.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:18.880]  but you kept it going till the sun fell down
[1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:36.880]  you kept it going
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:38.880]  welcome back
[1:26:38.880 --> 1:26:40.880]  alright I got a lot of international news
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:42.880]  a lot of national news
[1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:44.880]  a lot of really important stuff to cover
[1:26:44.880 --> 1:26:46.880]  but
[1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:48.880]  but I need to put
[1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:50.880]  bookends on what I just covered earlier
[1:26:50.880 --> 1:26:52.880]  the city of Austin
[1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:54.880]  has declared a secret parks
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:26:56.880]  and recreation department emergency
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:26:58.880]  that's what they're calling it
[1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:00.880]  a secret emergency
[1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:02.880]  that we went down
[1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:04.880]  last weekend with over 200 people
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:06.880]  and marched down a trail
[1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:08.880]  and jumped in Barton Creek
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:10.880]  and showed how it's totally empty
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:12.880]  and no one was there
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:14.880]  with huge canyons and woods
[1:27:14.880 --> 1:27:16.880]  and so I said
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:18.880]  let's go to the Barton Springs itself
[1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:20.880]  where it's pouring out
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:22.880]  where it's cold
[1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:24.880]  where there's a paid park area that then spillways over
[1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:26.880]  for 300 yards
[1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:28.880]  into the Colorado River
[1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:30.880]  where people are always there with their dogs
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:32.880]  always swimming, always having fun
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:34.880]  and we talked to the folks inside
[1:27:34.880 --> 1:27:36.880]  they called, they said it's incredible
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:38.880]  they're acting like the Comanches
[1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:40.880]  are coming to scalp everybody
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:42.880]  they're asking for police
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:44.880]  and they want all the security
[1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:46.880]  and they want to stop from going even near
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:48.880]  the river
[1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:50.880]  or near the springs
[1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:52.880]  even though everybody just ignores it
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:54.880]  and is already down there
[1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:56.880]  so that's us upstream from it
[1:27:56.880 --> 1:27:58.880]  under that is a big
[1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:00.880]  aquifer
[1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:02.880]  under where the creek is
[1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:04.880]  is an aquifer of 68 degree water
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:06.880]  that comes out by the Colorado
[1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:08.880]  that's where we're going
[1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:10.880]  down Austin
[1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:12.880]  but imagine that
[1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:14.880]  where they're having full meetings
[1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:16.880]  hundreds of people just scared
[1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:18.880]  that their hoax is being called
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:22.880]  they tried to close the parks for months
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:24.880]  everybody just showed up
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:26.880]  so now they make you COVID register
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:28.880]  and come over and eat your name
[1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:30.880]  and put you in a database
[1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:32.880]  then count you as a COVID person, run scams on you
[1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:34.880]  it's the left becoming law enforcement
[1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:36.880]  is what it is and the police understand this
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:38.880]  and the word is the police are not going to
[1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:40.880]  enforce their wish to arrest people
[1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:42.880]  but if I got arrested tomorrow, so be it
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:44.880]  Rosa Parks got arrested
[1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:46.880]  if we're not sitting at the back of the bus
[1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:48.880]  I get arrested, you know, it's batted up
[1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:50.880]  so at the back of the bus, how about you can't even get on a bus
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:52.880]  and that's another key thing I haven't gotten to
[1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:56.880]  I'll cover it next segment
[1:28:56.880 --> 1:28:58.880]  because I'm just too flustered right now
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:00.880]  I get so much data during the breaks
[1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:02.880]  it's nobody's fault, it's just like
[1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:04.880]  processing it all because
[1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:06.880]  you're like a break and I run out and don't tell you
[1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:08.880]  they're declared a secret
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:10.880]  emergency
[1:29:10.880 --> 1:29:12.880]  and the stuff I was hearing, I mean it's just
[1:29:14.880 --> 1:29:16.880]  and then I saw the text messages
[1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:18.880]  from the Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii
[1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:20.880]  how starting by next year
[1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:22.880]  if you don't take all the inoculations
[1:29:22.880 --> 1:29:24.880]  whatever the UN says
[1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:26.880]  it says, whatever the UN says
[1:29:26.880 --> 1:29:28.880]  you can't leave your house
[1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:30.880]  well what happens when your
[1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:32.880]  power gets turned off, they're going to evict you
[1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:34.880]  I mean the mark of the beast is like
[1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:36.880]  here
[1:29:36.880 --> 1:29:38.880]  so
[1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:40.880]  God, I knew the Lord was coming
[1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:42.880]  man, they told me
[1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:46.880]  although they did say they lock everybody down
[1:29:46.880 --> 1:29:48.880]  under a virus so it's their own record
[1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:50.880]  that's why I made films about it but
[1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:52.880]  it's the one thing to read about it
[1:29:54.880 --> 1:29:56.880]  it's another thing to be there
[1:29:56.880 --> 1:29:58.880]  and
[1:30:00.880 --> 1:30:02.880]  to actually
[1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:04.880]  have your wife come home
[1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:06.880]  and I'm cooking eggs and pancakes
[1:30:06.880 --> 1:30:08.880]  for the children
[1:30:08.880 --> 1:30:10.880]  and she comes in at nine going well
[1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:12.880]  whatever, they tried to throw me out of the park
[1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:14.880]  the green bell and I'm like huh
[1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:16.880]  it's just it's
[1:30:16.880 --> 1:30:18.880]  ridiculous
[1:30:18.880 --> 1:30:20.880]  and it's all based on lies
[1:30:20.880 --> 1:30:22.880]  and they admit it's based on lies
[1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:24.880]  let me do this
[1:30:30.880 --> 1:30:32.880]  I'm ready to cover this but I've got like four stacks
[1:30:32.880 --> 1:30:34.880]  I've got to get lined up during the break to make sure I hit every piece of this
[1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:36.880]  because it all ties together just today's news
[1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:38.880]  is again a
[1:30:38.880 --> 1:30:40.880]  painting
[1:30:40.880 --> 1:30:42.880]  a seismic cart at gestalt
[1:30:44.880 --> 1:30:46.880]  of what's going on and it's just unbelievable
[1:30:46.880 --> 1:30:48.880]  separately
[1:30:48.880 --> 1:30:52.880]  you don't just need the products we sell
[1:30:52.880 --> 1:30:54.880]  because it funds this operation
[1:30:56.880 --> 1:30:58.880]  if I could fund myself off donations
[1:30:58.880 --> 1:31:00.880]  I'd do that all day long if some billionaire came along
[1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:02.880]  and said here's the millions of dollars you need to run this
[1:31:02.880 --> 1:31:04.880]  every month
[1:31:04.880 --> 1:31:06.880]  and
[1:31:06.880 --> 1:31:08.880]  no strings attached
[1:31:08.880 --> 1:31:10.880]  I'd say actually you can have my left arm
[1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:12.880]  you're just not going to control what I say
[1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:14.880]  in fact if some billionaire came along
[1:31:14.880 --> 1:31:16.880]  and said here's $500 million
[1:31:16.880 --> 1:31:18.880]  whatever you want
[1:31:18.880 --> 1:31:20.880]  but I want your left arm
[1:31:20.880 --> 1:31:22.880]  I'd say chop that sucker off right now
[1:31:22.880 --> 1:31:24.880]  get the surgeon ready
[1:31:26.880 --> 1:31:28.880]  because I could wage war on them
[1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:30.880]  so I mean and here's the thing
[1:31:30.880 --> 1:31:32.880]  cars are nice
[1:31:32.880 --> 1:31:34.880]  houses are nice but it's about security I don't worship them
[1:31:34.880 --> 1:31:36.880]  money put into films
[1:31:36.880 --> 1:31:38.880]  and reporters and justice
[1:31:38.880 --> 1:31:40.880]  and freedom and staying alive
[1:31:40.880 --> 1:31:42.880]  when they want to shut you down and challenging them
[1:31:42.880 --> 1:31:44.880]  and having victory almost every time we fight back
[1:31:44.880 --> 1:31:46.880]  I just want to be on that field baby
[1:31:48.880 --> 1:31:50.880]  I want you to keep me on that field
[1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:52.880]  and I want to promote prosperity for everybody
[1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:54.880]  and justice and I'll just be quite frank with you
[1:31:54.880 --> 1:31:56.880]  I'm not fatalistic
[1:31:56.880 --> 1:31:58.880]  but when you get to this level of the fight
[1:31:58.880 --> 1:32:00.880]  you become fatalistic
[1:32:00.880 --> 1:32:02.880]  you become very good friends with death
[1:32:02.880 --> 1:32:04.880]  and I'll never commit suicide
[1:32:04.880 --> 1:32:06.880]  my god I'll be like Darth Vader trying to stay alive
[1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:08.880]  but I don't fear the death
[1:32:08.880 --> 1:32:10.880]  they put a gun to my head
[1:32:10.880 --> 1:32:12.880]  and told me to support their Satanism
[1:32:12.880 --> 1:32:14.880]  because that's my
[1:32:14.880 --> 1:32:16.880]  integrity that's not heroism
[1:32:16.880 --> 1:32:18.880]  that's not power
[1:32:18.880 --> 1:32:20.880]  that's who I am
[1:32:20.880 --> 1:32:22.880]  it's not heroic
[1:32:22.880 --> 1:32:24.880]  it's not stoic
[1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:26.880]  it's not manly it's who you are
[1:32:26.880 --> 1:32:28.880]  I mean that's simple
[1:32:28.880 --> 1:32:30.880]  that's not hard
[1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:32.880]  and we need people to wake up to who they are
[1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:34.880]  and what they were and who they'll be
[1:32:34.880 --> 1:32:36.880]  and just say I am this thing
[1:32:36.880 --> 1:32:38.880]  I do not bow to your evil
[1:32:38.880 --> 1:32:40.880]  I do not submit to you
[1:32:40.880 --> 1:32:42.880]  you're going to hit that point where
[1:32:42.880 --> 1:32:44.880]  well I don't want to be
[1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:46.880]  I don't want to be arrogant
[1:32:46.880 --> 1:32:48.880]  you're not doing it for arrogance
[1:32:48.880 --> 1:32:50.880]  you're not doing it for narcissism
[1:32:50.880 --> 1:32:52.880]  you're not doing it to be a big wheel
[1:32:52.880 --> 1:32:54.880]  you're doing it because you're under attack
[1:32:54.880 --> 1:32:56.880]  and you have to be a leader
[1:32:56.880 --> 1:32:58.880]  and that doesn't matter how small the leadership is
[1:32:58.880 --> 1:33:00.880]  or how big the leadership is
[1:33:00.880 --> 1:33:02.880]  just get on the path to being yourself
[1:33:02.880 --> 1:33:04.880]  and what God told you to do
[1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:06.880]  instead of being led by the devil
[1:33:06.880 --> 1:33:08.880]  so it's very simple
[1:33:08.880 --> 1:33:10.880]  we have products you need
[1:33:10.880 --> 1:33:12.880]  that are amazing and game changing
[1:33:12.880 --> 1:33:14.880]  and I'm mad at myself all the time that I forget to take them
[1:33:14.880 --> 1:33:16.880]  because I was never a supplement person
[1:33:16.880 --> 1:33:18.880]  I was never a vitamin person
[1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:20.880]  I was never a mineral person
[1:33:20.880 --> 1:33:22.880]  I was the guy that ran 6 miles almost every day
[1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:24.880]  and lifted weights and would go to the Chinese buffet
[1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:26.880]  and eat 14 plates of food
[1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:28.880]  well not 14
[1:33:28.880 --> 1:33:30.880]  but like 8 plates of food
[1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:32.880]  but as I got older
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:34.880]  and didn't have that energy
[1:33:34.880 --> 1:33:36.880]  I learned what got me going
[1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:38.880]  and what boosted me
[1:33:38.880 --> 1:33:40.880]  and when I habituate
[1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:42.880]  doing it my life's better taking the X2
[1:33:42.880 --> 1:33:44.880]  taking the DNA Force Plus
[1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:46.880]  taking them
[1:33:46.880 --> 1:33:48.880]  nobody bought it so we discontinued it
[1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:50.880]  but my God, gut fusion is incredible
[1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:52.880]  what it did for my life, my energy
[1:33:52.880 --> 1:33:54.880]  I was 15 years old again when it came to the sex department
[1:33:54.880 --> 1:33:56.880]  because it just creates those amino acids in your guts
[1:33:56.880 --> 1:33:58.880]  there's only certain things
[1:33:58.880 --> 1:34:00.880]  you can only be made in your intestines folks
[1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:02.880]  that's why you need the
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:04.880]  we have something that does some similar things
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:06.880]  you don't have it
[1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:08.880]  sometimes the best stuff, people don't order it
[1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:10.880]  so it just goes away
[1:34:10.880 --> 1:34:12.880]  and that of course
[1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:14.880]  is something
[1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:16.880]  people should take advantage of
[1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:18.880]  and really take action on
[1:34:18.880 --> 1:34:20.880]  but we have a lot of big specials going in
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:22.880]  inforwarstore.com
[1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:24.880]  they had sold out of the black, blocket pockets
[1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:26.880]  more get in next week
[1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:28.880]  they finally made more that way

[1:34:44.880 --> 1:34:46.880]  back in stock, plus free shipping
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:48.880]  1995, that's an incredible formula
[1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:50.880]  very close to what it cost us to produce it
[1:34:50.880 --> 1:34:52.880]  and advertise it and get it out
[1:34:52.880 --> 1:34:54.880]  we have a lot of other big specials going as well
[1:34:54.880 --> 1:34:56.880]  and I just didn't plug them properly, some of us not going to plug them
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:58.880]  but
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:00.880]  we have the everyday essential specials
[1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:02.880]  what happens is
[1:35:02.880 --> 1:35:04.880]  I go crazy when I can't remember a product name
[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:06.880]  because I'm teleprompter free
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:08.880]  I've got an OCD about it, I used to have a photographic memory
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:10.880]  but now I'm older so I don't
[1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:12.880]  and so I'm sitting there
[1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:14.880]  trying to remember the name
[1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:16.880]  of our anti-parasite
[1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:18.880]  gut flush product that's beyond a probiotic
[1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:20.880]  and it drives me insane
[1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:22.880]  not supposed to know the name of it
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:24.880]  what is that
[1:35:24.880 --> 1:35:26.880]  it's not an 8-pack power stack
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:28.880]  it's not survival shield, it's not an official
[1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:30.880]  survival shield, it's not prostagard
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:32.880]  it's not krill oil, it's not a lexapyr breeze
[1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:34.880]  for I'd say
[1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:36.880]  what is the name of that product
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:38.880]  what, sure, no, no, don't tell me, see how this is
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:40.880]  I'm not mad, no one can tell me
[1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:42.880]  no one can tell me
[1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:44.880]  I won't be able to rest till I know
[1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:46.880]  the name of this product
[1:35:46.880 --> 1:35:48.880]  good God
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:52.880]  it was a sleeper product
[1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:54.880]  it wasn't popular at first

[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:08.880]  without warning
[1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:12.760]  When you run for cover, we're not running for cover.
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:15.740]  Escape is not our plan.
[1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:18.160]  You can't retreat.
[1:41:20.440 --> 1:41:25.440]  I spy, the people spy, God spies, like no other.
[1:41:26.360 --> 1:41:29.760]  The real intent, we see you, Satanist.
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:31.360]  All right, let's get into it right now.
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:37.620]  We can run forever.
[1:41:37.620 --> 1:41:40.820]  The enemy doesn't have that, they can't run forever.
[1:41:40.820 --> 1:41:43.420]  They have their little productions, their little fake events,
[1:41:43.420 --> 1:41:45.820]  their little pfft, it's nothing.
[1:41:45.820 --> 1:41:49.220]  Not like the giant thermonuclear hydrogen reactors
[1:41:49.220 --> 1:41:52.620]  of a sun exploding, a controlled explosion,
[1:41:52.620 --> 1:41:56.620]  trillions of years of energy, nothing you can even begin
[1:41:56.620 --> 1:41:58.420]  to deal with Satanists.
[1:41:58.420 --> 1:42:01.620]  So you murder children all day long, you're gonna pay.
[1:42:02.620 --> 1:42:04.620]  All right, let's get into it right now.
[1:42:04.620 --> 1:42:09.620]  Now, how their heartbeat runs when they run for cover.
[1:42:10.900 --> 1:42:15.100]  Look at this, look at this filthy, disgusting behavior.
[1:42:15.100 --> 1:42:18.780]  American Airlines is dropping service to 15 cities.
[1:42:18.780 --> 1:42:21.980]  This is likely only the beginning, CNN,
[1:42:21.980 --> 1:42:25.060]  the breakdown of general services.
[1:42:25.060 --> 1:42:28.540]  It took hundreds of years of renaissance to build up
[1:42:28.540 --> 1:42:31.780]  to this incredible opulence and human freedom you have
[1:42:31.780 --> 1:42:34.700]  with automobiles and science and medical and technology
[1:42:34.700 --> 1:42:38.340]  and eyeglasses and contact lenses and microchips.
[1:42:39.340 --> 1:42:42.260]  And the very groups hijacked it all,
[1:42:42.260 --> 1:42:45.140]  now telling you world government will deliver you everything
[1:42:45.140 --> 1:42:47.020]  when it's designed to take it all away
[1:42:47.020 --> 1:42:50.500]  because they don't want you to be empowered.
[1:42:52.340 --> 1:42:55.020]  Here's another one, play the slip of the moment,
[1:42:55.020 --> 1:42:58.340]  entrepreneur, New York City is dead and not coming back.
[1:42:58.340 --> 1:43:01.620]  That's the plan, they have to now unleash the hordes.
[1:43:01.620 --> 1:43:03.300]  Like a university they brainwashed,
[1:43:03.300 --> 1:43:05.500]  a city they brainwashed, those fleeing,
[1:43:05.500 --> 1:43:07.540]  the rats leaving don't know why they fled.
[1:43:07.540 --> 1:43:11.180]  They carry the bubonic plague, the lice,
[1:43:11.180 --> 1:43:15.540]  the spiritual fleas that carry the plague.
[1:43:15.540 --> 1:43:20.540]  They're only the vectors, the harbingers.
[1:43:20.900 --> 1:43:24.540]  They're only the angels that deliver the venom.
[1:43:26.140 --> 1:43:29.740]  As if the fangs go into your thigh from a king cobra,
[1:43:29.740 --> 1:43:33.220]  they are not the venom, they are the delivery system.
[1:43:35.100 --> 1:43:37.380]  And you say to yourself, oh, it's so horrible,
[1:43:37.380 --> 1:43:39.060]  they destroy everything.
[1:43:39.060 --> 1:43:42.740]  And they go, yes, we do, because they come to destroy you.
[1:43:44.180 --> 1:43:46.060]  You say, please don't destroy me.
[1:43:46.060 --> 1:43:48.860]  I remember one time I was at like a 2000 and,
[1:43:48.860 --> 1:43:53.220]  no, in 1996, they had a big smart growth conference
[1:43:53.220 --> 1:43:55.020]  in Austin and I was there for days,
[1:43:55.020 --> 1:43:57.300]  I paid to go and they had all these big tech people.
[1:43:57.300 --> 1:43:59.460]  And I'm like, but they're taking poor people's ranches
[1:43:59.460 --> 1:44:01.460]  and farms and you're abusing people
[1:44:01.460 --> 1:44:04.380]  and this is illegal and why would you want to hurt people?
[1:44:04.380 --> 1:44:05.300]  And I remember they looked at me
[1:44:05.300 --> 1:44:07.300]  and the camera wasn't on, they go, you idiot,
[1:44:07.300 --> 1:44:08.540]  of course we are.
[1:44:08.540 --> 1:44:12.900]  Ha ha ha ha, there was a famous Dallas Cowboy did that
[1:44:12.900 --> 1:44:15.340]  and he was just all satanic and into himself
[1:44:15.340 --> 1:44:18.180]  and he just brushed aside me, white guy.
[1:44:19.260 --> 1:44:24.260]  Like he was just, ha ha, of course he are, ha ha ha ha.
[1:44:24.260 --> 1:44:29.260]  That's the attitude, you're like, hey, what's your deal?
[1:44:32.100 --> 1:44:33.540]  What you're doing is illegal, it's stealing
[1:44:33.540 --> 1:44:37.340]  and of course it is, you idiot, get out of my way.
[1:44:39.340 --> 1:44:44.100]  And that is surety of the satanist, that arrogance,
[1:44:44.100 --> 1:44:47.220]  them, them, them, only them, not aggressive,
[1:44:47.220 --> 1:44:50.100]  not dominant, not alpha standing up to yourself,
[1:44:50.100 --> 1:44:51.540]  but also building something good,
[1:44:51.540 --> 1:44:54.540]  but just wanting to screw people, loving it,
[1:44:54.540 --> 1:44:57.140]  anyone that deserves it, gets it
[1:44:57.140 --> 1:44:59.300]  and deserving it just means you can do it.
[1:45:02.220 --> 1:45:04.540]  Deserving just means they can get away with it.
[1:45:07.420 --> 1:45:09.940]  And imagine that's the allegory of,
[1:45:09.940 --> 1:45:11.140]  you get the public pool and go,
[1:45:11.140 --> 1:45:12.940]  well, I could just take a dump in here.
[1:45:14.220 --> 1:45:15.620]  By the time they figure it out, I'll get out.
[1:45:15.620 --> 1:45:17.180]  Yeah, I think I'm gonna go home now.
[1:45:17.180 --> 1:45:18.620]  I'm not gonna use this pool for a couple of weeks,
[1:45:18.620 --> 1:45:20.820]  just take a dump in the pool.
[1:45:20.820 --> 1:45:22.540]  That's satanism.
[1:45:22.540 --> 1:45:25.300]  Satanism equals taking a dump in the public pool.
[1:45:26.500 --> 1:45:28.620]  I mean, they're not just pissing in the public pool, folks.
[1:45:28.620 --> 1:45:31.540]  They're taking a dump in the public pool and they like it.
[1:45:33.260 --> 1:45:34.740]  Cause they like getting in their car
[1:45:34.740 --> 1:45:37.860]  and watch everybody freak out as they drive away.
[1:45:37.860 --> 1:45:39.740]  That's their little treat.
[1:45:39.740 --> 1:45:40.940]  But see, when they do that enough,
[1:45:40.940 --> 1:45:43.700]  there's no public pools anymore for them to even go to,
[1:45:43.700 --> 1:45:46.140]  because enough people start doing it,
[1:45:46.140 --> 1:45:48.860]  it becomes a toilet and then it closes
[1:45:48.860 --> 1:45:49.820]  and that's their answer.
[1:45:49.820 --> 1:45:52.300]  Oh yeah, we're closing the whole human system.
[1:45:52.300 --> 1:45:54.220]  It's all gone.
[1:45:54.220 --> 1:45:55.060]  So here's the headline,
[1:45:55.060 --> 1:45:56.740]  and I'll play this clip before I get back to the news.
[1:45:56.740 --> 1:46:00.540]  Biden vows to guide US out of darkness.
[1:46:00.540 --> 1:46:01.980]  Who created the race riots?
[1:46:01.980 --> 1:46:06.020]  Who created the lockdowns and the rolling power outages
[1:46:06.020 --> 1:46:07.100]  and the depression?
[1:46:07.100 --> 1:46:07.940]  Who did it all?
[1:46:07.940 --> 1:46:08.780]  Them.
[1:46:09.940 --> 1:46:10.940]  But big Mike.
[1:46:13.340 --> 1:46:14.980]  Michael Obama.
[1:46:14.980 --> 1:46:16.420]  I'm sorry, Michelle Obama.
[1:46:16.420 --> 1:46:20.500]  He says, oh, you think things are bad?
[1:46:20.500 --> 1:46:23.020]  They're a lot worse unless you give in to us.
[1:46:23.020 --> 1:46:23.860]  Here she is.
[1:46:25.940 --> 1:46:30.900]  So if you take one thing from my words tonight, it is this.
[1:46:30.900 --> 1:46:34.460]  If you think things cannot possibly get worse,
[1:46:34.460 --> 1:46:37.460]  trust me, they can and they will.
[1:46:37.460 --> 1:46:41.100]  If we don't make a change in this election,
[1:46:41.100 --> 1:46:44.300]  if we have any hope of ending this chaos,
[1:46:44.300 --> 1:46:46.820]  we have got to vote for Joe Biden
[1:46:46.820 --> 1:46:49.340]  like our lives depend on it.
[1:46:50.660 --> 1:46:52.740]  Because the Pito rings are going down,
[1:46:52.740 --> 1:46:54.100]  their foundation's going down,
[1:46:54.100 --> 1:46:56.660]  their sell out to Islam and communist China's going down.
[1:46:56.660 --> 1:46:58.420]  So their lives do depend on it.
[1:46:59.620 --> 1:47:01.180]  But let's keep going through these headlines.
[1:47:01.180 --> 1:47:02.700]  American Airlines is dropping
[1:47:02.700 --> 1:47:05.060]  service to at least 15 cities CNN celebrates.
[1:47:05.060 --> 1:47:06.340]  They say probably for good,
[1:47:06.340 --> 1:47:09.100]  entrepreneur New York City is dead and not coming back.
[1:47:10.460 --> 1:47:12.620]  Joe Biden vows national mass mandate
[1:47:12.620 --> 1:47:15.060]  in elected president have total cult.
[1:47:16.460 --> 1:47:18.540]  Because they can get people to bully you to do one order.
[1:47:18.540 --> 1:47:19.940]  They'll bully you to the next order.
[1:47:19.940 --> 1:47:21.540]  You're trying to get the mob going.
[1:47:21.540 --> 1:47:24.300]  I have a right to make sure that my home is secure.
[1:47:24.300 --> 1:47:27.460]  Chicago Mayor Lightfoot defends ban on protests
[1:47:29.020 --> 1:47:32.620]  and defunding the police and banning guns for citizens.
[1:47:32.620 --> 1:47:34.780]  But says she is important.
[1:47:34.780 --> 1:47:36.420]  You're like, well, that sounds oxymoronic.
[1:47:36.420 --> 1:47:39.340]  No, it's about her teaching you, you have no hope.
[1:47:39.340 --> 1:47:40.820]  She goes, I'm important.
[1:47:40.820 --> 1:47:42.420]  I get to have my haircut.
[1:47:42.420 --> 1:47:44.620]  Remember a few months ago, but you don't.
[1:47:44.620 --> 1:47:45.660]  You're like, that's discrediting.
[1:47:45.660 --> 1:47:46.500]  No, no, no, no.
[1:47:46.500 --> 1:47:47.540]  When you reach this point,
[1:47:47.540 --> 1:47:49.700]  it's like Shilchescu and Romanium saying,
[1:47:49.700 --> 1:47:51.580]  I get power at my palace.
[1:47:51.580 --> 1:47:53.740]  We have electricity.
[1:47:53.740 --> 1:47:55.780]  But the rest of you don't get electricity.
[1:47:58.900 --> 1:48:00.780]  Don't piss down my back and tell me it's raining.
[1:48:00.780 --> 1:48:02.620]  But that's what they do, folks.
[1:48:02.620 --> 1:48:03.820]  It's a cult.
[1:48:07.500 --> 1:48:10.140]  Call of duty features Soviet defector
[1:48:10.140 --> 1:48:12.580]  and new trailer exposing the new world to takeover.
[1:48:12.580 --> 1:48:15.940]  Flashback features 10-year-old trans kid
[1:48:15.940 --> 1:48:18.540]  as a top and explicitly sexual terms
[1:48:18.540 --> 1:48:20.300]  as they're led into a sex dungeon
[1:48:20.300 --> 1:48:23.140]  by a goblin creature dressed as a woman.
[1:48:25.860 --> 1:48:30.860]  I mean, it's just out in the open.
[1:48:31.620 --> 1:48:32.860]  Savannah Hernandez went out and asked
[1:48:32.860 --> 1:48:33.700]  how long we were in mass.
[1:48:33.700 --> 1:48:36.500]  He said, however long it says I'm a hero.
[1:48:36.500 --> 1:48:37.500]  Cause they don't have a life.
[1:48:37.500 --> 1:48:38.580]  They don't have a future.
[1:48:38.580 --> 1:48:39.580]  They don't have an identity.
[1:48:39.580 --> 1:48:41.980]  The media said, where this year a hero doesn't matter.
[1:48:41.980 --> 1:48:42.820]  It's all a fraud.
[1:48:42.820 --> 1:48:44.420]  They're a hero, you're not.
[1:48:47.580 --> 1:48:49.500]  They're a hero, you're not.
[1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:55.500]  And I've got all these other articles
[1:48:55.500 --> 1:49:00.100]  that are here in my stack that deal with all this.
[1:49:00.100 --> 1:49:00.940]  And I'll be honest with you,
[1:49:00.940 --> 1:49:02.980]  I thought that was my COVID stack.
[1:49:02.980 --> 1:49:04.420]  It's not even my COVID stack.
[1:49:04.420 --> 1:49:05.260]  It's not a COVID stack.
[1:49:05.260 --> 1:49:07.300]  That was like a stack that had some COVID in it.
[1:49:07.300 --> 1:49:10.340]  It's the most insane garbage you've ever seen.
[1:49:10.340 --> 1:49:13.260]  And I'm gonna find, oh, here's the COVID stack, excuse me.
[1:49:13.260 --> 1:49:15.700]  Now I have the COVID stack, excuse me.
[1:49:15.700 --> 1:49:17.100]  We're gonna come back and hit that COVID stack.
[1:49:17.100 --> 1:49:20.020]  Let me have a guest here in studio separately.
[1:49:20.020 --> 1:49:23.420]  I was having one of those little nervous fits earlier.
[1:49:23.420 --> 1:49:25.500]  Cause I couldn't remember the name of that product.
[1:49:25.500 --> 1:49:28.060]  It's got free shipping on it and it's still 50% off.
[1:49:28.060 --> 1:49:31.460]  Living Defense, this is beyond a probiotic.
[1:49:31.460 --> 1:49:33.220]  It's got all these things known to flush out
[1:49:33.220 --> 1:49:35.460]  the bad little visitors in the guts
[1:49:35.460 --> 1:49:38.140]  and really get your guts up to optimum condition.
[1:49:38.140 --> 1:49:39.940]  And if you've ever thought probiotics were amazing
[1:49:39.940 --> 1:49:41.860]  what they are, this is next level
[1:49:41.860 --> 1:49:43.740]  and does it a different way.
[1:49:43.740 --> 1:49:45.420]  It targets and gets rid of bad guys.
[1:49:45.420 --> 1:49:47.300]  It doesn't promote the good guys.
[1:49:47.300 --> 1:49:48.780]  Cause when you get rid of the bad guys,
[1:49:48.780 --> 1:49:50.860]  the good guys can operate.
[1:49:50.860 --> 1:49:52.260]  The new owner is targeting your gut.
[1:49:52.260 --> 1:49:54.740]  Living Defense is the best, most powerful formula.
[1:49:54.740 --> 1:49:55.940]  And it is a big bottle.
[1:49:55.940 --> 1:49:57.500]  Let me show TV viewers this.
[1:49:57.500 --> 1:49:58.700]  It's a brand new bottle.
[1:50:00.060 --> 1:50:01.940]  I remember I haven't taken this about six months.
[1:50:01.940 --> 1:50:03.980]  I take it about twice a year.
[1:50:03.980 --> 1:50:07.340]  Look at this, will you overhead shot for me?
[1:50:07.340 --> 1:50:10.580]  Look at that, look at this.
[1:50:10.580 --> 1:50:12.460]  Damn, they're going on the floor everywhere.
[1:50:12.460 --> 1:50:14.580]  There's so many of them, hold on.
[1:50:14.580 --> 1:50:17.460]  There you go, I mean, what's on the floor?
[1:50:17.460 --> 1:50:18.580]  These babies are amazing.
[1:50:18.580 --> 1:50:21.300]  You take a few of these a day for a month.
[1:50:21.300 --> 1:50:23.860]  You're gonna have some results that are,
[1:50:23.860 --> 1:50:25.500]  let's just say, magnificent.
[1:50:26.380 --> 1:50:29.060]  And this is Mother Nature gave us,
[1:50:29.060 --> 1:50:30.700]  God gave us a Mother Nature.
[1:50:30.700 --> 1:50:32.900]  It is Living Defense, infowarstore.com
[1:50:32.900 --> 1:50:34.260]  and you find the infowar.
[1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:36.860]  So it's a total win, win, win, win, win,
[1:50:36.860 --> 1:50:38.180]  infowarstore.com.
[1:50:41.100 --> 1:50:44.180]  How do you contest an election in the year 2020?
[1:50:44.180 --> 1:50:47.420]  Well, you trigger race riots
[1:50:47.420 --> 1:50:50.020]  and you tell the blue states and blue cities
[1:50:50.020 --> 1:50:51.540]  when you're the speaker of the house
[1:50:51.540 --> 1:50:53.820]  that you are legitimately now the president.
[1:50:53.820 --> 1:50:56.340]  That's what she's said on CBS News.
[1:50:56.340 --> 1:50:59.540]  And then you're going to have those blue states secede.
[1:50:59.540 --> 1:51:02.380]  Yes, that's officially called a civil war,
[1:51:02.380 --> 1:51:03.380]  ladies and gentlemen.
[1:51:03.380 --> 1:51:04.980]  And the Democrats are backed by the EU,
[1:51:04.980 --> 1:51:07.780]  Hollywood, the chai comms and the whole globalist system.
[1:51:07.780 --> 1:51:10.300]  This is treason with a capital T
[1:51:10.300 --> 1:51:13.060]  and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards,
[1:51:13.060 --> 1:51:15.820]  they won't even stand up against it and do anything
[1:51:15.820 --> 1:51:17.980]  even though our president has been exposing it.
[1:51:17.980 --> 1:51:19.300]  But here's the bottom line.
[1:51:19.300 --> 1:51:21.540]  You need storeable food, we've got the best quality
[1:51:21.540 --> 1:51:24.380]  ready to ship to you right now, two to four week delivery
[1:51:24.380 --> 1:51:25.780]  with 80 days out from the election.
[1:51:25.780 --> 1:51:28.060]  You need to get high quality storeable food right now
[1:51:28.060 --> 1:51:30.100]  in case they are able to pull this off.
[1:51:30.100 --> 1:51:32.260]  We're gonna have a great depression war on the streets
[1:51:32.260 --> 1:51:34.180]  and we'll make a road warrior look like a cake walk.
[1:51:34.180 --> 1:51:35.780]  Get your high quality storeable foods now
[1:51:35.780 --> 1:51:38.900]  and get ready and get prepared at infowarstore.com.
[1:51:38.900 --> 1:51:39.820]  Get prepared.
[1:51:41.060 --> 1:51:44.300]  The social engineers bet on you not having a memory
[1:51:44.300 --> 1:51:45.220]  more than anything.
[1:51:45.220 --> 1:51:47.660]  They also bet, as they constantly talk about it
[1:51:47.660 --> 1:51:50.820]  in their own words, that you will adapt to being a slave,
[1:51:50.820 --> 1:51:53.740]  that you will learn incrementally to submit.
[1:51:53.740 --> 1:51:57.380]  So think about and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud.
[1:51:57.380 --> 1:51:59.220]  Remember that everything he said
[1:51:59.220 --> 1:52:00.980]  has been a premeditated lie.
[1:52:00.980 --> 1:52:02.820]  They lied about where it came from.
[1:52:02.820 --> 1:52:06.220]  They lied about person to person, the UN covered it all up,
[1:52:06.220 --> 1:52:08.820]  then exaggerated the death rate at 4%
[1:52:08.820 --> 1:52:13.820]  when it's actually 0.032 now and dropping.
[1:52:14.140 --> 1:52:15.180]  Then they set the test up
[1:52:15.180 --> 1:52:17.260]  to count almost all false positives.
[1:52:17.260 --> 1:52:19.740]  They put the names of people that died of other diseases
[1:52:19.740 --> 1:52:21.180]  in the COVID column.
[1:52:21.180 --> 1:52:23.100]  They only said there'd be a 15 day lockdown.
[1:52:23.100 --> 1:52:24.580]  Now we're six months later.
[1:52:24.580 --> 1:52:26.140]  Now they say it's permanent.
[1:52:26.140 --> 1:52:27.420]  You gotta wear masks forever
[1:52:27.420 --> 1:52:28.980]  and forced inoculations are coming
[1:52:28.980 --> 1:52:30.300]  and they're gonna track everywhere you go
[1:52:30.300 --> 1:52:32.540]  what you do the global social credit score
[1:52:32.540 --> 1:52:34.940]  and the UN is the boss and anybody questioning it
[1:52:34.940 --> 1:52:37.220]  is censored off the internet loses their job.
[1:52:37.220 --> 1:52:38.900]  That's called 21st century tyranny.
[1:52:38.900 --> 1:52:40.900]  That's called world government takeover.
[1:52:44.100 --> 1:52:47.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:52:50.540 --> 1:52:54.100]  From the front lines of the information war,
[1:52:54.100 --> 1:52:56.020]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:52:56.020 --> 1:53:01.020]  It's Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones.
[1:53:03.180 --> 1:53:04.020]  Good evening.
[1:53:05.020 --> 1:53:09.140]  Ella Baker, a giant of the civil rights movement
[1:53:09.140 --> 1:53:10.620]  left us with this wisdom.
[1:53:11.460 --> 1:53:15.900]  Give people light and they will find the way.
[1:53:15.900 --> 1:53:17.220]  Give people light.
[1:53:18.380 --> 1:53:20.220]  Those are words for our time.
[1:53:21.300 --> 1:53:24.260]  The current president has cloaked American darkness
[1:53:24.260 --> 1:53:29.260]  for much too long, too much anger, too much fear,
[1:53:29.380 --> 1:53:31.340]  too much division.
[1:53:31.340 --> 1:53:34.780]  Here and now I give you my word.
[1:53:34.780 --> 1:53:37.340]  If you entrust me with the presidency,
[1:53:37.340 --> 1:53:41.020]  I will draw on the best of us, not the worst.
[1:53:41.020 --> 1:53:45.140]  I'll be an ally of the light, not the darkness.
[1:53:45.140 --> 1:53:49.460]  It's time for us for we the people to come together
[1:53:50.380 --> 1:53:52.180]  and make no mistake.
[1:53:52.180 --> 1:53:55.780]  United we can and will overcome
[1:53:55.780 --> 1:53:58.820]  this season of darkness in America.
[1:53:58.820 --> 1:54:02.420]  We'll choose hope over fear, facts over fiction,
[1:54:02.420 --> 1:54:04.180]  fairness over privilege.
[1:54:05.300 --> 1:54:09.060]  I'm a proud Democrat and I'll be proud to carry
[1:54:09.060 --> 1:54:12.460]  the banner of our party into the general election.
[1:54:12.460 --> 1:54:15.260]  So it's a great honor and humility.
[1:54:15.260 --> 1:54:18.380]  I accept this nomination for president
[1:54:18.380 --> 1:54:20.100]  of the United States of America.
[1:54:20.100 --> 1:54:22.220]  But while I'll be a Democratic.
[1:54:22.220 --> 1:54:24.500]  He had to fully focus for that 30 seconds
[1:54:24.500 --> 1:54:25.340]  to be able to say that.
[1:54:25.340 --> 1:54:28.940]  You can hear him really laboring, having big, big problems.
[1:54:28.940 --> 1:54:30.740]  I want to get into the real economic war
[1:54:30.740 --> 1:54:33.340]  and the real economic collapse coming up next segment
[1:54:33.340 --> 1:54:36.100]  because admitting it's happening will stop it.
[1:54:36.100 --> 1:54:39.500]  And the people who engineered it will end up paying
[1:54:39.500 --> 1:54:41.500]  for what they've done so they won't use it
[1:54:41.500 --> 1:54:43.740]  to get more control and more power over us.
[1:54:43.740 --> 1:54:46.260]  That's coming up next segment.
[1:54:46.260 --> 1:54:49.260]  But first, let me bring up something here
[1:54:49.260 --> 1:54:50.260]  that I owe the listeners.
[1:54:52.260 --> 1:54:56.260]  I didn't tell Millie Weaver yesterday
[1:54:56.260 --> 1:54:58.260]  that I was no longer gonna work with her
[1:54:58.260 --> 1:54:59.260]  after working with her for eight years
[1:54:59.260 --> 1:55:01.260]  because of the film Shadowgate.
[1:55:02.260 --> 1:55:04.260]  It was when the Shadowgate film got released,
[1:55:04.260 --> 1:55:06.260]  I didn't know what was in it.
[1:55:06.260 --> 1:55:08.260]  And then someone they sent over here to the office
[1:55:08.260 --> 1:55:11.260]  was saying things that I knew were patently not true.
[1:55:11.260 --> 1:55:13.260]  And when we brought up the things weren't true,
[1:55:13.260 --> 1:55:14.260]  what they said on air,
[1:55:14.260 --> 1:55:16.260]  about Roger Stone working with General Jones
[1:55:16.260 --> 1:55:19.260]  and all this stuff, I tried to respond to them
[1:55:19.260 --> 1:55:21.260]  and they just acted like I was crazy.
[1:55:21.260 --> 1:55:23.260]  So then I saw the internet researching
[1:55:23.260 --> 1:55:25.260]  the people they're involved in
[1:55:25.260 --> 1:55:30.260]  and I was so blown away by it that I was like,
[1:55:30.260 --> 1:55:34.260]  this is so bad that if I talk about this,
[1:55:34.260 --> 1:55:36.260]  the media is gonna attack me for it.
[1:55:36.260 --> 1:55:39.260]  But if I don't talk about it, I'm covering something up
[1:55:39.260 --> 1:55:41.260]  and so I'm gonna talk about it.
[1:55:41.260 --> 1:55:43.260]  That's how I work.
[1:55:43.260 --> 1:55:45.260]  I don't know what Millie's into.
[1:55:45.260 --> 1:55:47.260]  I want to think she's a good person,
[1:55:47.260 --> 1:55:52.260]  but the people she's involved with are some serious people.
[1:55:52.260 --> 1:55:54.260]  I'll leave it at that.
[1:55:54.260 --> 1:55:57.260]  They've been like sending us punisher images on Twitter
[1:55:57.260 --> 1:55:59.260]  like that threatens us like people threaten us,
[1:55:59.260 --> 1:56:01.260]  we get scared or whatever you want the punisher does.
[1:56:01.260 --> 1:56:02.260]  Okay, great.
[1:56:02.260 --> 1:56:04.260]  So I'll probably go further now because of that,
[1:56:04.260 --> 1:56:07.260]  because you did that, that's a rule I have.
[1:56:07.260 --> 1:56:09.260]  But if you go to Band-Aught Video,
[1:56:09.260 --> 1:56:11.260]  I'm not gonna cover this ever again,
[1:56:11.260 --> 1:56:13.260]  I'm not gonna respond to it.
[1:56:13.260 --> 1:56:15.260]  The full Shadowgate film now has a write-up
[1:56:15.260 --> 1:56:17.260]  that I wrote this morning,
[1:56:17.260 --> 1:56:21.260]  and then links to what Caitlin Bennett put out
[1:56:21.260 --> 1:56:24.260]  separately from our own research that we found
[1:56:24.260 --> 1:56:27.260]  and best of our own belief is accurate
[1:56:27.260 --> 1:56:29.260]  about the people that are involved.
[1:56:29.260 --> 1:56:35.260]  So we're not decoupling because of her getting arrested
[1:56:35.260 --> 1:56:38.260]  for reportedly a scuff-up and a broken phone with her mom.
[1:56:38.260 --> 1:56:41.260]  And it's not because of the film Shadowgate,
[1:56:41.260 --> 1:56:44.260]  it's because once the film came out,
[1:56:44.260 --> 1:56:46.260]  people are like, do you know who these people are?
[1:56:46.260 --> 1:56:49.260]  And then separately they were attacking us at the same time.
[1:56:49.260 --> 1:56:52.260]  So I went and looked and I had it checked by experts
[1:56:52.260 --> 1:56:54.260]  and it was just like, are you kidding me?
[1:56:54.260 --> 1:56:57.260]  But this is what attaches itself to Q,
[1:56:57.260 --> 1:56:59.260]  this is what attaches itself to anybody that's successful,
[1:56:59.260 --> 1:57:02.260]  Millie is successful, she did well,
[1:57:02.260 --> 1:57:04.260]  we gave her total freedom and I'm done.
[1:57:04.260 --> 1:57:07.260]  In fact, on Monday I'm gonna take the Shadowgate film down
[1:57:07.260 --> 1:57:10.260]  and her channel because it's my site, it's my operation
[1:57:10.260 --> 1:57:13.260]  and I choose to not be associated with it.
[1:57:13.260 --> 1:57:14.260]  And not even because of the film,
[1:57:14.260 --> 1:57:15.260]  I just saw them making statements about,
[1:57:15.260 --> 1:57:17.260]  oh, he didn't fund our film, it's our film.
[1:57:17.260 --> 1:57:19.260]  So they're acting like they don't want it there,
[1:57:19.260 --> 1:57:21.260]  you got it, it'll be off the site Monday.
[1:57:21.260 --> 1:57:23.260]  People that want it can go see it, you can download it.
[1:57:23.260 --> 1:57:24.260]  If they ask me today to take it down,
[1:57:24.260 --> 1:57:25.260]  I'll take it down right now too.
[1:57:25.260 --> 1:57:26.260]  So I'm done.
[1:57:26.260 --> 1:57:28.260]  I'll never talk about Millie Weaver again.
[1:57:28.260 --> 1:57:30.260]  And I'm just saying, I don't believe a word comes out
[1:57:30.260 --> 1:57:32.260]  of any other mouths and that's it.
[1:57:32.260 --> 1:57:36.260]  I mean, you couldn't write the script for this stuff.
[1:57:36.260 --> 1:57:38.260]  And I'm just, all I have is the truth.
[1:57:38.260 --> 1:57:39.260]  So I've done it here.
[1:57:39.260 --> 1:57:40.260]  So bon voyage, Millie.
[1:57:40.260 --> 1:57:42.260]  Have fun with those folks you're working with.
[1:57:42.260 --> 1:58:08.260]  This little treat is real good.
[1:58:08.260 --> 1:58:12.260]  Right here in Austin, Texas.
[1:58:12.260 --> 1:58:15.260]  And this time, we'll have food.
[1:58:15.260 --> 1:58:18.260]  That's right, we're bringing food.
[1:58:18.260 --> 1:58:20.260]  I'm going to pay for a professional food truck.
[1:58:20.260 --> 1:58:23.260]  Yes!
[1:58:23.260 --> 1:58:27.260]  Come out and show your resistance to the ridiculous orders
[1:58:27.260 --> 1:58:30.260]  against enjoying the beautiful green belt.
[1:58:30.260 --> 1:58:34.260]  Swimming with Alex Jones this Saturday
[1:58:34.260 --> 1:58:37.260]  at 12 noon at Barton Springs.
[1:58:37.260 --> 1:58:38.260]  We'll see you there.
[1:58:38.260 --> 1:58:40.260]  We've shot a Barton Springs.
[1:58:40.260 --> 1:59:08.260]  We're going to see everybody out there.
[1:59:08.260 --> 1:59:12.260]  They want employees to be remote for maybe years
[1:59:12.260 --> 1:59:14.260]  or permanently.
[1:59:14.260 --> 1:59:18.260]  This completely damages not only the economic ecosystem
[1:59:18.260 --> 1:59:22.260]  of New York City, the restaurants, transportation,
[1:59:22.260 --> 1:59:24.260]  office buildings, commercial real estate,
[1:59:24.260 --> 1:59:28.260]  but what happens to the tax base when all of your workers
[1:59:28.260 --> 1:59:31.260]  can now live anywhere they want in the country,
[1:59:31.260 --> 1:59:33.260]  not even the suburbs.
[1:59:33.260 --> 1:59:36.260]  They're going to go to all of the cities like Nashville, Miami,
[1:59:36.260 --> 1:59:38.260]  Austin, Denver.
[1:59:38.260 --> 1:59:41.260]  They're leaving the city because they can work in places
[1:59:41.260 --> 1:59:44.260]  that have a cheaper cost of living, lower tax basis.
[1:59:44.260 --> 1:59:47.260]  And what happens to the tax revenues of New York
[1:59:47.260 --> 1:59:51.260]  just at the same time that deficits are soaring?
[1:59:51.260 --> 1:59:55.260]  So all of these numbers and apocalyptic statistics
[1:59:55.260 --> 1:59:58.260]  that you were just quoting, what's going to reverse that?
[1:59:58.260 --> 2:00:01.260]  It's only going to get worse.
[2:00:01.260 --> 2:00:03.260]  I think it's very sad, James.
[2:00:03.260 --> 2:00:06.260]  I mean, look, I've lived in the New York area for 40 years.
[2:00:06.260 --> 2:00:07.260]  I love this city.
[2:00:07.260 --> 2:00:09.260]  It is a truly great city.
[2:00:09.260 --> 2:00:10.260]  I've lived in London.
[2:00:10.260 --> 2:00:13.260]  I've lived in all over the world in great cities.
[2:00:13.260 --> 2:00:15.260]  And this is a great city.
[2:00:15.260 --> 2:00:19.260]  And it grieves me to hear you say it's dead forever.
[2:00:19.260 --> 2:00:21.260]  Is there no hope at all?
[2:00:21.260 --> 2:00:23.260]  It can come back a little bit, count it.
[2:00:23.260 --> 2:00:25.260]  It just won't be like it was.
[2:00:25.260 --> 2:00:27.260]  Well, look, I was born here.
[2:00:27.260 --> 2:00:30.260]  I've lived here for my whole adult life.
[2:00:30.260 --> 2:00:34.260]  And I have five kids in New York City.
[2:00:34.260 --> 2:00:37.260]  But yes, I don't think we're going to see a return
[2:00:37.260 --> 2:00:39.260]  to the old New York.
[2:00:45.260 --> 2:00:49.260]  New York City's dead and it's not coming back.
[2:00:49.260 --> 2:00:52.260]  America's dead and it's not coming back.
[2:00:54.260 --> 2:00:59.260]  Unless you totally break with the New World Order,
[2:00:59.260 --> 2:01:01.260]  then everything will make sense.
[2:01:01.260 --> 2:01:03.260]  If you just research what I've told you,
[2:01:03.260 --> 2:01:05.260]  you won't be listening to me.
[2:01:05.260 --> 2:01:09.260]  You'll be reading the Rockefeller Foundation lockstep program.
[2:01:09.260 --> 2:01:11.260]  You'll be reading Agenda 21.
[2:01:11.260 --> 2:01:14.260]  And you'll look out your window, or you'll go to work,
[2:01:14.260 --> 2:01:16.260]  or you'll drive down the street, or you'll go to the store,
[2:01:16.260 --> 2:01:19.260]  and you will see it.
[2:01:19.260 --> 2:01:24.260]  You won't be listening to Alex Jones.
[2:01:24.260 --> 2:01:26.260]  You won't be listening to some leftists tell you
[2:01:26.260 --> 2:01:28.260]  there's KKK members around every corner.
[2:01:28.260 --> 2:01:31.260]  They don't exist in most areas.
[2:01:31.260 --> 2:01:37.260]  You'll be seeing it for yourself.
[2:01:37.260 --> 2:01:39.260]  It's like somebody telling you,
[2:01:39.260 --> 2:01:42.260]  hey, they got really good hamburgers over at that place.
[2:01:42.260 --> 2:01:44.260]  And you go there and it's a delicious hamburger.
[2:01:44.260 --> 2:01:50.260]  You heard it, but you had the hamburger.
[2:01:50.260 --> 2:01:52.260]  Or it's like the doctor telling you,
[2:01:52.260 --> 2:01:54.260]  yeah, you see that scan, you got a big brain tumor.
[2:01:54.260 --> 2:01:56.260]  You'll probably be dead about three months.
[2:01:56.260 --> 2:01:58.260]  You know what, a couple months later,
[2:01:58.260 --> 2:02:01.260]  you're sitting there dying and you're like, wow, that was true.
[2:02:01.260 --> 2:02:04.260]  You know, I don't sit up here and tell you all this
[2:02:04.260 --> 2:02:06.260]  because I want to scare you,
[2:02:06.260 --> 2:02:09.260]  or because I think this is fun.
[2:02:09.260 --> 2:02:15.260]  I got into reading 37 years ago or so.
[2:02:15.260 --> 2:02:17.260]  I got into history books.
[2:02:17.260 --> 2:02:21.260]  And I was about nine years old.
[2:02:21.260 --> 2:02:23.260]  Because I love science fiction.
[2:02:23.260 --> 2:02:27.260]  I love comic books, and then I picked up history books.
[2:02:27.260 --> 2:02:31.260]  Color,
[2:02:31.260 --> 2:02:35.260]  time-life books that my dad got from me,
[2:02:35.260 --> 2:02:37.260]  and then he never bought me anything.
[2:02:37.260 --> 2:02:39.260]  I got like two pairs of shoes a year,
[2:02:39.260 --> 2:02:41.260]  and they wanted me to be frugal,
[2:02:41.260 --> 2:02:43.260]  and I had to get a job, and I was like 11.
[2:02:43.260 --> 2:02:45.260]  But man, if I wanted books, I got them for me.
[2:02:45.260 --> 2:02:49.260]  I had like 15, 20 color encyclopedias
[2:02:49.260 --> 2:02:51.260]  by the time I was about 10.
[2:02:51.260 --> 2:02:55.260]  And it was so incredible hearing about this siege
[2:02:55.260 --> 2:02:57.260]  in the Chinese or the Greeks,
[2:02:57.260 --> 2:02:59.260]  or the Russians, or the British Navy.
[2:02:59.260 --> 2:03:03.260]  I got a whole series when I was about 11 on the occult.
[2:03:03.260 --> 2:03:05.260]  Time-life books, like 10 volumes.
[2:03:05.260 --> 2:03:07.260]  And I was reading about the whole history of the occult.
[2:03:07.260 --> 2:03:09.260]  It was pretty accurate, too.
[2:03:09.260 --> 2:03:13.260]  Today, you know, to be an expert on it.
[2:03:13.260 --> 2:03:15.260]  And if you go to college
[2:03:15.260 --> 2:03:18.260]  and try to get an education on something today,
[2:03:18.260 --> 2:03:20.260]  you don't get an education on anything.
[2:03:20.260 --> 2:03:22.260]  It's all in education, how to fight with each other,
[2:03:22.260 --> 2:03:25.260]  and how different ideas are weird,
[2:03:25.260 --> 2:03:27.260]  and how you can only have this school of thought.
[2:03:27.260 --> 2:03:30.260]  You're being taught to be a slave.
[2:03:30.260 --> 2:03:33.260]  I got a classical education
[2:03:33.260 --> 2:03:40.260]  because my parents would buy me any book I wanted.
[2:03:40.260 --> 2:03:42.260]  And I told you the story
[2:03:42.260 --> 2:03:44.260]  where my mom dropped me off at the mall
[2:03:44.260 --> 2:03:47.260]  when I was like 13.
[2:03:47.260 --> 2:03:50.260]  And I walked in and went back to them. They had little bookstores.
[2:03:50.260 --> 2:03:52.260]  And I said,
[2:03:52.260 --> 2:03:55.260]  where's your history section?
[2:03:55.260 --> 2:03:56.260]  Because I couldn't find it.
[2:03:56.260 --> 2:03:58.260]  And it turned out it was in a World at War section.
[2:03:58.260 --> 2:04:00.260]  And I bought Mein Kampf,
[2:04:00.260 --> 2:04:03.260]  a big orange-covered thing with Hitler on the front.
[2:04:03.260 --> 2:04:06.260]  And I walked over to the woman
[2:04:06.260 --> 2:04:09.260]  and I handed it to her.
[2:04:09.260 --> 2:04:12.260]  It was a big paper-backed cover.
[2:04:12.260 --> 2:04:15.260]  But it was a big orange Mein Kampf, my struggle.
[2:04:15.260 --> 2:04:17.260]  And I handed it to her.
[2:04:17.260 --> 2:04:19.260]  And she got all scared. She was a white lady.
[2:04:19.260 --> 2:04:21.260]  But she goes,
[2:04:21.260 --> 2:04:25.260]  I go, what's wrong? She goes, you're not a Nazi, are you?
[2:04:25.260 --> 2:04:27.260]  And I remember, it's not wit.
[2:04:27.260 --> 2:04:30.260]  It's just that common sense of a young person that's in form.
[2:04:30.260 --> 2:04:33.260]  And I said, you're the one selling it, lady.
[2:04:33.260 --> 2:04:35.260]  What do you think?
[2:04:35.260 --> 2:04:37.260]  And then I realized I was handsome.
[2:04:37.260 --> 2:04:39.260]  I had blonde hair. I had blue eyes.
[2:04:39.260 --> 2:04:43.260]  I was wearing a white tucked-in shirt.
[2:04:43.260 --> 2:04:46.260]  I was wearing blue jeans and tennis shoes.
[2:04:46.260 --> 2:04:50.260]  And because I was a good-looking white guy buying Mein Kampf,
[2:04:50.260 --> 2:04:52.260]  you can't really blame her thinking I was a Nazi.
[2:04:52.260 --> 2:04:54.260]  But again,
[2:04:54.260 --> 2:04:59.260]  people think reading and being informed is weird.
[2:04:59.260 --> 2:05:03.260]  I mean, that book was unreadable socialist dribble.
[2:05:06.260 --> 2:05:09.260]  Bitching about the Varsize Treaty.
[2:05:09.260 --> 2:05:16.260]  And it was designed to get the German aristocracy of the day
[2:05:16.260 --> 2:05:18.260]  to get in bed with Hitler.
[2:05:18.260 --> 2:05:20.260]  And it worked.
[2:05:20.260 --> 2:05:22.260]  But it was not a good book.
[2:05:24.260 --> 2:05:27.260]  And again, once you've read Hitler,
[2:05:27.260 --> 2:05:34.260]  you want to read Marx and Engels and Julius Caesar and Sun Tzu
[2:05:34.260 --> 2:05:36.260]  and everybody else.
[2:05:36.260 --> 2:05:42.260]  But you know, I haven't read a book on geopolitics in years.
[2:05:42.260 --> 2:05:45.260]  I read hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[2:05:45.260 --> 2:05:47.260]  And I, hundreds and hundreds a year,
[2:05:47.260 --> 2:05:50.260]  I used to stay up till 2, 3 in the morning.
[2:05:50.260 --> 2:05:52.260]  Most nights, because I had to read this book.
[2:05:52.260 --> 2:05:54.260]  I had to read this book.
[2:05:54.260 --> 2:05:57.260]  I have to read every page of Carol Quickly, Strategy and Hope.
[2:05:57.260 --> 2:05:59.260]  Oh, 1120-something pages.
[2:05:59.260 --> 2:06:02.260]  And it was just, you know what it is?
[2:06:02.260 --> 2:06:04.260]  You don't get knowledge from them.
[2:06:04.260 --> 2:06:09.260]  You get how diseased it is and how twisted it is
[2:06:09.260 --> 2:06:13.260]  and how it's a bunch of sophistic garbage
[2:06:13.260 --> 2:06:16.260]  to placate the establishment, to act intellectual.
[2:06:16.260 --> 2:06:21.260]  So Robert Barons, whose granddaddy stole the money,
[2:06:21.260 --> 2:06:24.260]  read it and can't understand it.
[2:06:24.260 --> 2:06:28.260]  And so they then think, oh, this guy should be put in charge
[2:06:28.260 --> 2:06:32.260]  because what they've created doesn't make sense.
[2:06:32.260 --> 2:06:35.260]  And see, that's how I learned the insanity of these people.
[2:06:35.260 --> 2:06:39.260]  And now you see the super extreme production of that.
[2:06:43.260 --> 2:06:47.260]  I mean, I'd read some captain's report from a battle in the Nile with Napoleon.
[2:06:47.260 --> 2:06:49.260]  It made total sense.
[2:06:49.260 --> 2:06:51.260]  It's eloquent, well-written.
[2:06:51.260 --> 2:06:52.260]  You'd cross reverence.
[2:06:52.260 --> 2:06:53.260]  It was all accurate.
[2:06:53.260 --> 2:06:54.260]  Everything was about truth back then.
[2:06:54.260 --> 2:06:56.260]  Because if you lied once, nobody would remember.
[2:06:56.260 --> 2:06:57.260]  People kill you.
[2:06:57.260 --> 2:06:58.260]  They want truth.
[2:06:58.260 --> 2:06:59.260]  You're dead, you lie.
[2:06:59.260 --> 2:07:02.260]  Death to liars.
[2:07:02.260 --> 2:07:03.260]  And you read the modern stuff.
[2:07:03.260 --> 2:07:06.260]  Nothing makes any sense because it's not meant to be truthful.
[2:07:06.260 --> 2:07:08.260]  It's all just deception.
[2:07:08.260 --> 2:07:14.260]  And you look at Biden unable to talk and Big Mike unable to talk and all of it.
[2:07:14.260 --> 2:07:15.260]  You go, what's wrong with them?
[2:07:15.260 --> 2:07:17.260]  Why do they suck so bad?
[2:07:17.260 --> 2:07:21.260]  Because they don't want to feed you real intellectual, interesting oratory.
[2:07:21.260 --> 2:07:23.260]  They don't want you to have a pro-human idea.
[2:07:23.260 --> 2:07:28.260]  They want you to sign on to something totally devoid of reality.
[2:07:28.260 --> 2:07:31.260]  And empty as hell.
[2:07:31.260 --> 2:07:39.260]  Because if you eat that, it's just like eating some Monsanto McDonald's hamburger.
[2:07:39.260 --> 2:07:45.260]  It's going to give you pancreatic cancer faster, you can say, kiss my ass.
[2:07:45.260 --> 2:07:48.260]  And this stuff gives you cancer in the soul.
[2:07:48.260 --> 2:07:49.260]  None of it's real.
[2:07:49.260 --> 2:07:50.260]  None of it's bonafide.
[2:07:50.260 --> 2:07:52.260]  None of it delivers.
[2:07:52.260 --> 2:07:55.260]  You read Plato's Republic, that's how the whole world works.
[2:07:55.260 --> 2:07:58.260]  Every bit of it makes sense from an evil perspective.
[2:07:58.260 --> 2:08:03.260]  You read Socrates, it all makes sense, even if you don't agree with it all.
[2:08:03.260 --> 2:08:11.260]  You read Adolf Hitler or Xi Jinping, it looks like a bunch of donkey turds on the ground.
[2:08:11.260 --> 2:08:13.260]  Because it's crap.
[2:08:13.260 --> 2:08:14.260]  It's lies.
[2:08:14.260 --> 2:08:15.260]  It's garbage.
[2:08:15.260 --> 2:08:17.260]  It's not real.
[2:08:17.260 --> 2:08:18.260]  It's fraud.
[2:08:18.260 --> 2:08:19.260]  It's mental illness.
[2:08:19.260 --> 2:08:20.260]  It doesn't deliver.
[2:08:20.260 --> 2:08:22.260]  You read the Declaration of Independence, eloquence.
[2:08:22.260 --> 2:08:24.260]  You read the Bill of Rights, eloquence.
[2:08:24.260 --> 2:08:29.260]  You read our founding fathers, eloquence, because they respected you.
[2:08:29.260 --> 2:08:33.260]  They talked to you like a man or like a woman.
[2:08:33.260 --> 2:08:39.260]  And they expected by their knowledge to be so high to raise you up, because they were so confident,
[2:08:39.260 --> 2:08:43.260]  they were not scared to give you the fire of Prometheus.
[2:08:43.260 --> 2:08:46.260]  And I'm not scared either, because I will rise with you.
[2:08:46.260 --> 2:08:48.260]  I'm going to say something right now.
[2:08:48.260 --> 2:08:53.260]  It's one of the most important things I've ever said, so please listen very, very carefully.
[2:08:53.260 --> 2:08:59.260]  Donald Trump is not the reason they released COVID or had the lockdown.
[2:08:59.260 --> 2:09:03.260]  They already had this plan, the Rockefeller Foundation, and Bill of Melinda Gates.
[2:09:03.260 --> 2:09:06.260]  It is beyond critical.
[2:09:06.260 --> 2:09:09.260]  It is life and death for you and your family to understand, no matter where you live on the planet,
[2:09:09.260 --> 2:09:17.260]  that this is a worldwide world government takeover on record that it's never going to end.
[2:09:17.260 --> 2:09:19.260]  The United Nations has admitted that.
[2:09:19.260 --> 2:09:22.260]  First it's a month, then it's six months, then they say, okay, it's two years.
[2:09:22.260 --> 2:09:25.260]  They're now saying two years.
[2:09:25.260 --> 2:09:27.260]  They're now saying you'll never go back to normal.
[2:09:27.260 --> 2:09:30.260]  No more gatherings, no more anything.
[2:09:30.260 --> 2:09:34.260]  Constant force inoculations that they admit don't even work.
[2:09:34.260 --> 2:09:37.260]  And the way they say they work, they change your DNA.
[2:09:37.260 --> 2:09:40.260]  This is the culling of the planet.
[2:09:40.260 --> 2:09:45.260]  This is the beginning of the straight jacket being put on you before you're slowly tortured to death and killed.
[2:09:45.260 --> 2:09:47.260]  Do you understand?
[2:09:47.260 --> 2:09:49.260]  It was a sleeper product.
[2:09:49.260 --> 2:09:54.260]  It wasn't popular at first, but as people tried it, it's become one of our top five best sellers.
[2:09:54.260 --> 2:09:57.260]  I'm talking about the eight pack power stack.
[2:09:57.260 --> 2:10:04.260]  13 different pills filled with super nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and more that you take in the morning and one pack and at night.
[2:10:04.260 --> 2:10:12.260]  It's available right now at 60% off for a limited time when you get it with survival shield X2 that's now back in stock.
[2:10:12.260 --> 2:10:15.260]  This has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[2:10:15.260 --> 2:10:24.260]  Now here's the problem, some of the patented ingredients that are in a pack power stack because of the shutdown and the lockdown are not available for us to even reorder it.
[2:10:24.260 --> 2:10:27.260]  So this could be the last shipment that we ever have.
[2:10:27.260 --> 2:10:29.260]  It's in stock now.
[2:10:29.260 --> 2:10:39.260]  Take advantage of this new combo special, part of a larger cell we have and free shipping on these cell items like eight pack power stack and X2 at infowarstore.com.

[2:10:49.260 --> 2:10:58.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:10:58.260 --> 2:11:16.260]  Scanning the scene of the city tonight, looking for you to start up a fight. There's an evil feeling in our minds to stop running away to the wonderful mind.
[2:11:16.260 --> 2:11:24.260]  Listen to a little bit of this classic Metallica from Killemall and then I'm going to get some really important news.
[2:11:24.260 --> 2:11:31.260]  We have a special guest in studio. Let's hear some of this.
[2:11:31.260 --> 2:11:44.260]  All right.
[2:11:44.260 --> 2:12:08.260]  Scanning the scene of the city tonight. Welcome to the Civil War.
[2:12:08.260 --> 2:12:19.260]  Scanning the scene of the city tonight. Looking for you to start up a fight. There's an evil feeling in our brains but it's nothing to you.
[2:12:19.260 --> 2:12:27.260]  You know what's out to say. Running on our way out. You will be tired.
[2:12:27.260 --> 2:12:38.260]  Hey, don't worry folks. They want a physical fight. They start one. We let them start it. It's like Bunker Hill.
[2:12:38.260 --> 2:12:51.260]  Hold your fire. Make them shoot first. But if they came for a war, they're going to get one.
[2:12:51.260 --> 2:13:01.260]  Yeah. Search and destroy. All right. That's enough. She can destroy.
[2:13:01.260 --> 2:13:07.260]  Sorry. I'm some flashbacks being about 10 years old. Listen to that. That's some good stuff.
[2:13:07.260 --> 2:13:10.260]  You had to stay up till midnight to hear that when I was about to end.
[2:13:10.260 --> 2:13:17.260]  Parents be asleep. Go down. Get the radio on. Plugging the headphones. Put that on.
[2:13:17.260 --> 2:13:26.260]  Sorry. Let's get serious.
[2:13:26.260 --> 2:13:41.260]  The fantastical nature of the cult-like brainwashing going on, the archetypally ridiculousness of it, is mind-blowing.
[2:13:41.260 --> 2:13:54.260]  I mean, to chronicle it, it's just dizzying. All of society being fed into the boa constrictor mouth, the maw, the gaping stink.
[2:13:54.260 --> 2:14:02.260]  Total social credit scores. Total tracking. None of it to do with safety. All of it in their own words for power and control.
[2:14:02.260 --> 2:14:15.260]  Day one, globalist businesses stay open all year's close. Just a savage siege. An absolutely barbarous guerrilla attack on all that is decent.
[2:14:15.260 --> 2:14:22.260]  Humanity should mobilize and say no to this from its very foundation.
[2:14:22.260 --> 2:14:29.260]  But look at these articles. And then this is in the BBC. Because I know you know InfoWorks doesn't lie to you, at least consciously.
[2:14:29.260 --> 2:14:34.260]  You make mistakes sometimes, very rarely. God, I wish we were wrong about all of it, believe me.
[2:14:34.260 --> 2:14:44.260]  Paul Joseph Washington article on this, they got signs up that say, look away from people.
[2:14:44.260 --> 2:14:51.260]  And psychologists are coming out saying, okay, this is mind control. This is shaming. This is total 1984.
[2:14:51.260 --> 2:14:56.260]  You know the massacre of fraud. You know COVID's overblown fraud. You know they're lying about the death numbers.
[2:14:56.260 --> 2:15:05.260]  They said 25 times more would die. I mean, you know all that. I mean, you know it. But now, in the UK and Airstrip 1 in 1984,
[2:15:05.260 --> 2:15:12.260]  look away when passing other people. It's always more, more, more, more. Now the mask has to be the proper mask.
[2:15:12.260 --> 2:15:17.260]  Now you can't leave your house with a mask. Now you're locked down for eight weeks in Australia. It's all a test.
[2:15:17.260 --> 2:15:21.260]  And now they're going to come and take your kids to make sure they're not sick.
[2:15:21.260 --> 2:15:31.260]  No, it's about kids being taken from adults. If you let them come take your children, you'll do anything.
[2:15:31.260 --> 2:15:38.260]  I could have done the whole four hours on that and taken calls the whole time.
[2:15:38.260 --> 2:15:42.260]  I mean, a good talk show that just wanted to not even have a producer. There's just one article, four hours.
[2:15:42.260 --> 2:15:47.260]  Hundreds of calls, incredible information. What's happening to you and your town, how it's being implemented.
[2:15:47.260 --> 2:15:55.260]  This is already in the U.S. as well. It's all UN run, comes down from the UN. The UN takes a crap up on the top of the hill and it rolls down.
[2:15:55.260 --> 2:16:03.260]  Right door to mouth. Oh, here it is. Delta Bands, Navy Seal, Creditive of Killing, Bin Laden,
[2:16:03.260 --> 2:16:11.260]  proposing picture of himself mask free. He goes on to say it's mind control. It's a fraud. It's about, and they said he's banned.
[2:16:11.260 --> 2:16:18.260]  American Airlines dropping service 15 cities. Chicago Mayor Bands protests, but only on her own block.
[2:16:18.260 --> 2:16:28.260]  You cannot make it up. She is on TV. There's videos of this saying I am important. She even said, I can get a haircut. You can.
[2:16:28.260 --> 2:16:35.260]  She's I'm the mayor. Imagine the soulless disconnect. I'm important. I get a haircut. You don't.
[2:16:35.260 --> 2:16:38.260]  I'm not going to play the clip. I've already played it 10 times. I'm going to play it again.
[2:16:38.260 --> 2:16:44.260]  I'm important. I get a haircut. If I catch you getting one, you're fired. What about everybody losing their job?
[2:16:44.260 --> 2:16:51.260]  Oh, she goes, go get the government program. All the regular folks can't get it. I have lawyers involved.
[2:16:51.260 --> 2:16:56.260]  And people like, hey, you don't want to do this deal. I said, just just see if we can get it. I had lawyers and accountants involved.
[2:16:56.260 --> 2:17:02.260]  We couldn't get the bailout.
[2:17:02.260 --> 2:17:15.260]  No one did. Everybody I talked to that was that was an auto parts salesman or a mechanic or a farmer or a teacher that was or or mainly the groups I was talking to was waitresses and people and bartenders.
[2:17:15.260 --> 2:17:21.260]  They just know I went to a hotel like I don't even let off. Oh, six weeks. Do you get money? No, there's no money. I tried to go on the computer would never load.
[2:17:21.260 --> 2:17:28.260]  Yeah, of course, would never load. You weren't given the right code as an insider to get the money.
[2:17:28.260 --> 2:17:35.260]  And it came out like select groups were given preferential treatment. Welcome to standing in line in Russia, man. It don't work.
[2:17:35.260 --> 2:17:47.260]  So the Chicago mayor bans protests at her block, but says Black Lives Matter is good. Can't make it up.
[2:17:47.260 --> 2:17:55.260]  JetBlue doubles down on kicking family off planes because two year old wasn't wearing a mask.
[2:17:55.260 --> 2:18:01.260]  Smothering your children, torturing them, training you to abuse your children to submit to the corporates. There's nothing.
[2:18:01.260 --> 2:18:10.260]  But again, Whitefoot says she has a right to make sure their house is secure, but you can't have police. You can't have guns and you can't protest at her house.
[2:18:10.260 --> 2:18:13.260]  You can protest anywhere else.
[2:18:13.260 --> 2:18:16.260]  And it goes on and on and on.
[2:18:16.260 --> 2:18:26.260]  Belgium doctors urge families to wear a mask at home as Belgians tire of COVID rules. Every time you go take it off, they go, oh, you got to wear it when you have sex.
[2:18:26.260 --> 2:18:32.260]  Like, I am not going to wear this going down the street. You need to wear it when you have sex. They just clamp down when you that's psychology.
[2:18:32.260 --> 2:18:41.260]  When you say no, you expand, they contract down to nothing. It's like a lawsuit. They go, we want $100 million. You don't have $5 million.
[2:18:41.260 --> 2:18:46.260]  But they say that so a million doesn't sound so big. Give us $100 million.
[2:18:46.260 --> 2:18:51.260]  You're like, I don't even have a million. Okay, we'll take the million. I said I don't have a million.
[2:18:51.260 --> 2:18:57.260]  But see how the psychology works? Oh, I'm really sick of this. The scientists have been at the hoax. I want this off of me.
[2:18:57.260 --> 2:19:04.260]  They go, oh, no, I'm sorry. We want everything. It's all psychology.
[2:19:04.260 --> 2:19:07.260]  You're like, well, how do we beat psychologists and psychiatrists in the media?
[2:19:07.260 --> 2:19:12.260]  You don't believe a damn word they say. That's how. And I even catch myself sometimes.
[2:19:12.260 --> 2:19:17.260]  Like, yeah, Hannity's going to get fired. He attacked the president. He's an enemy.
[2:19:17.260 --> 2:19:22.260]  Because I go look it up. It's not even true. It's like, why did I even believe that from Brian Stelter?
[2:19:22.260 --> 2:19:29.260]  It's like, I know he's a liar. I don't want to use a gross analogy, but let's say you had a donkey's ass.
[2:19:29.260 --> 2:19:33.260]  And they go, oh, cherry pie comes out of the back of this. You just keep seeing crap coming out of it.
[2:19:33.260 --> 2:19:37.260]  You wait for months over the cherry pie to come out. Cherry pie don't come out that ass.
[2:19:37.260 --> 2:19:42.260]  Key lime pie, none of it. It may look like chocolate pie, but it didn't.
[2:19:42.260 --> 2:19:46.260]  Stop expecting now to see an end. It craps on you.
[2:19:46.260 --> 2:19:54.260]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil is known to be so good for your brain, so good for your heart, so good for your cells,
[2:19:54.260 --> 2:19:58.260]  your cardiovascular system, your lungs, your sleep. It's amazing.

[2:20:42.260 --> 2:20:57.260]  We hear that. That's the march of the United Nations and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[2:20:57.260 --> 2:21:04.260]  Coming with their battle plan, psychological warfare operation with the forced inoculations
[2:21:04.260 --> 2:21:08.260]  and the permanent lockdown of civilization and society.
[2:21:08.260 --> 2:21:12.260]  They're outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu.
[2:21:12.260 --> 2:21:16.260]  They're creating artificial phobias for normal death that takes place.
[2:21:16.260 --> 2:21:18.260]  They're not even promising to have a cure to it all.
[2:21:18.260 --> 2:21:23.260]  They're just inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary regime
[2:21:23.260 --> 2:21:32.260]  directed by the WHO with vaccines that actually change your DNA and make you owned by Microsoft.
[2:21:32.260 --> 2:21:40.260]  It's a final frontier. It's the year 2020. It's not coming. It's here.
[2:21:40.260 --> 2:22:06.260]  And submission is blood in the water.

[2:22:38.260 --> 2:22:59.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:22:59.260 --> 2:23:02.260]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[2:23:02.260 --> 2:23:03.260]  You think just let me sick.
[2:23:03.260 --> 2:23:08.260]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will still be on their way.
[2:23:08.260 --> 2:23:09.260]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[2:23:09.260 --> 2:23:10.260]  Damn it.
[2:23:10.260 --> 2:23:11.260]  Why?
[2:23:11.260 --> 2:23:18.260]  Because while the truncheon may be used at lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[2:23:18.260 --> 2:23:23.260]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[2:23:23.260 --> 2:23:29.260]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[2:23:29.260 --> 2:23:30.260]  You decided, sir.
[2:23:30.260 --> 2:23:31.260]  You wanted it foolproof.
[2:23:31.260 --> 2:23:33.260]  You told me every television in London.
[2:23:33.260 --> 2:23:36.260]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[2:23:36.260 --> 2:23:41.260]  And where once you had the freedom to object and think and speak as you saw fit, you now
[2:23:41.260 --> 2:23:45.260]  have sensors and systems of surveillance, perversing your conformity and suppression.
[2:23:45.260 --> 2:23:46.260]  Cameras.
[2:23:46.260 --> 2:23:47.260]  We need cameras.
[2:23:47.260 --> 2:23:48.260]  How did this happen?
[2:23:48.260 --> 2:23:49.260]  Who's to blame?
[2:23:49.260 --> 2:23:53.260]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[2:23:53.260 --> 2:23:55.260]  They will be held accountable.
[2:23:55.260 --> 2:24:00.260]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you think you need only look
[2:24:00.260 --> 2:24:01.260]  into a mirror.
[2:24:01.260 --> 2:24:02.260]  I know why you did it.
[2:24:02.260 --> 2:24:03.260]  I know why you did it.
[2:24:03.260 --> 2:24:04.260]  I know you were afraid.
[2:24:04.260 --> 2:24:05.260]  Who wouldn't be?
[2:24:05.260 --> 2:24:06.260]  War, terror and disease.
[2:24:06.260 --> 2:24:15.260]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your
[2:24:15.260 --> 2:24:16.260]  common sense.
[2:24:16.260 --> 2:24:21.260]  Fear got the best of you and in your panic, you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam
[2:24:21.260 --> 2:24:22.260]  Suttler.
[2:24:22.260 --> 2:24:23.260]  He promised you order.
[2:24:23.260 --> 2:24:25.260]  He promised you peace.
[2:24:25.260 --> 2:24:35.260]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[2:24:35.260 --> 2:24:37.260]  There is a war.
[2:24:37.260 --> 2:24:38.260]  It's happening now.
[2:24:38.260 --> 2:24:41.260]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[2:24:41.260 --> 2:24:43.260]  The time to choose sides has come.
[2:24:43.260 --> 2:24:45.260]  We are the resistance.
[2:24:45.260 --> 2:24:54.260]  We are the Info War.
[2:24:54.260 --> 2:25:00.260]  You are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals.
[2:25:00.260 --> 2:25:04.260]  Does that sound like something you are behind?
[2:25:04.260 --> 2:25:10.260]  Well, I haven't heard that, but is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing?
[2:25:10.260 --> 2:25:18.260]  Marina Abranovic is a superstar with every weird, twisted Hollywood, D.C. or New York
[2:25:18.260 --> 2:25:19.260]  lowlife.
[2:25:19.260 --> 2:25:25.260]  Christmas ornaments, drywall and jury empties.
[2:25:25.260 --> 2:25:28.260]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[2:25:28.260 --> 2:25:33.260]  Maxwell participated with and assisted Epstein in maintaining and protecting his sex trafficking
[2:25:33.260 --> 2:25:38.260]  ring, ensuring that approximately three girls a day were made available to him.
[2:25:38.260 --> 2:25:40.260]  Human smuggling.
[2:25:40.260 --> 2:25:42.260]  People think of that as an ancient art.
[2:25:42.260 --> 2:25:47.260]  There are more human smugglers right now, traffickers they call them, than at any time in the history
[2:25:47.260 --> 2:25:48.260]  of our world.
[2:25:48.260 --> 2:25:52.260]  Trump has signed executive orders to expand the introduction of human trafficking.
[2:25:52.260 --> 2:25:53.260]  It's exploded.
[2:25:53.260 --> 2:25:55.260]  He's got the Navy and the Army involved stopping it.
[2:25:55.260 --> 2:25:58.260]  And they're having huge busts of small children getting out.
[2:25:58.260 --> 2:26:02.260]  Operation Cross Country led to the arrest of 120 human traffickers.
[2:26:02.260 --> 2:26:05.260]  One of the victims was just three months old.
[2:26:05.260 --> 2:26:07.260]  124 arrests.
[2:26:07.260 --> 2:26:11.260]  339 criminal arrests were made across the state.
[2:26:11.260 --> 2:26:15.260]  84 underage boys and girls forced into prostitution.
[2:26:15.260 --> 2:26:20.260]  Terrorist deputies have announced the arrest of 25 people accused of traveling to have
[2:26:20.260 --> 2:26:21.260]  sex with a child.
[2:26:21.260 --> 2:26:26.260]  Tonight more than half a dozen accused child sexual predators are off the street.
[2:26:26.260 --> 2:26:31.260]  One trafficker was arrested after making a deal with an undercover agent to sell a three month old
[2:26:31.260 --> 2:26:34.260]  girl and her five year old sister for sex.
[2:26:34.260 --> 2:26:36.260]  Human sex trafficking of juveniles.
[2:26:36.260 --> 2:26:42.260]  I am prepared to bring the full force and weight of our government that we can do in
[2:26:42.260 --> 2:26:45.260]  order to solve this horrific problem.
[2:26:45.260 --> 2:26:50.260]  The whole Clinton system is just littered with pedophiles and Tony Podesta running full
[2:26:50.260 --> 2:26:53.260]  page articles about how he loves art of naked children.
[2:26:53.260 --> 2:26:55.260]  They're throwing it in our face.
[2:26:55.260 --> 2:27:05.260]  Well, Deanna Lorraine is here with us in studio.
[2:27:05.260 --> 2:27:07.260]  We'll do a little bit in the next hour.
[2:27:07.260 --> 2:27:11.260]  And then the great Dr. Nick Baggich talk about somebody that's a trailblazer like David Ike.
[2:27:11.260 --> 2:27:13.260]  He's been around as long or longer.
[2:27:13.260 --> 2:27:15.260]  David Ike kind of that first wave of awakening.
[2:27:15.260 --> 2:27:18.260]  He's gonna be hosting much of the fourth hour ahead of the war room.
[2:27:18.260 --> 2:27:23.260]  Well, Deanna, I had a lot of fun with you on area or state covering service issues and
[2:27:23.260 --> 2:27:25.260]  we had a lot of fun tonight.
[2:27:25.260 --> 2:27:27.260]  Going out to the lake and checking stuff out with the crew.
[2:27:27.260 --> 2:27:28.260]  Yeah.
[2:27:28.260 --> 2:27:29.260]  Beautiful sunset.
[2:27:29.260 --> 2:27:30.260]  Gorgeous sunset.
[2:27:30.260 --> 2:27:31.260]  Gorgeous.
[2:27:31.260 --> 2:27:32.260]  I love Austin.
[2:27:32.260 --> 2:27:35.260]  It's too bad what's happening right now with everything going on.
[2:27:35.260 --> 2:27:36.260]  It's just crazy that everything.
[2:27:36.260 --> 2:27:38.260]  You notice there were no boats out there.
[2:27:38.260 --> 2:27:39.260]  Yes.
[2:27:39.260 --> 2:27:40.260]  And that's abnormal, right?
[2:27:40.260 --> 2:27:41.260]  I would imagine that's abnormal.
[2:27:41.260 --> 2:27:45.260]  But, you know, everything, what they have to do is systematically strip us from our
[2:27:45.260 --> 2:27:48.260]  joy with everything in life right now.
[2:27:48.260 --> 2:27:49.260]  And it's monotony.
[2:27:49.260 --> 2:27:50.260]  Have you noticed?
[2:27:50.260 --> 2:27:52.260]  Everything's the same food right now.
[2:27:52.260 --> 2:27:54.260]  Everything is the same kind of environment right now.
[2:27:54.260 --> 2:27:55.260]  You can't go to a bar.
[2:27:55.260 --> 2:27:56.260]  All the menus.
[2:27:56.260 --> 2:27:57.260]  It's all liberal.
[2:27:57.260 --> 2:27:58.260]  Yes.
[2:27:58.260 --> 2:27:59.260]  All the menus are smaller.
[2:27:59.260 --> 2:28:00.260]  Yes.
[2:28:00.260 --> 2:28:01.260]  And they're all in on it.
[2:28:01.260 --> 2:28:02.260]  They all admit it's about.
[2:28:02.260 --> 2:28:03.260]  Yeah.
[2:28:03.260 --> 2:28:04.260]  Well, yeah, they don't even have menus.
[2:28:04.260 --> 2:28:06.260]  For most places, actually, you have to do it with your phone, right?
[2:28:06.260 --> 2:28:07.260]  Exactly.
[2:28:07.260 --> 2:28:08.260]  They're getting rid of paper.
[2:28:08.260 --> 2:28:09.260]  Yeah.
[2:28:09.260 --> 2:28:10.260]  Because they want to be able to alter things in real time.
[2:28:10.260 --> 2:28:11.260]  Right.
[2:28:11.260 --> 2:28:12.260]  And I notice here they're trying to get rid of cash.
[2:28:12.260 --> 2:28:13.260]  They're trying to get rid of coins.
[2:28:13.260 --> 2:28:14.260]  In Texas, it's big.
[2:28:14.260 --> 2:28:15.260]  Oh, yeah.
[2:28:15.260 --> 2:28:16.260]  Oh, yeah.
[2:28:16.260 --> 2:28:17.260]  Oh, yeah.
[2:28:17.260 --> 2:28:18.260]  You wouldn't miss when you get rid of cash.
[2:28:18.260 --> 2:28:19.260]  This is all a rollout.
[2:28:19.260 --> 2:28:20.260]  Right.
[2:28:20.260 --> 2:28:23.260]  So, you know, it's, well, we used to, because it took time to load an article when I was
[2:28:23.260 --> 2:28:24.260]  on it.
[2:28:24.260 --> 2:28:25.260]  Yeah.
[2:28:25.260 --> 2:28:26.260]  27 years ago.
[2:28:26.260 --> 2:28:28.260]  But now, especially, they change them.
[2:28:28.260 --> 2:28:30.260]  So, we actually print everything we look at.
[2:28:30.260 --> 2:28:31.260]  Right.
[2:28:31.260 --> 2:28:33.260]  And you, you have to see it when you're, when you're doing the news, when you're doing a
[2:28:33.260 --> 2:28:36.260]  show, you kind of want to see everything laid out right this, but they're trying to
[2:28:36.260 --> 2:28:37.260]  get rid of paper, everything.
[2:28:37.260 --> 2:28:41.260]  And, and they're systematically stripping us from our joy because you can't, at this
[2:28:41.260 --> 2:28:43.260]  point in America, you can't really escape.
[2:28:43.260 --> 2:28:48.260]  I went to Florida a couple of weeks ago, just to try to escape from the communist California,
[2:28:48.260 --> 2:28:50.260]  some new, some conditions, which is just crazy.
[2:28:50.260 --> 2:28:51.260]  I mean, it's very oppressive.
[2:28:51.260 --> 2:28:55.260]  And then I go to Florida, but it's really the exact same thing.
[2:28:55.260 --> 2:29:00.260]  You know, they issue it a statewide 8 p.m. curfew or a, you know, a couple areas they say it's
[2:29:00.260 --> 2:29:02.260]  8 p.m. curfew or 10 p.m. curfew.
[2:29:02.260 --> 2:29:04.260]  And it's the same thing.
[2:29:04.260 --> 2:29:06.260]  The social distancing signs are everywhere flashing.
[2:29:06.260 --> 2:29:09.260]  The mandatory masks are everywhere.
[2:29:09.260 --> 2:29:11.260]  You have to go and do the same thing.
[2:29:11.260 --> 2:29:12.260]  Have a national mandate.
[2:29:12.260 --> 2:29:17.260]  So, it's, it's kind of, it's kind of entrapping you in this, in this mental misery.
[2:29:17.260 --> 2:29:18.260]  Don't you think?
[2:29:18.260 --> 2:29:19.260]  But it's everywhere.
[2:29:19.260 --> 2:29:21.260]  They, they want you to not escape.
[2:29:21.260 --> 2:29:25.260]  So even the strongest, most emotionally strong person really can't escape from this kind
[2:29:25.260 --> 2:29:26.260]  of torture.
[2:29:26.260 --> 2:29:27.260]  And they want you to be like that.
[2:29:27.260 --> 2:29:28.260]  They break it down.
[2:29:28.260 --> 2:29:29.260]  And then you get to see all the sheep.
[2:29:29.260 --> 2:29:31.260]  You get to see all the sheep who get off on it.
[2:29:31.260 --> 2:29:33.260]  This morning, I got up at about 4 a.m.
[2:29:33.260 --> 2:29:36.260]  I went and, and, and about 6 30 did a hike.
[2:29:36.260 --> 2:29:40.260]  And literally the first few times it happened, although, okay, I'm being paranoid.
[2:29:40.260 --> 2:29:44.260]  These guys would be jogging on these paths were like 15 feet wide, 10 feet wide.
[2:29:44.260 --> 2:29:46.260]  They jogged towards me when they're wearing a mask.
[2:29:46.260 --> 2:29:47.260]  You're kind of aggressive.
[2:29:47.260 --> 2:29:48.260]  Right.
[2:29:48.260 --> 2:29:51.260]  And because they're, they're, they would like always adjust it when they ran by me.
[2:29:51.260 --> 2:29:54.260]  It's the same weird neurotic ticks.
[2:29:54.260 --> 2:29:55.260]  Yes, exactly.
[2:29:55.260 --> 2:30:01.260]  They're, they're turning them into these OCD super neurotic people that are becoming
[2:30:01.260 --> 2:30:02.260]  like our Nazis, right?
[2:30:02.260 --> 2:30:04.260]  They're the ones shaming us into submission.
[2:30:04.260 --> 2:30:08.260]  They're the ones trying to shame us and scream at us when we're not following the rules.
[2:30:08.260 --> 2:30:10.260]  Have you heard the new thing in the UK?
[2:30:10.260 --> 2:30:12.260]  They have signs up saying, turn your head when you walk by.
[2:30:12.260 --> 2:30:13.260]  That is nuts.
[2:30:13.260 --> 2:30:18.260]  This is all just psychologists and psychiatrists testing what mind control they can engage in.
[2:30:18.260 --> 2:30:19.260]  Right.
[2:30:19.260 --> 2:30:20.260]  Right.
[2:30:20.260 --> 2:30:21.260]  Exactly.
[2:30:21.260 --> 2:30:24.260]  And it's all conditioning because in, you know, six months earlier, we never would
[2:30:24.260 --> 2:30:27.260]  have imagined we'd be in this situation where there's something, we never heard the term.
[2:30:27.260 --> 2:30:28.260]  Slow down there.
[2:30:28.260 --> 2:30:29.260]  Imagine a year ago.
[2:30:29.260 --> 2:30:30.260]  Yeah.
[2:30:30.260 --> 2:30:34.260]  If we told you colleges are saying you can't leave for the semester.
[2:30:34.260 --> 2:30:36.260]  We're tracking you by phone app.
[2:30:36.260 --> 2:30:40.260]  Social distancing, Chinese social credit score, a turn your head.
[2:30:40.260 --> 2:30:41.260]  There's always more.
[2:30:41.260 --> 2:30:42.260]  Right.
[2:30:42.260 --> 2:30:46.260]  And that's the thing, you can never, you can never let them take an inch because once they
[2:30:46.260 --> 2:30:49.260]  let you take an inch, they're going to take 10 miles, run with it and run with it.
[2:30:49.260 --> 2:30:51.260]  We understand the slippery slope because it's true.
[2:30:51.260 --> 2:30:52.260]  Well, we've gone off it.
[2:30:52.260 --> 2:30:53.260]  We were off the slope.
[2:30:53.260 --> 2:30:54.260]  We're like falling now.
[2:30:54.260 --> 2:30:57.260]  We're off the cliff right now, but this is what they do.
[2:30:57.260 --> 2:31:02.260]  You know, they try to, they try to just siphon off our joy, siphon off our freedom more and
[2:31:02.260 --> 2:31:04.260]  more until there is nothing left.
[2:31:04.260 --> 2:31:05.260]  There's no joy.
[2:31:05.260 --> 2:31:06.260]  There's no left.
[2:31:06.260 --> 2:31:09.260]  But you know, up until funny, up until about six months ago before we heard of coronavirus,
[2:31:09.260 --> 2:31:13.260]  they were study after study that proved it was common knowledge that social isolation
[2:31:13.260 --> 2:31:15.260]  is a shocker.
[2:31:15.260 --> 2:31:16.260]  It's a bad thing.
[2:31:16.260 --> 2:31:17.260]  Right.
[2:31:17.260 --> 2:31:22.260]  Social isolation can create misery, can create suicidal tendencies, psychological distress.
[2:31:22.260 --> 2:31:23.260]  It's always been in that case.
[2:31:23.260 --> 2:31:25.260]  Why do you think they put people in solitary confinement?
[2:31:25.260 --> 2:31:26.260]  Right.
[2:31:26.260 --> 2:31:29.260]  And now all of a sudden the coronavirus appears and now all of a sudden nobody talks about
[2:31:29.260 --> 2:31:34.260]  the fact that social isolation has been known to be a very negative thing for people.
[2:31:34.260 --> 2:31:38.260]  Now this is all mind control training to make sure you stay where you are.
[2:31:38.260 --> 2:31:39.260]  You follow the orders.
[2:31:39.260 --> 2:31:43.260]  And then now once you follow those orders, more orders, more orders, what's going to
[2:31:43.260 --> 2:31:44.260]  happen?
[2:31:44.260 --> 2:31:48.260]  Because I already have seen the text messages of the Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii.
[2:31:48.260 --> 2:31:49.760]  They plan next year to start.
[2:31:49.760 --> 2:31:51.260]  No vaccine can't leave your house.
[2:31:51.260 --> 2:31:52.260]  That's.
[2:31:52.260 --> 2:31:54.260]  And Australia has already announced it.
[2:31:54.260 --> 2:31:55.260]  So it's not coming.
[2:31:55.260 --> 2:31:56.260]  It's here.
[2:31:56.260 --> 2:31:58.260]  What's the awakening going to look like there?
[2:31:58.260 --> 2:31:59.260]  The awakening.
[2:31:59.260 --> 2:32:00.260]  I don't know.
[2:32:00.260 --> 2:32:04.260]  I mean, people have to wake up, but that's why you and I, we sound the alarm every single
[2:32:04.260 --> 2:32:06.860]  day because there's just no, you can't be silent anymore.
[2:32:06.860 --> 2:32:07.860]  We cannot be silent.
[2:32:07.860 --> 2:32:10.180]  We have no room, no time to be silent.
[2:32:10.180 --> 2:32:14.000]  We have to fight this and we're at the front lines of this war and everyone's just kind
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:16.260]  of sitting back and letting this happen.
[2:32:16.260 --> 2:32:19.140]  But once they do this, they're not going to just suddenly roll back.
[2:32:19.140 --> 2:32:22.380]  They're not going to suddenly say, oh, we're going to, we're going to stop reinforcing
[2:32:22.380 --> 2:32:23.380]  mandatory vaccines.
[2:32:23.380 --> 2:32:24.940]  I mean, it's coming.
[2:32:24.940 --> 2:32:28.420]  It's just like when they said, you know, we're going to start removing children from the
[2:32:28.420 --> 2:32:31.860]  home and putting them into quarantine who are testing positive.
[2:32:31.860 --> 2:32:32.860]  Oh, guess what?
[2:32:32.860 --> 2:32:37.580]  We realized that when you're in your home, you actually are more likely to catch coronavirus
[2:32:37.580 --> 2:32:38.580]  than when you're out in public.
[2:32:38.580 --> 2:32:40.860]  And now the U.N. has started in Australia.
[2:32:40.860 --> 2:32:41.860]  You're absolutely right.
[2:32:41.860 --> 2:32:42.860]  Right.
[2:32:42.860 --> 2:32:43.860]  Exactly.
[2:32:43.860 --> 2:32:44.860]  The honorable rain, stay with us.
[2:32:44.860 --> 2:32:45.860]  I talked to the EMS and I talked to the medical doctors and what makes you nauseated, it's
[2:32:45.860 --> 2:32:46.860]  not just the smell of piss.
[2:32:46.860 --> 2:32:47.860]  Well, we call the smell of bum piss.
[2:32:47.860 --> 2:32:48.860]  It has that sweet, nauseating smell.
[2:32:48.860 --> 2:32:49.860]  Yeah.
[2:32:49.860 --> 2:32:50.860]  I wouldn't say sweet.
[2:32:50.860 --> 2:32:51.860]  Well, it does.
[2:32:51.860 --> 2:32:52.860]  It's a sweet, sweet stench.
[2:32:52.860 --> 2:32:53.860]  It makes you want to throw up like rotten meat.
[2:32:53.860 --> 2:32:54.860]  It is, it is the crap of dust mites.
[2:32:54.860 --> 2:32:55.860]  Have you noticed the stench of bum piss?
[2:32:55.860 --> 2:33:08.860]  In your leftist-run neighborhoods, the crap of dust mites in bum piss is a real thing.

[2:36:13.100 --> 2:36:38.020]  We are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate has been feeding on America
[2:36:38.020 --> 2:36:45.020]  is being exposed and removed.
[2:36:45.020 --> 2:37:05.500]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to their aid of the country, spread
[2:37:05.500 --> 2:37:12.500]  the word.
[2:37:12.500 --> 2:37:27.180]  When I grow up, I want to free planet Earth from the Satanist, but he now take you live
[2:37:27.180 --> 2:37:32.820]  to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance, you're listening
[2:37:32.820 --> 2:37:49.700]  to Alex Jones, they're all Satanists, all of this is their stated plan, what's crazy
[2:37:49.700 --> 2:37:52.580]  is it's all admitted, lay it out for them, it's all right there.
[2:37:52.580 --> 2:37:58.540]  So agenda 2030 is just another term for the Fourth Industrial Revolution by the World
[2:37:58.540 --> 2:38:03.220]  Economic Forum, and if you go to the World Economic Forum's website right now, you can
[2:38:03.220 --> 2:38:08.220]  see them promoting what's called the Great Global Economic Reset and the Fourth Industrial
[2:38:08.220 --> 2:38:09.220]  Revolution.
[2:38:09.220 --> 2:38:13.940]  It's right there on the homepage, and the World Economic Forum is supposed to be a reputable
[2:38:13.940 --> 2:38:20.140]  global organization, right, where we're supposed to interest with our economic concepts and
[2:38:20.140 --> 2:38:21.140]  themes.
[2:38:21.140 --> 2:38:24.820]  The AI will run everything, it's nonpartisan.
[2:38:24.820 --> 2:38:29.420]  And they're talking about, okay, we're going to replace human workers with AI and robots,
[2:38:29.420 --> 2:38:33.540]  boom, it's right there, talks about we're going to have a glow digital currency that's
[2:38:33.540 --> 2:38:34.540]  going to...
[2:38:34.540 --> 2:38:35.540]  And they say, well then phase out humans.
[2:38:35.540 --> 2:38:36.540]  Exactly.
[2:38:36.540 --> 2:38:38.540]  It's like, oh, you're phasing me out of that?
[2:38:38.540 --> 2:38:39.540]  Cool.
[2:38:39.540 --> 2:38:43.300]  But they couch it in this propaganda and this fluffy language, we're like, oh, we're going
[2:38:43.300 --> 2:38:47.340]  to replace you with AI, and we're going to put a chip inside you that's going to vaccinate
[2:38:47.340 --> 2:38:51.260]  you, and that's going to have birth control that's going to be, you know, charged by a
[2:38:51.260 --> 2:38:53.540]  remote control that someone else, I guess, Bill Gates.
[2:38:53.540 --> 2:38:56.340]  And then we talk about it and they go, oh, that doesn't exist when it does.
[2:38:56.340 --> 2:38:57.340]  It's right there.
[2:38:57.340 --> 2:38:58.340]  Exactly.
[2:38:58.340 --> 2:39:01.420]  I mean, if they trust Planned Parenthood, then they should, they obviously trust World
[2:39:01.420 --> 2:39:04.940]  Economic Forum, but it's right there, and the problem that I have with these sheeple
[2:39:04.940 --> 2:39:09.100]  is that they're so dumb, and look, even Republicans, there's a lot of Republicans that don't really
[2:39:09.100 --> 2:39:13.140]  know this stuff as much as I try to sound the alarm, and I'm like, I feel like I'm screaming
[2:39:13.140 --> 2:39:18.460]  underwater to deaf people, but it's like as much as you shout out, a lot of people just
[2:39:18.460 --> 2:39:19.900]  still think it's a conspiracy theory.
[2:39:19.900 --> 2:39:23.380]  But that's the key, and people just go look it up and see it's real.
[2:39:23.380 --> 2:39:24.380]  Yeah.
[2:39:24.380 --> 2:39:25.380]  That's what they're doing right now on TV.
[2:39:25.380 --> 2:39:26.380]  We can go to the end of you.
[2:39:26.380 --> 2:39:30.060]  Because we can show when they push it as good, we say no, they say it doesn't exist.
[2:39:30.060 --> 2:39:31.060]  It's a game they play.
[2:39:31.060 --> 2:39:32.060]  It's a game.
[2:39:32.060 --> 2:39:35.300]  As long as you bypass that rule, they actually said people will reject this.
[2:39:35.300 --> 2:39:36.300]  Yes, they will.
[2:39:36.300 --> 2:39:37.300]  Exactly.
[2:39:37.300 --> 2:39:40.140]  And they're so good at it, they've been doing it for decades now, they've been training
[2:39:40.140 --> 2:39:45.180]  us to think of things as conspiracy theories that are so wacky like this, and because
[2:39:45.180 --> 2:39:49.140]  they make movies about it, they see that that desensitizes us to it.
[2:39:49.140 --> 2:39:51.340]  So we're like, oh, that's just a sci-fi movie.
[2:39:51.340 --> 2:39:52.660]  You know, that's crazy.
[2:39:52.660 --> 2:39:57.180]  But they're rolling this out right now, step by step, and in fact, they're escalating the
[2:39:57.180 --> 2:39:58.180]  plan.
[2:39:58.180 --> 2:40:01.820]  COVID has escalated the plan, it's escalated 2030 by a couple of years.
[2:40:01.820 --> 2:40:04.820]  It's a force jumping of the train onto their tracks.
[2:40:04.820 --> 2:40:05.820]  Exactly.
[2:40:05.820 --> 2:40:09.380]  And you know, they're getting us used to living in these smaller communities and everything.
[2:40:09.380 --> 2:40:13.620]  Even notice that a couple months ago, they're trying harder and harder to tie COVID into
[2:40:13.620 --> 2:40:16.060]  sustainable development goals and climate change.
[2:40:16.060 --> 2:40:17.780]  And they say it's good for the earth.
[2:40:17.780 --> 2:40:18.780]  Right.
[2:40:18.780 --> 2:40:20.380]  Actually, COVID's helping lower carbon right now.
[2:40:20.380 --> 2:40:22.500]  Oh, and you see it.
[2:40:22.500 --> 2:40:23.980]  You see these articles coming out.
[2:40:23.980 --> 2:40:24.980]  And they're so ridiculous.
[2:40:24.980 --> 2:40:28.140]  I have to laugh at them as saying, well, they sound like Hitler wrote them because if you
[2:40:28.140 --> 2:40:31.100]  know the goal, I mean, this is what Nazis dream of.
[2:40:31.100 --> 2:40:32.100]  This is like.
[2:40:32.100 --> 2:40:36.940]  And when they say the desperation of their ability to tie it in, they say, oh, because
[2:40:36.940 --> 2:40:39.940]  of COVID, you should no longer eat meat.
[2:40:39.940 --> 2:40:41.340]  You know, we should all be vegans.
[2:40:41.340 --> 2:40:42.340]  Like what?
[2:40:42.340 --> 2:40:43.620]  How does that tie into COVID?
[2:40:43.620 --> 2:40:48.380]  Because of COVID, you should consume less and somehow you should be eating less than
[2:40:48.380 --> 2:40:49.820]  you should be pushed into smaller cities.
[2:40:49.820 --> 2:40:54.180]  Well, they don't want you eating meat because it's been proven that it makes your brain
[2:40:54.180 --> 2:40:55.180]  more healthy.
[2:40:55.180 --> 2:40:56.180]  Make higher IQ.
[2:40:56.180 --> 2:41:00.180]  I mean, that's why Homo sapiens got so powerful is the meat.
[2:41:00.180 --> 2:41:01.180]  The eating meat.
[2:41:01.180 --> 2:41:02.180]  Sure.
[2:41:02.180 --> 2:41:03.180]  Is it cruel?
[2:41:03.180 --> 2:41:04.180]  Is some of it done wrong?
[2:41:04.180 --> 2:41:05.180]  Sorry for the animals.
[2:41:05.180 --> 2:41:06.180]  Sorry.
[2:41:06.180 --> 2:41:07.180]  Yeah.
[2:41:07.180 --> 2:41:08.180]  Sorry.
[2:41:08.180 --> 2:41:09.180]  We are a alpha predator.
[2:41:09.180 --> 2:41:10.180]  You take meat away.
[2:41:10.180 --> 2:41:11.180]  We're little gibbering idiots.
[2:41:11.180 --> 2:41:12.180]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:41:12.180 --> 2:41:17.180]  And if you watch this Industrial Revolution show, like go to YouTube and you say, you know,
[2:41:17.180 --> 2:41:20.060]  what is the fourth Industrial Revolution by the World Economic Forum?
[2:41:20.060 --> 2:41:25.060]  It's a creepy 10 minute video that literally says that, you know, we're, we're, we're
[2:41:25.060 --> 2:41:26.060]  Well, here's the thing.
[2:41:26.060 --> 2:41:27.060]  You get to that.
[2:41:27.060 --> 2:41:31.060]  But like most apes have very low, I'm not saying we're apes, but the things we're in,
[2:41:31.060 --> 2:41:32.060]  they have very low activities.
[2:41:32.060 --> 2:41:35.300]  It's the ones that eat meat that suddenly grow huge craniums and get smart.
[2:41:35.300 --> 2:41:36.300]  Right.
[2:41:36.300 --> 2:41:39.340]  If the meat is the fuels, the fish boils even better than meat.
[2:41:39.340 --> 2:41:40.340]  Yeah.
[2:41:40.340 --> 2:41:42.900]  So we could like literally cut out meat and just eat fish or we'd be even smarter.
[2:41:42.900 --> 2:41:45.700]  But and then you have the fluoride, you know, covering the pineal gland.
[2:41:45.700 --> 2:41:46.700]  Exactly.
[2:41:46.700 --> 2:41:47.700]  Yeah.
[2:41:47.700 --> 2:41:48.700]  Yeah.
[2:41:48.700 --> 2:41:49.700]  No.
[2:41:49.700 --> 2:41:53.380]  And then so, so it says, we're trying to blur the lines between human and machine.
[2:41:53.380 --> 2:41:56.980]  We want to put so much technology in you that you don't know that the machines have
[2:41:56.980 --> 2:42:01.420]  rights that the guild gives it, then you're outvoted, then you're owned, right?
[2:42:01.420 --> 2:42:02.580]  You're owned by something.
[2:42:02.580 --> 2:42:06.080]  And they also say in this creepy fourth Industrial Revolution, so they want to blur the lines
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:07.760]  between human and technology.
[2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:10.580]  They want to go, you're on fire for the next two segments.
[2:42:10.580 --> 2:42:11.780]  I'm going to shut up.
[2:42:11.780 --> 2:42:12.780]  Start over with your whole thing.
[2:42:12.780 --> 2:42:13.780]  Okay.
[2:42:13.780 --> 2:42:14.780]  They want to change it.
[2:42:14.780 --> 2:42:19.140]  They want to change the concept so that they make it that, that change the concept of what
[2:42:19.140 --> 2:42:21.860]  it means to be a human being.
[2:42:21.860 --> 2:42:25.860]  What it means to be a human being is going to be changed by who, by Bill Gates and these
[2:42:25.860 --> 2:42:27.940]  vaccines and these, and these elites, right?
[2:42:27.940 --> 2:42:31.020]  They're going to tell us what it means to be a human being and they're going to make
[2:42:31.020 --> 2:42:35.540]  us so high tech that we're not going to know the difference between human and machine.
[2:42:35.540 --> 2:42:40.220]  Then what they're telling us is because it's so scary to have three thoughts right now,
[2:42:40.220 --> 2:42:43.860]  because it's not very safe to have three, three thoughts, they're going to hijack our
[2:42:43.860 --> 2:42:50.180]  brain, hijack our free thoughts, and then give us a safe space via some sort of a digital,
[2:42:50.180 --> 2:42:54.020]  something they put in us, a digital chip, and they're going to tell us and create this
[2:42:54.020 --> 2:42:57.220]  safe space for us so that we can think creative thoughts and dive in.
[2:42:57.220 --> 2:43:00.260]  They're going to give us the fake interface in front of our consciousness.
[2:43:00.260 --> 2:43:01.260]  Exactly.
[2:43:01.260 --> 2:43:04.460]  And people are so dumb, just like a brave new world, they're going to say, oh, well,
[2:43:04.460 --> 2:43:05.900]  we have free speech.
[2:43:05.900 --> 2:43:06.900]  They're giving us the free speech.
[2:43:06.900 --> 2:43:08.300]  They're giving us a safe space.
[2:43:08.300 --> 2:43:10.380]  Meanwhile, they're monitoring everything.
[2:43:10.380 --> 2:43:14.420]  They're also, a lot of this contact tracing is thought policing.
[2:43:14.420 --> 2:43:19.060]  And it's like what they're trying to do is do the minority report crime prediction as
[2:43:19.060 --> 2:43:20.060]  well.
[2:43:20.060 --> 2:43:21.060]  So they're going to take our DNA.
[2:43:21.060 --> 2:43:24.860]  This is why I refuse to get tested, even if I'm on my deathbed.
[2:43:24.860 --> 2:43:27.900]  They're going to take that DNA and they're going to do something nefarious with all the
[2:43:27.900 --> 2:43:29.500]  contact tracing.
[2:43:29.500 --> 2:43:31.900]  And they even said, again, they say this stuff.
[2:43:31.900 --> 2:43:32.900]  It's not conspiracy.
[2:43:32.900 --> 2:43:33.900]  They say it.
[2:43:33.900 --> 2:43:37.220]  They say, if we now have the right to, because you've been tested, because you are in the
[2:43:37.220 --> 2:43:41.620]  system, we have the right to remove you or your children from your home.
[2:43:41.620 --> 2:43:46.700]  If you have, if you start coughing, if we notice that you have any kind of symptoms whatsoever.
[2:43:46.700 --> 2:43:51.460]  I mean, if that's not literally like child trafficking, like legalized kidnapping, I
[2:43:51.460 --> 2:43:56.020]  don't know what is, but people are so shallow, they refuse to actually see it.
[2:43:56.020 --> 2:44:00.380]  You know, you see like the prime minister of Ireland saying that we have people in venture.
[2:44:00.380 --> 2:44:03.820]  I mean, this is happening in the U.S. This isn't any, anything, you know, just international
[2:44:03.820 --> 2:44:04.820]  anymore.
[2:44:04.820 --> 2:44:07.380]  And this is what's crazy, but this is not in the near future.
[2:44:07.380 --> 2:44:10.500]  It's happening right now, right, Alex?
[2:44:10.500 --> 2:44:15.460]  And notice massive censorship has come in right at the same time to suppress it all,
[2:44:15.460 --> 2:44:16.860]  including medical doctors being censored.
[2:44:16.860 --> 2:44:18.420]  I mean, this is, we're here.
[2:44:18.420 --> 2:44:19.820]  We're not going into Orwellville.
[2:44:19.820 --> 2:44:20.820]  It's here.
[2:44:20.820 --> 2:44:21.820]  It's all about global tyranny.
[2:44:21.820 --> 2:44:23.380]  It's all about global tyranny.
[2:44:23.380 --> 2:44:27.580]  I smelled it from the first time that they announced coronavirus and I knew Trump knew
[2:44:27.580 --> 2:44:28.580]  it too.
[2:44:28.580 --> 2:44:30.300]  I know, I know Trump knows this too.
[2:44:30.300 --> 2:44:33.260]  And I think he's waiting to expose it all at the right time.
[2:44:33.260 --> 2:44:36.660]  But it's, it, I worry that it's going to be too late because these systems were already
[2:44:36.660 --> 2:44:37.660]  being placed.
[2:44:37.660 --> 2:44:42.380]  And then we got, right, we got Bill Gates saying he's going to reimagine the school
[2:44:42.380 --> 2:44:43.380]  system.
[2:44:43.380 --> 2:44:44.380]  Right.
[2:44:44.380 --> 2:44:47.980]  That's like saying, like putting Jeffrey Epstein in charge of re reimagining the adoption
[2:44:47.980 --> 2:44:48.980]  system.
[2:44:48.980 --> 2:44:50.420]  It doesn't work that way.
[2:44:50.420 --> 2:44:52.900]  And people just give their power right to these elites.
[2:44:52.900 --> 2:44:53.900]  It's nuts.
[2:44:53.900 --> 2:44:59.140]  But this, and he always said, it's not that we support the unions or the teachers or any
[2:44:59.140 --> 2:45:00.140]  of that.
[2:45:00.140 --> 2:45:01.140]  They're corrupt.
[2:45:01.140 --> 2:45:02.140]  They're the chumps.
[2:45:02.140 --> 2:45:03.140]  They're all out of education.
[2:45:03.140 --> 2:45:04.140]  So we would not accept it.
[2:45:04.140 --> 2:45:05.140]  So we wouldn't want it.
[2:45:05.140 --> 2:45:06.140]  Exactly.
[2:45:06.140 --> 2:45:07.140]  So they've already destroyed it.
[2:45:07.140 --> 2:45:09.940]  And then Bill Gates says, I want virtual learning 10 years ago.
[2:45:09.940 --> 2:45:10.940]  I've got a plan.
[2:45:10.940 --> 2:45:13.980]  And now here comes COVID and they're all acquiescing to it.
[2:45:13.980 --> 2:45:14.980]  Yeah.
[2:45:14.980 --> 2:45:15.980]  And now paying him and Google for it.
[2:45:15.980 --> 2:45:16.980]  Right.
[2:45:16.980 --> 2:45:19.500]  And they, you know, they act, people act like these plans were just rolled out.
[2:45:19.500 --> 2:45:21.340]  Oh, we just created this plan over the weekend.
[2:45:21.340 --> 2:45:22.340]  Oh my God.
[2:45:22.340 --> 2:45:23.340]  Just because of COVID.
[2:45:23.340 --> 2:45:24.860]  No, these plans have been in place for decades.
[2:45:24.860 --> 2:45:28.820]  That's how I could say eight months ago, they're going to have the vaccine by the fall.
[2:45:28.820 --> 2:45:29.820]  And now they do.
[2:45:29.820 --> 2:45:30.820]  Yeah.
[2:45:30.820 --> 2:45:31.820]  Of course.
[2:45:31.820 --> 2:45:32.820]  It's going to be three years.
[2:45:32.820 --> 2:45:33.820]  No.
[2:45:33.820 --> 2:45:34.820]  I knew from the beginning it wasn't going to be three years.
[2:45:34.820 --> 2:45:35.820]  Come on now.
[2:45:35.820 --> 2:45:37.180]  It's going to be, you know, a couple months fouchy.
[2:45:37.180 --> 2:45:40.900]  They all had this rolled out and people are so dumb and they're going to be lining up
[2:45:40.900 --> 2:45:42.780]  to get this silly vaccine.
[2:45:42.780 --> 2:45:43.780]  I mean, I don't know.
[2:45:43.780 --> 2:45:46.380]  I don't even know if I would want to talk to friends anymore if they literally go.
[2:45:46.380 --> 2:45:48.820]  Well, then they admit, oh, by the way, it doesn't protect you.
[2:45:48.820 --> 2:45:49.820]  So there'll be experiments.
[2:45:49.820 --> 2:45:52.260]  We're going to take up to five a year to see what works.
[2:45:52.260 --> 2:45:53.260]  Yes.
[2:45:53.260 --> 2:45:54.260]  Like, oh, I'm a guinea pig.
[2:45:54.260 --> 2:45:59.420]  You saved me from COVID that kills 25 times less than what they said with the fraudulent
[2:45:59.420 --> 2:46:00.420]  numbers.
[2:46:00.420 --> 2:46:01.420]  Right.
[2:46:01.420 --> 2:46:02.420]  Right.
[2:46:02.420 --> 2:46:05.180]  That once we get a vaccine, guess what all the articles are saying now, you're still
[2:46:05.180 --> 2:46:07.100]  going to have to wear a mask and social distancing.
[2:46:07.100 --> 2:46:10.660]  Oh, don't you think that you're going to get back to know they never give up.
[2:46:10.660 --> 2:46:11.660]  This is their move.
[2:46:11.660 --> 2:46:14.220]  They're never going to give up the power they grab.
[2:46:14.220 --> 2:46:15.220]  Right.
[2:46:15.220 --> 2:46:16.220]  Everyone thinking I'm a hero.
[2:46:16.220 --> 2:46:17.220]  I'm wearing a mask.
[2:46:17.220 --> 2:46:18.220]  You have greased your own.
[2:46:18.220 --> 2:46:21.860]  I mean, they admit the economy is already irrevocably destroyed.
[2:46:21.860 --> 2:46:23.140]  All the blue cities have fallen.
[2:46:23.140 --> 2:46:24.660]  You go, oh, they're idiots.
[2:46:24.660 --> 2:46:25.660]  No.
[2:46:25.660 --> 2:46:29.980]  They're imploding the refugees into the other areas to implode that exactly to then dictate
[2:46:29.980 --> 2:46:32.020]  the capitulation.
[2:46:32.020 --> 2:46:36.860]  And when you see, when you see the DNC this week, it's so creepy and dystopian, you know,
[2:46:36.860 --> 2:46:40.660]  it's depressing to watch these because these are the slaves of this anti-human spirit.
[2:46:40.660 --> 2:46:41.660]  Yeah.
[2:46:41.660 --> 2:46:42.660]  We go, it's easy to beat them.
[2:46:42.660 --> 2:46:45.020]  No, that the enemy has those people.
[2:46:45.020 --> 2:46:46.020]  Right.
[2:46:46.020 --> 2:46:47.020]  You're like, you're like, oh, look, they're weak.
[2:46:47.020 --> 2:46:48.500]  And you think I can beat them.
[2:46:48.500 --> 2:46:49.500]  No.
[2:46:49.500 --> 2:46:51.700]  No, no, that's a zombie force.
[2:46:51.700 --> 2:46:53.060]  That's not a sign of weakness.
[2:46:53.060 --> 2:46:54.660]  That's a sign of power.
[2:46:54.660 --> 2:46:55.660]  It is.
[2:46:55.660 --> 2:47:01.140]  Look at all these zoom digital people superimposed to these rallies last night, quote unquote
[2:47:01.140 --> 2:47:03.300]  rallies and these sports stadiums turns up.
[2:47:03.300 --> 2:47:04.300]  That's fake too.
[2:47:04.300 --> 2:47:05.300]  Oh, yeah.
[2:47:05.300 --> 2:47:10.100]  The future that they're telling because they're afraid to bring real crowds in because we're
[2:47:10.100 --> 2:47:14.020]  going to say Bill Clinton's a rapist, arrest Fauci, arrest Gates.
[2:47:14.020 --> 2:47:15.020]  They know their own people.
[2:47:15.020 --> 2:47:19.740]  Listen, on the awesome police department and all the other.
[2:47:19.740 --> 2:47:21.740]  We all know what's going on because they're, they're humans.
[2:47:21.740 --> 2:47:22.740]  They're, they're against it.
[2:47:22.740 --> 2:47:23.740]  Yeah.
[2:47:23.740 --> 2:47:24.740]  They give us all the intel.
[2:47:24.740 --> 2:47:29.180]  That's why they have to do this and cut everybody off because they know there's a human rebellion
[2:47:29.180 --> 2:47:31.900]  against this unhuman, whatever it is.
[2:47:31.900 --> 2:47:32.900]  They're right.
[2:47:32.900 --> 2:47:37.540]  It was a sleeper product.
[2:47:37.540 --> 2:47:41.860]  It wasn't popular at first, but as people tried it, it's become one of our top five
[2:47:41.860 --> 2:47:42.860]  best sellers.
[2:47:42.860 --> 2:47:48.220]  I'm talking about the eight pack power stack, 13 different pills filled with super nutrients,
[2:47:48.220 --> 2:47:52.700]  vitamins, minerals, and more that you take this morning and one pack and at night.

[2:48:03.260 --> 2:48:04.620]  Now here's the problem.
[2:48:04.620 --> 2:48:09.180]  Some of the patented ingredients that are in a pack power stack because of the shutdown
[2:48:09.180 --> 2:48:12.460]  and the lockdown are not available for us even reorder it.
[2:48:12.460 --> 2:48:16.060]  So this could be the last shipment that we ever have.

[2:48:51.060 --> 2:49:05.060]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked, and threatened because we are effective.
[2:49:05.060 --> 2:49:07.020]  The great awakening is here.
[2:49:07.020 --> 2:49:13.740]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.

[2:49:46.060 --> 2:49:52.100]  Wow.
[2:49:52.100 --> 2:49:56.340]  Yonal Wurrain is on fire and all our guests are on fire but she's really on fire and she's
[2:49:56.340 --> 2:49:57.740]  staying an extra day in Austin.
[2:49:57.740 --> 2:49:59.580]  She'll be out here tomorrow.
[2:49:59.580 --> 2:50:03.380]  12-Dune Barton Springs.
[2:50:03.380 --> 2:50:05.580]  The one downtown so there's not a long hike down there.
[2:50:05.580 --> 2:50:08.500]  They declared a city wide emergency secretly we confirmed.
[2:50:08.500 --> 2:50:11.780]  We tried to stop us swimming in the free part of Barton Springs.
[2:50:11.780 --> 2:50:16.180]  It will be just south of the paid part of Barton Springs by the monkey tree as it's
[2:50:16.180 --> 2:50:17.180]  called.
[2:50:17.180 --> 2:50:18.180]  Tomorrow at noon.
[2:50:18.180 --> 2:50:19.180]  We'll see you there.
[2:50:19.180 --> 2:50:20.180]  Look at these headlines.
[2:50:20.180 --> 2:50:21.180]  Breaking.
[2:50:21.180 --> 2:50:25.900]  Hashtag Netflix pedophilia trends on social media, frontline doctors silenced by YouTube
[2:50:25.900 --> 2:50:32.660]  and Facebook speaks out, that's all up on infowarstore.com right now but you're knocking
[2:50:32.660 --> 2:50:35.740]  out of the park during the breaks about this moment we're at.
[2:50:35.740 --> 2:50:41.340]  They say it's the permanent new thing, mask, force inoculations, contact tracing, social
[2:50:41.340 --> 2:50:45.060]  distancing, apps tracking us, the Chinese social score.
[2:50:45.060 --> 2:50:46.540]  This is their revolution.
[2:50:46.540 --> 2:50:49.020]  They knew we were awake, they were going to launch it later.
[2:50:49.020 --> 2:50:51.060]  We woke up, said no, they launched it early.
[2:50:51.060 --> 2:50:52.860]  I think it's going to go down in flames.
[2:50:52.860 --> 2:50:57.420]  Oh yeah it is and everyone says this is all going to disappear by the election.
[2:50:57.420 --> 2:50:59.260]  No it's not going to just disappear by the election.
[2:50:59.260 --> 2:51:01.060]  That's why Biden said three months at least.
[2:51:01.060 --> 2:51:03.180]  No, their own plan says it never ends.
[2:51:03.180 --> 2:51:07.180]  Yeah, exactly, it never ends and I think it's just going to get worse after the election
[2:51:07.180 --> 2:51:11.020]  and even Biden says if you elect me it's going to be mandatory mask.
[2:51:11.020 --> 2:51:13.100]  That's the future you can look forward to.
[2:51:13.100 --> 2:51:19.180]  And when we see what's happening with the DNC, it's all Zoom digitally imposed people
[2:51:19.180 --> 2:51:20.180]  right?
[2:51:20.180 --> 2:51:22.620]  And fake people, they duplicate them.
[2:51:22.620 --> 2:51:26.420]  And duplicate them, that's the future that they're telling us we can look forward to
[2:51:26.420 --> 2:51:32.380]  is a future where we only see friends and family over Zoom, over Skype, where we only
[2:51:32.380 --> 2:51:33.380]  go to church.
[2:51:33.380 --> 2:51:36.340]  And then in the future AI can impersonate them.
[2:51:36.340 --> 2:51:37.340]  Exactly which is even scarier.
[2:51:37.340 --> 2:51:40.100]  I don't know about you Alex but I don't want a future like that.
[2:51:40.100 --> 2:51:44.100]  I don't want a future where I can only see friends and family, go to church, do my services
[2:51:44.100 --> 2:51:45.180]  over Skype.
[2:51:45.180 --> 2:51:47.860]  That's like a mental prison where you're stuck in the same.
[2:51:47.860 --> 2:51:52.380]  There's these billboards that say church, remote church, it's a thing.
[2:51:52.380 --> 2:51:53.380]  No it's not.
[2:51:53.380 --> 2:51:54.380]  It's BS, it's called prison.
[2:51:54.380 --> 2:51:58.020]  Yeah, it is called prison and every day when you're doing the same thing and you can't
[2:51:58.020 --> 2:52:02.780]  leave your home and the only way you can get any kind of stimulus is over a computer
[2:52:02.780 --> 2:52:03.780]  that's killing you.
[2:52:03.780 --> 2:52:04.780]  And also what are they going to say?
[2:52:04.780 --> 2:52:09.900]  Well, it's forcing you, they know that they're stimulus, their false stimulus cannot compete
[2:52:09.900 --> 2:52:10.900]  with reality.
[2:52:10.900 --> 2:52:11.900]  Right.
[2:52:11.900 --> 2:52:12.900]  Exactly.
[2:52:12.900 --> 2:52:13.900]  And so they want to force us onto that.
[2:52:13.900 --> 2:52:14.900]  Yeah, and I'm an extrovert.
[2:52:14.900 --> 2:52:15.900]  I think a lot of people are.
[2:52:15.900 --> 2:52:17.780]  So you actually need that stimulus.
[2:52:17.780 --> 2:52:19.500]  You need to go see friends and family.
[2:52:19.500 --> 2:52:22.900]  You need to be out in public and changing different environments.
[2:52:22.900 --> 2:52:24.820]  Maybe you want to go to a sports game.
[2:52:24.820 --> 2:52:28.380]  Maybe you want to go to a restaurant or a bar but in the exact same environment every
[2:52:28.380 --> 2:52:31.540]  single day that they're corralling us into, that's literally hell.
[2:52:31.540 --> 2:52:37.220]  And it's all about a test of what can we make you do and then the left loves it.
[2:52:37.220 --> 2:52:38.420]  It's like cute.
[2:52:38.420 --> 2:52:39.420]  It's fun.
[2:52:39.420 --> 2:52:40.420]  I know there's smucks.
[2:52:40.420 --> 2:52:43.500]  How do you tell a leftist, Yana, that you're an idiot?
[2:52:43.500 --> 2:52:45.100]  I mean, you're, you're buying into a fraud.
[2:52:45.100 --> 2:52:46.100]  I try to.
[2:52:46.100 --> 2:52:47.100]  This is what I say.
[2:52:47.100 --> 2:52:50.300]  I say, look, you know, the next time they're going to say, you know, you're going to have
[2:52:50.300 --> 2:52:55.980]  to hop on one foot while wearing a mask, while social distancing from your dog because
[2:52:55.980 --> 2:52:57.740]  of stopping the spread to COVID.
[2:52:57.740 --> 2:52:59.260]  And they're probably going to do it.
[2:52:59.260 --> 2:53:00.940]  Like I wonder, do you have a line?
[2:53:00.940 --> 2:53:01.940]  I mean, where is your line?
[2:53:01.940 --> 2:53:02.940]  They don't have a line.
[2:53:02.940 --> 2:53:03.940]  You know what?
[2:53:03.940 --> 2:53:05.340]  This is the time where I'm going to draw my line.
[2:53:05.340 --> 2:53:08.060]  I don't think they have a line and that's why we are the line.
[2:53:08.060 --> 2:53:09.540]  We Patriots are the line.
[2:53:09.540 --> 2:53:10.540]  Oh, that's a great quote.
[2:53:10.540 --> 2:53:11.540]  We are the line.
[2:53:11.540 --> 2:53:12.540]  We are there.
[2:53:12.540 --> 2:53:13.540]  You are the line.
[2:53:13.540 --> 2:53:14.540]  We are the line.
[2:53:14.540 --> 2:53:15.540]  They have no boundaries.
[2:53:15.540 --> 2:53:16.540]  Info wars.
[2:53:16.540 --> 2:53:17.540]  The line in the sand.
[2:53:17.540 --> 2:53:18.540]  Yes.
[2:53:18.540 --> 2:53:19.540]  Yes.
[2:53:19.540 --> 2:53:23.260]  And the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:53:23.260 --> 2:53:24.420]  Well, I'm impressed.
[2:53:24.420 --> 2:53:26.660]  So we're going to go to break to one more segment.
[2:53:26.660 --> 2:53:31.900]  I got a few clips I want to play, but this is up with, they had all this on the blueprint
[2:53:31.900 --> 2:53:32.900]  to control us.
[2:53:32.900 --> 2:53:33.900]  Oh, yeah.
[2:53:33.900 --> 2:53:36.300]  They never had the nerve to pull it because there's, is it our fault?
[2:53:36.300 --> 2:53:38.300]  We push them into a corner.
[2:53:38.300 --> 2:53:39.300]  They're doing this.
[2:53:39.300 --> 2:53:40.300]  I don't think it's our.
[2:53:40.300 --> 2:53:41.300]  Yeah.
[2:53:41.300 --> 2:53:44.660]  You know, I think we never should have agreed with the original lockdowns back in March.
[2:53:44.660 --> 2:53:46.300]  I don't think we should have agreed with it.
[2:53:46.300 --> 2:53:48.460]  I don't think we should have agreed with the original mass.
[2:53:48.460 --> 2:53:51.460]  I think we should have at that point said, this is sketchy.
[2:53:51.460 --> 2:53:52.460]  No, I agree.
[2:53:52.460 --> 2:53:56.980]  We got, I got one of the few things I got because I was like probably BS, but it's still
[2:53:56.980 --> 2:53:57.980]  super dangerous.
[2:53:57.980 --> 2:53:58.980]  Oh, really?
[2:53:58.980 --> 2:53:59.980]  See, I knew from the beginning.
[2:53:59.980 --> 2:54:00.980]  Well, no, no.
[2:54:00.980 --> 2:54:04.740]  And I said, I didn't trust it, but I still was like, before the lockdown came, I was
[2:54:04.740 --> 2:54:05.740]  against it.
[2:54:05.740 --> 2:54:07.220]  I kind of early on, I wasn't sure.
[2:54:07.220 --> 2:54:09.540]  I think Patriots, I think we kind of failed that test.
[2:54:09.540 --> 2:54:10.540]  I hate to say it.
[2:54:10.540 --> 2:54:14.500]  I think we failed that test and we were tested because we have a social contract.
[2:54:14.500 --> 2:54:15.500]  We want to care about people.
[2:54:15.500 --> 2:54:16.500]  Exactly.
[2:54:16.500 --> 2:54:17.500]  And that's the thing.
[2:54:17.500 --> 2:54:18.500]  You know, we, we, we were trusting.
[2:54:18.500 --> 2:54:19.860]  We were trusting of everything.
[2:54:19.860 --> 2:54:20.860]  And we said, you know what?
[2:54:20.860 --> 2:54:21.860]  Okay.
[2:54:21.860 --> 2:54:23.780]  We'll do it this once, even though it's against our greater instinct, we're going to do it
[2:54:23.780 --> 2:54:24.780]  this one.
[2:54:24.780 --> 2:54:25.780]  And I wore the social.
[2:54:25.780 --> 2:54:26.780]  I wore the noodles.
[2:54:26.780 --> 2:54:27.780]  Oh, the noodles.
[2:54:27.780 --> 2:54:28.780]  Yeah.
[2:54:28.780 --> 2:54:31.220]  So now they have cardboard cutouts, right?
[2:54:31.220 --> 2:54:35.100]  They have cardboard cutouts and blow up dolls at restaurants and bars to fill in the empty
[2:54:35.100 --> 2:54:36.100]  seats.
[2:54:36.100 --> 2:54:37.100]  Come on.
[2:54:37.100 --> 2:54:39.100]  I don't want to look at a cardboard cutout when I'm out to dinner.
[2:54:39.100 --> 2:54:40.100]  The laughs is a cult.
[2:54:40.100 --> 2:54:41.100]  They're a disgusting cult of idiots.
[2:54:41.100 --> 2:54:42.100]  A cult of idiots.
[2:54:42.100 --> 2:54:43.100]  Last Saturday, we made a splash.
[2:54:43.100 --> 2:54:44.100]  So this Saturday, we're doing it again.
[2:54:44.100 --> 2:55:01.660]  At 12 noon on August 22nd, swimming with Alex Jones will commence again at Barton Springs
[2:55:01.660 --> 2:55:10.420]  on the free side, right here in Boston, Texas, and this time we'll have food.
[2:55:10.420 --> 2:55:11.420]  That's right.
[2:55:11.420 --> 2:55:12.420]  We're bringing food.
[2:55:12.420 --> 2:55:13.420]  I'm going to pay for a professional food truck.
[2:55:13.420 --> 2:55:14.420]  Yeah.
[2:55:14.420 --> 2:55:25.420]  Come out and show your resistance to the ridiculous orders against enjoying the beautiful green
[2:55:25.420 --> 2:55:32.140]  with Alex Jones this Saturday at 12 noon at Barton Springs.
[2:55:32.140 --> 2:55:33.140]  See you there.
[2:55:33.140 --> 2:55:59.540]  I remember when I remember, I remember when I lost my mind, there was something so pleasant
[2:55:59.540 --> 2:56:00.540]  about that place.
[2:56:00.540 --> 2:56:03.540]  And we can talk about it so later.
[2:56:03.540 --> 2:56:04.540]  Oh, yeah.
[2:56:04.540 --> 2:56:10.020]  She is going to be co-hosting the war room with Ellen Schreuer, and we're going to cover
[2:56:10.020 --> 2:56:18.380]  the highlights of last night's DNC that was beyond paint drying, Pocahontas, Biden, all
[2:56:18.380 --> 2:56:19.380]  of it.
[2:56:19.380 --> 2:56:23.220]  It's coming up, but tomorrow she's going to be down there with us.
[2:56:23.220 --> 2:56:33.820]  It was closed, it's open to the public, now they're trying to close it again because we're
[2:56:33.820 --> 2:56:36.620]  coming, they're calling it a citywide emergency.
[2:56:36.620 --> 2:56:40.740]  Imagine the thought crowd of people swimming in the natural springs there.
[2:56:40.740 --> 2:56:41.740]  It's beautiful.
[2:56:41.740 --> 2:56:42.740]  This is a big event now.
[2:56:42.740 --> 2:56:43.740]  Right.
[2:56:43.740 --> 2:56:48.380]  Tell everybody, you know, it's a peaceful showdown against the control freaks, the mind controllers
[2:56:48.380 --> 2:56:53.540]  tomorrow, swimming with Alex Jones, 2.0, Barton Springs edition.
[2:56:53.540 --> 2:56:55.780]  You might just get me to be in a bikini tomorrow.
[2:56:55.780 --> 2:56:57.900]  I haven't been in a bikini since like February.
[2:56:57.900 --> 2:56:58.900]  Oh, I'm definitely going.
[2:56:58.900 --> 2:57:03.180]  You know, I'm gay, but I still, you know, would like to see in a bikini.
[2:57:03.180 --> 2:57:04.180]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:57:04.180 --> 2:57:05.180]  So some people might...
[2:57:05.180 --> 2:57:08.980]  If I were at death camps in China, it'd be okay once I'm gay, you know, like, it's okay
[2:57:08.980 --> 2:57:10.500]  because Tim Cook's gay.
[2:57:10.500 --> 2:57:11.500]  Right.
[2:57:11.500 --> 2:57:12.500]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:57:12.500 --> 2:57:13.500]  And Tim Cook's gay.
[2:57:13.500 --> 2:57:15.980]  You know, I'll be screaming, we'll be screaming with our megaphone and everything.
[2:57:15.980 --> 2:57:19.260]  We'll call it a peaceful BLM protest just so that nobody shows it.
[2:57:19.260 --> 2:57:20.260]  Well, exactly.
[2:57:20.260 --> 2:57:21.260]  Tom, see me probably go BLM.
[2:57:21.260 --> 2:57:22.260]  Make sure you're burning stuff.
[2:57:22.260 --> 2:57:23.260]  I don't want to.
[2:57:23.260 --> 2:57:24.260]  Okay, great.
[2:57:24.260 --> 2:57:25.260]  Burn.
[2:57:25.260 --> 2:57:26.260]  Like flame throwers out BLM.
[2:57:26.260 --> 2:57:27.260]  Right, right.
[2:57:27.260 --> 2:57:28.260]  Burn a police car.
[2:57:28.260 --> 2:57:32.700]  See, I mean, I think Trump would be such a boss if he just threw a regular size rally
[2:57:32.700 --> 2:57:33.700]  as he normally does.
[2:57:33.700 --> 2:57:34.700]  And called it a BLM.
[2:57:34.700 --> 2:57:35.700]  BLM rally.
[2:57:35.700 --> 2:57:36.700]  It'd be amazing.
[2:57:36.700 --> 2:57:37.700]  He says, hey, I actually think Black Lives Matter.
[2:57:37.700 --> 2:57:38.700]  Everybody does.
[2:57:38.700 --> 2:57:39.700]  Time to the event.
[2:57:39.700 --> 2:57:40.700]  They couldn't stop him.
[2:57:40.700 --> 2:57:41.700]  Exactly.
[2:57:41.700 --> 2:57:42.700]  And then we got all our...
[2:57:42.700 --> 2:57:43.700]  Oh my God.
[2:57:43.700 --> 2:57:44.700]  Trump should throw a Black Lives Matter.
[2:57:44.700 --> 2:57:45.700]  You're a genius.
[2:57:45.700 --> 2:57:46.700]  Yeah, immediately.
[2:57:46.700 --> 2:57:47.700]  Yes, immediately.
[2:57:47.700 --> 2:57:48.700]  And he would...
[2:57:48.700 --> 2:57:49.700]  They couldn't say anything.
[2:57:49.700 --> 2:57:53.380]  Because the media members said like, oh, Black Lives Matter lowered COVID, but Trump caused
[2:57:53.380 --> 2:57:54.700]  the nationwide deal with this.
[2:57:54.700 --> 2:57:55.700]  Yes.
[2:57:55.700 --> 2:57:56.700]  With this.
[2:57:56.700 --> 2:58:00.260]  This is how he could tie in BLM with his rally and with COVID all in the same thing.
[2:58:00.260 --> 2:58:01.260]  What if I wear a bikini?
[2:58:01.260 --> 2:58:02.260]  I would love it.
[2:58:02.260 --> 2:58:03.260]  Why don't you wear a bikini?
[2:58:03.260 --> 2:58:05.780]  Why don't you wear a MAGA bikini?
[2:58:05.780 --> 2:58:06.780]  And we'll both.
[2:58:06.780 --> 2:58:07.780]  And we could do like, who wore it better?
[2:58:07.780 --> 2:58:08.780]  You know, we can make a con.
[2:58:08.780 --> 2:58:09.780]  We could do a...
[2:58:09.780 --> 2:58:10.780]  Well, obviously I'm going to wear it better.
[2:58:10.780 --> 2:58:11.780]  Obviously.
[2:58:11.780 --> 2:58:12.780]  You're going to get more votes.
[2:58:12.780 --> 2:58:13.780]  Trump should wear a bikini.
[2:58:13.780 --> 2:58:14.780]  Oh my God.
[2:58:14.780 --> 2:58:15.780]  That's great.
[2:58:15.780 --> 2:58:16.780]  And I got to work out.
[2:58:16.780 --> 2:58:17.780]  What if Trump wore a bikini?
[2:58:17.780 --> 2:58:18.780]  I would love that.
[2:58:18.780 --> 2:58:19.780]  I think he should.
[2:58:19.780 --> 2:58:21.780]  I think it should be me, you, and Trump on the catwalk.
[2:58:21.780 --> 2:58:23.780]  And we'll see who wears it best.
[2:58:23.780 --> 2:58:24.780]  I don't know.
[2:58:24.780 --> 2:58:25.780]  I'm going to win that one.
[2:58:25.780 --> 2:58:26.780]  I haven't been...
[2:58:26.780 --> 2:58:27.780]  I predict I would win.
[2:58:27.780 --> 2:58:28.780]  Okay.
[2:58:28.780 --> 2:58:29.780]  I'll predict I'm going to win.
[2:58:29.780 --> 2:58:31.620]  Oh, maybe Trump is going to win.
[2:58:31.620 --> 2:58:32.620]  I think you would win.
[2:58:32.620 --> 2:58:36.460]  But because I haven't been to a gym in a year, I haven't gotten my nails done since February.
[2:58:36.460 --> 2:58:37.460]  Deanna, that's not...
[2:58:37.460 --> 2:58:39.460]  Obviously you will win the bikini.
[2:58:39.460 --> 2:58:40.460]  No, no.
[2:58:40.460 --> 2:58:41.460]  I do wear a bikini regularly.
[2:58:41.460 --> 2:58:42.460]  It's not on there.
[2:58:42.460 --> 2:58:43.860]  If I don't win, I'm going to go jump off the couch.
[2:58:43.860 --> 2:58:45.340]  I'm actually wearing a bikini right now.
[2:58:45.340 --> 2:58:46.340]  I noticed that.
[2:58:46.340 --> 2:58:49.380]  I thought I noticed that there was like an outline of a bikini, you know, under your
[2:58:49.380 --> 2:58:50.380]  suit.
[2:58:50.380 --> 2:58:52.220]  And I said, well, that must be like his power suit that he does.
[2:58:52.220 --> 2:58:53.220]  He walks to work every day.
[2:58:53.220 --> 2:58:54.220]  Should I show her by?
[2:58:54.220 --> 2:58:55.220]  I think you should.
[2:58:55.220 --> 2:58:56.220]  It's frisky.
[2:58:56.220 --> 2:58:57.220]  All right.
[2:58:57.220 --> 2:58:58.220]  I don't normally take my own clothes off.
[2:58:58.220 --> 2:58:59.220]  It's fired up Fridays here.
[2:58:59.220 --> 2:59:01.220]  Does that see the bikini line?
[2:59:01.220 --> 2:59:02.220]  Oh, wow.
[2:59:02.220 --> 2:59:03.220]  See that right there?
[2:59:03.220 --> 2:59:04.220]  Great.
[2:59:04.220 --> 2:59:05.220]  That's great.
[2:59:05.220 --> 2:59:06.220]  That's what it is.
[2:59:06.220 --> 2:59:07.220]  Look at this.
[2:59:07.220 --> 2:59:08.220]  I would do the same, too.
[2:59:08.220 --> 2:59:09.220]  But I just waxed my chest, though.
[2:59:09.220 --> 2:59:10.720]  I waxed mine, too.
[2:59:10.720 --> 2:59:11.720]  That is great.
[2:59:11.720 --> 2:59:12.720]  See?
[2:59:12.720 --> 2:59:14.260]  I'm going to make you win.
[2:59:14.260 --> 2:59:15.260]  And then I'm going to have to do it.
[2:59:15.260 --> 2:59:16.260]  You can see that I waxed it.
[2:59:16.260 --> 2:59:17.260]  She was no hair.
[2:59:17.260 --> 2:59:20.540]  That is definitely a frisky Friday type of thing to do today.
[2:59:20.540 --> 2:59:21.540]  That's right.
[2:59:21.540 --> 2:59:23.380]  Well, you can tell that there's lots of, I waxed.
[2:59:23.380 --> 2:59:24.380]  There's no hair.
[2:59:24.380 --> 2:59:25.380]  Talk about gaslight.
[2:59:25.380 --> 2:59:26.380]  It's totally hairy.
[2:59:26.380 --> 2:59:28.740]  I don't know, but this is how we gaslight the public.
[2:59:28.740 --> 2:59:31.980]  See, if that were the, that was not hair, they would say, no hair.
[2:59:31.980 --> 2:59:32.980]  This is not hair.
[2:59:32.980 --> 2:59:33.980]  This is not hair.
[2:59:33.980 --> 2:59:34.980]  This is no hair.
[2:59:34.980 --> 2:59:35.980]  Biden does not have cognitive problems.
[2:59:35.980 --> 2:59:36.980]  Yeah.
[2:59:36.980 --> 2:59:37.980]  Antifa does not exist.
[2:59:37.980 --> 2:59:38.980]  It's a myth.
[2:59:38.980 --> 2:59:40.620]  I do not have hair on my chest.
[2:59:40.620 --> 2:59:42.420]  And Big Mike is a woman.
[2:59:42.420 --> 2:59:45.380]  Big Mike does not have a roll of silver dollars in her pants.
[2:59:45.380 --> 2:59:48.980]  And they say it enough times and everyone believes that just like rules for wrap.
[2:59:48.980 --> 2:59:50.580]  What is up with Big Mike?
[2:59:50.580 --> 2:59:55.300]  I think Big Mike, you know, I think, I don't know if it's just a prank on us that like,
[2:59:55.300 --> 2:59:59.300]  or maybe it's sort of a weird fetish that he and, and who's saying play where they're
[2:59:59.300 --> 3:00:03.140]  like, Oh, you know, put a little snake in your pants and it kind of turns me on, you
[3:00:03.140 --> 3:00:04.140]  know, every couple of days.
[3:00:04.140 --> 3:00:05.140]  Look at that photo.
[3:00:05.140 --> 3:00:06.140]  That doesn't look like a man.
[3:00:06.140 --> 3:00:07.140]  Put it back up there.
[3:00:07.140 --> 3:00:09.500]  That's a beautiful woman right there.
[3:00:09.500 --> 3:00:10.500]  That's a beautiful.
[3:00:10.500 --> 3:00:12.940]  That's a heavyweight champion of the world.
[3:00:12.940 --> 3:00:14.940]  That's a huge bitch.
[3:00:14.940 --> 3:00:17.460]  No, I, you know what?
[3:00:17.460 --> 3:00:21.340]  I don't know for sure, but there's, but look, look, even adjusted, slow that down.
[3:00:21.340 --> 3:00:22.340]  Adjusted it.
[3:00:22.340 --> 3:00:23.340]  Don't watch this.
[3:00:23.340 --> 3:00:24.340]  I mean, you're talking about Joan, right?
[3:00:24.340 --> 3:00:26.340]  Ain't wearing underwear, dangling around.
[3:00:26.340 --> 3:00:27.340]  Right.
[3:00:27.340 --> 3:00:28.340]  That is a dangler right there.
[3:00:28.340 --> 3:00:29.340]  And, you know, it's an impressive.
[3:00:29.340 --> 3:00:30.340]  I'm not trying to be gross.
[3:00:30.340 --> 3:00:32.220]  I was about to say like that's eight inches flaster.
[3:00:32.220 --> 3:00:33.220]  That's like a foot and a half long.
[3:00:33.220 --> 3:00:34.220]  Oh yeah.
[3:00:34.220 --> 3:00:35.220]  That's impressive.
[3:00:35.220 --> 3:00:36.540]  That's probably like a world record size.
[3:00:36.540 --> 3:00:37.540]  That's an anaconda.
[3:00:37.540 --> 3:00:41.700]  That's something that a lot of, a lot of guys would be jealous of, I think.
[3:00:41.700 --> 3:00:47.420]  And then we have, you know, Joan Rivers, just a few days later after that, what happened?
[3:00:47.420 --> 3:00:50.100]  Hey, maybe her name should be Ataconda Mike.
[3:00:50.100 --> 3:00:51.100]  I think so.
[3:00:51.100 --> 3:00:54.220]  I think Anaconda Mike, you know, let's change that name.
[3:00:54.220 --> 3:00:57.420]  I got censored on my nicknames like a rattlesnake Mike.
[3:00:57.420 --> 3:00:58.580]  Let's see.
[3:00:58.580 --> 3:00:59.580]  You got it.
[3:00:59.580 --> 3:01:00.580]  You got.
[3:01:00.580 --> 3:01:01.580]  Oh my God.
[3:01:01.580 --> 3:01:02.580]  It's true.
[3:01:02.580 --> 3:01:03.580]  Ataconda Mike.
[3:01:03.580 --> 3:01:04.580]  Anaconda Mike.
[3:01:04.580 --> 3:01:05.580]  I think we're going to do it.
[3:01:05.580 --> 3:01:08.100]  Let's go over to Mike or, all right, stop it.
[3:01:08.100 --> 3:01:09.540]  This is not family show.
[3:01:09.540 --> 3:01:10.540]  It's fired up.
[3:01:10.540 --> 3:01:11.540]  Stop it right now.
[3:01:11.540 --> 3:01:12.540]  It's fiery Friday.
[3:01:12.540 --> 3:01:13.540]  Fiery Friday.
[3:01:13.540 --> 3:01:15.020]  You don't talk about Big Mike.
[3:01:15.020 --> 3:01:16.020]  Look at that.
[3:01:16.020 --> 3:01:17.020]  Look at that.
[3:01:17.020 --> 3:01:18.020]  That is.
[3:01:18.020 --> 3:01:19.020]  The shoulders and the, the, the chin.
[3:01:19.020 --> 3:01:20.020]  I play that.
[3:01:20.020 --> 3:01:22.700]  I think they play dress up and, and Hussein throws on a wig.
[3:01:22.700 --> 3:01:23.700]  She puts a snake in the pants.
[3:01:23.700 --> 3:01:25.860]  Oh, you know, you know, he's catching those bitches.
[3:01:25.860 --> 3:01:26.860]  Oh yeah.
[3:01:26.860 --> 3:01:27.860]  He's catching.
[3:01:27.860 --> 3:01:28.860]  He's catching.
[3:01:28.860 --> 3:01:29.860]  From Iron Mike.
[3:01:29.860 --> 3:01:30.860]  This is happening right now.
[3:01:30.860 --> 3:01:31.860]  And I think Bill Gates does too.
[3:01:31.860 --> 3:01:35.340]  You know him and his pink sweaters and his wife looks quite manly.
[3:01:35.340 --> 3:01:38.540]  I think there's something going on with the, the elite where they do this sort of sigh
[3:01:38.540 --> 3:01:41.340]  off on us with the very people that they're married to.
[3:01:41.340 --> 3:01:42.340]  What do you think?
[3:01:42.340 --> 3:01:43.340]  Is that going too far?
[3:01:43.340 --> 3:01:47.020]  Word is actually that Bill Gates is, is actually a woman.
[3:01:47.020 --> 3:01:48.020]  Yeah.
[3:01:48.020 --> 3:01:50.540]  I think he's a, a pitcher or a catcher too.
[3:01:50.540 --> 3:01:54.060]  I don't know who he is, but he's certainly not who he presents himself to be.
[3:01:54.060 --> 3:01:57.940]  That's like saying that George Soros is a humanitarian.
[3:01:57.940 --> 3:02:01.540]  Can we play the clip of Joan Rivers talking about Iron Mike, Big Mike?
[3:02:01.540 --> 3:02:02.540]  Yes.
[3:02:02.540 --> 3:02:03.540]  Go ahead and get that clip ready.
[3:02:03.540 --> 3:02:08.420]  Here is Joan Rivers, right before she died talking about Ataconda Mike.
[3:02:08.420 --> 3:02:09.420]  Here it is.
[3:02:09.420 --> 3:02:10.420]  My Anaconda.
[3:02:10.420 --> 3:02:12.660]  Mr. Rivers, how are you?
[3:02:12.660 --> 3:02:15.700]  You made, you made a ton of news officiating the wedding in New York yesterday.
[3:02:15.700 --> 3:02:18.940]  Is this like a, is this like a new cottage career move for you?
[3:02:18.940 --> 3:02:19.940]  I am so excited.
[3:02:19.940 --> 3:02:20.940]  Okay.
[3:02:20.940 --> 3:02:22.660]  And I should do very well because I don't show it.
[3:02:22.660 --> 3:02:25.060]  And do you think that the country will see the first, the United States will see the
[3:02:25.060 --> 3:02:27.060]  first gay president or the first woman president?
[3:02:27.060 --> 3:02:28.700]  We already have it with Obama.
[3:02:28.700 --> 3:02:30.900]  So let's just calm down.
[3:02:30.900 --> 3:02:31.900]  Got it.
[3:02:31.900 --> 3:02:35.620]  You know, Michelle is a trans.
[3:02:35.620 --> 3:02:36.620]  I'm sorry.
[3:02:36.620 --> 3:02:37.620]  She's a what?
[3:02:37.620 --> 3:02:38.620]  A transgender.
[3:02:38.620 --> 3:02:39.620]  We all know.
[3:02:39.620 --> 3:02:40.620]  Oh my gosh.
[3:02:40.620 --> 3:02:41.620]  Oh gosh.
[3:02:41.620 --> 3:02:42.620]  It's okay.
[3:02:42.620 --> 3:02:43.620]  It's okay.
[3:02:43.620 --> 3:02:44.620]  It's okay.
[3:02:44.620 --> 3:02:45.620]  It's okay.
[3:02:45.620 --> 3:02:46.620]  It's okay.
[3:02:46.620 --> 3:02:47.620]  It's okay.
[3:02:47.620 --> 3:02:48.620]  It's okay.
[3:02:48.620 --> 3:02:49.620]  It's okay.
[3:02:49.620 --> 3:02:50.620]  It's okay.
[3:02:50.620 --> 3:02:51.620]  I mean.
[3:02:51.620 --> 3:02:52.620]  It's okay.
[3:02:52.620 --> 3:02:53.620]  Who says that?
[3:02:53.620 --> 3:02:54.620]  She said it was so casual.
[3:02:54.620 --> 3:02:57.260]  Like it's just, oh yeah, it's just common knowledge.
[3:02:57.260 --> 3:02:58.260]  Everyone knows.
[3:02:58.260 --> 3:03:02.460]  You know, LeVon Robinson, right, isn't that the name, isn't that the real name?
[3:03:02.460 --> 3:03:05.780]  Well, let's just say she's the Louisville slugger of First Ladies.
[3:03:05.780 --> 3:03:06.780]  Oh yeah.
[3:03:06.780 --> 3:03:07.780]  But, but guess what?
[3:03:07.780 --> 3:03:11.220]  That the whole transgender agenda that they're putting, pushing fast and fierce.
[3:03:11.220 --> 3:03:12.220]  Yeah.
[3:03:12.220 --> 3:03:13.220]  Why are they?
[3:03:13.220 --> 3:03:16.300]  I have an article where they're like, this child, this is an adult show, folks, but this
[3:03:16.300 --> 3:03:17.740]  is what kids are being taught.
[3:03:17.740 --> 3:03:18.740]  Right.
[3:03:18.740 --> 3:03:22.500]  This eight year old is a top and then it shows, that means like, you know, the guy pitching
[3:03:22.500 --> 3:03:26.980]  and then it shows the weird dude and clown makeup leading a kid into some sex dungeon.
[3:03:26.980 --> 3:03:27.980]  Oh my gosh.
[3:03:27.980 --> 3:03:28.980]  They're out in the open.
[3:03:28.980 --> 3:03:29.980]  They're out in the open.
[3:03:29.980 --> 3:03:30.980]  All right.
[3:03:30.980 --> 3:03:34.180]  And they, you know, they have, for their reading, which, oh my God, that is disturbing.
[3:03:34.180 --> 3:03:35.180]  Wow.
[3:03:35.180 --> 3:03:41.020]  And their reading material for kindergarteners is my princess boy and, and talking my fair
[3:03:41.020 --> 3:03:44.500]  lady and, you know, sex is a funny word.
[3:03:44.500 --> 3:03:48.300]  Because they know men might stand up to what they're doing, but they're worried about men.
[3:03:48.300 --> 3:03:49.300]  Exactly.
[3:03:49.300 --> 3:03:53.260]  And they're, and this is all the feminizing of men, the dehumanizing of people, attacking
[3:03:53.260 --> 3:03:55.740]  the family unit, just breaking up the family unit.
[3:03:55.740 --> 3:04:00.340]  And they want men to turn into women because this is more of a problem, by the way, of
[3:04:00.340 --> 3:04:01.340]  men turning into women.
[3:04:01.340 --> 3:04:04.220]  That's more, uh, that's more prevalent on the man side.
[3:04:04.220 --> 3:04:07.580]  And by the time a kid is eight years old, all of a sudden they're questioning their identity.
[3:04:07.580 --> 3:04:09.220]  They're questioning their gender.
[3:04:09.220 --> 3:04:10.220]  This is not normal.
[3:04:10.220 --> 3:04:11.220]  They're even instructing.
[3:04:11.220 --> 3:04:12.220]  This is sexual abuse.
[3:04:12.220 --> 3:04:14.220]  This is perverts messing with your kids.
[3:04:14.220 --> 3:04:15.220]  It is.
[3:04:15.220 --> 3:04:18.340]  And they're instructing kids to play doctor on each other, you know, and sex ed class
[3:04:18.340 --> 3:04:19.340]  and everything.
[3:04:19.340 --> 3:04:20.340]  Come on.
[3:04:20.340 --> 3:04:21.940]  It's just like men and goblin outfits.
[3:04:21.940 --> 3:04:22.940]  Goblins.
[3:04:22.940 --> 3:04:23.940]  Yes.
[3:04:23.940 --> 3:04:26.060]  I, the drag queen story hour.
[3:04:26.060 --> 3:04:29.780]  But then again, at this point, Alex, I blame the parents because if you're a parent and
[3:04:29.780 --> 3:04:34.620]  you're not viciously overseeing what's being taught in the schools and what's being handed
[3:04:34.620 --> 3:04:35.860]  over to your kids, you're right.
[3:04:35.860 --> 3:04:40.220]  We have acquiesced to goblin creatures having access to our children.
[3:04:40.220 --> 3:04:44.340]  Goblins are sleeping with children at this point and they're reading story time to them.
[3:04:44.340 --> 3:04:46.860]  And at this point, the parents are complicit.
[3:04:46.860 --> 3:04:48.500]  It's time for parents to stand up.
[3:04:48.500 --> 3:04:52.780]  Why aren't parents mass protesting that Trump should come out against pedophile story time?
[3:04:52.780 --> 3:04:53.780]  He really should.
[3:04:53.780 --> 3:04:56.420]  I mean, I think he maybe has a little bit, but like, this is creepy.
[3:04:56.420 --> 3:04:59.700]  Could you imagine putting your son or your, your three year old?
[3:04:59.700 --> 3:05:02.500]  I couldn't imagine making you sit on those guys' laps or me.
[3:05:02.500 --> 3:05:03.500]  Right.
[3:05:03.500 --> 3:05:04.500]  Could you imagine?
[3:05:04.500 --> 3:05:06.220]  He's like, what do you want for Christmas, little girl?
[3:05:06.220 --> 3:05:07.700]  And he's got a huge beard and everything.
[3:05:07.700 --> 3:05:10.420]  And he's like, well, no, they also, in some of the videos, I mean, I want to, they have
[3:05:10.420 --> 3:05:11.420]  hard onks.
[3:05:11.420 --> 3:05:12.420]  No.
[3:05:12.420 --> 3:05:13.420]  Oh my God.
[3:05:13.420 --> 3:05:15.420]  In some of the videos, they're not wearing pants.
[3:05:15.420 --> 3:05:16.420]  They have glitter on it.
[3:05:16.420 --> 3:05:17.420]  Oh.
[3:05:17.420 --> 3:05:19.420]  Here in Austin, like dudes are humping little girls.
[3:05:19.420 --> 3:05:20.420]  Oh man.
[3:05:20.420 --> 3:05:21.940]  See, I mean, you know it too.
[3:05:21.940 --> 3:05:24.660]  And then you look into their history and it turns out they're like a four-time pedophile.
[3:05:24.660 --> 3:05:25.660]  Yeah, of course.
[3:05:25.660 --> 3:05:26.660]  A mass offender.
[3:05:26.660 --> 3:05:27.660]  Well, what are these people?
[3:05:27.660 --> 3:05:29.940]  And guess who sponsors the Drag Queen Story Hour is Michelle Obama.
[3:05:29.940 --> 3:05:33.500]  But look at that nice young lady there, leading the small child in.
[3:05:33.500 --> 3:05:37.340]  And they say in the video that they're leading that child to have sex with somebody.
[3:05:37.340 --> 3:05:40.940]  The agenda of sexualizing children is well underway, but...
[3:05:40.940 --> 3:05:43.980]  Burn in hell, Satanist, burn in hell.
[3:05:43.980 --> 3:05:45.580]  It was a sleeper product.
[3:05:45.580 --> 3:05:50.140]  It wasn't popular at first, but as people pride it, it's become one of our top five best
[3:05:50.140 --> 3:05:51.140]  sellers.
[3:05:51.140 --> 3:05:53.140]  Let's talk about the eight pack power stack.

[3:06:11.260 --> 3:06:12.660]  Now here's the problem.
[3:06:12.660 --> 3:06:17.220]  Some of the patented ingredients that are in eight pack power stack because of the shutdown
[3:06:17.220 --> 3:06:20.540]  and the lockdown are not available for us to even reorder it.
[3:06:20.540 --> 3:06:24.100]  So this could be the last shipment that we ever have.

[3:06:46.300 --> 3:06:52.820]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:06:52.820 --> 3:07:08.740]  All right, it's my final prelude as I leave us, but I tell you that tomorrow, 12 noon
[3:07:08.740 --> 3:07:14.020]  Barton Springs downtown, south side of it, the free side will be there.
[3:07:14.020 --> 3:07:19.820]  It's called the monkey tree and they called a secret city wide emergency that we're trying
[3:07:19.820 --> 3:07:23.460]  to go down there unauthorized, even though we forced them to open the parks up.
[3:07:23.460 --> 3:07:28.540]  That's how dystopian and insane this has gotten and yeah, I said, hey, thanks for coming down
[3:07:28.540 --> 3:07:31.660]  everybody last weekend at another area of the park was hard to get to.
[3:07:31.660 --> 3:07:34.860]  This is very easy to assess and access.
[3:07:34.860 --> 3:07:37.580]  I said, I'm going to get you P Terry's hamburgers.
[3:07:37.580 --> 3:07:38.580]  Well, they were scared.
[3:07:38.580 --> 3:07:39.740]  Somebody else is bringing food.
[3:07:39.740 --> 3:07:43.060]  I'm paying for 500 people get a sandwich to drink.
[3:07:43.060 --> 3:07:44.860]  So whatever it's all fun.
[3:07:44.860 --> 3:07:48.420]  And so it's it's it's pissing the face of the globalists and us eating food together,
[3:07:48.420 --> 3:07:52.860]  having a fun time in the spring water that comes out at 70 degrees right out of the rocks
[3:07:52.860 --> 3:07:53.860]  tomorrow.
[3:07:53.860 --> 3:07:54.860]  12 noon.
[3:07:54.860 --> 3:07:55.860]  You'll be there.
[3:07:55.860 --> 3:07:56.860]  I'll be there.
[3:07:56.860 --> 3:07:57.860]  I'll be there in my onesie.
[3:07:57.860 --> 3:07:58.860]  All right.
[3:07:58.860 --> 3:07:59.860]  Yes.
[3:07:59.860 --> 3:08:00.860]  I'll be in the onesie as well.
[3:08:00.860 --> 3:08:01.860]  Okay, great.
[3:08:01.860 --> 3:08:02.860]  We'll have matching onesies matching info wars onesie.
[3:08:02.860 --> 3:08:03.860]  That's a little onesie I wear.
[3:08:03.860 --> 3:08:04.860]  It's like a little caveman onesie.
[3:08:04.860 --> 3:08:08.980]  You should get you should get info wars onesie single it yet for male and for women.
[3:08:08.980 --> 3:08:09.980]  That's what I'll do.
[3:08:09.980 --> 3:08:10.980]  I'll get it.
[3:08:10.980 --> 3:08:15.140]  Nick Baggage, Deanna Lorraine, hi, Nick, you're going to be on the war room with Owen
[3:08:15.140 --> 3:08:17.420]  Schreuer going through the DNC train wreck.
[3:08:17.420 --> 3:08:18.420]  Oh, yeah.
[3:08:18.420 --> 3:08:19.900]  Coming up in just about 45 minutes.
[3:08:19.900 --> 3:08:20.900]  Yep.
[3:08:20.900 --> 3:08:21.900]  Yep.
[3:08:21.900 --> 3:08:22.900]  It'll be a clown show.
[3:08:22.900 --> 3:08:26.660]  And if you watched any of it last night, you will see what an absolute disaster of
[3:08:26.660 --> 3:08:29.780]  a clown show is and who's driving the clown show.
[3:08:29.780 --> 3:08:30.780]  It's not Joe Biden.
[3:08:30.780 --> 3:08:32.380]  It is not Michelle Obama.
[3:08:32.380 --> 3:08:36.500]  Who do you think is really driving this clown show is it George Soros?
[3:08:36.500 --> 3:08:37.500]  Is it above him?
[3:08:37.500 --> 3:08:38.500]  Right?
[3:08:38.500 --> 3:08:39.500]  I mean, I think it's an off world.
[3:08:39.500 --> 3:08:40.500]  I'll be serious.
[3:08:40.500 --> 3:08:41.500]  Yeah, everything.
[3:08:41.500 --> 3:08:45.100]  I don't get into flying saucers and all that stuff esoterically.
[3:08:45.100 --> 3:08:49.500]  Just as a scientist, as a researcher, the whole thing's anti human to suppress human
[3:08:49.500 --> 3:08:55.460]  potential, turn us against each other and stop us going, um, type one civilization.
[3:08:55.460 --> 3:08:59.980]  Let's ask one of the major trailblazers because there's a few people like David Isaac trailblazer
[3:08:59.980 --> 3:09:00.980]  of esoteric.
[3:09:00.980 --> 3:09:05.620]  But around the same time he emerged, Dr. Nick Baggage, his dad was a famous congressman,
[3:09:05.620 --> 3:09:06.620]  brother, a senator.
[3:09:06.620 --> 3:09:12.900]  I think he's the most influential, the trio, garlic, baggage, exposed harp, the cell towers,
[3:09:12.900 --> 3:09:14.820]  all of it with science.
[3:09:14.820 --> 3:09:15.820]  Let's ask that question.
[3:09:15.820 --> 3:09:16.820]  Let him take over.
[3:09:16.820 --> 3:09:17.820]  He's got his own agenda.
[3:09:17.820 --> 3:09:22.100]  Who is at the center of the web, the bottom of the rabbit hole, the top of the mountain,
[3:09:22.100 --> 3:09:26.180]  however you look at it, what runs this at just a base level.
[3:09:26.180 --> 3:09:28.500]  It looks pretty anti human Dr. Baggage.
[3:09:28.500 --> 3:09:29.940]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[3:09:29.940 --> 3:09:30.940]  Take over.
[3:09:30.940 --> 3:09:34.300]  Well, thanks for, uh, thanks for having me again, Alex.
[3:09:34.300 --> 3:09:38.700]  You know, that when I look at this, this whole structure, you know, it's, it's really the
[3:09:38.700 --> 3:09:42.060]  same set of players, um, at the very top.
[3:09:42.060 --> 3:09:49.660]  It's a lot of economic interests that look at the, um, average person as, um, a herd
[3:09:49.660 --> 3:09:54.980]  really, uh, detached from, um, uh, humanity in a lot of ways and a lot of these individuals
[3:09:54.980 --> 3:09:56.540]  are detached.
[3:09:56.540 --> 3:10:02.300]  And when you think about, I listened to the last segments, uh, thinking about dehumanizing,
[3:10:02.300 --> 3:10:05.860]  um, people taking us away from each other.
[3:10:05.860 --> 3:10:08.460]  This is kind of, um, a major piece of that.
[3:10:08.460 --> 3:10:13.100]  You know, um, the thing that signs are now saying, look away, don't make eye contact.
[3:10:13.100 --> 3:10:16.220]  Don't look at anybody wear your mask.
[3:10:16.220 --> 3:10:22.300]  Um, you can't even express, uh, true emotion when you're, when you're covered up.
[3:10:22.300 --> 3:10:23.300]  They're being honest.
[3:10:23.300 --> 3:10:25.300]  It's about ending human connection.
[3:10:25.300 --> 3:10:26.300]  Right.
[3:10:26.300 --> 3:10:27.300]  No facial expressions.
[3:10:27.300 --> 3:10:28.300]  That is so satanic.
[3:10:28.300 --> 3:10:29.300]  Sorry.
[3:10:29.300 --> 3:10:30.300]  I'm gonna shut up.
[3:10:30.300 --> 3:10:31.300]  Go ahead.
[3:10:31.300 --> 3:10:32.300]  Okay.
[3:10:32.300 --> 3:10:33.300]  And it really is Alex.
[3:10:33.300 --> 3:10:39.540]  And it's, it's that it's taking the humanity out, um, substituting electronics, um, and
[3:10:39.540 --> 3:10:45.100]  getting us more and more embedded on systems that track every move you make and every breath
[3:10:45.100 --> 3:10:46.100]  you take.
[3:10:46.100 --> 3:10:48.980]  And that's what's really, um, uh, happening.
[3:10:48.980 --> 3:10:54.300]  And as you look at, uh, public meetings going to virtualists, you know, you're, you're,
[3:10:54.300 --> 3:10:58.900]  you're dealing with public policy being made in a vacuum where people aren't allowed to
[3:10:58.900 --> 3:11:00.300]  attend meetings.
[3:11:00.300 --> 3:11:06.660]  Um, all of this sort of removes the human factor further and further away, uh, from the
[3:11:06.660 --> 3:11:11.220]  decision makers and decision making and from one another, which ultimately is where it
[3:11:11.220 --> 3:11:13.500]  all begins.
[3:11:13.500 --> 3:11:18.700]  And that's really what we're seeing, uh, this kind of, um, fracturing that you will of,
[3:11:18.700 --> 3:11:23.020]  of humanity in so many different ways.
[3:11:23.020 --> 3:11:29.620]  You know, thinking about, uh, where we go, uh, where we go next, um, maybe this is the
[3:11:29.620 --> 3:11:36.180]  big challenge, uh, for listeners and for this century, for this election, certainly, um,
[3:11:36.180 --> 3:11:43.340]  all of the power and forces, uh, pushing against, uh, the Trump administration now, uh, and
[3:11:43.340 --> 3:11:44.340]  we're low on time.
[3:11:44.340 --> 3:11:49.060]  You know, you got, uh, very few days till the election, I think 83, 84 days, uh, we're,
[3:11:49.060 --> 3:11:55.020]  we're counted down and if there's a October surprise, it ought to be coming out now, uh,
[3:11:55.020 --> 3:11:59.940]  as we get closer to the election, um, it will have less and less impact and media becomes
[3:11:59.940 --> 3:12:03.860]  more and more manipulated and that's where time is of the essence.
[3:12:03.860 --> 3:12:09.740]  So people need to get involved, um, get engaged and, um, and let's see what happens in this
[3:12:09.740 --> 3:12:10.740]  cycle.
[3:12:10.740 --> 3:12:14.220]  I mean, this is a big reset on two different directions.
[3:12:14.220 --> 3:12:21.060]  One is, are we going to reset or are we going to wait till January and let, um, then reset
[3:12:21.060 --> 3:12:23.420]  us at the next economic form?
[3:12:23.420 --> 3:12:30.820]  And I think that's, that's kind of the baseline of where we are today in so much of this.
[3:12:30.820 --> 3:12:34.700]  And looking forward, you know, where, where does it really begin and end?
[3:12:34.700 --> 3:12:39.140]  It's personal privacy, something we've been talking about, uh, for a long time on this
[3:12:39.140 --> 3:12:40.140]  network.
[3:12:40.140 --> 3:12:49.260]  Um, when you think about the work that, uh, that we began 25 and more years ago, uh, Alex
[3:12:49.260 --> 3:12:53.900]  was starting, we were starting around the same time, maybe a year or two before.
[3:12:53.900 --> 3:12:59.020]  But what we saw was, um, a change in the way technology would be used.
[3:12:59.020 --> 3:13:05.380]  Um, and we saw it, uh, moving very, very rapidly, uh, in a direction of, of, uh, increase
[3:13:05.380 --> 3:13:06.380]  in controls.
[3:13:06.380 --> 3:13:11.700]  Uh, 9-11 was kind of the first trigger point, if you will, for, uh, a reset.
[3:13:11.700 --> 3:13:19.100]  That's where personal privacy started to evaporate, uh, where fear was really pushed out, um,
[3:13:19.100 --> 3:13:20.700]  in volumes and it was looked for.
[3:13:20.700 --> 3:13:26.340]  You know, we talked, uh, years ago about a document, um, uh, the U.S. Army War Call
[3:13:26.340 --> 3:13:29.260]  is called the Revolution in Military Affairs.
[3:13:29.260 --> 3:13:36.300]  And what it said is that it would create an environment of fear and uncertainty using
[3:13:36.300 --> 3:13:41.700]  international drug trafficking and international terrorism as the central themes.
[3:13:41.700 --> 3:13:43.820]  And this was in the late 1980s.
[3:13:43.820 --> 3:13:50.060]  You look at what happened through the nineties and going into, uh, this century, that's what
[3:13:50.060 --> 3:13:55.780]  it was all about, generating a certain level of fear about these adversaries that you couldn't
[3:13:55.780 --> 3:14:00.540]  really touch or quantify drug dealers, terrorism.
[3:14:00.540 --> 3:14:06.260]  But if you could whip the public up, this document said, Revolution in Military Affairs,
[3:14:06.260 --> 3:14:11.500]  that you would have people willing to suspend their civil liberties, suspend their freedom,
[3:14:11.500 --> 3:14:17.100]  suspend their rights in exchange for the illusion of freedom.
[3:14:17.100 --> 3:14:18.220]  And this was the plan.
[3:14:18.220 --> 3:14:23.940]  They knew it even said so, that it violated the constitution, these approaches, but that
[3:14:23.940 --> 3:14:32.500]  people would look the other way and look at the last 25 years slowly, surely one degree
[3:14:32.500 --> 3:14:35.020]  at a time cranking up the temperature.
[3:14:35.020 --> 3:14:36.780]  So you never notice.
[3:14:36.780 --> 3:14:38.060]  And that's where we are today.
[3:14:38.060 --> 3:14:42.580]  Or as the late Chuck Carter used to say, you know, it's a bunch of bologna being sliced
[3:14:42.580 --> 3:14:48.100]  away, one slice at a time until the bologna is all gone, right?
[3:14:48.100 --> 3:14:53.220]  And that's where we are in the 21st century, entering 2020, are we going to have a clear
[3:14:53.220 --> 3:15:02.340]  vision of the future, or the obscure vision, the not the 2020 vision that Impa Wars provides?
[3:15:02.340 --> 3:15:10.060]  This is the time that we need to wake up, look around, be calm in the middle of this
[3:15:10.060 --> 3:15:16.020]  storm, be the center of that storm as it whips around us, knowing that we're the tip of the
[3:15:16.020 --> 3:15:17.020]  spear.
[3:15:17.020 --> 3:15:20.660]  It's about information warfare, and this is a critical moment.
[3:15:20.660 --> 3:15:26.020]  Start this network, take a look at these messages coming up, and support what we're doing on
[3:15:26.020 --> 3:15:27.980]  the Impa Wars.

[3:17:04.300 --> 3:17:06.580]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[3:17:06.580 --> 3:17:10.300]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[3:17:10.300 --> 3:17:12.180]  They are plain God.
[3:17:12.180 --> 3:17:18.940]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[3:17:18.940 --> 3:17:21.940]  to carry out this transformation.
[3:17:21.940 --> 3:17:27.380]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalist it's all on record.
[3:17:27.380 --> 3:17:29.820]  You have been warned.
[3:17:29.820 --> 3:17:34.260]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[3:17:34.260 --> 3:17:37.900]  This is the end of all life on earth as we know it.
[3:17:37.900 --> 3:17:40.820]  This is the alien takeover of earth.
[3:17:40.820 --> 3:17:46.660]  When the corrupt establishment began pushing Joe Biden two years ago they knew he had serious
[3:17:46.660 --> 3:17:47.660]  cognitive problems.
[3:17:47.660 --> 3:17:52.900]  He has always been an empty suit that does what he's told by the globalist and their
[3:17:52.900 --> 3:17:54.900]  allied crime syndicates.
[3:17:54.900 --> 3:17:58.060]  Kamala Harris is even worse than does whatever she's told.
[3:17:58.060 --> 3:18:02.500]  She's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley, the Chai Combs and others.
[3:18:02.500 --> 3:18:09.020]  So she has been chosen because she's part African and now anyone that criticizes her
[3:18:09.020 --> 3:18:13.740]  will be called a racist and evil and she is now above reproach.
[3:18:13.740 --> 3:18:18.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose this monster for who she is.
[3:18:18.500 --> 3:18:23.380]  We must expose the fact that she wanted minimum sentences for black people three times longer
[3:18:23.380 --> 3:18:26.940]  than white people and that the woman is a monster.
[3:18:26.940 --> 3:18:31.900]  Kamala Harris will end up being our president if they're able to steal the election and
[3:18:31.900 --> 3:18:35.820]  she is a 110 percent new world order puppet.
[3:18:35.820 --> 3:18:38.540]  Now more than ever we must expose this monster.
[3:18:38.540 --> 3:18:44.220]  We must expose the globalist.
[3:18:44.220 --> 3:18:56.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:18:56.860 --> 3:19:12.580]  Live from Austin, Texas, Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones and now your host, Nick Baggage.
[3:19:12.580 --> 3:19:17.780]  Thank you for being here and it's good to be here on this Friday afternoon in most of
[3:19:17.780 --> 3:19:24.820]  the country and still a little before noon here in Anchorage, Alaska.
[3:19:24.820 --> 3:19:30.180]  You know, thinking about all of the things in the news right now and what's happening
[3:19:30.180 --> 3:19:36.060]  today can be extraordinarily unsettling for sure.
[3:19:36.060 --> 3:19:39.620]  And it's been a long time coming, you know, and people go, well, how can you even think
[3:19:39.620 --> 3:19:42.180]  about being calm in a mess like this?
[3:19:42.180 --> 3:19:43.180]  Excuse me.
[3:19:43.180 --> 3:19:46.540]  And it is the requirement, actually.
[3:19:46.540 --> 3:19:51.820]  It is what's required right now because let me go over some things I've always covered
[3:19:51.820 --> 3:19:59.420]  in the past and what happens when structures, government in particular, private sector also
[3:19:59.420 --> 3:20:03.980]  uses fear as the motivator and you see it because it's very effective.
[3:20:03.980 --> 3:20:09.260]  It works really good in the short run but doesn't hold in the long run because fear
[3:20:09.260 --> 3:20:12.260]  eventually dissipates to the calm.
[3:20:12.260 --> 3:20:15.740]  And so here's one of the things I can point out.
[3:20:15.740 --> 3:20:21.620]  When you look at an EEG, which measures brain activity and you look at what the brain is
[3:20:21.620 --> 3:20:28.780]  doing when you're in fear or anxiety or hate or any of these anger, any of the negative,
[3:20:28.780 --> 3:20:30.620]  what we call negative emotions.
[3:20:30.620 --> 3:20:34.920]  What you see is generally incoherent brain patterns, a kind not associated with higher
[3:20:34.920 --> 3:20:37.180]  ordered thinking.
[3:20:37.180 --> 3:20:43.460]  And not just higher ordered thinking but higher ordered being because in a state of fear you
[3:20:43.460 --> 3:20:48.660]  don't reach what are referred to as higher states of awareness or consciousness.
[3:20:48.660 --> 3:20:53.780]  And this is extraordinarily important because if you want to short circuit humanity you
[3:20:53.780 --> 3:20:56.540]  keep them in a state of anxiety and fear.
[3:20:56.540 --> 3:21:03.140]  See that's the very first step in breaking down a culture or a society is to inject enough
[3:21:03.140 --> 3:21:09.980]  fear to suspend what you consider normal and what are we seeing in the world today.
[3:21:09.980 --> 3:21:10.980]  Exactly that.
[3:21:10.980 --> 3:21:17.340]  The opportunity for suspending everything that's normal presented itself with the pandemic
[3:21:17.340 --> 3:21:19.900]  as being played out across the world.
[3:21:19.900 --> 3:21:26.940]  And when you think about the economic impacts but more importantly lay all of those physical
[3:21:26.940 --> 3:21:34.820]  things aside and go down deeper again and talk about what does that do to the human
[3:21:34.820 --> 3:21:41.980]  spirit when you inject fear from all angles, you take away people's employment, you create
[3:21:41.980 --> 3:21:48.940]  a total environment of uncertainty, you close all of the schools, you close higher education,
[3:21:48.940 --> 3:21:53.900]  you shut it all down and you go well this is the new normal.
[3:21:53.900 --> 3:21:55.940]  No it isn't.
[3:21:55.940 --> 3:21:59.540]  This is not normal ladies and gentlemen.
[3:21:59.540 --> 3:22:01.200]  This is abnormal.
[3:22:01.200 --> 3:22:02.640]  This is not normal.
[3:22:02.640 --> 3:22:04.540]  This is not a new anything.
[3:22:04.540 --> 3:22:13.460]  This is an old story with a new suit, a new opportunity in the age of an international
[3:22:13.460 --> 3:22:24.180]  global elite and an international global connected population through the internet.
[3:22:24.180 --> 3:22:30.900]  And now that is being divided okay you've got a global elite that now takes control
[3:22:30.900 --> 3:22:39.100]  of the communication networks so that individuals who in our belief system are the foundation
[3:22:39.100 --> 3:22:40.100]  of government.
[3:22:40.100 --> 3:22:42.620]  We are in fact government.
[3:22:42.620 --> 3:22:47.540]  Government exists by virtue of the fact that we give government power as individual souls
[3:22:47.540 --> 3:22:49.660]  as sovereign souls.
[3:22:49.660 --> 3:22:56.660]  And when you start to remove that aspect and push us into some squishy collective of group
[3:22:56.660 --> 3:23:04.020]  thank you see that runs counter to what we are as created individuals certainly within
[3:23:04.020 --> 3:23:12.140]  a larger consciousness within a larger creation we exist but we still function as individuals
[3:23:12.140 --> 3:23:23.820]  with free choice and the right and human privilege and birthright actually to move as an individual
[3:23:23.820 --> 3:23:31.380]  sovereign to create freely with liberty right what does liberty mean it means the lowest
[3:23:31.380 --> 3:23:37.580]  amount of government intrusion in our lives and the lowest amount of let's call it corporate
[3:23:37.580 --> 3:23:45.020]  intrusion in our lives how about the lowest level of intrusion into our individual lives
[3:23:45.020 --> 3:23:47.740]  as the basis of our sovereignty.
[3:23:47.740 --> 3:23:54.540]  Now 250 years ago as people were starting to debate and talk about what that might look
[3:23:54.540 --> 3:24:00.940]  like personal privacy was enshrined in our constitution freedom of speech freedom of
[3:24:00.940 --> 3:24:06.580]  religion freedom of assembly in the first amendment to that constitution foundational
[3:24:06.580 --> 3:24:14.100]  concepts of humanity if you will to allow us the opportunity to self-govern and when
[3:24:14.100 --> 3:24:22.580]  the Internet which is now the global communication vehicle is being channel locked grid locked
[3:24:22.580 --> 3:24:30.340]  if you will into a traffic jam of political correctness then it's time for change.
[3:24:30.340 --> 3:24:36.700]  This is what has to be broken up and here's the thing about breaking up big corporations
[3:24:36.700 --> 3:24:41.180]  the owners end up making more money if you look at the history of AT&T and some of the
[3:24:41.180 --> 3:24:46.300]  others as they broke them up they just made more money and got to spread it around differently
[3:24:46.300 --> 3:24:51.460]  and that's the way capitalism works I get that but when you attack something it's not
[3:24:51.460 --> 3:24:56.860]  just about breaking up the monopoly power because that is not the solution it's making
[3:24:56.860 --> 3:25:03.780]  it criminal a criminal event to violate your personal privacy in the 21st century the same
[3:25:03.780 --> 3:25:07.780]  as it would be if someone kicked in your front door and started rifling through your files
[3:25:07.780 --> 3:25:13.500]  and papers without a warrant the same should be true on the Internet in all forms of electronic
[3:25:13.500 --> 3:25:19.660]  communication you should always be protected as a fundamental human right now this doesn't
[3:25:19.660 --> 3:25:27.140]  mean that you sign some complicated long drawn out agreement when you sign up for the app
[3:25:27.140 --> 3:25:32.380]  or the this or the that with a way you wave all of your human rights away so they can
[3:25:32.380 --> 3:25:41.260]  just pill for you like like rifling through a treasure chest if someone else is owning
[3:25:41.260 --> 3:25:46.100]  this is what's happening you've been commoditized you've been made into a commodity called human
[3:25:46.100 --> 3:25:51.060]  being and you generate so much money for the pharmaceutical industry for the automobile
[3:25:51.060 --> 3:25:55.340]  industry for all these industries that we function as consumers and now through the
[3:25:55.340 --> 3:26:01.540]  pipeline of the big multinational distribution hubs because little mom and pops have been
[3:26:01.540 --> 3:26:10.460]  wiped out of the face of the planet because of the crap going on right now to manipulate
[3:26:10.460 --> 3:26:17.180]  us even for through fear where the reptilian brain kicks in your flight or fight response
[3:26:17.180 --> 3:26:25.300]  kicks in and then the propaganda just moves you like a hurricane within you around until
[3:26:25.300 --> 3:26:31.580]  you're completely destroyed or you make a different choice and you stay calm and you
[3:26:31.580 --> 3:26:36.060]  occupy the center of that storm and you see all of this around you and then you choose
[3:26:36.060 --> 3:26:43.180]  to liberally how you'll engage each and everything now the trick and there is a couple tricks
[3:26:43.180 --> 3:26:47.660]  one of them is control of emotion because this is your creative force you give it to
[3:26:47.660 --> 3:26:53.620]  someone else when you run into fear you just hand it off just give it away don't do that
[3:26:53.620 --> 3:27:02.100]  keep this power of your emotion when you're fear in fear or anxiety or any of these things
[3:27:02.100 --> 3:27:09.340]  pay attention look at that emotion don't let it carry you a wave like a wave like a title
[3:27:09.340 --> 3:27:17.460]  wave sit on the top of the wave observe the emotion do experience it but then you control
[3:27:17.460 --> 3:27:25.420]  when you pay attention this is the trick for the 21st century is to pay attention internally
[3:27:25.420 --> 3:27:32.400]  externally pay attention you're in fear you're being hurted you're giving up you're handing
[3:27:32.400 --> 3:27:39.620]  off your power don't do that anymore that's the mistake that is the mistake fear is the
[3:27:39.620 --> 3:27:45.820]  adversary and fear is the tool because here's what happens when you combine thought with
[3:27:45.820 --> 3:27:53.780]  belief faith belief what you know to be right and true and you combine thought belief faith
[3:27:53.780 --> 3:28:03.180]  and then the emotion love empathy compassion or you can do fear anxiety hate but you'll
[3:28:03.180 --> 3:28:12.020]  create with either one and one creates destructively and one creates constructively how will you
[3:28:12.020 --> 3:28:18.620]  create how will we create together the reality that we see we would be herded to where all
[3:28:18.620 --> 3:28:24.100]  of that a negative emotional energy flows into the pipeline of creativity for an evil
[3:28:24.100 --> 3:28:29.780]  outcome because that is the world today to change the world we have to change ourselves
[3:28:29.780 --> 3:28:35.340]  we have to look internally and then reflect externally in a way that shows that we are
[3:28:35.340 --> 3:28:44.580]  in the spirit we'll be right back how do you contest an election in the year 2020 well
[3:28:44.580 --> 3:28:50.500]  you trigger race riots and you tell the blue states and blue cities when you're the speaker
[3:28:50.500 --> 3:28:54.540]  of the house that you are legitimately now the president that's what she's been said
[3:28:54.540 --> 3:29:00.420]  on CBS News and that you're going to have those blue states succeed yes that's officially
[3:29:00.420 --> 3:29:05.380]  called a civil war ladies and gentlemen the democrats are backed by the e you hollywood
[3:29:05.380 --> 3:29:10.580]  the chai comms and the whole globalist system this is treason with a capital T and our federal
[3:29:10.580 --> 3:29:15.700]  government is so paralyzed with cowards they won't even stand up against it and do anything
[3:29:15.700 --> 3:29:19.900]  even though our president has been exposing it here's the bottom line you need storeable
[3:29:19.900 --> 3:29:24.300]  food we've got the best quality ready to ship to you right now two to four week delivery

[3:29:35.140 --> 3:29:42.500]  now and get ready and get prepared at infowarstore.com get prepared you can really break civilizations
[3:29:42.500 --> 3:29:50.020]  down to two types predatory and non predatory or oppressive conquest based or renaissance
[3:29:50.020 --> 3:29:56.540]  based and of course different types of civilizations and countries and political systems of history
[3:29:56.540 --> 3:30:04.820]  and of the present are mixes of the two but with globalism it is a post human ideology
[3:30:04.820 --> 3:30:11.900]  so it's scientifically geared to be oppressive and the rationale is social Darwinism that
[3:30:11.900 --> 3:30:17.060]  the ruling class are elites and because they're in power they have a right to rule over you
[3:30:17.060 --> 3:30:23.300]  poison you dumb you down sterilize you and kill you so all the people wearing masks like
[3:30:23.300 --> 3:30:29.100]  outside at the park and stuff are living in a total hoax and think their act of submission
[3:30:29.100 --> 3:30:34.060]  is an act of working for the common good in a collective no it's a sign that you're a
[3:30:34.060 --> 3:30:38.140]  slave who will take the force inoculations federal government and Yale are studying
[3:30:38.140 --> 3:30:44.740]  the force inoculations right now constantly whether it's the new york times the washington
[3:30:44.740 --> 3:30:49.260]  post or howard sternum a blue name and they come out and they attack him full war saying
[3:30:49.260 --> 3:30:55.740]  jones claims civil wars coming and financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses
[3:30:55.740 --> 3:31:00.260]  and he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have horrible food
[3:31:00.260 --> 3:31:04.700]  if they can and now everything i've warned people about is coming true because it was
[3:31:04.700 --> 3:31:10.820]  all in the rockfeller foundation documents like lockstep this is the corporate planetary

[3:32:59.980 --> 3:33:18.380]  and welcome back it's always good to be here on a friday afternoon and you know talking
[3:33:18.380 --> 3:33:23.380]  about just what's going on in the world you know we can all get pretty excited about
[3:33:23.380 --> 3:33:31.180]  about all of it and we do because it's pretty disturbing when you see so much so fast and
[3:33:31.180 --> 3:33:38.340]  you know and part of it is i'm going to call it the whole idea of using the phrase false
[3:33:38.340 --> 3:33:45.140]  narrative really just bothers me because this whole concept is a relatively new one in terms
[3:33:45.140 --> 3:33:50.700]  of political speech and i want to talk a little bit about this because i was talking before
[3:33:50.700 --> 3:33:57.500]  the break about how combining thought motion is kind of the essence of creative power as
[3:33:57.500 --> 3:34:04.100]  you push out into the world and this is this is literally the truth matter and those involved
[3:34:04.100 --> 3:34:14.460]  in the occult understand how you combine that energy to create negatively and likewise if
[3:34:14.460 --> 3:34:21.380]  you combine your choice and in a different direction it creates a different outcome and
[3:34:21.380 --> 3:34:28.540]  i think that's the important message of the day because this is the the root of of creativity
[3:34:28.540 --> 3:34:33.940]  now part of this can get altered if you think about what's been happening over the years
[3:34:33.940 --> 3:34:41.860]  the phrase political correctness the phrase a narrative a new narrative has come into play
[3:34:41.860 --> 3:34:47.460]  um let's talk about that just a little bit a narrative is a script all right a narrative
[3:34:47.460 --> 3:34:52.940]  is something you write down and then you follow like a plan or a script or a speech that's
[3:34:52.940 --> 3:35:01.460]  already written um no we don't have a narrative going on that's again more bs they're trying
[3:35:01.460 --> 3:35:08.380]  to sell as fertilizer uh it's it's narratives are scripted that's not how human beings are
[3:35:08.380 --> 3:35:14.860]  intended to operate scripted that's not how we do it the the other one is political correctness
[3:35:14.860 --> 3:35:21.140]  what does that really say it means we have to say things so that people don't aren't
[3:35:21.140 --> 3:35:28.660]  are not offended uh by what we say so we get to a political neutral more or less we don't
[3:35:28.660 --> 3:35:34.540]  offend anyone we just kind of mush our way through life and that's kind of the concept
[3:35:34.540 --> 3:35:42.900]  that doesn't work because within a vigorous democracy or democratic republic like ours
[3:35:42.900 --> 3:35:48.980]  you you get this invigorated debate and then in our structure of government we have representative
[3:35:48.980 --> 3:35:55.300]  government so somebody takes that debate refines it and creates legislation you hope that's
[3:35:55.300 --> 3:36:03.060]  the way it works but when you have powerful interests that are able to sway the politician
[3:36:03.060 --> 3:36:10.140]  and the narrative for the public through control of media and then they even create a new phrase
[3:36:10.140 --> 3:36:19.420]  fake news fake news well it's not news if it's fake right that's just fiction is what
[3:36:19.420 --> 3:36:24.300]  that's called not fake news we have already have a word for that's called fiction yeah
[3:36:24.300 --> 3:36:30.220]  fiction writing and then you have non-fiction writing fake news is like an oxymoron it's
[3:36:30.220 --> 3:36:34.860]  like what I talked about last last time I was on doing the impossible how can you do
[3:36:34.860 --> 3:36:40.500]  something you don't believe in you can't you know so these are part of the structure of
[3:36:40.500 --> 3:36:45.420]  the new narrative is to create a new way of thinking that really doesn't work so it creates
[3:36:45.420 --> 3:36:51.100]  a conflict mentally right off the get go which is a way you start to break down the human
[3:36:51.100 --> 3:36:56.220]  being now the other way you do it is through the method of political correctness and it
[3:36:56.220 --> 3:37:03.460]  is a method because if you get people to start saying things first you get them to shut up
[3:37:03.460 --> 3:37:08.980]  okay that's called tolerance we wrap that around this whole concept because that's supposed
[3:37:08.980 --> 3:37:14.460]  to be some virtuous thing to be tolerant oh I'm tolerant what does that really say that
[3:37:14.460 --> 3:37:19.380]  means you shut up about something you believe in in favor of something you don't believe
[3:37:19.380 --> 3:37:24.980]  in that's called tolerance a deeper level and I've said it before is acceptance that's
[3:37:24.980 --> 3:37:29.660]  where you see what is and you accept what is but you don't necessarily go along with
[3:37:29.660 --> 3:37:35.460]  but you see what is you don't argue with facts but you may interpret how you deal with those
[3:37:35.460 --> 3:37:41.100]  facts differently so political narratives and political speech and political correctness
[3:37:41.100 --> 3:37:46.180]  take all that away and get you to first suspend what you believe in and not say it anymore
[3:37:46.180 --> 3:37:52.140]  and then when you open your mouth to start saying what you know you're expecting to say
[3:37:52.140 --> 3:37:57.340]  as opposed to what you believe in now that is the way to turn off part of your brain
[3:37:57.340 --> 3:38:03.420]  that is the consciousness part the part that connects you to the infinite the part that
[3:38:03.420 --> 3:38:10.620]  dials you in okay when you turn that off and then you just function in the flesh in the
[3:38:10.620 --> 3:38:18.620]  world and in fear then you fall that's called a fallen state of man basically is a simple
[3:38:18.620 --> 3:38:26.500]  explanation not a lot of flowery complex language in that simple faith is also simple is acting
[3:38:26.500 --> 3:38:31.740]  on what you believe in not doing the impossible acting on what you believe in which is a big
[3:38:31.740 --> 3:38:38.220]  part of what I've been saying lately because when we combine it internally first find that
[3:38:38.220 --> 3:38:44.220]  peace find that empathy find that love find that compassion find what it is that makes
[3:38:44.220 --> 3:38:50.780]  your core different than a core driven by fear and then project that in the world with
[3:38:50.780 --> 3:38:59.460]  force and power of knowing that what you do matter everything you do matters and so don't
[3:38:59.460 --> 3:39:06.460]  accept the narrative of oh you have no power oh you can't do anything and oh I got a hide
[3:39:06.460 --> 3:39:13.340]  in my closet for the rest of eternity no that is not what we are and that is not who we
[3:39:13.340 --> 3:39:20.140]  are and that is not our state of remembering because what I said often is it's not about
[3:39:20.140 --> 3:39:26.220]  evolution it's about remembering what we are as human beings and then begin to project
[3:39:26.220 --> 3:39:32.380]  differently and part of that is recognizing the divinity in each and every person and
[3:39:32.380 --> 3:39:39.780]  that requires then a level of respect whether you're shown that same respect or not it requires
[3:39:39.780 --> 3:39:47.140]  it of you and me that we project differently and that we take our power back let go of
[3:39:47.140 --> 3:39:53.900]  fear take our power back and begin to project in the world constructively in different ways
[3:39:53.900 --> 3:40:02.420]  all the ways that we can individually because that is what creates a bigger collective if
[3:40:02.420 --> 3:40:08.980]  you will but it's individuals that drive that not the other way around and so again the
[3:40:08.980 --> 3:40:16.100]  idea of political debate of being able to meet and congregate and more importantly face
[3:40:16.100 --> 3:40:22.540]  elected officials in public you know the idea like here in Anchorage some of the most controversial
[3:40:22.540 --> 3:40:28.500]  issues are in front of our local assembly and they're all hiding in their houses with
[3:40:28.500 --> 3:40:34.540]  their mute buttons on watching TV while their meetings are happening and the public is testifying
[3:40:34.540 --> 3:40:40.660]  because now they can really ignore you and not be embarrassed by it can't see them that
[3:40:40.660 --> 3:40:46.020]  is not the type of government we created at least in this country star chamber sort of
[3:40:46.020 --> 3:40:54.340]  government right now they can just hide two layers of electronics no this is not the way
[3:40:54.340 --> 3:40:59.780]  this is not the path forward it's reflect internally gather our power again let go of
[3:40:59.780 --> 3:41:05.460]  fear and move with confidence into a world that we can change and here's what I know
[3:41:05.460 --> 3:41:10.540]  about that is it doesn't require a mass you know don't wait around for the big majority
[3:41:10.540 --> 3:41:19.420]  it always starts with a few a few voices and then a few powerful voices and then the most
[3:41:19.420 --> 3:41:26.900]  important thing is every individual and here's what's buried in all of that we think we're
[3:41:26.900 --> 3:41:34.100]  small and this is part of the big lie to think back on the story of the middows widows might
[3:41:34.100 --> 3:41:39.780]  it's a small that is actually big and I said it often because we underestimate our power
[3:41:39.780 --> 3:41:47.660]  and that's part of the big lie to is oh you can't do anything do what you can that has
[3:41:47.660 --> 3:41:54.540]  hope in it that has faith in it that has all the things and all the ingredients that change
[3:41:54.540 --> 3:42:02.140]  the world in it if you begin to act in a different way project what you believe internally externally
[3:42:02.140 --> 3:42:09.740]  don't just parrot your religion your philosophy whatever it is that you say you believe in
[3:42:09.740 --> 3:42:14.500]  and don't try and explain it all to someone else because you're filling them with words
[3:42:14.500 --> 3:42:20.780]  they don't understand act differently and maybe someone will ask you a question of wow
[3:42:20.780 --> 3:42:26.980]  how come you're so different what makes you unique why is it that you're always in this
[3:42:26.980 --> 3:42:34.100]  certain state even when everything is flying off the shelves around you and wheels are
[3:42:34.100 --> 3:42:38.740]  rolling off the car as you're driving down the road and you're still driving down the
[3:42:38.740 --> 3:42:44.580]  road it's because of your faith it's because of who you are it's because of what we do
[3:42:44.580 --> 3:42:53.100]  together in the world is changing the way we see the world by self-reflection not falling
[3:42:53.100 --> 3:42:59.860]  into the group thing this is how Hitler did it you see he got people first to suspend
[3:42:59.860 --> 3:43:07.260]  their beliefs with political correctness of their day and then your power was gone remember
[3:43:07.260 --> 3:43:13.300]  who you are remember what you are remember the person you look at in the eye is created
[3:43:13.300 --> 3:43:20.660]  in the same image and likeness of God that you are so act divinely and change the world
[3:43:20.660 --> 3:43:26.620]  because that's what we're here to do and the hour is late and we are at the tip of the
[3:43:26.620 --> 3:43:43.660]  spear five minutes to midnight Dr. Nick Begg is signing.
