[00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:05.918]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:00:05.918 --> 00:00:10.082]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:25.652 --> 00:00:28.175]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:30.979]  I have returned after taking a few days off to be with the family.
[00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.081]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:34.743]  I hope you had a wonderful Christmas.
[00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:36.085]  I did pop in with David Knight.
[00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:40.150]  Of course, Friday he did a great job guest hosting the transmission.
[00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.333]  David Knight of InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.454]  The crew did a great job as well.
[00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:54.459]  All week with some special rebroadcasts that also had new original research and material integrated into those transmissions.
[00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:55.579]  But we have returned.
[00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.640]  This will be the last Sunday broadcast of 2013.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.921]  It is the 29th day of December 2013.
[00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:02.502]  And I do want to open the phones up in the first hour.
[00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:13.778]  Now I usually don't even do that in a second because I tend to have so much news I want to cover, I don't get to your calls.
[00:01:13.778 --> 00:01:22.083]  But I specifically, and I'll give the number out in about 20-30 minutes and open the phones up, want to hear from you on what you think the most important stories of 2013 were.
[00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:25.745]  Because it's important to be retrospective.
[00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:39.182]  And then also to look forward what you think is going to happen in 2014 which I myself and many other folks smarter than I in many areas believe is the most critical year perhaps in world history.
[00:01:40.336 --> 00:01:48.462]  Because if we screw up and have another world war, it's going to be thermonuclear, biological, chemical, and nanotech in nature.
[00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:51.344]  There's a lot of other weapon systems.
[00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:54.286]  And we probably, as a species, won't make it.
[00:01:54.286 --> 00:02:00.811]  So we're kind of reaching that point where we've got to decide whether we want to go into the future or not, as a species.
[00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:02.572]  It's make it or break it time.
[00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:08.037]  And I'm not saying all this will happen in 2014, but the breaks, the analogy I was
[00:02:09.124 --> 00:02:31.954]  Thinking of last night when I was out having dinner with some friends was it's like pool where you hit the ball, you know, that first hit after you've racked the other balls and the direction and the lay of the game to come to a great extent is based on how good a hit you put in to that triangle of balls.
[00:02:31.954 --> 00:02:33.835]  And that's what 2014 is on so many fronts.
[00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:40.118]  It is not just a big deal here in the United States, but it's a big deal worldwide.
[00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.820]  And there's a lot of different reasons for that.
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.361]  We're going to be breaking it down coming up today.
[00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:48.004]  Obviously, there is a massive ton of important news here.
[00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:51.666]  And as usual, I don't know where to start.
[00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:54.428]  Here's a story from RT from InfoWars.com.
[00:02:54.428 --> 00:02:55.288]  We posted it.
[00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:56.029]  Drugs link to it.
[00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:57.370]  DrugsReport.com.
[00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.392]  LAPD deploys drug detection swab test at sobriety checkpoints.
[00:03:01.392 --> 00:03:01.853]  Now folks,
[00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:05.565]  I've been telling you for about five years these are federal grants.
[00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:12.592]  They admit they're to prepare people for forced DNA swabbing at highway checkpoints.
[00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:16.435]  Now they're not just hiring off-duty cops to do this under the federal program.
[00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:23.201]  They are setting it up and basically forcing people to do it via intimidation.
[00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:25.163]  And hey, mind if I do a breathalyzer?
[00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.424]  Or I'm gonna take you to jail.
[00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:28.806]  Now I'm going to take a cheek swab.
[00:03:28.806 --> 00:03:31.428]  And I told you that was next.
[00:03:31.428 --> 00:03:32.708]  I'm not smart, okay?
[00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:34.269]  I've learned how the globalists operate.
[00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.213]  It's like if you have a con artist neighbor that you've lived next to for five years.
[00:03:40.213 --> 00:03:43.035]  And you finally learn all their tricks, basically.
[00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:46.077]  Because criminals and scammers only have...
[00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:49.446]  Certain systems they follow.
[00:03:49.446 --> 00:03:52.027]  Criminals are extremely obsessive-compulsive.
[00:03:52.027 --> 00:04:02.430]  And I'm not even saying the police are criminals here, though they're engaged in criminal, unconstitutional, racketeering, intimidation, color of law, garbage.
[00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.992]  I'm not saying they're consciously criminal, but the social engineers that are coming up with this on record are criminals.
[00:04:11.604 --> 00:04:12.645]  And we're going to be going over that.
[00:04:12.645 --> 00:04:15.387]  So that's just one of the articles I've got here.
[00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:17.228]  I mean, there's got to be more than 200 today.
[00:04:17.228 --> 00:04:19.630]  This is a mass load of information.
[00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.611]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:26.974]  A DNC sends out email defending Obama from impeachment possibility.
[00:04:26.974 --> 00:04:28.935]  And the Daily Caller makes a joke out of this.
[00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.015]  This is very serious.
[00:04:30.015 --> 00:04:38.380]  There is, according to many Congress people I've talked to on and off air, a major move of impeachment being looked at for at least the Attorney General.
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.063]  And of course, just like with Nixon, if that starts with the Attorney General and others, it's over.
[00:04:45.943 --> 00:04:54.686]  If cabinet-level people get targeted in impeachment, it'll turn into a criminal investigation of the fraudster-in-chief, the Lord of Vomitcare.
[00:04:54.686 --> 00:04:56.846]  So we're going to be breaking it all down straight ahead.
[00:04:56.846 --> 00:04:59.087]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.087 --> 00:05:02.108]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:05:02.108 --> 00:05:07.129]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:14.291]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:20.077]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:05:20.077 --> 00:05:24.101]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:28.826]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:34.052]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:37.514]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:05:37.514 --> 00:05:40.036]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:44.779]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.681]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:54.885]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[00:05:54.885 --> 00:05:56.146]  We're getting prepared.
[00:05:56.146 --> 00:05:56.827]  Are you?
[00:05:56.827 --> 00:05:57.607]  Infowarshop.com
[00:06:06.607 --> 00:06:17.493]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial commonwealth.
[00:06:17.493 --> 00:06:23.396]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:06:23.396 --> 00:06:29.460]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.001]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:33.082]  A new world order.
[00:06:36.644 --> 00:06:39.649]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.576]  It just pancakes.
[00:06:43.576 --> 00:06:47.422]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:06.210]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.781]  Guns will be taken.
[00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:12.981]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:14.362]  We're going to take all of them.
[00:07:14.362 --> 00:07:19.185]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:07:19.185 --> 00:07:20.766]  Global governance at last.
[00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:21.766]  Is it one world?
[00:07:21.766 --> 00:07:23.427]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:07:23.427 --> 00:07:27.029]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:33.313]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:07:33.313 --> 00:07:38.016]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:49.017]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on another live worldwide broadcast, the 29th day of December, 2013.
[00:07:49.017 --> 00:07:59.345]  And again, this will be the last Sunday broadcast of 2013, but we'll be here live tomorrow and again then on Tuesday into New Year's.
[00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.707]  I haven't decided yet if we'll be live New Year's Day.
[00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:13.631]  I think I'm gonna wait until New Year's Eve to see if some huge news story befalls us and then I will be here live on New Year's Day.
[00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:18.032]  We are live on this Sunday edition and then we'll be back weekdays 11 a.m.
[00:08:18.032 --> 00:08:18.972]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:18.972 --> 00:08:20.073]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:20.073 --> 00:08:22.353]  We're here every Sunday live 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:25.214]  Central and of course a lot of affiliates about half of them
[00:08:25.854 --> 00:08:27.055]  Roughly.
[00:08:27.055 --> 00:08:31.639]  Don't carry the show live, so you're hearing at different times all around the country.
[00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:38.885]  Some stations, in fact, air this Sunday show later in the evening the next day and have a special edition.
[00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:47.692]  So we want to thank all of those great affiliates out there for being fellow travelers in liberty, not fellow travelers in collectivism and tyranny.
[00:08:48.473 --> 00:08:51.434]  All right, let me just give you some of the headlines.
[00:08:51.434 --> 00:08:58.918]  I'm going to try my best to go over these and then open the phones up on some big questions I've got that I want to get your take on out there.
[00:08:58.918 --> 00:09:04.140]  Hope you had a great Christmas, and we're plunging into 2014, such a critical year.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.783]  DNC sends email defending Obama from impeachment possibility.
[00:09:08.783 --> 00:09:13.625]  And some of the conservative groups made a joke about this saying, oh, you guys are paranoid.
[00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:20.072]  Well, that's what the blue-blood Republicans hope, is they don't want to impeach Obama.
[00:09:20.072 --> 00:09:24.373]  That'll bring justice to the whole system and scare the abuse of power.
[00:09:24.373 --> 00:09:33.716]  They want Obama to leave office so the Republican establishment can seize power and use all these new dictatorial goodies and precedents that Obama has set.
[00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:45.732]  We want to bring Obama and his cohorts that, I don't want to exaggerate, have probably done five times more tyranny than any other president before him.
[00:09:45.732 --> 00:09:47.794]  And again, I was a big critic of Bush, folks.
[00:09:47.794 --> 00:09:53.039]  Obama is literally so horrible and has carried the ball for tyranny.
[00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:57.034]  He basically made like a thousand touchdowns against Liberty.
[00:09:57.034 --> 00:09:59.056]  I mean, it's just so devastating.
[00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:00.217]  So horrible.
[00:10:00.217 --> 00:10:04.742]  We've got to reverse all this and you've got to have investigations.
[00:10:04.742 --> 00:10:05.903]  You've got to impeach people.
[00:10:05.903 --> 00:10:08.346]  You've got to jail people.
[00:10:08.346 --> 00:10:10.488]  Or it sets the precedent and they get away with it.
[00:10:12.466 --> 00:10:15.169]  So we're going to be talking about that today.
[00:10:15.169 --> 00:10:16.510]  Listen to this Daily Caller.
[00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.434]  DNC sends email defending Obama for impeachment possibility.
[00:10:20.434 --> 00:10:30.183]  The Democratic National Committee sent on a paranoid email Saturday evening urging supporters to vote for Democrats so the Republicans can't impeach President Obama.
[00:10:30.183 --> 00:10:33.025]  They went on to say it's desperate in 2014.
[00:10:33.025 --> 00:10:36.369]  If the Tea Party people get in, they'll impeach him.
[00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:37.410]  That's actually true!
[00:10:39.281 --> 00:10:50.524]  That's why you've got the Republican leadership, Boehner and Rove and all of them, the people that helped write Obamacare, on record.
[00:10:50.524 --> 00:11:03.987]  Altogether, you've got them working in concert to try to keep Obamacare in place, to try to keep the Federal Reserve in place, to try to keep the status quo of galloping tyranny in place.
[00:11:03.987 --> 00:11:05.347]  And so, you've got the
[00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:16.212]  Big Republican associations of manufacturers and the different business groups that have actually de-industrialized this country.
[00:11:16.212 --> 00:11:21.894]  The groups that are actually insiders who only want business for themselves and want big government to shut down their competition.
[00:11:21.894 --> 00:11:26.035]  All the big Republican blue blood scum groups.
[00:11:26.035 --> 00:11:26.775]  Mafia groups.
[00:11:27.605 --> 00:11:33.227]  Who helped create the modern Democratic Party, basically, as their fake loyal opposition.
[00:11:33.227 --> 00:11:35.988]  So the Democrats are so horrible, you keep voting for the Blue Bloods.
[00:11:35.988 --> 00:11:42.971]  The Blue Bloods are all lined up with the Democrats, and when an Obama speech leaks, or a Biden speech leaks, who are they talking about?
[00:11:42.971 --> 00:11:46.912]  They're talking not about the Russians, not about the shycoms, not about any of that.
[00:11:46.912 --> 00:11:48.693]  They're worried about the Tea Party.
[00:11:49.974 --> 00:11:56.839]  That's why it's so fashionable in even mainline neocon talk radio to bash the Libertarian Tea Party.
[00:11:56.839 --> 00:11:59.321]  Because they're the only people that know what's going on.
[00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:05.185]  They're not perfect, but they're the only possible opposition to the globalist takeover.
[00:12:05.185 --> 00:12:06.626]  They understand the basics.
[00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:10.089]  And the public sees them as the opposition properly.
[00:12:10.089 --> 00:12:14.232]  And so it's growing at the state and federal and local level.
[00:12:14.232 --> 00:12:18.315]  And that is panicking the system right now across the board.
[00:12:19.502 --> 00:12:22.784]  That is panicking the system at every single level.
[00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:35.491]  So the entire power structure, who's tried to co-opt the Tea Party in the last seven, eight years, back when Ron Paul first founded it, then they couldn't co-opt it, they couldn't derail it, they couldn't buy it off because it was an idea.
[00:12:35.491 --> 00:12:38.693]  So even if they bought it off, the crowds just went somewhere else.
[00:12:38.693 --> 00:12:41.715]  The idea continued on like the phoenix out of the ashes.
[00:12:41.715 --> 00:12:42.996]  And so now they're trying to kill it.
[00:12:43.803 --> 00:12:44.523]  I mean, just look it up.
[00:12:44.523 --> 00:12:45.604]  It's in the news every day.
[00:12:45.604 --> 00:13:01.734]  The entire Republican blue-blood establishment, the entire globalist banking cartel, the entire military-industrial complex, they are all on record steamrolling ahead as viciously as they possibly can to get rid of it.
[00:13:01.734 --> 00:13:09.339]  And they know if there's a Tea Party sweep into the House and even a few seats in the Senate, there will be impeachment.
[00:13:09.339 --> 00:13:12.681]  And folks, Obama makes Richard Nixon look like
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.985]  The Archangel Gabriel or something.
[00:13:17.985 --> 00:13:22.091]  As bad as Nixon was, he did not want to destroy America.
[00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:24.195]  He did not want to destroy all the families.
[00:13:24.195 --> 00:13:26.518]  He did not want to totally socialize everything.
[00:13:26.518 --> 00:13:28.141]  He just wanted power and control.
[00:13:29.147 --> 00:13:32.491]  And the elites couldn't fully control him, so they set him up and basically had him impeached.
[00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:34.514]  And that's all been declassified and come out.
[00:13:34.514 --> 00:13:46.068]  Bob Woodward of the Naval Intelligence and others with the CIA infiltrating his own organization and his own group, making him paranoid to target his political opposition and then bringing him down.
[00:13:46.068 --> 00:13:47.530]  And I'm not romanticizing Nixon.
[00:13:48.211 --> 00:13:52.472]  They were looking at plans to bomb their own RNC event.
[00:13:52.472 --> 00:13:56.814]  It even has come out on PBS and Frontline to blame it on their political opposition.
[00:13:56.814 --> 00:13:58.314]  That's how bad Nixon was.
[00:13:58.314 --> 00:14:04.297]  He was going to blow stuff up and blame it on his political opposition because he thought they were evil and needed to be done.
[00:14:04.297 --> 00:14:06.117]  But he at least thought he was good.
[00:14:06.117 --> 00:14:14.300]  With these people, with these globalists, they are all about criminal, total domination of the individual, the wrecking of America forever, period.
[00:14:16.138 --> 00:14:26.960]  And that's why it's total scorched earth, salting the earth, massive economic cultural siege of America to fully bring us into the new world order.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:38.043]  Because you can't have our country owning guns and having private property when the globalists are getting rid of that worldwide, except for offshore corporations that are above the law and have corporate diplomatic immunity.
[00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.243]  So that's what's happening.
[00:14:39.243 --> 00:14:43.264]  That's why 2014 coming up is so incredibly critical, but
[00:14:45.505 --> 00:14:47.043]  The loyal opposition...
[00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:55.374]  Neocons posing as libertarian conservative groups are always there joking and laughing and, haha, no one would ever impeach Obama!
[00:14:55.374 --> 00:14:56.335]  How ridiculous!
[00:14:56.335 --> 00:14:57.535]  Who would think of such a thing?
[00:14:57.535 --> 00:14:58.396]  Paranoia!
[00:14:58.396 --> 00:15:03.339]  No, no, we must move forward to impeach the Attorney General for Fast and Furious and all the other lies.
[00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:11.544]  And Hillary, I don't care if she's left office, you know, drag her up there over Benghazi and caught lying, and caught lying about Obamacare.
[00:15:11.544 --> 00:15:15.126]  I mean, it should be, but see, the Republican leadership is all involved in this.
[00:15:15.686 --> 00:15:18.329]  They're all corrupt as well, so who are they going after?
[00:15:18.329 --> 00:15:22.673]  Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Matt Drudge, Alex Jones, people like that.
[00:15:22.673 --> 00:15:30.420]  They're demonizing anyone who just isn't completely sold out to tyranny and who isn't an insane control freak.
[00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:35.322]  Alright, folks, we're going to come back.
[00:15:35.322 --> 00:15:37.283]  See, I got to one story.
[00:15:37.283 --> 00:15:46.187]  I said I have about 150, 200, I haven't counted them here, but there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 stacks.
[00:15:46.187 --> 00:15:49.069]  Some of these stacks have as many as 10 articles in them.
[00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:50.629]  So, I don't know, 150 or something.
[00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:53.751]  I'm going to try to get to it as fast as I can on the other side.
[00:15:53.751 --> 00:15:55.292]  We have got so much to cover.
[00:15:55.292 --> 00:15:56.553]  I am Alex Jones.
[00:15:56.553 --> 00:15:58.654]  InfoWars.com is our website.
[00:15:58.654 --> 00:15:59.154]  Prison Planet.
[00:16:00.276 --> 00:16:02.177]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:16:02.177 --> 00:16:05.819]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:10.341]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:16.484]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:16:16.484 --> 00:16:27.249]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:16:27.469 --> 00:16:30.312]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[00:16:30.312 --> 00:16:33.955]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:16:33.955 --> 00:16:48.688]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:16:48.948 --> 00:16:53.793]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[00:16:53.793 --> 00:16:55.014]  Why do we have the highest
[00:17:06.144 --> 00:17:13.491]  Cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:15.433]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:17:15.433 --> 00:17:17.074]  We are what we eat.
[00:17:17.074 --> 00:17:21.739]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:25.963]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:17:25.963 --> 00:17:28.225]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:34.748]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[00:17:34.748 --> 00:17:37.709]  To learn more, visit InfoWarsHealth.com.

[00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:17.534]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.534 --> 00:18:22.417]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:18:22.417 --> 00:18:29.201]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:18:29.201 --> 00:18:36.305]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.287]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:18:38.287 --> 00:18:43.414]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:47.899]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:18:47.899 --> 00:18:51.123]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:18:51.323 --> 00:18:57.567]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:18:57.567 --> 00:18:59.969]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:59.969 --> 00:19:10.656]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:19:10.656 --> 00:19:12.497]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:19:12.697 --> 00:19:13.577]  Fluoride.
[00:19:13.577 --> 00:19:15.498]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:19:15.498 --> 00:19:22.080]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.020]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.001]  And the results are on record.
[00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:33.323]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:19:33.323 --> 00:19:35.743]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:19:35.743 --> 00:19:38.684]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:19:38.684 --> 00:19:42.065]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:19:42.185 --> 00:19:47.606]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:19:47.606 --> 00:19:52.708]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[00:19:52.708 --> 00:19:53.908]  I take it every day.
[00:19:53.908 --> 00:20:01.290]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:02.830]  Coast to Coast.
[00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.871]  Direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:08.092]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:21.603]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:21.603 --> 00:20:24.145]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:52.099 --> 00:21:04.165]  Well, a black widow, as they're called, suicide bomber hit a major city in Russia, killing at least 15 people.
[00:21:04.165 --> 00:21:08.788]  And it's a reported Islamicist attack with an Al-Qaeda affiliated group.
[00:21:08.788 --> 00:21:15.311]  Guess who on record runs Al-Qaeda out of Dagestan, on record?
[00:21:15.311 --> 00:21:16.792]  The criminals that run our government.
[00:21:17.913 --> 00:21:28.441]  And they were busy beavers over the Christmas holiday in Libya, in Iraq, in Syria, in Egypt.
[00:21:28.441 --> 00:21:30.043]  I have a stack of news articles here.
[00:21:32.009 --> 00:21:54.831]  uh... where the radical islamicists uh... attacked christians churches and in some cases killing more than a hundred people per church they would blow them up during christmas services uh... catholic churches uh... orthodox churches all those ancient churches and reportedly uh... in syria they would tell them as they bombed them and the people run out they would shoot them uh... leave syria
[00:21:55.732 --> 00:22:02.437]  You are invading, even though these Christians were there for a thousand years before there were any Islamicists in Syria.
[00:22:02.437 --> 00:22:08.041]  Syria is, next to like Galilee in Israel, the oldest seat of Christianity.
[00:22:08.041 --> 00:22:10.122]  Just a little news flash for everybody.
[00:22:10.122 --> 00:22:17.948]  Syria is, next to Israel, the oldest Christian settlements in the world.
[00:22:20.592 --> 00:22:22.074]  Let's just get that straight.
[00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:25.878]  Islamist students torch buildings at university in Egypt.
[00:22:25.878 --> 00:22:28.541]  Christian bombings kill 34 in Iraq.
[00:22:28.541 --> 00:22:33.047]  Reuters, Christmas Day bombing, you know, kill 37.
[00:22:33.047 --> 00:22:37.272]  Christmas attack shows security challenges in Iraq, Afghanistan.
[00:22:37.272 --> 00:22:38.834]  But notice the media didn't want to report.
[00:22:38.834 --> 00:22:40.315]  You could find it, but it was in the back of the paper.
[00:22:41.036 --> 00:22:47.739]  Or hidden on the internet that there were just hundreds of attacks all over Syria killing the Christians.
[00:22:47.739 --> 00:22:48.479]  That's where it really happened.
[00:22:48.479 --> 00:22:52.481]  But see, our government's openly funding the Islamists to do this?
[00:22:52.481 --> 00:22:57.843]  Kenyan police seek youths over Christmas Day, church burnings, Reuters, on and on and on.
[00:22:57.843 --> 00:22:59.484]  I think I'll stop right there.
[00:22:59.484 --> 00:23:01.865]  And folks know that I'm not, quote, an Islamophobe.
[00:23:03.157 --> 00:23:10.860]  In fact, the neocons, they were busy getting rid of our Bill of Rights and Constitution in the eight years before Obama got in.
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:16.502]  And of course, the Democrats more than happy to use all that power now and all that unconstitutional garbage to say the Tea Party are the new enemy.
[00:23:16.502 --> 00:23:18.242]  You notice that happened.
[00:23:18.242 --> 00:23:24.305]  You notice the whole Homeland Security apparatus is pointed at anybody who's not a total criminal.
[00:23:24.305 --> 00:23:25.825]  Anybody who actually loves freedom.
[00:23:25.825 --> 00:23:29.286]  Anybody who actually cares about having a future.
[00:23:29.286 --> 00:23:30.507]  Who doesn't have a criminal instinct.
[00:23:31.345 --> 00:23:34.047]  I don't care whether you're a classical liberal, libertarian, or conservative.
[00:23:34.047 --> 00:23:37.609]  These people are literally demonizing us and coming after us.
[00:23:37.609 --> 00:23:40.191]  This is a political purge.
[00:23:40.191 --> 00:23:44.994]  Total creepville.
[00:23:44.994 --> 00:23:52.699]  And my issue is, they always say, Alex, you say there's no radical Islam, and you say that Bush with TNT blew up the World Trade Center.
[00:23:52.699 --> 00:23:53.360]  I never said that.
[00:23:54.890 --> 00:24:14.808]  I said criminal elements in our government have been funding radical Islam since they took the keys away from the British Empire, and Hitler had it during World War II when he took over the Middle East and North Africa, and they have used those groups to menace the world and to take over countries, and then now they use them to attack us so they can then take our rights.
[00:24:14.808 --> 00:24:20.894]  And it doesn't mean they totally run them, they just fund them, open the door for them, let them come in and attack in a false flag.
[00:24:21.772 --> 00:24:28.075]  Just like Richard Nixon, it's been declassified, was going to bomb his own RNC and blame it on his political enemies.
[00:24:28.075 --> 00:24:31.257]  It's called a frame-up.
[00:24:31.257 --> 00:24:34.178]  The oldest thing in the book in criminology.
[00:24:34.178 --> 00:24:36.059]  It is ancient.
[00:24:36.059 --> 00:24:38.200]  Framing someone.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.603]  Look at who has the motive to get all this power, all this control, set up a police state in the name of fighting Al Qaeda.
[00:24:43.603 --> 00:24:51.147]  Meanwhile, they are turning them loose in North Africa, Central Africa, Western Africa, Eastern Africa.
[00:24:51.835 --> 00:24:54.979]  Al-Qaeda, they bring Al-Qaeda in.
[00:24:54.979 --> 00:25:01.445]  It came out in the Ivory Coast this year in mainstream news.
[00:25:01.445 --> 00:25:09.034]  We covered the reports there at the time that the governments in multiple countries in Africa said, listen, we're pro-West, we're Christian.
[00:25:11.212 --> 00:25:21.942]  You are giving Al-Qaeda control of these oil refineries and then they pull out when the special forces or the mercenaries show up and you just use it to steal our national refineries in the name of protecting them.
[00:25:21.942 --> 00:25:23.203]  You are running Al-Qaeda!
[00:25:23.979 --> 00:25:27.021]  And then the Prime Minister gets shot the next day after he says that.
[00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:28.321]  I mean, folks, let me explain.
[00:25:28.321 --> 00:25:29.822]  This is 101.
[00:25:29.822 --> 00:25:33.925]  You want to take over, take everybody's freedom, get trillions of no-bid contracts?
[00:25:33.925 --> 00:25:37.667]  You go fund hundreds of thousands of crazy jihadis.
[00:25:37.667 --> 00:25:39.928]  You give them high-tech weapons in Benghazi.
[00:25:39.928 --> 00:25:44.570]  You let them go on complete rampages worldwide.
[00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:48.673]  The public doesn't know the difference between a Shiite and a Sunni, a Wahhabiist.
[00:25:48.673 --> 00:25:52.675]  So you tell them, the public, give your rights up or Al-Qaeda will kill you.
[00:25:54.002 --> 00:26:05.035]  This is 101 strategy and the general public has no idea how things even work and it's very frustrating to me to sit here
[00:26:06.403 --> 00:26:13.828]  And to watch radical Islam, the very tip of the spear of radical Islam, funded by the criminals that have hijacked our government.
[00:26:13.828 --> 00:26:18.571]  And that's another reason Obama and all these people need to be impeached.
[00:26:18.571 --> 00:26:25.456]  Because before they were a little more sneaky, back in Jimmy Carter's day, funding and creating Al Qaeda and the Taliban.
[00:26:25.456 --> 00:26:28.438]  In 1979, Brzezinski's written three books bragging about it since then.
[00:26:28.438 --> 00:26:29.639]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[00:26:29.639 --> 00:26:31.821]  They admit to these crimes.
[00:26:31.821 --> 00:26:33.642]  His National Security Advisor is Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:26:35.182 --> 00:26:37.983]  They've been smarter since then, you know, to cover it up.
[00:26:37.983 --> 00:26:39.363]  Now they don't even care!
[00:26:39.363 --> 00:26:55.907]  They just openly, here, here's TOW missiles, here's heat-seeking missiles, here's anti-tank missiles, here's heavy artillery, here's Al-Qaeda, here's armored vehicles, here's air support, go take over, blow up churches, murder everybody!
[00:26:55.907 --> 00:27:01.888]  The Pentagon now admits, I was watching C-SPAN earlier in the week,
[00:27:05.612 --> 00:27:07.876]  We had it on in the back and I was up here working.
[00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:11.221]  So I just kept walking in like watching 30 minutes of this, 30 minutes of that.
[00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:15.789]  And I was watching this C-SPAN event on Middle Eastern Studies from Georgetown.
[00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:18.113]  And they had this top professor in there.
[00:27:19.597 --> 00:27:22.278]  He was from Qatar, and they were just admitting all this.
[00:27:22.278 --> 00:27:28.620]  Well, the American plan did quite well to break up Iraq and destabilize it, and now it's in total turmoil.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.321]  And we appreciate that in Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
[00:27:31.321 --> 00:27:34.302]  And now our program is to destabilize everyone but us.
[00:27:34.302 --> 00:27:44.345]  And it's all these professors in media there, and all these policy wonks, they all know how things work, because they've been involved in setting the policy.
[00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:52.800]  And I'm sitting there watching them admit this on national television!
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.781]  But I know that only policy wonks watch that.
[00:27:55.781 --> 00:28:00.022]  C-SPAN has a tiny audience, usually, unless it's got big debate feeds or whatever.
[00:28:00.022 --> 00:28:01.302]  They could have millions watching.
[00:28:01.302 --> 00:28:05.463]  But they might have had maybe 10,000 people watching it, and it's all professors and policy wonks.
[00:28:05.463 --> 00:28:08.324]  And what I'm telling you is, that's why I get so angry and frustrated.
[00:28:08.604 --> 00:28:10.785]  They're all admitting all this.
[00:28:10.785 --> 00:28:14.747]  You notice everything I talk about keeps coming true because it already had come true.
[00:28:14.747 --> 00:28:16.768]  I'm not predicting anything.
[00:28:16.768 --> 00:28:19.070]  This stuff's already going on.
[00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.651]  I tell you about it, later they have to admit it.
[00:28:21.651 --> 00:28:23.272]  You go, oh, you predicted that.
[00:28:23.272 --> 00:28:24.593]  I didn't predict this.
[00:28:25.313 --> 00:28:29.294]  They're hiding in plain view like an elephant in a room!
[00:28:29.294 --> 00:28:36.835]  The Republican leadership with foreign banks, with the Democratic leadership wrote Obamacare as a foreign corporate tax!
[00:28:36.835 --> 00:28:44.037]  And now Boehner and all of them are trying to destroy the Tea Party so they can bankrupt this country!
[00:28:44.037 --> 00:28:45.197]  It's very frustrating.
[00:28:45.197 --> 00:28:46.937]  Alright, I've covered two stories now.
[00:28:46.937 --> 00:28:48.857]  I'm gonna give you the number.
[00:28:48.857 --> 00:28:50.178]  I want to get your take when we come back.
[00:28:50.178 --> 00:28:51.398]  I'm gonna give the number and open the phones out.
[00:28:53.103 --> 00:28:56.685]  I want to get your calls on what's going to happen in 2013 into 2014.
[00:28:56.685 --> 00:29:00.366]  Stay with us.
[00:29:00.366 --> 00:29:01.387]  The facts are in.
[00:29:01.387 --> 00:29:02.807]  The studies are legion.
[00:29:02.807 --> 00:29:10.311]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:29:10.311 --> 00:29:14.133]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:29:14.133 --> 00:29:14.713]  Simple.
[00:29:14.713 --> 00:29:19.115]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:29:19.415 --> 00:29:25.139]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:29:25.139 --> 00:29:41.151]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Lite Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:46.036]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:29:46.036 --> 00:29:48.198]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[00:29:48.198 --> 00:29:53.764]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:29:53.764 --> 00:29:58.169]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[00:29:58.169 --> 00:29:59.450]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:00.251 --> 00:30:06.054]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:30:06.054 --> 00:30:13.437]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:30:13.437 --> 00:30:16.779]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:30:16.779 --> 00:30:18.540]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:23.463]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:30:23.463 --> 00:30:26.385]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:30:26.385 --> 00:30:32.348]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:30:32.348 --> 00:30:36.011]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:30:36.011 --> 00:30:41.054]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:30:41.274 --> 00:30:44.496]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:44.496 --> 00:30:50.479]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:30:50.479 --> 00:30:52.621]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[00:30:52.621 --> 00:30:58.144]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:58.144 --> 00:30:59.525]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:09.511]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:31:09.511 --> 00:31:17.916]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:31:17.916 --> 00:31:22.799]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:28.643]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:28.683 --> 00:31:29.464]  We're good to go.
[00:31:51.644 --> 00:31:57.947]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:31:57.947 --> 00:32:00.429]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:00.429 --> 00:32:02.330]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:05.971]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[00:32:05.971 --> 00:32:10.514]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:32:10.514 --> 00:32:12.855]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride.
[00:32:13.075 --> 00:32:16.640]  And up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:27.634]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:32:27.634 --> 00:32:30.318]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[00:32:30.478 --> 00:32:34.101]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:32:34.101 --> 00:32:51.435]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:32:51.435 --> 00:32:56.739]  Get your ProPure with the new Pro1 filters today at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:33:01.365 --> 00:33:04.949]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.949 --> 00:33:13.658]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:15.539]  We are on the march.
[00:33:15.539 --> 00:33:18.703]  The empire is on the run.
[00:33:18.703 --> 00:33:22.426]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:25.928 --> 00:33:28.550]  I want to hear what you think was the biggest story of 2013.
[00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:33.293]  Not just the biggest stories that mainstream media covered.
[00:33:33.293 --> 00:33:41.798]  Miley Cyrus licking on wrecking balls, or other distractions, or what Kyanne West or Justin Bieber did.
[00:33:41.798 --> 00:33:43.459]  No, I want to hear from you.
[00:33:44.634 --> 00:34:02.393]  When you think the biggest story really was and what you think is going to happen in 2014, it's such a critical year, not just here but worldwide as so many events converge together in really a socio-economic political ripple effect or almost pre-singularity.
[00:34:03.787 --> 00:34:05.489]  Massive changes are happening everywhere.
[00:34:05.489 --> 00:34:11.797]  The toll-free number to join us on those subjects I just mentioned is 877-789-ALEX.
[00:34:11.797 --> 00:34:13.299]  877-789-2539.
[00:34:13.299 --> 00:34:16.864]  That's a different number than weekdays.
[00:34:16.864 --> 00:34:20.328]  Weekdays, the network takes the calls and we take them from Minnesota.
[00:34:20.328 --> 00:34:21.589]  I'm based here in Austin, Texas.
[00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:26.216]  And on the Sunday Show, it's all produced right here in Austin, Texas, from South Austin.
[00:34:26.216 --> 00:34:26.856]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:34:26.856 --> 00:34:26.977]  877-789-2539.
[00:34:26.977 --> 00:34:29.440]  And it's wide open, as long as your phone has good audio quality.
[00:34:37.984 --> 00:34:43.266]  I tell you, phones just get worse and worse, and studies show that, both cell phones and landlines.
[00:34:43.266 --> 00:34:46.028]  Unless you're talking about Skype or other systems like that.
[00:34:46.028 --> 00:34:48.649]  So again, I think we're gonna start taking more Skype calls.
[00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:52.331]  We should set it up where we can take FaceTime calls.
[00:34:52.331 --> 00:34:53.551]  Do you ever think about that, guys?
[00:34:53.551 --> 00:34:58.994]  We can give out a FaceTime number and do what talk radio hasn't done and revolutionize stuff.
[00:34:58.994 --> 00:35:03.216]  Boom, I want that in the new studio, where we have a FaceTime number.
[00:35:03.216 --> 00:35:05.037]  And then it can come in like three, four in queue,
[00:35:06.221 --> 00:35:10.426]  Or take one as it comes in, put it on air.
[00:35:10.426 --> 00:35:15.592]  You'll have to screen it, though, if it's a video call, to make sure it's not a naked woman or something.
[00:35:15.592 --> 00:35:18.795]  But it's the Internet, and, you know, we can have a delay.
[00:35:18.795 --> 00:35:20.137]  Oh, my gosh.
[00:35:20.137 --> 00:35:20.417]  Watch.
[00:35:20.417 --> 00:35:22.460]  Glenn Beck will be doing this next week.
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.922]  That's all they do is listen to my show, but that's fine.
[00:35:24.922 --> 00:35:25.703]  I love it.
[00:35:25.703 --> 00:35:26.845]  That's my broadcast as well.
[00:35:28.055 --> 00:35:29.636]  It's good to be innovating things here.
[00:35:29.636 --> 00:35:31.396]  All I want to do is beat tyranny.
[00:35:31.396 --> 00:35:34.638]  The greatest compliment is imitation, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:34.638 --> 00:35:36.059]  See, I want to have more brainstorms.
[00:35:36.059 --> 00:35:38.260]  I want to innovate like I used to do.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:45.743]  I've gotten bigger, so I'm always busy trying to keep all the other operations running, and I'm not innovating like I've been wanting to, but we're about to innovate.
[00:35:46.873 --> 00:35:53.300]  It's so frustrating, but we're so close to the redesigns on the new sites, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:36:06.013]  We are so close, just almost ready with that, and we've got the new TV studio done rolling out in the next few weeks, and we've got the reporters online and trained and up to speed doing a great job, and the crew.
[00:36:06.693 --> 00:36:12.236]  And the financial funding with our sponsors and the products we sell at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:14.038]  It is such a blessing.
[00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:18.340]  2014 is going to be a key year for the InfoWar.
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.661]  Believe it.
[00:36:19.661 --> 00:36:22.343]  Okay, so coming up in the next segment, your phone calls.
[00:36:22.343 --> 00:36:26.005]  Now let me continue with some of the other articles.
[00:36:27.029 --> 00:36:27.930]  Exclusive!
[00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:28.210]  U.S.
[00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:32.653]  government urged the name CEO to run Obamacare.
[00:36:32.653 --> 00:36:34.515]  Reuters is reporting.
[00:36:34.515 --> 00:36:38.077]  Isn't that just special?
[00:36:38.077 --> 00:36:49.005]  And again, they're going to put it into a whole process, and oh my gosh, the CEO will fix it, and Congress has got to agree to whatever the CEO wants, Obama's puppet, or we won't make it work.
[00:36:49.005 --> 00:36:52.708]  See, you create something that's a ripoff, you claim it's an accident,
[00:36:53.547 --> 00:37:07.326]  Written by the insurance companies to increase prices and protect them from losses and make you buy their products and lower the quality of care and so many other things and give government control all your data and make your data public where they can share it.
[00:37:07.326 --> 00:37:10.450]  I mean that's what it is a giant 10,000 page screw job.
[00:37:11.886 --> 00:37:15.129]  And they tell you, oh, we're going to polish this dropping.
[00:37:15.129 --> 00:37:18.852]  We're going to put perfume and lipstick on this giant 800-pound pig.
[00:37:18.852 --> 00:37:22.735]  We're going to tell you it's Eddie Page, Marilyn Monroe.
[00:37:22.735 --> 00:37:25.457]  We're going to tell you it's Kate Upton.
[00:37:25.457 --> 00:37:29.660]  You're like, that looks like an obese pig to me with, you know, warts all over it.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.902]  And they're like, well, that's because you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:37:31.902 --> 00:37:34.344]  I'm like, it's wallowing in mud and oinking.
[00:37:34.344 --> 00:37:35.605]  They're like, no, it's not.
[00:37:35.605 --> 00:37:36.646]  It's wearing a swimsuit.
[00:37:38.979 --> 00:37:39.839]  That's Obamacare.
[00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:44.920]  It's a giant fat pig with warts all over it, in a bikini.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.341]  And I mean, it's just, they're telling you it's Marilyn Monroe.
[00:37:49.341 --> 00:37:50.742]  So that's what's going on here.
[00:37:50.742 --> 00:37:54.422]  And I predicted this with my experts like Dr. Blaylock and others.
[00:37:54.422 --> 00:38:00.223]  Before it happened, we told you what they were going to do, because they've done it in other countries.
[00:38:00.223 --> 00:38:00.743]  Here's another one.
[00:38:00.743 --> 00:38:03.064]  White House looks to spread good Obamacare news.
[00:38:04.796 --> 00:38:11.441]  And they basically go on to admit in this report that there's no way they can do it from Politico, that there is no good news.
[00:38:11.441 --> 00:38:13.523]  But it's going to be a bunch of propaganda.
[00:38:13.523 --> 00:38:14.324]  You're a winner!
[00:38:14.324 --> 00:38:16.705]  Don't let the Republicans win!
[00:38:16.705 --> 00:38:17.826]  Support Obamacare!
[00:38:17.826 --> 00:38:28.094]  When the Republican leadership had more to do with creating this rape job than the Democrats did.
[00:38:28.094 --> 00:38:29.856]  The Republican blue-blood leadership
[00:38:31.053 --> 00:38:44.119]  Literally conceived of this abomination 10 years ago as the ultimate wet dream screw job for foreign mega banks of direct taxes for corporations on the American people.
[00:38:44.119 --> 00:38:48.661]  And the Democrats, they love it because it'll bankrupt America, so they're all on the same team.
[00:38:48.661 --> 00:38:49.902]  They want to collectivize this.
[00:38:49.902 --> 00:38:51.623]  This is it.
[00:38:51.623 --> 00:38:58.025]  It's the ultra-rich funding centralization, folks, and authoritarian moves towards autocratic systems.
[00:38:58.025 --> 00:38:58.606]  MSNBC
[00:39:00.287 --> 00:39:05.573]  Dyson says Phil Robertson and Duck Dynasty part of majority white supremacist culture.
[00:39:05.573 --> 00:39:07.796]  And I told you that that was coming.
[00:39:07.796 --> 00:39:08.056]  You see?
[00:39:09.076 --> 00:39:10.437]  Free speech is racist.
[00:39:10.437 --> 00:39:11.377]  Guns are racist.
[00:39:11.377 --> 00:39:15.319]  The NRA is the Klan, even though they were founded to arm blacks to fight the Klan.
[00:39:15.319 --> 00:39:16.420]  Facts don't matter!
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.900]  Obamacare is a great deal!
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.601]  I'm racist, if I don't agree with it.
[00:39:19.601 --> 00:39:20.642]  So I agree with it.
[00:39:20.642 --> 00:39:22.183]  No, don't call me racist.
[00:39:22.183 --> 00:39:25.144]  Oh my goodness, political correctness and being trendy.
[00:39:25.144 --> 00:39:35.389]  Oh my gosh, I would get in a fetal position and urinate all over myself on the ground in a catatonic state begging if someone called me racist.
[00:39:35.389 --> 00:39:36.770]  Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
[00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:41.012]  This is what they're doing now, see?
[00:39:41.012 --> 00:39:44.195]  Now, if someone's allowed to have free speech, it's racist.
[00:39:44.195 --> 00:39:47.898]  Now if somebody can say, I like women, not men, that's racist.
[00:39:47.898 --> 00:39:49.639]  I happened to be surfing through the television today.
[00:39:49.639 --> 00:39:57.345]  I hardly ever watch TV, but they had an episode of the new Two and a Half Men on FX or something, and so I started watching it.
[00:39:59.512 --> 00:40:04.993]  Whenever I watch it, I realize that I am responsible for Charlie Sheen not being the main character on it.
[00:40:04.993 --> 00:40:08.794]  I mean, on record, I'm sitting there watching it.
[00:40:08.794 --> 00:40:21.738]  And then it goes to commercial and comes back, and I watched most of the show, and the whole show was promoting people to be homosexual.
[00:40:21.738 --> 00:40:26.219]  And I'm like, talk about overselling and being beat over the head.
[00:40:26.219 --> 00:40:27.259]  What is the agenda here?
[00:40:28.018 --> 00:40:29.779]  Well, this is the only right you're going to have.
[00:40:29.779 --> 00:40:31.639]  You're going to have NSA spying on you.
[00:40:31.639 --> 00:40:34.921]  Foreign banks are going to take money out of your bank account and make you buy Obamacare.
[00:40:34.921 --> 00:40:35.961]  They're going to devalue the dollar.
[00:40:35.961 --> 00:40:37.702]  There's going to be no future in America.
[00:40:37.702 --> 00:40:40.263]  But by golly, we're going to have gay people getting married.
[00:40:42.532 --> 00:40:47.095]  It's just a huge distraction to make us all fight with each other.
[00:40:47.095 --> 00:40:51.437]  And I know I'm stating the obvious here, but it's just to see the brainwashing.
[00:40:51.437 --> 00:40:52.458]  To see the agenda.
[00:40:52.458 --> 00:40:55.840]  And then I flipped to some other news channel, and they were saying the same thing.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:02.044]  And then I flipped to another channel, and it was just all they were doing was GAY GAY GAY GAY GAY GAY GAY GAY GAY!
[00:41:02.717 --> 00:41:08.141]  And then I went to brunch at a restaurant, and they had the news on without the audio, and it was GAY GAY GAY GAY GAY!
[00:41:08.141 --> 00:41:12.083]  And then I got in my car, I was listening to talk radio, and it was GAY GAY GAY GAY GAY!
[00:41:12.083 --> 00:41:17.307]  And I'm just like, and I walk in here and the stacks of articles they're printing off, GAY GAY GAY GAY!
[00:41:17.307 --> 00:41:20.649]  And I'm just like, my God, is there anything else going on here?
[00:41:20.649 --> 00:41:23.551]  I mean, this is like sexual harassment, folks.
[00:41:25.776 --> 00:41:34.794]  I mean, if I tuned into the news channels and they were like, yeah, sex with women, sex with women, men and women having sex, men and women having sex just over and over again, I'd be like, why is that all they talk about?
[00:41:34.794 --> 00:41:36.438]  It's like being beat over the head.
[00:41:37.403 --> 00:41:39.085]  You get sick of it.
[00:41:39.085 --> 00:41:41.547]  I'm just sick of the social engineering.
[00:41:41.547 --> 00:41:43.689]  And then parents aren't parents and dads are bad.
[00:41:43.689 --> 00:41:44.930]  And that's the other message.
[00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:49.193]  The men are all attacked and heterosexuals were being made fun of on Two and a Half Men.
[00:41:49.193 --> 00:41:50.154]  That was the other part.
[00:41:50.154 --> 00:41:55.779]  So it's not just gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.
[00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:59.422]  It was men bad, masculine men bad, family bad.
[00:41:59.422 --> 00:42:04.247]  I'm just like, what type of society are these screwballs trying to set up here?
[00:42:04.907 --> 00:42:10.908]  I mean, I'm living in the middle of a frickin' Twilight Zone at this point.
[00:42:10.908 --> 00:42:12.769]  No wonder mainstream media is dying.
[00:42:12.769 --> 00:42:16.330]  No wonder people want to look at a bunch of rednecks praying around the table.
[00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:24.512]  Because people know this trendy culture has brought us depression, and collapse, and mindlessness, and vapidness, and shallowness.
[00:42:24.512 --> 00:42:29.373]  And so people are like, maybe hillbillies in camo with big beards are gonna give me salvation.
[00:42:31.172 --> 00:42:32.993]  People are looking for leadership.
[00:42:32.993 --> 00:42:34.194]  They're looking for something else.
[00:42:34.194 --> 00:42:41.358]  When we come back, I've got the clip of MSNBC run by the White House saying that there's a majority white supremacist culture.
[00:42:41.358 --> 00:42:45.500]  And that statement means the majority white population are white supremacists.
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.081]  Let me give you a news flash.
[00:42:47.081 --> 00:42:49.502]  Whites are basically 50% of the population.
[00:42:49.502 --> 00:42:50.443]  Most of them are old.
[00:42:50.443 --> 00:42:55.866]  There's not going to be any white people to point your finger at another generation and say, there's the bad man.
[00:42:55.866 --> 00:42:59.108]  Say goodnight to the bad guy, to quote Tony Montana.
[00:43:00.461 --> 00:43:01.502]  The facts are in.
[00:43:01.502 --> 00:43:02.902]  The studies are legion.
[00:43:02.902 --> 00:43:10.406]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:43:10.406 --> 00:43:14.228]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:43:14.228 --> 00:43:14.809]  Simple.
[00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:19.531]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:43:19.531 --> 00:43:24.974]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:43:25.254 --> 00:43:30.779]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[00:43:30.779 --> 00:43:41.588]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:43:41.588 --> 00:43:43.430]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:44.170]  We're good to go.
[00:44:05.981 --> 00:44:08.202]  The highest cancer rates on the planet.
[00:44:08.202 --> 00:44:13.766]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:44:13.766 --> 00:44:15.707]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:44:15.707 --> 00:44:17.348]  We are what we eat.
[00:44:17.348 --> 00:44:22.011]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:44:22.011 --> 00:44:26.234]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:44:26.234 --> 00:44:28.515]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:44:28.795 --> 00:44:35.017]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:45:00.207 --> 00:45:10.891]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:45:10.891 --> 00:45:12.752]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:45:12.952 --> 00:45:13.812]  Fluoride.
[00:45:13.812 --> 00:45:15.753]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:45:15.753 --> 00:45:22.336]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:45:22.336 --> 00:45:27.259]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:45:27.259 --> 00:45:33.562]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:45:33.562 --> 00:45:35.983]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:45:35.983 --> 00:45:38.924]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:45:38.924 --> 00:45:42.306]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:45:42.426 --> 00:45:47.869]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:47:12.186 --> 00:47:18.208]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:47:18.208 --> 00:47:20.749]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:25.436 --> 00:47:36.944]  We got loaded phone lines and I'm going to start taking them before this hour ends and then all through the next hour interspersed with a lot of news that I haven't gotten to yet and breaking news that is unfolding as we speak.
[00:47:36.944 --> 00:47:43.868]  New TSA news, new NSA news, new laws allowing driverless cars all over the country.
[00:47:43.868 --> 00:47:46.550]  We're going to break that down and what that means for you and your family.
[00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:49.512]  I'm going to tell you where the driverless car situation is going.
[00:47:50.438 --> 00:47:53.245]  You're gonna have to pay a lot extra if you don't have a robot driving your car.
[00:47:53.245 --> 00:47:53.866]  That's where it's going.
[00:47:53.866 --> 00:47:55.891]  I'm gonna tell you the rest of the story coming up.
[00:47:57.213 --> 00:47:58.114]  Total control.
[00:47:58.114 --> 00:48:04.660]  We're going to be getting into the whole cashless society and what's really behind the target cards.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.823]  Millions of those being hacked and identities being stolen.
[00:48:07.823 --> 00:48:13.829]  We have a special video report up on InfoWars.com breaking that down right now.
[00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:21.336]  We also have tycoon Robert Wilson gives away 800 million fortune before jumping to his death.
[00:48:22.239 --> 00:48:26.843]  In New York City, all of that and more is coming up today.
[00:48:26.843 --> 00:48:37.372]  But again, you didn't know that Phil Robertson wasn't just a homophobe for saying, man, he's sick of the whole gay mafia agenda?
[00:48:37.372 --> 00:48:46.939]  Constantly just parroting and promoting an agenda even to children in schools?
[00:48:46.939 --> 00:48:49.562]  And of course, Robertson's now been restated onto the show.
[00:48:50.509 --> 00:48:52.490]  Because of the incredible backlash.
[00:48:52.490 --> 00:49:02.017]  Well, now MSNBC host has come out and said, well, this is part of the white supremacist majority.
[00:49:02.017 --> 00:49:04.419]  And of course, the only majority is white in this country.
[00:49:04.419 --> 00:49:06.160]  It's aging.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:10.683]  It's providing the folks that are taking care of them with jobs.
[00:49:10.683 --> 00:49:13.686]  I've got to say, I'm not into white supremacist ideas.
[00:49:13.686 --> 00:49:15.527]  I love all cultures and groups.
[00:49:15.527 --> 00:49:19.210]  But man, it's kind of weird to know that Europe has one point
[00:49:20.086 --> 00:49:22.508]  Three replacement rates for every two adults.
[00:49:22.508 --> 00:49:24.670]  They have 1.3 kids.
[00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:34.178]  I'm not Japanese, but to know the Japanese went from a 1.3 to now a 1.0 and men won't marry women and women won't marry men and it's a total collapse.
[00:49:34.178 --> 00:49:38.182]  I'm watching civilizations die.
[00:49:38.182 --> 00:49:46.990]  And it is very, very upsetting to watch the industrialized world committing suicide and the establishment media helping grease the skids for it.
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:53.306]  But then I can't run to the third world because it's collapsing into tyranny.
[00:49:53.306 --> 00:49:56.090]  I'm telling you, this world is getting crazy.
[00:49:56.090 --> 00:50:05.062]  Because it's easier to be evil if you're a social engineer and part of the power structure and to rationalize that that's a good idea and that the public doesn't deserve to be uplifted.
[00:50:06.428 --> 00:50:13.535]  And to make people dependent than it is to really try to play by the rules of humanity and build up society.
[00:50:13.535 --> 00:50:17.919]  And so that's why things are so bad and they're going to get a lot worse before they get better.
[00:50:17.919 --> 00:50:20.622]  But we're here exposing the real agenda.
[00:50:20.622 --> 00:50:21.703]  That's the good news.
[00:50:21.703 --> 00:50:28.890]  But before I go to your calls, I thought I'd play this clip of the demonization.
[00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:29.952]  I told you it was coming.
[00:50:30.796 --> 00:50:33.977]  That Phil Robertson was a racist with no proof.
[00:50:33.977 --> 00:50:37.299]  Because MSNBC's called me deeply racist and then show no proof.
[00:50:37.299 --> 00:50:42.901]  They just say deeply racist like saying Barack Obama eats children's brains every morning.
[00:50:42.901 --> 00:50:43.761]  And then moving along.
[00:50:43.761 --> 00:50:46.543]  Of course, there's no proof he does that.
[00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:51.985]  I imagine that's the kind of stuff goes on with all the flies that are... He had flies landing on him again at a press conference.
[00:50:51.985 --> 00:50:52.345]  I mean, it's like...
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.061]  The devil or something.
[00:50:55.061 --> 00:50:56.583]  It's like anima-ville horror.
[00:50:56.583 --> 00:51:03.732]  But the point is, is that it'd be like saying Hillary Clinton went to the moon and not having proof.
[00:51:03.732 --> 00:51:06.174]  So now they're again race baiting.
[00:51:06.174 --> 00:51:08.637]  They're screwing everybody, cheating everybody.
[00:51:09.537 --> 00:51:18.743]  We should all be unified around due process and liberty and free market and what made America great and what works and what we know doesn't work is socialism and collectivism.
[00:51:18.743 --> 00:51:24.067]  Instead, it's all, no, fight with each other over sexual preferences, over religion, over race.
[00:51:24.067 --> 00:51:28.670]  Fight with each other while the establishment robs you seven ways to Sunday.
[00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:29.771]  Divide and conquer.
[00:51:29.771 --> 00:51:30.932]  Balkanization.
[00:51:30.932 --> 00:51:32.193]  Oldest trick in the book.
[00:51:32.193 --> 00:51:34.154]  The Romans wrote volumes on it.
[00:51:34.154 --> 00:51:36.296]  I've read at least five books I can remember.
[00:51:37.608 --> 00:51:42.834]  By Roman generals and Roman emperors about how they would divide and conquer people.
[00:51:42.834 --> 00:51:47.359]  And I'm telling you, stuff written 2,050 years ago by Julius Caesar.
[00:51:47.359 --> 00:51:49.642]  The Battle for Gaul.
[00:51:49.642 --> 00:51:52.325]  A collection of letters to the Senate.
[00:51:52.325 --> 00:51:52.825]  Go read it!
[00:51:52.825 --> 00:51:55.408]  Used to be required reading in like the 10th grade.
[00:51:55.408 --> 00:51:55.969]  That's when I read it.
[00:51:58.198 --> 00:52:00.179]  And everybody's like, we have to read this, oh, boring.
[00:52:00.179 --> 00:52:02.661]  It was every chapter was incredible.
[00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:11.306]  Every chapter was like five, six, seven battles, how they divided one group from the other, how to manipulate groups where they were invading in other areas.
[00:52:11.306 --> 00:52:16.669]  This has worked real good with the Germans, and this works real good with the French, called the Gauls.
[00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:22.873]  And then I read the slave manuals on how to control black slaves.
[00:52:22.873 --> 00:52:24.154]  It's exactly the same stuff.
[00:52:24.154 --> 00:52:25.816]  And later, it was in the news.
[00:52:25.816 --> 00:52:30.779]  I think it was Walter Williams, like 15 years ago, wrote about it.
[00:52:30.779 --> 00:52:39.046]  How they got these Caribbean manuals in French translated into English, admitting it came from Roman slave manuals that were mainly white slaves.
[00:52:40.572 --> 00:52:48.666]  And you're sitting here going, wow, they still use old Roman slave manuals of divide and conquer on us today.
[00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:49.748]  Because it works!
[00:52:49.748 --> 00:52:52.372]  Because those people 2,000 years ago were just like us!
[00:52:54.144 --> 00:52:54.705]  We're good to go.
[00:53:20.253 --> 00:53:23.414]  And I just want people to become aware of the manipulation.
[00:53:23.414 --> 00:53:31.095]  Because you're smart folks, you've learned how to be cool, or how to like football, or how to invest in the phony stock market, the facade.
[00:53:31.095 --> 00:53:45.978]  But if you learned how the world really worked, and learned about how the establishment wants to keep you distracted with petty issues, and celebrity and all this other garbage, they want to keep you distracted because they don't want you involved in the real game of life.
[00:53:45.978 --> 00:53:47.598]  The real things that are going on around us.
[00:53:49.039 --> 00:54:11.293]  But again, here is the hardcore, red-hot poker of race politics, race hustling, limousine, authoritarian liberals, sticking a hot poker into our flesh and then pouring salt in the wound, saying, you know what, free speech is racist, and the majority in America, white people are all supremacist, and they need to go down.
[00:54:12.352 --> 00:54:16.436]  This is the type of warfare they engage in on MSNBC.
[00:54:16.436 --> 00:54:16.777]  Here it is.
[00:54:32.654 --> 00:54:33.675]  I want to say this, folks.
[00:54:33.675 --> 00:54:34.596]  I would like to see people.
[00:54:34.596 --> 00:54:34.736]  People.
[00:54:59.687 --> 00:55:01.349]  I don't care what color you are.
[00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:07.414]  These are the folks always talking about color because they're the race managers.
[00:55:07.414 --> 00:55:10.137]  And I'm not saying the old civil rights movement was bad, no.
[00:55:10.137 --> 00:55:17.564]  I'm saying the new groups in control are total manipulators with an agenda of division.
[00:55:17.564 --> 00:55:20.067]  Meet the new boss same as the old boss.
[00:55:20.067 --> 00:55:22.049]  If I'm walking down the street and I see a painter,
[00:55:23.584 --> 00:55:26.966]  I don't look if they're Hispanic, black, white, or who they are.
[00:55:26.966 --> 00:55:32.089]  If it's a neat painting, I admire them and I want to talk to them.
[00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:39.774]  If I'm sitting in a bar ordering dinner and there's an old black guy sitting there and he's interesting and has a lot of great points, I admire him.
[00:55:39.774 --> 00:55:42.555]  I see electricity in his eyes, his humanity.
[00:55:42.555 --> 00:55:43.476]  I pick up on it.
[00:55:43.476 --> 00:55:44.797]  I feel drawn to him.
[00:55:44.797 --> 00:55:46.958]  I like him.
[00:55:46.958 --> 00:55:48.119]  I want to go fishing with him.
[00:55:48.934 --> 00:55:51.959]  It's an old white man, a woman, a Hispanic.
[00:55:51.959 --> 00:55:52.560]  I don't care.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.605]  I like humanity and cool people.
[00:55:55.605 --> 00:56:00.633]  But I don't like big gangs of people who say, oh, whites are all in a gang, bring them down.
[00:56:05.131 --> 00:56:17.576]  The truth is, humanity needs to get in a gang promoting liberty and freedom together and realize the globalists are the main gang trying to divide us so we can't come together around basic Bill of Rights, basic Constitution.
[00:56:17.576 --> 00:56:19.717]  That's the larger plan.
[00:56:19.717 --> 00:56:25.579]  And what's sick is, everything the establishment does in the name of equality is meant to create inequality.
[00:56:27.765 --> 00:56:30.926]  Alright, listen, I'm gonna go to break, come back, we'll take calls the next hour.
[00:56:30.926 --> 00:56:33.147]  I didn't get to them this hour, but I will next hour.
[00:56:33.147 --> 00:56:41.551]  Andrew, Chris, Dennis, Phyllis, Brad, Phillip, Dennis, Jason, Gabrielle, Sean, Dustin, Hunter, and more!
[00:56:41.551 --> 00:56:49.755]  I will take your calls as soon as we come back at the start of the next hour, and then I'll have to wait to the last segment of the show to get to all this other news.
[00:56:50.615 --> 00:56:53.438]  On driverless cars and the big secret behind those.
[00:56:53.438 --> 00:56:59.023]  The latest MSNBC attack on the Second Amendment.
[00:56:59.023 --> 00:57:04.348]  The latest attack on the Second Amendment via shutting down lead bullets.
[00:57:04.348 --> 00:57:05.490]  We're going to get into
[00:57:07.079 --> 00:57:18.224]  Key info about federally funded highway DNA checkpoints sprouting up nationwide that are going from voluntary to mandatory as we warned you they would.
[00:57:18.224 --> 00:57:29.770]  All this and more coming up in the second hour of this worldwide transmission and social workers worldwide are taking children from their parents that are overweight
[00:57:30.851 --> 00:57:37.775]  But then also not letting the kids exercise at school, banning tag, banning athletics, claiming it's dangerous.
[00:57:37.775 --> 00:57:44.599]  So the nanny state bans kids playing outside, but then when your kid becomes overweight eating GMO, they take them from you.
[00:57:44.599 --> 00:57:46.541]  It's incredible attack on the family.
[00:57:46.541 --> 00:57:47.001]  Stay with us.
[00:57:50.447 --> 00:57:59.529]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:57:59.529 --> 00:58:07.930]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:12.811]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:58:12.811 --> 00:58:18.692]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowars.com.
[00:58:18.712 --> 00:58:19.492]  We're good to go.
[00:58:41.661 --> 00:58:47.964]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:58:47.964 --> 00:58:49.865]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:49.865 --> 00:58:53.507]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:58:53.507 --> 00:58:58.510]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:05.694]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:59:05.834 --> 00:59:11.459]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:59:11.459 --> 00:59:15.483]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:59:15.483 --> 00:59:20.207]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:59:20.207 --> 00:59:25.432]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:59:25.672 --> 00:59:28.914]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[00:59:28.914 --> 00:59:31.415]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[00:59:31.415 --> 00:59:36.178]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[00:59:36.178 --> 00:59:39.059]  Hand Crank Shortwave AM FM Radios.
[00:59:39.059 --> 00:59:46.263]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our Info War possible.
[00:59:46.263 --> 00:59:47.544]  We're getting prepared.
[00:59:47.544 --> 00:59:48.204]  Are you?
[00:59:48.204 --> 00:59:48.984]  InfoWarshop.com
[00:59:51.519 --> 00:59:55.104]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:59:55.104 --> 00:59:58.309]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:08.675]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.675 --> 01:00:12.276]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:13.437]  All right, it's second hour.
[01:00:13.437 --> 01:00:17.179]  Let's go right to Andrew from Pennsylvania.
[01:00:17.179 --> 01:00:20.581]  Thanks for calling in on the last Sunday transmission of 2013.
[01:00:20.581 --> 01:00:23.242]  What do you think's coming up in 2014, Andrew?
[01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:28.613]  Well, um, can I start with the biggest story of 2013 first?
[01:00:28.613 --> 01:00:29.313]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:29.313 --> 01:00:30.334]  You bet.
[01:00:30.334 --> 01:00:41.620]  Yeah, I think that would have to be the Snowden leaks and specifically the fact that all the people lost in the Matrix do not understand that NSA spying has nothing to do with national security and everything to do with tyranny.
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:42.961]  That's the sad part about it.
[01:00:42.961 --> 01:00:43.861]  I agree with you.
[01:00:43.861 --> 01:00:51.526]  I think the biggest story of 2013 is Obamacare, along with the Syria war, not
[01:00:52.952 --> 01:00:56.156]  Materializing like they wanted it to, and the Snowden.
[01:00:56.156 --> 01:00:59.980]  I think those three things are the trifecta that all come together.
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:04.185]  And it's the year that Dinosaur Media began to fully collapse.
[01:01:04.185 --> 01:01:07.729]  I don't know, there's so many things.
[01:01:07.729 --> 01:01:12.615]  What do you think was... I mean, I guess you just told us, but what do you think of those other stories?
[01:01:14.253 --> 01:01:18.036]  Oh, uh, the Syria thing reminds me of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[01:01:18.036 --> 01:01:22.258]  They had to lie to go to war, and fortunately this time, it backfired.
[01:01:22.258 --> 01:01:24.900]  I mean, uh, that's pretty significant, isn't it?
[01:01:25.623 --> 01:01:29.105]  I totally agree with you, and I think of everything.
[01:01:29.105 --> 01:01:36.790]  Probably the Snowden thing was the straw that broke the camel's back, because they'd always said, we don't spy on you like East Germany.
[01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:38.651]  Don't believe the conspiracy theorist.
[01:01:38.651 --> 01:01:46.135]  And then exactly what we'd warned them about turned out to be true, because there'd been other whistleblowers before, and the whole thing blew up in their face.
[01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:47.796]  I think you might be right.
[01:01:47.796 --> 01:01:49.337]  We'll have to ask the other callers.
[01:01:49.337 --> 01:01:51.459]  Is Snowden the biggest story of 2013?
[01:01:51.459 --> 01:01:52.079]  What do you see in 2014?
[01:01:54.887 --> 01:02:02.813]  Well, I think the government and the New World Order are going to look like the Three Stooges, and I can tell you where I get that idea.
[01:02:02.813 --> 01:02:21.748]  Andrew Bartzis, who happens to hold the rare ability of accessing Akashic Records, has pointed out that entities that are a jokester race have stopped picking on the common people and are now picking on the New World Order, and if we do our part to help, it's going to look really Three Stooges-like, with leaks coming out and everything, and they're going to look really stupid.
[01:02:21.748 --> 01:02:23.209]  That's what my prediction for 2014 is going to be.
[01:02:24.554 --> 01:02:26.415]  Alright, well I appreciate your call.
[01:02:26.415 --> 01:02:27.556]  Who knows?
[01:02:27.556 --> 01:02:30.638]  There's just so much crazy stuff in this world.
[01:02:30.638 --> 01:02:31.119]  I know this.
[01:02:31.119 --> 01:02:33.920]  I got a Breitbart article I saw on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.103]  Woman hypnotizes priest, steals church donations.
[01:02:38.103 --> 01:02:44.368]  And that article ties into a mind control story where the Russians spent a billion dollars on mind control.
[01:02:44.368 --> 01:02:45.828]  They spent a lot more than that, folks.
[01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:47.450]  We're going to be breaking that down as well.
[01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:49.231]  Chris in Florida, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:02:51.397 --> 01:02:58.039]  Well, Alex, I'd agree that with the case of Syria, it's the first time in history that educated U.S.
[01:02:58.039 --> 01:03:05.321]  troops have openly boycotted a threatened police action, preventing it from ever happening.
[01:03:05.321 --> 01:03:05.681]  That's right.
[01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:19.505]  They start the civil war funding al-Qaeda three years ago, and they act like, oh, we've got to fix this problem, getting rid of a bad guy to put something in 50 times worse, and the military said no, the word got out, and it all came out, our government runs al-Qaeda.
[01:03:19.505 --> 01:03:20.625]  Huge defeat for the globalists.
[01:03:21.886 --> 01:03:31.738]  Indeed, and with Fukushima, it's been going on for three years now, so thanks for offering solutions, including your entrepreneur activism, and bringing that.
[01:03:31.738 --> 01:03:37.325]  That's probably the biggest issue in my book, but also for revolutionizing the future.
[01:03:38.546 --> 01:03:39.206]  What is it?
[01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:41.408]  So is it a conference or something about that?
[01:04:08.396 --> 01:04:18.838]  Yes, that's the, uh, that's the, uh, it's called the Green Energy Exposition, and it's at the Museum of Science and Industry, 4801 East Fowler Avenue in Tampa.
[01:04:18.838 --> 01:04:29.880]  And, uh, what he has are, uh, well, various types of technologies, and the admission is free, by the way, but there are vendors who will have, uh, kits, for example, uh, because it is called HHO.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.181]  And where is your booth?
[01:04:31.181 --> 01:04:32.661]  Where is your booth so folks can visit it?
[01:04:33.823 --> 01:04:34.584]  I don't have a booth.
[01:04:34.584 --> 01:04:36.906]  I'm just trying to promote it because I believe... No, I hear you.
[01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.187]  It's incredibly exciting.
[01:04:38.187 --> 01:04:44.773]  They came in with all this fake green energy to just steal money and not get us on to all the new truly green energies.
[01:04:44.773 --> 01:04:51.218]  Again, the globalists are masters at creating a counterfeit for any new movement that'll challenge their hegemonic rule.
[01:04:51.218 --> 01:04:56.423]  Then they stifle innovation, stifling the species and their own children in the process.
[01:04:56.983 --> 01:04:58.304]  That's the old reap what you sow.
[01:04:58.304 --> 01:04:59.545]  Stay with us, more calls straight ahead.
[01:04:59.545 --> 01:05:06.411]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine.
[01:05:06.411 --> 01:05:10.214]  A practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:05:10.214 --> 01:05:12.056]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:05:12.256 --> 01:05:13.136]  Fluoride.
[01:05:13.136 --> 01:05:15.056]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:15.056 --> 01:05:21.638]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:05:21.638 --> 01:05:26.558]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:05:26.558 --> 01:05:32.880]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.300]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.240]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:41.621]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:05:41.741 --> 01:05:47.165]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:47.165 --> 01:05:52.269]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[01:06:10.685 --> 01:06:14.788]  Take your Drozak.
[01:06:14.788 --> 01:06:17.030]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:18.291]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:06:18.291 --> 01:06:19.392]  Mao took the guns.
[01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:20.933]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:06:20.933 --> 01:06:21.533]  They helped us.
[01:06:36.383 --> 01:06:41.849]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our fire!
[01:06:41.849 --> 01:06:45.694]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:06:45.694 --> 01:06:54.684]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility, and every form of tyranny of the mind.
[01:06:58.462 --> 01:07:00.504]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:07:00.504 --> 01:07:02.045]  Drop the hammer!
[01:07:02.045 --> 01:07:08.952]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:08.952 --> 01:07:10.693]  Ah yeah!
[01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:14.277]  Surging into 2014.
[01:07:14.277 --> 01:07:16.999]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:20.663]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:07:21.741 --> 01:07:23.321]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.

[01:07:30.183 --> 01:07:39.286]  We are the hardest working operation in media because we love the fight and taking down the tyrants.
[01:07:39.286 --> 01:07:47.488]  So much of life is about having a spirit of liberty, the spirit of survival, the spirit of fight in you.
[01:07:49.304 --> 01:07:55.346]  I'm not the toughest guy around, but if you get in a fight with me, you're going to get 110% right back.
[01:07:55.346 --> 01:08:08.170]  But back when I was a big weightlifter and more of a jock in college, I had a lot of buddies that were UT football players, and we'd go out and have a few beers or be at some party, and they'd start arm wrestling.
[01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:11.411]  And I would arm wrestle folks because they would, you know, hey, get over here.
[01:08:11.411 --> 01:08:16.853]  And I wasn't that big, 180 pounds, but I could bench press about 350 pounds at my healthiest.
[01:08:18.249 --> 01:08:22.812]  And a lot of times I would end up beating guys that weighed 300 pounds that nobody could beat.
[01:08:22.812 --> 01:08:23.953]  They were like, how are you doing that?
[01:08:23.953 --> 01:08:25.094]  I never had any training in it.
[01:08:25.094 --> 01:08:26.334]  I would get mad.
[01:08:26.334 --> 01:08:32.518]  But at first it would only be when, at first they'd almost beat me, but then I just couldn't lay down and be beaten.
[01:08:32.518 --> 01:08:34.680]  And then I would surge and beat them.
[01:08:36.534 --> 01:08:43.796]  And I hadn't arm wrestled in years, and I was at a little company event, and I was arm wrestling the shipping department's champion arm wrestler.
[01:08:43.796 --> 01:08:49.178]  And he was beating me at first, even as an old man of 40 years old, I beat him once he almost beat me.
[01:08:49.178 --> 01:08:53.059]  But it was so incredible, I had no strength until he was about to beat me.
[01:08:53.059 --> 01:08:55.020]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.201]  I couldn't wake up, I couldn't get angry, I couldn't focus.
[01:08:58.201 --> 01:09:02.262]  Now I've got torn muscles in my bicep, but the point is I won.
[01:09:03.752 --> 01:09:05.374]  And that's the frustration of getting old.
[01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:10.518]  It won't matter sometime down the road how angry I get, the young guys are going to be able to beat me.
[01:09:10.518 --> 01:09:13.201]  25-year-old guy is going to be able to beat me.
[01:09:13.201 --> 01:09:16.504]  The muscle-bound 25-year-old will be able to beat the old man.
[01:09:16.504 --> 01:09:22.969]  But I'm still not old yet, and that's really my great frustration, is I don't have enough strength in the fight for liberty.
[01:09:22.969 --> 01:09:26.773]  I don't have enough gusto and zest for what my spirit wants.
[01:09:26.773 --> 01:09:28.975]  I want to work 24 hours a day fighting tyranny.
[01:09:30.572 --> 01:09:31.953]  I want to beat these people.
[01:09:31.953 --> 01:09:33.214]  I take it personal.
[01:09:33.214 --> 01:09:36.257]  I'm totally committed.
[01:09:36.257 --> 01:09:38.980]  Because I know they don't like humanity.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:40.321]  The globalists are parasites.
[01:09:40.321 --> 01:09:41.522]  They're control freaks.
[01:09:41.522 --> 01:09:42.983]  They're sadists.
[01:09:42.983 --> 01:09:45.165]  And I am just a fan of humanity.
[01:09:45.165 --> 01:09:47.147]  I like seeing people empowered.
[01:09:47.147 --> 01:09:49.129]  I like seeing people successful.
[01:09:49.129 --> 01:09:54.013]  I like seeing people share liberty together in free association.
[01:09:54.013 --> 01:09:55.655]  And the globalists are the opposite of that.
[01:09:55.655 --> 01:09:56.836]  These are really bad people.
[01:09:58.084 --> 01:10:00.746]  And the fruits of the New World Order are political death.
[01:10:00.746 --> 01:10:01.787]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:10:01.787 --> 01:10:07.151]  Dennis, and Phyllis, and Brad, and Phillip, and Jason, and Gabrielle, and Dustin Hunter.
[01:10:07.151 --> 01:10:09.213]  We're going to go to all of your calls.
[01:10:09.213 --> 01:10:13.436]  Dennis in Canada, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:10:13.436 --> 01:10:15.278]  Yes, hi Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:10:15.278 --> 01:10:16.719]  You bet brother, good to talk to you.
[01:10:16.719 --> 01:10:22.183]  The biggest story of 2013 was the China launching an aircraft carrier.
[01:10:22.183 --> 01:10:24.325]  Do you see that as the beginning of a new Cold War?
[01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:26.094]  Absolutely, they say it is.
[01:10:26.094 --> 01:10:28.374]  They've got nuclear targeting in the U.S.
[01:10:28.374 --> 01:10:32.596]  Our government under Clinton gave them all the missile secrets, all the ICBM MIRV technology.
[01:10:32.596 --> 01:10:34.217]  They've launched a giant blue water navy.
[01:10:34.217 --> 01:10:36.677]  They have more helicopters than the United States has.
[01:10:36.677 --> 01:10:40.239]  They're launching drone programs and they've been given all the weapons to do it.
[01:10:40.859 --> 01:10:42.560]  It is a total sellout of America.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:50.942]  The globalists have chosen China as the new global ruler, the new sole imperial UN peacekeeping enforcer.
[01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:53.363]  America and Russia are to be brought down.
[01:10:53.363 --> 01:10:58.084]  America and Russia are to be de-industrialized, sterilized, and brought down.
[01:10:58.084 --> 01:11:06.007]  America and Russia should be teamed up together to lead the world into the future, not sold out by a bunch of bankers.
[01:11:06.007 --> 01:11:06.987]  I mean, it's so sick.
[01:11:09.629 --> 01:11:15.433]  The other big story, obviously, I have to agree with Andrew, the previous caller was about Edward Snowden.
[01:11:15.433 --> 01:11:15.954]  Yes.
[01:11:15.954 --> 01:11:20.017]  And do you see all that culminating in the Olympics in Russia?
[01:11:20.017 --> 01:11:24.239]  Because apparently Snowden is in Russia?
[01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:26.421]  Well, you know, they just tried to bomb the Olympics over there.
[01:11:26.421 --> 01:11:28.542]  We even have some footage of it.
[01:11:28.542 --> 01:11:31.745]  The head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Bandar, said
[01:11:33.354 --> 01:11:39.922]  Three months ago on television, if the Russians don't stop aiding Assad in Syria, they'll start bombing Russia with Al-Qaeda they control.
[01:11:39.922 --> 01:11:42.925]  And a big bomb went off today, killing at least 15.
[01:11:42.925 --> 01:11:44.287]  More than 50 have been injured.
[01:11:44.287 --> 01:11:46.609]  More will probably die, unfortunately.
[01:11:46.609 --> 01:11:50.073]  Dramatic footage of the facility being bombed there.
[01:11:51.074 --> 01:11:53.815]  But listen, I agree Snowden is ultra-massive.
[01:11:53.815 --> 01:11:59.696]  What do you make of the Syria war imploding and everybody learning that our government's running Al-Qaeda?
[01:11:59.696 --> 01:12:02.476]  What do you make of Benghazigate?
[01:12:02.476 --> 01:12:07.397]  What do you make of Obamacare blowing up in Obama's face and people not buying it?
[01:12:07.397 --> 01:12:09.398]  I mean, do you really think Snowden's the biggest story?
[01:12:09.398 --> 01:12:11.018]  Because I think you may be right.
[01:12:11.018 --> 01:12:14.279]  It's just 2013 has been so momentous, I can't decide.
[01:12:15.555 --> 01:12:41.307]  I see, well, if I could speak about the Syrian war, I see it as, if you look on a strategic map of Syria, and you follow the pipeline that heads northeast, it goes right up into Kurdistan, and they say that there's enough oil in Kurdistan, I don't know how long it would last, or what their reserves are, but basically the oil bubbles out of the ground there, and it seems like as if they're just trying to take over Syria
[01:12:42.176 --> 01:12:52.783]  Send that pipeline straight up into Kurdistan, get all the oil out, send it to Aleppo or whatever the capital is on the Mediterranean.
[01:12:52.783 --> 01:12:54.064]  And that's how I see it.
[01:12:54.064 --> 01:12:56.565]  I see it as a strategic move.
[01:12:56.565 --> 01:12:57.446]  Oh yeah, no.
[01:12:57.446 --> 01:13:06.132]  Israel, the people running the United States, the EU, the French are really behind it because they've gotten promised about 40% of that pipeline's money.
[01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:07.512]  That's their stake in it.
[01:13:07.512 --> 01:13:09.654]  They all admit it's about a pipeline.
[01:13:10.054 --> 01:13:25.001]  They'll kill a million Christians, they'll destroy the whole country, they'll turn it over to Al-Qaeda, they'll sexually mutilate all the women, they'll put burkas on their heads, kick them out of college, and you'll never hear a word from the liberal-caused celeb media because Obama's a Peace Prize winner.
[01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:25.941]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:13:25.941 --> 01:13:27.262]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[01:13:28.641 --> 01:13:28.881]  Yeah, hi.
[01:13:55.515 --> 01:13:56.215]  First off, I'm 64.
[01:13:56.215 --> 01:13:57.996]  I took Latin in high school.
[01:13:57.996 --> 01:14:00.716]  I read the Roman Emperor's General Corruption.
[01:14:00.716 --> 01:14:05.157]  When I read the ACA in 2010, I recognized so much of it is all globalism.
[01:14:05.157 --> 01:14:05.678]  That's it.
[01:14:05.678 --> 01:14:10.879]  You read Roman Emperor documents where they're communicating with the elite how to screw the people.
[01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:15.520]  You watch the news, you're like, my gosh, they are following Roman Emperor science.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:22.102]  Because Roman Emperor science was the best control system against all those other corrupt countries and empires the world ever found.
[01:14:22.102 --> 01:14:23.522]  And they haven't developed better
[01:14:24.222 --> 01:14:39.624]  Well, I came across your program today, so forgive me, I thought the biggest story was Benghazi, and I really want that investigated and impeachments and all that, but I'm learning so much just listening to today's show.
[01:14:41.218 --> 01:14:43.098]  So what do you think the biggest story is?
[01:14:43.098 --> 01:14:44.919]  I mean, is it NSA?
[01:14:44.919 --> 01:14:46.739]  Is it Snowden?
[01:14:46.739 --> 01:14:49.940]  Is it the mainstream media collapsing this year?
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:51.861]  Is it Benghazigate?
[01:14:51.861 --> 01:14:53.961]  Is it Obamacare falling on its face?
[01:14:53.961 --> 01:14:55.642]  I think the callers are probably right.
[01:14:55.642 --> 01:15:03.884]  It's not even the fact that Al Qaeda works for our government and our government staging these attacks all over the world, illegitimate elements of it.
[01:15:03.884 --> 01:15:08.645]  I think it probably is the Snowden revelations because that's what woke the sheeple up.
[01:15:09.690 --> 01:15:10.110]  Yep.
[01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:11.371]  And the globalism.
[01:15:11.371 --> 01:15:13.932]  Yep.
[01:15:13.932 --> 01:15:14.972]  What do you think is coming in 2014?
[01:15:14.972 --> 01:15:17.854]  More globalism.
[01:15:17.854 --> 01:15:18.394]  Yeah.
[01:15:18.394 --> 01:15:26.517]  I'm praying so hard that we can change Congress, but there's so much in the ACA that cannot be.
[01:15:26.517 --> 01:15:28.498]  The tentacles can't be ripped out of it.
[01:15:28.498 --> 01:15:31.379]  There's so much of it that's already written in.
[01:15:31.379 --> 01:15:36.982]  Exactly, but we've got to point out whose tentacles are behind it, that the globalists are the main authors.
[01:15:37.896 --> 01:15:41.017]  Of our discontent, of our discontent, of the problems.
[01:15:41.017 --> 01:15:43.078]  God bless you, appreciate your call.
[01:15:43.078 --> 01:15:50.100]  This is our last Sunday show of 2013, but I'll be back next Sunday in 2014 with a live transmission, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:50.800]  Central.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.481]  But we have a weekday show, so never fear, fellow InfoWarriors.
[01:15:54.481 --> 01:15:57.642]  I'll be here, gibbering and jabbering like a broken clock.
[01:15:57.642 --> 01:15:58.042]  Stay with us.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:05.327]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:08.451]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:16:08.451 --> 01:16:14.020]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:15.622]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:16:15.922 --> 01:16:17.563]  We are what we eat.
[01:16:17.563 --> 01:16:22.246]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:16:22.246 --> 01:16:26.448]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[01:16:26.448 --> 01:16:29.010]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:35.253]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[01:16:35.253 --> 01:16:38.215]  To learn more, visit InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:16:38.215 --> 01:16:45.039]  The site is literally packed with audio and video featuring top health professionals who don't bow down to Big Pharma.
[01:16:45.279 --> 01:16:51.325]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you, and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired, and obese.

[01:17:00.493 --> 01:17:01.514]  The facts are in.
[01:17:01.514 --> 01:17:02.915]  The studies are legion.
[01:17:02.915 --> 01:17:10.421]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:17:10.421 --> 01:17:14.245]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:17:14.245 --> 01:17:14.825]  Simple.
[01:17:14.825 --> 01:17:19.549]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:17:19.549 --> 01:17:22.772]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[01:17:22.952 --> 01:17:25.274]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:17:25.274 --> 01:17:30.959]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[01:17:30.959 --> 01:17:41.588]  Using six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:17:41.588 --> 01:17:43.430]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:46.152]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:17:46.152 --> 01:17:48.313]  I use Fluoride Shield everyday.

[01:17:58.281 --> 01:17:59.561]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[01:18:00.482 --> 01:18:09.565]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:18:09.565 --> 01:18:17.687]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:18:17.967 --> 01:18:22.828]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:29.630]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:36.712]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:18:36.792 --> 01:18:43.817]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:18:43.817 --> 01:18:48.321]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:18:48.321 --> 01:18:58.008]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:18:58.008 --> 01:18:59.669]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:11.077]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:19:11.077 --> 01:19:13.139]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:19:13.139 --> 01:19:14.019]  Fluoride.
[01:19:14.019 --> 01:19:15.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:22.525]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:19:22.525 --> 01:19:27.448]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:19:27.448 --> 01:19:30.190]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ index.
[01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:30.950]  We're good.
[01:20:01.519 --> 01:20:05.130]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:08.319]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:16.821]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:20:16.821 --> 01:20:21.963]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:21.963 --> 01:20:24.784]  That's right, more of your calls coming up here in just a moment.
[01:20:24.784 --> 01:20:28.826]  First off, we had an article up on Infowars.com Friday.
[01:20:28.826 --> 01:20:35.068]  Judge falls for the big lie about the NSA a federal judge ruled on Friday.
[01:20:35.068 --> 01:20:36.369]  Judge William Pauly III
[01:20:37.569 --> 01:20:48.857]  That the NSA can spy on us because they were spying on Al-Qaeda, the same Al-Qaeda that criminal elements of our government are publicly funding worldwide.
[01:20:48.857 --> 01:20:49.978]  And this is an example.
[01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:56.002]  Two weeks ago, a federal judge ruled that it was a violation of the Fourth Amendment and that a lawsuit could go forward.
[01:20:56.002 --> 01:20:58.884]  So in a separate case, they had them speed it up and say, oh no,
[01:20:59.997 --> 01:21:01.598]  We're only doing this to protect you.
[01:21:01.598 --> 01:21:05.020]  This is the same lie of eight years ago that it was supposedly for Al Qaeda.
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:06.921]  And then it turned out it was for domestic groups.
[01:21:06.921 --> 01:21:15.466]  And they're using it for economic data and spying on the Associated Press and spying on talk radio hosts and spying on Christian preachers.
[01:21:15.466 --> 01:21:18.528]  The establishment wants to know what people are doing.
[01:21:18.528 --> 01:21:20.990]  There's a reason this has always been illegal.
[01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:23.031]  There's a reason we have due process.
[01:21:23.031 --> 01:21:25.032]  There's a reason we have checks and balances.
[01:21:25.032 --> 01:21:26.333]  Because if you get rid of them,
[01:21:28.095 --> 01:21:32.140]  All hell will break loose and you're opening the gates to total tyranny.
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:35.044]  That's the big threat, what we now see happening.
[01:21:35.044 --> 01:21:42.493]  And notice, as the due process leaves, as the liberty leaves, the prosperity leaves.
[01:21:42.493 --> 01:21:44.356]  This has happened over and over again in history.
[01:21:44.356 --> 01:21:46.799]  It's happening right down here and all over the West.
[01:21:48.783 --> 01:21:51.985]  And I just wanted to point out that this is a deception.
[01:21:51.985 --> 01:21:58.929]  They went and found one little area of the giant NSA, CIA, private corporate spy grid.
[01:21:58.929 --> 01:22:03.331]  They went and found one teeny little, little edge of it.
[01:22:03.331 --> 01:22:06.693]  Little tiny part.
[01:22:06.693 --> 01:22:12.797]  And made the whole debate about, well in this case, it's about Al Qaeda, so the whole thing's okay.
[01:22:12.797 --> 01:22:13.497]  See how they do that?
[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:18.822]  It's amazing how they play these games.
[01:22:18.822 --> 01:22:21.545]  Here's another one on the London Independent.
[01:22:21.545 --> 01:22:26.150]  IT firms lose billions after NSA scandal exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.
[01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:33.719]  And it goes on to break down how these companies are making hundreds of billions, hundreds of billions every few years.
[01:22:35.487 --> 01:22:38.450]  Off gathering the data, which they then sell on top of it.
[01:22:56.732 --> 01:22:59.414]  We've got another report coming out tomorrow detailing this.
[01:22:59.414 --> 01:23:09.481]  The Washington Post reported back in 2006, Target is the number one data mining company that has retail operations in the country.
[01:23:09.481 --> 01:23:16.306]  And they have actually consulted with the FBI and NSA on how best to track their customers.
[01:23:16.306 --> 01:23:22.391]  And their largest business, of any product they sell, is selling your data.
[01:23:24.168 --> 01:23:25.489]  And I'd forgotten about that.
[01:23:25.489 --> 01:23:31.293]  David Knight texted me, one of our reporters tonight, and said, have you seen this report out of the Washington Post?
[01:23:31.293 --> 01:23:36.417]  In fact, guys, will you hand me my little NSA tracker robot that they call an iPhone?
[01:23:36.417 --> 01:23:37.698]  I want to actually find that article.
[01:23:37.698 --> 01:23:39.099]  I want to show folks that.
[01:23:39.099 --> 01:23:41.321]  David texted me that, and I said, oh, I'd forgot about that.
[01:23:41.321 --> 01:23:44.783]  Yeah, do a report on that tomorrow for the nightly news.
[01:23:44.783 --> 01:23:49.127]  But this is the type of issue we're talking about, ladies and gentlemen, that
[01:23:53.892 --> 01:23:55.163]  Here I am actually pulling it up.
[01:23:56.411 --> 01:23:58.752]  That this type of stuff goes on.
[01:23:58.752 --> 01:24:01.893]  You don't really believe Target just lost those millions of credit cards, do you?
[01:24:01.893 --> 01:24:02.413]  No.
[01:24:02.413 --> 01:24:10.556]  They're going to use that to discredit regular credit cards and force you onto RFID, which is even easier to rob and scan.
[01:24:10.556 --> 01:24:14.957]  And then after that, it's going to go to pure face scan thumbprint to buy and sell.
[01:24:14.957 --> 01:24:20.519]  Then they're going to outlaw all other transactions and have internet IDs and control free speech.
[01:24:20.519 --> 01:24:22.719]  Watch my full report on InfoWars.com.
[01:24:22.719 --> 01:24:23.920]  I want to go back to your calls.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.781]  In the interest of time, but here it is.
[01:24:26.781 --> 01:24:28.803]  Knight sent me this.
[01:24:28.803 --> 01:24:34.987]  You guys can give me a document cam for TV viewers on my iPhone, and I'll show folks the Washington Post article.
[01:24:34.987 --> 01:24:36.227]  There it is.
[01:24:36.227 --> 01:24:40.070]  Retailer Target branches out into police work.
[01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:46.114]  Oh, you didn't know they take all your purchases and run them through police databases.
[01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:47.214]  And then you read the article.
[01:24:47.214 --> 01:24:49.496]  It's like, actually, they've always been involved in that.
[01:24:50.796 --> 01:24:53.417]  They taught the NSA everything they know.
[01:24:53.417 --> 01:24:57.740]  They're run by a shadowy Pentagon group out of Minnesota.
[01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:01.582]  Oh, but they're trendy and liberal, so it makes it okay.
[01:25:01.582 --> 01:25:05.203]  There's the Washington Post.
[01:25:05.203 --> 01:25:07.485]  Go see my report at Infowars.com.
[01:25:07.485 --> 01:25:08.225]  Okay.
[01:25:08.225 --> 01:25:12.307]  Man, there's so much to hit and so many calls.
[01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:15.129]  This is a short segment, longer segment coming up.
[01:25:15.129 --> 01:25:17.190]  Let me just briefly remind you of something here.
[01:25:18.325 --> 01:25:23.975]  This broadcast is listener supported, and so I have tried to find the very best products I can.
[01:25:23.975 --> 01:25:27.402]  You've got the incredible high mountain volcanic soil, totally organic.
[01:25:29.278 --> 01:25:33.880]  In Southern Mexico, in Chiapas, it's even better than Guatemalan coffee right over the border.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:41.244]  And I've been drinking this stuff for 10 years, finally found a connection beyond fair trade, right to the Chiapas farmers.
[01:25:41.244 --> 01:25:44.686]  I bought a large shipment of it, but it's gonna sell out soon.
[01:25:44.686 --> 01:25:46.147]  We're working on getting more.
[01:25:46.147 --> 01:25:55.411]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend, Oregon Tilt level, highest level organic, full of trace minerals, just off the charts, incredible, my favorite coffee.
[01:25:55.411 --> 01:25:57.653]  And people tried it and now have,
[01:25:58.453 --> 01:25:59.975]  Been a static.
[01:25:59.975 --> 01:26:01.677]  At first the coffee wasn't selling very well.
[01:26:01.677 --> 01:26:07.062]  Now it's exploding because people actually got the coffee and the word of mouth has just gone insane.
[01:26:07.062 --> 01:26:09.705]  So I will sell out of this shipment very soon.
[01:26:09.705 --> 01:26:16.652]  Quite frankly, the next batch may be listed as Guatemalan, which is close but not as good until I get more of this incredible Chiapas coffee.
[01:26:17.568 --> 01:26:22.392]  We've also got the immune support with the special organic mushrooms infused.
[01:26:22.392 --> 01:26:25.114]  It's all up at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:26:25.114 --> 01:26:31.280]  The books, the t-shirts, the water filters discounted that cut out the fluoride, the glyphosate, the very best brands of water filters.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.541]  Promo code WATER, 10% off.
[01:26:33.541 --> 01:26:40.707]  InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com to find the incredible nascent iodine that's done wonders for myself and my family.
[01:26:41.548 --> 01:26:41.588]  No.
[01:26:54.693 --> 01:26:59.538]  Lost leader there because it's got the nascent iodine in it as well, but it's two ounce, not one ounce.
[01:26:59.538 --> 01:27:04.002]  And it's got five other compounds that supercharge the detoxing.
[01:27:04.002 --> 01:27:11.910]  So that's all available at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:16.034]  And lastly, I'm going to extend this special into the new year.
[01:27:16.034 --> 01:27:18.756]  We do this every Christmas where you can get five
[01:27:19.767 --> 01:27:32.492]  Months free when you sign up for a year at InfoWarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv to see the nightly news subscription, to see all my films in HD, to see special live events and so much more.
[01:27:32.492 --> 01:27:35.533]  11 years of this site up and running, 18 years of material.
[01:27:35.533 --> 01:27:40.295]  PrisonPlanet.tv, I'm going to extend that special a little bit into the new year.
[01:27:40.295 --> 01:27:45.737]  You can get five plus months free when you sign up for a year or get a monthly trial membership for $5.95.
[01:27:48.368 --> 01:27:52.631]  And 11 people can use the membership with the same username and passcode.
[01:27:52.631 --> 01:27:57.693]  Nobody's got a subscription site where 11 people can use it for $5.95 a month.
[01:27:57.693 --> 01:28:01.956]  Our goal is just to pay for the bandwidth, have our own system that can't be censored as easily.
[01:28:03.424 --> 01:28:04.404]  So we can get the word out.
[01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:08.786]  So again, PrisonPlanet.TV, I want to thank all the members.
[01:28:08.786 --> 01:28:21.312]  We couldn't have built this truly independent, liberty-based operation without you, and we are using our media system to help other independent media organizations, to help other activists, and to give a voice to the people.
[01:28:22.082 --> 01:28:23.342]  And the people have spoken.
[01:28:23.342 --> 01:28:24.783]  They're listening.
[01:28:24.783 --> 01:28:27.044]  Infowars is just exploding.
[01:28:27.044 --> 01:28:27.624]  Thank you.
[01:28:27.624 --> 01:28:28.984]  Thank the good Lord above.
[01:28:28.984 --> 01:28:30.845]  We are all in this together.
[01:28:30.845 --> 01:28:38.908]  Now, when we come back, no more news for a while until I've talked to Philip, Dennis, Jason, Eric, Dustin, Hunter, Jeff, and others.
[01:28:39.935 --> 01:28:42.678]  And as we hang up on each caller, you've got a chance to call in.
[01:28:42.678 --> 01:28:44.279]  The toll-free number is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:28:44.279 --> 01:28:45.540]  Open the phones up again for about a minute.
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:45.961]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:28:45.961 --> 01:28:46.041]  877-789-2539.
[01:28:46.041 --> 01:28:46.822]  I will give each caller one minute.
[01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:48.804]  On the other side, as we get to everybody, stay with us.
[01:29:00.632 --> 01:29:02.533]  Introducing Pro-1.

[01:29:06.176 --> 01:29:10.739]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:29:10.739 --> 01:29:16.843]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:29:16.843 --> 01:29:27.850]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[01:29:27.850 --> 01:29:30.452]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gate.

[01:29:34.313 --> 01:29:51.616]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia, and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:30:00.377 --> 01:30:03.400]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:08.404]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:30:08.404 --> 01:30:15.591]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:30:15.731 --> 01:30:21.356]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:30:21.356 --> 01:30:25.380]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:30.104]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:30:30.104 --> 01:30:35.329]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:30:35.569 --> 01:30:38.810]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Scalzam.
[01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:41.312]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.

[01:30:56.158 --> 01:30:58.100]  We're getting prepared, are you?
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:01.243]  Infowarsshop.com The facts are in.
[01:31:01.243 --> 01:31:02.644]  The studies are legion.
[01:31:02.644 --> 01:31:10.171]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:31:10.171 --> 01:31:13.594]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:31:13.974 --> 01:31:14.535]  Simple.
[01:31:14.535 --> 01:31:19.258]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:31:19.258 --> 01:31:24.983]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:31:24.983 --> 01:31:30.527]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[01:31:30.527 --> 01:31:41.336]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:31:41.336 --> 01:31:43.137]  Let's take a stand against the globalist.
[01:31:43.217 --> 01:31:43.477]  I think so.
[01:32:06.178 --> 01:32:13.524]  Cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:32:13.524 --> 01:32:15.466]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:32:15.466 --> 01:32:17.107]  We are what we eat.
[01:32:17.107 --> 01:32:21.771]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:32:21.771 --> 01:32:26.014]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:32:26.014 --> 01:32:28.276]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:32:28.556 --> 01:32:34.785]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:33:21.941 --> 01:33:24.182]  I'm going to go to your phone calls in the next segment.
[01:33:24.182 --> 01:33:29.344]  We'll take calls as well, but social workers from Arkansas to England.
[01:33:29.344 --> 01:33:33.286]  Your child's one pound overweight, the state's going to take them.
[01:33:33.286 --> 01:33:36.668]  And then of course they'll get even fatter and put on drugs under the state, but it doesn't matter.
[01:33:38.004 --> 01:33:41.089]  If you don't submit to it, a SWAT team will drop by.
[01:33:41.089 --> 01:33:42.171]  That's coming up.
[01:33:42.171 --> 01:33:52.207]  France has a 75% tax on the poor, 100% tax on the rich, but the ultra-rich are exempt and get the rest of the money through government.
[01:33:52.932 --> 01:33:53.853]  Corporate welfare.
[01:33:53.853 --> 01:33:57.795]  We're going to break that down from the BBC coming up as well.
[01:33:57.795 --> 01:34:01.997]  And new law allows driverless cars on Michigan roads.
[01:34:01.997 --> 01:34:04.038]  I will give you the rest of the story on that.
[01:34:04.038 --> 01:34:07.240]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:08.541]  Phillip in Florida.
[01:34:08.541 --> 01:34:09.261]  Thanks for calling.
[01:34:09.261 --> 01:34:11.883]  You're on the year worldwide.
[01:34:11.883 --> 01:34:12.823]  Hello, Alex.
[01:34:12.823 --> 01:34:13.484]  Hey, brother.
[01:34:13.484 --> 01:34:14.805]  Hey, hey.
[01:34:14.805 --> 01:34:22.269]  I think that the story of this year would be the Snowden release of information.
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:45.087]  And there's a lot of things that I've been seeing on the media and people saying certain things on the right wing and the left wing propaganda outlets that for 2014 I think we're going to continue to see a continued co-optation of the Tea Party with the fueling of Obamacare and a floundering stock market.
[01:34:46.685 --> 01:34:52.488]  By the way, I do have the predictions of Mark Faber and others that have been very accurate.
[01:34:52.488 --> 01:34:54.108]  Look at the stock market going towards $20,000.
[01:34:54.108 --> 01:35:02.712]  You've got 100 to 1 price earnings ratios that make, that's like triple what was happening in 1929.
[01:35:02.712 --> 01:35:10.055]  I mean, there's no doubt we are cruising for a collapse that has been engineered.
[01:35:10.055 --> 01:35:14.037]  And I agree with you that I think we're going to see major corrections in the stock market in 2014.
[01:35:16.235 --> 01:35:31.631]  And I think that it may either lead to a bail-in, and none of these things are going to be very popular, and I'm afraid that there may be some sort of false flag at some point that may end up dominating the news for the year.
[01:35:31.631 --> 01:35:33.913]  I agree.
[01:35:33.913 --> 01:35:37.476]  I think they're going to start a new war, they're going to stage terror attacks, they're going to
[01:35:38.832 --> 01:35:42.675]  Yeah, I think whatever happens with the stock market is going to depend on those pensions too.
[01:35:42.675 --> 01:35:44.736]  If they can't sell the carbon futures,
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:02.221]  That might also come into play.
[01:36:17.372 --> 01:36:18.392]  That is the stock market.
[01:36:18.392 --> 01:36:31.679]  As the real economy crumbles, as depression takes place, they put all the extra inflation, all the Weimar Republic, Zimbabwean garbage, wheelbarrows of money to buy a loaf of bread into the stock market.
[01:36:31.679 --> 01:36:40.404]  And when it finally goes down, they've got homeland security, not just here but worldwide, huge paramilitary forces to keep the public under control.
[01:36:40.404 --> 01:36:43.786]  So they're going to use the collapse as the smoke screen for the takeover.
[01:36:44.733 --> 01:36:45.913]  God bless you.
[01:36:45.913 --> 01:36:46.833]  Great points.
[01:36:46.833 --> 01:36:48.374]  Yeah, that caller, best caller of the day.
[01:36:48.374 --> 01:36:50.374]  We've had some great callers today, by the way.
[01:36:50.374 --> 01:36:52.535]  Let's talk to Dennis in Oregon.
[01:36:52.535 --> 01:36:53.135]  You're on the air.
[01:36:53.135 --> 01:36:55.335]  Hi, Alex.
[01:36:55.335 --> 01:36:56.815]  Hey, buddy.
[01:36:56.815 --> 01:36:57.216]  Hi.
[01:36:57.216 --> 01:37:05.917]  I think the most significant thing that we heard on your show last year was about a month ago when you told us that a return to biblical law is our only hope.
[01:37:05.917 --> 01:37:08.078]  You called it Levitical law.
[01:37:08.078 --> 01:37:14.499]  In the Old Testament, whenever a king like Solomon would forsake God's law, God would raise up an adversary to chastise him and correct him.
[01:37:15.353 --> 01:37:23.878]  No, I agree with you, and I'm not one of these fake Bible thumpers designed to make people run from God, run from basic due process, basic common sense.
[01:37:40.143 --> 01:37:59.826]  I'm a wicked person and by wicked I mean not like hurting poor people or doing really wicked stuff but I mean I'm a fleshly person and I'm attracted to bad stuff at some levels but more and more I see it and I realize it's bondage and I am repelled by evil more and more and so being repelled from it
[01:38:01.164 --> 01:38:02.805]  is stronger than being drawn to it.
[01:38:02.805 --> 01:38:07.326]  You know, wanting to get in a fight with somebody, wanting to carouse, wanting to whatever.
[01:38:07.326 --> 01:38:10.068]  You know, those thoughts that everybody has going on in their mind.
[01:38:10.068 --> 01:38:11.708]  And then I look at evil people.
[01:38:11.708 --> 01:38:13.909]  They think it's good to be more evil.
[01:38:13.909 --> 01:38:16.590]  They think being evil is powerful.
[01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:18.551]  They want to become more evil.
[01:38:18.551 --> 01:38:21.132]  They want to turn themselves over to it.
[01:38:21.132 --> 01:38:22.052]  And that's the thing.
[01:38:22.052 --> 01:38:23.933]  You don't just give in to some evil.
[01:38:23.933 --> 01:38:25.934]  You give in to it, the bottom drops out.
[01:38:27.274 --> 01:38:33.596]  And I've never been touched in my gut, my spirit, whatever you want to call it, like I've been this year.
[01:38:33.596 --> 01:38:37.538]  I feel impending doom is coming.
[01:38:37.538 --> 01:38:51.122]  Superbugs, wars, you name it, economic collapse, governments running around like a chicken with its head cut off, buying billions of bullets, thousands of armored tanks a month, training to lock down cities, take guns, you name it.
[01:38:51.122 --> 01:38:52.803]  I mean, what do you think they're getting ready for?
[01:38:55.013 --> 01:39:03.061]  Well, where I would tend to take issue with you is the assumption that common law can be traced back to biblical law.
[01:39:03.061 --> 01:39:04.502]  It's kind of like the parlor game of gossip.
[01:39:04.502 --> 01:39:10.928]  You have to go back to the original source to find out what was whispered in the first person's ear, and common law tends to morph over time.
[01:39:12.107 --> 01:39:22.494]  I mean, I was simply speaking that the reason a thousand years ago, say in England, which is the great basis of Magna Carta in 1215 and our Constitution, 1798, Declaration of Independence, 1776, July 4th,
[01:39:28.308 --> 01:39:41.037]  is that they adopted Levitical law that was the basic of Roman Catholic law when it was brought into England and the rest of Europe because it was all, it was so similar common sense is what I was saying.
[01:39:41.037 --> 01:39:46.080]  So our law is a mixture of Levitical and Anglo-Saxon law.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.322]  American law traces it back to that.
[01:39:49.322 --> 01:39:53.926]  And so, but I agree the 500 plus laws of Levitical law
[01:39:56.365 --> 01:39:59.646]  Makes a lot of sense, and I'm saying we're violating that.
[01:39:59.646 --> 01:40:05.987]  Right, and by the 1700s there were almost 200 crimes punishable by death in England.
[01:40:05.987 --> 01:40:07.348]  The Bible only requires 15.
[01:40:07.348 --> 01:40:09.968]  No, I agree.
[01:40:09.968 --> 01:40:11.309]  That became a tyranny.
[01:40:11.309 --> 01:40:11.969]  And I hear you.
[01:40:11.969 --> 01:40:12.649]  I appreciate your call.
[01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:18.010]  It's very complex legal issues you're discussing that I've tried to study for years and I'm a novice at.
[01:40:18.010 --> 01:40:20.551]  That's what's frustrating about knowledge is that
[01:40:22.406 --> 01:40:24.586]  I'm like way up here on a mountain, knowledge-wise.
[01:40:24.586 --> 01:40:30.988]  My callers are as well, but like a new listener or someone that watches mainline television, they hear this show and have no idea what we're even talking about.
[01:40:30.988 --> 01:40:34.488]  It's like, might as well be, you know, Martian gibberish or something.
[01:40:34.488 --> 01:40:36.409]  Now let's jam in one more before we go to break here.
[01:40:36.409 --> 01:40:38.889]  Let's talk to Dustin in Oklahoma.
[01:40:38.889 --> 01:40:39.590]  You're on the air.
[01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:41.570]  Go ahead.
[01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:41.950]  Hey, Alex.
[01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:42.430]  How's it going?
[01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:45.251]  Hope you guys, in four words, had a Merry Christmas and everything.
[01:40:45.251 --> 01:40:45.851]  Thank you, sir.
[01:40:45.851 --> 01:40:46.191]  We did.
[01:40:46.191 --> 01:40:46.471]  Thank you.
[01:40:46.471 --> 01:40:46.691]  Go ahead.
[01:40:47.844 --> 01:40:51.388]  Yeah, so what do I think the big story in 2013 is?
[01:40:51.388 --> 01:40:52.469]  Oh man, where do I begin?
[01:40:52.469 --> 01:41:00.417]  You have the DHS bullet by, you know, the revelation of the NSA shenanigans like PRISM and Keyscore.
[01:41:00.417 --> 01:41:04.342]  I mean, it just keeps going down the list and it's just, it's insane.
[01:41:04.342 --> 01:41:06.444]  But to answer your question, you know,
[01:41:07.188 --> 01:41:12.991]  I think that we are the biggest story of 2013, you know, the awakening, the restoration.
[01:41:12.991 --> 01:41:13.711]  I agree.
[01:41:13.711 --> 01:41:16.132]  You just said it and crystallized it, and I was thinking that today.
[01:41:16.132 --> 01:41:17.433]  You just said it.
[01:41:17.433 --> 01:41:26.256]  It's all the stories together, the war in Syria not being expanded, the NSA, Benghazi, Obamacare imploding.
[01:41:26.256 --> 01:41:31.659]  It's all part of the awakening and the loss of confidence and the 6% approval rating for Congress.
[01:41:31.659 --> 01:41:31.899]  Go ahead.
[01:41:33.396 --> 01:41:41.103]  Yeah, it's just the mass rise of neopatriotism in this nation, I think, is really what 2013 was all about.
[01:41:41.103 --> 01:41:50.852]  Just people coming together under like mind, just meeting and discussing the things that are important just to identify true humanity for what it is.
[01:41:50.852 --> 01:41:58.318]  You know, that's really going to make the waves of the next decade and onward, in my opinion.
[01:41:58.318 --> 01:41:59.099]  Very well said.
[01:41:59.099 --> 01:41:59.700]  Please continue.
[01:42:01.035 --> 01:42:05.598]  Yeah, so just moving forward to 2014, gosh, what do you expect?
[01:42:05.598 --> 01:42:08.740]  I really see things getting done, in my opinion.
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:23.569]  I think that, you know, as the, I guess, the stranglehold of socialism continues to drain the wealth of our country, we, you know, as Americans, will respond to that and just, you know, adhere to all of the
[01:42:24.116 --> 01:42:27.098]  Things that made America great in the first place.
[01:42:27.098 --> 01:42:30.101]  The documentation, the founders, what was put together.
[01:42:30.101 --> 01:42:30.781]  Exactly!
[01:42:30.781 --> 01:42:33.864]  You don't know what you've lost until it's gone.
[01:42:33.864 --> 01:42:41.650]  You're going to see all the basic common law, ancient common sense, will become the hottest thing in the future.
[01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:44.172]  And 2014 is the beginning.
[01:42:44.172 --> 01:42:48.235]  It's the key juncture to decide if we take our destiny of liberty and freedom
[01:42:48.855 --> 01:42:49.577]  In our hands.
[01:42:49.577 --> 01:42:52.944]  It's gonna be a hell of a war, but 2014 is a crossroads.
[01:42:52.944 --> 01:42:55.950]  Man, these callers are the best ever today!
[01:42:55.950 --> 01:42:58.515]  I'm on fire, and I love all of you!
[01:43:00.703 --> 01:43:02.604]  Introducing Pro-1.
[01:43:02.604 --> 01:43:06.246]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:43:06.246 --> 01:43:10.788]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:43:10.788 --> 01:43:16.891]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:43:16.891 --> 01:43:27.676]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[01:43:27.876 --> 01:43:34.378]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:43:34.378 --> 01:43:49.104]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[01:43:53.128 --> 01:44:03.437]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:44:03.437 --> 01:44:08.441]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:44:08.441 --> 01:44:15.628]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:44:15.748 --> 01:44:21.373]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:44:21.373 --> 01:44:25.417]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:44:25.417 --> 01:44:30.141]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:44:30.141 --> 01:44:35.366]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.

[01:44:38.827 --> 01:44:41.388]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:44:41.388 --> 01:44:46.089]  AeroSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:44:46.089 --> 01:44:48.990]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:55.972]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our InfoWar possible.
[01:44:56.192 --> 01:44:58.133]  We're getting prepared, are you?
[01:44:58.133 --> 01:45:00.135]  InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:45:00.135 --> 01:45:10.843]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:45:10.843 --> 01:45:12.684]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:45:12.884 --> 01:45:13.764]  Fluoride.
[01:45:13.764 --> 01:45:15.685]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:45:15.685 --> 01:45:22.268]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:45:22.268 --> 01:45:25.209]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[01:45:25.209 --> 01:45:27.189]  And the results are on record.
[01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:33.512]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:45:33.512 --> 01:45:35.933]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:45:35.933 --> 01:45:38.874]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:45:38.874 --> 01:45:42.235]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:45:42.355 --> 01:45:47.798]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:46:00.046 --> 01:46:09.135]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:46:09.135 --> 01:46:17.543]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:46:17.543 --> 01:46:22.187]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:46:22.407 --> 01:46:29.189]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:36.352]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:46:36.352 --> 01:46:43.394]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:46:43.394 --> 01:46:47.736]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:46:57.562 --> 01:47:01.745]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:47:01.745 --> 01:47:03.286]  Coast to Coast.
[01:47:03.286 --> 01:47:05.347]  Direct from Austin.
[01:47:05.347 --> 01:47:08.549]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:19.718 --> 01:47:21.339]  We are on the march.
[01:47:21.339 --> 01:47:24.481]  The empire is on the run.
[01:47:24.481 --> 01:47:29.745]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:29.745 --> 01:47:31.486]  We are on the march.
[01:47:31.486 --> 01:47:35.949]  The empire of fraud and corruption is on the run.
[01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:37.390]  We are the resistance.
[01:47:40.948 --> 01:47:43.231]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, none of us are perfect.
[01:47:43.231 --> 01:47:44.712]  None of us have all the answers.
[01:47:44.712 --> 01:47:47.816]  But we know the globalists are running things.
[01:47:47.816 --> 01:47:49.638]  There is a new world order.
[01:47:49.638 --> 01:47:51.941]  It's being set up now.
[01:47:51.941 --> 01:47:55.405]  And their hoax of saying none of this existed has now been exposed.
[01:47:55.405 --> 01:47:58.148]  The scales are off people's eyes.
[01:47:58.148 --> 01:48:00.391]  But they're still trying to figure out exactly what they're seeing.
[01:48:01.698 --> 01:48:03.779]  Let me tell you something if you're a new listener.
[01:48:03.779 --> 01:48:14.181]  The only chance we've got is admitting this is going on, studying it, and then seeing historically how others have been able to stop it.
[01:48:14.181 --> 01:48:16.322]  And the biggest issue is not complying.
[01:48:16.322 --> 01:48:19.763]  In 2014, the awakening is going to accelerate.
[01:48:19.763 --> 01:48:22.824]  I'll continue to break this down in the three-hour weekday show tomorrow.
[01:48:22.824 --> 01:48:26.805]  We'll continue this same topic of what was the biggest stories in 2013.
[01:48:26.805 --> 01:48:29.146]  Not the biggest establishment fake stories.
[01:48:29.146 --> 01:48:30.146]  The biggest to you.
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:32.661]  And then what do you see happening in 2014?
[01:48:32.661 --> 01:48:39.626]  But I tell you, the HUMET or the human intelligence I'm getting from callers is helping me understand next year.
[01:48:39.626 --> 01:48:43.669]  And I'm really connecting with what you're saying.
[01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:46.111]  And it's just such a blessing.
[01:48:46.111 --> 01:48:47.392]  It is such a blessing to be here.
[01:48:47.392 --> 01:48:49.713]  Let me mention a few stories and go back to your calls.
[01:48:49.713 --> 01:48:55.217]  Florida neighborhood bans kids from playing in the street.
[01:48:55.217 --> 01:48:57.379]  That's United Press International reporting that.
[01:48:58.373 --> 01:49:03.794]  Now, we're talking about neighborhoods where there is nothing but street in between the residential.
[01:49:03.794 --> 01:49:06.094]  And then now they say people are following orders.
[01:49:06.094 --> 01:49:07.455]  No children are seen outside.
[01:49:07.455 --> 01:49:10.355]  They'll play television and get big, fat, and obese.
[01:49:10.355 --> 01:49:13.116]  When I was a kid, my parents didn't let me stay in the house.
[01:49:13.116 --> 01:49:16.336]  Cartoons were for Saturday morning.
[01:49:16.336 --> 01:49:19.937]  The kids next door that played proto video games like Atari, they were wimps.
[01:49:19.937 --> 01:49:22.938]  We played football, baseball, and fistfights all day outside.
[01:49:22.938 --> 01:49:23.638]  Climbed trees.
[01:49:23.638 --> 01:49:24.998]  You know.
[01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:29.334]  Stole watermelons from the local farmer, you name it.
[01:49:29.334 --> 01:49:39.209]  But the whole deal is, nowadays, and I'm only a few times, you know what I mean, I lived on the edge of the city, but we could walk like five miles and find farms and, you know, some farmer would see us in their field and run us off.
[01:49:39.997 --> 01:49:45.138]  Kids now are unhealthy because they watch television all day and they play video games all day.
[01:49:45.138 --> 01:49:46.219]  But that's not the issue.
[01:49:46.219 --> 01:49:50.960]  No, just banning being on the street in Florida, because it's dangerous to be on the sidewalk.
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:51.980]  You might get hit.
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:52.920]  Here's another one.
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:57.401]  Social workers take children from families who overfeed them.
[01:49:57.401 --> 01:50:05.763]  And now with the Mass Body Index, Jakari Jackson went to one of these Walmart, one of our reporters, one of these Walmart doctor robot kiosks.
[01:50:05.763 --> 01:50:07.864]  There's video of it on prisonplanet.tv.
[01:50:09.059 --> 01:50:12.242]  And it's like, you are overweight 25 pounds.
[01:50:12.242 --> 01:50:14.263]  I mean, Jakari looks like a fitness model.
[01:50:14.263 --> 01:50:17.726]  He's not even bulky, he's just super muscular.
[01:50:17.726 --> 01:50:21.629]  And he's overweight and you will be fined under Obamacare.
[01:50:21.629 --> 01:50:28.475]  And like $5,000 extra a year because he's not a totally skinny person.
[01:50:28.475 --> 01:50:31.277]  So that's the type of news and information we've got.
[01:50:31.277 --> 01:50:32.838]  Let's continue here.
[01:50:32.838 --> 01:50:34.820]  Calorie info coming to vending machines.
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:37.222]  You know why under federal law and Obamacare that does that?
[01:50:37.927 --> 01:50:41.071]  They don't care if there's aspartame or GMO or corn syrup.
[01:50:41.071 --> 01:50:44.135]  No, it's just the total calories and they're going to tax you in the future.
[01:50:44.135 --> 01:50:46.037]  They've already said this, just like New York.
[01:50:46.037 --> 01:50:50.102]  Per bag, what it is in social engineering, you'll be penalized.
[01:50:50.102 --> 01:50:57.130]  Kind of like my buddy took his daughter to the hospital today over this bacteria that's raging across the country.
[01:50:58.377 --> 01:51:01.518]  And they're calling it flu, but I've got family that's died from it.
[01:51:01.518 --> 01:51:04.940]  Family, you know, fighting for their lives over it.
[01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:07.521]  No, it's a drug-resistant staph.
[01:51:07.521 --> 01:51:08.501]  We've now confirmed it.
[01:51:08.501 --> 01:51:09.642]  We have the name, the whole deal.
[01:51:10.424 --> 01:51:12.165]  But they go, buy flu shots, that'll protect you.
[01:51:12.165 --> 01:51:13.826]  They don't even test you when you go in and you're sick.
[01:51:13.826 --> 01:51:15.907]  It's like, oh, we're just gonna give you flu shots.
[01:51:15.907 --> 01:51:20.109]  Which can push you over the edge and kill you when you already have a bacterial infection.
[01:51:20.109 --> 01:51:23.610]  But it was nothing but illegal aliens in there getting free healthcare.
[01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:26.532]  And then in the parking lot, there's multiple rows at the hospital.
[01:51:26.532 --> 01:51:30.794]  My buddy sent it to me, I'm gonna do a story tomorrow on it, in Austin, for electric cars.
[01:51:31.374 --> 01:51:39.547]  Of course, there are no electric cars, but it's all part of this social engineering where they're going to penalize you if you don't do what the system wants.
[01:51:39.547 --> 01:51:40.528]  So here it is.
[01:51:40.528 --> 01:51:42.752]  Calorie info coming to vending machines.
[01:51:44.727 --> 01:51:48.290]  World health experts want to have sugar consumption.
[01:51:48.290 --> 01:51:50.212]  We actually ate more sugar 60 years ago.
[01:51:50.212 --> 01:51:51.533]  I've looked at the studies.
[01:51:51.533 --> 01:51:53.474]  It's the GMO that's making us obese.
[01:51:53.474 --> 01:51:54.995]  It does it to rats and things.
[01:51:54.995 --> 01:51:57.117]  I'm not saying sugar's good.
[01:51:57.117 --> 01:52:00.720]  With everything else your body's bombarded with, it does hurt your immune system.
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:01.781]  Processed sugar's bad.
[01:52:01.781 --> 01:52:03.763]  But they don't say processed sugar.
[01:52:03.763 --> 01:52:05.544]  They say fruit, you name it.
[01:52:05.544 --> 01:52:06.485]  Sugar, period.
[01:52:06.485 --> 01:52:08.126]  See how they do this?
[01:52:08.126 --> 01:52:12.290]  It's all about government controlling what you eat.
[01:52:12.290 --> 01:52:13.471]  All right, there's those reports.
[01:52:15.543 --> 01:52:23.788]  Oh look, AP, NSA grabs your computers on the way to be delivered to you and puts technology on them to spy on you without warrants.
[01:52:23.788 --> 01:52:26.110]  Non-terror related, totally illegal.
[01:52:26.110 --> 01:52:26.731]  Exposed!
[01:52:26.731 --> 01:52:29.973]  The Soviet Union spent $1 billion on mind control programs.
[01:52:29.973 --> 01:52:31.214]  The News of Australia.
[01:52:31.214 --> 01:52:32.114]  Oh really?
[01:52:32.114 --> 01:52:33.555]  What do you think our nightly news is?
[01:52:33.555 --> 01:52:34.296]  It's mind control.
[01:52:36.513 --> 01:52:38.734]  That is just some of what we're dealing with.
[01:52:38.734 --> 01:52:39.554]  Here's some more.
[01:52:39.554 --> 01:52:43.315]  France's 75% tax rate gains approval by top court.
[01:52:43.315 --> 01:52:45.316]  That's on the poor people.
[01:52:45.316 --> 01:52:46.376]  75% tax.
[01:52:46.376 --> 01:52:50.098]  Mortgage rise will plunge a million homeowners into perilous debt.
[01:52:50.098 --> 01:52:50.978]  Lennon-Guardian.
[01:52:50.978 --> 01:52:52.919]  That's the plan.
[01:52:52.919 --> 01:52:55.300]  Mark Faber predictions 2014.
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:58.401]  The market will decline from current levels.
[01:52:58.401 --> 01:53:01.662]  Best Shorts, Facebook, Tesla, Twitter, Netflix.
[01:53:03.223 --> 01:53:08.546]  And Viva Systems, that's longs, gold, gold shares, Vietnamese stocks.
[01:53:08.546 --> 01:53:10.147]  I agree with that.
[01:53:10.147 --> 01:53:12.649]  I'm not even in the stock market, but I watch it every day.
[01:53:12.649 --> 01:53:15.991]  I know more than the average so-called stock watcher.
[01:53:15.991 --> 01:53:20.273]  I'm not in that Weimar Republic thing, and I'm not in Bitcoin either.
[01:53:20.273 --> 01:53:22.494]  I don't get into dangerous bubbles, folks.
[01:53:22.494 --> 01:53:25.196]  You can be mad at me, but I'm staying away from the stock market.
[01:53:25.196 --> 01:53:26.557]  Sure, I could be part of it.
[01:53:26.557 --> 01:53:31.340]  I could have made tens of millions, literally, watching it, knowing how these scams really work.
[01:53:32.546 --> 01:53:36.787]  I will not be part of something that obviously immoral.
[01:53:36.787 --> 01:53:39.348]  And I'm not on some high horse.
[01:53:39.348 --> 01:53:42.449]  All of my advisors told me 15 years ago, invest in prison stocks.
[01:53:42.449 --> 01:53:44.110]  This country's going pure prison.
[01:53:44.110 --> 01:53:47.471]  Prison stocks are up 300% in the last decade on average.
[01:53:47.471 --> 01:53:49.612]  I didn't invest in them, I told you, 10 years ago.
[01:53:49.612 --> 01:53:53.153]  I said, if you're immoral, invest in prison stocks.
[01:53:53.153 --> 01:53:54.133]  I'm not doing it.
[01:53:54.133 --> 01:53:59.195]  All right, let me hit this final step, then I'll go to your phone calls.
[01:53:59.195 --> 01:53:59.535]  Look at this.
[01:54:00.785 --> 01:54:05.169]  New law allows driverless cars on Michigan roads.
[01:54:05.169 --> 01:54:10.034]  Last time I checked, it's like 20 states have passed laws allowing driverless cars and 18-wheelers.
[01:54:10.034 --> 01:54:14.558]  Folks, they're not just going to supplant humans driving cars.
[01:54:14.558 --> 01:54:21.984]  The insurance companies said 12 years ago, when I was reading some of their public meetings put out in a meeting in Chicago,
[01:54:22.685 --> 01:54:24.947]  I'll never forget reading, it was hundreds of pages of it.
[01:54:24.947 --> 01:54:41.023]  They said that they're going to first phase in computer cars and trucks, then they're going to show that they're, quote, safer, and then make it be computer-assisted at first, where the computer takes over, as Toyota now does, if you're not, and Lexus, if you're not driving properly, and then soon, sorry, you don't get to drive.
[01:54:42.887 --> 01:54:44.908]  And then that brings in total control.
[01:54:44.908 --> 01:54:51.832]  I mean, we are being turned into like those fat walrus creatures in the movie WALL-E, laying out on some computer-controlled system.
[01:54:51.832 --> 01:54:55.974]  But the truth is, they're not going to let us get to that level of a bunch of self-propelled stomachs.
[01:54:55.974 --> 01:55:03.578]  They're going to use computers to take over the real economy, use our energy and money to build the grid, so the military can't say no to evil wars.
[01:55:03.578 --> 01:55:07.841]  It'll be a bunch of self-autonomous drones and robots that, by the way, are already self-autonomous.
[01:55:07.841 --> 01:55:09.462]  That's been out for four years.
[01:55:09.462 --> 01:55:11.443]  They just declassified it last week, as I told you they would.
[01:55:12.123 --> 01:55:13.865]  And this is their total plan.
[01:55:13.865 --> 01:55:16.807]  They've decided that there's a total revolution in society.
[01:55:16.807 --> 01:55:18.008]  We don't exist in it.
[01:55:18.008 --> 01:55:19.509]  The decision's been made.
[01:55:19.509 --> 01:55:31.218]  And if you don't want to be extincted, because that's the final plan, as the elite merge with the machines, that's their public plan, Google all of them, then you better wake up and be part of this.
[01:55:31.218 --> 01:55:33.500]  And not just say, oh, that's that crazy Texan.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:37.744]  Yeah, I'm a crazy Texan that reads what they say they're going to do 15 years ago, 10 years ago.
[01:55:40.302 --> 01:55:46.746]  Here's another one, and I already knew this from DARPA documents that came out of MIT about four years ago.
[01:55:46.746 --> 01:56:04.017]  When you're online and these millions of people playing these video games, these weapon simulators, these combat games where millions are online at one time battling, you're fighting computers that are AI tracking off real military hardware that you're simulating using.
[01:56:04.017 --> 01:56:05.819]  It's the actual real hardware, control.
[01:56:06.659 --> 01:56:13.211]  And they are training combat robots in simulators, the chips, against the best humans.
[01:56:14.346 --> 01:56:14.706]  Boom!
[01:56:14.706 --> 01:56:15.606]  New York Times.
[01:56:15.606 --> 01:56:17.027]  Now, I've told you this a hundred times.
[01:56:17.027 --> 01:56:18.107]  Here it is, New York Times.
[01:56:18.107 --> 01:56:23.248]  Brain-like computers learning from experience in the combat realm.
[01:56:23.248 --> 01:56:26.469]  I mean, this is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:26.469 --> 01:56:28.009]  This is not a joke.
[01:56:28.009 --> 01:56:29.330]  This is serious.
[01:56:29.330 --> 01:56:33.931]  The elite have always hated big populations, and labor's never been cheaper.
[01:56:33.931 --> 01:56:35.371]  Now, we're not just cheap.
[01:56:35.371 --> 01:56:37.252]  We're a negative.
[01:56:37.252 --> 01:56:38.172]  Do you understand that?
[01:56:39.104 --> 01:56:40.005]  I said I'd take calls.
[01:56:40.005 --> 01:56:40.645]  I'm out of time.
[01:56:40.645 --> 01:56:41.525]  Jason in Georgia.
[01:56:41.525 --> 01:56:42.446]  Let's move quick.
[01:56:42.446 --> 01:56:44.207]  What are your predictions for 2014?
[01:56:44.207 --> 01:56:46.028]  What was the big story of 2013?
[01:56:46.028 --> 01:56:53.333]  Well, I don't know, but I tell you, if they keep on doing what they're doing, the new world order is going to win.
[01:56:53.333 --> 01:56:57.455]  Alex, I appreciate all the news that you give us.
[01:56:57.455 --> 01:57:02.138]  Like me and a lot of other people, we cannot even stand the mainstream news anymore.
[01:57:02.138 --> 01:57:07.261]  Your analysis of the news is what drives us, and we appreciate you doing that.
[01:57:07.261 --> 01:57:08.062]  God bless you, brother.
[01:57:09.333 --> 01:57:13.175]  If, uh, the New World Order is like the boy who cried wolf.
[01:57:13.175 --> 01:57:19.359]  Every time somebody makes a prediction, the bad wolf sees what is going to happen.
[01:57:19.359 --> 01:57:23.241]  And what he decides to do with the little boy is he'll show himself.
[01:57:23.241 --> 01:57:24.302]  And then when the villagers come...
[01:57:24.762 --> 01:57:25.583]  He'll hide again.
