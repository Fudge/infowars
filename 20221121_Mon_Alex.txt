[00:00.000 --> 00:23.400]  It's Monday, November 21, 2022, and your host, Alex Jones, am about to exclusively respond
[00:23.400 --> 00:31.080]  to Elon Musk's vicious attack against me and what is clearly a threat.
[00:31.080 --> 00:34.520]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, he quoted Jesus Christ saying,
[00:34.520 --> 00:40.400]  Suffer the little children to come unto me, and then it follows whether it's better for
[00:40.400 --> 00:44.880]  one to tie a millstone around their neck and throw themselves in the deepest ocean than
[00:44.880 --> 00:47.640]  to offend one of these.
[00:47.640 --> 00:52.920]  So one week he's in a baphomet, the devil's champion outfit, and then a few weeks later
[00:52.920 --> 00:58.280]  he's now quoted Jesus Christ, well beware, because the devil masquerades as an angel
[00:58.280 --> 00:59.280]  of light.
[00:59.280 --> 01:03.440]  Now, I'm not saying that Elon Musk is the devil, he's a provocateur, likes to play both
[01:03.440 --> 01:07.680]  sides of every issue, and overall I think he's done some good things, he's also done
[01:07.680 --> 01:12.800]  some very troubling things, but coming up next segment, I am going to really expose what's
[01:12.800 --> 01:18.280]  behind all this and what's really happening at Twitter and the wider war of censorship
[01:18.280 --> 01:23.320]  that is taking place that really only info wars, and a few people like Tucker Carlson
[01:23.320 --> 01:26.320]  have fully grasped what's actually happening.
[01:26.320 --> 01:31.960]  This is being run by intelligence agencies and the Justice Department illegally.
[01:31.960 --> 01:35.640]  They're having congressional hearings about it, it's all come out, I was the first to
[01:35.640 --> 01:41.320]  tell you about it decades ago, but now it's been radically expanded, and these direct
[01:41.320 --> 01:46.600]  scripts are being written and prepared and then given to PR firms that give orders to
[01:46.600 --> 01:49.880]  the corporate media on how to carry this out.
[01:49.880 --> 01:54.800]  Now, obviously Elon Musk has hired more PR firms than probably anybody in modern history,
[01:54.800 --> 02:01.440]  and he's hired some of the PR firms that have been actually attacking me for separate clients,
[02:01.440 --> 02:04.600]  so I hadn't blamed him for this up until this point, but he's definitely following their
[02:04.600 --> 02:09.440]  exact scripts that have been put out before, and it's very, very dangerous.
[02:09.440 --> 02:12.640]  Now again, I know what Elon Musk is doing, I'm going to explain it all coming up the
[02:12.640 --> 02:17.400]  next segments of police day weather separately, info wars is not funded by big billionaires,
[02:17.400 --> 02:21.200]  the globals is funded by you, and we have great products everybody needs.
[02:21.200 --> 02:24.640]  So we're running the biggest sell of the year that's going to continue on, but the products
[02:24.640 --> 02:26.040]  are selling out.
[02:26.040 --> 02:30.120]  So again, these big sales are going to continue on to the end of the year, but that means
[02:30.120 --> 02:33.800]  almost all the products will be sold out well before Christmas.

[03:37.760 --> 03:44.000]  powerful supplements in my life, it supercharges it all and makes it all possible.

[04:23.880 --> 04:28.760]  over 100,000 t-shirts going back over many years, some of them, some had sold, some
[04:28.760 --> 04:31.120]  hadn't sold, some were best sellers, some weren't.
[04:31.120 --> 04:35.280]  All of these are collect items now, there's less than 10,000 left as we speak, and they're

[04:56.120 --> 04:57.120]  We'll be right back.
[04:57.120 --> 05:05.520]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here, we've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[05:05.520 --> 05:11.280]  Now the good news is, I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[05:11.280 --> 05:15.640]  The bad news is, by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out, and
[05:15.640 --> 05:19.360]  we won't get more for months and months and months, so now is the time to take action
[05:19.360 --> 05:22.240]  to support the info war and get the biggest sales of the year.
[05:22.240 --> 05:27.080]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3, and BioTruth Selenium, and our Wake Up America

[05:37.320 --> 05:43.520]  Beats, Secret 12, they are all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[05:43.520 --> 05:47.960]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today, so every hour you wait, more stuff will be
[05:47.960 --> 05:54.600]  sold out at infowarstore.com, ChromoCode 1776, and you get an additional 10% off, the already
[05:54.600 --> 06:23.920]  giant savings at infowarstore.com, thank you so much for your support, God bless.
[06:23.920 --> 06:31.560]  Thank you for joining us on this live Monday, November 21st, 2022 broadcast, I am your host
[06:31.560 --> 06:37.080]  Alex Jones, and we're about to exclusively respond to some of the over the top statements
[06:37.080 --> 06:44.120]  against me by Elon Musk yesterday and today, and the fact that the vast majority of even
[06:44.120 --> 06:49.440]  leftist controlled, infested Twitter has really woken up to what's happening and has saw right
[06:49.440 --> 06:52.680]  through what Elon Musk and the establishment is doing.
[06:52.680 --> 06:57.800]  So, we'll put these tweets on screen, but he first said a few days ago, from a bunch
[06:57.800 --> 07:03.040]  of requests from users, will you bring back Alex Jones, and he said no.
[07:03.040 --> 07:10.040]  He then had a poll and brought back Donald Trump because 1% extra in the poll wanted
[07:10.040 --> 07:11.920]  Trump versus those that didn't.
[07:11.920 --> 07:16.880]  They had similar polls with 300 plus thousand votes, the Hyde Swims did, where I had a 10
[07:16.880 --> 07:21.800]  point lead on the poll of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people wanting me to come back.
[07:21.800 --> 07:27.040]  But the point is, is that it's hypocrisy to say he's democratized it, and it's going
[07:27.040 --> 07:31.840]  to have votes decide who can come back and who can't, and that he's not personally invested,
[07:31.840 --> 07:37.560]  and then come out and release new tweets last night saying, Alex Jones is a terrible person,
[07:37.560 --> 07:41.400]  Alex Jones made money off Sandy Hook, Alex Jones wouldn't hurt these children.
[07:41.400 --> 07:45.160]  None of that is true, but I'm not going to get into the facts of what really happened
[07:45.160 --> 07:46.880]  there until the end of this segment.
[07:46.880 --> 07:53.720]  I want to talk about what Musk is doing right now, it is extremely, extremely transparent.
[07:53.720 --> 07:58.360]  Musk is trying to take over Twitter to create what he calls InternetX that goes back to
[07:58.360 --> 08:02.040]  where the internet was freer and more open, still doesn't mean it'll be perfect.
[08:02.040 --> 08:06.280]  He understands that the censorship is just killing interaction, killing debate, and making
[08:06.280 --> 08:09.760]  it a horrible experience, and he just wants to make it successful.
[08:09.760 --> 08:15.200]  That's a common sense and smart thing to do, just from a business perspective, it's what
[08:15.200 --> 08:16.840]  made America great.
[08:16.840 --> 08:22.000]  But the ADL and the Southern Primary Law Center, the Democratic Party and the European Union
[08:22.000 --> 08:28.800]  and the Justice Department and CIA moles that Congress had hearings on last week are inside
[08:28.800 --> 08:36.640]  of his company right now and are literally trying to sabotage it, not just externally
[08:36.640 --> 08:41.240]  with threats of lawsuits and censorship and criminal charges from the EU, but they're
[08:41.240 --> 08:46.640]  also threatening to sabotage the company and the actual systems that make it operate.
[08:46.640 --> 08:50.920]  So he had an exodus out of the company, it was worse than he thought, there's questions
[08:50.920 --> 08:52.920]  of Twitter is even going to survive.
[08:52.920 --> 08:57.880]  He hit the panic button and basically came out and attacked me so that he can get the
[08:57.880 --> 08:59.880]  left off of his back.
[08:59.880 --> 09:06.640]  And it's fine to me that he did that, except he went too far and compared himself to Jesus
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.800]  and the whole, bring the children to me, suffer the children to me, and if you offend one
[09:11.800 --> 09:15.040]  of these, if you're me and one of these kids, it's better for you to kill yourself by tying
[09:15.040 --> 09:17.760]  a big bow to your neck and throwing it in the ocean.
[09:17.760 --> 09:20.400]  That's basically the translation from the King James.
[09:20.400 --> 09:22.840]  So that's just outrageous.
[09:22.840 --> 09:26.400]  That's absolutely outrageous that I'm supposed to be the worst guy in the world because of
[09:26.400 --> 09:31.760]  media hype that massively has misrepresented what I really said about Sandy Hook that again
[09:31.760 --> 09:35.040]  I'll get to in a moment, but here's the facts.
[09:35.040 --> 09:40.400]  So the bottom line is this, Elon bit off more than he could chew.
[09:40.400 --> 09:45.000]  He took over Tesla, he took over NASA, he's taken over all these programs.
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.560]  And I've given him credit.
[09:46.560 --> 09:48.440]  He's turned them around and overall done a great job.
[09:48.440 --> 09:51.920]  I've actually said, as someone being accomplished, I admire him.
[09:51.920 --> 09:56.880]  And I pointed out that I didn't expect to be reinstated to Twitter and that if he could
[09:56.880 --> 10:00.840]  simply reinstate Trump, that'd be a great thing because Trump is a candidate for the
[10:00.840 --> 10:04.920]  U.S. presidency, a very serious candidate who obviously had the last election stolen
[10:04.920 --> 10:05.920]  from him.
[10:05.920 --> 10:08.720]  And to not let him be on Twitter is massive election meddling.
[10:08.720 --> 10:09.720]  So that's a good thing.
[10:09.720 --> 10:10.720]  Elon's done it.
[10:10.720 --> 10:15.080]  Elon is starting to clean up a bunch of the pedophilia and left his pervert pedophile
[10:15.080 --> 10:16.080]  stuff off the site.
[10:16.080 --> 10:18.360]  So those are the positive things.
[10:18.360 --> 10:23.880]  And that's what makes it outrageous for him to just go with the official line with Democrat
[10:23.880 --> 10:29.720]  party control judges that defaulted me and said that I did all these things I never did.
[10:29.720 --> 10:36.200]  And then I supposedly owe a 1.4 plus billion dollar, 1.4 plus billion dollar ruling of
[10:36.200 --> 10:43.160]  the judge and the kangaroo jury, and then he's just taking that at face value and saying
[10:43.160 --> 10:44.760]  I'm the worst person ever.
[10:44.760 --> 10:47.680]  Doesn't know that they took out of context what I said 10 years ago.
[10:47.680 --> 10:50.960]  Doesn't know I apologized before they ever sued me five years ago.
[10:50.960 --> 10:56.920]  But doesn't accept the fact that they say I owe 1.4 billion and that's not enough.
[10:56.920 --> 11:01.160]  The estate of Adam Lanza, who killed the kids, only paid a little over a million dollars.
[11:01.160 --> 11:06.640]  But now for my words, I'm the worst person ever, and I desecrated graves, and I dug
[11:06.640 --> 11:09.800]  up the children, and I harassed families.
[11:09.800 --> 11:10.800]  None of that's true.
[11:10.800 --> 11:15.440]  But the judge let them put on whatever fake evidence they wanted, and I wasn't allowed
[11:15.440 --> 11:17.800]  to cross-examine them.
[11:17.800 --> 11:22.960]  While I was already found guilty by the judge, they were just deciding how guilty.
[11:22.960 --> 11:26.480]  And now the Democrats are admitting they're going to use this template of judges defaulting
[11:26.480 --> 11:30.120]  conservatives and populists and get rid of our due process.
[11:30.120 --> 11:34.120]  So that's what's really going on here, is as the people were being robbed by a corrupt
[11:34.120 --> 11:36.920]  global elite and the whole Davos group crowd.
[11:36.920 --> 11:40.400]  Remember Obama bragging that he killed hundreds of innocent children over and over and over
[11:40.400 --> 11:44.280]  and over again, total over 200 children in drone strikes, and said he was really good
[11:44.280 --> 11:45.280]  at killing kids?
[11:45.280 --> 11:48.240]  Biden just killed a bunch of innocent kids and says he doesn't care.
[11:48.240 --> 11:53.520]  Madeline Albright, who was under the Clinton Secretary of State, bragged on national television
[11:53.520 --> 11:58.760]  that she tripled the sanctions on the Iraqis and killed 500,000 children and said it was
[11:58.760 --> 12:00.200]  a good price to pay.
[12:00.200 --> 12:03.160]  And when she died, they acted like Jesus had died.
[12:03.160 --> 12:08.240]  The corrupt war on free speech is being directed by these big corporations, and the perfect
[12:08.240 --> 12:13.880]  example of this is the NBA not allowing any criticism by their players or any criticism
[12:13.880 --> 12:18.400]  by the fans of Communist China and the Uyghurs and all the rest of it.
[12:18.400 --> 12:22.880]  Literal death camps and a major NBA owner, remember, came out and said he doesn't want
[12:22.880 --> 12:23.960]  to hear about the Uyghurs.
[12:23.960 --> 12:26.480]  They don't even register in his mind.
[12:26.480 --> 12:30.360]  When you talk about people in slave camps and death camps having their organs harvested
[12:30.360 --> 12:35.600]  and worked to death at Apple Foxconn laboratories, that's okay, because it's just Tim Cooks
[12:35.600 --> 12:39.280]  gay and he wears a turtleneck and talks effeminately.
[12:39.280 --> 12:43.320]  But when Alex Jones questions a mass shooting when the rest of the Internet does, why it
[12:43.320 --> 12:48.200]  is the ultimate crime in history and now all populists need their free speech taken and
[12:48.200 --> 12:51.280]  need to be punished.
[12:51.280 --> 12:55.560]  Heading up this whole global move to censor is the ADL.
[12:55.560 --> 12:59.040]  They're censoring in Europe, they're censoring in Australia, they're censoring in Canada,
[12:59.040 --> 13:01.640]  they're censoring here in the United States, they decide who to get censored.
[13:01.640 --> 13:06.760]  And now Albert Borla last week got an award from the ADL for fighting hate and they said
[13:06.760 --> 13:15.160]  that anyone, anyone at any time that questions in any way any of the shots or if they're
[13:15.160 --> 13:21.280]  effective or anything is a criminal, is an agent of evil, he said, and needs to be censored
[13:21.280 --> 13:23.960]  and debanked and taken off the Internet.
[13:23.960 --> 13:28.440]  And that's really the big story we're talking about here right now.
[13:28.440 --> 13:33.040]  It came out months ago, came out years ago, but months ago and a few weeks ago, even more
[13:33.040 --> 13:38.360]  in the intercept, how Homeland Security has been secretly meeting with big tech and big
[13:38.360 --> 13:43.120]  banks and big corporations and a group of leftist think tanks and quote, watchdog groups
[13:43.120 --> 13:47.440]  who surveil what we say on the Internet and who decide who could speak and who can't.
[13:47.440 --> 13:51.560]  And one of the things you get censored for is questioning the Afghan withdrawal or questioning
[13:51.560 --> 13:56.800]  the poison shots or questioning a stolen election or questioning an open border or questioning
[13:56.800 --> 13:58.560]  inflation.
[13:58.560 --> 14:02.980]  This is the ruling class trying to silence us and trying to engage in such a criminal
[14:02.980 --> 14:10.240]  organized fraud and legitimizing it by making it all about Alex Jones and how evil he is
[14:10.240 --> 14:15.760]  and so legitimizing the entire process to then be carried out and used against you and
[14:15.760 --> 14:18.600]  your family or your company or your business.
[14:18.600 --> 14:22.520]  And of course, others have pointed out the other big elephant in the room, all the dictators
[14:22.520 --> 14:27.400]  and all the moulas and all the war criminals that all have their Twitter accounts because
[14:27.400 --> 14:31.240]  well their world leaders, we've got to be able to hear from them and most of the UN Human
[14:31.240 --> 14:38.280]  Rights Board is made up of dictators and made up of despots, but they're all good.
[14:38.280 --> 14:39.560]  They're all great people.
[14:39.560 --> 14:42.440]  It's only Alex Jones that questions Sandy Hook.
[14:42.440 --> 14:45.680]  It's only Alex Jones that questions Justice Smollett.
[14:45.680 --> 14:49.560]  You know, it's that terrible Alex Jones that questioned WMDs in Iraq.
[14:49.560 --> 14:53.640]  It's that terrible Alex Jones that's been right about 98% of the time.
[14:53.640 --> 14:58.120]  He's got to be silenced so we can then point everybody else as they do on Twitter and Instagram
[14:58.120 --> 15:02.000]  and Facebook and say, you're going to get Alex Jones next.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.640]  If you question something or if you question how it's been politicized, we're not just
[15:05.640 --> 15:06.640]  going to silence you.
[15:06.640 --> 15:07.640]  We're going to sue you.
[15:07.640 --> 15:08.640]  We're going to debank you.
[15:08.640 --> 15:12.920]  And then we're going to misrepresent what you've said and then we're going to say that
[15:12.920 --> 15:17.440]  you've been defaulted and then have a show trial where you're already guilty.
[15:17.440 --> 15:20.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're already living in tyranny.
[15:20.920 --> 15:23.040]  This is all targeted at you.
[15:23.040 --> 15:26.720]  And Elon Musk knows that and he's playing both sides.
[15:26.720 --> 15:31.200]  The truth is he wants one global app like the Communist Chinese do, where all the censorship
[15:31.200 --> 15:35.080]  and all the social credit scores and all the systems are implemented in one place.
[15:35.080 --> 15:38.400]  He wants to pretend like he's bringing in an open and free system and get everybody
[15:38.400 --> 15:39.760]  else on board.
[15:39.760 --> 15:44.320]  And then once he has the one ring to rule them all, once he has the big global internet
[15:44.320 --> 15:48.160]  acts and there's deep state handlers, then they'll be able to implement total and absolute
[15:48.160 --> 15:49.160]  control.
[15:49.160 --> 15:57.800]  We'll be back with more of the secrets straight ahead.
[15:57.800 --> 16:02.720]  I've got some good news and bad news.
[16:02.720 --> 16:07.800]  Info Wars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right now on our amazing products.

[16:27.200 --> 16:28.920]  Biotrystallinium has sold out.

[16:35.000 --> 16:41.160]  turmeric formula, whole food multivitamin, brain force ultra, super metal lactality,

[16:47.120 --> 16:48.120]  to find them.

[16:49.120 --> 16:50.120]  Don't fight the traffic.
[16:50.120 --> 16:52.760]  Don't do all your Christmas shopping in a month like a fool.
[16:52.760 --> 16:53.960]  Do it now.
[16:53.960 --> 16:54.960]  Get it all over with.

[17:04.960 --> 17:10.080]  Andrew Tate has truly earned the title of top G. But there's another title Andrew Tate
[17:10.080 --> 17:12.440]  holds that has enraged the globalist.
[17:12.440 --> 17:17.640]  He is consecutively the most googled man in the world in the last two years.
[17:17.640 --> 17:22.720]  And that's because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.
[17:22.720 --> 17:29.800]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.
[17:29.800 --> 17:32.160]  Introducing top G supplements.
[17:32.160 --> 17:36.640]  We are proud to introduce and sponsor the top G line of supplements by Andrew Tate and
[17:36.640 --> 17:37.640]  his crew.

[17:41.600 --> 17:43.520]  Andrew Tate takes himself.
[17:43.520 --> 17:51.160]  Learn more about these amazing products at andrutatepower.com, and discover the power
[17:51.160 --> 17:54.840]  of Andrew Tate's new supplements that are the highest quality on the market.
[17:54.840 --> 17:55.840]  Men grow up to be like me.
[17:55.840 --> 17:58.920]  You're going to have a whole bunch of people with no criminal record, dedicated athletes
[17:58.920 --> 18:02.320]  who protect and provide for the people close to them.
[18:02.320 --> 18:08.200]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[18:08.200 --> 18:13.540]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[18:13.540 --> 18:15.640]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[18:15.640 --> 18:18.440]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[18:18.440 --> 18:21.680]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[18:21.680 --> 18:23.080]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[18:23.080 --> 18:27.240]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[18:27.240 --> 18:28.240]  all of this.
[18:28.240 --> 18:31.560]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[18:31.560 --> 18:32.560]  your support.
[18:32.560 --> 18:35.640]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[18:35.640 --> 18:40.160]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[18:40.160 --> 18:43.800]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[18:43.800 --> 18:45.480]  because of your past support.
[18:45.480 --> 18:49.280]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[18:49.280 --> 18:53.720]  free double your efforts by visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[18:53.720 --> 18:54.720]  on air.
[18:54.720 --> 18:56.720]  1776 is the promo code.
[18:56.720 --> 19:02.280]  The destination is infowarstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[19:02.280 --> 19:07.080]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[19:07.080 --> 19:09.480]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[19:09.480 --> 19:14.040]  I was barely holding onto a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[19:14.040 --> 19:18.560]  But the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[19:18.560 --> 19:21.680]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that stew, you had, you know, with a
[19:21.680 --> 19:24.640]  deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[19:24.640 --> 19:30.920]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[19:30.920 --> 19:34.200]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[19:34.200 --> 19:38.640]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[19:38.640 --> 19:40.760]  took basically all of your supplements.
[19:40.760 --> 19:42.760]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[19:42.760 --> 19:47.080]  The one I like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[19:47.080 --> 19:48.080]  It's amazing.
[19:48.080 --> 19:49.080]  It works.
[19:49.080 --> 19:52.240]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[19:52.240 --> 19:56.240]  the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our
[19:56.240 --> 19:57.240]  own hands.
[19:57.240 --> 19:58.240]  Beautifully said, brother.
[19:58.240 --> 20:01.600]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[20:01.600 --> 20:25.080]  Being a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:25.080 --> 20:28.080]  Welcome back to this live Monday edition of Alex Jones show.
[20:28.080 --> 20:32.320]  I'm sure it was about to take over here in just a moment, I'll also be co-hosting some
[20:32.320 --> 20:34.320]  later in the broadcast and obviously tomorrow.
[20:34.320 --> 20:37.560]  I want to wish you all great Thanksgiving coming up.
[20:37.560 --> 20:39.760]  Now back to Elon Musk.
[20:39.760 --> 20:46.080]  There's so many facets to this, but the establishment uses basic psychology.
[20:46.080 --> 20:50.120]  And if they can take a populist leader like myself that's exposed their agenda and expose
[20:50.120 --> 20:54.720]  their legal wars and their surveillance and their censorship and their tainted vaccines,
[20:54.720 --> 21:00.200]  dirty population agenda, and they can look at my whole record and look at me a few times
[21:00.200 --> 21:04.600]  questioning a public event when everybody else or large portions of the population was
[21:04.600 --> 21:10.320]  questioning it as well, they can then blow that up, make it a huge national issue for
[21:10.320 --> 21:14.680]  year after year after year, a huge project, tens of thousands of articles, thousands and
[21:14.680 --> 21:19.280]  thousands of news programs, over a talk show host questioning a mass shooting along with
[21:19.280 --> 21:25.160]  many others, if they can do that, it sets the precedent to demonize and destroy anybody
[21:25.160 --> 21:30.720]  else that questions big events, whether they be real, whether they be staged, whether they
[21:30.720 --> 21:35.520]  be provocateur, but then our own State Department has press conference or press conference with
[21:35.520 --> 21:42.160]  the CIA saying Russia's staging mass shootings and Russia's staging bombings or that attacks
[21:42.160 --> 21:45.600]  Russia say happened, didn't happen.
[21:45.600 --> 21:49.760]  So false flags are a very, very real thing throughout history, it's taught in military
[21:49.760 --> 21:56.240]  history, it's taught in special operations, how to stage false flags, yes the US military
[21:56.240 --> 22:01.240]  teaches some of their most elite forces in certain emergencies, how to stage a false
[22:01.240 --> 22:08.480]  flag, part of that came out in the whole WikiLeaks document six years ago, but I'm digressing,
[22:08.480 --> 22:12.680]  it's totally normal and healthy to question everything, I did not send people to their
[22:12.680 --> 22:16.720]  houses, they have no video, they have no witnesses, they have no evidence, I never sent anybody
[22:16.720 --> 22:21.040]  to their graves, I never had anybody pee on their graves, all of that's a lie, with no
[22:21.040 --> 22:27.760]  witnesses or no evidence because the system is so incredibly angry at me, I never made
[22:27.760 --> 22:35.840]  money off Sandy Hook, the families and the lawyers and the think tanks and the PR firms
[22:35.840 --> 22:42.880]  are all on record breaking in hundreds of millions of dollars off of this, 74 million
[22:42.880 --> 22:48.040]  dollars from Remington that Remington actually hadn't paid, on and on and on, again a little
[22:48.040 --> 22:56.440]  over a million from the Lanza estate, but Alex Jones they say owes over 1.4 billion
[22:56.440 --> 23:03.440]  dollars, they say Jones refuses to pay your honor, we need to put him in jail, refuses
[23:03.440 --> 23:11.880]  to pay, I don't have 3 million dollars, so again that's the over the top surrealness
[23:11.880 --> 23:15.680]  of all of this and I've been on the fence about Elon Musk, I've said that the jury's
[23:15.680 --> 23:20.640]  been out on him and he does some good things, he does some bad things, but the fact that
[23:20.640 --> 23:26.120]  he's sophisticated and knows all this and has his own big PR firms, some of which I
[23:26.120 --> 23:29.640]  know have actually worked on the Sandy Hook case, some of those PR firms he uses have
[23:29.640 --> 23:35.240]  also done work for him and they admit that this big PR firm out of New York that has
[23:35.240 --> 23:41.480]  PR for the United Nations, before I was ever sued, got with the families and the lawyers,
[23:41.480 --> 23:47.040]  hyped up the story, made it a huge national story about me and Sandy Hook, so people go
[23:47.040 --> 23:52.360]  oh my gosh he's being mean, they went and hyped it up and reported it, then they found
[23:52.360 --> 23:57.800]  the lawsuit, then they had unlimited press coverage, like wartime level coverage, thousands
[23:57.800 --> 24:01.760]  of articles a week, year after year about how I'm a devil and how I'm a demon and people
[24:01.760 --> 24:06.760]  just keep saying why is it such a big story, why won't he stop talking about it, why is
[24:06.760 --> 24:11.120]  he sending them to their houses, why is he attacking them and they still, even after
[24:11.120 --> 24:15.600]  their fake court cases and rulings, went in a few weeks ago in Connecticut and said your
[24:15.600 --> 24:20.280]  honor we've got to get him off the air right now, he's still coming to their houses, he's
[24:20.280 --> 24:27.640]  still attacking them, we need billions more, only that will stop him from the attacks,
[24:27.640 --> 24:31.640]  that never happened, that never took place.
[24:31.640 --> 24:38.440]  So I believe Sandy Hook happened, I did question it some after others raised issues, but when
[24:38.440 --> 24:43.760]  it comes to what it's become today, the whole culture, the whole cult of it, the whole religion
[24:43.760 --> 24:50.360]  of it, is an anti-free speech, anti-self-defense system that the establishment uses as its
[24:50.360 --> 24:55.120]  shield while it commits all these crimes and war crimes and illegal spying and the evaluation
[24:55.120 --> 25:02.080]  of currencies and FDX scams and poisoned vaccines and Joseph Mingle of force medical
[25:02.080 --> 25:07.320]  tyranny, while all of that goes on, while all of that's happening they get to sit back
[25:07.320 --> 25:13.320]  and point their finger at me and say there's the bad man and in this new religion of Sandy
[25:13.320 --> 25:20.000]  Hook and the children that died ten years ago, Alex Jones is Satan and Barack Obama
[25:20.000 --> 25:26.080]  and the Democratic Party and the gun control lobby are Jesus and that's the new religion
[25:26.080 --> 25:30.880]  and Elon Musk has said he's part of that religion, he even quoted Jesus, he said Alex Jones
[25:30.880 --> 25:36.320]  deserves to have a boulder tied around his neck and thrown into the deepest ocean, but
[25:36.320 --> 25:41.800]  the old Elon isn't really following Christ, we know that, he's following transhumanism,
[25:41.800 --> 25:49.440]  brain chips on our children, bathing us in 5G and 6G, bathing us in all the GMO and he's
[25:49.440 --> 25:55.400]  basically the fake Tony Stark that the CIA created as a front man and I've known that
[25:55.400 --> 25:59.320]  for a long time, I know the people high level in the CIA that know him and the whole thing
[25:59.320 --> 26:04.240]  and I had hoped he'd broken away from him and I'd hoped he was trying to be his own
[26:04.240 --> 26:08.560]  man but it's very, very clear he's not his own man and that's a very, very, very, very
[26:08.560 --> 26:12.840]  sad thing and so when they're done with him they'll destroy him as well so they're just
[26:12.840 --> 26:18.840]  trying to use him as a cool, you know, playboy nerd that is launching all these deep state
[26:18.840 --> 26:24.280]  projects that are unpopular and at the end of the day it just turns out that Elon Musk
[26:24.280 --> 26:31.240]  is a fake and the system knows it's got to have a multi-polar dichotomy in the dialectic
[26:31.240 --> 26:34.640]  of the total censors on one end that want an internet ID and to totally track you and
[26:34.640 --> 26:39.800]  control everything you do and fines and everything that PayPal's doing, $2,000 fines for thought
[26:39.800 --> 26:43.800]  crime and on the other side, oh no, no, no, it's Elon Musk who surveils you and gets
[26:43.800 --> 26:48.920]  your data and wants a cash flow society and wants social credit score and wants universal
[26:48.920 --> 26:54.600]  basic income and will also censor you but when he does it's not bad because it's not
[26:54.600 --> 27:00.320]  emotional that he says it is emotional when it comes to Alex Jones, the worst person on
[27:00.320 --> 27:01.320]  earth.
[27:01.320 --> 27:05.320]  So Elon, I will respect you again if you say Alex Jones is a horrible demon but Madeline
[27:05.320 --> 27:08.920]  Albright bragging about killing 500,000 kids and being proud of it is a little bit worse
[27:08.920 --> 27:15.920]  than me or Borla lying and saying the vaccine is 100% effective in South African trials
[27:15.920 --> 27:18.920]  a year into the whole thing when he knew damn well it didn't even work at all and actually
[27:18.920 --> 27:19.920]  made you sick.
[27:19.920 --> 27:24.880]  I mean, you know, why don't you at least say the millions dead from the shot is a little
[27:24.880 --> 27:29.480]  bit worse than me the devil questioning Sandy Hook.
[27:29.480 --> 27:30.480]  So that's where we're at.
[27:30.480 --> 27:32.980]  All right, I need listeners to know this, we're not funded by the globals, we're funded
[27:32.980 --> 27:33.980]  by you.
[27:33.980 --> 27:37.000]  We have the biggest sell of the year going right now and when I plugged at the very start
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.880]  of the show I dropped the ball, we don't just have a 60% off with promo code 1776 ladies
[27:41.880 --> 27:43.160]  and gentlemen.
[27:43.160 --> 27:50.600]  We have a free gift with every single order no matter how small, actually on big orders
[27:50.600 --> 27:54.760]  you get more than one gift, you get a free gift and we're not just talking about in some
[27:54.760 --> 27:58.560]  cases will be a bunch of bumper stickers or Alex Jones mask, some cases will be a book
[27:58.560 --> 28:03.920]  or a film or just a bunch of other amazing items so we have some big ticket items as

[28:45.440 --> 28:49.640]  Okay, I've covered most of the issues, Owen Schroder is about to take over and I'll be
[28:49.640 --> 28:53.360]  talking more about this in the days to come but Elon Musk is really really early stepped
[28:53.360 --> 29:00.520]  in it and the internet's waking up big time.
[29:00.520 --> 29:07.240]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[29:07.240 --> 29:11.840]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[29:11.840 --> 29:16.280]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[29:16.280 --> 29:21.120]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[29:21.120 --> 29:24.720]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[29:24.720 --> 29:31.520]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3 but if you're not getting
[29:31.520 --> 29:36.600]  enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[29:36.600 --> 29:39.400]  things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[29:39.400 --> 29:43.360]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter's here to take high quality vitamin
[29:43.360 --> 29:48.160]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into

[29:59.320 --> 30:07.040]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be slowly stolen day by day counting these
[30:07.040 --> 30:13.600]  mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[30:13.600 --> 30:20.840]  when it's election month, Alex, it's not election day and that's the problem and everything
[30:20.840 --> 30:27.880]  changed after COVID-19, they illegally changed state elections mailing ballots to anyone
[30:27.880 --> 30:32.120]  and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[30:32.120 --> 30:36.400]  Well this isn't any way to run an election, we're in a serious country when we have elections
[30:36.400 --> 30:40.960]  that can be stolen like this and I believe that just like I believe the election was
[30:40.960 --> 30:46.640]  stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying that and it is so absurd for the media and
[30:46.640 --> 30:52.760]  the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that
[30:52.760 --> 30:58.320]  elections shouldn't be run the way they are, we're not election deniers, we're election
[30:58.320 --> 30:59.320]  realists.
[30:59.320 --> 31:02.840]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[31:02.840 --> 31:04.080]  Why is this taking so long?
[31:04.080 --> 31:08.200]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day, why can't we do
[31:08.200 --> 31:09.200]  this here?
[31:09.200 --> 31:13.880]  The answer is fraud and corruption, if we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether
[31:13.880 --> 31:17.480]  the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis.
[31:17.480 --> 31:21.360]  They're going to deny us Michigan, they're going to deny us Pennsylvania, they're going
[31:21.360 --> 31:28.120]  to deny us Arizona and I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states
[31:28.120 --> 31:33.680]  where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[31:33.680 --> 31:39.160]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system, Tucker Carlson said this better
[31:39.160 --> 31:43.280]  last night than anything else, communications are the reason why we didn't well, that's
[31:43.280 --> 31:48.720]  why infowars.com is so damn important, that's why they're so desperate to take you off
[31:48.720 --> 31:54.680]  the air Alex, people need to get behind info wars, this alternative media that we work
[31:54.680 --> 32:00.880]  so hard to bring you is vitally important, we need more of this communications, not less.
[32:00.880 --> 32:06.120]  It's a post COVID world now, Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare
[32:06.120 --> 32:11.120]  system, there's a solution, the wellness company, I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and I'm the chief
[32:11.120 --> 32:17.160]  scientific officer and I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content,

[32:30.600 --> 32:37.840]  products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19 acute
[32:37.840 --> 32:43.320]  and post COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes and the array of things that now
[32:43.320 --> 32:51.840]  America has to work through in this new world that we're living in, so go to onlinehealthnow.com
[32:51.840 --> 32:57.000]  and check out the wellness company for a low monthly fee, you can get started today and
[32:57.000 --> 33:01.440]  on a pathway to better health.
[33:01.440 --> 33:08.440]  Using a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:08.440 --> 33:22.440]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:22.440 --> 33:41.600]  Thank you to the listeners and viewers for your support and thank you for the outpouring
[33:41.600 --> 33:46.360]  I've seen not just on Twitter but across the internet and on my phone and in person
[33:46.360 --> 33:52.040]  on the streets by people really, really supporting me and understanding or supporting themselves
[33:52.040 --> 33:55.840]  in that process and that if they can take down info wars, they believe they can take
[33:55.840 --> 33:56.840]  us all down.
[33:56.840 --> 34:02.160]  Elon Musk, even on leftist Twitter, is getting annihilated by people that see through the
[34:02.160 --> 34:07.480]  hypocrisy and are pointing out all the evil things the system does by design and all the
[34:07.480 --> 34:12.480]  lies they tell on purpose and then they sit back and act like I'm this object of ultimate
[34:12.480 --> 34:16.560]  premeditated evil and that I'm Satan and that I should be ashamed of myself and that
[34:16.560 --> 34:18.840]  you should all be ashamed of yourselves.
[34:18.840 --> 34:23.200]  It's the left again trying to use mind control on us and gaslighting us and it's not working
[34:23.200 --> 34:25.200]  so it's incredible.
[34:25.200 --> 34:29.040]  I mean Trump again won his poll by like two points or whatever it was.
[34:29.040 --> 34:34.920]  I won my poll on Twitter with 300,000 plus votes by 10 points.
[34:34.920 --> 34:39.720]  So just think about that ladies and gentlemen and what a hypocrite Musk is being.
[34:39.720 --> 34:42.200]  I don't even want to go back on Twitter.
[34:42.200 --> 34:45.800]  I mean it's kind of cool to be the most banned guy in the world.
[34:45.800 --> 34:46.800]  It's a joke.
[34:46.800 --> 34:49.320]  I will say this about Trump in closing.
[34:49.320 --> 34:54.160]  He should use Twitter and the 83 million followers to push them to true social and say hey I'm
[34:54.160 --> 34:58.560]  about to cover this here or have about to go live here and just use it as a bulletin
[34:58.560 --> 35:05.080]  board notice just like he'd use a GOP email system to tell people to come to true social.
[35:05.080 --> 35:08.800]  So whoever's advising Trump not to use Twitter is foolish.
[35:08.800 --> 35:13.400]  Now when I say I don't care about using Twitter it's because I was never that good at using
[35:13.400 --> 35:14.400]  Twitter.
[35:14.400 --> 35:15.880]  I'm not as witty as all you folks are.
[35:15.880 --> 35:19.600]  I'm a syndicated radio host again at the end of the day.
[35:19.600 --> 35:23.760]  I know that they've put me in such a position of being seen as Satan on the political spectrum
[35:23.760 --> 35:28.560]  that that will never happen so I'm just over it and because I know you're still going to
[35:28.560 --> 35:33.360]  be there and you're still going to be on other platforms exposed to the globalist and I would
[35:33.360 --> 35:38.600]  advise all payers to stay on Instagram, stay on YouTube, stay on Twitter but push everybody
[35:38.600 --> 35:43.360]  to independent media, push everybody to info wars, push everybody to your own site, push
[35:43.360 --> 35:51.920]  everybody to getter and gab and parlor and rumble and just all the other incredible sites
[35:51.920 --> 35:53.520]  and places that are out there.
[35:53.520 --> 35:57.000]  That's what I love is the diversity of the population and what we're doing together and
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.720]  we are definitely in one hell of a fight together but we are winning.
[35:59.720 --> 36:00.720]  So God bless.
[36:00.720 --> 36:03.240]  Thank you so much and I think I'll enjoy it for all he's done to the crew.
[36:03.240 --> 36:05.200]  Now I'll enjoy your text over.
[36:05.200 --> 36:07.800]  All right, there goes Alex Jones.
[36:07.800 --> 36:16.120]  We're now live in the info wars headquarters in Austin, Texas and let's just kind of hit
[36:16.120 --> 36:23.800]  the reset button now and let you know what is coming up on today's transmission.
[36:23.800 --> 36:31.800]  We've got the Democrats at it again, gun grabbing and I have to say whenever I'm reading these
[36:31.800 --> 36:41.200]  stories and getting ready for my coverage of this, the overwhelming sense is how is there
[36:41.200 --> 36:50.160]  not a bigger pushback and how is it that the basic instinct of survival and freedom has
[36:50.160 --> 36:57.960]  been so beaten out of the American consciousness that whatever you think is the proper response
[36:57.960 --> 37:05.360]  to a mass shooting that we don't have the proper response to individuals wanting to disarm
[37:05.360 --> 37:13.120]  you because that's a pretty big story and if you think the mass shooting at a gay night
[37:13.120 --> 37:19.120]  club was bad that resulted in five dead and 25 injured, do you have any idea what kind
[37:19.120 --> 37:25.600]  of a blood bath disarming the American people would be?
[37:25.600 --> 37:29.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[37:29.880 --> 37:38.360]  Just look throughout human history at what authoritarian regimes disarming the citizens
[37:38.360 --> 37:45.360]  looks like, but it's this new thing where we're just so normalized, we're just so numb
[37:45.360 --> 37:49.760]  to it and that becomes the problem they've beaten us over the head with this so much
[37:49.760 --> 37:51.520]  that we don't even respond.
[37:51.520 --> 37:53.960]  It's like a reverse boy that cried wolf almost.
[37:53.960 --> 38:00.160]  It's like no, they really are coming to take your guns, they haven't been able to properly
[38:00.160 --> 38:04.240]  do it yet, but they really want to and then now we just don't even have the basic response
[38:04.240 --> 38:11.600]  of wait a second, you're trying to disarm me, there was a mass shooting and people died
[38:11.600 --> 38:15.560]  and that's really tragic and all of a sudden me the law abiding citizen has to punish,
[38:15.560 --> 38:18.480]  be punished and pay the price.
[38:18.480 --> 38:24.800]  But we'll have that and some other twists with it as well because as I said last night
[38:24.800 --> 38:31.480]  I could play this game all day long and so for Mayor, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to
[38:31.480 --> 38:36.960]  say oh I'm sick of this after the Colorado shooting, oh that's interesting, should we
[38:36.960 --> 38:41.480]  look into what happened in Chicago over the weekend, we'll see if she's sick of that, we're
[38:41.480 --> 38:47.480]  sick of her, we're sick of Democrat gun grabbers.
[38:47.480 --> 38:51.880]  So we've got that, we've got what the corporate world government's going to look like, we
[38:51.880 --> 38:57.200]  know it, how they're going to usher it in, we now know that as well, it's oh man made
[38:57.200 --> 39:05.160]  climate change and you caused a flood in Indonesia and you caused an earthquake and now you have
[39:05.160 --> 39:10.480]  to pay for it and yes it's going to have to be you Americans, you dirty Americans, you're
[39:10.480 --> 39:14.120]  going to pay all the taxes for it, don't worry China's not going to pay anything, India's
[39:14.120 --> 39:19.120]  not going to pay anything, you're going to pay all of it and our leaders go over there
[39:19.120 --> 39:24.880]  like ah yes we will, okay yeah, we'll pay all the climate taxes, we'll pay for every
[39:24.880 --> 39:30.520]  flood ever, we'll pay for every earthquake and tsunami, that's our fault, that's our
[39:30.520 --> 39:36.760]  fault, sorry we're bad Americans, sorry we're so bad, oh we just take in the most refugees
[39:36.760 --> 39:41.720]  and immigrants and the most humanitarian aid given out on the face of the earth every other
[39:41.720 --> 39:46.440]  country combined, we still beat them all, we're so bad, we're so bad, we should pay for climate
[39:46.440 --> 39:56.440]  change too, okay, I've got other political news, there was good news, there was some
[39:56.440 --> 40:02.560]  good economic news and then there's some bad economic news, actually there is some good
[40:02.560 --> 40:08.000]  economic news, believe it or not, no thanks to Joe Biden but I'll explain that coming
[40:08.000 --> 40:15.360]  up and then we've got Trump proven right on multiple issues and it gets a little old,
[40:15.360 --> 40:23.320]  it gets a little frustrating, where last night CBS News, their big Sunday news special on
[40:23.320 --> 40:31.000]  CBS Sunday Night News, do you know what it was, do you know what CBS News big special
[40:31.000 --> 40:41.280]  was last night, after the football game everybody tuned in, do you know what the big CBS Sunday
[40:41.280 --> 40:50.800]  Night News special report was, Hunter Biden's laptop, Hunter Biden's laptop, because you
[40:50.800 --> 40:58.880]  know it's from when was it again, oh November 2020, that was the, or was it October 2020,
[40:58.880 --> 41:08.680]  gotcha, two years later, thanks CBS News, I mean guys, if you're not cheering along,
[41:08.680 --> 41:15.840]  if you're not clapping along at home, you're being a lazy bum, CBS News got it guys, Hunter
[41:15.840 --> 41:22.560]  Biden's laptop is real, thanks CBS News, but look, we can make fun of the mainstream media
[41:22.560 --> 41:26.280]  being light years by the infowars all day long, just like I can sit here and make fun
[41:26.280 --> 41:31.600]  of the Democrats where Trump was proven right about what's going on in Germany now and that's
[41:31.600 --> 41:35.400]  kind of fun and we can pat ourselves in the back and it feels good and we can do that
[41:35.400 --> 41:44.760]  and that's fine, but okay, let's get serious about it, why would the Democrat run media
[41:44.760 --> 41:51.440]  all of a sudden green light the Hunter Biden story, because they've had it for two years
[41:51.440 --> 41:58.200]  folks, I mean they've had the Hunter Biden story for two years, why are they green lighting
[41:58.200 --> 42:05.960]  it now, after the midterms, ahead of the presidential election cycle, I think it's pretty obvious
[42:05.960 --> 42:13.280]  what's going on here folks, I think it's pretty obvious what's going on here, I think the
[42:13.280 --> 42:19.560]  Biden ouster is actually upon us and I think they might, the deep state might be willing
[42:19.560 --> 42:26.760]  to give us this synthetic win, feeling like we've got wind in our sails, when really we're
[42:26.760 --> 42:34.800]  just unknowingly doing their bidding for them by getting Biden out of the way, the Democrats
[42:34.800 --> 42:41.560]  want Biden out of the way and they want Republicans off their necks, politically speaking, so
[42:41.560 --> 42:45.560]  what are they gonna do, are they gonna offer us Hunter Biden and Joe Biden as some form
[42:45.560 --> 42:50.160]  of a sacrificial lamb, so that we feel like we're getting the momentum and we feel like
[42:50.160 --> 42:54.200]  we're having a victory, but then they actually get their victory of getting Joe Biden out
[42:54.200 --> 42:58.200]  of the way, so Gavin Newsom or Hillary Clinton can come along for 2024.
[42:58.200 --> 43:05.160]  I've got some good news and bad news, Info Wars is running the biggest sale of 2022 right

[52:50.880 --> 52:56.080]  Logic is an important thing for civilization to have, for civilization to thrive and prosper,
[52:56.080 --> 53:04.160]  and if logic is mis-aimed and confused, then you're going to have problems. So let's just say
[53:05.520 --> 53:10.000]  they are legitimate, they are legitimate in claiming that
[53:10.000 --> 53:15.280]  Lauren Boebert or Donald Trump caused an anti-LGBTQ shooting, which they didn't,
[53:15.280 --> 53:24.000]  but let's just play along here. So because Trump said X about gay people or Lauren Boebert said Y
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.840]  about gay people, which they don't actually show any quotes or anything, they just claim it.
[53:29.600 --> 53:33.760]  Okay, because of that, somebody went out and shot up a nightclub and that's their fault.
[53:33.760 --> 53:39.360]  That's the logic of the Democrats blaming Lauren Boebert and Donald Trump, and there are a lot
[53:39.360 --> 53:45.600]  of them out there. This isn't, it's like all of them actually, from AOC and the Democrats in Congress
[53:45.600 --> 53:48.800]  to members of the media to the Democrat paid for Twitter accounts.
[53:50.640 --> 53:55.920]  Well, Elon Musk should do something about it if he doesn't soon, because it's just out of control,
[53:57.040 --> 54:03.680]  but that's another story. Okay, so what about when Democrats and liberals say bad stuff about
[54:03.680 --> 54:09.040]  police and then a policeman gets shot? What happens when Democrats and liberals lie about an event
[54:09.040 --> 54:12.880]  like hands up don't shoot and then a city, Ferguson, Missouri burns to the ground?
[54:14.960 --> 54:18.880]  What about when the Democrats and the media hype up the George Floyd narrative and then
[54:18.880 --> 54:24.800]  we have riots for three months on end, $2 billion in property damage, dozens killed,
[54:24.800 --> 54:29.120]  hundreds hospitalized in critical condition? Okay, you want to play that game?
[54:30.240 --> 54:34.320]  Is that the game you really want to play? Now, of course, the answer is no, because you need to
[54:34.320 --> 54:39.840]  understand we're dealing with liberal supremacists. They believe they're better than you. They believe
[54:39.840 --> 54:47.360]  you're scum. So take the concept as they like to project of white supremacy, white people thinking
[54:47.360 --> 54:53.760]  they're better than black people. That's not a problem in this country. Liberal supremacy is
[54:53.760 --> 54:56.960]  liberals that think they're better than conservatives, atheists that think they're
[54:56.960 --> 55:02.560]  better than Christians. Liberal Democrat supremacy, they don't want the logic applied
[55:02.560 --> 55:06.640]  universally where you say something and then and then let's say a crime is committed, well,
[55:06.640 --> 55:12.480]  you the person that said something is held responsible. No, they only want that standard
[55:12.480 --> 55:17.040]  to be held to you. Don't you see? Don't you see?
[55:20.560 --> 55:25.680]  They don't want to be held to that standard. They're above it. They're liberal supremacists.
[55:25.680 --> 55:30.720]  They think they're better than you. That's what we're dealing with in this country. You can
[55:30.720 --> 55:34.080]  talk about white supremacists. You can talk about black supremacists. You can talk about this crap
[55:34.080 --> 55:41.440]  all day long. That's not going to affect 99.9% of us or 99.9% of our activities in this life.
[55:41.440 --> 55:47.200]  Liberal supremacists are trying to crush you with everything you do. Liberal supremacists,
[55:47.200 --> 55:50.720]  you're dealing with liberal supremacy almost every day in some way, shape, or form.
[55:53.040 --> 55:59.200]  But that's exactly how they want it. And so, of course, they want to disarm you. Joe Biden calls
[55:59.200 --> 56:05.680]  for assault weapons ban following nightclub shooting. And this is their first response
[56:05.680 --> 56:09.360]  every time there's a shooting like this, is to disarm the American people.
[56:11.600 --> 56:18.880]  So, when Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot comes out and says, I'm sick of this because of what
[56:18.880 --> 56:23.920]  happened in Colorado, okay, well, let's go ahead and plug in, I mean, guys, plug in shootings in
[56:23.920 --> 56:28.720]  Chicago or weekend shootings in Chicago, as I'm going over some of these other headlines,
[56:28.720 --> 56:32.080]  two injured from two overnight shootings in Baltimore. This is all over the weekend.
[56:32.720 --> 56:36.320]  Delaware County, Philadelphia police investigating deadly double shooting.
[56:37.600 --> 56:44.320]  Chicago shootings, two teens among nine shot in weekend gun violence. Two teenagers shot on
[56:44.320 --> 56:50.400]  Staten Island, New York. Guys, what do we have on Google here? Google for me weekend Chicago
[56:50.400 --> 56:55.440]  shootings or shooting Chicago weekend or something like that. Let's see what we have here because
[56:55.440 --> 57:00.960]  Lori Lightfoot is sick of this is what she says. She's sick of this. So I wonder if she's sick of
[57:00.960 --> 57:07.760]  what happens in her city. Oh, three teens among 20 shot CBS News four hours ago, three killed,
[57:07.760 --> 57:15.520]  17 wounded NBC Chicago 21 21 minutes ago, 15 year old among three killed. Yeah, this is just
[57:15.520 --> 57:19.440]  all from the weekend. I mean, we can go last weekend to six people killed in separate shootings
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.440]  over weekend in Chicago. That's last weekend. Another one last weekend, five people killed
[57:23.440 --> 57:28.560]  30 others wounded in weekend violence. Okay, so there you go. Those numbers are all worse than
[57:28.560 --> 57:35.440]  what happened in Colorado. Mayor Lori Lightfoot, your thoughts, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, your comments,
[57:35.440 --> 57:39.600]  are you sick of this bleep too? Are you sick of this crap to Lori? Or is that just in another
[57:39.600 --> 57:44.800]  person's district? Is that just when you guys can use political violence, what you view as
[57:44.800 --> 57:47.760]  political violence against your enemy to disarm the American people?
[57:47.760 --> 57:55.280]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here. We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now. Now the good
[57:55.280 --> 58:02.000]  news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas. The bad news is by
[58:02.000 --> 58:06.560]  Christmas, almost every product in the store will be sold out. We won't get more for months and months
[58:06.560 --> 58:11.040]  and months. So now is the time to take action to support the info war and get the biggest sales
[58:11.040 --> 58:16.320]  of the year. We've already sold out of X two and X three and bio trusillinium and our wake up America

[59:15.680 --> 59:20.800]  info wars despite the massive law fair being waged against info wars, despite the media
[59:20.800 --> 59:27.440]  defamatory libelist campaign against info wars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy
[59:27.440 --> 59:32.640]  products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps info wars on
[59:32.640 --> 59:39.280]  the air. And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian
[59:39.280 --> 59:44.640]  oppression. So continue to do it, go to places like info wars store.com, go to the places like save
[59:44.640 --> 01:00:09.840]  info wars, continue to keep info wars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:25.360]  Concluding the coverage of the shooting in Colorado and then of course,
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.960]  the liberal supremacist democrat response.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:35.840]  Looking into what I was going to cover next and that was the issue of globalism and the global
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:42.080]  government and it hits me as I'm looking at the stack of news dealing with the global government
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:48.720]  and some of the geopolitical news stories on my desk. It just hit me and it's so obvious.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:57.200]  But we have to remember this almost everything politically policy wise that comes from the
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:06.800]  democrat party is just a feeder into the world economic forum into the one world government.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.840]  And so that's what really needs to be understood and that's what's so upsetting because
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.880]  all these all these democrat policies are all disingenuous. They don't really mean any of it.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:22.160]  It's not based in logic reasoning or even law.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:30.640]  Basic common sense. But okay, why when you when you when you realize it,
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:37.920]  if democrat party policy is just a feeder into the world economic forum, just a feeder into
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:44.240]  the global government, okay, so let's let's apply that to what they're doing with gun legislation
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:50.240]  and what they want with gun confiscation and then does it hit you? Then do you see the clear
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.040]  picture here? Do you see the bigger picture? Do you see the 10,000 foot view now? Folks,
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:01.280]  they can't have their global government with 300 million armed Americans. They ain't gonna work.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:07.920]  So yes, of course, the democrats are trying to disarm you. Of course, they're trying to
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:14.320]  chip away at the second amendment. And I think even they probably realize it's all a pipe dream
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.880]  and that it's never really going to happen. But they have to do it because they are world
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:24.320]  economic forum stuges and they are globalists. So yes, of course, they have to disarm the American
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:29.920]  people in order to get their global world government. You can't have an armed civilization.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:34.960]  You can't have America. You can't have a free people. So of course, they're going to use
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:39.760]  any and every opportunity to convince you to turn your firearms in. And of course,
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:45.360]  they're going to use it when we feel like we're at our most vulnerable, where a school gets shot
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:51.280]  or a nightclub gets shot or a movie theater gets shot. And of course, they always want to tie it
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:03:00.480]  into the politics of being gay or the politics of whatever. Oh, you feel even worse because it's
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:11.600]  a gay club. And so it's even worse that it's a gay club. See? Oh. And so that's what they do.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:19.840]  But it's really important because we can never forget that, folks. We're going to be dealing
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.520]  with an extremely heated presidential election cycle in the next two years. And we're going to
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:32.560]  be extremely distracted with all the developments domestically. But it's always important to remember
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:38.080]  what really lurks behind the Democrats and what really lurks behind the Republican establishment
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:43.920]  that is the right leg of the Democrat Party of the larger body politic that is the world economic
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:52.320]  forum that is Klaus Schwab that is the great reset that is the global government. And people
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:04:00.400]  need to understand that, especially dealing with all of these domestic political issues and policies
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:06.000]  that might not make sense. I mean, nobody should nobody should understand why the Democrats want
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  to disarm you that that should confuse everybody. You a law abiding citizen has your second amendment
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:20.400]  violated because a known criminal, a deranged lunatic who already was on FBI watch list for
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:27.280]  bombings and arrested for bombings. And he goes out and shoots a gay nightclub. And now you
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:33.200]  have to turn your gun in and now you have to be a good slave. That shouldn't make sense to anybody
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:39.440]  until you realize what's really behind it. The global world government in which you,
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:45.600]  the citizen can no longer be free. Really not that difficult. Is a slave allowed to have a firearm?
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:52.240]  No. Last time I checked slaves are not allowed to have weapons. And so why should you good slave?
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:56.640]  Are you getting it yet? Do you really think you really think slavery as a concept just goes away?
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:04.880]  No, people still want to enslave you. Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:10.880]  believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:17.760]  vapors. They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather. Of course, it wasn't the cold
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:24.720]  weather or catching a chill that killed people. What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:31.680]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3. But if you're not getting
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.800]  enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3. And then it's very easy for viruses and other
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:41.200]  things to start replicating and taking your body over. So now it's more important than ever because
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:46.240]  the winter is here to take high quality vitamin D3. And we have the best with our vitamin D3

[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:27.440]  Owen Troyer. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. We're going to move on from this issue,
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:33.920]  but just quickly here. It's frustrating and I don't want to belabor this too much. Alex Jones
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:39.920]  already covered it in the first hour as we enter the second hour of the Alex Jones show. But it's
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:47.040]  frustrating when Elon Musk says, okay, I'm going to make sure Alex Jones is still banned on Twitter
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:52.480]  because I have no mercy for anyone who would use the deaths of children for gain politics or fame.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:58.240]  So I guess Elon Musk is really, I mean, he is really feeling good about himself these days,
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:04.320]  isn't he? And so, because, you know, he's the one that should be doling out mercy. I guess that's
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:13.200]  how the position he views himself in as the owner of Twitter now. Okay, so, but by this logic, Elon,
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:17.920]  anyone who would use the deaths of children for politics, those are your own words, that's your
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:22.720]  own quote here, Elon. I have no mercy for anyone who would use the deaths of children for politics.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:33.520]  Okay, you know, that's not just Alex Jones, right? Right, Elon? Come on, Elon. Elon. Elon.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:46.400]  Who uses the deaths of kids for politics? Elon. Elon. And then, I mean, wouldn't you say if that,
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:52.720]  that, you know, politics is then used for gain and fame? So, I mean, technically, if you're using
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:08:02.240]  the deaths of children for politics, also gain and fame follow. So, Elon, I know quite a few
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:11.520]  individuals that use the death of children for politics, Elon. Hmm. Hmm. But somehow, I feel like
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:19.280]  those individuals are not going to be, or should I say, they will have mercy. It's Elon Musk's
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:26.560]  words here. So, I guess they'll have mercy, but not Alex Jones. He gets no mercy. Even though,
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:32.160]  by your own logic here, Elon, anyone who uses the death of children for politics has no, none of your
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:37.840]  mercy. But somehow, I know AOC is still on there. Somehow, I know David Hogg is still on there.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:44.800]  Somehow, I know every Democrat who's cried to take away your guns after a shooting, specifically a
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:50.560]  school shooting that involves children. I'd say they use the deaths of children for politics and
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:59.440]  therefore gain and fame. Wouldn't you, Elon? Wouldn't you? Of course, Elon. Of course. But you're not
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:04.160]  going to ban those Democrats, are you? You're not going to censor David Hogg, are you, Elon? No,
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:11.760]  just Alex Jones, isn't it? Just Alex Jones. Well, it's too bad for Elon,
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:21.840]  because he's really exposed himself in this way. But that's fine. That's fine. He can make his own
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:30.320]  decisions. He's a big boy. Now, before I get into the larger geopolitical news, folks, remember

[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:22.560]  This is Ron DeSantis. And this is, this is the message right here. This is the path to victory.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:31.600]  This is the basic stance that needs to be applied for any of our elected politicians
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:39.440]  here in America. And it's Ron DeSantis in clip 18. I want to have the values not of Davos
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:45.920]  imposed on us, but of places like Destin and Dunedin, where I grew up, things like the World
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:52.320]  Economic Forum. Those policies are dead on arrival in the state of Florida. We are not going to go
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:59.760]  down that road. Yes. Cheering roar of a standing ovation. I'm hearing it right now. Now he's in
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:04.480]  the, he's doing government business in a government building. So you don't really get that. But did
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:09.440]  you hear it? I heard it. I heard it. I heard all of America standing up, cheering, roaring,
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:18.000]  a raucous applause. Thank you, Ron DeSantis. That needs to be really if the Republicans were smart
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.640]  and the current leadership is not their globalists. Mitch McConnell is a globalist.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:32.000]  Ron McDaniel is a globalist because if they were smart, that's the exact rhetoric they would be
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.880]  telling every single one of their candidates to be injecting into their speeches, into their policies,
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.600]  all of it. We reject globalism. We reject the World Economic Forum. We reject the great reset.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:48.800]  We reject Klaus Schwab. We reject Davos. Dead on arrival.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.320]  Only Ron DeSantis though. And you think the Republicans would be smart enough because they
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:02.080]  want to pretend they're behind DeSantis, which is all just a gimmick, I think. Yes, the Republican
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:07.760]  establishment is trying to get DeSantis to run against Trump. But I don't think that's because
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.880]  they're pro DeSantis. I think that's because they're anti Trump. And they just look at DeSantis as the
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:19.760]  next guy up in the depth chart as an extremely popular governor right now. But you think maybe
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:24.400]  they would listen to a speech like that from DeSantis and then apply that party wide, but they won't.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:33.440]  And we all know why. And then here's the other side of that spectrum. Here is Macron over the weekend
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:38.320]  saying the exact opposite, that no, we need the global government in Clip 19.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:46.640]  The difference, trying to become more and more nervous. If they become very nervous and start
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:54.400]  war, it will be a big problem for the whole, the rest of the jungle. You need cooperation of a lot
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:14:03.360]  of other animals. These were all animals. Tigers, monkeys and so on. Are you on the US and the
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:10.000]  Chinese side? Because now progressively, a lot of people would like to see that there are two
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:20.720]  orders in this world. This is a huge mistake. Even for both the US and China. We need a single
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:27.120]  global order. There you go. A single global order, a one world government, a new world order. And
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.960]  they all brag about it. They all tell you about it. They're all part of the World Economic Forum now.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:38.160]  They all do the Davos meetings, the Bilderberg meetings. And it's just all right out there in
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:44.080]  front of you. I mean, does that even sound appetizing? Does that even sound good to you?
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:50.160]  A single world order, a global government? I mean, obviously you understand that means
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:54.240]  the end of freedom. They're not talking about freedom because that's not global order. You
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:00.480]  understand that, right? You understand that nothing implied there involves freedom.
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:10.000]  Whereas everything implied by Ron DeSantis is freedom. Well, geez, why can't you have a
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:17.040]  the Chinese way and the US way exist together at the same time? Well, because the US way is freedom
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:24.320]  and the Chinese way is communism. You see, yeah, that doesn't work. So which one is going to have to
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:33.440]  give? What is going to have to give Macron? What is going to have to give for your one world order?
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.000]  What is going to have to give for the global government? Do you think it's going to be
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.760]  communism or do you think it's going to be freedom? Which one do you think the World Economic Forum
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:50.960]  leaders expect you, the citizen of earth, to sacrifice the beautiful successes of communism
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:56.640]  or the human desires of freedom? Which one do you think will be sacrificed at the altar of the
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:05.280]  World Economic Forum? Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believe that people
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:11.840]  got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors. They associated
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:18.480]  these poisonous vapors with cold weather. Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:25.920]  that killed people. What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3. You see, the sun via your
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:32.480]  skin helps your body produce vitamin D3. But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.280]  vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:42.080]  your body over. So now it's more important than ever because the winter's here to take high quality
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:47.360]  vitamin D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your

[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:07.040]  taking so long? In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day. Why can't
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:12.720]  we do this here? The answer is fraud and corruption. If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:17.520]  whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or a governor to sanctimonious. They're going to deny us
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:22.880]  Michigan. They're going to deny us Pennsylvania. They're going to deny us Arizona and I can't come
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:30.480]  to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America first majority
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:37.600]  in every single one of them. So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system. Tucker Carlson
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:42.080]  said this better last night than anything else. Communications are the reason why we didn't well.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:47.920]  That's why info wars.com is so damn important. That's why they're so desperate to take you off
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:54.640]  the air, Alex. People need to get behind info wars. This alternative media that we work so hard to
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:18:00.320]  bring you is vitally important. We need more of this communications, not less. As an all-star

[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:25.600]  company. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:38.000]  Geo political news now dealing with Russia and Brazil and all tying it into the global
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.120]  government that Macron and others brag about. Macron really wants to be, he really wants to
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.520]  be the butt plug of the new world order. He likes going up and making big speeches about how much he
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:54.160]  wants to crush freedom and absorb all countries into the world government. He and Trudeau I think
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:21:02.480]  are kind of really the two that are trying to prove themselves worthy to be the first president of
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:06.080]  the world economic forum or whatever it is they think is going to happen. It looks like Macron
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:13.680]  and Trudeau really look at themselves as that future, as that demon. But let's just quickly
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:19.040]  look at what's going on in Ukraine and I'm going to try to lay it out quickly for you here so that
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:29.440]  you understand. The Ukrainians shoot 11 Russian prisoners of war in cold blood and the videos
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:36.720]  are circulating the internet, they're confirmed by the New York Times and so it's not to,
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:45.840]  I mean this is the story in the news but here's the real story. The Russians and the Ukrainians
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:55.760]  are in a civil war, that's what this is. This is a civil war in Russia and Ukraine and the
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:03.440]  West's involvement and interest is based on a few illegitimate things and then one legitimate
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:10.880]  thing and the illegitimate things are Ukraine has been a massive hive of criminality and money
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:17.520]  laundering for decades by the West, well covered, well tied into the Bidens and the Pelosi's and
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:27.200]  everybody else and now the FTX scandals may blow some of it wide open and then there's the issue
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:38.080]  of having Ukraine as kind of a, like just asking Russia to bully Ukraine so that NATO
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:44.320]  and the West can have that excuse to continue the demonization of the Russian boogeyman
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:53.360]  and then have their proxy groups operating in those regions which then ties back into the
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.800]  money laundering and the weapons laundering and everything else. So you've got, you've got the
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:01.520]  West proxy groups out there and then you've got the West money laundering crimes out there.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:06.880]  Okay and so these are the illegitimate reasons why the US is so interested in Ukraine. The
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:17.920]  legitimate reason is true that Crimea, access to the Black Sea, that is a very important region,
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:22.560]  that is a very important region for resources and it's a very important region for trade
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:31.760]  and that's why Russia took it and has it now. So that's why the West has such interest
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:36.800]  in that region. Now the region is much more important to Russia than it should be for the
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:44.000]  United States for obvious reasons but again the crimes, the proxy groups and then control of that
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:54.320]  region important to the West but okay so what's going on? Russia, I don't know how to properly
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:24:01.040]  put this because to try to cover it you first have to tear down all the propaganda and you
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:05.520]  have to tear down all the lies that the mainstream media, the Western media, the American media has
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:12.320]  told you and it's just a reminder of how corrupt and inept and pathetic the American media really
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:18.880]  is. I mean it is just, it is just an abomination but I'd have to spend 30 minutes to an hour
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:24.080]  trying to tear all that false information down. So instead let me just try to put it to you like
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:30.400]  this. Let me just try to put it to you in real layman's terms, human terms. Ukraine and Russia
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:38.160]  are in a civil war and Russia is taking major deaths, major defeats at times, overall they're
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.560]  winning and overall they've accomplished their agenda but they didn't want to see tens of thousands
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:47.840]  dead, they didn't want to see all the damage done to infrastructure, most of it actually done by
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:54.160]  Ukraine missiles provided by the West and they don't like seeing their prisoners of war get shot
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:58.320]  and raped and have their genitals cut off and torture videos and this has all been going on
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:06.320]  by Ukrainians this year and so they don't like that and so you need to understand that the only
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:15.200]  reason any of that is happening is because of the West backing Ukraine. Ukraine would not have any of
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:20.000]  this, they would not have the weapons, they would not have the support, they would not have the
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.920]  confidence to be committing these war crimes and these heinous crimes against Russians, against
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:30.080]  Ukrainians, against their own people, against innocent people, they wouldn't have any of the
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:34.800]  confidence to do any of this if they weren't getting supported by the West, by the United
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:40.480]  States of America and Russia knows that, Russia knows that and the rest of the world knows that
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:46.000]  even the NATO allies and the European countries who have mostly balked at the civil war between
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:54.080]  Russia and Ukraine know that and so the great irony is that it's been the left in recent history,
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.800]  it's been the left in modern America that has stood against wars and it's been the left as
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:05.840]  recent as the Bush years to be against America imperialism or expansionism or whatever else
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:10.320]  they want to call it and then Obama came around and launched more wars than Bush and so I guess
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:14.000]  that's why liberals shut up, shut their mouths about it all of a sudden and love war now, I mean
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.840]  that's how much Obama had them under mind control, the slick talk, the slick talking Mac Daddy, what
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:24.960]  was it, the snake-tongued Mac Daddy, Barack Obama, who by the way, I mean I'll throw this out there,
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:32.320]  here's Malik Obama over the weekend, he says, I don't hate Barack Obama, I'm just upset that he
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:38.880]  turned out to be what he is, a traitor, Malik Obama, but that's just anecdotal for you here,
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:46.480]  back to the larger issue, so why is it that the same liberal left that didn't want us involved in
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:50.880]  the Middle East wars that didn't want us involved in regime wars and called it imperialism and
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:55.680]  expansionism and America bad for it, but now they love when we're doing that in Ukraine?
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:03.200]  Why is that? Somebody explain that to me. All the wars and everything, the foreign
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:06.880]  interventions and regime change that the West has been involved in for decades,
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:12.240]  that the left, the liberals stood against, adamantly stood against, wanted you to know
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:16.800]  how against it they were and wanted to divert you signal how much better than you that they were
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:21.680]  because of it, now all of a sudden they're for it in Ukraine, now all of a sudden they love
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:24.880]  that it's happening in Ukraine, now all of a sudden they want more war in Ukraine,
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.200]  so if you thought it was bad, a million Iraqis killed, if you thought it was bad,
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:35.760]  the wars in Syria and everything else that the Western proxy groups have been behind,
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:49.280]  you thought all that was bad, folks, Russia ain't Iraq, Russia ain't Afghanistan, Russia ain't Syria,
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:57.840]  so that's not to belittle the people of those countries, it's just to say,
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:05.920]  do you think Russia is going to take this sitting down? Why do you think, why do you think the rest
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:13.680]  of the world has let the US go it alone in Ukraine? Folks, our leaders are stupid, they're out of
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:20.480]  control, they're criminally corrupt and we're being set up for a massive failure right now,
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:25.520]  we're being set up for a massive embarrassment and failure on the world stage
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:31.440]  and the fact that we haven't stopped funding Zelensky and Ukraine after the FTX scandal,
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:36.400]  the fact that we have not stopped funding and sending weapons to Ukraine after Zelensky goes on
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:42.400]  TV and says a Russian missile just hit Poland, we need it repaid in blood and it was all a lie,
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:48.880]  it just shows you, folks, you're being lied to, it's all a corrupt criminal enterprise that's
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:54.560]  going on in Ukraine and why is the liberal left falling for it? Why are you falling for it?
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:55.840]  Why are you falling for this?
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:04.000]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here, we've got the biggest sale of the year going right now,
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.840]  now the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas,

[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:05.440]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:10.560]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.960]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability to speak
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:18.640]  freely. So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:22.640]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson? I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:27.440]  years, and I knew they were planning all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere,
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:31.360]  but I couldn't have done it without your support. And now, because we've been so successful warning
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:35.760]  the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:39.920]  the globalist agenda. That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:44.240]  Info Wars has been because of your past support. So I salute you, and I thank you, and I ask you
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:49.120]  now, the critical juncture of the battle, free double your efforts by visiting infowarstore.com
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:55.200]  and getting amazing products that keep us on air. 1776 is the promo code, the destination is
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:01.440]  infowarstore.com, and I thank you all for your support. So when I first started taking Survival
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:06.080]  Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:10.960]  believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:15.600]  it. So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:19.120]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that stew, you had, you know, with a deep burden
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:23.440]  source, you know, and I got really excited about that. So I took it and man, in two weeks, I went
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:29.360]  from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again,
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:34.800]  I could connect with people again. And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:39.520]  back and I religiously took basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:43.920]  supplements. The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:47.920]  it. It's amazing, it works. But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean,
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:52.640]  we have to break free of the globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:33:10.800]  help into our own hands. Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for calling Godspeed leading
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:29.680]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:32.480]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:38.400]  Hey, don't explain on the gun issue again here.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:49.520]  You have liberals that go to drag queen drag queen tranny time for kid events
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:56.000]  at libraries. This just happened over the weekend. And you know what they do?
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:02.400]  Do you know what the liberals do at drag queen tranny time for kids? You know what they do?
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:07.920]  Get this. This is going to blow your mind now. Are you ready for this?
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:14.560]  Who came up with this idea? Do you know what they do? Do you know what liberals are doing
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:26.480]  at drag queen tranny time events? They're protecting the kids with guns. I know. I know guys.
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:32.560]  Now that might blow your mind. But we have it right here. You can see this is in Denton,
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:38.560]  Denton County, Texas. And you see that the left decided to show up with armed men
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:46.400]  in full blown military outfits with their guns. There you go. Just freeze frame it right there
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:50.960]  for me. There you go, guys. There it is right there. Look at that. They got their walkie
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:58.880]  talkies and their headsets fully, fully body armor and fully armed ready to go to protect those kids.
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:09.520]  Now, I'm just, I'm just trying to put it all together here. So we protect the kids at drag
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:15.280]  queen tranny time with guns. We protect them from the big bad conservatives.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:23.440]  But we don't protect the kids at schools with guns at the school. The answer is to disarm.
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:28.800]  Gotcha. I'm just trying to make sense of it all here. That's all I'm just asking the
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:32.000]  essence of questions trying to make sense of all. So that's where we're at now,
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.080]  Libs. Is that where the liberal energy is at now? Is that where the liberal
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:43.920]  logic is at? We protect the kids at the drag queen tranny time events with guns,
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:50.400]  armed men with guns, but not at the schools. That's when it's bad. Gotcha. Just making sure.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.720]  Just got to figure it all out here, folks. We're just trying to figure it all out. We're all just
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:36:02.400]  as confused as they are. Again, I want to move on from this, but there's other geopolitical issues
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:10.240]  to cover. I just, it's just so sick the disservice the American media is doing. And it's just so
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:17.440]  disgusting because in a way, folks, I mean, it's not to say one thing is more evil than the other.
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:22.080]  I mean, if you think it was bad what the US did in Iraq or you think it was bad what the US did
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:26.400]  in Afghanistan, well, you better realize it might even be worse. What's going on in Ukraine. It's
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:33.200]  not yet as far as lives lost, but it could be much worse. The only reason why you have
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:39.040]  these Ukrainian groups running around, berserking, murdering people, torturing people,
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:43.920]  chopping off Russians genitals is because they know they have the US is backing.
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.760]  And so they're told by their leaders, look, we just got a new shipment of arms from the West
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:54.000]  and they celebrate. Look, we just got 10 billion more dollars from the US and they celebrate and
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.040]  then they feel empowered to go out, capture 11 Russians, torture them and murder them on camera.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.640]  And Putin knows all this, by the way. Putin knows the only reason they're so inflamed,
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:09.680]  the only reason they're so confident in these war crimes is because they have the US is backing.
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:14.400]  So you think it was bad in Afghanistan, you think it was bad in Iraq, you better realize
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:19.200]  how bad it is in Ukraine too. It might not be the US soldiers on the ground doing it,
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:26.560]  but it's our weapons, it's our confirmation, it's our training. That's what's going on.
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:34.000]  And Putin is not, Putin and Russia are not Afghanistan, Putin and Russia are not Iraq.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.480]  And it's just amazing that the people can't see this.
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:46.400]  And again, I'll move on, but when you see this, you need to understand what the Russians are
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:50.320]  thinking. You need to understand what Putin is thinking because nobody else is telling you.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:56.640]  Ukrainians shoot 11 Russian prisoners of war in cold blood. They've tortured others, they've
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:00.480]  chopped up others, they've chopped off the genitals of others. This is what the sick,
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:05.040]  depraved Ukrainians are doing right now while they're bombing their own people, by the way.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:11.600]  And you need to know the problems between the Russians and Ukrainians have always been there,
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:19.920]  but now that it's the West that's backing this level of it and encouraging this level of it,
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:24.080]  you need to understand now that the Russians and Vladimir Putin are really looking at the US
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:32.000]  differently now and really a disdain is growing in their heart. And would you say we deserve it if
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.520]  we deserved it in Iraq, if we deserved it in Afghanistan? Because the left would have said that.
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:45.040]  But they're under total mind control and the American media says this war is good.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:53.760]  This war is good. War good in Ukraine. Killing Russians good for you. And meanwhile,
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:39:02.400]  they don't realize that in the big global picture, the US is getting left in the dust and that,
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:09.760]  see, and really here's what it comes down to. Let me try to give you the practical application
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:19.040]  of this. What is one thing that the US and the West has always had as leverage against the East
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:24.640]  or against China or against Russia or these other countries? What has it been practically speaking?
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:33.040]  Sanctions. It's been sanctions. And so China has been worried about sanctions and Russia will be
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:37.760]  worried about sanctions and these other countries will be worried about sanctions that will be put
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:44.800]  on them by the West if they don't adhere to what the West is requesting. And usually this goes
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:52.560]  relatively smoothly for the West because it was aligned on most of these geopolitical issues.
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:58.640]  It's not aligned on Russia and Ukraine. It's only America now. And so they don't have the threat
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:05.360]  of sanctions, folks. Any threats or applied sanctions to Russia or China or Syria or anything
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:10.640]  like that are empty in case you haven't noticed. They take those sanctions and they rip them up
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:17.280]  and they piss on them. So that geopolitical leverage that the West has always had with
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:23.760]  sanctions over these countries is gone. Gone. And I don't even think they bother with the
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:28.400]  sanctions anymore because they know it's worthless. At the beginning of this, they talked about
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:32.640]  sanctions and they issued sanctions, but it was a hollow shell. It was a nothing burger,
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:36.880]  so they kind of just gave it up. Yeah, Russia doesn't care about sanctions anymore. China
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:41.680]  doesn't care about sanctions anymore. In case you haven't noticed, they don't need America anymore.
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:48.640]  Now we're in a situation where we need them because Biden is a corrupt and compromised president
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:56.080]  that gets blackmailed by Russia and blackmailed by China and so he can't do anything to help us.
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.280]  But he doesn't even really know what's going on.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:07.920]  So that's the situation you have. The US is not in control of the situation because we don't have
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:14.400]  the power of sanctions and Russia and China and India and Brazil and Mexico and Saudi Arabia and
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:20.080]  Qatar and all these other countries are moving on and Biden is sitting here, sanctions, sanctions,
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:25.120]  funding, funding and the American people are getting screwed and the American media is not
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:31.680]  even telling you the real story here, which is that the US has lost almost all persuasion,
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:39.440]  all influence over the geopolitical world and markets and now Russia and China and the rest of
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:46.880]  them who normally would have to respond and flinch at the threat of sanctions no longer do and could
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:56.160]  not care less and now Russia who I think for years I think Putin has liked the West. I think
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:02.000]  Putin has wanted a relationship with the West. I think he's even been had admiration for the
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:12.400]  Western lifestyle and I think now sadly that is all fading because of what Joe Biden and the
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:18.720]  United States government and military is doing in Ukraine and so any hopes that we had of strong
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:23.360]  relations with Russia are pretty much gone now folks. I don't even know if Trump can repair him
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.480]  at this point. When you've got Russian troops getting slaughtered, when you've got Russian troops
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:34.800]  getting tortured, when you've got Ukrainians chopping off Russian troops, genitals and filming
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:41.040]  it and saying you know hey go say hi to your wife and then they chop their their genitals off on the
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:46.480]  camera and they know that the only reason the Ukrainians are doing that is because the confidence
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:51.280]  and the weapons instilled by the West. I don't know if it can ever be repaired folks.

[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:07.840]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:12.400]  life. InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:18.560]  supplement that contains both. This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:23.440]  be your next purchase from the InfoWars store. The rose hips contained within are a part of the
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:29.760]  rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds. Natural chemicals found
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:34.960]  in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions including those with osteo
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:40.400]  arthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown. As for vitamin C and zinc
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:45.760]  themselves you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:50.640]  and the maintenance of your everyday health. It has been reported that intake of both is often
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:56.240]  inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit be sure to check
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:02.240]  it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie. I'm Dr. Peter McCullough

[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:21.280]  it's alex jones
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:40.080]  all right what's going on in brazil is historic and it's got the media blackout because it's
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:44.880]  legitimate it's organic it's not controlled by the globalists and so they don't want you to know
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:53.760]  about it powerful demonstration of we the people happening now in brazil and the truckers have
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:59.600]  now gotten involved and the latest with that is the truckers are blocking off access to
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:06.720]  important airports and other stuff that's in addition to the brazilian farmers that are
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:12.000]  organizing that's getting bigger and then of course just the general population that supported
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:18.240]  bolson aro by the millions out in the streets every day now you heard it here at first because
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:26.000]  info wars is next year's news today that the biggest difference between brazil's stolen
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:32.800]  election and america's stolen election is that the brazilian military is with bolson aro and
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:38.880]  behind bolson aro you did not have that phenomenon in america the military was actually against
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:48.240]  trump the military in brazil is for bolson aro and i would say my general consensus on as to why
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:55.760]  that's the case the globalist seized control of the u.s military for obvious reasons and then we've
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:02.720]  seen the dastardly deeds of the globalist controlled u.s military the globalists never really had that
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:09.760]  initiative or takeover of the brazilian military and that's because it wasn't going to be used for
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:15.120]  globalist operations and most individuals that join the brazilian military join it because they
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:20.720]  love brazil and they actually want to go into the crime-ridden areas and deal with the cartels
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:26.320]  many of them have suffered at the hands of the the cartels and the favelas what have you and so
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:32.800]  they join the military because they actually want to see crime stopped in brazil they actually want
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:36.320]  to go after criminals they're real brazilian patriots and they don't go overseas and fight a
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:44.000]  bunch of globalist wars so that's why the situation in brazil is different right now and also you
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:50.160]  don't have near the corruption of the bureaucracy which is not nearly as big and so what do you
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:54.960]  have is you have the corrupt supreme court in brazil but you don't have the corrupt bureaucracy
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:02.640]  like you do in the west that set up americans and patriots on january 6 as their rishtag moment so
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:08.960]  that our million man march would be scuttled and subdued and then our free speech chilled on the
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:15.440]  issue of rigged or stolen elections but that's not happening in brazil they didn't have the military
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:20.000]  globalist control they didn't have their military under globalist control and they didn't have the
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:29.120]  gigantic federal bureaucracies aimed against the people so the response has been now from their
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:32.800]  own deep state which is mostly the supreme court they're trying to get control of the presidency
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:39.280]  again with lula lula minister signs order allowing child services to take children away from free
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:44.000]  election protesters so there you go so oh you're you're protesting in brazil oh you're out in the
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:52.800]  street waving a brazilian flag you lose your kids brazilians protesting election results have their
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:51:02.320]  bank accounts frozen so that's what's going on i don't know what's gonna happen next folks but there
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:10.480]  is going to be some form of a standoff here and i don't think the millions of brazilians are just
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:18.080]  going to go home they might threaten to take their children i don't think they'll actually be able to
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:23.280]  pull that off if they do the military will step in at that point i think they know it that that's
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:28.400]  the standoff they have as far as the bank accounts being frozen they'll be able to work around that
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:32.880]  they'll find ways to work around that and they and they will deal with that
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:40.320]  but we'll see i the real standoff here is are you really going to start taking kids
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.800]  because i don't think the brazilian military is going to stand for that and and i think that if
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:54.800]  anything good happens it's going to be the corrupt judge on the supreme court may be getting a bit
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:52:01.520]  of a come up and sear uh politically legally lawfully with the military involved i don't know
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:08.320]  if bolzano is planning on sticking around through all of this but there are still the millions in
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:15.680]  the streets and that situation is developing now here's where it all ties in and this is why they
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:23.200]  have to have lula as the president of brazil because bolzano would never sign brazil onto
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:31.920]  the global government and this just came out from the g20 in egypt rich countries agree to pay for
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:37.040]  climate damages and poor nations so oh a poor nation has a flood a poor nation has a earthquake
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:46.240]  whatever now you have to pay for it that's what they say rich nations rich nations oh our nations
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:52.320]  are rich because they stole the wealth from the people because they're dirty commies but now that's
[01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:57.440]  the agreement is oh there was a there was a mudslide oh there was a flood or there was an earthquake
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:02.160]  oh there was a hurricane oh there was this and now and now you have to pay for it that's now your
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:07.760]  duty to pay for that because you're a bad guy causing climate change which they used to call
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:15.120]  global warming but they don't anymore why well here's why south pole hits record cold temperatures
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:23.920]  for november south pole record cold temperatures for november yes that's why they said it's not
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:31.440]  global warming anymore don't you know because it never was it never was and then macron tells you
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:37.440]  we need the world government poland finland and latvia to construct huge barbed wire fences on
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:45.600]  borders with russia and belarus the irony here is great because poland and finland and latvia
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:52.960]  at least at this stage russia is of no threat to them at all but of course the irony is they'll let
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:58.880]  in mass migrants from other countries just pour across their border and that's fine but russia
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:03.200]  who's not even coming across the border they're gonna build the wall to stop the russians who
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:10.560]  aren't even coming i saw me yeah that'd be like if the us that'd be like if biden came out and said
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:16.720]  we're gonna build a wall on the bering strait or we're gonna build a wall on alaska to keep the
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:24.960]  russians out you'd say what russians they say you know the russians are coming so we built a wall
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:28.800]  on the bering strait and we built the wall in alaska to keep the russians out meanwhile down at the
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:37.120]  southern border you have over five million illegal immigrant crossings since january 2021
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:42.320]  but we're building a wall on the bering strait to stop the russians who aren't even coming here
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:50.720]  and don't want to because they look at the west as a crap hole now as does much the rest of the
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:56.160]  planet and i don't buy that i don't believe that i think we have a great country here i think we got
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:02.320]  bad leadership and a lot of cleaning up to do because of it but i think america can once
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:08.000]  be returned to its glory and really all it requires is just giving the freedom back to the people
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:13.840]  giving freedom independence prosperity back to the people it's all it takes you can turn it around
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:22.320]  like that like flipping on a light bulb that's all it will take but that's why they're constantly
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:26.960]  trying to expand the government find new reasons to expand the government trying to disarm you so
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:32.240]  that they can expand the government without any backlash or threats of a backlash it's called
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:37.760]  tyranny folks it's called tyranny and if america falls to tyranny then i don't know where the world
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:45.920]  goes i don't know where the world goes from that and now we're going to have to be dealing with
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:51.200]  the next two years of biden and it's just going to be a disaster and even if they do get biden out
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:56.720]  in in the form and fashion that i talked about earlier on the show it's not going to be good
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:02.480]  and and that's why at this point i mean disantis might be better domestically but the only person
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:07.280]  that can get us out of this geopolitical international hole that joe biden has buried us in
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:12.560]  basically a grave i mean we're basically in a grave geopolitically speaking and the only chance
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:18.320]  we have i think to get out of that grave is is trump or you could just say we don't need the
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:23.360]  rest of the world let's just be independent disantis will be better for that i i could agree with that
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:26.880]  potentially but disantis hasn't even announced he's going to run so i don't want to get out

[01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:59.520]  slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:06.560]  to take our election seriously when we we just it's election month alex it's not election day
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:13.920]  and that's the problem and everything changed after covid-19 they illegally changed state elections
[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:20.240]  mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:24.880]  well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country when we have elections that
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:30.560]  can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe the election was stolen in 2020
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:36.400]  and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and the democrats to attack
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:43.120]  us that that question our election integrity and question the the fact that elections um shouldn't
[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:52.000]  be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election realists leading a frontal assault
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:56.320]  on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:09.680]  all right
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:15.120]  should we call this upcoming phenomenon
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:24.800]  where the biden crime family is going to be in the crosshairs of an investigation
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:31.120]  it actually already has been all the evidence has already been collected they're just waiting
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:39.680]  to get the subpoena power with republican control of the house and you've got a new book coming out
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:45.760]  from john paul mac isek he's the one where hunter biden left the laptop and part of me still kind of
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:52.880]  i don't know if it even matters i mean maybe it does how is it that hunter biden and ashley biden
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:58.560]  both just happened to leave extremely compromising documents out there for the public to find like
[02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:03.440]  really that's just a coincidence did they do it intentionally are they really that inept and incompetent
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:15.440]  but a book is coming out tomorrow american injustice my battle to expose the truth about
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:21.200]  how when he reported the hunter biden laptop the feds came after him instead of investigating
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:27.280]  the crimes on the laptop but now you've got cbs news with their big sunday night news special
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:31.200]  saying it's the hunter biden laptop it's real it shows all the crimes of the biden crime family
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:36.480]  oh really we knew that two years ago wow you guys are playing catch up huh two years after
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:43.120]  biden gets into office now you want to break that story gotcha and then here's some of the response
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:49.200]  from the democrats here's zoey lofgren on the issue with cbs in clip 10
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:57.760]  you sit on the judiciary committee you just heard roger is saying say that he thinks the
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:03.200]  u.s. attorney in delaware is sufficient in terms of being able to independently decide on what to
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:10.000]  do with hunter biden and that case i wonder if you agree with that or if you think your republican
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:16.400]  colleagues are right to ask for a special counsel to deal with the current president son well i don't
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:21.840]  know anything about that case i don't know anything about anything but you have oversight of the justice
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:28.160]  department yes but we don't uh you know i serve with mike pence on the judiciary committee we don't
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:35.040]  oversee and interfere with individual investigations there's supposed to that would be improper in
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:41.120]  terms of oversight that yeah we don't oversee we're just the oversight committee we don't do any
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:49.040]  overseeing of anything we're just the oversight committee ah thank you thank you but here's a
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:56.480]  keem jeffreys who denied that trump ever won an election so he's an election denier and he says
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:03.280]  they're going to be defending joe biden in these upcoming days in clip 13 publicans announced this
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:07.680]  week their oversight plans which include taking a look at the withdrawal from afghanistan the
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:14.480]  origins of coveted the fbi search at marlago i can see that there could be theoretically legitimate
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:19.920]  oversight questions on on each of those topics it could be asked will house democrats participate
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:25.280]  in these investigations in good faith or do you see it as your role to defend the biden administration
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:33.520]  but we will absolutely defend the biden administration and his track record of success
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:42.160]  if it comes under assault by people attempting to politicize our governmental responsibilities
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:49.520]  without question yes and and this is just like how they denied inflation they said there was no
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:54.080]  inflation then they said well there's a little inflation but it's good for you then they said
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:58.480]  well it's inflation but it's just temporary and then it kept going and so now what do the democrats
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:06.320]  say they say well what's the republican plan for inflation uh to get democrats out the plan
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:12.240]  get by now that's only plan you need they don't need a plan other than to get you out of the way but
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:16.560]  this is going to be the battle now inside the republican party establishment house republicans
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:21.280]  oppose impeaching joe biden who's going to get control of the house well if it's kevin mccarthy
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:28.560]  in charge i don't have much faith and that's sad to say because marjorie taylor green who i
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:35.360]  who i like and trust has said kevin mccarthy's the way to go but is kevin mccarthy going to allow
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:40.560]  the republicans forget about even impeachment how about to just investigate the biden crime family
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:45.840]  first let's let's get the subpoenas let's get into that lab top let's do investigations and then
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:50.640]  let's do that right and then maybe talk about impeachment but the establishment republicans
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:05:02.240]  are already trying to scuttle this before it even gets going until about 150 years ago cultures all
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:09.040]  over the world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:15.840]  called vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:21.520]  the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:30.080]  vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:35.440]  getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:39.840]  things you start replicating and taking your body over so now it's more important than ever because
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:45.200]  the winter is here to take high quality vitamin d3 and we have the best with our vitamin d3 gummies

[02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:19.200]  transmission you are the resistance and now your host olyn shroyer i'm now joined by alex
[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:27.520]  tovetsky and he is the author of the communist rather the uncommunist manifesto he covers
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:34.240]  crypto bitcoin and he wants to come on to get into the latest with the ftx scandal here's
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:40.800]  some of the recent headlines senator josh holly demands correspondence between federal officials
[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:46.000]  and democrat party leaders following ftx collapse and why the scheme was only revealed after the
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:54.000]  midterm elections ftx tether the cia drug cartels money laundering in the ukraine and then i'm telling
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:59.680]  you this is the i think this is the one that's going to be used to distract us freaky ftx sam
[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:06.000]  bankman freed and his girlfriend caroline ellison had unusual ideas about group sex uh yeah folks it
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:13.200]  wasn't just ideas okay and and and look i don't want to be the one to reveal this because i just
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:18.160]  don't want to be the one to reveal it but the fact that they're not making a bigger story out of the
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:23.680]  weird sex stuff and orgy stuff that they were doing tells me that they're holding that back
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:28.400]  and so whenever the real crimes and money laundering and stuff is revealed then they're
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:32.320]  going to distract you with the shiny object in their left hand and say oh did you know they were
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:38.320]  having orgies there look here's a naked picture of caroline see oh it's all already out there and
[02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:44.880]  they don't really want to push that it tells me they're intentionally holding it back so alex you
[02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:51.520]  cover crypto bitcoin you're following the ftx story i mean we've got a lot of the details i think
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:57.120]  the picture is becoming pretty clear to me on this scandal uh so why don't you just talk about
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:08:02.320]  the big picture here what you think this is all about and with all the information we have what
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:08.240]  is the conclusions that you've reached as far as the ftx scandal is concerned oh and thanks for having
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:15.440]  me on it's good to be back on info was look the this is the big picture it i would argue and many
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:20.000]  other bitcoins that i respect would also argue that we've probably reached the state level attack
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:30.800]  on bitcoin and if anything that's what ftx may have been so i i met sam uh back in 2021 uh there
[02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:34.960]  was uh there was a conference the bitcoin conference in miami and there was a little boat
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:38.880]  party that i went on and i had a quick chat with him and at that point i had absolutely no idea who
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:44.080]  he was he was this like weird guy that was um sitting there eating like all the hors d'oeuvres
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:47.280]  and um and i had a quick chat with him and some dude told me he's like oh he's the guy who owned
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:54.640]  ftx and i said what's ftx and they said oh it's the fastest growing crypto exchange in the world
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:58.720]  and i was like i've never heard of this shit and the guy came out of nowhere basically
[02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:05.680]  never heard of him before 2020 2021 may have heard of him somewhere and then out of nowhere came
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:14.400]  you know the second biggest exchange on the planet and to me what that means is that you know he
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:19.920]  was obviously funded by someone uh that i mean as we've seen there's you know money laundering
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:23.920]  there's all this stuff you know money to ukraine you know i mean i've got one here where you know
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:29.920]  he was giving 20 million dollars to covet uh researchers um he was on a panel that was
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:35.040]  supposed to be upcoming with zehlensky with zuckerberg with jenet yellen so these people are all
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:41.360]  part of the same little cabal and the big picture thing to take out of this is that this
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:48.560]  vindicates the reason that bitcoin exists not crypto there is a massive separation between
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:56.240]  those two there is bitcoin that lives here which is money that no individual no state no institution
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:01.120]  no corporation no ftx that nobody can touch this is why people like sam they were always bashing
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:05.840]  on bitcoin they're always saying it's shit it slowed all the crap that they say and they did
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:09.600]  and correct me if i'm wrong here and just so you know we're on trustful radio so we can't curse
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:15.360]  it's okay but just just we can't curse on trustful radio but ftx they weren't actually doing any bitcoin
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:20.960]  transactions right i mean they were not working with bitcoin no they're they're an exchange so they
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:26.720]  they allow people to trade so so these things are designed to basically get people somewhere to gamble
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:32.000]  that's completely the opposite of why bitcoin exists bitcoin exists as money that allows people to
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:38.080]  save immune from government confiscation immune from inflation immune from taxation immune from
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:43.840]  all of the things that normal traditional fiat money is not immune from now what happens is
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:48.720]  all these crypto people have popped up whether it's ethereum whether it's salana whether it's
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:54.000]  ftx whether it's buy off all of this crap is a distraction kind of like what you said about the
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:00.320]  sex take it's a distraction to get people to not understand what bitcoin is because the thing
[02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:07.360]  that the establishment fears the most is a people who have their wealth intact whose wealth you cannot
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:12.560]  confiscate from them and you know this is a more important because here's the problem that i think
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:18.640]  sometimes and it's not it's not any fault of their own because it's a it's a relatively new concept
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:26.000]  financial concept for people to understand what why people support bitcoin and this is why my big
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:30.880]  my big problem with the bitcoin community talking about whether it's worth 6000 or 60 000 you're doing
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:35.680]  yourself a disservice because it shouldn't matter whether it's worth 60 000 or 6000 that might be a
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:40.480]  nice promotional thing for people to look at it but at the end of the day people need to understand
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:46.160]  it's a decentralized currency it's all about getting government getting central bankers out
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:50.880]  of the transactional process so it's like let's say you've got one stack of cash you've got two
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:56.080]  stacks of cash you've got one stack of cash here you got one stack of cash here and you say okay
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:01.840]  you get to pick which stack of cash you want and you're like okay but hold on this stack of cash
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:05.200]  is going to be controlled by a bunch of other people and they're going to tell you how to spend
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:08.480]  it where to spend it how much you can spend of it and they're going to take a little off the top
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:12.480]  every transaction this stack of cash over here you just take it you whatever you want with it
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:15.680]  well which stack of cash are you going to want you're obviously going to want that's not going to
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:21.040]  be oversawed and it's not going to have the taxing and all of it on it and so that's kind of when I
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:26.240]  try to explain the concept of bitcoin and I'm not a big bitcoin supporter I like decentralized
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:30.960]  currencies absolutely but that's that's the big issue that people need to understand that's why
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:36.400]  the state's attacking it to get back to where you're at that's why bitcoin is under attack that's
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:41.600]  why cryptocurrency has a concept is under attack because the central bankers in the big governments
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:48.000]  need that control over the monetary policies need that control over the money otherwise they can't
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:55.440]  really enslave us anymore well I mean this is why they're pushing for cbdcs uh if for those who
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:00.080]  don't know what that means it's central bank digital currency now the easiest way for them to launch
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:06.960]  cbdcs is actually going to be to partner with an institution or a foundation or an organization
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:12.080]  that is running a current cryptocurrency the most likely one in my mind is going to be ethereum
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:16.320]  there's probably some other ones like you know cardano and this and that that people that the
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:21.360]  government and the state is most likely to partner with but this is why I always differentiate
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:29.120]  for people bitcoin versus crypto they are unrelated crypto is just digital fiat that's it
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:35.040]  and it sits it is far it's got far more in common with the u.s dollar or the euro or the australian
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:42.720]  dollar or the yen or you name the the government issued uh you know uh coin whatever you want to
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:50.640]  place in there so it's important for people to realize sovereign money and not feeding your
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:56.320]  jailers is actually how you fight back so when we talk about just I want to also mention the
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:14:02.160]  piece that you said about the uh the bitcoin price now money is supposed to like if you
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:11.120]  think about what money represents money represents the the collective product of society right it
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:15.840]  represents the time the energy and the natural resources within the society and money is a
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:21.920]  technology or a tool that enables people to do a couple things number one is store that product
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:27.120]  that value transact that product that value and measure that so it's kind of like a language of
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:34.000]  value so when you think about that you can't print time you can't print energy and you can't
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:39.200]  print physical resources out of nothing so these things are all fixed and finite in nature so a
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:45.760]  perfect money would also be fixed and finite in nature and that's what bitcoin is bitcoin is kind
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:53.920]  of like this perfect money that is fixed it's immutable you can't change it and nobody can
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:58.000]  change the rules in the same way as nobody can change time nobody can change energy nobody can
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:03.760]  change natural resources this is what the establishment is most afraid of and this is why
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:09.680]  they support whether it's crypto they'll support ethereum they'll support things like ftx they'll
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:14.240]  you know when ftx blows up everyone freaks out and they think the problem is bitcoin
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:20.240]  when the problem is what's happening here that's why i say it's an attack on on bitcoin specifically
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:26.640]  as is all of crypto well let's get into that on the other side of this break because i i do think
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:32.640]  this was an organic takedown of ftx i don't think the deep state had origins of taking this down
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:37.920]  why would they they were laundering so much money but as we know communists don't let a good crisis
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:42.400]  go away so of course they're going to use this to attack crypto eventually bitcoin is going to be
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:48.880]  their biggest shark but i i feel like they're kind of not they're treading lightly on the bitcoin ground
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:53.840]  right now because they know bitcoiners are really good advocates for crypto and so they don't want
[02:15:53.840 --> 02:16:01.680]  to anger you guys too much i've noticed alex why is this taking so long why is this taking so long
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:06.640]  in france they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day why can't we do this here the
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:12.640]  answer is fraud and corruption if we don't fix the system it doesn't matter whether republican nominees
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:18.000]  donald trump or governor de sanctimonious they're going to deny us michigan they're going to deny us

[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:38.560]  we need to keep fighting for reform of the system tucker carlson said this better last night than
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:44.800]  anything else communications are the reason why we didn't well that's why info wars.com is so damn

[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:26.240]  ago but on air 28 years and i knew they were planning all of this and i warned the public as a modern
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:30.800]  paul revere but i couldn't have done it without your support and now because we've been so successful
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:35.360]  warning the population of the planet not just america we're public enemy number one when it comes
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:39.600]  to globalists agenda that's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful

[02:20:02.400 --> 02:20:16.240]  of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:27.360]  alex svecki wrote the uncommon is manifesto you gotta like that got great reviews you can
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:35.600]  read it for yourself find out why and we're talking crypto ftx crash bitcoin and everything else
[02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:44.560]  and so you got into the state attack on bitcoin you mentioned that in the last segment now to me
[02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:51.360]  from my perspective i think that this collapse was organic now maybe at some point in time they did
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:57.280]  plan on writing spf and ftx out as their controlled collapse to eventually go after crypto but i think
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:21:05.120]  at this point it was organic i think the the binance guy calling spf out was organic and then the
[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:09.600]  response has basically been the old as you know communist response don't let a good crisis go
[02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:14.960]  to waste so of course with it all crashing down they're trying to take control of it do you agree
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:20.560]  with that analysis do you do you agree with me that this wasn't organic fallout or do you think
[02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:28.400]  this was a controlled fallout from the very beginning so it was so so to clarify i think
[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:37.680]  ftx was a state-sponsored actor but i think the collapse 100 percent was a was an organic thing
[02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:42.640]  because they had no money on the balance sheet like so all that had to happen at some point
[02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:49.120]  was the the leverage to to crush them simple as that like you can only you it was the same thing
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:55.520]  that happened in 2008 you know the there's only so much you can basically you know play
[02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:59.520]  icarus right you jump off a cliff you think for the first three seconds that you're flying and
[02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:04.400]  then gravity catches up and you're gone so you know on a longer time on a longer timescale
[02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:10.720]  ftx was certainly a state actor or at least i shouldn't say certainly seemingly a state actor
[02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:15.760]  because of the way he came out of nowhere you know 36 billion dollar company out of nothing
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:20.960]  um that just doesn't happen magically well let's not let's not let's point out the obvious too i mean
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:28.880]  bankman freed and caroline um ellison are both deeply tied to top political activists they're
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:35.200]  both deeply tied to the democrat party i mean there's no denying that yep yep so but the the
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:42.560]  collapse i think was as you said organic now the thing is my guess was the the state-sponsored attack
[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:49.200]  component was that they they would have known that this would fall over at some point because you
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:54.480]  can't just you know create 36 billion dollars out of thin air and think that it's gonna last forever
[02:22:54.480 --> 02:23:01.120]  right so you know if you're an intelligent state actor for example you do this you'd find a way to
[02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:05.680]  funnel basically 10 billion dollars from someone else's pocket funnel it to whatever you want to
[02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:12.240]  launder it and then when you know what inevitably blows up you've got you know two prime candidates
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:17.600]  to throw under the bus number one and number two you've got a scapegoat that you can blame which
[02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:23.360]  is bitcoin and then they'll say oh but we need regulation you know so that way they can tie
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:29.760]  people up one more to stop them from being able to buy bitcoin as much as possible i mean but the
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:34.160]  thing is you know as we know the government's great at stopping things not you know they couldn't
[02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:39.280]  stop alcohol they couldn't stop weed they couldn't stop anything so the last thing on the planet they
[02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:45.520]  gonna stop is some code so it's gonna backfire them in the long run but i mean you know that what
[02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:50.480]  unfortunately this is just gonna scare off some people who think that the problem was with bitcoin
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:55.600]  not with decentralized platforms well bitcoin investors like that because the price gets lower
[02:23:55.600 --> 02:24:02.640]  for them and that's when you feel bullish totally um now you had mentioned you had met sbf i guess
[02:24:02.640 --> 02:24:06.240]  was at a crypto event you had met him and and look you know i want to be clear on something here
[02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:12.480]  because i'm getting some pushback and and flak from this folks i'm not trying to be inconsiderate
[02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:19.600]  i'm not trying to be uh what's the word that i'm looking for here when i talk about sbf and
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:26.640]  caroline ellison having uh learning disabilities or being on a autism spectrum again i don't say
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:32.480]  that to be rude or that that you know i'm uncaring towards those people that's not the case at all
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:38.160]  all but i think it's important to point that out because what i think was going on here and it's
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:43.920]  it's a it's a sad thing to have to face i think that these two were used to be the fall guys like
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:48.640]  you said it's the perfect fall girl perfect fall guy maybe don't really fully understand what they're
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:53.280]  getting into they're young you know maybe have a learning disability maybe on the autism spectrum
[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:57.520]  not really know what's going on but flush with all this cash putting all this power told by people
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:01.920]  in powerful positions hey it's all gonna be great it's all gonna be good and then it all collapses
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:05.680]  around them and somehow sam bankman free to still running around he hasn't even been arrested
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:11.920]  so i'm not saying that to be insensitive i think it just shows how this whole thing
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:19.040]  was a money laundering operation from the very beginning and sbf and ellison were just put into
[02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:26.480]  these positions to be the fall guys and girls you should see a tweet that i um put up earlier today
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:30.640]  which is you know that death tweet way is like going through each door and like you know killing
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:36.560]  a new head um you know so you had uh docan who was the the one who blew up that stable coin
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:41.920]  and there was alex meshinsky uh celcius which all the bitcoin is warned against now there's sbf
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:45.680]  who else looks and feels and sounds similar
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:54.960]  vitalik from ethereum there we go that's the one so it's it's the same archetype same kind of person
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:26:03.280]  you know same kind of you know the basically the what they they they select them because they
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:08.160]  look like the wonder boy you know they they're either on you know some spec the asperger spectrum
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:13.280]  or the autism spectrum there's a physiognomy there's a clear physiognomy physiognomy thank you
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:18.480]  yes yes yes so people that think that you know ethereum and all these sorts of things are different
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:23.440]  they're in for a rude surprise i want to i had a train of thought before just about the um
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:28.000]  the fixed supply of money that i mentioned and i just wanted to sort of give people i wanted to
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:34.240]  tie that example off before we go down another path but this is just for people to take this away
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:38.560]  because i know listeners of this show will be probably very bullish things like gold because
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:43.920]  you know it's been money for thousands of years and we we you know it's an established form of
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:52.720]  monetary unit but think about this the first people who discovered gold while the rest of
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:57.600]  the world were still using a mixture of salt and seashells and glass beads and other things like
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:03.760]  that for money um imagine what the value of gold was at that point in time you could have found a
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:08.560]  big nugget of gold and you wouldn't have been able to buy anything with it because gold was
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:15.040]  valueless in the beginning now what's important to note is that the reason gold emerged over thousands
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:24.320]  of years as the number one money that civilizations from all around the world you know independently
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:31.360]  selected as money was because it had superior properties for users money it was recognizable
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:36.560]  it was extremely durable it's the only inert metal uh on the planet that is inert at um
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:43.200]  room temperature it is extremely portable uh it is very scarce you can't just you know make it up
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:48.800]  out of thin air you know the alchemist's dream of you know creating basically you know soil into
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:53.920]  gold so it had all these attributes which meant that the whole world converged and this is actually
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:59.440]  what appreciated the purchasing power of gold over about five thousand years so what people
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:04.800]  need to think of this is this is the edge with bitcoin is that it is going to do what gold did
[02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:11.520]  in five thousand years maybe in fifty it'll monetize every single like it'll suck the the
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:18.080]  excess monetization in every other asset class on the planet into itself as the entire world
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:24.880]  starts to look for a place to store the product of their labor to store their savings they want to
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:30.960]  put it in a place that is safe secure and has the ultimate properties where you can store money
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:37.200]  can't be inflated you can send it to him however you want and you can accurately know your proportion
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:41.840]  in relation to the whole you can't do that with any other money especially not some other you
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:47.280]  know altcoins so it's just important to know it and I wanted to just tie that loop close up on that
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:52.240]  on the other side of this break alex sevetsky author the uncommunist manifesto will be right back
[02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:03.280]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here we've got the biggest sale of the year going right now now the good news

[02:30:14.240 --> 02:30:20.240]  shutdowns and and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible it made any resistance
[02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:26.240]  to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite the massive law fair being
[02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:32.480]  waged against info wars despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against info wars the

[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:34.960]  well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones and now your host owin shroyer
[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:43.040]  all right finishing up here with alex savitsky again the book the uncomunist manifesto
[02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:49.600]  is his book and then also we'll figure out where you can follow him for all of his other
[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:56.160]  crypto coverage connecting dots that i because i don't really follow the crypto stuff i mean
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:03.440]  obviously the ftx spf thing has gone well beyond the realms of crypto but to see the other
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:09.360]  crypto currencies that might collapse next and that long line that he showed in the last segment
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:16.640]  was certainly interesting to me so uh final segment here alex so what what else do people
[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:21.520]  need to know what do you think is going to be the final conclusion of the ftx fbf scandal
[02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:26.480]  why has nobody been arrested yet i guess i guess i would lead it you lead you into like this
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:32.240]  any in any other situation when you have a money laundering operation like this you would have at
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:38.400]  least one arrest detainment questionings and you probably have at least one person sitting in a jail
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:45.120]  with a bail set at probably 10 million maybe more dollars none of that has happened nobody's
[02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:49.200]  been arrested nobody's been detained nobody's been brought in for questioning in my theory is
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:52.800]  eventually they're going to come out they're going to say well because people are going to be
[02:34:52.800 --> 02:34:58.720]  outraged i mean he's supposed to speak at a new york times event in nine days now i mean that's a
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:04.000]  joke and they're still promoting it too they haven't even taken him off as the scheduled speaker
[02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:08.640]  so what so i think they're what they're assuming at this point is that people are going to be so
[02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:14.080]  outraged that this crook is still out there and hasn't been arrested and then they're going to
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:19.520]  come out and they're going to say well we can't do anything there's no regulation on crypto there's
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:23.520]  no regulation on digital assets so if you want us to do something you're going to have to get us to
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:28.320]  pass this law and it's going to be a huge sweeping bill nobody's going to read it and then all of a
[02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:34.960]  sudden that's when as you said earlier the state attack on bitcoin will commence so your thoughts
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:42.400]  on that in conclusion here with us today i mean you you basically laid it out i think i'll give
[02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:49.360]  you an example so there was a guy who got arrested who was a developer and all he did was build a
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:57.040]  protocol that you could take um it was similar to coin join so in the bitcoin space there's
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:36:04.240]  there's protocols like wasabi and samurai and whirlpool that allow you to basically multiple
[02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:11.600]  bitcoin inputs put them together and split them out on the other end it's called coin join and
[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:16.320]  what it is it's a way to enhance your privacy so like let's say you've got a bunch of people who
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:22.080]  all have different amounts of money and they put all their money into like they get all their change
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:27.120]  chuck it all in one pile and then on the other end pick out the same amount of money that they had
[02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:31.360]  but now it's all mixed up so you don't know whose coins are what right so it's a privacy enhancing
[02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:36.080]  thing now the government the state will tell you oh that's bad that's money laundering or whatever but
[02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:42.080]  no it's just i like to be private with respect to what my money is and that it's my right to be
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:47.040]  private now there was a guy who built a protocol called tornado cash which was purely that it was
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:53.520]  like it was a it was basically like a coin join style implementation now he didn't help anyone do
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:37:00.320]  anything he just wrote some code and he got arrested he didn't do nothing he didn't take any money
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:05.200]  didn't steal any money didn't you know tell anybody what to do didn't make any promises
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:11.040]  didn't launder anything nothing he just created a protocol he got arrested this guy
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:19.600]  went and like literally literally fraught it um and nothing so i mean when you ask me what's
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:28.400]  what's the conclusion to all of this to him i have no idea um you know god knows what excuse
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:33.760]  they're gonna make um you know whether he's also gonna hang himself like uh epstein did or whatever
[02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:42.160]  the case is is beyond me um at this point nothing surprises me but as you said the the issue is gonna
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:49.600]  be the the amount of regulation they're gonna try and create now here's the thing about regulation
[02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:55.440]  the people who write the regulation are the ones who create the loopholes for themselves
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:01.520]  right that's effectively what it is like but you know people who are stupid think that regulation
[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:06.000]  somehow helps the little guy but it's actually the opposite because the way to help the little guy
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:12.080]  is to increase competition so we actually uh mark and i discussed that in the book we say that
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:17.840]  capitalism natural capitalism doesn't need regulation and doesn't create monopolies
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:23.520]  because in a naturally a capitalistic environment what ends up happening is that all the small
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:31.920]  competitors eat away at the large player and in the absence of a state that can help build
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:37.840]  help the large player build a moat the large player is not agile enough to compete against
[02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:42.480]  a hundred small players who eat eat around at them so in all the stuff that we have today like you
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:48.560]  know the the big tech companies that you know own 25 of the stock market the the big banks etc
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:53.760]  these are all a function they're all downstream of the existence of a monopoly on violence and
[02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:58.960]  monopoly on the creation of money which is the central bank and a central federal government so
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:05.200]  they're going to want to create regulation they're going to want to have their friends
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:12.640]  basically be the only licensed institutions to enable you to buy bitcoin i think they're
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:20.560]  going to have a hard time though doing that because the the challenge is that unlike a local or a
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:28.880]  domestic industry bitcoin is available to buy globally internationally in person on the internet
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:33.200]  here there so it's going to be very difficult to kind of like try and suppress that so i think
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:37.840]  they're going to have some challenges i think they might make it harder for some people um
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:45.840]  um but this is where individuals who are the people that i want to see holding bitcoin
[02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:51.920]  not the institutions need to educate themselves instead of you know sitting around you know
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:57.200]  watching netflix or anything like that go read about bitcoin understand how bitcoin works from
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:40:01.840]  a technical perspective understand what money is read the history of money go check out saffardine's
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:08.960]  book the um the bitcoin standard like educate yourself on these things because an educated intelligent
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:16.480]  wealthy citizenship uh citizenry are very hard to suppress so that's kind of what i would say um
[02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:23.440]  be unfortunately i don't have a i don't have a direct answer on what's going to happen uh with
[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:33.280]  fdx or spf now i'm not i'm not the big crypto expert but i would i would guess that theoretically
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:40.880]  the total adaptation of bitcoin is what would be considered the ultimate success and so wouldn't
[02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:48.000]  then in this time period they would want to deter people from buying into bitcoin as a as a potential
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:54.400]  to replace the fiat currency totally so so by by doing this by freaking people out on the price
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:41:00.480]  falling what happens is that you know there's there's less quote unquote adoption the interesting
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:04.960]  thing though with bitcoin is that see people like me and the the millions of other people
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:08.560]  who are understanding bitcoin what happens during these times and this is where bitcoin
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:13.120]  if you look at the chart over the long term it creates a new price for every every couple
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:19.280]  year cycle right is that as you take bitcoin off the exchanges so when i buy some bitcoin
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:24.160]  i put it onto my cold storage wallet i lock it up and not even god can touch my bitcoin
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:28.880]  it's safe it's sound and i recommend people go and study and learn how to do that how to move your
[02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:36.080]  bitcoin off exchanges and into your own custody when you do that there is less available bitcoin
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:44.800]  on the market to be sold and what that does is it creates the flaw for the next up leg and that's
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:50.640]  literally what happens every single cycle is that a new group of people come in who have finally
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:55.280]  understood they're like holy crap now i see how much of a stupidity crypto is i see you know last
[02:41:55.280 --> 02:42:01.440]  time it was icos that blew up there was d5 there was jpegs and nfts and every single cycle something
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:08.240]  blows up right then a small portion of those people come out the other end and they're like oh now i
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:12.400]  understand why bitcoin and then they take what they have left and they move all their bitcoin off
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:16.480]  exchanges and that's what's happening if you look at the actual charts of what's happening with bitcoin
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:21.920]  is that bitcoin is coming off exchanges and going into cold storage that limits the supply
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:27.520]  and it sets the base for the next run up so what smart people do now is that they accumulate
[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:34.400]  they accumulate they accumulate they accumulate and they get the benefit on the next run up so
[02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:39.920]  yes you know in the short term it hurts but in the long term this is one of the best things to
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:45.920]  have happened all right alex sevecki thank you so much for joining us today folks check out the book
[02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:52.240]  the uncommunist manifesto i think we can all agree with that get the dirty commies out of our money
[02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:59.600]  supply and if that means having to adopt bitcoin then we'll just do that thanksgiving 2022 is here

[02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:08.000]  the paper ballots and they're done in a day why can't we do this here the answer is fraud and
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:13.040]  corruption if we don't fix the system it doesn't matter whether republican nominees Donald Trump
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:18.480]  or governor de sanctimonious they're going to deny us michigan they're going to deny us pennsylvania
[02:46:18.480 --> 02:46:25.520]  they're going to deny us arizona and i can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states
[02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:32.160]  where i believe there is an america first majority in every single one of them so we need to keep
[02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:38.000]  fighting for reform of the system tucker crossin said this better last night than anything else
[02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:43.520]  communications are the reason why we didn't well that's why info wars dot com is so damn
[02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:48.720]  important that's why they're so desperate to take you off the air alex people need to get behind
[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:55.120]  info wars this alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important we
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:47:02.880]  need more of this communications not less leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[02:47:02.880 --> 02:47:19.840]  order it's alex jones all right elon musk offering new statements on the censorship and banishment
[02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:30.800]  from alex jones or against alex jones on twitter and so as elon statements come out alex jones
[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:38.640]  responds here is alex jones response his entire response can be found exclusively at band dot video
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:45.040]  it's monday november 21st 2022 and your host alex jones
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:54.320]  and about to exclusively respond to elon musk vicious attack against me and what is clearly a
[02:47:54.320 --> 02:48:00.800]  threat yes ladies and gentlemen he quoted jesus christ saying suffered the little children to come
[02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:06.960]  under me and then it follows what it's better for one to tie a millstone around their neck
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:13.360]  and throw themselves the deepest ocean than to offend one of these so one week he's in a
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:19.520]  baphomet the devil's champion outfit and then a few weeks later he's now quoted jesus christ well
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:26.400]  beware because the devil masquerades as an angel of light now i'm not saying that elon musk is the
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:31.680]  devil he's a provocateur likes to play both sides of every issue and overall i think he's done some
[02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:36.800]  good things he's also done some very troubling things but coming up next segment i am going to
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:41.920]  really expose what's behind all this and what's really happening at twitter and the wider war
[02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:48.160]  of censorship that is taking place that really only info wars and a few people like tucker carlson
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:54.800]  have fully grasped what's actually happening this is being run by intelligence agencies and the
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:48:58.960]  justice department illegally they're having congressional hearings about it it's all come out
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:05.840]  i was the first to tell you about it decades ago but now it's been radically expanded and these
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:11.520]  direct scripts are being written and prepared and then given to pr firms that give orders to the
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:17.280]  corporate media on how to carry this out now obviously elon musk has hired more pr firms and
[02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:23.040]  probably anybody in modern history and he's hired some of the pr firms that have been actually attacking
[02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:28.960]  me on for separate clients so i hadn't blamed him for this up until this point but he's definitely
[02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:34.720]  following their exact scripts that have been put out before and it's very very dangerous now again
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:38.560]  i know what elon musk is doing i'm explaining it all coming up the next segments of police day
[02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:46.720]  weather thank you for joining us on this live monday november 21st 2022 broadcast i am your host
[02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:53.360]  alec shones i'm about to exclusively respond to some of the over-the-top statements against me
[02:49:53.360 --> 02:50:00.480]  by elon musk yesterday and today and the fact that the vast majority of even leftist controlled
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:05.360]  infested twitter has really woken up to what's happening and has saw right through what elon
[02:50:05.360 --> 02:50:11.360]  musk and the establishment is doing so we'll put these tweets on screen but he first said a few
[02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:18.000]  days ago from a bunch of requests from users will you bring back alec shones and he said no
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:24.960]  he then had a poll and brought back uh donald trump because one percent extra in the poll
[02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:29.520]  wanted trump versus those that didn't they had similar polls with 300 plus thousand votes the
[02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:35.680]  hodge ones did where i had a 10 point lead uh on the poll of hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[02:50:35.680 --> 02:50:41.360]  with people wanting me to come back but the point is is that it's hypocrisy to say he's democratized
[02:50:41.360 --> 02:50:45.920]  it and is going to have votes decide who can come back and who can't and that he's not personally
[02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:52.720]  invested and then come out and release new tweets last night saying alec shones the terrible person
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:57.360]  alec shones made money off sandy hook alec shones wouldn't hurt these children none of that's true
[02:50:57.360 --> 02:51:02.080]  but i'm not going to get into the facts of what really happened there until the end of this segment
[02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:09.120]  i want to talk about what musk is doing right now it is extremely extremely transparent musk is
[02:51:09.120 --> 02:51:14.160]  trying to take over twitter to create what he calls internet x that goes back to where the internet
[02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:18.640]  was freer and more open still doesn't mean it'll be perfect he understands that the censorship
[02:51:18.640 --> 02:51:23.760]  is just killing interaction killing debate and making a horrible experience and he just wants
[02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:28.720]  to make it successful that's a common sense and smart thing to do just from a business
[02:51:29.360 --> 02:51:35.280]  perspective which is what made america great but the adl and the southern primary law center
[02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:40.720]  the democratic party of the european union and the justice department and cia moles that congress
[02:51:40.720 --> 02:51:50.000]  had hearings on last week are inside of his company right now and are literally trying to sabotage
[02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:56.080]  it not just externally with threats of lawsuits and censorship and criminal charges from the eu
[02:51:56.080 --> 02:52:01.920]  but they're also threatening to sabotage the company and the actual systems that make it operate so
[02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:06.560]  he had an exodus out of the company it was worse than he thought there's questions of twitter is
[02:52:06.560 --> 02:52:12.800]  even going to survive he hit the panic button and basically came out and attacked me so that he can
[02:52:12.800 --> 02:52:18.160]  get the left off of his back and you know that it's it's it's fine to me that he did that
[02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:24.880]  except he went too far compared himself to jesus and the whole bring the children to me suffer the
[02:52:24.880 --> 02:52:28.880]  children to me and if you offend one of these if you're meeting one of these kids it's better for
[02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:33.440]  you to kill yourself by tying a big bow to your neck and throwing it in the ocean especially the
[02:52:33.440 --> 02:52:39.200]  translation from the king james so that's just outrageous that's absolutely outrageous that i'm
[02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:45.120]  supposedly the worst guy in the world because of media hype that massively has misrepresented what
[02:52:45.120 --> 02:52:50.320]  i really said about sandy hook that again i'll get to in a moment but here's the facts so the
[02:52:50.320 --> 02:52:57.360]  bottom line is this elon bit off more than he could chew he took over tesla he took over
[02:52:58.160 --> 02:53:02.480]  nasa he's taken over all these programs and i've given him credit he's turned him around and
[02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:06.240]  overalled in a great job i've actually said as someone being accomplished i admire him
[02:53:06.880 --> 02:53:12.080]  and i pointed out that i didn't expect to be reinstated to twitter uh and that if he could
[02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:16.720]  simply reinstate trump that'd be a great thing because trump is a candidate for the u.s presidency
[02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:21.520]  a very serious candidate who obviously had the last election stolen from him and to not let
[02:53:21.520 --> 02:53:26.160]  him be on twitter is massive election meddling so that's a good thing elon's done and elon is
[02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:30.800]  starting to clean up a bunch of the pedophilia and left his pervert pedophile stuff off the
[02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:36.960]  site so those are the positive things and that's what makes it outrageous for him to just go with
[02:53:36.960 --> 02:53:42.720]  the official line with democrat party control judges that defaulted me and said that i did
[02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:49.760]  all these things i never did and then i supposedly owe a 1.4 plus billion dollar 1.4 plus billion
[02:53:49.760 --> 02:53:58.080]  dollar ruling of the judge and the kangaroo jury and then he's just taking that at face value and
[02:53:58.080 --> 02:54:02.560]  saying i'm the worst person ever doesn't know that they took out of context what i said 10 years ago
[02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:07.680]  doesn't know i apologized before they ever sued me five years ago but doesn't accept the fact that
[02:54:07.680 --> 02:54:13.680]  they say i owe 1.4 billion and that's not enough uh the the the estate of adam lanza who killed
[02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:18.800]  the kids only paid a little over a million dollars but now for my words i'm the worst person ever and
[02:54:18.800 --> 02:54:25.280]  i desecrated graves and i and i dug up the the children and i harass families none of that's
[02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:30.560]  true but the judge let them put on whatever fake evidence they wanted and i wasn't allowed allowed
[02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:37.760]  to cross examine them while i was already found guilty by the judge they were just deciding how
[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:41.680]  guilty and now the democrats are admitting they're going to use this template of judges defaulting
[02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:46.800]  conservatives and populists and get rid of our due process so that's what's really going on here is
[02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:51.840]  as the people were being robbed by a corrupt global elite and the whole devos group crowd
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:55.680]  remember obama bragging that he killed hundreds of innocent children over and over and over and
[02:54:55.680 --> 02:55:00.480]  over again total over 200 children in drone strikes and said he was really good at killing kids
[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:05.200]  biden just killed a bunch of innocent kids and says he doesn't care madame albright who was
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:10.000]  under the clinton secretary of state bragged on national television that she tripled the
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:15.200]  sanctions on the iraqis and killed 500 000 children and said it was a good price to pay
[02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:20.480]  and when she died they actually liked jesus had died the corrupt war on free speech
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:26.480]  has been directed by these big corporations and the perfect example of this is the mba not allowing
[02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:32.000]  any criticism by their players or any criticism by the fans of communist china and the Uyghurs
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:37.680]  and all the rest of it literal death camps and a major mba owner remember came out and said he
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:42.080]  doesn't want to hear about the Uyghurs they don't even register in his mind so when you talk about
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:46.960]  people in slave camps and death camps having their organs harvested and worked to death
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:51.680]  at apple foxconn laboratories that's okay because it's just dimcoats gang and it's
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:56.720]  and he wears a turtleneck and talks effeminately but when alex jones questions of mass shooting
[02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:02.080]  when the rest of the internet does why it is the ultimate crime in history and now all populists
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:08.880]  need their free speech to need to be punished heading up this whole global move to censor
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:13.280]  is the adl they're censoring in europe they're censoring in australia they're censoring in
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:16.880]  canada they're censoring here in the united states they decided to get censored and now
[02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:22.720]  albert borla last week got an award from the ideal for fighting hate and they said that anyone
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:31.920]  anyone at any time that questions in any way any of the shots or if they're effective or anything
[02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:37.920]  is a criminal is an agent of evil he said it needs to be censored and debanked and taken off the
[02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:44.240]  internet and that's really the big story we're talking about here right now it came out months
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:49.280]  ago came out years ago but months ago and a few weeks ago even more in the intercept
[02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:55.040]  how homeland security has been secretly meeting with big tech and big banks and big corporations
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:59.600]  and a group of leftist think tanks and quote watchdog groups who surveil what we say on the
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:03.920]  internet and who decide who could speak and who can't and one of the things you get censored for
[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:09.440]  is questioning the afghan withdrawal or questioning the poison shots or questioning a stolen election
[02:57:09.440 --> 02:57:15.200]  or questioning an open border or questioning inflation this is the ruling class trying to
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:22.160]  silence us and trying to engage in such a criminal organized fraud and legitimizing it by making it
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:28.640]  all about alex jones and how evil he is and so legitimizing the entire process to then be carried
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:34.240]  out and used against you and your family or your company or your business and of course others
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:39.360]  has pointed out the other big elves in the room all the dictators and all the moolas and all the war
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:43.920]  criminals that all have their twitter accounts because well their world leaders we've got to be
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:51.040]  able to hear from them and most of you and human until about 150 years ago cultures all over the
[02:57:51.040 --> 02:57:57.920]  world believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called
[02:57:57.920 --> 02:58:04.800]  vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold
[02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:11.760]  weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3
[02:58:11.760 --> 02:58:18.640]  you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting
[02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:23.920]  enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things

[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:39.200]  can't say the word it's a jerk and if you go off over there you know the other end of it
[03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:43.040]  this is the kennedy that ended the cuban missile crisis
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:52.480]  yeah he ended it there they are
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:57.040]  and all of a sudden the whole game changes
[03:02:57.040 --> 03:03:10.480]  bam there goes and connelly's sitting in front of him uh uh breaks my heart
[03:03:10.480 --> 03:03:24.960]  what this is when america changed that lousy lbj several months later vietnam war
[03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:40.400]  a lousy piece of low life scum crap lbj yeah oh oh guns and butter yep
[03:03:41.840 --> 03:03:49.600]  he's the clown boy to shut the people up because of the war guns and butter he was the one oh by
[03:03:49.600 --> 03:03:55.600]  the way he's the one to change the immigration laws letting all the cheap labor come in here
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:04:04.880]  yeah guns and butter driving up building up welfare you don't have to work you don't have
[03:04:04.880 --> 03:04:15.520]  to do anything just don't protest the war ah this won't be reported at all tomorrow
[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:26.000]  bro you won't hear a word about it this is when america died when they killed jfk
[03:04:28.080 --> 03:04:31.440]  he wanted it he ended the cuban missile crisis here's the deal
[03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:37.360]  america had missiles in turkey aimed at
[03:04:37.360 --> 03:04:49.600]  russia so they brought him into cuba when we come back we're gonna talk more about this
[03:04:49.600 --> 03:04:51.440]  it's really important stay tuned
[03:04:57.760 --> 03:05:03.280]  the tip of the spear throughout this entire process the only thing that made any republican
[03:05:03.280 --> 03:05:08.880]  victories tonight possible the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible
[03:05:08.880 --> 03:05:14.240]  the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school
[03:05:14.240 --> 03:05:20.240]  shutdowns and and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible that made any resistance
[03:05:20.240 --> 03:05:26.560]  to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite the massive lawfare being waged
[03:05:26.560 --> 03:05:33.040]  against info wars despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against info wars the ordinary
[03:05:33.040 --> 03:05:38.720]  people the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier wealthier and wiser
[03:05:38.720 --> 03:05:45.040]  is what keeps info wars on the air and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era
[03:05:45.040 --> 03:05:50.960]  in an age of totalitarian oppression so continue to do it go to places like info wars store dot com
[03:05:50.960 --> 03:05:56.320]  go to the places like save info wars continue to keep info wars alive because in the process
[03:05:56.320 --> 03:06:06.000]  you're keeping american liberty alive
[03:06:08.960 --> 03:06:16.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host jerald solente
[03:06:19.680 --> 03:06:24.640]  yeah thanks for tuning in everybody and again do we care to support info wars
[03:06:24.640 --> 03:06:31.040]  they're robbing us of our freedom in front of our eyes and as i'm mentioning you know tomorrow

[03:08:10.080 --> 03:08:15.040]  see what happened was funding this war that was the beginning of the end of america the vietnam
[03:08:15.040 --> 03:08:27.440]  war then you had inflation skyrocket skyrocket in the 70s that was the beginning of the end
[03:08:27.440 --> 03:08:44.160]  so going back let's fast forward february 24th 2022 russia invades ukraine
[03:08:44.160 --> 03:08:58.560]  knew it was going to come here's your trends journal from the spring of 2014 article written
[03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:04.480]  by dr paul craig roberts former assistant treasurer secretary reagan how the united states over
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:10.000]  through the democratically elected government of vikti anikovic because he was going to do a
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:17.040]  money deal with the imf and the eu international mafia a monetary fund in the european union
[03:09:18.960 --> 03:09:26.880]  because ukraine has been broke since the breakup of the soviet empire
[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:35.040]  and according to european union the most corrupt country in europe so i'm not making this up
[03:09:35.040 --> 03:09:41.280]  up when they went and putin said listen i got a better deal for you i'll give you a lower
[03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:46.240]  interest rates and i'll cut the price of your gas okay we'll go with you that was the overthrow
[03:09:48.160 --> 03:09:50.880]  now i'm going back to this and pulling it back to kennedy
[03:09:53.200 --> 03:10:00.640]  in your trends journal we wrote in january of this year how the united states and nata were
[03:10:00.640 --> 03:10:08.880]  doing naval drills off the coast of saint petersburg how american bombers were flying 14 miles off
[03:10:08.880 --> 03:10:19.120]  the coast of russia how the deal was made between gorbachev and bush senior that quote nato would
[03:10:19.120 --> 03:10:27.280]  not move one inch further there were 16 nato countries when the soviet union broke up now
[03:10:27.280 --> 03:10:36.080]  there were 30 going back to kennedy putin's saying listen you can't put those missiles
[03:10:36.080 --> 03:10:43.360]  hey matthews if you're doing you can't take over this country because we don't want nato on our
[03:10:43.360 --> 03:10:53.920]  border how dare you say you don't bring want nato on your border so what i'm saying is that's where
[03:10:53.920 --> 03:11:07.200]  we are today if there was when kennedy was killed that was the end of america war after war after
[03:11:07.200 --> 03:11:16.640]  war after war after war you see kennedy was a real fighter he didn't want war he was against it like

[03:16:53.120 --> 03:16:59.120]  info wars store dot com where we promise our rose hips don't lie in arizona i think we watched the
[03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:07.120]  election be uh stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely
[03:17:07.120 --> 03:17:14.160]  absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just it's election month alex it's
[03:17:14.160 --> 03:17:20.320]  not election day and that's the problem and everything changed after covet nineteen they
[03:17:20.320 --> 03:17:27.440]  illegally changed state elections mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing
[03:17:27.440 --> 03:17:32.560]  multiple ballots to people well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country
[03:17:32.560 --> 03:17:37.680]  when we have elections that can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe the
[03:17:37.680 --> 03:17:43.760]  election was stolen in 2020 and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media
[03:17:43.760 --> 03:17:49.840]  and the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity and question the the fact
[03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:56.160]  that elections um shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election realists
[03:17:56.160 --> 03:18:02.560]  alex why is this taking so long why is this taking so long in france they can count all
[03:18:02.560 --> 03:18:07.520]  the paper ballots and they're done in a day why can't we do this here the answer is fraud
[03:18:07.520 --> 03:18:12.160]  and corruption if we don't fix the system it doesn't matter whether republican nominees
[03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:17.360]  donald trump or governor de sanctimonious they're going to deny us michigan they're going to deny
[03:18:17.360 --> 03:18:23.840]  us pennsylvania they're going to deny us arizona and i can't come to 270 electoral votes without
[03:18:23.840 --> 03:18:30.800]  any of those states where i believe there is an america first majority in every single one of them
[03:18:30.800 --> 03:18:36.880]  so we need to keep fighting for reform of the system tucker carlson said this better last night
[03:18:36.880 --> 03:18:42.640]  than anything else communications are the reason why we did well that's why info wars dot com is so

[03:21:52.160 --> 03:22:05.600]  kennedy assassination again tomorrow it'll be 59 years 59 years and i always remember the date
[03:22:05.600 --> 03:22:15.520]  because it was a week before my birthday 29th so 1992
[03:22:18.240 --> 03:22:24.640]  in 1989 i wrote the book trend tracking far better than megatrends time magazine
[03:22:25.760 --> 03:22:29.600]  i used to be on everybody hope for the today's show good morning america
[03:22:29.600 --> 03:22:39.040]  all over every every year that i at first i go on to the top trends in the new year first i go
[03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:44.640]  to the today's show that was the biggest and then the number two then i go over to abc
[03:22:47.280 --> 03:22:58.160]  and then i go over to cbs so in my book trend tracking that i wrote in 1989 i had forecast
[03:22:58.160 --> 03:23:06.640]  that someone like roce perot would be leading a new third party in the 1992 elections
[03:23:09.920 --> 03:23:14.400]  there was a guy that was really a big fan of mine and love the book his name was john j hooker
[03:23:14.400 --> 03:23:29.040]  and i get a call from hooker and he said that john connelly wanted to meet me in dallas this is two
[03:23:29.040 --> 03:23:41.840]  weeks before the election in 92 perot bush and clinton i was very much at the top of all of this
[03:23:41.840 --> 03:23:48.640]  i was on the today's show the first one and now they brought me on because i that's what i and
[03:23:48.640 --> 03:23:52.400]  well on sunday when it was a big time because i had forecast this
[03:23:55.440 --> 03:24:00.640]  and connelly want to know how i could forecast it now remember john connelly
[03:24:02.960 --> 03:24:04.960]  as this shows
[03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:12.880]  governor connelly shot
[03:24:18.480 --> 03:24:25.520]  this is the john connelly that was the democratic governor of texas and then
[03:24:26.720 --> 03:24:33.520]  as a republican he was a democrat becomes the treasury secretary under richard nixon
[03:24:33.520 --> 03:24:37.920]  and that ends up taking us off the gold standard during his reign
[03:24:39.920 --> 03:24:45.120]  so he wants to meet me and myself john j hooker
[03:24:48.080 --> 03:24:53.920]  rama fox who was larry king's girlfriend and john it was john j hooker that got
[03:24:54.480 --> 03:24:56.640]  perot on larry king when it was a big show
[03:24:56.640 --> 03:25:04.240]  and a guy i forgot his name he used to do pulse he did polling he did for card he was the top
[03:25:04.240 --> 03:25:13.920]  pollster and he died about two years ago and myself and connelly yep president dead
[03:25:15.360 --> 03:25:19.040]  and we're parked out in front of the book depository is they have to have in lunch
[03:25:21.760 --> 03:25:26.080]  and as we're having lunch by the way everybody was interrupting connelly and i kept interrupting
[03:25:26.080 --> 03:25:31.120]  them because i wanted to hear what connelly had to say and i was ashamed of myself there i am
[03:25:31.840 --> 03:25:37.520]  connelly his wife nelly and that's the book depository over our shoulder and in fact rama
[03:25:37.520 --> 03:25:45.040]  fox took that shot some polaroid and um that's the side of the building by the way it is a young
[03:25:45.040 --> 03:25:53.120]  me 1992 and connelly and i stayed in touch by the way until just before he died that was in
[03:25:53.120 --> 03:26:01.920]  october he died in february the next year february april i forget so anyway we're parked out in front
[03:26:01.920 --> 03:26:07.920]  first we're having lunch at the at the anatole hotel and king in gallus and i'm interrupting
[03:26:07.920 --> 03:26:13.920]  everybody because they're every time i'm hearing connelly speak every every sentence every word
[03:26:13.920 --> 03:26:20.400]  was a sentence every sentence a paragraph and i was ashamed of myself because i didn't like connelly
[03:26:20.400 --> 03:26:25.600]  i only knew about him from what they told me in the media and i was so embarrassed of myself hearing
[03:26:25.600 --> 03:26:33.440]  this guy talking and i said that guy you know how but he was brilliant so
[03:26:35.680 --> 03:26:39.840]  and then uh hooker says well john you're ready so the limousine's outside
[03:26:41.280 --> 03:26:46.000]  we're getting a limousine i'm sitting across from connelly and there's hooker pat cadell that was
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:55.680]  the other guy pat cadell the poster rama fox and nellie connelly connelly's wife nellie is the woman
[03:26:56.400 --> 03:27:02.240]  that throws herself over connelly when the bullet hits him in the back you could see the video
[03:27:03.200 --> 03:27:11.200]  and that saved his life and i'll tell you why because when he was flying forward his hand
[03:27:11.200 --> 03:27:16.080]  was on his chest he was holding his stetson hat he said he squished up into a jump seat
[03:27:17.600 --> 03:27:23.440]  and he said i felt a pound on my back i went flying forward and she threw herself on top of him
[03:27:25.600 --> 03:27:31.040]  and that's what saved his life he said it took about 12 minutes to get to parkland hospital
[03:27:31.040 --> 03:27:40.400]  he takes about 20 and it was a doctor on break and he happened to be a thoracic surgeon and that's
[03:27:40.400 --> 03:27:47.120]  the one that worked on connelly and what saved his life was the pressure on the hole in his lungs
[03:27:47.680 --> 03:27:51.280]  because if the air would have gone in he would have suffocated this is what he had said
[03:27:53.760 --> 03:27:59.840]  and as he said he said uh he was coming around daily plaza and he said i heard a gunshot he said
[03:27:59.840 --> 03:28:03.920]  i looked to my right he said it was a gunshot because i've been hunting since i'm a little boy
[03:28:03.920 --> 03:28:10.480]  he said i didn't see anything he said i looked to my left and it were brains on my shoulder
[03:28:11.760 --> 03:28:13.280]  he said i knew they were brains
[03:28:15.760 --> 03:28:17.440]  because my daddy was a butcher
[03:28:21.520 --> 03:28:26.320]  this is connelly's first time back first time back

[03:34:35.440 --> 03:34:46.080]  and i know he wasn't doing good because i said to john j hooker i said connelly is on his way
[03:34:46.080 --> 03:34:52.480]  out he's going to be dying and if you could see the photo of him he's kind of hunched over
[03:34:53.200 --> 03:34:59.120]  my father may rest in peace they had they had connelly on print a zone and i saw these big
[03:34:59.120 --> 03:35:07.520]  purplish reddish splotches on his hands i have a photo here of my dad and they had him on print
[03:35:07.520 --> 03:35:16.800]  his zone my father worked in the shipyards during the war you see connelly's a bit hunched over there
[03:35:17.840 --> 03:35:27.360]  and um he died of asbestos poisoning from the shipyards working in them and connelly i looked
[03:35:27.360 --> 03:35:35.600]  at connelly and reminded my father who by the way had those days just sent out he didn't have
[03:35:36.320 --> 03:35:49.040]  emails back into the set was it 1980 84 he died and i sent out a letter to everybody
[03:35:49.040 --> 03:35:55.040]  last chance to see louie i had a big party for him going away party everybody showed up
[03:35:55.040 --> 03:36:01.840]  sorry i knew connelly was going to die and he was talking like a dying man and on our way back
[03:36:02.480 --> 03:36:06.880]  and i said to him you feel any told me what happened so i'm walking back into the anatole hotel
[03:36:07.840 --> 03:36:13.840]  and everybody gets out and him and i the last two getting out of the car and we're in open the door
[03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:20.000]  where no lobby stops and he looks at me and he said i read your book trend tracking he said it's
[03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:27.920]  a fine piece of work and he said and i know your heart's in the right place but you don't have a
[03:36:27.920 --> 03:36:38.720]  clue what's going on and neither do the american people because if they did to be a revolution in
[03:36:38.720 --> 03:36:53.440]  this country that was 1992 1992
[03:36:54.880 --> 03:37:04.720]  2012 2022 look how low we've sunk look how low this country's fallen
[03:37:04.720 --> 03:37:11.920]  you know that guy thedermann that got elected over there in uh pittsburgh in pennsylvania
[03:37:13.360 --> 03:37:17.840]  and again you know to me was it's a cover the magazine of the trends journal this week
[03:37:18.560 --> 03:37:26.080]  you know says it all u.s elections democrats vs republicans bloods verse grips murderers
[03:37:26.080 --> 03:37:33.360]  and thieves uh none of them work for me and few people i respect like thomas massie over
[03:37:33.360 --> 03:37:46.320]  there in kentucky but very few anyway this guy thedermann perfectly exemplifies the decline
[03:37:47.120 --> 03:37:53.840]  of america's character he dresses like he just got out of the coal mine
[03:37:53.840 --> 03:38:05.440]  slob in before his stroke he spoke like a dumbbell anyway the new america thedermann
[03:38:06.400 --> 03:38:13.440]  yep i go out to find restaurants i like you know i like to i work very hard i like to cool out
[03:38:13.440 --> 03:38:24.400]  and be in a nice atmosphere hard to find anymore where i am but and i see guys my age dressed like slobs
[03:38:24.400 --> 03:38:29.440]  nobody gets dressed up anymore young kids do people all the women and guys that wear these
[03:38:29.440 --> 03:38:35.040]  woolen hats we should go sleigh riding we move from the bronx to yonkers yonkers was the second
[03:38:35.040 --> 03:38:42.560]  hilliest is the second hilliest city in america outside of uh san francisco so we should go sleigh
[03:38:42.560 --> 03:38:47.520]  riding all the time down the streets you know you should throw ashes by the way from the coal
[03:38:47.520 --> 03:38:52.720]  places to for salting the streets before they salted it and we throw the ashes i keep going
[03:38:52.720 --> 03:38:58.160]  anyway we got sleigh riding my mother would yell out and don't forget to put on your scapucci we
[03:38:58.160 --> 03:39:04.880]  just used to call those woolen hats that everybody wears now that it's a style and i think of the
[03:39:04.880 --> 03:39:14.960]  stetson hats and the borsalinos and the men all dressed up yep and now we've been thedermann
[03:39:17.840 --> 03:39:23.600]  and all you young guys don't forget to wear your baseball caps on backwards they look great on
[03:39:23.600 --> 03:39:30.000]  backwards they're gonna put a catchers mask on where's the style where's the grace where's the
[03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:40.160]  dignity it died with kennedy jacklyn kennedy the class class she saved grand central station
[03:39:40.160 --> 03:39:41.440]  they're gonna rip the place down
[03:39:49.040 --> 03:39:53.840]  look at then the vietnam war happened i remember was my generation or they were playing the hippie
[03:39:53.840 --> 03:39:58.480]  line you know to beat the drift and that's when the changes the dress started to change
[03:39:58.480 --> 03:40:06.320]  start to go downhill and i i was stupid i actually believed in the vietnam war that's
[03:40:06.320 --> 03:40:12.640]  how brainwashed i was as a young kid i believed it and they're doing the same exact thing with the
[03:40:12.640 --> 03:40:24.320]  ukrain war if we don't stop those russians before you know it they'll be attacking nato if we don't
[03:40:24.320 --> 03:40:31.920]  stop those vietnamese those dominos are going to keep falling and before you know it the commies
[03:40:31.920 --> 03:40:37.600]  will be control of asia and they even said the dominos would keep falling till they hit the shores
[03:40:37.600 --> 03:40:44.000]  of california i'm not making this up they're doing the same exact thing so when kennedy was
[03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:56.800]  assassinated this is from the long island press ready marx is held in jfk assassination
[03:40:59.760 --> 03:41:06.080]  you see how they've been telling us to keep hating the russians is it a marxist and was it really
[03:41:06.080 --> 03:41:17.680]  him or was it lbj and a cia oh trump was supposed to release the the documents from the kennedy
[03:41:17.680 --> 03:41:27.680]  assassination he backtracked on him he didn't do him what's the real story oh it's probably as real
[03:41:27.680 --> 03:41:36.960]  as 9 11 and again the vietnam war the golf of tonkin incident never happened wrote about it in
[03:41:36.960 --> 03:41:43.280]  my book trend tracking trends 2000 national bestseller international bestseller a lie
[03:41:45.600 --> 03:41:50.800]  but i believed it as a young person the only reason i wanted to beat the giraffe was i didn't
[03:41:50.800 --> 03:41:56.720]  want to get shot i'm watching guys walk up to water like this high with a rifle over the head and
[03:41:56.720 --> 03:41:59.360]  50 60 pounds on their back i said i'm not going to do that
[03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:08.800]  that's the only reason i went to college i wanted to open up an italian delicatessen and popchester
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:15.040]  for the broncs yeah i was born in popchester hospital no longer there and they're doing
[03:42:15.040 --> 03:42:16.320]  the same propaganda now
[03:42:19.760 --> 03:42:26.000]  in the hypocrisy of all america's wars all america's murders those dirty russians and again i'm
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:28.800]  totally opposed to russia's invasion want to make that clear
