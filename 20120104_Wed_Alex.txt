[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:43.080]  Texas Alex Jones transmission and what an important broadcast it is today as the
[00:43.080 --> 00:46.800]  world just gets crazier and crazier and the private corporate world government
[00:46.800 --> 00:52.480]  comes out in the open our job gets a little bit easier waking people up out
[00:52.480 --> 00:57.020]  of their stupor but no way it actually makes it harder because some people will
[00:57.020 --> 01:01.920]  wake up now but others will actually dig into worshipping corruption and
[01:01.920 --> 01:07.480]  slovenly servitude that much more and will defend the status quo because they
[01:07.480 --> 01:14.200]  don't want to admit those of us that warned them are right now we are going
[01:14.200 --> 01:19.320]  to have open phones today obviously but I'm specifically because I don't screen
[01:19.320 --> 01:28.080]  your calls I'm specifically wanting to hear from folks in Iowa poll watchers
[01:28.080 --> 01:34.840]  Ron Paul activists or people that support the other rhinos and of course
[01:34.840 --> 01:39.520]  people that actually voted in the caucus which is really just a glorified
[01:39.520 --> 01:43.280]  straw poll the delegates are what matters and basically Ron Paul ended up
[01:43.280 --> 01:46.960]  running away with it because he got as many delegates as the other two people
[01:46.960 --> 01:52.000]  it was a statistical dead heat but from all the polls I saw and the numbers and
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.160]  even CBS news admitting Ron Paul had in many cases ten times the crowds of
[01:56.160 --> 02:00.920]  others total rock star you know type atmosphere was the headline from CBS
[02:00.920 --> 02:09.320]  news yesterday my gut is this was fraud and the Rockwell.com as an article on
[02:09.320 --> 02:14.320]  a curtain demo has boiled it down a big reported info wars.com as well now some
[02:14.320 --> 02:17.320]  will say well then why isn't Ron Paul saying that he's saying hey third place
[02:17.320 --> 02:21.880]  is respectable he's not even saying hey is a statistical dead heat we really got
[02:21.880 --> 02:26.080]  first place many other guys won by a couple votes there's a couple votes
[02:26.080 --> 02:30.480]  separation in all three of them if you believe that why is it Paul saying hey
[02:30.480 --> 02:33.240]  it's really a statistical dead heat that's what drudge called it last night
[02:33.240 --> 02:37.480]  that's pretty much what it is and you've got him just a few votes I've got the
[02:37.480 --> 02:43.680]  actual numbers here we'll go over just a few votes apart then it's a statistical
[02:43.680 --> 02:49.640]  dead heat why did Paul say hey third is respectable he is the type of guy who's
[02:49.640 --> 02:56.600]  a good sportsman and he's he's he's gonna miss what he always does and he's kind
[02:56.600 --> 03:00.400]  of the old-timer type you know who's dying of cancer and they don't tell
[03:00.400 --> 03:03.360]  you I'm not saying Ron Paul's got cancer I'm saying you know old timers would
[03:03.360 --> 03:07.400]  have cancer and nobody knew until the day they died or old timers would have a
[03:07.400 --> 03:11.440]  heart attack and just not even call an ambulance they just sit there and have it
[03:11.440 --> 03:19.320]  not wanting to bother people basically was that old-timer type of view and
[03:19.320 --> 03:24.480]  perspective and well take an old-timer anytime over this modern eugenics new
[03:24.480 --> 03:30.840]  world order that's really an old-time tyranny but the point is Paul knows Paul
[03:30.840 --> 03:40.600]  will not engage in politics on issues he will not mitigate what he's saying to
[03:40.600 --> 03:44.000]  have more of a pro-war stance even though it would make you more popular with
[03:44.000 --> 03:51.160]  neocons Rand will do it a little bit but not much but on the issue of election
[03:51.160 --> 03:55.800]  fraud we saw this in New Hampshire four years ago I mean absolute bonafide
[03:55.800 --> 04:01.400]  red-handed Mav Harris was on the scene many other top experts have exposed
[04:01.400 --> 04:06.000]  documented fraud and past elections it was going on and Ron Paul wouldn't touch
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.760]  it and that did disillusion a lot of people and I've been warning folks this
[04:09.760 --> 04:14.800]  is coming up because you see the bumper stickers you see the polls you see the
[04:14.800 --> 04:19.120]  numbers you see how scared the system is of him and you think well he can't be
[04:19.120 --> 04:24.280]  stopped well we can't be stopped from having him run and injecting sanity and
[04:24.280 --> 04:29.760]  real issues into the debate but you better believe they're gonna engage in
[04:29.760 --> 04:34.200]  fraud to keep him from getting elected I've been trying to explain this people
[04:34.200 --> 04:38.440]  all along and you know the campaign will say oh well that's preposterous you know
[04:38.440 --> 04:44.680]  we're we're gonna win because they know that if they do admit to the fraud
[04:44.680 --> 04:48.040]  people just won't vote anyways they're gonna throw away the vote because there
[04:48.040 --> 04:51.520]  there is a way they could be right if he gets a big enough landslide which is
[04:51.520 --> 04:55.520]  starting to build it'll be very hard for them to engage in fraud

[09:12.800 --> 09:17.840]  there for you and the way this broadcast grows the way the awakening to the
[09:17.840 --> 09:22.520]  tyranny grows is by folks spreading the word about this radio show and
[09:22.520 --> 09:27.720]  obviously most of you know that but you hear the police and military and school
[09:27.720 --> 09:34.360]  teachers and bureaucrats and lawyers and doctors and farmers and oil field
[09:34.360 --> 09:40.480]  workers calling into this broadcast and they always say somebody gave me one of
[09:40.480 --> 09:44.000]  your films a copy of it we want people to get my films and make copies of them
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.240]  and not the people like Obama deception fall the republic in game or somebody
[09:48.240 --> 09:52.480]  told me about you on XM or somebody told me about you and info wars dot com
[09:52.480 --> 09:58.920]  that's how we're growing exponentially and I wouldn't be fighting the globalist
[09:58.920 --> 10:05.280]  if I didn't know historically we can beat them and the biggest thing in 2012
[10:05.280 --> 10:12.920]  we're facing is that there is this self-fulfilling prophecy there is this
[10:12.920 --> 10:18.880]  foregone conclusion fraud this lie that is sold through the controlled Christian
[10:18.880 --> 10:22.800]  churches but also through the New Agers and others and they're just popular
[10:22.800 --> 10:29.160]  culture that the world is going to end because Nostradamus said so or somebody
[10:29.160 --> 10:34.720]  twist the Bible or the Mayans say that it's a you know end of the calendar in
[10:34.720 --> 10:41.440]  2012 and the system is going to use that's that that helplessness that idea
[10:41.440 --> 10:45.440]  that people have of all things are bad it's just going to get worse you can't
[10:45.440 --> 10:49.760]  change it I mean I hear that so often from people that are awake they say
[10:49.760 --> 10:54.600]  you're absolutely right but what are you going to do you're absolutely right but
[10:54.600 --> 11:00.160]  nobody can change it or you're absolutely right but it's all in the Bible and
[11:00.160 --> 11:05.160]  that's why the system funds all of this and I get so many emails and comments
[11:05.160 --> 11:11.000]  and letters every day saying 2012 2012 and Alex we're mad at you 2012 is going
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.960]  to be the end of the world you know look at the Iran situation look at all the
[11:13.960 --> 11:17.560]  earthquakes look at all the tsunamis look at all the turmoil look at the
[11:17.560 --> 11:22.320]  depression the globalist have had it on a time frame to have their world
[11:22.320 --> 11:28.120]  government totally completed by 2015 since the 1960s and we've read the
[11:28.120 --> 11:31.920]  documents on air we've written articles we've made films we've read the quotes
[11:31.920 --> 11:36.680]  we've pointed you at that I mean I played Euclid's yesterday of the head of the
[11:36.680 --> 11:41.080]  EU von Roompi and others saying we're setting up global governance through the
[11:41.080 --> 11:45.760]  economic crisis world government is here and they openly through the World
[11:45.760 --> 11:50.760]  Council of Churches and others fund these clergy response teams and the rest
[11:50.760 --> 11:55.000]  of it most preachers in America go ask them and they'll tell you I can't talk
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.640]  about that if they're on the payroll or the denomination bosses above them are
[12:00.640 --> 12:04.000]  on the payroll and tell them this is what you will teach this is what you will
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.600]  say we told you about this three years before it was declassified and came out
[12:08.600 --> 12:13.680]  on the news back then it was 50,000 preachers that have been recruited and
[12:13.680 --> 12:18.760]  paid to spy on their flocks and tell them to submit to government that is off
[12:18.760 --> 12:28.040]  the charts creepyville and that's the issue here we're not dealing with just
[12:28.040 --> 12:32.520]  what I call a boss hog corruption we're not dealing with some bed rigging and
[12:32.520 --> 12:37.240]  people hiring their families and you know stuff like that that that's bad
[12:37.240 --> 12:43.880]  enough because it always leads to new scams new hustles new frauds every cop
[12:43.880 --> 12:49.920]  I've ever talked to whether they're a beat cop or a detective and every fed I've
[12:49.920 --> 12:55.280]  ever talked to goes of course the the government ships in the majority of the
[12:55.280 --> 13:02.480]  drugs of course the mega banks launder the money yes we know that but there are
[13:02.480 --> 13:06.240]  criminals that then come into the vacuum and deal the drugs at the ground
[13:06.240 --> 13:10.320]  level who are involved in everything else so would you rather us just let them
[13:10.320 --> 13:17.120]  run wild see the system creates the crisis and then offers the solution if
[13:17.120 --> 13:21.440]  they fully implode us into total depression which is the game plan and
[13:21.440 --> 13:27.000]  bring in even more austerity the public most of them are gonna not even really
[13:27.000 --> 13:33.800]  wake up they're gonna say okay you say you'll bring the good times back we'll
[13:33.800 --> 13:36.640]  do whatever you say put troops on the streets it's already happening in
[13:36.640 --> 13:40.600]  Illinois already happening in Louisiana already happening in other states
[13:40.600 --> 13:46.960]  they're saying put troops on the streets as if that will fix everything they know
[13:46.960 --> 13:51.600]  how to roll this stuff out you're fighting very slick systems but the
[13:51.600 --> 13:56.280]  moment you're not naive anymore the moment you decide to start studying how
[13:56.280 --> 14:03.200]  they do this and how the social engineers work you realize how ridiculous it is
[14:03.200 --> 14:06.720]  and you also understand there's really no choice people who think there's a
[14:06.720 --> 14:10.520]  choice or that you can go along with this corruption are living in a fantasy
[14:10.520 --> 14:17.160]  world you can't make a deal with something like this the globalist
[14:17.160 --> 14:22.960]  fundamentally seek to dumb down society seek to create poverty seek to create a
[14:22.960 --> 14:27.080]  post-industrial world world in their own official UN documents the State
[14:27.080 --> 14:32.880]  Department of Random 200 and Maury strong at 92 at the UN climate conference
[14:32.880 --> 14:37.960]  that is the model of the world today and UNESCO through the UN that sets the
[14:37.960 --> 14:41.460]  policy for every industrialized nation and every third world nation they
[14:41.460 --> 14:49.920]  controls agenda the globalist want bad things one thing to have some big fat
[14:49.920 --> 14:54.960]  corrupt government pigs running things who just want to be rich and powerful
[14:54.960 --> 14:59.400]  but throughout history we've had some of those that still are arrogant and want
[14:59.400 --> 15:04.440]  to have a big wealthy country because they see it as their as their cash cow
[15:04.440 --> 15:08.520]  so they want to be healthy and there's still some problems associated with that
[15:08.520 --> 15:14.240]  this is not a form of corruption like that this is a ultra off the charts
[15:14.240 --> 15:23.680]  wicked creepy and disgusting and sneaky and highly intelligent and nasty and it
[15:23.680 --> 15:28.240]  sells an idea to all these petty dumb down enforcers at every level of the
[15:28.240 --> 15:33.800]  bureaucracy that it puts in power to suppress the population it puts all
[15:33.800 --> 15:38.720]  these people in place and they think they're on the winning team when you're
[15:38.720 --> 15:43.320]  being targeted as well you're having your future taken as well your food your
[15:43.320 --> 15:48.800]  water is being tainted and the globalist are so arrogant a White House
[15:48.800 --> 15:54.720]  science are writes about it they I saw a report today on Drudge in fact guys I
[15:54.720 --> 15:59.200]  didn't see it in my stack you may have had but reprint that 500 million in tax
[15:59.200 --> 16:06.840]  money to Planned Parenthood that is the modern eugenics society in US news must
[16:06.840 --> 16:18.960]  have missed it the point is that this is not something you can bargain with this
[16:18.960 --> 16:23.480]  is not something you can join you can join it in your mind and be delusional
[16:23.480 --> 16:29.160]  but you still haven't joined it you either decide to be devoured by the
[16:29.160 --> 16:34.600]  dark force of the New World Order or you decide to gut up face the facts ask God
[16:34.600 --> 16:40.720]  into your life and take action against evil and heaven help those of you out
[16:40.720 --> 16:44.160]  there who don't realize this is a fight between good and evil and I'm not saying
[16:44.160 --> 16:49.000]  you're gonna find God in one of these churches you're gonna find the devil and
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.640]  most of them you're gonna find the spirit of the world whatever you want to call
[16:52.640 --> 16:59.760]  it the spirit of force the spirit of oppression the spirit of domination that
[16:59.760 --> 17:04.880]  wrecks civilizations and societies and as a nightmare everywhere there is
[17:04.880 --> 17:10.040]  goodness there is prosperity everywhere there is evil there is pain and
[17:10.040 --> 17:16.000]  humiliation and degradation because that is what tyrants seek after I get
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.840]  emails constantly and see comments and I've talked to Jose okay Alex they are
[17:19.840 --> 17:22.400]  putting troops on the streets they are saying they're gonna start censoring
[17:22.400 --> 17:27.880]  people but I have nothing to hide they won't come after me you are a fool you
[17:27.880 --> 17:33.560]  are the very person it's coming after all right I'm gonna stop preaching here
[17:33.560 --> 17:38.280]  because I have massive news obviously the toll-free number to join us if you're
[17:38.280 --> 17:43.640]  from Iowa and you witnessed what happened there and you want to comment on
[17:43.640 --> 17:49.520]  what happened there with Ron Paul coming in a statistical dead heat photo finish
[17:49.520 --> 17:52.840]  I mean I've got the numbers here there was just a few dozen votes between the
[17:52.840 --> 17:59.840]  three of them I mean this was photo finish where but but the instant replay
[17:59.840 --> 18:05.040]  is a hologram because there's clear evidence of fraud and then you ask the
[18:05.040 --> 18:09.800]  question why isn't Ron Paul saying that because he can't even quote George
[18:09.800 --> 18:13.360]  Herbert Walker Bush calling for a new world order the media says he's a liar
[18:13.360 --> 18:17.480]  that doesn't exist just like singing in said four years ago there is no
[18:17.480 --> 18:21.080]  trans-Texas corridor Ron Paul is insane you can find that clip they're
[18:21.080 --> 18:25.160]  billboards everywhere all over Texas open announcements trans-Texas corridor TV and
[18:25.160 --> 18:29.400]  radio ads part of the net the super highway department transportation and
[18:29.400 --> 18:35.440]  they went on CNN and said he is a liar it does not exist so obviously Ron Paul
[18:35.440 --> 18:39.960]  knows that if he comes out admits fraud that will a run-off people that are
[18:39.960 --> 18:46.920]  gonna vote in New Hampshire and be the controlled corporate media that still
[18:46.920 --> 18:51.360]  has a lot of childlike people following it will laugh at him and say see he's
[18:51.360 --> 18:55.400]  crazy he said the Sun came up this morning he said ducks quack he said
[18:55.400 --> 18:59.160]  black is black and white is white he said up is up and down is down he said
[18:59.160 --> 19:02.360]  left is left and right is right he said grass is green sky is blue he's
[19:02.360 --> 19:08.480]  insane because for those in the zombie trance it is funny oh look Ron Paul says
[19:08.480 --> 19:12.360]  Israel created a moss it's only an absolute fact admitted by the Knesset
[19:12.360 --> 19:17.600]  and in every Israeli newspaper and the Wall Street Journal so funny so see he
[19:17.600 --> 19:23.120]  knows he's just trying to desperately get to the zombies and somehow wake them
[19:23.120 --> 19:30.320]  up but you can't tell a two-year-old about calculus yeah you're lucky if the
[19:30.320 --> 19:37.720]  two-year-old can recognize the letter a or b or c and so he's dealing with with
[19:37.720 --> 19:41.440]  brain damaged children that's what the average American is literally a brain
[19:41.440 --> 19:47.320]  damaged child in a childlike state their brainwaves are at trans level we're

[24:00.840 --> 24:06.600]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones only on
[24:06.600 --> 24:18.720]  the GCN radio network all right after I take calls from Iowa and get folks take
[24:18.720 --> 24:25.280]  out there I will get into singing in had a member of the armed services like the
[24:25.280 --> 24:29.840]  army on from Afghanistan who'd been in for a decade and he was talking about
[24:29.840 --> 24:33.480]  Ron Paul and how he supported him and how most the troops did and how we don't
[24:33.480 --> 24:38.960]  need a war via Iran and Israel with the US involved and they cut the feed it is
[24:38.960 --> 24:43.880]  so obvious that is the message they're scared of getting out in all the polls
[24:43.880 --> 24:48.480]  you've seen them in all the numbers in the fact that Ron Paul gets the majority
[24:48.480 --> 24:52.240]  of donations more than all the other candidates combined including Obama not
[24:52.240 --> 24:57.040]  just Republican candidates from the military they still run that hoax of
[24:57.040 --> 25:02.120]  well you can't support Ron Paul because the troops don't like him again this is
[25:02.120 --> 25:09.200]  known deceivers talking to you like you're an idiot and I always mention
[25:09.200 --> 25:14.520]  this one big evidence of fraud is the fact that every year as long as I can
[25:14.520 --> 25:19.520]  remember right before the school year they go on every TV every radio every
[25:19.520 --> 25:24.400]  newspaper and say it's the law you've got to take all these shots to go to
[25:24.400 --> 25:29.640]  school there is no law they know there's no law it is premeditated fraud here's
[25:29.640 --> 25:36.440]  the Buenos Aires Herald GSK lab find a vaccine test that killed 14 babies
[25:36.440 --> 25:41.520]  laxosmith Klein has basically admitted to it in the government's find them but
[25:41.520 --> 25:45.640]  the point is every few months I see an article out of Poland or Russia or
[25:45.640 --> 25:52.360]  Japan or an African country Nigeria where well yes at the facility 50 people
[25:52.360 --> 25:57.400]  were given it and 35 died within hours and next door they gave it to people and
[25:57.400 --> 26:00.600]  they died and I just constantly see these articles where they're just killing
[26:00.600 --> 26:05.520]  people and then it'll be oh actually it was accidentally was live polio and
[26:05.520 --> 26:09.920]  spreading and killed thousands a no big deal CBS news I mean and then it's
[26:09.920 --> 26:15.360]  we're cooks because we don't want to take the vaccines and we've got some
[26:15.360 --> 26:20.280]  shooting of a teenager by the cops I've got a that just happened I've got to go
[26:20.280 --> 26:25.560]  over that I've got Iran saying don't bring your aircraft into the Gulf or
[26:25.560 --> 26:28.640]  else we only warn you once and the Pentagon saying we're gonna come right
[26:28.640 --> 26:33.600]  back in with the carriers as we always do I ran we know that the current
[26:33.600 --> 26:37.680]  leadership was put in power in 79 and the CIA helped him get in there this is
[26:37.680 --> 26:44.240]  on record and a lot of scholars believe Iran at the leadership level still is
[26:44.240 --> 26:48.680]  involved with the globalists they're not really on the same team but they do
[26:48.680 --> 26:52.840]  little dirty deals like Iran contra I mean that's on record our government
[26:52.840 --> 26:57.640]  shipping them all the missiles and weapons covertly so Jimmy Carter wouldn't
[26:57.640 --> 27:01.800]  get elected then as soon as Reagan got in the CIA said here's the weapons I
[27:01.800 --> 27:05.960]  mean it was all staged and I'm not saying I like Jimmy Carter I'm just these
[27:05.960 --> 27:17.040]  are facts facts are stubborn things and all of this is unfolding and now Iran's
[27:17.040 --> 27:22.480]  head of intelligence comes out a month ago and says if you attack us we're gonna
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.120]  attack New York and Tel Aviv with asymmetrical sleeper teams and we're
[27:27.120 --> 27:31.920]  gonna bring firefights to your towns I mean that is the worst thing Iran could
[27:31.920 --> 27:35.720]  say because now the globalist can stage terror attacks whenever they want and
[27:35.720 --> 27:40.640]  have Iran saying that or maybe Iran will really do it because Iran is on the
[27:40.640 --> 27:43.700]  verge of having their government overthrown 70 plus percent of their
[27:43.700 --> 27:48.400]  population hates the moolas and every analyst out there says an attack on
[27:48.400 --> 27:53.560]  Iran will actually prop up the moolas for decades more maybe that's what this is
[27:53.560 --> 27:57.040]  about Benjamin yet and yahoo gets to have a war and get reelected
[27:57.040 --> 28:01.320]  Obama gets to have an October surprise and get elected coming up in the
[28:01.320 --> 28:08.280]  election think about this how sick this is and the moolas get their
[28:08.280 --> 28:12.200]  infrastructure bombed but so what they get to stay in power because the foreign
[28:12.200 --> 28:19.280]  enemy attacked him I mean we know that went on but I'm telling you more and
[28:19.280 --> 28:25.120]  more that's got to be what's going on here or the moolas are completely in
[28:25.120 --> 28:32.600]  saying and then that adds credence to what people in Israel are saying I mean
[28:32.600 --> 28:36.000]  if you've got Iran saying if your aircraft carrier comes back through
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.680]  international waters again look out and you've got the head of their
[28:40.680 --> 28:50.880]  intelligence agency saying to the world in a press conference will attack New
[28:50.880 --> 28:55.360]  York will attack Tel Aviv will attack and I went and looked it up it was on
[28:55.360 --> 29:02.040]  press TV they officially said it I never even told people about this but two
[29:02.040 --> 29:04.320]  years ago the official letterhead came in here you know they always get
[29:04.320 --> 29:07.160]  Americans to go over there I ran for these conferences I got invited to go
[29:07.160 --> 29:11.760]  be over there are you kidding those guys probably work for the new world order
[29:11.760 --> 29:15.320]  I'd probably disappear if I went over there I think people are crazy that go
[29:15.320 --> 29:19.800]  over there and be part of those things again I'm against wars I'm not for the
[29:19.800 --> 29:23.560]  leadership of Iran all right all right I'm coming back going right to your
[29:23.560 --> 29:27.560]  calls from Iowa I haven't even given you really my take yet on what's going on
[29:27.560 --> 29:31.840]  there because it's sophisticated and Bev Harris the top expert election fraud
[29:31.840 --> 29:35.960]  is going to be joining us coming up you know she made the documentary black box
[29:35.960 --> 29:39.680]  voting was on HBO and years later it was confirmed that she was right with her
[29:39.680 --> 29:44.880]  analysis Ohio was confirmed election fraud I mean this stuff goes on went on
[29:44.880 --> 29:49.000]  with Kennedy in Chicago it goes on now and it went on in Iowa that's your
[29:49.000 --> 29:54.880]  bottom dollar we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[29:54.880 --> 30:02.760]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[30:02.760 --> 30:07.200]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[30:07.200 --> 30:11.200]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[30:11.200 --> 30:15.160]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[30:15.160 --> 30:19.160]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:19.160 --> 30:23.720]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[30:23.720 --> 30:27.720]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[30:27.720 --> 30:31.560]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[30:31.560 --> 30:35.160]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[30:35.160 --> 30:39.480]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[32:10.800 --> 32:14.320]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in
[32:14.320 --> 32:18.920]  this influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[32:18.920 --> 32:24.200]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[32:24.200 --> 32:28.720]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[32:28.720 --> 32:33.400]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[32:33.400 --> 32:37.440]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[32:37.440 --> 32:41.120]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[32:41.120 --> 32:46.200]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[32:46.200 --> 32:52.280]  a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info
[32:52.280 --> 32:57.760]  wars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet
[32:57.760 --> 33:00.240]  TV
[33:04.440 --> 33:10.160]  we now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the
[33:10.160 --> 33:15.800]  resistance you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:23.640 --> 33:29.640]  all right a lot of the experts are reporting that they've seen evidence of
[33:29.640 --> 33:38.560]  fraud lewrockwell.com has reports out on that the USA watchdog reporter was
[33:38.560 --> 33:41.920]  also on coast to coast a.m. last night saying that there's been some evidence of
[33:41.920 --> 33:46.720]  that the biggest point here is that they did count it in secret something that
[33:46.720 --> 33:51.360]  hasn't been done before and whoever comes out of Iowa is the frontrunner so
[33:51.360 --> 33:57.520]  if they're gonna steal Iowa from Ron Paul why not just crushing well because
[33:57.520 --> 34:01.600]  then it's too obvious as Bev Harris will break down next hour when you have
[34:01.600 --> 34:06.160]  finagling going on especially in a place like Iowa where it's old-fashioned and
[34:06.160 --> 34:10.200]  hard to rig it you've got to have cash change hands you've got to get people to
[34:10.200 --> 34:15.560]  change their vote that way you've got to just here and there change the numbers
[34:15.560 --> 34:19.760]  a little bit in key precincts that you've got your people in to be able to do
[34:19.760 --> 34:25.560]  that and that's why the three-winner statistical dead heat with Romney on top
[34:25.560 --> 34:30.600]  Santorum and then Paul just a couple votes beneath it and now going into
[34:30.600 --> 34:35.360]  Hampshire I've got three polls today showing Ron Paul in second place and
[34:35.360 --> 34:40.560]  growing as people learn about Romney being for abortion open borders carbon
[34:40.560 --> 34:47.200]  taxes gun control riding Obamacare yes ladies and gentlemen I mean this might
[34:47.200 --> 34:52.960]  as well just elect Obama at least we know he's a bad guy and so Ron Paul is
[34:52.960 --> 34:57.560]  saying hey nothing to shameful and being in third place he's gonna take the
[34:57.560 --> 35:04.280]  high road of a fair sport because he doesn't want to discredit upcoming
[35:04.280 --> 35:07.600]  primaries even though he knows that there's stuff going on that's why they
[35:07.600 --> 35:11.640]  got poll watchers there they're spending a massive amount of money with with paid
[35:11.640 --> 35:18.640]  staff and volunteer a coordination at all these precincts for a reason okay but
[35:18.640 --> 35:22.560]  he understands that if they can get more momentum going and get a landslide
[35:22.560 --> 35:26.200]  which he was building towards growing several points a day until they came out
[35:26.200 --> 35:30.440]  with the racism stuff in the that he wants to barbecue gay people lies and
[35:30.440 --> 35:34.400]  you know that he you know all this other crazy stuff and doesn't want a space
[35:34.400 --> 35:39.480]  program and you know the rest of it all of that came out and was only able to
[35:39.480 --> 35:44.080]  stop his rise ten years ago the establishment would destroy somebody
[35:44.080 --> 35:48.800]  they'd be down at one point with this type of attack so they're losing they're
[35:48.800 --> 35:52.640]  losing their power to sway people and with more and more Americans a
[35:52.640 --> 35:58.120]  mainstream media endorsement is like the plague it's like being endorsed by
[35:58.120 --> 36:02.840]  Jeffrey Dahmer or something you don't want it so here's a few of the headlines
[36:02.840 --> 36:06.440]  and I'm going to your calls Ron Paul may have secretly won the Iowa caucuses
[36:06.440 --> 36:10.600]  business insider breaks down the fact that he got as many of the delegates as
[36:10.600 --> 36:20.400]  the others did a centaurum and obviously Mittens Romney continuing Ron Paul's
[36:20.400 --> 36:25.320]  Iowa finish biggest fraud since Kennedy stole the West Virginia primary Kurt
[36:25.320 --> 36:29.520]  Demo has an article breaking down what's posted at Lou Rockwell calm
[36:29.520 --> 36:33.680]  following Ron Paul's suspicious third place finish in Iowa Lou Rockwell
[36:33.680 --> 36:37.120]  posted remarks by Brad Funkhalzer who we're going to try to get on the show
[36:37.120 --> 36:41.960]  well I've been following Iowa GOP vote counts for a long time they're being
[36:41.960 --> 36:46.360]  slow walked in 2012 yeah they did come in I looked it up a lot later they did
[36:46.360 --> 36:50.240]  the last few times always not a good sign and counted in secret because
[36:50.240 --> 36:53.280]  anonymous was threatening to shut it down the same quote anonymous group
[36:53.280 --> 36:58.920]  protesting Ron Paul you know who that dog's trying to go after negotiations are
[36:58.920 --> 37:03.120]  on cash is changing hands remember that Republican insider that we played the
[37:03.120 --> 37:08.400]  clip from that Fox pundit analyst you know where she's like oh the party elite
[37:08.400 --> 37:12.160]  isn't going to let it happen it's going to be taken care of you watch yeah the
[37:12.160 --> 37:17.200]  polls don't matter now apparently GOP chieftains are persuading by one means
[37:17.200 --> 37:21.040]  or another Perry and Bachman people who hold considerable sway over large
[37:21.040 --> 37:26.400]  blocks of votes to switch to Romney and Santorum leaving Ron in the dust also
[37:26.400 --> 37:32.360]  abusing suddenly lacks ID registration may have created many fake votes I saw
[37:32.360 --> 37:38.680]  that on CNN yesterday for neocons Santorum and Romney Santorum has no
[37:38.680 --> 37:42.080]  organization never drew over a hundred people that's also there was like five
[37:42.080 --> 37:45.680]  people and they said shut up Santorum or watching the football game Santorum has
[37:45.680 --> 37:50.440]  no organization never drew over a hundred people during his entire campaign of
[37:50.440 --> 37:55.640]  course he did bribe and receive the benediction of what the family leader
[37:55.640 --> 38:01.120]  who demands one million dollars where they are to distributed in part to
[38:01.120 --> 38:04.840]  cronies this is the biggest fraud since Kennedy stole West Virginia primary
[38:04.840 --> 38:08.960]  Perry had built a pretty big organization and had around 13% of the
[38:08.960 --> 38:13.840]  vote he drew far larger crowds in Santorum and ends up with just 10% did
[38:13.840 --> 38:18.160]  these votes go to Santorum Santorum didn't earn the 24% of the vote so yeah
[38:18.160 --> 38:22.680]  it's the old-fashioned Chicago model is what they're bragging about what was
[38:22.680 --> 38:26.880]  done here here's another one that we're going to your Iowa calls for people to
[38:26.880 --> 38:30.680]  break down what they saw and what they think Ron Paul comments on mysterious
[38:30.680 --> 38:35.360]  tweets sent from his campaign account that's a diversion Paul says on third
[38:35.360 --> 38:39.200]  party finish nothing to be ashamed of again he's taken the high road
[38:39.200 --> 38:45.520]  continuing Mittens Romney meaningless Iowa caucuses now Harold Romney's
[38:45.520 --> 38:52.420]  ascent to nomination that's Aaron Dyches view a Sarah Palin warns GOP don't
[38:52.420 --> 39:00.800]  ignore Ron Paul after Iowa that's a Aaron Dyches article breaking that down
[39:00.800 --> 39:06.720]  also the big takeaway from Iowa 75% of Republicans don't want Mitt Romney
[39:06.720 --> 39:12.120]  another report here Al Gore encourages voters to dismiss Ron Paul as a silly
[39:12.120 --> 39:17.520]  candidate you got Bill Clinton Al Gore Barack Obama everybody attacking Ron
[39:17.520 --> 39:23.240]  Paul what does that tell you he's good folks they're scared continuing Romney
[39:23.240 --> 39:28.760]  versus Paul experts agree GOP contest now a two-horse race new poll Ron Paul
[39:28.760 --> 39:35.840]  retain strong second place in New Hampshire and that's in Cook polls it
[39:35.840 --> 39:40.280]  just goes on and on I'll go to your calls from folks in Iowa in this first
[39:40.280 --> 39:44.680]  round of calls or so before Beth Harris joins us after you hear a caller hang up
[39:44.680 --> 39:51.200]  it's your chance if you're in Iowa and witness something to call in 800-259-9231
[39:51.200 --> 39:59.680]  800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air of course the websites are
[39:59.680 --> 40:04.960]  prisonplanet.tv prisonplanet.com and info wars.com let's go to Marcus in
[40:04.960 --> 40:10.440]  Iowa Marcus thanks for holding and calling in what's your view on this in my
[40:10.440 --> 40:17.600]  district I was in 16th everyone gave a five minute speech about why they should
[40:17.600 --> 40:23.360]  vote for his own so Ron Paul's a delicate was the last one when she got
[40:23.360 --> 40:29.120]  done speaking the crowd went insane right then I was like oh we got this
[40:29.120 --> 40:41.120]  don't have to worry so we voted and he got 23% the next person I got 16 there's
[40:41.120 --> 40:51.720]  another another caucus across the hall Ron Paul got 17% next one got 11 on one
[40:51.720 --> 41:02.720]  vote and Rick Perry had people from Texas trying to sway boats and they were
[41:02.720 --> 41:10.440]  walking around and Rick Perry patches stickers everywhere so I called him out
[41:10.440 --> 41:20.800]  on Rick Perry doing TSA and about the forced inoculations he said they were
[41:20.800 --> 41:29.400]  alive so I pulled up on my phone CNN you know daily poll.com also and I said
[41:29.400 --> 41:35.680]  well do these people lie he's like well Paul does I said what about CNN he smiled
[41:35.680 --> 41:40.560]  and left yeah now these are delusional only mentally ill people who they
[41:40.560 --> 41:44.680]  invest themselves in the candidate and will buy any lie they're told like like
[41:44.680 --> 41:50.440]  these Obama supporters I saw on YouTube without even looking over a hundred
[41:50.440 --> 41:57.440]  video responses to my Obama signs martial law bill that's got about 400,000 views
[41:57.440 --> 42:02.200]  right now because you can actually type in the headline into YouTube and see the
[42:02.200 --> 42:05.960]  the actual number then you go to our page only says like 230,000 and you can
[42:05.960 --> 42:09.560]  actually see it with that trick by just entering it in and seeing it in the search
[42:09.560 --> 42:16.120]  engine but but that's a side issue the point is because I mentioned it's got
[42:16.120 --> 42:20.480]  that many of you people say no it has 230,000 or whatever no you and you put
[42:20.480 --> 42:25.080]  its headline into the YouTube search engine and then you'll see the actual
[42:25.080 --> 42:28.920]  number or one of the latest updates just a trick for people to learn how to do
[42:28.920 --> 42:34.320]  this but but there was over a hundred video responses that I saw and it was
[42:34.320 --> 42:38.800]  mainly black folks and most of them were saying well we don't think Alex Jones is
[42:38.800 --> 42:43.280]  bad but he needs to leave Obama alone so what he went back on his word to sign
[42:43.280 --> 42:48.080]  the NDAA but he's not going to use it on citizens and secretly arrest us and
[42:48.080 --> 42:54.680]  again it's this identity thing of you know what I supporting and so my power
[42:54.680 --> 42:58.920]  is tied up in him no he's a teleprompter reading devil that works for the New
[42:58.920 --> 43:03.520]  World Order just like George W. Bush or Mittens Romney or or devil
[43:03.520 --> 43:09.440]  Gennrich or any of these people these are puppets and these people that I mean
[43:09.440 --> 43:15.400]  I've seen it you can pull up the Perry press conference from 2007 where he
[43:15.400 --> 43:20.440]  said my executive order says it's the law all girls 12 years old or older
[43:20.440 --> 43:24.360]  report for your guard is still shot it's the law and I had to go on air and say
[43:24.360 --> 43:28.360]  it's a hoax folks there's no law he just made it recommended to the health
[43:28.360 --> 43:32.560]  department the schools are lying and a year later the legislature had to pass
[43:32.560 --> 43:39.200]  a law that just said there is no law and you can find hundreds of articles just
[43:39.200 --> 43:43.360]  type in Rick Perry executive order Gardasil and I've been on radio shows
[43:43.360 --> 43:47.400]  and they've called me a liar and even when I say okay pull this up they just
[43:47.400 --> 43:51.960]  laugh at me you're right because when they run a hoax and get caught saying
[43:51.960 --> 43:55.320]  it's the law you got to take it then they don't want that brought up that
[43:55.320 --> 44:01.080]  they're a bunch of liars I mean these are hardcore scum I mean they they they
[44:01.080 --> 44:06.160]  tell people on radio and TV and print it's the law when they know it's not
[44:06.160 --> 44:11.000]  that that's a criminal that's a con artist so you're saying and that's what a
[44:11.000 --> 44:14.320]  lot of reports are saying and people on the ground that almost everybody they
[44:14.320 --> 44:19.000]  talked to and and and that's what CBS said rockstar treatment that it looked
[44:19.000 --> 44:22.760]  like he was gonna landslide win and Darren McBrain one of our reporters here
[44:22.760 --> 44:27.040]  at info works nightly news he said I think he's he might win by maybe a half
[44:27.040 --> 44:30.680]  point or something last night I said this on TV before before the results have
[44:30.680 --> 44:36.720]  come out because it's too obvious if they if they steal it big from him because
[44:36.720 --> 44:40.600]  he's gonna win with such a landslide and I said I said off air to him I said no
[44:40.600 --> 44:44.400]  I think I think it's coming third or fourth place and I'm on record telling
[44:44.400 --> 44:48.160]  the crew that last night I went on air and gave McBrain's prediction I said
[44:48.160 --> 44:52.040]  they but but but but they don't want to totally devastate him because then
[44:52.040 --> 44:56.240]  that's too obvious they stole it now see if it was a mega landslide they would
[44:56.240 --> 45:04.080]  have had to let him win but what's your gut Marcus as far as this there was a
[45:04.080 --> 45:10.800]  fraud yes sir oh I guarantee it on everyone I talked to and I know quite a
[45:10.800 --> 45:17.720]  few people are constant you know Ron polls away last night I went with two
[45:17.720 --> 45:23.840]  my family members and two my friends and then to the left of me a couple came
[45:23.840 --> 45:29.360]  and the guys wearing the Ron Paul shirt he sits down and we start talking he
[45:29.360 --> 45:34.040]  said some key things I said here Alex Jones listener aren't you he said yeah
[45:34.040 --> 45:39.360]  he said every day I said same here so then that's the same deals Ron Paul said
[45:39.360 --> 45:44.240]  four years ago half of his support then and now is this radio show and that's
[45:44.240 --> 45:47.400]  why he still comes on here even though some of his staffers most of staffers
[45:47.400 --> 45:51.760]  are listeners but there's like a 30% contingent that are kind of rhinoish and
[45:51.760 --> 45:54.520]  they you know that little kids literal kids and they just sit around
[45:54.520 --> 45:58.160]  pontificating about how it needs to be more like Mitt Romney to win and that's
[45:58.160 --> 46:03.320]  just not the case Ron Paul knows where the audience is and Ron Paul knows the
[46:03.320 --> 46:07.480]  government is criminal and the CIA deals drugs and he says it Ron Paul is just
[46:07.480 --> 46:11.880]  like me he knows the truth he's smart period I appreciate your call said to
[46:11.880 --> 46:14.320]  hear that that's what you got there Marcus let's hurry now through the other
[46:14.320 --> 46:21.080]  calls Doug in Iowa then Vincent Alarick and Jonathan and others go ahead Doug
[46:21.080 --> 46:26.600]  you're on the air okay I was the secretary in our precinct one thing we
[46:26.600 --> 46:31.640]  had to do was have a lot more forms printed at the Radisson's desk for
[46:31.640 --> 46:35.800]  crossover voters there were a lot of Democrats that came in and crossed over
[46:35.800 --> 46:39.920]  we ran out of forms because you can register at the at the counter when you
[46:39.920 --> 46:46.600]  come in now we were registering people for three different precincts there so
[46:46.600 --> 46:50.520]  they didn't all come into the same precinct that I was going into at the
[46:50.520 --> 47:01.240]  next step now our voting went Ron Paul 19 Romney 5 Santorum 5 Newt Gingrich 4
[47:01.240 --> 47:08.000]  and one right in so he got about 60% we photographed it send it in yeah my gut
[47:08.000 --> 47:13.120]  analysis from tracking it is it Ron Paul probably got 50% and that's what the
[47:13.120 --> 47:19.160]  crowd show it may even be above 50 so of course they had to then make a
[47:19.160 --> 47:23.400]  statistical dead heat and of course what's the chances of that this is pure
[47:23.400 --> 47:28.920]  baloney okay I didn't fall off a turnip truck yesterday so what are people in
[47:28.920 --> 47:34.000]  Iowa saying are they buying this then well the areas that seem to come through
[47:34.000 --> 47:39.360]  the strongest for for Santorum and Romney where the areas that Ron Paul did
[47:39.360 --> 47:47.600]  not have observers to photograph the vote oh the smaller towns is where they
[47:47.600 --> 47:54.840]  did the best and and I my son works for a military contractor here in Iowa and
[47:54.840 --> 48:00.200]  he was a Ron Paul supporter but the day before the straw hole dog Donny switched
[48:00.200 --> 48:04.800]  his vote to Michelle Bachman oh I know that that that was the diatribe on talk
[48:04.800 --> 48:09.280]  radio that she's the real conservative no ladies and gentlemen launching more
[48:09.280 --> 48:14.400]  wars while we're bankrupt is not conservative supporting the secret arrest
[48:14.400 --> 48:18.840]  of citizens disappearing into spiderholes is not conservative it's
[48:18.840 --> 48:25.560]  downright authoritarian flaming tyranny back to supporting Ron Paul all
[48:25.560 --> 48:31.040]  through Christmas and dog on day before the caucus which is the Santorum I
[48:31.040 --> 48:36.200]  think that they tell their people in these places to who they're gonna vote
[48:36.200 --> 48:41.360]  for no did you hear that Republican analyst of Fox News analyst that we
[48:41.360 --> 48:44.280]  played yesterday saying don't worry the party officials are gonna take care of
[48:44.280 --> 48:49.840]  it he will not win yeah well there's an interesting piece on the crash are you
[48:49.840 --> 48:54.840]  ready with Santorum's reverse speech where he's talking about the Iowa caucus
[48:54.840 --> 48:59.880]  people kind of in their pocket in his reverse speech well who knows if there's
[48:59.880 --> 49:04.080]  anything to that thank you so much let's talk to Vincent in Iowa you're on the
[49:04.080 --> 49:09.960]  air Vincent thanks for holding well I was a precinct captain and precinct for
[49:09.960 --> 49:16.000]  in council Bluffs Pottawatomie County Iowa and precincts one through five all
[49:16.000 --> 49:22.600]  took first place for Ron Paul many of the precincts in the more urban area of
[49:22.600 --> 49:28.320]  council Bluffs in town was took in for Ron Paul he got first something we
[49:28.320 --> 49:32.920]  noticed is that the after party when we met up with many of our other precinct
[49:32.920 --> 49:39.120]  captains in the county is that it was mostly the world areas in the county
[49:39.120 --> 49:42.840]  that Ron Paul probably got third or fourth place and there's two ways to look
[49:42.840 --> 49:47.440]  at that and I think it's both that's where it's easier to engage in fraud as
[49:47.440 --> 49:50.960]  the last caller said because there's not people there to watch it there's
[49:50.960 --> 49:54.440]  easier to have payoffs there as we know some evidence is starting to show was
[49:54.440 --> 50:01.080]  going on but more importantly I've actually been in a hot tub in hot springs
[50:01.080 --> 50:05.160]  Arkansas with with a bunch of old people and at the pool when I was up there a
[50:05.160 --> 50:10.360]  few months ago doing a story and a bunch of them didn't know who Ron Paul was so
[50:10.360 --> 50:16.880]  yeah people that only watch television they wouldn't know who Ron Paul was yes
[50:16.880 --> 50:21.120]  I would agree with that and the fact that we had we actually had boots on the
[50:21.120 --> 50:27.120]  ground here for last year or six months here in you know council Bluffs and we
[50:27.120 --> 50:30.440]  we've been able to hit all the churches we've been able to talk to people one
[50:30.440 --> 50:34.560]  on one we was canvassed all over council Bluffs we've phone called people in
[50:34.560 --> 50:39.160]  council Bluffs we did it mailing people all over in council Bluffs and you know
[50:39.160 --> 50:43.200]  many of the precincts in council Bluffs you know we want for Ron but once you
[50:43.200 --> 50:46.320]  got in the world areas where we don't have boots on the ground and we didn't
[50:46.320 --> 50:49.640]  have volunteers out there you know going door to door make a phone call
[50:49.640 --> 50:54.440]  talking to their neighbors talking to their you know fellow churchgoers I

[54:13.400 --> 54:33.720]  okay we are back taking your phone calls and we were talking to Vincent in
[54:33.720 --> 54:40.760]  Iowa look we need to get even more people to New Hampshire to ensure that
[54:40.760 --> 54:44.360]  Ron Paul wins and then people say well wait a minute there's fraud if there is
[54:44.360 --> 54:48.640]  enough of a landslide they can't engage in that and Ron Paul has been gaining
[54:48.640 --> 54:53.440]  momentum and these attacks are going to wear off they were able to stop his
[54:53.440 --> 54:58.360]  momentum and stop his growth at that point from what I've basically seen but
[54:58.360 --> 55:01.720]  now it's starting to wear off and the momentum is kicking in again and so much
[55:01.720 --> 55:06.000]  is going to happen financially in the next six months or so validating
[55:06.000 --> 55:11.120]  everything Ron Paul has said and we win by just having him in there and we've
[55:11.120 --> 55:15.560]  got to reach out to people they're calling mainly seniors and saying you
[55:15.560 --> 55:18.400]  know Ron Paul is going to get rid of your social security and he said he
[55:18.400 --> 55:21.640]  wouldn't do that he'd be created trying to create a new system for young people
[55:21.640 --> 55:24.760]  and then phase out the old which is already bankrupted they're already
[55:24.760 --> 55:29.400]  stealing your social security by devaluing the dollar that's the thing
[55:29.400 --> 55:32.960]  about these banksters look at the austerity in Europe it's already coming
[55:32.960 --> 55:37.760]  here but they do have the dependent now people whose money they took their whole
[55:37.760 --> 55:41.760]  lives now the government keeps them dependent and it's disgusting Vincent
[55:41.760 --> 55:46.160]  I've got a call to action I mean we need to get everybody to New Hampshire
[55:46.160 --> 55:50.180]  because as you said wherever you had boosts on the ground he won but in the
[55:50.180 --> 55:54.320]  areas where folks are living in La La land you were unable to but but I think
[55:54.320 --> 55:57.640]  it's more than that I think it's also fraud because there's a lot of old
[55:57.640 --> 56:02.640]  timers and people that also support Ron Paul I also want to mention that during
[56:02.640 --> 56:06.800]  the final vote count in my precinct we had precinct captains that were there
[56:06.800 --> 56:11.320]  to specifically witness the vote count so at least in my precinct and the
[56:11.320 --> 56:14.760]  precincts that we had one through five which is at the junior high the same
[56:14.760 --> 56:19.360]  location we can say there was no voter fraud there and the reason being because
[56:19.360 --> 56:23.800]  we were right there to witness it and we was also there to witness the chairman
[56:23.800 --> 56:29.880]  call into the state GOP to announce the results of that pre those precinct now
[56:29.880 --> 56:35.320]  in the rural areas where we don't have precinct captains to witness the vote
[56:35.320 --> 56:38.760]  that's you know there's a big possibility that there could be election fraud
[56:38.760 --> 56:43.360]  there because there's nobody none of our people there to witness the vote so you
[56:43.360 --> 56:47.480]  know I can say it didn't happen in my precinct but out in the rural areas it is
[56:47.480 --> 56:51.240]  possible all right well we've also had all these analysts and people bragging
[56:51.240 --> 56:54.280]  about it so they're they're very arrogant thank you so much Vincent
[56:54.280 --> 56:58.120]  Jonathan in Iowa you're on the air thanks for holding go ahead good morning
[56:58.120 --> 57:03.920]  brother I'm calling from Johnson Iowa welcome I'm in a camp dodge at the moment
[57:03.920 --> 57:10.320]  my MOS is London Bravo Infantry National Guard a small vote fraud manna
[57:10.320 --> 57:13.760]  they're disgusting for cutting off that live field for my fellow military
[57:13.760 --> 57:21.160]  brother the minute he mentioned Israel and the issues of the uses war he
[57:21.160 --> 57:26.680]  mentioned you know something that that kind of woke me up and I realized you
[57:26.680 --> 57:32.400]  know the media is this is full of crap and I small vote fraud all over this I
[57:32.400 --> 57:38.560]  think is bullshit recently Alex sir we got to let you go I appreciate your call

[58:08.800 --> 58:14.800]  things were going on the representatives only got one minute to
[58:14.800 --> 58:21.320]  vote people who had caucused before said that they had seen in years past where

[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:21.320]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:26.680]  yeah we're gonna be tracking this more coming up in the next segment with the
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:33.520]  premier election fraud expert Bev Harris and I know that she's hot on the
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.560]  trail of this Iowa situation when New Hampshire coming up as well it's
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:41.440]  clearly there fraud four years ago with Ron Paul he won New Hampshire I was here
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.040]  in Travis County at the vote processing center where the votes came in we put
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:49.040]  them in stacks with the scantrons and put them in the computer and I talked
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:53.920]  everybody at the tables Pat Buchanan was probably getting 50 60% of the vote
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.920]  maybe even more it was incredible and it was all over the city and he got a
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:03.600]  couple percentage points and so sometimes they do just completely engage
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.760]  in fraud people say oh Austin's liberal the people keep voting to hand all their
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.880]  property over and let the city rob them no I've been to the state level you can
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.160]  pull it up in the Lexis nexus archives what the 1998 election I challenged the
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.820]  Travis County election and the state came out that investigation and
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:26.080]  certified that there were serious problems and anomalies and that there
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.000]  and that the votes weren't done properly but that still they were going to
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:36.600]  certify the election and that was in a separate election from the Buchanan one
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:41.480]  96 so I've seen it people say well then why do you support elections it's not
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.920]  total fraud everywhere Austin there's no voting I can tell you bottom line where
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.680]  I live a dirty lion mafia runs things that act like
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:54.080]  limprist and liberals they're not their hardcore savages they know exactly what
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.640]  they're doing they've dominated us they've usurped us as a as a wealthy
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:01.760]  area they're sucking us dry now I was old-fashioned hand raising and that's
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.000]  why they were so worried Paul could win and in in in every ground level he was
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.840]  probably gonna get 50% I mean you've seen the numbers coming in where they
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:13.160]  couldn't cover it up he was getting 50 60% but well just what this caller said
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.600]  and that's been confirmed they didn't have the old hand raising or people can
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.400]  have numbers they said write it down give it to us and do it quick and we're
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:30.320]  gonna call a secret location now if that didn't fraud I'll eat my hat let's go
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:38.120]  back to alloric alloric finisher point sir well after they counted up the votes
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.640]  I went up there and got pictures of both precincts tried to upload it to
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:46.360]  transparent boat net the site was down yeah I was just getting too much traffic
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:50.880]  yeah well they tried that next time it'll be bigger I'm sure but I did notice
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:56.000]  while we were out there because I even though I'm not in a Iowa voter I brought
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.640]  somebody from Iowa to come in and vote I had been involved with the training that
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.800]  really wasn't enough from Ron Paul there and really we read as Ron Paul
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.200]  supporters we needed to do more we really need we really did where we were
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:15.680]  Ron Paul only got a total of 16 votes between the two precincts that I watched
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:22.760]  and Romney came in with 30 of all things all right but you're saying different
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:27.320]  procedure this year and that raises red flags thank you alloric let's go to Tim
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.640]  and Iowa Tim give us your view
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:37.480]  hello Alex yes sir this is Jim but hey thanks for taking my call sir thanks for
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.440]  licking me up and getting me turned on thank you did you say Jim my screen says
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:47.640]  Tim actually Jim J.M. okay go ahead sir go we don't have much time okay sure Paul
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:57.720]  came in 20 in my precinct Gingrich had 19 Romney had 34 and then 31% for him I
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:02.320]  didn't see any fraud at all we were allowed to watch them count everything
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.440]  like that they did that they did the caucus the same way as always as far as I
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.040]  know the republic yeah that's what I've been seeing is that it varied this time
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:15.760]  from place to place is that normal well well normally Republicans just have you
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:19.560]  fill out the ballot or do show hands but they don't they don't debate it like
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.800]  the Democrats do but can I give you my take yeah for him in Iowa we had this
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.920]  gay marriage that was forced on by the Supreme Court and a lot of people are
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.800]  very angry about that if you look at the map of counties that voted against the
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:37.520]  gay marriage judges they pretty much fit right with the countess of Santorum one
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:42.000]  so he brought this up the hot bus but an issue that didn't get any coverage by
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.760]  the media he went a self campaign and he brought out a lot of that church going
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.760]  folks to vote for him that was really a protest vote against the gay marriage
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.800]  yeah and it just becomes a political football interesting point alright so
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.320]  you don't think there was fraud interesting I hope that's the case
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:04.760]  they're right back hi folks this is Alex Jones I'm looking for people that have

[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:03.960]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.680]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.240]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:15.000]  silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.880]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:22.600]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.800]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of

[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:10.320]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:27.400]  okay we're gonna continue with the callers from Iowa eye witnesses what you
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:31.880]  saw most the callers are saying they believe that there was some type of
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.560]  fraud they say that the majority of people that they witnessed were voting
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:43.920]  for Ron Paul in the caucuses we're also have callers saying that normally they
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:47.800]  raise their hands and it's publicly tally tally but in some of the precincts
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.360]  they were they were writing it down and giving it to them as ballots we know
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:56.200]  they moved it to a secret location we're gonna continue with your calls
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:02.080]  throughout this hour with Bev Harris she's author of the book black box voting
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:07.480]  and expose an electronic voting and she of course helped you know put together
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:13.160]  the hit film on HBO the documentary about black box voting and we'll be
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:17.920]  talking about her website and more today but you know she's the lady that
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:22.680]  exposed fraud in multiple states like Iowa she's helped get people to testify
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:27.280]  before legislatures whistleblowers from inside she has proven election fraud
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:32.520]  this is going on and it's so cartoonish how bad it is but Iowa has the good
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:38.000]  old-fashioned way of hands raised and so it's harder to do but we do have a
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:48.080]  caucus by caucus breakdown of what ended up happening with this and with Romney
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:55.920]  and Centorum there was only a difference of what eight votes supposedly if you
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:03.320]  believe that and a few thousand with Ron Paul very very interesting to see this
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:08.640]  happening and so you know the fact is we know this stuff exists now Ron Paul is
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.640]  saying hey you know third place almost you know a dead heat with the others
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:18.640]  that's that's not shabby and it's not but undoubtedly bad let's go back in
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:23.680]  time because you were you know you covered New Hampshire yeah I mean you've
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:26.920]  gone all over the country you've caught people you know dumping stuff in the
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:31.600]  dumpsters cover-ups you name it I mean going back four years ago I remember
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.000]  clear evidence of fraud in New Hampshire with Ron Paul but but overall
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.160]  looking at this out of the gates I know it's just a few hours after the results
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.040]  came out 12 hours or so what do you see unfolding what do you see happening
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:51.320]  well first we have to be clear what's at stake in Iowa and in New Hampshire it's
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:56.960]  not about who wins it's about expectations if you do better than
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.960]  expectations the story is that you're you know you're coming on strong as a
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:07.600]  candidate the money flows in if you do worse than the expectations then the
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:12.600]  story becomes well you're not doing so well and and you're probably you know
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:17.800]  gonna gonna fade away what I expect is going to be what I'm worried about in
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.920]  New Hampshire is that it is New Hampshire not Iowa where they're going to
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:28.120]  really do the work on this thing they're going to basically and this is just my
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:33.800]  opinion my constitutionally protected opinion but what I think they're going
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:41.880]  to do is try to award want Romney such a large massive win that they can then
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:46.400]  make the story he's inevitable why even bother to have more caucuses they're
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:50.640]  expensive or more elections or more primaries they're expensive let's just
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.720]  get it over with let's get the other candidates out of the race it's going to
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:58.440]  be Romney Romney Romney with Ron Paul in New Hampshire what I expect to see is
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:04.240]  them to hammer him down a good bit so that the story can then be well you know
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.600]  he didn't do as well as expected I guess you know he's he's fading out and
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.720]  New Hampshire's easier win New Hampshire's easier because that's
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:16.760]  electronic machines in most of the districts in Iowa it's very very hard
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:20.600]  but there is a spot in Iowa where they could engage in manipulation though but
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.240]  let's continue with New Hampshire and then go back to what you see in Iowa okay
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:29.720]  okay yeah yeah New Hampshire is really really really a concern for me right now
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:35.200]  even more so than in 2008 when we yes we caught him in the act of tampering with
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:42.040]  the recount in 2008 New Hampshire is run on electronic counting machines now
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:48.160]  interesting because there's about 330 jurisdictions and about a third of those
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:52.960]  actually do publicly hand count their ballots but the other two-thirds count
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.480]  on these electronic default voting machines which are programmed by a
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.960]  couple of guys one of whom is a convicted narcotics trafficker they're
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:05.200]  just a couple of private guys you know they're not even working for the
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.240]  government or anything they're just a couple guys that run the work with an
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:13.800]  organization called LHS Associates which is tiny and it's out of Massachusetts so
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.440]  they've got all voting machines basically controlled by these two guys they can
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:22.720]  have their way with those we what we saw in 2008 that was fairly interesting is
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.400]  there was a discrepancy between the hand count locations and the machine count
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.640]  locations so that's one thing to watch for but the other thing that I'm very
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:34.200]  concerned about New Hampshire right now is they have disabled the ballot
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:39.720]  stuffing safeguard and let me explain that for a minute this the ballot
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:43.760]  stuffing safeguard is simply this you count how many people showed up to vote
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:49.360]  and you count how many votes there were if you know in Swansea New Hampshire in
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:55.800]  2008 we know from the reports that were submitted 1500 ballots for counted
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:03.800]  1500 ballots but only 1000 people showed up to vote and they can pull out
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:08.800]  other people's votes and add their own or they can just add more on top and we
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:12.760]  know they've been caught over and over again doing this well in New Hampshire
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:18.520]  this time some of the town clerks are reporting that the Secretary of State
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:24.800]  has told them that it is optional to report how many people voted now if it's
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.960]  optional now if the law I understand this the law is very clear the law
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:36.560]  requires that every single town clerk submit immediately to the Secretary of
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:41.440]  State the number of people who counted along with their vote tally problem is
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:47.240]  that the problem there is that this time they're just saying they're going to
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:55.160]  start the law so wow I mean it is so in your face so so so right there is where
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.280]  they can do this because I remember four years ago there was incredible evidence
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:02.840]  fraud against Ron Paul in New Hampshire so that's where they're planning to
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:08.720]  really give him a devastating whack so that they can create the perception and
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:13.800]  he's out of the race they wouldn't do that in Iowa because it's a little bit
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:18.240]  harder and it's harder for them to finagle things have you seen this video
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:24.120]  this Fox News pundit on a local Iowa radio a few nights ago saying don't
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.440]  worry I've talked to the party chiefs they're not going to let Paul win the
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.440]  fixes in I mean that's how arrogant they've gotten and they may have tweaked
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.560]  it I mean you know it was so darn close he might have won you know but the thing
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:41.040]  is in terms of these the Iowa caucus and the Hampshire primary they're not
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.600]  actually about winning they're about managing expectations so that they can
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:52.440]  create a foregone conclusion okay so yeah so what happens in Iowa I think is
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:57.600]  if extant expectations were managed they might have tamped him down a tad so
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:03.240]  he didn't win they may have tamped down Rick Santorum by the eight votes but he
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:08.040]  lost by because they need to have Romney the winner you can tell from the CNN
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:12.640]  coverage and so forth that he the anointed that he they want Romney to
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:16.200]  be foregone conclusion and they're going to try to pull Romney out in the
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:21.240]  Hampshire with a 50% of votes you know or 55 a huge margin and that will be the
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:26.440]  story and then they'll you'll be inevitable you see but Ron Paul on the
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:30.160]  other hand the danger there is that they'll tamp him down exactly as he said
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.720]  Alex and they'll tamp him down and then they'll you over and over and over and
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.160]  over you're going to hear this story well he just didn't do as well as he
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:43.920]  expected well you know he's just really not a status candidate and how does the
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:48.760]  poll campaign and how do Americans period that believe in real you know
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:54.160]  election systems how do how do you respond to something like that I mean
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:58.920]  what do activists do to expose that because you are the person with others
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:02.600]  who have proven it's come out in court and come out the Associated Press years
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:08.400]  later yes Ohio was a fraud yes this state was a fraud yes this went on I
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:14.480]  mean this does go on they've been caught doing it over and over again how do you
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.000]  stop them I mean what would you do if you were the Ron Paul campaign if you
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.760]  were Ron Paul I mean you were undisputedly the preeminent expert on
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:26.840]  election fraud what would bev Harris do I would start right now talking about
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.160]  what's real and what's not what's real is New Hampshire doesn't have very many
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:34.960]  delegates they're the first primary but they are not relevant because they don't
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.960]  have a process that has integrity although of course you know the candidates
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:43.800]  can't go there but at least you know forget even about whether it's tampered
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:49.840]  with or not New Hampshire is not relevant this this huge focus on whatever
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:53.880]  happened in New Hampshire is going to tell the story for the future has got
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:18:00.120]  to be really debunked because if that and then it really won't matter so much
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.440]  what happens in New Hampshire they can tamper to their hearts content they've
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:09.760]  only got a few delegates what they're what the effort is though is to try to
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:14.440]  short-circuit the whole primary system so the other states never do really get
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.800]  to vote so what I expect to see is they're going to annoy Romney and then
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:21.680]  they're going to keep start talking about how expensive it is to have all
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.960]  these primaries is going to be huge pressure on the candidates to bow out
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:29.240]  and it's going to become more and more inevitable and and then the whole per
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:33.280]  circus the whole thing just the circus and the whole thing you short-circuit it
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:39.960]  or it's a circus both well it's just frustrating to watch this this fraud go
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:44.320]  on I mean you talk about election fraud 15 years ago I would we get laughed at
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:47.200]  the Collier Brothers would do it and get laughed at and they caught people
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:52.640]  red-handed all over the country now most people I've seen in national polls know
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:58.760]  that there's fraud going on manipulation bamboozling dirty tricks
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:03.200]  whatever you want to call it but there's this sense of helplessness right and
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.880]  let me address that you know what I've done over the last few years is I
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:12.280]  really boiled it down to just four things that we need to demand to be able
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:16.160]  to see and authenticate just four things and we can get control of this
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.400]  process again and we don't have to do them all in one fell swoop with the
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:24.720]  magic wand we can do them piecemeal but we need to start you know start getting
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.160]  one thing after the next the fourth thing we need to be able to see and
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.080]  authenticate now this difference from state to state what you can see and
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.360]  authenticate I say what stay there Bev we got to go to break short segment
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.400]  coming up we'll do that segment on the four things we need to really certify
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:44.560]  the vote you know that key to our republic our representative democracy
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:49.640]  and then we'll go to callers in Iowa to tell you their stories and a bev can
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:53.080]  break it down and other callers the phones are wide open they're full but

[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:50.560]  get that out to everybody okay Bev we're back here go over the four things
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:55.880]  that we can demand that's common sense and it really takes the high ground away
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:59.880]  from the fraudsters and in some places we're actually getting this so so from
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:05.000]  your deep research what can we do right we need to the public any person needs
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.440]  to be able to see and authenticate number one who can vote which is just the
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.360]  voter list who did vote which is whoever showed up and cast their vote the
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:20.720]  chain of custody and the vote count now you can verify those four things they
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:24.240]  really you're gonna catch them most of the time as they try to steal an
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:27.720]  election what they've done though is they've taken some of these things out
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:31.760]  of the public domain it depends where you are you know some places you can see
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:36.480]  one but not another if they can control any one of those four things they can
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.920]  control the whole election so if they can knock people off the list or add
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:45.560]  people to the voter list of who can vote they can't or if who did vote if for
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:50.200]  example they stuff some more ballots in and say people voted when they never did
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:54.880]  vote they can take the election if they chain if they alter the chain of custody
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:58.960]  and which is the thing that we're going to get to in Iowa here that's what I'm
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:02.200]  concerned about with some of the locations there where everything was out
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:07.080]  in the open at the caucus but between the time it left the caucus and got to the
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:12.080]  Republican Party at the state level that might have changed and then if they
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:16.520]  just add a little bit here or subtract a little there they can win and that's
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:20.480]  why you've got a statistical dead heat between Romney, Shantor, and Paul. Right.
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:25.320]  And it only needs to be done in a couple of places so that's the chain of custody
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:29.240]  issue with the last one being the count. Now most of the places in Iowa they did
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:33.320]  count in public last night and so the count was actually pretty good. The
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:39.400]  problem was a chain of custody in Iowa. Well we've had a lot of callers want to
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:42.800]  go to them in the next segment get your take on it Bev who have said that
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.880]  normally at their caucus everybody does raise the hand it's tally there this
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:51.360]  time they said at some of them that they were handing them in into a ballot box.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:57.000]  Now if they hand them into a ballot box then there's just a couple quick other
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.560]  steps and this is chain of custody again. We have to be able to see that the
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:04.920]  ballot box is empty when they start handing them in and that they only put
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:08.400]  one ballot each in the box and that you can stand there and watch as people are
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:13.200]  doing this but if you do that and the ballot box never leaves the public view
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:16.760]  then at the end of the day they can pull them out count them in public and as
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:20.840]  long as you can see what they're counting and from these of course it's
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:24.760]  different each place some of the caucus locations you could see the Ron Paul
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:29.120]  guy was standing right there behind the counting table and could see what they
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:33.720]  were counting and authenticate that. Ideally they should do what this is one
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:37.520]  of the things they did right in New Hampshire in the recan in 2008 that any
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:42.080]  person should be able to see it. In New Hampshire at the end at the one side of
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:45.720]  this long table you had the counters and the party of theorists and standing on
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:48.960]  the other side you had the public and they could sit there and videotape the
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:52.560]  ballots with a close-up lens if they wanted. What about good old-fashioned
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:56.000]  because that's what Lou Rockwell and others have got some reports of good
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.320]  old-fashioned political promises cash for people to vote for somebody else other
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:07.160]  than the candidate they were going to vote for. Oh yeah yeah you know if that's
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:12.960]  you know buying votes obviously and then you're just that's difficult to do on a
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:18.000]  whole scale whole sales scale though when you think about it you've only
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.240]  separated by eight votes or it's just a small number of votes as Iowa is that
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.760]  can become very very relevant but if you're talking in the scale of a
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.920]  statewide election in New Hampshire which had two hundred thousand ballots
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:34.320]  cast last time I would expect that was from both Democrats and Republicans
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:37.200]  might be a little less this time but still you know you'd have to buy an
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:40.600]  awful lot of people off and nobody would have to talk so the bigger problem is
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:45.400]  inside access. All right let's come back take calls and look forward into this
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:51.000]  election with Bev Harris a black box voting stay with us. We're on the march

[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.320]  we have a government that's been caught shipping guns into Mexico Honduras but
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:40.280]  also into Illinois Indiana Florida to drug gangs to kill other drug gangs so
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:45.480]  the money could be laundered in major US banks and the ATF's been caught along
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:50.760]  with the FBI I mean this is this is Chicago Tribune El Paso times six months
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:54.920]  after we broke it and then few months after that it's in the New York Times
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:35:00.760]  three weeks ago New York Times but it's like oh well they launder the money and
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:06.400]  run the drugs to keep tabs on it yeah 500 billion and they've got all these
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:11.520]  whitewash movies like American gangster where one guy from the street runs all
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:15.520]  the heroin in America and he was the one that had the army shipping the drugs in
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:19.960]  in the 60s and 70s it was a congressional reports it was the joint
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:28.040]  chiefs of staff it was banks it was an Italian mafia or some black guy again the
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:32.120]  fables are everywhere to sell us these lies but the good news is people know
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:35.880]  about Fast and Furious they know about Gulf of Tonkin to get us into Vietnam
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:41.200]  they know about Northwood's and they know about CIA aircraft crashing with
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:44.880]  drugs and they know about election fraud in Florida I don't like oh you know
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:51.960]  people like Al Gore but facts are facts the establishment said time for a
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:58.020]  change the point is this stuff goes on and now that people aren't so naive we
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:01.640]  can have a debate about this and have a chance of turning it around do you agree
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:05.820]  with that statement that analysis that that now people are more open to this so
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:10.920]  we can try to get some headway a Bev oh yes there was a poll recently that said
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:17.320]  actually 70% of Americans just think elections are theater yeah
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:21.720]  accurate you know I don't know where the other 30% are that gullible but are
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:28.760]  right yeah that's about where it is that it's theater it's it's a pageant but it's
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:35.480]  not particularly real yeah I saw one of 90 a few years ago right before Obama
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:40.800]  got elected yeah people really thought it was a Republican Democrat issue so
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:45.600]  they were like oh you know it 90% or so you know had questions about the
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:49.080]  integrity but that kind of put people to sleep for a while but they're waking
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:53.640]  back up oh yeah you know there's no question and that that plays into the
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:57.560]  hands of the people who really do want to control things is to be able to split
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:01.240]  people and get the oh it was the Republicans who did it to one constituency
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:05.400]  and other constituency they say oh the Democrats are doing now actually you
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:10.280]  know both of them do that but this goes this does go higher and it's it doesn't
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:13.920]  actually matter who gets in and becomes president they're they're out of love
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:17.880]  they're gonna have to play the game well they're all financed by the same
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:23.560]  offshore interest and again it's that ending childlike gullibility and growing
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:30.040]  up there is no Santa Claus and we've got real criminals in charge yeah I mean
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:35.560]  really this started a long time ago this started back in like 1950 when they
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.520]  started you know saying how are we going to get the United States completely
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:43.360]  dominant in global business and one of the things and this is actually in
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:47.920]  freedom of information documents that the they built this national security
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:51.120]  infrastructure but one of it what the things they were doing was they said
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:55.160]  okay how do we do this how do we get the global you know business community
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.200]  from the United States to be dominant worldwide well one thing that's very
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:05.080]  handy for us it's real but it's just handy is we can build a huge anti-communist
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:10.680]  thing and we can end exact same arguments and tactics that we use to
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:16.160]  supposedly fight communism can be used to prop up the regimes that we want to
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:20.600]  spread our global business anywhere we want we can use exactly that well then
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:23.840]  communism fell and they had to start using some other rationales and also
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:31.280]  being more obvious but basically as I've been able to see from the documents it
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.160]  goes to the national security infrastructure and and to the Wall
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.120]  Street and the global elites of the global financial elite yeah they've
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:42.880]  taken this country over and then they they say their world imperial agenda
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:47.360]  which is enslaving us and we're paying for it they they dress it up with this
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:52.240]  rotunda of American flags and then we're supposed to just fall down and
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:57.200]  worship it and the new communist threat is al-qaeda and just like we now learn
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.120]  the communist threat was funded by the big mega banks al-qaeda is funded and
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:05.360]  they put al-qaeda in charge of Libya and you bring this up to a good old boy and
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:09.240]  they just say I don't care I'm scared al-qaeda I'll get my rights up yeah I
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:15.760]  mean it's you know I I realized a while back a minute some years back also and
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:19.440]  you know I was having things happen to me that were pretty inappropriate in
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:23.360]  terms of investigations and so forth it's like wow what if I really stepped in
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:28.640]  here and it is true that we can deal with this to some extent at a local level
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:32.560]  and start grabbing things back and grabbing our rights back using you know
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:36.760]  home rule and some of these other things but I realized you know we have an
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:40.060]  obligation to understand the bigger picture because if we don't we're
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:44.200]  never gonna understand why they keep saying no to us no that's right we're
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:48.400]  run by a bunch of ruthless robber barons who think they control the entire
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:51.600]  universe before you leave us on to talk about what's coming up you know the
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:55.280]  breaking stuff you've got in your new book and you know hot spots we should
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:58.200]  watch around the country some of these voting machine companies that really
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:02.200]  out of control but I want to go to some calls right now from mainly folks in
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:05.680]  Iowa and other areas Anita in Iowa thanks for holding her on the air with
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:12.080]  Beth Harris a black box voting org what did you see in Iowa hi Alex God bless
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:18.840]  you my husband and I live in Tipton and Iowa Cedar County we went to the
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:25.080]  caucus last night for our Ward 1 there was 28 people present we had to write
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:30.960]  our boat on a piece of paper but we got to see the tally sheet and we took
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:39.200]  pictures of it and Obama had 50 birds Obama Ron Paul had 50 percent of the
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:45.560]  vote in our ward there are 28 people there was 14 for Obama pick two for
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:41:01.600]  Bachman three for Gingrich you keep saying Obama you mean Mitt Romney but overall
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:06.560]  in our ward everything was handled other than we had to write it on piece of
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:12.520]  paper I also got up and made a speech about Ron Paul before the voting took
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:16.840]  place I've been very involved my husband I both have been very involved in
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:22.840]  supporting Ron Paul we also got elected as delegates to the Cali convention and
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.920]  we're very excited about that that's gonna take place March 10th well good
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:31.960]  job good job and it sounds like your area did it the right way
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:36.800]  Sean and I will you're on the air with Bev Harris go ahead yeah yeah how you
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:42.440]  doing good I'm a I'm a police officer out here actually also oh great and I had
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:48.400]  left work to go caucus for the first time ever when I got there I was a little
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:54.160]  surprised that I didn't need to have any identification of any kind right they
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:42:00.640]  just asked me my name and they actually got my name wrong on the sheet and I
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:04.120]  had to argue with the guy telling him no that's not me you filled in the wrong
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:07.760]  box yeah that's that's the intel we're getting and trying to track back that in
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:13.200]  many areas they were just letting anybody vote and weren't and that normally
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:17.320]  that's not the case but you're saying as a witness you saw this yes they
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:21.800]  actually did it to me he filled in the wrong bubble and I told him I'm sorry
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:26.680]  you have that wrong that's not me he said no that's correct see and I had to
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.840]  actually physically count down the list to show him that it was wrong had he
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:35.080]  just asked for an identification of some kind you know that could have been
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:39.400]  alleviated they allow people from out of state to be there so what who's to say
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:42.720]  that they don't go in the phone book and find someone in that district and just
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:50.120]  walk in my goodness well well what does your gut tell you about them running off
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:55.120]  this year and saying we're gonna count it in secret because anonymous is gonna
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:58.520]  hack it and then and then the very individual that uploaded the original
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:04.040]  anonymous video runs out to protest Ron Paul I mean boy we can tell why anonymous
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:10.920]  was there can't we like in my job anything that's done in secret you know
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:15.200]  there you're probably not supposed to be doing it so right something that's not
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:20.440]  on the up and up so right you know and as a person who really honestly I'm
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:26.640]  gonna be stuck in the middle what if it if it all goes down so I went out and I
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:31.520]  had my voice known and when I saw that Rick Santorum was taking the lead I was
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:37.440]  kind of shocked by it but did you talk to anybody at your district I mean who
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:43.160]  were they going for there were a lot of Ron Paul people there you know they had
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:50.960]  their stickers on and everything I I personally voted for Ron Paul but you
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:57.680]  know let's see the turnout turned out to be about in the 20s for Santorum and
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:04.280]  Romney and Ron Paul got about 16 votes so he was number three and that was in
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:10.440]  your and again what district were you in I'm in Scott County all right anything
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:17.120]  else you'd like to add you know I would just say that well actually I was
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:23.000]  watching Fox News and they had something about the tally was at about 98% and
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:28.920]  they were going on about a slow truck from from Iowa State from Aims that
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:32.640]  hadn't been counted yet and they know and knew where it was and this is taking
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:38.000]  long yeah if you go through Fox News last night they were kind of joking
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  about hey this where's this truck at why are they taking no no we actually have
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.720]  Carl Rose yeah in fact one of our reporters are trying to show it to me
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:50.200]  during the break but I ran out of time two breaks ago talking about missing
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:56.360]  trucks missing and you know missing precincts I appreciate your call I'm
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:45:00.760]  glad you raised that Bev A what do you make of what he witnessed where they
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:04.360]  weren't getting any identification or even confirming the names right and then
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:09.040]  B yes it is true Fox News you'd report that some of the precincts never showed
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:13.160]  up right well you know that's where we get back to the four things who can
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:17.120]  vote who did vote exactly if you can control those two things you can control
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:20.600]  it but you can bring some people in for somewhere else or they're not who they
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:27.440]  say they are dead people voting in Chicago exactly these missing trucks
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:31.200]  yeah I'm looking right now at this report and get this listen to this
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:36.920]  carefully it said in Clinton County Rowe said a missing boat tally prompted
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:41.320]  observers from the Romney and Centaurim camps to huddle together and agree on
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:48.360]  what the report total should have been and that's what they used they didn't
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:53.720]  even use the real vote oh so now Centaurim tells us wow yeah I've got
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:57.040]  reporters trying to flag me all day about this I'm gonna have to obviously
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:00.720]  collate it for the next hour or tonight's nightly news but I mean it's
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:06.040]  always like this it takes time for the for the dust to settle but exactly and
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:10.360]  and this that's where you get this chain of custody so you know yeah voting
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:14.040]  machines are crucial because they concealed accounting but these other three
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:19.600]  areas chain of custody who can vote who did vote anyone of the four can steal
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:23.440]  you an election that's why we have to be able to see what's going on every step
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:27.700]  of the way wow yeah so you're getting the reports in that they just agreed what
[01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:31.720]  it would be I mean I'm just telling you my gut and my gut unfortunately is
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:36.080]  never really wrong I can I can misinterpret what my guts telling
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:41.160]  me but it's always accurate I mean I just smell stinking rat under the floor
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:45.720]  boards something has rotten in the state of Denmark here on on every level and
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:49.200]  you've got you know these these Republican operatives on on TV and
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:53.680]  radio saying don't worry the party officials know how to fix it they're so
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:57.960]  arrogant you've got this long history of it going on you have missing trucks and
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:02.640]  all of this it does not sound you've got them counting it in secret Bev I mean
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:06.560]  you add all this together and here's my question see this is all a magic show what
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:10.240]  does a truck have to do with it actually because they're supposed to count at the
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:15.200]  caucus location and report it publicly at the caucus location and then call it
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:20.640]  in to the headquarters or fax it in why is there even a truck yeah that that
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:23.760]  would mean they were taking them to the place to be counted oh it doesn't sound
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:27.440]  good oh no you don't want to be driving things around in the truck with cars
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:31.680]  period or trucks because that's when they're also saying some precincts just
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:35.760]  never reported anything that's on Fox News oh my goodness you know it's it's
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:41.000]  crazy so that's where you get into chain of custody and and that's what I had
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.680]  written before we even started into this I think this article fill up its
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:49.400]  lead story that in Iowa the narrowing of the funnel I'm the right end of the
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:52.560]  funnel being everyone can see it the narrowing of the funnel happens with
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:56.800]  chain of custody in the Iowa caucus and that's when that's where you always get
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:01.160]  at in Ron and everywhere it's that executive controller fraud level it's
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:06.720]  the person right it's where only a few people can see it when everyone can see
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:10.880]  it there you know and what people are fooled time and time again they'll go I
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:14.320]  was there and it was really open and it looked pretty good and what they don't
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:17.920]  it's like the amazing Randy don't look there look here you know yes and they
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:21.440]  want you to feel really good because it's all out in the open but if at any
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:26.360]  point in the election process that narrows and all of a sudden you can't see
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:31.040]  what they're doing just exactly as your caller said when something has done in
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:36.320]  secret it's not going to be good well let's talk to Clay in Iowa and we'll go
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:39.760]  to Julio and Chris both in Illinois Clay you're on the air with Bev Harris so
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:49.200]  what'd you see hi Bev hi Alex hey buddy hey yeah in my precinct not only did Ron
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:57.680]  Paul get the most of votes Ward 2 precinct EM27 in Des Moines, Iowa but
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:06.080]  actually Romney had gotten the least amount of those and what I thought was
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:12.440]  funny is they there and then the school that we took these caucuses that there
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.480]  was multiple precincts in the school in different places like one would be in the
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:23.480]  Jamel library and the other precincts had come over to talk like chair to chair
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:29.560]  on these precincts and compare notes and Ron Paul had one in the other ones too
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:34.960]  and Romney was down right there at the bottom I mean he wasn't even second or
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:40.760]  third yeah well who believes that Republicans are want somebody who wrote
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:46.600]  Obamacare is for abortion carbon taxes and open borders and gun control I mean
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:51.120]  does anyone believe this the system is cramming him down the throat because he's
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:58.160]  a big banker raider hedge fund globalist Bev and they call him a business man he
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:05.160]  was a hedge fund runner I mean in this world you know American business is it's
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:09.360]  supposed to be you know entrepreneurs and the small mom and pops and that's what

[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:46.120]  caucuses and what happened to the vote from there to wherever it goes I can't
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:50.720]  say yeah well it went to a special place where Easter bunnies count them Bev

[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:14.160]  all right we've only got a few minutes left with Bev Harris clay listening in
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:20.360]  Iowa on channel 166 on XM anything else you wanted to add so you saw multiple
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:24.780]  precincts there all reporting Ron Paul but after that happened you don't know
[01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:32.960]  what went on no I don't anything else you'd like to add yeah I a lot there you
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:39.320]  know we have our floor I had here okay but I think for the most part people
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:49.360]  here are grounded enough to see through the slick car salesman speak and
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:54.720]  fancy hairdo and the crisp white shirt with the sleeves rolled up give me a
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:55:01.160]  break dude's never worked a day in his life you're talking about mittens yeah I
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:07.640]  mean I'm around people I I'm a diesel mechanic ideal you know I I bust ass
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:15.520]  excuse me and it makes me sick to be for these people to come out and stand on a
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:21.280]  hay bale and act all folksy it's it's kind of condescending no you're right I
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:24.920]  really appreciate your call I remember Bush going out to Crawford and they
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:29.760]  admitted it they had old tractors they weren't using and hay bales and he'd
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:33.920]  get out there with a chainsaw I mean it's it's Alice in Wonderland but but
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.840]  again babe I go back to the other point people aren't buying it anymore the
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:41.520]  systems losing more and more credibility right right where do you see this
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:45.640]  going well I have to tell you I like the car salesman in allergy I'm gonna still
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:51.720]  let me use that well I think that we are waking up I mean I do see you know on
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:56.200]  the populist movement waking up on both the right and the left which is good
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:00.640]  and now you start seeing real attempts and panicky trying to get a wedge them
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:04.480]  apart so that they never talk to each other and find the common denominators
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:12.040]  but we have to continue to build that and I don't think it needs to be a hundred
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:15.560]  percent organized by anyone personally just need to keep you know waking up
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:19.240]  our friends and helping people see that this is this is real this is important
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:26.720]  and we don't have a democratic system haven't had for several decades but the
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:32.520]  magic show is becoming we're starting to see you know it is it's a bunch of used
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:39.680]  car salesmen up there with a prepared story that that they tell everyone and
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:44.560]  then everybody is getting better about not just believing whatever it is they
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:49.200]  see bad though when do we pass when do we pass the Rubicon though because even
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:52.520]  if people don't agree with some of Ron Paul's policies or ideas the whole
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:57.720]  systems attacking him Al Gore's come out against him he clearly is not under
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:02.240]  their control and when do you cross that point where the system so discredited
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:06.440]  that when they demonize you that's actually an endorsement right that's a
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:09.680]  good thing I mean I think we're starting to get there and that needs to
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:13.800]  continue one of the things that's been so helpful for me is to look back in
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:17.880]  history and see when there have been situations where there has been somebody
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:22.520]  that needs to be dealt with like this and there isn't you know the power it has
[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:27.680]  to shift it it can and does happen I mean if you look at the movement in the
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:32.040]  world to ban slavery not here but in England which was a hundred years
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:37.040]  beforehand they were completely dominated their economy was dependent on
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:41.360]  slaves it was the sugar trade then was as powerful as the oil trade is now it
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:46.000]  wasn't feasible for them to ban it but they did when you start looking at the
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:52.360]  fact that power shifts can happen and they do happen but they're not
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:56.600]  necessarily going to happen in five minutes but the thing is you know once
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:58:01.080]  people see the truth they don't not see the truth well that's right I mean in
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:07.160]  1800 maybe 1% of the population was abolitionist by 18 you know 67 68 it
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:11.000]  was banned and and then it still took time to change you know from that point
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:15.160]  get real freedom but it's a process nothing could stop people when they're
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:18.360]  on the right and don't back off and don't stop right and and you're a
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:22.040]  visionary at Trailblazer you've been proven right Ron Paul myself it's
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:26.040]  happening listeners out there we're not gonna win this war overnight it takes

[02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:02.480]  his supporters look I know Rand has come out and said that he doesn't think
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:07.240]  that it'd be a good idea for Paul to run as a third party and I could see that
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:11.040]  hurting the legacy of campaign for liberty being seen as people that helped
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:15.560]  Obama get back in but everything's coming to a head right now I mean if
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:19.760]  Mittens Romney is a carbon copy of Barack Obama he just has lighter skin
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:28.400]  only difference then I mean what's the difference if Ron Paul runs third party
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:32.000]  if he doesn't you know when in these upcoming primaries he's he and he's in
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:38.200]  the race then he will be injecting real issues and he's got the base to do it we
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:45.000]  need to attack the new order now we need to belly up to the bar and and and
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:49.960]  force our way into these discussions now so people as everything unfolds and

[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:04.880]  in let's go to some of your phone calls right now I'll get more into this news
[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:12.440]  coming up but Julio in Illinois you're on the air welcome Alex happy new year and
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:17.640]  happy new year to all the freedom lovers out there I was in Acne Iowa last
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:26.120]  night at the Paul campaign party and I actually interviewed Corporal Jesse
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:34.040]  Thorsten before CIA operative Dana Bash interviewed him and I was trying to get
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:40.080]  him on my friend's radio show Liberty Talk Radio and he said you know he just
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:44.080]  got into the party wanted to calm down a bit and he said come back in a few minutes
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:49.360]  I was like yeah sure no problem and I mean his response Alex and I hope maybe I
[02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:54.960]  can send you the MP3 of this I mean when CNN cuts his interview off or cuts
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:03:00.440]  cuts him off last night he he was going to talk about Israel meant he was
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:03.280]  mentioning that Israel can defend themselves you mentioned that the
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:08.680]  Israeli military is capable to you know Ron Paul speech back in the 80s when
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:12.600]  they attacked the reactor he said well that's their their sovereign right to do
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:18.280]  that I mean Israel's got 400 800 nukes conservatively I mean there's maybe it's
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:22.880]  just ridiculous to say Ron Paul wants us to be nuked so we've got to have more
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:26.880]  wars again this is all part of bankrupting this country and our
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:32.640]  military being used to be the Empire's enforcers you're welcome to send us your
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:38.240]  MP3 interview with him you want to put you on hold and once we get it come back
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:42.360]  to you you can introduce it to us because I haven't gotten to it yet we've
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:47.520]  got it up at info wars calm CNN pulls the plug on live feet of soldier talking
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:51.400]  about voting for Ron Paul but if you've got the interview with what he actually
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:55.920]  said I'd like him to not be censored that's pretty exciting is there some is

[02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:09.640]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:20.440]  okay one of our well correspondents he sent us a lot of good stuff over the
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:24.000]  years Julio's on hold he's been on there for like an hour to get on air and
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:31.280]  tell us that he interviewed the military specialist I guess army veteran who was
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:36.080]  on CNN and got the feed cut when he tried to talk about how the military
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:41.440]  doesn't want to attack Iran CNN polls the plug on live feed of soldier talking
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:47.960]  about voting for Ron Paul the soldier starts explaining how preemptive war is
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:51.920]  the greatest danger and the feed is cut and you can clearly see it cut and they
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:57.320]  do this stuff all the time and so as soon as he's able to MP3 us that to our
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:01.480]  email system we'll go back to him and play the clip and then play with the

[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:03.840]  to get it but not fully the only person who's real is Ron Paul and that's why
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:08.400]  the entire system including Al Gore came out last night and said don't vote for
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:15.360]  Ron Paul he's a cook he's a nut this is a confirmed con artist scammer who says

[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  it's just it's too rich here's some of the other news this is out of CNS news
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:34.720]  Planned Parenthood's annual report they got 487.4 million in tax money well
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:39.000]  that's just federal here in Travis County where I sit doing this radio show
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:47.080]  Austin, Texas they take money from every business in the city and they pay it
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:52.600]  for Planned Parenthood to open up more offices than Starbucks basically on
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:55.880]  every corner they're in the schools counseling the kids they've got it where
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:59.280]  they can get 13 year olds to have abortions without parental consent so
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:02.760]  why not in California have the governor and he did three months ago sign a bill
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:05.840]  saying they'll give your kids shots without consent they're not gonna stop
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:10.360]  oh you're 13 year olds pregnant you we're gonna take them for a medical
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:16.640]  experiment but but we're taking it to the chop shop but if you're 13 year old
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:19.560]  wants to go to the state fair with the school or go to the planetarium you
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:24.680]  better get a letter signed but hey put them in the stirrups and get get to you

[02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:45.880]  parents shouldn't be involved and then Planned Parenthood here where I live has
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:49.320]  like cover articles in the statesmen and the the Chronicle and other birdcage
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:53.640]  liners who thank God especially the you know the statesmen can barely stay afloat
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:57.120]  and rust up I mean because nobody's gonna read your garbage soon I mean you
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:04.160]  know the trendy windy chronicle because it acts trendy and you know
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:09.760]  sniveling you know has a few trendies reading it but it's always about how
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:13.360]  Planned Parenthood is under attack and there's fundraisers and everyone
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:19.200]  scurrying around I'm gonna do some more reports on Planned Parenthood with the
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:23.600]  quotes not not from 50 years ago we've got those but the new ones where he
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:29.080]  yeah we got to get more fundraising to get rid of these blacks hey hey can I
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:32.680]  can I give money just to get rid of the blacks oh you bet you can all those
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:38.000]  audio recordings oh yeah what about Mexicans oh yes oh we'll get rid of
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:42.560]  those and and and they've got them in all the minority neighborhoods and then
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:47.840]  you've got all the paid-off minority groups who'll never talk about it because
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:52.360]  they're there to give you racial consciousness to to have race war in
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:56.200]  this country and racial division the government can control not to actually
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:02.840]  stop your babies from getting chopped up the larry conchistas won't tell you
[02:15:02.840 --> 02:15:05.520]  about that because they're paid for by the Ford Foundation who wants to make
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:12.520]  sure you're deader than a hammer but here's the report right here according
[02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:15.680]  to its latest annual report the Planned Parenthood Federation of America
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:24.120]  received 487 million in tax dollars over a 12-month period and performed 329,455
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:28.440]  abortions in addition the number of adopted adoption referrals maybe the
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:34.360]  organization continue to decline even though there's a huge premium on babies
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:38.160]  including minority babies I always hear the talking point my Planned Parenthood
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:42.880]  and others about who's gonna adopt the brown and black babies there are
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:45.880]  christian groups a lot of around the block that will adopt mentally retarded
[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:52.880]  brown babies but the the issue here is that Planned Parenthood is a racist
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:58.960]  organization they're dedicated to it you know real racist don't run up in some
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:03.720]  clown Nazi outfit that's usually you know some some globalist you know group
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:06.560]  out there trying to get a hate law passed and you know a half of them are
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:12.360]  federal agents up there I mean this has happened over and over again it's you
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:17.880]  know it's come out over and over again real racist come up and go I'm liberal I
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:24.280]  mean and have the NPR lisping affected voice that's like an army tank driving up
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:28.160]  to run over you and your family playing ice cream truck music we're friendly
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:34.560]  we're loving not threatening yeah they're threatening again it's camouflage
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:43.120]  it's trendiness camouflage loving care so much about you and it's just
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:47.320]  disgusting absolutely disgusting what this organization does I mean the
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:51.120]  Margaret Sanger quotes about we gotta hire black leaders the blacks don't
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:54.720]  trust us and once we get enough black leaders posing as liberals we can
[02:16:54.720 --> 02:17:03.760]  exterminate these weeds and again let's just be honest about it okay and I've
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:07.840]  at every liberal black group I've talked to or Hispanic group they won't talk
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:12.200]  about it because they're funded by it they just like going to the meetings and
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:15.200]  having the families come in there with their racial consciousness and bash
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:21.560]  whiting all day and sit around and feel real good meanwhile the leadership
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:24.680]  knows full well what they're doing
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:29.480]  but Jesse Jackson you go back to the records would talk about this till they
[02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:36.240]  bought him off I mean how much money does it take to get you to to sell your
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:39.760]  people on it being trendy and cool to get your kids killed and the people say
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:42.600]  oh well look how many criminals you've already gotten problems and who wants to
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:47.800]  pay for it you get rid of the welfare you encourage the family and then these
[02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:52.480]  problems would disappear the globalists want social rot they don't want the
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:58.960]  problems to disappear it's on record before welfare and breaking up with the
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:01.880]  family and saying you can have money but you can't have a man in the house in

[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:20.840]  400,000 pesos what is that like $5,000 Argentine laboratories company was
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:28.400]  fined 400,000 pesos by judge Agoninsky following a report issued by the
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:34.040]  National Administration of Medicine food and technology for the killing of 14
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:38.760]  babies during illegal lab vaccine trials conducted between 07 and 08
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:45.320]  likewise two doctors Hector Abate and Miguel Trudney I can't pronounce it
[02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:50.400]  have been fine with 300,000 pesos each for irregularities during the studies and
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:54.320]  it just goes into all these kids dying and that's the tip of the iceberg I mean
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:59.720]  I just constantly see these reports and then we're like we don't trust that
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:05.560]  here's a report out of WLS Brownsville Texas police have shot and killed an
[02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:09.800]  armed 15-year-old in a middle school in South Texas Brownsville detective JJ
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:14.640]  Trevino says police received a call around 8 a.m. Wednesday that there was
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:17.960]  an individual with a weapon at Cummings Middle School police found a student
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:22.440]  with a handgun in a hallway and shot him Cameron County Justice of Peace Kip
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:26.800]  V. Johnson Hodge pull the Brownsville Herald the student died shooting remains
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:29.520]  under investigation by people that did the shooting but the government was an
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:35.560]  eighth grade student at the school they say the school is immediately placed on
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:39.560]  lockdown so he can shoot everybody if he was a shooter and no one else was
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:43.040]  injured Trevino said he had no information on why the student had the
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:47.560]  gun who even knows you know if it was a fake gun you'd never know that because
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:52.400]  they'd cover their behinds so there's some of those reports and I see these
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:55.440]  kind of reports every day and never give them the attention they should this is
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:27:03.240]  out of Newark Daily News and it says teen mom shoots intruder on New Year's Eve
[02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:08.680]  to protect three-month-old son and I see this all the time where you know the
[02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:13.040]  lady shoots the intruder and then the media ask is was it right they did this
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:16.840]  you know they told a recently widowed teen mom shot and killed an intruder
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:19.280]  protect three-month-old son on New Year's Eve after asking I love an
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:24.600]  operator for permission you don't need permission local media reported that was
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:28.720]  just like the woman in California asked permission all the guys busting in and
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:33.760]  she keeps shooting him and he keeps coming Sarah McKinley 18 was alone with
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:40.280]  her son in Blanchard Oklahoma home at 2 p.m. December 31st when two men tried to
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:45.120]  break in her husband had just passed away from lung cancer on Christmas day
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:50.720]  well she grabbed a shotgun called 901 and begged for the operator to send help
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:55.040]  well you had helped lady she stayed online I bet it was your husband bought
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:59.280]  you that gun for a terrifying 21 minutes and asked the dispatcher it was all
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:04.840]  right to shoot the men who forced their way in I can't tell you that you can do
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:08.560]  that what an idiot dispatcher even in Oklahoma you think they'd know better
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:12.400]  but you do what you have to protect your baby the dispatcher told her according
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:17.640]  to ABC News the young man fired when Justin Martin 24 who was wielding a
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:21.680]  12-inch knife kicked his way through the door I guess he thought this was
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:27.720]  Chicago or New York where everybody's disarmed except the criminals I mean you

[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:15.040]  know pop in and take over the program I mean they're actually doing that now for
[02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:18.520]  real so we've got a little bit of a joke this evening in full or as nightly

[02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:27.680]  trial subscription right now to prisonplanet.tv of the next four or five
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:34.080]  minutes I noticed that gold is up I don't know 70 something bucks since it hit
[02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:40.440]  bottom a few weeks ago and I wanted to get Ted's take on why that's happening
[02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:44.440]  Ted of Midas Resources one of our longtime sponsors and also the owner of
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:50.200]  this network Ted what is going on right now with precious metals and how does a
[02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:54.360]  China and India moving towards new currencies tie into this well I mean
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:57.960]  right now China is one of the biggest buyers in the marketplace I mean they've
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:01.920]  really increased their commitment to what they want to buy as a matter of fact
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:05.680]  they're trying to make deals with one of the several of the major mines out
[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:09.200]  there to try to buy all of their production which is taking a lot of that
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:14.320]  away but what's really going on Alex is this European crisis I mean the United
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:19.280]  States the Federal Reserve has pumped so much money into our central banks that
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:23.600]  they're sitting on so much cash that that's that's helped keep the reserve
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:28.360]  away the the crisis from completely falling apart in Europe but right now
[02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:31.760]  that's all printed money it's starting to show up we're starting to see the
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:37.200]  inflation come back again we hit about 1550 right now we're sitting at 1613
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:41.760]  gold and we've seen a high today here let me just take a quick peek here just
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:46.080]  want to refresh we've seen a high I'm sorry we're sitting at 1614 seen a high
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:51.960]  today of 1619 90 1590 250 on the low but that's starting to come back up again
[02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:56.000]  and it's reflecting the fact that there's so much problem going on over in
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.720]  Europe and and and the very fact that we've solved our problems from printing
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:04.920]  money and making creating these big deposits in the central banks basically
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:10.800]  to bail out the buddies and the friends of the central banking system here
[02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:16.480]  Chad let me ask you this question you and others predicted that they could
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:23.120]  raise margin calls in the speculative gold market the paper market to lower
[02:36:23.120 --> 02:36:27.760]  prices and kill speculation they've done that to an extreme degree they also
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:32.600]  created uncertainty with the MF global heist in commodities across the board
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:36.320]  that we see oil and other commodities ticking back up when you have central
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:39.960]  banks worldwide making the announcement that they're going to have concerted
[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:45.720]  accelerated devaluation not just gold and silver but every other commodity you
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:50.280]  know it stands to reckon are going to go up but what other tricks does the
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:55.000]  establishment have to drive down gold and silver which they know when it's
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:01.280]  valuable and as high prices discredits and competes with their fiat Ponzi scheme
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:04.760]  money well that's the thing since they've taken a lot of leverage away from
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:08.320]  the futures market which usually drives the price of gold I mean when people
[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:13.480]  look at spot gold when I'm quoting 614 50 that's the settling price of
[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:17.440]  contracts that are expiring right now at this moment and that's what the
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:23.080]  delivery would be at this at this very second it used to be 10 10 percent down
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:28.440]  to leverage you know 100 percent of the goods well now it's 20 percent down to
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:33.040]  leverage 100 percent so you know they can raise that reserve quite a requirement
[02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:37.560]  even higher but they've already knocked a lot of the speculators away you know
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:41.320]  they're just doing their best I mean the central banks of the world also hold
[02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:46.160]  some of the largest reserves that there is in physical gold they have it
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:51.200]  mostly stored in New York City and they have these lease deals that they have
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:56.040]  with the futures market and they can raise and lower their lease rate for
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:59.560]  which they charge in order to sell their gold into the futures market but
[02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:03.320]  that's really about what they have left it's all smoke and mirrors right now
[02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:07.480]  they're heavily relying on the printing press to keep the economy pulled
[02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:11.520]  together you know it would be better if it blew apart especially for Ron Paul
[02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:16.640]  because he would be just you know proven right again and you know the people in
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:20.600]  Iowa obviously would have pay more attention to Ron Paul but anyways that
[02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:25.320]  setting that aside there's just so much chicanery that's going on I mean you
[02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:29.600]  just simply cannot print money without having a devaluation of the currency
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:33.840]  itself like you said they're trying to manipulate the prices of gold down by
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:37.160]  raising the reserve requirements making it more difficult to trade in the
[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:41.600]  futures market but the physical market is picking up right where it lets off and
[02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:45.120]  that's where you see in places like China getting involved I mean that
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:51.960]  literally in many many times it's like 22 times as much gold purchased in 2011
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:57.880]  then what then there wasn't in 2010 so I mean the market is definitely European
[02:38:57.880 --> 02:39:03.240]  and also in the Far East is growing for gold and silver yet here you see the
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:10.520]  dollar strong today sitting at roughly around 80 dollars and the and the the
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:13.880]  foreign currencies are falling but the only reason why that's happening is
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:17.880]  because the crisis that's happening in Europe is more scary than the crisis
[02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:21.040]  that's happening in the United States but basically the United States most
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:26.320]  analysts say is sitting on an even bigger unsustainable derivative debt and
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:30.320]  we've been tricked to think that it's our own personal or even government debt
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:38.520]  even though the 15 plus trillion that is owed is now 100.3% of yearly GDP so
[02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:44.440]  debt has now yearly outstripped the GDP of the entire country exactly where the
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:49.080]  bankers wanted to get us so now it's time to start our implosion and the very
[02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:52.080]  criminals that did it will now dance around and say they're our saviors I
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:55.600]  see this as a gold and silver buying opportunities you know I've got a little
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:58.080]  bit of silver a little bit of gold you know over the years get a little bit
[02:39:58.080 --> 02:40:01.920]  here a little bit there this is an emergency backup but I think now is the
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:05.040]  time to get involved in the minute or two we've got left head tell the radio
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:08.520]  listeners about some of the specials you're offering and we're almost out of
[02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:15.120]  the book big brother they are welling a nightmare come true you get that free and
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:20.080]  the film exposing the banking cartel that's excellent American dream you get
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:25.160]  both those free when you get three silver dollars at cost ladies and gentlemen
[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:29.440]  that banners at info wars comm at the right hand top corner and also go to
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:35.680]  mitusresources.com and find it or you can call and get it 800-686-2237
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:41.680]  800-686-2237 you're not going to find a better price on the silver anywhere and
[02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:45.320]  then you get free shipping and two free gifts on top of it because Ted wants to
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:49.920]  have this as a lost leader to introduce you to golden silver but if you're
[02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:53.560]  really serious about it and want to protect yourself I think the best move
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:57.280]  for myself personally is golden silver and I think right now is a buying
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:01.080]  opportunity Ted's got quite a bit of gold and silver he's amassed I know he
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:04.400]  buys when it goes down now even though it's gone up some he could still give
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:07.640]  you the older price Ted what are some of the best deals you've got tell folks
[02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:12.200]  about it well I mean the walking Liberty half right now is at $14.37
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:17.400]  that's a wonderful buy I mean they were close to $20 when silver was back up at
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:22.200]  $50 I also have the Lakota Nation round at 37.01
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:26.880]  Frank's right now are at 352 we buy a full year subscription to the international
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:30.360]  forecaster if you only buy one I don't think you'll find that deal out there
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:34.320]  that's like less than $1,000 an ounce when you factor in the price of the
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:40.160]  subscription the you know I've got a few of those campaign for Liberty proofs it's
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:43.880]  not going to be much if somebody wants volume there forget it but I would
[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:47.040]  suggest that you get involved with that it's one more way to spread the word
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:52.560]  about Ron Paul that that deal with the video and the silver dollars Alex you
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:55.240]  know that's what people really need to be getting involved with because that
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:42:00.360]  video explains the banking system it really goes in it dives into how money
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:04.480]  came into existence in the first place and until you understand that concept
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:07.880]  you're not going to be able to answer these economic questions that are
[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:11.920]  happening right now why why is it why are we in the situation that we're in
[02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:16.080]  why are the Europeans standing there protesting outside while the governments
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:19.560]  are trying to back down and pull in their budgets you know why is the German
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:23.280]  why is German trying to get out of the EU because they can't trust the no
[02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:27.280]  undoubtedly we're sitting on top of powder keg and all the elites are moving
[02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:31.160]  out of paper so fast it'll make your head spin folks give minus resources a
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:37.800]  call today 800 686 2237 the truly trusted name in precious metals for now I
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:42.320]  guess more than 15 years but Ted's been in the business 30 plus I was looking
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:47.880]  around for a golden silver sponsor 15 years ago and found Ted Anderson and
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:51.320]  bought some gold and silver myself and and just over the years they are the
[02:42:51.320 --> 02:42:55.200]  most competitive out there that's why they and Ted is now the fourth or fifth
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:59.280]  biggest gold and silver dealer in the US you see his ads nationally on
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:05.400]  television because he's so competitive 800 686 2237 Ted Anderson thank you so
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:08.920]  much for popping in with us yeah thanks for having me up Alex you bet here's
[02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:14.800]  that number of you missed it 800 686 2 to 3 7 now Julio's computers on the
[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:19.280]  Fritz the guy that said he was going to send us the clip but we're having the
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:24.040]  nightly news tonight he's trying to send us the MP3 of his full interview with
[02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:29.320]  the military gentleman who was on CNN and they cut the feed now if this was an
[02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:36.720]  accident you know maybe but I've seen it too many times on C-span and CNN when
[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:40.440]  something like this gets said the same thing happens and I have another report
[02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:45.680]  here in DC they started bringing up corruption and ethics investigations in
[02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:50.200]  the feed cut that's out of the Washington examiner and it was also a local ABC
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:55.400]  News WTOP covered it so I mean this stuff's happening more and more which
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:59.760]  shows the system is concerned about exposure in fact we have that clip
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:06.120]  ready here is that clip CNN pulls the plug on live feed of soldier talking
[02:44:06.120 --> 02:44:11.120]  about voting for Ron Paul the soldier starts explaining how preemptive war is
[02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:15.320]  the greatest danger and the feed is cut here it is well I'm I'm really excited
[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:19.320]  about a lot of his ideas especially when it comes to bringing the soldiers home
[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:23.120]  I've been serving for ten years now and all ten years of those have been during
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:26.280]  wartime I'd like to see a little peacetime army and I think he has the
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:30.200]  right idea now you have done two tours in Afghanistan you told me you're gonna
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:35.120]  go back for us for a third tour I mean if you can see your your neck right there
[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:38.800]  what you have on your tattoo 9-eleven remember in that picture of the Twin
[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:42.400]  Towers you know some Republicans out there have been saying that Ron Paul
[02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:46.640]  would be very dangerous for this country because he wants to bring troops
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:50.880]  like you back from your post from all over the world well I think it would be
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:54.360]  even more dangerous to start nitpicking wars with other countries someone like
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:45:01.400]  Iran Israel is more than capable all right we just lost our touch connection
[02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:04.720]  unfortunately with data data standby if you can hear me we're gonna get back you
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:09.120]  want to go to Kenny Crowley over by the way you again I don't have some fetish
[02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:13.880]  up here bashing Israel Israel's run by the very same type technocrats that run
[02:45:13.880 --> 02:45:18.760]  our country their population has been rioting and protesting but it needs to
[02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:24.440]  be pointed out Wolf Blitzer do you know what Wolf Blitzer did before he became
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:35.200]  CNN's main foreign correspondent back in 1990 or so he was the head lobbyist for
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:38.920]  the large consortiums of Israeli government lobbyist in the United
[02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:43.040]  States and connected directly at the highest levels of the Israeli government
[02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:47.240]  I mean if anybody is a foreign spy it's Wolf Blitzer he should be investigated
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:50.920]  for that and it's the same thing all these British agents and Russians
[02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:55.760]  whatever I am for America I am for the sovereignty of our country and I mean
[02:45:55.760 --> 02:45:59.680]  Wolf Blitzer just just go look at his his background so it's very interesting
[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:03.760]  that he was running the show and that happened now I give it a 20% chance the
[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:08.240]  feed really did cut out now but reportedly from folks that have talked to
[02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:11.200]  him the guy went on to point out Israel's got hundreds of nukes which by the
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:15.160]  way CNN still won't say they have nukes at the Washington Post says it's
[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:20.120]  rumored they have nukes no it's come out their own scientist and major reports
[02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:25.480]  Jane's weapons quarterly CIA reports Israel a decade ago reportedly had 400
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:30.440]  of of of high-tech design some estimates are as high as 800 they bought
[02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:34.520]  race specific bio weapons from South Africa this is all come out so that's
[02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:39.360]  probably why they cut the feed because reportedly according to Julio I was
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:41.880]  giving us good info in the past but he's having trouble sending us the mp3 right
[02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:48.760]  now he got into all of that in fact he's Julio even still holding there because
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:51.840]  I know it's gonna get him on his well let's go back to him I understand
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:54.880]  computers being on the fridge you got to go to the library just get it to us we
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:59.200]  can play it but what do you make of that whole exchange and what happened oh
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:03.960]  sorry I'll come on speaker on one second let me get you off that's okay I
[02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:07.240]  know you were just on hold so we could try to get that audio from you yeah you
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:13.560]  could almost just plug your mp3 into the computer and play it over air for us it
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:17.160]  it's still it's still in the works right now I'm actually converting it because
[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:21.240]  there was in some weird file hold on a second okay can you hear me better yeah
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:25.240]  I can hear you now what are you okay what do you make of singing and yeah go
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:29.880]  ahead being there last night I want to make it clear to everyone out there
[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:37.360]  there was perfect connection wirelessly satellite wise between you know all the
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:42.560]  major networks not one network that was covering Paul in Acony last night had
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:47.800]  any satellite issues whatsoever watching that interview take place I felt my
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:51.360]  buddy of mine was trying to get on CNN he was like waving towards the camera that
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:57.200]  interview was pre-recorded because CNN had a T they had a TV right next to their
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:01.080]  camera which showed the actual live feed so that interview was being pre-recorded
[02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:09.080]  and the so they're posing parts of the situation room it's not even live no
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:13.640]  yeah even live that yeah yeah it wasn't live at all it was pre-recorded
[02:48:13.640 --> 02:48:18.260]  interview and then I'm guessing CNN looked over the tape saw that he was
[02:48:18.260 --> 02:48:22.840]  going to mention that Israel can defend themselves against Iran and like you
[02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:27.120]  mentioned Wolf Blitzer with his ties to Israel he had to pull the plug there's
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:30.920]  no way they can allow why would they even show it though and cut it off if they
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:34.440]  were gonna cut it I mean I know it's I mean I know I mean I know a lot of those
[02:48:34.440 --> 02:48:37.360]  shows Glenn Beck and others are admittedly taped to air I've been in
[02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:41.560]  CNN headquarters and watched them you know doing my interview 30 minutes before
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:46.000]  it airs and it looked live with Joy Behar or whatever I mean I get that that
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:49.640]  goes on the view is actually live some days that that was why I was able to
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:52.880]  say whatever I wanted when I was on there I went into the green room before I
[02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:56.520]  went on to make sure it was live it was delayed about 15 seconds but that's
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:49:01.000]  semi-live but I mean why so that's probably the answer of why they would
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:05.840]  still air it because well you say you were watching their TVs there how far
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:14.360]  behind was it from being live it was it was far behind I'd say maybe even if
[02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:19.080]  maybe even a minute or so oh that's that's still essentially yeah now that's
[02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:22.760]  still essentially pretty much live that's I mean I mean yeah so that's why
[02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:27.320]  they did air it I mean but there are problems on the road I'd say 80% chance
[02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:31.080]  they cut it just so they would you know be able to make sure that something he
[02:49:31.080 --> 02:49:34.000]  was gonna say wasn't gonna get out because you know so-called mainstream
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:37.720]  media in the US will not admit that Israel has nukes you know that right
[02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:43.520]  well exactly and that's the thing like on the night when you hear the interview
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:49.240]  this soldier you we've seen the media's spin on Ron Paul oh Ron Paul's good but
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:53.760]  his foreign policy is so awful you CNN there's no way they can allow a soldier
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:58.520]  to say Ron Paul for policy is actually good because the people watching CNN
[02:49:58.520 --> 02:50:04.080]  will say hey this soldier no I hear you Julio Julio we're gonna have to get back
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:06.960]  to you later get us that audio great job I gotta start jamming calls in right
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:09.680]  now that we're gonna skip this break because I gotta get to everybody right
[02:50:09.680 --> 02:50:14.480]  now we're gonna skip this network break here let's go to a great job Julio we'll
[02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:18.300]  talk to you after the show let's talk to Chris in Illinois been holding for a
[02:50:18.300 --> 02:50:22.800]  long time Chris you're on the air thanks hi Alex I saw an anomaly at the
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:27.040]  Iowa caucus last night I was observer I'm an Illinois resident in Davenport
[02:50:27.040 --> 02:50:31.800]  Iowa's right across the river at the Radisson hotel there was three precincts
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:36.400]  two of them were in one room I was an observer specifically at one of them it
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:43.720]  was Scott County D33 and they had a small number of people turned out 34 and D63
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:48.000]  had 263 they're kind of facing opposite directions in the room and when they
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:53.920]  gave their speeches it was all for both groups okay but when when the boats were
[02:50:53.920 --> 02:51:00.000]  being counted a strange thing happened the lights turned off when not when the
[02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.560]  boats were being counted but when they're being collected the lights turned
[02:51:02.560 --> 02:51:07.360]  off the lights turned off that's like in an old who done it movie the lights
[02:51:07.360 --> 02:51:11.560]  turn off and 20 seconds later somebody has a knife in their chest let me ask
[02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:18.280]  you this how long were the lights off at least 15 20 seconds the thing is were
[02:51:18.280 --> 02:51:23.000]  you there or did you see it on television I was there I was taking
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:26.480]  pictures so you're there and the lights go off right like here's the bag of
[02:51:26.480 --> 02:51:30.360]  votes and it's like light goes off they're collecting them from the crowd
[02:51:30.360 --> 02:51:37.560]  there was 263 people and oh and then a special little for Romney oh my god
[02:51:37.560 --> 02:51:41.120]  you've got a shooting YouTube video sir with your testimony right now you've
[02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:45.520]  got the floor tell us where you were again what you saw I was taking pictures
[02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:51.240]  of D33 which only had 34 people but it was in the same room and somebody turned
[02:51:51.240 --> 02:51:54.880]  a flashlight on pretty quick after the votes went off and I think that that was
[02:51:54.880 --> 02:52:01.040]  fair Ron Paul got 19 votes met five Rick Santorum five new four and some guy
[02:52:01.040 --> 02:52:06.520]  Gary Blunk got one okay the other group that was in the same room you know
[02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:09.960]  there's people handing their votes down the thing there's people walking down
[02:52:09.960 --> 02:52:15.600]  the middle collecting them and stuff and it was completely different boat Romney
[02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:23.760]  out 106 Santorum 74 gingrich 40 Paul 31 Perry 9 and Bachman 3 now I personally
[02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:30.080]  believe that Paul did not win in that boat but I think that it's entirely
[02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:34.320]  possible that meet they were supposed to be a lot more but that's directly out
[02:52:34.320 --> 02:52:38.600]  of a who done it where the lights turn off and then the lights go back on and
[02:52:38.600 --> 02:52:45.640]  something's been stolen or somebody's dead anything else you'd like to add I
[02:52:45.640 --> 02:52:52.240]  shouldn't laugh it's just ridiculous Scott County D63 at the Radisson and
[02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:58.880]  Davenport and it happened and all the people there know it happened and I
[02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:03.080]  don't know if this proves anything or whatever but it's really really
[02:53:03.080 --> 02:53:07.200]  interesting I hear you God bless you you know I know the New York Times a few
[02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:14.880]  years ago said that I was insane and was at a hotel in Virginia imagining that
[02:53:14.880 --> 02:53:19.040]  Bilderberg group was there I mean it's on record Bilderberg was there a secret
[02:53:19.040 --> 02:53:22.920]  service was there and they said that I was in the in the in thought cars were
[02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:29.120]  following me and that men were in the you know in the in behind trees and they
[02:53:29.120 --> 02:53:34.400]  say that I basically had a schizophrenic event when a fire alarm went off they
[02:53:34.400 --> 02:53:38.440]  know full well in my film we're down there eating a hamburger at 11 30 at
[02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:43.240]  night before the bar and restaurant close myself and Rob Jacobson I got to
[02:53:43.240 --> 02:53:49.320]  go up and do coast-to-coast AM right after that so I guess it was actually
[02:53:49.320 --> 02:53:52.520]  about 12 30 must have been closed at one because that's one o'clock Eastern was
[02:53:52.520 --> 02:54:00.320]  when that show comes on 1 a.m. and I walk in five minutes before they call me to
[02:54:00.320 --> 02:54:05.000]  go on the show and right as I go on the show the alarm goes off but that's not
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:09.120]  the issue while I'm down there eating a hamburger the head of security walks up
[02:54:09.120 --> 02:54:13.040]  and says I don't want if I never talked to in my life I've been checked in for a
[02:54:13.040 --> 02:54:16.680]  few hours and the hotels you know got people in it it's just a day before
[02:54:16.680 --> 02:54:20.480]  Bilderberg gets there a day and a half and he says I don't we have people that
[02:54:20.480 --> 02:54:24.840]  come in here and steal vases and things and throw fire alarms if anyone does it
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:31.760]  I'm going to arrest them and so was a threat but but then if that wasn't bad
[02:54:31.760 --> 02:54:38.640]  enough I'm gonna go to your calls I went outside during the fire alarm and a
[02:54:38.640 --> 02:54:41.760]  fire truck pulls in all the people are out there and the head of security walks
[02:54:41.760 --> 02:54:44.760]  over right in front of Jacobson and others and starts cussing at me and
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:49.920]  saying I'm going to get you Jones and turn your cameras off is some of the
[02:54:49.920 --> 02:54:53.280]  guys had cameras 10 feet away I was like get over here but I mean they were
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:58.240]  trying to blame something on me point is a hundred percent but but the media
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:03.040]  won't even admit that Bilderberg group was there I mean Obama's there with
[02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:06.640]  Hillary secretly meeting it's all over the news where's Obama where's Obama a
[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:10.280]  day and a half later and and the media is making fun of me saying it didn't
[02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:16.240]  exist that's how stupid they think you are okay let's go to Donna in New
[02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:20.560]  Hampshire Donna what's your view on all this hi Alex thanks for taking my call
[02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:25.240]  I was hoping to get in to talk to Bev Harris and we worked with Bev Harris
[02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:32.800]  back in 2008 and I can attest that that was completely rigged the New Hampshire
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:39.280]  vote they had absolutely no chain of custody just like Bev said and also
[02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:45.840]  their official seal was like a posted note and it was incredible the way that
[02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:51.720]  they did it I was an active Ron Paul supporter in New Hampshire at that time
[02:55:51.720 --> 02:55:58.040]  and we drove all over New Hampshire and we barely saw McCain signs anywhere
[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:03.520]  they were for Romney and a lot more for Paul and that's why I say I hold no
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:09.080]  illusions as at the fact that on January 10th we will probably see the same
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:15.440]  hanky-panky going on well we know it goes on and again I mean this is about
[02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:18.600]  tens of trillions of dollars that these criminal interest control running our
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:23.280]  nation this is about launching global domination and war the government will
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:28.520]  ship guns to Mexico to blame the Second Amendment it is certified criminal
[02:56:28.520 --> 02:56:33.560]  absolutely and and one other thing I just wanted to interject as far as
[02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:39.760]  Corporal Jesse Thornton or Thornton's I forget how his name is pronounced yeah I
[02:56:39.760 --> 02:56:47.000]  believe you know it's gonna look like he cannot be aired on TV and it's gonna
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:51.920]  make it look like CNN did the most conscious thing ever by shutting down
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:57:00.440]  the satellite because you the military and Army times do not allow active
[02:57:00.440 --> 02:57:06.200]  military in uniform to advocate a candidacy and by the way CNN it actually
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:10.640]  came out in world that daily 12 years ago mainly uses military satellites
[02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:14.400]  that's how they first got up I forgot that and it turned out most of their
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:19.280]  senior staff are doubling as Pentagon operatives you can actually type in top
[02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:23.640]  CNN staff or Pentagon psyops try that real quick Jeremy for the show ends great
[02:57:23.640 --> 02:57:27.880]  points ma'am again the callers just make very good points mark in Oregon you're
[02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:30.680]  gonna have to be our tail gunner here we're almost out of time we'll be back
[02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:35.640]  tonight 7 o'clock prison planet TV the nightly news mark go ahead yeah
[02:57:35.640 --> 02:57:39.520]  good morning Alex I tell you what I've got here I was gonna take longer than
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:43.560]  you've got left but I thought I'd just go over it as much as I can real fast go
[02:57:43.560 --> 02:57:48.560]  ahead yeah it's really time for Dr. Congressman Paul to stand up against the
[02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:53.480]  corrupt political vote rigging system of Republican New World Order operatives
[02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:59.400]  when the victory was stolen from him in New Hampshire in 2004 it was really time
[02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:04.400]  to stand up then 2009 stand up now they will continue to do this every time and
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:08.240]  will again be deprived of a president of the people he has got to stand up it's
[02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:11.800]  the only right thing to do it's the best sportsmanship it's not good
[02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:16.320]  sportsmanship to lay down for corruption it not true Alex well I mean we've got
[02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:21.800]  the referees openly cheating and you know nobody's off sides Ron Paul keeps
[02:58:21.800 --> 02:58:25.280]  winning they keep cheating they have the team as you have to take the field they
[02:58:25.280 --> 02:58:29.200]  just give the touchdowns to them and say the game is over you know I don't know
[02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:33.360]  if there's total smoking guns I think Ron Paul would come out he can't do without
[02:58:33.360 --> 02:58:38.200]  total smoking guns there's a lot of smoke but not total smoking guns great
[02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:41.800]  job the crew God bless you all
