[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:26.520]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones hello and welcome to the Alex
[00:26.520 --> 00:34.440]  Jones show I am not Alex Jones I am John V Wells sitting in and later with Alex Jones for this
[00:34.440 --> 00:45.120]  fifth day of June 2012 halfway there aren't we we'll be joined today by Dr. Teresa Dale for the
[00:45.120 --> 00:52.000]  first hour she is a world-class speaker she is a homeopath a state-approved instructor out there
[00:52.000 --> 01:00.960]  in California a healer a traditional naturopath certified clinical nutritionist doctor of
[01:00.960 --> 01:09.800]  naturopathic scientists medical consultant the inventor but more to the point she is a healer
[01:09.800 --> 01:16.640]  not only of others but of her self and one of the things she healed herself of was radiation
[01:16.640 --> 01:23.280]  poisoning from Chernobyl as you know the mainstream media is not covering the Fukushima disaster
[01:23.280 --> 01:29.440]  with the same verb that they did when the Chernobyl incident occurred back in the 80s there are a
[01:29.440 --> 01:37.040]  variety of reasons for this it ranges from saving face to not alarming the public and I'm sure
[01:37.040 --> 01:43.400]  there's some other political components that we're not entirely aware of that we can perceive it
[01:43.400 --> 01:50.640]  a couple of interesting news items that I'll get to in just a second Alex Jones is on his way back
[01:50.640 --> 02:00.400]  from Chantilly Virginia having scrutinized very closely the Bilderberg convention or meeting or
[02:00.400 --> 02:08.960]  whatever you might call it and I'll talk with him in the second hour and find out the latest and
[02:08.960 --> 02:15.760]  most raw intel that he has to offer he's been up there for days making his way back and then
[02:15.760 --> 02:21.640]  in the third hour Craig Hewlett will join us he has worked with the security services department
[02:21.640 --> 02:26.680]  homeland security Bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives but what he will talk
[02:26.680 --> 02:31.360]  about with us in the third hour has nothing to do with the alcohol or the tobacco but it will
[02:31.360 --> 02:38.160]  be how absolutely every keystroke every text every facts every cell phone call every hard line
[02:38.160 --> 02:45.960]  call everything is recorded and will be for the foreseeable future also a few key words to avoid
[02:45.960 --> 02:53.240]  such as my email box is blowing up if you say something like this well the computer is going
[02:53.240 --> 03:00.960]  to pick that up and and highlight your name on the list interesting stuff from the Info Wars site
[03:00.960 --> 03:08.760]  ecofascist James Hansen admits global warming is not man-made I am normally the Saturday night
[03:08.760 --> 03:12.840]  host of coast to coast AM and we enjoy a friendship with Alex Jones and his Info Wars
[03:12.840 --> 03:18.840]  Prison Planet organization it is with this mutual cooperation that we were able to bring
[03:18.840 --> 03:27.000]  information that will not be heard in other areas so we discussed many times I personally
[03:27.000 --> 03:34.520]  discussed many times that all weather is created by unequal heating of the earth's surface I don't
[03:34.520 --> 03:38.800]  think pollution is a good thing but I do not think that the human beings are causing the
[03:38.800 --> 03:47.480]  enormous planet to heat it's being caused by solar activity and now and now James Hansen admits
[03:47.480 --> 03:58.000]  global warming is not man-made here's another little tidbit five million Brazilian farmers are
[03:58.000 --> 04:07.160]  locked in a lawsuit with US based Monsanto suing for as much as 6.2 billion euros they say the
[04:07.160 --> 04:13.280]  genetically engineered product by this genetic engineering company has been collecting royalties
[04:13.280 --> 04:22.160]  on crops had unfairly claims as its own it's the mouse that roared and there will be a lot more
[04:22.160 --> 04:28.040]  roaring as time goes by as these products are revealed to be as damaging to health as many many
[04:28.040 --> 04:38.240]  scientists and researchers claim we'll be back with Dr. Teresa Dale very shortly on the Alex Jones

[07:04.440 --> 07:09.600]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[07:09.600 --> 07:15.320]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[07:15.320 --> 07:20.640]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[07:20.640 --> 07:25.560]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[07:25.560 --> 07:30.680]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[07:30.680 --> 07:35.640]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[07:35.640 --> 07:40.880]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really

[07:55.840 --> 08:04.440]  one eight seven seven three two seven zero three six five ease the t-rex of political talk Alex
[08:04.440 --> 08:14.120]  Jones on the GCN radio network Zombie Wells in for Alex Jones and with Alex Jones in the second
[08:14.120 --> 08:19.560]  hour but first Dr. Carissa Dale is with us since Europe is well known as the leader in
[08:19.560 --> 08:24.920]  medical research and education in the area of naturopathy bioenergetics magnetic fields and
[08:24.920 --> 08:31.560]  homeopathy Teresa Dale chose to fulfill her naturopathic studies in the USA and Europe I
[08:31.560 --> 08:38.400]  believe she has just returned from Europe she is I believe we could say she is a Chernobyl
[08:38.400 --> 08:45.280]  survivor because many did not they were sickened by the radiation release there and they did
[08:45.280 --> 08:51.840]  not make it Dr. Teresa Dale did welcome to the Alex Jones show how are you very good thank you
[08:51.840 --> 08:59.720]  so much and for the introduction and I'm happy to say that I did survive Chernobyl and I can
[08:59.720 --> 09:05.640]  tell people exactly what I did to do that you just returned from Europe I was lecturing in
[09:05.640 --> 09:14.880]  Paris and I was lecturing to a group of people who were very interested in radiation
[09:14.880 --> 09:25.200]  toxicity exposure and how to detoxify it clean your body up and to also implement a radiation
[09:25.200 --> 09:33.920]  diet to an anti-radiation diet to help the body to release it on a regular basis so so it is
[09:33.920 --> 09:38.600]  possible to minimize the effects of it a lot of people are not aware of that they they assume
[09:38.600 --> 09:46.320]  that once you've contacted it you're in trouble right well you know the whole thing is you can
[09:46.320 --> 09:57.080]  help to eliminate it and I have created a regime to do that you know however we also need to know
[09:57.080 --> 10:06.760]  very important things about radiation from the time that you are ingested or breathe it it has
[10:06.760 --> 10:14.440]  a 38 year shelf life in your body in other words for 38 years afterwards you could get cancer from
[10:14.440 --> 10:24.040]  it so if you don't do anything so the point is we want to do something we want to do whatever we
[10:24.040 --> 10:33.120]  tend to minimize this because this is happening right now from Fukushima how serious do the people
[10:33.120 --> 10:39.040]  that you spoke with how serious is it I perceive it's it's quite serious and if reactor number four
[10:39.040 --> 10:44.840]  is is damaged again and there's another release it's going to just ratchet up exponentially
[10:44.840 --> 10:51.760]  what are people saying that everyone that lives in Japan should move off off the island should
[10:51.760 --> 10:59.600]  move off of Japan out as soon as possible I have patients in Japan who call me and tell me that the
[10:59.600 --> 11:09.440]  government says it's okay yet yet in California we found in August and we just had a release this
[11:09.440 --> 11:16.600]  the last week that there were 15 bluefin tuna samples off of the coast of California near
[11:16.600 --> 11:26.440]  San Diego which absolutely had Fukushima nuclear radiation in it and so we also want to take a
[11:26.440 --> 11:33.600]  look at the fact that cesium remains dispersed throughout the water column from the surface to
[11:33.600 --> 11:41.600]  the ocean floor okay and there's an article on route writers from that and then one of the top
[11:41.600 --> 11:49.600]  cancer doctors says it's irresponsible to say that cesium in California bluefin tuna is nothing to
[11:49.600 --> 11:56.800]  worry about because the media tries to put a spin no offense on this that it's okay if it has
[11:56.800 --> 12:04.560]  nuclear radiation in it but it's not okay because it's eaten by people and it takes a long time for
[12:04.560 --> 12:12.160]  the truth to come out always yeah and so people have been eating tuna for the last half a year
[12:12.160 --> 12:20.080]  you probably have been eating some with cesium in it now how can this radiation be detected in
[12:20.080 --> 12:28.000]  food or can it it can it can you can get a radiation detector to a little portable one
[12:28.000 --> 12:39.440]  that people can look for to test the food themselves but they are now testing food off
[12:39.440 --> 12:47.680]  the coast of California and also Alaska anything up on the western side I would not eat any fish
[12:47.680 --> 12:54.720]  from the ocean from the western side of the United States one of those tuna made a two round
[12:54.720 --> 13:03.160]  trips to Japan and back to the US in 600 days that's a lot of swimming and somebody has suggested
[13:03.160 --> 13:07.680]  that well this radiation thing might not be such a bad bad thing after all because it may
[13:07.680 --> 13:14.960]  actually save the bluefin tuna right it's like okay right I did read that it may save the bluefin
[13:14.960 --> 13:24.240]  tuna but at what cost if people are eating it and don't eat the warnings and aren't aware you know
[13:24.240 --> 13:29.680]  and don't listen to shows like this I mean you're not going to hear this on CNN you're not going to
[13:29.680 --> 13:35.360]  hear a lot of this on different you know on a consistent basis you may hear little ramblings
[13:35.360 --> 13:42.640]  of it here and there but there needs to be some major broadcasts on this topic let me just tell
[13:42.640 --> 13:54.160]  you that the meat of six cows were fed radioactive straw from Japan and that reached throughout
[13:54.160 --> 14:01.200]  Japan and all of that this cow meat was has radiation in it and so they've announced this
[14:01.200 --> 14:08.720]  and that it was a very three to six times the allowable level of cesium there should be no
[14:08.720 --> 14:17.200]  allowable level of cesium in our food yeah that seems like a huge oxymoron acceptable levels of
[14:17.200 --> 14:24.480]  radioactive toxicity well now these fish that were were tested the first reports that we heard
[14:24.480 --> 14:31.440]  with the was that the levels of cesium were 10 times higher than those measured last year and
[14:31.440 --> 14:40.080]  yet but what are we measuring this against in other words no cesium in the food can be good
[14:40.080 --> 14:47.280]  cesium right but has anyone established the line I think they're trying to establish the line or
[14:47.280 --> 14:53.280]  they have established a certain line that over a certain amount is no good but but what what
[14:53.280 --> 15:02.080]  research do they have to back up that even that small amount okay is is acceptable what
[15:02.080 --> 15:07.600]  research I haven't seen any research that says that a small amount of cesium in your food
[15:08.480 --> 15:15.520]  is not going to be harmful I have never seen research like that and so we have this in our
[15:15.520 --> 15:24.960]  fish now but what people don't realize is that no one's testing the grass fed animals that are
[15:24.960 --> 15:32.000]  butchered and that we're eating okay no one's testing that because it's on the grass on grass
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.760]  fed animals it's in the feed it's in our food supply and so we need to take action and take
[15:37.760 --> 15:44.640]  care of ourselves that's the most important thing right now and we have to also look at side effects
[15:44.640 --> 15:52.560]  what are the side effects of eating or being exposed to radiation and we will have a spike
[15:52.560 --> 16:00.320]  in infant death rates and an increase in cancer um an increase in chronic degenerative diseases
[16:00.320 --> 16:07.040]  premature deaths and lifelong crippling disabilities um that's just some of them
[16:07.040 --> 16:16.720]  the 14 000 extra extra they call them extra deaths uh children ages one and younger have
[16:16.720 --> 16:23.440]  already occurred and that's old news now that's that's almost a year old they're not giving us
[16:23.440 --> 16:31.600]  updates on that but my patients who live there and that I talked to the Skype um are not being given
[16:31.600 --> 16:40.800]  any kind of um uh they're not being given the truth and so I would I suggest that they look into
[16:40.800 --> 16:48.960]  moving to another country because if your government doesn't protect you and take care of you then it's
[16:48.960 --> 16:57.040]  time to uh take a trip and find somebody else so find another place to live now as a couple of
[16:57.040 --> 17:01.840]  grown-ups talking here on uh on national radio we understand that the words that are coming out of
[17:01.840 --> 17:08.240]  our mouths are actually quite serious quite dramatic and quite alarming to a lot of people
[17:09.280 --> 17:15.600]  uh but there's been a recent uh a film he's and he's an old warhorse uh general stubblebine stubblebine
[17:16.400 --> 17:22.320]  who says that if this fourth reactor goes the entire northern hemisphere is at risk right
[17:22.320 --> 17:30.080]  and that is the truth and people need to do something now when I was uh in France
[17:30.880 --> 17:37.680]  there was an article um and I found out that this was true when I went to to France
[17:38.240 --> 17:46.880]  is just to back up everything is that there the nuclear um the part of the government that is
[17:46.880 --> 17:58.960]  the nuclear department um there is um a they have agreed to take all of the spent fuel rods
[17:58.960 --> 18:06.640]  from Japan and reprocess them in France and they didn't mention how they would get it there but I'm
[18:06.640 --> 18:14.400]  assuming they would go in some kind of a vessel on the ocean to get them there and I just think the
[18:14.400 --> 18:21.040]  whole thing is very suspect and there are things happening that we don't even know about they're
[18:21.040 --> 18:26.720]  not telling us everything like what's going to happen what are they they're doing nothing that
[18:26.720 --> 18:37.280]  I'm aware of and I look at this several times a day to entomb this um nuclear plant and they say
[18:37.280 --> 18:46.320]  they can't entomb it but there has to be something they can do to um to you know completely shut it
[18:46.320 --> 18:52.000]  down and get rid of it I mean you're always going to have the effect of it but in Chernobyl they
[18:52.000 --> 18:58.160]  entombed it we're going to have to take a break here in just a minute but um I'm curious why
[18:58.160 --> 19:06.720]  there isn't a huge flotilla made up of of personnel from countries all over the world
[19:07.760 --> 19:13.840]  who have come to Japan's aid in some way to either dump concrete on it it's too hot to
[19:13.840 --> 19:21.520]  dump concrete on it they say that the number four is so hot it'll take 10 years before it
[19:21.520 --> 19:27.200]  cools off enough to even be able to crack the lid and take a look at it so I'll tell you what when
[19:27.200 --> 19:32.800]  we um we have we have to take these breaks our beloved sponsors and so forth but uh when we
[19:32.800 --> 19:40.320]  return let's uh let's talk about what appears to be either denial apathy or impotence on behalf
[19:40.320 --> 19:48.000]  of the world community in addressing the escalating but on the down low Fukushima disaster we'll be
[19:48.000 --> 20:00.240]  back with Dr. Teresa Dayo in a moment

[24:06.960 --> 24:17.360]  because there's a war on for your mind well that's for sure I can't think of a better name for the
[24:17.360 --> 24:24.480]  site than the info wars because it is an information war once you put the disinformation in the loop
[24:24.480 --> 24:30.480]  now you've really got yourself a brouhaha we're speaking with Dr. Teresa Dale about the Fukushima
[24:30.480 --> 24:37.760]  disaster and some countermeasures that can be taken for it Dr. Dale I presume this could happen
[24:37.760 --> 24:44.480]  here pretty easily considering the most of our plants are pretty safe but we are all it takes
[24:44.480 --> 24:50.640]  is a an earthquake that nobody expected and we've got the same situation here well we have a very
[24:50.640 --> 25:00.640]  similar situation here and we need to understand that there are a couple of um uh nuclear plants the
[25:00.640 --> 25:07.200]  one in san anofri is built right on a fault line now I don't know who the genius was who decided to
[25:07.200 --> 25:14.640]  do that but it's built right on a fault line and they do have releases of radiation from it because
[25:14.640 --> 25:21.840]  I have patients that live in the community not too far from it and they have little warning
[25:23.600 --> 25:31.040]  audio audio warning devices that are on top of poles so if there is a radiation release that
[25:31.840 --> 25:38.560]  there's a warning that goes off but what can you do when when they release it so I believe that
[25:38.560 --> 25:45.440]  Germany and other some other countries uh have it more together because they have decided to
[25:45.440 --> 25:58.640]  completely eliminate nuclear radiation um by the uh uh 2020 2021 um that they should be free of it
[25:58.640 --> 26:06.480]  and using wind power and solar power so this is what we need to start looking at in the United States
[26:06.480 --> 26:13.120]  because all of our nuclear plants are not safe they're and and just just because they tell us
[26:13.120 --> 26:19.200]  they're safe doesn't mean it's true um one of the things I wanted to bring up at this point
[26:20.160 --> 26:29.280]  was there is a physicist um called Dr. Mitio Katku from uh University of New York
[26:29.280 --> 26:39.360]  and he claims and I think he's the most accurate is that Fukushima is 25 to 30 times
[26:39.920 --> 26:48.000]  of what your noble was as and uh that it is very very dangerous because it's continuing
[26:48.640 --> 26:55.520]  it hasn't stopped and we are getting exposed to this on a daily basis yeah if you look at the uh at
[26:55.520 --> 27:02.880]  the uh wonder map with a double with a uh with a u wonder wonder map you see the wind patterns
[27:02.880 --> 27:07.360]  that it's mostly falling well obviously the fish have it there are being caught off the
[27:07.360 --> 27:15.840]  coast california down around uh san diego but I according to this chart it's mostly the pacific
[27:15.840 --> 27:23.440]  northwest oregon washington state uh is it coming any farther south and that according to the the
[27:23.440 --> 27:28.400]  reports of of any effects that people are experiencing experiencing in california in fact I guess
[27:28.400 --> 27:34.400]  my question is how far south is this coming and are you beginning to see patients who are having
[27:34.400 --> 27:43.520]  symptoms yes well that's an excellent question there is a full-time radiation monitors um an
[27:43.520 --> 27:52.160]  environmental journalist who is monitoring it in Santa Monica and says it's uh 10 20 30 times in
[27:52.160 --> 27:57.840]  different areas higher than it's ever been now and it's increasing and that's in Santa Monica
[27:57.840 --> 28:07.840]  california which is very close to LA just north of LA and um it is all over california I can tell
[28:07.840 --> 28:14.960]  you that in seattle washington residents were actually breathing uh five to ten hot particles
[28:14.960 --> 28:25.120]  per day last year and I suspect it's the same now since it hasn't stopped yet and so therefore we
[28:25.120 --> 28:33.840]  all need to start learning about food and what to eat and how to clean it and um to learn protocols
[28:33.840 --> 28:39.280]  that we can have a healthier life what not to eat what to eat and perhaps by little radiation
[28:39.280 --> 28:47.840]  monitor so we can test our food the little portable one yes indeed well um now you treat
[28:48.560 --> 28:54.800]  you you treat the the the patients you do not actually provide this equipment am I understanding
[28:54.800 --> 29:00.560]  this correctly I don't sell the equipment no but they can find it on various websites
[29:00.560 --> 29:10.720]  um on the internet so they can um you know check it out and it's uh almost palm size and um you
[29:10.720 --> 29:17.520]  know so this would be I think a very smart decision to invest a little bit of money in
[29:17.520 --> 29:24.880]  something to help you for a very long time and when I work with with clients with patients
[29:24.880 --> 29:34.880]  it is to detoxify them to cleanse them and to um assess their current health situation so that
[29:36.080 --> 29:42.800]  we can um you know maybe save them how to say well yes all right we'll be back with Dr. Teresa
[29:42.800 --> 29:45.840]  Dale this is the alex jones show john welles sitting down we'll be back
[29:45.840 --> 29:56.320]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:47.680 --> 33:54.800]  in the movie version this is a smoother this is a smoother version of the the good the bad the ugly
[33:54.800 --> 33:58.960]  and isn't that what we're talking about isn't that what the hokey pokey is now what it's all
[33:58.960 --> 34:04.880]  about it's the good the bad and the ugly dr. Teresa Dailis with us her website address is
[34:04.880 --> 34:14.640]  wellnesscenter.net and she is she is amazing uh i don't want to use any of those nsa keywords

[34:27.280 --> 34:33.280]  this is a true Teresa you're a true doctor in my opinion you are a um you are a real healer
[34:33.280 --> 34:39.840]  you are not a pill pusher you are not a product a seller you are a healer of fellow human beings
[34:39.840 --> 34:50.960]  and and really i i applaud and salute you um now on the info wars store site thyrosafe and
[34:50.960 --> 34:57.760]  modifilum is available and then um this is not an infomercial for me but i've been doing this for
[34:57.760 --> 35:03.920]  a while and i have not promoted it much but i have a website called caravan2midnight.com
[35:03.920 --> 35:12.640]  caravan2midnight.com and um we met geiger counters available for people i carry one with me and i
[35:12.640 --> 35:18.320]  carried into the grocery store so other than that doctor what uh what can we do they're not testing
[35:18.320 --> 35:24.000]  the grass i take it they're not testing the meat but they are testing we're mostly as far as the
[35:24.000 --> 35:29.440]  good bad or the ugly we're mostly talking about the bad and the ugly right yeah and i am not an
[35:29.440 --> 35:34.160]  alarmist but everybody really needs to perk up their ears and listen to this and then i'm going
[35:34.160 --> 35:40.240]  to give them my recommendations for what to do listen to this after 25 years
[35:42.640 --> 35:49.360]  after Chernobyl 25 years after Chernobyl catastrophe happened there are over one million
[35:49.360 --> 35:59.600]  deaths documented from it and there are over eight million disabilities and that number keeps growing
[35:59.600 --> 36:10.480]  because of the half-life of cesium strontium and plutonium and uranium so the mortality rate
[36:10.480 --> 36:19.760]  projections continued to grow from 25 years ago from Chernobyl and this is 25 to 30 percent worse
[36:19.760 --> 36:26.320]  than Chernobyl everybody's ears need to be perking up get your pen out write down these things
[36:26.320 --> 36:33.760]  that john's telling you and i'm going to include some things about the diet that is so very important
[36:33.760 --> 36:38.080]  well please do that and i'm just going to sit quietly and i will i will let you know i'm still
[36:38.080 --> 36:44.000]  here but tell them everything you want to tell them okay first of all you need to wash your your
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.680]  plants and your vegetables and eat a plant-based based diet you want you want to wash them very
[36:49.680 --> 36:58.480]  carefully you can put them in a sink of water and you can either get an ozone generator and stick
[36:58.480 --> 37:07.760]  an ozone tube in the water and ozonate it or you can use 35 percent food grade hydrogen peroxide
[37:07.760 --> 37:16.400]  in a sink full of water and take a quarter of a teaspoon or half a teaspoon no more than that
[37:16.400 --> 37:23.120]  in the water swish it around be careful you can burn your fingers with it it's very very powerful
[37:23.120 --> 37:30.720]  and it will wash the vegetables clean the vegetables and then you want to give them a clean rinse
[37:30.720 --> 37:38.320]  after that okay to wash everything off of it you want to do dietary plant fibers because
[37:38.320 --> 37:46.000]  these are sulfur containing anti-oxidase contained sulfur uh sulfur containing antioxidant okay
[37:46.000 --> 37:52.800]  they're found in cruciferous um vegetables like broccoli and cow and cabbage along with
[37:52.800 --> 37:58.720]  the pectin and fruit are very very good now green tea is very good for you except if it
[37:58.720 --> 38:07.600]  comes from japan you must not buy anything from japan okay some pasta macrobiotic pasta can be from
[38:07.600 --> 38:15.520]  japan it's on the wheat in japan you don't want to buy any foods from japan read the label very
[38:15.520 --> 38:23.280]  carefully okay and so we also want to look at green tea where it's from matcha tea is from
[38:23.280 --> 38:29.440]  japan many different things ginseng a lot of it is grown in japan but some of it is in china
[38:30.560 --> 38:37.280]  we want to eat as many vegetables as possible make sure when you have leafy vegetables that those
[38:37.280 --> 38:43.360]  are well washed and i would wear rubber gloves when you're doing the hydrogen peroxide in it and
[38:43.360 --> 38:51.280]  make sure that you don't burn your skin um also there is wait there are radiation formulas that
[38:51.280 --> 38:59.360]  i've created one that helped me to detoxify the radiation uh it's just called homeopathic
[38:59.360 --> 39:07.760]  radiation and it comes in a kit with biologically available iodine it's on my website um at natural
[39:07.760 --> 39:16.560]  healing pro dot com and the other one that's very good is ocean meds and this helps your thyroid
[39:16.560 --> 39:27.440]  we the radiation homeopathic the biological iodine that i've created work to help the thyroid the
[39:27.440 --> 39:35.520]  lungs and the whole body to protect it to detoxify it the homeopathic radiation works on a cellular
[39:35.520 --> 39:43.680]  level to neutralize radiation in your body it's the only way that i think that you will have
[39:43.680 --> 39:50.160]  100 success but you also need to take the iodine to protect the thyroid as well
[39:50.960 --> 39:57.520]  so we need to stick to a plant-based diet i wouldn't need animal products i wouldn't eat beef
[39:57.520 --> 40:03.760]  i wouldn't because they're eating the grass and um they're eating feed and the radiation could be
[40:03.760 --> 40:11.760]  in the feed i mean it's it's really a big issue that we need to pay much more attention to if we
[40:11.760 --> 40:18.160]  want to help humanity and help america to stay safe now tell tell me your website again natural
[40:18.160 --> 40:24.400]  human natural healing pro dot com oh natural healing pro okay good
[40:24.400 --> 40:30.640]  natural healing pro dot com and you know people need to be aware of the symptoms of ionizing
[40:30.640 --> 40:38.960]  radiation exposure i gave some a little bit earlier but many symptoms of cancer to infertility
[40:38.960 --> 40:47.840]  can happen um 28 years after exposure and it also depends on how long you're exposed to it
[40:47.840 --> 40:56.320]  and the dosage that you ingest it or you breathe in you can get tumors hair loss thyroid issues
[40:56.320 --> 41:03.360]  let's see nausea fatigue diarrhea dehydration destruction of the intestinal lining and of
[41:03.360 --> 41:10.720]  course there's a possibility for central nervous system damage so we need to look at all of these
[41:10.720 --> 41:20.960]  possibilities and not become an alarmist but just become an activist for your own life because
[41:20.960 --> 41:29.280]  that's what it's coming down to so real-time threat of radiation contamination to food supplies
[41:29.280 --> 41:38.720]  is prompting more testing in japan that's why they're catching the the ground beef and the meat
[41:38.720 --> 41:47.040]  that uh where the cows were eating uh hay that was had radiation all over it and around the world
[41:47.040 --> 41:53.520]  a lot of people are testing for it um in certain areas that are more progressive in the united
[41:53.520 --> 42:00.640]  states like california we're doing a lot of testing for it now first it was germany and now
[42:00.640 --> 42:06.880]  it's switch when these are the two countries that have decided to phase out nuclear nuclear energy
[42:06.880 --> 42:13.840]  completely isn't that great yeah and who is the genius who decided that uh japan needed i heard of
[42:13.840 --> 42:21.280]  i heard 55 but certainly 50 all 50 nuclear power plants are currently shut down in japan the people
[42:21.280 --> 42:25.200]  there do not want them turned back on but who's the genius that decided to build that many nuclear
[42:25.200 --> 42:32.800]  power plants on on a on on a fault line i mean in an area that's notorious for major earthquakes
[42:33.520 --> 42:37.360]  it was some genius uh that has a huge bank account yes
[42:39.440 --> 42:44.800]  it's that lie it's all about money this is all about money and that's what this is being
[42:44.800 --> 42:52.320]  reduced to and it's affecting our health so um you know this is something we need to take action
[42:52.320 --> 42:57.200]  and protect ourselves okay i don't want to confuse anybody i just want to make sure that
[42:57.200 --> 43:04.640]  they have your website correctly it's natural healing pro yes yes all right good all right
[43:04.640 --> 43:10.960]  well i've got this little secret service style uh headset earpiece here and it's they're just not
[43:10.960 --> 43:16.160]  as cool as they look in the movies they're really natural healing pro dot com and if you want just
[43:16.880 --> 43:21.920]  information then go to wellnesscenter.net i have two websites but if you want to learn
[43:23.040 --> 43:28.960]  more about the homeopathic radiation and the iodine you can go to natural healing pro dot com
[43:29.840 --> 43:35.120]  you know the thing that uh when we were kids we thought okay there were nuclear bombs went off in
[43:35.120 --> 43:39.200]  japan back in world war two and then the fallout came down and first there was the heat and the
[43:39.200 --> 43:42.640]  immediate destruction and the fallout came down and people got sick and and now look
[43:43.200 --> 43:47.680]  Hiroshima and Nagasaki are both thriving cities again great place to party looks like according
[43:47.680 --> 43:54.800]  to the pictures but what is difficult for people to get their minds around is that the stuff spreads
[43:54.800 --> 43:59.280]  it gets everywhere is there anything to indicate now i know you're in california but is there a
[44:00.000 --> 44:05.680]  is there any anything to indicate that it's moving toward the center of the country i've been monitoring
[44:05.680 --> 44:10.080]  radiation levels myself and i don't see anything above background where i am in the southwest
[44:11.040 --> 44:17.680]  but i think that it's mostly on the western part of the united states and as the
[44:18.480 --> 44:24.640]  wherever the jet streams go is going to be the heaviest supply the heaviest amount of it
[44:24.640 --> 44:34.400]  landing i think that the center of the country is probably the safest i think also you're looking
[44:34.400 --> 44:43.280]  at the if you're looking at the east coast they have not i haven't seen any reports that they have
[44:43.280 --> 44:50.960]  any measurable increase over normal and so they the thing that really bothers me is they've created
[44:50.960 --> 44:56.560]  normal they've created you know this is a normal amount of radiation well there is no normal
[44:56.560 --> 45:07.440]  amount of radiation oh yes so that is really they make their own rules to try because of money
[45:07.440 --> 45:17.440]  because they don't want to spread fear and because they don't realize that people need to exercise
[45:17.440 --> 45:22.720]  their voice and communicate and i think that's what they're afraid of is that people's voice
[45:22.720 --> 45:30.240]  they're going to start getting in touch with their voice and start expressing it and so i
[45:30.240 --> 45:35.520]  don't think they want that to happen and i think everybody needs to turn into an activist for your
[45:35.520 --> 45:41.360]  own healing i understand that there are a hundred and a hundred and twenty five million people in
[45:41.360 --> 45:45.520]  japan i understand there have been some discussions as to whether or not it might not it might be
[45:45.520 --> 45:52.000]  necessary to evacuate the entire country let alone just tokyo creating an enormous humanitarian
[45:52.000 --> 45:57.600]  disaster where would all if such a thing were to happen where would they go are we just dealing
[45:57.600 --> 46:05.920]  with a colossal unknown with a horrific potential well i think it is a catastrophe that has never
[46:05.920 --> 46:13.280]  been anything like this has ever been seen because it's still happening and i think that
[46:13.280 --> 46:20.960]  people should leave the island immediately leave japan go to another country and they're not all
[46:20.960 --> 46:25.840]  going to go to one country they're going to go to different places you know and i think we need to
[46:25.840 --> 46:33.200]  look at taking people in and what these what what's going to happen to all these people and you know
[46:33.200 --> 46:41.280]  the most amazing thing that i heard which was shocking was that i was in the store talking
[46:41.280 --> 46:47.520]  to somebody about their their green tea and i said you know your green tea comes from japan
[46:47.520 --> 46:52.960]  and they said oh but the reports are that it comes from the other side of japan and there's no
[46:52.960 --> 46:59.920]  radiation there and i'm thinking to myself i said no that is not true whoever is telling you that
[46:59.920 --> 47:08.320]  is telling you that to the you buy the product you see good grief you know it's just not necessarily
[47:08.320 --> 47:14.800]  what you say it's just how many people you can say it to isn't it it's exactly the truth you know
[47:14.800 --> 47:22.320]  there are three major types of ionizing radiation they're alpha particles beta particles and gamma
[47:22.320 --> 47:33.040]  rays and we need to understand about these these three types and also that the exposure to uranium
[47:33.040 --> 47:42.640]  and even drinking water may result in a kidney failure okay some people who drink water containing
[47:42.640 --> 47:52.720]  alpha emitters such as uranium in excess over their conjured up contamination level over many years
[47:52.720 --> 48:00.480]  have an increase in getting cancer kidney cancer so we need to look that it's in the water supply
[48:00.480 --> 48:04.720]  and that's why i brought that up we need to look that it's in many different things now
[48:05.440 --> 48:10.320]  what about water let's talk about water with something we drink all the time we buy bottled
[48:10.320 --> 48:20.800]  water in plastic that contains this phenol a but now what about the spring okay indeed yeah so we
[48:20.800 --> 48:28.320]  need to look at um what kind of a filter is going to get the radiation get the radiation out and i
[48:28.320 --> 48:37.680]  believe that uh reversed osmosis may do a very good job at that albeit i'm not a hundred percent
[48:37.680 --> 48:45.200]  convinced i am told by experts that it should help to get the radiation out yes the water
[48:45.200 --> 48:50.560]  supplies in um in certain parts of the country particularly central texas uh there's radium
[48:50.560 --> 48:56.080]  there and they have actually the water just flowing through the water pipes has made the
[48:56.080 --> 49:00.800]  pipes radioactive of this technician was saying yeah when it hits a six i turn away from it's like a six
[49:00.800 --> 49:09.520]  a six is really pretty high pal so you are having it in texas oh absolutely and the environmental
[49:09.520 --> 49:15.120]  quality board's been covering it up for years years and years and it's still a houston television
[49:15.120 --> 49:20.800]  station um channel 11 down there did a story it's a year old but i don't see any additional stories
[49:20.800 --> 49:28.480]  on it and the water quality has not improved and the radiation has not been removed so it's just
[49:28.480 --> 49:33.840]  the same thing again it's if it's not uh if it's not top of mind if it's not being talked about if
[49:33.840 --> 49:38.640]  it's not on the news if it's uh so many people still believe well if it's not on television
[49:38.640 --> 49:44.640]  you know from a reliable network source then it must not be true must not be important must not
[49:44.640 --> 49:52.720]  be worth our attention which is why alex jones has his uh his organization and uh coast to coast
[49:52.720 --> 49:57.840]  we have our organization that's why we work so closely together to try to get the uh the word
[49:57.840 --> 50:04.640]  out because the mainstream media is not doing it and that's the truth and i can tell you something
[50:04.640 --> 50:11.040]  that that you can see the difference when i was um exposed to chernobyl when it blew up
[50:11.040 --> 50:16.160]  they didn't announce it for two weeks is it all only two weeks yeah because they didn't want to
[50:16.160 --> 50:21.360]  hurt the tourist trade in the south of france and that's why all these millions of people died
[50:21.360 --> 50:27.360]  it's because of money so i couldn't get any reports on why i was sick or what was going on i didn't
[50:27.360 --> 50:33.360]  even know why i was sick and i went to i have family in switzerland so i went to switzerland
[50:33.360 --> 50:40.640]  and it's the only country every 15 minutes every 15 minutes under basic news they announced

[55:36.720 --> 55:42.800]  some planets including earth and people think oh fukushima isn't going to get to me because
[55:42.800 --> 55:49.840]  i'm in this state well it's going to get all over and you know the polar jet stream for example
[55:49.840 --> 55:57.440]  can travel at speeds greater than a hundred miles per hour yes okay so um we have a faster
[55:57.440 --> 56:02.720]  jet streams we have slower air currents and we need to understand that it's all over the
[56:02.720 --> 56:11.280]  nine states that you're listening to this it's there it's in rainwater okay it's in um our

[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:18.720]  folks my voice basically was gone and that's why it sounded like this but i think thank god it is

[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:30.000]  cornucopia of news from the latest on bilgerberg what we learned uh to the latest unfolding control
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.920]  grid with the globalist conquering the u.s amazing nanny state police state developments i've just
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:41.680]  got a big report coming up for people in this hour and then i know coming up uh in the third hour
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.720]  you're going to be exposing just how serious the violation of our fourth amendment is by the good
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:53.840]  old national security agency absolutely it just keeps on rolling doesn't it and uh say they don't
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:02:02.080]  think very much of the uh the proletariat do they those bilbergs no they don't in fact uh the
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:07.280]  london guardian reporter was able to go in before they kicked everybody out last week on thursday i
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.880]  was kicked out when i showed up wednesday morning my crew was kicked out i tried to send them in
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.600]  first tuesday night when we got there but they knew who we were and threw us out but other media was
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.000]  able to get in before they closed the hotel and charlie skelton and others so there's in fact the
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.520]  article we wrote yesterday linking to the guardian actually had uh you know other journalists quoted
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:32.400]  as well that confirmed uh that the hotel staff was rooting quote for alex jones and the well
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:37.840]  thousands of protesters over the five days four and a half days and that the bilbergs were walking
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:43.040]  around custing and saying they wanted is dead wanted to murder ron paul wanted to blow him up
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.800]  in an airplane uh calling us cockroaches so that's been confirmed not just by jim tucker source but
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.760]  charlie skelton london guardian uh and other sources that we talked to they didn't hear the kill
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:59.200]  ron paul part my sources needed that skelton's just that we were scum and trash and cockroaches
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:06.960]  so we were definitely getting to them we had at one point seven bullhorns going simultaneously
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:13.840]  daisy chained and and and many others down the street encircling the place so loud it was it was
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:20.080]  shaking the windows we could see them shaking uh kissinger came out with his mouth hanging open
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.480]  because the one area of the big conference center that sticks out the closest to the road most areas
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.840]  are 200 300 yards away it's a big big piece of property but the one big conference wing
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.160]  is the wing that sticks out by the road and they put up big fences and black mats but it didn't
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:40.800]  stop it and uh the protesters kind of ripped down the uh the black mat so we could bullhorn
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.080]  right into them and it was it was amazing bill berg is movie angry we disrupted their criminal
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.560]  activities their logan act violation but more importantly forced the mainstream corporate
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:56.160]  globalist media to cover it this is a big victory and again i i gotta give credit because george
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.080]  norry was the first i said eight years ago on the show it's actually nine years ago he first
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:07.120]  interviewed me about bohemian grove skull and bones and bill berg and so he was the first big mega
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:11.680]  program that could be seen as quote mainstream in the in the sense of you know 500 plus stations
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:16.720]  to cover it then drudge help break it drudge report dot com and now it's in the washington
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.840]  times london guardian uh hundreds of other publications washington post the shadow government

[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:35.280]  from coast to coast am sitting in alex's chair for the day delighted to actually interview alex
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:41.840]  jones on his own show this is i mean who to thunk it who to thought something like this was even
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:48.000]  possible alex i got a question has been dogging me for years and it is this is it just that your
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:55.280]  you get the intel on where the these meetings take place and then the people come and then the
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:02.880]  protests begin because i'm thinking why are they not up in some mountain retreat with army guys all
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:08.960]  over the place keeping them out is it just uh i mean is this just another arrogant gesture on
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:15.040]  their part that they they're sort of uh underground yet above ground that they do it in a in a hotel
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:23.520]  where in italy sure i mean in italy and in other areas where they've had it they do have them up
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.920]  on mountain retreats and have the army out but but still everybody basically knows it's there
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:32.960]  and then there's complaints by the citizens and the governments that all these foreign
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:41.360]  interest are meeting so in the past they like to meet in conference type hotels that do have land
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.320]  around them and then just have the local police and their own private security out in the past
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:52.880]  it was only if you go back just five six years ago it might be a dozen reporters or so uh when i
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:58.400]  first called for people to protest it up in canada in 2006 the first time i physically went up and
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:08.000]  covered it for 17 years there was probably only a maximum of 30 protesters there have been some
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.880]  events in europe in the last few years where there were over a thousand they were close to a
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:19.760]  thousand at one time last year in switzerland and st mortz where they actually shoot uh many of the
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:25.760]  james bond swiss outmovies and it was the highest hotel in the area already in the high mountains
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:31.200]  with a big mountain peak to the back of it uh out on a a a jut of land and then they even
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:36.560]  shut the road down uh in front of it but that's still still they were so arrogant i think it's
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.840]  both you know the things you said they they they had armored cars but you basically take them to
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:48.000]  the top of the mountain and then they walked down for exercise a bunch of belterberg members
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.080]  thinking we wouldn't notice them or knew who they were like we were too ignorant to be informed and
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:57.920]  know who the actual shadow masters are and and and those confrontations are online so i i think
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:04.240]  it's a little bit of both well how bad is it how far down the road is their plan how close are they
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:10.080]  to to fulfilling it and um and and how big a weed have we shoved in their ears
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.880]  to make this a victory because sure i mean this is a big victory because over the four
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.720]  and a half five days that belterberg was taking place from from thursday through sunday
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.600]  day there was conservatively more than 2000 people that came out and protested generally
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:29.360]  people can only come for today they all had jobs families sure because you wouldn't really see a
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:35.520]  lot of the same people the next day that you've seen the day before and we had over 600 700 800
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:41.360]  at one time on friday and saturday another 500 or so on sunday and people would come spend a
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:47.280]  few hours and then leave some people would travel 500 600 miles of places like pennsylvania
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.760]  west virginia just to come and protest a few hours some people came in their work vehicles
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.480]  and then had to turn around and go so it was really amazing but the big victory here is the
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:01.840]  washington post has attended because the publishers of it were the first media ever let in in 54
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:09.680]  in usherbeck holand where they first met and they showed up uh the washington post showed up and
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:14.560]  had their own reporter thrown off and they kind of wrote a whitewash about it but the point is
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:18.960]  that article that then ended up in hundreds of newspapers that carried the washington post
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:25.680]  columns and so suddenly all the people that were told we were crazy this didn't exist well now
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:31.760]  they're going wait well it is real and as i said drudgereport.com five six years ago started
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:36.560]  helping break the electronic berlin wall coast to coast a and with george norry nine years ago
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:42.480]  time just flies first time he interviewed me back in 2003 it was on bill de bergs column bones
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:48.000]  bohemian grove that helped break it now the washington times london guardian they did serious
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  reports on it and admitted that there have been logon act violations of the past and things
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:56.720]  this is really amazing what's happening it's very very exciting and they're in there discussing
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.320]  government policy there's lots of little break-off meetings where they go and make
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:06.240]  sweetheart deals with corporations and government elected representatives it's extremely dangerous
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:11.920]  what's happening at bill bergen their agenda is moving forward but it's in trouble and it's being
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:18.640]  identified so right now humanity is awakening but we're in a lot of trouble but at least people
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:25.120]  are starting to wake up a little bit anything specific anything encroaching that we're about
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:32.640]  to feel nudging us in the not too distant future yes the biggest thing is that last year at bill
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:38.880]  de berg it was mainly it people that were invited the head of google's the facebook people all of them
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.560]  and the head of the nsa last year and this year the head of the european
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:54.160]  spy agency what info poll nine was then they're going back years but also they're this year so
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:00.880]  this is all about spying and the globalists think that their technocracy of spying and drones and
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:09.360]  ground robots and combat robots and and robot cars and biometric face scanning and surveillance
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:16.080]  blimps and license plate rears they believe that this new national security state basically
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:20.960]  turning the whole country into a giant airport style security with tsa everywhere checkpoints at
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.000]  malls highways it's all happening now it's not just oh oh hey it's coming this is their plan
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.440]  it's now happening they want this rolled out fast and that's actually some of the news i've got for
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:37.040]  you coming up after the break but they believe the technocracy is going to save them they know the
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:42.000]  military is going to say no to confiscating guns so they're just going to 30 000 drones we pay for
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:49.040]  to be used against us weaponized all being announced they know uh that uh people are waking up and
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:54.080]  going back to barter and and and back to the land so they're they're erecting the homeland
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:15:02.480]  security rural council now showing up with the u.s army in plain clothes backing local feds
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:09.440]  to take your property to raise taxes to give you $2,000 a day fines for dust in your barn
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:15.680]  just total harassment total stylistic you know telling the ukrainian kulaks they couldn't have
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:21.600]  their farms anymore and starving you know 15 million uh uh people there in eastern europe
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:27.360]  uh in just a few years this is the plan i mean this is diabolical they want to totally break
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:33.360]  the back of the american people this is total war and again our government's gone you still
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.760]  have military people that are good people that don't understand this but they've told us that the
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:43.600]  un and nato now run our military nato is just an narcotics trafficking organization caught hundreds
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:49.840]  of times doing it it's another globalist power system and now our congress has been told they
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:54.960]  pull the shots and now the air force has got 10 000 drones they're getting another 10 000 on top of
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:01.520]  that uh they're operating domestically the epa says yeah we're watching farmers uh the runoff
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:07.120]  into your creeks we're using spy satellites on you that's in the news today from info wars.com from
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:13.520]  epa announcements and it's also linked up on drudge so all of this is really in everyone's face
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:19.520]  they're announcing giant derogables to fly around 100 000 feet surveilling us and going oh guess what
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:25.520]  they're already in the skies as i told folks a decade ago so much of this was already declassified
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:31.920]  now they're throwing it in everyone's face so it's a giant arms race by the global bankers that have
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:38.480]  hijacked our country and they'll say give your rights up for china will get you give your rights
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:44.160]  up or russia will get you give your rights up or al qaeda will get you but all the real architecture
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:51.040]  of the police state is targeted at a guy with a john deer hat somebody who could skin a buck
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:56.400]  and run a trot line people that have their own property it's all a global corporate takeover
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:02.400]  who's who have actually made deals with russia and deals with china and on the surface they act
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.240]  like they're fighting with each other and there is some friction in the globalist camps between
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:12.960]  russia and the european uh us banking elite but the number one enemy of the banksters is the
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:17.760]  american people the globalist paid 20 plus billion dollars as you know anybody can just search this

[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.120]  ass waged everything's pretty good and then we're up and running and we're live now this is the
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:37.200]  alex jones show there's a little bit of a video conundrum but we still got audio and that that'll
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:43.920]  do mr jones please continue your most singular rant it's completely okay with me i feel like
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:51.120]  ranting myself but if we both do it well might blow somebody's speakers up well listen you know
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.320]  ranting is certainly needed and that's why i get so upset is i every time i'm about to go on air
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:02.080]  especially on the road i have more than 20 pages of notes from news i've read the last day things i
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:08.240]  want to cover and then i just get on air and all i want to say is wake up our government has been
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:14.080]  taken over by globalist interest who tell us they're taking all our rights to keep us safe
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:18.960]  from al-qaeda and the russians and all the rest of it and look i don't like what the russian
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:25.120]  government's doing but they're not invading my country they're not taking over my republic
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:32.400]  the real threat is the globalist it is the new world order that is taking over our society it
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.920]  is a corporate takeover and then they say oh we've got to have war with the chinese you know the
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:44.560]  the quote us wants a base in vietnam that we had a war that killed millions of vietnamese 58
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:50.800]  thousand americans injured 300 400 000 really bad and it's it's just all made up it's a bunch of
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:58.960]  powerful interests that are on huge you'll control freak trips taking over our society and every day
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:04.320]  i see news it's off the charts i mean last week i'm just gonna list some of these bloomberg's gonna
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:10.080]  ban salt two thousand dollar fines again that two thousand number uh if you assault the food
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:17.440]  a pre-salted in new york he's gonna ban above 16 ounce sugar drinks but not aspartame not gmo
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.080]  none of the real stuff that's killing people again they create the crisis know it start killing
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:27.360]  people we get the sickest you know people in the world statistically and now oh we'll ban sugar period
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:34.080]  uh and i was reading new jersey thousand dollar fines they've passed a law if your dog isn't seat
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:39.520]  belted so now i guess my wife you know can't have the french bulldog in her lap when we're driving
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:44.080]  around when i'm driving the car i mean this is the nanny state first can't have your kids in the back
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:48.960]  of the truck on your own property driving around now now you can't have your dog back there i go to
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:55.760]  the beach and people get in your face if your dog isn't in a life jacket this nanny state isn't about
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:01.680]  safety it's about making us a bunch of ninnies impact by the new job creator which is a bunch
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.720]  of paramilitary police and again i'm not against the police but this isn't the way america used
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:13.520]  to be this isn't what freedom is this is right out of a curt vonnegut dystopic novel and i
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:19.280]  want to turn this around i do not want to be at the mercy of these globalists who i know from
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:25.360]  their own statements their own documents are not benevolent they are wicked they are corrupt
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:33.120]  and we are seeing this revolution in slavery in total control huge change is upon us and the
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:40.000]  globalists are endangering the planet in their race for nanotech life extension uh biotech genetic
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.400]  engineering super weapons super conducting super colliders cyclotrons like hadron where they admit
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.680]  well it's as low chance we're going to blow the earth up with a black hole or a strange
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:54.720]  lid but we are going to do thousands of tests you know i think i think about the craziness
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:28:00.000]  that these people are engaged in how they're predatory how it's a total will to power that
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.680]  we're seeing it's time for humanity to awaken and realize the threat of where we are going
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:11.680]  just driving through tennessee we're now in minfaç and i've got some occultic news for
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:18.480]  on the other side john i saw everywhere police facing both sides of the highway with giant
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:22.800]  license plate scanning cameras on top of them and again you're like well that'll keep people
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:28.320]  safe some folks say it'll stop felons we've learned they let a lot of the felons of people go
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:32.800]  it's really about in the future if you haven't paid your income taxes they say you're not going
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:37.680]  to be able to travel out the country or drive a car your taxes to the foreign banks it's about
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:42.960]  turning off your mobility just like the no fly list no gun buy list this is mark of the beast
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:48.400]  stuff my friend well it absolutely is and and i think these people would do well to remember
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:54.000]  that we don't really care how big how big their apparatus is they'd off hitler built a big apparatus
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  he caused a lot of problems killed a lot of people but in the end he was defeated now we want to go
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.040]  into who knew who back in those days and how many of those companies are still around and have morphed
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:08.160]  into something else that's a that's something else entirely but uh i think these people would do
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:15.200]  well to remember that americans are very slow to anger very slow to rise up but there is a point
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:23.200]  beyond which it would be a very very bad very bad idea to push us i don't know about you but i gave
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:29.840]  it my illusions of immortality a long time ago i'm not suicidal but i'm not squeamish about a fight
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:35.440]  and these guys are asking for it that's just a personal comment doesn't necessarily represent
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:40.880]  anybody else's opinion and then again it might this is the elec's oh it represents mine okay this
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:46.400]  is the alex jones show and that's why i love you brother we'll be back in just a moment
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:56.720]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:05.040]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:10.240]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:15.120]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:20.720]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:25.760]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:30.880]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.040]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:39.760]  weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:52.800]  for and with alex and uh we're just discussing about you know what we usually talk about which
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:34:00.640]  is the escalating idiotic power of the police state and no plans to abate that development
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:07.920]  in any way shape or form witness this end and justifies the means and what is this alex of police
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:15.200]  in aurora colorado looking for a suspected bank robber stops every card and intersection handcuffs
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:20.720]  all the adults i mean what is this well we saw this where they had a serial killer in
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:26.480]  louisiana a few years ago so an entire town they searched the houses without warrants and
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:32.880]  again american now you hear the stories tapping in austin where i live austin texas someone will
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.120]  put a deer rife on the back of their car it always happens in deer season to drive outside town
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:42.240]  and they locked down an entire neighborhood and set up checkpoints an hour after the guy
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:52.160]  already drove out it's this nanny state idea that well the end justifies the means we found a suspect
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:59.440]  they stopped 40 people put them in handcuffs there's photos at cbs and denver we have those
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:04.720]  links in our article in info wars dot com and the police chief says the end justifies the means
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.560]  that's a quote and he said we weren't looking for anybody in particular didn't even know what the
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:14.160]  suspect looked like but we found a suspect a guy had a gun in his car so now having a gun in your car
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:19.360]  they had to say that like c the end justifies the means we didn't find money this has happened
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:24.640]  yesterday we didn't uh we don't even know these the bank robber but now hey your neighborhood
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:29.520]  we think somebody in this neighborhood might be a criminal so we're going to come to your door
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:35.440]  and put you in handcuffs this is a guilty until proven slave this is the idea of the tsa outside
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:40.560]  the tenth amendment the ninth amendment outside federal jurisdiction not even sworn bonded police
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:47.040]  fbi can't go down your pants randomly at a park how does tsa do it it's it's the idea that you're
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:52.960]  guilty until proven slave not even guilty until proven innocent guilty until proven under tyranny
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:57.760]  what about the danger of the big government doing this what about common sense what about what our
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:04.080]  forebears told us this is very very dangerous what's your take on this i mean imagine you're
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:10.160]  driving along i see this whole time they set up checkpoints there was a serial killer in california
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:17.360]  a few months ago i saw this in the news so police night after night on a major highway uh near where
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:21.840]  homeless people had been killed i think it's like four of them now yeah being being being stabbed
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:26.880]  and robbed people folks can pull this up we played the newscast here with a straight face
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:32.800]  the police just randomly set up checkpoints during drive time and searched thousands of vehicles
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:38.480]  saying well we think the serial killer might drive by here sometimes so if you're driving
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:42.880]  down the highway and there's ever been a murder in the area the police now we're going to pull
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:47.200]  you over and say we're going to search your car you might be the murderer i mean this is over the
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:52.160]  top and this is all under federal grants john oh yeah they have checkpoints all over the country
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:57.040]  taking blood sorry go ahead no no it's all right i understand that they have already ordered tens of
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:03.520]  thousands of um you know level three bulletproof uh booths to distribute along the highways and
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:09.760]  byways and freeways of america with even equipped with stop and go lights on them so i mean it it's
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:15.280]  coming this this character oats just said the law is clear that investigative detentions are lawful
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:21.840]  for a reasonable period of time and the facts and circumstances where the suspect was in one of 19
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:26.400]  cars well it's a good thing nobody was going into cardiac arrest and needed to get to the
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:31.440]  hospital one of those 19 cars while they're waving their guns around looking for a robbery
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:36.400]  suspect to me it's just nauseating and then and the message has got to be to people that
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:42.400]  you're not safe as a matter of fact the more measures that are taken to make you safe the
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:48.000]  less safe you are but that's statistically true i mean look look take the big nannies takes like
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.920]  chicago in new york that are the model of the rest of the world now this is what the globalists
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:58.400]  want to do if they can have their way and it's no guns giant crime rates paramilitary police
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:05.920]  everywhere that turn into mafia uh you can look at it across the board when in the u.s same number
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:11.600]  in england when the state has foster children they're seven times more likely to be sexually abused
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:19.440]  five times more likely to be abused physically uh non sexually and on average 69 percent it's the
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:25.200]  same in england and here are put on psychotropic drugs and an average of seven just just type that
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:32.320]  in more than two-thirds of foster children on psychotropic again when the state has its way
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:38.480]  total hell is released and it's here so the threat is the state and the people don't believe that
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:44.560]  you don't believe in george washington thomas jefferson john b wells well what what what country
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:49.200]  had the lowest crime rate in the history of the world that would be nazi germany you could wander
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:56.720]  out of a bar absolutely completely inebriated drunkard and cooter brown money bulging out of
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:04.160]  your pockets and nobody would lay a hand on you however what society were you what what uh societal
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:12.960]  paradigm were you living in in that place it's uh i i don't know alex you know uh i've worried
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:18.720]  about this and talked about it for years i spent uh so many years just being an observer
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:25.520]  which is why finally i did i decided you know i may not be able to beat him but i bet i can let
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:30.240]  him know that they've been in one and you just reach a point in your life where you have to
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:37.200]  sing out about this i mean it's not exactly like any of us are getting uh you know rich it's not
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:42.720]  like i mean doing this sort of work all we're doing is asking for it really and uh it's not as
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:46.640]  though if somebody came to you and said hey i'm with the new world order and if you'll uh
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:50.000]  you know if you'll play ball and just kind of put a good spin on what we're trying to do here
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.120]  we'll fatten your bank account up real good it's like i don't want your money i don't well i've
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:59.440]  actually been approached like that but i mean somebody like yourself you don't shoot your own
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:05.120]  horn but the biggest movies tv commercials you're i mean you're a top voice talent and you certainly
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:11.040]  had nothing but things to lose by going public in the last few years very eloquently but again
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:16.240]  that's the illusion you have everything to lose if we don't beat this tyranny and and that's why
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:20.880]  finally there's such a big awakening happening and why so many people even in mainstream media
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:25.760]  are waking up and kind of rebelling at the same time not because they were sold out but because
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:31.520]  they believe the hype they believe the propaganda so that wake-up call is happening and everybody
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:37.040]  you know not just a george nori a decade ago not just yourself many years ago uh you know
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:42.720]  matt drudge so many others are really getting more hardcore more intense more radical because
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:48.480]  we're not radical the world is getting radical corruption and oppression is getting radical
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:53.600]  the things that government is getting away with is getting so radical that people now understand
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.240]  we either beat this or we're going into a very hellish place and i say this over and over again
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:03.920]  this is not some boss hog rich guys want to run things and just took over america if they left
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:08.880]  people alone let people have some private property and things it'd be bad i'd be fighting against it
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:16.160]  but i wouldn't be freaking out these globalists want a scientific grid they say they're going
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:20.240]  to build a world government and they've done everything they said they do so far and i'm
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:25.280]  following the roadmap i'm following their script to the next couple acts and man it's
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:32.640]  it's like biblical mass death more than two-thirds of the world killed by them they write this they
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:37.120]  say it i think about all the kids that they knowingly are injecting with cancer viruses
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:43.360]  and mercury i look at the numbers of disease cancer autism neurological disorders diabetes
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:49.120]  off the charts i find out all the Rockefeller documents i mean it's like look folks there
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:55.120]  isn't a choice and now because this stuff is out on the open i there were so many active duty
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:00.560]  military but also just retired or out of the thousands that came out to protest Bilderberg
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:05.120]  and they're like no you're right it's all coming true and and and you know they're admitting we're
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:08.400]  going to have domestic operations they're admitting we're going to target the patriots
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:12.320]  they're saying that's the new threat not al-qaeda well that's in the newspaper they're saying the
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:17.440]  new threat is the libertarian conservatives that are actually real americans we know the score
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:22.560]  we're smart we're what's left of america they know where the enemy they're coming for us i mean
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:29.120]  folks the and you can't just join them and be collaborators the globalists are pure evil
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:33.360]  it's not like you're joining a gang and you're on the winning team for police and military and
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:38.880]  other folks this is going to destroy everything and even if you're corrupt out there but not pure
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.760]  evil do you really like the fact that autism is from one and twenty five thousand thirty years ago
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:47.680]  to one and fifty eight do you really like the fact pediatric cancer is up more than ten thousand
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:52.800]  percent i mean do you really want to sign on with satan and even if you don't believe in the devil
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.400]  folks it might as well be the devil because only the devil could come up with something like this
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:00.480]  i know i'm ranting john no it's all right man no it's completely all right because i mean you open
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:06.080]  the door now i'll go you want i'll go you want more alex the last time i checked the japanese
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:10.960]  were into dragons too and i believe fukushima is in fact the mouth of the dragon now you got the
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:16.480]  russians uh they were just doing joint operations up here at fort carcin colorado uh pardon me
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:24.480]  colorado and um and we're supposed to have all kinds of uh spetsnaz and uh various other
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:31.920]  special forces uh in the country mingling with our our our special forces a number of people have
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:36.960]  contact i don't mean like two or three either i mean like a double digit number and there's a
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:40.800]  multiplier for the emails that you don't get that would have been sent but they weren't sent it's
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:45.120]  imaginary but whatever it seems to be fairly accurate that are saying oh no since we got over
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:51.360]  there into the middle east we uh we definitely put on the uh the uh the un patch it's like what
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:57.440]  i don't see this on tv oh that's right it's mainstream tv i forgot well again how did i
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:05.280]  wake up okay i'm i'm a pro gun ron paul type libertarian god guts gun us military type guy
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:11.200]  just saying i just want to have low taxes and freedom and bill writes and they were trying to

[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:22.640]  shooting with at the time they were gonna ban uh boy scout shooting ymca shooting under 18 that's
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:26.160]  why i finally said i'm gonna get on the air in oklahoma city and wake up and thanks and i was
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:30.080]  just starting to really wake up to things and i had all these former military and current
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:34.560]  military and the police chief of san antonio contacted me i wouldn't got an interview in his
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:39.840]  office this is one year on air and he's like delta forces here trying to bribe us i was an army
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:45.120]  intelligence he said this is a covert takeover operation you got to warn people i mean so i
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:50.080]  learned this from people in government who were patriots and the media said oh jones and others
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:55.520]  are crazy there's no black helicopters there's no un trips then i got sent cooperative nugget
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:02.320]  footage from 94 95 96 97 with foreign troops training to take on the american people in
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:07.920]  louisiana and mississippi then i went to urban warfare drills then i witnessed them training
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:11.760]  with the boy scouts to go in their parents house and tattle on them and tell them where the guns
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:16.880]  are oh yeah and i would come and warn people and it sounded so crazy even though i had video
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.880]  people couldn't believe it now it's in the new york times they've got the boy scouts quote
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:26.480]  train to take on disgruntled veterans now it's in the news they've got femacore now the pentagon
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:32.400]  came out yesterday and said yes we want to have local army in every city to aid the police that's
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:37.280]  already been going on secretly this is a red dawn takeover our government's been captured
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:43.200]  and if we don't admit this and have the military say no who are full of great people it's over
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:49.680]  we're done the globalists feel confident enough that in leo nine fema.gov they said troops from
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:56.480]  15 nations are here training to take on american terrorist or civil unrest it's public they have
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:02.240]  canadian and mexican troops patrolling in drills our troops go to canada our troops go to mexico
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:08.480]  it's the north american integration by stealth we got the bamf canada meeting documents from 2006
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:15.280]  it's in my film in game everything is happening this is real how far off before it's so obvious to
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:22.480]  everybody that's absolutely undeniable i mean it's undeniable to us but to the average citizen who
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:27.120]  how long before i would what kind of a timeline anyway to predict when it'll be so obvious that
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:31.040]  even the most skeptical that ah there's no new world order that they're going oh yes well there
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:37.360]  is one isn't there what are you i know you've got a top x a top privacy expert coming up the next
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:43.200]  hour and you know there's a reason the nsa's come out in the ci and said yeah your toaster your new
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:48.400]  microwave your computer your iphone your droid your washing machine that's the headline wired
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:52.640]  ci director your washing machine is spying on you and he laughed and said yeah we're watching
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:57.040]  you without warrants there's no fourth amendment he said he didn't want it used to be it's a coming
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:01.920]  out they built the secret army against us they trained the troops in secret they compartmentalized
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:07.520]  they did urban warfare drills to condition the public and the police on a regional scale uh to
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:12.640]  accept all this and now they're getting ready to roll it out and that tells you that it could be
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:17.840]  six months it could be a year they're getting ready for an iran war that's in the news yeah and as a
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:23.440]  pretext to that they will stage the globalist the offshore banks that are manipulating our military
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:29.840]  in this slow motion coup d'etat by the foreign banks they will stage terror attacks blaming it on
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:35.200]  foreign groups but also on domestic groups so that the average person when the drones suddenly hit
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:40.240]  the skies everywhere they've got 10 000 in the air force alone they want another 10 000 domestically
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:45.200]  just under air force control they're getting everybody ready with preconditioning for the big
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:50.400]  rollout you can see the pre-programming they have the big defense contractor company last week
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:56.320]  uh pr firms say we're preparing to acclimate the public for full weaponized drones then you see the
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:01.600]  announcements i've seen trucks and billboards with predator drones on them driving around saying
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:09.600]  you know global vigilance again saying it's our military but it isn't it's been taken over by foreign
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:15.760]  banks we're again we've been told the un runs our country now so it's very very soon very very soon
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:24.240]  Alex what should people do i mean i've got my military i don't want to say anything over the
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:32.160]  air i really don't well well first off john um if you go back i'm not just saying this because
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:36.240]  you're on coast to coast a m is there as one of their great host they had the
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:43.920]  act announced the emergency uh the emergency states i forget the exact name i can't believe
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:48.080]  it's not popping in my head because i confused it with the emergency centers establishment act
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:56.480]  yeah the preparedness act it was in 2002 it was the state's uh reorganization the point is it'll
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:59.840]  pop my head in a minute or somebody in the office can remember the point is it was all over the news
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:06.560]  they ordered can't let i can't remember that it'll pop my head over the break the emergency
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:10.800]  states reorganization act i forget the point is yes they had that act police all remember fire
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:17.680]  departments remember they ordered you and said it's the law you've got to take the smallpox vaccine
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:21.840]  you've got to take the anthrax vaccine you've got to take all this because we're going to force you
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:29.040]  to give the public shots and then and there was a mutiny i had police chiefs i had mayors i had fire
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:33.760]  department chiefs on they said they told us it's the law we checked it's not we know these are
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:37.680]  experimental and dangerous we're not taking them and we're not making you take them i even had
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:43.680]  some austin cops on who said no so they failed okay okay and it's the same thing with this if the
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:49.120]  military they said no to the anthrax shots that were killing people two separate times in 2002
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:54.720]  and again in what 2005 we've got to say no the military's got to have a debate about this we've
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:59.680]  got to discuss this it's already happening panetta already had to pull back a few weeks ago on okay
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:05.200]  the un doesn't totally boss us but but but but we don't have to come to you but we still might
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:10.240]  so the point is we've got a screen bloody murder explain what's happened that we're so used to russian
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:14.720]  and chinese and al-qaeda threats and i'm not saying those aren't real threats in some cases the real
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:19.040]  threat though is the bankers they're the one in charge they're the ones stealing tens of trillions
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:23.440]  they're the ones reorganizing our economy they're the ones bringing in agenda 21 they're the ones
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:27.600]  federalizing the police they're the ones throwing the book at us they're the ones saying thousand

[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:30.800]  alex jones making his way back from chantilly virginia where he was uh really annoying the
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:38.160]  bill de bergs the bill de burgers and has revealed some um some more intel regarding that bunch
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:44.480]  they are ever so much more committed to their program which has nothing to do with our program
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:48.720]  which is life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it appears that they are completely
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:56.320]  diametrically opposed to that concept and therefore they are my enemy alex let's talk
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:02.400]  about this uh this this stranger occult strangeness that that seems to be spreading everywhere
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:07.440]  that the the illuminati types the uh the meditation rooms in the united nations
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:12.800]  they all have this weird symbology all over the place and people just don't get it
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:22.400]  and they believe they power out of it and power from it and it's it's growing and looking into
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:33.760]  john uh tigret and his son isaac tigret who who basically set up all this egyptology stuff in
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:39.440]  memphis yeah you can pull them up they admit they're into the occult they admit that they put
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:45.680]  secret charms and and see that as a temple of power and that they're going to get power uh out of it
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:51.120]  and that's why they want to be god that's why they will endanger the entire world to get life
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:56.640]  extension technologies or to get super energy weapons that's why they will do anything to get
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:03.360]  control because they crave it and they love having us at their mercy like all other psychopaths and
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:09.760]  control freaks do and it's up to us good people to get involved and realize that our forebears
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:15.920]  understood this this compulsion to power and our forebears were so confident so cool so smart
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:22.080]  they tried to develop a system that would allow good wholesome intelligent truly enlightened people
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:30.880]  to come to the fore see the devil always creates a a counterfeit and that's what they've done
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:35.440]  yes i say we should eliminate people to liberty and freedom and bring life to the world people
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:41.360]  say well that's illuminati no it's not they want a dark sunshine they want a a a a twisted version
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:47.280]  of that they actually seek to keep the general public in the dark and only themselves illuminated
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:52.560]  to use the knowledge to enslave people and that's not even a true illumination because you would
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:58.080]  want to empower everybody if you were truly you know in the light of god so these people are very
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:03.920]  very dark very very dangerous and and they are deceived they are they are minions of this system

[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:08.400]  quickly the um the nsa is lying the u.s government has copies of most of your emails every facts every
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:15.680]  landline everything every keystroke it's all up there in utah i guess yes and it's gone to the
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:21.200]  point now where i have to admit for the first time in 30 years of doing this work publicly
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:26.480]  that at this point it really isn't a whole lot the american people could do about it it's gone
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:32.800]  to such a degree that the courts uh the legislation that's being passed uh violating
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:40.160]  star civil liberties is so pervasive now that it would take a complete overturning of the federal
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:47.840]  judiciary and both houses the house senate to rectify it i don't see anything like that happening
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:55.120]  in my lifetime but yes every email everything that you say and do right on the internet
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:11:03.280]  that even landline gps cell phones nsa now has a copy of it they have have been copying it
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:09.840]  downloading it for years finally william biney one of the newest whistleblowers that the
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:16.560]  government is pursuing actively pursuing trying to indict um has been interviewed a number of
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:22.480]  times at different places around the country and he's made it very clear that the nsa is in fact
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:28.800]  lying when they say that they're not easy dropping and the degree to it uh to the freedom of information
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:34.960]  act what's been revealed just in the last few weeks it's just absolutely devastating if you so much
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:44.800]  is used words like aid relief recruitment uh disasters no my favorite one is pork right in
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:53.360]  an email around a cell phone those words trigger further investigation into your phone conversation
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:58.880]  email your internet activity and this has been going on for quite some time this is actually a
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:06.240]  homeland security list that's in a binder that analysts are given that pursue this kind of
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:11.600]  eavesdropping on the american people so this is a legitimate list and in fact i've had two
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:18.640]  experiences myself uh with emails that i send out to my client base where i've used a few words
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:25.600]  on two different occasions and it has completely shut down my email and my website everything
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:30.640]  gets shut down and i have to go to the server and they have to issue what is called a vault
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:38.640]  positive with a certain coded number and i have to go in and actually reset up my entire system
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:45.680]  and allow me back online able to send email so i use these kinds of words all the time but
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:53.440]  unfortunately as well do you in your word oh yeah so it basically what this amounts to is
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:13:00.240]  these words are part of a new definition of what constitutes a potential threat to the government
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:06.720]  not just terrorism but any kind of militant or organized threat to the government domestic or
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:14.720]  foreign and the definition is now so broad that it basically charges everybody in america with
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:21.920]  being suspicious before the fact and then afterwards if they decide they want to investigate you under
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:30.160]  the new syspa house past syspa um they can actually issue a memorandum from the white house their own
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:37.760]  man security demanding that i for his turnover information on john weles for instance and i
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:43.920]  can't tell john weles or anybody else that i've been told to do so or i'll be prosecuted
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:51.680]  so this is being done completely in the dark and in secret and it's happening on an ongoing basis
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:58.880]  and basically as it stands today according to when uh green wall there's nothing we can do about it
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:04.640]  nothing we can do about it nothing we can do about he's a he's a lawyer he's well educated he's
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:11.920]  got a number of journalistic awards and legal awards he now writes for salon dot com and i don't
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:18.320]  think he's kidding one bit when he says we're past it the judiciary has been completely uh
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:24.160]  deconstructed it's obedient now to the executive branch the white house and homeland security
[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:32.320]  if they charge you as a terrorist you're going to be convicted it's just it's where we've gotten to
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:36.240]  it's taken a long time to get here i know there's a lot of people that see
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:42.640]  almost everything the government does conspiratorially i don't always look at it that way
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:50.880]  because i've been too close to it maybe maybe i maybe i am too close to it um but i see it as
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:56.480]  an evolution because i've never believed government to be anything but a threat to its citizen
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:02.880]  yes government has always seen its citizenry as its number one threat not a foreign threat not a
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:10.320]  foreign army its own people government has always been like this i don't really know where to take
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:15.280]  this craig because um i have to say that i agree with you i mean i could just say you know craig i
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:19.920]  agree with everything you're saying and then just sort of fold my fold my hands together and just
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:25.120]  kind of dwell on it for a while but there must be something that can be done which is and we would
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:30.800]  have to uh completely overturn the current judiciary and and both houses of uh congress before
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:37.040]  anything like that would even come close and you you saw what happened in the midst of all this
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:43.200]  john i mentioned this on your show and a few others you know they're changing how this country
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:50.800]  functions specifically in the media journalism and the information is not getting into the people's
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:57.760]  hands but while all of our protesting is going on both houses of congress passed unanimously
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:07.040]  hr 347 it's the better restricted building the grounds improvement act of 2011 it was passed
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:12.800]  unanimously with only ron paul and two other republicans voted against it and it basically
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:19.040]  says the secret service can declare any area restricted area whether it's a nato meeting which
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:26.960]  is why several people were arrested during memorial day 35 000 people were arrested but now if they're
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:33.280]  protesting in what the secret service declares there is a restricted area you your constitutional
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:39.040]  felony yeah it's a federal charge yeah it's a federal charge even if you beat it that's the
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:42.560]  thing about federal charges you don't have to be guilty it'll cost everything you have just to
[02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:47.760]  defend yourself against it correct and again you know once you've got a charge like that on your
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:55.440]  record it it makes it much easier for them to pursue you in other areas of the law and basically if
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:17:01.040]  you get a felony count against you can't vote you can't own a gun your life is ruined but more
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:06.720]  so than that more than that is you know a number of things have happened just in the past year
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:14.880]  that i felt were the biggest news stories i've ever seen in my entire life and i have pdf files
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:23.920]  of 500 pages in size that proves that these things are accurate and true that's namely the first one
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:30.240]  is loyalties of london's filed a lawsuit against the saudi regime for its involvement in 9 11 it
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:35.360]  goes through the case file which it was immediately uh settled out of court so it disappeared from the
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:42.880]  media but the story is so clear that saudi arabia was behind 9 11 that it can't really be disputed
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:50.960]  any longer yet this story has no interest in our media's mind the second one 29 trillion it's now
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:58.480]  35 trillion dollars has been created out of thin air that's twice the gross domestic product of
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:05.040]  america 29 trillion dollars created out of thin air over a five-year period of time lent out to
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:10.080]  institutions that were not in trouble this isn't the tart money these are secret loans for the
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:17.120]  federal reserve directly to private corporations like google and banks like the bank of london
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:24.960]  saudi bank british banks make a list that the list is absolutely so large i can't even email
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:31.680]  the list to my client they have put it on a website somewhere the third thing dereliction of duty
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:38.080]  paper classified document with the senate on forces committee charging general portray us with dereliction
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:43.440]  of duty and demanding that he be held accountable in court marcel relying to the president the white
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:50.240]  house of the american people about afghanistan yeah it's not going as well as reported is it
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:56.240]  but no we're in fact losing the war in a drastic sense we are being absolutely slaughtered over
[02:18:56.240 --> 02:19:03.040]  there we are losing ground pakistan has cut off logistics this general lieutenant colonel david
[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:08.480]  that submitted this report spent two years on the ground interviewing everybody from
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:15.920]  generals to majors to privates two years nine thousand nine thousand miles was put on his
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:22.880]  Humphrey and he comes back with this blistering account that says we're losing and we need to get
[02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:29.840]  the hell out of afghanistan and again not a peep in the media right nowhere do we hear this 29

[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:54.160]  anyway um last saturday night that i was uh pleased to have craig hulett on the program and we have
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:25:01.440]  him now for you so i think i'll just let him tell us some more about how we're not being
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:09.200]  we're not being nurtured and cared for and we're being yanked around and fed full of
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:14.480]  disinformation and anything that bad and bad that's going on we're not being informed of it and um
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:19.840]  um and there are no plans to deviate from this path uh indicated in any way shape or form
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:25.520]  um am i close here correct you're right on the money unfortunately and it is always about money
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:32.640]  and buried in the high profile issues of our new defense bill 642 billion dollar defense bill
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:40.800]  is a little tweak in the bill that will essentially neutralize two previous laws smith munt act of
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:47.360]  1948 the foreign relations authorization act of 1987 that most people aren't going to never
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:53.600]  going to hear about this but what it'll do and this is further proof that our government sees
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:26:00.640]  you and i the citizenry of america as a true enemy of of the state it's not foreign terrorism it's
[02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:06.800]  not russia or china hell china is just then authorized by the federal reserve to begin buying
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:13.280]  up u.s privately owned banks so china is not going to own the number of our privately owned
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:19.120]  commercial banking operation so hardly is china one of our enemies they're clear we are because
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:23.600]  when they tweak this defense bill and they get rid of these two laws that have been in place since
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:31.680]  1948 all that effort in propaganda and misinformation through the state department the cia and the
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:37.840]  pentagon it's always been directed at foreign government and foreign nationals will be authorized
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:44.560]  to be turned loose on the american people that will become the law of the land not only will we
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:52.400]  be lied to by omission uh not telling us that the Saudis were involved in 9 11 not telling us that
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:27:01.520]  patria's lied about uh afghanistan not being told about the 29 now 35 trillion dollars and u.s
[02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:07.920]  taxpayers money given away freely and loaned for five years to anyone and everyone throughout the
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:13.440]  world not only will we not be told about those things still we are not going to be lied to
[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:19.760]  in every way shape and form to convince us like we've tried to convince other countries nations
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:27.280]  and people that our government is perfect pristine we don't torture we don't kill when in fact we
[02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:35.440]  torture and we do kill and obama uh by the way the title of my book i didn't change it as it stays
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:44.960]  in print it was bush's uh war making and the rule of law but it also is obama's war making because
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:55.440]  obama is far outstripped bush jr in violating international law the rules of war and of course
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:28:00.400]  here domestically obama has gone so far past bush is to make bush look like one of the
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:05.040]  better presidents in our history i thought i'd never said that we're gonna have to take another
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:12.640]  look it is not amazing and and you know it's funny on our last chat it's like you're bashing obama
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:17.280]  or you're bashing it like listen we're bashing them all don't you get it we're bashing them all
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:22.640]  the whole thing is almost rotten to the core and look at that mess that happened down there in

[02:32:56.400 --> 02:33:05.120]  oh
[02:33:05.120 --> 02:33:28.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, John B. Wells sitting in for a while ago with
[02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:41.360]  Alex and we are currently talking with Craig B. Hewlett. He's been paying attention to
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:47.160]  what we now call or refer to generally as the encroachment of the New World Order and
[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:52.720]  the agenda that goes along with it for many years now. And somehow or another we just wind
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:57.320]  up on the air together frequently with increasing frequency because he's sort of like I am.
[02:33:57.320 --> 02:34:00.800]  He's a little bit grumpy about this. He doesn't like it and we're going to continue to talk
[02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:05.520]  about it until at least we've satisfied ourselves and we've told as many people as we possibly
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:10.080]  can and then after that it's pretty much up to them. And I suppose that starts with the
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:16.400]  politicians but Craig how many years would it take to undo this? You know unless we have
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:22.000]  divine intervention of some sort I mean it doesn't look good man it just really doesn't.
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:29.800]  I would put it at three generations. I think the generation down the road something gets
[02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:37.680]  born into the country that we leave behind. By the way I still believe that our World
[02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:42.840]  War II generation was the finest generation America ever produced. I do too. And if you
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:47.600]  don't believe it watch Ken Burns documentary and you'll be a true believer after you watch
[02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:57.240]  it. But you know I lost basically my entire adult family on both sides the male side anyway.
[02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:02.200]  Everybody volunteered almost everybody died and I still think it's the greatest generation
[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:07.920]  but what we've done since is we've left behind a country that no longer resembles anything
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:13.880]  like what the founding fathers or the World War II veterans left behind. And I fear it
[02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:22.840]  will take a generation our great great grandchildren to grow up in this miasma and maybe they'll
[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:28.080]  do something about it. Well maybe they will because certainly they'll be if we're sick
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:32.000]  of it already imagine how much sicker they will be of it by the time they're able to
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:37.120]  take an intervention. I wonder how sick of it we really are. You know we've got a president
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:43.560]  now that openly admits that has to admit because of WikiLeaks and Anonymous and the
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:51.960]  back doors left open and the Pentagon the CIA websites by Intel experts that resigned
[02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:57.840]  under Bush they were so sick of it a hundred top CIA analysts resigned under Bush Jr. because
[02:35:57.840 --> 02:36:03.880]  they wouldn't lie about Iraq and Afghanistan in 9-11 and many of them left back doors
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:10.000]  open into the system so that WikiLeaks could actually be created out of thin air. This
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:15.840]  isn't an accident that WikiLeaks came along and it's not hackers. The hackers are getting
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:21.000]  the raw data but the back doors that have been left open were left by our own people
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:26.680]  in the CIA and NSA that wanted the American people to know what WikiLeaks is now able
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:31.280]  to tell us but we're not doing anything with the information. In fact WikiLeaks isn't even
[02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:37.200]  part of the news any longer. Isn't that the truth. And that's it's not confusing to me
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:42.760]  any longer. I've always felt that the country was evolving in this direction whether we
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:47.320]  liked it or not whether there's a conspiracy or not. It doesn't make any difference. The
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:53.120]  fact of the matter is the country's history. It's no longer anything like what it ought
[02:36:53.120 --> 02:36:59.040]  to be or should have been. And I do do ought you know I've written two philosophy books
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:04.560]  you know I do ought but I don't think what I think ought to be is the way it's going
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:11.240]  to be. The truth of the matter is I'm a praxeologist. A and B lined up. I know that C is going
[02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:16.880]  to take place. A and B is lined up and C is taking place. It's not a damn thing we can
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:23.520]  do about it at this point. Look at Ron Paul. I've known Ron because he was a young young
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:29.560]  man. When I started out together in Houston. He's the first person I ever gave a nickel
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:35.960]  to when he was a congressman. When I had my company in Houston. Yeah. And look at where
[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:41.680]  we're at today. Back in the day Ron Paul and I used to do lectures and we would end up
[02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:46.960]  in the same day. It's the same platform. He'd speak first. I'd speak second. Tony Sutton
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:55.440]  third or Jim Garrison of JFK fame. Oh yes. So we were all colleague. Bob Brown soldier
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:38:03.600]  fortune magazine. Tony Sutton. Wow. We're all old and we're all dying and pretty soon
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:10.400]  I'm not going to have any colleagues left and I don't see anybody replacing the Tony
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:15.520]  Sutton to the Ron Paul. Well I don't either and when you see Ron Paul being in his delegates
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:20.680]  being treated with such abject disrespect. How dirty does that tell you that the Republican
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:26.200]  party is just as much as we think the Democrats are. They're all equally dirty. Argument of
[02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:32.160]  mine and Ron Paul too by the way. I don't know. Most people don't know this but Ron
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:37.880]  quit with a devastating letter published in the congressional record as a Republican congressman
[02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:43.080]  became a libertarian ran for president. And I thought that that's exactly what I thought
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:48.000]  Ron Paul would do one day and then he did it. Then it proved to be totally pointless
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:53.760]  because the American people will never accept a third party candidate unless he's a billionaire.
[02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:58.400]  Right. And of course that billionaire was a liar from the get go. He had no intention
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:03.800]  of being president. He just wanted to hurt Bush because it was an old Texas fight. Yep.
[02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:08.320]  You know Ross Perot was going to pay his payback for Bush senior. Yeah he had no intention
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:11.360]  of being president. He just wanted to hand it up to him. He just wanted to divide the
[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:16.960]  party out of the race. That's it. And he made sure that he lost. But he could have split
[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:20.320]  the vote, could have gone to the House and the Senate. But then see we would have then
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:26.840]  looked at a third party legitimately and he wasn't about to upset the T card that he belonged
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:33.680]  to General Motors. Right. Board of Directors. Hey you know going back to this 9-11 thing
[02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:39.760]  what was in your opinion what was the reason that the Saudis were involved at all? Well
[02:39:39.760 --> 02:39:45.480]  I think it's clear. I believe there was an Asian state involved in day one. In fact that's
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:51.480]  what blew me off the Jim Bohannon show. I was the first guest interviewed on the 22nd
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:40:00.160]  of September and right after George Bush Jr. gave his speech on Al Qaeda. Right. And I
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:04.440]  was on the air within three minutes. I was on the air live in Washington D.C. with Jim
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:10.000]  Bohannon. I was a regular for a decade. And I said that Al Qaeda didn't do it. It was nonsense.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:18.360]  There was a nation-state involvement. There had to be. And of course that cost me a number
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:23.840]  of hosts throughout the nation including Jim Bohannon. But it's turned out that there's
[02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:29.800]  no question Saudi Arabia was involved now. But the reason is simple. They knew bin Laden
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:35.360]  would be blamed and they knew Saddam Hussein would be taken out. Two of the Saudis' biggest
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:44.000]  enemies, bin Laden and Saddam Hussein would be taken out. It seems to me that what we're
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:52.200]  being good grief man. Okay. So the Saudis decided to use us and now the NWO or whatever
[02:40:52.200 --> 02:41:00.200]  you want to call them. We have now built this country, gone to the moon, made ships that
[02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:04.800]  go into the ocean. You know basically came out of the cave and made steel. And now they're
[02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:11.720]  just going to take it apart and I suppose just distribute the spoils. And America just
[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:18.920]  gets absorbed into this global borg of surveillance, control, taxation and basically slavery.
[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:23.480]  Well it actually has a name. You know there's a legitimate name to this. I know we call
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:28.520]  it the New World Order. Even Bush Senior had the audacity to use terminology.
[02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:35.520]  A hundred and something times. Yeah. That was Iraq war one. So you know but it's a valid
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:43.920]  euphemism. But its actual system is referred to as an ascephalus organ. Meaning a headless
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:48.360]  organ. And all these different institutions that were quietly being created from Bretton
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:59.040]  Woods to the World Bank to NATO. And ultimately there will be a global central Federal Reserve
[02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:06.240]  Bank. This is all mapped out. It's all plain to date by volume. Volume of academic literature
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:12.840]  on the subject. It's discussed relentlessly in academia. But if you or I stay it in the
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:18.760]  public sphere, we're labeled conspiracies, theorists, crack-pots, right-wingers, communists,
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:22.720]  fascists. Oh absolutely. I don't know. You'll be called everything in the books sooner or
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:26.920]  later. I have. Me too. I kind of like it. It means I'm getting somebody's attention
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:32.400]  when they start hurling slurs and names at me. I like it. Probably one of the few. Well
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:42.120]  it is a viable argument. We are being absorbed into a geopolitical global economic system
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:47.480]  that has no relationship or obedience to nation-state sovereignty. That's just the
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:52.640]  facts of the matter. And it cannot be any longer disputed. But what will happen here
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:57.480]  in America? Everybody says they're killing the golden goose. No, they're not. It depends
[02:42:57.480 --> 02:43:03.040]  on who you're talking about. Right. Who are we talking about when we say they are destroying
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:10.080]  this nation? No, they're not. They're making their world. They couldn't be happier. The
[02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:17.440]  new Wild West is China, Asia, the Middle East. Most people don't have cars and refrigerators.
[02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:21.080]  But soon they will. But soon they will. That's where all the money is going. That's why they're
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:27.360]  not... After $29 trillion has been doled out to the largest wealthiest bank, American
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:34.960]  Bank, since world history, more wealth is accumulated than Solomon, for heaven's sake,
[02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:40.320]  and yet not a dime is being loaned back to the American people. Well, there's a reason.
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:48.280]  Yes. This doesn't happen in a vacuum. Nothing happens in government by accident. Nothing.
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:55.880]  FDR said that. Not just Craig Hewlett. How long can this be sustained, Craig? Forever.
[02:43:55.880 --> 02:44:00.240]  Oh, Lord. I was afraid you were gonna... Okay, let me fire another one out. Here comes the
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:06.080]  shotgun out the back door deal. Why are we dealing with the... We have a new stealth
[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:09.680]  ship now. It's probably been around for a while because we're just now seeing it that's
[02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:14.480]  supposedly able to operate better than big boats in littoral conflicts, meaning shallow
[02:44:14.480 --> 02:44:19.360]  water conflicts. And the Chinese are going, now we can just swarm it with a bunch of little
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:23.240]  boats and blow it up sooner or later. It'd be a goner. It's like, why are we doing so
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:29.120]  much business with these people in between saber-rattling sessions with each other? I
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:33.680]  don't understand this love-hate relationship with them. Everything is being built over
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:37.360]  there. I mean, did these guys build a gigantic underground base and just go, we're gonna
[02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:41.720]  be friends or we launch on you? We don't care if we lose a billion people. You lose everything.
[02:44:41.720 --> 02:44:47.720]  You lose everything. Well, there's a very simple and mundane answer to this. Okay.
[02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:53.880]  And Tony Stutton is my mentor. Tony and I became very fast friends many, many decades
[02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:59.800]  ago. Tony's no longer with us, but he wrote a three-volume work that edited him two PhDs
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:06.680]  called Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development. Let me say that again. Western
[02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:15.160]  Technology and Soviet Economic Development. And he proved in the three volumes, each volume
[02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:21.800]  probably 400 pages, all of it was technical study, extremely technical. But he proved
[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:26.560]  with our questions that Western Technology built the Soviet Union from the ground up.
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:34.200]  The largest Ford motor plant was built in 1926 in Russia by Ford Motor. And we have never
[02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:40.800]  not done business with the Soviet Union when it was at the height of the Cold War. In fact,
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:46.640]  Tony and I assembled a document proving that our shuttle was an exact duplicate of the
[02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:58.680]  Russian shuttle. I thought it was the other way around. Well, it's true. You know, it's
[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:02.040]  true. A bunch of us bought a bunch of these old Russian jets off the Bulgarian flight
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:05.480]  line a few years ago, several years ago. And I'm going to look at this. I'm going, you
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:10.680]  know, this sure looks like our stuff. And this guy said it is our stuff. There wasn't
[02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:17.360]  a metric bolt on it. And they didn't steal it. No. It was transferred to them openly
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:22.760]  and willingly. It's called the Trading with the Enemy Act. We did it with Hitler's Germany.
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:28.320]  We did it with the Soviets. We will do it with China because there is so much more money
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:34.880]  in the war making end of nation state bargaining and corporate global activities than in any
[02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:41.880]  other area, except of course, banking. That's why China is now allowed to come in and buy
[02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:50.440]  US banks here on domestic American soil. Chinese central communist state controlled banks can
[02:46:50.440 --> 02:47:00.400]  now own US private banks. This is the problem. We're talking about a multinational corporation
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:05.960]  that has no allegiance to any nation state whatsoever. So an American starts a corporation
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:10.920]  goes multinational. He has friends, German and Chinese on his board of directors. 30%
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:16.520]  of that corporation is owned by banking interest both sides of the Atlantic and Pacific. These
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:24.600]  corporations are the ruling elite. There is no nation state left. The nation state is
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:29.880]  nothing but one side of the simple coin of multinational banking and corporate interest.
[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:36.880]  You and I worked for them and our government worked for them. There is no them in us, government
[02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:44.480]  in us. We are simply the surf and the governing bodies that rule over us are simply the merchants
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:49.600]  of death that are employed by the corporate structure to achieve whatever objectives they
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:55.880]  want in whatever country they desire, including on our own domestic soil. You and I are the
[02:47:55.880 --> 02:48:02.720]  enemy. You know, this is the most rational explanation as to what exactly is going on
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:07.680]  around here that I think I've ever heard. I don't believe that. Well, I mean, that is
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:15.280]  the most intelligible explanation I've ever heard and I've asked the question many times.
[02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:21.120]  You know, what's going on here, what it boils down to. But that's it. So that doesn't go
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:28.520]  just for us. That's everybody. There's no England, no China, no nothing. There's just
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:35.720]  the largest multinational corporation. Many of them, if not the largest percentage, are
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:42.280]  American corporations. Of the 100 largest economies in the world, the 100 largest economies
[02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:48.080]  in the world, America's economy being the largest, 51 are corporations. They're not
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:57.520]  even countries. They're corporations. Walmart is larger than any other country, period,
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:49:03.520]  except United States and Great Britain. I don't think anybody in America realizes that
[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:09.320]  these corporations hate competition. They hate free enterprise. They want nothing to
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:15.080]  do with competition or Adam Smith or free enterprise. The progressive left is wrong.
[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:19.080]  Nob Chomsky, you're wrong. You don't know what you're talking about. You want to know
[02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:24.840]  why I know these things, why I've come to this as an analyst? Who do you think I am?
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:30.520]  I was one of those capitalist pigs. My clients before I went public with this information
[02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:37.400]  were GE. Next on US Home, Wirehouser. When I left the corporate world and went into the
[02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:44.320]  political world, I discovered very quickly that they're the same place. By name. Where
[02:49:44.320 --> 02:49:49.600]  do you think these congressmen and senators, defense secretaries and under secretaries
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:54.760]  of state, end up when they leave the government service? They end up at the multinational
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:50:00.640]  corporate structure doing business with China, the Soviet Union, Guatemala, the drug wars
[02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:06.040]  and joke. There's more money in pharmaceuticals than in drugs. Without the pharmaceuticals,
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:09.080]  there'd be no cocaine. Oh, that's for sure.
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:16.720]  Oh, Craig, I'll tell you, it's something else. That's just absolutely beyond anything
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:22.040]  I've ever even imagined. But it reminds me of that old movie with James Cahn in it back
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:29.480]  in the 70s called Roller Ball where they would say, and now our corporate anthem. I suppose
[02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:34.000]  that's where we are now, isn't it? Yes. I used to use the analogy of Blade Runner.
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:39.440]  There's no getting past. There's no getting around it. There's no fixing it. There's no
[02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:45.360]  stopping it. There's no changing it. All I do now is attempt to inform those who are
[02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:50.600]  willing to listen. If you're a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal or a conservative
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:55.360]  and you're fixed in your ideology, I can't help you. Hang on. Hang on, Craig. We'll be
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:51:05.720]  back as the Alex Jones show. We shall return. Folks, have you lost your power and wanted
[02:51:05.720 --> 02:51:09.880]  to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on? If so, this is going to be the most
[02:51:09.880 --> 02:51:14.000]  important message you'll ever hear because there's never been a better time to get ready
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:19.440]  for the winter power outages ahead. Here's why. Solar power generators are now available
[02:51:19.440 --> 02:51:23.840]  from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors. Their emergency
[02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:29.280]  backup systems provide light-saving electrical power when you need it most. Unlike gas generators,
[02:51:29.280 --> 02:51:34.520]  a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity from the sun. It's
[02:51:34.520 --> 02:51:38.880]  like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own, whether it's ice
[02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:43.480]  storms, brownouts, or blackouts. You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages
[02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:48.360]  again. When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator
[02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:53.520]  from Solutions from Science. Go to mysolarbackup.com for more information. That's My Solar
[02:51:53.520 --> 02:52:01.600]  Backup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:06.520]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins. That bears repeating.
[02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:12.080]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins. And ProEM1, daily probiotic
[02:52:12.080 --> 02:52:17.520]  cleanse, is the key to digestive health. ProEM1 is a powerful liquid probiotic, strong

[02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:46.400]  ProEM1, daily probiotic cleanse, is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[02:53:46.400 --> 02:54:16.200]  This is the Alex Jones show. John D. Wells sitting in with you, the Saturday night man
[02:54:16.200 --> 02:54:23.540]  for Coast to Coast AM and we are just continuing to develop our relationship as we share information
[02:54:23.540 --> 02:54:29.460]  and release it to you and we are presently speaking with Craig Hewlett who was on Coast
[02:54:29.460 --> 02:54:37.100]  last Saturday and on Alex Jones' show today and I'll tell you I am just about to, I don't
[02:54:37.100 --> 02:54:42.260]  know, I'm thinking about, nah, I was going to say I'm thinking about going out to LA
[02:54:42.260 --> 02:54:45.860]  and just jump off the Hollywood side but that's not really me besides I'm not suicidal
[02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:49.580]  so all of a sudden I drop off the scope, you'll know I was the new world order man because
[02:54:49.580 --> 02:54:56.100]  I'm not doing it to myself, speaking of jumping off the Hollywood side and vanishing otherwise,
[02:54:56.100 --> 02:54:59.640]  so standing around a terrorist now with all these armed drones that are going to be flying
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:04.420]  around soon, they're already flying, they're going to be more flying, standing near a somebody
[02:55:04.420 --> 02:55:07.880]  labeled as a terrorist makes you a terrorist and you may wind up getting whacked out by
[02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:12.080]  the drone as well with of course no recourse whatsoever.
[02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:17.580]  That's correct and using a secret kill order, I love the terminology which is not even Orwellian
[02:55:17.580 --> 02:55:22.700]  any longer, Obama has what are called secret kill orders and there's even a 17-year-old
[02:55:22.700 --> 02:55:31.100]  girl listed on one of his kill orders as WikiLeaks so proved, so let me close by saying something
[02:55:31.100 --> 02:55:34.900]  because this is a new show I've never done before and you and I are just getting to know
[02:55:34.900 --> 02:55:35.900]  each other.
[02:55:35.900 --> 02:55:40.060]  The reason I haven't changed the title of my book The Hydra Parnage Bush's Imperial
[02:55:40.060 --> 02:55:46.100]  War Making is because in about five years the title will still be accurate, it will
[02:55:46.100 --> 02:55:52.380]  be Bush's Imperial War Making still, but it'll be Jeb Bush, he will be the president five
[02:55:52.380 --> 02:55:53.380]  years from now.
[02:55:53.380 --> 02:55:58.740]  Obama will get re-elected and Obama will do everything that the Bush's would wish him
[02:55:58.740 --> 02:56:06.140]  to do and the individual would call them the elite would tell him to do, he's merely finishing
[02:56:06.140 --> 02:56:12.900]  up what George Bush Jr. started, which Clinton started, which Reagan, Nixon, Ford started,
[02:56:12.900 --> 02:56:17.660]  so we're not really going to see a change in policy, continuity of government is the
[02:56:17.660 --> 02:56:22.940]  sole purpose of the two parties, get rid of one, throw dogs out, put another guy in,
[02:56:22.940 --> 02:56:28.700]  but nothing ever changes, the doctrine of continuity of government according to our
[02:56:28.700 --> 02:56:29.700]  own government.
[02:56:29.700 --> 02:56:35.700]  Jeb Bush is slated to be the president after Obama because Obama will be blamed for everything
[02:56:35.700 --> 02:56:43.340]  that the Bush's had a hand in doing, but everybody will be ready then for another Bush and we
[02:56:43.340 --> 02:56:50.060]  will blindly go to the polls, immediately find Jeb Bush attractive and Jeb Bush will
[02:56:50.060 --> 02:56:56.740]  be the president of the United States, Craig's book, subtitle will remain the same.
[02:56:56.740 --> 02:57:01.220]  That's because you're a visionary, Craig B. Hewlett, always a pleasure to talk to you
[02:57:01.220 --> 02:57:05.940]  and we will be talking again in the future, thanks for taking some time out of the middle
[02:57:05.940 --> 02:57:10.780]  of the day to be with us here on The Alex Jones Show and we'll speak to you again, you'll
[02:57:10.780 --> 02:57:14.820]  either speak with Alex again on The Alex Jones Show or you can speak with me on Coast
[02:57:14.820 --> 02:57:15.820]  to Coast A.M. sometime.
[02:57:15.820 --> 02:57:16.820]  Any time.
[02:57:16.820 --> 02:57:21.540]  Well I appreciate it Craig, check your sex pal and stay healthy.
[02:57:21.540 --> 02:57:28.860]  All right, some information we spoke in the first hour with Dr. Teresa Dale, her website
[02:57:28.860 --> 02:57:37.060]  is naturalhealingpro.com and you'll find products that will help you defend yourself against
[02:57:37.060 --> 02:57:44.380]  the effects of the radiation that is in fact spreading from the Fukushima's failed reactors
[02:57:44.380 --> 02:57:49.420]  and there are meltdowns there, it is happening, it's not being reported but it is, it's happening
[02:57:49.420 --> 02:57:51.660]  so take steps to protect yourself.
[02:57:51.660 --> 02:57:58.380]  Also Info Wars store, Info Wars shop, they have some products to help you defend yourself,
[02:57:58.380 --> 02:58:04.740]  Craig B. Hewlett, H-U-L-E-T.com, you can find his books, keep up with the latest intel
[02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:10.940]  and come and see me and mine on caravantomidnight.com, there's some Geiger counters, three different
[02:58:10.940 --> 02:58:15.380]  kinds, they're inexpensive and it's one of those things where better to have it and not
[02:58:15.380 --> 02:58:16.900]  need it than to need it and not have it.
[02:58:16.900 --> 02:58:22.580]  It's been a delight to be in with you today and I wish you the very best in the future.
[02:58:22.580 --> 02:58:27.140]  Check your six means, watch your backs, do that.
