[00:44.880 --> 00:49.320]  fear swept the planet and that was dr. sherry tenpenning who is a medical
[00:49.320 --> 00:54.720]  doctor an expert on the bird flu and runs a high-end clinic in mexico in
[00:54.720 --> 00:58.680]  between her clinic in the united states we've been unable to get through to her
[00:58.680 --> 01:03.360]  this weekend on phone numbers to her clinics in mexico the phone systems are
[01:03.360 --> 01:08.240]  having major troubles across mexico city i've been getting a lot of emails from

[01:29.360 --> 01:34.320]  reports saturday night there were more people dead and sick and the media was
[01:34.320 --> 01:40.040]  saying that's now been confirmed as of today and so the intel we're getting has
[01:40.040 --> 01:45.000]  also been matched by a bbc report but the deaths are far greater than what is
[01:45.000 --> 01:52.840]  being reported so i'm gonna open the phones up for folks inside mexico one
[01:52.840 --> 01:58.960]  eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one one eight hundred two five nine

[08:48.760 --> 08:53.480]  expert on the bird flu she will be joining us
[08:53.480 --> 08:58.040]  coming up in about six seven minutes then in the last hour today
[08:58.040 --> 09:01.320]  steve quail steve quail came on the show
[09:01.320 --> 09:05.960]  last monday and said his intel was that the establishment was planning to go
[09:05.960 --> 09:10.360]  with a bio attack some type of bird flu
[09:10.360 --> 09:14.920]  and so we've got him coming back on today in the last hour two o'clock
[09:14.920 --> 09:18.360]  central standard time or two hours fifty minutes from
[09:18.360 --> 09:22.040]  now fifty one minutes to be precise steve quail will be joining us we're
[09:22.040 --> 09:29.720]  going to have open phones today i want to let listeners know that
[09:29.720 --> 09:34.200]  if you're in mexico or you have family in mexico or you're in south texas where
[09:34.200 --> 09:38.680]  they've shut down a lot of the schools uh saturday night at a two plus hour
[09:38.680 --> 09:42.440]  emergency transmission and we got calls from one of the towns north of
[09:42.440 --> 09:45.400]  san antonio where they locked down one of the schools and are closing it
[09:45.400 --> 09:48.760]  we got calls from mexico city with a lot of key eyewitness reports
[09:48.760 --> 09:53.320]  about how seventy percent or more the people they saw were sick
[09:53.320 --> 09:56.600]  that the deaths were a lot higher than what the media was saying
[09:56.600 --> 10:00.360]  then the bbc had reports from doctors in hospitals
[10:00.360 --> 10:04.600]  saying was more than 200 deaths as of saturday they were still saying 68 deaths
[10:04.600 --> 10:07.880]  as of yesterday now they're saying 103
[10:07.880 --> 10:10.440]  confirmed
[10:10.840 --> 10:13.800]  the toll-free number to join us if you're in mexico
[10:13.800 --> 10:17.640]  or in canada or in any area know someone who's gotten sick or
[10:17.640 --> 10:21.640]  uh if you've seen anything going on eight eight eight two oh one two two four
[10:21.640 --> 10:25.160]  four eight eight eight two oh one two two four four
[10:25.160 --> 10:29.400]  because you can't trust the mainstream media and we can analyze what they're
[10:29.400 --> 10:32.200]  saying and doing
[10:32.520 --> 10:36.680]  but uh you can't just take it um take it as is you've got to
[10:36.680 --> 10:41.160]  check it with a lot of other sources and things now let me just make this clear
[10:41.160 --> 10:45.880]  i think this is a bunch of hype but when you've got the world health
[10:45.880 --> 10:49.400]  organizations saying they fear a massive global pandemic
[10:49.400 --> 10:52.920]  and have the military standing by in the western world for martial law
[10:52.920 --> 10:56.920]  and that's what this medical emergency is the executive orders have been
[10:56.920 --> 10:59.960]  put into place continuity of government has been engaged that's what the
[10:59.960 --> 11:03.240]  executive orders say that's what they announced sunday
[11:03.240 --> 11:08.120]  morning with a rare white house sunday briefing
[11:08.120 --> 11:11.640]  so they create the fear and then say oh but it's no big deal so they can be both
[11:11.640 --> 11:14.920]  the person scaring you and the person you're playing the part of uh
[11:14.920 --> 11:18.360]  then being your protector i think it's a bunch of hype
[11:18.360 --> 11:21.800]  unless they're lying about the severity of it the way they're hyping it and
[11:21.800 --> 11:25.000]  saying it's you know they're getting ready for this big crisis but then
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.440]  oh it's no big deal at the same time if they are lying about the number of
[11:30.440 --> 11:33.720]  cases they're just saying a few thousand in mexico
[11:33.720 --> 11:36.600]  when they're talking about and then other reports out of mexico say there's
[11:36.600 --> 11:40.600]  just people sick everywhere a country of a hundred million people
[11:40.600 --> 11:44.040]  and then they're saying that it's only two thousand people sick
[11:44.040 --> 11:48.920]  and a hundred people dying because the flu in the united states on average
[11:48.920 --> 11:52.680]  kills fifteen thousand people and it kills even more than that each year in
[11:52.680 --> 11:56.920]  mexico because of that sanitation lack of medical uh care and people's access
[11:56.920 --> 11:59.960]  to it because they're so poor all the poorest nations in the world
[11:59.960 --> 12:02.440]  but of course they have more billionaires than any nation in the on the
[12:02.440 --> 12:05.320]  planet because they're so corrupt they have a
[12:05.320 --> 12:09.640]  super elite and a huge mass of poor people
[12:09.640 --> 12:14.440]  so something doesn't jive here something stinks
[12:14.440 --> 12:20.440]  to high heaven here because uh i'm actually hoping
[12:20.440 --> 12:23.880]  that hundreds of thousands are sick in mexico
[12:23.880 --> 12:28.200]  now listen to me carefully because if hundreds of thousands are sick
[12:28.200 --> 12:32.040]  and then it's only a hundred and something deaths like they're now saying
[12:32.040 --> 12:38.600]  then that means it's a regular flu flu always kills people
[12:38.600 --> 12:44.280]  okay but if it really is only two thousand people sick in mexico and you
[12:44.280 --> 12:50.680]  got 103 people at least dead then this is a bad acting flu
[12:50.680 --> 12:54.280]  i wouldn't call it weaponized but it's it's it's tough stuff it's on the verge
[12:54.280 --> 12:57.400]  of that now the available evidence shows
[12:57.400 --> 13:03.080]  they're lying and it's way more than two thousand cases in mexico
[13:03.080 --> 13:08.760]  and so that means oh good it's it's not some super deadly flu now
[13:08.760 --> 13:14.440]  the reason governments are so concerned is that the swine flu of 1918
[13:14.440 --> 13:18.840]  released at a u.s military base clearly it is on her virus
[13:18.840 --> 13:23.000]  killed at least they debate between 40 and 60 million worldwide at least 40
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.320]  million people millions in europe and the united states
[13:27.320 --> 13:33.800]  and
[13:33.800 --> 13:40.520]  it attacked healthy people it attacked healthy people
[13:40.520 --> 13:44.360]  it attacked people between 18 and 30 years of age that were very
[13:44.360 --> 13:50.520]  healthy very virile very strong because they had a their their auto immune
[13:50.520 --> 13:54.840]  system in their lungs had an over response to it
[13:54.840 --> 13:58.680]  flooding the areas with
[13:59.720 --> 14:03.560]  antibodies with white blood cells causing an auto immune response their
[14:03.560 --> 14:09.080]  lungs swolled up and they died basically of a quick acting
[14:09.080 --> 14:13.960]  pneumonia and i guess that ties into some type of hemorrhagic
[14:13.960 --> 14:18.440]  fever where you get one bug and then you have an auto immune
[14:18.440 --> 14:22.840]  response and it kills you we'll talk to dr
[14:22.840 --> 14:28.200]  sherry tin penny in a moment in fact we have her yet go ahead and call her
[14:28.200 --> 14:31.880]  she's normally in mexico when i'm unable to get her in mexico and they told me
[14:31.880 --> 14:34.680]  right as i came in to the next segment they'd gotten a hold of her so i'm
[14:34.680 --> 14:41.400]  not even sure where she's at we'll find out when we get her
[14:41.400 --> 14:45.880]  so understand the government's response to this is what should raise
[14:45.880 --> 14:52.040]  our eyebrows raise our ears raise the hackles on the back of our neck
[14:52.040 --> 14:55.720]  because flu kills 15 000 people some numbers say 30 000 but
[14:55.720 --> 14:59.080]  the conservative numbers are 15 000 on average in the us a year
[14:59.080 --> 15:06.440]  tens of thousands in mexico a year why then are they hyping 103 deaths
[15:06.440 --> 15:11.400]  why are they saying there's deaths in mexico but not in the united states
[15:12.600 --> 15:16.920]  so if there's only 2000 cases in mexico and it has killed 100 plus people
[15:16.920 --> 15:20.120]  that is a really bad acting flu but if it's
[15:20.120 --> 15:23.240]  more people that are sick hundreds of thousands and it's only 100 dead well
[15:23.240 --> 15:26.680]  then that sounds like a regular flu then you get into the issue of
[15:26.680 --> 15:34.760]  that this thing has got genetics from pigs birds and humans from europe asia
[15:34.760 --> 15:39.400]  and north america you've got the government's response in napolitano
[15:39.400 --> 15:43.640]  and in reuters saying us should prepare for new flu
[15:43.640 --> 15:48.120]  outbreak she said even if this fizzles out
[15:48.120 --> 15:50.680]  this is a quote in a press conference in the next two weeks
[15:50.680 --> 15:55.400]  that another one is coming and that's all reuters says
[15:55.400 --> 15:59.960]  but very cryptic there they have declared an emergency in mexico they
[15:59.960 --> 16:03.880]  have declared a declared emergency here they do have europe
[16:03.880 --> 16:06.840]  saying telling their people don't fly to the us or
[16:06.840 --> 16:10.760]  mexico they are banning the importation from southern and western states of

[24:23.720 --> 24:26.760]  a big threat
[24:26.760 --> 24:30.760]  why have they been organizing their whole martial law takeover plan
[24:30.760 --> 24:36.840]  around an outbreak of smallpox bird flu SARS and a few other
[24:36.840 --> 24:43.320]  a few other uh micro born illnesses i'm gonna go through all the news and to
[24:43.320 --> 24:47.640]  tell the latest developments but we have new york ohio kansas california
[24:47.640 --> 24:50.840]  texas large areas of central and southern mexico
[24:50.840 --> 24:54.360]  without breaks uh we're talking to medical dr sherry
[24:54.360 --> 24:57.960]  tenpenny he was out of practice in mexico and in the united states
[24:57.960 --> 25:03.640]  uh and uh doctor tenpenny bottom line here what do you think is going on i
[25:03.640 --> 25:07.240]  know it's too early to fully tell but we've got baxter saying they're going
[25:07.240 --> 25:11.320]  to make a new vaccine for this uh we've got just just
[25:11.320 --> 25:14.120]  unprecedented fear mongering by the media and the government
[25:14.120 --> 25:18.200]  is it just fear mongering and grandstanding or do they know something
[25:18.200 --> 25:21.560]  that the public doesn't know you know what alex i think it's a
[25:21.560 --> 25:24.280]  little bit of both i think that there's there's some
[25:24.280 --> 25:27.400]  things going on that's that's a lot of fear mongering i mean
[25:27.400 --> 25:31.080]  one of the questions i wrote an article last night and posted it on my website
[25:31.080 --> 25:34.200]  dr tenpenny dot com that's that was that's called
[25:34.200 --> 25:38.440]  you know swine flu the new bird flu and some of the questions that i think are
[25:38.440 --> 25:41.640]  really kind of interesting that no one seems to be bringing up is the fact
[25:41.640 --> 25:45.640]  that flu season isn't in april flu season's in october and november
[25:45.640 --> 25:49.000]  i mean so what is all this about you know all this flu stuff that's going on
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.920]  now which makes me kind of question another thing is that past
[25:52.920 --> 25:55.720]  pandemics as we know them and as they've been reported
[25:55.720 --> 25:59.480]  have all rolled out of southeast asia this is supposedly coming out of
[25:59.480 --> 26:02.680]  mexico city which i think is a big distinction too because
[26:02.680 --> 26:06.200]  mexico city is the capital it's the way south in the mexico
[26:06.200 --> 26:10.520]  and people get mexico city confused with the entire country of mexico
[26:10.520 --> 26:13.480]  mexico city is one of the one top one or two
[26:13.480 --> 26:17.960]  sized population cities in the entire world it's filthy dirty millions of
[26:17.960 --> 26:21.000]  people live on garbage dumps and when i wrote my book
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.720]  foul bird flu it's not what you think i made a very big and compelling argument
[26:25.720 --> 26:29.960]  that when you take garden variety of influenza and you mix it with dioxin and
[26:29.960 --> 26:33.400]  other types of chemicals it more than doubles the death rates
[26:33.400 --> 26:37.240]  so some of these people i think are are maybe being exposed to sort of normal
[26:37.240 --> 26:40.440]  viruses and are getting sick and maybe those are the hundreds of people that
[26:40.440 --> 26:43.960]  they've they're not really reporting in the news exactly there are hundreds of
[26:43.960 --> 26:48.440]  deaths a day of tuberculosis they even have
[26:48.440 --> 26:54.120]  deaths from leprosy in mexico city there's all sorts of people
[26:54.120 --> 26:58.360]  dying of just toxins for those that don't know
[26:58.360 --> 27:02.280]  there's 35 million people in the metro area 28 million in the city limits
[27:02.280 --> 27:07.240]  itself largest city in the world and
[27:07.240 --> 27:13.960]  literal open rivers of black sewage when you're there when it's dry there is
[27:13.960 --> 27:17.960]  black dust in the air that is dried human
[27:17.960 --> 27:22.280]  excrement and other things and so it's a perfect incubator isn't it doctor
[27:22.280 --> 27:26.440]  for a deadly flu plus you have so many debilitated
[27:26.440 --> 27:30.200]  people and poor people with about what half the population living in
[27:30.200 --> 27:33.480]  shanty towns yes and and those people who
[27:33.480 --> 27:37.480]  aren't don't have access to adequate medical care in simple things like
[27:37.480 --> 27:41.320]  clean water and good food and even a even a clean place to live
[27:41.320 --> 27:45.320]  so yes it's absolutely a festering sort of pool for that
[27:45.320 --> 27:49.160]  but it kind of wonder alex you know what is it about the u.s government that
[27:49.160 --> 27:51.560]  they're trying to completely destroy the mexican
[27:51.560 --> 27:55.400]  the mexican economy i mean between with the with the irresponsible
[27:55.400 --> 27:58.840]  reporting about the violence that's been going on over the last couple of months
[27:58.840 --> 28:02.200]  and now this whole hullabaloo and this whole big great big hype
[28:02.200 --> 28:05.640]  what what's your take on why that's all happened well that's designed to further
[28:05.640 --> 28:11.000]  collapse mexico under this spp and then have even more illegal aliens come into
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.320]  the u.s to collapse these southern and western states so they
[28:15.320 --> 28:19.160]  can be federalized the spp documents of the judicial
[28:19.160 --> 28:24.600]  watch suit and got from september 2007 in vant Canada in game
[28:24.600 --> 28:28.280]  blueprint for global enslavement covers all of this they say we will use
[28:28.280 --> 28:33.240]  economic collapse pandemic collapse and terror attacks
[28:33.240 --> 28:37.720]  to create the north american union and so out of crises
[28:37.720 --> 28:40.760]  the stronger central government in washington believes
[28:40.760 --> 28:44.440]  this is how they will bring in the north american union
[28:44.440 --> 28:48.600]  well the the the bird flu stuff is certainly all of all of those viruses
[28:48.600 --> 28:52.280]  even normal normal viruses absolutely
[28:52.280 --> 28:58.200]  create a bigger cytokine storm in normal healthy tissue i document
[28:58.200 --> 29:01.960]  all that in my book about in normal tissue how it destroys normal
[29:01.960 --> 29:06.760]  tissue in the presence of of chemicals even in very young persons
[29:06.760 --> 29:10.440]  so if this is some sort of a genetically modified virus which you have to
[29:10.440 --> 29:14.520]  have suspicions about that when you look at birds swine and human h1
[29:14.520 --> 29:19.160]  n1 all kind of mixed together it's no doubt that people who are more
[29:19.160 --> 29:21.720]  toxic and have more toxins in their lung and are more
[29:21.720 --> 29:24.760]  are going to be more susceptible to the effects of any virus
[29:24.760 --> 29:28.120]  including something that you know that's a new wrinkle but i know that i've seen
[29:28.120 --> 29:31.320]  the studies out of china that the toxic waste in the cramped cities
[29:31.320 --> 29:34.120]  and air pollution is tied to the higher death rates
[29:34.120 --> 29:38.520]  you we're not talking about race specific we're talking about mega city
[29:38.520 --> 29:43.960]  toxic load specific bio weapon designer virus could that be yet and will it
[29:43.960 --> 29:47.640]  mutate into a harmless strain or a more deadly strain stay there doctor

[33:39.240 --> 33:43.240]  mexico city listeners uh in south texas uh the
[33:43.240 --> 33:46.280]  edge of central texas north of san Antonio where they've shut down some of
[33:46.280 --> 33:52.760]  the schools uh Reese we'll go to him in a moment
[33:52.760 --> 33:56.360]  but uh we're going back to dr sherry
[33:56.360 --> 34:01.880]  tenpenny who is joining us from Monterey Mexico and she's had a practice
[34:01.880 --> 34:05.880]  and consulted down in mexico so she knows it well
[34:05.880 --> 34:09.960]  obviously she's down there right now as all of this is unfolding a big medical
[34:09.960 --> 34:13.400]  conference there and it was shut down by the
[34:13.400 --> 34:16.680]  Mexican authorities you know they're hundreds of miles away from Mexico's
[34:16.680 --> 34:20.600]  center the epicenter of the outbreak uh
[34:20.600 --> 34:26.040]  dr tenpenny you know that was my next question but let's finish up with the
[34:26.040 --> 34:32.840]  fact that this is seems to be chemical specific flu or that the studies do
[34:32.840 --> 34:36.200]  show that people that are in toxic environments it has a much greater
[34:36.200 --> 34:39.080]  effect on them or obviously people with a rundown
[34:39.080 --> 34:42.600]  immune systems and then just as a layman who's interviewed a lot of medical
[34:42.600 --> 34:44.600]  doctors and virologists over the years and
[34:44.600 --> 34:48.440]  been studying bird flu because i saw the globalist hyping it for the last
[34:48.440 --> 34:54.040]  five six years uh that that this does look like its
[34:54.040 --> 34:57.000]  designer when you've got it not just swine
[34:57.000 --> 35:00.600]  human and pig all together and that it happens to be
[35:00.600 --> 35:05.960]  a mutation that actually can affect humans you know most these viruses can't
[35:05.960 --> 35:11.000]  when they mutate and that it's coming out in the non-flu season
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.200]  and that it's coming from an area that the
[35:14.200 --> 35:20.360]  flues don't normally originate from and it's flues from all over the world
[35:20.360 --> 35:26.280]  i mean you start adding all that in i guess a medical doctor could hire a
[35:26.280 --> 35:29.720]  insurance company to do an actuary on this but i bet it's
[35:29.720 --> 35:34.360]  a billion to one or more dr tenpenny can you speak to that specifically
[35:34.360 --> 35:37.720]  yeah i can alex and what's interesting too is what they've what they've been
[35:37.720 --> 35:41.880]  saying in the mexican news down here is that they've been seeing hundreds of
[35:41.880 --> 35:45.160]  people that have been sick over the last three to four weeks
[35:45.160 --> 35:48.520]  and that many of the people when by the time they get into the hospital they
[35:48.520 --> 35:53.720]  got sort of a full-blown pneumonia and they interviewed a doctor on the on
[35:53.720 --> 35:57.160]  the television here last night that he was saying that many of them when they
[35:57.160 --> 36:00.600]  come into the emergency department they go immediately up to the intensive care
[36:00.600 --> 36:04.200]  and get put on a ventilator and that they've been passing away and
[36:04.200 --> 36:07.480]  several doctors i guess have died in some of the big hospitals the way i
[36:07.480 --> 36:10.520]  understand like young interns people that were exposed
[36:10.520 --> 36:15.400]  and taking care of these people so so i do believe that this is whatever a
[36:15.400 --> 36:20.520]  virus this is it's highly virulent if you combine it with other things just
[36:20.520 --> 36:23.640]  like any other type of virus you know that there's
[36:23.640 --> 36:27.320]  tens of thousands of people or millions of people every year that are exposed
[36:27.320 --> 36:30.760]  to garden variety influenza and they don't even get sick
[36:30.760 --> 36:34.200]  so there has to be an in my opinion an underlying
[36:34.200 --> 36:38.600]  combination of things that allows you to be susceptible to
[36:38.600 --> 36:42.680]  weaponized or non-weaponized or even garden variety than influenza
[36:42.680 --> 36:46.600]  and the studies that i put in my book when i did the the the bird fool book
[36:46.600 --> 36:50.920]  called foul it's not what you think um i the premise was why is this
[36:50.920 --> 36:54.360]  starting in southeast asia and it led me into looking at the dioxin
[36:54.360 --> 36:57.880]  toxicities there the agent orange sort of combinations the
[36:57.880 --> 37:01.800]  filth that's in china and in indonesia and all of southeast asia
[37:01.800 --> 37:05.640]  and it was looking at the birds of how they live with their chickens
[37:05.640 --> 37:09.640]  and there was a theory that i put forth and then it's that it was because of
[37:09.640 --> 37:13.880]  the combination of influenza dioxin and other chemicals that was causing
[37:13.880 --> 37:17.320]  these people to have virulent cases of of bird flu
[37:17.320 --> 37:20.120]  and then i actually found out of the medical literature
[37:20.120 --> 37:25.320]  um support to support that scientific support for that premise
[37:25.320 --> 37:29.400]  why do you think the 1918 flu that killed more than 40 million people worldwide
[37:29.400 --> 37:33.400]  started at a u.s. military base and why did the 76 bird flu
[37:33.400 --> 37:37.880]  started a u.s. military base is that a connection to bio weapon
[37:37.880 --> 37:41.320]  oh i think it's two things i think that there's two separate answers there one
[37:41.320 --> 37:45.240]  is in both of those instances those populations are highly vaccinated
[37:45.240 --> 37:48.920]  i mean they go into the they go into the service they get popped with everything
[37:48.920 --> 37:52.840]  including doubles and triples of things and so it's a vaccine reaction we know
[37:52.840 --> 37:56.680]  in 76 when they as you know doctor tried to give the public the swine flu it
[37:56.680 --> 38:00.120]  killed a bunch of people and gillian we're a bernay's go ahead
[38:00.120 --> 38:05.000]  yes and so i think that part of it is a you know you you've created a susceptible
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.440]  population by vaccinating them with all these toxic vaccines
[38:08.440 --> 38:11.880]  in the book i talk an awful lot about in the 1918
[38:11.880 --> 38:18.840]  bird pandemic influenza that happened um that world war one was a chemical
[38:18.840 --> 38:22.920]  warfare there were almost 30 different types of chemicals that were used in
[38:22.920 --> 38:26.120]  the front line including mustard gas and all these other things
[38:26.120 --> 38:29.400]  that the u.s. military was but way behind
[38:29.400 --> 38:33.560]  on developing gas masks and all these other things and by the way these were
[38:33.560 --> 38:36.520]  returning troops and i've seen the studies as well
[38:36.520 --> 38:39.480]  uh that you're reporting on i can i can back you up doctor
[38:39.480 --> 38:44.040]  the returning troops at bases are then given inoculations
[38:44.040 --> 38:49.400]  and then it starts spreading go ahead yeah and they were exposed to tons megatons
[38:49.400 --> 38:53.320]  of mustard gas and brought in a whole bunch of other types of chemicals in
[38:53.320 --> 38:57.160]  the front line of war when they went across the ocean in very adverse
[38:57.160 --> 39:00.280]  packed tight conditions that they've been vaccinated
[39:00.280 --> 39:03.400]  started to get sick packed tight conditions go over to europe
[39:03.400 --> 39:07.240]  get exposed to all the the thousands tens of thousands of tons
[39:07.240 --> 39:10.440]  of chemicals that were happening in the air with inadequate equipment so it's
[39:10.440 --> 39:14.920]  just like methamphetamine heads that are using street methamphetamine filled
[39:14.920 --> 39:17.960]  with gritty art of your reagents and heavy metals
[39:17.960 --> 39:21.080]  because of the dirty way it's produced on the street
[39:21.080 --> 39:24.520]  that's why they can get hiv and the virus kills them
[39:24.520 --> 39:27.800]  because they've already had their immune system destroyed whereas a healthy
[39:27.800 --> 39:31.640]  person can be exposed to hiv hundreds of times and not contracted is that what
[39:31.640 --> 39:35.320]  you're saying absolutely you know alex i say all the time
[39:35.320 --> 39:41.160]  health is an inside out phenomenon and our absolute terror and of germs and
[39:41.160 --> 39:44.840]  this whole thing about the germ theory that needs to absolutely go away
[39:44.840 --> 39:47.640]  because the health is an inside out phenomenon
[39:47.640 --> 39:51.720]  and and and you can't create a five hundred billion dollar a year
[39:51.720 --> 39:55.160]  pharmaceutical industry based on simple things that you need to do to keep
[39:55.160 --> 39:58.520]  yourself healthy well i've seen studies that people
[39:58.520 --> 40:02.840]  that live in mega cities like beijing uh or even london uh or
[40:02.840 --> 40:05.800]  mexico city but just because of what people are breathing
[40:05.800 --> 40:08.920]  there that people live on average eight years less
[40:08.920 --> 40:13.480]  living in a mega city uh so that you know the old cliche of clean country living
[40:13.480 --> 40:16.280]  really does really does have something to it
[40:16.280 --> 40:19.480]  absolutely you know things like you know fresh water
[40:19.480 --> 40:23.400]  alkalinizing your body doing detoxification simple things like
[40:23.400 --> 40:26.520]  getting eight and a half hours of sleep every night consistently
[40:26.520 --> 40:30.040]  you know washing your hands but not inappropriately or overdoing it
[40:30.040 --> 40:33.320]  eating good eating good food and trying to avoid gmo stuff
[40:33.320 --> 40:36.760]  i mean all of those things as a health from an inside out phenomenon
[40:36.760 --> 40:39.960]  you know getting lots of vitamin d getting out in the sun sunshine and
[40:39.960 --> 40:42.920]  avoiding all the slathering onto the sunscreens like
[40:42.920 --> 40:46.920]  by piles of chemicals that go in your body i mean the you know the good lord
[40:46.920 --> 40:49.960]  gave us all the stuff we needed here it's humans that have gone along and
[40:49.960 --> 40:53.800]  destroyed it in fact doctor i'm not posing as a doctor
[40:53.800 --> 40:57.080]  myself i go off with the medical reports and what medical doctors are saying
[40:57.080 --> 41:01.400]  just the sun alone i've seen the studies that that's why we see the flues and
[41:01.400 --> 41:05.960]  and and other viruses and bacteria really running rampant in the winter
[41:05.960 --> 41:10.200]  it's not just that we're indoors more we're not getting that sun in our skin
[41:10.200 --> 41:14.760]  that uh you know literally vitamin d explain that to people vitamin d
[41:14.760 --> 41:18.040]  yeah that makes the vitamin d how our body intrinsically makes vitamin d is
[41:18.040 --> 41:22.120]  the sunshine goes and on your skin it stimulates little cells called melanin
[41:22.120 --> 41:26.120]  melanocytes and that's how you get a suntan and from there there's a whole
[41:26.120 --> 41:29.640]  long process that you create your own internal vitamin d
[41:29.640 --> 41:32.840]  and it's the vitamin d particularly vitamin d3
[41:32.840 --> 41:36.040]  that all the flurry of studies that have been coming out over the last
[41:36.040 --> 41:40.120]  several months showing that that it's remarkable for almost every type of
[41:40.120 --> 41:43.880]  process in our body and it's the vitamin d that goes down in the winter
[41:43.880 --> 41:47.400]  when the sunshine goes down and allows the flu viruses to come up
[41:47.400 --> 41:51.080]  yes i've seen a lot of those studies too and i really believe that's true
[41:51.080 --> 41:54.360]  okay let's get back into the pandemic itself and then i'm going to go to
[41:54.360 --> 41:58.920]  reese in uh central texas right on the border of central and south texas just
[41:58.920 --> 42:01.960]  north of san antonio where they have shut down some of the schools he called in
[42:01.960 --> 42:05.640]  on saturday night and uh we'll continue with dr sherry
[42:05.640 --> 42:10.200]  tenpenny all right now now just as a layman throwing the sound
[42:10.200 --> 42:13.640]  if they're saying there's only 2000 cases in mexico
[42:13.640 --> 42:17.160]  and from what i've heard from mexican television and radio
[42:17.160 --> 42:21.480]  and the callers from mexico that they go to local hospitals in not just mexico
[42:21.480 --> 42:24.840]  city but other areas there are people vomiting people sick
[42:24.840 --> 42:28.600]  people uh have all they're saying for the last month are going back into mid
[42:28.600 --> 42:31.320]  march and the mexican government admits it's when it started
[42:31.320 --> 42:34.920]  that everybody they know has been sick callers have said they would say 70
[42:34.920 --> 42:38.280]  percent of their families and friends have been sick so we know when the
[42:38.280 --> 42:41.960]  media says 2000 people have gotten sick that that is
[42:41.960 --> 42:47.000]  that that's a lie uh but in a way that that's really good news isn't it if you
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.400]  have hundreds of thousands or even millions that are sick
[42:49.400 --> 42:53.960]  and then only 103 deaths that shows this is just a regular flu because regular
[42:53.960 --> 42:58.200]  flu is the people that are unhealthy or run down or get dehydrated it kills them
[42:58.200 --> 43:02.600]  uh now now that's on the good side let's hope that's the case on the bad side
[43:02.600 --> 43:05.480]  uh maybe they're covering up the fact that there have been a lot more deaths
[43:05.480 --> 43:08.840]  and we're seeing some indicators of this uh and that it's mutated and the
[43:08.840 --> 43:12.200]  government knows this and that's why they're starting to lock things down
[43:12.200 --> 43:14.760]  so we have to look at every angle and i'll be doing that with other guests
[43:14.760 --> 43:17.480]  throughout the show today kind of the good the bad and the ugly
[43:17.480 --> 43:21.640]  and i know it's too early to tell doctor but i mean clearly it's they're lying
[43:21.640 --> 43:25.400]  about it only being 2000 people sick or uh
[43:25.400 --> 43:29.000]  alex it may be that only bit that they're they're saying there's 2000 people
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.200]  sick because those 2000 people were the ones that were sick enough to seek
[43:32.200 --> 43:35.240]  medical care you know there may be millions of other
[43:35.240 --> 43:39.160]  people just like when the bird flu was happening back in 2006 that there were
[43:39.160 --> 43:41.720]  tens of thousands maybe even millions of people
[43:41.720 --> 43:45.480]  that were sick but not sick enough to go to the doctor and get care
[43:45.480 --> 43:49.080]  and so what you don't really know what that that denominator is
[43:49.080 --> 43:52.440]  you can't predict what a death rate's going to be if the numerators
[43:52.440 --> 43:55.560]  you know 200 in the bottom denominator is a million
[43:55.560 --> 43:59.720]  well then it's insignificant what about mexican what about mexican doctors
[43:59.720 --> 44:04.120]  telling the bbc and myself uh that it's it's
[44:04.120 --> 44:07.560]  at least 20 dead per hospital in and around mexico sitting in that the
[44:07.560 --> 44:11.400]  number was way above 200 as of as of saturday
[44:11.400 --> 44:15.160]  again it's a very skewed perspective it's you know they're looking at the
[44:15.160 --> 44:17.800]  sickest of the sick who've made it to the hospital and
[44:17.800 --> 44:20.840]  and probably came to the hospital because they were so sick they couldn't stay at
[44:20.840 --> 44:24.120]  home anymore and so they i'm sure that the
[44:24.120 --> 44:27.080]  numbers they're saying may be in the realm of true
[44:27.080 --> 44:30.680]  but that's i think that that's a skewed perspective
[44:30.680 --> 44:33.720]  okay why would the government say they're having that many deaths it's not a big
[44:33.720 --> 44:37.000]  deal but then do the opposite and lock everything down and
[44:37.000 --> 44:40.440]  you know cancel all public events because what they're
[44:40.440 --> 44:44.120]  because what they're doing is they're following cdc guidelines and recommendations
[44:44.120 --> 44:47.480]  down here and they actually even said that when they canceled the conference
[44:47.480 --> 44:52.680]  today that the cdc guidelines are to stay away from crowded spaces
[44:52.680 --> 44:56.520]  don't have be congregated all together and so that's what they're kind of
[44:56.520 --> 45:00.120]  doing so they're following the american medical hype
[45:00.120 --> 45:03.320]  and because they don't want to be accused of not doing that
[45:03.320 --> 45:06.760]  and then causing more of a problem so they're they're they are playing the
[45:06.760 --> 45:10.520]  game safe and going on the on the side of safety and following
[45:10.520 --> 45:15.080]  what the rules are being set by the cdc
[45:15.080 --> 45:18.360]  and i guess if they're going to ban all public events they can't uh
[45:18.360 --> 45:23.160]  just selectively enforce it so they're this must be devastating the tourism
[45:23.160 --> 45:27.800]  industry down in mexico and business itself yes devastating it
[45:27.800 --> 45:31.400]  it's devastating it you know that the first devastation was the
[45:31.400 --> 45:34.840]  irresponsible reporting of the violence yes it was happening but it was not
[45:34.840 --> 45:38.440]  responsibly being reported during that time i was actually living in
[45:38.440 --> 45:41.560]  rosarito and could have told you a whole lot about that
[45:41.560 --> 45:45.720]  and so in now what they're doing is even places like cancun and portavoyarta
[45:45.720 --> 45:48.680]  and acapulco which aren't anywhere near any of these places
[45:48.680 --> 45:51.880]  are all these people are loading up and they're packing up their luggage and
[45:51.880 --> 45:55.160]  going home for no good reason
[45:55.160 --> 45:58.440]  right during talking about shutting down you know different airlines are saying
[45:58.440 --> 46:02.440]  they're going to do checks at the border and and it's like holy cow
[46:02.440 --> 46:05.880]  that's my next question people that sit that sit in the backdrop and say
[46:05.880 --> 46:09.480]  and laugh at this and go gosh it doesn't take a whole lot to just push a button
[46:09.480 --> 46:12.920]  to make all the little sheep just run around like chickens without a head
[46:12.920 --> 46:16.200]  absolutely what do you think of napolitana the homeland security head
[46:16.200 --> 46:20.440]  saying well this this she said even if this goes away in a few weeks there's
[46:20.440 --> 46:23.960]  going to be another worse one soon how could she make statements like that i
[46:23.960 --> 46:27.160]  mean they're clearly loving the fear and the control
[46:27.160 --> 46:30.120]  and using this to sell their martial law grid
[46:30.120 --> 46:34.280]  absolutely alex and i'll tell you back in 2005 and 2006
[46:34.280 --> 46:38.680]  i went to the first second and third national bird flu summits held in
[46:38.680 --> 46:42.360]  washington dc to get first hand information take my own notes
[46:42.360 --> 46:46.040]  and to to correlate it with what i put in my book foul
[46:46.040 --> 46:51.640]  and they were saying that this is not a matter of if it's when it's when this is
[46:51.640 --> 46:54.840]  going to happen they were saying it point blank blank language i actually wrote
[46:54.840 --> 46:57.000]  several articles about it on the internet
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.520]  so they've known this was coming they've known this is coming
[47:00.520 --> 47:03.880]  and they and and i and i can't say that it's because uh
[47:03.880 --> 47:08.520]  because they were just sort of doing it based on epidemiological or statistics
[47:08.520 --> 47:11.400]  i mean they're privy to stuff that you and i'll never know
[47:11.400 --> 47:15.320]  and for them to be so bold and into continue to train fema
[47:15.320 --> 47:19.240]  homeland security local departments having vaccination drills around the
[47:19.240 --> 47:21.720]  country i mean this has been planned and in the
[47:21.720 --> 47:25.000]  work at least since 2005 and god knows how
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.560]  long before that and dr tim penny medical doctor
[47:27.560 --> 47:31.960]  reporting to us from monorail mexico uh international
[47:31.960 --> 47:37.400]  and respected expert uh on this dr tim penny in mexico right now
[47:37.400 --> 47:40.440]  are you saying that the available evidence shows
[47:40.440 --> 47:45.000]  that this is leaning towards a genetically engineered virus
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.760]  uh and or is this just them hyping a convenient virus for something they know
[47:50.760 --> 47:54.760]  they're going to release in the future i think it's too early to say
[47:54.760 --> 47:57.560]  i do think that there's going to be something that's going to be released
[47:57.560 --> 48:00.760]  and or it's going to be shown that there's there's this is a really
[48:00.760 --> 48:04.200]  unusual virus the evidence of saying it's swine
[48:04.200 --> 48:08.280]  um bird flu and human now they just had a report down here just not too long
[48:08.280 --> 48:10.360]  ago maybe in the last couple of hours saying
[48:10.360 --> 48:13.960]  that's kind of ridiculous this is just an aggressive human virus it's silly to
[48:13.960 --> 48:17.560]  be calling it swine flu and i and i have to agree with that
[48:17.560 --> 48:22.040]  and so um i think that there's a lot of hype that's going on a lot of hysteria
[48:22.040 --> 48:25.480]  it never ceases to amaze me exactly i mean there are hundreds of
[48:25.480 --> 48:28.600]  day dying of tb alone in mexico city and the common cold
[48:28.600 --> 48:33.800]  so why are they hyping it now and how and uh in thousands dying in car accidents
[48:33.800 --> 48:37.240]  and people falling out of out of second story windows and
[48:37.240 --> 48:40.760]  you know there's all sorts of so the question is why are they hyping it now
[48:40.760 --> 48:46.360]  and then napolitano say oh get ready it something big's guaranteed to come soon
[48:46.360 --> 48:49.240]  and now they're in the news saying oh it's going to mutate
[48:49.240 --> 48:55.480]  and remember alex the u.s government in 2005 invested 7.1 billion dollars into
[48:55.480 --> 49:00.600]  new vaccine development so maybe this is a return on investment
[49:00.600 --> 49:04.680]  this is about bio shield this is about bio shield with bio shield we've got to
[49:04.680 --> 49:07.480]  start using all those vaccines that we just put into place
[49:07.480 --> 49:11.800]  and division e remember division e that came out at the end of 2006
[49:11.800 --> 49:16.040]  it was tacked on at the end of the defense appropriation bill
[49:16.040 --> 49:19.640]  that basically says that all they have to do is whisper
[49:19.640 --> 49:23.400]  that this may be bioterrorism and they and the pharmaceutical companies have
[49:23.400 --> 49:26.840]  100 protection and liability for any drug
[49:26.840 --> 49:31.080]  any vaccine anything that comes out to to to uh to be used to get so this is
[49:31.080 --> 49:34.360]  about an industry that literally bank rolls the government and the media with
[49:34.360 --> 49:38.680]  campaign contributions and advertisement half the nightly news ads or drug ads
[49:38.680 --> 49:42.200]  this is just about more of their fear-mongering to then sell everybody
[49:42.200 --> 49:45.640]  getting two three four deadly flu shots a year that actually debilitate your
[49:45.640 --> 49:48.200]  immune system and in many cases give you the flu
[49:48.200 --> 49:53.240]  and and and also use tamiflu now tamiflu i documented in the book that the more
[49:53.240 --> 49:56.200]  you use tamiflu the more resistance the virus has come
[49:56.200 --> 50:01.240]  that by the fourth dose of tamiflu a garden variety influenza virus can be
[50:01.240 --> 50:04.680]  up to 10 million times more resistant to tamiflu
[50:04.680 --> 50:08.280]  than it was before it was exposed to the drug so it's making them resistant
[50:08.280 --> 50:13.400]  just like bacteria with antibiotics exactly exactly
[50:13.400 --> 50:17.400]  okay we've got a lot of phone calls here coming up but in the final segment
[50:17.400 --> 50:19.720]  dr sherry tim penny i want to give out your website for folks that want to
[50:19.720 --> 50:21.560]  learn more i did read your excellent report
[50:21.560 --> 50:25.560]  uh this morning people should see that swine flew the new bird flew
[50:25.560 --> 50:28.840]  and we do have calls from mexico calls from texas we will be getting to those
[50:28.840 --> 50:31.720]  but i wanted to talk to you about the control grid
[50:31.720 --> 50:35.640]  you know it's not a rumor about fema mass graves we have the documents
[50:35.640 --> 50:39.640]  so i want to mention those when we get back is this a beta test to train
[50:39.640 --> 50:43.000]  everybody how to go along and follow orders for the real crisis that's
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.920]  coming why is europe uh testing all americans
[50:46.920 --> 50:50.200]  and mexican flights coming in why are they banning imports from the u.s in
[50:50.200 --> 50:53.640]  mexico this is becoming a worldwide hype fest
[50:53.640 --> 50:58.280]  why is this flu coming out of the western hemisphere and not out of asia as
[50:58.280 --> 51:01.000]  it normally does
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.920]  finally in the news this evening it's being reported that cyber spies from
[51:04.920 --> 51:08.040]  russia and china have now penetrated our power grid
[51:08.040 --> 51:12.120]  even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer
[51:12.120 --> 51:15.400]  to the limits of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's
[51:15.400 --> 51:18.920]  demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its
[51:18.920 --> 51:22.840]  edge creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting
[51:22.840 --> 51:26.040]  us all in the dark are you prepared for the next
[51:26.040 --> 51:30.040]  round of storm related outages or government created blackouts have you
[51:30.040 --> 51:34.040]  ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own
[51:34.040 --> 51:38.120]  private supply of electrical power if so this will be the most important
[51:38.120 --> 51:42.760]  information you have ever heard solar powered generators are finally available
[51:42.760 --> 51:46.120]  they have no moving parts to wear out or break and require
[51:46.120 --> 51:51.400]  absolutely no gas whatsoever remember the government doesn't own the sun so go
[51:51.400 --> 51:57.000]  to my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com check out my solar
[51:57.000 --> 52:01.240]  backup dot com before you lose your power
[52:01.240 --> 52:04.440]  in the new world order is war against humanity
[52:04.440 --> 52:08.920]  barack obama is the tip of the spear we've got to have a civilian national
[52:08.920 --> 52:13.160]  security force that's just as powerful just as strong
[52:13.160 --> 52:18.600]  just as well funded the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama
[52:18.600 --> 52:22.600]  is working for the best interest of the american people while obama's already
[52:22.600 --> 52:26.920]  fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election if you have a demagogue
[52:26.920 --> 52:29.960]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[52:29.960 --> 52:33.640]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[52:33.640 --> 52:37.240]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[52:37.240 --> 52:40.840]  it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government
[52:40.840 --> 52:45.800]  this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told

[54:24.760 --> 54:27.880]  minutes we got calls from texas california canada
[54:27.880 --> 54:32.120]  mexico uh... you name it that are coming up
[54:32.120 --> 54:35.240]  dr sherry tenpenny is our guest you know i have the
[54:35.240 --> 54:38.840]  state of new york department of state division of cemeteries
[54:38.840 --> 54:41.640]  secret document april four two thousand and seven
[54:41.640 --> 54:45.240]  that's up on info wars dot com linked in a story erin dykes did
[54:45.240 --> 54:49.000]  plans for mass graves confirmed government serving cemetery readiness
[54:49.000 --> 54:54.280]  we talked to the city officials in indiana with the illinois officials
[54:54.280 --> 54:57.320]  uh... with fema coming to them saying we want you to harden all the government
[54:57.320 --> 55:02.040]  buildings for terror attack even in rural towns and prepare mass graves for a
[55:02.040 --> 55:05.000]  flu outbreak uh... and that's what this division of
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  cemeteries document says and then i have the executive orders the feds have
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.720]  the state passing uh... in uh...
[55:11.720 --> 55:16.280]  colorado rocky mountain news february two thousand three for mass graves
[55:16.280 --> 55:20.440]  incinerators uh... you name it and under the dark winter top-off drills they
[55:20.440 --> 55:22.440]  admittedly practice locking down cities
[55:22.440 --> 55:26.520]  putting people in sports stadiums and under this new alert that they've
[55:26.520 --> 55:31.720]  issued that's been taking the safety off the system that would engage
[55:31.720 --> 55:35.320]  open physical martial law dr sherry tenpenny
[55:35.320 --> 55:38.920]  well alex i think that the most important part of all of that is that
[55:38.920 --> 55:43.400]  not everybody is going to die and not everybody's going to get sick
[55:43.400 --> 55:46.760]  so the people and i think the people who are more toxic in there
[55:46.760 --> 55:51.160]  in their systems from chemical exposures from genetically modified foods
[55:51.160 --> 55:54.120]  from eating you know mcdonald's trans fat things
[55:54.120 --> 55:57.720]  i think that those and and all the people that are fully vaccinated and have
[55:57.720 --> 55:59.800]  their immune systems all tied up with that
[55:59.800 --> 56:02.200]  are going to be more susceptible whether it's a
[56:02.200 --> 56:06.760]  a a a weaponized sort of flu or not and so that goes back to
[56:06.760 --> 56:10.040]  you know trying to do health from the inside out there's some great books and
[56:10.040 --> 56:13.880]  programs out there about detoxification just quickly doctor i want to
[56:13.880 --> 56:17.480]  uh... interrupt you and while i have you are you still going to be in mexico
[56:17.480 --> 56:20.680]  tomorrow because i'd like to get you back on tomorrow for 30 minutes with a
[56:20.680 --> 56:24.200]  quick report yeah i am in fact my husband and i decided
[56:24.200 --> 56:26.280]  that we're not going to panic and be a bunch of sheep
[56:26.280 --> 56:29.080]  we're going to stay down here till saturday just like our plane tickets
[56:29.080 --> 56:33.640]  were supposed to be um so what time zone are you in right now
[56:33.640 --> 56:38.120]  there in mexico pardon me what time is it in mexico right now where you're at
[56:38.120 --> 56:42.040]  it's noon it's central time here uh huh okay same here we're central standard
[56:42.040 --> 56:46.120]  time how about 1130 again tomorrow perfect
[56:46.120 --> 56:51.480]  okay we'll call you 1130 in closing doctor um what are some things over the
[56:51.480 --> 56:55.000]  counter uh i mean some people have said if you take like elderberry
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.280]  that is a immune booster that could cause
[56:58.280 --> 57:02.200]  the auto risk the auto immune response that's actually killing people
[57:02.200 --> 57:07.560]  uh and you know with some other flows i mean uh is it garlic vitamin c what
[57:07.560 --> 57:09.720]  would you tell people that are afraid to do
[57:09.720 --> 57:13.800]  vitamin c vitamin a is the most amazing antiviral
[57:13.800 --> 57:18.040]  um i think that those two are really great simple things like we already said
[57:18.040 --> 57:21.240]  be sure you get the bed on time the more sleep you can get the more healthy
[57:21.240 --> 57:24.600]  you're going to be um you know those those are really really
[57:24.600 --> 57:27.480]  important stuff that that i think are really important there's a lot of
[57:27.480 --> 57:31.160]  things on my website the drtenpenny.com that gives a lot of
[57:31.160 --> 57:35.720]  information about that and it really a lot of vitamin c
[57:35.720 --> 57:39.400]  vitamin a garlic um some people use colloidal silver
[57:39.400 --> 57:43.480]  some people use homeopathics um there are lots of ways to keep healthy from
[57:43.480 --> 57:48.600]  the inside out absolutely um anything else i mean
[57:48.600 --> 57:52.280]  is is is garlic good is oil of oregano good

[1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:34.200]  confirmed in mexico from the virus with the regular flu kills tens of thousands
[1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:39.080]  a year down there the same in the u.s so why is the media hyping this could be
[1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:42.840]  the big one or is it just more hype in preparation for the global is to launch
[1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:45.000]  a controlled bio weapons release on the public
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:48.120]  they are you genesis they've said they've been planning to do it for a long time
[1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:53.400]  so we have to look at that angle and you just heard a angle that uh was an
[1:00:53.400 --> 1:00:58.040]  optimistic one from dr sherry tin penny medical doctor uh who knows what we're
[1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:01.720]  going to be hearing i would imagine it'll be the dark side of the dark view
[1:01:01.720 --> 1:01:06.680]  from somebody who predicted this just last monday and uh that is of course
[1:01:06.680 --> 1:01:11.080]  steve quail coming up in t minus one hour 59 minutes
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:13.720]  we got paul watson popping in with a british view
[1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:17.160]  or about 10 minutes at the bottom of this hour i want to take a lot of calls
[1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:19.800]  right now and get your take on what's happening and then i'm going to go
[1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:22.200]  through the all the latest news and give you my
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:25.800]  my view on what's going on coming up but right now
[1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:31.160]  let's talk to reese uh calling from just north of san antonio he called saturday
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:34.680]  and broke that they were going to be just suspending class all next week
[1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:37.400]  that was before it was in the news it then came out
[1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:40.520]  uh the next morning that indeed they weren't just suspending it on monday
[1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:44.200]  they were suspending it throughout the week now schools all over south texas
[1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:48.920]  and areas of central texas are shutting down i guess the wicked flea when none
[1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:52.440]  pursue it uh because uh you know you've got 20
[1:01:52.440 --> 1:01:56.760]  cases and then that's always a day old number to probably be more than that
[1:01:56.760 --> 1:02:00.760]  in the united states why all the fear mongering why is the media saying oh
[1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:04.040]  it's going to mutate into something more deadly when i look at the statistics
[1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:07.560]  they normally mutate into something less deadly but we'll look at all angles and
[1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:12.200]  all sides uh go into reese uh in the border of san antonio
[1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:14.840]  they're right in the town where they've have confirmed cases
[1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:20.280]  reese tell us what's happening all right uh not too much has changed here just uh
[1:02:20.280 --> 1:02:24.920]  i got a news report out of the san antonio express news here uh
[1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:29.560]  says linda moses uh thick or both of stunger stick one attend
[1:02:29.560 --> 1:02:33.080]  uh clements high school which is the other high school in this district
[1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:36.520]  uh they have a suspected or confirmed local cases
[1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:41.400]  uh climb to 12 uh i know that one suspected case is that also it's not
[1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:45.960]  12 cases in your town alone and the national us news is
[1:02:45.960 --> 1:02:49.640]  even though they know the san antonio express news says that the national news
[1:02:49.640 --> 1:02:53.960]  is saying 20 cases nationwide we get paul watson or kurt or steve with a
[1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:58.760]  blurb on this what's the headline on that san antonio express news article
[1:02:58.760 --> 1:03:03.720]  okay uh it says let me see here it's that uh my essay news dot com
[1:03:03.720 --> 1:03:08.120]  it's just a little blog comment and uh says that the uc closes all schools and
[1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:12.520]  it just has that slower well given that acronym again slowly
[1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:16.360]  okay it's uh fc uc isb closes all schools
[1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:20.200]  that's the name of the uh sc uc closes all schools
[1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:27.800]  fc uc isb that's short civil universal city isb and that closes all schools
[1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:31.320]  and uh looks like there's actually another
[1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:34.680]  suspected case that the school that my mom actually teaches that
[1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:40.520]  that's kind of scary uh but you know i think people around here are starting
[1:03:40.520 --> 1:03:43.480]  actually start to take this a little seriously
[1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:47.320]  and uh you know people are uh they're just
[1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:50.440]  they're not as in a sort of haze like they were on saturday when i called you
[1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:54.200]  kind of in a panic well the issue here is
[1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:59.160]  we should be concerned because this global government and the cdc
[1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:03.720]  are you genesis have a stage chemical biological radiological attacks on
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:06.840]  people worldwide they have killed troops and foster
[1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:11.240]  children and others in test this is on record the government
[1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:16.440]  weaponized anthrax was mailed out to george bush's enemies the the
[1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:20.120]  white house admitted the whole cabinet was on cipro the anthrax fighting
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:24.440]  antibiotic before it even broke out so they have this past history
[1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:28.680]  they're preparing with mass graves for this and so the fact that they're
[1:04:28.680 --> 1:04:31.560]  saying it's such a big danger and hyping it
[1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:35.480]  is why we're having to look at it but if you really only had a hundred
[1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:41.000]  deaths in mexico uh regular flu kills people so this is high
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.880]  so we don't know you stay there i want to hear stay there i want to hear more

[1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:45.240]  local cases of swine flu climbed to 12 now they're still saying in the
[1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:49.880]  national news on drudge everywhere else 20 cases in the us
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:55.320]  one outbreak just south of me 45 miles from where i sit
[1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:59.320]  has 12 the district also canceled today's
[1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:02.680]  planned public meeting at steel high school

[1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:17.800]  do you need to add sir just one more thing uh i'm a
[1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:20.440]  i'm a regular at the prison planet forums and they all they all brought up a
[1:09:20.440 --> 1:09:24.440]  good point here and that's uh where do kim trail's factor in the equation
[1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:28.040]  because i know you're talking with a doctor about lower immune systems in
[1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:30.920]  mexico has possibly been widespread so fast
[1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:33.640]  and we know that there's heavy metals in these kim trail
[1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:37.720]  so they've been spraying us so long what she was saying was that the well we
[1:09:37.720 --> 1:09:40.760]  know barium salts and aluminum oxide and all this
[1:09:40.760 --> 1:09:45.080]  lowers immune system that is a very interesting point
[1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:48.520]  if there's an excellent point reese the prison planet forum
[1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:51.640]  for that yeah we need to link to some of the prison
[1:09:51.640 --> 1:09:54.600]  planet forum articles that people are writing and compiling and putting
[1:09:54.600 --> 1:09:58.040]  together you know i was doing searches saturday
[1:09:58.040 --> 1:10:02.440]  for our special report trying to find the fake newscast
[1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:06.440]  that nightline did in 2002 where they just started out with a newscast saying
[1:10:06.440 --> 1:10:09.880]  we've been attacked with smallpox people are dying martial law they showed
[1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:14.280]  footage of real riots after hurricanes and real looting and people
[1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:17.560]  panicked and it was meant to be a psyop then at the end of the show they said
[1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:20.680]  oh this was just a drill and then they did it the next four nights
[1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:24.920]  as the as things unfolded continuing to announce it as if it was real
[1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:28.280]  i taped that when it was on and by the second night
[1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:31.320]  and i obviously can't find it in all our storage buildings and the rest of it
[1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:34.600]  used to be just me around here so it's all a big jumbled mess but
[1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:38.680]  i couldn't find that on youtube or google but i did find something i've never
[1:10:38.680 --> 1:10:42.360]  seen now i knew they did dark winter
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:47.080]  that cue that up please that video i knew they did dark winter i talk about
[1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:51.080]  that in my famous july 25th tv show where i say call the white house tell them
[1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:53.720]  don't stage terror attacks in the world trade center and blame it on their asset
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:56.840]  of some have been lied and i read the ap article
[1:10:56.840 --> 1:11:00.200]  about dark winter about martial law in texas and oklahoma
[1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:04.680]  because of smallpox breaking out so i had the drill article in july
[1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:08.520]  from june when they did the drill here is the june drill
[1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:13.160]  by homeland security we're gonna play this again later it's so important
[1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:16.760]  i didn't get to it all yesterday at the end of the show the sunday show
[1:11:16.760 --> 1:11:21.720]  here is the drill homeland security puts it on that didn't exist supposedly
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:26.920]  till 2002 and in it
[1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:29.960]  they're saying saddam hussein's working with the taliban and al qaeda in
[1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:33.240]  afghanistan and we've got to hit them for attacking us see they were already
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:37.400]  they showed these fake newscasts to different universities and medical
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:41.640]  groups they showed it to the feds and local first responders to scare them
[1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:45.160]  into taking smallpox shots which they then refuse to do as you know but this
[1:11:45.160 --> 1:11:48.680]  was all preparatory you can see how premeditated
[1:11:48.680 --> 1:11:51.720]  and wicked all of this is so that's coming up later
[1:11:51.720 --> 1:11:55.400]  another big issue is i've forgotten about this and all my bird flu research
[1:11:55.400 --> 1:11:58.280]  all the doctors would interview a doctor sherry 1020 just
[1:11:58.280 --> 1:12:02.120]  talked about this medical doctor it's proven that tamafluh
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:06.360]  owned by rumsfeld the bushes and obama's got a big stake in it
[1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:10.520]  who's stock soaring right now that tamafluh when you take it
[1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:16.360]  does knock out the virus but causes it to only be a certain mutations that
[1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:19.640]  survive so it makes it that much more powerful and resistant
[1:12:19.640 --> 1:12:24.120]  just like antibiotics with bacteria so you've got people worldwide buying
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:29.480]  tamafluh all this all the people that are
[1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:32.920]  you know who medicalize everything all the people
[1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:37.000]  they're scared all the hypochondriacs and i don't blame you i was never a
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.720]  hypochondriac once you have children you kind of become a hypochondriac for
[1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:43.000]  them you know you love them so much and they're putting them on tamafluh
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.840]  everywhere which then if they've got any other regular flu viruses in them that
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:50.840]  people come and contact with every day folks you come and connect with flu and
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:54.200]  and uh regular cold viruses and everything else
[1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:58.120]  and your body defeats it well this thing mutates them and makes them that much
[1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:01.480]  stronger so everybody's gobbling this that's why so many deadly
[1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:05.160]  bacteria come out of latin america because they sell
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:09.400]  antibiotics like candy there and people are always gobbling it for viral
[1:13:09.400 --> 1:13:12.120]  infections which makes the bacteria that much stronger
[1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:14.920]  oh yeah let's run through a bunch of calls here

[1:16:18.040 --> 1:16:20.600]  and says oh i don't like the new world order the people aren't gonna like
[1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:22.840]  hearing about the new world order of the g20
[1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:26.200]  so we are the majority it's just that people
[1:16:26.200 --> 1:16:30.200]  arrogantly are disrespecting you just keep warning them
[1:16:30.200 --> 1:16:33.880]  you're only trying to save them and and and have enough for you already have
[1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:36.680]  enough respect for yourself more than most to be bold
[1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:39.800]  that's the first step the other step is not caring
[1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:44.600]  uh and just to continue what you're doing but go ahead randy
[1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:49.160]  it's the youth have if the if the if the older people are not going to wake up
[1:16:49.160 --> 1:16:53.000]  it's up to the youth to take over to take the baton
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:56.120]  and continue the fight because if if the old people are already come out
[1:16:56.120 --> 1:17:00.200]  compartmentalized they can't understand young people with the fresh queen
[1:17:00.200 --> 1:17:03.560]  state they'll be able to wake up and take the system down
[1:17:03.560 --> 1:17:08.840]  look it's always the young that are instrumental in any renaissance or
[1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:15.160]  awakening or enlightenment and most people
[1:17:15.160 --> 1:17:18.680]  whether young or old have been mesmerized by the television or kind of
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:21.960]  in a comfort zone it's hard to shock them out of that
[1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:24.840]  and it always looks like you're not having an effect until the whole thing
[1:17:24.840 --> 1:17:28.840]  collapses believe me we're having victories they're
[1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:33.640]  canceling trans texas nafta highways they're having to back off on gun bands

[1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:20.360]  okay i got a lot of medical workers and other people calling in and i got
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:25.160]  two different phone systems here who is the medical worker in texas is that
[1:24:25.160 --> 1:24:29.320]  jesse okay let's go to jesse in texas jesse
[1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:33.720]  you're on the air go ahead alex yes sir
[1:24:33.720 --> 1:24:38.120]  honored to speak with you uh hey uh you know it was just going to check in with
[1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:42.520]  yeah i work in public health at the county level uh
[1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:47.000]  we're in as much as the dark is uh most people i couldn't tell you if this is
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:51.240]  the worst public health situation since the black plague
[1:24:51.240 --> 1:24:55.720]  or uh if this is just something like the common cold or something
[1:24:55.720 --> 1:24:58.840]  like we're out of the loop nobody prepared for it
[1:24:58.840 --> 1:25:02.600]  no one seems to know what they're supposed to be doing especially at some
[1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:06.040]  of some of the municipal level that we're
[1:25:06.040 --> 1:25:10.360]  that we work with uh the state guys seem to know
[1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:14.040]  what's going on the the people that i'm working at with the department of state
[1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:18.120]  health services i haven't heard anything out of the fed
[1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:23.400]  haven't heard anything uh from our uh you know county judge or anything it's
[1:25:23.400 --> 1:25:27.400]  just there's a real disarray in the face of this and i don't know if it's a
[1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:30.760]  reflection that it's some big overwhelming problem that people
[1:25:30.760 --> 1:25:34.040]  don't know what to do or on some level people just aren't
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:38.520]  taking it seriously or what it is well let's be rational about this i mean
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:43.080]  i've pulled the numbers up anybody can google it i just say us deaths per year
[1:25:43.080 --> 1:25:46.680]  from flu and the numbers vary from 15 000 on the
[1:25:46.680 --> 1:25:51.720]  low end to 35 000 in a bad flu year from the
[1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:55.320]  cdc so we got 103 people confirmed dead in
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:25:59.560]  mexico from this uh it's now spreading in the united states
[1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:03.080]  and if you've got hundreds and hundreds of thousands infected in mexico
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:07.800]  then it's no big deal now if the media is right and the mexican government's
[1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:10.600]  telling the truth that there's only 2 000 cases
[1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:14.440]  and it's killed a hundred and something people out of those this is
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:19.080]  really deadly flu with a very high mortality rate
[1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:22.920]  so and i think the fact that it's a sorry go ahead
[1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:27.960]  i'm sorry too uh i'm sorry my phone is even here i think it's uh
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:34.440]  i think dying that it'll charge up here uh you know i don't do a lot of
[1:26:34.440 --> 1:26:37.960]  international work but i have occasionally come into contact with my
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:42.280]  peers in in mexico my gut feeling when i hear those
[1:26:42.280 --> 1:26:46.440]  numbers is those are only people that have been tracked
[1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:51.160]  by the official public health organizations in mexico the deaths and
[1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:54.360]  even the deaths are a little bit up in the air that's under deaths that we're
[1:26:54.360 --> 1:26:58.360]  hearing thrown around but just that the cases mine
[1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:01.720]  my guess would be there are many thousands more
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:05.320]  suffering from this flu now whether it's their suffering
[1:27:05.320 --> 1:27:08.760]  standard flu symptoms or whether they're on the brink of death
[1:27:08.760 --> 1:27:13.320]  i don't know i do know that information is notoriously unreliable there that
[1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:16.760]  there are some cultural factors there in mexico that people do not
[1:27:16.760 --> 1:27:20.280]  cooperate when the survey takers come around let alone
[1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:23.880]  you know they think they're sick and it's just a different country down there
[1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:26.600]  and they have a different attitude about dealing you know here people run into
[1:27:26.600 --> 1:27:30.680]  the the hospital because they're you know i have a hangnail or something cdc
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:33.880]  probably has hangnail figures that they can share with you
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:37.640]  but mexico is not that way people kind of mistrust
[1:27:37.640 --> 1:27:41.240]  is authority to some extent because there's no reason to trust authority in
[1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:46.280]  mexico right i mean it's just uh i suspect the numbers of deaths
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:49.960]  are higher and i suspect the number of people that have them are higher and
[1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:53.480]  and it'll be months before we really get a clear picture of what what went on
[1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:56.760]  down yeah i think i think a lot of medical experts are concerned because
[1:27:56.760 --> 1:28:03.720]  this thing is this trans mutagenic uh virus that's got animal human
[1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:07.000]  but not just one animal but lots of different human
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  a variant of a dna pieces uh from human flu and then pig flu you know swine
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:16.760]  flu and the bird flu and that it's killing young people
[1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:20.120]  mirrors the 1918 outbreak that killed 40 plus million
[1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:27.800]  but as dr tenpenny just said uh toxic chemicals in the environment
[1:28:27.800 --> 1:28:31.480]  are linked to win in the presence of just a regular flu
[1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:35.400]  killing young people so i think this is opening up in the year and we're going
[1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:38.120]  to watch it in the next few days and just pray
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:41.880]  uh that uh it turns out to not be a big deal but the
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:45.240]  huge response by government means they're either capitalizing on this to
[1:28:45.240 --> 1:28:48.120]  fearmonger or they're fearmongering because
[1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:52.040]  they don't know what's going to happen or with this federal government's
[1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:56.360]  history or other government's history uh this could be a bio weapon
[1:28:56.360 --> 1:28:59.000]  release it couldn't mutate as the associated
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:01.240]  press doctors uh that they're talking to are saying
[1:29:01.240 --> 1:29:05.400]  into something more deadly as tens of thousands of people worldwide have it
[1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:08.520]  mutating in their bodies it could mutate into something harmless
[1:29:08.520 --> 1:29:12.120]  it'll probably mutate into lots of different variants we just don't know
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:15.640]  and so let's just hope and pray this is hype hope for the best prepare for the
[1:29:15.640 --> 1:29:20.440]  worst but again uh oil of oregano uh
[1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:25.080]  people need to get vitamin a vitamin c five thousand units
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:28.680]  people need to get lots of sleep those are the basics uh what health department
[1:29:28.680 --> 1:29:31.640]  area are you with i mean just in a general area are you in south texas

[1:30:08.840 --> 1:30:12.360]  the economy is hurting even though there are powers that would make us believe
[1:30:12.360 --> 1:30:16.200]  differently banks are failing and the gold buyers are buying
[1:30:16.200 --> 1:30:19.880]  question with all the chemicals being put into our air

[1:31:04.440 --> 1:31:09.000]  barack obama is the tip of the spear we've got to have a civilian national
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:13.160]  security force that's just as powerful just as strong
[1:31:13.160 --> 1:31:18.120]  just as well funded the obama deception completely destroys the myth that
[1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:21.240]  obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[1:31:21.240 --> 1:31:25.720]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election
[1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:29.400]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[1:31:29.400 --> 1:31:33.720]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[1:31:33.720 --> 1:31:37.320]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[1:31:37.320 --> 1:31:40.840]  it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government
[1:31:40.840 --> 1:31:45.800]  this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told

[1:32:04.600 --> 1:32:07.720]  hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[1:32:07.720 --> 1:32:11.080]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[1:32:11.080 --> 1:32:14.680]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about performing gold and
[1:32:14.680 --> 1:32:18.280]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[1:32:18.280 --> 1:32:22.120]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[1:32:22.120 --> 1:32:25.800]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank
[1:32:25.800 --> 1:32:29.480]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food

[1:32:53.560 --> 1:32:57.480]  in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[1:32:57.480 --> 1:33:06.760]  this is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com
[1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:36.760]  let's hope this isn't an inside job
[1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:47.960]  in the united kingdom on a atlantic view on this
[1:33:49.240 --> 1:33:52.200]  and we're gonna go to the phone banks at genesis and the phone banks down here in
[1:33:52.200 --> 1:33:55.240]  austin texas try to give each caller a minute or
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:33:58.120]  so so we get to everybody
[1:33:58.680 --> 1:34:02.600]  coming up in an hour dr. degels gonna pop in and then we've got jeff for a full
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:07.080]  hour steve quail who last monday said he was getting intel about a staged
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:12.200]  flu outbreak talking about nailing it so um
[1:34:12.200 --> 1:34:15.320]  and i get confused i know he talked about it wasn't on his show i was on the
[1:34:15.320 --> 1:34:17.480]  thursday before that or wasn't on monday
[1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:20.440]  somebody ought to go to listen to his show we did thursday before and then
[1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:23.320]  monday i know he said it on one of them
[1:34:23.320 --> 1:34:28.360]  and i've been telling you to the cards for him to state something like this but
[1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:32.280]  mexico is on the verge of collapse politically so they this certainly in
[1:34:32.280 --> 1:34:34.920]  mexico's brought this up before i even made the point on there i wasn't going
[1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:39.800]  to say it but people are emailing and calling making the point from mexico
[1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:43.160]  that this lets the state kind of shut down any revolution down there
[1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:46.120]  everybody forgets what they're doing they're worried about dying
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:52.680]  again this is a way over response for a hundred people dead
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:55.880]  i mean hundreds and hundreds and i pull up the numbers they have over 300 deaths
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:34:59.720]  a day on average in mexico from tuberculosis
[1:34:59.720 --> 1:35:03.160]  most of them in mexico's city i mean they've got all people are dying a
[1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:06.120]  common clothe a call by the hundreds every day in mexico's city
[1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:13.800]  there are 30 plus million people in there right in that valley
[1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:17.960]  formerly the seat of the aztec empire
[1:35:17.960 --> 1:35:23.960]  matozuma so what's going on down there you know the
[1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:28.360]  the these plagues normally come out of asia every major flu comes out of asia
[1:35:28.360 --> 1:35:32.680]  now it's coming out of mexico's city and it's a mix of flues from all over the
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:38.360]  world animal and human uh... coming up in just a moment we're going to paul
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:43.480]  this is a ap headline of the french age the french news agency excuse me afp
[1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:46.440]  swine flu virus may cause global pandemic u n chief
[1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:51.480]  so the fear mongering is going into high gear
[1:35:51.480 --> 1:35:55.160]  well it's just hope this isn't the case but uh...
[1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:58.680]  regardless i got a bad feeling about all this is that because there's going to
[1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:01.080]  use this for more of a crackdown more of a police state
[1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:05.240]  shades of things to come well then the poletano comes out sunday
[1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:08.840]  and says oh yeah this this may go away but another big one
[1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:12.760]  is coming very cryptically don't worry there it's going to happen what does that
[1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:15.960]  mean that's out of reuters headline
[1:36:15.960 --> 1:36:21.240]  the poletano says u.s should prepare for new flu outbreak
[1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:26.920]  the poletano says u.s should prepare for another flu outbreak soon even if this
[1:36:26.920 --> 1:36:29.320]  one fizzles out
[1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:33.400]  um i did want to remind all the listeners that we need to stop procrastinating
[1:36:33.400 --> 1:36:37.480]  barack obama is the tip of the new world order spirit
[1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:40.840]  the open borders the gun control by the way
[1:36:40.840 --> 1:36:44.920]  uh... guns of america's reported they're trying to sign a treaty
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:48.120]  that will and it's in the language ban all reloading
[1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:50.920]  in the united states that news is off the chart in fact
[1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:54.760]  that is in my stack remind me to cover that next hour guys
[1:36:54.760 --> 1:36:58.920]  and write a note on that cover guns even though this is going on
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:02.840]  we have got to expose obama is working for the bankers
[1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:06.680]  and of course the film is nonpartisan we show how bush helped engineer the
[1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:09.640]  banker takeover and how obama's people helped
[1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:13.240]  write the banker takeover and how paulson and geitner and all them work
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:18.200]  together and how it's seamless integration
[1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:21.320]  i get these stupid emails from liberals and right wingers going wait a minute
[1:37:21.320 --> 1:37:25.480]  your film's exposing bush and obama and and and you know the banker takeover
[1:37:25.480 --> 1:37:28.840]  started with bush yes i know that's what we say in clear
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:32.840]  english that's the whole point they're one group
[1:37:32.840 --> 1:37:36.520]  they work with each other it's good cop bad cop
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:40.520]  yes that's what i'm saying we have to get past the presidents and realize
[1:37:40.520 --> 1:37:43.960]  they're just frontman that's what the whole film is about
[1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:48.680]  that it's by partisan and if we wake people up to that they can stop dividing
[1:37:48.680 --> 1:37:53.160]  us along left right lines so that's why the obama deception
[1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:56.600]  needs to be seen because people have never heard this they don't understand
[1:37:56.600 --> 1:37:59.480]  this this is how it works it's what the big political

[1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:05.720]  this is how the world operates and and most the public is caught up in
[1:38:05.720 --> 1:38:08.760]  fairy tales and so that's why nothing changes
[1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:13.400]  you expose the false reality the matrix like

[1:42:16.920 --> 1:42:20.200]  uh but uh the big point that that doctor
[1:42:20.200 --> 1:42:24.600]  um tim penny pointed out earlier is that tamaflu
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:28.520]  only leaves the resistant stronger strains of the flu
[1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:32.120]  alive just like antibiotics only make the strongest bacteria survive
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:34.920]  and everybody's gobbling this stuff all over the world right now so that can
[1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:38.840]  mute that accelerates their mutations right there alone she was saying
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:41.480]  they can mutate into something deadly can mutate into something that in the
[1:42:41.480 --> 1:42:44.840]  problem uh paul watson what's your
[1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:48.280]  gut on this i always like your basic analysis
[1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:51.960]  what what's your gut on this right now it's too soon to be able to be concrete
[1:42:51.960 --> 1:42:55.960]  in any of this what's your bottom line here
[1:42:55.960 --> 1:42:59.800]  well that's right alex i mean there's a vacuum of information
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:05.240]  there's a disconnect between what's happening in mexico and what's happening
[1:43:05.240 --> 1:43:10.440]  in the united states um in the fact that there have been no deaths
[1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:16.200]  whatsoever in the united states yet now they're saying 150 in mexico
[1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:24.360]  um my gut is that it's a hoax and i'm going on the fact that in 1976
[1:43:24.360 --> 1:43:28.440]  something very similar happened obviously it was a different strain
[1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:32.040]  but it was related to swine flu we've got a
[1:43:32.040 --> 1:43:38.200]  story posted on prismplanet.com from 1976 where
[1:43:38.200 --> 1:43:43.160]  ron paul comments on what happened and he called it at the time quote an evil
[1:43:43.160 --> 1:43:48.040]  political maneuver and what happened was basically
[1:43:48.040 --> 1:43:53.880]  some uh soldiers at fort dick's got ill and it turned out to be swine flu and
[1:43:53.880 --> 1:43:58.440]  this led to uh gerald ford at the time and donald rumsfeld
[1:43:58.440 --> 1:44:02.360]  by the way linked by the will start over interrupted this is key by the way
[1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:06.600]  linked to their vaccines and it wasn't really swine flu it was some bad reaction
[1:44:06.600 --> 1:44:10.680]  just like this stuff always breaks out at military bases go ahead
[1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:15.160]  and on the back of that rumsfeld led the charge along with others in that
[1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:20.280]  administration to get the entire population of the united states vaccinated
[1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:24.760]  against swine flu and it turned out that of the small
[1:44:24.760 --> 1:44:28.920]  minority who did end up taking the vaccine hundreds were injured and 56
[1:44:28.920 --> 1:44:32.600]  died and uh ron paul by the way that's a white wash
[1:44:32.600 --> 1:44:36.840]  over 500 people the government admits got gillian berets and auto immune
[1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:40.280]  disorder from it that is pure bull the real number and i looked at the studies
[1:44:40.280 --> 1:44:44.280]  was in the thousands of dead but go ahead but of course the medical system
[1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:48.360]  that forced the shots on people it's going to want to cover things up but
[1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:53.880]  their internal documents to take on sv 40 and the polio vaccine is 198 million
[1:44:53.880 --> 1:44:58.200]  getting a deadly cancer virus from just the first round alone go ahead
[1:44:58.200 --> 1:45:03.480]  right so at the time ron paul said um i predict these blatant advertising
[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:08.040]  efforts to panic the people into taking swine flu shots will fail
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:13.240]  which is largely what happened and also congressman larry mcdonald at the time
[1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:18.360]  said quote i think the swine flu program is a tailor made hoax that finds its
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:21.720]  roots in frightening the american people and by the way these were the
[1:45:21.720 --> 1:45:24.680]  patriots of their day and they clearly killed mcdonald
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:29.320]  and this shows how ron paul if you see speeches it is from 30 years ago
[1:45:29.320 --> 1:45:32.520]  it's like a alex jones who's got more mellow over the years
[1:45:32.520 --> 1:45:36.600]  but yeah i knew ron paul had exposed the swine flu start over with him and
[1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:42.680]  mcdonald this is key yeah mcdonald said continuing quote i believe that full
[1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:46.120]  investigation of those in charge should be launched and if it turns out to be
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:49.480]  dishonest promotion everyone responsible should be removed from their
[1:45:49.480 --> 1:45:54.440]  job now you've still got ron paul there today
[1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:59.400]  um owning tamiflu being the former board of director
[1:45:59.400 --> 1:46:02.840]  is there nothing he's not involved in he's on the board of a bb as the
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:07.080]  chairman giving new reactors to build bombs on record ap bbc
[1:46:07.080 --> 1:46:10.920]  to north korea he gives the chemicals and biological system
[1:46:10.920 --> 1:46:15.080]  he helps create the taliban and al-qaeda he's involved in the continuity of
[1:46:15.080 --> 1:46:20.920]  government takeover set up with fema and rex 84 uh... he's involved he heads up
[1:46:20.920 --> 1:46:24.600]  searl and monsanto with a legalization of aspartame
[1:46:24.600 --> 1:46:27.800]  uh... the terminator gene seeds he's behind
[1:46:27.800 --> 1:46:32.280]  uh... he's involved with agent orange i mean there's literal this guy is like
[1:46:32.280 --> 1:46:37.320]  satan i think he may be the sith lord we're dealing with
[1:46:37.320 --> 1:46:41.720]  and of course tamiflu which is being pushed intensively
[1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:45.000]  over the past few days by the media and the government
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:48.680]  when it's not as you mentioned earlier it's it's not even going to cure it
[1:46:48.680 --> 1:46:53.000]  when it if it really does mutate it's owned by gilead
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  former board of director donald donnell rumsold he still has a major stock
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:00.520]  holding current board of directors include
[1:47:00.520 --> 1:47:04.120]  george schultz builderberg member and etienne
[1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:08.760]  davignon builderberg member and also connected is
[1:47:08.760 --> 1:47:12.840]  um... jr davink builderberg member
[1:47:12.840 --> 1:47:16.920]  though these are the people that are going to be profiting wildly
[1:47:16.920 --> 1:47:22.440]  no matter how bad this crisis gets then on top of that you've got
[1:47:22.440 --> 1:47:25.880]  client at perkins core field and buyers
[1:47:25.880 --> 1:47:31.000]  which is a venture firm venture capital firm that holds shares in
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.960]  eight top bio defense and pandemic companies
[1:47:33.960 --> 1:47:39.160]  which also has a now lucrative partnership with al gore
[1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:43.000]  though al gore is going to profit from this as well
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:46.520]  and then of course the article we put out today
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:50.520]  which is about baxter international it's been announced that
[1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:53.720]  they are working with the world health organization
[1:47:53.720 --> 1:47:59.080]  to develop they've been chosen the ones caught mixing live bird flu vaccines in
[1:47:59.080 --> 1:48:02.600]  europe right they were caught red-handed
[1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:06.280]  last month shipping out the live bird virus to were
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:10.680]  eighteen different labs in europe and on top of that
[1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:14.600]  they were involved in developing the stars back theme when that was a big
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:21.240]  scare four or five years ago and they were given tens of millions
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:25.640]  33 million pounds alone by the uk government so this is the go-to
[1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:28.680]  company for the insiders at the world health
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:34.120]  organization at the cdc who are eugenicis lock stock and burl
[1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:38.760]  exactly and as your previous guest said you know as long as they've got the
[1:48:38.760 --> 1:48:44.120]  pretext of an emergency situation because of the changes to the law in
[1:48:44.120 --> 1:48:47.720]  the past few years they've got all the cover they need in terms of
[1:48:47.720 --> 1:48:51.480]  liabilities for injuries and death with these vaccines
[1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:55.640]  just so long as they do it under the pretext of a crisis which is exactly
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:58.760]  how it will and they've now declared a crisis so the
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:02.920]  military industrial complexes 36 level four bio weapons labs
[1:49:02.920 --> 1:49:06.840]  churning out dangerous vaccines can be forced on the public
[1:49:06.840 --> 1:49:10.120]  uh... all under the cover of the hype and fair mongering
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:16.760]  that's going on exactly so no matter how bad it gets or if it fizzles out
[1:49:16.760 --> 1:49:19.960]  in a week or two you know and they're not going to hype up the deaths and
[1:49:19.960 --> 1:49:23.240]  injuries from all the vaccines see nobody's talking about
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:25.880]  hpv killing all these girls that are taking it
[1:49:25.880 --> 1:49:28.360]  uh... you know the guard is still nobody's talking about
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:31.960]  all the other problems coming up now it's all we need our vaccines look at the
[1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:35.160]  look at the bird flu hype go ahead
[1:49:35.160 --> 1:49:38.680]  right and on the subject of hysteria
[1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:42.760]  which is what i think from here in the u k it
[1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:44.920]  it's announced that there are twenty five
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:49.960]  pop it's a quote twenty five possible swine flu cases that's the headline
[1:49:49.960 --> 1:49:53.400]  but when you actually look at the details of the twenty five
[1:49:53.400 --> 1:49:57.800]  supposed cases fourteen have been proven negative
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:50:02.280]  and in some cases the people haven't even been to mexico

[1:54:38.200 --> 1:54:40.840]  little line
[1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:47.640]  i was a sailor i was born upon the tide
[1:54:47.640 --> 1:54:53.160]  on the sea i did it by the sea i did it by i sailed a schooner
[1:54:53.160 --> 1:54:59.160]  i sailed a schooner around the horn of mexico i went a fur
[1:54:59.160 --> 1:55:05.160]  i went off the furl the mane's a little close
[1:55:05.160 --> 1:55:09.240]  and when the yards broke off they said that i got killed
[1:55:09.240 --> 1:55:14.200]  but i'm living still but i'm living still
[1:55:14.200 --> 1:55:24.040]  i was a damn building across the river deep and wide
[1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:29.000]  we're steel and water didn't collide
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:34.520]  a place called holder on the wild collar
[1:55:34.760 --> 1:55:40.680]  i slipped and fell into the wet calm creep alone
[1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:46.120]  they buried me in that great hill that knows no sound
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:49.080]  your calls are coming up in a blitz throne right when we start the next
[1:55:49.080 --> 1:55:54.760]  hour tom nathan leo bill dominate matt dk wilson
[1:55:54.760 --> 1:56:02.360]  nicolette sherry dan carter stay with us it's all coming up
[1:56:02.360 --> 1:56:06.120]  in closing paul watson joining us from cheffield england
[1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:09.960]  they're talking about testing they are testing all americans and mexicans that
[1:56:09.960 --> 1:56:13.000]  fly in on the flights but the united states is not
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:17.640]  testing mexicans and americans coming in from mexico
[1:56:17.640 --> 1:56:21.480]  england and europe and russia are announcing banning a lot of imports from
[1:56:21.480 --> 1:56:24.120]  the united states i mean this is just unbelievable
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:29.080]  nitting and fear mongering when you look at only 103 deaths unless
[1:56:29.080 --> 1:56:33.960]  they're covering that up and it from all the calls we're getting from mexico
[1:56:33.960 --> 1:56:36.600]  we know they're covering up the number of people that are actually sick we know
[1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:40.840]  it's more than 2000 that is just asinine so we got our fingers crossed here
[1:56:40.840 --> 1:56:45.080]  watson but i agree with you my gut is this is going to be 1976
[1:56:45.080 --> 1:56:49.240]  all over again new dogs uh you know old dogs don't learn new tricks or is this
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:54.120]  a new dog paul well the the thing about it is
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:57.880]  we're damned if we do we're damned if we don't when we posted a few articles
[1:56:57.880 --> 1:57:01.720]  about this on uh friday there were a few comments
[1:57:01.720 --> 1:57:04.840]  they are typical alex john fear mongering again
[1:57:04.840 --> 1:57:08.600]  and then we're sure we come out and say that it's probably a hoax and
[1:57:08.600 --> 1:57:12.600]  people some people might say we're not taking it seriously enough but
[1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:16.680]  you just have to look at what's known and put it in perspective
[1:57:16.680 --> 1:57:21.640]  there's 40 cases in the u.s only one person's been hospitalized
[1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:26.040]  and all the people have recovered you know there's 25
[1:57:26.040 --> 1:57:31.720]  suspected cases in the in the uk and none have been confirmed whatsoever
[1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:36.840]  around you know 35 000 people in a bad flu season die in the u.s every
[1:57:36.840 --> 1:57:40.120]  year from complications related to flu viruses
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:43.320]  and an even greater number than that die in mexico
[1:57:43.320 --> 1:57:47.960]  from what i've read because if you read the actual reports closely they will
[1:57:47.960 --> 1:57:54.520]  say that of the 149 deaths in mexico only a handful of
[1:57:54.520 --> 1:57:58.360]  actually being confirmed as being swinefully related
[1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:02.200]  so just think about the the amount of people that die in mexico every day
[1:58:02.200 --> 1:58:07.400]  from infectious diseases and uh no it's a horrible third world country in the
[1:58:07.400 --> 1:58:10.280]  big cities it's very nice and smaller towns
[1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:13.880]  but it's really bad in their big cities hellish is the word i would use
[1:58:13.880 --> 1:58:18.600]  uh but paul you know bottom line i think
[1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:22.120]  and we'll see if we're proven wrong i i i hope or not
[1:58:22.120 --> 1:58:25.400]  i think this is just fear mongering by the mexican government because they
[1:58:25.400 --> 1:58:27.640]  know they're on the verge of revolution and collapse they want to
[1:58:27.640 --> 1:58:31.080]  grandstand as the saviors hand out mask everybody
[1:58:31.080 --> 1:58:34.840]  have the images of the army doing that i think that's all that's happening here
[1:58:34.840 --> 1:58:38.440]  is that mexico has hyped this and fear mongered this up
[1:58:38.440 --> 1:58:41.720]  that's what i think stay there

[2:00:05.400 --> 2:00:10.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[2:00:10.200 --> 2:00:17.560]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:00:17.560 --> 2:00:23.800]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:23.800 --> 2:00:28.680]  we are live simulcasting down with the final two hours at prisonplanet.tv
[2:00:28.680 --> 2:00:35.080]  as we track the swine slash bird slash human flu
[2:00:35.080 --> 2:00:42.040]  that they're now reporting has killed 140 people
[2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:45.800]  but when you look at what regular flues do they kill far more than that
[2:00:45.800 --> 2:00:50.200]  in a week in mexico during flu season kills tens of thousands
[2:00:50.200 --> 2:00:53.160]  so why is the media and the government hyping this so much
[2:00:53.160 --> 2:00:56.440]  and we'll be recapping all that in closing i'm gonna go to calls
[2:00:56.440 --> 2:00:59.880]  anything else important to add paul watson
[2:00:59.880 --> 2:01:04.040]  yeah there's been a couple of times where we've caught the media putting out
[2:01:04.040 --> 2:01:09.400]  fake stories which hype this beyond what it really is for example
[2:01:09.400 --> 2:01:13.480]  there was a report that oh when obama went to mexico
[2:01:13.480 --> 2:01:17.720]  um last week early last week that he shook hands with
[2:01:17.720 --> 2:01:21.960]  a archaeologist called philip solis holdweed
[2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:27.560]  and the report was that this archaeologist then died the very day
[2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:31.800]  after from swine flu and that's why there were all these fears about obama
[2:01:31.800 --> 2:01:35.480]  but it turns out that fake and that he died a week later
[2:01:35.480 --> 2:01:40.840]  on 23rd of april from a heart attack but the big report initially was that
[2:01:40.840 --> 2:01:44.760]  you know he died from swine flu it turned out to be completely fake
[2:01:44.760 --> 2:01:47.960]  so there's a couple of things like that floating around
[2:01:47.960 --> 2:01:52.440]  and um yeah i would agree with you at the moment it looks like it's being hyped
[2:01:52.440 --> 2:01:56.760]  up because you've got the who and the un saying
[2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:00.200]  you know it's possible there'll be a pandemic and then you look at the actual
[2:02:00.200 --> 2:02:03.480]  numbers of how many people are getting infected and
[2:02:03.480 --> 2:02:07.400]  how many are making full recovery you know a third of those that were
[2:02:07.400 --> 2:02:10.840]  infected in mexico have completely recovered already
[2:02:10.840 --> 2:02:16.120]  according to what if you look at the 1918 flu that's how it started
[2:02:16.120 --> 2:02:20.280]  at first so yeah either either they've released it and they know what it's
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:23.880]  going to mutate into because they've already you know done this in the lab
[2:02:23.880 --> 2:02:29.080]  or they're not involved in a uh bio weapons release but they've studied it
[2:02:29.080 --> 2:02:32.520]  and know it's got a potential to mutate into something even more deadly that's
[2:02:32.520 --> 2:02:35.240]  airborne or they're just purely hyping it to sell
[2:02:35.240 --> 2:02:38.840]  more vaccines and more drugs that actually cause the virus to
[2:02:38.840 --> 2:02:42.760]  mutate and causes more problems or it could be just
[2:02:42.760 --> 2:02:45.720]  mexico hyping it for their own political purposes
[2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:48.920]  we need to just have an article paul if you can with bullet points of what it
[2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:52.440]  could be and uh you know what the scenario is
[2:02:52.440 --> 2:02:55.400]  that we're looking at right now but thank you so much paul watson

[2:08:51.160 --> 2:08:54.920]  saying this could be a global pandemic you've got all their previous reports

[2:09:16.040 --> 2:09:19.240]  thank you guys for taking my call pleasure to talk to you um
[2:09:19.240 --> 2:09:22.840]  i just want to comment really on when i was watching uh waiting to watch the
[2:09:22.840 --> 2:09:26.520]  uh... press release for the cdc homeless security release
[2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:30.600]  um uh we were watching fox news and pretty much like they just had a banner
[2:09:30.600 --> 2:09:33.720]  that said don't worry back there's making a vaccine
[2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:36.760]  and they just kept it on the screen for like two minutes while they showed
[2:09:36.760 --> 2:09:40.760]  other video and i'm just thinking wow you know no mention of the avian flu
[2:09:40.760 --> 2:09:44.280]  scandal you know it's complete psych warfare
[2:09:44.280 --> 2:09:47.000]  um and then during the middle of the press release
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:49.560]  at the or at the end of the press release i'm sorry
[2:09:49.560 --> 2:09:52.920]  um the reporter asked the uh they had a
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:57.480]  uh homeless security if this was related to bioterrorism and fox news cut the
[2:09:57.480 --> 2:10:01.400]  audio went back to um the reporter who is just commenting and
[2:10:01.400 --> 2:10:05.000]  regurgitating the same stuff that the polytron was saying
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:09.080]  and then right after that they butchered the 1970 fact saying that there was one
[2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:12.520]  uh the 1976 fact saying that there was one death
[2:10:12.520 --> 2:10:17.320]  uh no mention of the 40 million vaccines you know it's just complete psych warfare
[2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:21.880]  and makes me sick you know well the history of the history of the medical
[2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:25.640]  histories thousands died officially uh and
[2:10:25.640 --> 2:10:30.520]  psychopedia britannica uh it says a couple hundred deaths
[2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:34.360]  they are just absolutely lying if they say one death i mean everybody remembers
[2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:38.200]  76 how they were telling the whole nation you must be vaccinated and all
[2:10:38.200 --> 2:10:42.200]  these deaths occurred and they had to recall it just like in 2002 they
[2:10:42.200 --> 2:10:46.520]  ordered 14 000 first responders that's all the medical workers all the police
[2:10:46.520 --> 2:10:50.920]  all the firemen all the county city state workers federal to take the shot
[2:10:50.920 --> 2:10:54.760]  and the la times reported 99.9 percent said no
[2:10:54.760 --> 2:10:58.040]  4 000 said yes and there were a bunch of deaths
[2:10:58.040 --> 2:11:02.040]  from those that did take it so it's just incredible
[2:11:02.040 --> 2:11:06.120]  guys the end of them was saying one thing um uh i was doing a little bit of
[2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:09.880]  research and i came across the copy of the rebuilding america's defenses and on
[2:11:09.880 --> 2:11:13.320]  page 60 on the bottom paragraph for the whole paragraph
[2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:16.840]  talked about so we've got to condition the public to the media to accept the
[2:11:16.840 --> 2:11:20.280]  use of race specific bio weapons right and it says although it may take several
[2:11:20.280 --> 2:11:23.160]  decades for this process of transformation to them for the art of
[2:11:23.160 --> 2:11:27.560]  warfare on air land and sea will be vastly different and will include
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:30.760]  long-range missiles and perhaps the world microbes
[2:11:30.760 --> 2:11:34.280]  you know so it just sounds a little suspicious
[2:11:34.280 --> 2:11:37.160]  well have you found the part in there about race specific bio weapons oh
[2:11:37.160 --> 2:11:39.880]  yeah yeah they're at the bottom there it says uh
[2:11:39.880 --> 2:11:44.360]  in advance forms of biological warfare they can target specific genotypes may
[2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:48.760]  transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful
[2:11:48.760 --> 2:11:53.080]  tool i mean that right there says it all and then cheney and other speeches to
[2:11:53.080 --> 2:11:57.480]  uh elite groups called for its use even in fact i found the austin american
[2:11:57.480 --> 2:12:01.800]  statesman normally a terrible newspaper rebuked cheney for that at the time
[2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:05.080]  before he was even president hey guys our vice president

[2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:27.000]  for this flu okay then on msnbc they interviewed a doctor
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:30.920]  who said to take tamaflu and uh there's something else called
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:37.160]  brella flex uh some some other kind of flu virus and everything seems to be
[2:13:37.160 --> 2:13:41.160]  conflicting right now um he said that the strain is much
[2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:46.680]  uh stronger in mexico than it is here um let's see as paul said and someone
[2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:50.360]  else said there are 149 cases now allegedly
[2:13:50.360 --> 2:13:53.960]  in mexico and 40 here but while beser was talking
[2:13:53.960 --> 2:13:59.000]  msnbc showed a map with two uh cases in texas
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  and i just heard the worker earlier said that there were 20 in san antonio
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:06.920]  yeah that's in the off that's in the san antonio express news guys
[2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:10.280]  punch up the google map there's a live google
[2:14:10.280 --> 2:14:13.720]  uh map that they've got that is showing accurately
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:17.160]  what the latest uh reported cases are now i don't know if
[2:14:17.160 --> 2:14:20.360]  if the government's being accurate itself but i'm saying this map has the
[2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:23.560]  most up to date uh with the latest numbers let's punch that up on
[2:14:23.560 --> 2:14:27.320]  prism planet dot tv viewer screens right now
[2:14:27.320 --> 2:14:31.480]  uh and you go to prism planet dot tv folks if you'd like to be able to
[2:14:31.480 --> 2:14:34.440]  you know see all of this and to become a member
[2:14:34.440 --> 2:14:37.320]  though i have been taking these reports and posting them for free
[2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:40.600]  upon info wars dot com not free for us we got to pay for the bandwidth
[2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:44.360]  hence the membership uh but uh there it is the cases
[2:14:44.360 --> 2:14:49.640]  and zoom in on texas let's zoom in on texas and see how many cases it's showing
[2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:54.520]  they're showing um one in fort worth one in dallas one in garland
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:15:00.760]  they're showing uh a whole bunch south of san antonio one two
[2:15:00.760 --> 2:15:04.600]  three four five six seven eight nine so this isn't up to date because as of
[2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:08.200]  saturday most the cases were north of san antonio
[2:15:08.200 --> 2:15:11.320]  right uh so you know because i live here there's
[2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:15.160]  austin right there on your screen so they've got cases as far north as new
[2:15:15.160 --> 2:15:19.560]  bronville's now and then out to the uh south east
[2:15:19.560 --> 2:15:24.040]  there uh by gonzalez so uh we'll continue to track that but this is more
[2:15:24.040 --> 2:15:26.440]  up to date than some of the stuff we're seeing
[2:15:26.440 --> 2:15:32.280]  uh anything else yes um let's see while uh let's take a worldwide they're
[2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:37.560]  passing out uh masks at airports um better said
[2:15:37.560 --> 2:15:42.600]  that masks will not help you at all and he gave the thing about this little
[2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:46.520]  spiel about contact and speed cover your mouth when you're
[2:15:46.520 --> 2:15:50.520]  sneezing wash your hands don't give those little kisses that you give other
[2:15:50.520 --> 2:15:53.400]  people basically don't don't touch anybody
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:56.680]  but this is all part of training as the government saves you it gives you the
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:15:59.480]  medicine it tells you what to do it tells you to stay in your
[2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:01.960]  house and i've predicted before they release real
[2:16:01.960 --> 2:16:06.200]  plagues over and over again they'll have lots of scares and beta test
[2:16:06.200 --> 2:16:10.280]  and then napolitano had only security basically says that says oh this is a
[2:16:10.280 --> 2:16:13.800]  good practice run for us to get ready and we think very soon
[2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:17.480]  we're going to be hit by the big one i mean that is very chilling
[2:16:17.480 --> 2:16:21.160]  okay the other medicines doctor was talking about what panel for this call
[2:16:21.160 --> 2:16:26.440]  brilenza okay um and on that 6.0 earthquake there was uh
[2:16:26.440 --> 2:16:29.880]  there was one remember there was just an earthquake
[2:16:29.880 --> 2:16:35.560]  uh in acapoco on the 13th of this month as well so two weeks later
[2:16:35.560 --> 2:16:38.920]  there's another 6.0 earthquake in mexico
[2:16:38.920 --> 2:16:43.960]  outside of mexico city and um it they looked to me like there one there's a
[2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:48.680]  lot of confusion a lot of disparate news being spread around um some people
[2:16:48.680 --> 2:16:51.640]  are reporting that people are dying everywhere people are reporting that
[2:16:51.640 --> 2:16:55.240]  they're not dying everywhere uh people are reporting to wear masks
[2:16:55.240 --> 2:16:58.120]  this guy comes on television says don't wear masks
[2:16:58.120 --> 2:17:03.240]  okay so it seems like in mexico um everybody if everybody remembers in
[2:17:03.240 --> 2:17:07.400]  1968 the revolution started in mexico city with the student
[2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:11.160]  the earthquakes happened right in mexico right outside of mexico city
[2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:14.600]  now we have this flu thing and everybody's basically home written
[2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:17.640]  and as you said alex the government's failing there
[2:17:17.640 --> 2:17:20.760]  and if there's a revolution it's going to start or some kind of
[2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:24.840]  mass protest it's going to start with the students and with indigenous people
[2:17:24.840 --> 2:17:29.640]  kind of sweeping up behind them um that's on one tier on another tier
[2:17:29.640 --> 2:17:33.080]  uh it seems like there's this a basic scare
[2:17:33.080 --> 2:17:36.680]  worldwide scare and just just like you just said
[2:17:36.680 --> 2:17:40.200]  a kind of training a build-up for something in the near future
[2:17:40.200 --> 2:17:44.440]  all right thank you hey uh good to hear from you plug plug the outfit you ride
[2:17:44.440 --> 2:17:49.640]  for oh that's okay alex no problem and you also do audio

[2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:13.000]  accept but if the secretary of defense said it and government documents show
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:16.680]  it and i have stuff from the 1950s with the australian and british
[2:18:16.680 --> 2:18:22.360]  government saying they had uh tsunami weapons that were
[2:18:22.360 --> 2:18:28.520]  classified that could cause tsunamis but in uh 1997
[2:18:28.520 --> 2:18:32.920]  in the april issue of the army times newspaper was a daily issue it was an
[2:18:32.920 --> 2:18:37.080]  april i want to say april 16th google secretary of
[2:18:37.080 --> 2:18:40.600]  defense william cohen earthquake weapons let's put the army times on
[2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:44.360]  screen let's see how good my memory is april 16th

[2:18:50.760 --> 2:18:55.000]  defense william cohen earthquake weapons
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:57.880]  and let's put that up on the screen let's see how good my memory is

[2:19:06.600 --> 2:19:11.400]  date on that april 28th that's tomorrow but i thought he gave the
[2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:14.520]  speech only to 23rd okay well my memory my memory fails see it's weird
[2:19:14.520 --> 2:19:18.520]  well i can't completely trust it i i i it's like it's almost always right on
[2:19:18.520 --> 2:19:22.760]  target and i remember april i remember exactly what he said
[2:19:22.760 --> 2:19:26.440]  about seismic earthquake weapons and you can go read it at the defense link

[2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:45.080]  Tinpenny who runs the practice town of Mexico and solds down there medical
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:24:47.800]  doctor or the leading experts out there even in
[2:24:47.800 --> 2:24:50.120]  mainstream media talking about bird flu and analyzing it
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:52.680]  we had her on for 45 minutes or in the first hour she was going to be
[2:24:52.680 --> 2:24:56.920]  popping in again from Mexico she's in Monterey
[2:24:56.920 --> 2:24:59.960]  first they canceled their big medical conference it was already going on down
[2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:02.840]  there then they told them they you know basically have to be
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:06.360]  bust out uh if they don't take a plane today they'll
[2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:10.360]  be bust out uh tomorrow i mean so not only is the border
[2:25:10.360 --> 2:25:14.440]  wide open they're making people go back i mean this is martial law
[2:25:14.440 --> 2:25:17.640]  uh so mexico is taking this very very seriously
[2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:21.400]  why on earth dr sherry tinpenny would they make you leave now give us the
[2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:26.120]  latest well they just um downstairs they just unfolded all of the uh all of
[2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:28.680]  the conference materials and everybody that had booths and
[2:25:28.680 --> 2:25:31.480]  everything are packing up all their stuff and they made an
[2:25:31.480 --> 2:25:35.880]  announcement that if anybody who could not get a plane out today
[2:25:35.880 --> 2:25:40.680]  that they were uh they had a bus the five hour bus ride from Monterey
[2:25:40.680 --> 2:25:43.720]  and they were going to take people across the border and take them to
[2:25:43.720 --> 2:25:49.560]  san antonio today if on so um they they're really serious about about
[2:25:49.560 --> 2:25:52.440]  people leaving and nobody's like you know holding a gun to our heads and
[2:25:52.440 --> 2:25:55.880]  telling us that we have to leave but there's such a sense of urgency amongst
[2:25:55.880 --> 2:25:59.560]  their amongst the um the mexican officials here about getting us out of
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:04.920]  the country it just um makes me why suspicious about i don't know maybe
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:07.800]  they really are going to close the borders and not let anybody back in or
[2:26:07.800 --> 2:26:12.280]  back out so we're um we've decided that maybe um
[2:26:12.280 --> 2:26:16.040]  maybe the prudent thing to do is to just um go ahead and leave with everybody
[2:26:16.040 --> 2:26:18.840]  else because we were going to stay here till saturday i mean we it's a beautiful
[2:26:18.840 --> 2:26:22.040]  place you're going to enjoy the vacation time but um
[2:26:22.040 --> 2:26:25.160]  you know if they're serious enough about this that if you can't get a plane out
[2:26:25.160 --> 2:26:28.920]  they're going to bus you to san antonio which is about a five hour drive
[2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:33.160]  um that that's that's taken this really serious
[2:26:33.160 --> 2:26:37.320]  well doctor ten penny uh this has been a big escalation just in the last hour
[2:26:37.320 --> 2:26:41.240]  and a half since you were on with us other thoughts on why they're so
[2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:44.680]  panicked you know i'm really not sure i mean
[2:26:44.680 --> 2:26:49.720]  there's no you know the it's the uh it's called a monoray health care city
[2:26:49.720 --> 2:26:54.440]  is you know monoray is a very large medical tourism center it's one of the
[2:26:54.440 --> 2:26:57.800]  global places where people come to get health care and that was the conference
[2:26:57.800 --> 2:27:01.960]  that i was here for is for this medical tourism association conference and
[2:27:01.960 --> 2:27:05.800]  and they have wonderful facilities that are five star that look every bit like
[2:27:05.800 --> 2:27:09.720]  the cleveland clinic or places in in cleveland in in the u.s
[2:27:09.720 --> 2:27:13.240]  and they are the ones that are calling the shots it's not the medical tourism
[2:27:13.240 --> 2:27:16.840]  association it's not the conference it's not the hotel
[2:27:16.840 --> 2:27:19.720]  they're the ones who are making a really big deal
[2:27:19.720 --> 2:27:23.320]  and the gentleman who was up in front of the group this morning telling us that
[2:27:23.320 --> 2:27:26.600]  they were canceling the tours and then they were canceling the
[2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:30.680]  the rest of the conference he's in close contact apparently with officials from
[2:27:30.680 --> 2:27:33.720]  mexico city and he was saying that these were
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:36.520]  sort of their rules because there were several people in the conference that
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:39.560]  said hey you know we're here nobody's going to be able to get a flight out
[2:27:39.560 --> 2:27:42.200]  today can we at least do part of the conference maybe
[2:27:42.200 --> 2:27:44.600]  do it you know some of it tomorrow can we
[2:27:44.600 --> 2:27:47.560]  you know have the conference from midnight from noon to midnight get as
[2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:51.320]  much of it in nope it's canceled you can't be in this room and now they're
[2:27:51.320 --> 2:27:54.120]  saying they're setting up buses for us to leave
[2:27:54.120 --> 2:27:58.440]  and now there's been a big six plus magnitude earthquake
[2:27:58.440 --> 2:28:02.040]  in mexico city this is getting weirder oh wow
[2:28:02.040 --> 2:28:06.920]  and weirder you know strong or earthquake felt in mexico city ap
[2:28:06.920 --> 2:28:10.360]  reports a strong earthquake struck central mexico and monday
[2:28:10.360 --> 2:28:13.320]  swanged tall buildings in the capital and sending office workers into the
[2:28:13.320 --> 2:28:17.480]  streets the 6.0 magnitude quake was centered near
[2:28:17.480 --> 2:28:21.080]  chile pachinko i'm sure i'm pronouncing that wrong
[2:28:21.080 --> 2:28:26.680]  chile paningo about 130 miles southwest of mexico city or 50 miles
[2:28:26.680 --> 2:28:31.880]  80 kilometers from the resort of acapoco according to the us geological survey
[2:28:31.880 --> 2:28:35.160]  and so it's just really when it rains it pours down there
[2:28:35.160 --> 2:28:39.560]  i guess so alex well i'm gonna have to cut this short because i have to pack

[2:37:00.520 --> 2:37:04.040]  electrical power hurricanes snow ice storms listeners should move towards
[2:37:04.040 --> 2:37:06.680]  getting off the grid and here's a good way to do just that
[2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:10.280]  a solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor solution
[2:37:10.280 --> 2:37:13.720]  from science it's designed to provide 1800 watts of power on demand in the event
[2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:16.760]  of any disaster knowledge you get an emergency power backup kit which
[2:37:16.760 --> 2:37:20.760]  consists of the power source 1800 power plant a high efficiency solar
[2:37:20.760 --> 2:37:24.280]  panel designed to provide endless electricity it generates free electricity
[2:37:24.280 --> 2:37:28.520]  remember too that gas stations need gas but in the blackout gas pumps can't pump
[2:37:28.520 --> 2:37:31.640]  gas because they run electricity the solar generator is like having a

[2:38:42.200 --> 2:38:48.200]  800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com okay i really want to hear
[2:38:48.200 --> 2:38:52.040]  now that he's had more time to look at this because nobody talks and writes
[2:38:52.040 --> 2:38:54.840]  about bird flu more than dr. deagle who is a medical
[2:38:54.840 --> 2:39:00.120]  doctor and if you go over his bio it is lengthy i think it's probably
[2:39:00.120 --> 2:39:04.280]  better dr. deagle plus i just had your bio here in
[2:39:04.280 --> 2:39:07.480]  front of me there's so much going on uh if you
[2:39:07.480 --> 2:39:10.920]  tell the listeners a little bit about yourself because you particularly
[2:39:10.920 --> 2:39:15.880]  worked in a lot of these areas in fact i had known this i'd heard it from another
[2:39:15.880 --> 2:39:19.960]  doctor was actually a biologist but i didn't i didn't believe it i believed
[2:39:19.960 --> 2:39:23.000]  him but i just couldn't believe it and you were on the show about a year ago
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:25.880]  and you said yeah look at how they make aspartame
[2:39:25.880 --> 2:39:32.440]  it is a specially engineered bacteria's excrement is what aspartame is and they
[2:39:32.440 --> 2:39:38.840]  feed toxic chemicals to the bacteria the E. coli
[2:39:38.840 --> 2:39:43.000]  and then it so so they feed a crap eating bacteria
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:46.280]  chemicals and then it
[2:39:46.760 --> 2:39:49.880]  defecates how i hate to talk about this because the new order is into
[2:39:49.880 --> 2:39:54.680]  a toxic chemical and so this is a bio and i'd heard this and
[2:39:54.680 --> 2:39:59.400]  read this didn't believe it then i googled that day a year ago
[2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:03.480]  aspartame manufacturing process do that right now this is a side issue
[2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:07.320]  and it was exactly with photos and videos what deagle said he saw
[2:40:07.320 --> 2:40:11.000]  20 years ago at a factory when he was getting a tour of a vaccine facility i
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:14.520]  think he said he worked there i forget and separate from the vaccine facility
[2:40:14.520 --> 2:40:18.120]  on another back 40 was their huge aspartame facility
[2:40:18.120 --> 2:40:22.520]  and it was black sludge well folks you can go online and look at the black
[2:40:22.520 --> 2:40:25.320]  sludge just give an example of how crazy it is
[2:40:25.320 --> 2:40:30.440]  since 1981 when they approved this you are eating E. coli crap
[2:40:30.440 --> 2:40:33.720]  that is aspartame now in over 10,000 products
[2:40:33.720 --> 2:40:37.160]  dr. d you want to tell folks briefly about that and then your bio
[2:40:37.160 --> 2:40:41.320]  um yeah i'll try to be the bio real real brief my background before i went into
[2:40:41.320 --> 2:40:45.240]  medicine in the 70s was i was trained in infectious
[2:40:45.240 --> 2:40:49.400]  disease and worked under a bio-weapon near dr robert brown
[2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:55.400]  in the 1997 i spoke at human life international in
[2:40:55.400 --> 2:40:59.400]  zerk switzerland on the super soldier program which they tried to get
[2:40:59.400 --> 2:41:04.280]  recruit me at ucla in 1978 i turned them down
[2:41:04.280 --> 2:41:08.040]  and i also spoke against fetal tissue transplantation which was projects
[2:41:08.040 --> 2:41:11.160]  going on all across america from boulder to
[2:41:11.160 --> 2:41:15.960]  u of texas etc and after my talk they gave me a
[2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:19.800]  plunked out in front of me a foot of documents about three projects
[2:41:19.800 --> 2:41:24.520]  the first two projects were the plasmid uh genetically engineered
[2:41:24.520 --> 2:41:28.760]  tetanus vaccine was to create antibodies to cause first trimester abortions
[2:41:28.760 --> 2:41:32.680]  primarily to reduce the population by causing a spontaneous miscarriage
[2:41:32.680 --> 2:41:36.760]  in women the second project was a special virus project which they also tried
[2:41:36.760 --> 2:41:40.760]  to recruit me in 1974 to go to uganda for the cia
[2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:44.440]  and finished my phd in virology i turned them down
[2:41:44.440 --> 2:41:48.520]  this project was a michael bacteria which is carrying an arnie retrovirus
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:52.440]  the viruses in fact genetically made from at least three different
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:58.600]  retroviruses including visna the feline leukemia virus and also
[2:41:58.600 --> 2:42:02.280]  green monkey virus these are weapons that were
[2:42:02.280 --> 2:42:06.280]  originally conceived by the nazis in the 1930s and completed
[2:42:06.280 --> 2:42:11.000]  by our government by the cdc etc but the most scary project let me just stop
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:13.880]  you for a moment for those that don't know and this sounds ridiculous i'm
[2:42:13.880 --> 2:42:18.120]  trying to recruit him that's who the cia recruits
[2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:21.800]  is doctors is scientists because these are professionals
[2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:25.400]  would have proven they can follow orders and and and carry out complex
[2:42:25.400 --> 2:42:28.840]  procedures my dad is a dentist an oral surgeon
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:32.440]  and he they tried to recruit him and a bunch of other dallas
[2:42:32.440 --> 2:42:36.680]  top of their class oral surgeons to be part of a and we were going to have to
[2:42:36.680 --> 2:42:40.200]  move to maryland in my day it was double the money he said no i remember the
[2:42:40.200 --> 2:42:43.480]  conversations around the table when i was like 10 years old and they came back
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:46.840]  a year later and all he would tell him is it was cybernetics because he knew how
[2:42:46.840 --> 2:42:50.040]  to implant things in bone so for those that don't know the military industrial
[2:42:50.040 --> 2:42:53.640]  complex hits up what i would say what probably a third
[2:42:53.640 --> 2:42:57.960]  of your specialized doctors and people uh... yeah they look for people that
[2:42:57.960 --> 2:43:01.560]  have a bent toward doing research a lot of doctors only maybe five percent
[2:43:01.560 --> 2:43:04.600]  really like to do research the rest of them just want to go off and do
[2:43:04.600 --> 2:43:09.080]  procedures and have a practice but anyway i mean my whole point is this is
[2:43:09.080 --> 2:43:12.440]  widespread oh yeah this is this is standard this is not a
[2:43:12.440 --> 2:43:15.240]  unusual thing this is standard to to call through
[2:43:15.240 --> 2:43:18.840]  and they just like uh... the road scholarship they put 300 road scholars
[2:43:18.840 --> 2:43:19.880]  through every year
[2:43:19.880 --> 2:43:23.320]  10 percent when they do the psychological testing are a little bit
[2:43:23.320 --> 2:43:27.000]  psychotic they're kind of strange they'll they'll do things no matter what
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:30.280]  uh... and they get a carte blanche now the third project was the most scary of
[2:43:30.280 --> 2:43:33.400]  all and this was a project where they told me all the details
[2:43:33.400 --> 2:43:38.200]  that they were actually going to zoom minors uh wailers i mean wailers from
[2:43:38.200 --> 2:43:41.800]  uh... 1918 pandemic in the permafrost and they're going to
[2:43:41.800 --> 2:43:46.200]  take a gene bioengine with a super computer and rebuild the 1918 swine
[2:43:46.200 --> 2:43:48.760]  flu uh... that flew by the way
[2:43:48.760 --> 2:43:53.960]  also it was a byproduct of a bioweapons projects vaccine project that was a
[2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:57.320]  typhus vaccine that they passed through pigs in kansas
[2:43:57.320 --> 2:44:01.400]  and therefore had pig flu and human flu and i went over the genetics letter by
[2:44:01.400 --> 2:44:04.280]  dna letter with dr henry all nine and three years ago
[2:44:04.280 --> 2:44:08.360]  and by the way they now admit that they have uh... with the human genome
[2:44:08.360 --> 2:44:12.360]  project rebuilt that flew and i remember twelve thirteen years ago this was
[2:44:12.360 --> 2:44:16.360]  first breaking in the late nineties uh... that
[2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:19.320]  it was rumored they were going to rebuild it now they admit they have the
[2:44:19.320 --> 2:44:22.360]  quote for research yeah and they actually these are all in public
[2:44:22.360 --> 2:44:26.120]  documents now i had a nineteen ninety seven march six digs given to me by these
[2:44:26.120 --> 2:44:29.320]  scientists and doctors who smuggle the documents out of the world health
[2:44:29.320 --> 2:44:32.760]  organization they're going to take this and then they were going to add avian
[2:44:32.760 --> 2:44:36.680]  genes and insert it into the bird population in asia
[2:44:36.680 --> 2:44:40.920]  and then they were going to later quote cause the release of bridging viruses
[2:44:40.920 --> 2:44:44.520]  that will allow it to jump into humans and other animals
[2:44:44.520 --> 2:44:47.960]  that's just happened now whether this wave is the big one i don't know but i
[2:44:47.960 --> 2:44:50.680]  can tell you what but the poll tunnel is telling us
[2:44:50.680 --> 2:44:54.440]  that the watch out for the next wave there's almost certainly at least two
[2:44:54.440 --> 2:44:58.120]  substrains the one in america is not very lethal it's like a a bad
[2:44:58.120 --> 2:45:01.720]  flu but the one in mexico city uh... if there's a
[2:45:01.720 --> 2:45:04.920]  hundreds dead or even a hundred dead out of say two thousand
[2:45:04.920 --> 2:45:08.040]  that's a pretty high lethality rate and we're talking about that because it's
[2:45:08.040 --> 2:45:11.720]  been there longer and mutated into a worse well it could be several reasons
[2:45:11.720 --> 2:45:14.680]  like because they're sick down there and and aren't healthy
[2:45:14.680 --> 2:45:17.480]  well when you're unhealthy you see you have more free radicals in your body
[2:45:17.480 --> 2:45:20.280]  or if you expose the toxins like dr tenpenny said
[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:24.200]  if you want to take a virus and you want to make that virus mutate become more
[2:45:24.200 --> 2:45:27.240]  aggressive you can insert it into an animal and actually inject the animal
[2:45:27.240 --> 2:45:30.840]  with toxins or poisons and it'll actually make that virus more
[2:45:30.840 --> 2:45:33.560]  aggressive and it'll make it mutate faster
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:38.200]  so uh... what's had probably happening is a simple process of recombination we
[2:45:38.200 --> 2:45:43.080]  know that the inserted the h5n1 and their specific genes so when the genetics
[2:45:43.080 --> 2:45:46.280]  come out there's a gene deletion on the pb2 gene that makes a
[2:45:46.280 --> 2:45:49.160]  completely bypassed in your leucine for an all mammals
[2:45:49.160 --> 2:45:52.520]  so there's no warning system at all it's even worse than in 1918 so it gets
[2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:54.840]  through the defenses of the body and i want you to get back into that in the
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:45:58.200]  time you got four steve quell comes up but but the key here is
[2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:01.240]  every doctor i've talked to on and on fair is saying
[2:46:01.240 --> 2:46:04.440]  and they'll especially say off here on or they say it's suspicious off here they
[2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:09.480]  say no way the way this virus is set up with with pig
[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:13.240]  human uh... and and and bird this thing is designer
[2:46:13.240 --> 2:46:17.640]  yeah i can visualize in my mind that they had a lab truck spraying it around
[2:46:17.640 --> 2:46:21.000]  mexico city or the favelas around it the slums
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:24.920]  where you have second and weak populations but the fact is that now the bird
[2:46:24.920 --> 2:46:27.960]  populations in all continents now have these lethal genes
[2:46:27.960 --> 2:46:32.200]  it's going to bridge from birds say the cattle humans pigs god knows what
[2:46:32.200 --> 2:46:35.960]  and this is the first of many ways in the in the steam ship age
[2:46:35.960 --> 2:46:39.880]  it took months for the next wave to happen my grandmother lost a brother
[2:46:39.880 --> 2:46:45.400]  and a sister and little sister died uh... due to the swine flu in 1918
[2:46:45.400 --> 2:46:49.480]  the brother was sold set by his sister he went to hug her in her coffin and the
[2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:52.440]  next week they buried him so i have a personal reason
[2:46:52.440 --> 2:46:56.200]  the primary reason why i got into radio to get the truth out besides civil
[2:46:56.200 --> 2:47:00.280]  defense for issues like nuclear war etc the primary number one reason
[2:47:00.280 --> 2:47:04.120]  with these documents i was given 12 years ago to warn people
[2:47:04.120 --> 2:47:07.080]  when they keep telling you there's going to be an avian flu pandemic and a lot
[2:47:07.080 --> 2:47:10.600]  of doctors didn't believe it i had the inside documents i had the genetics i
[2:47:10.600 --> 2:47:14.040]  had the background infectious disease there were doing everything they can
[2:47:14.040 --> 2:47:16.520]  to create it it wouldn't happen spontaneously
[2:47:16.520 --> 2:47:20.520]  they now have released the bridging virus which is this new super hybrid
[2:47:20.520 --> 2:47:24.360]  and future waves if this is not the big one are going to come in they're going
[2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:26.680]  to come quickly
[2:47:26.680 --> 2:47:30.840]  now uh... normally they say a virus peaks in about ninety days but i mean i
[2:47:30.840 --> 2:47:33.720]  mean i mean they all vary it's all depends on the genetics to see this is
[2:47:33.720 --> 2:47:37.400]  going to recombine it's this strain the one in america seems to be relatively
[2:47:37.400 --> 2:47:40.040]  mild we don't have anybody dead but in mexico city
[2:47:40.040 --> 2:47:44.280]  and as it changes and recombines we can recombine very quickly but how do we
[2:47:44.280 --> 2:47:46.840]  know that it's not the same virus it's just that they're
[2:47:46.840 --> 2:47:49.960]  we don't know because they won't release the data they never released anything
[2:47:49.960 --> 2:47:53.400]  very secretive and i've had calling for call on and off air from mexico
[2:47:53.400 --> 2:47:56.040]  where they say seventy percent of the people they know
[2:47:56.040 --> 2:47:59.720]  are sick you go to the hospital people are vomiting everywhere blood coming out
[2:47:59.720 --> 2:48:04.040]  their noses uh... and this is similar to what we saw in 1918
[2:48:04.040 --> 2:48:07.960]  where it was a hemorrhagic diastasis it causes a cytokine storm
[2:48:07.960 --> 2:48:11.640]  and if it's bad enough the stronger your immune system more deadly it is
[2:48:11.640 --> 2:48:16.040]  so that's why people need to pay attention it's not just how bad this is
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:19.560]  now is that the virus is then going to get into other animals
[2:48:19.560 --> 2:48:24.280]  uh... dogs cats birds and as it recombines there because it has the
[2:48:24.280 --> 2:48:26.600]  receptor binding domain to get back to humans
[2:48:26.600 --> 2:48:29.480]  we now have a a returning vector system
[2:48:29.480 --> 2:48:32.520]  where it can get into cattle it can get into people's pets
[2:48:32.520 --> 2:48:35.960]  we already have a pandemic where birds all over the world i have reports from
[2:48:35.960 --> 2:48:38.040]  game wardens in british columbia
[2:48:38.040 --> 2:48:42.040]  um... from washington state for more eggs are dying all over the United States
[2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:44.520]  exactly that's exactly extreme news i'm
[2:48:44.520 --> 2:48:47.960]  right so now we have the proof that there is a pandemic in birds
[2:48:47.960 --> 2:48:51.640]  there's now a pandemic in pigs and the likelihood
[2:48:51.640 --> 2:48:54.360]  is that when this recombines in future waves
[2:48:54.360 --> 2:48:57.560]  and they've done this because their plan is and they were told me this is in
[2:48:57.560 --> 2:49:01.320]  these documents these physicians gave me these documents said this is to reduce
[2:49:01.320 --> 2:49:04.360]  the world population by at least two billion
[2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:08.600]  okay they are doing everything they're behind schedule all of the public
[2:49:08.600 --> 2:49:12.920]  documents and they use their stage terror attacks of 9-11
[2:49:12.920 --> 2:49:17.160]  to put the control grid in to tell you it's for brown skin guys in caves
[2:49:17.160 --> 2:49:21.080]  then now they admit oh this homeland securities for you the gun owners
[2:49:21.080 --> 2:49:24.680]  right the number one threatened veterans so so they need us to be straight
[2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:27.960]  jacketed and to be and to be listed as the enemies
[2:49:27.960 --> 2:49:31.240]  so when they move with the mass plague we stand down
[2:49:31.240 --> 2:49:35.160]  exactly and their whole idea is to is is the statement by
[2:49:35.160 --> 2:49:39.240]  kissinger just a few weeks ago was that the american public will be discerned
[2:49:39.240 --> 2:49:42.680]  by september because they plan on waves between now and september
[2:49:42.680 --> 2:49:45.800]  that'll be sufficient that'll be basically will protect you if you'll
[2:49:45.800 --> 2:49:48.360]  pass in your guns and come to our civil attention camps
[2:49:48.360 --> 2:49:51.720]  oh and right right now this the strain is supposedly sensitive to
[2:49:51.720 --> 2:49:54.280]  ozol tamivir or a tamiflu which of course
[2:49:54.280 --> 2:49:57.880]  mr satan himself uh has has shares in it
[2:49:57.880 --> 2:50:02.120]  uh rumsfeld but the fact is this is going to require resistance extremely
[2:50:02.120 --> 2:50:05.720]  fast within days so it's useless vaccines will be
[2:50:05.720 --> 2:50:08.920]  useless this will continue to mutate and change the only thing is self
[2:50:08.920 --> 2:50:11.240]  quarantine at home and of course a whole series of
[2:50:11.240 --> 2:50:14.440]  nutraceuticals and they can check with with me on that but there are things
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:17.000]  that will block it the government could have
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:21.400]  installed a system called uh um arrow clave which is developed
[2:50:21.400 --> 2:50:24.840]  with homeland security but they haven't done it to actually cure all aircraft
[2:50:24.840 --> 2:50:28.520]  they could have had a biohazard center center for disease control do mask do
[2:50:28.520 --> 2:50:32.120]  mask help because we can yes you need a nano mask you need a nanoparticle
[2:50:32.120 --> 2:50:34.680]  mask regular droplet masks that the doctors and
[2:50:34.680 --> 2:50:38.280]  nurses have won't do anything that's why it didn't stop the coronavirus or
[2:50:38.280 --> 2:50:42.600]  SARS this is going to be a really big mess because the
[2:50:42.600 --> 2:50:45.800]  doctors are not trained how to do infectious control properly
[2:50:45.800 --> 2:50:50.040]  and they will have casualties but even a regular mass reduces some i mean it
[2:50:50.040 --> 2:50:53.800]  will block a larger a little bit i'm i thought yeah i would not
[2:50:53.800 --> 2:50:57.320]  because the virus will be within a yeah exactly it's gonna really block some but
[2:50:57.320 --> 2:51:01.240]  you want to thank you dr diggle we'll talk to you again tomorrow

[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:11.240]  in the 1976 when they used for force inoculations
[3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:14.840]  that killed a bunch of people steve quayle we're about to break but
[3:03:14.840 --> 3:03:18.280]  thanks for joining us on short notice what's your inside scoop on what's
[3:03:18.280 --> 3:03:21.800]  happening well alex your emergency broadcast
[3:03:21.800 --> 3:03:25.400]  saturday night saturday night was very well timed because
[3:03:25.400 --> 3:03:30.040]  the same control mechanism that was set up in the air airborne command for
[3:03:30.040 --> 3:03:33.880]  martial law basically ordered to stand down all of all
[3:03:33.880 --> 3:03:37.080]  hf frequencies with the military in other words
[3:03:37.080 --> 3:03:42.280]  this is not the big event this is the initiative event this is the igniter
[3:03:42.280 --> 3:03:45.960]  uh event that's going to push us right there and i gotta tell you alex
[3:03:45.960 --> 3:03:48.920]  this is not just something that's going to go away
[3:03:48.920 --> 3:03:51.960]  because with the world health organization and all the different
[3:03:51.960 --> 3:03:57.080]  shills and the mouthpieces for the cdc and mainstream news remember this is the
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:03:59.640]  agenda backing i think you've already talked about this
[3:03:59.640 --> 3:04:03.400]  but back in the air force study that was predicted that was written in uh what
[3:04:03.400 --> 3:04:09.480]  was it 1996 that they were predicting that in 2009 there'd be a live h5n1
[3:04:09.480 --> 3:04:13.320]  avian blue virus that would destroy 30 million people yeah let me stop you
[3:04:13.320 --> 3:04:18.680]  there that was in my stack and i got so busy in the last
[3:04:18.680 --> 3:04:23.480]  three hours that was one of my top stories and i never
[3:04:23.480 --> 3:04:27.720]  even got to it because i'm trying to not scare people
[3:04:27.720 --> 3:04:31.080]  uh you know i'm trying to get some calm here but i think people are owed
[3:04:31.080 --> 3:04:36.440]  to know the fact this was written in march 5th 2009 so a month and a half ago
[3:04:36.440 --> 3:04:39.720]  curt nemo with links to the now declassified documents
[3:04:39.720 --> 3:04:45.000]  us air force study proposed a 2009 influenza pandemic
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:49.480]  for this just this time of year so steve we'll get your expert analysis on that
[3:04:49.480 --> 3:04:53.880]  straight ahead yeah i got a bad feeling about all this and i agree with steve
[3:04:53.880 --> 3:04:57.320]  this is the initiator for something big as homeland security had
[3:04:57.320 --> 3:05:02.600]  tortled and said steve quail is our guest stay with us attention gardeners

[3:08:03.720 --> 3:08:12.440]  proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[3:08:12.440 --> 3:08:17.240]  i have been attempting the last three hours and eight minutes
[3:08:17.240 --> 3:08:21.640]  to just give you all sides all angles all possibilities
[3:08:21.640 --> 3:08:24.840]  in the next government height just a normal flirrelease
[3:08:24.840 --> 3:08:28.120]  the great fear to kind of nip in the bud the revolution
[3:08:28.120 --> 3:08:33.160]  that was online to overthrow the government by this summer
[3:08:33.160 --> 3:08:36.200]  well the problem is they're certainly using it for that
[3:08:36.200 --> 3:08:42.360]  the problem here though is that this is three different flues bird pig human
[3:08:42.360 --> 3:08:48.040]  mixed from all over the world it always comes out of asia
[3:08:48.040 --> 3:08:51.000]  and there's two different flu seasons in the world their season and our season
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:55.640]  it always comes from there always now it's appeared in mexico
[3:08:55.640 --> 3:08:59.240]  uh the reports we're getting and it's been confirmed by bbc and others is
[3:08:59.240 --> 3:09:02.200]  there's a lot more deaths than they're saying a lot more illnesses
[3:09:02.200 --> 3:09:06.120]  than they're saying but flu does that kills 15 000 plus americans every year
[3:09:06.120 --> 3:09:09.080]  and tens of thousands of mexicans because they have a lot less health care
[3:09:09.080 --> 3:09:11.880]  even though there's less people down there 100 million per capita but more
[3:09:11.880 --> 3:09:15.080]  die down there other hundred million people
[3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:18.360]  more than 15 000 die per year and pull up those numbers
[3:09:18.360 --> 3:09:22.360]  but why are they hyping it so much then i want to get steve quail's
[3:09:22.360 --> 3:09:25.080]  take on this steve you've got the floor break it down
[3:09:25.080 --> 3:09:29.080]  uh with uh you know your years of researching this your sources
[3:09:29.080 --> 3:09:33.640]  what you think's going on here well first of all in the 1918 spanish blue
[3:09:33.640 --> 3:09:37.960]  virus was cultivated by cadavers when specific teams from
[3:09:37.960 --> 3:09:42.440]  for detrick and other countries went to areas where
[3:09:42.440 --> 3:09:45.560]  the cadavers or the corpses would have been preserved
[3:09:45.560 --> 3:09:49.800]  now alex i was the first guy i'm only saying is to put things into perspective
[3:09:49.800 --> 3:09:53.560]  to state that the reason this is being cultivated is to be
[3:09:53.560 --> 3:09:57.880]  integrated into a biological cocktail that would be released at a later date
[3:09:57.880 --> 3:10:01.400]  do you remember that i said that on george noria said that on
[3:10:01.400 --> 3:10:04.120]  no no you've been saying that for over a decade everywhere
[3:10:04.120 --> 3:10:08.440]  yes so the point is is that based on my information
[3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:12.600]  listen what most people don't understand is that the biological weapons now are
[3:10:12.600 --> 3:10:15.240]  race specific and i want to cover this i don't know if you've already covered
[3:10:15.240 --> 3:10:18.600]  this but about a decade ago one of the most famous
[3:10:18.600 --> 3:10:22.920]  bio bioengineer scientist was arrested in south africa
[3:10:22.920 --> 3:10:27.960]  who was working on race specific gene-markered bio weapons in other
[3:10:27.960 --> 3:10:30.760]  words if they want target whites to get target whites they want to target
[3:10:30.760 --> 3:10:33.640]  blacks they can target blacks latinos mexicans you name it
[3:10:33.640 --> 3:10:37.880]  and hiv has been reverse engineered that's why it's hundreds of times
[3:10:37.880 --> 3:10:43.160]  more deadly to blacks especially because uh they have the coupler points for it
[3:10:43.160 --> 3:10:48.040]  to plug in on and pure northern europeans do not even have it
[3:10:48.040 --> 3:10:52.040]  that's why they've got studies in bbc just a few months ago about italians
[3:10:52.040 --> 3:10:55.720]  southern italians that have had a big african influx over the past few
[3:10:55.720 --> 3:10:59.400]  thousand years southern italians are very susceptible
[3:10:59.400 --> 3:11:03.000]  to hiv but northern italians which are really austrians basically
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:06.440]  can't get it absolutely now here's what i want people to understand
[3:11:06.440 --> 3:11:10.120]  understand this that you're going to be sent on a
[3:11:10.120 --> 3:11:14.120]  massive massive amount of mixed signals number one it isn't genetic altered
[3:11:14.120 --> 3:11:17.960]  yes it is nothing in nature has it now i like these
[3:11:17.960 --> 3:11:20.760]  the specific strain and the strain that will come
[3:11:20.760 --> 3:11:23.880]  thereafter and the mutant variations in between
[3:11:23.880 --> 3:11:29.560]  imagine having tentacles on the on the ends of the the genes that are
[3:11:29.560 --> 3:11:35.080]  basically able to grab any form of mutating viruses and or
[3:11:35.080 --> 3:11:39.640]  bacteria this is how evil and sinister this is and i think that people had
[3:11:39.640 --> 3:11:42.840]  better understand that this is not a trial run this is the
[3:11:42.840 --> 3:11:46.440]  initiating run for the big run we know this and i i got a touch on this
[3:11:46.440 --> 3:11:50.040]  because you you need to hear this on saturday when you are doing your
[3:11:50.040 --> 3:11:54.040]  emergency broadcast the entire command and control for
[3:11:54.040 --> 3:11:57.560]  martial law goes up in an airborne command structure
[3:11:57.560 --> 3:12:00.840]  they ordered that's the five doomsday planes would say now admit
[3:12:00.840 --> 3:12:04.680]  were activated they told folks sunday morning and admitted they they they
[3:12:04.680 --> 3:12:08.200]  they initiated the martial law control grant under the executive orders go
[3:12:08.200 --> 3:12:11.960]  ahead absolutely but what you don't know is is that
[3:12:11.960 --> 3:12:15.240]  well you were on the air the order went out to literally
[3:12:15.240 --> 3:12:19.560]  every single military um let's say asset that was on hf
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:22.840]  high frequency was told to get off at the same time every
[3:12:22.840 --> 3:12:27.480]  state's emergency communications network was activated so when people think
[3:12:27.480 --> 3:12:31.000]  alexa this is just a bunch of bruja that has no relevance
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:35.480]  that's how serious it was what people you need to understand
[3:12:35.480 --> 3:12:40.360]  that what was going on saturday night was the entire command and control
[3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:44.040]  structure ready to go at a moment's notice
[3:12:44.040 --> 3:12:47.640]  alex what i'm concerned about first and foremost is this no one has done more
[3:12:47.640 --> 3:12:51.160]  investigation in the public sector with the assets
[3:12:51.160 --> 3:12:55.400]  that are available than i have in the genetically altered modification of
[3:12:55.400 --> 3:12:59.000]  viruses from the time mad cow first broke out i said
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:02.360]  listen this is going to be used as a bio weapon prior to it being released in
[3:13:02.360 --> 3:13:05.720]  great britain i said when you've got guys down a new guinea checking out the
[3:13:05.720 --> 3:13:09.800]  headhunters for the disease called kuru i said you can bet your bottom line
[3:13:09.800 --> 3:13:13.880]  somebody's developed a bio weapon the thing that concerns me the most is the
[3:13:13.880 --> 3:13:17.800]  art and antiquities guy in mexico that died 12 hours
[3:13:17.800 --> 3:13:21.480]  later after shaking barack obama's hand the fact that
[3:13:21.480 --> 3:13:25.000]  we we don't know uh... you know at the
[3:13:25.000 --> 3:13:28.920]  expedient nature of his death or how long he may have been exposed prior to
[3:13:28.920 --> 3:13:32.680]  dying is tell tale to me again ladies and gentlemen
[3:13:32.680 --> 3:13:36.760]  10 years ago i wrote the book breathe no evil and alex
[3:13:36.760 --> 3:13:41.160]  given the 96 report given what's going on given everything that's taking place
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:45.480]  this is the traditional uh... a shot fired across
[3:13:45.480 --> 3:13:49.720]  the good ship lollipop u s a and people have better get serious now here's
[3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:51.560]  something i think everybody's got to consider
[3:13:51.560 --> 3:13:55.160]  if this is a specific race or genetic excuse me
[3:13:55.160 --> 3:13:59.320]  a race specific or a genetically marked targeted group of people
[3:13:59.320 --> 3:14:02.680]  uh... a friend of mine dug mac and josh just sent me an email saying steve
[3:14:02.680 --> 3:14:06.760]  cinco de miles coming up and if it is the race
[3:14:06.760 --> 3:14:10.040]  specific a bio weapon then remember this alex
[3:14:10.040 --> 3:14:13.960]  all you would need is people who to gather and large groups across the
[3:14:13.960 --> 3:14:15.800]  country who are
[3:14:15.800 --> 3:14:18.760]  uh... uh... what would you say specifically susceptible
[3:14:18.760 --> 3:14:22.120]  to this form of genetic altered virus and the rest is going to be history
[3:14:22.120 --> 3:14:26.360]  and listen alex it's not you and i make it up these numbers 30 million 40
[3:14:26.360 --> 3:14:30.360]  million 50 million ladies and gentlemen what has been done
[3:14:30.360 --> 3:14:35.320]  is to supercharge uh... three of the most of very one pathogens that have
[3:14:35.320 --> 3:14:39.400]  ever been genetically tweaked in the history of this world
[3:14:39.400 --> 3:14:43.240]  this is absolutely no exaggeration that this thing
[3:14:43.240 --> 3:14:46.440]  is uh... uh... putting is being put forth
[3:14:46.440 --> 3:14:49.800]  in its initial phase as the initiating trigger
[3:14:49.800 --> 3:14:52.840]  to whatever else is out there won't tell you something about chemtrails
[3:14:52.840 --> 3:14:56.200]  they can poo poo everything they want to do to poo poo about it
[3:14:56.200 --> 3:15:00.200]  but when chemtrails started having a genetic binders
[3:15:00.200 --> 3:15:03.560]  incorporated into the barium and all the aluminum and everything else that they
[3:15:03.560 --> 3:15:08.200]  were spraying uh... the point that was obvious is that at some point let's
[3:15:08.200 --> 3:15:12.440]  consider that a primary to a binary weapon
[3:15:12.440 --> 3:15:16.920]  at some point when the chemtrails change then the susceptibility
[3:15:16.920 --> 3:15:20.600]  of the system the human immune system that's been worn down by the initial
[3:15:20.600 --> 3:15:24.280]  chemtrail can be activated that's one point number that's what you and others
[3:15:24.280 --> 3:15:25.720]  have always said is it
[3:15:25.720 --> 3:15:29.400]  is it is that that is uh...
[3:15:29.400 --> 3:15:32.520]  the what's the weapon system called that give you half of it
[3:15:32.520 --> 3:15:35.160]  and then later give you the other half well it's a binary
[3:15:35.160 --> 3:15:39.480]  now and so here's what's critical to people understanding this
[3:15:39.480 --> 3:15:42.840]  but you can literally take the cdc's reports
[3:15:42.840 --> 3:15:46.920]  and go back to when the chemtrails started chemtrails spring started
[3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:50.520]  following it through to when all the reports of how many respiratory diseases
[3:15:50.520 --> 3:15:51.240]  and i'm getting
[3:15:51.240 --> 3:15:54.680]  every day with no exaggeration 20 30 40 emails
[3:15:54.680 --> 3:15:58.120]  of people that are coming down with respiratory crud now i think that it
[3:15:58.120 --> 3:16:01.480]  this is well that's what this flu does is it causes people to die
[3:16:01.480 --> 3:16:05.400]  just like the 1918 swine flu or a bird flu that killed so many
[3:16:05.400 --> 3:16:09.800]  spanish flu i got the name right uh... that one hit the respiratory system
[3:16:09.800 --> 3:16:13.240]  absolutely but what is interesting to people is not only
[3:16:13.240 --> 3:16:17.800]  do they when they you buy it when you're engineering a biological weapon
[3:16:17.800 --> 3:16:22.280]  you absolutely at the same time you are designing the weapon you're designing
[3:16:22.280 --> 3:16:25.160]  the antidote or the vaccine okay
[3:16:25.160 --> 3:16:29.480]  the anti weapon whichever way it's going for chemical warfare it's an antidote
[3:16:29.480 --> 3:16:33.560]  if it's biological it's a vaccine the thing that's telling to me in this
[3:16:33.560 --> 3:16:37.000]  whole thing alex is the fact that the rapidity that it's spreading
[3:16:37.000 --> 3:16:40.120]  throughout the world now i believe the illuminati the new world order
[3:16:40.120 --> 3:16:43.640]  crowd has always gives their signals okay
[3:16:43.640 --> 3:16:47.800]  and one of the signals is there are 751 flights out of a mexico city a day to
[3:16:47.800 --> 3:16:50.040]  point around the world that's the number 13
[3:16:50.040 --> 3:16:53.160]  the first announcement coming out of new zealand was that there were 13 people
[3:16:53.160 --> 3:16:55.960]  infected if everybody knows our history of biological
[3:16:55.960 --> 3:16:58.120]  warfare especially under the second world war
[3:16:58.120 --> 3:17:01.240]  in japan you're dealing with dr ishii and unit
[3:17:01.240 --> 3:17:06.360]  731 which some people said was more accurately called 751
[3:17:06.360 --> 3:17:09.960]  now if you understand to the history of mexico city
[3:17:09.960 --> 3:17:13.640]  and at the whole aztec empire and everything you've got to understand
[3:17:13.640 --> 3:17:19.320]  that there is a severe occult symbolism of meeting at the pyramids
[3:17:19.320 --> 3:17:23.480]  of meeting at the key pyramid where more people were slain in a day
[3:17:23.480 --> 3:17:26.920]  than some armies were slain in a year of fighting in the world listen this is
[3:17:26.920 --> 3:17:29.960]  very esoteric but i knew you would bring this up because i was already
[3:17:29.960 --> 3:17:32.120]  thinking this and we're on the same track
[3:17:32.120 --> 3:17:35.400]  you know when i talk about weather weapons seismic weapons people would
[3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:38.280]  laugh but it's now been declassified it's not the details
[3:17:38.280 --> 3:17:41.800]  here is the news transcript u.s department of defense
[3:17:41.800 --> 3:17:46.360]  if you google dod briefing secretary defense s cohen
[3:17:46.360 --> 3:17:50.520]  earthquake weapons it comes up and here's the transcript
[3:17:50.520 --> 3:17:54.840]  of it 1997 it's on screen right now
[3:17:54.840 --> 3:17:57.720]  let me uh...
[3:17:57.720 --> 3:18:00.760]  he goes on to see alvin toffler has written about this in terms of some
[3:18:00.760 --> 3:18:04.520]  scientists and laboratories to buy certain types of pathogens that would
[3:18:04.520 --> 3:18:08.360]  be ethnic pacific so they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and
[3:18:08.360 --> 3:18:12.360]  races and others are designing some sort of engineering
[3:18:12.360 --> 3:18:16.680]  some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops others are engaging
[3:18:16.680 --> 3:18:21.480]  and and and uh engaging even in a eco type of terrorism whereby they can
[3:18:21.480 --> 3:18:25.000]  alter the climate set off earthquakes volcanoes
[3:18:25.000 --> 3:18:27.480]  remotely to the use of electromagnetic waves
[3:18:27.480 --> 3:18:30.600]  and this is what dick cheney then says in the september 20th
[3:18:30.600 --> 3:18:34.680]  2000 rebuilding america's defenses we want to legitimize the use of race
[3:18:34.680 --> 3:18:38.200]  pacific bio weapons you have a six point oh they've had one of those in
[3:18:38.200 --> 3:18:42.760]  years and it's right on mexico city
[3:18:42.760 --> 3:18:46.760]  right is all this is happening and you're right this is a satanic center
[3:18:46.760 --> 3:18:50.200]  the elites are upset this is all just getting too weird steve
[3:18:50.200 --> 3:18:53.400]  well i can i tell you this alex and i know that there are certain things that
[3:18:53.400 --> 3:18:56.520]  you know we're we're trying to cover but the esoteric nature
[3:18:56.520 --> 3:19:00.440]  of it is the very spirit behind everything you've written about alex
[3:19:00.440 --> 3:19:03.000]  everything you broadcast about though people
[3:19:03.000 --> 3:19:06.600]  see the literal nuts and bolts of how it's being implemented
[3:19:06.600 --> 3:19:10.360]  when these individuals are meeting at the pyramids at when they're meeting at
[3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:14.280]  the sacrificial centers of the world now that you've got to the
[3:19:14.280 --> 3:19:17.480]  uh... earthquakes happening and don't forget one of the biggest volcanoes in

[3:24:40.200 --> 3:24:44.200]  to train everybody to take the vaccines to take the tana flu to take the drugs
[3:24:44.200 --> 3:24:46.520]  the government your friend it gives you a little mask
[3:24:46.520 --> 3:24:49.560]  but they leave our borders wide open while europe
[3:24:49.560 --> 3:24:53.720]  is screening americans and mexicans that fly in they're banning our food imports
[3:24:53.720 --> 3:24:58.120]  to germany and russia and and and england and others
[3:24:58.120 --> 3:25:02.600]  i mean if there's not something to this it's a crime that they're hyping it up
[3:25:02.600 --> 3:25:06.600]  uh... and then we've got all the news of cover-ups of how many have really died
[3:25:06.600 --> 3:25:11.000]  uh... and then you look at this clearly engineered virus the doctors we've had
[3:25:11.000 --> 3:25:14.360]  on have said clearly i mean they usually talk about you know
[3:25:14.360 --> 3:25:19.720]  bird flu mixing with uh... human it some of the variants having evidence of this
[3:25:19.720 --> 3:25:23.560]  and then they say that the maker of the vaccine that the un has chosen
[3:25:23.560 --> 3:25:26.920]  is baxter the company we've been railing against who
[3:25:26.920 --> 3:25:30.760]  tried to who told eighteen sub companies in europe
[3:25:30.760 --> 3:25:34.280]  to mix live bird flu with regular vaccine thank god they got caught
[3:25:34.280 --> 3:25:37.800]  but then some unnamed companies and mainstream news line telegraph
[3:25:37.800 --> 3:25:41.000]  that was paying city workers to give homeless shots and paying them
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:44.600]  and the homeless were dying of bird flu i put that up on screen but the homeless
[3:25:44.600 --> 3:25:47.640]  died of bird flu on people to see these mainstream articles who don't believe
[3:25:47.640 --> 3:25:48.200]  us
[3:25:48.200 --> 3:25:52.920]  i mean something stinks here steve i mean i'm seeing a lot of crazy stuff
[3:25:52.920 --> 3:25:56.760]  i don't know what's coming out of this but definitely this has got new world
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:25:58.280]  where fingerprints all over it
[3:25:58.280 --> 3:26:01.880]  well absolutely and for those of you the people that are biblically inclined
[3:26:01.880 --> 3:26:04.680]  this is the pestilence this is one of the
[3:26:04.680 --> 3:26:07.800]  for horsemen of the apocalypse i think that people need to understand this
[3:26:07.800 --> 3:26:10.600]  we're being isolated alexa said five years ago
[3:26:10.600 --> 3:26:14.600]  the time will come when no trains will run no planes will fly no cars no
[3:26:14.600 --> 3:26:18.440]  vehicles etc america will become completely isolated
[3:26:18.440 --> 3:26:22.840]  it will be isolated in that we will be cut off will be considered the pariah
[3:26:22.840 --> 3:26:26.280]  nation of the world now let's get back to mexico really quick because i think
[3:26:26.280 --> 3:26:27.400]  this is what's going to
[3:26:27.400 --> 3:26:31.800]  take down the economy okay our economy not just mexico's economy
[3:26:31.800 --> 3:26:36.680]  my sources on the ground in that area are claiming two thousand dead
[3:26:36.680 --> 3:26:41.000]  two thousand dead now first of all i believe nothing that comes out of
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:45.480]  official them i believe that the cdc is only there to control
[3:26:45.480 --> 3:26:49.720]  the and and uh how should i say this disseminate the information
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:53.960]  i believe that this is a if you will imagine america as the test tube this
[3:26:53.960 --> 3:26:58.440]  is the test case and so over the years when we you and i would talk about the
[3:26:58.440 --> 3:27:02.680]  depopulation of world ninety percent we got you know all the tinfoil hat boys
[3:27:02.680 --> 3:27:06.200]  who get together on boards and hoist a few scotches to us
[3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:10.920]  but now this is something that even strikes the uh... bolder skeptic
[3:27:10.920 --> 3:27:15.000]  because the smallest virus the smallest bug the question is
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:18.440]  have there are they testing first on a select
[3:27:18.440 --> 3:27:22.440]  confined population i.e. mexicans hispanics
[3:27:22.440 --> 3:27:26.040]  latinos or is this just the fear
[3:27:26.040 --> 3:27:30.280]  to make everyone run to the answer the hegelian dialectic
[3:27:30.280 --> 3:27:35.480]  by injection and take the vaccination i am convinced the vaccination is the
[3:27:35.480 --> 3:27:39.960]  execution dose if you deny or decline to take the vaccination
[3:27:39.960 --> 3:27:43.080]  that's when the camps come in that's when the marshal all comes in alex
[3:27:43.080 --> 3:27:47.080]  oh my god why didn't i see this are you of course
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:50.760]  baxter's caught breeding up millions of dosages
[3:27:50.760 --> 3:27:55.240]  a vaccine with live bird feet flew that the scientist in the check republic
[3:27:55.240 --> 3:27:57.960]  said would be a perfect way to create a master airborne
[3:27:57.960 --> 3:28:00.920]  mutagen with a ninety percent kill rate with that particular
[3:28:00.920 --> 3:28:04.200]  version of bird flu when you can ingest it if you actually get it you're in deep
[3:28:04.200 --> 3:28:06.600]  trouble and then and then they're making all these
[3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:10.680]  vaccines the news won't say where all the vaccine stock went
[3:28:10.680 --> 3:28:14.040]  and then baxter is chosen out of hundreds of major companies
[3:28:14.040 --> 3:28:17.880]  to be the one to make the vaccine for this
[3:28:17.880 --> 3:28:23.560]  flu oh my god oh man this is so insipidly wicked
[3:28:23.560 --> 3:28:28.680]  this is so horrific i honestly believe alex and i i make no bones about this
[3:28:28.680 --> 3:28:34.120]  by the way my my guesstimate on time based on what i'm sensing my god
[3:28:34.120 --> 3:28:37.320]  is from about thursday on things are going to turn
[3:28:37.320 --> 3:28:41.080]  totally bad you know i caught nothing but crap for putting up the orange alert
[3:28:41.080 --> 3:28:43.640]  people were saying oh you shouldn't do this you shouldn't do that and i stand
[3:28:43.640 --> 3:28:47.800]  by that alert i did not put up that alert without a lot of intercessors
[3:28:47.800 --> 3:28:52.200]  praying i sought the lord i said god i cannot afford to be wrong on this one
[3:28:52.200 --> 3:28:55.400]  not for my sake but for your people's sake now here's the deal
[3:28:55.400 --> 3:29:00.040]  the situation that's going on right now is absolutely
[3:29:00.040 --> 3:29:04.040]  so diabolically wicked that the simple western mind
[3:29:04.040 --> 3:29:08.280]  a well-meaning americans cannot even embrace the thought of what you just
[3:29:08.280 --> 3:29:12.360]  had as a revelation they cannot embrace it
[3:29:12.360 --> 3:29:15.480]  therefore because they reject the knowledge
[3:29:15.480 --> 3:29:20.200]  or you know the uh the the mainstream will call you and i the tin foil boys
[3:29:20.200 --> 3:29:24.440]  or whatever you know the bottom line in all this and i keep saying that alex
[3:29:24.440 --> 3:29:28.280]  cutting to the chase this is the initiating action what comes
[3:29:28.280 --> 3:29:35.640]  from this point is the death well take 76 the the swine flu wasn't
[3:29:35.640 --> 3:29:39.640]  killing anybody the president ford orders the whole
[3:29:39.640 --> 3:29:43.560]  public to take it people start taking it and dying in mass and so they
[3:29:43.560 --> 3:29:47.320]  had to pull back so this has happened before
[3:29:47.320 --> 3:29:50.840]  uh man there's a lot of media fear mongering going on we'll break that
[3:29:50.840 --> 3:29:55.640]  down and get back we're on the march the empires on the run
[3:29:55.640 --> 3:30:00.760]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:02.200 --> 3:30:05.400]  in the new world order's war against humanity

[3:33:09.960 --> 3:33:14.280]  hour into the show and then it starts back over with Dr
[3:33:14.280 --> 3:33:18.280]  Tim Penny from Mexico and Dr. Diggle popping in
[3:33:18.280 --> 3:33:22.840]  Paul Watson from England you know I just want to be clear here
[3:33:22.840 --> 3:33:25.960]  the State Department of Random 200 saying they got to sterilize reduce the
[3:33:25.960 --> 3:33:29.480]  population by half biological diversity assessment by the
[3:33:29.480 --> 3:33:33.560]  UN 1996 and others saying they want to get rid of 80% of us
[3:33:33.560 --> 3:33:37.320]  the official statements Dr. Eric Pionka I just use him because it made national
[3:33:37.320 --> 3:33:40.760]  news most people heard about him so it was it was big news for a few weeks said
[3:33:40.760 --> 3:33:45.160]  you know he wants 90% of us to die with it with an airborne Ebola
[3:33:45.160 --> 3:33:47.560]  and then he can't wait for everybody to die and he wants it to be basically
[3:33:47.560 --> 3:33:51.960]  engineered the FBI even went and visited him we called for that
[3:33:51.960 --> 3:33:55.960]  when you go to Pionka's site at UT I haven't checked this in about a year
[3:33:55.960 --> 3:34:03.800]  Google Dr. Eric Pionka UT and it'll be edu it'll be University of Texas
[3:34:03.800 --> 3:34:07.080]  site it's him and druid robes saying he's a druid
[3:34:07.080 --> 3:34:11.000]  and that he loves lucifer this is on the University of Texas site now
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:16.040]  this guy who is a druid goes to class as a druid big beard biologist
[3:34:16.040 --> 3:34:19.240]  he has all these graduate students that sent us threatening emails and people
[3:34:19.240 --> 3:34:21.320]  that oh I went to him 10 years ago he's great
[3:34:21.320 --> 3:34:24.760]  it's them in white lab coats his doctors and biologists
[3:34:24.760 --> 3:34:28.440]  in bio shield bio weapons programs you know the the bio shield program you
[3:34:28.440 --> 3:34:32.040]  hear is to fight bio weapons but they admit it's really a bio weapons program
[3:34:32.040 --> 3:34:35.720]  but the key here is this guy got up and got a standing ovation
[3:34:35.720 --> 3:34:39.000]  at st edwards here in austin it was in the paper and it was also
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:41.960]  Texas Academy of Sciences when he was meeting in south Texas
[3:34:41.960 --> 3:34:45.320]  all over the world he gets standing ovations when he says kill 90% of us
[3:34:45.320 --> 3:34:48.280]  and his graduate students sent me papers saying look
[3:34:48.280 --> 3:34:52.600]  jones he is a conservative i believe the humans are a parasite
[3:34:52.600 --> 3:34:57.800]  we did reports on this at present planet dot com all humans should be killed
[3:34:57.800 --> 3:35:01.640]  so this is what prince philip ted turner the un the kissengers
[3:35:01.640 --> 3:35:05.720]  so when steve gets into all of this they admit their luciferians we
[3:35:05.720 --> 3:35:09.000]  even if you're an atheist the point is cold-bloodedly just from an
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:12.760]  anthropological you know view or studying the the elites you know if
[3:35:12.760 --> 3:35:16.520]  you're studying you know i mean if you wrote a book the elites of the of the
[3:35:16.520 --> 3:35:19.480]  world in the year 2009 you know published
[3:35:19.480 --> 3:35:22.920]  2020 or whatever let's you know imaginary book
[3:35:22.920 --> 3:35:26.760]  it and and and you were just an anthropologist sociologist
[3:35:26.760 --> 3:35:30.760]  looking at what the elites really believed they're a bunch of bloodthirsty
[3:35:30.760 --> 3:35:33.720]  killers that want to kill everybody for guy
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:37.240]  earth first battalion in the pentagon all of this
[3:35:37.240 --> 3:35:40.520]  and so when steve talks about all this from his christian perspective and i'm
[3:35:40.520 --> 3:35:44.440]  a christian as well on a mainline fake christian
[3:35:44.440 --> 3:35:49.000]  regardless the real data shows that and so we have to look at this when they're
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:52.920]  saying swine flu virus may cause global pandemic united nations
[3:35:52.920 --> 3:35:59.320]  uh a french news agency and you know u.s emergency declared and uh in fact i
[3:35:59.320 --> 3:36:02.360]  didn't even get to this it's in my stack of mainstream news
[3:36:02.360 --> 3:36:06.200]  where the u.s government is saying stay indoors in these areas
[3:36:06.200 --> 3:36:10.920]  in texas uh napolitano says the really bad stuff's to come
[3:36:10.920 --> 3:36:14.200]  america's told to wear a mask a swine flu spreads around the globe
[3:36:14.200 --> 3:36:18.040]  remember the media told you that you didn't need mask it was safe at ground
[3:36:18.040 --> 3:36:20.360]  zero we got on there and said you needed them
[3:36:20.360 --> 3:36:24.040]  well the point is you need a nano mask just the regular mask may reduce a
[3:36:24.040 --> 3:36:27.800]  piece of spit in the air somebody sneezes you know some mucus that's got the
[3:36:27.800 --> 3:36:30.200]  virus in it so it does help reduce but it doesn't
[3:36:30.200 --> 3:36:34.520]  completely protect you you get nano mask i worry about folks like my dad who's
[3:36:34.520 --> 3:36:39.000]  a dentist doing bloody procedures every day but again it's all hype right now
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:42.920]  why all the fear why the gearing up and other flues go far more than this
[3:36:42.920 --> 3:36:45.640]  well it's unseasonable didn't come from the east
[3:36:45.640 --> 3:36:52.200]  is a weird transgenetic mixture uh telltale designer came out of mexico not
[3:36:52.200 --> 3:36:56.600]  in the flu season uh just all of this is going on
[3:36:56.600 --> 3:37:01.080]  and other countries are acting scared to death of this something's going on
[3:37:01.080 --> 3:37:04.280]  and i hope they pull back from whatever they're planning uh but you know we've
[3:37:04.280 --> 3:37:07.240]  given you the first few hours the view that it's a hoax the view that they're
[3:37:07.240 --> 3:37:11.000]  hyping it but remember who's doing it they've proven they're capable of
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:12.600]  anything steve quayle
[3:37:12.600 --> 3:37:15.960]  first of all people are emailing me asking me do i think uh
[3:37:15.960 --> 3:37:21.240]  this is just a distraction i would say this is part of the entire plan
[3:37:21.240 --> 3:37:25.560]  because uh alex in everyone i've interviewed over 25 years in the world
[3:37:25.560 --> 3:37:28.680]  of spooks kooks and everything else that comes along the way
[3:37:28.680 --> 3:37:32.680]  and spies counters spies intelligence military etc
[3:37:32.680 --> 3:37:36.840]  the central theme you've got is that these entities okay
[3:37:36.840 --> 3:37:40.360]  that worship lucifer and hate jesus by the way
[3:37:40.360 --> 3:37:44.840]  the idea is is that they are going to distract with as many
[3:37:44.840 --> 3:37:48.120]  issues as they can to simply overwhelm us because look
[3:37:48.120 --> 3:37:51.720]  if it isn't the money system that everybody's worrying about see how many
[3:37:51.720 --> 3:37:54.600]  retire blah blah blah now they got to worry about this worry about that
[3:37:54.600 --> 3:37:58.600]  this is all part of the plan to simply overwhelm
[3:37:58.600 --> 3:38:03.240]  this is the shock and awfulness of lucifer coming at people
[3:38:03.240 --> 3:38:07.960]  now this is not in itself to the degree that it's going to cause the 30
[3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:11.480]  million deaths that's coming i believe that when you start seeing
[3:38:11.480 --> 3:38:15.320]  massive chemtrailing and i'm talking beyond anything you've ever known and
[3:38:15.320 --> 3:38:18.760]  when the chemtrail uh residue starts to touch the ground
[3:38:18.760 --> 3:38:23.320]  you better not go outside you better know the basics of biological
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:26.520]  warfare preparation you better be building your immune system
[3:38:26.520 --> 3:38:30.600]  you better have nano particle mass not just the n95
[3:38:30.600 --> 3:38:34.680]  it's interesting alex we're talking about one of those virulent deadly things
[3:38:34.680 --> 3:38:37.800]  ever conceived and by the way how you can tell this is lucifer
[3:38:37.800 --> 3:38:42.040]  and that it's not a natural thing every single thing that god created in the
[3:38:42.040 --> 3:38:45.800]  book of genesis he created after it's after it's
[3:38:45.800 --> 3:38:49.400]  likeness and kind and thought it's good the thing that the devil wants to do
[3:38:49.400 --> 3:38:53.800]  more than anything is just destroy every parameter every boundary
[3:38:53.800 --> 3:39:01.320]  every active beautiful wonderful godly creation and substitute the luciferian
[3:39:01.320 --> 3:39:05.400]  depth destroying our force into that whole equation so
[3:39:05.400 --> 3:39:09.160]  what does that mean to us right now it means that if dog macintosh the the
[3:39:09.160 --> 3:39:13.080]  guy sent me the email who in my opinion was so far ahead of his time in writing
[3:39:13.080 --> 3:39:16.360]  that you know people poo pooed him on the economy but the deal is
[3:39:16.360 --> 3:39:20.520]  look at if it is a race specific biologically engineered and alex when
[3:39:20.520 --> 3:39:24.200]  wu thard bason ladies gentlemen go google it on my website
[3:39:24.200 --> 3:39:28.840]  stequiel.com when he was arrested the most powerful
[3:39:28.840 --> 3:39:34.280]  richest people in the world demanded his release guess what alex he wrote the
[3:39:34.280 --> 3:39:38.520]  book he was the one that was uh the breakthrough scientists on
[3:39:38.520 --> 3:39:43.720]  race specific targeted genetic weapons now that doesn't scare the hell out of
[3:39:43.720 --> 3:39:47.080]  everybody maybe brother you and i need to just you know hold her breath or
[3:39:47.080 --> 3:39:50.920]  something and if it doesn't provoke them to take action
[3:39:50.920 --> 3:39:57.080]  nothing here nothing the dhs says department of human sacrifice nothing
[3:39:57.080 --> 3:40:01.640]  the uh official mouthpieces say look even to a certain degree
[3:40:01.640 --> 3:40:05.400]  those people at that level don't understand the higher levels
[3:40:05.400 --> 3:40:12.120]  of esoteric murder okay or ritual satanic uh deliverance of the innocence to
[3:40:12.120 --> 3:40:15.880]  death and and i can't fault them on that obviously they don't see it but what
[3:40:15.880 --> 3:40:19.240]  they don't understand is once they're done implementing
[3:40:19.240 --> 3:40:23.960]  they're taking down of quote the red list they get whacked within 30 45 days
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:27.560]  you brought the united nations okay and that professor i remember doing a
[3:40:27.560 --> 3:40:30.440]  uh show with you when you brought him up before
[3:40:30.440 --> 3:40:33.880]  what people don't understand the united nations have a process you ready for
[3:40:33.880 --> 3:40:36.760]  this alex the name of taken down the first
[3:40:36.760 --> 3:40:40.760]  population is called curative process
[3:40:40.760 --> 3:40:46.600]  c u r a i tv the interesting word is it
[3:40:46.600 --> 3:40:50.520]  steve go ahead oh i'm sorry i just want to give you so based on the
[3:40:50.520 --> 3:40:55.880]  based on where we're at right now this is not just a little flash in the pan
[3:40:55.880 --> 3:41:01.000]  this is not the normal vectoring of a pathogenic release this is
[3:41:01.000 --> 3:41:05.560]  simultaneous releases in different parts of the world and normally they would
[3:41:05.560 --> 3:41:09.960]  have been following it as it was in asia moving to europe here it just pops up
[3:41:09.960 --> 3:41:14.520]  in mexico flues don't do that i mean this thing this thing is
[3:41:14.520 --> 3:41:18.200]  clearly manufactured the question is is it a false alarm
[3:41:18.200 --> 3:41:21.720]  or is it what dr deagle was saying earlier wait seems you're saying it's a
[3:41:21.720 --> 3:41:26.360]  carrier to turn into something worse i'm agreeing with dr deagle
[3:41:26.360 --> 3:41:30.440]  but i'm saying that and i absolutely agree with him and the thing is is that
[3:41:30.440 --> 3:41:34.760]  to my knowledge when he and i have talked off off the record not the mic
[3:41:34.760 --> 3:41:39.000]  uh he was intimately and intricately involved in a lot of
[3:41:39.000 --> 3:41:42.440]  the machinations of the viral weapon development
[3:41:42.440 --> 3:41:45.000]  saying all that alex the thing that people need to know
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:49.240]  is what they can do and i'll tell you this they had better consider
[3:41:49.240 --> 3:41:53.400]  the basics they should really be looking at the fact of looking where the
[3:41:53.400 --> 3:41:55.800]  clusters come here's how i think it'll be it'll be
[3:41:55.800 --> 3:41:59.160]  it'll take place the marshal implementation will ultimately
[3:41:59.160 --> 3:42:03.880]  start in stages okay whether it's texas border towns or it's the entire
[3:42:03.880 --> 3:42:08.200]  border but as you said this border isn't strange we've got the most
[3:42:08.200 --> 3:42:13.480]  dangerous pathogenic uh emergency health emergency declared by janet
[3:42:13.480 --> 3:42:16.920]  napolitano and yet the border still stay wide open
[3:42:16.920 --> 3:42:20.120]  and i think that the single demyel which happens i think on may 1st
[3:42:20.120 --> 3:42:23.400]  doesn't or is a may 5th i don't know would during the first five days of
[3:42:23.400 --> 3:42:27.400]  may then you get the whole mayday thing mayday is the time of universal
[3:42:27.400 --> 3:42:32.280]  distress so what i'm saying is based on the occult symbolism that i'm
[3:42:32.280 --> 3:42:37.080]  familiar with this next uh coming five days to 14 days is
[3:42:37.080 --> 3:42:40.440]  going to be absolutely critical if mexico yeah well that's when they
[3:42:40.440 --> 3:42:44.600]  always are launching all sorts of bizarre occult activities launching the
[3:42:44.600 --> 3:42:47.960]  the uh you know revolution of the soviets and others is on mayday it's an
[3:42:47.960 --> 3:42:50.680]  occult day by the way look at dr erick peonka's
[3:42:50.680 --> 3:42:55.000]  ut page it's all about dna sequencing and how he wants to get rid of people
[3:42:55.000 --> 3:42:57.880]  and then you go to his obituary he has a link on there
[3:42:57.880 --> 3:43:02.120]  official university of texas biology department he says i'm not dead yet
[3:43:02.120 --> 3:43:06.120]  and he calls himself the lizard man and the snake man
[3:43:06.120 --> 3:43:11.400]  and then you scroll down he's in here talking about lucifer
[3:43:11.400 --> 3:43:16.440]  and then he names his animals lucifer and then he's dressed up like a druid
[3:43:16.440 --> 3:43:22.040]  in here uh i mean this guy this is who wants 90 percent of us at least to die
[3:43:22.040 --> 3:43:26.040]  and he's got his ranch out there and it says uh
[3:43:26.040 --> 3:43:33.160]  i mean just absolutely amazing it used to have him dressed up like a druid
[3:43:33.160 --> 3:43:36.760]  on here we did find another page it has the picture of him i mean this
[3:43:36.760 --> 3:43:40.360]  that was on his ut side it may be on the subpage i hate to interrupt
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:43.720]  well you know regardless they're going to use all this fear they're hyping
[3:43:43.720 --> 3:43:50.760]  steve uh to get more control over society uh we know that they are uh you know
[3:43:50.760 --> 3:43:53.640]  doing that and training us that they're the saviors
[3:43:53.640 --> 3:43:57.560]  and alex one of the people need to recognize why is it that independent
[3:43:57.560 --> 3:44:03.080]  slash supposedly independent network always use the same neurolinguistic
[3:44:03.080 --> 3:44:07.000]  programming term you turn on cbs it's the same term you turn on
[3:44:07.000 --> 3:44:11.880]  abc or whatever you know msnbc whatever you're looking at bloomberg etc
[3:44:11.880 --> 3:44:15.880]  it's almost like the script writers now listen i have talked to psychological
[3:44:15.880 --> 3:44:20.520]  operations officers at nordcom quote unquote there is nothing that hits the
[3:44:20.520 --> 3:44:25.560]  media printed uh broadcast or spoken on the radio in the
[3:44:25.560 --> 3:44:28.920]  mainstream that they don't uh monitor on daily basis
[3:44:28.920 --> 3:44:32.440]  and that they don't originate or officiate in other words
[3:44:32.440 --> 3:44:36.360]  that's why all the news changes i i thought somebody posting something
[3:44:36.360 --> 3:44:40.520]  said all of steve we're losing your phone volume is going up and down
[3:44:40.520 --> 3:44:46.760]  oh i'm sorry is this better yeah yep uh the the situation that the news media
[3:44:46.760 --> 3:44:51.560]  always uses the same words okay the neurolinguistic program
[3:44:51.560 --> 3:44:56.040]  repeated no it's all scripted it's all scripted globally you can tell exactly
[3:44:56.040 --> 3:45:00.920]  absolutely so what i'm saying is the idea is that this is a
[3:45:00.920 --> 3:45:04.040]  as everyone this is just in the carrier wave
[3:45:04.040 --> 3:45:07.720]  of the next wave to come and the next wave to come is going to be very very
[3:45:07.720 --> 3:45:10.920]  deadly and very very dangerous but that does not mean
[3:45:10.920 --> 3:45:14.920]  that this thing made to dismiss listen these guys test test
[3:45:14.920 --> 3:45:18.680]  test and retest okay by selective
[3:45:18.680 --> 3:45:22.920]  is by selectively introducing a genetically altered virus and testing it
[3:45:22.920 --> 3:45:27.720]  on a specific subject group they can tell if there's a natural resistance that
[3:45:27.720 --> 3:45:31.800]  they didn't anticipate you see alex eighty percent depth isn't enough
[3:45:31.800 --> 3:45:36.040]  ninety percent certainly isn't good enough they want a hundred percent lethal
[3:45:36.040 --> 3:45:41.240]  dose or lethal kill so this is war gaming the response the propaganda
[3:45:41.240 --> 3:45:45.400]  all of it i agree that's how they operate then you have look the final piece
[3:45:45.400 --> 3:45:50.040]  is baxter the company involved with bayer knowingly shipping out
[3:45:50.600 --> 3:45:53.480]  hiv and hepatitis to over a million people
[3:45:53.480 --> 3:45:57.400]  in the factor eight vaccines that is on record that is on record you know
[3:45:57.400 --> 3:46:02.200]  mainstream news just google factor eight folks it'll blow you away msnbc ap
[3:46:02.200 --> 3:46:04.600]  knowingly and they just say oh we normally did it and they're still in
[3:46:04.600 --> 3:46:09.720]  business now they get caught mixing live bird flu with the vaccine stocks
[3:46:09.720 --> 3:46:13.320]  in europe and now the un chooses them to make the vaccine for that
[3:46:13.320 --> 3:46:16.440]  i mean how would you trust these people to clean toilets
[3:46:16.440 --> 3:46:19.800]  much less be making the vaccine i wouldn't but remember this
[3:46:19.800 --> 3:46:23.880]  uh... janet apolitano declared a health emergency remember alex when you and i
[3:46:23.880 --> 3:46:26.680]  were beating the drum on them what was it the uh...
[3:46:26.680 --> 3:46:30.600]  uh... medical emergency health powers act or something amoeba
[3:46:30.600 --> 3:46:34.840]  meh pa i think everybody better go google that
[3:46:34.840 --> 3:46:38.840]  and the thing is i may have a couple of the uh... initials backwards or something
[3:46:38.840 --> 3:46:42.280]  but basically it gives under a health emergency
[3:46:42.280 --> 3:46:47.080]  this is the prime of basia calls for the declaration of martial law
[3:46:47.080 --> 3:46:50.520]  you don't take the vaccine you go into the camps
[3:46:50.520 --> 3:46:53.480]  i'm telling you this is no i mean i mean steve you're right
[3:46:53.480 --> 3:46:57.320]  they have always drilled and trained on record
[3:46:57.320 --> 3:47:00.440]  that they're gonna lock down do force inoculations they've trained the clergy
[3:47:00.440 --> 3:47:03.640]  response teams the first thing is tell the people that's of the lord to take
[3:47:03.640 --> 3:47:06.600]  the shots go to the camps to turn their guns in
[3:47:06.600 --> 3:47:10.680]  they have drilled the whole martial law architecture not around fighting al-qaeda
[3:47:10.680 --> 3:47:14.040]  but around confiscating guns during a breakdown of society
[3:47:14.040 --> 3:47:16.920]  during forced inoculations you're absolutely right
[3:47:16.920 --> 3:47:20.520]  and i just hope this isn't the big one well i believe it's a big one and you
[3:47:20.520 --> 3:47:24.440]  said it in a powerful statement these doctors especially the gentleman you're
[3:47:24.440 --> 3:47:29.160]  quoting in in the university of texas remember this a doctor is trained with
[3:47:29.160 --> 3:47:33.800]  one twist of the scalpel one way to cure with a twist of the scalpel the other
[3:47:33.800 --> 3:47:37.400]  way it kills and they're he or they kill look at the
[3:47:37.400 --> 3:47:41.800]  greatest mass murders in history alex and the besides the cars the aztecs and
[3:47:41.800 --> 3:47:44.200]  others but the thing is is that their doctors
[3:47:44.200 --> 3:47:48.760]  obviously doctor mangala obviously doctor ishii of world war two fame
[3:47:48.760 --> 3:47:52.120]  and it's fascinating when you even take the higher ups of al-qaeda
[3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:56.440]  their doctors are medical doctors the point that i'm trying to make here
[3:47:56.440 --> 3:48:01.160]  is this is that you have a group of sinister
[3:48:01.160 --> 3:48:06.280]  sold out to satan individuals that control the world's financial structure
[3:48:06.280 --> 3:48:11.880]  that now have been given the go ahead to launch the destruction of the planetary
[3:48:11.880 --> 3:48:16.440]  population through all and every means well they're luciferian witch doctors
[3:48:16.440 --> 3:48:19.400]  it goes back to the original calling the twin snakes
[3:48:19.400 --> 3:48:23.560]  absolutely and the point that people have to recognize
[3:48:23.560 --> 3:48:28.840]  is that if you don't act now you'll be forced to react later and and i'm
[3:48:28.840 --> 3:48:32.200]  getting emails because i put out the red alert or excuse me orange alert
[3:48:32.200 --> 3:48:35.880]  and by the way can i make something clear when i put out the red alert and i
[3:48:35.880 --> 3:48:38.600]  don't know if you've heard about this some people i didn't call that but it'd
[3:48:38.600 --> 3:48:42.440]  be called the red screen of death that means that you've got two weeks before
[3:48:42.440 --> 3:48:46.680]  the hammer falls don't dismiss my orange alert it was right i'm telling you this
[3:48:46.680 --> 3:48:52.120]  weekend's going to get very very uh problematic and from that point forward
[3:48:52.120 --> 3:48:55.640]  i can't say that we know at what time because i know the uh...
[3:48:55.640 --> 3:48:59.960]  do you like date for the the exercise of bringing in all the nato troops and alex
[3:48:59.960 --> 3:49:03.080]  no one will come clean with how many nato troops are being
[3:49:03.080 --> 3:49:07.320]  brought into the car my gosh i forgot they're having a huge nato drill
[3:49:07.320 --> 3:49:11.000]  uh... in uh... mexico in arizona
[3:49:11.000 --> 3:49:13.800]  they're having fema drills all over the country
[3:49:13.800 --> 3:49:19.000]  set for next month for pathogenic releases i covered that last week uh...
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:22.600]  when you were on another shows i'm sure to pull this is
[3:49:22.600 --> 3:49:25.240]  very bizarre coincidence if it's not on purpose
[3:49:25.240 --> 3:49:26.200]  um...
[3:49:26.200 --> 3:49:28.280]  don't want to go to the alex
[3:49:28.280 --> 3:49:32.760]  you've got a lot of politics you and i discuss there are no coincidences well
[3:49:32.760 --> 3:49:35.560]  certainly not in the world of politics like roosevelt said if it's something
[3:49:35.560 --> 3:49:38.040]  happens you know it was planned that way in politics
[3:49:38.040 --> 3:49:43.640]  and you put all of this together uh... it certainly is a very very interesting
[3:49:43.640 --> 3:49:47.560]  uh... time to be alive steve i want to throw this out now i have got a
[3:49:47.560 --> 3:49:49.240]  meeting i've got to go to
[3:49:49.240 --> 3:49:52.520]  about fifteen minutes after the show is over but
[3:49:52.520 --> 3:49:56.280]  i promise to go to about fifteen dollars if we give them each one minute when
[3:49:56.280 --> 3:49:59.160]  we come back that would be fifteen over into overdrive
[3:49:59.160 --> 3:50:01.880]  will you do a fifteen minutes of overdrive with me
[3:50:01.880 --> 3:50:05.560]  sure i'll do whatever you want because it's that important alex listen
[3:50:05.560 --> 3:50:08.360]  our days are numbered let me share this with you
[3:50:08.360 --> 3:50:12.840]  ladies and gentlemen the warnings are only in effect until the events take
[3:50:12.840 --> 3:50:16.040]  place when the events are taking place the warning
[3:50:16.040 --> 3:50:21.080]  sees that's where i believe we are alex we are now in the last bits of time
[3:50:21.080 --> 3:50:24.680]  that the mercy of the god of heaven is granting this nation
[3:50:24.680 --> 3:50:28.120]  to actually pleading with this nation through you meet others that are
[3:50:28.120 --> 3:50:30.760]  warning warning warning but the point is the warnings are over
[3:50:30.760 --> 3:50:34.680]  it's now implementation time they don't get any more time we are

[3:56:51.800 --> 3:56:55.160]  the air with steve quail go ahead
[3:56:55.160 --> 3:57:00.600]  go ahead uh nathan you're on the air okay he's gone let's go to leo in um
[3:57:00.600 --> 3:57:04.280]  missouri go ahead uh or is it montana leo you're on the air
[3:57:04.280 --> 3:57:08.680]  hey alexa steve uh you guys stole a little bit of my thunder uh
[3:57:08.680 --> 3:57:11.560]  i'm one of the guys that happens to think this may be real
[3:57:11.560 --> 3:57:15.480]  based on that 96 air force article that came out
[3:57:15.480 --> 3:57:19.240]  saying that 30 million people would be killed by the flu
[3:57:19.240 --> 3:57:22.920]  and by the way i dropped the ball on that i meant to cover that the start of
[3:57:22.920 --> 3:57:26.120]  the show we go into overdrive i'm going to cover that at info wars dot com go
[3:57:26.120 --> 3:57:28.600]  ahead okay and then the other reason i think it
[3:57:28.600 --> 3:57:31.640]  may be real is all these mass graves that are popping up
[3:57:31.640 --> 3:57:35.480]  they're being dug for a reason it's not just one of these things where
[3:57:35.480 --> 3:57:39.400]  by the way that's not a rumor i have the mainstream news articles and i have
[3:57:39.400 --> 3:57:43.000]  the executive orders right here we're going to cover that too when we come
[3:57:43.000 --> 3:57:46.200]  back uh where they are building mass graves and they'll
[3:57:46.200 --> 3:57:50.200]  use a straw man grave that isn't real it is credited steve quail
[3:57:50.200 --> 3:57:54.280]  well absolutely the color is absolutely right you know alex how much more in our
[3:57:54.280 --> 3:57:56.600]  face does it have to be and my answer that is
[3:57:56.600 --> 3:57:59.160]  probably you have to be on your back with the uh
[3:57:59.160 --> 3:58:02.760]  last bits of life looking up at the dirt they're throwing in on you at the
[3:58:02.760 --> 3:58:07.400]  mass grave this should really make most people infuriated
[3:58:07.400 --> 3:58:11.640]  that while we're talking on talk radio today on the 27th of april
[3:58:11.640 --> 3:58:15.560]  the thing is is that these people are planning the extinction annihilation
[3:58:15.560 --> 3:58:19.000]  of a minimum of 40 million people by the way i don't want to make any
[3:58:19.000 --> 3:58:22.920]  misconceptions i believe this is it i believe this is the
[3:58:22.920 --> 3:58:26.040]  uh match that has been left stay there steve we've been getting all
[3:58:26.040 --> 3:58:28.520]  perspectives and we appreciate yours and respect it

[4:00:51.640 --> 4:00:54.200]  wait sherry in california i appreciate you holding
[4:00:54.200 --> 4:00:59.080]  sherry you're on the air hello yes wow okay
[4:00:59.080 --> 4:01:03.160]  yeah i want to know what it means by we have days and weeks i didn't totally
[4:01:03.160 --> 4:01:06.760]  understand what that really means
[4:01:07.320 --> 4:01:10.600]  when steve quail was saying that or when the media was saying that
[4:01:10.600 --> 4:01:14.440]  well i mean he's saying that you know if the globalists are launching their
[4:01:14.440 --> 4:01:18.600]  pandemic flu operation like they did in 1918 like they tried to do in 76
[4:01:18.600 --> 4:01:21.080]  but people refuse to take the shots because the first ones to take it got
[4:01:21.080 --> 4:01:23.960]  sick or died i mean we know the hpv
[4:01:23.960 --> 4:01:26.280]  garter cells killing a lot of the girls that take it
[4:01:26.280 --> 4:01:29.160]  they're practicing just putting this out there we get hurt
[4:01:29.160 --> 4:01:32.680]  and then and then they act like it's no big deal and they move forward i don't
[4:01:32.680 --> 4:01:34.920]  know what's happening you know we had sherry
[4:01:34.920 --> 4:01:39.000]  uh ten penny on medical doctor saying look it looks like this is engineered
[4:01:39.000 --> 4:01:42.840]  she's down in mexico uh but she says they're over hyping it unless it's
[4:01:42.840 --> 4:01:46.440]  going to mutate into something else we had deagle on who said
[4:01:46.440 --> 4:01:48.680]  he thinks this is a beta test for something bigger down the road
[4:01:48.680 --> 4:01:54.040]  then they have homeland security again huh i hope you have deagle on again
[4:01:54.040 --> 4:01:57.560]  no i will but but then uh the head homeland security comes out and says
[4:01:57.560 --> 4:02:00.360]  yeah this one will probably peter out but the next one's going to be the big
[4:02:00.360 --> 4:02:04.280]  one you got the u n saying billions will die for years from bird flu
[4:02:04.280 --> 4:02:08.120]  i mean the flu doesn't normally do that so we're looking at what they're saying
[4:02:08.120 --> 4:02:12.600]  and saying these are eugenicist murderers it's possible they could pull
[4:02:12.600 --> 4:02:15.240]  this uh now steve says he believes that they could be
[4:02:15.240 --> 4:02:18.920]  beta testing and this may be it i don't know but uh i appreciate your call
[4:02:18.920 --> 4:02:21.720]  steve quill we just got him back online he heard that
[4:02:21.720 --> 4:02:25.880]  steve i mean um why just all of these pieces of the puzzle you think they may
[4:02:25.880 --> 4:02:29.960]  be pulling something well absolutely alex i don't believe that this is the
[4:02:29.960 --> 4:02:34.040]  before runner we know that obviously the g20 map we know the builder burgers
[4:02:34.040 --> 4:02:36.840]  map we know that this was a year to go for it
[4:02:36.840 --> 4:02:41.320]  the idea that kissinger statement that by september the guns will be called in
[4:02:41.320 --> 4:02:45.480]  obviously gonna need a mass event to basically begin the mass round up in the
[4:02:45.480 --> 4:02:50.440]  mass assassinations again i say to everyone out there that has had the
[4:02:50.440 --> 4:02:55.400]  census takers show up alex can i just come to cover that just for one minute
[4:02:55.400 --> 4:02:59.240]  i know people that were in the military who were at some of these tea party
[4:02:59.240 --> 4:03:05.320]  rallies i'm talking retired who had census takers at their house within one
[4:03:05.320 --> 4:03:07.720]  hour after the time they left the tea party
[4:03:07.720 --> 4:03:11.640]  but that's been confirmed that's been confirmed the fbi was there they now
[4:03:11.640 --> 4:03:15.240]  call their spy census takers and we covered that in 2000
[4:03:15.240 --> 4:03:18.600]  when i got the long form that supposedly only one in six got
[4:03:18.600 --> 4:03:22.040]  all the other patriots i know that are prominent got the long form do you own
[4:03:22.040 --> 4:03:25.320]  guns what are your stocks and bonds do you have a low flush toilet
[4:03:25.320 --> 4:03:28.680]  you know all of these questions in saying by law you got to answer this
[4:03:28.680 --> 4:03:32.760]  when the form had a line on it only the little top part it was all color of law
[4:03:32.760 --> 4:03:36.120]  and yes they're going to use the new census they're saying what's going to be
[4:03:36.120 --> 4:03:40.040]  monthly as their new little intelligence ops with confirmed
[4:03:40.040 --> 4:03:43.240]  with the gps marking their houses yeah this is
[4:03:43.240 --> 4:03:45.560]  i mean they're really trying to do a takeover here
[4:03:45.560 --> 4:03:49.240]  right and and everybody should know this that one of my listeners one of our
[4:03:49.240 --> 4:03:52.920]  mutual listeners queried the census taker and they even shook their head and
[4:03:52.920 --> 4:03:55.720]  said well this is weird because they're giving us
[4:03:55.720 --> 4:04:00.920]  pre-selected pre-selected addresses to verify that the people are
[4:04:00.920 --> 4:04:03.880]  used so-and-so at this address the census taker
[4:04:03.880 --> 4:04:07.720]  volunteered the information saying normally we just go on canvass everybody
[4:04:07.720 --> 4:04:10.200]  but she said this is weird though it's not weird
[4:04:10.200 --> 4:04:13.800]  if we determine alex the information that's gathered
[4:04:13.800 --> 4:04:19.160]  uh... by the uh... fb i and whoever that's out there it's using the face
[4:04:19.160 --> 4:04:22.680]  recognition uh... software it's a satellite uplink
[4:04:22.680 --> 4:04:28.280]  and then in real-time real-time not you know later in the day or whatever

[4:04:32.520 --> 4:04:35.000]  scouts okay i'm calling them new world order scouts

[4:06:47.640 --> 4:06:52.600]  now uh... yeah yesterday uh... loyte robertson appeared on uh... the ctd
[4:06:52.600 --> 4:06:56.680]  newsnet with a travel advisory from voyage dot
[4:06:56.680 --> 4:07:00.760]  the gc dot c a which is the uh... transport canada thing
[4:07:00.760 --> 4:07:03.880]  and he said canadian traveling to mexico should exercise a high degree of
[4:07:03.880 --> 4:07:07.080]  caution due to occasional demonstrations and protest
[4:07:07.080 --> 4:07:10.760]  and he went on to say canadian should be particularly vigilant in northern
[4:07:10.760 --> 4:07:14.920]  mexico because of the military in drug cartels
[4:07:14.920 --> 4:07:19.320]  you can have to do it well a little more talkie
[4:07:19.320 --> 4:07:24.120]  come on yeah let me comment on that he's saying transport canada got up on tv
[4:07:24.120 --> 4:07:27.160]  and said watch out when you go to mexico because of the shootouts with the
[4:07:27.160 --> 4:07:30.440]  police and military with the drug dealers one of the same two different
[4:07:30.440 --> 4:07:34.920]  drug gangs fighting uh... and uh... because of demonstrations and that's
[4:07:34.920 --> 4:07:37.880]  my issue mexico and we had them uh... the state
[4:07:37.880 --> 4:07:40.360]  department experts on about this and others
[4:07:40.360 --> 4:07:44.600]  was set to probably be overthrown this summer there was a good chance of it
[4:07:44.600 --> 4:07:49.080]  i mean rebellion nationwide that's why i've had state senators on from texas
[4:07:49.080 --> 4:07:53.400]  who are gearing up martial law on the texas border as you know steve
[4:07:53.400 --> 4:07:56.120]  could all this just be being used as hyping over
[4:07:56.120 --> 4:08:00.600]  just a flu that we know it isn't just a regular flu but you know just hyping it
[4:08:00.600 --> 4:08:03.720]  so the government can be the savior so folks start worrying about their lives
[4:08:03.720 --> 4:08:08.120]  and stop worrying about the tyranny well absolutely because in essence if people
[4:08:08.120 --> 4:08:11.720]  are getting too close to the truth the thing you immediately do
[4:08:11.720 --> 4:08:16.520]  is you introduce another situation that takes their eyes off of the big picture
[4:08:16.520 --> 4:08:20.360]  it's just like there's a movement out there to abolish the fed i got news for
[4:08:20.360 --> 4:08:23.640]  everybody but that's already been abolished it's now going to be called
[4:08:23.640 --> 4:08:26.120]  the international monetary authority
[4:08:26.120 --> 4:08:30.280]  the big money is moved to the far east this is set up alex is a total setup
[4:08:30.280 --> 4:08:33.960]  so the thing that i think that most everyone must understand
[4:08:33.960 --> 4:08:38.920]  that the internationally could care less about nationalities they could care
[4:08:38.920 --> 4:08:43.240]  less about loyalties all they want is the raw material and they're the pirates
[4:08:43.240 --> 4:08:47.000]  of the world at large they use they use false
[4:08:47.000 --> 4:08:50.520]  they use false patriotism to control us while they're busy destroying the nation
[4:08:50.520 --> 4:08:53.560]  and then you have your own secret documents their real threat is the red
[4:08:53.560 --> 4:08:57.480]  white and blue thank you uh caller david ontario thank you
[4:08:57.480 --> 4:09:00.600]  thank you carter and louisiana you're on the air with steve quill go ahead carter
[4:09:00.600 --> 4:09:04.280]  hey guys thank you hey uh one thing i wanted to bring up it's a little bit of
[4:09:04.280 --> 4:09:08.280]  my own analysis i think you guys will see that this is probably true they uh
[4:09:08.280 --> 4:09:12.280]  they see us reaching critical mass with the tea parties
[4:09:12.280 --> 4:09:17.000]  conservative estimates with two thousand parties with only 500 people
[4:09:17.000 --> 4:09:21.160]  basically bringing the numbers to a million but we know maybe probably
[4:09:21.160 --> 4:09:24.520]  one out of ten showed up and then places like atlanta and
[4:09:24.520 --> 4:09:28.520]  you know they had 40 000 people that showed up there so what they know is
[4:09:28.520 --> 4:09:32.280]  is i think that another brick and steve's argument is
[4:09:32.280 --> 4:09:37.000]  why now is the time is because they realize they can't put the lid back on
[4:09:37.000 --> 4:09:39.880]  things if they don't you serve us now
[4:09:39.880 --> 4:09:43.320]  then they'll not have a chance in the future well that's what i've been saying
[4:09:43.320 --> 4:09:46.360]  for months the awakening to world government the awakening to the new
[4:09:46.360 --> 4:09:48.920]  world order with them openly announcing it
[4:09:48.920 --> 4:09:52.120]  they the then they need some crisis as they emerge
[4:09:52.120 --> 4:09:56.280]  to play the part of saviors attacking iran attacking pakistan
[4:09:56.280 --> 4:10:00.680]  further global financial plunge stage terror attacks bird flu you know i've
[4:10:00.680 --> 4:10:04.680]  said those are the cards they could play one two three four five six of the
[4:10:04.680 --> 4:10:08.200]  cards or they could play none of the cards but i don't see
[4:10:08.200 --> 4:10:11.160]  them being able to move their agenda forward without a crisis i don't know
[4:10:11.160 --> 4:10:13.960]  if this is the one though but they're sure hyping it so we're here
[4:10:13.960 --> 4:10:17.640]  covering and i hope steve is wrong about this but i respect him
[4:10:17.640 --> 4:10:21.880]  steve did you hear him yes and i hate the brick is absolutely correct but i
[4:10:21.880 --> 4:10:26.840]  think we're alex uh the the thing look i i pray
[4:10:26.840 --> 4:10:31.080]  with tears running down my cheeks that i'm wrong but i know this sounds arrogant
[4:10:31.080 --> 4:10:35.560]  but i'm not the reason i'm not is because it's not just one event
[4:10:35.560 --> 4:10:40.920]  the global collapse of the financial world at all is engineered remember this
[4:10:40.920 --> 4:10:45.800]  the number one prime directive of the new world order and all of its minions is
[4:10:45.800 --> 4:10:50.040]  order out of chaos out with the old in with the new
[4:10:50.040 --> 4:10:53.640]  that means they're willing to self emulate in other words
[4:10:53.640 --> 4:10:57.400]  put to the torch even their property for the sake of
[4:10:57.400 --> 4:11:01.320]  them i mean they call it creative destruction officially they want to
[4:11:01.320 --> 4:11:04.840]  destroy things to bring in their new world order thank you so much carter
[4:11:04.840 --> 4:11:09.480]  george in texas you're on the air
[4:11:09.480 --> 4:11:13.960]  hello yes sir yes um you know the thing is i'm listening to the crisis you know
[4:11:13.960 --> 4:11:17.960]  the thing is i think uh we can deflect this if we can just get involved locally
[4:11:17.960 --> 4:11:22.600]  and deal with this locally at a local level wrong
[4:11:22.600 --> 4:11:25.560]  i say that i don't i don't mean any disrespect to your caller and i'll just
[4:11:25.560 --> 4:11:29.560]  get right to it the situation is that the critical mass
[4:11:29.560 --> 4:11:33.320]  alex that you know is represented tea party we obviously saw that they
[4:11:33.320 --> 4:11:37.480]  little meant the ridicule etc this is where the biological card is being
[4:11:37.480 --> 4:11:41.560]  played now look when you win the game you lay down all your cards at once
[4:11:41.560 --> 4:11:45.000]  okay we've seen cards being played we've seen the
[4:11:45.000 --> 4:11:49.080]  habilification of the patrons we've seen anybody who's a constitutional you
[4:11:49.080 --> 4:11:53.400]  know the whole list of dhs and now at the last card in my mind
[4:11:53.400 --> 4:11:57.400]  that triggered this which by the way i said would be the case even 10 years
[4:11:57.400 --> 4:12:00.520]  ago uh on talk radio that the systematic
[4:12:00.520 --> 4:12:04.760]  elimination of returning veterans who could present a problem i said they
[4:12:04.760 --> 4:12:08.200]  will be systematically isolated and terminated okay
[4:12:08.200 --> 4:12:12.200]  well then i was a crackpot when that card was played alex
[4:12:12.200 --> 4:12:15.800]  that's when the whole thing went into effect in my opinion
[4:12:15.800 --> 4:12:20.280]  now i really do believe that you know time is going to be
[4:12:20.280 --> 4:12:23.400]  very very critical and somebody just sent me a
[4:12:23.400 --> 4:12:28.360]  an email saying don't forget that i think april 30th is waltz perjus night
[4:12:28.360 --> 4:12:33.720]  which is the second most satanic uh... important date on the satanic ritual
[4:12:33.720 --> 4:12:38.280]  calendar after sam hannah salwan all right that's how we
[4:12:38.280 --> 4:12:43.400]  yeah thank you so much george yeah i uh...
[4:12:43.400 --> 4:12:47.240]  it does appear they're playing their cards they're moving into high gear
[4:12:47.240 --> 4:12:51.800]  uh... things are accelerating and i've been telling folks we're entering the
[4:12:51.800 --> 4:12:53.960]  danger zone i don't know if this is it
[4:12:53.960 --> 4:12:57.800]  but we are in the danger zone uh... let's go ahead and talk to nathan in
[4:12:57.800 --> 4:12:59.960]  texas nathan you're on the air
[4:12:59.960 --> 4:13:04.040]  yes sir uh... this is david uh... i have a question
[4:13:04.040 --> 4:13:09.320]  earlier talked about an aspartame and uh... how was grown in bat
[4:13:09.320 --> 4:13:14.520]  and i'm a type one diabetic and my insulin is also grown in bat
[4:13:14.520 --> 4:13:18.840]  and in the united states uh... they have banned
[4:13:18.840 --> 4:13:23.080]  pork and beef insulin which is extracted from
[4:13:23.080 --> 4:13:26.200]  pork from obviously cows and pigs
[4:13:26.200 --> 4:13:30.600]  that's right they have pharmacological they have pharmacological bacteria
[4:13:30.600 --> 4:13:33.640]  they have pharmacological bacteria and crops
[4:13:33.640 --> 4:13:36.840]  that actually in the crops are in the bacteria secrete
[4:13:36.840 --> 4:13:40.520]  that the insulin i knew about that and they also secrete the estrogen when
[4:13:40.520 --> 4:13:42.840]  you hear it's synthetic it's not really synthetic
[4:13:42.840 --> 4:13:45.400]  it's coming from another organism
[4:13:45.400 --> 4:13:48.360]  just like they spray most of the meats you buy now
[4:13:48.360 --> 4:13:53.560]  so they can sell your rotten meat uh... in in uh... latin it translates uh...
[4:13:53.560 --> 4:13:57.400]  the the english translation is virus eating
[4:13:57.400 --> 4:14:00.760]  uh... uh... uh... bacteria eating virus
[4:14:00.760 --> 4:14:04.200]  and they spray this liquid vaccine on most your meats
[4:14:04.200 --> 4:14:09.320]  the problem is it's bred in tanks that come from fetal tissue stock
[4:14:09.320 --> 4:14:13.880]  in many cases so it's being grown in dead human uh... stock in these giant
[4:14:13.880 --> 4:14:15.880]  tanks folks you can't make this up
[4:14:15.880 --> 4:14:18.840]  and and and and then that's sprayed on your meat i mean steve
[4:14:18.840 --> 4:14:21.160]  again who comes up with stuff like this
[4:14:21.160 --> 4:14:24.760]  uh... uh... i'd literally out of the cauldrons of hell
[4:14:24.760 --> 4:14:27.400]  you know jesus made the statement that that they're
[4:14:27.400 --> 4:14:31.720]  that until he puts an end to the evil there will be no end to be born i want
[4:14:31.720 --> 4:14:32.680]  to share something
[4:14:32.680 --> 4:14:38.520]  well these people are so absolutely uh... ready to sacrifice nine tenths of
[4:14:38.520 --> 4:14:40.520]  the world's planetary population
[4:14:40.520 --> 4:14:43.560]  i think people who are christians are better realize this
[4:14:43.560 --> 4:14:47.880]  they have got to stand up they have got to take back of the ground that they've
[4:14:47.880 --> 4:14:51.720]  given because there's one thing more powerful than all the power of hell
[4:14:51.720 --> 4:14:56.760]  it's called the blood of jesus that simply means this is that god is on his
[4:14:56.760 --> 4:14:59.480]  people side and alex what's strange to me
[4:14:59.480 --> 4:15:03.000]  is that the christian churches that are rolling over the new world order
[4:15:03.000 --> 4:15:06.280]  how can they prepare their people except to prepare them for slaughter
[4:15:06.280 --> 4:15:09.000]  well they're not paid for it they're bought and paid for it through the
[4:15:09.000 --> 4:15:14.040]  clergy response teams absolutely so my my you know my inbox is filling up right
[4:15:14.040 --> 4:15:18.120]  now after your show and i mean the point is that during your show and i'm sure
[4:15:18.120 --> 4:15:21.320]  we'll fill up after the show but that's what people have got to understand i
[4:15:21.320 --> 4:15:23.400]  didn't mean to be controversial with the man
[4:15:23.400 --> 4:15:27.400]  but it's too late to get involved locally you know what when i get an email it
[4:15:27.400 --> 4:15:30.680]  says we ought to do this we ought to do that you know that goes it goes in my
[4:15:30.680 --> 4:15:34.440]  junk file because that usually means you do it alex or steve you do it
[4:15:34.440 --> 4:15:37.880]  fortunately there are people are standing up with us not behind us
[4:15:37.880 --> 4:15:41.960]  but the point that has to be gotten is this is ladies and gentlemen
[4:15:41.960 --> 4:15:46.360]  based on the new world orders timeline based on everything getting ready to
[4:15:46.360 --> 4:15:49.160]  happen in the middle east getting everything that's going on in the
[4:15:49.160 --> 4:15:53.240]  world of economics every area that you have known that
[4:15:53.240 --> 4:15:58.280]  was normal or you could trust it it's being taken out from under you and
[4:15:58.280 --> 4:16:02.680]  that's why i say this that they only trust that you can have nowadays is to
[4:16:02.680 --> 4:16:05.160]  have a right relationship with the living god alex
[4:16:05.160 --> 4:16:09.240]  this is biblical stuff it's not just absolutely absolutely i want to end
[4:16:09.240 --> 4:16:11.240]  this in the next 10 minutes because then we're going to go right back into the
[4:16:11.240 --> 4:16:14.200]  retransmission when dr sherry tenpenny joined us from
[4:16:14.200 --> 4:16:16.440]  mexico that'll be perfect timing as we go back into
[4:16:16.440 --> 4:16:20.440]  the refeed from the first hour uh... steve let's talk to tom in new york
[4:16:20.440 --> 4:16:23.160]  tom in new york you're on the air go ahead
[4:16:23.160 --> 4:16:27.960]  hey alex how you doing good um i've got a quick question and a quick comment
[4:16:27.960 --> 4:16:32.440]  um quick question i was wondering if you saw that uh... the obama legal
[4:16:32.440 --> 4:16:34.840]  team is pushing for the right to
[4:16:34.840 --> 4:16:39.000]  uh... for military recruiters to approach minors
[4:16:39.000 --> 4:16:42.760]  uh... in california where of a law was just passed it would
[4:16:42.760 --> 4:16:46.200]  prevent such from happening yeah well they've they've gone in and are brain
[4:16:46.200 --> 4:16:48.680]  washing the kids in the school setting up
[4:16:48.680 --> 4:16:53.000]  uh... you know recruiting in the schools and they threaten them with arrest
[4:16:53.000 --> 4:16:55.640]  if they don't sign up for the military telling them it's the law and the guys
[4:16:55.640 --> 4:16:57.640]  that get caught doing that get promoted
[4:16:57.640 --> 4:17:01.880]  also the new head of the department of transportation is the head of mad
[4:17:01.880 --> 4:17:05.400]  and they want warrantless checkpoints breathalysers for everybody at check
[4:17:05.400 --> 4:17:09.400]  points no more fourth amendment uh... dna testing on the side of the road
[4:17:09.400 --> 4:17:13.720]  i mean hell is being released everything bush did is being expanded by obama
[4:17:13.720 --> 4:17:17.400]  you've got obama zombie stumbling around having no idea what's happening
[4:17:17.400 --> 4:17:21.560]  totally deceived again uh... obama is their closer
[4:17:21.560 --> 4:17:25.080]  i mean i agree with steve the cards are being laid on the table right now it's
[4:17:25.080 --> 4:17:27.480]  just gonna get more insane from here on out
[4:17:27.480 --> 4:17:32.360]  uh... but anything else tom um... yeah i just had one quick comment on
[4:17:32.360 --> 4:17:37.240]  i i i mean absolutely no offense to anyone as far as the religious believe
[4:17:37.240 --> 4:17:42.680]  myself i'm personally religious uh... but you know i i'm completing my master's
[4:17:42.680 --> 4:17:46.680]  degree in uh... political science and economics and i've got a lot of friends
[4:17:46.680 --> 4:17:49.480]  at my university that i try to turn on to your show
[4:17:49.480 --> 4:17:53.240]  but a lot of them just feel that there's a little bit too much
[4:17:53.240 --> 4:17:57.080]  um... religious doctrine being introduced in the sense of
[4:17:57.080 --> 4:18:01.320]  blood of christ this well i mean the issue here is is that i have a news show
[4:18:01.320 --> 4:18:03.880]  but i do have christian guest on and i don't censor
[4:18:03.880 --> 4:18:07.640]  what they say and do and i think you know you've got all this humanist religion
[4:18:07.640 --> 4:18:10.200]  and environmental religion is just repackaged
[4:18:10.200 --> 4:18:14.200]  being pushed everywhere all this guy stuff and we've studied the new world
[4:18:14.200 --> 4:18:17.080]  order we know who they are we know their goddess
[4:18:17.080 --> 4:18:20.680]  and we're telling people the final level of this i folks don't look at our track
[4:18:20.680 --> 4:18:23.560]  record no one look at all the accurate things we've done here
[4:18:23.560 --> 4:18:27.000]  and don't want to you know test their spirit their instincts their gut
[4:18:27.000 --> 4:18:31.000]  you know their success then fine uh... but you know this is free speech people
[4:18:31.000 --> 4:18:32.920]  like oh my god christian stuff i don't want to hear it
[4:18:32.920 --> 4:18:35.800]  but i don't want to i want to address that alex because first of all this
[4:18:35.800 --> 4:18:39.080]  christian especially me now he's taking a shot at me so i want the right to
[4:18:39.080 --> 4:18:43.000]  respond to the thing is he's a political science major
[4:18:43.000 --> 4:18:47.400]  and economics major no offense he sounds very young but he hasn't been at this
[4:18:47.400 --> 4:18:51.080]  for 36 years he doesn't have the track record and i make no apologies for
[4:18:51.080 --> 4:18:53.720]  jesus these people are out worshiping satan
[4:18:53.720 --> 4:18:58.280]  putting pictures of uh... the president states up on the presidential seal
[4:18:58.280 --> 4:19:02.520]  in his bra with his arms outstretched in the crown of thorns on his head
[4:19:02.520 --> 4:19:06.680]  the thing is look i make no apologies this guy has nothing to offer
[4:19:06.680 --> 4:19:11.480]  and quite candidly i i you know i i i categorically reject his criticism
[4:19:11.480 --> 4:19:15.400]  because it's a name once again he cannot deal with the fact he deals with the
[4:19:15.400 --> 4:19:17.640]  attack the messenger and i gotta tell you this
[4:19:17.640 --> 4:19:20.600]  you know i know that the hs would love to hire him
[4:19:20.600 --> 4:19:24.280]  well let me just say this i mean they when obama goes to speak now at a
[4:19:24.280 --> 4:19:28.200]  university in a church they cover up jesus in latin
[4:19:28.200 --> 4:19:32.920]  like their vampires or something and i understand sir that you're saying
[4:19:32.920 --> 4:19:35.560]  i mean i actually understand what you're saying there's people so afraid of
[4:19:35.560 --> 4:19:40.040]  hearing anything christian that that you're trying to pass the show on to
[4:19:40.040 --> 4:19:43.080]  him but they need to intellectually open up a little bit more
[4:19:43.080 --> 4:19:47.000]  and not be so scared of other ideas and other things and not
[4:19:47.000 --> 4:19:50.600]  you know i mean even if they hate christians why why throw the baby out with
[4:19:50.600 --> 4:19:55.400]  the bathwater just because they're so afraid of hearing any of that i mean
[4:19:55.400 --> 4:19:58.440]  i guarantee if i talk to your friends who don't like this they would say i
[4:19:58.440 --> 4:20:01.560]  don't want to hear about luciferianism and bohemian grove and the occult
[4:20:01.560 --> 4:20:04.840]  because that doesn't exist no no even if you don't believe
[4:20:04.840 --> 4:20:09.720]  in anything spiritual the elites do and from a sociological perspective they
[4:20:09.720 --> 4:20:15.240]  are manifesting hell on earth because they believe in it go ahead call her
[4:20:15.240 --> 4:20:18.920]  to agree with you like i said myself you know i'm i'm religious personally
[4:20:18.920 --> 4:20:22.360]  um but all i was trying to say is i feel that
[4:20:22.360 --> 4:20:26.760]  uh sometimes you could more widely spread your image and maybe
[4:20:26.760 --> 4:20:31.240]  um you know not not scare people away if the religious overtones were just
[4:20:31.240 --> 4:20:35.160]  slightly turned i don't hear your point i mean i hear your point that's but i
[4:20:35.160 --> 4:20:39.080]  mean i'm almost deep a comment but i want to say this we're not here though
[4:20:39.080 --> 4:20:42.840]  to to tailor our message to try to reach as many people we're here to tell what
[4:20:42.840 --> 4:20:46.360]  we believe is the truth what we believe has been revealed what we've learned
[4:20:46.360 --> 4:20:51.160]  and we're not compromising steve religious is a wonderful buzzword it is not
[4:20:51.160 --> 4:20:53.880]  religion is relationship and here's the deal
[4:20:53.880 --> 4:20:57.000]  everybody quotes the book of revelation everybody talks about
[4:20:57.000 --> 4:21:01.160]  all the prophecies but when it comes to jesus and when it comes to anything he's
[4:21:01.160 --> 4:21:03.960]  taboo okay but when it comes to lucifer satanism
[4:21:03.960 --> 4:21:08.120]  anything goes except jesus and to that i categorically reject the argument alex
[4:21:08.120 --> 4:21:11.160]  i'm just picking on the caller i'm saying people that bring that up
[4:21:11.160 --> 4:21:14.600]  religious what does that mean a satanist is religious
[4:21:14.600 --> 4:21:20.120]  uh a child sacrifice or is religious so the point is is that that that is a
[4:21:20.120 --> 4:21:24.120]  argument thrown in to take away from the bullet validity of our information i
[4:21:24.120 --> 4:21:28.200]  mean steve look at all the occultism everywhere look at all the pyramids all
[4:21:28.200 --> 4:21:32.680]  the cabala and i mean i mean the world is a wash in occultism
[4:21:32.680 --> 4:21:36.440]  and and harry potter but then we talk about christianity he's like
[4:21:36.440 --> 4:21:41.080]  and i'm not gonna say this it is an invalid intellectual argument it's
[4:21:41.080 --> 4:21:45.400]  nothing but a personal opinion and again i would hope for the gentleman's sake
[4:21:45.400 --> 4:21:48.280]  that he learns to turn religion into relationship and
[4:21:48.280 --> 4:21:52.440]  and understand this that is a far different cry and alex i make no apologies
[4:21:52.440 --> 4:21:56.120]  for listen the people that have ears to hear
[4:21:56.120 --> 4:22:00.040]  are listening the people that have eyes to see are seeing the people that are
[4:22:00.040 --> 4:22:03.640]  ready to do are doing and when you do what you do and i do what i do
[4:22:03.640 --> 4:22:06.760]  and people have done nothing who say well you guys that have a bigger audience
[4:22:06.760 --> 4:22:10.920]  i gotta tell you something i'm only out to speak to those who have ears to
[4:22:10.920 --> 4:22:15.000]  hear and eyes to see no i hear you and and but i i think he
[4:22:15.000 --> 4:22:19.000]  i understand you're you're rebuking the people that can't stand hearing the
[4:22:19.000 --> 4:22:22.040]  show he was just mentioning what does he do about them
[4:22:22.040 --> 4:22:25.000]  and you know my answer to them is they need to get a little bit thicker skin of
[4:22:25.000 --> 4:22:27.880]  itself setting them but see they're afraid something in them doesn't want
[4:22:27.880 --> 4:22:31.160]  them to hear this but because because they don't want to have to deal with
[4:22:31.160 --> 4:22:34.680]  god or his demands or his judgments and see that's something
[4:22:34.680 --> 4:22:38.360]  that's you cannot deal with that everybody says god bless america and you
[4:22:38.360 --> 4:22:42.040]  ask they ask okay based on the nature of the living god
[4:22:42.040 --> 4:22:45.320]  how can he bless evil because the only one that's promulgating
[4:22:45.320 --> 4:22:50.200]  or putting forth evil Satan so it's a contradictory uh... mindset in my opinion
[4:22:50.200 --> 4:22:54.200]  yeah okay let's go ahead i mean you can deny that god and the devil exists
[4:22:54.200 --> 4:22:57.320]  folks i'd be okay you can try to deny that all day
[4:22:57.320 --> 4:23:00.840]  the issue is you can't deny that the world leaders are a bunch of luciferians
[4:23:00.840 --> 4:23:04.040]  that's a fact now now why is that well what are you gonna do about it
[4:23:04.040 --> 4:23:09.160]  uh... let's go ahead and talk to uh... bill in connecticut bill you're on the
[4:23:09.160 --> 4:23:10.120]  air go ahead
[4:23:10.120 --> 4:23:13.640]  hey ox how you doing good how you doing steve god bless you man
[4:23:13.640 --> 4:23:14.520]  thank you
[4:23:14.520 --> 4:23:18.120]  hey uh... guys you know i know what you've been talking about all day here today
[4:23:18.120 --> 4:23:21.640]  and that's all great but i just wanted to throw this at you
[4:23:21.640 --> 4:23:27.000]  did you know that air force one buzz downtown new york city this morning
[4:23:27.000 --> 4:23:31.240]  yes air bloomberg is flipping out these guys had fighter jets and everything
[4:23:31.240 --> 4:23:33.960]  flying all around downtown manhattan
[4:23:33.960 --> 4:23:37.160]  okay and they thought that there was another terrorist attack on
[4:23:37.160 --> 4:23:39.560]  so you think that the symbolism of that is going on
[4:23:39.560 --> 4:23:42.360]  yeah i think of the symbolism of that you've got air force one over the
[4:23:42.360 --> 4:23:46.600]  Statue of Liberty i'm told by people that saw the event caller that
[4:23:46.600 --> 4:23:50.520]  the you know our force one literally flew over the Statue of Liberty
[4:23:50.520 --> 4:23:53.960]  that basically that's the violation of the protocol of the new york airspace
[4:23:53.960 --> 4:23:56.600]  but i guess if you're the commander in chief you can do what you want
[4:23:56.600 --> 4:24:00.360]  and meanwhile you got earthquakes huge ones and and flew and
[4:24:00.360 --> 4:24:03.960]  and now what is this where they freak out new york buzzing downtown
[4:24:03.960 --> 4:24:09.240]  right where the towers were well i think it's important the towers going down
[4:24:09.240 --> 4:24:13.480]  and listen to this alec on the largest area of you know
[4:24:13.480 --> 4:24:17.560]  a real estate that has been the where they came whether people want to admit
[4:24:17.560 --> 4:24:21.320]  it or not there's the mystery Babylon part of the book of
[4:24:21.320 --> 4:24:24.760]  revelations is still interesting the kings of the earth commit fornication
[4:24:24.760 --> 4:24:28.520]  with this entity known as mystery Babylon i think it's
[4:24:28.520 --> 4:24:31.640]  fascinating now when you were talking now it's just moments ago about the
[4:24:31.640 --> 4:24:35.240]  religious quote images of jesus being covered up
[4:24:35.240 --> 4:24:38.760]  and in its place the triangle with the uh with the
[4:24:38.760 --> 4:24:43.080]  illuminous message that the face in the triangle is now the all-seeing eye
[4:24:43.080 --> 4:24:46.520]  i think that what we're seeing is the announcement and quite candid i think
[4:24:46.520 --> 4:24:50.200]  in a call terminology i think this is what david wilkerson is worried about i
[4:24:50.200 --> 4:24:53.160]  think new york is going to get hit with such an incredible
[4:24:53.160 --> 4:24:57.160]  uh... set of circumstances that the whole world is going to real
[4:24:57.160 --> 4:25:00.360]  in repulsion and shocker what's going to get ready to happen to new york and i'm
[4:25:00.360 --> 4:25:04.520]  not thinking it's that far off
[4:25:04.520 --> 4:25:07.880]  um... uh... what else was bloomberg saying i'm gonna have to tell the report
[4:25:07.880 --> 4:25:12.440]  about the buzzing uh... but i didn't see much more than that just came in here
[4:25:12.440 --> 4:25:15.240]  uh... what i don't know what what specifically happened
[4:25:15.240 --> 4:25:19.560]  well no they had it on tv bloomberg uh... apparently afterwards they flipped
[4:25:19.560 --> 4:25:22.520]  out what they had off f-16s with along with the
[4:25:22.520 --> 4:25:27.240]  air force one flying around downtown and people were
[4:25:27.240 --> 4:25:30.600]  flipping out and literally going out of the building leaving the buildings
[4:25:30.600 --> 4:25:33.000]  thinking that something else was going to happen
[4:25:33.000 --> 4:25:36.360]  um... you know downer that was first thing this morning bloomberg
[4:25:36.360 --> 4:25:40.440]  flipped out uh... and uh... called a press conference
[4:25:40.440 --> 4:25:44.440]  uh... pertaining to it in the white house that there said it was a photo op
[4:25:44.440 --> 4:25:49.000]  um... and you know all the rest of the stuff and uh... steve if i may
[4:25:49.000 --> 4:25:53.320]  uh... jay wilkerson happens to be my pastor all fortunate you know that you
[4:25:53.320 --> 4:25:57.400]  know what a wonderful man he is absolutely and you know i i think it's
[4:25:57.400 --> 4:25:59.720]  uh...
[4:25:59.720 --> 4:26:05.400]  and i'll tell you hey what a what a world we live in but in any case um...
[4:26:05.400 --> 4:26:08.360]  i just thought that that was very interesting that you know you've got
[4:26:08.360 --> 4:26:11.480]  this stuff going on these guys doing this whole thing
[4:26:11.480 --> 4:26:15.000]  and i want to ask you steve what do you think about
