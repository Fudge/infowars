[00:00.000 --> 00:17.840]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:17.840 --> 00:21.520]  Newell Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton has been calling out China for its response to this
[00:21.520 --> 00:26.240]  outbreak, suggesting the virus may have come from China's biological warfare program.
[00:26.240 --> 00:29.000]  The Chinese ambassador to the United States responded this.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.120]  It's very dangerous to stir up suspicion, rumors and spread them among the people.
[00:33.120 --> 00:38.200]  For one thing, this will create panic, another thing that it will offend up of racial discrimination,
[00:38.200 --> 00:43.240]  xenophobia, all these things that will really harm our joint efforts to combat the virus.
[00:43.240 --> 00:46.080]  Of course, there are all kinds of speculation and rumors.
[00:46.080 --> 00:50.160]  So far, at least 69,000 people have been infected with coronavirus.
[00:50.160 --> 00:52.240]  Over 1,600 have died.
[00:52.240 --> 00:54.440]  Maria, the situation is very grave.
[00:54.440 --> 00:58.480]  In part because, as you say, China was lying from the beginning, and they're still lying
[00:58.480 --> 00:59.480]  today.
[00:59.480 --> 01:02.720]  And also because there are so many unknowns about this virus.
[01:02.720 --> 01:07.280]  For example, how many people one person can infect once they have the virus, the extent
[01:07.280 --> 01:09.840]  to which it's contagious before one is symptomatic.
[01:09.840 --> 01:15.160]  Maria, they have more than 70 million people now under quarantine, and you've probably
[01:15.160 --> 01:20.640]  seen the videos online from social media sites, as have I, of the Chinese Communist
[01:20.640 --> 01:25.840]  Party's police beating people who they think might have coronavirus or trying to keep them
[01:25.840 --> 01:31.520]  locked inside of their apartments or quarantining them in large hospitals or what have you.
[01:31.520 --> 01:34.600]  They have not been transparent at all, and they need to be.
[01:34.600 --> 01:38.480]  This virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market.
[01:38.480 --> 01:43.000]  Epidemiologists who are widely respected from China, who have published or studied in the
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.280]  International Journal of the Lancet, have demonstrated that several of the original
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.640]  cases did not have any contact with that food market.
[01:50.640 --> 01:54.280]  The virus went into that food market before it came out of that food market.
[01:54.280 --> 01:57.640]  So we don't know where it originated, but we do know that we have to get to the bottom
[01:57.640 --> 01:58.640]  of that.
[01:58.640 --> 02:04.000]  We also know that just a few miles away from that food market is China's only biosafety
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.840]  level four super laboratory that researches human infectious diseases.
[02:08.840 --> 02:13.000]  We have such laboratories ourselves in the United States run by our military in large
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.880]  part done for preventative purposes or trying to discover vaccines or to protect our own
[02:18.880 --> 02:19.880]  soldiers.
[02:19.880 --> 02:24.240]  China is obviously very secretive about what happens at the Wuhan laboratory, but China
[02:24.240 --> 02:28.480]  continues to block our ability to ask those questions and get that evidence.
[02:28.480 --> 02:34.120]  Well, the burden of proof right now is on the Chinese Communist Party and the ambassador
[02:34.120 --> 02:36.840]  of China and his fellow communists.
[02:36.840 --> 02:40.840]  They have lied consistently about this virus from the beginning, so we should not take
[02:40.840 --> 02:47.160]  their word at face value and no, we don't want to have a public panic, but we do want
[02:47.160 --> 02:52.240]  to err on the side of caution when so much is unknown and that is consistently what China
[02:52.240 --> 02:56.800]  has not done by consistently lying to its own people and to the world.
[02:56.800 --> 03:01.360]  They have created a situation where we have not been able to take the preventative measures
[03:01.360 --> 03:04.920]  that we might have and we have not been able to err on the side of caution.
[03:04.920 --> 03:09.200]  We went from a situation where they are reporting only a couple hundred more cases or maybe
[03:09.200 --> 03:13.520]  a thousand more cases a day to almost fourteen thousand cases in a single day.
[03:13.520 --> 03:16.200]  That wasn't the result of any scientific discovery.
[03:16.200 --> 03:21.320]  That was a political decision to finally reveal what they knew to be true, yet they are still
[03:21.320 --> 03:26.360]  covering up in all likelihood the number of cases and deaths from coronavirus inside
[03:26.360 --> 03:27.360]  of China.
[03:27.360 --> 03:34.840]  It is Monday, February 17th, the year is 2020, we're 259 days out from the historic
[03:34.840 --> 03:35.840]  election.
[03:35.840 --> 03:43.480]  And I wanted to kick the transmission off today with Senator Cotton, as you just heard,
[03:43.480 --> 03:50.600]  on Fox News laying out the fact that all the evidence points towards this virus being man-made
[03:50.600 --> 03:55.760]  and the communist Chinese have been putting out false numbers on the number of infected
[03:55.760 --> 03:58.960]  and the number of people that have died.
[03:58.960 --> 04:03.960]  There's some excellent boil downs that lay all this down up on infowars.com.
[04:03.960 --> 04:09.240]  As coronavirus numbers don't add up and the White House doesn't believe them, we're going
[04:09.240 --> 04:14.000]  to be breaking all of this down when we come back on the other side.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.400]  That is a report out of zero hedge.
[04:17.400 --> 04:21.400]  And of course, we just played a clip of this, Senator Cotton China refusing to hand over
[04:21.400 --> 04:25.560]  evidence about Wuhan Biolab.
[04:25.560 --> 04:30.320]  We know they're using this as a giant police state crackdown in China.
[04:30.320 --> 04:33.560]  And now they're saying it's going to mutate like the flu every year and basically be here
[04:33.560 --> 04:34.760]  forever.
[04:34.760 --> 04:38.800]  And Bill Gates is saying it could kill 10 million alone in Africa.
[04:38.800 --> 04:42.240]  More and more, it looks like this wasn't just an escaped bioweapon that was being developed
[04:42.240 --> 04:48.320]  for a vaccine, but that it's part of a larger, globalist move against the nation state.
[04:48.320 --> 04:52.120]  A global government to answer the crisis of a global pandemic.
[04:52.120 --> 04:54.920]  We're going to lay it all out on the other side.
[04:54.920 --> 04:55.920]  Please spread the word.
[04:55.920 --> 04:58.720]  You are the modern Paul Revere's.
[04:58.720 --> 05:04.560]  The evidence is overwhelming, coronavirus is a man made bioweapon designed to destroy
[05:04.560 --> 05:10.640]  nation states, economies and free peoples and usher in a planetary government.
[05:10.640 --> 05:13.080]  This is how the globalists are striking back.
[05:13.080 --> 05:15.280]  Here's a fortune headline today.
[05:15.280 --> 05:22.000]  Fears of global coronavirus contagion rage as 3000 cruise ship passengers return home.
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.160]  And that's just in one nation.
[05:25.160 --> 05:30.680]  This deals a major blow to German car factories in China that reporting it could cut their
[05:30.680 --> 05:34.480]  sales in half this year.
[05:34.480 --> 05:37.800]  That's how major this is.
[05:37.800 --> 05:39.400]  Everyone needs to be prepared.
[05:39.400 --> 05:43.080]  2020 is not a year to play games.
[05:43.080 --> 05:48.080]  Info wars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out, regardless of
[05:48.080 --> 05:52.160]  the fact that the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth.
[05:52.160 --> 05:57.560]  We need you to step into the plate and help spread the word about band.video and infowars.com
[05:57.560 --> 06:18.560]  today.
[06:18.560 --> 06:23.840]  It is Monday, February 17th, the year is 2020.
[06:23.840 --> 06:28.520]  I am your host Alex Jones and we're going to have a jam-packed transmission today with
[06:28.520 --> 06:34.120]  Owen Schreuer, Max Kaiser and so much more.
[06:34.120 --> 06:41.120]  But I wanted to come to you at the very beginning of the broadcast and just point out that we've
[06:41.120 --> 06:45.400]  done the research, we've done the background investigations, we've interviewed the top
[06:45.400 --> 06:52.960]  experts like Dr. Francis Boyle that authored the U.S. bio weapons law that became the global
[06:52.960 --> 06:54.880]  treaty.
[06:54.880 --> 06:58.800]  We have had so many of the top journalists on that have major contacts in China, Hong
[06:58.800 --> 07:06.040]  Kong and Taiwan and we have really successfully chronicled what's really happening with this
[07:06.040 --> 07:08.800]  virus and the fact that it's man-made.
[07:08.800 --> 07:13.160]  Info wars has yet again been the very vanguard and the tip of the spear.
[07:13.160 --> 07:15.800]  Now that's really not been that hard.
[07:15.800 --> 07:19.560]  The establishment media has known what's going on from the beginning as well.
[07:19.560 --> 07:23.440]  They have just been involved in an active cover-up.
[07:23.440 --> 07:30.880]  So before I get to the latest breaking information, I want to play a clip from the end of last
[07:30.880 --> 07:37.320]  night's Sunday broadcast in the last 10 minutes or so when I had Mike Adams on because I came
[07:37.320 --> 07:43.560]  out of break and I said, look, the evidence is mounting, the preparation, the pre-programming,
[07:43.560 --> 07:49.200]  the global scripting, governments working in unison, other than the U.S. shows me that
[07:49.200 --> 07:55.120]  this is a man-made bio weapon as we already know that has been purposely released.
[07:55.120 --> 07:59.800]  And then Mike Adams revealed to me on air and to you on air that he was about to come
[07:59.800 --> 08:04.720]  out today on Monday with just that assessment.
[08:04.720 --> 08:09.520]  We tried to be very, very conservative about this, tried to not scare people, but the evidence
[08:09.520 --> 08:11.840]  is mounting this is extremely serious.
[08:11.840 --> 08:17.680]  So here's a few minutes from that interview, the full interview is posted at band.video
[08:17.680 --> 08:20.600]  with Mike Adams of naturalnews.com last night.
[08:20.600 --> 08:21.600]  I've studied it.
[08:21.600 --> 08:23.760]  I've looked at it at every angle.
[08:23.760 --> 08:27.280]  Mike's held back a lot and says, well, clearly it's released and they're using it as a power
[08:27.280 --> 08:29.840]  grab, but it looks like it escaped.
[08:29.840 --> 08:30.840]  You know what?
[08:30.840 --> 08:31.840]  I don't think it escaped.
[08:31.840 --> 08:32.840]  I think they released it.
[08:32.840 --> 08:33.840]  Now that's speculation.
[08:33.840 --> 08:35.880]  And I'm not saying Mike's wrong.
[08:35.880 --> 08:39.560]  Either way, you've got all these governments agreeing with each other and they're getting
[08:39.560 --> 08:41.600]  a vaccine, but oh, you got to wait 18 months.
[08:41.600 --> 08:44.800]  Oh, oh, they're going to hurry it up and have it next year.
[08:44.800 --> 08:46.120]  This is bad.
[08:46.120 --> 08:48.440]  And it pisses me off.
[08:48.440 --> 08:49.680]  And that's where I stand on this.
[08:49.680 --> 08:51.160]  Mike Adams, what do you think?
[08:51.160 --> 08:52.380]  I agree with you now.
[08:52.380 --> 08:54.160]  My assessment has changed in the last week.
[08:54.160 --> 08:57.280]  I believe this was also a deliberate release.
[08:57.280 --> 08:58.520]  So that's interesting.
[08:58.520 --> 09:00.240]  Just said that.
[09:00.240 --> 09:04.880]  I believe that it was introduced possibly by an agent working in that virology lab in
[09:04.880 --> 09:05.880]  Wuhan, but it was.
[09:05.880 --> 09:06.880]  Oh, yeah.
[09:06.880 --> 09:07.880]  I forgot.
[09:07.880 --> 09:09.520]  Now the scientists reportedly stole it from Canada.
[09:09.520 --> 09:10.520]  It's dead.
[09:10.520 --> 09:11.520]  Yeah.
[09:11.520 --> 09:12.960]  And a bunch of other people are getting killed.
[09:12.960 --> 09:13.960]  I'm sorry.
[09:13.960 --> 09:14.960]  There's just so many angles here.
[09:14.960 --> 09:15.960]  No, exactly.
[09:15.960 --> 09:19.720]  Well, look, this achieves all of the top goals of the globalist.
[09:19.720 --> 09:20.720]  Think about this.
[09:20.720 --> 09:22.560]  I don't think anybody's put all these pieces together.
[09:22.560 --> 09:27.160]  Not just the population, but every government in the world is about to go broke from debt
[09:27.160 --> 09:28.160]  spending.
[09:28.160 --> 09:29.680]  They need a scapegoat.
[09:29.680 --> 09:33.840]  There would be great to blame a virus for the economic collapse that's about to happen
[09:33.840 --> 09:37.440]  everywhere because of the global debt pyramid that Max Kaiser was just talking about an
[09:37.440 --> 09:40.000]  hour ago, by the way, and he's correct on all that.
[09:40.000 --> 09:41.480]  Also think about this.
[09:41.480 --> 09:45.960]  What's driving governments broke entitlement programs to retired people who no longer pay
[09:45.960 --> 09:51.120]  taxes but have huge costs to the governments in terms of Medicare and social security pensions.
[09:51.120 --> 09:55.600]  If they could come up with a way to kill off mostly elderly people, wow, that would sure
[09:55.600 --> 10:00.800]  save governments of the world, including America, Canada, the UK, China, everywhere, billions.
[10:00.800 --> 10:04.480]  I mean, hundreds of, maybe trillions of dollars over a few years.
[10:04.480 --> 10:06.640]  What an amazing coincidence that this is happening.
[10:06.640 --> 10:11.520]  And they get to roll out a medical, martial law police state, and they get to censor people
[10:11.520 --> 10:16.480]  who are anti-vaccine saying that you're responsible for causing all these deaths because you didn't
[10:16.480 --> 10:17.480]  promote the vaccine.
[10:17.480 --> 10:20.440]  I mean, think about all that this accomplishes.
[10:20.440 --> 10:23.880]  This is sort of a globalist dream come true.
[10:23.880 --> 10:27.440]  It hits on all these notes, and that's why I think this is no longer a coincidence.
[10:27.440 --> 10:29.240]  I don't think it's an accident anymore.
[10:29.240 --> 10:33.320]  I think it was engineered, and it's made to look like an accident.
[10:33.320 --> 10:35.080]  Now that was last night.
[10:35.080 --> 10:41.800]  Today, the White House made statements, barons put out reports.
[10:41.800 --> 10:48.160]  Other scientific institutions came out and said, yes, ladies and gentlemen, this virus
[10:48.160 --> 10:49.160]  is mutating.
[10:49.160 --> 10:50.440]  It's getting worse.
[10:50.440 --> 10:55.560]  You catch it once, and then you catch it again, it will cause massive heart attacks.
[10:55.560 --> 10:59.240]  It will cause people just to collapse in the street, as we've been saying.
[10:59.240 --> 11:04.200]  There's an excellent zero hedge article posted on infowars.com that everybody should go read.
[11:04.200 --> 11:08.360]  China's coronavirus numbers don't add up, and the White House doesn't believe them.
[11:08.360 --> 11:13.760]  And then it walks through the numbers of what China previously claimed two months ago and
[11:13.760 --> 11:19.920]  a month ago, and how clearly they were lying about it, and how clearly it is much worse.
[11:19.920 --> 11:25.760]  And Barons notes that China's coronavirus numbers are too perfect to mean much when
[11:25.760 --> 11:30.440]  you then look at the current models that they are putting out.
[11:30.440 --> 11:36.600]  But that really doesn't surprise anybody that the Communist Chinese are very, very famous
[11:36.600 --> 11:42.160]  for putting out the most ridiculous BS the planet has ever seen.
[11:42.160 --> 11:46.400]  Again, I covered this in the first segment, but you should go watch the whole nine-minute
[11:46.400 --> 11:47.400]  interview.
[11:47.400 --> 11:48.400]  It's on infowars.com.
[11:48.400 --> 11:54.120]  I called Joseph Watson an article, Senator Cotton, China refusing to hand over evidence
[11:54.120 --> 12:02.400]  about Wuhan Biolab that was just a few hundred yards away from the supposed food market where
[12:02.400 --> 12:03.400]  this broke out.
[12:03.400 --> 12:10.000]  But there's been no evidence that it did break out in this food market.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  Clearly we've never seen a response by governments around the world like this.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.640]  Clearly the virus is extremely communicable, spreads very, very easily, and now we're seeing
[12:19.640 --> 12:25.680]  deaths in Europe, deaths in Africa, deaths in other areas.
[12:25.680 --> 12:30.440]  Any way you slice it, this virus is a big deal because it is being used as a police
[12:30.440 --> 12:34.160]  state communist crackdown in China.
[12:34.160 --> 12:39.200]  It's being used to basically give China cover to invade and take over Taiwan, who's been
[12:39.200 --> 12:45.520]  running their dispute with the communist Chinese, and most importantly, it gives cover, as Mike
[12:45.520 --> 12:51.200]  Adams and I were just talking about earlier from last night's show, to the fact that there's
[12:51.200 --> 13:00.040]  a global Ponzi scheme of fiat currency and that the globalists see the solution to stopping
[13:00.040 --> 13:06.640]  that Ponzi scheme collapsing is to have a giant war or a giant bioweapons release that they
[13:06.640 --> 13:11.960]  can claim is natural or say that it's terrorist released that will kill hundreds of millions
[13:11.960 --> 13:17.080]  if not billions of people and then be a reset for the collapsing economy so governments
[13:17.080 --> 13:24.840]  don't get blamed and governments can use the smoke screen of the crisis to expand their
[13:24.840 --> 13:27.600]  control and legitimize their control.
[13:27.600 --> 13:31.480]  So this is a major authoritarian move.
[13:31.480 --> 13:38.560]  This is the globalist answer to the global awakening of the nation states to their plan.
[13:38.560 --> 13:42.360]  And it's clear that this has been cooked up by the UN and Bill and Melinda Gates who've
[13:42.360 --> 13:44.320]  patented the virus and many others.
[13:44.320 --> 13:49.960]  That's who benefits, that's who has the history of doing this and that's whose fingerprints
[13:49.960 --> 13:51.760]  are all over it yet again.
[13:51.760 --> 13:56.840]  I would encourage listeners to understand that they'll also use this pandemic as it
[13:56.840 --> 14:02.440]  expands they say for several years to crack down an independent press and that you see
[14:02.440 --> 14:07.000]  the communist Chinese cracking down on press and our own media praising that here because
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.120]  they want to be able to shut down their competition as well and only have one voice and that's
[14:11.120 --> 14:13.840]  why in full wars staying on the air is so critical.
[14:13.840 --> 14:20.560]  So I have a symbiotic suggestion to all of you to get products you need that make your
[14:20.560 --> 14:26.120]  life better and that make you safer and that fund the voice of freedom and other voices
[14:26.120 --> 14:28.480]  of freedom that we have on this broadcast.
[14:28.480 --> 14:32.240]  So we did sell out of the 16 ounce immune gargle with the patented nano silver that's
[14:32.240 --> 14:38.040]  documented to take out the SARS virus and the family of Corona.
[14:38.040 --> 14:43.760]  We still have the three ounce and we still have the one ounce at infowarstore.com and
[14:43.760 --> 14:47.040]  again your purchase funds this operation.
[14:47.040 --> 14:51.160]  We also have the high quality storeable food but I have to tell you they've extended it
[14:51.160 --> 14:53.240]  out to 10 to 14 days for delivery.
[14:53.240 --> 14:56.840]  They have the food but they have to package it and then get it to you and the orders aren't
[14:56.840 --> 14:57.840]  going down.
[14:57.840 --> 15:01.560]  They're going up so that time may increase soon like it already has.
[15:01.560 --> 15:06.720]  I suggest you go to infowarstore.com and lock in your order for four weeks three months
[15:06.720 --> 15:07.720]  six months a year.
[15:07.720 --> 15:10.320]  They have wide ranges of high quality food.
[15:10.320 --> 15:11.840]  They have specialty diets.
[15:11.840 --> 15:19.600]  The packaging is amazing sealed inside bags inside the plastic tote containers that are
[15:19.600 --> 15:24.640]  sealed that you have to actually physically break a major seal on and that also funds
[15:24.640 --> 15:30.120]  our operation while you get storeable food that lasts 25 years or more and is very nutritious
[15:30.120 --> 15:34.600]  and good for your family a 360 win but you need to take action now because the globalist
[15:34.600 --> 15:39.560]  are losing but they're going to try to trigger economic collapse, race riots and obviously
[15:39.560 --> 15:41.720]  use plagues for control.
[15:41.720 --> 15:47.120]  So get your storeable food now while you still can at infowarstore.com and other great products
[15:47.120 --> 15:54.000]  like the nano silver toothpaste and the immune gargle at infowarstore.com will be right back.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.520]  Please stay with us.
[15:57.520 --> 16:01.200]  I'm here with Scott Youseam founder of OMG Tax.
[16:01.200 --> 16:05.920]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[16:05.920 --> 16:11.320]  My team of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax experts remove wage garnish fans sometimes
[16:11.320 --> 16:12.320]  in the same day.
[16:12.320 --> 16:15.880]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what
[16:15.880 --> 16:17.880]  is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:17.880 --> 16:20.160]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:20.160 --> 16:21.720]  Oh, can I ever?
[16:21.720 --> 16:26.960]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[16:26.960 --> 16:27.960]  Guess what?
[16:27.960 --> 16:32.640]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[16:32.640 --> 16:37.760]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot
[16:37.760 --> 16:43.280]  less call OMG Tax right now for a free tax saving consultation.
[16:43.280 --> 16:57.240]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112-800-486-8112 that's 800-486-8112.
[16:57.240 --> 17:02.360]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[17:02.360 --> 17:06.600]  backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[17:06.600 --> 17:08.400]  important message you'll ever hear.
[17:08.400 --> 17:09.400]  Bill Hyde here.
[17:09.400 --> 17:14.120]  We tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's
[17:14.120 --> 17:17.720]  going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[17:17.720 --> 17:21.800]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East
[17:21.800 --> 17:23.280]  Bank of the Mississippi.
[17:23.280 --> 17:27.120]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[17:27.120 --> 17:30.880]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[17:30.880 --> 17:35.240]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:35.240 --> 17:36.600]  So here's what you should do right now.
[17:36.600 --> 17:40.880]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:40.880 --> 17:46.840]  That's myownpowergrid.com, over $1,000 in great off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses
[17:46.840 --> 17:47.840]  too.
[17:47.840 --> 17:48.840]  And the best part?
[17:48.840 --> 17:51.440]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[17:51.440 --> 17:54.200]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[17:54.200 --> 17:56.200]  That's myownpowergrid.com.

[18:20.520 --> 18:25.400]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus, I've
[18:25.400 --> 18:28.320]  lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.

[18:29.320 --> 18:30.960]  So do yourself a favor.
[18:30.960 --> 18:33.360]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[18:33.360 --> 18:37.440]  You can't lose except if you don't take action because when you buy the products, you're
[18:37.440 --> 18:42.640]  funding the operation that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace and
[18:42.640 --> 18:43.640]  our action.
[18:43.640 --> 18:45.200]  But you need these products.
[18:45.200 --> 18:48.160]  That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing.
[18:48.160 --> 18:52.280]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[18:52.280 --> 18:56.920]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding, we're fighting to win
[18:56.920 --> 18:57.920]  and we are winning.
[18:57.920 --> 18:58.920]  Thanks to you.
[18:58.920 --> 19:06.680]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins, there are many reasons why we need to think
[19:06.680 --> 19:09.280]  about what is really in the air around us.
[19:09.280 --> 19:13.720]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.

[19:19.160 --> 19:22.240]  the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.

[19:30.040 --> 19:34.520]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars, but the Alexa pure breeze

[20:29.160 --> 20:33.160]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[20:33.160 --> 20:43.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have a bunch of news that I'm going to get through in the next
[20:43.240 --> 20:50.720]  hour of this transmission.
[20:50.720 --> 20:59.680]  And then we're going to have great guests on, including Jeff Nyquist, who is a expert
[20:59.680 --> 21:07.600]  on the coronavirus, to give us some updates on that and to break down some of the most
[21:07.600 --> 21:08.600]  recent news.
[21:08.600 --> 21:15.560]  But as I've got all these different stacks of news, we're going to cover political news,
[21:15.560 --> 21:20.920]  updates on the Democrat race, updates on the deep state being investigated or getting away
[21:20.920 --> 21:25.720]  with the crimes, update on what President Trump is up to and what he was up to over
[21:25.720 --> 21:31.520]  the weekend, cultural news, what the left is doing to society, the Me Too movement
[21:31.520 --> 21:36.520]  in an epic fail, ignoring the Harvey Weinstein case now that it's no longer politically
[21:36.520 --> 21:40.240]  advantageous for them.
[21:40.240 --> 21:44.760]  And then this other set of news over here, which is what the left and the Democrats are
[21:44.760 --> 21:53.640]  getting away with destroying our cities, destroying our democracy, destroying our justice system.
[21:53.640 --> 22:02.040]  But I was thinking about this as kind of an intro to getting into all of this news here.
[22:02.040 --> 22:13.440]  You see, President Trump needs to give a major victory to his supporters, a real victory.
[22:13.440 --> 22:14.600]  Now what am I talking about?
[22:14.600 --> 22:17.960]  You're sitting at home or in your car at work and you're saying, well, what are you talking
[22:17.960 --> 22:18.960]  about?
[22:18.960 --> 22:24.320]  Oh, and Trump's already given us a ton of major victories, sure, in the game of kicking
[22:24.320 --> 22:31.920]  political footballs back and forth, because we can still sit here and debate the economy
[22:31.920 --> 22:36.520]  and the Democrats and the left are still going to say, oh, this is Obama's economy, regardless
[22:36.520 --> 22:38.440]  of whatever the facts are.
[22:38.440 --> 22:39.440]  That doesn't matter.
[22:39.440 --> 22:44.840]  It's not a total victory because they're still going to make their claims.
[22:44.840 --> 22:49.120]  Same thing goes with all the investigations of Trump and the indictments and everything
[22:49.120 --> 22:53.560]  and the arrests of all the Trump associates, and then McCabe gets away and all these other
[22:53.560 --> 22:58.040]  people get away and still nothing really of the Obama administration.
[22:58.040 --> 23:03.640]  Now, again, we'll have to be patient and see what happens.
[23:03.640 --> 23:07.880]  But if Trump is in office for four and or eight years and there's no arrest made from
[23:07.880 --> 23:13.440]  the, at least the spying scandal under the Obama administration, but it should go well
[23:13.440 --> 23:19.040]  beyond that into the Clinton State Department and beyond, quite frankly, their involvement
[23:19.040 --> 23:24.800]  with the Epstein sex trafficking.
[23:24.800 --> 23:29.200]  But here's why it's so important for President Trump to really deliver a total victory to
[23:29.200 --> 23:38.760]  America and why we're kind of in the balance right now, quite frankly, with Attorney General
[23:38.760 --> 23:39.760]  Barr.
[23:39.760 --> 23:44.000]  Some things I see and hear from him have me extremely discouraged.
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.360]  Other things I see and hear from him have me encouraged.
[23:49.360 --> 23:55.400]  But this is what it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:55.400 --> 24:01.140]  As far as the economy or all these other things are concerned, that will all come down to
[24:01.140 --> 24:05.120]  Election Day when Americans vote.
[24:05.120 --> 24:09.760]  Because you've got Barack Obama, who's kept his mouth pretty much shut, by the way, during
[24:09.760 --> 24:21.080]  all of this, saying how, thanks to him, 11 years ago, the economy is booming.
[24:21.080 --> 24:26.160]  And you have every single one of the minions of the Democrat Party out there believing
[24:26.160 --> 24:29.800]  it.
[24:29.800 --> 24:32.240]  And so what am I saying?
[24:32.240 --> 24:34.500]  What is the victory Trump needs to deliver?
[24:34.500 --> 24:39.480]  What is the victory that will be a true victory where there can be no debate, there can be
[24:39.480 --> 24:44.400]  no commentary, it's just victory.
[24:44.400 --> 24:47.960]  Some people cry in the defeat, other people rejoice in the win.
[24:47.960 --> 24:49.080]  What is that?
[24:49.080 --> 24:54.760]  It is the indictment of the Obama administration officials, Brennan, Clapper, Comey, and yes,
[24:54.760 --> 24:58.560]  Barack Obama himself.
[24:58.560 --> 25:06.600]  The biggest, most sure victory that President Trump can give America and his supporters
[25:06.600 --> 25:11.680]  is a true investigation into the Obama administration.
[25:11.680 --> 25:15.480]  Start wherever you'd like, finish wherever you like.
[25:15.480 --> 25:23.560]  Give the Obama administration or more specifically Barack Obama the same treatment that you have
[25:23.560 --> 25:32.400]  endured as President Mr. Donald J. Trump.
[25:32.400 --> 25:42.400]  And only then, only then can America really say they've had a true victory.
[25:42.400 --> 25:48.840]  Only when there's true justice and all the corrupt criminals that we know, we know them
[25:48.840 --> 25:54.480]  by name are finally indicted, investigated, and you know what, maybe some of them end
[25:54.480 --> 26:03.880]  up in jail for the rest of their life.
[26:03.880 --> 26:04.880]  That's victory.
[26:04.880 --> 26:05.880]  That's total victory.
[26:05.880 --> 26:08.360]  That's complete victory.
[26:08.360 --> 26:13.200]  And it will ensure, because it's real corruption.
[26:13.200 --> 26:16.240]  I mean, all this stuff against Trump is obviously fake.
[26:16.240 --> 26:20.280]  The real stuff went on in the Obama years, but even beyond that.
[26:20.280 --> 26:26.120]  But it's fresh enough, and Obama is still as much of a media darling with them, you
[26:26.120 --> 26:32.160]  know, propping him up that when or if the truth came out about everything that went
[26:32.160 --> 26:40.280]  on for Spygate, for the Iran deal in Ukraine and the Crimea with Obama's involvement.
[26:40.280 --> 26:41.280]  That's total victory.
[26:41.280 --> 26:45.520]  And all the left can do at that point is just cry.
[26:45.520 --> 26:49.960]  Or they can open their eyes and see the reality.
[26:49.960 --> 26:54.960]  But you see, economies will come and go.
[26:54.960 --> 26:56.720]  Policies will come and go.
[26:56.720 --> 26:59.240]  Approach on the big issues will come and go.
[26:59.240 --> 27:09.960]  But what will stay forever is a real investigation, a real indictment and arrests.
[27:09.960 --> 27:18.080]  And quite frankly, that's the only way I think you can assure that after President Trump,
[27:18.080 --> 27:22.960]  you'll have another, call it whatever you want, conservative, populist, whatever, you'll
[27:22.960 --> 27:32.560]  have another person who's true to their own cause and the cause that the people elected
[27:32.560 --> 27:35.040]  them to have.
[27:35.040 --> 27:37.240]  Trump's not perfect, but he's trying to be president.
[27:37.240 --> 27:44.840]  He's not being controlled, and he's not being controlling.
[27:44.840 --> 27:48.600]  And so that 110% needs to happen.
[27:48.600 --> 27:49.960]  No questions about it.
[27:49.960 --> 27:54.560]  It has to be done.
[27:54.560 --> 27:59.200]  Now I'm going to get into the nuts and bolts of all of that when we come back on the other
[27:59.200 --> 28:03.840]  side of this break.
[28:03.840 --> 28:14.120]  But I will say this, the only silver lining in McCabe walking and the rest of these creeps
[28:14.120 --> 28:22.960]  walking like stroke and page and them cheersing about it is that they're the underlings that
[28:22.960 --> 28:29.240]  are just being used like nodes in a network to see the higher ups, to see the bigger picture
[28:29.240 --> 28:36.080]  and to go after, as they say, the big fish, the Brennins, the Clappers, the Comys, the
[28:36.080 --> 28:45.920]  Obamas, and I think all of America, because here's the thing, there is still a large group
[28:45.920 --> 28:51.480]  of people that just throw Trump in with the corrupt DC establishment corrupt DC politics.
[28:51.480 --> 28:55.880]  Trump actually locks these people up and says, hey, I'm not part of it.
[28:55.880 --> 28:58.080]  Millions of people will come out and vote.
[28:58.080 --> 29:03.080]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[29:03.080 --> 29:06.760]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[29:06.760 --> 29:11.760]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[29:11.760 --> 29:15.280]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:15.280 --> 29:19.800]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[29:19.800 --> 29:20.800]  across America.
[29:20.800 --> 29:24.800]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[29:24.800 --> 29:28.360]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[29:28.360 --> 29:29.360]  healthier I feel.
[29:29.360 --> 29:32.040]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:32.040 --> 29:37.200]  We over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[29:37.200 --> 29:39.680]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[29:58.980 --> 30:01.720]  There can no longer be any doubt.
[30:01.720 --> 30:05.680]  This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels.
[30:05.680 --> 30:11.080]  It's very communicable, it spreads very, very fast, it is killing a lot of people and the
[30:11.080 --> 30:15.600]  Chinese Communist government has covered up just how bad it is and the Lighthouse is now
[30:15.600 --> 30:21.480]  openly challenging them, show our Trump's top scientist and so is Senator Cotton.
[30:21.480 --> 30:25.320]  My friends, now is the time to get prepared.
[30:25.320 --> 30:28.480]  2020 is not a year to play games with.
[30:28.480 --> 30:32.240]  The globalists are trying to create economic collapse, race riots.
[30:32.240 --> 30:35.240]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[30:35.240 --> 30:41.720]  That's why listeners to InfoWars need to be prepared and InfoWarsStore.com has the products
[30:41.720 --> 30:44.960]  that make your life better and make you healthier.
[30:44.960 --> 30:48.320]  We have the last of the immune gargle selling out as we speak.

[30:52.680 --> 30:59.760]  in stock along with Ultra 12 at InfoWarsStore.com.
[30:59.760 --> 31:00.760]  Real stuff, man.
[31:00.760 --> 31:03.480]  We're talking about the real deal here and I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell
[31:03.480 --> 31:07.320]  you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over and everybody
[31:07.320 --> 31:11.760]  I mean, I've got a problem and we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[31:11.760 --> 31:15.000]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[31:15.000 --> 31:20.800]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach
[31:20.800 --> 31:26.000]  the Democrats, save the 2nd Amendment, defend the 1st Amendment, InfoWars.com and it looks
[31:26.000 --> 31:27.000]  like duct tape.
[31:27.000 --> 31:28.000]  It's just a regular sticker.
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.680]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over without
[31:31.680 --> 31:32.680]  even disrupting things.
[31:32.680 --> 31:34.240]  People say, why are you doing this?
[31:34.240 --> 31:35.240]  What's happening?
[31:35.240 --> 31:37.240]  When you go, well, we're being censored.
[31:37.240 --> 31:38.240]  Trump won't do anything about it.
[31:38.240 --> 31:41.200]  And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think because I've not launched this
[31:41.200 --> 31:42.200]  yet.
[31:42.200 --> 31:43.200]  It's brilliant.
[31:43.200 --> 31:48.280]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made
[31:48.280 --> 31:49.720]  it into a weapon.
[31:49.720 --> 31:52.680]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[31:52.680 --> 31:58.440]  And you know what's most disturbing to people, silence.
[31:58.440 --> 32:05.080]  At the end of World War II, Adolf Hitler had discredited the eugenics and world population
[32:05.080 --> 32:06.880]  control organizations.
[32:06.880 --> 32:12.400]  They openly had meetings and led by Julian Huxley, Aldous Huxley's brother, decided to
[32:12.400 --> 32:20.240]  repackage themselves as transhumanists now in the year 2020 to set the precedent that
[32:20.240 --> 32:25.760]  people can be turned into cyborgs, that robots can be given rights, you name it.
[32:25.760 --> 32:32.760]  They are intimidating and arresting people all over the world who simply misgender someone.
[32:32.760 --> 32:39.160]  So the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is if you can't even tell what
[32:39.160 --> 32:40.400]  they are.
[32:40.400 --> 32:46.200]  This is the ultimate Kafkaesque mind control and there's several big articles up on infowars.com
[32:46.200 --> 32:47.560]  that break this down.
[32:47.560 --> 32:53.280]  UK Teen Fine under house arrest for asking trans police officers, gender, UK mother,
[32:53.280 --> 33:20.280]  spare jail for misgenerating trans woman, order to pay 1,000 pound fine.
[33:23.280 --> 33:33.480]  Alright let me get into the nuts and bolts of what I was talking about in the last segment.
[33:33.480 --> 33:40.420]  Now last week there were some major developments in the war against the deep state in the mission
[33:40.420 --> 33:44.400]  to drain the swamp.
[33:44.400 --> 33:51.920]  Obviously you had McCabe walking, you had Trump intervening at least with his bully
[33:51.920 --> 33:59.440]  pulpit in the Roger Stone case, you had Bill Barr give an interview to ABC in which he
[33:59.440 --> 34:09.240]  criticized the Trump tweets, but you also had the DOJ say they're going to be investigating
[34:09.240 --> 34:22.960]  the process or the interview if you will of General Mike Flynn where the FBI eventually
[34:22.960 --> 34:30.560]  charged him with lying during that investigation even though they said he didn't lie.
[34:30.560 --> 34:36.680]  But let's just stop it right there and now pick it up where we're at today.
[34:36.680 --> 34:43.520]  Well, FBI set up briefing with Trump, Flynn and documented their thoughts for crossfire
[34:43.520 --> 34:46.480]  hurricane operation.
[34:46.480 --> 34:52.840]  So basically you have all kinds of espionage going on during the Trump campaign and then
[34:52.840 --> 34:59.720]  in the Trump presidency probably still ongoing, honestly, I mean Brendan and all these guys
[34:59.720 --> 35:03.360]  still have their clearance, Ciara Mala still has his clearance, I mean folks they're still
[35:03.360 --> 35:13.480]  spying on everything the president does and think about that they can't get anything still.
[35:13.480 --> 35:20.200]  But think about all the different layers of espionage that they had running against Donald
[35:20.200 --> 35:26.760]  Trump and then President Trump, they had the spy gate tapping as everything is phone activity,
[35:26.760 --> 35:31.720]  internet activity, all that was being tapped and tracked and documented.
[35:31.720 --> 35:37.920]  Then you had them sending in FBI agents suggesting sending them an undercover with a wire.
[35:37.920 --> 35:44.160]  You have them saying we're going to form a emergency plan, we're going to do everything
[35:44.160 --> 35:50.120]  to stop Trump from inside these bureaucracies.
[35:50.120 --> 35:55.480]  Setting up Papadopoulos, setting up stones, setting up Flynn, putting Manafort's head
[35:55.480 --> 36:00.760]  on a pike.
[36:00.760 --> 36:09.360]  Then they're just doing briefings where they're posing as, let's say Americans, that's basically
[36:09.360 --> 36:18.360]  what it is, it's the Democrats or Obama operatives posing as Americans going into Trump meetings
[36:18.360 --> 36:22.720]  to have a real discussion on policy so that they can document that, take that back to
[36:22.720 --> 36:29.320]  their people and then figure out what they want to do in crossfire hurricane which was
[36:29.320 --> 36:36.040]  their spy scandal, sending people in undercover with wires, tapping all the presidents or
[36:36.040 --> 36:39.560]  Donald Trump's activity on his phone and on the internet.
[36:39.560 --> 36:50.280]  So we're talking about every layer of espionage possible other than them having like Trump's
[36:50.280 --> 36:58.720]  nanny or something spying on them, who knows, maybe they had that, I bet they tried it.
[36:58.720 --> 37:01.920]  So it's all coming out, it's all documented.
[37:01.920 --> 37:11.000]  And this is why Trump must, and okay, now we get into the gray area because we say Trump
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.720]  must do this, Trump must do this, Trump must do this, well really it falls under, well
[37:15.720 --> 37:23.800]  it's all under Trump's purview but it falls under action at least diplomatically with
[37:23.800 --> 37:26.120]  Attorney General Barr.
[37:26.120 --> 37:31.320]  And of course what did Barr say last week, criticizing the president for his tweets.
[37:31.320 --> 37:35.840]  Now I've heard a couple different accounts of this, some people say it's Barr throwing
[37:35.840 --> 37:40.040]  Trump under the bus, other people say it's Barr saying, hey, when you tweet the media
[37:40.040 --> 37:43.040]  spins things, it makes it harder for me to do my job.
[37:43.040 --> 37:48.800]  But even if that's the case, so what, yeah the media is corrupt, what do you think, yeah
[37:48.800 --> 37:52.000]  the left is out of control.
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.680]  So Trump has to silence himself because you have a bunch of piranha-like media out there,
[37:57.680 --> 38:03.240]  let me ask you a question, would you jump into a pool of piranhas that were bloodthirsty
[38:03.240 --> 38:10.440]  and starving, of course not, well that's essentially the Democrats right now, that's
[38:10.440 --> 38:17.960]  their media, starving piranhas, running around nipping at Trump's heels, nipping at anyone
[38:17.960 --> 38:31.080]  within one, two, three degrees of separation from Trump, starving, piranha-like, crazed.
[38:31.080 --> 38:38.720]  And now here's the problem, Barr criticizes Trump's tweets and then oh, the Republicans
[38:38.720 --> 38:43.040]  jump on board like Mitch McConnell.
[38:43.040 --> 38:47.080]  And let's go with the angle that oh they just don't like the media response to these tweets,
[38:47.080 --> 38:50.720]  they don't like the media distraction, they don't like the, oh it's a media media, quit
[38:50.720 --> 38:57.720]  being afraid of the media, that's a losing attitude.
[38:57.720 --> 39:02.240]  The day you care about what the media says about you is the day you lose for the rest
[39:02.240 --> 39:04.600]  of your life.
[39:04.600 --> 39:13.400]  And that's how these people treat it because that's the power they've had invested in them.
[39:13.400 --> 39:15.360]  That's been what they've been able to do for so long.
[39:15.360 --> 39:21.200]  So Trump not responding to them, Trump not bowing down to them, is why Trump became
[39:21.200 --> 39:24.200]  president and is kicking their ass every day.
[39:24.200 --> 39:30.800]  Oh but Barr lays down oh Trump's tweets, yeah Trump's tweets are the problem, him tweeting
[39:30.800 --> 39:36.600]  out the truth, not the media that lies all day long, not the corrupt stone case with
[39:36.600 --> 39:40.800]  the corrupt judge and the corrupt jury and the corrupt prosecution, no not that, no
[39:40.800 --> 39:46.240]  we don't hear Barr bitching about that instead it's Trump's tweets, which has me a little
[39:46.240 --> 39:51.800]  discouraged.
[39:51.800 --> 40:01.400]  And now try to analyze this, Barr's internal reviews and reinvestigations feed resentment,
[40:01.400 --> 40:07.480]  suspicion inside the Justice Department, fearful of Trump's attacks, Justice Department lawyers
[40:07.480 --> 40:13.400]  worry Barr will leave them exposed, exposed?
[40:13.400 --> 40:17.880]  Well I would find all of them right now and say exposed for what?
[40:17.880 --> 40:20.320]  What have you done?
[40:20.320 --> 40:27.800]  More than 1100 ex-Justice Department officials call for Barr's resignation.
[40:27.800 --> 40:32.320]  Now this is obviously all contrived.
[40:32.320 --> 40:40.000]  The question is who's involved, is Barr involved?
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.840]  Or are they really afraid of Barr?
[40:42.840 --> 40:47.240]  They're really afraid of Trump, we know that, but are they really afraid of Barr?
[40:47.240 --> 40:50.040]  I don't know.
[40:50.040 --> 40:55.080]  Quite frankly at this point I'd say I'm almost split but I'd say 51 percent of me doesn't
[40:55.080 --> 40:59.760]  trust Barr.
[40:59.760 --> 41:04.400]  And that might even go up right now, might have just gone up to 52 or 54 or 55 because
[41:04.400 --> 41:08.520]  if he's going to complain about Trump tweeting but not complain about all the corruption,
[41:08.520 --> 41:15.000]  let me explain something, when the Department of Justice, when the Attorney General is more
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.880]  concerned over President Trump's tweets than all the corruption that's going on, something
[41:19.880 --> 41:25.240]  stinks in D.C. ladies and gentlemen.
[41:25.240 --> 41:29.640]  So do you trust Barr to do the right thing?
[41:29.640 --> 41:37.160]  Are all these Justice Department officials calling for his resignation just to try to
[41:37.160 --> 41:42.160]  fluff Barr up like he's a true enemy of the deep state?
[41:42.160 --> 41:43.800]  Or are they really afraid of Barr?
[41:43.800 --> 41:52.160]  And what is it they're afraid of being exposed for?
[41:52.160 --> 42:01.720]  Over a thousand Justice Department officials want Barr to resign over his handling of the
[42:01.720 --> 42:05.520]  Roger Stone case, excuse me?
[42:05.520 --> 42:10.160]  And then they're afraid that they're going to be exposed?
[42:10.160 --> 42:11.560]  So what does that tell you?
[42:11.560 --> 42:16.960]  I mean, you know how hard it is to run a rat trap when you're part of any organization?
[42:16.960 --> 42:22.320]  You know how hard it is because you don't know who to trust.
[42:22.320 --> 42:26.960]  You know how hard it is to smoke out a rat, ladies and gentlemen?
[42:26.960 --> 42:34.320]  When there's rats everywhere and they've learned how to operate in the darkness, it's tough.
[42:34.320 --> 42:40.680]  So either this is the easiest smoke out ever in the history of the Justice Department or
[42:40.680 --> 42:44.760]  something else is afoot and they're trying to act like Bill Barr's really a threat to
[42:44.760 --> 42:45.760]  the deep state.
[42:45.760 --> 42:52.160]  And I don't know, either way, I'd immediately start investigating these officials calling
[42:52.160 --> 42:55.160]  for Trump's resignation or excuse me for Barr's resignation.
[42:55.160 --> 42:57.800]  Find out who they are.

[47:26.040 --> 47:30.720]  And welcome back ladies and gentlemen to this live Monday Transmission, Owen Schreuer will
[47:30.720 --> 47:35.720]  be back in the second and third hour hosting live and then of course it will be Gerald
[47:35.720 --> 47:36.720]  Salente.
[47:36.720 --> 47:41.080]  I am working on some big projects that will be announcing very, very soon so that's why
[47:41.080 --> 47:43.640]  I'm only hosting part of the transmission today.
[47:43.640 --> 47:45.840]  Okay, two things I want to hit real fast.
[47:45.840 --> 47:47.560]  Look at this, your TV viewer.
[47:47.560 --> 47:52.360]  Peter Schiff, Alex Jones has capitulated after 10 years of watching the hashtag Bitcoin
[47:52.360 --> 47:57.800]  bubble inflate to 10,000 per coin, he thinks now the time to urge his listeners to buy.
[47:57.800 --> 48:04.720]  This is how many is and greedy greed overwhelms reason as people wants to sensible to buy
[48:04.720 --> 48:07.240]  join the party just as it's ending.
[48:07.240 --> 48:13.560]  Okay, I don't own any Bitcoin and I'm not joining the party out of greed.
[48:13.560 --> 48:18.960]  I had Max Kaiser in here and I agree with the technology and independent currencies
[48:18.960 --> 48:24.400]  so that people have freedom outside of the big globalist banks that are literally teetering
[48:24.400 --> 48:29.320]  on the verge of collapse and are trying to pump up liquidity everywhere and it's extremely
[48:29.320 --> 48:31.560]  dangerous, but it's the world we live in.
[48:31.560 --> 48:35.520]  So I had him in here and now that big institutional investors are getting involved in it, we were
[48:35.520 --> 48:39.480]  looking at the ones that we think will survive and will end up being successful.
[48:39.480 --> 48:44.320]  That's all I said is that 10 years later, I may start testing it out and getting into
[48:44.320 --> 48:48.840]  a few things because I want to be independent from the system.
[48:48.840 --> 48:53.120]  That's all and it's just incredible that people try to spin that in another direction
[48:53.120 --> 48:57.720]  when I've been nothing but nice to Mr. Schiff who's heavily invested in communist China.
[48:57.720 --> 49:00.920]  I'll invite him on with Kaiser for a debate.
[49:00.920 --> 49:01.920]  We're all adults.
[49:01.920 --> 49:02.920]  We can have a discussion.
[49:02.920 --> 49:07.680]  Now, separately, we're going to play an interview with Max Kaiser that we take last night.
[49:07.680 --> 49:11.440]  We're going to premiere it here coming up in T minus 50 seconds separately.
[49:11.440 --> 49:17.680]  What do I believe in things like the immune gargle that's got the nano silver certified
[49:17.680 --> 49:19.540]  to take out these deadly viruses?
[49:19.540 --> 49:21.480]  We still have it in three ounce and one ounce.
[49:21.480 --> 49:25.760]  Get yours before it sells out and back in stock, vitamin mineral fusion, super high-quality
[49:25.760 --> 49:29.420]  fruit punch for adults, for children, amino acids, so much more.
[49:29.420 --> 49:32.160]  One of the best systems you're going to find out there to boost your immunity and ultra
[49:32.160 --> 49:33.160]  12.
[49:33.160 --> 49:34.840]  This has all been sold out.
[49:34.840 --> 49:40.280]  The vitamin mineral fusion is back in stock and so is ultra 12, the highest quality vitamin
[49:40.280 --> 49:45.000]  B12 you're going to find taken under the tongue to get maximum absorption, taste great, totally
[49:45.000 --> 49:51.120]  natural for you and your family, ultra 12 back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[49:51.120 --> 49:56.560]  That's what I invest in is the patented nano silver, super silver, patented toothpaste
[49:56.560 --> 49:58.440]  that's so incredibly popular.
[49:58.440 --> 50:01.560]  That's the precious metals I invest in, ladies and gentlemen.
[50:01.560 --> 50:03.080]  Just like I said, Trump would win.
[50:03.080 --> 50:06.240]  I invest in victory and truth and justice.
[50:06.240 --> 50:08.960]  Here is Max Kaiser.
[50:08.960 --> 50:13.880]  By the way, when you see his shows on RT, BBC, Al Jazeera, it's so professional.
[50:13.880 --> 50:14.880]  Totally.
[50:14.880 --> 50:17.120]  It comes on my show to misbehave.
[50:17.120 --> 50:18.600]  By the way, we were having a...
[50:18.600 --> 50:19.600]  It's weird.
[50:19.600 --> 50:20.600]  It's awesome.
[50:20.600 --> 50:21.600]  Keep it weird.
[50:21.600 --> 50:22.600]  Keep it weird, Austin.
[50:22.600 --> 50:23.600]  We were having...
[50:23.600 --> 50:24.600]  That's the brand from Austin.
[50:24.600 --> 50:30.120]  We were having a Nerf gun battle earlier, but you should let me have one.
[50:30.120 --> 50:31.120]  So I came back in here.
[50:31.120 --> 50:32.120]  I have two.
[50:32.120 --> 50:33.120]  You have none.
[50:33.120 --> 50:36.000]  That's how communist China works or an authoritarian state.
[50:36.000 --> 50:39.120]  I have the guns and you don't have anything.
[50:39.120 --> 50:43.320]  I have super silver toothpaste, which is as powerful as all your weaponry in fighting
[50:43.320 --> 50:46.560]  the battle against cavities, super silver toothpaste.
[50:46.560 --> 50:51.040]  It's made with something similar to silver and it looks really cool.
[50:51.040 --> 50:55.600]  And if you use it, a lot of women will stop you on the street and say, hi, I'd like to
[50:55.600 --> 50:56.880]  marry you.
[50:56.880 --> 51:00.040]  Super silver toothpaste is for winners.
[51:00.040 --> 51:04.720]  Max Kaiser is one of the smartest people I know, but when he comes on my show, he goes
[51:04.720 --> 51:07.360]  crazy and has a lot of fun, which is fine.
[51:07.360 --> 51:11.600]  We had some real moments of genius on the Sunday show.
[51:11.600 --> 51:16.080]  So I'm asking him before he leaves to just spend five, 10 minutes talking about the state
[51:16.080 --> 51:17.080]  of the world.
[51:17.080 --> 51:18.080]  Meem Warfare.
[51:18.080 --> 51:23.280]  Michael Bloomberg is Mary Poppins and what he sees coming in the future, the challenges
[51:23.280 --> 51:25.560]  Trump and the American people and others face.
[51:25.560 --> 51:27.760]  So just a good five, 10 minute rant.
[51:27.760 --> 51:29.960]  Lord Kaiser, it was great having you here with us.
[51:29.960 --> 51:30.960]  Right.
[51:30.960 --> 51:31.960]  So Meem Warfare.
[51:31.960 --> 51:32.960]  Yeah.
[51:32.960 --> 51:36.600]  I'll try to extemporaneously speak a little bit about this and how it relates to Mike
[51:36.600 --> 51:37.840]  Bloomberg.
[51:37.840 --> 51:42.480]  So Mike Bloomberg is putting out a lot of these crazy memes or images or ads and people
[51:42.480 --> 51:44.240]  are really wondering, what is this all about?
[51:44.240 --> 51:46.720]  He seems like he's trying to lose.
[51:46.720 --> 51:53.000]  But in fact, in Meem Warfare, it's very subtle because it attacks your subconscious and unconscious
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.280]  mind and it's very disruptive.
[51:55.280 --> 52:04.560]  And it's a way to get a lot of bang for the buck and to get your face out there in a very
[52:04.560 --> 52:06.360]  pervasive way.
[52:06.360 --> 52:12.920]  But if you go back to 2016, remember that Hillary Clinton, she was almost what took her
[52:12.920 --> 52:19.600]  under and what defeated her was that she couldn't really relate to the meme warfare, that it
[52:19.600 --> 52:21.200]  was just emerging at that time.
[52:21.200 --> 52:25.880]  If you recall Pepe the Frog, the meme that came out of, I believe, Fort Chan, which is
[52:25.880 --> 52:33.000]  kind of a collective of meme inventors and hackers and just really the bleeding edge
[52:33.000 --> 52:38.320]  of images and political images and memes and everything around that.
[52:38.320 --> 52:44.720]  And she fell for this trap that was set for her that Pepe the Frog was somehow reflective
[52:44.720 --> 52:47.040]  or representative of Nazism.
[52:47.040 --> 52:55.400]  And so she started to talk about this and the response was, wow, this woman is completely
[52:55.400 --> 52:56.400]  out of touch.
[52:56.400 --> 53:02.000]  It made her look just completely unhinged to have fallen for this.
[53:02.000 --> 53:07.400]  Here we are in 2020, and so Michael Bloomberg, who is a media savvy guy who's obviously extremely
[53:07.400 --> 53:13.000]  wealthy and has access to any resource he wants, if he sits down to a meeting to plan
[53:13.000 --> 53:18.040]  his campaign and somebody says, let's do meme warfare, and he'll say, what's that?
[53:18.040 --> 53:20.440]  And he'll explain exactly what it all means.
[53:20.440 --> 53:23.720]  He'll say, OK, here's $30 million ago, do some memes.
[53:23.720 --> 53:27.760]  So now we're seeing Michael Bloomberg dressed up as Mary Poppins floating above stage saying
[53:27.760 --> 53:28.760]  crazy things.
[53:28.760 --> 53:33.560]  But this is because it's an attack on people's subconscious and unconscious mind to get them
[53:33.560 --> 53:40.440]  completely unsettled, to rearrange what is familiar, and to kind of create a dynamic
[53:40.440 --> 53:46.520]  of, I guess you could compare it to Stockholm Syndrome, where in the Stockholm Syndrome scenario,
[53:46.520 --> 53:52.840]  the people who are being held hostage end up kind of forming an attachment to the person
[53:52.840 --> 53:54.400]  who's got them held hostage.
[53:54.400 --> 53:57.760]  They kind of fall in love with the warden and the prison.
[53:57.760 --> 54:01.480]  This is something that you see often, and this is something that Mike Bloomberg is attempting
[54:01.480 --> 54:09.520]  to do, take our subconscious mind and to take it to buy it, essentially to buy his way into
[54:09.520 --> 54:13.440]  our mind using these weaponized memes.
[54:13.440 --> 54:20.280]  So when you see Mike Bloomberg in a situation where it looks really disruptive and crazy
[54:20.280 --> 54:24.440]  and why is he doing this, understand that he is trying to attack your subconscious and
[54:24.440 --> 54:31.440]  unconscious mind to get you as unsettled as possible so that you feel helpless.
[54:31.440 --> 54:37.520]  And when you start to feel helpless, you look for a father figure, you look for someone
[54:37.520 --> 54:44.200]  who can restore order to your sense of helplessness, and oh, here's this friendly billionaire guy
[54:44.200 --> 54:48.200]  who's like, Mike, and Mike can get it done.
[54:48.200 --> 54:52.160]  And so you start to gravitate, especially people who are unprepared to defend themselves
[54:52.160 --> 54:53.160]  against this.
[54:53.160 --> 54:59.280]  You start to gravitate toward this heroic father figure who's going to save you from
[54:59.280 --> 55:04.080]  these weaponized, ugly memes that are playing havoc in your mind.
[55:04.080 --> 55:10.640]  So this is, I think, only going to get weirder because I think other candidates are going
[55:10.640 --> 55:13.000]  to start doing this as well.
[55:13.000 --> 55:21.400]  So as we head into 2020, you could see the political ad landscape look completely psychotic
[55:21.400 --> 55:32.760]  where it's like watching acid dropping billionaires throwing weaponized memes at each other to
[55:32.760 --> 55:35.640]  try to attack our unconscious mind.
[55:35.640 --> 55:45.240]  This is, I'd say, an echo of the 1960s when drug use in America became popularized and
[55:45.240 --> 55:50.640]  the images in the popular culture became hallucinogenic and psychedelic.
[55:50.640 --> 55:54.840]  And so the music, the album covers at the time, he's remembered like Jimi Hendrix with
[55:54.840 --> 55:55.840]  the Beatles and the Stones.
[55:55.840 --> 56:02.240]  It was all rubber soul and all drug induced, Lucy in the Sky with diamonds, with obviously
[56:02.240 --> 56:05.000]  LSD as their dropping acid.
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.720]  And then we went into a very serious conservative period in America with Reagan, and we had
[56:10.720 --> 56:17.720]  the movie Top Gun, the first one, and we became really a conservative based kind of straightforward
[56:17.720 --> 56:18.720]  messaging.
[56:18.720 --> 56:24.800]  But now we're back to psychedelia, but it's being weaponized with the use of social media
[56:24.800 --> 56:28.440]  memes and billions of dollars behind it.
[56:28.440 --> 56:34.080]  So this I think we're really going to see as the 2020 campaign unfolds, one of the most
[56:34.080 --> 56:40.240]  dangerously psychotic media environments that will do incredible damage to a lot of people,
[56:40.240 --> 56:46.920]  particularly younger people who are not really mature enough to understand what's going on.
[56:46.920 --> 56:54.880]  It could damage a whole generation to make them almost impossible to ever have any ability
[56:54.880 --> 56:56.920]  to think for themselves.
[56:56.920 --> 57:03.520]  But that's what people with a lot of power who want more power, they're willing to destroy
[57:03.520 --> 57:04.920]  whoever gets in their way.
[57:04.920 --> 57:08.400]  In this case it's going to be a whole new generation, it's going to be the political
[57:08.400 --> 57:11.520]  process in America, maybe even the Constitution.
[57:11.520 --> 57:17.800]  But if you know what's going on, maybe you can protect yourself from weaponized memes.
[57:17.800 --> 57:18.800]  That's it for now.
[57:18.800 --> 57:46.000]  Bye y'all.
[57:49.160 --> 57:53.480]  Three weeks ago we told you that the Pentagon had set up secret quarantine centers for the
[57:53.480 --> 57:57.560]  coronavirus and that they believed it was much more serious than we were being told.
[57:57.560 --> 57:59.560]  Now we know that that is the case.
[57:59.560 --> 58:03.360]  And we know the federal government and major corporations have been buying up all the major
[58:03.360 --> 58:07.360]  storable food supplies around the country, almost everyone else is sold out.
[58:07.360 --> 58:14.160]  But our supplier, my patriot, infowarstore.com still has their entire line of high quality
[58:14.160 --> 58:15.160]  fresh food.
[58:15.160 --> 58:16.320]  And it's fresh.
[58:16.320 --> 58:19.000]  That's why you have to wait 10 to 14 days for it to get delivered.
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.600]  Not because they don't have the food, but because they've got to package it and their
[58:21.600 --> 58:24.640]  factories are going 24 hours a day.
[58:24.640 --> 58:28.720]  High quality fresh food, the best package systems, tastes great, protects you and your
[58:28.720 --> 58:30.840]  family and funds the info war.
[58:30.840 --> 58:35.640]  You just got to get the orders in until they extended out even more, which could happen.
[58:35.640 --> 58:40.280]  Lock in your orders now, ensure you get it at infowarstore.com today.
[58:40.280 --> 58:49.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[58:49.240 --> 58:55.640]  Across the Western world, from high school to college sports to even the Olympics, men,
[58:55.640 --> 59:00.680]  biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[59:00.680 --> 59:07.280]  This is men invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away, all in
[59:07.280 --> 59:12.320]  the name of the liberalism and openness, and then every day, I have stacks of news articles.
[59:12.320 --> 59:18.480]  Just like today, UK team fined under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender
[59:18.480 --> 59:20.160]  and it hurt their feelings.
[59:20.160 --> 59:27.240]  UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay 1,000 pound fine because
[59:27.240 --> 59:32.280]  it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[59:32.280 --> 59:33.760]  That's the thought police.
[59:33.760 --> 59:38.960]  The leftist has their feeling, sir, for any reason you get fined and you go to jail.
[59:38.960 --> 59:40.240]  This is tyranny.
[59:40.240 --> 59:44.520]  These people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific
[59:44.520 --> 59:46.840]  anti human takeover.
[59:46.840 --> 59:52.240]  Resistance speak out against it.
[59:52.240 --> 1:00:17.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:17.520 --> 1:00:30.680]  Welcome into our two of the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:30.680 --> 1:00:41.400]  The president attended the American tradition of the Daytona 500 yesterday.
[1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:47.040]  Of course, the left used this as an opportunity to attack Trump, but more specifically attack
[1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:48.400]  his base.
[1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:53.320]  Trump looks to rev up his base at Daytona 500 and you can imagine, no, oh, the red next
[1:00:53.320 --> 1:01:02.800]  the white dudes, the hits, the deplorables that like NASCAR, well, there's a tens of
[1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:04.440]  millions of them.
[1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:10.560]  So you can discount them and bemoan them and insult them as much as you'd like.
[1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:18.680]  But they make up a large majority of the population, actually, and it has nothing to do with what
[1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:20.160]  you think it has to do with.
[1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:25.120]  These are just American loving patriots that like watching fast cars.
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:33.000]  And so President Trump at the Daytona 500 went a little bit like this.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:41.320]  As we walk in huge and NASCAR on Fox and the 62nd running of the great American race along
[1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:46.360]  with Jeff Gordon, Jamie Mcmurray, Chris Myers, a nice to have you along with us for this
[1:01:46.360 --> 1:01:47.360]  special moment.
[1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:54.080]  I have been to a lot of Daytona 500s, Chris, never have I felt the excitement and energy.
[1:01:54.080 --> 1:01:58.800]  We've had great races on the track, but we've got the president landing right now.
[1:01:58.800 --> 1:02:03.320]  And the fans are pumped up, I mean, wow, what a day.
[1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:06.280]  It's one of the most incredible things I've ever seen, and to see, they said that plane's
[1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:08.280]  800 feet above the racetrack right now.
[1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:11.280]  Why did they hit you by the president of the United States?
[1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:19.280]  He's the grand marshal that gives the command, president supports him, attended NASCAR.
[1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:24.280]  Air Force One gets a flyer before the race.
[1:02:24.280 --> 1:02:32.280]  And the beast, President Trump's limo, takes a laugh to get the track warmed up.
[1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:44.280]  Of course, to be proud of just going absolutely nuts, massive crowd.
[1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:58.280]  Daytona International Speedway, we love our country, and it's truly an honor to be with
[1:02:58.280 --> 1:03:13.880]  all of you at the great American race, gentlemen, start your engines.
[1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:21.880]  It was a pretty epic day at Daytona, and you heard Jeff Gordon on the pre-race commentary.
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:27.440]  I believe Jeff Gordon, I mean, I would imagine he's probably won in Daytona a couple times.
[1:03:27.440 --> 1:03:32.280]  He's a famous race car driver, one of the best.
[1:03:32.280 --> 1:03:39.160]  And so for him to say he's never had energy, he's never felt excitement like he felt at
[1:03:39.160 --> 1:03:43.440]  this Daytona because the president was there, is really telling.
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:51.200]  Now, this is yet another example of how the fake news pretends like the president isn't
[1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:58.840]  popular or pretends like they have any candidate that can even hold a candle to President Trump's
[1:03:58.840 --> 1:04:00.640]  popularity.
[1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:05.720]  No one is even close, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:08.720]  No one is even close.
[1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:16.520]  And in fact, we've got some updates coming up in the next segment from the Democrat
[1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:24.840]  side of things and the meltdown that they were in, but the recovery process that they
[1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:31.400]  are in now and where things go from here.
[1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:39.320]  Of course, we've still got fake news attacking the president.
[1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:46.040]  And it looks like their next agenda, their next scheme to try to remove Trump from office
[1:04:46.040 --> 1:04:51.280]  or detach Trump from his base is now afoot, it's now been revealed.
[1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:52.280]  We'll get to that as well.
[1:04:52.280 --> 1:04:56.920]  This is the Alex Jones show, infowars.com.
[1:04:56.920 --> 1:05:02.720]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements, ultra 12 and vitamin mineral fusion are both
[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:06.800]  back in stock after being sold out for months.
[1:05:06.800 --> 1:05:11.760]  Vitamin mineral fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids and other key co factors
[1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:16.200]  that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your
[1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:17.640]  immune systems.
[1:05:17.640 --> 1:05:23.720]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[1:05:23.720 --> 1:05:24.720]  It is back in stock.
[1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:31.720]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo
[1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:34.000]  for 50% off.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:38.320]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you
[1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:41.400]  actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:48.520]  And of course, vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just
[1:05:48.520 --> 1:05:53.640]  everything and they're both back in stock 40% off individually or 50% off when you get
[1:05:53.640 --> 1:06:05.240]  them together at infowars.com.
[1:06:05.240 --> 1:06:08.440]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:16.720]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:29.200]  Yes, we are into our two of the Alex Jones show at infowars.com filling in for Alex.
[1:06:29.200 --> 1:06:30.200]  I'm Owen Troyer.
[1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:34.640]  I've got updates coming from the Democrat side of the aisle.
[1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:39.480]  Major developments happening last week and over the weekend.
[1:06:39.480 --> 1:06:42.480]  Before I get into that, though, I want to point out a couple of things that are going
[1:06:42.480 --> 1:06:51.520]  on at infowarsstore.com right now, one, you may notice with all of the coronavirus outbreaking
[1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:57.200]  as well as other disease, but specifically the coronavirus, you're going to probably
[1:06:57.200 --> 1:07:04.080]  notice soon people marketing super silver or colloidal silver as a way to build your
[1:07:04.080 --> 1:07:10.520]  immune system and to deal with even potentially the coronavirus specifically.
[1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:20.080]  And in fact, we won't play their ads, but people are now trying to sell colloidal silver,
[1:07:20.080 --> 1:07:32.200]  a bottle of it, for hundreds of dollars, one individual in particular for $300 a bottle.
[1:07:32.200 --> 1:07:40.720]  Now at infowarsstore.com, we're selling the same stuff certified by government labs, science
[1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:41.720]  labs.
[1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:46.040]  We've got all the documentation right there, gone over it on air before I'm not going to
[1:07:46.040 --> 1:07:48.080]  be redundant here.
[1:07:48.080 --> 1:07:54.920]  And we sell it for 10% of the price at infowarsstore.com.
[1:07:54.920 --> 1:08:00.840]  So don't be duped by these Johnny come lately is by these fly by nighters, they're going
[1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:04.920]  to come in and sell you some colloidal silver for hundreds of dollars using the coronavirus
[1:08:04.920 --> 1:08:05.920]  as the backdrop.
[1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:08.920]  Yes, colloidal silver is a great way to build your immune system.
[1:08:08.920 --> 1:08:16.360]  Yes, colloidal silver has been proven to specifically go after this type of viral infection like
[1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:19.760]  coronavirus or SARS.
[1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:22.800]  But we don't jack up the price.
[1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:27.680]  We don't try to sell you something beyond the market value.
[1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:28.800]  We do the exact opposite.
[1:08:28.800 --> 1:08:32.480]  We give you the best product at the best price at infowarsstore.com.
[1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:38.680]  Now we're sold out of our silver bullet because smart shoppers said, wait a second, I'm not
[1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:42.960]  going to spend hundreds of dollars on some bottle of silver when I can go to infowarsstore.com
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:46.240]  and get it for 30.
[1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:50.240]  But we also have the immune gargle that still has the colloidal silver in it.
[1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:51.800]  It's just not for consumption.
[1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:54.360]  It's for gargling, keeping your mouth clean.
[1:08:54.360 --> 1:08:57.120]  We also have a spray that you can spray on the back of your throat.
[1:08:57.120 --> 1:08:58.120]  It coats it.
[1:08:58.120 --> 1:09:04.440]  You can even get down into your lungs, help with fighting infectious disease.
[1:09:04.440 --> 1:09:06.320]  But again, not selling it for hundreds of dollars.
[1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:10.480]  In fact, you can get, I think, 10 for still half the price that these other people are
[1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:13.160]  selling it for.
[1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:19.400]  So look at that for yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:23.240]  And then the other great thing going on is vitamin mineral fusion is on sale.
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:25.840]  But I'll get into that later.
[1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:37.240]  Let me go through the Democrat news right here.
[1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:41.120]  Bloomberg reportedly considering Hillary Clinton as his running mate.
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:45.080]  Now let's be very clear.
[1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:51.840]  And I am actually, well, let's just say it's another case of infowars is next month's next
[1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:53.000]  year's news today.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:56.960]  I was saying that Bloomberg was a favorite to win the Democrat nomination before he even
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:09:57.960]  started running.
[1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:01.640]  That was more just because it was his name being floated as a potential.
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:03.560]  And I knew that the Democrats had nothing else.
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:06.280]  Well, Bloomberg has surged.
[1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:10.240]  And in realistically, forget about the polls, forget about all the BS the Democrats run
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:11.240]  right now.
[1:10:11.240 --> 1:10:15.040]  Realistically, Bloomberg is probably number two now behind Bernie Sanders.
[1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:18.240]  Everyone else in the campaign has pretty much just been lapped.
[1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:20.720]  They're done.
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:23.920]  So why are people speculating this?
[1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:31.480]  Well, because Bloomberg added Capriccia Marshall, a Clinton ally to his 2020 campaign.
[1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:35.400]  So what is Bloomberg thinking bringing Hillary in?
[1:10:35.400 --> 1:10:40.920]  Does he think that that political power, that political purse will be advantageous?
[1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:46.480]  Of course, Hillary with the ultimate lust for revenge of Donald against Donald Trump
[1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:47.680]  trying to get in the White House.
[1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:54.000]  Obviously, we know why she would want to be in plus, she's obviously not healthy enough
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:58.600]  to do a full on presidential campaign.
[1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:04.680]  So maybe they try to slip Hillary in as the VP.
[1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:12.760]  But boy, if you're Bloomberg, do you have a death wish?
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:18.080]  So we shall see about that.
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:21.880]  But it's obvious now it's Sanders and Bloomberg.
[1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:24.000]  And it's kind of reached that point.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:28.080]  You know, we're about to get into March and then April, and that's when you pretty much
[1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:29.560]  know for sure who the nominee is going to be.
[1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:32.520]  So we've reached the point where you really get it down on the Democrats side of the final
[1:11:32.520 --> 1:11:33.520]  candidate.
[1:11:33.520 --> 1:11:35.840]  It's really going to be Bloomberg Sanders.
[1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:40.960]  And at that point, you know, you know, the Democrats running all the file, they don't
[1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:45.800]  want Sanders, so they may either just accept Bloomberg for what he is, even though he does
[1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:48.280]  seem to be kind of out of the control of the Democrat Party.
[1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:52.360]  So they may be measuring that or do they broker the convention and then ultimately it's just
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:56.120]  a total, you know, what show.
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:11:59.640]  But for Bernie Sanders, he's running into some problems now.
[1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:05.200]  Topless protesters storm stage as Bernie Sanders campaigns in Nevada is wild stuff, folks.
[1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:12.440]  This is some wacky wild stuff, women running on the stage with their breasts out, pouring
[1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:18.840]  some liquid all over them, very odd, very, very odd stuff.
[1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:23.640]  Bernie seemed to be enamored, though, I would imagine anything after looking at his wife
[1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:24.640]  is probably pleasant.
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:27.320]  Excuse me, I shouldn't be rude.
[1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:33.720]  But so you've got Sanders getting his campaigns protested.
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:35.200]  Sanders had a campaign somewhere.
[1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:40.800]  I forget where it was and someone had a huge Trump banner fly by in the background.
[1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:48.000]  Now the same Russian pranksters that got Adam Schiff to request nude photos of Donald Trump
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.600]  on the phone.
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:55.240]  Now they've got Bernie Sanders in a prank phone call thinking he's talking to Greta Thunberg,
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:58.640]  even though he wasn't.
[1:12:58.640 --> 1:12:59.640]  I'll be honest.
[1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:00.640]  So I listened to it.
[1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:02.400]  It doesn't kind of sound like Bernie.
[1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:06.320]  These pranksters are known, I mean, they've obviously gotten Schiff and they've gotten
[1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:07.320]  others.
[1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:11.080]  I mean, they're well known to do such a thing, but it does not sound like Bernie Sanders.
[1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:13.520]  So I don't know about that.
[1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:16.760]  Sanders and Bloomberg exchange blows as Democrat race heats up.
[1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:20.960]  Yeah, they're basically going after one another now because, again, anybody in reality realizes
[1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:23.520]  those are the two front runners.
[1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:27.560]  Now the Democrats are going to pretend like there's still a relevancy of a Pete Butt judge
[1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:28.800]  or whoever else.
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:31.280]  There is none.
[1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:43.000]  Now coming up next is Nevada, the Nevada caucus.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:46.160]  And I do believe guys, please double check me on this.
[1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:57.200]  I do believe that they're using the same app to count or to measure the results of the Nevada
[1:13:57.200 --> 1:14:07.560]  caucus as they did in Iowa, which is a rig job created by former Clintonites created
[1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:10.800]  by Soros.
[1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:18.480]  So and maybe that's why they're really pushing, pushing Bloomberg in now or the Democrats
[1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:21.800]  just accepting him with open arms now because they realize they have nothing else.
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:27.520]  Even when they rig it for booty judge or whoever, they just can't drum up any real support to
[1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:29.480]  compete with Sanders.
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:36.880]  So look out for that, which means they may shoot Bloomberg up ahead of Sanders in Nevada
[1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:40.640]  to really give him momentum.
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:44.160]  Speculation swirls around whether Bloomberg will make Las Vegas debate stage.
[1:14:44.160 --> 1:14:50.120]  And this will be the ultimate tell right here.
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:57.560]  If Bloomberg is on the debate stage, the Democrats have accepted him and will be promoting him
[1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:00.480]  from here on out to get the nominee.
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:07.720]  If they don't want Bloomberg, they will somehow manage to keep him off that debate stage.
[1:15:07.720 --> 1:15:14.160]  And I guess continue to try to bolster support for Klobuchar or Buddha judge.
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:15.280]  But that's your tell.
[1:15:15.280 --> 1:15:20.440]  If Bloomberg makes a debate stage, count it, it's Bloomberg versus Sanders from here on
[1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:21.880]  out.
[1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:29.520]  If Bloomberg doesn't make the debate stage, the Democrat spiral into total oblivion will
[1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:36.960]  continue and they'll remain identity list, identity list and struggling for answers as
[1:15:36.960 --> 1:15:45.080]  we get closer and closer to the 2020 election and for them, the invention in Milwaukee.
[1:15:45.080 --> 1:15:50.560]  All right, when we come back, we're going to look at some cultural news and how the
[1:15:50.560 --> 1:15:55.880]  Democrats on the left are trying to pretend like Obama's economy is a real thing.
[1:15:55.880 --> 1:15:58.920]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[1:15:58.920 --> 1:16:01.960]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:10.600]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment
[1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:13.880]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:17.800]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is
[1:17:17.800 --> 1:17:21.880]  in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:17:21.880 --> 1:17:26.440]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:32.440]  lease back program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account

[1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:51.440]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before
[1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:57.520]  purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[1:17:57.520 --> 1:18:00.320]  We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:04.880]  Humanities waking up to their tyranny, how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes,
[1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:08.640]  how they're building a post-human world, but we know they're going to strike back.
[1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:13.840]  And the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world countries
[1:18:13.840 --> 1:18:19.840]  and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the West and
[1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:24.480]  collapse our social services in a giant clowered and pivot program.
[1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:30.200]  The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government
[1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:32.440]  inner coronavirus.
[1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:38.080]  This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading
[1:18:38.080 --> 1:18:43.040]  the word because people are waking up like never before, but this fight against tyranny
[1:18:43.040 --> 1:18:44.040]  is neck and neck.
[1:18:44.040 --> 1:18:51.720]  Just spread the word about band.video and infowars.comfort slash show that is so important.
[1:18:51.720 --> 1:18:57.000]  You are at the center of the resistance, you are our only hope.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:03.320]  Across the Western world, from high school to college sports to even the Olympics, men,
[1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:08.440]  biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:14.760]  This is men invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away.
[1:19:14.760 --> 1:19:17.360]  All in the name of the liberalism and openness.
[1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:23.640]  And then every day I have stacks of news articles just like today UK team find under house arrest
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:27.880]  for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings.
[1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:34.920]  UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because
[1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:39.960]  it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[1:19:39.960 --> 1:19:41.440]  That's the thought police.
[1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:46.640]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail.
[1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:51.240]  This is tyranny, these people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part
[1:19:51.240 --> 1:19:54.480]  of a scientific anti-human takeover.
[1:19:54.480 --> 1:20:10.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:10.520 --> 1:20:23.960]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:20:23.960 --> 1:20:30.040]  Let's look at some other political and cultural news that is developing now.
[1:20:30.040 --> 1:20:37.520]  Here are the two attacks that the Democrats and their media will be waging against Trump
[1:20:37.520 --> 1:20:39.960]  in the next weeks, maybe months.
[1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:45.720]  Obviously, the Roger Stone case, his bully pulpit intervention into that is going to
[1:20:45.720 --> 1:20:46.720]  be the big one.
[1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:55.320]  They may even try to concoct some new impeachment scam over that deal.
[1:20:55.320 --> 1:20:59.080]  And I don't think Barr is doing the president any favors in that and I forgot to mention
[1:20:59.080 --> 1:21:02.040]  this earlier when I was actually getting into the weeds of this story.
[1:21:02.040 --> 1:21:06.840]  But Trump said, hey, look, I don't control these guys.
[1:21:06.840 --> 1:21:12.640]  I don't control Barr, you'd be surprised he's pretty much out there freewheeling.
[1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:18.760]  Barr pretty much confirmed that in the ABC News interview where he said, actually, I'm
[1:21:18.760 --> 1:21:22.880]  glad the president never intervenes in my business, but his tweets intervene in my business
[1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:24.200]  because the media gets involved.
[1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:26.480]  Well, that's not Trump's fault that the media is corrupt.
[1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:30.280]  So you can't tell Trump to shut up because other people are corrupt, which is basically
[1:21:30.280 --> 1:21:34.080]  what Barr did in my view.
[1:21:34.080 --> 1:21:42.800]  But that's dangerous, considering basically Barr's not working with or for Trump.
[1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:49.600]  And Trump, at least according to himself, has very little oversight over the situation.
[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:56.560]  But regardless of that, believe me, the Democrats are looking at another impeachment scam and
[1:21:56.560 --> 1:22:02.040]  using Trump's bully pulpit of Twitter and the bully pulpit intervention of the Stone
[1:22:02.040 --> 1:22:07.880]  Case as their go-to, which would just be incredible if they opened that can of worms.
[1:22:07.880 --> 1:22:09.320]  I mean, how does that even go?
[1:22:09.320 --> 1:22:11.280]  How does that even fly?
[1:22:11.280 --> 1:22:12.920]  And in fact, you know what?
[1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:18.320]  Now that I'm thinking about it, I almost bet they do because it's the trend.
[1:22:18.320 --> 1:22:21.600]  Everything else that the Democrats do that they think will lead to the removal of Trump
[1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:25.000]  or the victory for them will always blow back on them.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:29.760]  So if they want to open that can of worms, do it because you will be absolutely savaged
[1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:36.000]  by the media, and you will expose Judge Berman Jackson, you will expose the prosecutors,
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:37.840]  you will expose the jurors.
[1:22:37.840 --> 1:22:42.120]  So if the Democrats go down that road, it's only going to expose the story even bigger,
[1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:46.360]  just like Ukrainegate with Biden, just like Russiagate with Obama and Clinton.
[1:22:46.360 --> 1:22:47.760]  So go ahead and go down that road.
[1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:53.640]  But if it's not that road legally, which I do predict they will do, at least momentarily,
[1:22:53.640 --> 1:23:01.040]  it will end up being a head fake, there is a cultural war being waged against the president
[1:23:01.040 --> 1:23:03.360]  right now.
[1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:08.880]  And this was promoted all weekend on social media.
[1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:12.480]  This story from the Washington Post, but not this headline.
[1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:18.200]  The headline that was being promoted on social media was, Trump has turned American students
[1:23:18.200 --> 1:23:20.720]  into bullies.
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:23.040]  But here's the headline from the Washington Post.
[1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:28.360]  The president's rhetoric has changed the way hundreds of children are harassed in American
[1:23:28.360 --> 1:23:29.760]  classrooms.
[1:23:29.760 --> 1:23:30.760]  The Post found.
[1:23:30.760 --> 1:23:39.760]  And of course, the whole thing is about how minorities and what POCs and oh, and this
[1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:43.800]  and oh, and that and oh, it's all Trump's fault, he's the one.
[1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:46.040]  So Trump is now being blamed for bullying.
[1:23:46.040 --> 1:23:50.080]  There isn't anything that happens in this country that the left won't blame for Trump
[1:23:50.080 --> 1:23:54.880]  or blame on Trump.
[1:23:54.880 --> 1:23:59.760]  And you know, another thing kind of comes into my head just to put it out there anecdotally.
[1:23:59.760 --> 1:24:03.080]  But when is this weird notion of the left?
[1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:07.120]  It's kind of like the fake feminism, the fake women's empowerment of the left that's now
[1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:12.760]  led to men competing with women and bashing their skulls in literally.
[1:24:12.760 --> 1:24:18.600]  This whole notion that the left has now pushed that white people in this country are outdated,
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:21.880]  outnumbered by minorities.
[1:24:21.880 --> 1:24:25.320]  Don't you understand you're now turning white people into minorities?
[1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:27.640]  So when do white people start claiming minority status?
[1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:32.720]  I'm telling you that trend is going to come to fruition within the next five years, if
[1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:34.720]  not sooner.
[1:24:34.720 --> 1:24:40.360]  Unless we have a massive change of cultural direction in this country, which we don't
[1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:44.920]  because you again, it's just the same thing.
[1:24:44.920 --> 1:24:51.320]  You can't claim to be the majority to dominate people and then point the finger at your opposition
[1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:52.320]  claiming they're the majority.
[1:24:52.320 --> 1:24:54.560]  You see, that just doesn't work that this doesn't fly.
[1:24:54.560 --> 1:25:05.440]  You can't claim victimhood status as a minority as you posture yourself as the majority.
[1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:06.440]  It just doesn't work.
[1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:10.400]  And so that's just another thing that we're going to see, but let's get back to the story.
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:16.120]  Washington Post, Trump's rhetoric is causing bullying and it's all exactly what you expect.
[1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:21.960]  Oh, brown people and the Muslims and everybody on the gaze and oh my gosh, it's all Trump's
[1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:22.960]  fault.
[1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:25.280]  They're all being bullied.
[1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:29.800]  But here's how you know, ladies and gentlemen, here's the telltale signs that this is going
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:33.400]  to be the next big push by the Democrats to demonize Trump.
[1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:37.560]  The fact that this story was promoted, just utter garbage here.
[1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:41.320]  I mean, you know, if you don't know any better, you read this and you're like, oh my gosh,
[1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:42.320]  what is Trump doing?
[1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:43.320]  He's a bully.
[1:25:43.320 --> 1:25:46.480]  Oh my gosh, now children are being bullied because of Trump.
[1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:47.480]  Oh, it's so bad.
[1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:49.480]  Now they're trying to kill themselves.
[1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:50.480]  That's what they claim.
[1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:51.480]  That's what they claim in the story.
[1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:57.160]  Kids are trying to kill themselves because of bullying now because of Trump.
[1:25:57.160 --> 1:26:02.680]  And this story was promoted all weekend long, all over social media, not just them promoting
[1:26:02.680 --> 1:26:09.040]  it inside the algorithms, they had their army of blue checkmarks promoting it.
[1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:10.040]  I don't know who these people are.
[1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:14.640]  This is just some of the examples just to show you the onslaught.
[1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:15.640]  J.M.
[1:26:15.640 --> 1:26:20.960]  Riger, a Washington Post analysis found that Trump's words, yeah, Trump's words, no, it's
[1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:21.960]  just called words.
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:26.160]  I mean, did Trump write the dictionary or what are they going to say next?
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:31.200]  Trump literally made the entire English lexicon.
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:32.200]  It was all Trump.
[1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:35.440]  Trump created English language.
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:40.200]  A Washington Post analysis found that Trump's words have been used by students and school
[1:26:40.200 --> 1:26:44.400]  staff to bully children more than 300 times since 2016.
[1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:49.160]  Really, what about the thousands of physical assaults Trump supporters endure because of
[1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:50.320]  you?
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:51.320]  He goes on.
[1:26:51.320 --> 1:26:55.320]  Three-fourths of the attacks were directed at kids who are Hispanic, black, or Muslim.
[1:26:55.320 --> 1:26:59.040]  Oh, and there it is, yeah.
[1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:03.520]  The Washington Post, they treated this out like a hundred times.
[1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:08.920]  For educators, the ongoing threat of politically-charged harassment is impossible to ignore.
[1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:14.560]  Schools have canceled mock elections, banned political gear, formed student-led meditation
[1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:17.640]  groups and created committees to develop anti-discrimination policies.
[1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:20.440]  Oh, yes, because of Trump.
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:25.880]  And by the way, I'm proud I can be able to get through all this, but folks, here's what
[1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:28.320]  needs to be done in response to this.
[1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:31.440]  Okay, now if this happens, it probably won't.
[1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:34.560]  But I'm giving you, this is the game plan to victory.
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:40.560]  All you have to do, if 20 Trump supporters wear a Trump hat to school tomorrow, high
[1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:45.280]  school, college, elementary, whatever, a hundred, what would happen?
[1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:46.280]  They filmed it.
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:47.280]  What would happen?
[1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:48.280]  They'd be bullied.
[1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:49.780]  They'd probably be physically assaulted.
[1:27:49.780 --> 1:27:52.800]  They'd probably be harassed by the staff and the teacher.
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:53.800]  I've talked to these people.
[1:27:53.800 --> 1:27:54.920]  They send me messages.
[1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:56.480]  Some of them record it.
[1:27:56.480 --> 1:27:57.480]  Okay?
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:02.200]  So the real discrimination is against Trump supporters.
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:04.840]  The real bullying is against Trump supporters.
[1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:08.480]  Now is there bullying of all sorts going on in schools and are they using words and are
[1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:09.480]  they going to blame Trump?
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:10.480]  Okay, yeah.
[1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:13.320]  But that's not what's really happening here.
[1:28:13.320 --> 1:28:19.320]  To sit here and act like Trump haters are being discriminated against is the most unbelievable
[1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:22.520]  reversal of reality I can ever imagine.
[1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:24.520]  But that's what they're doing.
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:30.240]  Just as Trump has repeatedly targeted Latinos, so too have school bullies.
[1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:35.420]  Students hurl, build the wall, or go back where you came from at children of color.
[1:28:35.420 --> 1:28:39.440]  School staff members intimidate students.
[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:44.920]  Since Trump's rays of office, his language has seeped into schools across America.
[1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:46.680]  John Woodward's Cox, he retweets it.
[1:28:46.680 --> 1:28:48.840]  I mean, folks, they are pushing this story.
[1:28:48.840 --> 1:28:51.960]  So this is their latest attempt culturally to demonize Trump.
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:52.960]  He's a bully.
[1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:56.040]  He's causing children to be bullied and kill themselves.
[1:28:56.040 --> 1:29:01.120]  Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:05.040]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state until one day I chose to lead
[1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:06.480]  my family to freedom.

[1:29:10.920 --> 1:29:14.000]  our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[1:29:49.560 --> 1:30:02.560]  Three weeks ago, we told you that the Pentagon had set up secret quarantine centers for the
[1:30:02.560 --> 1:30:06.640]  coronavirus and that they believed it was much more serious than we were being told.
[1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:10.960]  Now we know that that is the case, and we know the federal government and major corporations
[1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:15.440]  have been buying up all the major storable food supplies around the country, almost everyone
[1:30:15.440 --> 1:30:16.440]  else is sold out.
[1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:23.240]  But our supplier, my patriot, InfowarsStore.com still has their entire line of high-quality
[1:30:23.240 --> 1:30:25.360]  fresh food, and it's fresh.
[1:30:25.360 --> 1:30:28.080]  That's why you have to wait 10 to 14 days for it to get delivered.
[1:30:28.080 --> 1:30:30.680]  Not because they don't have the food, but because they've got to package it and their
[1:30:30.680 --> 1:30:33.720]  factories are going 24 hours a day.
[1:30:33.720 --> 1:30:37.840]  High-quality fresh food, the best package systems, tastes great, protects you and your
[1:30:37.840 --> 1:30:39.960]  family, and funds the Infowar.
[1:30:39.960 --> 1:30:44.720]  You just got to get the orders in until they extend it out even more, which could happen.

[1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:56.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:30:56.720 --> 1:31:01.800]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election, and already you've seen all
[1:31:01.800 --> 1:31:03.240]  sorts of crazy things happen.
[1:31:03.240 --> 1:31:06.800]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy, they're trying to start wars, they're trying
[1:31:06.800 --> 1:31:10.200]  to overthrow the president, they're trying to silence free speech, they're trying to
[1:31:10.200 --> 1:31:14.400]  trigger riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing up in their face.
[1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:19.240]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering
[1:31:19.240 --> 1:31:23.800]  their lies, and we have to be prepared in case things go south.
[1:31:23.800 --> 1:31:28.680]  That's why it's so critical to go to InfowarsStore.com and stock up on high-quality preparedness

[1:31:49.600 --> 1:31:53.160]  The only way we can be defeated is if you don't take action.

[1:31:58.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  Real stuff, man.
[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:01.760]  We're talking about the real deal here, and I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell
[1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:05.720]  you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over and everybody
[1:32:05.720 --> 1:32:10.040]  oh, I mean, I've got a problem, and we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[1:32:10.040 --> 1:32:14.080]  It said about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[1:32:14.080 --> 1:32:19.080]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach
[1:32:19.080 --> 1:32:23.960]  the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, Infowars.com,
[1:32:23.960 --> 1:32:26.120]  and it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[1:32:26.120 --> 1:32:29.960]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without
[1:32:29.960 --> 1:32:30.960]  even disrupting things.
[1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:32.520]  People say, why are you doing this?
[1:32:32.520 --> 1:32:33.520]  What's happening?
[1:32:33.520 --> 1:32:36.760]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored, and Trump won't do anything about it.
[1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:40.200]  And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this
[1:32:40.200 --> 1:32:41.200]  yet.
[1:32:41.200 --> 1:32:42.200]  It's brilliant.
[1:32:42.200 --> 1:32:46.560]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made
[1:32:46.560 --> 1:32:48.000]  it into a weapon.
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:50.960]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[1:32:50.960 --> 1:32:59.760]  And you know what's most disturbing to people, silence.
[1:32:59.760 --> 1:33:07.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:07.600 --> 1:33:21.400]  All right, I'm not done getting through all of this news, but I need to be very efficient,
[1:33:21.400 --> 1:33:29.520]  diligent, and move quickly through these stories before we're joined by our guest, Diana Lorraine,
[1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:35.800]  and then Jeff Nyquist, an expert to discuss the coronavirus outbreak, which incredibly,
[1:33:35.800 --> 1:33:38.040]  I mean, it's just unbelievable, folks.
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:44.960]  It almost becomes numbing just how tomorrow's news today we are, and we just, it's just
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:46.360]  like part of the process.
[1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:50.800]  We don't even have time to really reflect on it.
[1:33:50.800 --> 1:33:55.840]  But here's what else is going on right now with the left politically and culturally.
[1:33:55.840 --> 1:34:03.640]  Now again, this is why Trump has to have a real lasting victory, because it's the only
[1:34:03.640 --> 1:34:06.200]  way to defeat the brainwashing and the propaganda.
[1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:08.600]  It's the only way.
[1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:17.760]  Now you have Barack Obama on Twitter today taking credit for Trump's economy.
[1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:28.920]  Now they've already released numbers, ladies and gentlemen, 95% of all new jobs during
[1:34:28.920 --> 1:34:33.120]  Obama era were part-time or contract.
[1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:41.640]  Now in the Trump jobs boom, they've been mostly full-time jobs, salary jobs.
[1:34:41.640 --> 1:34:43.600]  But Obama wanted the gig economy.
[1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:44.600]  He talked about this.
[1:34:44.600 --> 1:34:47.880]  He said Americans will just have to accept this is how it is.
[1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:54.640]  Then when Trump campaigned saying he'd fix Obama's broken economy, fix Obama's debt
[1:34:54.640 --> 1:34:56.680]  economy, then what did Obama say?
[1:34:56.680 --> 1:34:57.960]  Well, what does he have?
[1:34:57.960 --> 1:34:58.960]  A magic wand?
[1:34:58.960 --> 1:34:59.960]  It's just not going to happen.
[1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:04.160]  Oh, but it did happen, you jackass.
[1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:05.800]  Almost said something even worse than that.
[1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:06.800]  I controlled myself there.
[1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:17.480]  It's just this liar, this total fraud, this phony, Obama, this crap stain on the underwear
[1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:22.280]  of America.
[1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:27.280]  Sits here, takes credit for Trump's economy, but this is what angers me about it, folks.
[1:35:27.280 --> 1:35:33.240]  His little minions think it's real, everything good in the world is thanks to Obama and everything
[1:35:33.240 --> 1:35:35.320]  bad in the world is because of Trump.
[1:35:35.320 --> 1:35:38.280]  That's how brainwashed these people are.
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:49.040]  And until the truth about Obama comes out with no doubt, with no room for debate, we
[1:35:49.040 --> 1:36:01.320]  will continue to be berated with these lies of who Obama was.
[1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:06.560]  I'm not even sure why this story gets re-brought up, but it's important to remember.
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:10.000]  But it was on my desk, I said, well, heck, from infohors.com.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:15.200]  We're 18 to 20 CIA sources killed or imprisoned because Hillary Clinton's emails were being
[1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:17.840]  hacked in real time by China.
[1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:18.840]  Hacked.
[1:36:18.840 --> 1:36:22.000]  I mean, it's like, again, I've made the analogy.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:25.320]  Hillary Clinton was a political whore.
[1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:31.120]  I mean, see, the problem is a physical, like an actual woman that wants to be a prostitute
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:35.560]  or whatever, she can only be with, you know, there's a finite amount of guys you can really
[1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:37.280]  be with at the same time.
[1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:39.440]  Hillary just had a wide open email server.
[1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:40.440]  Anybody could get in.
[1:36:40.440 --> 1:36:44.560]  Hundreds of people, thousands of people, anybody in China, I mean, she was a, I mean,
[1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:50.920]  the biggest, I mean, if she, every STD Hillary Clinton has politically, I mean, you don't
[1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:55.960]  touch that, I mean, politically, like, I'm not trying to be rude, but politically, seriously,
[1:36:55.960 --> 1:37:00.160]  you know, Hillary's got, I mean, she looks like she has AIDS.
[1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:04.400]  She's got her, she's like balding.
[1:37:04.400 --> 1:37:07.600]  She's got, you know, herpes breaking out all over herself.
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:12.440]  I mean, you can, you're like, oh my gosh, but that's Hillary politically.
[1:37:12.440 --> 1:37:15.200]  She's a political whore.
[1:37:15.200 --> 1:37:19.320]  And now she's trying to latch on to Bloomberg's campaign.
[1:37:19.320 --> 1:37:24.200]  But this is what the Democrats, let's move on.
[1:37:24.200 --> 1:37:28.800]  Career criminal, thanks New York Democrats for law freeing him after 139th arrest.
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:34.600]  Now look, everything that the Trump administration is doing and that people are talking about
[1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:41.120]  with criminal reform and all this stuff, it really all just comes down to one thing,
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:48.800]  ladies and gentlemen, the war on drugs, that's all it is, end the war on drugs.
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:50.800]  And that's your criminal justice reform.
[1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:56.200]  The guy caught smoking a joint or blowing a line or all of this crap won't be arrested
[1:37:56.200 --> 1:37:59.120]  and thrown in jail for nonviolent crimes.
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:06.720]  There is your justice reform now, this, this reforming on the back end case by case thing
[1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:10.600]  has been proven not to work quite frankly.
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:18.000]  Democrat lawmaker in Alabama proposes bill requiring men to have vasectomies, wow.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:25.040]  Of course, this is outrageous, but she says, if you're going to have a heartbeat bill to
[1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:30.680]  stop children from being murdered, well, then we're going to tell men to have a vasectomy.
[1:38:30.680 --> 1:38:34.280]  What, huh?
[1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:37.640]  This is how deranged these people are.
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:39.920]  And they say it's all about control of their own bodies.
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:40.920]  Here you go.
[1:38:40.920 --> 1:38:42.040]  You want to talk about control of your body?
[1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:43.440]  Don't have sex.
[1:38:43.440 --> 1:38:44.440]  Wow.
[1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:48.320]  That's a mean revolutionary idea.
[1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:52.480]  Oh, what's this?
[1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:56.400]  Austin, Texas becoming Los Angeles, California, right before my very eyes.
[1:38:56.400 --> 1:39:03.320]  Man arrested after threatening to kill children at Austin church playground.
[1:39:03.320 --> 1:39:10.360]  Now I'm proud to say our great IT guy who wears many hats around here, Michael Zimmerman,
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:15.960]  has started a petition to have Mayor Adler resign and he's serious about it.
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:18.840]  I am sick of that little twerp.
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:23.680]  Seriously, folks, let me tell you, I've been in Austin almost five years and I've seriously
[1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:27.120]  watched this city decay right before my very eyes.
[1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:33.160]  I got, I moved to Austin kind of like right after the peak on like the bad end of the
[1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:37.320]  tech boom where just, it's just everybody moving in and then the bad end of all these
[1:39:37.320 --> 1:39:41.120]  Democrats getting in and then controlling city council and now Austin is just a damn
[1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:42.120]  hellhole.
[1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:45.400]  I mean, it's, it's, it's a hellhole, folks, I'm sorry.
[1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:49.800]  And it could be so beautiful, it has so much potential, it really does, but the Democrats
[1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:52.080]  have destroyed it.
[1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:55.560]  I mean, there's just no day, just no debate.
[1:39:55.560 --> 1:39:57.440]  Homeless people are killing people.
[1:39:57.440 --> 1:40:00.320]  Homeless people are threatening children with knives.
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:02.840]  Homeless people are breaking into cars.
[1:40:02.840 --> 1:40:04.600]  People can't even go downtown anymore.
[1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:06.080]  They're crapping in the streets.
[1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:07.920]  They're urinating in the streets.
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:13.240]  It's now, it's now become Los Angeles, Texas.
[1:40:13.240 --> 1:40:15.920]  It's heartbreaking.
[1:40:15.920 --> 1:40:18.960]  It's absolutely heartbreaking.
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:23.280]  And it's just another example of what Democrats do to cities, but they won't stop them.
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:24.280]  It never does.
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:29.120]  It never stops the dumb asses from voting for them either.
[1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:33.240]  This is nuts.
[1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:42.600]  People has decided to not only fund chunky yogurt trying to get into Congress, now they
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:51.160]  are funding the young Turks to the tune of millions of dollars to start their own educational
[1:40:51.160 --> 1:40:54.440]  academy on YouTube.
[1:40:54.440 --> 1:40:56.720]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:40:57.720]  That's right.
[1:40:57.720 --> 1:41:04.240]  The young Turks is receiving funding from YouTube to launch an online course called
[1:41:04.240 --> 1:41:09.960]  the Young Turks Academy.
[1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:16.160]  And they're getting tens of millions of dollars, maybe even hundreds, almost a billion dollars
[1:41:16.160 --> 1:41:18.000]  to do so.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:21.240]  Yeah, that story is in Axios.
[1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:24.480]  And you know why they're funding the young Turks to do that, ladies and gentlemen, because
[1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:34.520]  they want your kids to do this, trans kids charity promoted by Starbucks.
[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:37.600]  It will be promoted by the young Turks to your children.
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:39.960]  They will say anything white people is bad.
[1:41:39.960 --> 1:41:42.040]  They'll promote stuff like this.
[1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:46.880]  Bachelor contestant Victoria F apologizes for white lives matter chute.
[1:41:46.880 --> 1:41:50.080]  And while you're sitting here saying, well, white lives matter chute, I thought it was
[1:41:50.080 --> 1:41:51.920]  okay to be white folks.
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:53.560]  This wasn't even about white people.
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:55.280]  It was about fish.
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:58.840]  It was about fish.
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:04.720]  She was doing a white lives matter campaign for a fish, save this fish that is in danger,
[1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:08.000]  had nothing to do with people, doesn't matter.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  Still racist.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  It's about a fish.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:13.040]  It's about a fish.
[1:42:13.040 --> 1:42:19.200]  The Young Turks Academy, I'm sure, will be promoting having sex with robots and porn.
[1:42:19.200 --> 1:42:23.400]  Hell, chunky yogurt says go bang, you know, an animal and it's cool.
[1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:29.320]  Literally, he said that, he promotes bestiality.
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:32.480]  You know, it's okay, he says to engage bestiality.
[1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:35.840]  Sex robots may cause psychological damage, yet so does porn.
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:38.480]  What do you think bestiality will do to you?
[1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:41.920]  And then they'll promote the brain chip and say it's good for you.
[1:42:41.920 --> 1:42:45.600]  Scientists switch monkey brains on or off using electricity and experiment.
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:51.360]  Now imagine the control they will have over your mind and your brain if you put an implant
[1:42:51.360 --> 1:42:52.360]  or a chip in it.
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:55.640]  Lights out, baby.
[1:42:55.640 --> 1:42:57.400]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:03.600]  Coronavirus is a man-made bio weapon designed to destroy nation states, economies and free
[1:43:03.600 --> 1:43:07.560]  peoples and usher in a planetary government.
[1:43:07.560 --> 1:43:09.960]  This is how the globalists are striking back.
[1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:12.160]  Here's a fortune headline today.
[1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:18.760]  Fears of global coronavirus contagion rage as 3,000 cruise ship passengers return home
[1:43:18.760 --> 1:43:22.040]  and that's just in one nation.
[1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:27.600]  The US deals a major blow to German car factories in China that reporting it could cut their
[1:43:27.600 --> 1:43:31.440]  sales in half this year.
[1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:34.720]  That's how major this is.
[1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:36.280]  Everyone needs to be prepared.

[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:49.080]  the fact that the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth.

[1:45:22.580 --> 1:45:26.320]  2020 is not a year to play games with.
[1:45:26.320 --> 1:45:30.080]  The globalists are trying to create economic collapse, race riots.
[1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:33.080]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[1:45:33.080 --> 1:45:36.160]  That's why listeners to Info Wars need to be prepared.

[1:45:55.560 --> 1:46:04.560]  At the end of World War II, Adolf Hitler had discredited the eugenics and world population control organizations.
[1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:09.560]  They openly had meetings and led by Julian Huxley, Aldous Huxley's brother,
[1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:13.560]  decided to repackage themselves as transhumanists.
[1:46:13.560 --> 1:46:20.560]  Now in the year 2020, to set the precedent that people can be turned into cyborgs,
[1:46:20.560 --> 1:46:23.560]  that robots can be given rights, you name it.
[1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:30.560]  They are intimidating and arresting people all over the world who simply misgender someone.
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:37.560]  So the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is if you can't even tell what they are.
[1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:45.560]  This is the ultimate Kafkaesque mind control, and there's several big articles up on infowarstore.com that break this down.
[1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:50.560]  UK teen fine under house arrest for asking trans police officers, gender,
[1:46:50.560 --> 1:47:07.560]  UK mother, spared jail for misgendering trans woman, ordered to pay 1,000 pound fine.
[1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:24.560]  And now, your host, Owen Shroyer.
[1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:41.560]  Well, I'm very encouraged, what I'm seeing on a local level, politically.
[1:47:41.560 --> 1:47:47.560]  I'm seeing a lot of patriots, a lot of Americans, a lot of Trump supporters,
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:54.560]  a lot of conservatives that are running for office, obviously fighting an uphill battle against the establishment.
[1:47:54.560 --> 1:47:58.560]  But doing it anyway, this is exactly what we need.
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:04.560]  This is exactly how we continue this political revolution that's going on right now.
[1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:15.560]  And one of those individuals is Deanna Lorraine running out in San Francisco to try to unseat Nancy Pelosi.
[1:48:15.560 --> 1:48:19.560]  In fact, we'll have a little fun with that later on.
[1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:27.560]  But I wanted to bring something up with Deanna Lorraine and also just get her take on President's Day.
[1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:34.560]  I know that she wanted to come on for President's Day and kind of give President Trump a special salute.
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:37.560]  And I'm going to ask her a question about a news story that's developing.
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:42.560]  Deanna Lorraine, thank you for joining us on this President's Day.
[1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:46.560]  Absolutely, it's an honor to be here on President's Day on Info Wars.
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:48.560]  I wouldn't want to spend it any other way.
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:50.560]  So thanks, Owen and Alex.
[1:48:50.560 --> 1:48:54.560]  What do you think about the president right now?
[1:48:54.560 --> 1:48:57.560]  I mean, I see him at NASCAR over the weekend.
[1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:01.560]  I see chiefs players saying they're excited to go to the White House.
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:06.560]  I see his approval numbers continue to skyrocket.
[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:10.560]  I mean, to me, sad the media won't report this.
[1:49:10.560 --> 1:49:14.560]  President Trump really is what Obama was reported as.
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:17.560]  Trump is the one who cares about Americans.
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:19.560]  Trump is the one fighting for economy.
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:21.560]  Trump is the one trying to secure the borders.
[1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:25.560]  And quite frankly, the big lie here, Trump is the one that's popular.
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:27.560]  Trump is the one that's delivered.
[1:49:27.560 --> 1:49:30.560]  Trump is the one that is the most popular president of all time.
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:40.560]  All these things the establishment media tried to falsely inflate Obama as, which he wasn't, Trump actually is.
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:44.560]  Oh, yeah. I mean, it's incredible because he is the people's president.
[1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:46.560]  You know, he's not bought.
[1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:49.560]  You can't make him do anything that he doesn't want to do.
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:58.560]  He truly does things for the people and he bends over backwards for us to have power and for him to reduce his power.
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:00.560]  You know, everyone says he's a demagogue.
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:02.560]  You know, he's a dictator.
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:11.560]  No, if he was a dictator, he first of all would be able to get a lot more done without having a without being handcuffed, you know, by the Congress and by Nancy Pelosi.
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:17.560]  But this is a man that is truly for the people and wants to give the power back to the people and the results show it.
[1:50:17.560 --> 1:50:22.560]  He is he is just achieving accomplishment after accomplishment, victory after victory.
[1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:28.560]  And when you just see the crowds roar at Daytona 500, people love him.
[1:50:28.560 --> 1:50:30.560]  And these are the people that are open about it.
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:36.560]  I know there are so many people that are there that are slowly breaking their silence or slowly coming around to Trump.
[1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:38.560]  And they said I didn't vote for him last time.
[1:50:38.560 --> 1:50:42.560]  I was one of those people that was brainwashed, but I'm going to vote for him this time.
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:44.560]  And I'm excited to do it.
[1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:47.560]  Well, and I think there's really a story there, too.
[1:50:47.560 --> 1:50:49.560]  Again, this is what the media just ignores.
[1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:50.560]  That's a huge story.
[1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:53.560]  I've seen it in my life.
[1:50:53.560 --> 1:50:58.560]  People who were not going to vote Trump, maybe conservatives just didn't want to vote Trump.
[1:50:58.560 --> 1:51:01.560]  They kind of had that fear that the media instilled in them.
[1:51:01.560 --> 1:51:05.560]  And then, of course, the Democrats that wouldn't vote Trump, they believed all the media lies.
[1:51:05.560 --> 1:51:07.560]  Yeah, a lot of Democrats have flipped.
[1:51:07.560 --> 1:51:13.560]  A lot of that has to do with, you know, Nancy Pelosi and the type of destructive behavior that the Democrats are exhibiting.
[1:51:13.560 --> 1:51:25.560]  But then also on the conservative side, too, just all the success of President Trump, the sticking to message, getting the results and being the president that nobody thought he could be,
[1:51:25.560 --> 1:51:31.560]  at least, you know, from the people that believe there lies about Trump heading into the election.
[1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:33.560]  I'm hearing now more than ever.
[1:51:33.560 --> 1:51:34.560]  I'm going to vote Trump.
[1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:36.560]  I didn't vote Trump last election.
[1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:38.560]  People are more energized now to go vote Trump.
[1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:44.560]  Of course, you know what that means. This is why the Democrats are pushing for all the illegal voting techniques.
[1:51:44.560 --> 1:51:49.560]  No voter ID, citizenship for all, driver's license for all, open the borders.
[1:51:49.560 --> 1:51:54.560]  And so you're kind of seeing the formula of how Democrats get into office.
[1:51:54.560 --> 1:51:59.560]  Media campaign smears against their opponent and then illegal voting.
[1:51:59.560 --> 1:52:01.560]  Exactly. They have nothing else.
[1:52:01.560 --> 1:52:03.560]  They've lost the people.
[1:52:03.560 --> 1:52:04.560]  What do they have?
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:06.560]  Free healthcare for all?
[1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:07.560]  What do they have?
[1:52:07.560 --> 1:52:10.560]  You know, hey, you can choose whatever gender that you want.
[1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:11.560]  That's great.
[1:52:11.560 --> 1:52:13.560]  You know, Democrats support that conservatives don't.
[1:52:13.560 --> 1:52:15.560]  What do they have?
[1:52:15.560 --> 1:52:16.560]  They have no message.
[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:21.560]  Everything that they claim to do, Trump is actually doing and doing it a hell of a lot better.
[1:52:21.560 --> 1:52:27.560]  And with less money spent, you know, he is the is the president that is restoring patriotism.
[1:52:27.560 --> 1:52:35.560]  And I think as many times as people say that, you know, they hate these Trump rallies or they, you know, they think he's a narcissist or whatever they think,
[1:52:35.560 --> 1:52:44.560]  because of the Democrats with enough of this messaging and enough of his accomplishments and that patriotism, you know, the rockets blasting into the air,
[1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:50.560]  the the jets, all of the things he does, waving the flags, it sinks into the heart of every American.
[1:52:50.560 --> 1:52:53.560]  And at some point they can't resist it.
[1:52:53.560 --> 1:52:56.560]  You know, it's like having a big jelly donut in front of you.
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:52:58.560]  At some point you just got to take it.
[1:52:58.560 --> 1:52:59.560]  And this is what they're doing.
[1:52:59.560 --> 1:53:08.560]  They they they're so tired of this division and they're so tired of the negative negative negative three sixty five that comes from all of the news networks,
[1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:11.560]  except for maybe Fox and Info Wars, of course.
[1:53:11.560 --> 1:53:14.560]  But it's it's really all negative and they're tired of it.
[1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:18.560]  And it feels good to be accomplished and to focus on accomplishments.
[1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:21.560]  It feels good to focus on pride in America.
[1:53:21.560 --> 1:53:25.560]  And they're finally seeing that that's why Trump has to be on Twitter.
[1:53:25.560 --> 1:53:33.560]  That's why Trump has to have his rallies, you know, for the people out there that kind of hold their nose and take Trump's tweets.
[1:53:33.560 --> 1:53:36.560]  He has to be on there to fight the fake news and to put the truth out.
[1:53:36.560 --> 1:53:45.560]  And he has to have rallies so that he can show, look, I get 20,000 people at a rally, no matter where I go, upwards of 50,000 sometimes.
[1:53:45.560 --> 1:53:49.560]  The top Democrat Bernie Sanders fills a high school gymnasium and that's peak.
[1:53:49.560 --> 1:53:52.560]  And even the liberal media is having to report that now.
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:53.560]  Right.
[1:53:53.560 --> 1:53:58.560]  But I want to kind of pivot here and get your take on something.
[1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:04.560]  Now, if you recall, when Trump first got in, they started this whole Me Too movement.
[1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:06.560]  It really came out of Hollywood.
[1:54:06.560 --> 1:54:10.560]  But using the mainstream media, they tried to somehow project it onto Trump.
[1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:12.560]  And it was really politically inspired.
[1:54:12.560 --> 1:54:14.560]  I think that we all know that now.
[1:54:14.560 --> 1:54:15.560]  Well, it didn't stick.
[1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:17.560]  The Me Too movement didn't get Trump out of office.
[1:54:17.560 --> 1:54:20.560]  It didn't work to detach Trump from his base.
[1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:21.560]  So where did it go?
[1:54:21.560 --> 1:54:23.560]  What did it turn into?
[1:54:23.560 --> 1:54:25.560]  Well, it's just kind of floated out there.
[1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:26.560]  It was the biggest focus.
[1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:32.560]  Democrats running around with pussy hats on, starting women's marches, all this craziness, huge story, Harvey Weinstein.
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:35.560]  Oh, and now we can get Harvey Weinstein and that'll lead us to Trump.
[1:54:35.560 --> 1:54:41.560]  Well, Harvey Weinstein is now in the moment of either getting got or getting off.
[1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:43.560]  Looks like he's going to walk.
[1:54:43.560 --> 1:54:45.560]  No media.
[1:54:45.560 --> 1:54:46.560]  No one talking about this.
[1:54:46.560 --> 1:54:48.560]  Not on the clock coverage.
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:49.560]  What happened to the Me Too movement?
[1:54:49.560 --> 1:54:51.560]  What happened to protecting women?
[1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:57.560]  Harvey Weinstein's probably going to get off here and the media is silent.
[1:54:57.560 --> 1:54:58.560]  Well, that's what they do.
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:01.560]  They only weaponize women when it benefits them politically.
[1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:06.560]  That's the only time they weaponize women, like with Kavanaugh, like with Trump, right?
[1:55:06.560 --> 1:55:09.560]  Like with every other Republican man or white man.
[1:55:09.560 --> 1:55:10.560]  That's what they do.
[1:55:10.560 --> 1:55:17.560]  But in the meantime, here's what happens is it completely shatters the actual relationship between men and women in reality.
[1:55:17.560 --> 1:55:27.560]  So now there's all these repercussions from what happened with their Me Too movement and what happened with how they completely skewered Kavanaugh and President Trump over this.
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:29.560]  Now men don't trust women.
[1:55:29.560 --> 1:55:32.560]  Now a lot of men don't want to be alone in the same room with a woman.
[1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:38.560]  And you know, it was Valentine's Day over the weekend and it's funny you bring that up.
[1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:45.560]  You read all these horror stories of people who can't be in relationships or women that are single and you just can't even believe it.
[1:55:45.560 --> 1:55:47.560]  You're spot on.
[1:55:47.560 --> 1:55:49.560]  I don't know if you can attribute it to one thing.
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:56:01.560]  There's a whole factor of things, but no doubt the left's political agenda has added to the destruction of male and female biologically, you know, promoted relationships.
[1:56:01.560 --> 1:56:03.560]  I mean, it really has.
[1:56:03.560 --> 1:56:06.560]  I mean, boys and girls growing up don't even know what to do.
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:07.560]  Yeah.
[1:56:07.560 --> 1:56:09.560]  No, it's radical feminism that has destroyed relationships.
[1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:11.560]  And now they're paying for it.
[1:56:11.560 --> 1:56:14.560]  You know, and now people don't believe when there's Me Too claims anymore.
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:16.560]  They don't believe it because they're the boy who cried wolf.
[1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:18.560]  OK, so this is what's happening.
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:26.560]  If they're going to, they're going to cry Me Too with Judge Kavanaugh, then they need to do the same consistently with their people, you know, with Weinstein.
[1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:28.560]  I mean, this is, this is absolutely insane.
[1:56:28.560 --> 1:56:30.560]  This is why people don't trust the left anymore.
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:35.560]  This is why they fall on deaf ears, why people are going to vote for Trump and they're coming around to conservatives because we tell the truth.
[1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:38.560]  We're common sense and they know it and they just can't hide anymore.
[1:56:38.560 --> 1:56:40.560]  They can't play the same games.
[1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:41.560]  The jig is up Democrats.
[1:56:41.560 --> 1:56:43.560]  The jig is up.
[1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:44.560]  Well, it really is.
[1:56:44.560 --> 1:56:50.560]  But unfortunately, people are still under the control of the Democrats and their media.
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:56.560]  They haven't gotten outside of that matrix yet, but I do think that day is coming.
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:57:00.560]  So will they care about, will they care about the Weinstein case?
[1:57:00.560 --> 1:57:01.560]  I doubt it.
[1:57:01.560 --> 1:57:06.560]  And I think they'll act like they care once he is, once he is basically not charged with anything.
[1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:08.560]  But another story that's developing right now.
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:15.560]  Judge takes rare step of allowing elusive Gislaine Maxwell to be served with lawsuit by email.
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:16.560]  So she's in hiding.
[1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:25.560]  And by the way, I saw a bunch of stories of the left criticizing people that believe in Pizzagate or QAnon or all this stuff.
[1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:28.560]  And then they say it's all about Epstein.
[1:57:28.560 --> 1:57:30.560]  Why do they have to make it about this?
[1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:33.560]  We're the ones that talked about Epstein.
[1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:34.560]  Like that's what it is.
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:36.560]  Like Pizzagate is Epstein.
[1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:38.560]  Like don't you get it?
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:40.560]  Pizzagate is Anthony Wiener.
[1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:41.560]  Hello.
[1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:43.560]  Uh, Laura Sillsby.

[1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:49.560]  This should really be easier than it is.

[1:58:11.560 --> 1:58:17.560]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:20.560]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen.
[1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:29.560]  And I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.

[1:59:42.560 --> 1:59:48.560]  That's infowarslife.com.
[1:59:48.560 --> 1:59:53.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:53.560 --> 1:59:56.560]  Attention customers, attention customers.
[1:59:56.560 --> 2:00:01.560]  Can I get Pelosi for bitch with a big room to meet her party?
[2:00:01.560 --> 2:00:03.560]  Pelosi's a bitch.
[2:00:03.560 --> 2:00:06.560]  You're getting room to meet her party.
[2:00:06.560 --> 2:00:08.560]  I got the crew with that one.
[2:00:08.560 --> 2:00:10.560]  They hadn't seen that one yet.
[2:00:10.560 --> 2:00:12.560]  I don't know if our guest Deanna Lorraine has seen that one yet.
[2:00:12.560 --> 2:00:17.560]  But I mean, this is one of the greatest Walmart pranks of all time.
[2:00:17.560 --> 2:00:21.560]  You had some people do a Clinton killed Epstein.
[2:00:21.560 --> 2:00:27.560]  You had some people, I forget what were Clinton killed Epstein, Prince Philip killed Epstein or Philip.
[2:00:27.560 --> 2:00:32.560]  So anyway, there were some people that did this to troll the Epstein didn't kill himself meme.
[2:00:32.560 --> 2:00:37.560]  And so somebody went into a Walmart, went to customer service and said,
[2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:45.560]  Can you please call for my friend, Pelosi, Subbitch, Pelosi, Subbitch, and the, here, go ahead and put it again.
[2:00:45.560 --> 2:01:00.560]  I mean, I'm not encouraging people to go to their local Walmart and ask for the customer service to look for Pelosi.
[2:01:00.560 --> 2:01:03.560]  So bitch, but I'm, but I'm also not discouraging it.
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:05.560]  I encourage it.
[2:01:05.560 --> 2:01:07.560]  That's hilarious.
[2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:09.560]  I need to give you guys my tape.
[2:01:09.560 --> 2:01:16.560]  Since I got since I've been doing calls, obviously calling outreach and phone banking to the district of San Francisco.
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:20.560]  And then of course I flew my Pelosi for prison banner again yesterday in San Francisco.
[2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:25.560]  And it's funny, I get about 99% of people that are favorable to it.
[2:01:25.560 --> 2:01:27.560]  They're excited about it and they think it's badass.
[2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:36.560]  But then I get these random calls and I have a couple of voicemails that are hilarious that, you know, say that I'm a fascist that I need to go to jail.
[2:01:36.560 --> 2:01:38.560]  I need to go to a death camp.
[2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:44.560]  If I want to run as a Republican in San Francisco, you know, so much for free speech here in San Francisco.
[2:01:44.560 --> 2:01:48.560]  But I need to forward you guys some of these voice messages because they're pretty.
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:52.560]  Are you saying it's just like citizens leaving you threatening voicemails?
[2:01:52.560 --> 2:01:54.560]  Yes.
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:01:57.560]  I mean, you take this pretty well. You're you're laughing it off.
[2:01:57.560 --> 2:02:01.560]  I mean, I would mean you should probably be calling for an FBI investigation.
[2:02:01.560 --> 2:02:05.560]  Well, you know, I mean, they're leaving me, they're leaving me voicemails.
[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:07.560]  I mean, it's their right to free speech.
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:10.560]  I guess it reaches a new level when it's a death threat.
[2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:11.560]  You see, here's my problem.
[2:02:11.560 --> 2:02:13.560]  I'm not mad at you because I do the same thing.
[2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:18.560]  I mean, I can't even get people arrested that clock me cold clock me at a bar on tape with and I get their name and everything.
[2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:26.560]  It's just like this is our problem is the reason why they get away with all this fake news is because nobody reports it.
[2:02:26.560 --> 2:02:28.560]  And quite frankly, again, like I get your campaigning.
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:31.560]  This is just like, you know, like just, you know, water off your shoulder.
[2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:38.560]  But at the same time, the left sits here and pretends like Trump supporters are out committing acts of violence, threatening people, bullying people.
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:41.560]  No, all the evidence is that that's the left. That's the Democrats.
[2:02:41.560 --> 2:02:44.560]  So so so now you're getting threatened.
[2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:46.560]  I mean, you should really make a big deal of this.
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:48.560]  You should put all the phone calls up.
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:56.560]  The leftists are now calling a woman running for Congress and giving her death threats.
[2:02:56.560 --> 2:02:59.560]  Saying that I need to go to a death camp.
[2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:03.560]  Yeah, I'm sure CNN will be knocking at your door for the exclusive.
[2:03:03.560 --> 2:03:05.560]  I'm sure they won't.
[2:03:05.560 --> 2:03:07.560]  They want they want to bury these things.
[2:03:07.560 --> 2:03:14.560]  And the funny thing is these are people that are like, you know, they're these are Antifa or these are sometimes the Bernie bros or people that claim that they're for peace.
[2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:16.560]  And yet they're utter fascists.
[2:03:16.560 --> 2:03:18.560]  These are violent people.
[2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:20.560]  And yet, you know, the left protects them.
[2:03:20.560 --> 2:03:26.560]  Well, if if there was any, you know, just imagine what happened with the Covington kids, right, the coming to kids and poor this guy.
[2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:30.560]  Thank God bless his heart that he's fighting this and and he's winning.
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:34.560]  But, you know, imagine if that was on the right, it just never gets covered.
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:35.560]  It never gets covered.
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:36.560]  So you're right.
[2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:37.560]  We do have to.
[2:03:37.560 --> 2:03:39.560]  We have to raise our voices about this.
[2:03:39.560 --> 2:03:42.560]  See, we're all the Covington kids.
[2:03:42.560 --> 2:03:44.560]  I mean, they got the lawsuit.
[2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:48.560]  They were the young kids demonized, obviously, attacked by the media falsely that day.
[2:03:48.560 --> 2:03:50.560]  But I mean, we're all Nicholas Salmon.
[2:03:50.560 --> 2:03:51.560]  We've all been lied about.
[2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:54.560]  We've all been attacked.
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:55.560]  Yeah, we have.
[2:03:55.560 --> 2:04:01.560]  And it's it's disgusting because we just sit here and we take it and we take it and we take it and we sometimes even get desensitized.
[2:04:01.560 --> 2:04:04.560]  Desensitized to it because it happens so frequently.
[2:04:04.560 --> 2:04:11.560]  We get assaulted so frequently, you know, on my election night when I was out an election night voting for Trump and we went to a party.
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:14.560]  It was 90 percent, 95 to 99 percent Democrat.
[2:04:14.560 --> 2:04:17.560]  And I was getting accosted during the night.
[2:04:17.560 --> 2:04:25.560]  You know, I had men coming up to me, men and women grabbing my, you know what, saying, oh, you like to have your, you know what, grab.
[2:04:25.560 --> 2:04:27.560]  That's why you're voting for Trump, huh?
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:29.560]  And I was reporting it to the bartender.
[2:04:29.560 --> 2:04:30.560]  They wouldn't kick them out.
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:31.560]  They wouldn't do anything.
[2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:32.560]  Oh, my gosh.
[2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:33.560]  People.
[2:04:33.560 --> 2:04:34.560]  Yes.
[2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:35.560]  Total foul foul and disgusting.
[2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:37.560]  Again, it all comes from lies from the Democrat.
[2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:41.560]  Deanna, how can people support your campaign so you can keep flying that banner?
[2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:42.560]  Yeah, keep flying the banner.
[2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:43.560]  Absolutely.
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:44.560]  I need your help.
[2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:46.560]  Go to my Twitter, Deanna for the number for Congress.
[2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:50.560]  You can check out all the videos from yesterday's fly and go to my website.
[2:04:50.560 --> 2:04:59.560]  Deanna F O R Congress dot com across the western world from high school to college sports to even the Olympics.
[2:04:59.560 --> 2:05:05.560]  Men, biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[2:05:05.560 --> 2:05:11.560]  This is men invading women's faces and bullying them and taking their rights away.
[2:05:11.560 --> 2:05:14.560]  All in the name of the liberalism and openness.
[2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:25.560]  And then every day I have stacks of news articles just like today UK team find under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings.
[2:05:25.560 --> 2:05:37.560]  UK mother spared jail for misgenerating trans woman ordered to pay 1000 pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[2:05:37.560 --> 2:05:39.560]  That's the thought police.
[2:05:39.560 --> 2:05:44.560]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail.
[2:05:44.560 --> 2:05:45.560]  This is tyranny.
[2:05:45.560 --> 2:05:51.560]  These people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific anti human takeover.
[2:05:51.560 --> 2:05:52.560]  Resist it.
[2:05:52.560 --> 2:06:18.560]  Speak out against it.
[2:06:18.560 --> 2:06:22.560]  All right, author and columnist Jeff.
[2:06:22.560 --> 2:06:23.560]  Jeff Nyquist joins me now.
[2:06:23.560 --> 2:06:30.560]  He's been covering the Corona virus and all of the developing and breaking news of which we have a lot right now.
[2:06:30.560 --> 2:06:35.560]  So I'm really not sure where to begin with Jeff.
[2:06:35.560 --> 2:06:41.560]  I almost kind of want to just lay out the latest and then get Jeff to connect the dots here.
[2:06:41.560 --> 2:06:45.560]  But there really is so much to look at here.
[2:06:45.560 --> 2:06:48.560]  We got it now pretty much going mainstream.
[2:06:48.560 --> 2:06:52.560]  And of course, Jeff wrote the article a couple weeks ago.
[2:06:52.560 --> 2:06:55.560]  Did China's plan to destroy the United States backfire?
[2:06:55.560 --> 2:07:00.560]  Of course, the man made bio weapon developed in Chinese was it meant for America?
[2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:04.560]  I think we may have some evidence of this and I don't even know if Jeff seen this yet.
[2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:08.560]  But this comes from the CBP dot gov official story.
[2:07:08.560 --> 2:07:15.560]  Dulles CBP intercepts dead birds in passenger baggage from China.
[2:07:15.560 --> 2:07:21.560]  Now there's no explanation as to what these dead birds would be doing except maybe as food.
[2:07:21.560 --> 2:07:22.560]  But you look at the dead birds.
[2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:24.560]  I don't know anybody that want to eat that.
[2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:26.560]  There's not even any meat on the bones.
[2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:28.560]  So that's suspicious.
[2:07:28.560 --> 2:07:32.560]  They're trying to find out people that have Corona in Hawaii.
[2:07:32.560 --> 2:07:33.560]  The origins of that.
[2:07:33.560 --> 2:07:39.560]  Obviously, Corona virus people that have it are being flown in detained.
[2:07:39.560 --> 2:07:44.560]  The numbers coming out of China are obviously not adding up.
[2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:51.560]  But then you have the World Health Organization teaming up with big tech to censor people from sharing news and stories and videos of the coronavirus.
[2:07:51.560 --> 2:07:58.560]  So, Jeff Nyquist, you wrote the article last month kind of seeing it before kind of like info wars.
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:02.560]  Like is this a man made bio weapon from China where they trying to attack America?
[2:08:02.560 --> 2:08:07.560]  What do you make with all the latest news and how do you connect all these dots?
[2:08:07.560 --> 2:08:17.560]  A lot of the hundreds of cities in China, the COVID-19 virus appears in Wuhan, which is the center of their viral biological warfare research.
[2:08:17.560 --> 2:08:19.560]  So what are the odds that it would happen?
[2:08:19.560 --> 2:08:28.560]  And by the way, if this was just something casually, you know, randomly mutating off of animals onto people, why would it have to be in China?
[2:08:28.560 --> 2:08:32.560]  China has a very sophisticated biological warfare program.
[2:08:32.560 --> 2:08:40.560]  And I brought up in the article of speech by General Qi Hao Chen, who happened to be the defense minister of China at the time.
[2:08:40.560 --> 2:08:47.560]  This speech was made about 17, 18 years ago to a select level of high party cadres.
[2:08:47.560 --> 2:08:50.560]  That's high level Communist Party leaders.
[2:08:50.560 --> 2:09:02.560]  And he was no ordinary general as the defense minister, he was also on the party military commission, which oversaw the entire Chinese military system from the point of view of the ruling Communist Party.
[2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:10.560]  And Qi's speech is quite long, quite technical, and I was able to verify this speech for my own information.
[2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:15.560]  I have over the years concentrated on Russia more than China.
[2:09:15.560 --> 2:09:21.560]  But one of my interests is the sociology of mass destruction weapons.
[2:09:21.560 --> 2:09:26.560]  Biological weapons are perhaps the most destructive weapons of human beings.
[2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:35.560]  And this speech by Qi Hao Chen, when it was translated by Epoch Times in 2005, at first I was kind of dismissive.
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:45.560]  But when I got into the details, I found a detail that a Russian defector who worked in China told me in 1999.
[2:09:45.560 --> 2:09:59.560]  Colonel Stanislav Lunev, who had defected from the Russian military, he had been the deputy head of the GRU in the United States at the time of his defection.
[2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:07.560]  Lunev told me about a meeting of the Russian generals in Moscow in early 1992.
[2:10:07.560 --> 2:10:13.560]  They had made a treaty with China for spying on the United States and sharing all intelligence.
[2:10:13.560 --> 2:10:19.560]  And the other thing they had done is that they had a war plan with China.
[2:10:19.560 --> 2:10:25.560]  And of course, the Soviet Union, this was after the collapse of the Soviet Union, which is quite remarkable.
[2:10:25.560 --> 2:10:29.560]  The general said our nuclear war plan against America is still on.
[2:10:29.560 --> 2:10:33.560]  Only we are not going to invade the lower 48 states. China is going to do it.
[2:10:33.560 --> 2:10:36.560]  We will invade Alaskan parts of Canada.
[2:10:36.560 --> 2:10:45.560]  And they talked about a division of North America between China and Russia, where Russia would get Alaskan parts of Canada.
[2:10:45.560 --> 2:10:49.560]  China would get the lower 48 states and I presume other parts of Canada.
[2:10:49.560 --> 2:10:53.560]  And other countries would be invited in for looting rights.
[2:10:53.560 --> 2:11:03.560]  And the thing that's significant is that in Qi's speech, which appeared in English in 2005, there is a passage.
[2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:11.560]  Qi refers to trading territory in the North with Russia to get the territory we need in the lower 48 states.
[2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:13.560]  Now, maybe I should explain.
[2:11:13.560 --> 2:11:21.560]  Qi begins the speech explaining China's problem over population, severe degradation of the environment from pollution.
[2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:25.560]  They need, excuse me, they need new land.
[2:11:25.560 --> 2:11:27.560]  Where are they going to get it?
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:33.560]  He said India, Southeast Asia, if we try to invade that land, the Americans will oppose us.
[2:11:33.560 --> 2:11:36.560]  Plus there's no room. It's already too populated.
[2:11:36.560 --> 2:11:39.560]  Well, they don't. They will depopulate.
[2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:43.560]  But he said that basically it's trivial compared to North America.
[2:11:43.560 --> 2:11:45.560]  That's the best land in the world.
[2:11:45.560 --> 2:11:50.560]  And he said if we have to fight the Americans anyway, we might as well make the land in North America.
[2:11:50.560 --> 2:11:53.560]  And so he said we need to clean up America. How to do it?
[2:11:53.560 --> 2:11:59.560]  He said a nuclear war won't do because if we have a nuclear war with America, China will be destroyed too.
[2:11:59.560 --> 2:12:05.560]  So what we need to do is a surprise, biological attack on America to clean America up.
[2:12:05.560 --> 2:12:07.560]  Those are the words that he uses.
[2:12:07.560 --> 2:12:13.560]  And he said that, you know, he says we communists, you know, we consider ourselves communist humanitarians.
[2:12:13.560 --> 2:12:16.560]  And it's tragic in America helped China in World War II.
[2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:25.560]  But it's them or us because they stand in our way and we have to build a second China on a new land to keep China from imploding.
[2:12:25.560 --> 2:12:33.560]  And he talked about this social implosion coming to China from overpopulation, a downturn in the economy, and environmental pollution.
[2:12:33.560 --> 2:12:41.560]  And he said if this social implosion happens, they will blame the CCP, the Chinese Communist ruling party, and we will all be hung as criminals.
[2:12:41.560 --> 2:12:47.560]  And he said, so we have to justify our rule of China by teaching the Chinese people how to go out.
[2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:50.560]  And biological weapons, he said, give us the best chance.
[2:12:50.560 --> 2:12:57.560]  And he mentioned them making already by that time a number of biological weapons.
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:13:05.560]  He talked about genetic engineering of weapons and genetic specific weapons to target specific races or groups of people.
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:10.560]  And although he said this technology might be, you know, 20, 30 years in the future might not be accessible.
[2:13:10.560 --> 2:13:13.560]  But this speech is quite sensational.
[2:13:13.560 --> 2:13:16.560]  And I believe it's absolutely authentic.
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:20.560]  The senior editors at epoch times, of course, they know where it comes from.
[2:13:20.560 --> 2:13:24.560]  They know how their paper acquired it from the original Chinese.
[2:13:24.560 --> 2:13:32.560]  They have, Josh Phillip has posted on Twitter the original Chinese text.
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:36.560]  If you go to Josh's Twitter feed, you'll find it there.
[2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:40.560]  This is some pretty next level information here.
[2:13:40.560 --> 2:13:49.560]  And I don't know how deep you want to go down the path you were on with, I mean, basically the means to a,
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:55.560]  what will really be, I guess, World War Three or World War Four, depend on which historian you talk to,
[2:13:55.560 --> 2:13:59.560]  with China and Russia invading the West.
[2:13:59.560 --> 2:14:05.560]  And I mean, I can't even tell you how much stuff was going through my head when you mentioned about Russia and China,
[2:14:05.560 --> 2:14:13.560]  it was my understanding that China would kind of come in under the guise of the UN.
[2:14:13.560 --> 2:14:18.560]  And those would really be Chinese troops, but under the guise of the UN so that Americans wouldn't freak out.
[2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:28.560]  But I guess the coronavirus, you know, it would have just ended up wiping out a large population basis.
[2:14:28.560 --> 2:14:31.560]  And I guess they would have figured it didn't matter who or what.
[2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:35.560]  As long as the UN was there to kind of mop it up, then China could come in.
[2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:38.560]  I mean, is that kind of your understanding in 30 seconds?
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:40.560]  Well, the virus is a precursor weapon.
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:43.560]  They would use multiple diseases.
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:52.560]  For example, the Russians had bubonic plague, anthrax, and smallpox as their weapon vectors that they manufactured large amounts.
[2:14:52.560 --> 2:14:57.560]  The Chinese, you know, the virus that only kills a small percentage of the population,
[2:14:57.560 --> 2:15:05.560]  but disables another large part, is a precursor for other diseases to be spread that will do more destruction.
[2:15:05.560 --> 2:15:07.560]  So not like a primer.
[2:15:07.560 --> 2:15:09.560]  Yes, like a primer, exactly.
[2:15:09.560 --> 2:15:13.560]  This is the kind of weapon you use to put people in bed.
[2:15:13.560 --> 2:15:17.560]  You know, a sick person requires other people to take care of them.
[2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:24.560]  If you've got a pandemic in which tens of millions of Americans are infected, and this is an illness that you could be hospitalized for three weeks,
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:30.560]  you've flooded all the hospitals already, you've infected medical staff, you've degraded systems,
[2:15:30.560 --> 2:15:36.560]  you've caused economic panic throughout the country because people, of course, will panic when something like this happens.
[2:15:36.560 --> 2:15:39.560]  It will disrupt many systems in the country.
[2:15:39.560 --> 2:15:41.560]  Then you hit them with something even more lethal.
[2:15:41.560 --> 2:15:43.560]  You hit them with, you know, weaponized people.
[2:15:43.560 --> 2:15:54.560]  All right, we've got to go to a break here, but let's actually focus on this and then the large chessboard when we come back with Jeff Nyquist.

[2:17:53.560 --> 2:17:56.560]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[2:17:56.560 --> 2:18:03.560]  Ultra-12 and vitamin mineral fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[2:18:03.560 --> 2:18:14.560]  Vitamin mineral fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:20.560]  Ultra-12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:22.560]  It is back in stock.
[2:18:22.560 --> 2:18:31.560]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[2:18:31.560 --> 2:18:38.560]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:46.560]  And of course, vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[2:18:46.560 --> 2:19:12.560]  And they're both back in stock 40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at m4store.com.
[2:19:16.560 --> 2:19:22.560]  Each of the Democrats saved the Second Amendment to defend the First Amendment in m4store.com and it looks like duct tape.
[2:19:22.560 --> 2:19:23.560]  It's just a regular sticker.
[2:19:23.560 --> 2:19:28.560]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[2:19:28.560 --> 2:19:30.560]  People say, why are you doing this? What's happening?
[2:19:30.560 --> 2:19:32.560]  When you go, well, we're being censored.
[2:19:32.560 --> 2:19:34.560]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[2:19:34.560 --> 2:19:37.560]  And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think because I've not launched this yet.
[2:19:37.560 --> 2:19:38.560]  It's brilliant.
[2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:45.560]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon.
[2:19:45.560 --> 2:19:48.560]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[2:19:48.560 --> 2:19:50.560]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[2:19:50.560 --> 2:19:52.560]  Silence.
[2:19:57.560 --> 2:20:00.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:00.560 --> 2:20:07.560]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let me just tell you this.
[2:20:07.560 --> 2:20:12.560]  You're getting next level information from Jeff Nyquist right now.
[2:20:12.560 --> 2:20:18.560]  And I mean, I'll be honest, I didn't really expect the interview to go this direction.
[2:20:18.560 --> 2:20:36.560]  I thought we'd more focus on the latest coronavirus news. That's kind of the backdrop, but I really want to continue to get into Jeff's mind here on what he was talking about with the land invasion by China and how they had reached closed-door agreements with Russia.
[2:20:36.560 --> 2:20:51.560]  And I'm sure other nations as well to launch such a thing. And there's little signs. I mean, there's more than just signs, quite frankly, that the public will probably never even be allowed to know.
[2:20:51.560 --> 2:21:09.560]  But there's little signs like the U.N. trying to move in and like what Jeff was talking about in the last segment with things that the Chinese have said.
[2:21:09.560 --> 2:21:20.560]  Now, let's bring it back, though, to the coronavirus. And again, the headline in the Epoch Times from Jeff two weeks ago did China's plan to destroy the United States backfire.
[2:21:20.560 --> 2:21:39.560]  So, Jeff, America was really at a point where I think that if all the wheels were in motion and they were just waiting for that last click to send this whole thing into motion and that last click was, let's just say, we can use it for an example, you may disagree.
[2:21:39.560 --> 2:21:45.560]  The last click was Hillary Clinton getting in office and then everything else just falls into place.
[2:21:45.560 --> 2:21:58.560]  Well, when you talk about the coronavirus being a Chinese plan to destroy the United States, so do you think that this was intended to be released in the U.S.?
[2:21:58.560 --> 2:22:19.560]  It's been planned for decades and somehow, someway, call it celestial intervention, call it incompetence. Basically, it got released on their own people and now they're scrambling around trying to contain it in China and they can't go through with their plans of releasing it here in the U.S.
[2:22:19.560 --> 2:22:23.560]  Jeff Nyquist, break it down.
[2:22:23.560 --> 2:22:44.560]  Well, we don't have proof as yet that it is a weapon, although if you look at the probabilities and you look at the evidence that it was manufactured, that it's not a naturally occurring microorganism, I think it's pretty safe to say that this is a weapon of some kind.
[2:22:44.560 --> 2:22:57.560]  And of course, they have many that they've been developing. China has been around the world stealing biological material, stealing information about genetic sequences of virulent microorganisms for years and years.
[2:22:57.560 --> 2:23:07.560]  Why? Because they want to find the best microorganisms and weaponize them. And that is part of a competent biological warfare program.
[2:23:07.560 --> 2:23:24.560]  If, as General Xi says, their objective is to clean up America, they have to hit us with a number of diseases that are going to treat the population down so low that we could not resist an invasion, that we could not mount a nuclear attack, that we would collapse, basically, from the illness.
[2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:41.560]  We see the mayhem in China from this thing right now. Imagine if you had a number of diseases at once, all the hospitals overwhelmed, all of the economic actors panicking, the political centers not knowing what to do or how to cope.
[2:23:41.560 --> 2:23:57.560]  This, as a beginning of an attack on the US, of course, we know from Russian literature on how to open nuclear war, they have something called the preparatory period in which they do diversionary attacks through intermediaries,
[2:23:57.560 --> 2:24:12.560]  where terror is controlled by intermediaries. This is called great terror. We're already in that phase of it. Great terror is diversionary because we're not focused on Russia and China, we're focused on Muslims and caves that supposedly are going to nuke us.
[2:24:12.560 --> 2:24:29.560]  When you had testimony from people like Colonel Stanislav Lunev saying, look, we searched for locations in the United States to stockpile nuclear and biological weapons in advance of a war so that, you know, that's arms caches, also arms caches for troops coming into the country.
[2:24:29.560 --> 2:24:47.560]  And of course, what he told me was the model for invasion is Hitler's invasion of Norway, where your troops enter as tourists or they're already here as students or they maybe cross over from Mexico. They go to the arms caches, they get their uniforms, they get their weapons or the nuclear weapons with which they can attack our cities.
[2:24:47.560 --> 2:25:01.560]  I think from my frustration from years of studying is that you, you know, we just trade with China. We just trade with Russia and these countries that mean to do us real serious harm. Their leaders do not their people, but their leaders.
[2:25:01.560 --> 2:25:06.560]  We trade with them and we open ourselves up. Do you realize that most of our vitamins are made in China?
[2:25:06.560 --> 2:25:20.560]  Oh, yeah, 95% of the source material and pharmaceuticals is from China. I mean, I don't know the percentage of the goods manufactured. I mean, everybody knows about that. And really at the end of the day, I mean, we can blame foreign policy.
[2:25:20.560 --> 2:25:32.560]  But at the end of the day, I mean, this comes down to business leaders that are using China for their cheap labor to in order to make a quick buck. But let me just kind of stop there for a second if you don't mind and just draw back because you brought up the Middle East.
[2:25:32.560 --> 2:25:48.560]  What is the connection there because I mean, I don't know your opinion on this matter, but to me, like you said, us being sitting here, distracted really focus on the Middle East saying that the boogeyman's hiding in a cave saying that the Muslims are our biggest enemy.
[2:25:48.560 --> 2:26:01.560]  To me, this is just bad foreign policy. And then bad actors get involved and take advantage of these wars, figure out how they can get rich off of these wars and engage in all sorts of nefarious activity.
[2:26:01.560 --> 2:26:17.560]  And so China has been watching this obviously Russia has been watching this. Did they view that as a that that that foreign policy call it whatever you want corrupt week, whatever. Did they view that as a weakness that they could kind of use as a distraction to come in and invade.
[2:26:17.560 --> 2:26:33.560]  Look, it's it's very bad to take the bait and be diverted by an enemy diversionary attack. You've heard of Alexander live in Echo. He was the Russian who was poisoned in London with polonium by the Russian special services died horribly of radiation poisoning.
[2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:49.560]  Named Putin is his assassin. We the British investigators traced the radiation on Lufthansa back to Moscow. They know this radioactive material came from Russia. They poison them. Why did they poison him in 2005, the year before live on.
[2:26:49.560 --> 2:27:03.560]  Now, let the neckle gave an interview. Now, he's a defector from the FSP. He worked under Putin when Putin was that of the FSP live in Echo said that I'm an also worry the head of al-Qaeda was trained in Russia.
[2:27:03.560 --> 2:27:13.560]  Why did he know he knew because he was responsible for maintaining the secrecy of I'm an also worry being in Russia in the mid 90s being trained by the Russian special services.
[2:27:13.560 --> 2:27:29.560]  The fact is that that that live in Echo claimed that al-Qaeda was this kind of diversionary attack that al-Qaeda that many of the leaders in al-Qaeda were Russian agents and that Russia was using this terrorism as a way to attack the West.
[2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:47.560]  I've had I've developed other sources. Victor Suvorov, another GRU defector wrote about this in a book called Spetsnaz was published in the UK in 1987 in a chapter called Spetsnaz's First World War. He talked about this great terror in which the West would seemingly be attacked by terrorist forces.
[2:27:47.560 --> 2:28:10.560]  But that these forces would be controlled by Russia through intermediaries with no, you know, direct connection to Moscow that you could trace. All of these things came to pass. And the reason it's called a preparatory period is that they have to divert our intelligence resources and our military resources to actors and regions that are not them.
[2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:26.560]  So that they can build up their weapons, which they've been doing, by the way, since 9-11. Russia and China have gotten very strong so that the balance of power is tipped. Maybe you saw the article put out about the Russian and Chinese submarines that the Navy saying, well, we don't know in a war we could control.
[2:28:26.560 --> 2:28:47.560]  Well, here, pause it right there because we're about to go to a break. But I want to use this opportunity to say something that's so important or so important for President Trump in America right now. This is why we need to get out of the Middle East, folks, because other countries having international meetings use that to make, to say, look at all the harm they're doing in the Middle East.
[2:28:47.560 --> 2:28:52.560]  We have to do something about it. I mean, folks, we got to get out of the damn Middle East. It's killing us.
[2:28:52.560 --> 2:29:07.560]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[2:29:07.560 --> 2:29:27.560]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the national treatment advisors. They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[2:29:27.560 --> 2:29:39.560]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered. Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse. Get clean. Call now and learn more.
[2:29:39.560 --> 2:29:53.560]  800-506-6740. 800-506-6740. That's 800-506-6740.
[2:29:53.560 --> 2:30:03.560]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half. And I told Alex. I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[2:30:03.560 --> 2:30:14.560]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me? You got to get up there and tell people. So here I am telling people, super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[2:30:14.560 --> 2:30:31.560]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[2:30:31.560 --> 2:30:42.560]  It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[2:30:42.560 --> 2:30:45.560]  Because I like the way it feels.
[2:30:55.560 --> 2:31:05.560]  Alright, folks, here's the bad news. We've already sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle with the patented nano tech silver that's documented to knock out viruses and bacteria unlike anything else.
[2:31:05.560 --> 2:31:18.560]  But we do still have in the three ounce and the one ounce for limited time. The good news is we have the super blue toothpaste and the super silver toothpaste, both that have the nano silver in them as well.
[2:31:18.560 --> 2:31:24.560]  The super blue has tea tree that's also antiviral and antibacterial and high quality iodine.
[2:31:24.560 --> 2:31:35.560]  And then, of course, the whitening has the nano silver, but on top of that, it has the above sea coral calcium that remeliorizes the teeth. And so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find. Period.
[2:31:35.560 --> 2:31:47.560]  It has the nano silver and we still have supplies of it, though it'll sell out at current rates in about two weeks. But despite that, I'm keeping it at sale at 50% off so everybody can protect themselves with this high quality product.
[2:31:47.560 --> 2:31:55.560]  You've never used it before. Get yours today infowarstore.com infowarstore.com.
[2:31:55.560 --> 2:32:04.560]  We know that the globalists are in trouble. Humanities waking up to their tyranny, how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post human world.
[2:32:04.560 --> 2:32:21.560]  But we know they're going to strike back. And the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the west and collapse our social services in a giant clowered and pivot program.
[2:32:21.560 --> 2:32:38.560]  The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government inner coronavirus. This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word because people are waking up like never before.
[2:32:38.560 --> 2:32:53.560]  But this fight against tyranny is neck and neck so spread the word about band.video and infowarstore.com.
[2:33:08.560 --> 2:33:23.560]  You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he. It's Alex Jones. And now your host Owen Troyer.
[2:33:23.560 --> 2:33:41.560]  Alright we brought Jeff Nyquist on his story from the epoch times. Did China's plan to destroy the U.S. backfire ended up being next week's news today so we bring him on for that. It's kind of diverted from the coronavirus news into a foreign policy thing but how it ties into the coronavirus.
[2:33:41.560 --> 2:33:57.560]  Could it be a biological weapon that was intended for the United States by China? We're kind of laying that backdrop. So let's kind of go back into that foreign policy discussion and then just get your final thoughts and comments on the coronavirus before we let you go.
[2:33:57.560 --> 2:34:24.560]  But I'll just say this. I don't necessarily trust British intelligence when it comes to the polonium poisoning of that individual but I do know this. The Chinese have been looking at America as weak for a while and obviously with your intelligence and your research had plans to even come in and invade and take it down.
[2:34:24.560 --> 2:34:43.560]  The Middle East foreign policy has been one giant one big giant hoax is the best way I could describe it. A giant boondoggle. Russia sees that doesn't like it. And so they just want to see it end. I don't even think politically they have any interest between the United States and China.
[2:34:43.560 --> 2:34:59.560]  They just want to see the corruption in the Middle East and and with all the land and resources they have are just kind of sitting there like Cinderella waiting for whoever to put the glass slipper on their feet. And now with Trump Russia is maybe looking at the United States instead of China.
[2:34:59.560 --> 2:35:16.560]  So so that's kind of the foreign policy backdrop that I see going on that would lead to us talking about China creating a bio weapon to be released in the United States which is coronavirus which did it get accidentally released in China or how did that go down.
[2:35:16.560 --> 2:35:24.560]  So just just kind of respond to that with the foreign policy backdrop and then and then bring it back to the coronavirus.
[2:35:24.560 --> 2:35:29.560]  Well China is a communist country. The ruling ideology of China is communism.
[2:35:29.560 --> 2:35:44.560]  Mao Zedong is the chief ideologist. And as Bill Gertz reported in his latest book deceiving the sky no other Chinese leader since Mao has embraced the rigid orthodox communist ideology more than Xi Xi Jinping.
[2:35:44.560 --> 2:35:57.560]  So we should not be fooled by this slick capitalist exterior of communist China. It's a communist country. We also should not be fooled by Putin's act.
[2:35:57.560 --> 2:36:09.560]  The collapse of the Soviet Union was not what it appeared to be. Russia the the communist apparatchiks and the nomenclature remained in power in Russia despite everything that happened.
[2:36:09.560 --> 2:36:18.560]  And they've been trying to put the Soviet Union back together again ever since their formation of an alliance with communist China is not the only communist alliance they have.
[2:36:18.560 --> 2:36:27.560]  There are military advisors in communist North Korea. The Russians are building bases in communist Nicaragua under Daniel Ortega. They're allied with Cuba.
[2:36:27.560 --> 2:36:33.560]  There are Russian and Chinese troops in Venezuela right now. Why do you think they're there?
[2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:44.560]  Why is Russia helping all the communist countries in South Sahara, Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa? Why are they arming South Africa, which is ruled by the ANC, which is a communist front?
[2:36:44.560 --> 2:36:53.560]  The fact of the matter is that communism and the communist bloc still exists. It was not destroyed in 1991. The fall of the Berlin Wall was only a setback.
[2:36:53.560 --> 2:36:59.560]  It wasn't the destruction of communism. And they have nuclear weapons. Right now they have more nuclear weapons than they do.
[2:36:59.560 --> 2:37:09.560]  China and Russia are big powers with big abilities to destroy other countries. In fact, only China and Russia have the ability to destroy the United States.
[2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:19.560]  Which, by the way, they really think they could win, I think, in a war. I think that Trump trying to re-bolster the military and give it the morale is his response to that.
[2:37:19.560 --> 2:37:31.560]  But I want to just take you back for a second because you're saying you think the matchup with China and Russia is there from the beginning and it has communist ties.
[2:37:31.560 --> 2:37:41.560]  As where I'm saying, I look at Russia as just a nation still searching for its role in the world order, still trying to figure out its role in the world order coming out of communism.
[2:37:41.560 --> 2:37:48.560]  And you're saying no, the communists in Russia are no doubly teamed up with China.
[2:37:48.560 --> 2:37:53.560]  Two and a half years ago was the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
[2:37:53.560 --> 2:38:06.560]  At that time, Russia hosted at Sochi the World Conference of Youth and Students, which is a communist organization which has been hosted in different communist countries since World War II.
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:17.560]  And Putin was the keynote speaker. You can find this speech online. Putin says that he believes in them. They are the future.
[2:38:17.560 --> 2:38:25.560]  He is behind them. These are communists. They're all waving communist flags, wearing communist t-shirts.
[2:38:25.560 --> 2:38:33.560]  This is a massive communist youth organization from all around the world. This is the speech that Putin made.
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:42.560]  Putin has told at meetings with journalists that he never got rid of his party card, that he wasn't a communist because he had to be to be in the KGB.
[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:47.560]  He has said publicly that he was a communist because he likes communist ideas.
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:55.560]  The fact of the matter is that Putin does the same thing Stalin did. Stalin famously wrote a horse in two directions.
[2:38:55.560 --> 2:39:05.560]  That is, he could appear to be a nationalist, a Russian nationalist, when he had to be during the Great Patriotic War, but he was also a communist.
[2:39:05.560 --> 2:39:16.560]  And when in 1943 the Soviet Union dissolved the common term, it was a deception, just like when they supposedly dissolved it after the fall of the Soviet Union.
[2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:23.560]  They are still supporting all around the world communist regimes. There are still communist takeovers and revolutions happening.
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:29.560]  More recently, Nepal and Nicaragua, the communists have taken over in those countries. We know about Venezuela.
[2:39:29.560 --> 2:39:37.560]  There are different African countries. The Congo had its revolution in the late 90s. What do you mean communism is dead? Who won the Angolan Civil War?
[2:39:37.560 --> 2:39:44.560]  I want to give you time to finish up on the coronavirus. Just to put it out there. I think this is a good debate. Maybe we could even have it.
[2:39:44.560 --> 2:39:49.560]  I just disagree with you on Russia's stance. I just think Russia is searching for identity.
[2:39:49.560 --> 2:39:59.560]  And I think, quite frankly, the biggest drive of where they were going was because of the Middle East foreign policy the United States now corrupt that was.
[2:39:59.560 --> 2:40:05.560]  And I think they'd be open minded to maybe go a different way if we could clean that up. But that's my opinion. Your research tells you something differently.
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:16.560]  But in the last two minutes here, just what do you think was behind the coronavirus? Where do you think it goes next? And what do you think the audience needs to know?
[2:40:16.560 --> 2:40:26.560]  Well, the thing to watch for already in the Russian press, there are accusations that this is a biological weapon made by us put against China.
[2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:36.560]  China is hinted at this when the Chinese Foundation of Science and Technology put out a piece saying that this virus is specifically targeted at Asians.
[2:40:36.560 --> 2:40:52.560]  So we have to watch to see if this propaganda is amplified because this is very dangerous pre-war propaganda. Blaming the United States for attacking China with a biological weapon would be a justification for them actually using some of the more nasty stuff on us.
[2:40:52.560 --> 2:41:01.560]  Especially once we get hit by the coronavirus because it's coming to us. This thing is as contagious as the common cold. It is not going to be contained here.
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:13.560]  It is going to break out for every person that we know has it. There's probably three to four people walking around spreading it. People can be asymptomatic for up to 24 days they're saying now.
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:19.560]  There's no way you can contain something like this. So we are going to have this virus too. It's going to be here.
[2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:32.560]  Well and it already is here. So I mean that's already reported. I mean it's already here. In fact they're looking for somebody in Hawaii who they think may have it. So it's already floating around here.
[2:41:32.560 --> 2:41:43.560]  But I mean as far as evidence is concerned I've seen none that show it was made in the US or came from the US.
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:54.560]  Yeah I mean people are going to. We're in a propaganda war. We've been in an information war with China and Russia for decades and decades.
[2:41:54.560 --> 2:42:05.560]  A lot of the negative messages that appear in our press about ourselves come from their agent networks. Influence operations are a very big part of what they do.
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:16.560]  Trying to get us to turn on ourselves to divide and conquer us to try to split us. This is typical tactics by the communists. I mean it's a very old game.
[2:42:16.560 --> 2:42:28.560]  And we have to be aware that some of the messages coming through our own newspapers and radio and television are coming from people who are bought and paid for by China and or Russia.
[2:42:28.560 --> 2:42:36.560]  Yeah. No 100 percent. And then that's been proven in cases like Diane Feinstein. All right. Jeff Nyquist. Thank you so much. You'll have to come on again.
[2:42:36.560 --> 2:42:44.560]  And maybe even with Alex to talk about this stuff. Jeff Nyquist. Thank you so much. Thank you. And you know there's like he said there's so much disinformation.
[2:42:44.560 --> 2:42:53.560]  I mean Russia has their fake news too. Just like the United States has their fake news and we're just trying to figure out but the next couple weeks will tell us what's going on with coronavirus.
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:43:02.560]  Real stuff man. We're talking about the real deal here. And I love Trump all day long. But man I tell you he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over everybody.
[2:43:02.560 --> 2:43:09.560]  I mean I've got a problem. And we'll just take the Trump rallies over. That said about two months ago I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[2:43:09.560 --> 2:43:18.560]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers. Twenty different stickers impeach the Democrats. Save the Second Amendment. Defend the First Amendment.
[2:43:18.560 --> 2:43:26.560]  Infowars.com. And it looks like duct tape. It's just a regular sticker. You put it over your mouth. You go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[2:43:26.560 --> 2:43:32.560]  People say why are you doing this? What's happening? Will you go well? We're being censored. You know Trump won't do anything about it.
[2:43:32.560 --> 2:43:43.560]  And Dr. Pachennick let me just ask you what you think because I've not launched this yet. It's brilliant. You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon.
[2:43:43.560 --> 2:43:52.560]  You have the loudest sound of all silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people? Silence.
[2:43:52.560 --> 2:44:01.560]  I have confirmed with high level sources that President Trump is intending to either pardon Roger Stone after his sentencing or give him clemency.
[2:44:01.560 --> 2:44:08.560]  Saying the conviction stands but you now basically don't go to jail. Either way this is incredibly good news.
[2:44:08.560 --> 2:44:16.560]  But let's not forget Julian Assange. That's one of the biggest black marks on Trump is that he famously said, I don't know who got the emails.
[2:44:16.560 --> 2:44:26.560]  I don't know where they came from. The Russians, a fat dude in his mom's basement, whoever's got them, release them. It's about Hillary committing a crime, not who has the emails don't change the subject.
[2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:34.560]  Well, Julian Assange undoubtedly took Trump over the top. The WikiLeaks exposed the deep state. The man is a hero. Daniel Ellsberg was a hero.
[2:44:34.560 --> 2:44:40.560]  Assange is even a bigger hero and he's rotting in solitary confinement and at court hearings can barely talk.
[2:44:40.560 --> 2:44:46.560]  President Trump do the right thing and asked the British to release Julian Assange and give him a medal.
[2:44:46.560 --> 2:44:53.560]  President Trump, you must release Julian Assange. Free Julian Assange. Free Julian Assange.

[2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:08.560]  The music is so good.
[2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:33.560]  It's tough for me to turn off classical music and rock music, really. I need music with instruments, actually.
[2:47:33.560 --> 2:47:43.560]  But it's almost kind of perfect, like we're sitting here talking about, you know, deadly outbreak, bile weapons, like, why not, you know, have that in the background.
[2:47:43.560 --> 2:47:45.560]  Makes you feel good, right?
[2:47:45.560 --> 2:47:51.560]  I got some other news to get to before I'm going to hand it over to Gerald Salenty.
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:48:03.560]  With my discussion, which really turned into a foreign policy discussion, I think more than anything with Jeff Nyquist, and then just thinking about it during the segments, talking about it with some of the crew here during the break.
[2:48:03.560 --> 2:48:16.560]  It is so important geopolitically. It cannot be understated. It's long overdue. It is so important geopolitically for the United States to get out of the Middle East, folks.
[2:48:16.560 --> 2:48:25.560]  And I'm not going to sit here and act like I know what that means or have the answers, but we have to make that a priority now.
[2:48:25.560 --> 2:48:34.560]  Trump needs to make that a priority now, and he's hinted at it. We've seen some signs of it. We are withdrawing troops. It's not enough.
[2:48:34.560 --> 2:48:50.560]  And you have to understand. Again, I'm not justifying it. I'm just telling you how the grandmaster stink, how the people moving the ponds and the knights and the rooks and the bishops on the chessboard are thinking.
[2:48:50.560 --> 2:49:02.560]  If you're Russia and you've got all this land in these resources and you're kind of still figuring out your identity in the world, what you are, who you are.
[2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:24.560]  I don't think it comes down to communism or capitalism. I think it comes down to who are my allies who have been my allies and what moves can I make or be involved in that give me a better place in the world order and helps my allies.
[2:49:24.560 --> 2:49:35.560]  If you're Russia and you're sitting here looking at the two world superpowers, America and China. Well, for the last couple decades, the answer has been obvious for Russia.
[2:49:35.560 --> 2:49:41.560]  It's been China, and they have been plotting with China, and there have been plans for invasion.
[2:49:41.560 --> 2:49:49.560]  But see, that's why, I mean, folks, it's literally unbelievable. If Hillary Clinton would have won, the doors would have been wide open.
[2:49:49.560 --> 2:50:00.560]  It's going to be invaded by China by now. Seriously. That's how close it was. That's probably why she's trying to get back in.
[2:50:00.560 --> 2:50:14.560]  So we have to get the troops out of the Middle East because you've got to understand, if you're Russia or any other country that really doesn't have a say in the world order,
[2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:25.560]  folks, the invasion of the Middle East by the United States was based off lies. Okay, the lies of 9-11 and the lies of weapons of mass destruction,
[2:50:25.560 --> 2:50:36.560]  the framing of Osama bin Laden as a CIA asset, and then just the continuance of that in the Obama years for whatever reason, even though he claimed he was against it.
[2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:45.560]  That's been, I mean, you can sit here and talk about China all day long. China is no saint, believe me.
[2:50:45.560 --> 2:50:57.560]  But my point is, if you're Russia, with all the doings of the United States and the Middle East, you're going to side with China on the international scale.
[2:50:57.560 --> 2:51:10.560]  It makes more sense for you. Now, if the United States changes its foreign policy, doesn't want to bomb and invade the Middle East all the time,
[2:51:10.560 --> 2:51:19.560]  all of a sudden, now Russia, it makes more sense for them to be allied with the United States instead of the Communist Chinese.
[2:51:19.560 --> 2:51:28.560]  So that is, of course, if they don't want to fall back into the destructive pattern of communism, which they're fighting out of.
[2:51:28.560 --> 2:51:34.560]  So this is all going on. This is all key. And this is the real game, folks.
[2:51:34.560 --> 2:51:38.560]  All right, now I got other news and stuff I got to get to, including a Michael Bloomberg video.
[2:51:38.560 --> 2:51:54.560]  And look, I'm telling you, this Nevada caucus is going to be very telling as far as is Bloomberg going to get the nominee or are the Democrats going to fight him on it.
[2:51:54.560 --> 2:51:59.560]  And having Hillary Clinton's name involved with Bloomberg now is an interesting plot twist.
[2:51:59.560 --> 2:52:10.560]  We knew Hillary Clinton would get involved in some way, shape or form, but Democrat candidates are clamoring for Bloomberg to be on the debate stage with him.
[2:52:10.560 --> 2:52:18.560]  Why? Well, because Bloomberg has said some pretty, if you're a Democrat, bad things in the past that they love to use against you,
[2:52:18.560 --> 2:52:27.560]  including this video that has just surfaced, Bloomberg bashes farmers, blue collar workers as primitive idiots. Here's the tape.
[2:52:27.560 --> 2:52:34.560]  And we could teach processes. I could teach anybody, even people in this room, so no offense intended, to be a farmer.
[2:52:34.560 --> 2:52:39.560]  It's a process. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn.
[2:52:39.560 --> 2:52:44.560]  Then we had 300. You could learn that. Then you have 300 years of the industrial society.
[2:52:44.560 --> 2:52:50.560]  You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow, and you can have a job.
[2:52:50.560 --> 2:52:59.560]  And we created a lot of jobs. 1.98% of the world worked in agriculture today. It's 2% in the United States.
[2:52:59.560 --> 2:53:12.560]  Now comes the information economy. And the information economy is fundamentally different because it's built around replacing people with technology.
[2:53:12.560 --> 2:53:23.560]  And the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze. And that is a whole degree level different.
[2:53:23.560 --> 2:53:30.560]  You have to have a different skill set. You have to have a lot more gray map.
[2:53:30.560 --> 2:53:36.560]  So he's had that video and some other videos to stop and frisk. So here's the deal.
[2:53:36.560 --> 2:53:41.560]  The Democrats basically are going to turn on to Bloomberg what they were never able to get on Trump.
[2:53:41.560 --> 2:53:45.560]  He's going to end up being the racist. He's going to end up being all these things.
[2:53:45.560 --> 2:53:51.560]  And he's probably going to stand there and fight them. But it's going to be interesting to see this infighting go down inside the Democrat Party.
[2:53:51.560 --> 2:53:56.560]  And now they're going to start aiming at Bloomberg. But I'm telling you right now.
[2:53:56.560 --> 2:54:02.560]  Bloomberg is now the odds on favorite to get the Democrat nomination.
[2:54:02.560 --> 2:54:07.560]  And I don't think all the attacks on him are going to work, folks.
[2:54:07.560 --> 2:54:11.560]  I really don't. They didn't work against Trump.
[2:54:11.560 --> 2:54:19.560]  I don't think they're going to work against Bloomberg because when you get down to it, when you get on that debate stage and when you look at the individuals and their resumes,
[2:54:19.560 --> 2:54:25.560]  Bloomberg is going to mop the floor with me.
[2:54:25.560 --> 2:54:32.560]  Amy Klobacher puffing herself up on on national news saying she can't wait to get at Bloomberg on a stage.
[2:54:32.560 --> 2:54:37.560]  No offense, sweetheart, but Bloomberg is a mountain compared to you.
[2:54:37.560 --> 2:54:41.560]  You're like a molehill.
[2:54:41.560 --> 2:54:45.560]  This is going to be interesting. And I'm telling you, Hillary getting her hands in there. She sees the tea leaves.
[2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:48.560]  She thinks Bloomberg is number one, too.
[2:54:48.560 --> 2:54:56.560]  So go ahead. They're going to bring up all the crap from Bloomberg's past and call him racist and this and homophobic and that and this and that.
[2:54:56.560 --> 2:55:00.560]  It's not going to matter. It will not matter, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:55:00.560 --> 2:55:07.560]  What will matter is when he gets on the debate stage, it'll be the number one rated debate.
[2:55:07.560 --> 2:55:10.560]  The media will see that and run with it.
[2:55:10.560 --> 2:55:20.560]  The Democrats will see that and either choose to run with it or choose to try and throw Bloomberg under the bus like they've done Sanders and then go to a brokered convention.
[2:55:20.560 --> 2:55:26.560]  And that will be probably at the measurement of they don't want Hillary Clinton involved, but I don't think any of it's going to matter.
[2:55:26.560 --> 2:55:31.560]  Bloomberg has the cash. Bloomberg has the pedigree.
[2:55:31.560 --> 2:55:34.560]  And Bloomberg has the stage presence.
[2:55:34.560 --> 2:55:38.560]  And he is now the front runner, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:55:38.560 --> 2:55:49.560]  Yeah, Bernie Sanders is still technically the front runner, but you add in some of the variables like the Democrats not wanting him and and imagine Bernie in the debate.
[2:55:49.560 --> 2:55:54.560]  It's just not going to be good when he actually has to debate somebody that's had success in the world.
[2:55:54.560 --> 2:55:57.560]  He's actually worked.
[2:55:57.560 --> 2:56:00.560]  It's not going to be pretty for Bernie.
[2:56:00.560 --> 2:56:08.560]  But you can see what's going on, whether contrived or not, all the Democrat candidates are now aimed at Bloomberg.
[2:56:08.560 --> 2:56:13.560]  Bloomberg is outspending all of them except Tom Steyer, but he's really irrelevant anyway.
[2:56:13.560 --> 2:56:19.560]  It's almost like Tom is trying to make amends for all the global warming he thinks he caused or something.
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:24.560]  But so so that's what's about to go down in the Democrat debate.
[2:56:24.560 --> 2:56:28.560]  A couple of the headlines before we hand it off to J.L. Saleni in the next segment.
[2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:31.560]  Virginia government rejects gun ban after Democrats defect.
[2:56:31.560 --> 2:56:39.560]  So they've now delayed that bill to ban ARs and other things to next year.
[2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:41.560]  So that did not go through.
[2:56:41.560 --> 2:56:43.560]  They'll delay it till next year.
[2:56:43.560 --> 2:56:49.560]  It's rare step of allowing elusive just Lane Maxwell to be served with lawsuit by email.
[2:56:49.560 --> 2:56:51.560]  So she is hiding.
[2:56:51.560 --> 2:56:53.560]  She is hiding, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:56:53.560 --> 2:57:04.560]  And they're just looking for so they can bring her in and ask her questions about this industrial level sex trafficking ring that she was involved with.
[2:57:04.560 --> 2:57:07.560]  All right, I'm going to hand it over to J.L. Saleni when I come back.
[2:57:07.560 --> 2:57:13.560]  I forgot to say, though, one of my favorite supplements at info store.com is vitamin mineral fusion.
[2:57:13.560 --> 2:57:15.560]  I drink it every morning, folks.
[2:57:15.560 --> 2:57:20.560]  Look, you're not probably getting all the vitamins and everything you need in your diet.
[2:57:20.560 --> 2:57:25.560]  So if you drink the vitamin mineral fusion every morning, which I do, you just knock it out.
[2:57:25.560 --> 2:57:30.560]  You get the vitamin A, B, C, D. I mean, it's just it's all in there.
[2:57:30.560 --> 2:57:31.560]  It's at info store.com.
[2:57:31.560 --> 2:57:32.560]  It's back in stock.
[2:57:32.560 --> 2:57:38.560]  It's on sale with vitamin B 12 makes a great drink to start your morning with.
[2:57:38.560 --> 2:57:42.560]  I'm telling you, vitamin mineral fusion vitamin B 12 from info store.com every morning.
[2:57:42.560 --> 2:57:44.560]  I love watching David night in the morning.
[2:57:44.560 --> 2:57:46.560]  I love tuning in to oh, and Troyer.
[2:57:46.560 --> 2:57:48.560]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[2:57:48.560 --> 2:57:55.560]  But I'll be honest with you, we run during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the edge.
[2:57:55.560 --> 2:57:57.560]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad.
[2:57:57.560 --> 2:57:58.560]  I don't want to hear it.
[2:57:58.560 --> 2:58:00.560]  But here's the bottom line.
[2:58:00.560 --> 2:58:03.560]  We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face.
[2:58:03.560 --> 2:58:04.560]  The globalists not contract.
[2:58:04.560 --> 2:58:05.560]  I don't want them to win.
[2:58:05.560 --> 2:58:08.560]  So listen, you've got this guarantee for me.
[2:58:08.560 --> 2:58:09.560]  We sell enough product.
[2:58:09.560 --> 2:58:14.560]  We'll have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists run for their money.
[2:58:14.560 --> 2:58:19.560]  But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus X2.
[2:58:19.560 --> 2:58:20.560]  These will change your life.
[2:58:20.560 --> 2:58:21.560]  Go check out the tumor products.
[2:58:21.560 --> 2:58:23.560]  Check out the water filtration air filtration.
[2:58:23.560 --> 2:58:24.560]  Check it all out.
[2:58:24.560 --> 2:58:28.560]  Whatever you do, take action and know be part of the second American Revolution.
[2:58:28.560 --> 2:58:29.560]  Be part of question.
[2:58:29.560 --> 2:58:31.560]  Be part of the globalist and get great products at the same time.
[2:58:31.560 --> 2:58:33.560]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[2:58:33.560 --> 2:58:35.560]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[2:58:35.560 --> 2:59:04.560]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.

[2:59:28.560 --> 2:59:36.560]  And of course, vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[2:59:36.560 --> 3:00:02.560]  And they're both back in stock 40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at Infowarsstore.com.
[3:00:02.560 --> 3:00:09.560]  All right, I'm going to hand it over to Gerald Salenti.
[3:00:09.560 --> 3:00:12.560]  I'm going to go stomp some heads, listen to Ludacris.
[3:00:12.560 --> 3:00:13.560]  No, I'm just kidding.
[3:00:13.560 --> 3:00:14.560]  I'm not a violent person.
[3:00:14.560 --> 3:00:15.560]  Okay, relax.
[3:00:15.560 --> 3:00:18.560]  It's just to me, how can you not just work?
[3:00:18.560 --> 3:00:19.560]  Crush them.
[3:00:19.560 --> 3:00:22.560]  All right, let's go.
[3:00:22.560 --> 3:00:25.560]  Just let's laugh at the left real quick.
[3:00:25.560 --> 3:00:29.560]  These liberals that are just so fake, they'll fall for anything.
[3:00:29.560 --> 3:00:34.560]  You know, you write, hey, gullible in the sky, the average double says, where, what?
[3:00:34.560 --> 3:00:38.560]  They fell for Michael Avenetti's bull crap.
[3:00:38.560 --> 3:00:44.560]  I mean, folks, I mean, they literally fell head over heels for Michael Avenetti's bull crap.
[3:00:44.560 --> 3:00:53.560]  Here's a compilation of the Democrats praising the now, well, soon to be criminal Michael Avenetti.
[3:00:53.560 --> 3:00:56.560]  He's Donald Trump's worst nightmare, Michael Avenetti.
[3:00:56.560 --> 3:00:58.560]  Joining us once again is Michael Avenatti.
[3:00:58.560 --> 3:00:59.560]  Let's bring in Michael Avenatti.
[3:00:59.560 --> 3:01:00.560]  Michael Avenatti.
[3:01:00.560 --> 3:01:01.560]  Michael Avenatti.
[3:01:01.560 --> 3:01:02.560]  Michael Avenatti, thank you very much.
[3:01:02.560 --> 3:01:04.560]  He's out there saving the country.
[3:01:04.560 --> 3:01:06.560]  God Meacham says he may be the savior of the Republic.
[3:01:06.560 --> 3:01:08.560]  You are something of a folk hero now.
[3:01:08.560 --> 3:01:10.560]  I owe Michael Avenatti an apology.
[3:01:10.560 --> 3:01:12.560]  I've been saying enough already, Michael.
[3:01:12.560 --> 3:01:13.560]  I've seen you everywhere.
[3:01:13.560 --> 3:01:14.560]  What do you have left to say?
[3:01:14.560 --> 3:01:15.560]  I was wrong, brother.
[3:01:15.560 --> 3:01:17.560]  You have a lot to say.
[3:01:17.560 --> 3:01:20.560]  I am just dying to hear what you think.
[3:01:20.560 --> 3:01:21.560]  Because people all like you.
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:23.560]  I'm the only person right here.
[3:01:23.560 --> 3:01:26.560]  Donald Trump fears more than Robert Miller.
[3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:30.560]  We think you guys are the tip of the spear that's going to take down Donald Trump.
[3:01:30.560 --> 3:01:32.560]  Michael Avenatti's a beast.
[3:01:32.560 --> 3:01:33.560]  Okay, that's true.
[3:01:33.560 --> 3:01:34.560]  And he's a beast.
[3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:35.560]  He's a beast.
[3:01:35.560 --> 3:01:38.560]  I hand it to her and I hand it to Michael Avenatti.
[3:01:38.560 --> 3:01:40.560]  But he has a bigger calling here.
[3:01:40.560 --> 3:01:43.560]  That being a lawyer is minimal compared to what he's doing.
[3:01:43.560 --> 3:01:48.560]  No one has talked tougher directly to Donald Trump on TV than Michael Avenatti.
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:01:51.560]  And Donald Trump is afraid to mention his name.
[3:01:51.560 --> 3:01:52.560]  That's fascinating.
[3:01:52.560 --> 3:01:55.560]  Donald Trump is terrified of Michael Avenatti.
[3:01:55.560 --> 3:01:58.560]  It gets Trump a run for his money than anybody else, Michael Avenatti.
[3:01:58.560 --> 3:02:01.560]  An existential threat to the Trump presidency.
[3:02:01.560 --> 3:02:03.560]  The Democrats could learn something for you.
[3:02:03.560 --> 3:02:05.560]  You are messed with Trump a lot more than they are.
[3:02:05.560 --> 3:02:11.560]  He has no doubt created sheer panic in Donald Trump's very fragile mind.
[3:02:11.560 --> 3:02:15.560]  Michael Avenatti is laying down the law as guest co-hosts.
[3:02:15.560 --> 3:02:18.560]  And is he really thinking about running for president?
[3:02:18.560 --> 3:02:23.560]  One reason why I'm taking you seriously as a contender is because of your presence on cable news.
[3:02:23.560 --> 3:02:26.560]  You look at the field of Democrats right now and Avenatti is the one who stands out.
[3:02:26.560 --> 3:02:32.560]  If they decide they value a fighter most, people would be foolish to underestimate Michael Avenatti.
[3:02:32.560 --> 3:02:34.560]  I have always said that they need a fighter.
[3:02:34.560 --> 3:02:36.560]  Look, I mean, we're going to continue to use the media.
[3:02:36.560 --> 3:02:38.560]  I think we've used it with great success.
[3:02:38.560 --> 3:02:40.560]  Yeah, you have, buddy.
[3:02:40.560 --> 3:02:42.560]  Yeah, you have.
[3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:50.560]  Well, I don't know what the punishment is for all the counts of extortion
[3:02:50.560 --> 3:02:53.560]  that Michael Avenatti is now being charged with.
[3:02:53.560 --> 3:02:56.560]  But and I also don't know if you can run from jail.
[3:02:56.560 --> 3:02:58.560]  Interesting.
[3:02:58.560 --> 3:03:01.560]  That'll be a tough one for the Democrats to try to figure out as well.
[3:03:01.560 --> 3:03:04.560]  I guess not the Democrats, more the media.
[3:03:04.560 --> 3:03:06.560]  I mean, what a bunch of jackasses.
[3:03:06.560 --> 3:03:07.560]  Gerald Selene with me now.
[3:03:07.560 --> 3:03:16.560]  If there is ever one thing that you can sit here and expose the media as total jackasses.
[3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:21.560]  I think the praise of Avenatti and then his utter downfall is the perfect example.
[3:03:21.560 --> 3:03:24.560]  That's why I call them prostitutes.
[3:03:24.560 --> 3:03:26.560]  They get paid to put out.
[3:03:26.560 --> 3:03:31.560]  They get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and Washington Hormasters.
[3:03:31.560 --> 3:03:32.560]  So that's all they're doing.
[3:03:32.560 --> 3:03:35.560]  They're repeating the garbage that's fed to them.
[3:03:35.560 --> 3:03:37.560]  And we could see what low lives they are.
[3:03:37.560 --> 3:03:42.560]  And that's why people have to listen to info wars and alternative media trends,
[3:03:42.560 --> 3:03:50.560]  like in the journal so that you get the truth in what's going on rather than the agendas that these little low lives are selling.
[3:03:50.560 --> 3:04:03.560]  What's stupid in the silica remarks that you guys and women just played of how great this Avenatti was and and all that he meant and all that he's doing.
[3:04:03.560 --> 3:04:05.560]  And what his real goal in life is.
[3:04:05.560 --> 3:04:14.560]  What a bunch of crap and these are the people that are crapping it out every day on the air and a station near you.
[3:04:14.560 --> 3:04:15.560]  It's unbelievable.
[3:04:15.560 --> 3:04:17.560]  They've been totally exposed.
[3:04:17.560 --> 3:04:19.560]  And you know what's sad though.
[3:04:19.560 --> 3:04:20.560]  They feel no guilt.
[3:04:20.560 --> 3:04:26.560]  They feel no embarrassment for all the fake news and all the BS and propaganda they engage in.
[3:04:26.560 --> 3:04:27.560]  It's really sick.
[3:04:27.560 --> 3:04:30.560]  And we laugh at these people for the jokers they are.
[3:04:30.560 --> 3:04:36.560]  But but at another level, these are really sick people that are the enemy of truth and freedom.
[3:04:36.560 --> 3:04:44.560]  All right, Gerald Salenti, he's taking his super male vitality and he's ready to boogie with you for the next hour.
[3:04:44.560 --> 3:04:45.560]  Final hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:04:45.560 --> 3:04:47.560]  Thanks everybody for tuning in and listening to me.
[3:04:47.560 --> 3:04:48.560]  Gerald Salenti takes over.
[3:04:51.560 --> 3:04:53.560]  Well, it's finally happening.
[3:04:53.560 --> 3:04:59.560]  The president is coming out and saying the deep state are a bunch of out of control criminals that need to be prosecuted.
[3:04:59.560 --> 3:05:09.560]  And he has fired over 200 senior bureaucrats in the State Department and the Justice Department in just the last few days.
[3:05:09.560 --> 3:05:14.560]  And he took the head prosecutor over stone and offered her a job at Treasury.
[3:05:14.560 --> 3:05:18.560]  As soon as she quit that job, he then withdrew the nomination.
[3:05:18.560 --> 3:05:21.560]  And now she's out on her globalist ass.
[3:05:21.560 --> 3:05:22.560]  This is beautiful.
[3:05:22.560 --> 3:05:23.560]  It's happening.
[3:05:23.560 --> 3:05:25.560]  But we need to see a lot more.
[3:05:25.560 --> 3:05:27.560]  All the neocons need to be fired.
[3:05:27.560 --> 3:05:29.560]  All the Obama appointees fired.
[3:05:29.560 --> 3:05:35.560]  All the deep state globalists who have resumes with George Soros fired, fired, fired, fired.
[3:05:35.560 --> 3:05:37.560]  Trump is finally unleashed.
[3:05:37.560 --> 3:05:39.560]  Trump is not the red wave.
[3:05:39.560 --> 3:05:41.560]  He is the red storm.
[3:05:41.560 --> 3:05:46.560]  And Info Wars is the tip of the spear powered by we the people.
[3:05:46.560 --> 3:06:03.560]  Never backing down, never giving in and delivering victory in our time.
[3:06:03.560 --> 3:06:06.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:06:06.560 --> 3:06:13.560]  And now your host Gerald Salente.
[3:06:13.560 --> 3:06:15.560]  Well, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[3:06:15.560 --> 3:06:19.560]  For having me host the Alex Jones show on Info Wars.
[3:06:19.560 --> 3:06:20.560]  Great being here.
[3:06:20.560 --> 3:06:27.560]  And again, as someone was just showing how stupid the mainstream media is, what a bunch
[3:06:27.560 --> 3:06:33.560]  of little low lives boys and girls got to be even here one after another.
[3:06:33.560 --> 3:06:38.560]  And as someone pointed out, there'll be no regret for their stupidity and ignorance
[3:06:38.560 --> 3:06:40.560]  in what they said.
[3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:42.560]  It doesn't matter to them at all.
[3:06:42.560 --> 3:06:46.560]  They just put out the propaganda and the people by it.
[3:06:46.560 --> 3:06:49.560]  Like, you know, Russians, they hacked into the DNC.
[3:06:49.560 --> 3:06:55.560]  No, that's why Hillary Clinton lost the election in 2016 against Trump.
[3:06:55.560 --> 3:06:59.560]  Wasn't because she's such a low life person and had such a high negative rating.
[3:06:59.560 --> 3:07:01.560]  No, that had nothing to do with it.
[3:07:01.560 --> 3:07:02.560]  It was the Russians.
[3:07:02.560 --> 3:07:07.560]  Well, he can't give you any proof, but that's our assumption, our belief, our, you know what,
[3:07:07.560 --> 3:07:10.560]  that counts for nothing in a court of law.
[3:07:10.560 --> 3:07:17.560]  So it's very, very important that you do all you can to keep the truth alive, support
[3:07:17.560 --> 3:07:18.560]  Info Wars.
[3:07:18.560 --> 3:07:23.560]  And of course, our magazine, the Trends Journal, the only magazine like it in the world tells
[3:07:23.560 --> 3:07:26.560]  you what's going on, what it means and what's next.
[3:07:26.560 --> 3:07:29.560]  And that's not what you're getting anywhere else.
[3:07:29.560 --> 3:07:34.560]  And speaking about what's next, how about let's take a look at Goodbye Rosie, Queen
[3:07:34.560 --> 3:07:35.560]  of Coronavirus.
[3:07:35.560 --> 3:07:39.560]  I mean, to us, as we're looking at this, here's the big story.
[3:07:39.560 --> 3:07:48.560]  The big story is how the Chinese government could take almost total control of a country
[3:07:48.560 --> 3:07:56.560]  of 1.4 billion people, lock them down, watch them, tell them what to do, how to do it,
[3:07:56.560 --> 3:07:58.560]  where to do it and when to do it.
[3:07:58.560 --> 3:08:01.560]  That to us is the big story.
[3:08:01.560 --> 3:08:08.560]  And you're going to see this being replayed in country after country as economies decline
[3:08:08.560 --> 3:08:12.560]  more and militarism heats up even more.
[3:08:12.560 --> 3:08:19.560]  So the rulers are in control and you're seeing it right in front of your eyes like you can't
[3:08:19.560 --> 3:08:20.560]  believe it.
[3:08:20.560 --> 3:08:23.560]  And how they're keeping people, you know, they they caught the coronavirus.
[3:08:23.560 --> 3:08:24.560]  OK, so you got a virus.
[3:08:24.560 --> 3:08:25.560]  You got sick.
[3:08:25.560 --> 3:08:27.560]  Doesn't mean you're going to die.
[3:08:27.560 --> 3:08:30.560]  Under 2000 people have died so far.
[3:08:30.560 --> 3:08:41.560]  2000 people in a population, global population of 7.7 billion people adds up to nothing.
[3:08:41.560 --> 3:08:44.560]  So that's the way we're looking at this.
[3:08:44.560 --> 3:08:50.560]  Our experts do not believe that the coronavirus is a pandemic.
[3:08:50.560 --> 3:08:56.560]  And we don't see it becoming an epidemic, although they're selling it as one.
[3:08:56.560 --> 3:08:59.560]  And that's what the mainstream media does.
[3:08:59.560 --> 3:09:07.560]  Just as Owen showed you all those clips about how they were selling this guy of a naughty.
[3:09:07.560 --> 3:09:10.560]  And maybe they spell his name wrong at the end.
[3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:13.560]  Maybe it should have been of a Nazi, you know.
[3:09:13.560 --> 3:09:14.560]  Yeah.
[3:09:14.560 --> 3:09:17.560]  Another low life piece of garbage.
[3:09:17.560 --> 3:09:21.560]  Oh, according to anyway, the court ruling that found him guilty.
[3:09:21.560 --> 3:09:23.560]  So that's not my words.
[3:09:23.560 --> 3:09:28.560]  That's from the prosecutors who prosecuted.
[3:09:28.560 --> 3:09:31.560]  But that's what the media is dumbed down to.
[3:09:31.560 --> 3:09:36.560]  To going back to how they're selling the coronavirus, they get people tuned in.
[3:09:36.560 --> 3:09:39.560]  People are freaking out.
[3:09:39.560 --> 3:09:43.560]  And that's what they want to do, just like when there's a hurricane coming.
[3:09:43.560 --> 3:09:49.560]  You see all these little prostitutes dressed up with their raincoats on and the wind blowing.
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:09:54.560]  And the water splashing over the boardwalk onto the streets.
[3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:59.560]  And the leaves blowing and the trees bending.
[3:09:59.560 --> 3:10:03.560]  And they keep that going for day after day after day after day.
[3:10:03.560 --> 3:10:04.560]  It's us.
[3:10:04.560 --> 3:10:07.560]  They're doing the same thing with the coronavirus.
[3:10:07.560 --> 3:10:11.560]  What effect will the coronavirus have on the global economy?
[3:10:11.560 --> 3:10:22.560]  According to some of the estimates out there, whether they're from the Goldman Sachs gang or other investor groups.
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:24.560]  You're looking in banksters.
[3:10:24.560 --> 3:10:32.560]  You're looking at at worst a 0.1 decline.
[3:10:32.560 --> 3:10:38.560]  It's going to hurt the Chinese economy and it already is there in problems.
[3:10:38.560 --> 3:10:44.560]  But you go back and look what happened already in this past weekend.
[3:10:44.560 --> 3:10:57.560]  The numbers coming out of Europe on economic growth in the last quarter before this happened at the end of last year before the coronavirus.
[3:10:57.560 --> 3:11:01.560]  They're facing almost recessionary times.
[3:11:01.560 --> 3:11:07.560]  You look at the data that just came out from Japan last night.
[3:11:07.560 --> 3:11:14.560]  But December's data terrible.
[3:11:14.560 --> 3:11:18.560]  You're looking at worse years and in a long time decades.
[3:11:18.560 --> 3:11:24.560]  This is before the coronavirus is a global slowdown going on.
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:32.560]  And as I forecast, you're going to see gold prices hit $2,000 an ounce.
[3:11:32.560 --> 3:11:39.560]  You're going to see the markets crash and the world is going to enter into the greatest depression.
[3:11:39.560 --> 3:11:47.560]  When minus a wild card and the coronavirus is the kind of wild card that you can't see coming.
[3:11:47.560 --> 3:11:49.560]  And there's going to be others.
[3:11:49.560 --> 3:11:58.560]  The greatest depression is going to hit by this time in 20.
[3:11:58.560 --> 3:12:01.560]  Twenty one.
[3:12:01.560 --> 3:12:04.560]  There's no holding it back.
[3:12:04.560 --> 3:12:11.560]  All this cheap money they're dumping into the system, as I call it, is nothing more than monetary methadone.
[3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:20.560]  And so the repo markets overnight, some seven trillion dollars since September 17th have been pumped in.
[3:12:20.560 --> 3:12:23.560]  You're seeing what's now going on in China.
[3:12:23.560 --> 3:12:32.560]  They're pumping more dough into the system, trying to boost up your economy that's slowing down.
[3:12:32.560 --> 3:12:33.560]  Very important.
[3:12:33.560 --> 3:12:38.560]  I mentioned gold prices, $1,580 an ounce, as we're speaking.
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:43.560]  That's despite the dollar getting strong.
[3:12:43.560 --> 3:12:51.560]  The stronger the dollar gets, the lower gold prices go because you got to pay for gold in dollars.
[3:12:51.560 --> 3:12:53.560]  It goes back to China.
[3:12:53.560 --> 3:12:56.560]  Does China want to devalue its currency that you want?
[3:12:56.560 --> 3:12:57.560]  No.
[3:12:57.560 --> 3:12:59.560]  Are they going to have to?
[3:12:59.560 --> 3:13:03.560]  Yes, because they're going to be pumping more cheap money in.
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:12.560]  The more cheap money that goes in, the lower the interest rates go, the lower the value of their currency.
[3:13:12.560 --> 3:13:18.560]  You're going to start hearing the BS that they're doing it purposely so that they can export more product.
[3:13:18.560 --> 3:13:23.560]  Now, they're the largest importer oil in the world.
[3:13:23.560 --> 3:13:29.560]  Their GDP is even more consumer based than ours.
[3:13:29.560 --> 3:13:32.560]  We have two thirds, a little over two thirds.
[3:13:32.560 --> 3:13:34.560]  They have over 70%.
[3:13:34.560 --> 3:13:37.560]  They import a lot of product.
[3:13:37.560 --> 3:13:43.560]  As the current value of their currency goes down, they import less product because they can't afford it.
[3:13:43.560 --> 3:13:46.560]  They have stagflation.
[3:13:46.560 --> 3:13:50.560]  That means economies flat, inflation is going up.
[3:13:50.560 --> 3:13:57.560]  When inflation is going up, you don't want to lower interest rates because it's going to make a bad situation worse.
[3:13:57.560 --> 3:14:00.560]  And that's what China is in right now.
[3:14:00.560 --> 3:14:03.560]  A very bad situation.
[3:14:03.560 --> 3:14:07.560]  Will it have an effect on the global economy?
[3:14:07.560 --> 3:14:09.560]  Yes, to some extent.
[3:14:09.560 --> 3:14:15.560]  It'll have a greater effect on the Chinese economy to a much greater extent.
[3:14:15.560 --> 3:14:19.560]  The $40 trillion in debt.
[3:14:19.560 --> 3:14:22.560]  The debt to GDP ratio is over 300.
[3:14:22.560 --> 3:14:25.560]  A good one's around 70, 80.
[3:14:25.560 --> 3:14:32.560]  And now they got to pump more cheap dough to keep the game afloat.
[3:14:32.560 --> 3:14:35.560]  It's not going to happen.
[3:14:35.560 --> 3:14:38.560]  We're going to see a lot of riots, disturbances.
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:43.560]  And let's not forget, there's still Hong Kong going on.
[3:14:43.560 --> 3:14:47.560]  That's been out of the news of the coronavirus.
[3:14:47.560 --> 3:14:50.560]  So China's in a tough place.
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:53.560]  How bad will it be? How low will it go?
[3:14:53.560 --> 3:14:57.560]  Pretty low.
[3:14:57.560 --> 3:15:00.560]  So what do you do to protect it?
[3:15:00.560 --> 3:15:09.560]  Well, first what you do is you consider securing your future.
[3:15:09.560 --> 3:15:12.560]  How do you secure your future?
[3:15:12.560 --> 3:15:15.560]  One of them, we're going to get back.
[3:15:15.560 --> 3:15:18.560]  We're going to tell you what to do and how to do it.
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:24.560]  And you could do it on infowars because they have some of the answers that you need.
[3:15:24.560 --> 3:15:29.560]  So the future's coming.
[3:15:29.560 --> 3:15:31.560]  We see it.
[3:15:31.560 --> 3:15:33.560]  Be prepared.
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:41.560]  Prevail and prosper because this thing is going to get ugly real quick and real soon.
[3:15:41.560 --> 3:15:43.560]  How soon?
[3:15:43.560 --> 3:15:47.560]  The decline's on the way in a country near you.
[3:15:47.560 --> 3:15:51.560]  More riots, more protests, taken to the streets.
[3:15:51.560 --> 3:15:54.560]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[3:15:54.560 --> 3:15:57.560]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[3:15:57.560 --> 3:16:00.560]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker.
[3:16:00.560 --> 3:16:04.560]  If you're not protected, everybody sees your information.
[3:16:04.560 --> 3:16:09.560]  That's why you need flash routers, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.

[3:19:50.560 --> 3:20:18.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:18.560 --> 3:20:24.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:24.560 --> 3:20:30.560]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:20:30.560 --> 3:20:33.560]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[3:20:33.560 --> 3:20:37.560]  Love being on the Alex Jones show, info wars, all they do.
[3:20:37.560 --> 3:20:42.560]  And as I was saying before we went to the break, you better prepare for the worst.
[3:20:42.560 --> 3:20:45.560]  You know, the coronavirus, you know, we believe it's going to go away,
[3:20:45.560 --> 3:20:49.560]  but look how many other ways that they're going to, they're killing us.
[3:20:49.560 --> 3:20:55.560]  All the poisons that they're putting in our food and our water in the air.
[3:20:55.560 --> 3:21:00.560]  So what you need when the worst happens is to make sure that you have info wars,
[3:21:00.560 --> 3:21:03.560]  life select, storable food.
[3:21:03.560 --> 3:21:07.560]  Because when things go down and people are out of their minds,
[3:21:07.560 --> 3:21:10.560]  you need, you know, you got to be prepared for the worst.
[3:21:10.560 --> 3:21:15.560]  And with the rise of coronavirus, trouble brewing constantly overseas and more
[3:21:15.560 --> 3:21:19.560]  danger is constantly growing overseas.
[3:21:19.560 --> 3:21:23.560]  That's why it's so important to make sure that you have the storable food
[3:21:23.560 --> 3:21:27.560]  that you need to prepare today.
[3:21:27.560 --> 3:21:31.560]  With amounts ranging from three days to a whole year,
[3:21:31.560 --> 3:21:38.560]  your storable food selection can make sure you're not a victim of circumstances.
[3:21:38.560 --> 3:21:42.560]  And the manufacturers having difficulty keeping up with the current spike.
[3:21:42.560 --> 3:21:46.560]  As soon as it comes off the line, it's being shipped out.
[3:21:46.560 --> 3:21:49.560]  So secure your orders today.
[3:21:49.560 --> 3:21:53.560]  Right now, you should get your order in seven to ten days.
[3:21:53.560 --> 3:21:57.560]  However, this is getting delayed with each passing minute.
[3:21:57.560 --> 3:22:00.560]  So secure your spot now.
[3:22:00.560 --> 3:22:06.560]  Other suppliers aren't able to ship at all due to the huge demand.
[3:22:06.560 --> 3:22:10.560]  And it's also important to secure a clean filtered water supply.
[3:22:10.560 --> 3:22:16.560]  As debris and dust settle in, having the Alexa pure water filtration system
[3:22:16.560 --> 3:22:21.560]  can be one of the key parts of a proper survival plan.
[3:22:21.560 --> 3:22:26.560]  Those that know what's coming are using today to prepare.
[3:22:26.560 --> 3:22:31.560]  So don't be forced to rely and wait for others for your survival.
[3:22:31.560 --> 3:22:37.560]  Get one of Info Wars emergency storable food options
[3:22:37.560 --> 3:22:42.560]  or water and air filtration systems at NASA discounts.
[3:22:42.560 --> 3:22:46.560]  Again, you can see where the future is heading.
[3:22:46.560 --> 3:22:49.560]  And it's not very pretty.
[3:22:49.560 --> 3:22:54.560]  So, you know, think for yourself as the model of our magazine,
[3:22:54.560 --> 3:22:57.560]  The Trends Journal, and again, beyond the coronavirus,
[3:22:57.560 --> 3:22:59.560]  you can't drink the water.
[3:22:59.560 --> 3:23:03.560]  It's poisoned everywhere, everywhere, not everywhere.
[3:23:03.560 --> 3:23:06.560]  Mr. Salenty, there's a couple of places where it's still safe.
[3:23:06.560 --> 3:23:10.560]  Yeah, you want some of that plastic in you?
[3:23:10.560 --> 3:23:13.560]  So very important to prepare for the future.
[3:23:13.560 --> 3:23:16.560]  And again, I don't give financial advice.
[3:23:16.560 --> 3:23:17.560]  I believe it.
[3:23:17.560 --> 3:23:21.560]  And again, I do not give financial advice.
[3:23:21.560 --> 3:23:25.560]  The meat gold is the best of the safe haven assets.
[3:23:25.560 --> 3:23:28.560]  And with prices still strong is the dollar strong.
[3:23:28.560 --> 3:23:32.560]  It's telling you a story of where the future is heading.
[3:23:32.560 --> 3:23:35.560]  And the future is dark on the economic front.
[3:23:35.560 --> 3:23:39.560]  It's only being artificially propped up.
[3:23:39.560 --> 3:23:44.560]  Part of my work every day is I go through the news,
[3:23:44.560 --> 3:23:47.560]  get these papers delivered to Financial Times,
[3:23:47.560 --> 3:23:50.560]  Wall Street Journal, toy the paper record in New York Times
[3:23:50.560 --> 3:23:52.560]  just to see what's going on.
[3:23:52.560 --> 3:23:55.560]  And then I decide from what I'm reading,
[3:23:55.560 --> 3:23:57.560]  what sounds real, what doesn't.
[3:23:57.560 --> 3:23:59.560]  I go to other countries.
[3:23:59.560 --> 3:24:01.560]  Iranian conflicts going on.
[3:24:01.560 --> 3:24:03.560]  I'm at Fars News Agency.
[3:24:03.560 --> 3:24:05.560]  I want to hear what the Iranians are saying.
[3:24:05.560 --> 3:24:07.560]  I want to hear what the Arabs are saying.
[3:24:07.560 --> 3:24:08.560]  I go to Al Jazeera.
[3:24:08.560 --> 3:24:11.560]  I only want to hear what the American Prestitudes are saying
[3:24:11.560 --> 3:24:15.560]  or Washington's saying because I have trouble believing any of them.
[3:24:15.560 --> 3:24:19.560]  So just to start off to show you where the economy is going.
[3:24:19.560 --> 3:24:32.560]  Hope's Eurozone rebound dashed as growth slows to lowest rate in seven years.
[3:24:32.560 --> 3:24:42.560]  The single currency zone grew at a quarterly rate of 0.1% in the fourth quarter.
[3:24:42.560 --> 3:24:49.560]  Its slowest rate of expansion since early 2013.
[3:24:49.560 --> 3:24:57.560]  Germany flatlined in the fourth quarter producing zero growth.
[3:24:57.560 --> 3:25:00.560]  Has nothing to do with Corona.
[3:25:00.560 --> 3:25:02.560]  Has nothing to do with the virus.
[3:25:02.560 --> 3:25:05.560]  Has nothing to do with the trade war.
[3:25:05.560 --> 3:25:07.560]  We're talking about Germany.
[3:25:07.560 --> 3:25:10.560]  We're not talking about Zimbabwe.
[3:25:10.560 --> 3:25:15.560]  We're talking about the strongest country in the Eurozone in Europe.
[3:25:15.560 --> 3:25:18.560]  Germany flat.
[3:25:18.560 --> 3:25:21.560]  All right.
[3:25:21.560 --> 3:25:23.560]  You keep going through the numbers.
[3:25:23.560 --> 3:25:28.560]  Manufacturing slips in the United States.
[3:25:28.560 --> 3:25:38.560]  Business investment declined in three out of four quarters in 2019.
[3:25:38.560 --> 3:25:43.560]  Remained constrained by weak global growth.
[3:25:43.560 --> 3:25:46.560]  Nothing to do with Corona virus.
[3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:48.560]  Its global slowed down.
[3:25:48.560 --> 3:25:51.560]  You better prepare for the workers.
[3:25:51.560 --> 3:25:53.560]  It's coming.
[3:25:53.560 --> 3:25:56.560]  Where else do we have over here?
[3:25:56.560 --> 3:25:58.560]  Industrial production.
[3:25:58.560 --> 3:26:06.560]  The measure of factory mining and utility output decreased decisionally adjusted 0.3%.
[3:26:06.560 --> 3:26:13.560]  Utilities production dropped 4% last month.
[3:26:13.560 --> 3:26:15.560]  Retail sales went up.
[3:26:15.560 --> 3:26:17.560]  The grand total is 0.2%.
[3:26:17.560 --> 3:26:22.560]  Hardly anything.
[3:26:22.560 --> 3:26:24.560]  Ain't a lot of growth.
[3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:32.560]  U.S. bulls shrug off outbreak worries as profit growth hopes to seal surge in stocks.
[3:26:32.560 --> 3:26:35.560]  Stock markets going to remain strong
[3:26:35.560 --> 3:26:38.560]  as long as more cheap money could go in there.
[3:26:38.560 --> 3:26:41.560]  But there's something to watch out for.
[3:26:41.560 --> 3:26:44.560]  A warning sign just came out from the White House.
[3:26:44.560 --> 3:26:49.560]  They want to pass tax breaks so the average Jane and Joe
[3:26:49.560 --> 3:26:52.560]  get involved in the equity markets.
[3:26:52.560 --> 3:26:54.560]  You know what that means?
[3:26:54.560 --> 3:26:59.560]  When they bring in the little people, it goes down.
[3:26:59.560 --> 3:27:02.560]  They get their last bucks and where they could get them from.
[3:27:02.560 --> 3:27:05.560]  Just like they did during that subprime mortgage time.
[3:27:05.560 --> 3:27:06.560]  You remember that one.
[3:27:06.560 --> 3:27:08.560]  You don't have a job.
[3:27:08.560 --> 3:27:10.560]  Don't have any credit.
[3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:12.560]  Got no money in the bank.
[3:27:12.560 --> 3:27:14.560]  I think you should buy a home.
[3:27:14.560 --> 3:27:16.560]  Just sign over here.
[3:27:16.560 --> 3:27:19.560]  And you got yours.
[3:27:19.560 --> 3:27:26.560]  You're doing it going to do the same thing with this subprime mortgage thing
[3:27:26.560 --> 3:27:30.560]  by getting people into the equity markets.
[3:27:30.560 --> 3:27:38.560]  Ten percent of the population own over 90 percent of the equity markets.
[3:27:38.560 --> 3:27:46.560]  It's only enriching the rich, which brings us to a very important point.
[3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:49.560]  People can't afford to buy houses.
[3:27:49.560 --> 3:27:53.560]  They got 14 trillion dollars in debt.
[3:27:53.560 --> 3:27:58.560]  And you're living in cars because you could drive a car.
[3:27:58.560 --> 3:28:01.560]  You can't live in a car and drive it, but you can't drive a house.
[3:28:01.560 --> 3:28:03.560]  That's how bad things are.
[3:28:03.560 --> 3:28:07.560]  You're going to get a third of the people living paycheck to paycheck.
[3:28:07.560 --> 3:28:12.560]  So things are going down and you have to prepare.
[3:28:12.560 --> 3:28:18.560]  Info Wars helps you prepare with a lot of the products that they sell.
[3:28:18.560 --> 3:28:25.560]  And we help you prepare to see what's happening next so that you can see the future.
[3:28:25.560 --> 3:28:29.560]  You get it in the Trends Journal and you read history before it happens.
[3:28:29.560 --> 3:28:32.560]  Prepare, prevail, and prosper.
[3:28:32.560 --> 3:28:34.560]  This thing's going down.
[3:28:34.560 --> 3:28:36.560]  And who's it going to help?
[3:28:36.560 --> 3:28:39.560]  You'll see very soon who it's going to help.
[3:28:39.560 --> 3:28:43.560]  So we're going to be back in a few, and don't forget, do everything you can
[3:28:43.560 --> 3:28:45.560]  to keep the truth alive.
[3:28:45.560 --> 3:28:47.560]  Support Info Wars.
[3:28:47.560 --> 3:28:50.560]  We'll be back in just a few.
[3:28:50.560 --> 3:28:54.560]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[3:28:54.560 --> 3:28:57.560]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[3:28:57.560 --> 3:29:01.560]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker,

[3:30:15.560 --> 3:30:20.560]  Trust CNN, trust MSNBC, drink fluoridated water
[3:30:20.560 --> 3:30:25.560]  just like the loving kiss of a king cobra pumping deadly,
[3:30:25.560 --> 3:30:29.560]  I mean loving, helpful nutrients in their body.
[3:30:29.560 --> 3:30:34.560]  Hug the cobra, love the cobra, kiss the cobra,
[3:30:34.560 --> 3:30:42.560]  but never, never go to infowars.com or infowarsstore.com.
[3:30:42.560 --> 3:30:45.560]  Do not order those products.
[3:30:45.560 --> 3:30:48.560]  Silence Jones.
[3:30:53.560 --> 3:30:56.560]  This should really be easier than it is.
[3:30:56.560 --> 3:30:58.560]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[3:30:58.560 --> 3:31:02.560]  I'm pointing out the way forward things that I've discovered
[3:31:02.560 --> 3:31:06.560]  that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me
[3:31:06.560 --> 3:31:10.560]  and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[3:31:10.560 --> 3:31:15.560]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[3:31:15.560 --> 3:31:18.560]  and will help us and it's symbiotic.
[3:31:18.560 --> 3:31:21.560]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine
[3:31:21.560 --> 3:31:24.560]  because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[3:31:24.560 --> 3:31:27.560]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen
[3:31:27.560 --> 3:31:31.560]  and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group
[3:31:31.560 --> 3:31:36.560]  like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[3:31:36.560 --> 3:31:41.560]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infowarsstore.com
[3:31:41.560 --> 3:31:45.560]  and I'm telling you folks, get it, it's amazing,
[3:31:45.560 --> 3:31:48.560]  discover the benefits and it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[3:31:48.560 --> 3:31:51.560]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[3:31:51.560 --> 3:31:56.560]  At the end of World War II, Adolf Hitler had discredited
[3:31:56.560 --> 3:32:00.560]  the eugenics and world population control organizations.
[3:32:00.560 --> 3:32:03.560]  They openly had meetings and led by Julian Huxley,
[3:32:03.560 --> 3:32:07.560]  all this Huxley's brother, decided to repackage themselves
[3:32:07.560 --> 3:32:09.560]  as transhumanists.
[3:32:09.560 --> 3:32:16.560]  Now in the year 2020, to set the precedent that people can be turned into cyborgs,
[3:32:16.560 --> 3:32:19.560]  that robots can be given rights, you name it,
[3:32:19.560 --> 3:32:23.560]  they are intimidating and arresting people all over the world
[3:32:23.560 --> 3:32:26.560]  who simply misgender someone.
[3:32:26.560 --> 3:32:30.560]  So the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is
[3:32:30.560 --> 3:32:33.560]  if you can't even tell what they are.
[3:32:33.560 --> 3:32:36.560]  This is the ultimate Kafka-esque mind control
[3:32:36.560 --> 3:32:40.560]  and there's several big articles up on infowars.com that break this down.
[3:32:40.560 --> 3:32:45.560]  UK teen fine under house arrest for asking trans police officers,
[3:32:45.560 --> 3:32:48.560]  gender, UK mother, spare jail for misgendering trans woman
[3:32:48.560 --> 3:33:01.560]  order to pay 1,000 pound fine.
[3:33:18.560 --> 3:33:25.560]  The Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:25.560 --> 3:33:30.560]  Here we are in Kingston, New York, the first capital of New York state
[3:33:30.560 --> 3:33:34.560]  where the seeds of democracy were sown right here in the four corners.
[3:33:34.560 --> 3:33:38.560]  The only place with pre-revolutionary war stone buildings on each corner.
[3:33:38.560 --> 3:33:42.560]  And most of America's constitution came to the one that was written right over here
[3:33:42.560 --> 3:33:46.560]  when John Jay, the Supreme Court judge, right, the first cat.
[3:33:46.560 --> 3:33:50.560]  He was a judge over here and this was the first capital of New York state.
[3:33:50.560 --> 3:33:55.560]  The constitution is written for New York state right over here.
[3:33:55.560 --> 3:33:59.560]  Most over 70% of America's constitution comes from it.
[3:33:59.560 --> 3:34:00.560]  And that's a fact.
[3:34:00.560 --> 3:34:04.560]  So as we're talking about constitution and facts and where we're going,
[3:34:04.560 --> 3:34:07.560]  I was talking before about the economy.
[3:34:07.560 --> 3:34:14.560]  You know, my forecast 2020 top trends is that Trump by default in 2020.
[3:34:14.560 --> 3:34:17.560]  You know, I may change that forecast.
[3:34:17.560 --> 3:34:22.560]  And as you all know, who followed me on Info Wars over the years and
[3:34:22.560 --> 3:34:30.560]  Trends Journal subscribers, in May of 2016, I called Trump the winner.
[3:34:30.560 --> 3:34:32.560]  It's a fact.
[3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:36.560]  He is the winner of 2016.
[3:34:36.560 --> 3:34:43.560]  And for our top trends of this year, we had him as the winner of the 2020 election.
[3:34:43.560 --> 3:34:47.560]  However, that might change.
[3:34:47.560 --> 3:34:51.560]  What we do is we look at global trends shaping the future.
[3:34:51.560 --> 3:34:56.560]  And there's a big movement going on because one of our other trends is called
[3:34:56.560 --> 3:34:59.560]  the New World Disorder.
[3:34:59.560 --> 3:35:06.560]  And how from Lebanon to France, from Algeria to Chile, to Bolivia,
[3:35:06.560 --> 3:35:14.560]  Colombia, to Zimbabwe, to South Africa, all around the globe, Hong Kong.
[3:35:14.560 --> 3:35:22.560]  People are protesting against the entrenched interest, the corruption.
[3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:24.560]  And guess what?
[3:35:24.560 --> 3:35:29.560]  That's why Trump won in 2016.
[3:35:29.560 --> 3:35:33.560]  He was the new voice from the outside the political party.
[3:35:33.560 --> 3:35:37.560]  So he just had an election over there in Ireland.
[3:35:37.560 --> 3:35:39.560]  Sinn Fein.
[3:35:39.560 --> 3:35:41.560]  Him out of nowhere.
[3:35:41.560 --> 3:35:43.560]  And one big.
[3:35:43.560 --> 3:35:46.560]  And you know what the issues are?
[3:35:46.560 --> 3:35:49.560]  Healthcare.
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:35:51.560]  Can't afford rent.
[3:35:51.560 --> 3:35:53.560]  Can't buy a house.
[3:35:53.560 --> 3:35:55.560]  Lousy jobs.
[3:35:55.560 --> 3:35:58.560]  All the money going to the 1%.
[3:35:58.560 --> 3:36:04.560]  And another big one, homeless population.
[3:36:04.560 --> 3:36:10.560]  It's not like the people want to live on a street in a tent, you know?
[3:36:10.560 --> 3:36:14.560]  The party there won.
[3:36:14.560 --> 3:36:20.560]  And that's what all these protests around the world are about.
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:27.560]  It's the 1% getting everything, the violence, the corruption of the established parties.
[3:36:27.560 --> 3:36:33.560]  Bernie Sanders has a shot.
[3:36:33.560 --> 3:36:37.560]  And this is the first time I'm saying this.
[3:36:37.560 --> 3:36:39.560]  Is he a phony?
[3:36:39.560 --> 3:36:43.560]  Phony of the first degree.
[3:36:43.560 --> 3:36:48.560]  Another boy that's never worked a day in his life sucking off the public.
[3:36:48.560 --> 3:36:52.560]  You know what?
[3:36:52.560 --> 3:36:55.560]  This is the guy, by the way.
[3:36:55.560 --> 3:36:57.560]  He loved that. He's the peace candidate.
[3:36:57.560 --> 3:37:00.560]  Yeah, a piece of crap candidate.
[3:37:00.560 --> 3:37:07.560]  This is the guy that supported the Bosnian war, the Yugoslav war.
[3:37:07.560 --> 3:37:12.560]  This is the guy that supported the Afghan war.
[3:37:12.560 --> 3:37:19.560]  Not only that, he voted against a resolution that would have forced Congress to vote to go to war.
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:23.560]  Rather, he gave it to the El Presidente.
[3:37:23.560 --> 3:37:32.560]  This is the clown boy that's bringing F-35 jets up into Burlington Air Force.
[3:37:32.560 --> 3:37:43.560]  But he appeals to the millennials that are still living with mommy and daddy because they can't find a job.
[3:37:43.560 --> 3:37:50.560]  Generation Z, the ones younger, or Generation Zero.
[3:37:50.560 --> 3:37:54.560]  The whole country's been taken over by the monopolies.
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:37:58.560]  Mom and Pops out, forget about it.
[3:37:58.560 --> 3:38:01.560]  All those stores are gone. The hardware stores, no.
[3:38:01.560 --> 3:38:03.560]  Now we got loads of them deeper.
[3:38:03.560 --> 3:38:06.560]  We'll do away with the laws so the bigs can own everything.
[3:38:06.560 --> 3:38:10.560]  Macy's Target, coal, put everybody else out of business.
[3:38:10.560 --> 3:38:15.560]  Staples, who needs a stationary store? You got them.
[3:38:15.560 --> 3:38:19.560]  So the young people have no future.
[3:38:19.560 --> 3:38:23.560]  Same thing that's going on around the world.
[3:38:23.560 --> 3:38:27.560]  They're going into these anti-establishment parties.
[3:38:27.560 --> 3:38:36.560]  And Phony Sanders is painting himself as the outsider in the inside group.
[3:38:36.560 --> 3:38:44.560]  Here are some of his quotes from the toilet paper, a record.
[3:38:44.560 --> 3:39:02.560]  Would you consider military force to preempt, to preempt an Iranian or North Korean nuclear or missile test, a test?
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:09.560]  Would you strike Iran or North Korea because they want to test the nuclear missile?
[3:39:09.560 --> 3:39:15.560]  Only we're allowed to test them. So you know what he said he would do?
[3:39:15.560 --> 3:39:18.560]  Yep. He would strike.
[3:39:18.560 --> 3:39:26.560]  Yeah. Bernie, the peace candidate, peace of crap when you look at his track record.
[3:39:26.560 --> 3:39:36.560]  Again, as I've mentioned, this is the boy who supported Bill Clinton's sanctions against Iraq
[3:39:36.560 --> 3:39:44.560]  in the 1990s that killed over 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five.
[3:39:44.560 --> 3:39:50.560]  And as they've shown you before on Info Wars, there's the U.N. ambassador at the time,
[3:39:50.560 --> 3:39:55.560]  Madeleine not all that bright, telling Leslie Stahl on 60 Minutes,
[3:39:55.560 --> 3:40:00.560]  that the price of 500,000 dead Iraqi children was worth the price of sanctions.
[3:40:00.560 --> 3:40:06.560]  It really worked great, didn't it, huh? Yeah. That's Bernie Sanders.
[3:40:06.560 --> 3:40:09.560]  Yeah, matter of fact, those sanctions were so great.
[3:40:09.560 --> 3:40:15.560]  Let's invade the place in 2003 on lies.
[3:40:15.560 --> 3:40:18.560]  That's Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda.
[3:40:18.560 --> 3:40:21.560]  And Bernie said, I voted against that.
[3:40:21.560 --> 3:40:26.560]  Yeah, but you voted against all the other, for all the other things.
[3:40:26.560 --> 3:40:31.560]  That was a shot at winning.
[3:40:31.560 --> 3:40:34.560]  What else do we have here?
[3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:39.560]  Would you consider military force for humanitarian intervention?
[3:40:39.560 --> 3:40:42.560]  You know that humanitarian intervention BS?
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:46.560]  I don't like the way he's treating his people over there, that Gaddafi,
[3:40:46.560 --> 3:40:50.560]  said the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner Barack Obama,
[3:40:50.560 --> 3:40:54.560]  along with Hillary Clinton, Samantha Powell and Susan Rice,
[3:40:54.560 --> 3:40:58.560]  and George and people of color.
[3:40:58.560 --> 3:41:02.560]  Yeah, makes no difference.
[3:41:02.560 --> 3:41:05.560]  Good and bad comes in all of them, so we'll save that.
[3:41:05.560 --> 3:41:07.560]  So Bernie would do the same thing.
[3:41:07.560 --> 3:41:09.560]  I want that guy shot at it.
[3:41:09.560 --> 3:41:12.560]  I don't like the way he's treating his people.
[3:41:12.560 --> 3:41:22.560]  He's a phony, but if he gets the young people that he's bringing in,
[3:41:22.560 --> 3:41:30.560]  the bottom line, the young are more than the old.
[3:41:30.560 --> 3:41:34.560]  Trump's going to get the older demographic,
[3:41:34.560 --> 3:41:40.560]  but he could lose significantly and will lose significantly
[3:41:40.560 --> 3:41:45.560]  the millennial demographic if Bernie Sanders gets the nomination.
[3:41:45.560 --> 3:41:50.560]  And that may not be enough for him to lose the swing states, Trump.
[3:41:50.560 --> 3:41:52.560]  Trump could lose Michigan.
[3:41:52.560 --> 3:41:54.560]  He could lose Wisconsin.
[3:41:54.560 --> 3:41:58.560]  He could lose Ohio.
[3:41:58.560 --> 3:42:07.560]  If, if enough millennials and Generation Z support Bernie,
[3:42:07.560 --> 3:42:12.560]  because they buy the BS, and all it is, it's the presidential reality show,
[3:42:12.560 --> 3:42:15.560]  and you know what politics is.
[3:42:15.560 --> 3:42:18.560]  It's show business for ugly people.
[3:42:18.560 --> 3:42:22.560]  All this is show business like no business.
[3:42:22.560 --> 3:42:24.560]  And Bernie's there.
[3:42:24.560 --> 3:42:27.560]  And then there's this other guy we're going to talk about, too.
[3:42:27.560 --> 3:42:32.560]  There's boot a gig, boot a gig, butter gig, whatever is the gig is,
[3:42:32.560 --> 3:42:34.560]  but the gigs are phony one.
[3:42:34.560 --> 3:42:38.560]  Yeah, the CIA boy, but he went.
[3:42:38.560 --> 3:42:39.560]  He could.
[3:42:39.560 --> 3:42:41.560]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[3:42:41.560 --> 3:42:47.560]  For other reasons, but Bernie Sanders has a shot.
[3:42:47.560 --> 3:42:50.560]  When we come back, I'll tell you more.
[3:42:50.560 --> 3:42:56.560]  Across the Western world, from high school to college sports to even the Olympics,
[3:42:56.560 --> 3:43:02.560]  men, biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[3:43:02.560 --> 3:43:08.560]  This is men invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away.
[3:43:08.560 --> 3:43:11.560]  All in the name of liberalism and openness.
[3:43:11.560 --> 3:43:15.560]  And then every day I have stacks of news articles just like today.
[3:43:15.560 --> 3:43:22.560]  UK teen find under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings.
[3:43:22.560 --> 3:43:29.560]  UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay 1000 pound fine
[3:43:29.560 --> 3:43:34.560]  because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[3:43:34.560 --> 3:43:36.560]  That's the thought police.
[3:43:36.560 --> 3:43:41.560]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail.
[3:43:41.560 --> 3:43:48.560]  This is tyranny. These people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific anti human takeover.
[3:43:48.560 --> 3:43:50.560]  Resistance speak out against it.
[3:43:50.560 --> 3:43:53.560]  There can no longer be any doubt.
[3:43:53.560 --> 3:43:57.560]  This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels.
[3:43:57.560 --> 3:43:58.560]  It's very communicable.
[3:43:58.560 --> 3:44:00.560]  It spreads very, very fast.
[3:44:00.560 --> 3:44:06.560]  It is killing a lot of people and the Chinese communist government has covered up just how bad it is.
[3:44:06.560 --> 3:44:13.560]  And the Lighthouse is now openly challenging them, show our Trump's top scientist and so is Senator Cotton.
[3:44:13.560 --> 3:44:17.560]  My friends, now is the time to get prepared.
[3:44:17.560 --> 3:44:24.560]  2020 is not a year to play games with the globalist are trying to create economic collapse, race riots.
[3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:27.560]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[3:44:27.560 --> 3:44:30.560]  That's why listeners to info wars need to be prepared.
[3:44:30.560 --> 3:44:36.560]  And infowarstore.com has the products that make your life better and make you healthier.
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:40.560]  We have the last of the immune gargle selling out as we speak.
[3:44:40.560 --> 3:44:52.560]  We have high quality, storable foods ready to ship and vitamin mineral fusion is back in stock along with ultra 12 at infowarstore.com.
[3:44:52.560 --> 3:44:56.560]  Real stuff, man. We're talking about the real deal here and I love Trump all day long.
[3:44:56.560 --> 3:45:01.560]  And I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over everybody.
[3:45:01.560 --> 3:45:04.560]  I mean, I've got a problem and we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[3:45:04.560 --> 3:45:08.560]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[3:45:08.560 --> 3:45:13.560]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers,
[3:45:13.560 --> 3:45:18.560]  impeach the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, infowarstore.com.
[3:45:18.560 --> 3:45:20.560]  And it looks like duct tape. It's just a regular sticker.
[3:45:20.560 --> 3:45:25.560]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[3:45:25.560 --> 3:45:27.560]  People say, why are you doing this? What's happening?
[3:45:27.560 --> 3:45:31.560]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored. You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[3:45:31.560 --> 3:45:34.560]  And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think because I've not launched this yet.
[3:45:34.560 --> 3:45:42.560]  It's brilliant. You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon.
[3:45:42.560 --> 3:45:48.560]  You have the loudest sound of all silence and you know what's most disturbing to people?
[3:45:48.560 --> 3:45:51.560]  Silence.
[3:45:51.560 --> 3:45:55.560]  Almost all the other big storeable food companies are sold out of food.
[3:45:55.560 --> 3:46:00.560]  But I know for a fact from sources they're telling people, oh, we've got to get your order in two weeks for delivery.
[3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:02.560]  We follow this pattern over and over again.
[3:46:02.560 --> 3:46:06.560]  I've been on ready for 25 years. I've had storeable food for a long time.
[3:46:06.560 --> 3:46:10.560]  And I learned very quickly a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times.
[3:46:10.560 --> 3:46:13.560]  But during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory.
[3:46:13.560 --> 3:46:15.560]  They'll still take your orders.
[3:46:15.560 --> 3:46:20.560]  That's why about 11 years ago, I found my Patriot Supply, now the biggest, most trusted company out there.
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:23.560]  And I became a private labeler for them because they actually have it on hand.
[3:46:23.560 --> 3:46:25.560]  They actually give it delivered to you on time.
[3:46:25.560 --> 3:46:29.560]  They do what they're going to say they're going to do because they want you as a customer over and over again.
[3:46:29.560 --> 3:46:30.560]  And they're good people.
[3:46:30.560 --> 3:46:35.560]  Now they were saying seven to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food, but they've got a package at record level orders.
[3:46:35.560 --> 3:46:40.560]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[3:46:40.560 --> 3:46:44.560]  So get your orders at an infowarstore.com. Get the best deals. Get it delivered first.
[3:46:44.560 --> 3:46:50.560]  If they're in our system, it goes right to them, then it funds the M4 as well. So get prepared infowarstore.com with Swarble Foods.
[3:46:54.560 --> 3:46:57.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:46:57.560 --> 3:46:59.560]  Hello.
[3:47:12.560 --> 3:47:15.560]  Ah, goodbye, Rosie, Queen of Coronavirus.
[3:47:15.560 --> 3:47:18.560]  See me and William down by the schoolyard.
[3:47:18.560 --> 3:47:27.560]  Yep. And again, stay healthy. What you want is ultra 12 and vitamin mineral fusion combo.
[3:47:27.560 --> 3:47:38.560]  Fifty percent off vitamin mineral fusion, 40 percent off and ultra 12, 40 percent off individually.
[3:47:38.560 --> 3:47:46.560]  So to boost your body, boost your body and support your immune system against the coming illness season,

[3:48:06.560 --> 3:48:13.560]  Ultra 12 is their vitamin B12 formula reimagined with a more powerful and concentrated source.
[3:48:13.560 --> 3:48:18.560]  So look, it's things are getting bad and times are getting tough and you got to stay healthy.
[3:48:18.560 --> 3:48:23.560]  These are the products you need to get on top and to stay on top.
[3:48:23.560 --> 3:48:27.560]  One of my sayings is when things are going down, you got to double up.
[3:48:27.560 --> 3:48:31.560]  You got to double up on your health, double up on your fitness.
[3:48:31.560 --> 3:48:36.560]  Get strong and these products help you do that and stay in good shape.
[3:48:36.560 --> 3:48:46.560]  And for me, I like that super male vitality keeps that boogie going, you know, and you got a boogie before the lights go out because tomorrow is iffy.
[3:48:46.560 --> 3:48:50.560]  And speaking about the lights going out tomorrow is iffy.
[3:48:50.560 --> 3:49:04.560]  Over the weekend, some 30 civilians were killed in Yemen by the murderous Saudi group that the United States and France and the UK is selling weapons to.
[3:49:04.560 --> 3:49:07.560]  It's the worst humanitarian crisis on earth.
[3:49:07.560 --> 3:49:10.560]  Doesn't make the news at all.
[3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:14.560]  Fourteen million people starving to death.
[3:49:14.560 --> 3:49:20.560]  So, you know, I launched Occupied Peace, so I put my money where my heart is and my mind is.
[3:49:20.560 --> 3:49:22.560]  But this does not make the news at all.
[3:49:22.560 --> 3:49:24.560]  It's totally out.
[3:49:24.560 --> 3:49:30.560]  So going back to the election for a moment, someone I really respect, I really like her writing.
[3:49:30.560 --> 3:49:35.560]  And her name is Caitlin Johnson or John Stone.
[3:49:35.560 --> 3:49:43.560]  And she writes about Buddha gig and what's going on in Washington.
[3:49:43.560 --> 3:49:54.560]  She says, talking about the institutions that already in power the demo craps and repulsive kids as I call them.
[3:49:54.560 --> 3:50:07.560]  She said, change is not going to come from these institutions. It's going to come from the people using the power of their numbers to force important changes that those institutions do not want to make.
[3:50:07.560 --> 3:50:10.560]  And Pete, but a gig knows this.
[3:50:10.560 --> 3:50:17.560]  And so do the Spooks and oligarchs who are backing him.
[3:50:17.560 --> 3:50:27.560]  It's not appropriate that a military intelligence officer with ties to the CIA, who is beloved by intelligence, the FES agency insiders.
[3:50:27.560 --> 3:50:43.560]  And it appears to have been groomed by national security mandarins from the very beginning of his career should be actively working to kill a revolutionary zeitgeist.
[3:50:43.560 --> 3:50:54.560]  And after all, backing counter revolutionaries is a favorite CIA activity.
[3:50:54.560 --> 3:51:07.560]  She goes on to write progressives already got sucked into forfeiting their revolutionary spirit in exchange for flowery prose and empty rhetoric.
[3:51:07.560 --> 3:51:17.560]  The last time they elected Pete Buddha gig for president back then when Pete Buddha gig was named Barack Obama.
[3:51:17.560 --> 3:51:25.560]  It was literally the exact same script. They're trying to recycle with puppet Pete.
[3:51:25.560 --> 3:51:28.560]  She's really nail this.
[3:51:28.560 --> 3:51:33.560]  This guy is the other Obama.
[3:51:33.560 --> 3:51:41.560]  He's empty rhetoric. I asked young people, who do you like? Well, I like Bernie Sanders, but I don't think he could get elected where I like Mayor Pete.
[3:51:41.560 --> 3:51:43.560]  They call him Mayor Pete.
[3:51:43.560 --> 3:51:47.560]  What do you like him? Well, you know, he's very elegant, eloquent.
[3:51:47.560 --> 3:51:53.560]  And, you know, I support the gay community. Great.
[3:51:53.560 --> 3:51:55.560]  He's eloquent. You support the gay community.
[3:51:55.560 --> 3:51:57.560]  But what about his stance on anything?
[3:51:57.560 --> 3:52:01.560]  Well, you know, the way he expresses himself, you know, he's very intelligent.
[3:52:01.560 --> 3:52:05.560]  Yeah, but on what issues do you support him?
[3:52:05.560 --> 3:52:08.560]  They don't have a clue of any issue.
[3:52:08.560 --> 3:52:12.560]  This guy is just more the same, but worse.
[3:52:12.560 --> 3:52:16.560]  He's another Obama.
[3:52:16.560 --> 3:52:20.560]  And if he's not here now, he'll be back again.
[3:52:20.560 --> 3:52:22.560]  And people buy the BS.
[3:52:22.560 --> 3:52:24.560]  People forget.
[3:52:24.560 --> 3:52:30.560]  I have the magazines right after Obama got elected.
[3:52:30.560 --> 3:52:33.560]  Oh, yeah, they had him as George Washington.
[3:52:33.560 --> 3:52:35.560]  Yeah, there's that Buddha.
[3:52:35.560 --> 3:52:38.560]  Look at him all dressed up in his military outfit.
[3:52:38.560 --> 3:52:40.560]  They're tough guy.
[3:52:40.560 --> 3:52:42.560]  Yeah, you ever saw warfare now?
[3:52:42.560 --> 3:52:46.560]  I think he used to drive the generals around and insider.
[3:52:46.560 --> 3:52:54.560]  Oh, and then people say also people that are anti war, they say, oh, and he's a veteran, a veteran of the CIA.
[3:52:54.560 --> 3:52:59.560]  Harvard Princeton Yale bullets, bombs and banks is a Harvard boy.
[3:52:59.560 --> 3:53:02.560]  Yeah, a Rhodes scholar.
[3:53:02.560 --> 3:53:05.560]  Oh, yeah, Rhodes, that guy.
[3:53:05.560 --> 3:53:09.560]  Yeah, that road Asia that Rhodes.
[3:53:09.560 --> 3:53:12.560]  Yeah, wonderful, wonderful man.
[3:53:12.560 --> 3:53:13.560]  Like apartheid.
[3:53:13.560 --> 3:53:15.560]  He was a champion.
[3:53:15.560 --> 3:53:18.560]  That's boot again.
[3:53:18.560 --> 3:53:20.560]  He's right in there.
[3:53:20.560 --> 3:53:24.560]  One of them.
[3:53:24.560 --> 3:53:26.560]  A puppet.
[3:53:26.560 --> 3:53:29.560]  Next Obama.
[3:53:29.560 --> 3:53:32.560]  And boy, he's doing the sale.
[3:53:32.560 --> 3:53:37.560]  But as I said, just this weekend.
[3:53:37.560 --> 3:53:40.560]  I changed my forecast.
[3:53:40.560 --> 3:53:41.560]  I'm not.
[3:53:41.560 --> 3:53:44.560]  I still think Trump 2020.
[3:53:44.560 --> 3:53:46.560]  But Sanders has a shot.
[3:53:46.560 --> 3:53:48.560]  Yep.
[3:53:48.560 --> 3:53:50.560]  And a Buddha gig.
[3:53:50.560 --> 3:53:55.560]  Just a member of the Silicon Valley.
[3:53:55.560 --> 3:53:59.560]  Not less spineless.
[3:53:59.560 --> 3:54:04.560]  Not an ounce of passion in their soul.
[3:54:04.560 --> 3:54:15.560]  Big time tech guys and girls that he's getting the support from a lot of big money behind them coming from the financial industry.
[3:54:15.560 --> 3:54:17.560]  He's just their puppet.
[3:54:17.560 --> 3:54:25.560]  Pete as Caitlin Johnson accurately identified.
[3:54:25.560 --> 3:54:28.560]  So they're moving into this election cycle.
[3:54:28.560 --> 3:54:33.560]  Another thing that you know, I had forecast on Alex Jones before.
[3:54:33.560 --> 3:54:37.560]  And it looks like it's coming to past right now.
[3:54:37.560 --> 3:54:40.560]  As I said before the election.
[3:54:40.560 --> 3:54:43.560]  There will be peace with Afghanistan.
[3:54:43.560 --> 3:54:45.560]  There'll be a peace treaty.
[3:54:45.560 --> 3:54:48.560]  And there'll be a peace treaty with North Korea.
[3:54:48.560 --> 3:54:51.560]  And that's going to help Trump too.
[3:54:51.560 --> 3:54:56.560]  And again, I don't like any of them.
[3:54:56.560 --> 3:54:59.560]  The only one I like at all is.
[3:54:59.560 --> 3:55:04.560]  And she's off the list now is Tulsi Gabbard for her peace program.
[3:55:04.560 --> 3:55:07.560]  And she fought in the military.
[3:55:07.560 --> 3:55:09.560]  She was in Iraq and medical.
[3:55:09.560 --> 3:55:14.560]  She saw the suffering that our soldiers are going through.
[3:55:14.560 --> 3:55:19.560]  And that's why she wants to end the wars.
[3:55:19.560 --> 3:55:23.560]  And that's why Eisenhower hated war.
[3:55:23.560 --> 3:55:28.560]  Five Star General Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, two term president.
[3:55:28.560 --> 3:55:34.560]  Who also said anyone seeking the office is either an ego maniac or crazy.
[3:55:34.560 --> 3:55:36.560]  He was he didn't seek the office.
[3:55:36.560 --> 3:55:38.560]  Your office saw him.
[3:55:38.560 --> 3:55:44.560]  And his farewell address warning that the military industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists.
[3:55:44.560 --> 3:55:46.560]  Swear the labors of the future of the children.
[3:55:46.560 --> 3:55:49.560]  And that's what's happened.
[3:55:49.560 --> 3:55:51.560]  So.
[3:55:51.560 --> 3:55:53.560]  You got these guys over here.
[3:55:53.560 --> 3:55:55.560]  From Sanders.
[3:55:55.560 --> 3:55:57.560]  Buttergeg.
[3:55:57.560 --> 3:56:01.560]  To the rest was okay with them.
[3:56:01.560 --> 3:56:03.560]  Yeah.
[3:56:03.560 --> 3:56:05.560]  Going back to the troops.
[3:56:05.560 --> 3:56:08.560]  We have over 20 a day.
[3:56:08.560 --> 3:56:10.560]  Committing suicide.
[3:56:10.560 --> 3:56:13.560]  That have left the service.
[3:56:13.560 --> 3:56:15.560]  So I want to see.
[3:56:15.560 --> 3:56:18.560]  A new GI bill.
[3:56:18.560 --> 3:56:21.560]  To take care of them.
[3:56:21.560 --> 3:56:26.560]  And one of the ways we could do that is with occupied peace because all the bases overseas.
[3:56:26.560 --> 3:56:30.560]  And put the troops to work rebuilding our third world infrastructure.
[3:56:30.560 --> 3:56:33.560]  Give them skills.
[3:56:33.560 --> 3:56:36.560]  Hands on knowledge.
[3:56:36.560 --> 3:56:38.560]  And the industry is looking for them.
[3:56:38.560 --> 3:56:42.560]  They're short of good workers.
[3:56:42.560 --> 3:56:45.560]  And that's what we need right now.
[3:56:45.560 --> 3:56:47.560]  A good workers.
[3:56:47.560 --> 3:56:52.560]  And they could be it our troops to have a future.
[3:56:52.560 --> 3:56:55.560]  Rather than wasting our money destroying other countries.
[3:56:55.560 --> 3:56:59.560]  And getting people to hate us that want to retaliate.
[3:56:59.560 --> 3:57:03.560]  If I was in a rocky my country was invaded by a foreign force.
[3:57:03.560 --> 3:57:06.560]  And want to kill every foreigner that came into my country.
[3:57:06.560 --> 3:57:08.560]  Of that country.
[3:57:08.560 --> 3:57:10.560]  That occupied destroyed my nation.
[3:57:10.560 --> 3:57:12.560]  So we need peace on earth.
[3:57:12.560 --> 3:57:15.560]  It's up to you to make it happen.
[3:57:15.560 --> 3:57:18.560]  It's up to you to keep the truth flowing.
[3:57:18.560 --> 3:57:22.560]  So again, do what you can to support info wars by their great products.
[3:57:22.560 --> 3:57:23.560]  I do.
[3:57:23.560 --> 3:57:25.560]  I believe in a lot of them.
[3:57:25.560 --> 3:57:28.560]  And again, it's up to you to make the change.
[3:57:28.560 --> 3:57:30.560]  It does not take a majority to prevail,
[3:57:30.560 --> 3:57:32.560]  but rather an irate, tireless minority.
[3:57:32.560 --> 3:57:38.560]  Keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men and women.
[3:57:38.560 --> 3:57:39.560]  See you next week.
[3:57:39.560 --> 3:57:59.560]  And thanks a lot.
